  "<p>Does being uprooted matter? Does being removed from the country in which you were born and where you spent the first years of your life leave an indefinable emotional scar? I don't believe so. Many of the \"uprooted\" are clearly much happier in their adopted countries than they were in their countries of origin. But making a new home in a completely new environment and a completely new language inevitably influences a person's perceptions, both about him- or herself and about others.</p> <p>I was born in Jerusalem shortly before the second world war and lived there until I was nearly nine. It would never again be my home.</p> <p>My parents had met there, both having left Germany soon after Hitler came to power. My mother had had to abandon her legal studies in Berlin when the Nazis decreed that Jews could no longer practise law. My father, at that time already a successful lawyer, was debarred from continuing his career. But they were young and unattached and, like many Jews who could afford to start a new life, they set off for Palestine, where Jews could live freely. They married in 1937.</p> <p>Neither of them were committed Zionists. On the contrary, my father's experiences in the first world war as a soldier in the German army (he had won an Iron Cross) had put him off all forms of nationalism. My mother, before the rise of Hitler, had been in favour of assimilation, believing that the more Jews and non-Jews intermarried, the more likely it would be that the \"Jewish problem\" would gradually fade away.</p> <p>Nor were they religious. In common with many German Jews, they did not observe Jewish customs or traditions in any shape or form. Throughout my childhood I never once entered a synagogue \u2013 I barely knew there were such places \u2013 and was brought up in ignorance of the most basic tenets of Judaism.</p> <p>Soon after his arrival in Jerusalem, my father, whose family had been in the retail business, set up a women's fashion store. It was to become the largest such store in the city (which was much smaller in those days). The Queen of Jordan sometimes shopped there. We lived in a large flat above the shop where, as an only child, I spent a great deal of time playing on my own. At home I spoke German and later, at school, Hebrew.</p> <p>My mother was much stricter than would be acceptable today. During mealtimes, for example, I often had to hold books under my arms to make sure that my elbows weren't sticking out. If I didn't finish my spinach at lunchtime, it would be served up again for supper, with a bit of sugar sprinkled on it.</p> <p>Not that my childhood in Jerusalem was unhappy. One of my most vivid memories, for example, is of an annual excursion to pick flowers with my adored father. He would take the day off \u2013 presumably with the aim of putting in what is now called \"quality time\" with me \u2013 and we would walk hand in hand to the outskirts of town. We would clamber across rocky hills looking for the long-stemmed wild cyclamen \u2013 pink, purple and white \u2013 that sprang up every year in the patches of dusty earth between the rocks.</p> <p>We were always alone on this stony high ground, with its panoramic view of the old city surrounded by olive groves. Even as a small child I could sense that there was something historic and mythical in this landscape, or so it seems to me now.</p> <p>Life at home and at school was going well when, in 1947 (just before the state of Israel came into being), my parents decided to leave Palestine; they were eager to resume their former careers. When we set sail, I thought we were going on holiday. I had no idea that I was never to return \u2013 or only years later, as a tourist. I suppose my parents felt that to explain that we were emigrating would upset me too much. So I was not given the chance to say goodbye to my friends, teachers or anyone else.</p> <p>While my parents travelled to England and America looking for work, they left me in a small boarding school in Switzerland. It was a completely different world and I was overwhelmed by so many new impressions and demands that I soon began to forget my old life. I also began to forget the Hebrew language. When they came to fetch me after a year, I was speaking Swiss-German, which they could barely understand.</p> <p>Eventually my father was offered an important and very suitable job with an Anglo-American legal aid society to compensate the victims of Nazi persecution. But there was a downside: it meant living in Germany, the last place my parents had wanted to go back to. They reluctantly agreed, but couldn't accept that their daughter should be brought up and educated as a German.</p> <p>Throughout my childhood my parents never talked to me about the Holocaust. Presumably, they wished to protect me from the knowledge of human evil. Indeed, I gradually deduced, but was never directly told, that my mother's parents had perished in a concentration camp. My mother had travelled back to Germany shortly before the outbreak of war to persuade them to leave but they had refused. A regime as barbaric as Hitler's, they thought, could surely not survive.</p> <p>My parents wanted me to be English. Like most refugees throughout the world, they greatly admired England \u2013 for its tolerance, its independent spirit, its courage in resisting tyranny, its rule of law.</p> <p>In 1948, my mother went to England to search for a suitable boarding school for me. At that time, many girls' boarding schools did not accept pupils who spoke no English. So she decided on Dartington Hall, the co-educational, \"progressive\" and somewhat notorious school situated in Devon. She deposited me there and left me to sink or swim.</p> <p>I sank, temporarily at least. It is a miserable experience to be completely cut off, without a single family member or trusted friend in the whole country to speak to or confide in. Every evening I used to hide in a corner of the school's large, dark gym so that I could cry without being seen.</p> <p>It took about a year to learn fluent English, after which I soon became an integrated and happy member of the school. Luckily for me, there was a terrific craze for roller-skating a few months after I arrived and because I had learned ice-skating in Switzerland, I was a whizz at this \"sport\". So my lowly status was slightly enhanced.</p> <p>Occasionally my parents came to see me, but my chief memory of these visits is the embarrassment I felt because of their German accents. As they had intended, I had been thoroughly anglicised.</p> <p>In the ensuing years I was too preoccupied \u2013 getting married, having children, working \u2013 to think much about my childhood in Jerusalem. I did, however, have a rather surprising experience in my thirties, when I went to see the Hollywood epic Exodus. Before this very mediocre film begins, while the credits are rolling, the wide screen is filled with some beautiful panoramic scenes of Jerusalem and its surrounding hills and olive trees. As soon as I saw this, I unexpectedly burst into tears.</p> <p>Since then, I have only been to Israel for three or four short visits, the most recent of which came about in a most unexpected way. I found myself seated, at a conference, next to a charming Israeli journalist. He was about the same age as me and had also been born in Jerusalem. But talking about our common background turned out to be a uncomfortable experience.</p> <p>What school had I attended, he asked. Alas, I couldn't remember its name. What about the names of any teachers? Again, sorry, can't remember. OK, surely I could recall the names of some school friends?</p> <p>Well, yes, I remember the name of one girl, who had been my best friend \u2013 Ruth. Ruth what? It was almost exactly 60 years ago, I protested.</p> <p>\"Well,\" he said, \"I regard this as a challenge. I will find your Ruth.\" He was as good as his word. It took him only a few phone calls.</p> <p>My Ruth turned out to be a good friend of his. She remembered me well.</p> <p>A day or two later I got a call from Ruty (as she was known) who sounded so friendly and jolly that I was instantly drawn to her. We decided to email each other our life stories, starting from the time we had last seen each other.</p> <p>So began an absorbing correspondence, which proceeded by chronological instalments. Every day we would eagerly await the arrival of a new episode and, like Victorian novelists, we sometimes deliberately ended on a cliff-hanger. Our stories could hardly have been more different.</p> <p>Ruty's life resembled an action thriller. After military service she had worked in various psychiatric centres and addiction clinics; she had founded Israel's first organisation to help dyslexic students and she had worked in the Israeli parliament, becoming head of the foreign relations department. Meanwhile, she had lived through the hardships and terrors of war. My story by contrast, with its succession of desk jobs, was more akin to a romantic novelette.</p> <p>When our narratives reached the present day, Ruty invited me to Jerusalem, to attend a lunch party she was giving for her women friends. Of course I accepted.</p> <p>The party was attended by about 30 women \u2013 doctors, archaeologists, lawyers, journalists. I have never before, or since, been to a gathering where there was such a strong feeling of mutual trust, openness and equality.</p> <p>None of the elements which so often impair the enjoyment of social occasions in England \u2013 cliquishness, social insecurity, insincerity, and so on \u2013 were present. I was hugely impressed and attracted by these women, but at the same time felt very English, and very much an outsider.</p> <p>The question I was most often asked was: \"Why did you leave Israel?\"</p> <p>My reply, that it had been my parents' decision, not mine, seemed not quite to satisfy them. Perhaps I was imagining this \u2013 there was certainly nothing reproachful in anyone's reaction \u2013 but I felt an unasked question hovering in the air: why hadn't I come back when I was old enough to make my own decisions?</p> <p>How would I have replied? The truth is that it never occurred to me to return to Israel. I greatly admired the country's achievements \u2013 its democratic way of life, its outstanding universities, its cultural attainments, its contributions to medicine and so on \u2013 but I had no family or friends there. I had been brought up, for better or worse, without any sense of religious or ethnic identity. Though I have never felt totally at home in England, I married an English husband and had brought up two English children.</p> <p>I was very happy to be English \u2013 or almost English.</p> <p><em>\u2022 An Almost English Life, by Miriam Gross, is published by Short Books, \u00a314.99.

  "<p>It was late evening on a Monday in April, the end of a bright autumn day in Johannesburg, when Mum died. The nurses who were caring for her had made her comfortable for the night, turning her on to her side with a pillow to cuddle, the way&#xa0;she liked to sleep. My sisters Vicky and Jassy&#xa0;and I were with her. We held her hands, told&#xa0;her how much we loved her, and that it was safe and right for her to go. After a few minutes, her breathing stopped. It was a good death \u2013 the kind&#xa0;of death I think most people would choose if&#xa0;we could: free from pain and surrounded by love. She wasn't hooked up to tubes or monitors; she was even wearing her own pretty nightdress rather than a hospital gown. I&#xa0;suppose it's what you'd call a natural death. But in&#xa0;one way Mum's&#xa0;death was exceptional, shocking even. She&#xa0;had decided to die, about 10 days before, and&#xa0;for the&#xa0;previous six days had had no food and almost&#xa0;no water. She had chosen to die of thirst.</p> <p>The story of Mum's death begins in September 2008, when she sent an email to her daughters, telling us that she had been diagnosed with colon cancer. \"Don't worry about me, darlings,\" she wrote \u2013 but it was clear that she herself was desperately worried: about loss of dignity, about the cost of her medical care, about whether Dad would be able to learn to make his favourite spaghetti bolognese if she was unable to cook for them both \u2013 all the details of death. In the event, after a frightening and rocky few weeks and major surgery, Mum recovered well, and by the beginning of this year we had all started to make plans to celebrate her 80th birthday in August. With Mum and Dad's five daughters living so far&#xa0;apart, times when we were all together are rare and precious.</p> <p>Then, at the end of February, came a letter from my eldest sister Emma in place of Mum's normal Sunday email. \"Mum isn't feeling great,\" she wrote, \"and she asked me to write so you wouldn't worry.\" But, of course, we instantly did begin to worry, and it was only a few days before the diagnosis we'd dreaded arrived. Mum's cancer had metastasised and spread to her brain and possibly also to her lungs. Her oncologist immediately set her on a course of radiotherapy and cortisone to shrink the tumours, telling us that it would take up&#xa0;to two weeks before we knew whether the treatment had been effective.</p> <p>Vicky, who has experience caring for the terminally ill, travelled to Johannesburg to help Mum and Dad, and they had long and honest talks about the decisions Mum faced. She wasn't quite ready, she said at first, to leave Dad, \"this beautiful world\", as she put it, and us. But over the next few days, Mum's condition began to deteriorate, and she became increasingly uncomfortable and frustrated. Mum was a very private person. She loved order; she hated mess and squalor, and illness is often messy and squalid. She told Vicky again and again that she didn't want to go through more treatment. She didn't want Dad to see cancer killing her. She wanted to die quickly and quietly. She didn't want any fuss.</p> <p>It was Emma who first told Mum about an article she'd read several years earlier in the <a href=\"http://jama.jamanetwork.com/journal.aspx\" title=\"\">Journal of the American Medical Association</a> about voluntary refusal of food and drink as a means of bringing about death in the terminally ill. The author described it as a relatively painless way to die: a&#xa0;gradual slipping away into a coma, followed by death. Typically, a person will take between five and 10 days to die this way and, crucially, they have the option to change their mind and stop the process until almost the end. Mum just latched on to the idea, Emma remembers. She decided that she was going to stop taking the cortisone that was keeping the tumours in check, and stop eating and drinking as well. She wasn't going to let the disease take over.</p> <p>Like many people, I simply didn't know that choosing to stop eating and drinking is, as Jassy put it, \"a Thing\". But it is \u2013 it's a thing about which you can find pages and pages of information on the internet, once you have a reason to Google it. It's a thing that's been reported quite extensively in medical literature, known variously as VSED (<a href=\"http://www.google.co.uk/search?client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;q=Voluntary+Stopping+Eating+and+Drinking&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;redir_esc=&amp;ei=2KJEUKi8Nuqw0QXc-IDgBA\" title=\"\">Voluntary Stopping Eating and Drinking</a>), VRFF (<a href=\"http://www.google.co.uk/search?client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;q=Voluntary+Stopping+Eating+and+Drinking&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;redir_esc=&amp;ei=2KJEUKi8Nuqw0QXc-IDgBA#hl=en&amp;client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;sclient=psy-ab&amp;q=Voluntary+Refusal+of+Food+and+Fluid&amp;oq=Voluntary+Refusal+of+Food+and+Fluid&amp;gs_l=serp.3..0.26725.26725.0.27518.1.1.0.0.0.0.304.304.3-1.1.0...0.0...1c.u7CVEMMNukw&amp;pbx=1&amp;bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.r_qf.&amp;fp=1015eafb01221851&amp;biw=1544&amp;bih=989\" title=\"\">Voluntary Refusal of Food and Fluid</a>), PRNH (<a href=\"http://www.google.co.uk/search?client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;q=Voluntary+Stopping+Eating+and+Drinking&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;redir_esc=&amp;ei=2KJEUKi8Nuqw0QXc-IDgBA#hl=en&amp;client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;sclient=psy-ab&amp;q=Patient+Refusal+of+Nutrition+and+Hydration&amp;oq=Patient+Refusal+of+Nutrition+and+Hydration&amp;gs_l=serp.3..0j0i30.18099.18099.1.19079.1.1.0.0.0.0.90.90.1.1.0...0.0...1c.n_11dpZZ1F0&amp;pbx=1&amp;bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.r_qf.&amp;fp=1015eafb01221851&amp;biw=1544&amp;bih=989\" title=\"\">Patient Refusal of Nutrition and Hydration</a>), or self-dehydration. It's&#xa0;a thing doctors who have practised for a long time and seen many patients die at home describe&#xa0;as \"taking to their bed\" or \"turning their&#xa0;face to the wall\". It's a thing that was explored and argued by lawyers acting for the man known publicly as Martin, whose case was&#xa0;recently heard alongside <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/tony-nicklinson\" title=\"\">Tony Nicklinson</a>'s. It's a&#xa0;thing, as I discovered when researching this&#xa0;article, that people seem afraid to talk about.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395681435\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/5/1346844476948/Sophie-Mackenzie-family-s-008.jpg\" alt=\"Sophie Mackenzie family snap\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018She wanted the kind of death most people would choose, if we could\u2019 (from left): Jassy, Juliet, Sophie, Emma and Vicky with their parents. Photograph: Courtesy Sophie Mackenzie</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy Sophie Mackenzie</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There is nothing illegal about refusing food and drink; in fact, feeding a competent person against their will constitutes assault. Nonetheless, Mum was afraid that something would happen to prevent her reaching her goal. She worried about falling and breaking a hip, ending up in hospital and being caught in a spiral of intervention that would prolong her life. She worried that intravenous nutrition and hydration would be given to \"keep her comfortable\" if she became unconscious. She had signed a living will expressing her preferences, but such advance directives are generally regarded as worthless unless the dying person has a supportive medical team who understand their wishes and are prepared to act upon them.</p> <p>South Africa's legal position on <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/assisted-suicide\" title=\"\">assisted dying</a> is fundamentally the same as Britain's: if you help another person bring about their death, you could risk prosecution. As in the UK, there have been attempts to clarify the law on end-of-life decision-making processes, removing the grey areas that currently exist. <a href=\"http://www.whoswho.co.za/willem-landman-3092\" title=\"\">Professor Willem Landman</a>, CEO of the Ethics Institute of South Africa, is one of the leading figures campaigning for a change in the law. He explains that in 1998, President Nelson Mandela commissioned a report into the legal and ethical issues surrounding assisted dying, assisted suicide and euthanasia, but after being tabled in parliament in 2000, the report was ignored by the ministry of health. Landman believes this may be because the then minister of health, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manto_Tshabalala-Msimang\" title=\"\">Dr Manto Tshabalala-Msimang</a>, regarded the issue as something of a middle-class problem. Perhaps it is. When birth and death are less medicalised and a more integral and familiar part of life, perhaps choice in&#xa0;such matters seems an unnecessary luxury. Perhaps mothers do die gently, cared for by their daughters, without worrying about indignity and fuss. But they don't die quickly, or without pain.</p> <p>Mum had always talked frankly to us about death. My sister Juliet remembers when she was a&#xa0;little girl and terrified of dying, Mum telling her, \"Your body is like a suit of old clothes \u2013 by that time you will be tired of it and you won't want it any more.\" Mum hated clutter and hoarding; when a thing had outlived its usefulness, it was to be disposed of without sentiment, whether it was a favourite dress the moths had got to, a book that was falling apart at the spine or her own body. She&#xa0;made it clear to us that she would far rather be dead than be a burden on her husband and daughters. Now, with her hands becoming increasingly unsteady and fits of dizziness coming unexpectedly, she was finding the colostomy bag she'd had since her surgery in 2008 difficult and humiliating to deal with. She felt that her body was wearing out and, more frighteningly, her head felt heavy and fuzzy.</p> <p>Over the course of a long phone call, Vicky told me that Mum had made a decision. She was going to stop taking the medication that was checking the spread of her cancer, and stop eating and drinking, too. We had about a week to say goodbye, so Juliet and I flew to Johannesburg as&#xa0;soon as we could. It was the sort of family reunion Mum loved, and in many ways it was like all the other happy times we have spent together, filled with love and laughter. We planned meals together, cooked in Mum and Dad's tiny kitchen, ate and drank together, just as we've always done on family holidays, over Christmases and at other celebrations \u2013 only this time it was Mum's life we were celebrating, while she went through the process of dying.</p> <p>It was the most remarkable week of my life, and&#xa0;it has left me unafraid of death.</p> <p>I'd been afraid of seeing Mum since this latest illness. I was expecting to find her diminished, somehow less herself. But I was amazed by how well she seemed. Vicky had cropped her hair so that she wouldn't have to experience it falling out, and Mum, with the pride in her looks that beautiful women never lose, was obviously upset by her appearance. But to me she looked lovely. She shone with happiness at having all her daughters there with her and Dad. She was full of her usual curiosity and humour. She didn't look like someone who was ready to die, and this frightened me \u2013 what if somehow stopping eating and drinking didn't work, and Mum lingered on in pain? What if the process didn't take a matter of days but a matter of weeks? Part of me knew how much she would hate to be thwarted in her intent; part of me longed to keep her with us for longer, and hoped that, even now, some sort of miracle might happen. I even suggested to Mum&#xa0;that she should stay at home for a few days,&#xa0;just to see how she felt, but she was adamant: her decision had been made. The next&#xa0;day, she was going to move to the nursing home at the retirement community where she and Dad lived, and she was going to die there.</p> <p>Although Mum was unable to walk unsupported and her hands were very shaky, she was alert and lucid, chatting to us as she always had. Her appetite was small, but she was still enjoying food: pizza with olives and anchovies, strong cheddar cheese, the fruit cake Juliet had baked and been saving for Mum's 80th birthday. Juliet's cake was the last thing Mum ate, on Wednesday 28 March, when her brother visited to say goodbye, and she had a last chat with her sister in the UK. We were all in tears that morning, except for Mum, who stayed calm and cheerful.</p> <p>I didn't see Mum leave her home for the last time. Dad, Emma, Juliet and Vicky were with her,&#xa0;and Juliet cried afterwards when she told Jassy and me how Mum had gone around the little house where she and Dad had been so happy,&#xa0;saying goodbye to it and all her precious things, before being driven the few hundred yards to the nursing home. The staff there welcomed her and settled her into bed, and she&#xa0;curled up and went to sleep.</p> <p>It's fortunate that Mum was surrounded by people who supported her decision. Her GP believes that people at the end of their lives should have the right to be \"conductors of their own orchestra\", and made it plain that she would prescribe whatever pain relief Mum needed to mask the symptoms of her advancing cancer, and&#xa0;whatever sedation she required to alleviate distress. The management of the nursing home hold the same view. Her GP gave them written instructions explaining Mum's decision and outlining the care she would need. \"She is a very brave lady,\" the email concluded. And, of course, Mum had five daughters who adored her and a&#xa0;husband who'd worshipped her for almost 60 years, and we were all unequivocally on her side.</p> <p>The five of us sisters rallied behind Mum and Dad; we were a team. As I write this, it's difficult to isolate my own feelings and experiences from those of my sisters \u2013 who said what, who made decisions, who cried. It's a gruesome analogy, but the five of&#xa0;us, Dad, Mum's GP and her carers were like a&#xa0;cheerleading squad urging her on towards the goal she had chosen. This isn't always the case. I&#xa0;was horrified to read a 2011 report in the New York Times which <a href=\"http://newoldage.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/08/24/deciding-to-die-then-shown-the-door/\" title=\"\">told the story of Armond and Dorothy Rudolph</a>. The Rudolphs, both in their 90s and with failing health, made the decision to&#xa0;end their lives together by stopping eating and drinking while they were still mentally competent and able to live independently. The management of the assisted-living facility where they had their&#xa0;home responded by attempting to evict them. It was only after intervention by the couple's family, the local press and medical and legal experts that the attempt was stopped. Armond Rudolph died after 10 days without food&#xa0;and drink, and Dorothy a day later.</p> <p>We laughed a lot over the next few days. We teased Juliet about developing late-onset colour-blindness when she kept putting bottles of red wine in the fridge, while the white stayed warm on the kitchen counter. Jassy and I speculated macabrely about what would happen if the nurses forgot to take down the \"Nil by Mouth\" sign over Mum's bed after she died \u2013 we imagined some poor old dear being moved into her cubicle and waving plaintively as the tea trolley rattled unheedingly past. Emma and Juliet still haven't let me forget the nightmare 10-mile walk I dragged them on around the suburbs of Johannesburg, possibly the world's least pedestrian-friendly city. One night after dinner, Emma and Juliet went to visit Mum, and the three of them chatted and reminisced until eventually my sisters were asked to leave \u2013 their laughter was keeping the other old ladies awake.</p> <p>In the midst of Mum's death, our normal lives went on. I was writing a seemingly endless list of&#xa0;product descriptions of cheeses \u2013 I'd hoped that Mum would have enjoyed working with me on them; a writer herself, she would have embraced the challenge of describing the differences between stilton and roquefort. But she was too drowsy, although she loved being read to. We planned each day as it came: who would be spending time with Mum, and when; who would cook, and what, and for how many. Of&#xa0;course we talked about Mum and what was happening, sharing our fears about what the next&#xa0;few days would hold, and our happy memories of her. Often, it felt just as if she was there with us, as she always had been when the family was together.</p> <p>There were hard parts, too. By Friday, although Mum was still spending a lot of time asleep, her&#xa0;waking hours were difficult. She was dreaming, she told us, about drinking ice-cold Coke, and waking feeling desperately thirsty, as&#xa0;one does with a bad hangover. Chips of ice helped to relieve the dryness in her mouth, and&#xa0;she had sugar-free mints to suck as well as frequent glycerine mouth swabs, but the thirst remained. She also developed a pounding headache as her&#xa0;blood sugar level fell. Emma bought her some&#xa0;Coke, thinking that the occasional sip would make her more comfortable&#xa0;and do little or&#xa0;nothing to prolong her life. But Vicky, determined to support Mum&#xa0;completely in her decision, said,&#xa0;\"It could set her back days!\" and took it away, leaving the&#xa0;nurses crying in her wake. That&#xa0;day, Mum said to&#xa0;us, \"I didn't realise it would be so hard.\"</p> <p>She wasn't the only one. Being a spectator at the death of someone you love is bitterly hard. We expect medical science to intervene to relieve suffering, and to a great extent it does. But the journey is a lonely one. Even surrounded by the people who loved her most, and professionals who gave her the very best palliative care, Mum fought her battle for death alone. How much more lonely, and how much more frightening, the process must be for people who aren't supported by their family, or aren't able to communicate their wishes, I can only imagine.</p> <p>Mum spent a lot of the next three days asleep, but when she was awake, we chatted to her and to&#xa0;each other, and Jassy read to her from her new novel, which is dedicated to Mum. She also enjoyed having her hands massaged with her favourite body lotion as her skin began to get dryer, and the scent greeted us when we came into the ward to see her. Dad was his usual self: strong, serene and often silent, surrounded by his&#xa0;five chattering daughters, but occasionally cracking us all up with his characteristic dry wit. He spent a lot of time at Mum's bedside, sitting with her while she slept. Mostly, it was a peaceful&#xa0;and happy time.</p> <p>On Sunday, Mum began to slip away. In the morning she was still alert, asking for ice to suck and chatting to us almost normally, but by the evening she was no longer able to speak easily. I'd&#xa0;had a bad cold for the previous few days, and when I heard the new rattle in Mum's breathing, I&#xa0;became convinced that she had caught it and my virus was going to be the thing that finally carried her off. I sat by her bed and cried my heart out \u2013 a&#xa0;mixture of guilt, grief and all the stress of the last few days just pouring out of me. I felt embarrassed by my tears in the face of Mum's courage \u2013 absurdly, I didn't want to worry her. She&#xa0;asked me several times, \"Am I going to be all right?\" I told her that she was, and that I loved her. There wasn't anything else to say. That was the last time she spoke.</p> <p>For most of the six days it took her to die, Mum&#xa0;was in no pain. The morphine patches she had been prescribed relieved any symptoms her advancing cancer might have caused, and the sedatives kept her calm and drowsy. However, it's not known whether such palliative care actually removes the dying person's experience of hunger and thirst, even once they have lost consciousness. A <a href=\"http://jme.bmj.com/content/early/2011/11/03/medethics-2011-100278.abstract\" title=\"\">paper published in the Journal of Medical Ethics in 2011</a> concluded that \"continuous deep sedation may blunt the wakefulness component of human consciousness without eradicating internal affective awareness of thirst and hunger\". I hope that, for Mum, the&#xa0;dreams of ice-cold Coke and the&#xa0;sensation of thirst stopped once&#xa0;she fell asleep&#xa0;on that Sunday&#xa0;night.</p> <p>On Monday morning, Mum was moved from the main ward where she had spent the past five nights. The curtains around her bed had remained closed while she was there \u2013 Mum would have wanted the privacy, we knew, but still we speculated darkly about whether the staff had kept her hidden in case the other ladies got ideas and decided to emulate her. Her new bed was in a private room. She barely woke when she was lifted, and she was losing the ability to swallow. In the afternoon, the vicar came to say the last rites, with all five of us sisters and Dad there, perching on her bed and chairs around it. Mum seemed to be aware of the words of the service \u2013 perhaps owing to the vicar's maximum-decibel delivery, which we all laughed about afterwards \u2013 but she was sliding deeper and deeper into unconsciousness.</p> <p>That evening passed slowly, as time does when&#xa0;you're waiting for something important to happen. I carried on with my writing \u2013 the cheese product descriptions were complete and I'd moved on to fish, and it was comforting to escape into work. Emma and Juliet were spending the night at home with&#xa0;Emma's partner and his children. Dad did a crossword puzzle; Vicky made a batch of chicken soup, using Mum's recipe. Over dinner we talked about the practical things that would soon need to be done, and decided that Vicky would be the one to phone the undertaker, and that she would remove and take care of Mum's rings and watch. We asked Dad if he felt it was important for him to&#xa0;be there when Mum died, but he felt that he had&#xa0;already said a very temporary goodbye \u2013 he was, and remains, confident that they will be together always once he joins her. So Jassy, Vicky and I took the familiar route up to the nursing home to see how&#xa0;Mum was and decide what to do&#xa0;about spending the night with her. It was the last time we'd walk that way; within a few minutes&#xa0;of our arrival, she was dead.</p> <p>I went back to Jassy's house that night and wrote about Mum's death. My overwhelming feelings were relief and pride \u2013 my brave, beautiful mother had taken on the hardest challenge of her life, and&#xa0;won. I could go home to my partner, whom I&#xa0;missed desperately, my home in London and my&#xa0;little cat. My sisters and Dad felt the same, I&#xa0;think: tired, but triumphant, too. We'd achieved&#xa0;what we had set out to do, as sisters and&#xa0;as a family.</p> <p>Even if <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dignitas_%28assisted_dying_organisation%29\" title=\"\">Dignitas</a> had been a practical option for&#xa0;Mum, I don't believe she would have chosen it. Apart from anything else, she loathed travelling. (I suspect she would also have regarded the cost as a wanton extravagance.) But&#xa0;what if there had been another way for her to&#xa0;take? An injection administered by a doctor she&#xa0;trusted, or pills brought to her by Dad or one of us? I'm not sure. Perhaps she wouldn't have wanted anyone else to bear the responsibility of having ended her life. Also, I think part of her relished the challenge, the control and the independence of doing it the hard way.</p> <p>In the obituary that was read at Mum's funeral, Vicky remembered a saying that Mum was fond of quoting: \"Old age is not for sissies.\" Mum was no&#xa0;sissy \u2013 as Emma put it later, Mum was a soldier. She embarked on her final journey with steely determination, astonishing courage and immense dignity. I feel honoured to have been a part of the&#xa0;process. I've seen that it is possible to choose and achieve a good death, on one's own terms. I&#xa0;used to be in favour of changing the law on end-of-life choices; now I am evangelical about the importance of autonomy in terminal illness and&#xa0;death. I'm so proud of what Mum did, and of&#xa0;how my father, my sisters and I helped her to achieve it. But that doesn't alter my passionate belief that people in Mum's position, or Tony Nicklinson's, or Martin's, should have more, better and easier choices.</p>",
  "<p>The way my grandad died was so unusual that it still lingers in the national psyche 37&#xa0;years on. He was watching the infamous <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuP1eycaA6c\" title=\"\">Battle Of Ecky Thump episode of the Goodies</a>, laughing uproariously, when <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Goodies#Fatal_effect\" title=\"\">he collapsed and died</a>. Doctors assumed he'd had a massive heart attack and my grandma was comforted that his final minutes were so happy, even sending a letter of thanks to the Goodies. As&#xa0;far as we were concerned, the story ended&#xa0;there.</p> <p>Decades later, his strange death has come to light again \u2013 this time because I nearly died four months ago. I was sitting talking to my husband, Mick, when I started to slur, then slumped over and began to wheeze strangely. Mick rang 999 and was told to start CPR. The paramedics arrived and discovered that my heart had stopped.</p> <p>I was rushed to hospital but I had been clinically dead for 55 minutes and it wasn't looking good. My heart&#xa0;was restarted in A&amp;E and my&#xa0;body temperature lowered with ice packs to help recovery. The medical team warned my family that my chances of a full recovery were slim. If I did survive, I could be&#xa0;brain-damaged.</p> <p>Incredibly, when I was brought round three days later, I was fine. I found it hard to grasp that I had nearly died \u2013 the whole incident seemed surreal. My family were more in shock; they had seen me dead and had been badly frightened.</p> <p>The doctors wanted to understand why my heart should stop for no reason and started to investigate. They were particularly interested in my family history, and when they heard about my grandad's death, they realised that it was likely we both suffered from Long QT syndrome, an abnormality in the heart's electrical system that can cause it suddenly to stop. It&#xa0;can go undetected for years or, as in my grandfather's case, never be identified; people with it can just drop dead and you never know why.</p> <p>After the diagnosis, I had an operation to fit an ICD next to my heart to pace its beat and shock it if it should stop again. Having this safety net is a huge comfort \u2013 it hasn't needed to restart my heart since, but I have felt it regulate the pace, which was weird: an odd, fluttery feeling in my chest.</p> <p>The next step was to get to the bottom of why it happened. With Long QT, a variety of triggers can cause the heart to stop beating. One is feeling intense emotion \u2013 for my grandad, it seems the prolonged laughing fit was his trigger. Exercise and a sudden startle such as jumping into cold water can also be factors and when my parents heard this, their blood ran cold \u2013 I swam competitively for my county during my teens, a sport that ticks two trigger boxes. I feel lucky that I had a normal, lively childhood; it would have been miserable to have had to curtail my energy.</p> <p>I won't know my exact trigger until the results of the genetic test come back in six months, and possibly not even then, which is slightly alarming because of the wide range of things it could be. I'm supposed to avoid swimming alone, rollercoasters and scuba diving.</p> <p>I'm not afraid to watch a scary movie or have a good cry, though, because the ICD will look after me, and although my life has had to change, it also has to go on.</p> <p>What concerns me more is that, because mine is an inherited condition, my daughters Ellie, aged three, and Amelie, nearly one, may also be affected. They have both had ECGs to monitor their hearts and although Amelie wriggled too much for a&#xa0;conclusive result, doctors think that Ellie may have the syndrome. She has been put on beta-blockers, which will hopefully protect her. I&#xa0;want her to be able to have a&#xa0;normal childhood, so we don't wrap her in cotton wool, but I watch her like a hawk when she plays on her trampoline or enters a race for her nursery's sports day. It's hard not to worry when a balloon pops at a children's party, though \u2013 could that be Ellie's trigger?</p> <p>Having Long QT in the family is scary, but in a bittersweet way I&#xa0;see what happened to my grandad as the start of protecting future generations. I find it very sad that he should die without the correct diagnosis, but also so grateful that his death helped piece together the mystery of our family's condition.</p> <p>\u2022 As told to Emily Cunningham</p> <p>Do you have an experience to share?

  "<p>Of all the wild fruits that start to become available as summer segues into autumn, damsons are perhaps the easiest to love. This may be because they are not truly wild, but generally escapees from domestic cultivation \u2013 plums gone rogue, if you will. A subspecies of <em>Prunus domestica</em>, they are close siblings of garden plums. Yet, having&#xa0;shaken off the shackles of horticulture and made a break for freedom, they're there for the taking, which is one more point in their favour, as far as I'm concerned.</p> <p>You will find damsons growing in all kinds of locations, some quite wild \u2013 woodland and riverbanks \u2013 others much more urban, including allotments and waste ground. Coming across a tree-full is the equivalent of hitting the foraging motherlode. Deeply fond as I am of&#xa0;all kinds of hedgerow berries, damsons seem particularly generous and inviting. These gorgeous plums have skins that are dark as midnight and overlaid by a soft, dusky bloom. When they start to arrive around the end of August, they put themselves forth in profusion, weighing down the branches like great purple gems. As long as you have access to a ladder, they are extremely easy to gather. And as long as you have some sugar in your kitchen, they are immensely rewarding to cook.</p> <p>It is technically possible to enjoy damsons straight off the tree, but only if you've found the right variety growing in a sunny spot so they're burstingly ripe \u2013 and that's a state that the local bird and wasp populations are unlikely to consent to. If you pick them sooner, eaten raw they will probably overwhelm you with tannic, cheek-hollowing sourness. However, like so many tart fruits, once cooked and sweetened, they surrender the most wonderful, complex, deep flavour.</p> <p>They make glorious crumbles and cobblers, fabulous ice-creams and sorbets, and a sophisticated, wine-dark jam that is one of the finest things you'll ever get out of a preserving pan. It's not hard, either: just simmer 2kg damsons with 800ml water until soft, scoop out the stones with a slotted spoon, add 2.3kg sugar, stir to dissolve, boil for 10 minutes then test for the setting point.</p> <p>So keep your eyes peeled over the&#xa0;next few weeks and, if you spot&#xa0;some branches laden with purple fruit, make the most of it as soon as you can. It only takes one enthusiast with preserving ambitions to strip a tree, and much disappointment can result from thinking, \"Ooh, I'll come back for those in a couple of days...\"</p> <p>Of course, the surest way to avoid such pitfalls is to grow your own. The trees are pretty hardy and, if you have limited space, can be trained against a sunny fence or wall. Or, for faux wildness, stick them in a hedge (clear away competitive growth around the planting site first). Excellent varieties include the Farleigh damson and the Shropshire prune damson, while King and Merryweather are, when ripe, both&#xa0;sweet enough to eat raw. Even the tame ones taste pretty wild, so I&#xa0;predict you will find them impossible to resist.</p> <h2>Cheesecake with damson sauce</h2> <p>This simple, crustless cheesecake is&#xa0;such a favourite of mine that I&#xa0;sometimes eat it for breakfast. However, bathed in a glorious, rich&#xa0;damson sauce, it makes a fantastic pud. Serves eight.</p> <p><strong>600g curd cheese, cream cheese or very fresh, mild, rindless goat's cheese (preferably unsalted)</strong><br><strong>50g unsalted butter, melted and cooled slightly </strong><br><strong>2 tbsp medium oatmeal, semolina or&#xa0;wholemeal flour</strong><br><strong>100g caster sugar </strong><br><strong>2 medium eggs, lightly beaten</strong><br><strong>Grated zest of 2 small oranges</strong></p> <p>For the damson sauce<br><strong>500g damsons </strong><br><strong>125g caster sugar </strong></p> <p>To make the sauce, put the damsons&#xa0;in a pan with 200ml water. Bring to a&#xa0;simmer and cook gently, stirring regularly, for 10-15 minutes, until the fruit has collapsed and the&#xa0;stones have come free. Tip into a&#xa0;sieve and rub through with a wooden spoon to remove the stones&#xa0;and skins. Sweeten the damson pur\u00e9e by whisking in sugar to taste \u2013 how much sugar you need will depend on the tartness of the fruit and your personal taste \u2013 and leave to cool.</p> <p>Heat the oven to 170C/335F/gas mark 3 and butter a 20cm springform cake tin. Beat the cheese with a wooden spoon until smooth (if using an unsalted goat's cheese, add a pinch of salt). Add the melted butter, oatmeal, semolina or flour, sugar, eggs and orange zest, mix well, spoon into the tin and smooth the top. Bake for 25-30 minutes, until just set.</p> <p>Serve the cheesecake, cut into wedges, warm or at room temperature, with generous spoonfuls of the luscious, purple sauce ladled over the top.</p> <h2>Duck with damson sauce</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396422861\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/4/1346764132836/Roast-duck-with-damson-sa-008.jpg\" alt=\"Roast duck with damson sauce\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Roast duck with damson sauce: A neat twist on the classic Chinese dish. Photograph: Colin Campbell for the Guardian</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Colin Campbell for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>If you manage to glean only a handful of damsons, this is a terrific use for them. Serves five to six.</p> <p><strong>1 large (2.2-2.5kg) free-range duck</strong><br><strong>Sea salt and freshly ground black&#xa0;pepper</strong><br><strong>250g damsons</strong><br><strong>1 thumb-sized piece fresh ginger, peeled and roughly chopped</strong><br><strong>2 garlic cloves, peeled and finely&#xa0;sliced</strong><br><strong>1 pinch dried chilli flakes</strong><br><strong>2 tbsp soy sauce</strong><br><strong>2-3 tsp redcurrant or crab apple jelly</strong></p> <p>Heat the oven to 220C/425F/gas mark 7. If the duck is tied up, untruss it and gently pull the legs apart, away from the body \u2013 this will help the heat get to the meat. Season the duck skin well with salt and pepper. Put the bird in a roasting tin and roast for about 20 minutes, so the fat starts to run. Baste the bird with any rendered fat or juices, then cover it tightly with foil. Return to the oven and reduce the temperature to 150C/300F/gas mark 2, and cook for two to three hours, until the meat is very tender and easily comes away from the bone.</p> <p>Put the damsons in a small, ovenproof dish and roast in the oven for the last 30 minutes of the duck's cooking time, to soften them.</p> <p>Tip up the bird, pour any fat or juices out of the cavity into the roasting tin, and transfer the duck to&#xa0;a warmed plate to rest. Carefully pour off most of the fat from the roasting tin (save it in the fridge for next time you roast potatoes), leaving the brown juices in the tin.</p> <p>Set the tin over a low heat, add the&#xa0;ginger, garlic and chilli flakes, and cook, stirring, for two to three minutes. Add the soy sauce and four or five tablespoons of water, followed by the damsons, and simmer, stirring occasionally, for four to five minutes, until the fruit is tender and you can easily crush it with a wooden spoon. Now press this spicy damson compote/gravy through a sieve to remove the damson stones and skins, and the chunks of ginger and garlic. If the sauce is not thick enough for your liking, return it to a clean pan, bring to a boil and simmer for a minute or two to thicken. When it's the right consistency, whisk in the redcurrant jelly and taste \u2013 you may want to add more jelly, or another dash of soy.</p> <p>To serve, take the meat from the duck \u2013 it should be forkably tender \u2013 and divide between warmed plates. Spoon the sauce over and around the meat, and serve. Noodles and wilted pak choi are a great accompaniment.</p> <h2>Damson cheese</h2> <p>This traditional fruit \"cheese\" is a&#xa0;very thick, sliceable preserve that&#xa0;is&#xa0;immensely good served with actual cheese. It keeps for ages. Makes 850-900g.</p> <p><strong>2kg damsons</strong><br><strong>Around 750g granulated sugar</strong></p> <p>Put the damsons in a large preserving pan, add a couple of tablespoons of water and bring slowly to a simmer, stirring as the fruit begins to release its juices. Leave to simmer until completely soft. Tip the contents of the pan into a sieve and rub it through to remove the stones and skin, leaving you with a smooth damson pur\u00e9e.</p> <p>Measure the pur\u00e9e by volume. For every 500ml, add 350g sugar, and combine in a large, heavy-based pan. Bring to a simmer over a low heat, stirring to dissolve the sugar, then cook gently, stirring regularly so it doesn't catch, until reduced to a thick pur\u00e9e. It's ready when you drag the spoon across the bottom of the pan and the base stays clearly visible for a second or two. This can take up to an hour of gentle, popping simmering and stirring.</p> <p>Pour the \"cheese\" into very lightly oiled shallow plastic containers and leave to cool and set. It will keep almost indefinitely in the fridge. Serve in slices with bread and cheese, or, if you fancy, cut into cubes, dust lightly with granulated sugar and serve as a petit four.</p> <h2>Damson vodka</h2> <p>This rivals sloe gin for rich, sweet, deliciousness. Make it now for drinking next Christmas (allowing yourself a taster or two on bottling, of course). Makes around 1.5 litres.</p> <p><strong>1kg damsons, washed</strong><br><strong>500g sugar</strong><br><strong>1 litre vodka </strong></p> <p>Prick each damson several times with a pin, then transfer to a large, clean Kilner jar, demijohn or other suitable glass container with a tight-fitting lid or stopper. Add the sugar, pour in the vodka, seal and leave in a cool place away from direct sunlight. Every week or two, turn the jar on its head, then back again. After six months, strain the liquid through several layers of muslin, then bottle and seal tightly. Leave for at least another six months. It will be even better after two years \u2013 or more \u2013 provided you have the patience.</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Hugh's new book, Three Good Things, is published by Bloomsbury at \u00a325.

  "<p><strong>Marilyn</strong>, by Norman Mailer, read by Jeff Harding (10\u00bdhrs unabridged, Whole Story Audio, \u00a320.41)</p> <p>Mailer on Monroe \u2013 two American icons for the price of one (three if you include Jeff Harding, which audio connoisseurs definitely will) \u2013 this has to be the bargain biography of the year. That's 1973, of course, when it came out, not 2012, but talking book readers are used to waiting and don't complain if it's for something as good as this. Norman Mailer, double Pulitzer prizewinner and author of <em>The Naked and The Dead</em>, was the hard man of American literature. He drank, took drugs, got into fights, married six times, had nine children and loathed women's lib.</p> <p>Marilyn Monroe was, well, Marilyn Monroe, with whom Mailer is clearly bewitched, bothered, bewildered and obsessed. Forget about good biographers having to remain detached. This is the nearest you'll get to literary necrophilia. You can practically hear him panting when he launches into yet another long, voluptuous description of his subject. \"On screen she looked like a sweet peach bursting before one's eyes, a new love ready and waiting between the sheets \u2026 So curvaceous, and yet without menace as to turn one's fingertips into 10 happy prowlers. Sex was, yes, ice-cream to her. 'Take me,' said her smile, 'I'm easy, I'm happy, I'm an angel of sex, you bet.'\"</p> <p>This isn't a standard biography, and Mailer is the first to admit it. Are the facts of someone's life, always supposing you can get them, he wonders, the best way to understand what they were really like, especially with actors who live with lies as if they were truths? In other words, ignore what Marilyn said about herself, since most of the time she was making it up. What is fact is what other people said about her \u2013 Tony Curtis for instance: \"kissing Marilyn was like kissing Hitler\", or director Billy Wilder: \"after working all day with her I feel like going home and beating my wife\", or Laurence Olivier, her co-star in <em>The Prince and The Showgirl</em>: \"the experience aged me 10 years\".</p> <p>It is also a fact that she was always late, if she turned up at all. \"We're ready for you, Miss Monroe,\" came the call during the shooting of <em>Some Like it Hot</em>. \"Go fuck yourself,\" said Marilyn, deep in Thomas Paine's <em>Rights of Man</em>. She always wanted to be taken seriously. As for the much hinted at conspiracy theory about her death \u2013 suicide or murder \u2013 Mailer pulls no punches. He names the Kennedys.</p> <p><strong>Bring up the Bodies</strong>, by Hilary Mantel, read by Simon Vance (14\u00bdhours unabridged, Whole Story Audio, \u00a320.41)</p> <p>How do you follow a book as dazzling as <em>Wolf Hall</em>, part one of Mantel's trilogy that follows the career of Thomas Cromwell, Henry VIII's enigmatic secretary of state? By pulling off&#xa0;the seemingly impossible trick of making her cold, ruthless protagonist, currently bent on avenging the downfall of his former master, Cardinal Wolsey, an even more sympathetic character than he was in part one. Cromwell, son&#xa0;of a Putney butcher, plays the Tudors' favourite political conspiracy game better than any courtier, but he is also a warm, humorous, loving father. \"Sir,\" says Gregory, his son, \"they say that if the abbot of&#xa0;Glastonbury went to bed with the abbess of Shaftesbury, their offspring would be the richest landowners in England.\" \"Very likely,\" he says, \"though have you seen the abbess of Shaftesbury?\" Gregory looks worried. \"Should I have?\" Roll on part three.</p> <p><strong>Fall of Giants</strong>, by Ken Follett, read by John Lee (25hrs unabridged, Audible download, \u00a37.99)</p> <p>You read Follett for the story not the style, none better than this unlikely epic about five families \u2013 English aristos, Welsh miners, German diplomats, Russian peasants and American politicians \u2013 during the first world war. It sheds little light on human relations, but will certainly brush up your history.</p>",
  "<p>A couple of years ago, <a href=\"http://naomiwolf.org/\" title=\"\">Naomi Wolf </a>signed up to write a book about the vagina. \"I was euphoric, in creative terms \u2026 At the same time I was anxious about grappling with such a strong social taboo.\" A friend of a friend \u2013 \"an impresario whom I will call Alan\" \u2013 throws a party for her in his loft, \"a pasta party at which guests could make vagina-shaped pasta\", an idea Wolf says she finds \"funny and sort of charming\" though \"not a thematic twist I would have chosen for&#xa0;myself\".</p> <p>At the party, \"there was a slightly ominous, mischievous stir\" from the kitchen, where guests have been hard at work: \"Flowery or feathery, fluted or fanned, each small sculpture was detailed and different: lovely little white objects against a hand-painted blue Italian ceramic tray.\" \"I call those 'cuntini', says Alan, laughing.\" \"My heart contracted,\" Naomi responds. Next, she hears a sizzle. \"I got it: ha, sausages \u2026 The room had become tense.\" Then comes the salmon. \"I flushed, with a kind of despair,\" she writes, adding that the evening as a whole left her so upset, she was unable to write a word of her vagina book for the next six months. \"I felt \u2013 on both a creative and a physical level \u2013 that I had been punished for 'going somewhere' that women are not supposed to go\", she&#xa0;writes.</p> <p>\"A Rorschach with legs\" is what Natalie Angier calls the vagina in her superb <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/1999/04/05/angier/\" title=\"\"><em>Woman: An Intimate Geography</em> (1999)</a>. \"You can make of it practically anything you want, need or dread.\" And the same is true, surely, of this sorry tale. Different readers will have different cringe-points, different places in the story at which they start shouting \"Whoah!\" You may be appalled at the thought of a book called <em>Vagina</em> in the first place. How backward-looking, how attention-seeking, can a 21st-century feminist get? You may be fine with vaginas in a book title, less so as a shape of pasta \u2013 most people avoid close-up genital chit-chat in mixed culinary situations, and there are obvious reasons for the taboo. You may find the pasta in theory, as Wolf did, \"sweet\" \u2013 a quick google brings up vagina cupcakes, pink&#xa0;felt vagina knickers, a commercial&#xa0;range of tricolore pasta from Naples cut in genital shapes \u2013 but it's the c-word that upsets you, or the sausages, or the fish. Personally, I particularly disliked the \"impresario whom I will call Alan\", and the \"hand-painted blue Italian ceramic tray\": ugh boasting, ugh sentimental, ugh ugh. I'm not keen on the post-party six-month trauma either. If you're a big enough show-off to have a vagina-pasta party in the first place, I kind of feel you've abjured your right to victimmy tender-plantdom. No doubt that says as much about me and my hangups as it does about anything else.</p> <p>\"I was aware,\" Wolf reports, that when she told people about her topic, \"many people had immediate, probably measurable physical reactions.\" Some \"smiled immediately, beautiful heartfelt smiles\". Others \"looked frightened or disgusted, as if I had suddenly produced from my handbag a trout\". Neither covers my own reaction, though it was closer to <em>Monty Python</em> fish-slapping than the heartfelt-smiling thing. I admire, of course, the force-of-nature whorls in the paintings of <a href=\"http://www.georgiaokeeffe.net/\" title=\"\">Georgia O'Keeffe</a>, the magnificent <a href=\"http://www.sadiecoles.com/current-exhibitions-september.html\" title=\"\"><em>White Hole</em> by Rohan Weallaens </a>in his show with Sarah Lucas, currently showing at Sadie Coles HQ Off-Site. But <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/talk/2010/08/09/100809ta_talk_levy\" title=\"\">Judy Chicago and her <em>Dinner Party</em></a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2011/dec/31/saturday-interview-eve-ensler-vagina-monologues\" title=\"\">Eve Ensler and her <em>Vagina Monologues</em></a> \u2013 it's wretched stuff, po-faced and self-righteous, all the very worst bits of 1970s feminism rolled up in a tube.</p> <p>It's not that it isn't possible to do really excellent work with lots of vaginas in it. <a href=\"http://topics.nytimes.com/topics/reference/timestopics/people/a/natalie_angier/index.html\" title=\"\">Angier</a>'s survey, for example, is the book I'd give free to every schoolgirl if I was Michael Gove. Catherine Blackledge's much-overlooked <a href=\"http://www.lrb.co.uk/v25/n22/jenny-diski/its-so-beautiful\" title=\"\"><em>The Story of V</em> (2003)</a> is lucid and thorough, and has some amazing illustrations. On the vagina as symbolic object, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2007/oct/20/society1\" title=\"\"><em>The Female Thing </em>by Laura Kipnis </a>(2006) is a sharp, funny, leftwing, Freudian essay about the many ways in which \"having one of these things instead of one of the other things \u2026 invariably structures the female experience here on earth\". Most recently, Florence Williams writes in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/jul/13/breasts-florence-williams-review\" title=\"\"><em>Breasts: A Natural and Unnatural History</em></a> (Norton, 2012) about how the life of organs commonly thought of as private is always socially and environmentally conditioned, by the fantasies in the ether around them, by the chemicals they absorb.</p> <p>Wolf's book, however, is something else again. Yes, it does a bit of science, and a bit of cultural history too. But mostly, it doesn't need to, because Wolf has found a magic key. \"The vagina and the brain,\" Wolf has discovered, are \"essentially one network, or 'one whole system'\", though at the moment, not a lot of people know this, apart from \"scientists at the most advanced laboratories and clinics around the world\". Taken together, this \"profound brain-vagina connection\" forms \"a gateway to, and medium of, female self-knowledge and consciousness\", mediating \"creativity and transcendence\". You thought Angier was laying it on a bit when she poeticised the vagina as \"a pause between the declarative sentence of the outside world and the mutterings of the viscera\"? Well, for Wolf it channels \"a sensibility that feels very much like freedom\". Or if that's too much to deal with, just look on it as \"essentially part of the female soul\".</p> <p>This discovery, Wolf writes, \"started as a historical and cultural journey, but quickly became 'personal and necessary'\". In 2009, she says, when she was 46, her life was outwardly great (aren't they always in this sort of story) \u2013 \"emotionally and sexually happy, intellectually excited, and newly in love\". And yet \u2013 as is the convention \u2013 \"something was becoming terribly wrong\". In her 40s, she explains, Wolf had felt her experience of orgasm deepen and become enriched, leading her to \"see colours as if they were brighter\" and \"the connections between things\" more distinctly. In 2009, though, \"this was changing. I was \u2026 losing sensation <em>inside</em> my body.\" Worse, her sense of the \"poetic dimension\" was disappearing too. \"Things seemed discrete and unrelated to me \u2026 and colours were just colours.\" She gets depressed and then despairing: \"It was like a horror movie, as the light and sparkle of the world dialled downward and downward.\"</p> <p>It turns out that Wolf has trapped a nerve in her lower back, between the lumbar region and the sacrum. Normally, this \"pelvic nerve\" carries messages between the brain and the clitoris, cervix and vagina, but in Wolf's case, because of the neural damage, the messages from the vagina were cut off. And yet, she still orgasms from her clitoris, no problem. \"Every woman is wired differently,\" her specialist explains. \"Some women's nerves branch more in the vagina; other women's nerves branch more in the clitoris \u2026 That accounts for some of the differences in female sexual response.\" \"I almost fell off the exam table in astonishment,\" writes the author. \"<em>That's</em> what explained vaginal versus clitoral orgasms? \u2026 Not culture, not upbringing, not patriarchy, not feminism, not&#xa0;Freud?\"</p> <p>Once she has picked herself up again, Wolf organises her argument round two main strands. Science, she discovers, has been making lots of progress in understanding the physiology of female sexuality, but nobody tells us about it. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/sep/02/naomi-wolf-women-orgasm-neural-wiring?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">\"Why didn't they tell us in eighth grade? \u2026 It's changed my whole sense of how we're put together,\" as she said to Emma Brockes in the Guardian this week</a>. But also, this vagina-brain connection has an emotional, even spiritual dimension \u2013 \"a 'hole'\" that is \"Goddess-shaped\", no less. She gets surgery to put her back right, and finds her full-spectrum orgasms restored, and with them, the mystical intimations. \"The moving grasses, the sweeping tree branches, the birds calling from invisible locations in the dappled shadows \u2026 I thought: it is back.\"</p> <p>The first part of the book is called \"Does the Vagina Have a Consciousness?\" Wolf's evidence includes neuroanatomy \u2013 \"your dreamy autonomic nervous system, or what scientists call the ANS\" and neurochemistry \u2013 \"the dopamine, oxytocin and opioids released by (the) orgasm, which in turn affect (the) brain\". The take-home is basically that just as sensation runs from pelvis to brain, so it runs the other way as well, meaning that \"<em>gestures, touches, kisses and words aren't extras</em>. They are integral parts of the activation of the female ANS.\" In other words, Wolf thinks that the sort of sexual pleasure the modern woman is encouraged to seek is far too wham-bam to release women from what she sees as a widespread \"existential depression\", an \"An Epidemic of Female Sexual Unhappiness\".</p> <p>Much of this \"sexual suffering\" Wolf thinks has been systemically imposed on women, across the world and down the centuries: rape and genital mutilation, military, judicial and ritual. \"If you are to subdue and suppress women, and in such a way that they come to do it to themselves \u2026. <em>you must target the vagina</em>.\" There's also an interesting bit on the threat posed to the \"happy heterosexual vagina\" by internet pornography. The evidence isn't entirely there yet, but Wolf's argument that heavy porn use seems to follow an addictive pattern, desensitising users to images of violence and causing them to lose interest in affectionate sex with a partner whose name they know, seems increasingly plausible. Though I'm not sure about the impresario-I-will-call-Alan foodie spin: \"The mass-produced, fast-forward, pornographic vagina is to the real vagina what highly processed or GMO food is to slow or organic food.\"</p> <p>More surprisingly, she also blames \"second-wave feminism\", ie, the work of the early-1970s Women's Liberation Movement. In <a href=\"http://www.uic.edu/orgs/cwluherstory/CWLUArchive/vaginalmyth.html\" title=\"\"><em>The Myth of the Vaginal Orgasm</em> (1970)</a>, she says, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anne_Koedt\" title=\"\">Anne Koedt</a> argued that \"Freud's elevation of the vagina over the clitoris\" was a \"patriarchal plot\" in order that women be \"brainwashed into dependency on men\". An understandable move, Wolf thinks, but overstated, and with unfortunate consequences: \"From the 1970s on, the vagina was recast as rather retro, housewifey and pass\u00e9\", whereas the clitoris was \"a glamorous, mini-skirt-wearing Gloria&#xa0;Steinem\".</p> <p>But mainly her target seems to be ordinarily lazy boyfs and hubbies, who, she thinks, have to try much harder when appeasing the \"entirely different model of female sexuality\" she dubs \"the Goddess Array\". The quest takes her deep into the erotic texts of the Tantric, Tao and Islamic traditions. It takes her to a shabby hotel in Midtown Manhattan for a weekend workshop in \"sacred-spot massage\" run by \"the surreally juicy\" <a href=\"http://carolinemuir.com/\" title=\"\">Caroline Muir </a>(\"While all of the women were conventionally attractive, many of the men were not at all\"). It takes her to Chalk Farm in north London to visit <a href=\"http://www.mikelousada.com/\" title=\"\">Mike Lousada</a>, \"the world's nicest former investment banker turned male sexual healer\", famous for having once stared at \"the yoni\" for so long, he saw an image of the Virgin Mary in it. If you want your own \"sacred spot\" expertly rubbed by Muir, Wolf tells us, the hourly rate is $250. Lousada, by contrast, charges only \u00a3100.</p> <p>\u2766</p> <p>I read this book in utter bafflement. What is this big news that Wolf has to impart? Vaginas feel stuff, so yes, of course they must be packed with nerves; and nerves, we know, join up with each other at the spine to link into the brain. That's why they call it the central nervous system; that's what being human<strong> </strong>is all about. Feet, too, join up with the CNS \u2013 thus reflexologists, and why bunions are so painful. And so do the intestines, giving rise to the extremely interesting <a href=\"http://www.emory.edu/EMORY_REPORT/stories/2011/02/people_profile_elizabeth_wilson_scientist_feminist.html\" title=\"\">\"Gut Feminism\" of Elizabeth A Wilson</a> at Emory University in Atlanta \u2013 digestive organs as \"psychically alive\", \"the enteric character\" of mood, \"how biology can be an ally for those of us building models of mind-body that tax the limits of Cartesian dualism\". In other words, the closer you look at attempts to argue that mind and body are <em>not</em> completely wrapped up in each other, the more you will see all sorts of connections, biological and symbolic and liminally teetering in between. \"Having a body punctured by so many openings and canals,\" Kipnis writes, \"blurs the distinction between inside and outside, self and world. The apertures invariably take on emotional resonance \u2026 She's so 'open'. He's a real 'tightass'.\" And of course the c-word, in all its abject force.</p> <p>At the beginning of her <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/sep/02/vagina-a-new-biography-naomi-wolf?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\"><em>Vagina</em> book, Wolf</a> says that her theory of \"biological consciousness\" comes in part from William James's mighty <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Varieties_of_Religious_Experience\" title=\"\"><em>The Variety of Religious Experience</em></a> (1902) \u2013 \"the issue of neurology as a substratum for these common mystical experiences\", ie, that particular brain-states may give people a feeling that they are, for a moment, in touch with God. After that, though, she doesn't mention James again. Which is a pity, because one great thing about the James book is the way he doesn't pooh-pooh these passing feelings, while also recognising that any individual attempt to \"locate\" them can only end in idiotic hubris: \"We must frankly recognise the fact that we live in partial systems and that parts are not interchangeable in the spiritual life.\" Those selfish genes with their shoulder-pads, grabbing evolutionary advantages for the alpha males; dopamine and oxytocin, gambolling like SpongeBob SquarePants round the reptile brain; the stories told by the popular-science writers can only ever just be stories, partial facts filled out with cartoonishly consoling fictions.</p> <p>So yes, body and mind are completely part and parcel. But no, this doesn't mean the connections are easy to conceptualise: neither goddesses nor Numskulls nor ghosts in the machine. Remember Wolf's \"astonishment\" when her doctor told her that every woman's pelvic wiring is slightly different? She should be more than astonished, I feel. She should be daunted and delighted at the great polymorphous cloud ahead of her, every individual equal and yet completely different \u2013 vagina and/or clitoris and/or all of these or none; fingers and/or penises and/or hair dryers and/or veg. But Wolf does not want to think about such glories. \"One of my primary themes is the exploration of heterosexual women's physical and emotional interactions with men \u2026 Not because I think that lesbian and bisexual arousal, orgasm, relationships or mind-body connections are any less fascinating,\" but because women are \"so complex and so worthy of careful, individualistic attention that I do not believe that the politically correct approach of lumping all female experience together \u2026 can do justice to the variations of female sexualities and their emotional counterparts.\" Lesbians, anuses and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betty_Dodson\" title=\"\">Betty Dodson </a>do at least get passing mentions. Asexuality, blowjobs, sexual fantasy, do not figure at all.</p> <p>The pulsing cloud becomes particularly shrunken in the neurochemistry chapter. \"People differ from one another at every juncture of the dopamine matrix,\" Angier wrote of \"today's It-neurotransmitter\" a few years ago in the New York Times. \"In the tonal background pace at which their dopamine neurons rhythmically fire, the avidity with which the cells spike in response to need or news \u2026\" For Wolf, on the other hand, dopamine is simply \"the ultimate feminist chemical in the female brain\". Whereas serotonin emerges as a baddie, particularly in its most famous role as the brain-chemical boosted by popular SSRI anti-depressants such as Prozac. \"Women far outnumber men in being prescribed SSRIs. Are these same millions \u2026 warned that SSRIs may well send their libido and ability to experience orgasm plummeting?\" (\"Low sex drive\", I read at second place on the \"Common Side Effects\" page on the NHS Choices website. Wolf may be appalled that many women seem resigned to sexual self-bludgeoning in exchange for the basic ability to keep going, but a lot of evidence suggests they do.) Oxytocin, best known for its part in stimulating childbirth and lactation, she dubs \"the cuddle hormone\" and \"women's emotional superpower\". Top advice for women who \"want to have hot anonymous sex with some guy \u2026 but don't want to fall in love with him \u2026 discourage him from interacting with their nipples.\" Because if he does get his hands on your boobies, you'll have to marry him, obvs!</p> <p>The stuff about rape and sexual violence is just strange. Wolf's main argument \u2013 that rape is at least half-consciously a subordinating tactic deployed by men \u2013 has been feminist orthodoxy since 1975, when Susan Brownmiller published her canonical<a href=\"http://www.susanbrownmiller.com/susanbrownmiller/html/against_our_will.html\" title=\"\"> <em>Against Our Will: Men and Women and Rape</em></a>: \"From prehistoric times to the present, I believe, rape has played a critical function. It is nothing more or less than a conscious process of intimidation by which <em>all</em> men keep <em>all</em> women in a state of fear.\" And yet, Wolf says that Brownmiller, like others of her generation, writes about rape while following an \"individualised reading of sexuality posited by Freud\", which is surely just not so. Wolf's take on classic women's liberation in general is perverse. Koedt, it's true, did mistakenly write that \"the vagina is not a highly sensitive area\" in her legendary paper. But her main thrust was to open, not close, sexual possibility for women; besides which, other feminists just went as fancy took them. Germaine Greer in 1971, for example: \"To develop the muscles of the pubococcygeal region, think of something nice and contract the buttocks rhythmically \u2026 You might even succeed in making the whole pelvis awake to love and beauty.\"</p> <p>As for this \"gendered sense of self that is shining, without damage, without anxiety or fear\", this \"radiant part of the universal feminine\" that is activated by obeisance to the \"Goddess Array\" \u2026 What if you're a woman who practises forms of sex that bypass the vaginal? What if you were born without a vagina, or with two vaginas, or have a female-looking vulva, but are intersex inside? What if you are biologically and culturally female, but want to smirk or vomit at the very thought of a \"Goddess\" anywhere near you? What happens to \"the universal feminine\" then?</p> <p>Naomi Wolf, presumably, is like many of us, a middle-aged woman who has been thinking a lot about spiritual matters, as middle-aged women often do. Her body has been changing \u2013 which also happens \u2013 and in her case, she's also had that miserable injury, which yes, I can see would make you look at your sexuality anew. But it takes a particular way of looking at things to extrapolate from that to the shining Goddess. Wolf, this book tells us, has also been looking at images of sexual awakening in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/jun/25/poem-week-goblin-market-rossetti\" title=\"\">Christina Rossetti </a>and <a href=\"http://www.katechopin.org/\" title=\"\">Kate Chopin</a>, because she has recently gone \"back to graduate school\". And discussing orgasmic rats with \"a group of brilliant young women\" at \"a cottage on an old farm\". Chatting with Mike Lousada for \"a London newspaper\". And visiting, in 2004, a refugee centre for women raped during the civil war in Sierra Leone. All evidence, one way or another, for this spiritual-emotional-neurological network. All of it really just connected by the life, the interests and the ego of Naomi Wolf herself.</p> <p>\u2766</p> <p>Back in 1990, I remember watching the young Wolf on television, with a panel of older feminist writers, discussing her first book, the bestselling <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2001/sep/01/society2\" title=\"\"><em>The Beauty Myth</em> (1990)</a>. These older feminists \u2013 I can't remember who any of them were \u2013 were being just horrible. Their gist was that Wolf, being 28 and good-looking and well groomed, had no right to speak out about any \"beauty myth\", or to call herself a feminist at all. Awful, I remember thinking, but also interesting \u2013 the way older women so often hate letting the younger ones have their turn. I wrote an article about it for a long-dead magazine called City Limits, which was where I was working, in my first London job.</p> <p>And I guess that must be why I have a fuzzy memory of an evening shortly after, when Wolf came for tea to my Brixton house-share, together with my friend and then City Limits colleague, now Guardian columnist <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/deborah-orr\" title=\"\">Deborah Orr</a>. It was a nice evening, I remember; I made a huge spanakopita and Wolf was lovely. Only then, Deborah or I said something mildly critical of some point or another, and Wolf fought back. The forcefulness, the mental agility, the lack of embarrassment! The sense of entitlement and mission, the self-belief! It was quite an insight into what it takes to be a celebrity feminist. I immediately saw that I would never cut it. And so, more than 20 years later, I'm still bodging my spanakopitas in south-east London while Wolf has long been a figure of world renown.</p> <p>After <em>The Beauty Myth</em>, Wolf wrote a sort of sequel to it, <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/assessment/1999/11/naomi_wolf.html\" title=\"\"><em>Fire With Fire</em></a> \u2013 her own attempt to work out why feminists so often seem to hate each other and what to do about it. The decade subsequent, she published three memoir-based personal-is-political numbers, <em>Promiscuities</em> \u2013 herself and her friends as teenagers; <em>Misconceptions</em> \u2013 as young mothers; <em>The Tree House </em>\u2013 as burnt-out middle-agers, a condition Wolf remedied by doing up her country house with the help of her old dad. Throughout, I watched her from a distance, observing how tough the job of celebrity feminist can be: you have to keep publishing and opining, no matter whether you have much you really want to say. You have to present your ideas to public scrutiny even if they're still half-baked. A single wobble, and the media will leap \u2013 do a google, for example, on Naomi Wolf-Katy Perry. Naomi Wolf-abortion-New Republic. Naomi Woolf-Al Gore-consultant. Naomi Wolf-New York magazine-Harold Bloom. Naomi Wolf-rape-Julian Assange. Then after <em>The Tree House</em>, Wolf suddenly moved sideways, with two plain, useful books on civil liberties and the right to protest in the age of George W Bush. Neither <a href=\"http://www.democracynow.org/2007/11/28/the_end_of_america_feminist_social\" title=\"\"><em>The End of America</em> (2007) </a>nor <a href=\"http://naomiwolf.org/2008/09/give-me-liberty-a-handbook-for-american-revolutionaries/\" title=\"\"><em>Give Me Freedom</em> (2008)</a> was published in this country, but readers will have heard about them when <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2011/nov/25/shocking-truth-about-crackdown-occupy\" title=\"\">Wolf was arrested \u2013 in her evening clothes \u2013 at an Occupy! demonstration in New York City last year</a>. (Good-oh, I remember thinking when I saw it. Now, though, I catch myself checking dates and wondering about the state of her pelvic nerve.)</p> <p>Between jobs, I guess Wolf has never stopped trying to think big thoughts about women and politics and feminism. How some things change and others don't. How the same things need to be said afresh for every generation, and how hard it is to bear this, as you yourself get older and feel you've heard it all before. How much you'd like to warn the youngsters, except that all they hear when you try it is their utter conviction that they themselves will never end up like you. Exhaustion, irritation, frustration at all these goldfish-brain debatelets, repeating themselves, round and round. In a world with Jessie J and Jamie Clayton in it, Caster Semenya and the work of Judith Butler, why are we still letting one of the Anglophone world's most famous feminists waste everyone's time with all this burble about the \"universal feminine\" with its \"Goddess-shaped\" hole?</p> <p>Funnily enough, it was on this very topic that Laura Kipnis's vagina book began. \"Female progress \u2013 how's that going? Let's see. Gender barriers have largely crumbled (some exceptions remain), the dominant paradigms of patriarchy have mainly eroded (some exceptions remain), women have increasing economic dependence from men if they choose to (though many don't). But then you keep stumbling across the tracks of a certain \u2026 <em>ambivalence</em>. No, not the backlash against feminism \u2013 I mean the ambivalence among women themselves.\" For Kipnis, the big problem with feminism \u2013 an open, bold, modern movement, aimed at getting power for women, fair and square \u2013 is that it gets confused with femininity, an ancient, occult body of lore women use to trick men into looking after them; and few of even the most famous feminists have entirely clarified the difference. Or as Kipnis puts it: \"Feminism ('don't call me honey, dickhead') and femininity ('I just found the world's best push-up bra!') are in a big catfight, nowhere more than within each individual female psyche.\"</p> <p>Kipnis would probably see in Wolf's book just another iteration of the basic problem. The main reason for the current \"epidemic of sexual sorrow\" is not so much that \"the vagina is being disrespected\", but that women who should know better underestimate the complexity of Kipnis's \"female thing\" \u2013 \"the female psyche of course\", as Kipnis puts it, the experience of living with \"this small furry thing\" in a world that doles out privilege according to anatomy at birth. So yes, nobody disagrees that women are, on the whole, sad and rancorous, and that the problem amounts to what Wolf calls an \"existential depression\". If not the yoni, under the Tantric management of Mike Lousada, what other wisdoms are there to save us now?</p> <p>\"I had to say The Force,\" Wolf told the Sunday Times, when they asked for her favourite word for the vagina. And maybe it was that, or maybe it was the bit in Kipnis about the \"small furry thing\", but the vision that came to me at this point was the <em>Star Wars</em> poster on the wall of my son's bedroom, a picture of Yoda with a book tucked under his arm. \"Read and The Force is with you,\" it says; it's an ad from the American Library Association. And also a reminder \u2013 not for the first time \u2013 that in the struggle for good sex over all the evils of the universe, the most potent and far-reaching weapons are not vaginas or any other bodily organs, but research, ideas, thinking \u2013 not yonis or even \"the Goddess\", but carefully weighed and thought-through words.</p>",
  "<p>I'm at Duke House, a rare boutique B&amp;B in the heart of Cambridge, and the owners, the irrepressible Liz and Rob Cameron, are about to take me on a bat safari. They've only been running the B&amp;B since Easter. Liz used to be a teacher: \"But I didn't feel committed and was crap at it,\" so they decided to open their home to strangers instead. They're clearly doing a good job as they're already listed in the top three B&amp;Bs in Cambridge. \"We're on the podium,\" says Rob, with a grin.</p> <p>They're great company and I'm looking forward to our evening out. We're going up the river Cam on Behemoth punts, grander than average, and shall be striking away from the city towards the village of Grantchester. Our punter is Saad Tahir: he's a second year economics student and his slight frame has me wondering whether he's going to manage to shove the Behemoth anywhere, let alone to Grantchester. \"I fell in on my test day,\" he tells me, hands clasped politely behind his back. \"But it was very windy, and raining.\"</p> <p>I stare at him.</p> <p>\"I didn't fall in on the re-test though,\" he adds, quickly.</p> <p>As dusk is drawing in, Saad shoves us off. It's a fine evening but blankets and umbrellas are provided in case it turns chilly or wet, and we're each handed a bat detector. It's a bit like an old-fashioned handheld transistor radio that converts sonar signals into audible frequencies.</p> <p>Different species of bat operate at varying frequencies and a trained ear is able to distinguish each bat's call. There's no hope of me being able to do this but, thankfully, we have a member of the <a href=\"http://www.wildlifetrusts.org/\" title=\"\">Wildlife Trusts</a> on board who is able to do all the explaining.</p> <p>\"Bats,\" Deborah Marchant, our expert guide, tell us, \"are vital to the ecosystem. They control crop pests, they pollinate flowers and they drop fruit seeds. If you've ever used balsa wood or chewed gum or drunk tequila,\" she adds, \"then you can thank bats. If you've got drunk on tequila, that's your own fault.\"</p> <p>Turns out it's the <a href=\"http://www.yearofthebat.org/\" title=\"\">International Year of the Bat</a> and this safari is part of a drive to raise awareness of a much maligned, misunderstood and often persecuted small mammal. It's news to nobody that bats have a terrible reputation. We have Bram Stoker to thank for that, along with their endless association with witches and other murky things of the night but the truth of the matter is, all bats in the UK are interested in is eating vast quantities of insects.</p> <p>\"They need to consume 3,000 insects a night just to stay alive,\" Deborah tells us. \"This summer has been terrible for them. It's not been warm enough to generate enough insects. We've had a lot of dehydrated, exhausted bats. You often find them on the floor. They're disorientated. If you find one, you can call the <a href=\"http://www.bats.org.uk/pages/batcare.html\" title=\"\">Bat Conservation Trust</a>. They'll come and save them.\"</p> <p>Suddenly, there's a loud chatter on Rob's bat sensor. It's a rapid clicking noise and we all crane round to see a fast-darting black smudge sweep across our field of vision. \"That's a Daubenton,\" Deborah tells us. \"They can live for 22 years.\"</p> <p>As it gets darker and the water below us turns the colour of treacle, our bat sensors come alive. Deborah leans forward and shines a torch out across the water and as she does so, the river surface becomes animated with thousands of flying insects. It's wonderfully gothic: gnarled branches of low hanging trees dripping over the shore line, bats diving all around and the single&#xa0;beam of light stretching off into the darkness.</p> <p>\"This is how horror films start,\" I&#xa0;mumble to Rob as we silently glide past dense undergrowth. \"I keep expecting a face to suddenly appear.

  "<p>I like Hull. That's why I set my books there. I may have plans to kill off half the fictional population, but that's because it's such a fascinating and colourful place. Admittedly, most of the colours are a bit mucky, but for a port city that got battered by the Luftwaffe and then lost its main source of income when the fishing industry went under, it has got a sense of self and a talent for survival that remains both touching and admirable.</p> <p>Hull is indeed painted as bleak and forbidding in my debut novel, The Dark Winter. I've lived in and around the city for 12 years. It's not the prettiest of places, and the wind that tumbles in from the sea can eat through to your bones, turning the citizens into gargoyles as they wince into the gales. But I'm a writer of fiction, a miserable git. And I don't work for the bloody tourism office.</p> <p>Even so, on the day I visit as a tourist, it's a bright day, and the sky is cornflour blue. To see Hull the way a first-time visitor would is a curious thing. And it seems the number of these first-time visitors is on the rise. Subtly, Hull has become a destination of choice for people keen to experience a Yorkshire beyond Last of the Summer Wine and brass bands.</p> <p>A big attraction is the new Larkin Trail (<a href=\"http://www.thelarkintrail.co.uk/\" title=\"\">thelarkintrail.co.uk</a>), a walk around 25 locations, marked by wall plaques, in the footsteps of the poet, known in Hull as a grumpy bugger who looked like Eric Morecambe. Larkin was, of course, one of the most celebrated poets of the 20th century, his career beginning in 1945 and spanning 40 years. He won the Queen's Gold Medal for poetry, declined the job of Poet Laureate, and was celebrated for his \"piquant mixture of lyricism and discontent\". He was named by <a href=\"http://www.listsofbests.com/list/93594-the-times-50-greatest-british-writers-since-1945\" title=\"\">the Times in 2008 as Britain's greatest post-war writer</a>, but was also librarian at Hull University from 1955 until his death 30 years later.</p> <p>It would be interesting to know what Larkin would make of Hull today. In my debut novel (and to the displeasure of many) I called it \"a city on its arse\", and anybody driving down once-proud Beverley Road would be hard-pushed to disagree, unless they are particular fans of chipboard or steel shutters.</p> <p>Still, close one eye, and the trip to Hull is worth it. I begin my journey at his statue, in Paragon Station. The memorial, cast in bronze, is a warts-and-all likeness of the great man, looking a little stressed, hurrying to catch a train in what looks like more than a gentle breeze. Nobody else is stopping to look at it; they probably think it's Eric Morecambe. On the plinth is engraved: \"That Whitsun, I was late getting away,\" from his famed poem The Whitsun Weddings.</p> <p>I head out of the station, with the new shopping centre, St Stephen's, to my back and the bustle of Ferensway in front of me. Nobody could call Hull a ghost town on this evidence. It's packed with shoppers and office workers. I turn right and duck into the Mercure Hull Royal Hotel, referenced in Larkin's Friday Night at the Royal Station Hotel as a place where \"silence laid like carpet\".</p> <p>That's not the case today, and I enjoy my pint in the mahogany-panelled open space, quickly finding the framed photograph of Larkin with fellow poet John Betjeman, taken in 1973 at Hull City Hall \u2013 my next stop. Another customer tells me that 30 years ago there was a fire here, and the manager arranged for the boss of Marks and Spencer to open up in the middle of the night so his shivering patrons, who had fled the flames and left their clothes behind, could get themselves something nice on the company's account. I hope this is true.</p> <p>Leaving the bar, I walk to nearby Queen Victoria Square and City Hall. I make my way to Whitefriargate and from here towards the Old Town where, in other cities, artsy shops would no doubt have sprung up, flogging oddments and curiosities. But the sort of people who buy oddments and curiosities don't really live in Hull. Locals come into town to pop to Primark for some leggings or to get their bairns some new school shoes. Still, halfway up is Marks &amp; Spencer, which Larkin immortalised in The Large Cool Store. He wrote of \"cheap clothes/Set out in simple sizes plainly\". A plaque by the lift bears lines from the poem.</p> <p>Trinity Square is a wide, quiet piazza over which looms majestic Holy Trinity Church. Here stands a statue of Hull's other famous poet, Andrew Marvell (1621-78), after whom Marvell Press, which first published Larkin's poetry, was named. In a shop window, another Larkin Trail plaque quotes the poet's foreword to an anthology of local poetry: \"For Hull has its own sudden elegancies.\"</p> <p>The trail gets less elegant after that. The A63 is congested and noisy and bars the way to the marina, with its pleasure crafts and the beautifully regenerated old Fruit Market. This was once Hull Corporation Pier, from which, in pre-Humber Bridge days, you could catch a ferry across the river. People are taking photographs of The Deep, the multimillion-pound submarium which has been a hit since it opened a decade back. All glass and blue panels, it sits on Sammy's Point, where the river Hull flows into the Humber, like the prow of a ship.</p> <p>Back in the Old Town, the street splendidly named Land of Green Ginger was the cornerstone of Hull's drinking scene, and Larkin enjoyed many an evening in the atmospheric George Hotel, Ye Olde Black Boy (<a href=\"http://yeoldeblackboy.weebly.com/\" title=\"\">yeoldeblackboy.weebly.com</a>) and Ye Olde White Hart (<a href=\"http://www.yeoldewhiteharte.com/\" title=\"\">yeoldewhiteharte.com</a>). This last one is worth popping into, if only to hear locals tell of its plotting parlour, where the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_Hull_%281642%29\" title=\"\">city's leaders decided not to open the gates to the King during the civil war</a>, and to look at the bones and skulls found in the walls and mysterious, darkened back rooms over the years.</p> <p>The last stop in the core of the city is Hull History Centre on Worship Street (<a href=\"http://www.hullhistorycentre.org.uk/\" title=\"\">hullhistorycentre.org.uk</a>), with its archive of Larkin's workbooks, letters, postcards, tapes and photographs.</p> <p>I get a taxi to the next stop, a mile away, at 32 Pearson Park, where Larkin lived from 1956 to 1974. From his attic flat the poet had a clear view of the 22-acre Victorian park and its visitors, immortalised in the bleak poem Toads Revisited, with its \"Palsied old step-takers, hare-eyed clerks.\" There's not much of that today, but there are lots of people playing football, and I'm reliably informed that the weekly Saturday kickabout here has helped solve some of the problems that blew up when a wave of asylum seekers arrived in the city a decade ago.</p> <p>The Larkin Trail has its gloomy side, with Spring Bank cemetery (\"The most beautiful spot in Hull,\" Larkin apparently told Betjeman) and two hospitals. Neither could be called attractions but they were important to him. His poem The Building is about Hull Royal Infirmary, whose \"lucent comb shows up for miles\", and he died at a former private hospital near to Pearson Park. The trail ends, like Larkin did, at the cemetery in nearby Cottingham, where he is buried. The headstone simply calls him \"writer\". I think he'd have liked that more than the brass statue. He was never much of a publicity fan, and those with long memories say he was never the most cheerful of souls. But he's bringing people to Hull, and that can only be a good thing.</p> <p>But there's more to the city than Larkin. Hull's museums are all worth a visit (<a href=\"http://www.hullcc.gov.uk\" title=\"\">hullcc.gov.uk</a>). The unimaginatively titled Hull and East Riding Museum (26 High Street) covers the area's archaeology and geology. My daughter calls it \"the one with the mammoth\", as it's hard to miss the colossal hairy beast in the doorway. Up the road (no 26) the Streetlife Museum brings more than 200 years of transport to life. I felt a bit of a prat sitting in the old-fashioned carriage listening to piped-in clip-clop, but if I'd had the kids with me, it would have been a blast . I've never visited without hearing kids tell their parents \"this is ace\".</p> <p>In Queen Victoria Square is the Maritime Museum. Its darkened glass windows mean that from inside it always looks stormy outside, but that just gives you more reason to stay. Follow Hull's rich association with the sea \u2013 its docklands and the evolution of trawling \u2013 and inspect ornately carved whalebones and fearsome harpoons.</p> <p>I finish my Larkin tour on studenty Newland Avenue (number 16 on the trail) at Larkin's Bar. It doesn't shout about the poet, but its logo is a toad (Larkin's metaphor for work). The man himself never drank here, of course \u2013 it's been open only a couple of years \u2013 but he is known to have shrugged off his ill-humour over nights of drinking in several pubs close by. I'm not feeling grumpy at all after my Larkin day, but I'll raise another pint to him anyway.</p> <p><em>\u2022 Stay at the Mercure Hull Royal (01482 325087, </em><a href=\"http://www.hotels-hull.co.uk\" title=\"\"><em>hotels-hull.co.uk</em></a><em>, doubles from \u00a365) next to the station, or The Old Grey Mare (01482 448193, </em><a href=\"http://www.goodnightinns.co.uk/book-a-hotel/old-grey-mare/\" title=\"\"><em>goodnightinns.co.uk</em></a><em>, doubles from \u00a342) opposite the university, with views of the library.

  "<p>We've flown into Kuala Lumpur with the intention of going <em>jalan-jalan</em>, or on the road to the Malays. I lived in KL, as everyone calls this crazy metropolis, for five years, and it is still like a second home. But this time there is no hanging around, as my wife and I are setting out towards the northern border with Thailand, through the heartland of the Malay peninsula.</p> <p>This part of the country is often overlooked by tourists, who prefer the golden beaches of the east coast or paradise islands such as Tioman or Langkawi. Our final destination will be Penang, an island my Malaysian friends tell me has suddenly become one of south-east Asia's hottest destinations.</p> <p>KL is the modern face of Malaysia, a skyscraper city of the future, where Blade Runner meets Bollywood. There are few reminders of the complex history of a country that declared independence from Britain only 55 years ago. Driving out of the centre we soon find ourselves lost in a sprawling urban mass as intimidating as Los Angeles, and it is only with a little luck that we reach the busy north-south highway.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395818423\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Late_offers/pictures/2012/9/5/1346846141519/Kuala-Lumpur-station-001.jpg\" alt=\"Kuala Lumpur station\" width=\"460\" height=\"277\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kuala Lumpur station</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The road is surrounded on both sides by rolling hills, marked by geometric lines of palm oil and rubber plantations. The scene resembles an Escher drawing, and there is little trace of the dense rainforest that once covered most of Malaysia. After we've been going an hour, the landscape changes suddenly and dramatically, with massive limestone outcrops leaping hundreds of craggy feet out of the flat plains. Up on a hill, a giant but rather tatty billboard announces that we have arrived at Ipoh \u2013 City of Millionaires, and our first stop-off.</p> <p>Soon we are sitting in the legendary Sinhalese Bar, the sole Sri Lankan bar in Malaysia, whose decor is unchanged since it opened in 1931. I'm sipping a Tiger beer in an iced glass so cold it almost takes the skin off my fingers, and talking to our guide for the next few days, Hong Law Siak, who runs the local heritage association.</p> <p>\"People tend to forget that the modern, developed Malaysia owes its existence to the riches generated by tin and rubber,\" Hong says. \"And in those days Ipoh was as important as Singapore and Kuala Lumpur.\"</p> <p>But when the bottom dropped out of the tin market in the 1980s, Ipoh missed out on all the development that so radically altered the face of KL.</p> <p>\"So instead of glitzy, high-rise office blocks and space-age shopping malls, Ipoh has remained pretty much unchanged from the pioneer era. The traditional Chinese shop-houses have been left intact, as have grand colonial landmarks like the Anglo-Moorish railway station, known here as the Taj Mahal of Ipoh.\"</p> <p>We leave the bar and wander along the street. Hong points out ornate Chinese clan houses, an abandoned photographer's studio with 1960s black and white prints in the window and a Madras textile shop, where the aged assistants still wear dhotis, scribble sales into a dusty, giant ledger, and an ancient poster on the wall proclaims that their checked sarongs were once Made in British India.</p> <p>We disappear down the narrow Panglima Lane \u2013 known as Concubine Lane when it was lined with gambling and opium dens, brothels and the discreet residences of the many concubines kept by rich Chinese tin tycoons. I'm not surprised when Hong tells me that Ipoh was used as a backdrop for the French film <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0104507/\" title=\"\">Indochine</a>, starring Catherine Deneuve, about the final days of French colonial rule.</p> <p>Discovering the eclectic cuisine of Malaysia is always one of the most exciting parts of travelling here, and Ipoh is no exception. Hawker stalls around Pasar Besar, the teeming wet market, specialise in <em>kway teow</em> \u2013 wok-fried rice noodles with egg, prawns and juicy cockles \u2013 pork satay, paper-thin <em>poh piah</em> spring rolls stuffed with bean sprouts, and claypot chicken. Indian restaurants offer a dozen different curries around a mountain of rice on a banana leaf. But the best meal we eat here is Malay <em>nasi kandar</em>, a self-service feast of at least 40 dishes, where a plate heaped with delicious okra and bitter gourd, spicy beef <em>rendang</em>, squid and fish curry costs less than two pounds.</p> <p>The next day, Hong turns up in his car to drive us around the surrounding Kinta valley, where there used to be 1,000 tin mines. These are now deep, manmade lakes. Today, virtually none of the mines is still functioning: there is still tin beneath the ground, but extracting it is too expensive.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395818424\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Late_offers/pictures/2012/9/5/1346846227212/Noodle-soup-001.jpg\" alt=\"Noodle soup\" width=\"460\" height=\"277\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Assam lakha, hot and sour soup, Penang</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John Brunton</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The century-old mining town of Papan is certainly no Klondike boom town: most of the shop-houses that line the main street are abandoned or dilapidated. People pass the time playing mah jong or talking tin prices in the Lee Seow Yoon coffee shop. Papan is Hong's special project: he has lovingly recreated the <a href=\"http://www.lestariheritage.net/perak/webpages/papan01.html\" title=\"\">dispensary where Sybil Kathigasu, known as the Malaysian Florence Nightingale</a>, secretly treated guerrilla partisans during the Japanese occupation in the second world war.</p> <p>The war theme continues down the road at Batu Gajah, whose eerie Anglican cemetery is named God's Little Acre. Here stand the graves of three British planters whose violent deaths in 1948 sparked the Malayan Emergency \u2013 12 years of fierce fighting between Chinese communists, British forces and, later, the newly independent Malaysian government. The inscriptions are chilling: \"died at the hands of terrorists\", \"murdered by terrorists\".</p> <p>The mood lightens when Hong unveils his next surprise, a quite amazing ruined castle, straight out of a Somerset Maugham story. I had heard about <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kellie%27s_Castle\" title=\"\">Kellie's Castle</a> many years before, but it used to be inaccessible, hidden in the jungle. Now this grandiose folly has become something of a tourist attraction, sitting majestically atop a grassy hillock.</p> <p>William Kellie Smith arrived in Malaya in 1890, aged 20, and after rapidly making a fortune as a planter he decided to build a romantic castle for his wife \u2013 his childhood sweetheart, Agnes. Kellie designed it in ornate Moorish revival style, and planned a rooftop terrace for parties, a basement wine cellar, even a lift to get to the top of the tower. But he died before it was completed. The castle was never inhabited, and after years of abandon it is now overgrown with vegetation and the gnarled roots of towering banyan trees, occupied by monkeys. This being Malaysia, it is apparently also home to numerous ghosts.</p> <p>We finish the day 10 miles south in the town of Tanjung Tualang, whose enterprising inhabitants had the original idea of transforming their mining lakes into farms for freshwater prawns. Every single shophouse here houses a noisy seafood restaurant, drawing busloads of gourmets each weekend. The succulent prawns are enormous, and steamed to perfection in Chinese rice wine, egg white and ginger. This is pricy for Malaysia, though \u2013 a kilo will set diners back \u00a315.</p> <p>Next day we head north from Ipoh, following winding backroads through shady rubber plantations to Kuala Kangsar, which looks at first like a quiet provincial town in a bend on the Perak river. In fact, this is a royal capital, home to the Sultan of Perak, some of the grandest palaces and mosques in Malaysia, and the prestigious Malay College, the nation's answer to Eton.</p> <p>The Sultan, whose predecessors have ruled Perak since the 1500s, lives in a grand pastel art deco palace, the Istana Iskandariah, but visitors can only get a peek from afar. The far more beguiling Istana Kenangan is a magnificent example of Malay architecture \u2013 all wood, but without a single nail. This is open to the public, because it houses the Royal Museum.</p> <p>But nothing compares to the first view of the Ubudiah mosque, a swirling vision of marble turrets and golden cupolas. It was designed in 1917 by Arthur Benison Hubback, an unsung British government architect whose idiosyncratic Indo-Saracen buildings still stand out in most of Malaysia's major towns. Walking round its cool arcades I spot a young Malay couple, resplendent in pale blue wedding robes, posing shyly for photos. Malay hospitality is so generous (and foreign visitors to Kuala Kangsar so rare) that they even invite us to the reception.</p> <p>Before reaching Penang, we plan a break in Malaysia's oldest hill station, one of the cool mountain resorts where you can escape the 30C temperatures and 95% humidity that is the daily climate throughout the year. The road signs may say Bukit Larut, but everyone still uses the colonial name of Maxwell Hill.</p> <p>Most of the hill stations have been modernised, but not Maxwell Hill. The one road up to the 1,250m summit is a rough path with 72 hairpin bends, which only the official government jeep is allowed to tackle. Every hotel development here has ended up closed or abandoned, and although there are a couple of ramshackle bungalows and nature hostels, I have been warned to prepare for minimal facilities.</p> <p>The reward, though, is a solitary paradise for birdwatchers, butterfly enthusiasts and jungle trekkers, with amazing views as far as the Andaman Sea. We are not to be rewarded today, though: usually in Malaysia, everyone's favourite catchword is <em>boleh</em> \u2013 can do \u2013 but at the jeep office, where a \"ticket sold out today\" sign foils our plans, and no amount of persuasion, or bribery, can get us a seat. So we head back to the road, and after a couple of hours are sailing over the eight-mile-long Penang bridge, which links the mainland to the island known as the pearl of the orient.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395818425\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Late_offers/pictures/2012/9/6/1346950652523/Cheong-Fatt-Tze-Mansion-P-008.jpg\" alt=\"Cheong Fatt Tze Mansion, Penang\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cheong Fatt Tze Mansion, Penang</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I must admit I did not really believe all the buzz about Penang, but the moment we arrive at our designer B&amp;B it is obvious that the island's capital, George Town, is no longer the rundown place I remember. Unesco world heritage status (granted in 2008) has saved historic buildings from the wrecking ball and bulldozer. Instead of making way for high-rise office blocks and shopping centres, the sumptuous Chinese mansions and maze-like shop-houses are being elegantly transformed into boutique hotels, art galleries and boutiques, funky restaurants and bars. And down in the street, there are still the teeming markets, artisan workshops, strange medicinal shops and delicious 24-hour hawker stalls that make George Town one of the last surviving authentic Chinatowns.</p> <p>We're staying in Cheong Fatt Tze mansion \u2013 known as the Blue Mansion because of its distinctive painted walls \u2013 which was built in the 1880s by a Chinese entrepreneur dubbed the \"Rockefeller of the East\". I actually wandered in here years ago when the house was falling apart and inhabited by squatters. Now it is a symbol of George Town's transformation, restored to its former glory, guestrooms furnished with antiques from mainland China alongside art nouveau treasures over from Europe. Our room, in the old kitchen, has the original hearth and cooker.</p> <p>For an even better glimpse of Penang's opulent past, there is the nearby Peranakan Museum (<a href=\"http://pinangperanakanmansion.com.my/\" title=\"\">pinangperanakanmansion.com.my</a>), a perfectly preserved private mansion filled with treasures.</p> <p>Wandering through Penang's melting pot of mosques, Hindu temples and incense-filled Chinese shrines, we stumble on Chinahouse (<a href=\"http://chinahouse.com.my/\" title=\"\">chinahouse.com.my</a>), an eclectic cultural centre that exhibits art-house installations, promotes reggae and soul concerts and showcases gourmet Pacific Rim cuisine \u2013 unheard of in the old Penang. Studio Howard (<a href=\"http://studiohoward.com/site/\" title=\"\">studiohoward.com</a>) is a cutting-edge photo gallery, while Campbell House (<a href=\"http://www.campbellhousepenang.com/\" title=\"\">campbellhousepenang.com</a>) is a hip guesthouse with a genuine Venetian restaurant \u2013 it's run by a chef from La Serenissima who has come to Penang to make his name.</p> <p>This is just the tip of the iceberg of the metamorphosis of the pearl of the orient. Responsible heritage tourism could well have the same effect on the rest of Malaysia's heartland.</p>",
  "<p>What arguments rage at the home of Britain's nuclear deterrent? At teatime, very polite ones. \"No, Jean, put your purse away,\" one silver-haired lady says to another in the Craigard Tearoom. \"Och, but Agnes, you&#xa0;paid the last time,\" says the other. Scone-crumbs fleck their plates; the lemon meringue pie has been resisted; absent friends have been remembered; nobody hurries to get home.</p> <p>Helensburgh has several such eating places, along with a greengrocer, a good butcher, a fishmonger, a wool shop, a couple of delis and a china warehouse, R&amp;A Urie, which must have been selling dinner plates, whisky decanters and figurines since the days of the last King Edward. To describe the town as genteel would be only half the story: the seafront is a dilapidated jumble of failing commerce and cheap modernism. But in&#xa0;a country where the social division is west-east rather than England's north-south, Helensburgh is an exception to the rule that wealth declines the further you move from the North Sea to the Atlantic. Look out from Helensburgh's promenade and there, a few miles across the Clyde, is Greenock, still struggling to find an economy after shipbuilding's collapse, a town that obeys the west-east rule&#xa0;down to the last shuttered pub.</p> <p>Historic purpose explains some of Helensburgh's difference. Never industrial, it was first a sea-bathing resort and&#xa0;then, after the railway came, the farthest-flung Glasgow suburb, attracting businessmen rich enough to commission villas from architects such as Charles Rennie Mackintosh, whose Hill House is about to be eclipsed as the town's star attraction by a new Waitrose. There are only four other Waitrose stores in Scotland, catering for the urban elites of Glasgow and Edinburgh. That Helensburgh \u2013 not oil-rich Aberdeen \u2013 should get the fifth may say a little about the sophistication of a town that gave the world Jack Buchanan and Deborah Kerr, but it says much more about the cold war and British defence policy in the 1980s. The Trident base at Faslane, a&#xa0;few miles to the north, has maintained Helensburgh's unusual prosperity. Without Faslane \u2013 and without the Trident D5 missile, each with warheads capable of a&#xa0;hundred Hiroshimas \u2013 the boon of Waitrose's luxury pork sausages would likely be dropped elsewhere.</p> <p>\"The most militarised district in western Europe is also the scene of retirement and improving leisure,\" the writer James Buchan once observed, \"as if the US had collected its entire nuclear forces in West Hampton, New York, or the French at Deauville.\" And so it is, though the evidence in town is benign. English voices mingle with Scottish ones in Helensburgh's streets, while Urie's china store is stacked with royal jubilee mugs and The Buffet delicatessen is strewn with little union flags, which also flutter from the odd garden flagpole. In&#xa0;the rest of Scotland, such tokens of Britishness are rarer than they were, now the saltire's blue and white have become the colours of national feeling.</p> <p>I took the road up the Gareloch, past the marinas and yacht clubs until the razor wire rose on my left. I've been here several times before, but the sheer scale of Faslane is somehow always a surprise. An innocent visitor might imagine a wharf, a few cranes, some sheds and a submarine. But throughout the 1980s and 90s, the military worked like God to reshape the landscape \u2013 or rather landscapes in the plural, because nuclear submarines are armed at Coulport on Loch Long as well serviced and crewed at Faslane on the Gareloch. At Coulport, a covered handling jetty \"as tall as Nelson's Column and as long as two football pitches\" (to quote the National Audit Office) enables warheads to be fixed and unfixed from missiles without taking the missiles from their tubes in the submarine. Five miles away at Faslane, a ship lift as big as Wembley Stadium (another NAO analogy) can raise a 15,900-ton submarine high enough to allow maintenance of its pressure hulls and sensors.</p> <p>These are the centrepieces. There are also smaller workshops, barracks, watch towers, jetties, canteens, arms dumps, and roads to connect them all. To&#xa0;quote Buchan again, Her Majesty's Naval Base Clyde \"looks like Guant\u00e1namo Bay at a higher latitude\". The Ministry of Defence has never built anything larger or more complicated. It employs around 7,000 people, a workforce that has been increasingly outsourced to civilian contractors; another 4,000 depend on it&#xa0;as a main source of income. Scotland has no larger single industrial enterprise, and yet the Scottish National Party has said that an independent Scotland would demand it pack its bags and leave.</p> <p>True, the words have been softened over the years. What in 1992 was a pledge \"to order nuclear weapons and installations off our soil\" had become by 2001 the promise to \"negotiate the safe removal of Trident from Scotland\". But any further softening looks unlikely, given the protest that ensued inside the party last month when the leadership proposed dropping its traditional opposition to the idea that an independent Scotland join Nato. In theory, then, one&#xa0;of the first acts of an independent Scottish government would be to start a&#xa0;process that ended in it handing out thousands of P45s. The SNP insists that it has plans for Faslane as \"a vibrant and sustainable conventional naval base\", but which small, peaceable country needs such sophisticated naval equipment and so many workers? The whole of Ireland's navy can put to sea with a crew totalling no more than 1,200.</p> <p>To drive over the high road from the Gareloch to Loch Long, with the Faslane base spread out below, is to be struck with three impossibilities. First, that something so vast could ever be easily uprooted. Second, that a pragmatic government would damage or destroy a&#xa0;local economy for the sake of its anti-nuclear principles. Third, that the rump government of the United Kingdom could afford to build a replacement for Faslane south of the border, even if it could find a locality willing to take it.</p> <p>So in the process of Scottish independence, as yet hypothetical, my guess is that Trident will become a bargaining chip to be deployed by Edinburgh's negotiating team in exchange for a big London favour. (Bigger oil rights? A smaller share of the national debt?) Its bases will survive where they are on leasehold into the mid-2020s, when the submarines are due to be replaced, at a currently estimated cost of \u00a325bn. But, sadly for the shipworkers of Barrow, there will be no replacements. A truncated UK will then have lost the taste and the budget for \"punching above its weight\", and Trident submarines will be seen as what they are: a strange consequence of British military ambition in the last century, as beautiful and terrible in their way as the Dreadnought, though unlike the Dreadnought (one hopes) never used. And so they will quietly pass away, leaving Helensburgh's Waitrose among their monuments.</p>",
  "<p>\"You didn't elect me to tell you what you wanted to hear,\" Barack Obama insisted to the Democratic faithful on Thursday, and yet the truth is that the phrases that carried him to the White House acquired much of their meaning in the ears of his audience. Four years ago, he could speak ringingly of \"hope\" and \"change you can believe in\", and leave it to the divided voters of the United States to attach disparate dreams on to these versatile slogans. Accepting his party's nomination for a second run at the job in Charlotte on Thursday was always going to be a more workaday task, and he turned in <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2012/09/04/us/politics/democratic-convention-speeches-annotated.html\" title=\"\">a speech</a> which \u2013 by the standards of his more soaring oratory \u2013 was notably workmanlike.</p> <p>There were pledgecard-style promises for the doubling of small business exports and new manufacturing jobs, as well as gritty statistics about changes already wrought, such as the recent easing of America's addiction to imported oil. Some of the difference with 2008 is the familiar dulling of the poetry of the insurgent campaigner into the prose of a president with a record to defend. But some of it reflects the particular need of the hour \u2013 to demonstrate practical plans to ease the slow grind that day-to-day life has become ever since the Great Recession took hold. In a country whose social safety net is shot through with holes, hope will never be more than a slogan for the downtrodden until the labour market springs back to life. A few hours after Mr Obama's star turn, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-19519037\" title=\"\">new figures</a> revealed that just 96,000 new jobs were created in August, 30,000 less than expected. Even without Europe's immediate crisis or Britain's self-administered austerity overdose, the US remains stuck with, in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2011/nov/08/after-crash-semi-slump\" title=\"\">Keynes's phrase,</a> the \"dragging conditions of semi-slump\".</p> <p>The unemployment rate edged down from 8.3% to 8.1%, but only because so many discouraged folk are <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/richard-adams-blog/2012/sep/07/obama-convention-momentum-jobs-live\" title=\"\">giving up on looking for work</a>; it remains just the wrong side of the 8% threshold above which no postwar president has achieved a second term. The last one who did was Franklin Roosevelt in 1936. When he <a href=\"http://www.austincc.edu/lpatrick/his2341/fdr36acceptancespeech.htm\" title=\"\">spoke to the Democratic convention</a> of that year in Philadelphia he had, like Mr Obama, pulled the economy back from the worst depths, and sought to smooth the roughest social edges of hard economic times. But Roosevelt's energetic \"bold experimentation\" \u2013 which was hailed by the president on Thursday night \u2013 had certainly not yet restored anything like full employment. Just like Mr Obama, therefore, FDR had to make out the positive case for himself by first elucidating how much worse things could have been. He did so by declaring a great \"war against want and destitution\" and all those reactionaries who hankered for a return to \"government frozen in the ice of its own indifference\". He went on to win by a landslide.</p> <p>There is not now the deep-seated sense that there was in the 30s that the tide of history was running the progressive way; instead it is today American conservatives who often exude the most cocksure confidence. Indeed, despite the Republican party's want of answers to a crisis created under George W Bush, <a href=\"http://www.gallup.com/poll/156857/obama-wins-likability-romney-economy.aspx\" title=\"\">the polls</a> tend to give Mitt Romney the edge on the economy. Nor is it in the conciliatory nature of Mr Obama \u2013 a man who had once hoped for a post-partisan presidency \u2013 to close his speech, as Roosevelt did, by accepting a commission to take on the armies of reaction, for as long as the combat should rage. But after four years frustrated by unreasoning Republican intransigence at every turn, there were flashes of something close to fury. The president mocked a philosophy which for 30 years has offered one prescription for every ailment \u2013 \"Take two tax cuts, roll back some regulations, and call us in the morning.\"</p> <p>The tactics about swing states and surgical targeting of independently inclined demographics continues with yawnsome predictability. The underlying battle of economic ideas is, however, bubbling closer to the surface.</p>",
  "<p>The brother of an Iraqi-born Briton who was murdered along with three other people in the French Alps has denied that he was in dispute with the dead man over financial matters, investigators in France have said.</p> <p>French prosecutor Eric Maillaud said that police had been told earlier of a possible feud over money involving Saad al-Hilli, the victim, and his brother but that the sibling had gone to a police station in the UK to deny that this was the case.</p> <p>He said that the brother, Zaid al-Hilli, first spoke to police in Britain on Thursday after learning of the massacre from media reports.</p> <p>\"He turned up again this morning because he heard about the conflict, the dispute between himself and his brother and he said, 'no, I don't have a conflict with my brother',\" Maillaud added.</p> <p>Hilli, died from a bullet to the head along with his wife, his 77-year-old mother-in-law and a French cyclist, all gunned down on the edge of a secluded Alpine forest near Lake Annecy and the Swiss border.</p> <p>The murder bears the hallmarks of a professional assassination, according to French investigators, who have sent four officers to Britain to find out more about victim Hilli's life.</p> <p>The French team, which landed in London on Friday evening, will work with British investigators and plan to search Hilli's house in Claygate, south-west London.</p> <p>Maillaud also revealed that Hilli's four-year-old daughter Zeena, who survived by hiding under her mother, had spoken to police about the attack, describing what the prosecutor said was the \"fury\" and \"terror\" of a massacre during which 25 bullets were fired at the victims.</p> <p>\"She explained that from the beginning of the murder she was already between her mother and that other woman and she rushed under her mother's legs, her mother's skirt,\" he added.</p> <p>The little girl and her seven-year-old sister Zainab, who remains in a medically induced coma after being shot and beaten, are apparently the only witnesses to the shootings and are now under police protection.</p> <p>Maillaud also said the family had visited France a number of times before and it was not the first time they had been to Le Solitaire du Lac campsite in Saint-Jorioz, which was where they were staying when they died.</p> <p>Investigators, who say the murders bear the hallmarks of a professional assassination, had said earlier that one line of enquiry was based on suggestions that there had been a money dispute in the family.</p>",
  "<p>The fiasco at <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/londonmetropolitanuniversity\" title=\"\">London Metropolitan</a> is making every university with non-EU students sit up and rub its eyes. While British people of all ethnicities may well be becoming more hawkish on immigration, the proposed clampdown on student visas seems designed to appeal to those whose idea of Britain is not imaginative or comprehensive.</p> <p>Teaching on the master's in creative writing at the University of East Anglia \u2013 which last year won a Queen's Anniversary Award for Higher and Further Education \u2013 I have encountered students from China, Sweden, India and North America. The Man Booker fellowship at UEA has twice been awarded to Canadians. The next two years will see young writers from Brazil, Singapore, Nigeria and the Philippines arrive in Norwich, newly dubbed a Unesco city of literature. A third of the 2012-13 intake will be non-EU.</p> <p>The idea that visas might be denied to these applicants, who have competed with around 250 other candidates for 30 places, is as barmy as a bottle of spiders. Many international creative writing students retain British agents and publishers when they go home. Going beyond creative writing, a recent <a href=\"http://www.oxfordeconomics.com/samples/intexe.pdf\" title=\"\">Oxford Economics case-study of Exeter University</a> showed that every 10 international students support six British jobs.</p> <p>Foreign students add cultural value to their British peers, who need an international outlook. As TS Eliot once put it: \"Uniformity means the obliteration of culture, and \u2026 self-sufficiency means its death by starvation.\" The woman of letters knows this too, no doubt.</p> <p>It's perilous, this cocksure assumption that the UK higher education sector can hold its own financially without foreign students. We're in danger of ensnaring our best export \u2013 education \u2013 in the deadly red tape that the prime minister so abhors.</p> <p>Canada recently resolved to double international student numbers. Australia, New Zealand, Germany, France and Japan all distinguish for policy purposes between foreign students and other migrants. Britain needs to follow through and take university-sponsored students out of its net migration target.</p> <p>Even the Home Office's own analysis indicates that university-sponsored students are no less than 98% visa-compliant, and very likely more. The tiny fraction of fraudulent student visas must be balanced against the huge cost of alienating foreign applications wholesale. And that is happening already. This week, the Times of India reported that Indian students are cancelling applications to UK universities. We just don't seem welcoming any more, despite Olympic bonhomie. This is squarely the fault of a government bent on tearing itself in two. One part stretches our narrow island into the world, adept and flexible and exploratory, seeking trade and influence; the other is chained to the salt-lick of atavistic localism, batting away global opportunities like a cow's tail in June.</p> <p>We need to tool our development and diplomacy policies to meet the causes of migration at source, in partnership with the countries where they occur. Declining paying students will empty Treasury pockets much more quickly than useful initiatives abroad (in all likelihood the applied product of British university research anyway).</p> <p>While most academics have come to accept a market economy in education, the very institutions which enable that idea are now under threat. The proposed visa policy could bring universities crashing down, as if they were birds suddenly given wings of lead.</p> <p>Luckily, there are some wise voices on parliament's business, innovation and skills committee, <a href=\"http://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/commons-select/business-innovation-and-skills/news/overseas-students-and-net-migration-chairs-comments/\" title=\"\">which published a report on the issue</a> this week. It reveals cross-departmental vellication about the Home Office's plans: \"Despite the view of the Home Office, the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills appears to be sympathetic to removing overseas students from the government's migration figures.\" The report's conclusions come out strongly in favour of recording overseas students in a separate classification and not counting them against the overall limit on net migration. That would be the right decision, recognising the vital importance of the international student to our economy. <em> </em></p>",
  "<p>It was a lovely moment at Brands Hatch, laced not just with a sliver of alluring amateurism, but also with a sense of the strictures of competition shrinking just for a moment into the background of what is at bottom a celebration of sporting heart. A bronze medal for Great Britain's Rachel Morris in the women's individual H1-3 road race was a wonderful story of triumph against extreme adversity \u2013 or in fact additional extreme adversity \u2013 in its own right.</p> <p>Not only does Morris live with reflex sympathetic dystrophy, a hugely painful nerve condition that has led in turn to both her legs being amputated, she also suffered a dislocated shoulder in a collision with a car just weeks before these Games, destroying her bike and derailing her training regime at a single stroke. In the event Morris, who had ruled herself out of podium contention, was party to one of the moments of these Games, slowing as she approached the line in third place to link hands with her team-mate Karen Darke in a deliberate attempt to cross the line in a dead heat and thereby share the bronze. There was an additional gloss: this was the medal that would take Great Britain's total past 21, thereby surpassing the achievements of Beijing.</p> <p>For a moment there was even a suggestion it might come off. Morris and Darke were recorded as finishing in the same time, 1h 43min 08sec, and suggested initially they would refuse to accept the bronze unless it was shared between the two. This, though, was never going to wash with the race officials, who decided in a photo-finish that Morris had crossed the line marginally in front and awarded her the medal. Albeit not before several paddock wags had suggested both athletes might stand to be disqualified for refusing to race, just as the Brownlee bothers had been warned before the Olympics against staging a dead heat in the triathlon. Which, on a sweltering Kent day that saw this grand, slightly rickety old track thronged with a bank holiday-ish crowd, and buoyed a by large and celebratory Irish contingent, might just have sparked a minor venue revolt.</p> <p>\"We wanted it together. We crossed the line with our hands together. So hopefully we'll get a medal each \u2013 that's the plan,\" Morris said. \"We worked so hard together, so we'll both get on the podium together.\" It wasn't to be though. Darke, who is paralysed from the chest down after falling off a cliff aged 21, watched as Morris mounted the steps before returning to briefly drape the medal around her team-mate's neck in a lovely display of competitive generosity before all four fastest finishers \u2013 as opposed to the standard three \u2013 posed for the photographers. \"They both rode out of their skins and we're just as proud of them,\" the team's director Chris Furber said, confirming that none of the coaching staff had any idea what the two athletes had in mind as they approached the finish having failed to catch the American pair of Marianna Davis and Monica Basico.</p> <p>\"We were expecting a sprint finish between the two of them for the bronze and even discussing which one we each thought was going to get it,\" Furber said. \"Then with 150m to go it became apparent what was going to happen. It was just a really nice moment of friendship. They've been through a lot together in life and in training. As a coach you're entirely focused on medals and achievement but sometimes it's nice to see that at times friendship can take precedence over anything else in the sport.\"</p> <p>Darke, who had already won silver in the H1-2 time trial, is unlikely to spend too long dwelling on what was, in the end, an entirely sensible decision to deny her a share of the bronze. After returning home to Inverness she will resume preparations for an expedition to the South Pole, having previously crossed Greenland's ice cap on skis, climbed Mont Blanc, the Matterhorn and California's El Capitan, and hand-cycled all the way across Japan.</p> <p>This is a Paralympic sport of relatively recent vintage, having been introduced at the Athens Games of 2004. It is a discipline imported from the hand-bikes first introduced in the 1980s for non-disabled riders, and rapidly adopted as a brilliant boon to cycling for those with impairments to their legs. Riders pedal and steer with their hands, reaching extreme three-wheeled speeds and providing at Brands Hatch not just the spectacle of the Morris-Darke hand-clasp finish, but a day of elite racing that delighted a substantial crowd ranged around the steeply banked spectating ravines of this rather ramshackle venue.</p> <p>There is something deeply 1970s about Brands Hatch, a venerable track lodged in the green interior of Kent that hosted its last grand prix race a quarter of a century ago and still seems synonymous with an era of powerful aftershave, the James Hunt-esque medallion and the weekend machismo of the pre-modern racing circuit. Patched up, decorated with purple hoardings and fish and chip shacks and infused with a noticeably thirsty Irish contingent here to cheer on Mark Rohan in the H1 road race, the grounds had the air more of a well-stocked country fete than a high end Paralympic event.</p> <p>On the track though it was an exhilarating afternoon, marked first of all by Rohan's boisterously received gold medal. Rohan was an inter-county Gaelic footballer before suffering serious injuries in a motorbike accident in 2001. A poster boy in Ireland for both the summer Games, he has delivered gloriously here, having previously won gold in the time trial.</p> <p>After which the day's racing was rounded off by the spectacle of hand-cycling's reigning glamour boy, the extraordinary Alex Zanardi, who appeared to large, rolling cheers to compete in the men's H4 road race. Zanardi, of course, knows Brands Hatch rather well. A former Formula One driver, he lost both his legs in 2001 in a horrendous 220mph crash in a Champ Car race. Zanardi was resuscitated seven times on his way to hospital and lost vast amounts of blood but was up walking on prosthetic legs just months after the accident, even returning to motor racing in a specially adapted car.</p> <p>Now 45, and having taken up hand-cycling initially to keep fit, he won gold in the time trial on Wednesday, returning to a track that as a racing driver he negotiated in F3000 and then in the World Touring Car Championship, finishing second and third but never previously first. But Zanardi won a second gold in 2hr 32sec.</p> <p>His presence here leant a rather starry gloss as the shadows lengthened. Not to mention a reminder of the pure racing qualities of a sport that bears some similarities to motor racing with its emphasis on engineering refinements, attritional tactical elements and \u2013 for one day at least \u2013 a moment of Formula One-style collusion at the finish line that brought bronze for Great Britain and a gloriously memorable moment of camaraderie for those present in the&#xa0;stands.</p>",
  "<p>There is a famous Monty Python sketch called \"Four Yorkshiremen\". It portrays tuxedo-wearing men sipping fine red wine, chomping on cigars and eagerly reminiscing about their impoverished childhoods.

According to their own stories, speaker after speaker detailed their family's rise from poverty to success in the space of a generation or two. In order to praise the powerful myth of the American Dream, both Republicans and Democrats battled to outdo each other with origin stories of deprived woe.</p> <p>Here, for example, is <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0812/80348.html\">Rick Santorum, praising the memory of his Italian immigrant coal-mining grandfather</a>. \"My grandfather mined coal until he was 72 years old \u2026 working the mines may not have been the dream he dreamed \u2013 I never dared to ask him \u2013 but I think his answer would have been that America gave him more than he had ever hoped,\" Santorum opined, though surely anyone would hope for more than working in a coal pit until well past 70.</p> <p>But that was just for starters. <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0812/80413.html\">Former Minnesota Governor Tim Pawlenty could top that</a>.</p> <blockquote> <p>\"My dad was a truck driver. My mom was a homemaker. She died when I was 16, and my dad lost his job not long after that.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Wow. That must have been tough. But not as tough as <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2012/08/30/rubio_obama_trying_ideas_people_came_to_america_to_get_away_from.html\">Florida Senator Marco Rubio's grandfather's experience</a>. \"He was born to a farming family in rural Cuba. Childhood polio left him permanently disabled,\" Rubio explained.</p> <p>Some Republicans went back a little further. <a href=\"http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2012/08/29/transcript-sen-rand-paul-speech-at-rnc/\">Kentucky Senator Rand Paul talked about his great-grandfather</a>. \"No sooner had he stepped off the boat then his father died. He arrived in Pittsburgh as a teenager with nothing, not a penny,\" he said. Even \u2013 staggeringly \u2013 super-rich Mitt Romney <a href=\"http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2012/08/30/transcript-mitt-romney-speech-at-rnc/\">joined in</a>. \"My dad had been born in Mexico and his family had to leave during the Mexican revolution,\" Mitt said. \"I grew up with stories of his family being fed by the US government as war refugees.\"</p> <p>Make no mistake, though, this posturing was a thoroughly bipartisan affair. <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/2012/09/04/160574895/transcript-julian-castros-dnc-keynote-address\">Here is new Democratic Hispanic leader Julian Castro, the mayor of San Antonio</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"My grandmother was an orphan \u2026 She never made it past the fourth grade. She had to drop out and start working to help her family. My grandmother spent her whole life working as a maid, a cook and a babysitter, barely scraping by.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Or <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0912/80673.html\">listen to Illinois congressional candidate Tammy Duckworth</a>. \"Mom took in sewing. My 55-year-old dad tried to find work. But at 15, I was the only one with a job \u2013 after school, for minimum wage. Thank God for the food stamps,\" she told the Charlotte gathering. </p> <p>From the famous to the unknown, everyone got in on the act. <a href=\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/videos/2012/09/06/scarlett-johansson-addresses-dnc.html\">Hollywood star Scarlett Johansson was not to be denied</a>. \"My father barely made enough to get by. We moved every year, and we finally settled in a housing development for lower middle-income families,\" she said, though that hardly sounds too Dickensian. But <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/2012/09/04/160578836/transcript-michelle-obamas-convention-speech\">Michelle Obama could make up for that</a>. \"My father was a pump operator at the city water plant, and he was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis when my brother and I were young,\" she reminisced. </p> <p>It is important to say there is no doubt these stories are true. They are also moving, showing the brave struggles and sacrifices that one generation can make for another, or the sheer obstacles that some individuals have overcome to achieve high office. But in the context of the propaganda jamborees that are modern conventions, they are being used to make a political point: the American Dream came true for me and it can for you, too. Increasingly, however, evidence for the truth of that sentiment is seriously wanting. </p> <p>Despite the heartwarming tales emerging from both sides of the political aisle, social mobility in America is under serious threat. In many ways, if you are to be born poor, you would be better-off being born somewhere else in the developed world than in the United States of America. Your chances of improving your social lot are likely to be better. As <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/howard-steven-friedman/class-mobility_b_1676931.html\">Columbia University Professor Howard Steven Friedman writes, about the work of the Economic Mobility Project</a>, the prospects of bettering oneself in the US can be worse than in many other developed countries, even class-ridden Britain. Friedman points out that an American male's income is nearly twice as reliant on his father's background as a Canadian's. Another study showed some 42% of American sons of fathers born in the poorest fifth of society ended up in that fifth themselves. That compares to <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/howard-steven-friedman/class-mobility_b_1676931.html\">30% in the UK, and a range of 25-28% in Denmark, Sweden, Finland and Norway</a>.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/05/us/harder-for-americans-to-rise-from-lower-rungs.html?pagewanted=all\">A separate report</a>, by University of Ottawa Professor Miles Corak in 2006, reviewed 50 mobility studies of nine countries. He, too, ranked the Scandinavian nations and Canada as the most likely to be socially mobile, with the US and the UK bringing up the rear. But just in case you had any doubts, the Nobel Prize-winning economist Joseph Stiglitz has also got in on the argument. In his recent book, The Price of Inequality, <a href=\"http://finance.yahoo.com/blogs/daily-ticker/american-dream-myth-joseph-stiglitz-price-inequality-124338674.html\">he writes that America's growing gap between the rich and the rest of us has decreased social mobility</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"America has the least equality of opportunity of any of the advanced industrial economies.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Many believe the nub of America's problem is with the very poor, skewing the figures for the country as a whole. As <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/the-american-dream-is-now-a-myth-2012-6\">the first graph in this Business Insider story shows</a> the real difference between a socially mobile country, like Denmark, and a less mobile one like the US <em>is</em> with the bottom fifth of society. Elsewhere on the spectrum, countries are much more comparable. Which makes the \"poverty arm's race\" on display in Tampa and Charlotte all the more misleading: if you are really born on the \"wrong side of the tracks\" in today's America, you are much more likely to stay there than end up testifying to a national convention about your remarkable rise out of deprivation.</p> <p>As America's politicians outdid each other to try and show how far they had come, the reality on the ground now is making those journeys longer and far more difficult. Unlike the Monty Python sketch, that is not funny.</p>",

  "<p>The world is coming to a dramatic end; ice caps are melting, natural resources are being gobbled up by the day and mother nature has humanity under her thumb with flash-flooding, tsunamis and droughts speeding up our rapidly approaching demise. As a concerned citizen, you should be feeling responsible, taking decisive action and doing whatever it takes, no matter what the cost or inconvenience. Standing-by as doomsday approaches is just not an option.</p> <p>Do these warnings of impending disaster engage you as a consumer or inspire you to adopt more sustainable behaviours? The answer is probably, no.</p> <p>As Oliver Balch writes in <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sustainable-business/sustainable-living-easy-normal-fun?intcmp=122\" title=\"\">his blog this week</a>, achieving a change in behaviour will not come from this form of hard-line environmental advertising, which only around 10% of consumers buy into. Instead, messages need to be inspiring and perhaps amusing, and most definitely provide easy and fun solutions. Lectures should be banned and clarity and ease are of the essence, writes Balch.</p> <p>This all sounds good in theory but the question is how to do it: how can businesses and governments make sustainable behaviours desirable?</p> <p>There have already been some success stories.</p> <p>In partnership with Oxfam, highstreet retailer M&amp;S has devised \"<a href=\"http://www.marksandspencer.com/Shwop/b/1672188031\" title=\"\">shwopping</a>\", a cross between shopping and swapping. The scheme encourages customers to hand over an old or unwanted piece of clothing whenever they buy a new one. The initiative offers no incentive but with more than 500,000 items donated in the first few months, M&amp;S has clearly tapped into the consumer mindset. The simple nature of the ask and ease at which it can be carried out could be the secret behind its success.</p> <p>Other companies have been shining the spotlight on consumer behaviour as well. Asda has set up a pop up farm for youngsters near its head office to practically educate the next generation on the environment, whilst consumer company Unilever is well know for its behaviour change strategy, <a href=\"http://www.unilever.com/sustainable-living/news/news/inspiring-sustainable-living.aspx\" title=\"\">Five Levers for Change</a>.</p> <p>While these examples are a step in the right direction, business, governments and citizens still have a mountain to climb.</p> <p>Our live discussion will explore what is needed to make sustainable behaviours fun, easy and normal and how this can be achieved at the scale and pace required. We'll look at how business can help nudge consumers in the right direction, focusing on the role that marketing and communications strategies can play. What products would help make sustainable actions occur naturally, rather than with conscious effort from the consumer, and where do government policy and new frameworks enter the equation?</p> <h2>The Panel</h2> <p><strong><a href=\"http://www.scp-centre.org/team/the-cscp-team.html\">Cheryl Hicks</a></strong>, lead sustainable lifestyles, UNEP/ Wuppertal Institute Collaborating Centre on Sustainable Production and Consumption (CSCP)</p> <p><strong>Freya Williams</strong>, director of strategy at OgilvyEarth</p> <p><strong>David Jones</strong>, global CEO at Havas and co-founder of One Young World</p> <p><strong>Professor Fergus Lowe</strong>, professor in psychology at Bangor University and CEO of Food Dudes Health</p> <p><strong>Mark Earls</strong>, author of Herd</p> <p><strong>Stefano Giolito</strong>, director, sustainability at Unilever</p> <p><strong>Dr Mark Cobain</strong>, global new business director at Unilever</p> <p>To debate the topic with our cross sector panel of experts, join us on <strong>Wednesday 12 September 2-4pm (BST)</strong> for this live discussion.

  "<p>When I joined the staff of the Catholic bishops' newly founded Justice and Peace Commission in 1970, there were very few lay women in leadership roles in the church in Britain. My dear friend, Mildred Nevile, who has died of cancer aged 85, was a shining exception.</p> <p>She was brought up in Lincolnshire, part of a devoutly Catholic family of diplomats and civil servants. Her work in the early 1950s with the Young Christian Students led her in 1958 into the <a href=\"http://www.swordofthespirit.net/\" title=\"\">Sword of the Spirit movement</a>, which in 1965 became the Catholic Institute for International Relations (CIIR). With Mildred at the helm as general secretary from 1967, it epitomised the enthusiasm for tackling poverty and injustice globally that swept Catholicism in the wake of the reforming Second Vatican Council of the mid-1960s.</p> <p>I was one of the many young people inspired by Mildred to join that fight. In my own case, her example also led me to convert to Catholicism. Under Mildred's guidance, CIIR, from its offices in the Africa Centre in Covent Garden, London, played an active role for change in Chile, El Salvador, apartheid South Africa, Rhodesia and East Timor. She established its volunteering programme, sending young people off around the globe to work in solidarity with the poor and oppressed, and then return to take up the struggle in Britain. Some of those she mentored and encouraged went on to run leading domestic and international charities and development agencies.</p> <p>What was perhaps most powerful about Mildred was the practical way in which she lived out her commitment to social justice. She insisted that CIIR campaigns be evidence-based and carefully argued. She wanted to put the facts into the public arena and trusted that those who read them would share her sense of outrage at human rights abuses, poverty and marginalisation.</p> <p>She had tremendous courage and a great freedom about her. She had no qualms about confronting those in power \u2013 whether in the secular or church world \u2013 but did it in a polite, well-mannered way that meant she had friends on all sides of the political spectrum, as well as among bishops and cardinals. Yet, she could be devastatingly sharp if they tried to ignore the evidence she presented. Her radicalism lived within a calm exterior that made it all more potent.</p> <p>When she retired from CIIR in 1985, Mildred was appointed MBE and continued to support the organisation as it renamed itself <a href=\"http://www.progressio.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Progressio</a>. She was also a trustee of Cafod, the Catholic development agency, and the first chair of the Churches' National Housing Coalition (now Housing Justice). Most recently she was an active patron of the <a href=\"https://sites.google.com/site/denishurleyassociation/\" title=\"\">Denis Hurley Association</a>, formed to help to build a new community centre in Durban, South Africa.</p> <p>She continued tirelessly to dedicate herself to those in need \u2013 whether it be the asylum seekers she befriended, those in the detention centres she visited, or individuals she worked with as an ecumenical spiritual director (having gained an MA in theology from Leeds University as a mature student). She took the demand of the gospels to love our neighbour and lived it out to the full, holding firm to the view that love must include justice.</p> <p>There was, alongside her wisdom and holiness, a tremendous sense of fun in Mildred. Whatever the setbacks she encountered, her optimism and belief that something could be done never faltered.</p> <p><strong> </strong></p>",

  "<p>New York fashion week started with a bang yesterday. Determined to re-write Africa's story, five designers by way of Lagos and London lit up the New York catwalk in the Arise African Icons tent with chic women's and menswear designs. If you thought African fashion was just the odd Accra printed skirt, you couldn't be more wrong.</p> <p>Popular established designers such as Ozwald Boateng, showed alongside new talent such as Maki Oh, who is already garnering stellar reviews from the New York fashion press. The runway show was all about glamour, with African prints reworked and updated for the spring season, stunning silk and lace womenswear designs and show stopping, floor-length cocktail dresses \u2013 proving what African designers have long been saying \u2013 they are more than just their prints, but when they do a print, boy, do they do it well. </p> <p>The clothes weren't the only attraction, either. The models transformed the runway, thanks to the spectrum of shades. Black and Asian models stomped down the catwalk in droves, celebrating the different hues of black skin, often under-represented at most other shows in the tents.</p> <p>For those of you who didn't get a front-row ticket to the <a href=\"http://www.ariselive.com/\" title=\"\">Arise</a> show, here are the African Icons spring 2013 designers you need to know.</p> <p><strong>1. </strong><a href=\"http://www.ozwaldboateng.co.uk/\" title=\"\"><strong>Ozwald Boateng</strong></a><strong> OBE</strong></p> <p>Long before menswear started to have its moment, Boateng was championing the fit of a good suit. From his Savile Row shop, the British designer of Ghanaian descent, made history as the first black tailor to have a shop on the Row. Over his 25-year career, he's become the go-to designer for Hollywood and the man on the street who wants to look sharp. Yesterday, Boateng's collection lit up the runway. It was saved until last and for good reason. His men's suits, in an array of spring colours, from bright red to canary yellow \u2013showed that the suit can looked playful \u2013 and there's room for it beyond the boardroom. While the selection of double-breasted jackets and macs, which fitted the models perfectly, proved there's more to the designer than just his trademark suits.</p> <p><strong>2. </strong><a href=\"https://twitter.com/Maki_Oh\" title=\"\"><strong>Maki Oh</strong></a></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395807963\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Arts/Arts_/Pictures/2012/9/7/1347022072081/Maki-Oh-NYFW-009.jpg\" alt=\"Maki Oh NYFW\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Designer to watch in 2013 \u2026 Maki Oh.

  "<h2>1) Scotland 0-1 England (British Home Championship/World Cup qualifier, April 1950)</h2> <p>The qualification process for the 1950 World Cup was an across-the-board farce, requiring only the addition of a frustrated housewife, a pair of loose-fitting trousers and a wardrobe to elevate the process into a viable stage venture. Syria travelled to Turkey, lost 7-0, and dispatched the toys from the pram in a parabolic frenzy, exiting stage right before a return leg could be played. Turkey automatically advanced to a second stage against Austria, who also withdrew, handing the Turks a free pass to the finals. At which point Turkey bailed out themselves, leaving Fifa to offer the spot to Portugal, who had already been knocked out by Spain. But the Portuguese decided they couldn't be bothered any more, and politely declined. Fifa's planned 16-team jamboree would be one participant short.</p> <p>The plot was scarcely less ludicrous in south America, where Argentina showed no interest in reaching a finals in Brazil: relations between the two countries had soured after a couple of matches in 1946 and 1947 during which Argentinian legs were snapped like breadsticks while Brazilian jowls were vigorously biffed into red-raw ribbons by way of response. With Peru and Ecuador also throwing it in before a ball had been kicked, no matches whatsoever were required to ascertain the Conmebol contingent. Meanwhile in Asia, Burma, Indonesia and the Philippines all sacked it off early doors, leaving India with a free run. But the prohibitive expense of getting to Brazil \u2013 coupled with a Fifa diktat insisting their barefooted team play in boots \u2013 meant the Indians too eventually opted out. Fifa were now down to 14 teams for their grand shebang.</p> <p>But back in Europe, the best was yet to come. Fifa, very generously, had offered places to the top two finishers in the 1950 Home Championship. Given the state of Wales and Ireland at the time, this was effectively a formal invitation to England and Scotland. But the Scottish FA \u2013 confidence bolstered by a wholly unexpected victory at Wembley in 1949 in which Morton goalkeeper Jimmy Cowan single-handedly saw off Stan Mortensen, Jackie Milburn, Tom Finney and Stanley Matthews \u2013 haughtily announced that they would only accept the invite if they won the championship.</p> <p>There was only ever one way this was going to pan out. Scotland trounced the Irish 8-2 in Belfast, then beat Wales at Hampden Park. The results meant the Scots had earned a berth in the 1950 World Cup, sure as they were of at least second place even if defeated by England in the last match at Hampden. Furthermore, a draw against England would be enough to ensure they had at least one hand on the championship trophy, because although England had scored more goals in seeing off Wales and Ireland themselves, nobody bothered with that sort of thing in those days.</p> <p>Scotland were considered narrow favourites, even though they'd not beaten England at Hampden since 1937. The English were genuinely fearful of Rangers right-winger Willie Waddell, and unsure of getting any change from the Scottish defence, marshalled brilliantly by Willie Woodburn (later to be banned indefinitely for his occasional habit of sticking the nut on opposing players who offended his sensibilities). \"If Bentley loses his colleagues in trying to elude the Scottish half-backs,\" previewed the Manchester Guardian, \"Scotland should win narrowly.\"</p> <p>Sure enough, it was Bentley who got clear of Woodburn to score the only goal on 63 minutes, although Willie Bauld of Hearts did manage to hit the bar. As, it would appear, did some of Scotland's supporters after the game. \"Glasgow took the blow with fortitude,\" reported Donny Davies of this paper. \"Long before the midnight excursion trains were due to leave, the assembly hall of the Central Station was in an uproar. Informal bottle parties reeled and staggered across the hall, bandying chaff, blending choruses, and generally fighting the battle all over again. The English trippers, secure in the knowledge that no amount of Celtic eloquence could scrub out the result \u2026 took refuge in compassion. What the Scottish selectors will do remains to be seen. Rumour had it that they had gone into hiding.\"</p> <p>Scotland's captain, George Young of Rangers, begged the SFA to change their mind, and allow the team to travel to Rio. Despite \u2013 or perhaps as a result of \u2013 having England captain Billy Wright at his side also pleading Scotland's case, George Graham refused to budge. England travelled to Brazil alone, although look what happened there.</p> <p>All of which left Fifa with a lop-sided tournament of 13 teams. Having already drawn the groups, they didn't bother restructuring the finals, and so two groups of four, one group of three, and a group of two fought for a place in a final pool of four which made little sense \u2013 yet produced the greatest denouement in the history of All Football. So a complete casserole of codswallop from beginning to end, and yet the 1950 World Cup remains, by some distance, the greatest World Cup of all time. For Brazil's next trick in two years' time? Fifa should just pick 13 names out of a hat and go with the flow. Whoops, there goes that tournament!</p> <h2>2) Scotland 4-2 Spain (World Cup Uefa Group Nine, May 1957)</h2> <p>Still, perhaps Graham had done Scotland some sort of queer favour. The SFA wised up \u2013 well, OK, but it's all relative \u2013 and four years after that particular debacle they accepted an offer to compete in the 1954 tournament as a result of coming second in that year's home championship. They travelled to Switzerland, and had their arses skelped 7-0 by the world champions Uruguay, their manager, Andy Beattie, having packed his suitcase and fled after losing the first match against Austria.</p> <p>However another tournament on, and here came proof that Scotland could compete with the big boys. This was their first proper qualification game, in a group outside a home championship, and it looked like a mismatch rather than a match. The Scots had never played Spain before, and you could have forgiven their players for Doing A Beattie before the game. The home side consisted of players from modest clubs such as Clyde, Charlton Athletic, Blackpool and Second Division Liverpool. Spain were packed to the gunnels with stars from Barcelona and Real Madrid, the latter recently having brought themselves to British attention with a televised win over Manchester United in the new European Cup. Their forward line featured Ladislao Kubala, Alfredo di St\u00e9fano, Luis Su\u00e1rez and Francisco Gento. Time to dip into the DC Thomson book of old-school exclamations: jings, crivvens, help ma boab.</p> <p>But a confident Scotland \u2013 who had to do without Alex Parker of Falkirk, the full-back having taken ill as a result of jabs given to him by the army \u2013 started strongly. Jackie Mudie opened the scoring after 22 minutes, Scotland giving the Spanish woodwork a thorough examination. Sammy Baird of Rangers hit the post, forcing keeper Antoni Ramallets to clear for a corner. From the set piece, Mudie hit the crossbar, but then headed home the rebound. Kubala bundled home a scrappy equaliser four minutes later, but Scotland regained the lead just before half-time when Tommy Ring of Clyde was bullied by the not-so-wee Ferran Olivella of Barcelona; John Hewie smacked home the resulting penalty.</p> <p>Spain upped their game, turning the screw with some \"unceremonious tackling\", according to the Guardian, but no little skill as well: Di Stefano released Su\u00e1rez with a backheel for a second equaliser just after the restart. The Spanish attempted to assert their authority \u2013 Younger's hands were warmed by a stinger from Gento, Miguel Gonz\u00e1lez put the ball in the net from an offside position, and \"the visitors again resorted to rough tackling\" \u2013 but Mudie scored again on 70 minutes after Bobby Collins had ripped the Spanish back line apart, and the Blackpool striker completed his hat-trick with 10 minutes remaining, tiki-taka-ing in pretty triangles with Gordon Smith before securing the victory.</p> <p>Spain would get their own back on Scotland a fortnight later, belting them 4-1 in Madrid, but their campaign had already been compromised by a draw with Switzerland. Scotland made no such mistake, beating the Swiss home and away, albeit in what would become their trademark nervous style, requiring a late offside goal at Hampden to make it to the finals at Spain's expense.</p> <h2>3) West Germany 3-2 Scotland (World Cup Uefa Group Seven, October 1969)</h2> <p>This was last chance saloon time for the Scots, although they hadn't done too much wrong in their attempts to qualify for Mexico 70. Drawn in a group with Austria, Cyprus and the 1966 runners-up West Germany, Bobby Brown's side had beaten the Austrians at home thanks to goals from Denis Law and Billy Bremner, put 13 goals past Cyprus home and away, and salvaged a late draw against the Germans at Hampden through Bobby Murdoch. By the time Scotland travelled to Hamburg for the return fixture, West Germany had recorded wins in all their other games, beating both Austria and Cyprus twice. But this impressive record had been gained with a modicum of fortune: Gerd M\u00fcller had scored an 88th-minute winner at home against Austria, and a 90th-minute winner away in Cyprus. What it all meant was, Scotland \u2013 who were still required to play (and win) in Austria \u2013 had to avoid defeat against Germany in order to keep at least hope of a play-off alive.</p> <p>\"Scotland defied all the conventions of modern international football,\" reported the legendary David Lacey after a tumultuous defeat that is remembered now principally for Tommy Gemmell toe-punting Helmut Haller up the jacksie in the cartoon style, arguably the greatest foul in the history of association football. But the match was a classic in its own right, Scotland giving it a proper go against much-fancied opposition. They took the lead through Jimmy Johnstone after three minutes and, though Klaus Fichtel equalised just before half time, did not lose heart. They hit the bar twice before M\u00fcller did what he did on the hour, and then drew level themselves through Alan Gilzean. Bremner, Eddie Gray and Peter Cormack were all mentioned in Lacey's dispatch as \"excelling in attack \u2026 switching the ball around effectively \u2026 Scottish chances came and went, and for every opening created by the Germans, the Scots would make three and waste two of them \u2026 these misses proved too costly.\"</p> <p>Haller was to do for the Scots. It was his through ball that released Reinhard Libuda to convert the winner on 79 minutes, and his clip on Gemmell's heels in the dying minutes that caused the big man to lose the place completely and execute a divine swish of retribution. Gemmell was sent off, the Scots destined to sit out the World Cup yet again. As things panned out, a demoralised team lost their final match against Austria anyway, but it's often forgotten now just how close they came to knocking out one of the greatest international sides of all time. Mexico 70 would have been a poorer tournament without the goals of M\u00fcller, the bravery of Franz Beckenbauer, Germany's matches against England and Italy and all that. But what would you have given to see Gemmell get stuck in against Pel\u00e9, Tost\u00e3o, G\u00e9rson et al?</p> <h2>4) Scotland 3-1 Czechoslovakia (World Cup Uefa Group Seven, September 1977)<br>5) Wales 0-2 Scotland (World Cup Uefa Group Seven, October 1977)</h2> <p>Scotland's most notorious appearance in a World Cup final was their ill-fated trip to Argentina in 1978, so it's appropriate that the qualifying campaign that got them there was one to match. Scotland had made it to the 1974 finals with a win at Hampden over Czechoslovakia in 1973, and really needed to repeat the trick four years later if they were to pip the Czechs and Wales to the 1978 event. Scotland had started the group slowly, losing 2-0 to the Czechs in Prague, Antonin Panenka scoring his first international goal since <em>that</em> penalty secured the European Nations Cup for his country four months earlier. The Scots then scraped past Wales, an own goal from Crystal Palace's Ian Evans deciding a poor match. With Wales having dispatched the Czechs 3-0 in Wrexham, Scotland really needed a similar result at Hampden, with an away fixture against Wales still to come.</p> <p>The Czechs may have been reigning European champions, and had that two-goal win in Prague to remember, but they were at something of a disadvantage when their Hampden visit came around. Mainly because they had to travel to the match by rail, as a result of an air strike. The last leg of the journey, across Britain, was of course the most hellish, the team having to take an overnight train from London to Glasgow. Needless to say, there were no sleeping facilities. They arrived, not to put too fine a point on it, knackered.</p> <p>Scotland took full advantage. \"Playing aggressive, well coordinated football before an ecstatic Hampden Park crowd,\" reported our man Lacey, \"Scotland shrugged off some early threatening gestures from Czechoslovakia and conquered them from the air in the loftiest fashion.\" Joe Jordan was the hero, nutting in a corner on 19 minutes, then clattering goalkeeper Pavol Michalik in a 50-50 aerial challenge to set up Asa Hartford for a tap-in. Events in the skies were truly conspiring to jigger the Czechs, and a spot of head tennis between Gordon McQueen and Sandy Jardine set up Kenny Dalglish for a third. Miroslav Gajdusek skelped in a late swerving drive, but the Scots held on without too much drama. \"Bring on Wales,\" the crowd chanted, before going home to wonder exactly how far Scotland could go in Argentina.</p> <p>They had to beat Wales first to guarantee their place, of course. Scotland were the hot favourites. They were the form horses, having won the 1977 Home Championship in some style \u2013 infamously busting up Wembley in the process \u2013 then played well on a summer tour to South America. And then the 3-1 win over the European champions. Wales, by comparison, had drawn 0-0 twice with Kuwait. Also, the Welsh FA had decided to stage the match at Anfield, eschewing home advantage in search of extra coin. The game effectively became another home match for the Scots, so many supporters travelled south to fill Liverpool's ground. \"This was supposed to be Wales's home game,\" reported Lacey, \"but the rueful look on the face of Terry Yorath, the Welsh captain, as he led his side out to noise that beat like fists on the eardrums said much.\"</p> <p>Wales started slowly, with Scotland winning a series of early corners. The Scots were denied a penalty kick when Joey Jones handled \u2013 Lacey called it a \"legitimate\" claim \u2013 and could easily have had another as Kenny Dalglish claimed to have been felled in the area by David Jones. But their luck was not in. Yet. Wales came back into the match, and on the hour should have gone ahead as John Toshack went clear with only Alan Rough to beat. But the Partick Thistle keeper turned the Welsh striker's shot on to the bar, and the tide turned once again. With 12 minutes to go, Willie Johnston sent a ball into the Welsh area. David Jones went up to challenge a header with Jordan, who punched the ball away. The referee, however, was convinced it was Jones who had handled, and pointed to the spot. After a full and frank exchange of views between the official and several Welsh players, Don Masson coolly slotted the penalty away, and Scotland had one foot in the finals.</p> <p>With five minutes to go, an unquestionably legal goal settled the argument, Dalglish heading a Martin Buchan centre home. Scotland were there, and Wales were out. \"None of my players handled it,\" sighed Wales boss Mike Smith after the game. \"There was a lot of different opinions in the dressing room about what happened.\" Jordan's take was that \"as far as I know, the ball did not touch me, I did not feel it, and was surprised when the penalty was given\". Ally MacLeod added: \" I think we should have had a penalty earlier. You lose some, you win some.\" Sensible words from the Scotland manager. They would be in short supply over the following months, as he whipped the country up into an unfortunate lather.</p> <h2>6) Scotland 2-0 France (World Cup Uefa Group Five, March 1989)</h2> <p>\"Scotland always qualify,\" joked Billy Connolly during his critical high-water mark An Audience With Billy Connolly, as he tried to recall the year he had performed for the Scottish squad as they relaxed ahead of a World Cup. It was a quip that raised a laugh in the mid 1980s, when Scotland did exactly that, but it would get a different kind of giggle now. Scotland haven't troubled a major finals since reaching the 1998 World Cup, their sixth appearance in seven attempts, during which they'd also finally made the European Championship finals, not once but twice. Salad days, even if they never did too much when they eventually got there.</p> <p>Unquestionably the side's greatest qualification victories in recent years came during the race for Euro 2008. They registered a surprise Hampden win over World Cup runners-up France, Gary Caldwell scrambling home, then won in Paris, James McFadden's long-range stunner silencing Thierry 'Tinytears' Henry, who had ungraciously issued some back-at-ours threats immediately after the final whistle at Hampden. Needless to say, France made it to the finals at Scotland's expense anyway, so Henry had the last laugh, but you've got to enjoy the good times when you can.</p> <p>It wasn't the first time Scotland had bothered the French in qualifying, though. Back in 1989, Michel Platini's team were favourites to escape from a group also containing the Scots, Yugoslavia, Norway and Cyprus. Scotland weren't supposed to be a threat at all, struggling for form under Andy Roxburgh, the SFA window-cleaner (Connolly again). But while Roxburgh's side weren't a totally convincing proposition, they were grinding out results \u2013 a 2-1 win in Norway had been followed by a 1-1 draw at Hampden against much-fancied Yugoslavia \u2013 and were expected to win their third game in Cyprus.</p> <p>They did that, but only just, going 2-1 down before Richard Gough scored twice, the second seven minutes into injury time. The close scrape seemed to galvanise Scotland as France came to town. \"They could be skinned for skill,\" worried our man Patrick Glenn ahead of the game, noting an opposing teamsheet teeming with star names: Jean-Pierre Papin, Laurent Blanc, Patrick Battiston, Manuel Amoros, Franck Sauz\u00e9e. But Scotland were up for the battle. After 29 bruising minutes, Maurice Johnson intercepted an Ally McCoist drive and guided the ball past Jo\u00ebl Bats. He added a second on 52 minutes, heading straight at \u2013 and through \u2013 the hapless Bats.</p> <p>It was the decisive blow in the campaign. Scotland stumbled over the line, following up with a 2-1 struggle over Cyprus, defeats in Yugoslavia and France (who had by now called Didier Deschamps and Eric Cantona into the team) and a nervy 1-1 draw at home to Norway which saw them seal their place in Italy. Scotland had broken a world record \u2013 they had become the first country to successfully negotiate five successive qualification processes. Not bad for the window cleaner. But then, Scotland always qualify. Don't they?</p>",
  "<p>In 2005, Jeremiah Makori was asleep in his home in Nairobi's Deep Sea slum when he heard a voice outside.</p> <p>\"We went to sleep as usual, and at midnight I heard a strange voice outside, [saying] move out and save your lives,\" he said. He rushed outside with his nightclothes on, carrying his two sons, and watched his home disappear. \"It was all demolished. We lost everything.\"</p> <p>Makori had lived in the slum since 1998, having left his home in rural western Kenya to look for work in the city.</p> <p>Although Deep Sea has since been rebuilt, Makori, who was in Naples this week at the World Urban Forum (WUF), said the threat of eviction still looms: a new road project that would cut through the slum is on the cards, and it's unclear what will happen to those who live there.</p> <p>The population of Deep Sea has doubled over the past 15 years, he says, estimating its size at 15,000. There is no official record of who lives in the slum, but community organisers are conducting their own census. The hope is that collecting detailed information on the lives and livelihoods of those in Deep Sea will protect them from any further evictions.</p> <p>Over the past 20 years, it's become a common strategy for slum dwellers around the world to conduct surveys of their settlements to raise the profile of their communities.</p> <p>Earlier this year, the journal Environment and Urbanisation <a href=\"http://eau.sagepub.com/content/current\" title=\"\">honed in on this trend with a series of case studies</a>. In Old Fadama, in central Accra, Ghana, a community survey revealed a much larger population than government estimates, discouraging authorities from pushing through eviction orders. In Cape Town, a similar survey of the Joe Slavo settlement showed the opposite \u2013 far fewer numbers than expected \u2013 showing it would be easier and quicker to \"upgrade\" the settlement than to move it. <a href=\"http://www.sdinet.org/\" title=\"\">Shack/Slum Dwellers International</a>, an umbrella group of local federations of people living in informal settlements, founded in 1996, has now developed an extensive set of tools and methods to help residents survey and map their communities.</p> <p>\"These surveys started as a way to stop evictions but have become a key tool to support community-led upgrading in informal settlements,\" says David Satterthwaite, senior fellow in the human settlements group at the London-based thinktank the International Institute for Environment and Development (IIED). These surveys involve the community sitting down together, walking through the settlement numbering each house, and using enumeration as a tool to identify and address their own priorities.</p> <p>It's often quoted that more than 1 billion people live in slums around the world. But informal settlements are typically \"invisible\" in government statistics, and no one really knows how many people live in areas like these. The surveys conducted by communities often produce the first detailed data on these settlements, their residents, the quality of housing, infrastructure, and services.</p> <p>Satterthwaite, who has spent decades working with civil society groups on urban issues, helped organise a session on \"documentation by the undocumented\" at the WUF. \"The detail you get is amazing. In terms of surveys, I expect these are the most detailed, accurate, and insightful \u2013 far better than those of any research organisation,\" he insists. \"These are the experts producing data that no one else could.\"</p> <p>Sarah Nandudu, of the Ugandan Slum Dwellers' Federation, said community-led surveys in her country had helped to pave the way for better relationships between slum dwellers and the government. \"Before, they didn't have any reason to sit with us.\"</p> <p>For Parveen Shaikh, from the Indian Slum Dwellers Federation, conducting a survey is just as much about understanding her community. \"We asked: where are the trees? The toilets? The mosque?... This also helped us to get to know our community very well. Who lives in house number 100, for example?\" Unlike city officials, she said, the community was highly attentive to detail. \"We wanted information about us to be accurate.\"</p> <p>Satterthwaite says these local efforts to document and map informal settlements are symbolic of how members of poor urban communities are best-placed to offer solutions to problems that affect them, but these efforts are not fully recognised.</p> <p>He says the UN human settlements programme (<a href=\"http://www.unhabitat.org\" title=\"\">UN-Habitat</a>), which organised the WUF, is one of the few UN bodies to recognise the role of local governments. But in terms of working with community groups, \"it's almost going backwards. There's even less recognition now of the really pioneering work and partnerships by civil society.\" Civil society and representatives of the urban poor shouldn't just get time to speak at the forum, he says, they should also be on the organising committee, defining the programme and deliberating on the conference's themes.</p> <p>For Makori, it's also time for the state to step in and ensure there is sufficient low-cost housing. He moved to Deep Sea, he said, because the money he made working as a watchman was not enough to rent a house. \"Because of its failures, it [the state] is now shifting the blame to the poor,\" he said. \"They call us criminals, but the people who live in Deep Sea are the security guards, the watchmen, the maids, the office cleaners.\"</p>",

The machines were relatively simple to use: inserting your memory card; viewing and editing your pictures (including red eye and cropping) via the touch screen; choosing the ones you want processed and selecting the size and finish (matt or gloss) before taking a receipt to the till.</p> <p><strong>Best bargain</strong> \u00a318 for 100 6\"x4\" photos.</p> <p><strong>What does it charge?</strong> 30 6\"x4\" photos, \u00a39.60; 30 7\"x5\" photos, \u00a313.80 \u2013 both processed in about an hour. A CD with your pictures on it was \u00a34.99 and passport photos were \u00a37.99.</p> <p><strong>Where can I pay?</strong> There was a counter at the front of the store and I didn't have to wait to pay as there was only other customer.</p> <p><strong>Lasting impressions</strong> The shop had plenty to offer the individual who likes to use their photos in imaginative ways, including clocks, jigsaws and mugs. The service was fast and efficient with no attempt made to sell me products I didn't want. When I returned to collect my photos the salesperson was helpful when I couldn't find my proof of purchase slip which I had managed to lose, though the opening photo of me with a cheesy grin did provide perfect ID.</p> <p><strong>Overall rating</strong> 7.5/10.</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.jessops.com/\" title=\"\">Jessops</a></h2> <p><strong>Background</strong> Frank Jessop opened his first store in Leicester in 1935. There are now more than 200 branches and an online shop. Frank's son Alan sold the firm in 1996 in a management buyout, and the company is now a subsidiary of Snap Equity Limited.</p> <p><strong>The visit</strong> 10.30am, 30 August 2012, Reading.</p> <p><strong>What it sells</strong> Photo prints, cameras and accessories.</p> <p><strong>First impressions</strong> This branch is on the same parade as Snappy Snaps, though in a less prominent position. It's a relatively small store with a good display of cameras in the centre, both in and on a glass cabinet, and down the right-hand side of the store. Most of the accessories were towards the back.</p> <p><strong>What were the staff like?</strong> Very helpful at first, explaining how to use the processing and printing machines. But when I needed help later on the shop had suddenly got busy with six people waiting to be served and only two assistants, one in the back room presumably processing pictures. After almost 10 minutes of trying to make eye contact the person who had previosuly helped me looked at me with a manic but polite expression, gesturing that he would be with me in a minute. When he did come he apologised for the wait and answered my queries.</p> <p><strong>Best bargain</strong> \u00a39.99 for some passport photos with 50 free 6\"x4\" prints.</p> <p><strong>What does it charge?</strong> 30 7\"x5\" photos within 25 minutes (or your money back), \u00a315; within 1 hour, \u00a310.80; within 24-hours, \u00a39.30. A CD of the photos was \u00a33. Jessops claims it will match its rivals' prices on cameras, accessories and digital photographs.</p> <p><strong>Where can I pay?</strong> A till in the centre of the store.</p> <p><strong>Is loyalty rewarded?</strong> I received a voucher as I paid for my photos for 20% off canvas prints, though I spotted a poster outside promoting 25% off.</p> <p><strong>Lasting impressions</strong> A good, modern store that was cheaper than Snappy Snaps. The reason for me asking for assistance in Jessops was a message on the editing machine warning that the photos I had chosen for processing were not suitable for 7\"x5\" prints as the resolution was not good enough. I chose to override this and the photos were indeed a little bit grainy, so they were right to warn me. However, with Snappy Snaps the exact same pictures seemed better quality.</p> <p><strong>Overall rating</strong> 7/10.</p> <h2>Last week</h2> <p>When <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/money/2012/aug/31/store-wars-asda-morrisons\" title=\"Store Wars: Asda and Morrisons\">Asda took on Morrisons in the battle of the supermarkets</a> there was a clear winner: the latter netted 59% of your votes.

  "<h2>ECUADOR</h2> <h2>Hotel Gabeal, Mompiche</h2> <p>The modest fishing village of Mompiche is turning into a small backpacker hub thanks to perfect surfing conditions and an impressive setting with thickly forested hills dropping down to a wide beach backed by palm trees. While package tourists are attracted to the glitzy Decameron Hotel on the hill, budget travellers stay in town. For experienced surfers, Mompiche offers one of the biggest left point breaks in South America and attracts surfers from around the world in high season (December to April). Alternatively, go horse riding or hiking in the forests of Mache Chindul Reserve inland. The friendliest place to stay on the edge of town is Gabeal with two tall, wooden buildings. The cheaper rooms overlook the sea and the pricier rooms in the building further back are more spacious with hot water and air-con. <br>\u2022 <a href=\"http://mompiche.wordpress.com\" title=\"\"><em>mompiche.wordpress.com</em></a><em>, +593 9 969 6543, doubles $10-25pp (\u00a36-16), camping $4pp</em></p> <h2>Playa Escondida, Tonchig\u00fce</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396368658\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/pictures/2012/9/6/1346946709377/Playa-Escondida-Tonchigue-008.jpg\" alt=\"Playa Escondida, Tonchigue, Ecuador\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Playa Escondida, Tonchigue, Ecuador</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The north is the most attractive stretch of Ecuador's coast with scores of beautiful beaches backed by tropical forest. While most locals head to heaving party town Atacames or overpriced exclusive resorts in Same (pronounced Sahmay), those in the know seek out more secluded spots. Canadian-run Playa Escondida is true to its name (hidden beach) \u2013 this ecological getaway built with natural materials and composting toilets is set on 34 hectares of forest behind a deserted beach overlooked by cliffs. Nearby rock formations, caves and tunnels provide a little adventure. Choose from rustic cabins or camping, and the restaurant will keep you happy with a wide range of seafood, meat and vegetarian dishes. <br>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.playaescondida.com.ec\" title=\"\"><em>playaescondida.com.ec</em></a><em>, +593 6 273 3106/3122, $12-18pp (low season), $20-36 per room (high season), camping $5pp</em></p> <h2>Hotel Bambu, Canoa</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396368659\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/pictures/2012/9/6/1346941051186/Canoa-Manabi-Ecuador--006.jpg\" alt=\"Canoa, Manabi, Ecuador \" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Canoa beach, Ecuador.

It gets busy in high season but is pleasantly quiet the rest of the year. Canoa's surf is consistently good and it's a dramatic setting with waves crashing upon a long beach overlooked by cliffs and caves to the north. Firm backpacker favorite Hotel Bambu has accommodation to suit all budgets \u2013 from camping to basic rooms with shared bath and more comfortable mid-range lodgings with sea views and private bath. The restaurant/bar is a good place to hang out with daily happy hour, a wide range of cocktails, hammocks, ping pong and delicious crepes. <br>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.hotelbambuecuador.com\" title=\"\"><em>hotelbambuecuador.com</em></a><em>, +593 5 258 8017, double rooms $18-30</em></p> <h2>Hostal Coco Bongo, Bahia de Caraquez</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396368660\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/pictures/2012/9/6/1346946571677/Hostal-Coco-Bongo-Bahia-d-008.jpg\" alt=\"Hostal Coco Bongo, Bahia de Caraquez, Ecuador\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hostal Coco Bongo, Bahia de Caraquez, Ecuador</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Most of Ecuador's coastal cities are far from aesthetically pleasing, but eco-city Bahia de Caraquez is the exception \u2013 it's quiet with a spectacular location perched on a sand peninsula jutting from the mouth of the River Chone into the Pacific. Until the late 19th century this used to be Ecuador's biggest port. The streets are clean thanks to a comprehensive recycling program, and many residents shun cars in favor of bicycles, including taxis. The best budget option is Hostal Coco Bongo run by friendly Aussie Suzanne Butson. Overlooking the park, this converted house has rooms with hot water, private bath, WiFi and cable TV. It's a good place to hang out with fellow travellers and the breakfasts are very good.<br>\u2022 <em>Intriagi and Arenas, </em><a href=\"http://www.cocobongohostal.com\" title=\"\"><em>cocobongohostal.com</em></a><em>, +593 8 544 0978, dorms $6pp, doubles $20-25</em></p> <h2>Hosteria Mandala, Puerto Lopez</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396368661\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/pictures/2012/9/6/1346946508940/Hosteria-Mandala-Puerto-L-008.jpg\" alt=\"Hosteria Mandala, Puerto Lopez, Ecuador\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hosteria Mandala, Puerto Lopez, Ecuador</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Puerto Lopez sits at the centre of Machalilla, Ecuador's only coastal national park, in a wide bay surrounded by green hills crowned with candelabra cacti. This is the best base to explore nearby Los Frailes, arguably Ecuador's most beautiful beach. Another popular excursion is Isla de la Plata, known as the \"poor man's Galapagos\" for its blue-footed boobies and other birdlife. From June to September, the region hosts scores of humpback whales and boat trips to watch them are a must. The best-known accommodation in town is Hosteria Mandala, which has cabins set among dense, tropical gardens. The German and Italian owners have painstakingly decorated each cabin with unique designs. There's also a good restaurant serving homemade bread and ice-cream plus a music room and library upstairs. <br>\u2022 <em>Malecon, </em><a href=\"http://www.hosteriamandala.info\" title=\"\"><em>hosteriamandala.info</em></a><em>, +593 5 230 0181, rooms and cabins $31-49pp</em></p> <h2>Hosteria La Barquita, Puerto Rico</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396368662\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/pictures/2012/9/6/1346946403911/Hosteria-La-Barquita-Puer-008.jpg\" alt=\"Hosteria La Barquita, Puerto Rico, Ecuador\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hosteria La Barquita, Puerto Rico, Ecuador</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Splendid isolation makes tiny Puerto Rico an attractive alternative base to busier Puerto Lopez, and the best accommodation option is Hosteria La Barquita. The boat-shaped restaurant provides its name (little boat), and the Swiss owners are very hands-on with plenty of helpful advice. There is a swimming pool plus a tree-house and adventure playground frequented by the owners' children. The boat theme is reprised in the cabins with porthole mirrors, rounded doors and natural stone locks. Choose from simple rooms to new suites with air-con and cable TV.

It's a little pocket of heaven if you like being surrounded by bare-chested, long-haired surfers and their tanned girlfriends. Like other backpacker hubs, you'll either love it or hate it, but the infectious energy of the place is undeniable. However, you must stay outside town if you want to get any sleep after riding the waves and partying til dawn. Away from the crowds, north, towards the point is Casa del Sol, run by a Californian surfer. The rooms are well-equipped, many with sea views, there is a yoga studio and the reggae bar and restaurant are great hangouts.

Playa Blanca Bungalows has 12 thathed-roof bungalows that open directly on to the beach. Activities offered include surf classes, sport fishing and daytrips to Peru's only mangrove forests, near the Ecuadorian border. They also have a full kitchen service, offering international and Peruvian cuisine, with the highlight of the menu being ceviche, a marinated fish salad.

Surprisingly, Punta Hermosa is under served by good hotels. But the best of the crop is Casa Barco, with 25 simple, clean, whitewashed rooms. A five-minute walk from the beach, it offers a pool and full kitchen service. Punta Hermosa's numerous breaks are fast, powerful and no place for beginners.

  "<p>Britons spent \u00a31.1bn on ice cream and other frozen treats in the past year. Sure, some will point out that actual consumption has fallen by about 27 million litres over the past five years \u2013 most of the rise in gelato-based spending is down to the fact that it's just getting more expensive \u2013 but it's still a startling amount of money. And we're eating a lot more frozen yoghurt, up by 50% in the past two years, although, perhaps surprisingly given the extent to which we are otherwise embracing the frozen dessert market, Britons are going cold on sorbet, with sales falling by 17% over the same period. In all, our annual outlay on frozen treats amounts to about 10% of the government transport budget, and a little bit more than the annual spend on primary education. At \u00a3400m a year, the government spends approximately the same amount on fuel and energy each year as its subjects do on vanilla ice cream alone. Do you think it's time we had a little look at our priorities?</p> <p>On Thursday it was warm across most of the nation. Thermometers hit 22.2C in Cavendish, Suffolk, while Aberporth in Wales enjoyed 12.1 hours of constant sunshine. There can be no other explanation for the utter dearth of transfer gossip in Friday's newspapers, and the coincidental release on Thursday of a detailed report into the nation's ice-cream-scoffing habits, than that the nation's leading gossip-inventors had collectively sodded off to sit in the sunshine, put their feet up and munch Magnums, cram Cornettos and, er, feast on Feasts. And so it is that after a thorough perusal of the nation's leading newspapers <strong>the Mill's rumour list starts with the supposed interest of the Sheffield United manager, Danny Wilson, in Everton's Magaye Gueye</strong> <strong>and ends with the supposed interest of the Sheffield United manager, Danny Wilson, in Derby's Ben Davies</strong>. That's it. Though we hear that Fulham are to send 20-year-old Swiss midfielder Pajtim Kasami out on loan. \"Kasami is a youngster and if everyone is sound and well he won't start, he knows that,\" said Martin Jol. \"That's a bit of a problem with him because he wants to play all the time.\"</p> <p>Elsewhere, the Mirror reports the shock news that <strong>James McClean is being coached by his coach</strong>. \"I'm not perfect and I want to improve my game,\" he said. \"If you have someone working with you, it can only help.\" And <strong>former Bristol City ace Ion Testemitanu, now Moldova's assistant coach, has slammed English football's materialistic culture</strong>, and described how he was literally forced to buy his clothes at Armani when he was Blighty-based. \"For our players money is not so important,\" he said. \"In England, players and people think about money. We are not a very rich country.\"</p> <p><strong>The rapper Example has told the world about his experience at the Olympics, when he had his car nicked by Steven Gerrard</strong>. Strictly speaking it wasn't his car, in that he didn't own it in any way, but it was a car that Example, who you may remember from his 2010 top-three smash Kickstarts, had been expecting to sit in but never did. \"Me and [fellow rapper] Wretch 32 arrived and were waiting for a car to get transferred to the stadium. You have to drive through eight security gates. It's pretty mental,\" explained an exasperated Example, who together with his companion was quite literally the last one standing (this is a play on the title of his 2010 disappointing follow-up Last Ones Standing, which reached only No27. Thought we might have to explain that). \"Stevie just walks in front of us and nicks our car. Later he came up to me and said: 'Nice to meet you.' The first thing I said was: 'Oi, you nicked my car!' He just laughed and said: 'What did you expect? I'm from Liverpool.'\"</p> <p>Oi, Gerrard, we do the jokes round here.</p> <p>In news that it's hard to joke about and so we won't, QPR midfielder Samba Diakit\u00e9, who cost \u00a33.5m when he signed from Nancy in the summer and started the club's first two games of the season, has returned to France as he battles a bout of depression.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Your new children's book, Ratburger, obviously features ratburgers but, at the end of the book, and even more disgusting burger is made.

What's your favourite ice-cream flavour (real or invented)?</strong></p> <p>My favourite real flavour is tutti frutti as I used to have that at my grandad's house. You often associate a flavour of something with a person and, for me, tutti frutti is all about happy childood memories. I love banoffi pie and probably someone has made a banoffi pie ice cream and I'd love to taste that. Really, anything with fudge or chocolate and banoffi pie would be great, though there's a risk I may never ever get up again if I did get that \u2013 I'd just have to sit there eating it all day.

What were your school days like?</strong></p> <p>They were pleasant enough. There are always teachers you like and teachers you don't like. I did have a metalwork teacher who used to pay me not to talk in his lessons. It was a double period so I got 50p if I didn't speak for an hour and a half. Sometimes I forgot and started speaking and had to give the money back. It was his only solution, he found me so irritating. I was lucky that I went to nice schools and I was allowed to flourish. It's important that your teachers help you find what you are good at and let you concentrate on that.</p> <p>At my primary school there was a very fearsome dinner lady called Mrs Pierce and she used to have a big metal spoon and would say \"I'll rap your knuckles faster that you can say Jack Spratt\" if you turned your nose up at her food. One day it was stewed peaches for lunch, which I hated, and, too scared to leave them or spit them out, I stored them in the side of my mouth, like a hamster, until I got home!</p> <p><strong>What was the last book that you read?</strong></p> <p>Dial M for Murdoch while on holiday. I really enjoyed it, it's brilliantly researched. The last kids' book I read was The Enormous Crocodile to nephew, who is six, when he had a sleepover at my house. I loved reading it and putting on the voices of the animals and he was giggling throughout. He calls me \"silly uncle David\", which is about right. </p> <p><strong>Which fictional character would you most like to be?</strong></p> <p>I got to play Mr Pumblechook in the new film of Great Expectations so probably a Dickens character. The great role is Miss Haversham but I'm not sure I'd want to be her. The Artful Dodger! He's a loveable rogue. As a child when you read the book or see the films, you definitely want to be him and that's the role you want to play too - you don't want to play Oliver, he was boring. The Artful Dodger is kind of glamorous and spends all day out robbing instead of going to school.</p> <p><strong>Which fictional character could you fall in love with?</strong></p> <p>Lara in Dr Zhivago. My wife is named after her. It's one of the great love stories. Stories about lost love are always the best, somehow.</p> <p><strong>Which book do you think everybody should read?</strong></p> <p>People tend to forget to read poetry because it seems a bit boring but you can't go wrong with Larkin - Whitsun Weddings or Collected Poems. I find that reading poetry before I go to bed is very enriching because poems are sometimes like dreams in the way they unfold and the connections they make. If you haven't read any poetry recently then Larkin is a good place to start as he's a sublime poet and his imagery isn't too flowery and offputting and he tells you how it is. And he gives you a huge sense of himself in a way that modern poets often don't do. He tends to reveal a side of himself that's not necessarily a nice side. I find that very brave.</p> <p><strong>Where do you most like to read?</strong></p> <p>On holiday \u2013 it's the only place where you are not disturbed which is the best thing about reading. You can devour it. On my last holiday I read The End by Ian Kershaw about the last days of Hitler's Germany and raced through it in a couple of days because it's so compelling. I also read Gitta Sereny's biography of Albert Speer - His Battle with Truth. It's one of the great biographies of all time, a really rich and fascinating read. </p> <p><strong>Where do you most like to write?</strong></p> <p>In my office, which sounds a bit boring. I wrote one of my children's books \u2013 Billionaire Boy \u2013 while making a film in LA and because they keep you waiting so long I could write a lot in my dressing room. There was one time, though, when I got so engrossed in the writing that when they finally knocked on the door I said \"I just have to finish this chapter before I can come out\u2026\" forgetting who was paying me\u2026 That's the ideal, though \u2013 being paid to be in the film and at the same time writing a book in the quiet times. </p> <p><strong>What one piece of advice would you give to aspiring writers?</strong></p> <p>It's more about ideas than necessarily how you write - have great and original ideas and you can work on making them work on the page. Spelling, grammar and punctuation are important but you can work on getting those right. If you have a brilliant idea, that's ultimately more compelling than something that's spelt correctly. The ideas are what people respond to. Oh and a great title always grabs you. Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is one of the great titles - you think \"that sounds like I will like that because I do like chocolate\u2026\" A great title and original idea. It's easier said than done but they are still out there.</p> <p><strong>What is the weirdest thing a fan has ever said and/or given to you? </strong></p> <p>An old lady came up at a signing and said \"we've got something in common. We've both swum the channel\". <br>\"Congratulations!\" I said. \"How did you find it - cold?\" <br>\"Oh, I did it in a swimming pool,\" she replied. <br>\"That's still a tough distance to do in one go,\" I said. \"How long did it take you?\"<br>\"Oh, I did it over a series of weeks...\" <br>She was so adamant that we had something in common \u2013 that we had both been swimming. <br>Kids ask questions which is good and they are always interesting. They tend to want to know why I made certain choices, having a character die at the end, for example. They also want to know \"where I get my ideas from\". <br>We can all have ideas. As children we all know how to play and when you play you are inventing characters and scenarios. To me, writing a book is an extension of playing \u2013 playing in your mind. It's fun but also work - you are changing it all the time, you make big mistakes, go down routes that are not useful. You start books and abandon them - it can be a tough process. I always think, what's the most unexpected thing that can happen now? When get to a certain place, what's the most surprising thing? And that helps me to focus \u2013 you don't want to know what the end of a story is when you start reading it. It's got to be unexpected. </p> <p><strong>Can you tell us a joke please?</strong></p> <p>Knock knock.<br>Who's there?<br>David Walliams.<br>David Walliams who?<br>That's showbiz!</p> <p><strong>Does Piers Morgan know that he appears just above rats (and below farts) on your list of most unloved things in Ratburger?</strong></p> <p>He doesn't know yet but I'm sure someone will tweet him about it. I think he enjoys being disliked and will take it as a badge of honour. I've met him and get on with him but I like to put in some jokes for adults reading the book and it was ludicrously easy to decide it was going to be him.</p> <h2>Win tickets to see David Walliams and signed books</h2> <p>On Thursday 13 September at 6pm, David Walliams will be premiering his new book, Ratburger, at Cadogan House in London. <a href=\"http://www.cadoganhall.com/event/david-walliams-ratburger-book-premiere/\">Full details</a>.</p> <p>We've got two pairs of tickets and one full set of signed books to give away.

  "<h2>New managers making their bow</h2> <p>As is typical of any fresh competitive cycle, this weekend's round of 2014 World Cup qualifiers has a host of managers taking charge of their first meaningful international matches, including Didier Deschamps with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/france\" title=\"\">France</a>, Igor Stimac with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/croatia\" title=\"\">Croatia</a> and, of particular intrigue, Fabio Capello with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/russia\" title=\"\">Russia</a>. Also worth keeping an eye on is Louis van Gaal, who is in charge of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/holland\" title=\"\">Holland</a> (they face Turkey in Amsterdam on Friday) 10 years after he left the national team post.</p> <h2>David Villa's comeback</h2> <p>Injury is most cruel to the player it affects, but it can also be damaging for the spectator, depriving them as it does of the joy of seeing a talented performer in action. This has certainly been the case where Villa is concerned. He was sidelined for eight months \u2013 a spell that took in Euro 2012 \u2013 after breaking his leg playing for Barcelona at last December's Club World Cup. But Villa, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/spain\" title=\"\">Spain</a>'s all-time leading scorer with 51 goals in 82 games, is back and poised to feature for Vicente Del Bosque's side in their friendly with Saudi Arabia on Friday and World Cup qualifier against Georgia four days later.</p> <h2>Germany getting going again</h2> <p>It remains the major surprise of Euro 2012 that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/germany\" title=\"\">Germany</a>, a side that appeared to have perfectly combined robustness in defence with ruthlessness in attack, lost their semi-final against Italy. From the outside it appeared Joachim L\u00f6w's men froze, and many neutrals were left disappointed at being denied the chance to see Germany face Spain in what had the potential to be a mouth-watering final. Thankfully, L\u00f6w's side are back in competitive action \u2013 they face the Faroe Islands on Friday \u2013 and, with players such as Borussia Dortmund's exciting young midfielder Marco Reus expected to start the game in Hanover, we could be in store for more of the same exhilarating stuff.</p> <h2>Cristiano Ronaldo's return to happy mode</h2> <p>The question dominating European football discussion this past week has been: \"What's eating Cristiano?\" The man who has it all claimed to be sad following Real Madrid's recent win against Granada and stated people inside the club know why. Cue much rolling of eyes and the belief that Ronaldo is not happy earning only \u00a310m a year at the Bernab\u00e9u, something he has flatly denied. Whatever the case, Ronaldo should be in a better mood when he leads <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/portugal\" title=\"\">Portugal</a> out against Luxembourg on Friday. He may even smile when he scores.</p> <h2>Steven Gerrard and Frank Lampard trying to play together</h2> <p>Yes, this again. We are on to manager No4 and Roy Hodgson, just like Sven-Goran Eriksson, Steve McClaren and Fabio Capello, feels he can get the two midfielders functioning together. Past experiences, in a period where Lampard and Gerrard have racked up 187 caps between them and included more disappointments than any <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/england\" title=\"\">England</a> fan can bear to remember, suggest this is impossible, but being the arch-pragmatist Hodgson is expected to give it a go for the match in Moldova. Most likely, they will play in a three-man midfield alongside Michael Carrick.</p> <h2>Belgium proving their brilliance</h2> <p>Thibaut Courtois, Vincent Kompany, Thomas Vermaelen, Steven Defour, Axel Witsel, Moussa Demb\u00e9l\u00e9, Eden Hazard, Marouane Fellaini \u2026 how could a team containing players as talented as these fail to qualify for Euro 2012? Technically, it was because they finished third in a group containing Germany and Turkey, but the volatile nature of a squad full of growing egos lay at the heart of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/belgium\" title=\"\">Belgium</a>'s fundamental failings. The new manager, Marc \"War Pig\" Wilmots, is determined to prevent that resurfacing as Belgium set out to qualify for Brazil. All going well, they should sparkle in Group A, which begins with a trip to Wales on Friday.</p> <h2>Wales showing what they have to offer</h2> <p>The match in Cardiff also provides the hosts with an opportunity to shine. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/wales\" title=\"\">Wales</a> have lost both of their friendlies under Chris Coleman, against Mexico and Bosnia-Herzegovina, but this remains a talented squad, one that was on an upward curve under the guidance of the late Gary Speed. Any team that can call upon Joe Allen, Aaron Ramsey, Gareth Bale and Craig Bellamy should provide an attacking threat and they will be looking to prove that against Belgium before the match away to Serbia four days later.</p> <h2>South American showdowns</h2> <p>The seventh and eight rounds of Conmebol qualifying also take place this weekend and, as ever, there are some intriguing contests on offer. Copa Am\u00e9rica champions <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/uruguay\" title=\"\">Uruguay</a>, who lie second in the nine-team qualifying group, face <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/colombia\" title=\"\">Colombia</a> in Barranquilla, while third-placed <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/argentina\" title=\"\">Argentina</a> take on <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/paraguay\" title=\"\">Paraguay</a> in C\u00f3rdoba. Victory for Uruguay would mean they replaced Chile at the top of the table (Chile face Colombia themselves on Tuesday), while anything else would allow Argentina to rise to the summit providing they win themselves.</p> <h2>James McCarthy's Irish audition</h2> <p>Does the inclusion of James McCarthy, albeit somewhat forced by the unavailability of Keith Andrews, suggest Giovanni Trapattoni genuinely intends to adjust an approach that has led to bad performances and a negative atmosphere in and around the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/republicofireland\" title=\"\">Republic of Ireland</a> squad? Probably not, but it will be fascinating to see if the Wigan player can do enough for the team against Kazakhstan to change this most stubborn of minds.</p> <h2>All Whites attempt to erase their blushes</h2> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/newzealand\" title=\"\">New Zealand</a> fans often boast that their team were the only unbeaten side at the 2010 World Cup. They are not so voluble about the All Whites' performance at this summer's Oceania Nations Cup \u2026 <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-cAyLRrA4Y\" title=\"\">where they were humiliated in the semi-final by New Caledonia</a>. On Friday, the countries meet again in a World Cup qualifier and New Zealand, who welcome back Ryan Nelsen and Winston Reid, are desperate for redemption. \"The emotion that came out of the Nations Cup is something that'll be around for a long time,\" admitted the New Zealand manager Ricki Herbert. \"It would be disappointing if people didn't have a strong feeling about it and want to put it right.\"</p>"
