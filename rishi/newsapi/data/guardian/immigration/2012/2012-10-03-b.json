  "<p>Sometime in the last decade, coleslaw, so familiar a fixture of every Boxing Day buffet and summer picnic, has been rebranded. And every time I see a <a href=\"http://www.sabotagetimes.com/life/food-porn-37-other-foodie-words-that-make-me-choke/\">\"slaw\"</a> sitting chirpily on the menu, a grumpy, Victor Meldrew-like surge of irritation courses through me. The Berni Inn salad bar never called it slaw. My dad never put ham and slaw sandwiches in our picnics. If it doesn't have cabbage in it then it's not coleslaw: it's a salad. End of rant.</p> <p>Making myself even more comfortable in pedants' corner, coleslaw is a corruption of the Dutch <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=12570289\">koolsla</a>, meaning cabbage salad, and arrived here via the USA. Cabbage was, according to the Oxford Encylopedia of Food and Drink in America, a popular crop \"throughout the colonies\", and Dutch settlers, who grew it \"extensively along the Hudson River\" liked to serve it in the familiar, old-country way: the first mention of coleslaw in the USA dates from 1785.</p> <p>Early versions seem only to have used a vinaigrette, but mayonnaise now seems to be the standard dressing, in Britain at least \u2013 preferably the <a href=\"http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/features/2011/1108/1224307203210.html\">gloopy</a> sugary kind that smothers all other flavours, leaving you unsure whether you're eating cabbage or carrot. The occasional chunks of raw onion, however, usually make themselves known. Perhaps, thinking about it, this explains the rebranding exercise. But I'm determined to make coleslaw cool again. Or, at least, nice.</p> <h2>The cabbage: crucifer rising</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397224953\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/3/1349274670365/Constance-Spry-recipe-col-002.jpg\" alt=\"Constance Spry recipe coleslaw\" width=\"220\" height=\"132\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Constance Spry recipe coleslaw. Photograph: Felicity Cloake</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Felicity Cloake</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>White cabbages rather than green are favoured, probably because of their superior crunch, although Constance Spry reckons that completely white cabbages have a \"particularly sweet and nutty flavour\". Valentine Warner uses a mixture of white and red in his recipe in <a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9781845335403\">The Good Table</a>, which looks very striking \u2013 a Cooks Illustrated recipe suggests red or green, so I use all red, but find the flavour too sweet.</p> <p>Constance suggests immersing the shredded cabbage in ice cold water, preferably overnight, before use. I wonder if this is to perk up an old timer or even to dull the cabbage's slightly sulphurous flavour: either way, I can't see it makes much difference to the finished dish. Cooks Illustrated salts their cabbage until it wilts, then rinses and pats dry before use. This softens it pretty effectively, but I like a bit of crunch \u2013 as long as you've shredded it finely enough, you should be able to use it straight away.</p> <p>I, however, am not going to. Simon Hopkinson and Lindsey Bareham, writing in The Prawn Cocktail Years, marinate their cabbage in sugar, salt and vinegar for an hour, and then wring it out before use. This generates a surprising amount of liquid, but, more interestingly as far as I'm concerned, gives it a delicious but subtle tanginess.</p> <h2>The cut</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397224954\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/3/1349274993388/Prawn-Cocktail-Years-reci-002.jpg\" alt=\"Prawn Cocktail Years recipe coleslaw\" width=\"220\" height=\"132\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Prawn Cocktail Years recipe coleslaw. Photograph: Felicity Cloake</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Felicity Cloake</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Most recipes suggest shredding the cabbage finely, but Simon and Lindsey grate it \"on the finest shredding blade of a food processor\". Mine turns out rather mushy, although this could be the fault of my machine. In any case, unless you're making coleslaw for the 5,000, it's easier to chop it by hand, rather than giving yourself extra washing up by faffing about with machinery. (In the interests of fairness, I must add here that one of my housemates actively enjoys the slightly pre-masticated texture, and commandeers the whole lot for her packed lunch.)</p> <p>Valentine Warner, who, like almost all the recipes I try (Constance Spry being the only cabbage purist) uses carrot in his coleslaw, suggests peeling it into thin slices, and then cutting these into strips to match the cabbage. It's a bit more time-consuming than getting out the grater, but, both visually and texturally, the results are far more pleasing.</p> <h2>The dressing</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397224955\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/3/1349274759890/Claudia-Roden-recipe-cole-002.jpg\" alt=\"Claudia Roden recipe coleslaw\" width=\"220\" height=\"132\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Claudia Roden recipe coleslaw. Photograph: Felicity Cloake</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Felicity Cloake</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Apart from Claudia Roden, who, in her Book of Jewish Food <a href=\"http://tinybaker.co.uk/2012/02/coleslaw/\">says she finds</a> coleslaw \"most pleasing simply dressed with oil and vinegar,\" all the recipes I try are for creamy coleslaws. I do like her version \u2013 I often make a quick coleslaw from things that have outstayed their welcome in the salad tray, tossed with vinaigrette \u2013 but, according to my testing panel, a classic British coleslaw deserves better.</p> <p>Valentine Warner makes a quick mayonnaise in the food processor, using egg yolks, sunflower oil, English and Dijon mustards and white wine vinegar, with 2 tablespoons of yoghurt stirred in at the end. I find his dressing rather too vinegary although I'm relieved it's not quite as sweet as the cooked dressing recommended by Constance Spry. This is made by heating sugar, flour, salt, mustard and vinegar together (I use malt vinegar, because I suspect that's what most people would have had in the house in 1956 when her Cookery Book was originally published), and then beating them into egg and butter, and stirring in cream to dilute. While it certainly has punch in the flavour department, it's also incredibly rich: Simon and Lindsey's homemade mayonnaise seems light in comparison. (Although it might seem like a lot of work, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2010/jul/01/how-to-make-perfect-mayonnaise\">making your own mayonnaise</a> is really worthwhile here, because most ready-made versions tend to be fairly heavy on the vinegar.)</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397224956\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/3/1349274490251/Cooks-Illustrated-recipe--002.jpg\" alt=\"Cooks Illustrated recipe coleslaw\" width=\"220\" height=\"132\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cooks Illustrated recipe coleslaw. Photograph: Felicity Cloake</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Felicity Cloake</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The <a href=\"http://www.crumblycookie.net/2008/04/19/creamy-buttermilk-coleslaw/\">buttermilk dressing</a> used in Cooks Illustrated is a traditional choice in the American south, in this case thickened with mayonnaise and sour cream, and flavoured with cider vinegar and mustard. Tangy and surprisingly fresh, this feels like a good coleslaw for a hot day, and, perhaps by association, I find myself thinking it would be a very pleasant partner to <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2012/sep/06/how-cook-perfect-southern-fried-chicken\">fried chicken</a>, if I ever work up an appetite for another helping.</p> <p>When it comes to flavour, thanks to its double dressing the Prawn Cocktail Years coleslaw is by far and away the panel's favourite. The cabbage and carrot are very lightly pickled from their earlier marinade, so there's no need to pack the homemade mayonnaise with vinegar and sugar, and the contrast between the two dressings makes it a far more interesting salad to eat. And, although I like a certain amount of crunch, the pickling process does soften things slightly.</p> <p>Most coleslaw recipes employ mustard, either Dijon or English, in the dressing, but in a flash of inspiration, I'm substituting horseradish instead: the peppery heat works better, I think, with the slight bitterness of the cabbage.</p> <h2>The onion question</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397224957\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/3/1349271634109/Valentine-Warner-recipe-c-002.jpg\" alt=\"Valentine Warner recipe coleslaw\" width=\"220\" height=\"132\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Valentine Warner recipe coleslaw. Photograph: Felicity Cloake</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Felicity Cloake</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I'll come out and admit it now: I don't like raw onion in my coleslaw. Not when it's red and you \"rinse away its attitude\" before use as Valentine Warner suggests, not when it's a finely minced shallot \u00e0 la Cooks Illustrated, and particularly not when it's a grated sweet onion as in Claudia Roden's recipe. It's just too strong.</p> <p>I can't deny, however, that the sweet and sour tang of a good coleslaw is a good complement for a subtler onion flavour, but the chives that Simon and Lindsey use get lost. In the end, I settle for finely chopped spring onion, which will deliver the requisite alliaceousness without the harshness I find so troubling.</p> <p>Claudia grates green pepper into her coleslaw, although the fact it's marked as \"optional\" suggests she's aware that it's not really a classic addition. The flavour seems to belong to a different cuisine. Ditto the dill that Constance Spry suggests adding, or the parsley in the Cooks Illustrated recipe: they're nice, but they do change the character of the entire dish. I'll let the spring onions bring greenery to the party.</p> <h2>Perfect coleslaw</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397224958\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/3/1349276090605/Felicitys-perfect-colesla-008.jpg\" alt=\"Felicity's perfect coleslaw\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Felicity's perfect coleslaw.

  "<p>Presidential campaigns aren't where you look for honest, serious discussion of economic policy. Usually, the candidates confine themselves to slogans; sometimes, as with George W Bush, we also get a moron. But in this election, something very different is going on. For the first time, we are explicitly seeing the effects of America's new political duopoly.</p> <p>Both Obama and Romney are very intelligent men. And yet, both of them are completely avoiding, or being dishonest about, huge economic issues \u2013 even when their opponent is highly vulnerable to attack. Thus, we have the bizarre spectacle of a Republican ex-private equity banker attacking the Democrat on unemployment, while the Democrat argues gamely that if we just give him more time, everything will be fine \u2013 which we all know is not true. Both men say vaguely that they will \"reform Washington\", when neither means it.</p> <p>Neither of them says a serious word about the causes of the financial crisis; the <a href=\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2012/10/01/how-the-government-failed-to-fix-wall-street.html\">lack of prosecution </a>of banks and bankers; <a href=\"http://www.nationaljournal.com/next-economy/essay-the-growing-income-gap-in-the-u-s-harms-the-economy-20120927?page=1\">sharply rising inequality</a> in <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/answer-sheet/post/why-education-inequality-persists--and-how-to-fix-it/2012/05/15/gIQAXEIeSU_blog.html\">educational opportunity</a>, income and wealth; energy policy and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/oct/02/us-presidential-debates-global-warming\">global warming</a>; America's <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/bruceupbin/2012/07/21/americans-suffer-from-third-rate-broadband-at-high-prices/\">competitive lag</a> in broadband infrastructure; the impact of <a href=\"http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1917726,00.html\">industrialized food</a> on healthcare costs; the <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2008/07/28/bush-leaving-next-preside_n_115335.html\">last decade's</a> budget deficits and the resultant national debt; or the large-scale, <a href=\"http://www.converge.org.nz/pirm/nutech.htm\">permanent elimination</a> of millions of less-skilled jobs through both globalization and advances in robotics and artificial intelligence.</p> <p>In a time of <a href=\"http://money.usnews.com/money/blogs/alpha-consumer/2012/09/14/americans-continue-to-struggle-post-recession\">pervasive economic insecurity</a>, with declining incomes and high unemployment, four years after a horrific financial crisis, how can all of these questions be successfully ignored by both candidates?</p> <p>As it turns out, their behavior is entirely rational, though for disconcerting reasons. The answer lies in the combined effect of three related forces: America's deepening economic problems; the role now played by money in politics; and the emotions of a scared, increasingly cynical, economically insecure electorate.</p> <p>Since the late 1970s, US politics has been increasingly shaped by the pressures generated by globalization, rising inequality and America's declining competitiveness. As average Americans felt increasing pressures and endured stagnant real wages, they initially responded by working longer hours and going into debt (personal, household debt). But then came politics.</p> <p>Beginning with the Reagan-Carter contest in 1980, Republicans <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/steven-conn/whats-the-big-idea_1_b_1927492.html\">started</a> to abandon traditional financial prudence in favor of an increasingly demagogic strategy of blaming government regulation, waste and welfare payments in order to justify tax cuts. Demonization of regulation served the additional purpose of justifying the deregulation of industries such as financial services and energy. Since the Republicans' tax cuts were never accompanied by spending cuts, they not only reduced voters' tax bills, but also stimulated the economy generally.</p> <p>It was unsustainable, of course, but when the Democrats tried counter-arguments based on fiscal prudence and government services, they generally got slaughtered \u2013 as did <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/quora/2012/09/10/how-does-the-current-republican-ticket-compare-to-reaganbush/\"> Carter in 1980</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.tnr.com/blog/plank/107286/romneys-tax-silence\">Mondale in 1984</a>.</p> <p>It worked again for George W Bush, although, of course, he lost the popular vote in 2000 and only became president thanks to an <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/jurisprudence/2010/12/election_hangover.html\">infamous</a> supreme court decision. But it really did work in 2004, when he trounced Kerry despite the increasingly obvious disasters of the Iraqi occupation.</p> <p>And so, <a href=\"http://www.nydailynews.com/blogs/the_rumble/2012/09/clintonomics-and-obamanomics-closer-than-you-think\">starting with</a> Clinton's reduction of capital gains taxes and financial deregulation, the Democrats started making deals with the devil. Clinton, to his credit, still tried to do some progressive things where he could, and the internet revolution allowed him to balance his budget. But the Democrats have, by now, been profoundly reshaped by the oceans of money that dominate US politics.</p> <p>In 2008, Obama could afford to run as the reformer, and perhaps even needed to. But not so in 2012: Obama's economic positions \u2013 not just his actions, but even his public statements and promises \u2013 are the result of triangulating reality, public opinion and money. Obama still needs to get <em>some</em> votes from his base, so he must call for some burden-sharing by the rich. But he cannot be honest about the depth, or the sources, of America's structural economic problems, for two reasons.</p> <p>First, he would be telling much of his blue-collar, minority, unionized and/or less-educated voter base that their skills are obsolete and they are economically doomed. Even in 2008, he might not have been able to get away with that; he certainly can't get away with it now. But second, Obama cannot be honest about the economic damage caused by a criminalized, out-of-control financial sector, nor about other major industries contributing to America's economic problems (energy, telecommunications, industrialized food, pharmaceuticals) \u2013 because he needs their money.</p> <p>As a result, Obama seemingly makes himself unusually vulnerable on the economy. But he can afford to, because Romney cannot take full advantage of Obama's vulnerabilities. Romney, you see, depends <em>even more heavily</em> on the money and support of the financial sector, the wealthy, business and of anti-union, anti-immigrant forces. Romney's only appeal to average Americans is through \"values\" conservatism (religion, opposition to gay marriage, abortion, drugs, immigration, etc), vague complaints about government bureaucracy and, yet again, tax cuts.</p> <p>And so Obama can avoid all the hard issues and yet retain the grudging support of his base simply by proposing modest tax increases on the wealthy, and by supporting the safety net (unemployment benefits, Medicare, social security) that Romney might cut.</p> <p>Voila: an election in which there are a dozen elephants in the room, and neither candidate pays them any notice at all; an election that Obama can win because he's somewhat less bad, somewhat less utterly bankrupt, than the other guy. </p> <p>Welcome to America's new and improved two-party system.</p>",

But the dramatic collapse of Arctic sea ice this year presages disaster much sooner. It demonstrates the alarming progression of a vicious cycle: as the sea ice melts away, it is replaced by open water, absorbing sunshine and warming the sea such as to speed the melt. This vicious cycle became apparent in the 90s, when observations of the sea ice extent started deviating from linear projections. Annual sea ice minimum volume is showing a clear trend towards zero in September 2015 \u2013 an ice-free ocean.</p> <p>Scientists warn that this year's weather extremes, and mounting food prices, are due to Arctic warming and therefore liable to worsen progressively in future years as the sea ice disappears. <a href=\"http://www.ameg.me/\" title=\"\">Ameg</a>, the independent policy group that I chair, argues that the only way to avoid such a crisis is to cool the Arctic.

Thus Dorling calls for \"low growth\", but a rate of just 1% would produce a doubling of a given quantity in a mere 70 years. Toynbee even talks of the \"sunny uplands of 3% growth\".

  "<p>Labour is looking at plans to cut winter fuel allowance and other benefits for better off pensioners to use the cash to help fund social care for the elderly. The move is being described as symbolic of its new \"One Nation Labour\" philosophy.</p> <p>After claiming Disraeli's \"one nation\", slogan in his conference speech in Manchester on Tuesday, Miliband introduced the concept of One Nation Labour at a follow-up question and answer session in Manchester on Wednesday. He wants to use One Nation Labour to demonstrate that new and old Labour have been superseded.</p> <p>Miliband, basking in the praise lavished by his party on his no-notes conference speech, also confirmed that he will attend a TUC anti-cuts demonstration on 20 October and called some of the delegates \"comrade\", the traditional socialist greeting.</p> <p>However, the first poll indications suggest the speech has achieved no cut through, and done nothing to improve his ratings. One explanation is that it had relatively little impact on the TV bulletins, owing to competing news, but it also shows the wall of scepticism Miliband faces among the public.</p> <p>Labour's position on social care is important because the Liberal Democrat social care minister, Norman Lamb, is seeking crossparty consensus on how to fund a cap on social care costs.

The proposals might cost more than \u00a31.8bn a year, but the Treasury has been reluctant to release the money.</p> <p>A report by the Institute for Fiscal Studies suggested in June that means-testing the winter fuel allowance and TV licence could raise \u00a31.4bn a year, almost enough to cover the Dilnot proposals.</p> <p>The thinktank also suggested charging National Insurance on employers' contributions to private pensions and abolishing the entitlement to tax free lump sums could raise almost \u00a33bn.</p> <p>Labour support for withdrawing benefits from wealthier pensioners would be similar to Liberal Democrat proposals, but it may be impossible to reach agreement in this parliament as David Cameron has made a commitment not to touch the value of pensions for the wealthy.</p> <p>Lamb has suggested it might be necessary to appoint an honest broker between the parties to try to secure a consensus.</p> <p>The shadow work and pensions secretary, Liam Byrne, hinted at the possible move in an interview this week saying: \"There's always been a balance in the welfare state between universal benefits and targeted benefits, and I am afraid as part of Ed Balls' zero-based spending review that balance has got to be looked at.\"</p> <p>Miliband's aides were on Wednesday trying to show how One Nation Labour might have electoral appeal. They suggested voters had turned away from the last Labour government because some workers felt there was no route into employment for their children. They also felt immigration was making their life more difficult, and no one cared. They considered New Labour did not do enough to reassure this group of voters that people at the top would be expected to display responsibility.</p> <p>Addressing this theme, Miliband told his conferenence: \"One Nation is incredibly important to us as a country and us as a party. Old Labour is not going to answer the challenges we face because it can't stand up for the whole country. But nor is New Labour, because it was too silent about the responsibilities of those at the top and too timid when it comes to the vested interests of our country.\"</p> <p>He added: \"If you take what we have announced on vocational qualifications, on apprenticeships, or what we have said about immigration and some of the concerns we have overlooked it is understanding who we left behind as a party as well as understanding that we need to make sure responsibility goes right the way to the top.\"</p> <p>The remarks suggest Miliband recognises that he needs to win over many people who voted Conservative at the last election, and a focus on former Liberal Democrat voters will not be enough.</p> <p>He also tried to portray Cameron as someone who is deliberately dividing the country, saying: \"People are thinking in their hearts, actually who can really unite this country, who can really bring this country together?\"</p> <p>He added that when Cameron appears at next week's Conservative conference in Birmingham, \"you are not going to see a uniter, you are going to see a divider. You are going to see someone who is dividing Britain. The next general election will go to the person who can show that he can unite Britain, not divide it.\"</p> <p>Miliband also courted controversy with the rightwing press by saying he will attend a trade union-organised march against government cuts this month. The demonstration, labelled \"A future that works\", is due to take place in central London on 20 October.</p> <p>Asked by a union member at Labour's annual conference in Manchester if he would join the protest, Miliband replied that he would \"be there\".</p> <p>Unions have criticised Labour for supporting a public sector pay freeze.</p> <p>Miliband also tried to deal with an omission in his conference speech by speaking extensively on climate change, and called for aviation emissions to be brought into national carbon budgets.</p>",
  "<p>With his dark suit, single white glove and air of twinkly indulgence Agostino Perrone, the head barman at London's Connaught Bar, looks every part the magician. He is mixing a martini, the gin cascading at arm's length over ice, a chilled glass at the ready.</p> <p>It's a ritual that has been performed at this hotel thousands of times since the drink became fashionable in London in the early 1930s. For much of the 20th century if you wanted a classic cocktail in the capital, you came to luxury joints such as the Connaught or the Savoy. In the real world cocktail bars had steadily been degraded by an explosion in ultra-sweet and garish drinks that signified almost the exact opposite of their original sophistication. By 1981, when the Human League's Susan Sulley sang that she was \"working as a waitress in a cocktail bar\" everyone understood that she was on the bottom rung of the social ladder until poor, ill-used Phil Oakey came along to rescue her.</p> <p>Now, for the first time in decades, London's bartenders have a spring in their step. At this summer's Spirited Awards at Tales of the Cocktail in New Orleans, the industry's most prestigious competition, the capital's bars and their staff grabbed nearly all of the international prizes.</p> <p>Perrone's revamped Connaught Bar was named the world's best bar, but other nominees were 69 Colebrooke Row in Islington and Nightjar and Callooh Callay in Shoreditch. Meanwhile, other London bars the Artesian(Best Hotel Bar, and Best International Bartender for Alex Kratena), Zetter Town House (Best New Cocktail Bar)and Salvatore's at The Playboy (Best Drinks Selection)won their categories outright, while Whistling Shop and Happiness Forgets were also nominated.</p> <p>\"People say that the 1920s and 1930s&#xa0;were the golden age of cocktails,\" says Perrone, \"but that was the era of prohibition in the United States. Those weren't positive times. We're living through the golden age now.\"</p> <p>A lot of the credit for this golden age, at least in London, goes to Tony Conigliaro. His bar, 69 Colebrooke Row, looks, with its black and white check floor and white-jacketed bar-staff, like an Italian barbers from the 1950s. Round the corner he has a laboratory that has helped to introduce a new scientific rigour to the business of making drinks. The fruit in the rhubarb gimlet there, for example, has been put through a centrifuge to reduce it to a beautiful cordial, something like the platonic essence of rhubarb. He sees drinks, almost literally, as building blocks.</p> <p>\"I visualise drinks as 3D objects to work out how they'll go together,\" he explains. \"and I quite often draw them when I'm working on a cocktail. To me different spirits have different shapes ... gin looks like a sphere but with all these bits coming out, like a kind of Rubik's Cube.\"</p> <p>This approach, dubbed \"molecular mixology\", much to his displeasure, has devotees around the world. Even the traditionalist Connaught allows Perrone to add his own special \"botanicals\", flavours such as cardamom and ginger to his martini and he offers a deconstructed Bloody Mary topped with a celery foam.</p> <p>But science is not the only reason for London's newfound success. Nightjar owner Edmund Weil points out that the capital's multicultural appeal means bars can attract expert bartenders from all over the world.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Callooh Callay's Andrea Montague thinks it is London's drinking public that has changed. \"People are not scared of alcohol any more,\" she says. \"They used to want tall, fruity drinks for the effect. Now they're asking for a martini, two to one, with gin and an olive.\"</p> <p>Many of those people will be visiting the city from Monday for <a href=\"http://www.londoncocktailweek.com/%E2%80%9Dwww.londoncocktailweek.com\" title=\"\">London Cocktail Week</a>, when up to 15,000 punters will descend on its bars for seminars and to try new flavours. Organiser Hannah Sharman-Cox says that she wants cocktails to become \"as popular as cooking\". This is optimistic but, if anything from the Depression has to return, a well mixed Martini certainly wouldn't be at the bottom of my list.</p>",
  "<p>\u2022 The Daily Mail did its efficient best to demolish Miliband's claim to have attended a normal London comp, claiming with only some exaggeration that he is the product of \"the Labour aristocracy\" whose future stars and family friends were far removed from harsh working-class life. One detail the Mail overlooked is riveting. Miliband's clever-but-poor refugee parents were befriended by <strong>Ruth Dalton</strong>, widow of a Labour chancellor (1945-47) and when she died she left them enough (\u00a35,000) to buy a nice house in Primrose Hill. She did the same for dashing young economist, <strong>John Vaizey</strong>. His son, another Ed, is now a Tory minister.</p> <p>\u2022 Labour claims that about 11,000 people have been accredited to its 2012 conference, about the same as last year, though it does not provide a breakdown between political and commercial attendees. But one beneficial consequence of belt-tightening all round has been that the security \"ring of steel\" around the conference centre has been smaller and less obstructive both to delegates and Mancunians trying to use their city centre. The main conference hotels are outside the ring, a great relief. In the bad old days even <strong>John Major </strong>would be body searched (he was chancellor at the time).</p> <p>\u2022 Among those welcoming the Labour leader's stress on the importance of maths and English was <strong>Professor Alison Wolf</strong>, whose review of vocational education has also been embraced by the coalition. Wolf's good opinion matters even more to politicians who know she is married to FT economics heavyweight, <strong>Martin Wolf</strong>, whose views on Britain's economic needs do not flatter George Osborne.</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Good day</strong>: Andy Burnham, Labour's health spokesman got the second best conference reception of the week (after you-know-who), with standing ovations throughout his NHS-rescuing tirade.</p> <p>\u2022<strong> Bad day</strong>: Joanna Baxter. The NEC veteran mistook Lib Dem axeman and Muppet Beaker look-like, Danny Alexander, for Danny Boyle, patron saint of the Olympics. Not to be outdone Angela Eagle MP tried to silence pre-NHS nursing veteran, Dilys Greenhalgh, when she exceeded her three minutes. Eagle was booed down.</p>",
  "<p>Since the death of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/jdsalinger\" title=\"\">JD Salinger</a>, one of my biggest regrets as an interviewer is that Caryl Churchill declines to speak publicly about her work. It's a resolution she has stuck to through the quarter century in which she has established herself as one of theatre's most innovative and provocative dramatists. Tantalisingly, there have now been two new plays within a month that journalists can't ask her about: today, the Royal Court in&nbsp;London premieres <a href=\"http://www.royalcourttheatre.com/whats-on/ding-dong-the-wicked\" title=\"\">Ding Dong the Wicked</a>, a half-hour drama that will run alongside <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2012/sep/15/love-and-information-royal-court-review\" title=\"\">Love and Information</a>, the enthusiastically reviewed full-length play that opened there three weeks ago.</p> <p>In the light of Churchill's silence, I talked to a number of people who have worked with her instead. Flexibility, it rapidly emerges, is a key quality for her collaborators. The plays about which the writer won't speak tend to emerge out of silence themselves. Nick Hern, who has published Churchill's plays for 40 years, first at Methuen and now at <a href=\"http://www.nickhernbooks.co.uk/\" title=\"\">his own company, NHB</a>, says: \"The plays just turn up, without warning. I think she's one of those shamanistic writers, in the way Harold Pinter was. A play isn't planned or premeditated; it's scratching an itch. They come to me \u2013 originally in the post, now by email \u2013 and I sit down to read them, having absolutely no idea what the length or subject matter or form will be.\"</p> <p>John Tydeman, the former head of BBC radio drama, has directed half a dozen Churchill radio plays, starting with Lovesick in 1966; he also staged her play Objections to Sex and Violence, at the Royal Court in 1975. Even as a young writer, he remembers, Churchill was unusual in not seeking payment or contracts in advance. \"We never commissioned her. Even with a work that had taken a great deal of historical research, such as one called Schreber's Nervous Illness, the play would just turn up in the post.\"</p> <p>This is still the case, says Dominic Cooke, artistic director of the Royal Court. \"The plays aren't usually formally commissioned. So, in that sense, they just turn up on my desk. I have no idea what I'm getting.\" The late addition to this autumn's repertoire of Ding Dong the Wicked marks the second time the author has turned up at rehearsal with a second new play. The actor <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0179680/\" title=\"\">Allan Corduner</a> was rehearsing <a href=\"http://www.royalcourttheatre.com/whats-on/ice-cream-1989\" title=\"\">Ice-Cream</a> at the Royal Court in 1989 when, he says, \"Caryl came in and said: 'I've just written another new play. Are you up for it?\" Called Hot Fudge, an allusion to the other play, Corduner recalls that this unexpected extra was \"rehearsed and staged in record time\".</p> <p>As well as challenging theatre schedules, Churchill's plays have a long&nbsp;record of testing production possibilities. \"The exciting thing about Caryl,\" says Cooke, \"is that she always tends to break new ground. The degree of innovation is extraordinary. Every play almost reinvents the form of theatre.\" And not just theatre: among her radio plays with Tydeman was Identical Twins (1968), in which the title characters were men who, the writer specified, should be played by one actor, <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0354078/\" title=\"\">Kenneth Haigh</a>, whose speeches would overlap. Decades before digital editing made such effects effortless, Tydeman needed to work with broadcasting's best technicians. \"Kenneth had to record the second speech while we played the first one back, and it turned out that it was almost impossible to do that (keeping pace with your own voice) for more than 30 or 40 seconds at a time. So we had to put the play together in very small takes.\"</p> <p>Churchill's interest in vocal counterpoint has continued, and tested Hern at Methuen. \"We were sitting one day and Caryl said: 'I want to have overlapping dialogue.' And I said: 'Oh, my God, how are we going to do that?' And we worked it out, using a forward slash, and even put a little example of how it would work at the front of the script. And now it's an absolutely standard way of laying out a play.\"</p> <p>Even before that, the writer had asked for a specific and unusual layout of her scripts (character names set to the left, with a uniform gap before the dialogue began). Hern's experience of her polite but precise insistence is echoed in stories from the rehearsal room. Cooke, who directs Ding Dong the Wicked, says: \"She is a very strong presence in rehearsals. And there is a combination of being very open to suggestion \u2013 she enjoys the process of collaboration \u2013 but also of being very specific about what she wants in some cases.\"</p> <p>Tydeman agrees, finding the writer \"diffident and quiet, willing to listen to&nbsp;advice but with firmly held views on&nbsp;certain aspects of the text or production\". It's an experience shared by Michelene Wandor, a dramatist who worked with Churchill on the multi-author cabaret Floorshow (1977); she says that, \"while friendly, Caryl kept herself very much to herself\". Perhaps because of her public invisibility, Churchill is often described as shy, but Corduner, who also appeared in the economic comedy <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_pB6aDaExA\" title=\"\">Serious Money</a> (1987), has a different reading: \"She is so confident about her work that she can discuss it without defensiveness. She's completely non-dogmatic. During rehearsal, she is absolutely clear-headed about what does and doesn't work, which is quite rare in writers. She is entirely without ego.\"</p> <p>Tydeman hints at a private stability that underlies this quiet certainty. \"One of the things that always strikes me about her is that I think she's the only person in my address book who is still living at the same house she was living in in the early 1960s.\" He has never met Churchill's husband, David Harter, a campaigning solicitor, but she&nbsp;would often refer, during their working years, to her three sons and \"writing the plays at the kitchen table\".</p> <p>Churchill prefers to discuss form or&nbsp;effects in rehearsal, rather than meaning. \"She talks more in general terms,\" says Corduner. \"She trusts actors and doesn't want to tread on your territory.\" When he was having trouble finding a character in Serious Money, she gently replied that she couldn't help. But when the actor's solution involved mimicking Churchill's own speech \u2013 \"She has a slight soft-r sound\" \u2013 she agreed at once. Tydeman says: \"We never talked about feminism, for example. It was just there. Caryl's view was always that the plays would speak for themselves. Which, as you know, is also the attitude that she takes to interviews.\"</p> <p>Ah, the interviews. As I can't put the question to Churchill herself, I asked her collaborators if they knew why she refused to talk about her work. \"I've never discussed her refusal to do publicity,\" insists Cooke. \"We just accept that that will be the situation with each play.\" Possibly because, as a publisher, he feels this refusal most keenly, Hern <em>has</em> had the conversation. \"Oh, yes. Back at Methuen, I would come out of editorial meetings, having been asked if I could get Caryl to do this or that to promote the books. And I&nbsp;discussed it with her and she said: 'I really don't like talking about my work. It makes me self-conscious when I come to write the next thing.' She said that, if she became analytical about the plays, she was worried that whatever it is that produces them will go away. It was always about creative self-consciousness. It wasn't: 'I vant to be alone.'\"</p> <p>Another thing Churchill's people agree on is that critics focus too much on her structural jumps. \"I'm most impressed by dialogue, rather than the&nbsp;form,\" says Wandor, \"which has, I&nbsp;think, always had uncertainties about it. The elliptical, quasi-poetic quality of&nbsp;the dialogue is the most interesting element.\" Cooke concurs: \"I don't think she's been given enough credit for the quality of her dialogue \u2013 the way she captures a situation or a character in just a few lines.\"</p> <p>In the unlikely event that Churchill ever agreed to an interview, one question that might come up would be the fact that \u2013 from Tydeman to Cooke, Stephen Daldry and James Macdonald at the Court \u2013 she has worked almost exclusively with male directors. \"Mmm. Isn't that interesting?\" says Tydeman. \"I think at the start it was happenstance rather than choice, because the men were rather in the majority. But it is interesting that it continued.\" Wandor says: \"I've never discussed it with her. But I think it is true that to have had major theatrical success, male directors still seem pretty pivotal, and the management/directing by Max Stafford-Clark [her longterm collaborator at the Royal Court] was crucial to the successes of the earlier work.\"</p> <p>Corduner admits the question has occurred to him. \"I have been very conscious of that during rehearsals. But I've never discussed it with her. I think, although she's clearly a feminist and stands for many things feminism admires, she doesn't judge people by gender. I've never detected a yearning to have her work directed by women. Again, it's that confidence.\"</p> <p>Has her diffidence when it comes to&nbsp;interviews had an effect on her reputation? The final word goes to Tydeman, who says, \"I'm talking about&nbsp;working with [Caryl], but I was always struck by how little work was needed. Her plays \u2013 like those of Tom Stoppard, with whom I also worked \u2013 always arrived fully made. I'd put her up there&nbsp;with Stoppard, although her reputation may be lower than it should be \u2013 because she has chosen to stay in the background.\"</p>",

He said Assange's decision to evade a European arrest warrant had become an \"unprecedented\" matter of diplomatic and inter-governmental concern, which they could not reasonably influence.</p> <p>Smith spoke on behalf of sureties who include Philip Knightly, a veteran Australian investigative journalist who exposed the British traitor Kim Philby as a Russian spy, and Sir John Sulston, a Nobel prize-winning biologist. Smith told the court that a group of them visited Assange on Monday and concluded \"the sureties do not have the power to meaningfully intervene in this matter. This has become a matter between the Ecuadorean, British, Swedish, US and Australian governments.\"</p> <p>The supporters provided between \u00a35,000 and \u00a320,000 each to secure Assange's freedom when he was arrested in December 2010 in connection with allegations of rape and sexual assault relating to relationships with two women in Stockholm. Assange broke his bail conditions in June this year when he took refuge in the Ecuadorean embassy in Knightsbridge after he lost a supreme court challenge to the validity of the European arrest warrant that demanded his return to Sweden for questioning.</p> <p>It is understood that a separate group of Assange supporters, thought to include the film-maker Ken Loach, the writer and campaigner Jemima Khan, the journalist John Pilger and the magazine publisher Felix Dennis have already forfeited bail cash worth \u00a3200,000 following a court order earlier this year.</p> <p>\"We never envisaged when we became sureties that the matter would become a diplomatic argument and it is clear that this needs to be resolved at diplomatic level,\" said Smith in the short hearing in front of the chief magistrate, Howard Riddle, which was attended by four other sureties: Knightly, Prof Patricia David, a retired professor of education, Lady Caroline Evans, the wife of the former Labour minister Lord Evans, and Tracy Worcester, a model turned environmental activist.</p> <p>Smith told the court that the sureties could not ignore the perceived risk that if Assange is extradited to Sweden he could end up in a US prison \"under unjust conditions\".</p> <p>To publicly urge him to leave the embassy would \"render us mercenary and contemptible individuals of great weakness of character\", Smith said.</p> <p>He urged the court to take into account the \"huge amount of effort over an unexpectedly long period\" the sureties had put in to support the legal process. He drew attention to his own efforts and those of his family, who as well as standing \u00a320,000 in bail money hosted Assange for 13 months. He also highlighted the efforts of Sarah Saunders, a WikiLeaks activist and surety, who hosted Assange at her Kent home from where he had to report each day to a police station and adhere to a 10pm-to-8am curfew.</p> <p>\"We request that sureties in this case be treated gracefully, in a manner that reflects the impossible position that we are in,\" he said.</p> <p>\"In this unique, this quite exceptional case, complying with what this court seems to expect from us, to all publicly urge Mr Assange to abandon the sanctuary that he has found in the Ecuadorean embassy, would see us acting against a man whom we and others judge to have understandable fears about his ultimate treatment in the United States if he abandons his asylum.\"</p> <p>The chief magistrate said he would take several days to consider the submission and other evidence before making a ruling. In an earlier hearing in September, he had given the nine sureties a month to persuade Assange to surrender himself to police if they wanted their money back, saying he was not persuaded that they were not \"using every effort, publicly and privately, to persuade Mr Assange to surrender himself to UK authorities\".</p> <p>In August, Ecuador's president, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/aug/14/julian-assange-asylum-ecuador-wikileaks\" title=\"\">Rafael Correa, granted Assange asylum</a> and said the 41-year-old Australian could stay indefinitely in the London embassy.</p> <p>Sweden said in August that any suggestion that Assange could be extradited to America, where he is wanted for his role in leaking hundreds of thousands of classified US military and diplomatic papers, was \"hypothetical speculation that shifts the focus away from what this case is actually about\". Assange has claimed he could face the death penalty in the US.</p> <p>Karin Hoglund, deputy ambassador at the Swedish embassy in Washington DC, said the issue was \"exclusively a question of surrender to Sweden under a European arrest warrant on Mr Assange, who is under criminal investigation in Sweden suspected of sexual offences against two Swedish women\".</p> <p>She said: \"Sweden is not allowed to extradite a person at risk of capital punishment \u2026 The extradition act also includes grounds for refusal of extradition, such as political or military offences and situations in which the person who is extradited is at risk of persecution.\"</p> <h2>The sureties<br></h2> <p>Prof Tricia David \u2013 \u00a320,000</p> <p>Lady Caroline Evans \u2013 \u00a320,000</p> <p>Joseph Farrell \u2013 \u00a35,000</p> <p>Sarah Harrison \u2013 \u00a35,000</p> <p>Philip Knightly \u2013 \u00a320,000</p> <p>Sarah Saunders \u2013 \u00a320,000</p> <p>Vaughan Smith \u2013 \u00a320,000</p> <p>Sir John Sulston \u2013 \u00a320,000</p>",
  "<p>Designer Simon Daw transforms the space into an enchanting, Narnia-style winter wonderland, but there is nothing magical about the Ukrainian forest where a deaf Tamil refugee, Tanika, falls to the snow-covered ground, exhausted by her long trek.

The warm ochres and burnt orange of family life in Sri Lanka are contrasted with the icy blankness of the present; the warmth of her relationship with her former sign-language teacher is counterpoised with her isolation in the desolate forest.</p> <p>Played out using a mix of mime, sign language and speech \u2013 plus a jaunty musical soundtrack \u2013 the piece sometimes feels like a silent movie version of a dark fairytale, and at others like a Marcel Marceau-inspired comedy.

Paula Garfield is a director of genuine flair, but here the devising process has resulted in a piece that often feels quite static, both emotionally and dramaturgically, and which allows the energy to drain away. The scenes in the forest are atmospheric but lack tension. But it's a moving evening nonetheless, and Nadia Nadarajah is beguiling as the desperate Tanika \u2013 a tiny figure battling the silence and the elements.</p> <p>\u2022 What have you been to see lately?

All three highlight the standard and now-familiar attributes of Obama's approach to foreign policy.</p> <p>The Times describes how the Pentagon and CIA are \"laying the groundwork for operations to kill or capture militants implicated in the deadly attack on a diplomatic mission in Libya\", while \"the top-secret Joint Special Operations Command is compiling so-called target packages of detailed information about the suspects.\" That could \"include drone strikes, Special Operations raids like the one that killed Osama bin Laden and joint missions with Libyan authorities.\" The Post adds that \"the White House has held a series of secret meetings in recent months to examine the threat posed by al-Qaida's franchise in North Africa and consider for the first time whether to prepare for unilateral strikes.\"</p> <p>Meanwhile, AP - under the headline \"White House Widening Covert War in North Africa\" - describes how, even before the consulate attack, \"small teams of special operations forces arrived at American embassies throughout North Africa\" in order, among other things, to \"set up a network that could quickly strike a terrorist target\". That is because \"the administration has been worried for some time about a growing threat posed by al-Qaida and its offshoots in North Africa.\" The Post similarly reports that this is all being driven by \"concern that al-Qaida's African affiliate has become more dangerous since gaining control of large pockets of territory in Mali and acquiring weapons from post-revolution Libya.\"</p> <p>All of these reports make clear that nothing definitive has yet been ordered by President Obama. But the approach being planned is nonetheless shaped by three of the predominant characteristics of Obama's foreign policy and \"counter-terrorism\" mentality:</p> <p><strong>(1)</strong> Note how all of these processes - including the already established covert presence in North Africa - are all being conducted in total secrecy, away from democratic debate, and without even a suggestion that any Congressional approval is necessary. The president is like a roving emperor-warrior, ordering military action at will. As John Glaser <a href=\"http://news.antiwar.com/2012/10/02/us-preparing-for-jsoc-kill-capture-operations-in-libya-after-consulate-attack/\">writes this morning</a>, \"the fact that the President is considering using a top-secret JSOC raid or attack on suspects illustrates the administration's penchant for secrecy, without congressional oversight or open discussion with the public, in its foreign policy operations.\"</p> <p>Obama has expanded drone attacks in Yemen, Somalia, and Pakistan. He has involved the US in aggressive cyber warfare and possibly other forms of military aggression against Iran. He has established and is now looking to expand what AP calls a \"covert war in North Africa\". None of this has been debated, let alone voted on, in Congress. The one time Congress voted on a significant Obama foreign policy - the war in Libya - it voted against its authorization, and Obama blithely ignored that vote and proceeded with the war as though Congressional rejection never happened.</p> <p>In sum, Obama uses military force whenever he wants, wherever he wants, and without anyone's permission. It is worth recalling the <a href=\"http://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=lincoln;rgn=div1;view=text;idno=lincoln1;node=lincoln1%3A458\">1848 warning of Abraham Lincoln</a> regarding President James Polk's involvement in the war with Mexico. Lincoln was responding in a letter to his law partner's defense of Polk which argued, as Lincoln put it, that \"if it shall become necessary, to repel invasion, the President may, without violation of the Constitution, cross the line, and invade the teritory of another country; and that whether such necessity exists in any given case, the President is to be the sole judge.\" Replied Lincoln [emphasis in original]:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"Allow the President to invade a neighboring nation, whenever <em>he</em> shall deem it necessary to repel an invasion, and you allow him to do so, <em>whenever he may choose to say</em> he deems it necessary for such purpose - and you allow him to make war at pleasure. </p> <p>\"Study to see if you can fix<em> any limit</em> to his power in this respect, after you have given him so much as you propose. If, today, he should choose to say he thinks it necessary to invade Canada, to prevent the British from invading us, how could you stop him? You may say to him, 'I see no probability of the British invading us' but he will say to you 'be silent; I see it, if you don't.'</p> <p>\"The provision of the Constitution giving the war-making power to Congress, was dictated, as I understand it, by the following reasons. Kings had always been involving and impoverishing their people in wars, pretending generally, if not always, that the good of the people was the object. </p> <p>\"This, our Convention understood to be the most oppressive of all Kingly oppressions; and they resolved to so frame the Constitution that no one man should hold the power of bringing this oppression upon us. But your view destroys the whole matter, and places our President where kings have always stood.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>In the Obama worldview, whether military force will be used in Libya is for the president alone to decide. Aside from being a replica of the <a href=\"http://glenngreenwald.blogspot.com/2006/01/ideology-of-lawlessness.html\">Bush/Cheney/Yoo view of executive power and national security</a>, it is a classic example of the power seizure about which Lincoln so stridently warned (and yes, Lincoln himself subsequently seized massive, probably illegal power, though - as I <a href=\"http://glenngreenwald.blogspot.com.br/2005/12/idiotic-and-revealing-civil-war.html\">often pointed out to neocons</a> who invoked Lincoln to justify Bush's power abuses - the Civil War was truly an existential threat and not remotely comparable to \"the war on terror\").</p> <p><strong>(2)</strong> President Obama has <a href=\"http://news.yahoo.com/video/obama-libya-killers-brought-justice-175203021.html\">repeatedly vowed</a> that those responsible for the Benghazi attacks will be \"brought to justice\". That term is Obama-speak for: <em>I will order people summarily executed without a whiff of due process or transparency, based purely on my say-so and my suspicions</em> (just as it <a href=\"http://www.nbcuniversalarchives.com/nbcuni/clip/51A3683_021.do\">was Bush-speak</a> for the same concept). </p> <p>In other words, Obama \"justice\" means summary assassinations ordered in secret without a even a pretense of due process. As Glaser wrote, the reported Libya approach \"demonstrates their preference to kill suspected perpetrators as opposed to apprehending suspects and carrying out a transparent trial in court, something the administration seems long ago to have abandoned in favor of night raids or drone strikes.\" Moreover, just as \"terrorist\" means \"those the US government<em> accuses </em>of being a terrorist,\" the term \"responsible for the Benghazi attack\" means:<em> those whom the president secretly decides is guilty</em>.</p> <p>Trying to apprehend people you think committed crimes and then punishing them once their guilt is proven in a duly constituted judicial tribunal is so obsolete and wimpy: so pre-9/11 and inconsistent with the Age of the Proud Progressive Warrior.</p> <p><strong>(3)</strong> As usual, military intervention is the leading cause of further military intervention. The motives of the Benghazi killers are not definitively known, though it seems likely that they were reacting to some form of American violence in the region, whether it be a drone attack or the Libya intervention. But it does seem clear that what has enabled and empowered them, at least to some degree, is the Libya intervention.</p> <p>Indeed, the Post reports that the administration has become increasingly concerned about the \"al-Qadia affiliate\" in that region since it began \"gaining control of large pockets of territory in Mali and acquiring weapons from post-revolution Libya.\" But there is a <a href=\"http://www.stratfor.com/weekly/mali-besieged-fighters-fleeing-libya\">compelling argument</a> to make that the instability in Libya created by the intervention is precisely what has substantially increased instability in Mali and thus enabled extremists more effectively to use that country as a base of operations. </p> <p>Moreover, critics of the Libya intervention long warned that NATO was arming extremists and even al-Qaida elements and that its doing so would likely lead to future US claims that it has to intervene further to fight the very extremists it itself empowered (just as happened in Afghanistan and so many other places). Combine all that with the fact that any military intervention, even the most noble and successful, creates some degree of resentment and a desire for vengeance against the foreign power, and it seems clear that there is some element of action and reaction to the events in North Africa.</p> <p>In other words, US military action is the prime ingredient ensuring future military actions. It is its own self-sustaining and self-perpetuating form of militarism. Whether that is why the US endlessly exerts military force in other countries, or whether it is a fortunate by-product of that continuous use of force (fortunate from the perspective of the National Security State), Obama's ongoing use of military force in multiple countries ensures that the posture of the US for the foreseeable future will continue to be one of endless war.</p> <h2>Changing White House response</h2> <p>Last week, I <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/sep/23/iran-usa\">wrote about</a> the false, self-serving claims initially emanating from the White House about the Benghazi attack, and how much that tracked the process that produced similarly false claims from Obama officials about the bin Laden killing. On Monday, Jon Stewart <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/erik-wemple/post/daily-show-satirizes-obamas-libya-comments/2012/10/02/676ddc7e-0c85-11e2-bb5e-492c0d30bff6_blog.html\">mocked the inability of Obama officials</a> to keep their story straight on these attacks, while today, Mother Jones' Adam Serwer <a href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/mojo/2012/10/five-debate-questions-obama-libya\">proposes five questions</a> about Libya which Obama should be asked in tonight's presidential debate.</p>",
  "<p>Alan Quinn is a BAE shop steward helping to build Typhoon fighter aircraft. (\"We don't bash metal any more, we glue metal to carbon fibre and Kevlar parts.\") He's anxiously looking to see if the proposed merger with EADS will expand Britain's high-end manufacturing base \u2013 or further erode it. But the 52-year-old also finds time to be a school governor, a magistrate and, for the past two years, what his constituency MP Ivan Lewis calls \"a good, crusading councillor\" in Labour Bury.</p> <p>What did Quinn think of Miliband's speech? \"I was surprised how good it was, delivered confidently and unscripted. He's now looking like a PM. I didn't expect it to be that good.\"</p> <p>Before the speech Quinn had fretted that Labour had wasted five months on its leadership contest in 2010, allowing the coalition to blame the debt crisis entirely on Labour's legacy, not the bankers.</p> <p>Now, he says, \"Ed's grown in the job and has the measure of Cameron. He was ahead on banking and phone hacking. I've met him twice and he comes across as sincere and honest.\"</p> <p>Plenty of delegates echo these sentiments. Sheila Dore, an east London teacher, recalls hearing Miliband addressing local education meetings. \"He'd speak, but he also listened.\"</p> <p>These views have infected the 2012 conference. \"It's not perfect, but it is more democratic; they're not telling us what to say in our speech; there's less PR, music and flashing lights. It's more low-key but it allows a better conversation,\" says Dore. Another Labour delegate says: \"The mood is better. Last year no one was really listening; this year we are.\"</p> <p>The result has often been a tentative atmosphere in the cavernous conference hall, the former Manchester Central train shed, draped in black curtains to make it fit the smaller audience. Apart from the Olympic session and Miliband's own speech (low-key by modern histrionic standards), there have been few emotional high points and standing ovations.</p> <p>Modern Labour conferences are dominated by people who have got on in life but remember mum's struggle with ill health and low pay, dad's unemployment, their former community's loss of industries, jobs and decent pensions, the stresses that killed grandma, the victimisation (blacklists still exist) at work. Traditional passions, including the NHS, still arouse strong feelings and Labour conferences are still happier with public spending plans than cuts.</p> <p>But there is greater acknowledgement nowadays of unavoidable choices, the need for efficiency, green manufacturing and skills (they make very green steel in Scunthorpe these days), the power of markets as well as their unfairness. Much mocked as Miliband-ish policy wonking, Professor Michael Sandel's hour-long Sunday seminar (\"What money can't buy\") is said to have enthralled the Usdaw delegation, the union of shopworkers, who felt they were getting a glimpse of Harvard.</p> <p>Others mutter \"conference has been turned into a thinktank\"; by that they mean didactic and earnest.</p> <p>In the main hall and on the crowded fringe, routine Tory-bashing in speeches has been punctuated by hisses for the Lib Dems as hapless pantomime villains of the coalition, though neither the leader nor his lieutenants have attacked the Clegg crew much, knowing they might have to deal with them if Labour wins without a Commons majority in 2015.</p> <p>There is little evident enthusiasm to contemplate that option. \"We can win by ourselves,\" says Ipswich councillor Keith Rawlingson. \"I'm glad the Lib Dems are in coalition with the Tories, not us,\" adds his wife, Lindsey. \"The Lib Dems are toxic,\" confides their friend, Gary Hills. Old tribal dislikes die hard and optimism remains central to an activist's dedicated life, even as activists accept that few people now want to join political parties.</p> <p>What they try to do instead, says MP Ivan Lewis, is engage with them in specific campaigns \u2013 for a school or hospital, against a polluting plant \u2013 and give participatory rights to them inside Labour's tent as supporters, not members.</p> <p>Bhavna Joshi, who fights Tory housing nimbyism in Great Ashby, Hertfordshire (it sounds like JK Rowling's new novel), puts it differently.</p> <p>\"The public is beyond slickness and spin in politics. The ordinary man in the street wants to know what we stand for. They're not voting for a person, they want to know what a political organisation can do for them.\"</p> <p>Her colleague, Gary Hills, agrees, though their friends, the Rawlingsons, think the need to engage voters in a dialogue of ideas \u2013 \"morality and decency over market dictation\" \u2013 comes first.</p> <p>They don't think much of using social media for this purpose, but in polite, lowered voices suggest that Labour has to acknowledge the problems \u2013 for jobs and public services \u2013 which recent immigration has created. Miliband's speech gave them a flick in that direction. Its success has generated expectation that he is now an established leader who is getting the measure of his ambition for Labour.</p> <p>Wandering around the conference on the 29th anniversary of his own election as Labour leader, Neil Kinnock was an early Ed-not-David man. People should have noticed by now that Miliband is tough, he says, rattling off a list that includes fighting his own brother, taking on Murdoch and the banks, even abolishing annual shadow cabinet elections.</p> <p>Is he a geek? Kinnock is another of those who say that people who meet him think: \"What a nice guy. He engages with people in an unusual way, a bit like Mo [Mowlam] did. 'I hear what you say.'\"</p> <p>In the bar of Manchester's Midland Hotel, the historical heart of the conference, a gnarled old union apparatchik from the Clydeside shipyards, Unite's Jim Mowatt, offers his own verdict on the speech.</p> <p>\"I know this man better than I did before, and I trust him more,\" he says.</p>",
  "<p>When historians look back on Barack Obama's first and second presidential elections, they may see some commonality. Four years ago, the country's first black White House candidate was smeared with all sorts of allegations. The would-be president was not born in the US. He was a mole. A socialist \u2013 no, make that a communist. Barack was gay. Barack was a Marxist. <a href=\"http://mediamatters.org/blog/2012/09/18/foxs-bolling-advances-obama-muslim-myth/189961\" title=\"And a Muslim too\">And a Muslim too</a>.</p> <p>Now the same myths are rumbling through the country's bars, online forums and, worryingly, major news outlets. And this time there is a list of failed promises \u2013 on Guant\u00e1namo, universal healthcare \u2013 to add to the attack, while the personal claims seem to be yet more torrid (this week's most bizarre is that \"Obama's mother was a porn star\").</p> <p>It is against this backdrop that new playwright Rashid Razaq is staging his debut production, based on Obama's college days at Columbia, New York. Provocatively titled <a href=\"http://www.waterlooeast.co.uk/the%20president%20and%20the%20pakistani.html\" title=\"\">The President and&nbsp;the Pakistani</a>, it revisits Harlem, 1981, when \"Barry\" Obama was living with his alleged party-loving, drug-abusing, illegal alien Pakistani friend, Sohale Siddiqi.</p> <p>\"They had an odd-couple relationship,\" says Razaq, a reporter for the London Evening Standard, showing me a picture of the pair sprawled on a mustard yellow sofa, a leather-jacketed and polo-sweatered Obama kicking back with an impressively moustached, skinny Pakistani. In the play, Siddiqi has been renamed Salim \"Sal\" Maqbool; in Obama's 1995 autobiography, Dreams From My Father, he was recreated as a composite character named Sadik, mentioned in only a few pages.</p> <p>\"Sal is a cokehead\", says Razaq, who admits he has never spoken to the person on whom the character is based. \"He has manic, nervous energy while Barry is the stable, secure, sensible guy. But there is a real closeness between them and hopefully that comes across.\" At heart, Razaq's play is a studied 80s bromance.</p> <p>But what would Siddiqi himself make of it? When I track down Obama's former room-mate, who now works for Getty Images and lives in Seattle, he is reluctant to speak. Not least, he says, because a reporter from Associated Press \"got his interview by barging in unexpectedly at my workplace in spite of my declinations\" during the last campaign cycle.He says the reports of his drug use have been wildly overstated: \"I was never in 'rehab',\" he emails, \"I simply curtailed drugs.\" It is true, however, that in the late 1990s, as state senator of Illinois, Obama wrote him \"a personal reference, stating that he knew me\" when Siddiqi was applying for jobs in the dotcom industry. Their lives had naturally drifted apart by that point, but a solid bond remains. Siddiqi still refuses a steady stream of press requests to talk about his old friend, including the offer of $50,000 to talk to one anti-Obama film-maker just a few weeks ago.</p> <p>I send Siddiqi a copy of the script and ask him what he thinks. He says he feels \"helpless\" about the play. \"The portrayal of 'Sal' as a clingy and dishonest roommate is completely off the mark and makes me cringe,\" he writes.</p> <p>\"Obama was exceptionally kind and considerate of others which I considered to his own detriment \u2013 the play got that part correct,\" he says of his time spent living with the president in a shabby apartment on East 94th Street. It was a lease that Siddiqi, who was an illegal immigrant when he met Obama (having overstayed his tourist visa), had lied to win, despite the cockroaches, \"like plump dates\", scuttling across the apartment floor. Siddiqi confirms that the young Obama, a high school pothead, \"was lighthearted and fun-loving for the first half of our cohabitation and grew serious later\". He himself, meanwhile, was preoccupied with \"assimilating to my new environment [US], getting rich legally, socialising with friends, meeting women. Our cohabitation was on a temporary basis with me hoping to move to more comfortable surroundings and he wanting to live closer to Columbia.\"</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397116206\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/3/1349274386787/barack-obama-roomie-play--008.jpg\" alt=\"barack obama roomie play - rehearsal\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Syrus Lowe (Barry Obama) and Junaid Faiz (Sal Maqbool) in rehearsal for The President and The Pakistani.

Mild-mannered but sure-footed direction comes from Tom Attenborough, son of Michael Attenborough (artistic director of the Almeida theatre, London) and grandson of actor and director Richard.</p> <p>I wonder if Razaq agrees that representing a living president during the busiest period of electioneering is political in itself. \"All theatre is a political act to some degree. We're just grabbing it by the balls,\" he says. Emphasising his right to artistic licence, he says he drew inspiration from <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/nov/09/barack-obama-childhood-indonesia\" title=\"Obamas own book\">Obama's own book</a> and scoped <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/may/25/barack-obama-the-college-years\" title=\"David Maranisss biography of the 44th president\">David Maraniss's biography, Barack Obama: The Making of the Man,</a> published earlier this year, for further detail.</p> <p>When we meet \"Sadik\" in Dreams From My Father, he is ushering Obama into his flat as a woman in her underwear cuts up lines of cocaine on the kitchen table. In Maraniss's doorstop of a book, Obama first meets Siddiqi at a New Year's Eve party in San Francisco, the young, gangly, would-be president greeting his future roommate with pitch-perfect Urdu, asking: \"How are you, Boss?\" It was a phrase he had picked up from his best buddies at Occidental College in California \u2013 Pakistani students Imad Husain, Hasan Chandoo and Wahid Hamid who, like Siddiqi, were part of Karachi's wealthy elite. So close were the group that Obama went to Pakistan with them for a three-week holiday in 1981, staying with Hamid and Chandoo's families.</p> <p>Maraniss argues in his book that the group has distanced itself from Obama for fear of hurting his presidency, but they remain friends: \"The Pakistanis were a fun-loving bunch,\" he laughs, talking on the telephone from Washington DC, \"but they were intellectuals.\" Despite their party harder reputations, the three went into highly paid corporate finance: Husain is a Boston-based banker; Hamid works for one of the world's biggest private equity firms in Dubai; and Chandoo \u2013 who is recorded to have fundraised some <a href=\"http://www.barackobama.com/pages/volunteer-fundraisers-q4/\" title=\"$50,000 to $100,000 for Obamas current campaign\">$50,000 to $100,000 for Obama's current campaign</a> \u2013 is a financial consultant, living with his family in upmarket Westchester, New York.</p> <p>Camp Obama plays all this down, fearful of the Pakistani Muslim connection being used to taint their candidate. \"A friend of mine did wonder if the play was about Pakistan now,\" says Syrus Lowe, who plays the young Obama, as we discuss the irony of one of the president's hallmark foreign policies: the covert US war against Pakistan, waged entirely through drone attacks.</p> <p>Lowe says he likes to think Obama is \"dropping those drones with a bit more conscience\" than the average US president might. Maraniss is less circumspect. \"The Pakistanis, in my mind, didn't shape him in any way but made this transitionary period of his life comfortable for him, as he was still learning what it was to be African American. They could see his ambition more clearly than other people; it was to them that Obama first said he wanted to be president one day.\"</p> <p>The President and the Pakistani is at the <a href=\"http://waterlooeast.ticketsolve.com/\" title=\"here\">Waterloo East theatre</a>, London SE1, until 4&nbsp;November.</p>",
  "<p>I was late filing my column this week \u2013 late because I've been trying to identify the faint sense of unease trailing me around all day, every day, and I think I've finally got it nailed. It's that I've got my seasons arse about face and I have lived my year backwards, leaving me with some interesting decisions to make for autumn and winter in terms of what to wear.</p> <p>It started to go wrong in May, when the weather was dire and awful and it felt like winter again. I was spending a lot of time working at home. Then it picked up briefly over the Olympics, when we had what passed for summer this year, and now I'm back again to sundry items of nondescript, multi-seasonal casualwear. My summer clothes have barely seen the light of day, let alone a ray of sunshine.</p> <p>As a not-entirely-unexpected side effect of spending much of the last four months sitting on my backside in front of a keyboard, or stretched out on the sofa with the cat cheering on Team GB, I find that, underneath the layers of jersey and loose shirts, I've developed, ahem, a spare tyre. And the spare tyre also has a spare tyre, one that has settled around my bum. I am, oh woe, a whole dress size bigger and my wardrobe choices are limited by what still fits. It will not do. It will not do at all.</p> <p>I should make a point here: it's not entirely my fault. Yes, yes, there's my unfortunate and well-documented fondness for Ben &amp; Jerry's but that's a treat I allow myself on Saturday evenings, and Saturday evenings only. Saturday Sweetie Night is a discipline I've carried on from when my children were still at home \u2013 no sweeties all week and then we'd consume our own body weight in Cadbury's on a Saturday night. The rest of the time, I assure you, I am the very soul of abstemiousness. I eat salad and fruit, yoghurt and muesli, and very few carbs. I don't drink a daily latte any more and my alcohol consumption has fallen since I started working at home. Gawd, I'm almost teetotal!</p> <p>Nope, a good part of this is down to that age thing no one tells you about \u2013 a lowered metabolic rate. I remember my mum at the age I am now, in deep distress because she only had to look at a buttered crumpet to put on half-a-stone. There is a limit to how far I'm prepared to go over the appropriate BMI for my height and build, and not because I'm obsessive about slimness \u2013 I'm so very tired of seeing gaunt-faced social x-rays nibbling on an olive and then agonising over it \u2013 but there is a direct correlation between some health issues and where the digits stop reeling on my bathroom scales. As my dear old dad keeps saying: \"If you haven't got your health, you haven't got anything.\"</p> <p>So what's the plan? Not too much tinkering with my daily diet but rather an improved level of physical activity. When I was commuting every day I used the London transport system as my daily gym \u2013 walking up and down escalators, power-walking along the pavements, swearing at dawdling tourists who got in my way. When the Olympics began, my daily yomp around Greenwich Park was curtailed, but now the stadium and fences are coming down I'm working my way back up to a full five miles most mornings. I feel better for it and, honestly, I can already see a difference. Hurrah! I will soon be able to wear my favourite skirt again. I am, in short, giving my metabolic rate a kick up its very own backside.

  "<p>A key conceit of Ireland's \"Celtic tiger\" boom involved reading economic growth in cultural terms. The \"boom\" was attributed not only to the genius of exceptional political leadership, but also to a fundamental shift in values among the wider population. Neoliberalism and the liberalisation of society were in harmony, and if this didn't quite signal the end of history, it marked a definitive break with a past often represented as a long dark night of conflict, emigration, and the suffocating hegemony of the Catholic church.</p> <p>As society in Ireland continues to be forced to pay for the consequences of boom-time speculation, it may well be that it is the present that is more of a foreign country. However, as the renewed public focus on the systemic <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magdalene_asylum\" title=\"\">abuse of the Magdalene laundries</a> indicates, the conceit of a \"past\" transcended was as ideologically self-serving as the elite desire to represent the property bubble as proud proof of national arrival.</p> <p>Last week, a <a href=\"http://www.rte.ie/news/2012/0926/magdelene-laundries-apology-motion-defeated.html\" title=\"\">Sinn F\u00e9in private members motion in D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann</a> urged the government to issue a long-overdue apology to the survivors of the Magdalene laundries, an act that would <a href=\"http://www.magdalenelaundries.com/name.htm\" title=\"\">allow them to draw pensions and access a reparations scheme</a>. The government argued that it was obliged to wait until the end of the year for the final report of the inter-departmental committee investigating state involvement with the laundry system, and the motion was defeated.</p> <p>In reacting to what was widely regarded as another stalling tactic \u2013 by a state that has cynically sought to extract itself from responsibility for these \"private institutions\" \u2013 the survivor advocacy group <a href=\"http://www.magdalenelaundries.com/press_releases.htm#250912\" title=\"\">Justice for Magdalenes</a> noted the injustice of needlessly prolonging the wait of a diminishing group of elderly women. They are entitled not only to restitution for their incarceration in a brutal system, but recompense for their labour, having been exploited and enslaved in washing the clothes of a society where they were hidden in plain sight.</p> <p>The implacable callousness of the state has at least served to refocus attention on the nature and scale of the unlawful imprisonment imposed on \"deviant\" populations. <a href=\"http://www.thejournal.ie/magdalene-laundry-true-story-margaret-bullen-samantha-long-614350-Sep2012/\" title=\"\">The Journal.ie</a> published an account by Samantha Long of a meeting with her mother Margaret Bullen, who, when she met her at the age of 42, \"looked like a pensioner\".

The <a href=\"http://corkindependent.com/stories/item/11857/2012-39/O%E2%80%99Brien-calls-for-immediate-Magdalene-survivors-apology\" title=\"\">Labour TD Michael McCarthy</a> described the Magdalene laundries as \"our own Holocaust\". With far less exaggeration and more analytical precision, O'Toole described it as an \"Irish gulag system\".</p> <p>Historical resonances are important, but there is a danger in replicating the stark division of Irish history into a benighted Catholic past and a better, liberal present. Ireland continues to produce and confine \"problematic\" populations, only now it is not \"fallen women\" and the problematic working class locked up by a patriarchal church and state, but the <a href=\"http://www.polity.co.uk/book.asp?ref=9780745631653\" title=\"\">\"human waste\"</a> of a fragile global economy, migrants locked up by states committed to stemming human mobility while tapping the mobility of capital.</p> <p>At present, approximately 6,000 people live in <a href=\"http://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/moving_country/asylum_seekers_and_refugees/services_for_asylum_seekers_in_ireland/direct_provision.html\" title=\"\">direct provision accommodation centres</a> in Ireland while their asylum claims are processed. Originally introduced as an \"emergency measure\" in 1999 to speed up asylum determination procedures, over a third have been in this system for more than three years, and waits of seven or eight years are not unheard of. Unable to access education, employment or frequently even to cook for themselves, asylum-seekers are accommodated and fed, and granted an adult weekly allowance of \u20ac19.10 (rates that have not changed in real terms since their introduction over a decade ago). For this other population, also corralled and controlled outside of society, it is unsurprising that anxiety, depression and ill health are widespread.</p> <p>No comparison should obscure the particular forms of violence and suffering that mark different experiences. But the parallels are politically important. Ill health scarred the lives of children in industrial schools \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.atlanticphilanthropies.org/learning/report-state-sanctioned-child-poverty-and-exclusion\" title=\"\">a recent report</a> has documented the appalling conditions and health problems of the children of asylum seekers, who constitute one-third of the population of the direct provision system. According to O'Toole, thousands of people died each decade in the neglectful conditions of psychiatric hospitals \u2013 in September Emmanuel Marcel Landa became the latest person to die in the direct provision system, and <a href=\"http://www.irishrefugeecouncil.ie/news/congolese-asylum-seeker-dies-in-accommodation-centre/1415\" title=\"\">as Sue Conlon of the Irish Refugee Council noted</a>, \"the impact of long delays, lengthy residence in direct provision accommodation and the real threat of deportation may well have been a contributory factor in Mr Landa's untimely death\". The forced separation of the wrong type of families mocked the Catholic emphasis on the sanctity of the family \u2013 today a hugely costly and ineffective deportation system separates families, and <a href=\"http://www.irishleftreview.org/2012/10/02/antideportation-ireland-launches-campaign-direct-provision-deportation/\" title=\"\">deports children born in Ireland to \"home countries\" they have never been to</a>.</p> <p>It is an easy argument that \"we must look after our own\", especially in an acute recession. However, the history of the \"Irish gulag\" illustrates the thinness of any such national fiction. Further, the system of direct provision, introduced during the \"boom times\", must be <a href=\"http://plutopress.wordpress.com/tag/alexandra-hall/\" title=\"\">understood primarily as a politicised system of deterrence and control</a>. It is this systemic violence that unites the wasted lives of the \"immoral\" and \"deviant\" subjects of the past, and the \"bogus\" and \"undeserving\" of the present.</p> <p>In one of her last pieces on a system she did so much to investigate, the late Mary Raftery <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/jun/08/irealnd-magdalene-laundries-scandal-un?fb=native&amp;CMP=FBCNETTXT9038\" title=\"\">noted that \"Irish society was deeply complicit in the incarceration of women and girls in the laundries\"</a>. There are <a href=\"http://www.swp.ie/content/hundreds-march-galway-save-asylum-centre\" title=\"\">faint but hopeful signs</a> that contemporary Irish society may recognise its complicity in the abuse of asylum-seekers, and organise to <a href=\"http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/breaking/2012/1002/breaking35.html\" title=\"\">support</a> and <a href=\"http://antideportationireland.blogspot.fi/\" title=\"\">defend</a> them.</p>",
  "<p>An \"unforgettable\" story about a Bulgarian village divided by war has won Miroslav Penkov the \u00a315,000 <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0079gw3\" title=\"\">BBC international short story award</a>.</p> <p>For this year only, the prize allowed entries from around the world, and the 30-year-old Penkov beat a shortlist which included the Booker-nominated Deborah Levy, former winner Julian Gough and the award-winning MJ Hyland. His story, East of the West, takes place in Bulgaria during and after the cold war, spanning 40 years in a village split in two by a shifting border.</p> <p>\"Years ago I read a newspaper article about two villages, one in Bulgaria, one over the border in Serbia. Every five years they would hold a reunion allowed by both governments, because 70 years ago they were one village \u2013 part of Bulgaria,\" said Penkov. \"I used this as the basis for the story, but I wanted to inject my own life into it, [to write about] myself, abroad in America and in many ways alone, with a huge body of water between me and the people I love ... It's a very sprawling story, in which I tried to show myself how to take life's losses and not view them as punishments but as something liberating, and ultimately leading to freedom.\"</p> <p>Penkov moved from Bulgaria to America in 2001, at the age of 18, to study at the University of Arkansas. Although he had been writing in Bulgarian, it took some convincing from one of his professors for him to continue in English. \"Moving to America, suddenly I felt so removed from everyone I cared about, and writing was the only way I knew to cross the ocean, to shorten the distance,\" he said. Now an assistant professor of creative writing at the University of North Texas, Penkov's stories have appeared in The Best American Short Stories 2008, and have been collected in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/short-stories/9780374117337/east-of-the-west-a-country-in-stories\" title=\"\">East of the West: A Country in Stories</a>, published in the UK by Sceptre.</p> <p>Judges for the BBC prize, chaired by Clive Anderson, chose him as their unanimous winner for what novelist Mich\u00e8le Roberts called his narrator's \"unforgettable\" voice, \"his bleak vision redeemed by a strength of feeling that is unusual and unfashionable in modern fiction\".</p> <p>Penkov's story \"so ambitiously and successfully united personal and political life, joining inner and outer worlds through its deployment of different kinds of realism: social and magical and folkloric,\" she said. Her fellow judge, the novelist Ross Raisin, praised the story's \"understatedness\". \"It is rich in historical detail, and imagery, without over-reaching for these effects, and as a result the story manages well the conveyance of epic with the building of interest in the individual struggle of the narrator,\" he said.</p> <p>South African writer Henrietta Rose-Innes, a former winner of the Caine prize, was the runner-up, winning \u00a32,500 for her story Sanctuary. All of the shortlisted stories have been broadcast on BBC Radio 4 over the last two weeks.</p> <p>\"I didn't think I'd win because I listened to the other stories and I thought they were just wonderful,\" said Penkov. \"When I heard I'd won I completely blacked out, I almost forgot my English. I used to make fun of people when I watched the Academy awards, when they'd go on stage and start crying. I used to think pull yourself together, but it is impossible.\"</p>",
  "<p>Here's one question \u2013 directed at Mitt Romney \u2013 that begs to be asked at Wednesday's first presidential debate in Denver, a demographically changing metropolis where <a href=\"http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/08/08031.html\">more than 30% of the population is Hispanic</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"Poll after poll shows that you're way behind in attracting the support of Latinos, for whom immigration is a deeply personal issue. Latino voters are a critical voting bloc, especially in swing states such as North Carolina, Florida, and Colorado. If elected president, how will you make sure that you do not alienate the country's largest minority group?\"</p> </blockquote> <p>However substantive his response, Romney should at least refrain from calling people \"illegal aliens\".</p> <p>Language matters, particularly regarding a combustible issue in which an action (illegal immigration) has long been conflated with a group of people (\"illegals\"). Actions are illegal, never people. Yet, when it comes to illegal immigration, <a href=\"http://ideas.time.com/2012/09/21/immigration-debate-the-problem-with-the-word-illegal/\">a pejorative and dehumanizing term</a> is casually used to inflame and isolate. \"Illegal\" oversimplifies and politicizes a complex issue that is wholly integrated in American life.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.pewhispanic.org/2011/12/01/unauthorized-immigrants-length-of-residency-patterns-of-parenthood/\">According to the Pew Hispanic Center</a>, at least 17 million people are living legally in the US but belong in households with at least one undocumented immigrant. In other words, that \"illegal immigrant\" is a parent, a sister, or a cousin of a US citizen.</p> <p>Romney is far from alone in broadly describing immigrants as \"illegal\" \u2013 many politicians, not to mention most in the mainstream media, <a href=\"http://publiceditor.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/10/02/readers-wont-benefit-if-times-bans-the-term-illegal-immigrant/?smid=tw-share\">including the New York Times</a>, still use the term \u2013 but compared to President Obama, the difference is striking. In interviews, speeches, and on his campaign website, Obama almost always uses the more neutral term \"undocumented immigrant\".</p> <p>This past summer, while announcing his plan to halt the deportation of undocumented youth and grant them a temporary reprieve via deferred action, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/16/us/transcript-of-obamas-speech-on-immigration-policy.html?pagewanted=all\">Obama spoke of young people</a> who are \"Americans in their heart, in their minds, in every single way but one: on paper.\"</p> <p>Contrast that with Romney who, since his first White House run five years ago, has interchangeably used \"illegals\", \"illegal aliens\", and \"illegal immigrants\". This is not purely semantic: Romney's choice of words and terms go in hand-in-hand with his policies. In November 2007, I sat in the press room during a CNN/YouTube Republican debate in St Petersburg, cowering in my seat when reporters spoke of \"illegal immigrants\" when the topic of illegal immigration came up. Publicly, I was a reporter for the Washington Post covering my first presidential campaign; privately, I was an undocumented immigrant with no valid green card who lived in fear of being found out.</p> <p>Answering a question on illegal immigration, Romney, in an effort to out-right the other candidates, was <a href=\"http://articles.cnn.com/2007-11-28/politics/debate.transcript_1_abortion-rights-debate-candidates?_s=PM:POLITICS\">quick to burnish his conservative credentials</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"Let me tell you what I did as governor. I said no to driver's licenses for illegals. I said, number two, we're going to make sure that those that come here don't get a tuition break in our schools, which I disagree with other folks on that one. Number three, I applied to have our state police enforce the immigration laws in May, seven months before I was out of office.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>That answer flashed in my mind as I recently listened to Romney explain his immigration policies to viewers of Univision, the influential Spanish-language television network. Since coming out about my status last year, I've been trying to elevate how we talk about immigration in America as <a href=\"http://www.buzzfeed.com/mhastings/bright-lights-big-secret\">an openly undocumented journalist</a>. I snagged a seat courtesy of Univision, which hosted the forum, and sat among a decidedly older and enthusiastic crowd, who I later learned was bussed in after the Romney campaign failed to attract enough young supporters to fill the University of Miami's BankUnited Center.</p> <p>It was bad enough that Romney kept dodging a question on whether he would keep deferred action if elected president. Worse, in front of a largely Hispanic audience, just two weeks ago, <a href=\"http://latinalista.com/2012/09/transcript-univision-s-meet-the-candidate-forum-with-mitt-romney/\">the Republican candidate referred to undocumented youth as \"illegal aliens\"</a>.</p> <p>When it comes to immigration, Romney has been on the wrong side of history \u2013 in words and in actions. </p> <p>As his path to victory grows narrower, Romney is trying, without much success, to backtrack on some of his most extreme positions on immigration, an issue that is, arguably, <a href=\"http://inamerica.blogs.cnn.com/2012/10/02/its-immigration-stupid-say-latino-voters-in-nevada/?hpt=hp_t2\">second only to the economy</a> among the country's growing Latino population. During the Republican primary, Romney promoted the unrealistic concept of <a href=\"http://articles.nydailynews.com/2012-01-24/news/30657385_1_mitt-romney-illegal-immigrants-deportation\">\"self-deportation\"</a> and strenuously opposed the Dream Act, but now promises comprehensive immigration reform if he reaches the White House. For months, Romney failed to answer if he would deport undocumented youth, <a href=\"http://www.denverpost.com/romney/ci_21677472/romney-wont-revoke-young-illegal-immigrant-visas\">but now says he would let them stay</a>. </p> <p>Flip-flopping aside, Romney has effectively erased whatever inroads the GOP made with Latinos under President Bush, a former governor of a border state who spoke compassionately about immigration. In 2004, capturing almost 45% of the Latino electorate was crucial to Bush's re-election. Romney will be lucky <a href=\"http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2012/10/02/cnn-poll-obama-at-70-among-latino-voters/?hpt=hp_t1\">if he captures more than 30%</a> on 6 November, particularly in swing states where Latino and other immigrant voters \u2013 first generation and naturalized Americans \u2013 could hold the deciding vote. </p> <p>Figures from the non-partisan research group <a href=\"http://www.immigrationpolicy.org/about-immigration-policy-center\">Immigration Policy Center</a> (IPC) provide critical context in this regard. In <a href=\"http://www.immigrationpolicy.org/just-facts/new-americans-colorado\">Colorado</a>, Latino and Asian voters made up a combined 10% of the voters in 2008 \u2013 some 243,000 people. That total, according to IPC, exceeded the margin of victory for Obama, who won Colorado by 214,000 votes. The same goes for <a href=\"http://www.immigrationpolicy.org/just-facts/new-americans-florida\">Florida</a>, an eternal battleground state. The combined total of the rising Latino and Asian vote in the Sunshine State (about 1.3 million) is way beyond Obama's margin of victory there in 2008 (236,450). </p> <p>And the evolving story out of <a href=\"http://www.immigrationpolicy.org/just-facts/new-americans-north-carolina\">North Carolina</a>, an emerging swing state, is especially revealing \u2013 and perhaps prescient. Though Latino and Asian voters comprised less than 3% of total voters in 2008 \u2013 77,000 Latino voters and 43,000 Asian voters \u2013 that total far exceeds the margin of victory: Obama won the Tar Heel State by less than 15,000 votes. Polls show that Obama and Romney are <a href=\"http://www.wral.com/wral-news-poll--presidential-race-still-tight-in-nc/11615486/\">in a tight race</a> for the state's 15 electoral votes. Each vote will count, including first-time voters like 20-year-old Diego Camposeco.</p> <p>Camposeco was born and raised in the small town of Burgaw, just outside Wilmington. He is the eldest of three children, all of whom are American citizens. A sophomore at University of North Carolina in Chapel Hill, he's majoring in journalism and art, and tells me that he pays close attention to news and politics \u2013 how Romney calls people \"illegal aliens\" and how the New York Times and the Charlotte Observer, the most influential paper in his home state, both use \"illegal immigrants\". Camposeco's parents, who crossed the Mexican border before he was born, do not have papers. An <a href=\"http://www.pewhispanic.org/2011/12/01/unauthorized-immigrants-length-of-residency-patterns-of-parenthood/\">estimated 4.5 million US citizens</a> have at least one undocumented parent. </p> <p>\"When the New York Times or NPR or other news organizations refer to people as 'illegal,' that's my mom, that's my dad you're talking about,\" Camposeco told me on the phone. He said he has other friends who are first-time voters whose parents are also undocumented. They plan to vote Obama. Though <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2011/12/obamas-record-high-deportations-draw-hispanic-scorn/\">Obama has deported a record number of undocumented immigrants</a>, he's a far better alternative than Romney, Camposeco said.</p> <p>\"When Romney says 'illegal' this, 'illegal' that, that's personal to me. That's my family you're talking about.\" Which begs two more questions.</p> <p>First, when Margaret Sullivan, the public editor of the New York Times, writes that <a href=\"http://publiceditor.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/10/02/readers-wont-benefit-if-times-bans-the-term-illegal-immigrant/?smid=tw-share\">\"Readers Won't Benefit if Times Bans the Term 'Illegal Immigrant'\"</a>, which readers are she referring to? Clearly, not readers such as Camposeco, who finds the term offensive and degrading. </p> <p>Second, when Romney interchangeably speaks of \"illegals\" and \"illegal aliens\", is he alienating an entire generation of young Hispanic and Asian voters \u2013 the very same voters at whom Peggy Noonan, the conservative columnist, marveled as she visited downtown Brooklyn <a href=\"http://blogs.wsj.com/peggynoonan/2012/09/18/time-for-an-intervention/\">\"full of new Americans\"</a>?</p>",

  "<p>The floating ice cap of the Arctic has been shrinking at an alarming rate for several years, but <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/sep/19/arctic-ice-shrinks\" title=\"\">this year's melt was truly remarkable</a>. The area of the Arctic Ocean covered in ice in the summer is now just half the size it was when satellite monitoring began three decades ago, with scientists now radically changing their predictions for when the entire ocean will be open water.</p> <p>It's refreshing to see that oil industry players, both current and former, have formed an unlikely chorus of collective opinion and are saying that drilling in the Arctic is a bad idea. An analysis of the combination of the cost and the risk of Arctic drilling is leading to the emergence of a new conventional wisdom. If corporate social responsibility (CSR) is to mean anything more than mere branding then there is a line beyond which the oil companies cannot go, and it is a line in the ice.</p> <p>When we launched the <a href=\"http://www.savethearctic.org/\" title=\"\">Save the Arctic</a> campaign at Rio+20, I shared the platform with Sir Richard Branson, who spoke eloquently on the urgent need to transition away from carbon fuels.

Nick Butler, the former head of BP's expro division and Lord Browne's one-time right-hand man, <a href=\"http://blogs.ft.com/nick-butler/2012/09/19/shells-risky-play-in-the-arctic/?Authorised=false#axzz28EacuFlY\" title=\"\">wrote in the Financial Times</a> that the setbacks Shell has suffered in the Arctic should cause it to pull out.</p> <p>\"To abandon the Arctic project would not be an admission of technical failure, nor an act of submission to the environmentalists. It would be a statement of commercial common sense,\" Butler writes.</p> <p>Also <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/matthewhulbert/2012/09/18/has-unconventional-production-peaked/\" title=\"\">writing about Shell's Arctic venture</a>, Forbes magazine commentator Matthew Hulbert, said: \"There will be another 'Macondo moment' at some stage from unconventional plays. It's just a matter of where, when, and who.\" Macondo, of course, was the blowout that nearly crashed BP.</p> <p>Lloyd's of London warned companies not to \"rush in [but instead to] step back and think carefully about the consequences of that action.\" The German bank WestLB announced it would not provide financing to any offshore oil or gas drilling in the region because the \"risks and costs are simply too high.\" Then last week Christophe de Margerie, chief executive of oil giant Total, made an extraordinary intervention, warning the oil majors that Arctic drilling was bad business. \"Oil on Greenland would be a disaster,\" he said. \"A leak would do too much damage to the image of the company.\"</p> <p>Shell - the company leading the charge into the Arctic - may soon regret not reaching the same conclusions as its peers. It leaves the Alaskan coast this year having made a multi-billion dollar investment that resulted in the drilling of not a single well, after key parts of the company's infrastructure failed to secure safety permits and the unpredictable ice patterns further disrupted their plans. And in return for its investment the company suffered significant brand damage. It is a catastrophic reputational defeat for the company that invented CSR.</p> <p>I've long thought that <a href=\"http://www.nsidc.org\" title=\"\">www.nsidc.org</a> is perhaps the Internet's most insightful website when it comes to climate change. The Colorado-based National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC) monitors the size of the cap of Arctic sea ice at the top of the world and publishes a daily updated graph on its site. On the day NSIDC announced a new record sea ice minimum, <a href=\"http://www.350.org/\" title=\"\">350.org</a> founder Bill McKibben was with me in New York, where we held a coordinated international response to the Polar crisis. This is what Bill said: \"There's no place on Earth where we see the essential irony of our moment playing out more perfectly than in the Arctic. Our response has not been alarm, or panic, or a sense of emergency. It has been: 'Let's go up there and drill for oil'. There is no more perfect indictment of our failure to get to grips with the greatest problem we've ever faced.\"</p> <p>Bill recently wrote an extraordinary piece in Rolling Stone magazine entitled <a href=\"http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/global-warmings-terrifying-new-math-20120719\" title=\"\">Global Warming's Terrifying New Math</a> in which he accounted for all the buried carbon that we need to keep in the ground if we're to safeguard our civilisation. His calculations, which included Arctic oil, were compelling. Thankfully a similar calculation is being made about the risks \u2013 economic and otherwise \u2014 of drilling in the Arctic. It's what we call the 'business case'. A growing number of industry figures are now standing with Bill and with Greenpeace and the nearly two million people who have already joined our Save the Arctic campaign.</p> <p>There is the now the potential for the birth of a uniquely diverse coalition of civil society groups, industry figures and energy economists all opposed to Arctic drilling. As the winter ice reforms and Shell retreats, we all need to work to ensure this new movement is ready to fight and win when next year the summer melt begins again and the reckless wing of the oil industry once more moves north.</p> <p><em>Kumi Naidoo is the executive director of </em><a href=\"http://www.greenpeace.org/international/en/\" title=\"\"><em>Greenpeace International</em></a><em>.

  "<p>Labour would abolish the Independent Police Complaints Commission and replace it with a tougher and much more robust Police Standards Authority to restore public trust in the police, the shadow home secretary, Yvette Cooper, has promised.</p> <p>She said the need for reform had been demonstrated by the failures around the Hillsborough cover-up, the time it took to find out the truth about the death of Ian Tomlinson during the G20 protest, and the delays in getting new investigations under way into phone hacking and undercover policing.</p> <p>\"The IPCC wasn't able to sort out any of those cases,\" said Cooper, adding that its new chair, Anne Owers, had already warned about its lack of powers.</p> <p>She said the new body was urgently needed to ensure that isolated incidents were not allowed to damage the police's reputation.</p> <p>The move, which is also said to have the support of senior police officers, would see the creation of a Police Standards Authority with new powers to compel witnesses, launch its own investigations, hold public hearings and impose sanctions.</p> <p>\"Police officers need to know serious problems will be rooted out so they don't cast a shadow over everyone else,\" Cooper told the Labour conference in Manchester.</p> <p>\"Policing in a democracy needs proper checks and balances. Yet the system takes too long and the powers often aren't strong enough.\"</p> <p>The details of how the system will work are to be set out next spring by the independent commission on the future of policing, which was set up by Labour and is chaired by former Metropolitan police commissioner Lord Stevens.</p> <p>It is expected to include working much more closely with Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary to avoid the current duplication of effort. The new body would also ensure a faster resolution of complaints, easier access and better support for those complaining, and an ability to deal with organisational as well as individual policing failings.</p> <p>The shadow home secretary also confirmed she would limit the role of private companies in policing and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/oct/02/cooper-banking-reform-conference-speech\" title=\"\">introduce an Economic Crime Act </a>to target city fraud and money-laundering.</p> <p>She promised that Labour police and crime commissioners who are elected in November will \"halt this Tory rush to privatisation of our police\". She said Labour would continue to support public-private partnerships in policing, especially in areas such as new technology, but any such contracts would have to pass a series of tests, including on value for money, transparency, resilience and public trust.</p> <p>\"Let's be blunt. We don't want private companies patrolling the public streets of Britain,\" she said.</p> <p>The pledge to extend freedom of information (FoI) legislation to private companies by Sadiq Khan, the shadow justice secretary, will cover contracts to deliver public services, such as prisons, hospitals and schools. They will be required to share with the public information on contracts that are funded with public money.</p> <p>Khan said it was time to \"address this blind spot in our freedom of information laws\" and in contrast to Tony Blair's view in his memoirs that he had been an \"idiot\" to introduce FoI in 2000, the shadow justice secretary said he was proud of the achievement, however awkward it could prove to be.</p> <p>\"Not only will the next Labour government protect FoI, we will seek to extend it,\" Khan promised the conference. \"For the first time, FoI will cover the delivery of public services by private companies. This includes our prisons, our schools, and our health service. Public, private or voluntary, subjected to the same disinfecting transparency of FoI.\"</p> <p>On his justice brief, Khan also plans to create a dedicated minister for mental health within the Ministry of Justice and a women's justice board similar to the existing youth justice board. He also unveiled a new proposal to make it obligatory for the courts to consider the option of restorative justice as part of any sentence that is handed down.</p> <p>He said he hoped the women's justice board would emulate the success of the youth justice board in cutting the number of young people in custody by a quarter. A justice minister with responsibility for mental health would start to tackle the 70% of prisoners with two or more mental health problems.</p> <p>\"We've replaced the Victorian asylum with the Victorian prison,\" said Khan. \"Festering in prison with serious mental health problems that can and should be treated is morally wrong.\"</p>",
  "<p>Not content with a planned march into one of Pakistan's most dangerous regions, a group of middle-aged American women are considering mounting a hunger strike outside the US embassy in Islamabad as part a campaign against CIA drone attacks in the country.</p> <p>Thirty-five activists from Code Pink, a US anti-war group, have gathered in the Pakistani capital this week as they prepare for an unprecedented march and political rally in South Waziristan, one of the semi-autonomous tribal areas on the Afghan border, which is a hotbed of Taliban militancy.</p> <p>Despite intense publicity surrounding the event, doubts persist over whether it will be able to take place. Local authorities have expressed strong doubts about the safety of the march, even though the Pakistani military has long claimed its operations in the area have brought a semblance of security.</p> <p>Medea Benjamin, the veteran activist leading the Code Pink delegation, said: \"Frankly, it's a win-win situation for us, whether we get into Waziristan or not.</p> <p>\"We are going because we are challenging the Pakistani government to allow us to go to a place that has been off limits but needs to be seen. And if they try to stop us, it will be clear they do not want the world to see what is going on there.\"</p> <p>On Tuesday in Islamabad, the women met retired generals, ambassadors and even a former head of the notorious military spy agency Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI), and discussed other tactics to publicise their cause.</p> <p>Those included mounting a hunger strike outside the US embassy in Islamabad. Benjamin said the group was still considering the idea.</p> <p>\"It was something a couple of members of the group brought up, but we wanted to wait until we got here to see how appropriate that might be,\" she said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397098385\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Observer/Pix/pictures/2012/10/3/1349261992995/Map---Pakistan-Waziristan-001.png\" alt=\"Map - Pakistan, Waziristan\" width=\"460\" height=\"277\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The whole tribal belt has been off limits to foreigners since Taliban fighters started seeking sanctuary there</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Graphic</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There was also a lengthy discussion about whether Pakistan, which publicly decries the drone campaign despite signs that it continues to give tacit approval, should attempt to shoot down US drones in its airspace.</p> <p>On Wednesday, the women met people from North Waziristan who said they were victims of the US drone campaign, having lost relatives to missile strikes by the remote-controlled planes. They will also hold meetings with Pakistani and US government officials.</p> <p>The group includes Mary Ann Wright, a former US diplomat and army colonel who condemned her country's covert drone campaign as Barack Obama's \"personal execution device\", in reference to the US president's weekly meeting at which he is reported to choose targets for missile strikes.</p> <p>The march, led by Imran Khan and his Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party, is due to take place this weekend. Organisers hope to spend Saturday night in a town outside the tribal areas and then move on to Jandola, just inside the border of South Waziristan, where they will hold a rally.</p> <p>The Taliban have given mixed signals over the march. In August, a spokesman said Khan would be targeted because he is a \"liberal\", but other reports have said the Taliban will support the march.</p> <p>Supporters say Khan has been assured by General Ashfaq Kayani, the head of Pakistan's army, that if they go to South Waziristan they will remain safe.</p> <p>The ambitions of march organisers have already been significantly downgraded. The original hope had been to travel to North Waziristan, a far more dangerous area rife with militants drawn from across the world.</p> <p>The vast majority of drone strikes take place there, and the Pakistani army has almost no influence over the tribal area, where they have long-resisted US calls to mount military operations.</p> <p>Nonetheless, although Jandola is in a relatively safe part of South Waziristan, all of the Federally Administered Tribal Areas (Fata) have been off limits to foreigners since the tribal belt became a sanctuary for Taliban groups fighting against Nato troops in Afghanistan and Pakistani government forces.</p> <p>Few politicians have dared to campaign in the area. If successful, the march will cement Khan's position as a pre-eminent opponent of the US drone campaign.</p> <p>Code Pink, which originally formed to oppose the second Iraq war, claimed its anti-drone campaign was still in its infancy. Benjamin said: \"When it comes to drones, we are at the very beginning of turning public opinion against them in the US.\"</p>",

  "<blockquote> \"As the teenager ejaculated, he became aware of two unfamiliar sounds. One was the very pleasing sound of his girlfriend gurgling with pleasure, her mouth full. He looked down and smiled to see her eyes widen momentarily and then swallow heavily. She looked up at him, flashing her teeth and beaming a beautiful smile. <br> \"The second noise sounded like the gentle tapping of a drum.\" </blockquote> <p>Okay, it grabs the attention. But <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/aug/29/not-the-booker-prize-aj-kirby\" title=\"\">if I hadn't just read Paint This Town Red</a>, I'd be tempted to describe that as the worst book opening I've encountered all year.</p> <p>Sadly, however, I can't describe it as anything like the worst sex scene. There are at least five more in Simon Swift's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/crime/9781907954214/the-casablanca-case\" title=\"\">The Casablanca Case</a> that are even worse. One more quick sample:</p> <blockquote> \"I felt the onset of my own climax, deep thrills running along the length of my penis, building rapidly to a heated bolt that sent spurt after spurt of ejaculate firing into Sarah Hill. <br> \"After that I must have fallen asleep ...\" </blockquote> <p>Suddenly, monasteries don't seem such a bad idea. Happily though, it isn't all sex in The Casablanca Case. There's also philosophy!</p> <blockquote> \"A lot of years had passed; a lot of life elapsed. It is often said that you should never go back, but sometimes there is no alternative. This was one of those times.\" </blockquote> <p>Rudimentary car mechanics!</p> <blockquote> \"You should turn off those lights, you're battery will be drained right down. Next time you try and start the car all you'll hear is a whining noise that grates right on your nerves.\" </blockquote> <p>And music!</p> <blockquote> \"Never falling prey to the onrush of commercialism and big city modernism, it resisted the casino and only rarely took gigs, jazz being an erstwhile companion.\" </blockquote> <p>That reference to jazz presumably comes in because this is a hard-boiled thriller set in 1950s America in a fictional town (Casablanca) that feels a lot like <a href=\"http://historylosangeles.blogspot.co.uk/2012/02/philip-marlowes-los-angeles.html\" title=\"\">Philip Marlowe's Los Angeles</a>. Or at least, I think it is; there's room for confusion. This version of early-1950s America also features answering machines, bulletproof vests, colour photos as standard, cafeti\u00e8res of coffee, references to Joseph Heller's Catch-22 (published in 1961) and such typical US slang as: \"Cheers. You're looking a little better yourself, if you don't mind me saying, mate?\"</p> <p>It's pretty baffling \u2013 and not helped by a peculiar habit of Swift's which is probably best described by demonstration rather than lengthy explanation:</p> <blockquote> \"He showed me to the ice room, put the key in the correct drawer and left the room. For a moment I stood frozen to the spot.\" </blockquote> <blockquote> \"When he died, however, his bank account was overdrawn to the tune of $10000. One possible item of interest was a large withdrawal the week before he was shot. It was certainly worth following up.\" <br> </blockquote> <blockquote> \"'You can eat anything blue in the bar, but anything in black must be taken in the restaurant,'\" said a young black lady called Cherry.\" <br> </blockquote> <blockquote> \"The shooting pain in my head made me cry out in pain.\" <br> </blockquote> <p>If someone brandishes a gun, you can bet that they'll be firing off ideas any minute. If they're fishing, they'll be catching someone in their hook. If they're eating they'll be finding something hard to swallow. It adds a bit of (albeit unintentional) amusement, but, combined with some astonishing grammar, obscures Swift's meaning and intentions to the extent that getting through the book becomes a real battle.</p> <p>And that's a shame because, in spite of everything, there's some appeal to Swift's story of a weather-beaten detective returning to his old stomping ground to solve one last case \u2013 and discovering that the whole place has gone rancid in his absence. I wasn't just left puzzling over the events in the book because of the bewildering prose \u2013 there is a genuine sense of mystery.</p> <p>In the author's note in the back of the book it says that Swift has \"been compared to genre masters, Raymond Chandler and Dashiell Hammett\". I'm guessing he's only been compared to them in the sense that people have pointed out that he's nothing like as good. Even so, there are the makings of a passable hard-boiled thriller here. Casablanca never seems real (and the name certainly doesn't help), but there's an intriguing seediness to the setting, with its sprawl of strip bars, its mafia-run local politics and cowed locals. When the lead character Errol Black is beaten up in a car park, he awakes to find that \"the cars were different. There must have been ten cars that were different to the ones before. Probably more than ten. They must all have seen me here in a crumpled heap. Like a drunken bum.\"</p> <p>Okay, it's not exactly Shakespeare, but it almost works, in context. There is enough ambiguity built in the story to leave me wondering exactly why no one helped poor old Black. What was wrong with this place? I didn't know \u2013 and that feeling of uncertainty kept me dutifully plodding through until the end.</p> <p>Mind you, I'd have thought far more of the book if I hadn't read the final 30 pages. The Casablanca Case might not have the worst opening of the year, but it definitely has the worst conclusion. Characters appear out of nowhere and disappear in confusion. Crucial events fly by in a few lines of flashback. Plot points aren't so much wrapped up as smothered and left to die. It was infuriating and absurd. After struggling along with Swift for so much of the marathon, it felt as if he'd reached the last mile and decided to dodge off to the pub instead of crossing the line. Okay, he was never going to win, but he could at least have pretended to care about finishing.</p> <p><strong>Next time: The vote!</strong></p>",
  "<p>Donors have acted hastily in suspending aid to Rwanda over allegations that it is supporting a rebel insurgency in the neighbouring Democratic Republic of the Congo, according to a leading expert on \"fragile states\".</p> <p>Professor James Putzel, co-author of <a href=\"http://www2.lse.ac.uk/internationalDevelopment/research/crisisStates/Publications/Final-Report.aspx\" title=\"\">Meeting the Challenges of Crisis States, a report from the London School of Economics</a>, questioned the decision of the EU, the US and Germany in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/27/eu-partially-freezes-aid-to-rwanda?intcmp=239\" title=\"\">partially freezing aid to Rwanda</a> amid accusations that its military is supporting the violent rebel group M23. President Paul Kagame has <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/28/congo-warlord-rwanda-kagame-defies-un\" title=\"\">vehemently rejected the allegations</a>.</p> <p>Britain's position has been more ambiguous: after initially freezing \u00a316m of general budget support to the country in July, it unblocked half that amount last month, which provoked criticism.</p> <p>\"Donors have been precipitous in suspending aid,\" said Putzel. \"The evidence is much more mixed and it's complicated. Of course there are some ethnic and family links across the border, but generally the Rwandan government has been judicious in staying its hand.\"</p> <p>Puntzel's comments highlight the sometimes testy relations between donors and aid recipients, especially at a time when donors place increasing emphasis on the importance of good governance and human rights. The EU, the world's largest aid donor, last year said it placed far greater focus on democracy, human rights and governance in its aid programmes under its <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2011/oct/13/eu-focus-human-rights-aid\" title=\"\">new \"agenda for change\" development policy</a>.</p> <p>However, the LSE report cautions against too formulaic an approach towards democratic rules, formal state institutions and elections. \"If democratic rules are likely to lead to significant exclusion of either powerful elites or important regional, ethnic, language or religious groups, then they may be inferior to forms of power sharing,\" says the report.</p> <p>Warning that donor attempts to promote democratic or market reforms can lead to violence, it says sometimes tolerating corruption, unproductive rents and less than democratic governments has actually been the price of peace.</p> <p>\"The promotion of democracy in a country needs to focus on establishing mechanisms for checks and balances on executive authority rather than the form of political party competition,\" said the report, which looks at why some fragile states \u2013 understood as countries particularly vulnerable to outbreaks of large-scale violence \u2013 slide into collapse while others manage to achieve periods of \"resilience\".</p> <p>Putzel and his co-author, Jonathan Di John, cite Zambia as an example of \"resilient stagnation\", a state that managed to avoid violent conflict throughout its post-colonial history but also became an example of peaceful regime change. Stability was the result of \"an inclusive bargain\" among contending elites, underpinned by a dominant national political party, they said, but the trade-off has been economic stagnation because economic policies \u2013 the deployment of subsidies and access to valuable economic (mining) rights \u2013 were based more on political than economic criteria.</p> <p>\"Good governance reforms promoted by aid agencies need to take into account existing elite bargains or they may have unintended negative outcomes on democratic and developmental possibilities,\" says the report.</p> <p>Another uncomfortable message for aid agencies is that the failure to prioritise security in state building threatens to undermine aid efforts. Where the state cannot maintain power without unleashing violence against its own population, as is currently the case in the DRC, external efforts need to put the construction of accountable security forces ahead of other aid programmes, argues the report.</p> <p>\"Most of the attention of the international community towards security in fragile states has been related to downsizing the state's security forces, demobilising programmes \u2026 and wider concerns or providing 'human security' and respect for human rights,\" it says. \"While these are desirable objectives, they are unattainable without the establishment of a basic security capacity within the state.\"</p> <p>A key finding is the importance of taxation, cited as a major indicator for measuring state performance. The report urges western donors to support the creation of taxation systems in developing countries. It also urges donors to channel aid through the state rather than bypassing it, which can contribute to the creation of a \"dual public authority\", a scenario that \u2013 over time \u2013 can weaken states \"in favour of rival networks of patronage\". This chimes with one of the outcomes at last year's aid effectiveness conference in Busan, South Korea, when donors reaffirmed <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/poverty-matters/2011/dec/02/busan-shifting-geopolitical-realities\" title=\"\">that aid used for general budget support should be the \"default\" option</a>.</p> <p>The authors' main contention is that rather than democratic institutions, the \"underlying political settlement\" determines political or economic outcomes. Focusing on the political settlement, they argue, directs attention to the crucial role of elites in securing stability in a state, which should lead donors to be concerned \"about the incentives elites face to play by the rules of the state\".</p>"
