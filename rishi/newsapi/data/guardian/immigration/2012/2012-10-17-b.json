The location was near the emperor colony at the edge of the frozen area of the Ross Sea, Antarctica. It was into the only likely exit hole that he lowered himself. He then had to wait for the return of the penguins, crops full of icefish for their chicks. Paul locked his legs under the lip of the ice so he could remain motionless, breathing through a snorkel so as not to spook the penguins when they arrived. Then it came: a blast of birds from the depths.

He knows one pack intimately. 'I have travelled with them, on foot, in the pack itself, running with them as they hunt. It's a privilege, and it's given me a true insight into their life.' Kim has also witnessed firsthand the many threats that have made African wild dogs endangered, including increased conflict with humans and domestic animals (poachers snares, habitat loss, traffic and disease). At times, it is heart-wrenching, he says. 'My mission is to dispel the myth that they are a threat and help raise awareness of their plight.' African wild dogs require huge territories, and so protecting them can protect entire ecosystems.

He is one of fewer than 500 wild, critically endangered Sumatran tigers. It was a huge challenge for Steve to photograph one, as those that have escaped poaching and forest clearance are mostly confined to patches of forests or the mountains and are extremely shy. A former tiger hunter, now employed as a park ranger, advised Steve where to set up his camera trap. But the challenge remained to position the remote-control camera and the lights in exactly the right position so the tiger would be lit centre-stage in front of a backdrop of forest habitat. The seemingly unstoppable growth of oil-palm plantations in Sumatra and continuing poaching for body parts for use in traditional Chinese medicine indicate that this subspecies of tiger is destined to become extinct in the wild, as have its Javan and Balinese relatives<br>Photograph: Steve Winter/2012 Veolia Environnement Wildlife Photographer of the Year</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Steve Winter/Action images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397840822\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/16/1350410175725/Ice-matters-003.jpg\" alt=\"Veolia: Ice matters\" width=\"720\" height=\"480\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\"><strong>The world in our hands award</strong> Winner: Ice matters by Anna Henly (UK) Anna was on a boat in Svalbard an archipelago midway between mainland Norway and the North Pole when she saw this polar bear at around four in the morning. It was October, and the bear was walking on broken-up ice floes, seemingly tentatively, not quite sure where to trust its weight. She used her fisheye lens to make the enormous animal appear diminutive and create an impression of the top predator on top of the planet, with its ice world breaking up . The symbolism, of course, is that polar bears rely almost entirely on the marine sea ice environment for their survival, and year by year, increasing temperatures are reducing the amount of ice cover and the amount of time available for the bears to hunt marine mammals</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Anna Henly/2012 Veolia Environnement Wildlife Photographer of the Year</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397840820\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/16/1350410183010/Into-the-mouth-of-the-cai-005.jpg\" alt=\"Veolia: Into the mouth of the caiman\" width=\"720\" height=\"480\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\"><strong>Behaviour: cold-blooded animals</strong> Winner: Into the mouth of the caiman by Luciano Candisani (Brazil) Motionless but alert, a yacare caiman waits, like a small tyrannosaurus for fish to come within snapping reach, says Luciano. Caimans are usually seen floating passively on the surface. Under the water, it's another story. It is this secret life that has fascinated Luciano ever since he first came face to face with a caiman while snorkelling. Once he had recovered from the shock, he realised that the reptile was neither aggressive nor fearful and that he could approach it. Luciano now regularly documents the underwater life of caimans in the shallow, murky waters of Brazil's Pantanal (the biggest wetland in the world), which contains the largest single crocodilian population on Earth.  Most aren't aggressive, but some individuals can be. The safest way to get close is when they are concentrating on a shoal of fish, says Luciano</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Luciano Candisani/2012 Veolia Environnement Wildlife Photographer of the Year</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397840826\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/16/1350410191053/Hare-in-a-landscape-007.jpg\" alt=\"Veolia: Hare in a landscape\" width=\"753\" height=\"480\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\"><strong>Nature in black and white award</strong> Winner: Hare in a landscape Robert Zoehrer (Austria) This steep, ploughed field, in Burgenland, Austria, with a ribbon of dazzling yellow oilseed rape on the horizon and a swath of green to the side, was just what Robert was looking for.

He'd spent nearly a decade studying and photographing cheetahs in the Serengeti National Park, Tanzania, and he knew that the female s behaviour meant one thing: a hunting lesson was due to begin. The female moved away, leaving the calf lying on the ground near her cubs. At first, the cubs took no notice of it. But when it struggled jerkily to its feet the cubs natural predatory instincts were triggered, says Gregoire. Each cub gaze locked on to the calf as it made a break for freedom. The lesson repeated itself several times, with the cubs ignoring the calf when it was on the ground and catching it whenever it tried to escape an exercise that affords the cubs the chance to practise chases in preparation for when they will have to do so for real </span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gregoire Bouguereau/2012 Veolia Environnement Wildlife Photographer of the Year</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397840785\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/16/1350410167956/Secret-lives-001.jpg\" alt=\"Veolia: Secret lives\" width=\"702\" height=\"480\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\"><strong>Urban wildlife award</strong> Winner: Secret lives by Kai Fagerstr\u00f6m (Finland) About 40 or so years ago, a family of 13 people lived in this cottage in Suomusj rvi, Salo, Finland. They have long gone, but though the building has fallen into disrepair, it is still a winter home to many woodland creatures, including this red squirrel, which lives in the attic. Kai has spent the past 15 years documenting the secret life of such places. Deserted buildings are so full of contradictions, he says. I am fascinated by the way nature reclaims spaces that were, essentially, only ever on loan to humans. He usually starts off with a particular image in mind.

It was the dry season, and they had been gorging on fish trapped in the pools left behind as the water receded from the river. One big alligator had clearly eaten its fill. So I set my tripod and camera up about seven metres and focused on his eyes. Just after sunset, Larry set his flash on the lowest setting, enough to catch the eyeshine in the alligator's eyes. Like cats, an alligator has a tapetum lucidum at the back of each eye a structure that reflects light back into the photoreceptor cells to make the most of low light. The colour of eyeshine differs from species to species. In alligators, it glows red one good way to locate alligators on a dark night. The greater the distance between its eyes, the longer the reptile, in this case, very long</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Larry Lynch /2012 Veolia Environnement Wildlife Photographer of the Year</span> </figcaption> </figure>",
  "<p>The Kremlin is poised to take control of BP's troubled Siberian oil joint venture as the boss of Russia's state-controlled oil company Rosneft flew to London to clinch the deal.</p> <p>BP's partners in the TNK-BP joint venture \u2013 billionaires Mikhail Fridman, German Khan, Viktor Vekselberg and Len Blavatnik \u2013 have also agreed to sell their 50% stake to Rosneft for about $28bn&#xa0;(\u00a317bn).</p> <p>At the same time BP is expected to agree a deal this week that will see the British oil giant take a 10-15% stake in Rosneft plus cash in exchange for its half of TNK-BP.</p> <p>Spokesmen for BP, Rosneft and AAR \u2013 the consortium of billionaires \u2013 declined to comment.</p> <p>If the deals go ahead Rosneft will become by far the world's biggest publicly traded oil company, producing 4.5m barrels of oil a day.</p> <p>It will also bring an end to BP's troublesome relationship with the billionaires, which forced Bob Dudley, BP's chief executive, to resign as head of the venture and flee Russia during a bitter row in 2008.</p> <p>Igor Sechin, Rosneft's chief executive and a former deputy prime minister of Russia and close associate of President Putin, flew to London on Wednesday, sources said, to seal the deal with executives in advance of BP's sale auction deadline, which expires at 9am on Thursday.</p> <p>Sechin's visit comes after Russia's current deputy prime minister Arkady Dvorkovich told reporters in Moscow that Rosneft had signed a deal to buy AAR's stake in TNK-BP.</p> <p>However, Dvorkovich cautioned that agreement will require government approval. Rosneft could pull out of the deal to buy AAR's stake while snapping up BP's.</p> <p>Analysts said the deal will be beneficial to Putin politically, as it will allow the state to benefit from BP's expertise but not allow the British company a controlling interest.</p> <p>\"This strengthens Putin's national champion,\" Iain Armstrong, an analyst at Brewin Dolphin, told Bloomberg. \"BP will stay in Russia, but perhaps in a more limited way. The Russian oil industry is in a big state of flux.\"</p> <p>Analysts speculated that Rosneft was planning to buy BP's stake in shares rather than cash because it does not have enough available capital to buy out both AAR and BP's stakes at the same time.</p> <p>It was also pointed out that a large cash windfall for BP may be seized upon by US authorities, who are still negotiating with BP over compensation for 2010's Gulf of Mexico oil spill disaster.</p> <p>Last year AAR rejected a $32bn offer for its half from BP and Rosneft. That came after the billionaires blocked a $7.8bn share swap and exploration deal between Rosneft and BP. Relations deteriorated further, with Fridman quitting as TNK-BP's chief executive in May 2012.</p> <p>The following month BP put its stake in the joint venture up for sale. BP, which is in the process of tidying up its global assets, has been in talks with both AAR and Rosneft about a sale.</p> <p>Sources close to AAR confirmed that the billionaires do not intend to submit a bid for BP's stake, and said BP had informed the billionaires that it expects to receive a bid from another party, which they understand to be Rosneft.</p> <p>The AAR source said the billionaires had attempted to buy a 25% stake from BP, but the suggestion was rebuffed. AAR then began talks with banks to help finance a bid for the full 50% stake. \"[But] by that time, we found that so many key banks were already committed to Rosneft and BP, and could not fund us due to an exclusivity arrangement already in place,\" the source said.</p> <p>TNK-BP hasn't paid dividends on any income this year because it has lacked a full board since December. Management recommended a $4.1bn interim dividend on 2012 profits, according to documents seen by Bloomberg. The board may decide to pay the dividend in the next few weeks.</p> <p>BP's shares closed up 3.75% to 451.7p.</p>",

The other is his habit of pressing his advantage too far, seeking a kind of alpha-male moment that can seem bullying instead of strong.

The candidates each bickered with CNN\u2019s Candy Crowley about turns and time allotments, but Romney went at it earlier and more often \u2013 sometimes justifiably, but never successfully. He also tried too hard to pre-empt the president\u2019s increased aggression with aggression of his own, which doesn\u2019t work well in a town-hall format, where the candidates are already circling one another like sharks.

His wooden reply began, \"An important topic, and one which I learned a great deal about, particularly as I was serving as governor of my state...\":</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><strong>Mitt Romney</strong>: An important topic, and one which I learned a great deal about, particularly as I was serving as governor of my state, because I had the chance to pull together a cabinet and all the applicants seemed to be men.</p> <p>And I went to my staff, and I said, \"How come all the people for these jobs are all men.\" They said, \"Well, these are the people that have the qualifications.\" And I said, \"Well, gosh, can't we, can't we find some women that are also qualified?\"</p> <p>And so we took a concerted effort to go out and find women who had backgrounds that could be qualified to become members of our cabinet.</p> <p>I went to a number of women's groups and said, \"Can you help us find folks,\" and they brought us whole binders full of women.</p> </blockquote> <p>Here's&#xa0;<a href=\"http://blog.thephoenix.com/blogs/talkingpolitics/archive/2012/10/16/mind-the-binder.aspx\">what actually happened, according to the&#xa0;<strong>Boston Phoenix</strong>'s David Bernstein</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>What actually happened was that in 2002 \u2013 prior to the election, not even knowing yet whether it would be a Republican or Democratic administration \u2013 a bipartisan group of women in Massachusetts formed MassGAP to address the problem of few women in senior leadership positions in state government. There were more than 40 organizations involved with the Massachusetts Women's Political Caucus (also bipartisan) as the lead sponsor.</p> <p>They did the research and put together the binder full of women qualified for all the different cabinet positions, agency heads, and authorities and commissions. They presented this binder to Governor Romney when he was elected.</p> <p>I have written about this before, in various contexts; tonight I've checked with several people directly involved in the MassGAP effort who confirm that this history as I've just presented it is correct \u2013 and that Romney's claim tonight, that he asked for such a study, is false.</p> </blockquote> <p>If you are in search of ridiculous Internet content, you might start with the Binders Full of Women <a href=\"http://bindersfullofwomen.tumblr.com/\">Tumblr</a>, or the Romney's Binder <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Romney_Binder\">Twitter account</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Romney_Binder/status/258395129562411011\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>EXCLUSIVE LEAKED PHOTO OF BINDER #1<a href=\"https://twitter.com/search/%23bindersfullofwomen\">#bindersfullofwomen</a> <a href=\"http://t.co/gHHAA2oD\" title=\"http://twitter.com/Romney_Binder/status/258395129562411011/photo/1\">twitter.com/Romney_Binder/\u2026</a></p>&mdash; Romney's Binder (@Romney_Binder) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Romney_Binder/status/258395129562411011\" data-datetime=\"2012-10-17T02:32:54+00:00\">October 17, 2012</a></blockquote> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-507ebd46c0e361310bc6d0cc\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-17T14:14:30.536Z\">3.14pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Romney's botched argument on Libya</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>This was supposed to be the topic on which Romney made a damaging case against Obama's leadership. The case seemed brick-strong.</p> <p>For weeks after the Benghazi attack the Obama administration disseminated a misleading version of events. Secretary of State Clinton and President Obama both said the anti-Islam video produced in California played a role in precipitating the attack. The official version of events described a protest outside the Benghazi mission that gave way to armed assault.&#xa0;</p> <p>Then we were abruptly told there was no protest. It was all made up, and it came out of the secretary of state's mouth. The<a href=\"http://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/ps/2012/10/198791.htm\"> US State Department background briefing</a> in a conference call last week described a quiet night that suddenly gave way to explosions. It is self-evident that security at the mission was inadequate, despite official requests for more security support.</p> <p>Romney's argument should have been a strong one. The Obama administration had had to retract similar early inaccuracies in its account of the death of Osama bin Laden. But Romney decided to try to catch the president in what he thought was a misstatement. He jumped out of his chair and nearly charged at Obama. Here's the transcript:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><strong>CROWLEY:</strong>&#xa0;Governor, if you want to reply just quickly to this, please.</p> <p><strong>ROMNEY:</strong>&#xa0;Yeah, I \u2014 I certainly do. I certainly do. I \u2014 I think it\u2019s interesting the president just said something which is that on the day after the attack, he went in the Rose Garden and said that this was an act of terror. You said in the Rose Garden the day after the attack it was an act of terror? It was not a spontaneous demonstration?</p> <p><strong>OBAMA:</strong>&#xa0;Please proceed.</p> <p><strong>ROMNEY:</strong>&#xa0;Is that what you\u2019re saying?</p> <p><strong>OBAMA:</strong>&#xa0;Please proceed, Governor.</p> <p><strong>ROMNEY:</strong>&#xa0;I \u2014 I \u2014 I want to make sure we get that for the record, because it took the president 14 days before he called the attack in Benghazi an act of terror.</p> <p><strong>OBAMA:</strong>&#xa0;Get the transcript.</p> <p><strong>CROWLEY:</strong>&#xa0;It \u2014 he did in fact, sir.</p> <p>So let me, let me call it an act of terrorism...</p> <p><strong>OBAMA:</strong>&#xa0;Can you say that a little louder, Candy? (Laughter, applause.)</p> </blockquote> <p>Romney hung himself out to dry. Somehow he made the discussion of Libya into a farce that ended with the audience laughing at his expense. You couldn't have predicted that.</p>  <p><strong>Update:</strong> the White House transcript of the president's remarks in the Rose Garden following the Benghazi attack <a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2012/09/12/remarks-president-deaths-us-embassy-staff-libya\">is here</a>.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-10-17T15:13:01.596Z\">at 4.13pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-507eb9fa58f91d7bbadac7ad\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-17T14:00:26.465Z\">3.00pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Do you count yourself among those who don't think it's possible to <strong>declare a debate winner</strong>?

Did you watch? It was a humdinger. Here's a summary of where things stand:</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>In a confrontational joint appearance, an energized President Obama and a pugnacious Governor Romney went to the mat</strong>, not quite literally, over energy policy, job creation, taxes, trade policy, women's health, Libya and more. The possibility for a knockout punch had the fighters swinging big all night long.</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Gone was the halting, listless Obama of the first debate</strong>. He repeatedly lashed out at Romney, starting by calling him an \"oil guy\" and ending by bringing up the 47% when Romney had no more time to speak. The governor sought to repay the president in kind, accusing him of shutting down oil drilling on federal land and personally investing in China. Were voters turned off by all the fighting? Or was the televised smackdown impossible to turn off? The debate went over time and was still going strong at the end.</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>The supposed debate rules were shredded</strong>. Moderator Candy Crowley asked multiple follow-up questions and performed spot-checks of fact, making for some of the richest exchanges of the night. Most prominently she corrected Romney on Libya, saying that Obama had in fact described the Benghazi attack as an act of terror, over the governor's statements to the contrary. As a result Romney was widely seen as having fumbled the point.&#xa0;</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Crowley nobly struggled to enforce time limits</strong>, prompting several moments of babbling cross-talk as Romney, in particular, sought to finish a point or make a last rebuttal. Meanwhile the president gently clung to the mic all night, and he finished with a 3-minute-plus advantage over the governor in speaking time.&#xa0;</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>The exchanges felt personal</strong>. Romney sought to cross-examine Obama like a prosecutor. Obama accused Romney of being to the right of George W. Bush. The governor accused the president of investing his pension in China. The president accused the governor of being a pioneer of outsourcing. Romney seemed angry, Obama seemed annoyed.</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Who won? The polls say the president</strong>. <a href=\"http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2012/10/16/breaking-cnn-poll-obama-edges-romney-in-debate/?hpt=hp_t1%20\">A CNN snap poll</a> gave the debate to Obama 46-39. <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-250_162-57533850/poll-obama-edges-romney-in-second-debate/?tag=MaxDeep;leadHed\">A CBS poll</a> said the president won 37-30 (with a large proportion of respondents apparently opting for neither).&#xa0;</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/grossdm/status/258556931336183809\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Oh dear.

  "<p>That sharp intake of breath you can hear? It's the world running out of patience. Frustrated by years of euro-muddle, exasperated by the deepening crisis and worried at the knock-on effect on trade, growth and prosperity, leading politicians and business figures from east and west are adopting an increasingly critical tone towards Europe's handling of its debt-encrusted economy.</p> <p>To coincide with Thursday's crucial EU summit in Brussels, a range of powerful figures from business, finance and politics in China, Brazil, the US, Argentina, Japan and Mexico told the Guardian and its partner papers in the Europa project that time is running out for Europe. What the world wants now is decisive action.</p> <p>As finance minister in one of the world's most perky economies, Brazil, Guido Mantega has perhaps more right than most to criticise. Brazil is eager to avoid Europe tilting the world into a deepening recession, which may harm Brazil's commodity-fuelled boom.</p> <p>\"2012 is a lost year for Europe, that's a fact. The objective now is to keep the situation from getting worse over the next few years,\" Mantega told the Europa group of papers. He is particularly impatient with the German position, which, he says, has elevated the interest of German savers over the wellbeing of most of Europe.</p> <p>\"Germany is looking in only one direction,\" Mantega says. \"Its proposal of economic austerity seems logical vis-\u00e0-vis German voters, who don't want to foot the bill for other countries or pay for their lack of responsibility. However, the Germans will lose too if Spanish banks go bankrupt. The Spanish and Portuguese governments are making big efforts. Germany ought to be more flexible when it comes to helping those governments, instead of putting a knife to their throats.\"</p> <p>China is also preoccupied about its own economic prospects when its biggest consumer market is contracting sharply. In an interview in Beijing, a well-connected former diplomat, Cui Hongjian, said there was a measure of exasperation among the Chinese leadership at the dilatory response in Brussels to the crisis. The Chinese, he says, \"ask why Europeans argue so much but do not take action\".</p> <p>\"China must do something to stop this decline in its exports,\" he says, adding that Chinese leaders have two frustrations: that the debt crisis has almost totally overwhelmed European policy-making, and that as ever there is no single European entity that China can do business with.</p> <p>As a result, Beijing has begun stepping up bilateral relations with individual countries, particularly Germany. \"I think that if there was only one person for China to deal with, it would be more efficient.\"</p> <p>Another official, Jin Liqun, chairman of the China Investment Corporation supervisory board, said: \"The way the eurozone has handled the debt-resolution issue has been more problematic. Too much time has been wasted on debates over the terms and conditions of piecemeal bailouts. Political leaders have been digging in on their own agendas, with their objectives pulling in different directions.\"</p> <p>For the Mexican Carlos Slim, the world's richest man, cash-strapped governments need to get to grips with unaffordable welfare bills and lengthening lifespans: \"There are places where people are retiring at 60 when life expectancy, for somebody who gets to 60, is 85 or more. There are universal health-provision programmes that are inefficient and often open to tourists. The retirement age should be higher \u2026 In the service societies of today, where physical strength and physical work is less important than experience and knowledge, it is sad that a person stops work at 60 when they are in their prime.\"</p> <p>Slim, who recently increased his exposure in Europe with stakes in phone companies in the Netherlands and Austria, calls for a revolution in working hours such that people don't work eight-hour days for five days a week, but three days of 11 hours each. He says welfare should be tightly aligned with engagement in retraining programmes and that states should drum up cash through privatisations.</p> <p>\"What Europe should do is sell assets. The state does too many things. It should do two things. Sell assets, to reduce debt and deficits, but also invite the private sector \u2026 to make the investments the state no longer has any business doing \u2026 motorways, even hospitals and schools can all be financed with private money.\"</p> <p>Roberto Lavagna is a man who knows a thing or two about a crisis and how to overcome it. He was the economy minister&#xa0;who helped Argentina pull out&#xa0;of its own debt crisis a decade ago. For&#xa0;him, it makes no sense for Europe to be&#xa0;permanently flushing resources through banks, while consumers despair.</p> <p>\"I'm amazed at the enormous sums of money they give to banks, and I wonder: why not help out consumers who are in debt? Because rescheduling loans, lowering interest rates etc will eventually help consumers regain confidence, rekindle demand and get the economy going.\"</p> <p>Lavagna is unconvinced by austerity. \"The cuts destroying people's purchasing power are recessionary and don't yield results in terms of fiscal equilibrium,\" he says. \"Germany directed this current, backed moreover by an EU government in Brussels with no power or influence, and an International Monetary Fund that had always supported this blueprint. That was the blueprint which they offered Argentina and which we rejected in 2002.\"</p> <p>Michael Bloomberg, the billionaire mayor of New York, says that states have to balance budgets somehow. \"You could make the case that David Cameron is doing what's right, that he is addressing the issues. I don't know if he is right or wrong, but he is showing courage to stand up and do that.</p> <p>\"Can you do the same thing in Spain with an enormous unemployment rate? Can you do the same thing in Greece or Italy, where the number of people that pay taxes are relatively low? In America, everybody pays taxes. There may be a handful of people that cheat, but everybody files a tax return, and so if only a small percentage of the people don't, it is easier to enforce the law because it is manageable to go after them.

  "<p>Mitt Romney continued his march towards a centrist position on immigration during the second presidential debate, presenting a friendly face to undocumented immigrants starkly in contrast to his previous position.</p> <p>Quizzed about his support for the policy of \"self-deportation\" that he articulated during the primary season debates between Republicans, he portrayed it as a matter of choice on the part of individuals. \"People make their own choice, and if they can't find the job they want, then they'll make a decision to go to a place where they have better opportunities.\"</p> <p>But that ignored a crucial aspect of the \"self-deportation\" policy espoused not just by Romney during the primary season but by his main immigration advisers, notably the Kansas politician Kris Kobach who was the architect of several of the laws clamping down on undocumented immigrants introduced across the US. </p> <p>As Kobach <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/feb/24/kris-kobach-immigration-law-mastermind\">explained to the Guardian</a> earlier this year, the idea would be to make life so uncomfortable for undocumented Latinos and jobs so hard to find that they would be forced out.</p> <p>Romney, mindful no doubt of the importance of the Hispanic vote in several crucial battleground status such as Florida and Nevada, also went further than he has before in embracing the idea of offering a pathway to citizenship to undocumented immigrants who came to the US as children. He said that service in the US military would be \"one way\" that such a pathway would be found \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-503544_162-57364444-503544/romney-on-immigration-im-for-self-deportation/\">in contrast to previous statements</a> that military service would be the only way residency could be obtained.</p> <p>Barack Obama did overstep the mark in one regard, however, in that he accused Romney of exhorting Arizona's law clamping down on undocumented Hispanics as a \"model for the nation\". In fact, during the primary season Romney lauded just one specific part of the Arizona law, SB 1070, called E-Verify \u2013 a system that allows employers to check a federal database to see if people applying for work are documented or not.</p>",
  "<p>Never let facts get in the way of a good debate. On Tuesday, Barack Obama and Mitt Romney clashed repeatedly on the issues during their second presidential confrontation, and occasionally the truth seemed to get lost among all the finger jabbing.</p> <h2>Claim</h2> <p>Obama said that the day after the attack on the consulate <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/17/romney-obama-benghazi-defeated-debate\">he called it an \"act of terror\"</a>. Conservatives are challenging that claim.</p> <h2>The facts</h2> <p>The transcript of the president's remarks show that he was speaking about the Benghazi attack and then noted it occurred on the anniversary of al-Qaida's 9/11 assault on the US. Obama then said: \"No acts of terror will ever shake the resolve of this great nation, alter that character, or eclipse the light of the values that we stand for.\"</p> <p>The president did not explicitly single out the Benghazi attack as an act of terror. But he did appear to be referring to it in those terms, along with 9/11. He immediately went on to speak about the deaths in Benghazi again.</p> <p>The next day, September 13, in a campaign appearance in Las Vegas, Obama used similar language. \"And we want to send a message all around the world \u2014 anybody who would do us harm: No act of terror will dim the light of the values that we proudly shine on the rest of the world, and no act of violence will shake the resolve of the United States of America,\" he said.</p> <p>Romney's surprise at being called out over the claim is perhaps understandable because in the days that followed, the administration stuck to the line that the assault was a response to the anti-Muslim video. The White House sent the US ambassador to the UN, Susan Rice, to say that on television talk shows the following weekend. No mention was made of a terrorist attack.</p> <p>Finally, a week after the attack, Matthew Olsen, director of the National Counterterrorism Center, called the killings a terrorist attack, but even that was not picked up by most other administration officials. In the following week the defence secretary, Leon Panetta, and other officials followed.</p> <h2>Claim</h2> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/17/gun-control-presidential-debate\">Romney defended his opposition to any new gun controls</a> by saying that there was already a ban in place for fully automatic weapons</p> <h2>The facts</h2> <p>That is not correct \u2013 it is possible for civilians to own such weapons if they are prepared to go through extended federal background checks including fingerprinting and pay a $200 tax. \"To say that fully automatic weapons don't exist in civilian hands is inaccurate,\" said Josh Sugarmann, head of the gun control advocacy group the Violence Policy Center.</p> <p>But neither was Barack Obama entirely open when it came to the issue of guns. Asked what had happened to his 2008 promise to keep AK-47s out of the hands of criminals, Obama signalled that he was prepared to see \"if we can get an assault weapons ban reintroduced.\" However, there has been no sign that the Obama administration is genuinely prepared to expend political capital on driving such a renewal of the ban through a Republican-controlled House of Representatives, or to incur by doing so the wrath of the powerful gun lobby and the National Rifle Association.</p> <h2>Claim</h2> <p>Obama accused Romney of supporting a draconian Arizona immigration law that allows police officers to ask people for identification if they suspect they have entered the United States illegally.</p> <h2>The facts</h2> <p>Romney said he had only singled out a portion of the law requiring employers to \"e-verify\" the legal status of employees as a model. A transcript of Romney's comment, made during a Republican primary debate, seems more or less support his version. During a discussion of immigration policy, he said: \"You know, I think you see a model in Arizona. They passed a law here that says \u2013 that says that people who come here and try and find work, that the employer is required to look them up on e-verify.\"</p> <p>However, immigration remains a sore point with Romney for many, particularly among Hispanic voters, because the former Massachusetts governor has advocated a \"self-deportation\" approach that aims to make undocumented immigrants uncomfortable enough to leave on their own.</p> <h2>Claim</h2> <p>Romney would not have taken Detroit \"bankrupt\"; instead he \"recommended\" auto revival plan.</p> <h2>The facts</h2> <p>The Republican candidate did not back the process that saw General Motors and Chrysler get back on its feet. He opposed using government money to bail out the carmakers, instead favouring privately financed bankruptcy restructuring. At the time, the auto industry was haemorrhaging money and US banks were in no position to loan. Under Romney's plan, it is likely both companies would have gone bust.</p> <h2>Claim</h2> <p>Obama's administration has created 5 million jobs over the last 30 months</p> <h2>The facts</h2> <p>According to the US labour department, 4.5 million jobs have been created over that stated time period. But Obama neglected to mention that in the earlier months of his tenure in the White House, America lost almost as many jobs as it has since added to the economy. So he is a net job creator, but only by a sliver.</p>",
  "<p>Mexican drug authorities are seeking permission to exhume the remains of the parents of a drug cartel leader in an attempt to find out if a body stolen from a funeral home after a shootout was that of the brutal gang boss.</p> <p>Heriberto Lazcano, known as \"the executioner\", is believed to have been killed in a shootout with marines near the town of Progreso, about 80 miles from the US border, on 7 October11 days ago. Two bodies were fingerprinted and handed over to a funeral parlour, but the following day a masked and heavily armed gang snatched both. The Mexican navy said the fingerprints revealed one of the bodies to be Lazcano.</p> <p>Drug prosecutor Jos\u00e9 Cuitl\u00e1huac Salinas said they now wanted to exhume the Zetas cartel boss's parents in order to carry out DNA tests.</p> <p>Salinas said Lazcano's parents died years ago, and were buried in the central Hidalgo state. An autopsy was performed on the stolen corpse before the theft and officials apparently saved blood or bloody clothing.</p> <p>The Zetas are known for their strong esprit de corps, and often go to great lengths to recover the bodies of cartel members killed in clashes with other gangs and the authorities.</p>",
  "<p>On a windswept mid-October day the harbourside at Ilfracombe is usually the domain of just a few fishermen, dog-walkers and hardy fresh-air freaks.</p> <p>On Wednesday, it was heaving with people who had come from near and far to gawp, wonder and talk about Damien Hirst's Verity, a 20m-high statue of a naked woman yielding a sword and staring out to sea.</p> <p>\"Impressive,\" said James Silvesto, who had picked up his nine-year-old son Charlie from the local primary school and whizzed him down to the harbour on his moped. \"She's a magnet. She's got a personality that draws you in.\" Charlie was not so sure. \"A bit rude, a bit weird,\" was his verdict.</p> <p>There had been scepticism in some quarters ahead of the installation of the statue, with some thinking the exposed womb and other internal workings distasteful. A few of those milling around while workers put the finishing touches to it remained unconvinced.</p> <p>Engineer Melvyn Robinson said he found it \"grotesque\". \"It's not my cup of tea, I prefer my art a bit more conventional,\" he said. \"It's typical Damien Hirst, a bit Hannibal Lecter-ish. He can't help himself, can he?\"</p> <p>Boatman Paul Barbeary was also unconvinced. \"I just think she's in completely the wrong place. What has she got to do with Ilfracombe? A mermaid would be better.\"</p> <p>Pensioner Eve Martinson, who was holidaying in Cornwall but had decided to take a spin to north Devon to have a look at Verity. \"She's a bit, well, naked for me,\" said Martinson. \"I don't like her nipples very much, a bit too pointy. And those bits and pieces of her inside. You have no choice but to look.\"</p> <p>But shopkeepers were delighted at the attention the resort was getting because of Verity. The ice-cream parlours and fish and chips shops were doing good business. Hirst's own restaurant (he also has a home nearby) was, unsurprisingly, full.</p> <p>\"I think the statue is brilliant,\" said Felicity Cowley, a consultant at the Driftwood art gallery, which had a few Hirsts on the walls. \"A midweek day in October is not usually very busy. We've had loads of people in. Whether you like it or not, it's a phenomenon, an attraction.\"</p> <p>And most of those who made the pilgrimage to Verity on Wednesday were positive. Tim Brownings, a local tour guide, can see the statue from his front room. \"I was a bit worried she'd wreck my view of the sea,\" he said. \"I thinks she enhances it actually. But for me the best thing is that she is getting people talking about art.\"</p> <p>People like harbour master Rob Lawson, who was happy to wax lyrical about the merits of Verity: \"One half of her is calm, beautiful; the other half is provocative \u2013 the human as an animal.\"</p> <p>He is delighted the statue, on loan to the town for 20 years, has created a buzz. And if nothing else she will make it easy for visiting yacht captains to find Ilfracombe. \"Some people say they find it difficult to see the harbour entrance from out to sea. They won't be able to miss it now.\"</p>",

That is the clearest indication of their lack of political will and initiative. They are simply disconnected from the real activists and the grass roots organisations ...</p> <p>Look at examples from history - any alternative political force trying to unseat a long-standing power would seize on any opportunity to galvanize its political support. That kind of political support is not going to happen in Paris or [Washington] DC.</p> <p>Why not seize the initiative? There are practical problems with it, but if there is political will you can see how things can be over turned. But you don\u2019t see any attempt at doing that - We have seen very few visits by SNC leaders.</p> </blockquote> <p>If credible a leadership does not emerge inside the country, Syria faces five more years of civil war, he warned. Syrians will give up on the uprising if they don\u2019t get clarity from the opposition about the alternatives to the Assad regime, he argued.</p> <p>Calls by the international envoy Lakhdar Brahimi for a ceasefire are a \u201ccosmetic\u201d exercise to try to show that something is being done, Sharro added. The countries backing Brahimi\u2019s mission are also \"fuelling the fire\" in Syria, he claimed.</p> <p>The current international squabble for regional dominance over Syria is frustrating the emergence of opposition leaders, Sharro argued. Saudi Arabia, for example, should stop funding Salafist groups, because they are distorting the conflict, and thwarting the growth of a more organic opposition inside Syria.</p> <p>Sharro called for the conflict to become \u201cdeinteranationalized\u201d.</p> <p>He criticised the west\u2019s \u201creluctant meddling\u201d on Syria as stuck between neither fully committing to arming the rebels, nor finding a peaceful solution. \u201cBoth the US and the international community are making matters worse,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Members of the current regime, such as vice president Farouq al-Sharaa, could play a role in an alternative government to avoid the disaster that occur in Iraq following de-Ba\u2019athification, Sharro said. But other former members of the regime, such as Manaf Tlass, lack political credibility, he claimed.</p> <p>Sharro said the key question is:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Would Syria rather face five [or] ten years of all-consuming conflict that is increasing becoming sectarian in certain areas, or would you rather have a political solution that allows a transition to a better future?</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-canonical-url=\"\" >  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;ab-player&quot; data-boourl=&quot;http://audioboo.fm/boos/1011167-karlremarks-calls-on-the-snc-to-set-up-base-inside-syria/embed&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://audioboo.fm/boos/1011167-karlremarks-calls-on-the-snc-to-set-up-base-inside-syria&quot;&gt;listen to &amp;#x2018;@KarlreMarks calls on the SNC to set up base inside #Syria&amp;#x2019; on Audioboo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;(function() { var po = document.createElement(&quot;script&quot;); po.type = &quot;text/javascript&quot;; po.async = true; po.src = &quot;http://d15mj6e6qmt1na.cloudfront.net/assets/embed.js&quot;; var s = document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;)[0]; s.parentNode.insertBefore(po, s); })();&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-507e8ec258f91d7bbadac78d\" class=\"block is-summary\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-17T10:56:02.712Z\">11.56am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Brahimi heads for Damascus \u2013 CNN</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>CNN reports that Lakhdar Brahimi, the international envoy on Syria, <a href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/2012/10/17/world/meast/syria-civil-war/index.html\">will travel to Damascus</a> later today.</p> <p>This morning he has been meeting the Lebanese president in Beirut.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-10-17T11:40:46.105Z\">at 12.40pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-507e85e5c0e361310bc6d09c\" class=\"block is-summary\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-17T10:18:13.484Z\">11.18am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Regime dismisses ceasefire without rebel unity</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The Syrian government has poured cold water on Lakhdar Brahimi's efforts to broker a temporary ceasefire during the Muslim holiday of Eid al-Adha later this month, the Associated Press reports.</p> <p>The regime's objection appears to be that the rebels on the other side have no unified leadership to agree to it.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Syria's state-run al-Thawra newspaper, a government mouthpiece, said Wednesday that the biggest obstacle to the truce was the lack of an authority to sign for the rebels.</p> <p>\"There is the state, represented by the government and the army on one front, but who is on the other front?\" the paper asked in an editorial.</p> <p>Brahimi, the joint UN-Arab League envoy, arrived in Beirut on today as part of a regional tour.</p> </blockquote> <p>Syrian foreign ministry spokesman Jihad Makdissi said in a statement to the state news agency that the government was waiting for Brahimi to come to Damascus to convey to officials there the results of his tour.

  "<p>I haven't seen Sarah Esdaile's production of Cat on a Hot Tin Roof at the West Yorkshire Playhouse. But now it's a fascinating experience to watch the <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0051459/\" title=\"\">1958 film version of Tennessee Williams's play</a>, adapted and directed by Richard Brooks, and starring Elizabeth Taylor and Paul Newman \u2013 and effectively to read this movie against the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2012/oct/16/cat-hot-tin-roof-zoe-boyle-jamie-parker?intcmp=ILCMUSIMG9382\" title=\"\">theatre review from Michael Billington and the readers' comments now building up on the site</a>.</p> <p>This was a film that was well enough regarded at the time: it earned six Oscar nominations and three Bafta nominations. But yes, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2012/sep/30/cat-on-a-hot-tin-roof\" title=\"\">Michael Billington is surely right</a>: you can't watch it now without being aware of the way in which the issue of homosexuality has been censored for the screen. Brick, the drunk and washed-up ex-football star played by Newman, has very clearly failed to come to terms with his sexuality and his real feelings for Skipper, the old football buddy who died after an ambiguous accident. His wife, Maggie (Taylor), is crucified by her desperation to make Brick desire her: <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDk0JtQHc0A\" title=\"\">she is played with mesmerically feline intensity</a> radiating from that perfect oval face, the pristine white dress over her opaque slip cinched to accentuate a conspicuously slim waist and the absolute impossibility of being pregnant. And a very real black-comic pleasure of the movie is how hateful we are as children. WC Fields himself would nod grimly at how these appalling little beasts behave, plunging their unwashed hands into tubs of ice-cream or firing nerve-shreddingly loud toy six-shooters at the grownups.</p> <p>Everyone in Brick's family is lying, to themselves and others. Brick's father, an overbearing southern patriarch (played by Burl Ives) gruesomely called Big Daddy by his nearest and supposedly dearest, and \"Cap'n\" by the servants, has inoperable cancer. But his doctor and family lie to him about the seriousness of his condition, claiming it's just a \"spastic colon\", and poor pathetic Daddy now struts and sneers for the last time, glorying in his phoney release from imminent death. But without a clear sense that Brick is in denial about being gay, the parallel with Big Daddy's cancer-denial has been upended and the whole issue has surely been fudged. Is the movie guilty of precisely the evasion the play is attacking?</p> <p>Well, maybe. But actually that denial, that erasure, now has an interestingly modernist flavour. Over and over again, the characters will rant and rave about \"mendacity\", about not coming out with the truth, not facing up to the facts. Big Daddy will ask Brick: \"What are you disgusted about?\" He will ask him about Skipper and Brick will holler back: \"You're making it sound shameful and filthy!\" It? What? Make what sound shameful?</p> <p>These endless and mysterious repetitions give the movie a weirdly Pinteresque feel. It reminds me of <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0057490/\" title=\"\">Joseph Losey's The Servant</a>. Homosexuality is everywhere and nowhere in Cat on a Hot Tin Roof. And perhaps that unspokenness is realer than the play. Perhaps the unsaid would remain unsaid in just this way, creating a dysfunctional miasma with which the movie, almost by accident, creates something with a more direct line to a kind of honesty \u2013 or perhaps an honest transcription of dishonesty. In real life, in the 1950s, off the stage and off the screen, people were governed by their own self-censorship code.</p> <p>It isn't a great performance from Paul Newman. After his one drunken flourish in the movie's \"offstage\" preliminary sequence, breaking his ankle after a boozy attempt to vault some hurdles, he is <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OchpaSIYrDY\" title=\"\">mostly moodily quiet and resentful</a>. He seems almost catatonic with self-hate. But perhaps 1950s audiences were more savvy about what was preying on his character's mind than we think. Certainly the movie industry itself would have picked up on the unspoken ambiguities. Looking at Paul Newman's impossibly beautiful face, paralysed, almost mask-like with uncertainty and pain, you might think now of <a href=\"http://thehairpin.com/2011/08/scandals-of-classic-hollywood-rock-hudson-hollywoods-most-eligible-bachelor/\" title=\"\">Rock Hudson</a> or Monty Clift \u2013 men who lived out a Brick-like career in the closet.</p> <p>But the movie's tacit approach has another advantage \u2013 and again, I would say this is an advantage that by accident or design brings the movie closer to real life. Does Brick himself realise what his feelings were? They are a secret from others, sure (although I get the strong feeling that Elizabeth Taylor's Maggie is entirely undeceived) \u2013 but perhaps they are also a secret from Brick himself.</p> <p>Now of course I should travel to the West Yorkshire Playhouse to read the play against the film \u2026</p> <p>\u2022 This article was commissioned responding to the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2012/sep/30/cat-on-a-hot-tin-roof\" title=\"\">reader thread underneath Michael Billington's article on Cat on a Hot Tin Roof</a>, particularly comments by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/18651406\" title=\"\">butchluva</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/18583886\" title=\"\">Stauffenberg1943</a></p>",
  "<p>If Britain's industrial power is in decline, as we are now told on a regular basis, then how has it managed to remain one of the world's biggest manufacturers of arms? Fifth in the world for arms exports and first in arms development, the UK has an industrial success story that it is strangely reluctant to boast of.</p> <p>Of late, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/oct/10/angela-merkel-bae-eads-merger-german\" title=\"\">failed mergers</a> and controversies have brought the shadowy world of arms manufacturing out into the open, but weapons manufacturing giants such as BAE Systems or EADS are about as obscure as organisations employing thousands of people could possibly be \u2013 when industrial policy is talked about, it's seldom noticed that what this often means is contracts to build destroyers, bombs and fighter jets.</p> <p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BAE_Systems\" title=\"\">BAE's immense size </a>\u2013 it is the world's third-largest defence contractor \u2013 is hidden by the fact that its factories are seldom to be found in any of the UK's former industrial centres: it has no major public presence, and no particular interest in PR, bar minimising corruption scandals and keeping itself exceptionally quiet. As this week's revelations about a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/oct/15/mod-military-arms-firms\" title=\"\">\"revolving door\" from the defence ministry to the arms industry</a> make clear, it is as influential as it is lucrative. Yet to try and find traces of it in the UK is surprisingly difficult \u2013 a massive big business that doesn't seem to have left a built landscape, or at least not one that is easily visited.</p> <p>The success of something like BAE owes much to the indulgence of the state, which has subsidised and nurtured it to a degree unthinkable in any other sector of heavy industry, something which the UK supposedly disdained in favour of financial services and property speculation. The links have always been close as BAE is, after all, a former nationalised company \u2013 half of it was once the publicly owned British Aerospace. Smaller arms manufacturers such as Qinetiq are similarly para-state, formed out of the privatised section of the Defence Evaluation and Research Agency. Accordingly, the industry's activities are treated with the same degree of secrecy and seclusion as GCHQ or the secret services. However, much as MI6 hides in plain sight in their <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Secret_Intelligence_Service_building_-_Vauxhall_Cross_-_Vauxhall_-_London_-_24042004.jpg\" title=\"\">huge postmodernist fortress</a> on the south bank of the Thames, at least one BAE building is very visible indeed.</p> <p>Barrow-in-Furness is one of the safest Labour seats in the country, although one that elected a Conservative MP for two terms in the 1980s, almost entirely because of the fear that Labour would initiate nuclear disarmament. As if in return, the once-famous shipbuilding town, once fancifully dubbed \"the English Chicago\", was granted the vast Devonshire Dock Hall. This is where the Trident nuclear submarine programme is produced. The colossal complex sits near the centre of the small town, as large as several office blocks placed end to end, its white and yellow steel edifice dwarfing the sandstone tenements of Barrow Island. It's a surreal place \u2013 the highly profitable arms manufacture that goes on here somehow fails to impact on a depopulated, poor town in any positive way, other than sustaining at least some employment. But nuclear submarines still emerge from here at a rapid rate.</p> <p>Another relatively visible outpost is <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BAE_Systems_Surface_Fleet_Solutions\" title=\"\">BAE Systems Surface Fleet Solutions </a>of Scotstoun and Govan, in Glasgow \u2013 the surviving shipyards on a stretch of the Clyde that would once have boasted dozens. It builds <a href=\"http://www.royalnavy.mod.uk/The-Fleet/Ships/Destroyers/Type-45-Destroyers\" title=\"\">Type 45 destroyers</a>. The Govan yard faces the luxury executive apartments of the <a href=\"http://www.clydewaterfront.com/projects/greater-govan--glasgow-harbour/retail/glasgow_harbour_retail_and_leisure\" title=\"\">Glasgow Harbour development</a>, some of whose residents have complained about the un-picturesque sight of continued industrial manufacture. The Govan yard is actually the inadvertent legacy of the Upper Clyde Shipbuilders work-in of the early 70s, where shipyard workers occupied and eventually forced the nationalisation of the local yard, then faced with closure. It employs a handful of those it once did. Yet mostly, BAE is a matter of airfields in places far from residential areas \u2013 its major airfields are in Lancashire, on the far outskirts of Preston, and its main office is in a business park in Hampshire.</p> <p>Curiously, then, given the impenetrability of the landscape of arms manufacture, the most complete attempt to reckon with it comes from a poet, Andrew Jordan. His volume <a href=\"http://www.inpressbooks.co.uk/boneheads-utopia/\" title=\"\">Bonehead's Utopia</a> is a fantasy set in the military landscape of Gosport, where the Haslar immigration removal centre, a prison for asylum seekers, sits near to HMS Sultan, a navy engineering base. But his most recent book, <a href=\"http://www.nonism.org.uk/jordan.html\" title=\"\">Hegemonick</a>, is a frontal confrontation with the weird, unnerving spaces created by the army and the arms industry.</p> <p>It centres on Portsdown Hill, an area on the outskirts of Portsmouth that has long been a place of forts and encampments, and became particularly notorious with the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2001/feb/06/childprotection\" title=\"\">Paulsgrove riots</a>, caused by the alleged housing of convicted paedophiles on the local council estate. It's also the site for Qinetiq's Portsdown Technology Park, where destroyers and frigates are tested.</p> <p>Jordan's poetry obsessively walks and rewalks the forts, perimeter fences and archaeological sites, recalling childhood memories, obscure histories and urban myths, as a means to try and make sense of a secret landscape. In its concluding poem, How the Last of the Light is Held, he imagines the people of Paulsgrove descending upon the defence establishments and setting them on fire, as if upon realising the barbarity of the arms industry far exceeded that of misidentified innocents.</p> <blockquote> \"So they had gathered for a meeting of their parliament / in the park, by the swings, as is the custom / and then they moved in procession around the estate / going from door to door, collecting money, weapons / and recruiting volunteers, and then they went / to the houses of the state operatives / and they dragged the occupants outside to interrogate them, and then to execute / revenge for what had been done to them over the years.\" </blockquote> <p>The violence, the killing and maiming, at the heart of what the likes of BAE and Qinetiq so profitably produce, is here brought to the fore, and turned back upon them. It's a dreamlike, apocalyptic reminder of why the arms industry keeps so very quiet about itself.</p>",

Alan Johnson demonstrated that whatever a politician\u2019s attributes, those who repeatedly suggest that they\u2019d have to be dragged kicking and screaming to the top job rarely get there. George Osborne\u2019s fate appears tied to that of Mr Cameron. Whether or not his private life could withstand the scrutiny of the Number Ten goldfish bowl, Boris Johnson pledged last week not to return to the Commons until after his second term as mayor ends in 2016. If Mr Cameron fails to win a majority in 2015, the Tory party may need a new leader before then. William Hague, the traditional \u2018if Dave falls under a bus\u2019 candidate, is unlikely to fancy a second stint as leader of the opposition in such circumstances.</p> <p>Mrs May could count on the support this time on a good number of the new Tory women, who think Labour\u2019s next leader is likely to be of the fairer sex and the future at Westminster is female. She is someone the Lib Dems could work with in a future coalition. One commentator hailed her this afternoon as Britain\u2019s answer to Angela Merkel. I wonder, is Mrs May starting to wonder?</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://blogs.independent.co.uk/2012/10/16/a-shocking-case-of-media-bias/\">\u2022 John Rentoul on his blog says Ukip is a victim of media bias.</a></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-507eb533c0e361310bc6d0c3\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-17T13:40:03.654Z\">2.40pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>According to the Tory MP <strong>Michael Fabricant</strong>, Andrew Mitchell said that he did not swear at the police at one point during the exchanges at PMQs.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Mike_Fabricant/status/258546967989329920\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Several MPs have confirmed to me that AM did indeed say <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search/%23pmqs\">#pmqs</a> \"I didn't swear\" (at the police).

Ed Miliband also welcomed the figures, although with some reservations. \u201cI\u2019m sure we all agree there are too many people still looking for work, and the number of people out of work for a long period, over a year, still remains stubbornly high.\u201d he said.</p> <p><strong>\u2022 Miliband has described Andrew Mitchell as \u201ctoast\u201d, claiming that his position is untenable.</strong> The Labour leader said that any young person who abused the police in the way the chief whip did would be arrested.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>While it is a night in the cell for the yobs, it is a night at the Carlton Club for the chief whip. Isn\u2019t that the clearest case there could be of total double standards?\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>Miliband also said that while Mitchell\u2019s colleagues were supporting him in public, they were saying different things in private.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>He is completely undermined. His position is untenable. In other words, he is toast and that is the reality.</p> </blockquote> <p>Cameron said that what Mitchell did and said was wrong, but that he had apologised and that his apology had been accepted. He criticised Miliband for raising the subject. \u201c[Miliband] doesn\u2019t want to talk about what we need to do in this country to get our deficit down, because he has got no policies,\u201d Cameron said.</p> <p><strong>\u2022 Cameron has announced that the government will legislate to force energy companies to offer the lowest tariff to their customers.</strong> \u201cI can announce that we will be legislating so that energy companies have to give the lowest tariff to their customers,\u201d he said at PMQs. This goes further than Labour, which has said that it would force energy customers to offer the lowest tariffs to the over-75s, although Labour has also called for Ofgem to be replaced with a more powerful regulator that would force prices down. As my colleagues Damian Carrington and Juliette Jowit report, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/oct/17/energy-policy-coalition-green-agenda\">later today Cameron and other ministers will be holding a summit on energy policy.</a></p> <p><strong>\u2022 Downing Street has said that Cameron was \u201cappalled\u201d by the racist abuse directed at England players during the Under-21 team\u2019s match against Serbia last night.</strong> A Number 10 spokesman said: \u201cHe was appalled by the scenes that we have seen in Serbia. We are determined to stamp out racism internationally and at home and we are giving our full backing to the FA\u2019s complaint on this issue. Clearly it is for Uefa to investigate this issue but we would expect tough sanctions. If we are going to stamp out racism from football, then it is no good giving derisory fines, as have been handed out in the past. It is not good enough to say that people should shake hands and forget about it.\u201d</p> <p><strong>\u2022 Teaching unions have reacted angrily to <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2012/oct/17/michael-gove-baccalaureate-a-levels\">a report in the Times saying that Michael Gove plans to overhaul A-levels</a>.</strong> Chris Keates, general secretary of the NASUWT, said: \u201cThis is another example of Michael Gove\u2019s ideological manipulation of the school curriculum. These changes are being made on the basis of his own personal prejudices rather than developing a curriculum which is fit for children and young people in the 21st century.\u201d And Nansi Ellis, head of education policy and research, at the Association of Teachers and Lecturers (ATL), said: \u201cIt\u2019s right that the secretary of state is considering the future of assessment for young people. However, he shows contempt for teachers, pupils and parents by once again discussing this with journalists before talking to those who will be affected by it, or those with the expertise to ensure a changed system works. This is piecemeal change, dreamt up by politicians, which means no-one is quite sure what will happen next.</p> <p><strong>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2012/oct/17/gatwick-airport-second-runway\">Gatwick has declared its intent to push for a second runway and is to start drawing up detailed plans for government approval</a>.</strong></p> <p><strong>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2012/oct/17/social-workers-focus-crisis-cuts\">The Family and Parenting Institute has published a study showing that specialist social work aimed at helping at-risk families turn their lives around and avoid having their children taken into care is being undermined by cuts</a>.</strong></p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-10-17T13:42:57.353Z\">at 2.42pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-507ea2c558f91d7bbadac79d\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-17T12:21:25.871Z\">1.21pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>There was a significant announcement at PMQs. I'm afraid I missed it, because it came as I was writing up the end of the Cameron/Miliband exchanges, but others seem to have missed it too. Luckily it did not get through the Press Association net. Here is what it has filed.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>David Cameron announced today that energy firms will be forced to give customers the cheapest available tariff under new legislation. <br>Amid mounting concern about rocketing fuel bills, the prime minister signalled plans to introduce new laws to tackle the often-confusing array of tariffs. <br>\"I can announce that we will be legislating so that energy companies have to give the lowest tariff to their customers,\" he told MPs during Prime Minister's Questions. <br>His intervention follows a string of above-inflation price hikes by major energy companies in recent days.</p> </blockquote> <p>Ed Miliband said that Labour would force energy companies to offer the lowest tariffs to over-75s, but Cameron seems to be going further. </p> <p>I'll post more on this later.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-507e9c7558f91d7bbadac79b\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-17T11:54:29.682Z\">12.54pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>PMQs Verdict:</strong> David Cameron has said that Andrew Mitchell's behaviour was indefensible and - not surprisingly - he found it impossible to defend at PMQs. That's why Ed Miliband had the upper hand. The BBC has just pointed out that he slipped in his final question, saying that people were losing their jobs (when unemployment is going down - although technically there will still be some people losing their jobs), but that does not matter particularly, because his best soundbite (the double standards one, about the Carlton Club and a night in the cells) quite easily trumps Cameron's best soundbite (a lame one about Labour not having anything to say on the economy).</p> <p>That said, the exchanges were not that damaging to Cameron, and there was nothing in what he said, or in the way Tory MPs reacted, to suggest that Mitchell will have to resign. If anything, judging from the immediate reaction, he may well have passed the moment of most danger.</p> <p>(A conspiracy theorist might point out that this is exactly what Milband wants. Strategically, it is far more useful to Labour to have Mitchell in the cabinet, as a long-term reminder of Tory attitudes to public sector workers, than it would be to have Mitchell resign this week. But does that mean Miliband was somehow \"holding back\"? I doubt it. At PMQs it is hard to calibrate your performance with that degree of precision.)</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-507e98c358f91d7bbadac799\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-17T11:38:43.377Z\">12.38pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Cameron says recent figures from the IMF show that there was a 5% structural deficit in 2007.

But frankly, when the welfare bill is spiralling by over \u00a324 billion over this parliament, ministers are wrong to be breaking out the bunting. <br>There are now red flashing lights warning that Britain is becoming a very divided country. <br>Long-term unemployment has risen yet again. The number of young people out of work and claiming benefits for more than a year went up yet again, and three-quarters of Britain has higher unemployment than at the election. More than a third of people out of work have been jobless for more than a year in the clearest sign yet that the Work programme is not doing the job. <br>People in jobs are increasingly having to work part-time or on temporary contracts. There are 1.4 million people who are forced to work part time because they cannot find a full time job. <br>I\u2019m afraid the story is very simple. Those out of jobs are increasingly shut out. Those in jobs are increasingly insecure.</p> </blockquote> <p>From <strong>Brendan Barber</strong>, the TUC general secretary</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>These may be the best figures for some time, but we still need to do much, much better. There are still hundreds of thousands of young people without work, over a million people working part-time who want full time-jobs, and wages are still trailing below inflation.</p> </blockquote> <p>From <strong>David Kern</strong>, chief economist at the British Chambers of Commerce</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The latest job market figures are encouraging and support our assessment that the UK economy has returned to positive growth in the third quarter of 2012.</p> <p>The level of employment is at a record high, and the fall in the level of inactivity is a positive development, signalling that people are returning to the workforce.</p> <p>The strong trend in the labour market raises questions about the accuracy of GDP figures, which are still showing three consecutive declines over the period to the second quarter of 2012.</p> </blockquote> <p>From <strong>Paul Kenny</strong>, the GMB general secretary</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>That there is mass unemployment, in the sixth year of recession, shows that the Tories and Liberals are following the wrong economic policies.</p> </blockquote> <p>From <strong>Dave Prentis</strong>, the Unison general secretary</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Any fall in unemployment has to be welcome, but there is no room for complacency around these figures. There are still 2.53 million people out of work and a near-record 1.4 million people who are being forced into part-time work when they need the income from a full-time job.</p> </blockquote> <p>From <strong>Len McCluskey</strong>, the Unite general secretary</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Hidden behind the statistics is the stubborn underlying problem of the long-term unemployed, whether it is the 16-to-24 year olds or other groups seeking work. It is those areas that ministers need to concentrate on as a matter of urgency.<br>&#xa0;<br>The economy overall is flatlining, household incomes are being squeezed and demand has been sucked out of the economy.<br>&#xa0;<br>The UK is still in recession, so there is nothing for the government to crow about.</p> <p>The Joseph Rowntree Foundation reports that up to 66 people are chasing every retail job and last week when car giant, JLR offered 1,200 jobs, 20,000 people went for them \u2013 this means that there is hardly a jobs\u2019 Eldorado out there.</p> </blockquote> <p>From <strong>Chris Goulden</strong> from the Joseph Rowntree Foundation</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>While any fall in unemployment is welcome, the main problem for&#xa0;young people looking for work is fundamental \u2013 a major shortage of jobs. We need to ratchet up the quality of supply and demand together in order to have any impact on poverty.</p> <p>Today\u2019s unemployment figures show that 957,000 16\u201324 year olds are unemployed (not including those in full-time education). Despite fluctuations, this remains a long-term high, although \u2013 as cannot be repeated enough \u2013 the upward trend started long before the current recession, as far back as 2004.</p> <p>To get a job in these conditions, young people have to apply quickly and consistently to stand any chance. Even if they do hear back, then chances are that the job will be poorly paid and non-standard hours.</p> <p>Our research, <a href=\"http://www.jrf.org.uk/publications/disadvantaged-young-people-work\">published today</a>, shows looking for work for young people is a job in itself. It\u2019s time to increase skills and the number of decent jobs.</p> </blockquote> <p>From <strong>Tony Dolphin</strong>, chief economist at the IPPR</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Today\u2019s figures are good news. They show further welcome falls in unemployment, which is good news especially for young people. There has clearly been an Olympic effect. Almost half of the rise in employment across England has been in London and a quarter of new jobs are temporary.</p> </blockquote> <p>From <strong>Matthew Oakley</strong>, head of economics and social policy at the Policy Exchange thinktank</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>These are an encouraging set of figures that emphasise the flexibility of the UK labour market. But we mustn\u2019t be complacent. Most of these new jobs are part-time or temporary and there is still an underlying problem that many people leaving jobseeker's allowance end up back on the dole within a year. To tackle this we must ensure that people moving off JSA think about increasing their hours, taking on more work and considering future jobs. Currently just one in ten part-time workers is looking for another job.</p> <p>Providing better support to claimants by reforming the way jobcentres are incentivised to get people into full time work is vital. So is the need to increase conditions on people - including those in part time and temporary work \u2013 to do all they possibly can to find full time employment and move off benefits.</p> </blockquote> <p>From <strong>John Walker</strong>, chairman of the Federation of Small Businesses</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It is good news that unemployment continues to fall, but the number of people that have been out of work for more than a year is growing. More than 45,000 new jobs could be created if the government were to extend the National Insurance contributions holiday and this would go a long way to helping those people find work.</p> </blockquote> <p>From <strong>Andrew Sissons</strong>, a researcher at The Work Foundation, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The strong job growth seen over the last year is finally beginning to translate into falling unemployment, especially among young people. While a drop in unemployment of 50,000 is relatively modest, the direction of travel is all important. If the economy keeps creating jobs at its current rate, we should begin to see more substantial falls in unemployment, potentially bringing it back under 2.5 million in the coming months.</p> <p>&#xa0;It is particularly encouraging to see youth unemployment falling, with an extra 50,000 young people moving into work, bringing the total back under one million. This suggests that the strength of the labour market is finally beginning to benefit younger workers. However, unemployment and inactivity among young people remains dangerously high, and more work is needed to sustain this trend.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-10-17T10:24:05.146Z\">at 11.24am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-507e7e7cc0e361310bc6d098\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-17T09:46:36.941Z\">10.46am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>You can read all today's Guardian politics stories <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/all\">here</a>.

So far, much of the party seems unaware of what\u2019s coming. Blairites, who mistakenly took the leader\u2019s conference speech as a shift to the centre, and Old Labourites, who wrongly detected a swerve to the Left, heard only what they wished to hear ...</p> <p>On welfare, the logic of one nationism would seem to favour a contributory system in which those who pay their dues get the most back. The very fairness of such measures would, some argue, engender compassion. As others protest that such a change would imperil the poorest, a row simmers within the party. On crime, the common good is unlikely to be best served by a Tory crackdown that will drain the public purse, hamper rehabilitation and so make citizens less safe. Will Mr Miliband dare say so?</p> <p>On the clearest part of his prospectus \u2013 muscling in on the conservatism abandoned by the Tories \u2013 Mr Miliband will promise, like a one-man Unesco, to preserve Britain\u2019s heritage and institutions. The danger is that pledges to conserve the NHS may backfire once it becomes clear that destruction, including hospital closures, is the only realistic route to salvation.</p> <p>The sole certainty is that Labour has not got the leader it expected. Blairites wanted a continuity regime, the Left expected reassurance, and the unions hoped for a poodle. All those comfort zones will be vaporised in the white heat of Mr Miliband\u2019s one-nation furnace. Quite what will emerge from the fireball is unclear, but there is no doubting the scope of his ambition.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://labourlist.org/2012/10/eds-going-to-tough-with-the-party-how-exactly/\">Mark Ferguson has responded with a post at LabourList, saying that he is sceptical about whether Miliband\u2019s proposals really will upset his party as much as Riddell suggests.</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/opinion/columnists/article3570338.ece\">\u2022 Alastair Campbell in the Times says politicians must understand the power of social media.</a></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The speed of change is breathtaking.

He said that \u201ctransitional protection\u201d, which would be maintained \u201cindefinitely on a cash basis\u201d, would ensure that disabled people did not lose money.

The point about universal credit is that it\u2019s massively helpful to people who have got disabilities in the workplace, because it allows them to take flexible jobs, there\u2019s not the tyranny of the 16-hour rule, they don\u2019t have to worry about fluctuating conditions, they will enjoy much more generous disregards.

  "<p>The <a href=\"http://www.pwc.com/gx/en/sustainability/publications/carbon-disclosure-project/index.jhtml?WT.mc_id=0912-CDP-2012+social\" title=\"rel=\" nofollow\">annual report</a> of the <a href=\"https://www.cdproject.net/en-US/Pages/HomePage.aspx\" title=\"\">Carbon Disclosure Project</a> (CDP), published last month, provides a mix of bad and good news.</p> <p>\"Companies continue to invest in emissions reductions, but these are typically short term, cost cutting measures such as energy or resource efficiency, rather than long term capital investments in low carbon technology,\" the report states.</p> <p>In short, companies are pushing the limits of what they can do despite neither regulatory support nor customer demand. They can achieve efficiencies that reduce costs over the short term, but long term efficiencies are simply not achievable without a broader mandate.</p> <p>This is no longer of merely academic interest. In recent weeks, we have had numerous indications that there are fewer paths that will lead to a livable earth. This summer, <a href=\"http://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/story/2012/08/13/arctic-ice-melting-faster.html?cmp=rss\" title=\"rel=\" nofollow\">Arctic ice disappeared</a> at a rate 50% higher than predicted and may vanish in 10 years. Throughout the northern hemisphere, record droughts, high temperatures and floods have been documented. The United Nations Environmental Program (UNEP) <a href=\"http://www.unep.org/geo/\" title=\"\">reported</a> last summer that progress had been made on only four of 90 of the most important environmental goals.</p> <p>Because deeper carbon reduction strategies carry higher capital costs and risks, companies on their own cannot take the actions necessary to meet the carbon challenge. As the CDP states, \"82% of [Global 500] companies have set targets to reduce emissions, [but] these are not nearly ambitious enough to achieve governments' goals to limit warming to 2\u00b0C\".</p> <p>A remarkable lack of political leadership regarding sustainability issues forces well-intentioned companies into tight corners. Such firms are able to read the news and see the possibilities ahead, but find it difficult to realise the opportunities in sustainability without supportive market structures and regulations. Further, <a href=\"http://www.france24.com/en/20121004-climate-scepticism-highest-us-britain\" title=\"rel=\" nofollow\">in the UK and US</a>, customers are much less likely to believe in a causal connection between human action and climate impacts.</p> <p>Indeed, America's inattention to climate change has been described <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/oct/02/us-presidential-debates-global-warming?newsfeed=true\" title=\"rel=\" nofollow\">in the Guardian</a> as the \"2012 election's only bipartisan consensus\".</p> <p>America, though dominant, is not alone. Ed Miliband, the British Labour party leader somehow omitted it from his recent speech to the party convention, offering no signals to business regarding how he might differ from David Cameron on the issue. Canada's prime minister, Stephen Harper, has placed his economic bets on the oil sands and their requisite pipelines rather than on increased research, education and productivity.</p> <p>In a <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sustainable-business/changing-behaviour-scale-that-matters?newsfeed=true\" title=\"rel=\" nofollow\">recent blog</a>, Oliver Balch pondered over what business could do to get customers to respond to issues that companies find so important. Two prominent business scholars present very different answers to his question. One says people may seem complacent and unresponsive to sustainability initiatives because they don't understand the science. The other shows evidence that people may not trust the science.</p> <p>First, Jon Sterman of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology has worked for years to help business students and executives to understand the system dynamics of climate change. He believes that people can learn to understand the mechanisms of carbon accumulation in the atmosphere. Knowing more about carbon levels will help to drive the behaviour of policy makers, whether in business or government. To this end, he has developed numerous <a href=\"http://climateinteractive.org/\" title=\"rel=\" nofollow\">simulations</a> that allow users to control few variables and see their impact on sea levels and temperatures. In his view, when leaders understand causal connections, they can drive behaviour through improved regulation and business policy.</p> <p>Andrew Hoffman of the University of Michigan, however, thinks that the problem is lack of a social consensus and has identified <a href=\"http://www.ssireview.org/articles/entry/climate_science_as_culture_war\" title=\"rel=\" nofollow\">means</a> by which he thinks one can be developed. In his view, honest brokers can help to interpret science better than climate scientists themselves. Once people understand the statistics of causality better, a consensus can be developed that can drive substantive change. He points to the long battle to change smoking behaviour in response to scientific evidence about the connections between tobacco use and lung cancer. In short, trusted sources can broker or market better ideas until people start choosing better alternatives.</p> <p>Both of these opinions are correct. We need to understand the science and we need to trust it. When you look at the list of the four goals on which UNEP found we have made progress, it is clearer:</p> <p>\u2022 Reducing substances that deplete the ozone layer</p> <p>\u2022 Removing lead from fuel</p> <p>\u2022 Increasing access to improved water supplies</p> <p>\u2022 Boosting research on ways to reduce pollution of the marine environment</p> <p>We understand water pollution, ozone holes and lead poisoning. We believe they exist. We can and do act.</p> <p>Consumers won't buy cold water clothes washing detergent until they understand and believe in the impact of their decisions on the earth. Governments will not invest in high speed rail if they do not see a compelling need to replace congested motorways with carbon-free alternatives. Financial decisions at all levels are being deferred because we don't understand our impact on the climate.</p> <p>Companies who seek to make larger capital investments and gain higher efficiencies may first need to invest in increasing the scientific understanding of investors, employees, customers and regulators.</p> <p>The key is to go micro at the 86 individual targets and figure out narrow, targeted plans for as many as possible that marshal the evidence on cause and effect, tally the costs and suggest a way forward. We will be considering many of these <a href=\"http://www.unep.org/geo/pdfs/geo5/Progress_towards_goals.pdf\" title=\"rel=\" nofollow\"\">goals</a> in coming weeks, exploring ways in which companies around the world can be encouraged to progress towards their resolution.</p> <p><em>Alison Kemper teaches management at York University and has worked with the Michael Lee-Chin Institute for Corporate Citizenship at the Rotman School since 2005.

  "<p>Last week, the British government <a href=\"http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/narendra-modi-uk-gujarat-british-high-commissioner-in-india/1/224383.html\" title=\"\">asked its high commissioner in India to meet Narendra Modi</a>, ending 10 years of international isolation for Gujarat's chief minister. Modi was delighted, of course, immediately tweeting \"God is great\".</p> <p>His industries minister instantly promised to \"fast-track\" British investment projects. But many Indian political parties, including the ruling Congress, parties of the left, and Muslim organisations, have sharply criticised the decision. Ever since the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/mar/14/new-india-gujarat-massacre\" title=\"\">massacre of more than 1,000 people, mostly Muslims, in 2002</a>, Modi has been accused by jurists, secular political leaders and civil society in India, as well as by the governments of many countries, of taking no action to prevent the violence, delaying the deployment of police to protect victims and failing to investigate and punish those responsible for the killings. Despite his repeated denials of each of these accusations, Modi is a potent symbol of militant defiance of secularism and constitutional-democratic principles, and remains greatly feared by Muslims.</p> <p>The decision by the UK to resume contact with him is seen as a cruel blow to the causes of justice for the massacre's victims (which included three British citizens), and of non-discrimination against India's 180&#xa0;million non-Hindus.</p> <p>Up till now, British officials have followed a \"working policy\" of no contact with Modi's government <a href=\"http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2005-03-22/india/27849965_1_gujarat-riots-riot-act-uk\" title=\"\">\"because of our concerns over what happened in Gujarat\"</a>. Modi was also refused a visa by the US and EU. Modi's global isolation has helped to sustain domestic civil society pressure to bring the massacre's perpetrators to justice. This in turn encouraged the Indian supreme court to intervene, by asking the Gujarat government to reopen criminal cases closed for \"lack of evidence\", and transferring some trials to Maharashtra.</p> <p>The new British stand has been rationalised on the ground that it would allow the UK \"to discuss a wide range of issues of mutual interest and to explore opportunities for closer co-operation, in line with the \u2026 objective of improving bilateral relations \u2026\". In reality, it will deepen India's social and political rifts, and strengthen Modi's Hindu-chauvinist <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/indiahome/indianews/article-2218139/BJP-deny-Narendra-Modi-place.html?ito=feeds-newsxml\" title=\"\">Bharatiya Janata party, for whose leadership</a> he is making an aggressive bid.</p> <p>Going by background briefings by British officials to the Indian press, the UK is attracted to \"dynamic and thriving\" opportunities in Gujarat, especially in \"business\", \"science\" and \"education\". Gujarat has emerged as a major investment destination thanks largely to the sweetheart deals Modi offers to businesses. Despite booming investments, Gujarat's social indices and poverty ratios remain appalling.</p> <p>Evidently, the Cameron government doesn't want to lose out on Gujarat's business opportunities or support from Britain's prosperous Gujarati businessmen, described by the Foreign Office as \"one of the most successful and dynamic communities in the UK\" \u2013 even if that means sanctifying large-scale violence. The Foreign Office lamely added that it wants \"to secure justice for the families of the British nationals who were killed \u2026 [and] support human rights and good governance \u2026\" That cannot be done by relaxing moral-political pressure on Modi.</p> <p>The 2002 massacre was conducted by Hindu fanatics, who speared and burnt Muslims to death, besides raping hundreds of women. Some particularly ghastly incidents were <a href=\"http://www.hrw.org/reports/2002/india/\" title=\"\">documented by Human Rights Watch</a> and <a href=\"http://www.tehelka.com/story_main35.asp?filename=Ne031107gujrat_sec.asp\" title=\"\">an Indian magazine</a> . A witness told Human Rights Watch that the belly of a pregnant woman was slit open by a mob with swords, and both she and her foetus were torched. At Naroda-Patiya, 97 people were massacred, including 35 children and 32 women, by a mob directed by former minister and Modi confidante <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-19432982\" title=\"\">Maya Kodnani</a>, who has just been sentenced to 28 years in jail. Police claim they recorded these cases but could not pursue them because of lack of evidence. This is contested by eye-witnesses.</p> <p>The collective barbaric vengeance against a religious minority couldn't have occurred, <a href=\"http://nhrc.nic.in/disparchive.asp?fno=247\" title=\"\">says India's National Human Rights Commission</a> , without \"a comprehensive failure on the part of the state government to control the persistent violation of the rights to life, liberty, equality and dignity of the people\". Although many more <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/8306420.stm\" title=\"\">Sikhs were killed in Delhi after Indira Gandhi's assassination</a>, the state's involvement was far deeper in Gujarat, making it the worst massacre of its kind.</p> <p>The massacre followed riots, which were themselves a reaction to a fire in a train, <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/4180885.stm\" title=\"\">declared accidental by a railway inquiry</a>, in which 59 Hindus died. According to well-corroborated accounts, including some 40 independent reports, including one by the <a href=\"http://www.sabrang.com/tribunal\" title=\"\">Concerned Citizens Tribunal</a>, composed of former senior judges, Modi had the bodies of the train-fire victims brought over a long distance to Ahmedabad, and displayed in a procession. Unsurprisingly, this provoked violence in Gujarat's charged climate. Modi has denied this, saying that the bodies were taken to a hospital to avoid any tensions, and that the violence was simply a natural \"reaction\" to the train fire.</p> <p>According to independent accounts, denied officially, police stood by as the killing proceeded, and refused to register the crimes properly. The BJP, in power nationally, did not use the constitutional powers they have which could have helped restore confidence. (In India, if there is a breakdown of order in any state, the central government can sack the provincial government and impose its own rule until the situation improves and fresh elections can be held. In March 2002, a majority of Indian parties demanded that Modi be sacked and central rule imposed in Gujarat, but the BJP-led government refused.) Gujarat's climate has remained vitiated ever since, allowing Modi to win two state elections.</p> <p>Modi claims he's innocent and has never expressed remorse for the violence. <a href=\"http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/gujarat-narendra-modi-reaches-out-to-muslims-nai-duniya/1/210468.html\" title=\"\">His recent overtures to Muslims</a> are viewed with suspicion.</p> <p>Despite official efforts to shield the culprits, and corrupt or destroy evidence, more than 110 people have been found guilty and sentenced by the courts \u2013 a small fraction of the culprits' number. Some evidence, as in Kodnani's case, was provided by conscientious policemen, including a detailed mobile-phone log that establishes frequent conversations between ministers, Hindu fanatics and police at specific sites.</p> <p>Gujarat's victims have still not received justice. Thousands haven't been rehabilitated. Large numbers have been driven into ghettoes, and effectively disenfranchised within a communally polarised climate. Without justice, there can be no reconciliation or forgiveness.</p> <p>Violence of this scale should be an international concern. It shouldn't be treated lightly simply because India has the trappings of a democracy with free elections. What makes the British decision politically odious is its timing: the Gujarat state election is just two months away.</p>",
  "<h2>Hoover's Cooking</h2> <p>Chicken-fried steak is pretty much the national dish of Texas, and Hoover Alexander makes one of the city's best, with beef the size of a high-five pounded flat, dredged in flour and fried a knobby golden brown before it's smothered in black pepper cream gravy. For $9.79, it comes with three sides, among them Southern staples such as syrupy candied yams, a witches' brew of okra and tomatoes and stemmy mustard greens with the aggressive twang of vinegar and cross-sectioned tabs of smoked ham. Hoover also draws fried catfish, barbecued ribs, meatloaf and fried pork chops from the Southern pantry, along with gumbo in a swampy roux with chicken and coarse, spicy sausage. <br><em>\u2022 2002 Manor Road, +1 512 479 5006, </em><a href=\"http://www.hooverscooking.com\" title=\"\"><em>hooverscooking.com</em></a><em>, plates $10-$14.Open Mon-Fri 11am-10pm, Sat-Sun 8am-10pm</em></p> <h2>Black Star Co-op</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397917654\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/site_furniture/2012/10/8/1349701392347/Black-Star-Co-op-Austin-T-009.jpg\" alt=\"Black Star Co-op, Austin, Texas\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Photograph: SilverHalideSalts/flickr</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: SilverHalideSalts/flickr</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Austin's youth culture draws craft brewers the same way it lures indie rock bands, attracting a dozen breweries in the past five years.

Dirty's has been serving handmade burgers since 1926, and the people serving them have all been there for just about that long. Up until a dozen or so years ago, they had carhops. Not the ones you would imagine \u2013 young women on roller skates \u2013 but really cool older guys, who always seemed to know exactly what you wanted with that perfectly greasy burger. The carhops are gone, but the burgers are still hand-patted and perfectly greasy. I usually eschew the Sissy Burger in favour of the Big Sissy Burger.

It, too, is right in the middle of SoCo, which is about the hottest area in South Austin these days. When I check in, they always ask if I have a room preference. I always say, \"surprise me\" \u2013 and they do. Every room is different, and they are constantly redecorating. On at least one occasion, I was pretty sure they redecorated my room while I was out. Of course, that could have been the Guinness talking.<br><em>\u2022 1220 S Congress Ave, +1 512 441 1157, </em><a href=\"http://www.austinmotel.com/\" title=\"\"><em>austinmotel.com</em></a><em>.

He lives on a bus, with a mailing address apparently known only to the border patrol and <em>federales</em>. So my money is on a band called <strong>Greezy Wheels</strong>. They are either an Austin institution or they should be institutionalised, because decades after their turn as darlings of the Austin music scene, they're still turnin' it loose with the best of them. The fiddler, Sweet Mary, was in my band in New York City, and she is still a regular Shostakovich with a bow.

For my pesos, the best of the best is <strong>The Frisco Shop</strong>, the last bastion of Harry Akin's Night Hawk restaurant chain. It was my late Dad's favourite, too.

  "<p>There is nothing like studying overseas to broaden your horizons, not to mention your CV. Employers are increasingly looking on foreign language skills and familiarity with different cultures as a differentiator when it comes to potential employees.</p> <p>According to the UK Council for Student Affairs there are around 22,000 UK students dotted around the globe doing just this. Not to mention some 400,000 international students studying here in the UK.</p> <p>With the right support in place, studying abroad will allow you to stand out from the crowd when it comes to entering the job market. Here are just a few reasons why students should consider studying overseas:</p> <p><strong>\u2022 To enhance your CV.</strong> When applying for graduate jobs the common denominator is that everyone will have a degree, but the life skills picked up while studying abroad will put you ahead of the competition. The experience will ensure that you are adaptable to new surroundings and cultures, which is not easily learnt in the classroom. This sort of flexibility is vital to many employers.</p> <p><strong>\u2022 Improve your language skills.</strong> In today's world of global commerce, knowing how to express yourself in more than one language is becoming an ever increasing necessity. Having to converse in a foreign tongue may at first seem unnerving, but nothing beats learning a new language in the country of its origin.</p> <p><strong>\u2022 Gain new contacts and lasting connections.</strong> Who's to say networking should begin when you start working? Studying overseas will introduce you to a host of new experiences and faces. For those looking to work internationally this could be a vital and strategic start to your future career.</p> <p><strong>\u2022 Hone your digital skills.</strong> Blogging and tweeting about your travels may seem like a fun and easy way to keep in touch with those at home, but it could also set you on your chosen career path. 02 recently published research showing that the unused d<a href=\"http://news.o2.co.uk/?press-release=young-peoples-digital-skills-valued-at-6-7billion-by-uk-businesses\" title=\"\">igital skills of the one million young people in the UK is estimated to be worth \u00a36.7 billion</a>. Companies value web and social media know-how on a par with new business development and customer acquisition abilities \u2013 suddenly that blog doesn't seem so trivial.</p> <p><strong>\u2022 Test your strength of character.</strong> For many students studying abroad may be the first time they have been so far from home. Arriving in a foreign land alone is an intimidating prospect, but without even realising it those who take on the challenge will see their confidence and self-reliance grow.</p> <p><strong>\u2022 Change your outlook on life.</strong> The modern workplace is a diverse and ever changing realm. Immersing yourself in a new culture and way of life will allow you to adapt to new situations with pace and undoubtedly make you mentally stronger and wiser.</p> <p>When speaking to students who are considering studying abroad cost is always one of their biggest worries. But this need not be a hurdle. Tuition fees in the UK may be on the rise, but some countries, such as Demark, do not charge international students to study. Meanwhile others, such as the Netherlands and the Republic of Ireland, come at a fraction of the cost of British study.</p> <p>Then there is the option of part-time work should your visa stipulations allow it; many universities will help organise casual employment for international students. Another option is to apply for scholarships and bursaries. Student information websites <a href=\"http://www.ukcisa.org.uk/ukstudent/funding.php\" title=\"\">UKCISA</a> and <a href=\"http://www.unesco.org/education/studyingabroad/networking/studyabroad.shtml\" title=\"\">UNESCO</a> are a good place to start when researching funding opportunities.</p> <p><em>Elspeth Brown is the director of </em><a href=\"http://www.onlystudentconcierge.co.uk/\" title=\"\"><em>Only Student Concierge</em></a></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by </strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/guardian-professional\" title=\"\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

  "<p>If imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, Apple should be crimson. As Mitt Romney observed in the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/17/obama-win-second-presidential-debate\" title=\"\">second presidential debate</a>, there are \"even counterfeit Apple stores in China\".</p> <p>In the best-known case, in Kunming last year, the boss had gone to some lengths to kit out the store and staff in line with Apple design. Blue T-shirted employees <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/pda/2011/jul/21/fake-apple-store\" title=\"\">believed they were working at a genuine branch</a>.</p> <p>The resulting headlines prompted a crackdown and the <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-14503724\" title=\"\">closure of at least a couple of stores for trading without a licence</a> \u2013 but there are plenty more. Not all are masquerading as official Apple outlets, and those that do are not always convincing. It's hard to imagine the company endorsing the cheery slogan at this recently spotted retailer: \"<a href=\"http://twitpic.com/b39r2q\" title=\"\">iPhone 5: because you have more money than sense</a>\".</p> <p>And while Romney claimed the stores were selling counterfeit goods, most are actually selling genuine Apple products \u2013 often grey-market imports from Hong Kong \u2013 Charlie Custer, an editor at <a href=\"http://www.techinasia.com/\" title=\"The technology news site\">Tech In Asia</a>, pointed out.</p> <p>\"Apple is getting the money one way or another,\" he said. People are often too impatient to wait until Apple has approval from Chinese authorities for products to be used on Chinese networks, as well as wanting the lower prices. And Apple has been relatively slow to roll out genuine stores on the mainland.</p> <p>At the same time, the enforcement of rights tends to be spasmodic. \"The intellectual property [situation] is improving, but not as fast as many people would like,\" said Duncan Clark of the BDA China business consultancy, and formerly chairman of the British Chamber of Commerce in China. \"There are periodic crackdowns, but there's still a long way to go.\"</p> <p>Clark suggested that changing demand might be having more of an impact than curbs on the supply of fakes. \"When it comes to very desirable products, Chinese consumers absolutely know the difference and will pay above the odds to get the real thing,\" he said.</p> <p>The surge in fake Apple stores in large part reflects demand for the genuine products. Custer described the iPhone as \"a perfect status symbol that's still in the price range of a lot of people\"; unlike, say, a Mercedes. White-collar buyers want the real deal.</p> <p>But for the others, there are plenty of products \u2013 and not just phones and gadgets \u2013 that appear to be inspired by Apple. At the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/08/chinese-sex-fair-prudishness-liberation earlier\" title=\"Chinese sex fair shows how prudishness and liberation sit side-by-side\">Guangzhou Sex Culture Festival</a> this month, there were \"iPed\" sex toys and, this spring, <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/taniabranigan/7351932618/in/photostream\" title=\"Yes, mango-flavoured iPhone 5 icecreams\">\"iPhone 5\" ice creams</a> \u2013 complete with a trademark symbol \u2013 appeared in convenience stores.</p> <p>Even so, the blogger who first found the Kunming store pointed out that Applemania was not a uniquely Chinese phenomenon. Internet users mailed her images of fake stores from around the world, including one in New York.</p> <p>\"It is more of a global issue, but it doesn't create as nice a story as China ripping off Apple stores,\" she told <a href=\"http://blogs.wsj.com/chinarealtime/2012/10/17/china-fake-apple-store-blogger-romney-misusing-the-story/\" title=\"Mitt Romney called out on fake Apple store\">the Wall Street Journal</a>.</p> <p>\"[Mitt Romney] uses it as a shorthand to generate outrage about trade practices in China and as a shorthand that he will be quote-unquote 'tough on China'. It's a somewhat meaningless shorthand. I'm not entirely sure he knows what he's referring to at this point.\"</p>",

His goalkeeping career was ended by TB while he was playing for the youth team of Racing Universitaire Algerios at the age of 18. It's a bit of a stretch, then, to put The Stranger or The Plague in the same category as Totti's travel guide. The same applies to Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, creator of Sherlock Holmes and goalkeeper for amateur side Portsmouth Association Football Club in the 1890s.</p> <p>David Icke, on the other hand, made 37 professional appearances for Hereford United before penning such must-read volumes as Tales from the Time Loop and The David Icke Guide to the Global Conspiracy.</p> <p>The former Colombus Crew and Houston Dynamo forward Jason Garey also turned his hand to fiction. Garey began writing in autumn last year after suffering a hip injury. \"I was on crutches for three or four weeks and just started writing, putting down my thoughts and beliefs, and it began to take form,\" <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/soccer-insider/post/jason-garey-striker-and-author-soccer-player-writes-novel-based-on-libertarian-beliefs/2012/07/03/gJQATUKILW_blog.html\" title=\"\">he told the Washington Post</a>. \"I just thought, 'What the heck?

From the backwoods bayous and French Quarter streets of South Louisiana, Wyatt Bourgeouis battles Harry Maddow, the latest member of a long line of corrupt Louisiana politicians, who seek power and control over the individual.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>It could be argued that Steve Bruce's three novels are, like Jaws, about more than meets the eye. Jaws in book form, so the theory goes, is about infidelity rather than a gigantic shark that swims about the place eating people. Similarly it can be argued that Defender!, Striker! and Sweeper!, written when Bruce was manager of Huddersfield Town, are about murder, the bloodlust of the human condition and the scattered thoughts of a man staring into the abyss rather than football. Unfortunately, in the same way that Jaws really is about a gigantic shark that swims about the place eating people, so Bruce's three books really are about football, and particularly about \"Leddersford Town\" manager \"Steve Barnes\". They're not particularly successful \u2013 Bruce himself described them as \"the biggest load of crap ever written\".</p> <p>Along with Bruce in the bin marked Novels Too Much About Football To Count Here go Terry Venables' <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/They-Used-Grass-Gordon-Williams/dp/0140244220\" title=\"\">They Used To Play on Grass</a>, Jimmy Greaves' The Ball Game (a fictional account following the adventures of cockney striker \"Jackie Groves\" worth checking out for the <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Ball-Game-Jimmy-Greaves/dp/0213167441/ref=sr_1_16?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1350306445&amp;sr=1-16\" title=\"\">rather startling cover</a>), and Theo Walcott's in-no-way-autobiographical <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/T-J-Hat-trick-Theo-Walcott/dp/0552562459/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1350306551&amp;sr=1-1\" title=\"\">TJ and the Hat-trick</a>.</p> <h2>WHICH FOOTBALLERS ARE KEEN CYCLISTS? (2)</h2> <p><strong>Last week we looked at the players and managers just as happy with their feet on the pedals as they are, or were, with their foot on the ball. This week reader Stig Nygard has pointed us towards two players who went further than just the odd commute. </strong></p> <p>The former Middlesbrough, Juventus, Marseille and Italy striker Fabrizio Ravanelli had been a fan of cycling as a child, but his interest really took off following Marco Pantani's victory double in the Giro d'Italia and Tour de France in 1998. Ravenelli had met Il Pirate while playing for Juventus \u2013 \"He was prematurely bald, I was prematurely grey, so we got on famously\" \u2013 and his wins in the grand tours were an inspiration.</p> <p>But it was not until his retirement in 2005 that he was able to devote time to his new passion. And in 2008 he and his brother Andrea set up their own racing team, <a href=\"http://www.garminrevolution.it/partners/fabrizio-ravanelli-umbria-cycling-team\" title=\"\">Umbria Cycling Team</a>. \"As you'd expect, I get recognised a fair bit by the other riders,\" <a href=\"http://fourfourtwo.com/interviews/mysecretvice/225/article.aspx\" title=\"\">he told FourFourTwo in 2008</a>. \"Everyone's really friendly, though. I'll be chugging along and all of a sudden I'll hear 'Ravanelli, was football not hard enough for you? Why are you putting yourself through all this pain?' They're right, too: I suffer a lot more on a bike than I ever did on the football pitch.\"</p> <p>He claimed at least one amateur victory and has taken on some of the biggest climbs in Europe. \"Last year I went with Caruso to the Swiss border to climb two of the most famous and hardest mountain passes in Italy \u2013 the Passo dello Stelvio and the Mortirolo,\" he said. \"The Stelvio is nearly 3,000m above sea level, and, at the top, we were riding between two vast walls of snow. The jubilation I felt at getting to the summit wasn't dissimilar to winning the Champions League. It's the same rush.\"</p> <p>But one player who would leave Ravanelli trailing in his wake in the mountains, if not on the pitch, is Norway's Knut Anders Fostervold. Fostervold enjoyed an eight-year career with Molde between 1994 and 2002, during which time the club were regular qualifiers for European football. Although his most famous moment will probably remain <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEt8apZZuj0\" title=\"\">this dive against Stabaek</a> (later mimicked by John Carew), in 1999-2000 he captained Molde during their most successful ever run in Europe when they reached the Champions League group stage. The club may have exited the competition after winning only one game and finishing bottom of the group, but Fostervold wore the armband at the Bernab\u00e9u against the eventual champions Real Madrid and that's a claim to fame not many can match.</p> <p>A brief loan spell at Grimsby Town followed in 2000-01 (it's not very fondly remembered at Blundell Park \u2013 \"Capable of playing centre-back, left-back or left wing-back apparently \u2026 sluggish with or without the ball and clumsy in possession\" is the recollection of <a href=\"http://thefishy.co.uk/story.php?id=8315781\" title=\"\">Grimsby fansite, The Fishy</a>) and his career came to an end due to a knee injury in 2002 at the age of 35.</p> <p>For a couple of years Fostervold cycled purely for fun, but in 2004 he began taking the sport seriously. In 2005 he came third in the Norwegian time-trial championship behind current Team Sky coach Kurt Asle Arvesen and future world champion Thor Hushovd. In 2006 he came third again, with Arvesen winning, and in 2007 he beat Arvesen for the first time only to finish second behind Edvald Boasson Hagen, who would go on to win five in a row. Despite the lack of wins in time trials he did at different times hold the Norwegian 10km, 20km and 30km time trial records.</p> <p>He even got the chance to fight for the world title. With Hushovd and Arvesen choosing not to compete in the time trial at the 2006 or 2007 world championships, Fostervold competed as Norway's representative. In 2006 he came 43rd out of 52 and in 2007 51st out of 69, each time finishing around five minutes behind the winner Fabien Cancellara.</p> <p>His VO2 max was, at his peak, registered at 94, the second-highest ever recorded by a Norwegian. But it was his bike-handing ability that held him back from the very top. \"I need to learn how to cycle, I'm a junior,\" he said after the 2006 world championships. He never quite got there, however, and ended his second sporting career in 2009 \u2026 only to begin a <a href=\"http://www.3atlet.no/kan-fostervold-vinne-norseman.4869943-170050.html\" title=\"\">third sporting career in triathlon</a>, finishing <a href=\"https://www.box.com/shared/xqhodrlfys4vczgc9f0b\" title=\"\">sixth in the 2011 Norseman Extreme Triathlon</a>.</p> <h2>CHAMPIONS LEAGUE TEAMS RELEGATED</h2> <p><strong>\"Last season Villarreal competed in the Champions League and got relegated,\" </strong>writes Chris Meli. <strong>\"Has this ever happened before?\"</strong></p> <p>Plenty of times, Chris. A particularly interesting case was the collapse of Romanian minnows Unirea Urziceni, as pointed out by Jake Miller. Unirea finished second in the Romanian League in 2009-10 and enjoyed a solid Champions League campaign in 2010-11 (beating Rangers 4-1 at Ibrox in the group stage) and another second-placed league finish. Defeat in their qualifier against Zenit St Petersburg was the final straw for the chairman Dumitru Bucsaru. Bucsaru, one of Romania's richest men, had bankrolled the club's rise and now he wanted his money back.</p> <p>The Observer picks up the story in 2011: \"Bucsaru launched his exit strategy: selling off the best of the squad and, after defeat to Liverpool in the Europa League, watching the remnants slide to relegation. Last week, authorities confirmed Bucsaru had walked away, leaving behind a shell of a club with a tax debt of \u20ac1.5m. Fixtures and fittings are being sold off to help cover that \u2013 including the turnstiles, listed at \u20ac85k.\"</p> <p>(You can read more about the rise and fall of Unirea Urziceni <a href=\"http://playingthepercentages.blogspot.co.uk/2011/07/rise-and-fall-of-unirea-urziceni.html\" title=\"\">here</a>, <a href=\"http://scoutingromania.com/2011/10/27/unirea-urziceni-success-can-kill-you/\" title=\"\">here</a>, <a href=\"http://scoutingromania.com/2011/07/09/remember-unirea-urziceni-well-you-might-as-well-just-forget-about-it/\" title=\"\">here</a> and <a href=\"http://theovallog.wordpress.com/2011/07/13/tyrannical-bucsaru-murders-unirea-urziceni/\" title=\"\">here</a>.)</p> <p>The 2009-10 season was also a fine one for Sampdoria. Under the tutelage of Gigi Del Neri, Giampaolo Pazzini and Antonio Cassano fired the <em>Blucerchiati </em>to fourth spot in Serie A and a place in the Champions League. The Piazza De Ferrari in Genoa saw a party the like of which it had never seen before. The 2010-11 season was not so vintage. Twenty-four hours after securing fourth place, Del Neri left the club for Juventus. Werder Bremen knocked them out of the Champions League in the play-off round with a 5-4 aggregate victory. Pazzini and Cassano followed Del Neri out of the door in the winter transfer window. And a season that began in the Champions League ended in relegation.</p> <p>Chievo suffered a similar fate in 2006-07. The previous season the Flying Donkeys were one of the beneficiaries of Juventus's off-field problems and saw their fifth-place Serie A finish turned into fourth and a Champions League spot. But their European adventure ended at the hands of Levski Sofia in the qualifying round. And on the final day of the season the Flying Donkeys lost at Catania, a result which kept the home side up at Chievo's expense. \"Kiss those asses goodbye,\" <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2007/may/28/europeanfootball.sport?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">wrote our very own James Richardson</a>.</p> <p>Several sides have fallen foul of off-field issues. Most recently Rangers competed in the Champions League in 2011-12, only to find themselves dumped down to the Third Division in 2012-13. Similarly, off-field problems saw Juventus, Champions League quarter-finalists in 2005-06, relegated to the second tier for the 2006-07 season. A similar fate befell Milan after the Totonero scandal in 1979-80. And Austrian champions Tirol Innsbruck were beaten in the qualifying round by Lokomotiv Moscow in 2001-02 and despite ending the season atop the Austrian Bundesliga once more, they were relegated two divisions to the regional leagues due to their financial difficulties and began the 2002-03 campaign as WSG Wattens/FC Wacker Tirol.</p> <p>The Danish side Hvidovre began 1974-75 facing (and losing to) Poland's Ruch Chorzow in the European Cup first round and ended it bottom and relegated. It happened again in Denmark in 2000-01, when Herfolge were battered 6-0 by Rangers in the third qualifying round of the Champions League and relegated come the season's end. And N\u00fcrnberg won the German title in 1967-68, were beaten by Ajax in the first round of the European Cup in 1968-69 and ended that season an unfortunate second-bottom of the Bundesliga, <a href=\"http://www.rsssf.com/tablesd/duit69.html\" title=\"\">in one of the closest divisions of all time</a>.</p> <h2>KNOWLEDGE ARCHIVE</h2> <p><strong>\"Here in the Basque country,\" </strong>wrote Tim Tregrenza back in those halcyon days of 2006, <strong>\"there are football teams that select only Basque players. Athletic Bilbao is the most famous, but there is also Eibar (in the second division) and other lower league teams. Are there any other clubs around the world who have a similar policy?\"</strong></p> <p>Indeed there are, Tim, with the most famous being Club Deportivo de Guadalajara (also known as Chivas \u2013 Spanish for \"goats\") in Mexico. The most widely supported team in the country, Chivas have fielded only Mexican-born players for a century. Their wealthy owner, the businessman and film producer Jorge Vergara, also owns two other clubs: Costa Rica's Deportivo de Saprissa (recently beaten by Liverpool at the World Club Championship) and US Major League team Club Deportivo Chivas USA. Saprissa only use Costa Rican players, but Chivas USA's original plan to recruit only Mexican players was denied by the MLS's restrictions on foreign players. However, when the expansion side first kicked off in 2005, all but four of the 28 players in their squad were Hispanic; even their Dutch coach Thomas Rongen enrolled in a Spanish language course.</p> <p>Ecuadorian side Club Deportivo El Nacional, from the city of Quito, are another team with a restricted selection policy. According to Wikipedia, \"Nacional is called so because it belongs to the Ecuadorian military and because only players with Ecuadorian nationality are allowed to play on the team. This is why the team is nicknamed Puros Criollos (\"All-Creoles\") or El Equipo Militar (\"The Military Team\").\"</p> <p>The same source also explains the selection policy of Singaporean S-League team Young Lions. \"While the bulk of the squad is made up of members of Singapore's Under-23 team, the club also take in promising young foreign players.

  "<p>The countries that run the International Monetary Fund (IMF) have decided to spend a $2.7bn (\u00a31.7bn) windfall on subsidising cheaper loans to low-income countries. This will represent a small financial benefit for countries taking such loans, but leaves unchallenged what such loans and debt exist to do.</p> <p>In the mid-2000s, the IMF faced a financial crisis as middle-income countries such as Argentina and Brazil paid off their debts to the institution. The fund's $1bn costs are paid for by the interest it charges on loans, and its income dried up as countries got off lending programmes, scarred by two decades of austerity and liberalisation.</p> <p>The IMF decided to sell off some gold, invest the money earned, and use the proceeds to run the institution. Then the financial crisis hit; a crisis the IMF had not only systematically failed to warn of but <a href=\"http://www.brettonwoodsproject.org/art-567577\" title=\"\">had helped to precipitate</a> through its praise of light-touch regulation. Lending by the IMF has ballooned along with its income: this year a profit of $2.2bn has been made on loans to countries including Pakistan, Jamaica, Ireland and Greece. And with gold prices rising, far more money than predicted came in from the sell-off, leaving a $2.7bn windfall.</p> <p>The IMF charges little or no interest on its loans to low-income countries; those with an income per person of less than \u00a3650 a year. Historically, it has been subsidised to do so by \"aid\" donations from wealthier countries. The IMF board's decision to use the gold windfall to pay for these low interest rates for the foreseeable future means low-income countries will continue to pay 1% less in interest than they otherwise would, a saving of \u00a340m a year across them all. It also leaves IMF loans funded and in place for years to come.</p> <p>The IMF was created at the end of the second world war to provide temporary loans to countries that were facing a \"liquidity crisis\" \u2013 a short-term inability to pay debts and buy imports.This month, Germany's Bundesbank complained that the <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/financialcrisis/9563849/Bundesbank-castigates-IMF-for-saving-Europe.html\" title=\"\">IMF in Europe</a> is straying from this liquidity role to one of ongoing lending. But this has been happening for three decades.</p> <p>In 1982, Mexico defaulted on its huge debts from reckless lending by banks awash with money in the 1970s because of high oil prices. Faced with the prospect of US, Japanese and British banks going bust, the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2012/aug/19/eurozone-latin-america-debt-crisis-1980\" title=\"\">IMF stepped in with bailout loans</a>, enabling the continued payment of the debts in return for austerity and liberalisation. The pattern was repeated across Latin America and Africa for two decades, a time when economies stagnated and poverty rapidly increased. In Africa, the number of those living in extreme poverty rose from 205 million in 1981 to 330 million in 1993.</p> <p>While IMF lending maintained a debt crisis, the reckless lenders benefited from getting money back. The same pattern is being repeated in Europe today as German, French and British banks are repaid reckless loans, while Greece, Ireland and Portugal are stuck in economic collapse, depression and rising poverty.</p> <p>Bailing out reckless lenders contributes to the pattern of debt crises we have seen for the past 30 years; bank risk is reduced by the knowledge that the IMF is ready to step in to honour repayments. It continues in low-income countries. The <a href=\"http://www.equitybd.org/English/campaign/index3.html#1\" title=\"\">IMF is due to lend Bangladesh $1bn</a> over the next three years, money that will be used to help meet debt payments of $2bn a year; a huge 15% of government revenue.</p> <p>At the same time, IMF loans continue to impose particular economic policies on countries that borrow. Bangladesh is having to increase VAT, including on essentials such as rice, lentils and cooking oil, while cutting trade taxes, which could undermine small businesses and worsen the country's balance of payments, leading to more debts.</p> <p>In other low-income countries, IMF loans no longer look like debt bailouts. Many countries have seen their debt payments fall significantly in recent years, partly due to $130bn of debt cancellation by the IMF, World Bank and governments in response to the jubilee campaign for debt repudiation or cancellation. Yet many of these countries continue to borrow from the IMF, and for the long term. Burkina Faso, Malawi and Sierra Leone are among those that have been borrowing for more than a decade.</p> <p>In some countries, the IMF is effectively acting as a general development lender. IMF staff justify this by saying the loans can be used for productive investments, increasing exports, and making a country less vulnerable to crises. That may be true, but loans might also be used, for example, to pay for consumption of luxury imports by elites \u2013 leaving the entire country with a debt to be paid.</p> <p>The IMF accounts for 15% of all lending to low-income countries, and the World Bank is responsible for a further 30%. Debts in many countries are increasing again, with <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/may/20/poor-countries-debt-repayment-economic-crisis\" title=\"\">repayments by impoverished countries predicted to rise</a> by one-third between 2010 and 2014.</p> <p>One indicator of how rapidly debts are being created is the current account deficit. If imports are higher than exports, this has to be paid for by borrowing or other investments that create financial obligations. For the 15 low-income countries with which the IMF says it has had \"long-term engagement\" over the past decade, current account deficits have been <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/may/20/poor-countries-debt-repayment-economic-crisis\" title=\"\">increasing every year</a>, from 6% of GDP in 2002 to 15% in 2011. This could be sowing the seeds of future debt and financial crises.</p> <p>Saving low-income countries \u00a340m a year is a positive result. But it will be a drop in the ocean if continued IMF lending contributes to more devastating debt crises in the future.</p>",

As a result, Android is fragmenting beyond Google's control, and Google's Android strategy is rapidly coming undone in China with no immediate prospects for correction.</p> <p> Barring an unlikely accommodation with the Chinese government, we believe that Google's only short-term option is to try and limit Android's Chinese variations within China's borders.</p> </blockquote> <p> The point being that Google Play gets pushed off handsets in favour of local Chinese players. However, Android as a mobile OS is fabulously successful in China. (It's also where all those v2.2 and v2.3 handsets are.) Leading to the conclusion: </p> <blockquote> <p>Google cannot afford to let Android's Chinese variations extend beyond China's borders.

That 3 October debate was dominated by Romney and started the president's poll slide, leaving the two in a dead heat less than three weeks from election day.</p> <p>Obama will have lifted Democratic morale and may have done enough to slow \u2013 or even arrest \u2013 the crisis.</p> <p>It will be several days before the first reliable polls appear but a snap poll by CNN awarded the debate 46% to Obama and 39% to Romney, while CBS put it as 37% Obama to 30% Romney.</p> <p>Obama, listless in Denver, was transformed in the second debate: focused, animated and combative. The president grew in confidence in the later stages of the night, while Romney, confident at the start, began to fade.</p> <p>Obama's campaign team said Obama turned in the peformance it had expected him to produce two weeks ago.&#xa0;</p> <p>The former White House spokesman, Robert Gibbs, reinstated to the Obama team as an adviser, said: \"The president knew he did not do well two weeks ago. &#xa0;He knew he had to step up his game tonight and Mitt Romney was left looking uncomfortable\".</p> <p>Republicans countered that nothing the president said will have changed the dynamic of the race.</p> <p>Romney and Obama now have a presidential debate victory apiece going into the final one, usually the most watched of the three, in Boca Raton, Florida, on Monday.</p> <p>The two men clashed in the second debate \u2013 at Hofstra University, Long Island \u2013 over tax, energy, women's rights, immigration and Libya.&#xa0;</p> <p>Obama taunted Romney over the vagueness of his plans for tax cuts and deficit reduction.&#xa0;\"If somebody came to you, governor, with a plan that said, 'Here, I want to spend seven or eight trillion dollars, and we're going to pay for it, but we can't tell you until maybe after the election how we're going to do it,' you wouldn't have taken such a sketchy deal, and neither should you, the American people,\" Obama said.</p> <p>But the most politically damaging moment for Romney came when he bungled his attack on the Obama administration's handling of the assault on the Benghazi consulate in which the US ambassador Chris Stevens and three other Americans were killed.&#xa0;</p> <p>It should have been an easy one for Romney, after days of shifting accounts from administration officials who initially blamed the attack on a protest over an Islamophobic film but have now conceded it was a pre-planned terrorist attack.&#xa0;</p> <p>Romney accused Obama of flying off on fund-raising trips the day after the Benghazi killings.&#xa0;</p> <p>But Obama came back forcefully, accepting the buck stopped with him, not with Hillary Clinton or anyone else in his administration. \"Secretary Clinton has done an extraordinary job. But she works for me. I'm the president and I'm always responsible, and that's why nobody's more interested in finding out exactly what happened.\" He described as \"offensive\" Romney seeking to suggest that as president he was acting out of political motivation over the deaths of four Americans.</p> <p>Then, when Romney tried to challenge the president over his assertion that he had described it as an act of terror on the morning after the attack, the moderator Candy Crowley intervened to say that Obama was correct. \"He did, in fact, sir,\" she told Romney, who was unable to counter-attack.</p> <p>Crowley, CNN's chief political correspondent and the first woman in two decades to moderate a presidential debate,&#xa0;went on to point out that it had taken two weeks for the administration to abandon the idea that the attacks were related to protests over the anti-Muslim video. But her intervention left conservatives furious, with one Republican strategist describing it as the most egregious error by a debate moderator ever.</p> <p>Obama also hit home in an exchange over Romney's investments in China. When the Republican responded that Obama should look at the investments in his own pension, Obama, with his trademark grin, shot back: \"I don't look at my pension. It's not as big as yours.\"</p> <p>The power of the quip was that it encapsulated the image the Democrats have been labouring to put across of Romney as rich and elitist, in a different league from the majority of Americans. &#xa0;</p> <p>In the final minutes, to the relief of Democrats, Obama also mentioned the secret video in which Romney dismissed 47% of American voters as freeloaders. The president had dismayed Democrats when he failed to raise it in the Denver debate.</p> <p>The format, a town-hall debate with questions from the audience, makes exchanges between the two awkward and supposedly encourages civil exchanges. From the start Obama and Romney dispensed with tradition, rising from their seats to engage first with the questioners and then one another.</p> <p>During a discussion about lack of drilling for oil on federal land, the two could barely contain themselves, confronting one another just a few feet apart, almost eye-balling one another, with Obama saying \"not true\" while Romney insisted it was \"absolutely true\".</p> <p>Until then it was thought the animosity between the two was confined to policy but it became apparent there is also deep personal antipathy. At one point Romney, almost contemptuous of the president, told him: \"You will get your chance in a minute. I am speaking.\" &#xa0;Republicans may view this as Romney standing up to Obama and what they regard as a representative of the liberal media, but the risk is that independents view it as rudeness.</p> <p>In the early exchanges Romney held his own, at one point witheringly telling Obama that whatever he said he would do in his second term, his first term suggested otherwise.&#xa0;</p> <p>But his difficulties began with a question from an audience member over what the candidates would do to improve conditions for working women. He replied by talking about his time as governor of Massachusetts when he appointed many women into cabinet roles and had commissioned a study on women leaders. But he then delivered an unfortunate line when he said that he had looked through \"whole binders full of women\" when seeking to recruit cabinet members as Massachusetts governor.&#xa0;</p> <p>Romney also clashed repeatedly with Crowley over the rules and how much time he was being given to answer questions.&#xa0;</p> <p>In the spin room afterwards David Axelrod, Obama's campaign adviser, said Romney had been \"cornered and ran out of the room. &#xa0;It was clear to the American people he was exposed tonight.\"</p> <p>Romney's adviser, Ed Gillespie, said: \"The momentum continues for Governor Romney.\" Asked about Romney's failure to control the debate as he had in Denver, he said: \"I don't think it changes the dynamic. This was never about style. It is about substance \u2013 jobs \u2013 and that has not changed.\"</p>"
