  "<p>Her blonde hair, megaphone and orange fluorescent jacket with reflective stripes made 23-year-old Rachel Corrie easily identifiable as an international activist on the overcast spring afternoon in 2003 when she tried to stop an advancing Israeli military bulldozer.</p> <p>The young American's intention was to prevent the demolition of a Palestinian home in Rafah refugee camp, close to the border between the Gaza Strip and Egypt. Scores of homes had already been crushed; Corrie was one of eight American and British volunteers acting as human shields for local families.</p> <p>\"She was standing on top of a pile of earth,\" said fellow activist and eyewitness Richard Purssell, from Brighton, at the time. \"The driver cannot have failed to see her. As the blade pushed the pile, the earth rose up. Rachel slid down the pile. It looks as if her foot got caught. The driver didn't slow down; he just ran over her. Then he reversed the bulldozer back over her again.\"</p> <p>The question of whether the driver of the Caterpillar D9R bulldozer saw the young woman in the orange jacket, and drove deliberately at and over her, has been at the centre of the Corrie family's decade-long battle for accountability and justice.</p> <p>On Tuesday that struggle is set to culminate when an Israeli court gives its verdict in a civil lawsuit that the family have brought against the state of Israel.</p> <p>An Israeli Defence Forces investigation has already found that its forces were not to blame and that the bulldozer driver had not seen the activist. No charges were brought and the case was closed. The IDF report concluded: \"Rachel Corrie was not run over by an engineering vehicle but rather was struck by a hard object, most probably a slab of concrete which was moved or slid down while the mound of earth which she was standing behind was moved.\" Corrie and other International Solidarity Movement (ISM) activists were accused by the investigators of \"illegal, irresponsible and dangerous\" behaviour.</p> <p>But witness accounts gathered in Rafah in the aftermath of Corrie's death on 16 March 2003 suggest little doubt as to what happened. According to Tom Dale, from Lichfield in Staffordshire: \"the bulldozer went towards her very slowly, she was fully in clear view, straight in front of them\".</p> <p>Corrie tried to scramble on top of the earth being pushed into a mound by the bulldozer blades. \"Unfortunately she couldn't keep her grip there and she started to slip down. You could see she was in serious trouble, there was panic in her face as she was turning around. All the activists there were screaming, running towards the bulldozer, trying to get them to stop. But they just kept on going,\" Dale said. The incident lasted around six or seven seconds.</p> <p>Corrie was taken by a Red Crescent ambulance to the Najar hospital, arriving at the emergency room at 5.05pm. She was still alive \u2013 just. At 5.20pm she was declared dead. It was, the Israeli military said later that day, a \"very regrettable accident\".</p> <p>Rachel Corrie had arrived in the Holy Land on January 22, a young woman brimming with idealism, anger at injustice, and a determination to make a difference, however small.</p> <p>She had volunteered for the ISM, an organisation of pro-Palestinian activists who engage in direct action against the Israeli occupation of the Palestinian territories.</p> <p>After two days of training workshops, Corrie headed for Rafah in the southern Gaza Strip. In early 2003, Israeli troops, tanks and armoured vehicles were a daily presence in Rafah and other cities. Snipers were stationed in watchtowers; helicopters and military planes buzzed in the skies.</p> <p>The second intifada, or Palestinian uprising, had begun more than two years before, and suicide bombers were being regularly despatched from Gaza and the West Bank to cause death and destruction in Israel.</p> <p>Death and destruction was also a feature of life in Gaza. Corrie was shocked by what she saw. \"No amount of reading, attendance at conferences, documentary viewing and word of mouth could have prepared me for the reality of the situation here. You just cannot imagine it unless you see it,\" she wrote in one of her many emails to family and friends at home in Olympia, Washington state, on 7 February.</p> <p>Three weeks later, she told her mother, Cindy, in an email: \"I'm witnessing this chronic, insidious genocide and I'm really scared, and questioning my fundamental belief in the goodness of human nature. This has to stop. I think it's a good idea for all of us to drop everything and devote our lives to making it stop... Disbelief and horror is what I feel.\"</p> <p>Corrie and other ISM activists in Rafah were mainly engaged in trying to obstruct house demolitions being carried out by the IDF, which said the targeted homes were suspected of sheltering militants or concealing the entrances to tunnels dug under the border with Egypt to facilitate the smuggling of weapons and explosives. The activists said the demolitions were collective punishment for the actions of a minority of militants.</p> <p>The presence of international activists was a nuisance for the IDF, but the military was not to be deterred. \"During war there are no civilians,\" an IDF training officer later told Haifa district court during a hearing into the Corrie family's civil lawsuit, implying that militants, Palestinian civilians and international activists were all legitimate targets.</p> <p>A Israeli military spokesman described ISM activists as \"a group of protesters who were acting very irresponsibly, putting everyone in danger \u2014 the Palestinians, themselves and our forces \u2014 by intentionally placing themselves in a combat zone.\"</p> <p>But Corrie's death caused an outcry far greater than that of any Palestinian. According to the Observer, nine Palestinians, including a girl, 4, and 90-year-old man, were killed on the same day. But inevitably the death of young American woman made headlines around the world and caused serious diplomatic reverberations.</p> <p>The next day, Israel's then prime minister, Ariel Sharon, promised US president George W Bush that Israel would conduct a \"thorough, credible and transparent\" investigation into the incident.</p> <p>Corrie's body was taken by the Israeli authorities to the National Centre of Forensic Medicine in Tel Aviv, where an autopsy was conducted. No report was published but, according to Human Rights Watch, the conclusion was that death was caused by \"pressure on the chest ... with fractures of the ribs and vertebrae ... and tear wounds in the right lung with haemorrhaging of the pleural cavities\".</p> <p>The Corrie family was not satisfied with the IDF report. Seven years after their daughter's death, in March 2010, they launched a civil case against the state of Israel, accusing its military of either unlawfully or intentionally killing Corrie or of gross negligence. It was, said the family, \"absolutely our last resort\".</p> <p>Sporadic hearings dragged on for 18 months. The court heard testimony from four ISM activists who witnessed the incident, but a Gaza doctor who examined Corrie's wounds was refused an entry permit to Israel to give evidence.</p> <p>The driver of the bulldozer, whose identity has not been made public, testified from behind a screen for \"security reasons\". He repeatedly insisted that the first time he saw the activist was when she was already dying: \"I didn't see her before the incident. I saw people pulling the body out from under the earth.\"</p> <p>When the hearings ended in July last year, Corrie's mother Cindy said the family was \"at this moment in much the same place as we were when they began \u2013 up against a wall of Israeli officials determined to protect the state at all costs, including at the expense of truth.\"</p> <p>Last week, back in Israel for the verdict in the civil lawsuit, Cindy told the Guardian the ruling would be \"a milestone\" in the family's long battle for justice and accountability. \"The lawsuit is only one part of what we've done. There has still been no 'thorough, credible and transparent' investigation into Rachel's death. Whatever happens, this is not the end.\"</p>",
  "<p>Those of you who use Sainsbury's self-checkout will be familiar with the sing-song female voice that asks, \"Have you swiped your Nectar card?\" (to&#xa0;which my unvarying response is, \"No, I applied for it in the normal way.\") Well, despite her sterling work on the Nectar thing, and on \"Unexpected item in bagging area,\" she has been ditched for the supermarket's sponsorship of the Paralympics. David&#xa0;Beckham is Sainsbury's voice of the games.</p> <p>On Jon Snow's Paralympic Show, Channel 4's daily countdown to the event, the voice was joined by the man himself, playing blind football alongside David Clarke, captain of Britain's team, in a film produced by the retailer \u2013 BT, the other main sponsor, provides content as well \u2013 the kind of commercial tie-in this column would normally treat with large doses of the gimlet eye.</p> <p>I'm not sure, though, that I have put the requisite work in to retain my cynicism for the Paralympics. I have trained hard in weekly sessions on this page but you have to be really dedicated to the cause, in the face of the triumphs of human endeavour presented to us nightly on Snow's show and I found myself pondering on the wonderful implausibility of blind football.</p> <p>Players are blindfolded \u2013 as Beckham was for the feature \u2013 to ensure equality of visual impairment. The ball has a bell in it, while team-mates' shouts also help provide clues to its whereabouts; but as one of the tactics is to give false calls to mislead opponents, you wonder at the level of concentration and quickness of thought required of the participants. Goalkeepers are sighted, which adds to the difficulty, and meant even the sainted Beckham struggled from the penalty spot \u2013 not unlike at Euro 2004.</p> <p>The atmosphere at blind football will be unusual, said Clarke, as the reliance on aural information means crowds will need to be largely silent, although anybody who has been in the Emirates during periods of midfield stalemate should not have too much trouble adjusting. With the extensive coverage promised, one assumes it will not be long before we look past the disability to the sport, but Snow's programme is about the whys and hows, and, given the devilish difficulty of the enterprise, you simply marvelled at why a blind person would take up playing football in the first place. Refereeing, yes \u2026 (I'm joking, I'm joking).</p> <p>When not lost in admiration for the athletes, it was Snow's outfit that took the eye. Each evening, he wore a&#xa0;barbershop quartet-style stripy jacket&#xa0;\u2013 different colours, but essentially the same jacket \u2013 that made you wonder if he had taken wardrobe tips from Homer Simpson or Peter Griffin, who once opened his closet in an episode of Family Guy to reveal row upon row of identical white shirts and green trousers.</p> <p>But let's not trivialise the Games with discourse on Snow's jackets. Let us instead trivialise them with comment on Clare Balding's presenting style. Clare, who will be presenting on Channel 4 during the Games, was one of Snow's guests alongside Dr Kevin Fong, a scientist and consultant anaesthetist. Fong made an excellent film with Sophia Warner, a sprinter with cerebral palsy, explaining how the condition makes every five metres of a sprint like an event in itself. He used the analogy of a train having to divert when confronted by a blocked line. The runner , he demonstrated, has to constantly find a new \"route\" as avenues are closed down by the imperfect brain.</p> <p>As Clare joined in on the conversation with Dr Fong, I wondered if I am alone in being ever so slightly disturbed by her intensity. The thing about Clare is that she works phenomenally hard on everything she presents. No one prepares better and if you are looking for an assured presence behind a live microphone or in front of a live camera, she is the gold standard. Clare emerged from the Olympics second only to Lord Coe in paragon status.</p> <p>And yet, watching her quizzing Dr Fong, and more so presenting the rugby league cup final on BBC on Saturday, I wondered if she could maybe back off a little, take it down a notch. It's a nebulous thing but sometimes Clare seems to be not so much engaging the camera \u2013 which she does, admirably \u2013 as grabbing it with both hands, pinning it to the wall, and letting it have it.</p> <p>Obviously, I would not counsel less preparation, although some of the lazier presenters of the past \u2013 we know who they are \u2013 sometimes felt more comfortable to spend time with. It&#xa0;has to be conceded, though, that without all the hard work, she would not have got to grips with an alien sport like rugby league as impressively as she has.&#xa0;</p> <p>I suppose I feel about Clare the way some do about Coldplay, praising their early work but feeling that now they are everywhere, they are more open to criticism. I recognise equally that I may be out on a limb on this and it may simply be an unexpected item in my personal baggage.</p>",

  "<p>Another migrant housing problem.

  "<p>Lady <a href=\"http://www.tanni.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Grey-Thompson</a> may be Britain's greatest Paralympian, a TV personality and a dame of the British empire, but if like her you use a wheelchair, fame and stellar achievement can count for little when confronted with the vagaries of the public transport system.</p> <p>At one point this year she found herself marooned alone at midnight on a commuter train. She'd reached her destination but the carefully booked staff assistance was nowhere in sight.</p> <p>\"I ended up having to get out of my [wheel]chair, sit on the floor, which is not a terribly pleasant place to sit, throw my chair off the train and then crawl off,\" she recalled.</p> <p>It was not the first time Grey-Thompson had been forced to perform an undignified all-fours shimmy on to a station platform in the early hours. She pointed out it was precisely the kind of avoidable \"second-class passenger\" experience that disabled people endure frequently.</p> <p>\"As a disabled person travelling you always have an element of fear, feeling very uncomfortable, of panic, of just wondering if you are going to get off.\"</p> <p>Tanni Grey-Thompson was Britain's first disabled sports superstar, but she has become, almost surreptitiously, one of Britain's most high-profile disability rights activists. She straddles elite sport, politics and the media and forms a crucial, unique link between the buzzy, feel-good optimism surrounding the Paralympics, and the harsh, uncomfortable reality of life for many disabled people in welfare cuts-era Britain.</p> <p>A fresh batch of British sporting stars will sweep to greater prominence as a result of the Paralympics: Lee Pearson, David Weir, Ellie Simmonds and Jonnie Peacock and others are set to stamp their mark on the wider public consciousness in the next few weeks. They will follow the path blazed by Grey-Thompson, a pioneer in perhaps less auspicious times.</p> <p>\"Tanni was the first UK athlete in Paralympic sports to cut though to mainstream sports followers. She was a very successful athlete, but she also had a strong sense of identity and character, and a compelling personal story,\" says Tim Hollingsworth, chief executive of the <a href=\"http://www.paralympics.org.uk/gb\" title=\"\">British Paralympic Association</a>.</p> <p>Grey-Thompson bagged a prodigious haul of wheelchair racing medals in a glittering career over three decades (11 golds at five Paralympics, five world championship golds, six times London marathon winner, 30 world records smashed). She was not the only hyper-successful UK Paralympian of her day, but her charisma, coupled with her success in the London marathon (at a time when the event became a globally televised, mainstream sporting event) pushed her to the forefront.</p> <p>Her fame was cemented when, in 2000, she came third in the <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/keyfacts/stories/spoty.shtml\" title=\"\">BBC viewers poll for Sports Personality of the Year</a>, just behind Steve Redgrave and Denise Lewis, and ahead of David Beckham (the BBC neglected to build a ramp in the studio, so she could not come on to the stage to collect her award). At that point, with 12 years' competitive racing under her belt and seven to go, she was arguably the first disabled British athlete to become a household name.</p> <p>Grey-Thompson was born with spina bifida in 1969. She walked for the first few years of her life but by the age of seven had lost the use of her legs. Her parents refused to see her disability as an impairment, and even though her father, Peter, was an architect, they refused to make adaptations to the family home in Cardiff, believing their daughter should learn to live in the real world (\"We are all bloody-minded in this family,\" she once said).</p> <p>Grey-Thompson says she was \"brought up to believe that I could achieve anything I wanted to as long as I studied hard and worked at things\". In her early teens, her local authority suggested she should be sent to a special school. She and her parents dug in. \"Mum and Dad talked it through with me, as they did everything, and said I would go to a mainstream school even if it meant going to Wiltshire.\"</p> <p>She went to St Cyres comprehensive school near Cardiff, where she passed 10 O-levels, four A-levels, and got a place to study politics at Loughborough University. \"I didn't need special education,\" Grey-Thompson recalled, \"I needed an accessible school. I didn't need to be learning how to make a cup of tea at 14. I needed to be studying for O-levels.\"</p> <p>She had learned quickly to fight back against condescension and prejudice. In her teens, she was refused admission to a cinema on the grounds that she was \"a fire risk\". Why, she shot back, did they think she was going to spontaneously combust?</p> <p>Misguided attempts by well-wishers to literally or metaphorically pat her on the back and praise her \"pluckiness\" are given short shrift. Being in a wheelchair, she maintains, has never stopped her from doing anything she wanted to do. The enemy of disabled sporting achievement is pity, she has suggested. \"I don't want to be patted on the head and told I've done well if I haven't.\"</p> <p>Her newspaper profiles over the years are peppered with self-deprecating references to her sporting ruthlessness: her constant mentions of her selfishness and egotism; her win-at-all-costs, only-gold-medals-matter mentality; or the time she flung her helmet at her boyfriend in frustration after losing a race. She is single-minded, but she ramps it up, as if to sabotage journalistic attempts to frame her life in mawkish, triumph-over-adversity terms.</p> <p>Her straight-talking can ruffle feathers, and not just among the sports administrators of whom she has, in the past, been scathing. In 2005, she left MPs gobsmacked when she told them that Britain's prospects for success in the 2012 Paralympics might depend on how many road accidents there would be. \"The fact is, we don't know some of those who will be competing in 2012 because they haven't broken their backs yet,\" she explained.</p> <p>Others testify to the kindness and encouragement she offers to younger competitors and aspiring athletes. The Paralympic sprinter <a href=\"http://paralympics.channel4.com/the-athletes/athleteid=14/qa.html\" title=\"\">Ben Rushgrove </a>was starting out on his career as Grey-Thompson's was winding down. He says she was a \"massive help\" to young athletes on \"what could be achieved and how to go about training for it\".</p> <p>Tense and nervous after a day's competition, he recalls being seated at a dinner table with Grey-Thompson, who put him at ease with a stream of funny stories and anecdotes. \"She was good at breaking the ice and the tension after a hard day. It took my mind off what was going on, and at that age I wasn't very good at that.\"</p> <p>Grey-Thompson says she's mellowed in recent years. She had a daughter, Carys, in 2002, and was back in training two and a half weeks after the birth, a caeserean section. She completed the London marathon six weeks after that. But motherhood, she admitted the following year, had made her \"gentler, more emotional and more patient \u2026 I [realised] you can't do everything at 100mph.\"</p> <p>Like other former top athletes, she has smoothly embraced the lucrative world of the media, corporate sponsorship and motivational speaking. Articulate, and funny, she was one of the faces of the BBC's 2012 Olympics TV coverage, and will be <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/disability-sport/19118962\" title=\"\">an expert summariser on BBC 5 Live radio</a> for the Paralympics, alongside John Inverdale.</p> <p>Few who knew her during her athletics career would be surprised that she had a game plan for her post-track life, or that she has made such a success of it.</p> <p>Some may be astonished, however, that within weeks of the Paralympics closing ceremony she will be back in the House of Lords, where as <a href=\"http://www.parliament.uk/biographies/lords/tanni-grey-thompson/84715\" title=\"\">a crossbencher </a>she takes an active, serious interest in disability rights, women's issues, and welfare reform.</p> <p>As an athlete, she eschewed campaigning.

She is currently <a href=\"http://www.bhfederation.org.uk/component/k2/item/1723-universal-credit-%E2%80%98spells-bleak-future-for-many%E2%80%99.html\" title=\"\">leading an inquiry into the impact on disabled people of ministers' plans to introduce universal credit</a> \u2013 a move she has warned is likely to make the future \"considerably bleaker\" for many disabled people.</p> <p>Although she champions the Paralympics and the power of sport to effect social change, Grey-Thompson doggedly punctures attempts to suggest the event will transform deep-seated discriminatory social attitudes towards disabled people overnight.</p> <p>Grey-Thompson says she is happier than ever in her new role \u2013 \"If it's possible, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-18970631\" title=\"\">I love being in the Lords more than I loved being an athlete</a>,\" she said recently.</p> <p>Hollingsworth, for one, is not surprised: \"Tanni has that restless energy that characterises a lot of world-class athletes, and she has that knowledge and understanding of the wider world.

And they are lucky if they can get a word in if anybody tries to argue with her.\" <em>Her father, Peter Grey</em></p>",
  "<p>Whether or not it made sporting sense, it was classic showbusiness: induce hype, deliver a stellar performance then leave the audience clamoring for more \u2013 unsure if they'll get it.</p> <p>Out of retirement to pitch for the Sugar Land Skeeters on Saturday night, Roger Clemens started with a strike \u2013 of course \u2013 and allowed only one hit in 3.1 innings. He threw 37 pitches, 24 of them strikes, and struck out two Bridgeport Bluefish without issuing a walk. He is 50 years old.</p> <p>Sighs in the stands when he walked off the mound after less than an hour swiftly mutated into a standing ovation. His fastest pitch was timed at 88 mph: respectable, if around 10mph slower than his heyday. His pitching motion looked as refined as the sugar once produced by the nearby landmark factory that gives Sugar Land its name.</p> <p>Clemens was humble about his efforts and foggy regarding his future. \"I'm very fortunate, very blessed that I was able to go out and throw well,\" he said. Will he pitch again for the Skeeters, or even a Major League Baseball club? \"I don't know exactly what's next,\" he said, other than that his immediate plans involve \"a lot of ice\".</p> <p>Arguably the greatest post-war pitcher, Clemens netted $150m in salary, two World Series rings, seven Cy Young awards, 354 games won, 11 All-Star appearances and third place on the all-time strikeout list during a 24-year career with the Boston Red Sox, Toronto Blue Jays, New York Yankees and Houston Astros.</p> <p>Yesterday's action came five years after his second retirement. He first quit after pitching for the Yankees in the 2003 World Series, then changed his mind and spent three luminous years with the Astros, returning to the Bronx for a season in 2007.</p> <p>And here he was in the Atlantic League, a professional independent eight-team competition that acts as a feeder division for MLB clubs and a way for discarded veterans to stave off the inevitable onset of real life. Players, Clemens included, earn at best $3,000 per month. If there is personal anguish among those whose major league dreams grow more distant with each strikeout or bad pitch, then it's hard to spot.</p> <p>Overall the tone is frivolous. The sort of cheerful chutzpah that causes a club to name itself after its region's biggest pest: \"skeeter\" is southern slang for \"mosquito\". The branding must send mixed messages to children as they pose for photographs with the giant furry mosquito mascot in the midst of the worst West Nile virus outbreak in Texas history.</p> <p>In their inaugural season, the Skeeters are already PR savvy, slick and adored by their fanbase. It is only slightly mischievous to joke that they have a better pitching rotation than the Astros. Former major leaguers Scott Kazmir, Tim Redding and Jason Lane were already on the books. Their home is Constellation Field, a superb $37m stadium in an affluent commuter town 20 miles south-west of downtown Houston.</p> <p>Time between innings is spent staging contests between people dressed as animals. Relief pitchers are chauffeured from bullpen to mound in a cart shaped like a baseball. Until Clemens signed, the Skeeters had scheduled an appearance from Ted Bachelor, The Human Fireball (\"Guinness World Record holder for Most People On Fire Simultaneously\").</p> <p>As Clemens took to the mound a cheesy song from the Astros days exhorted fans to \"make some racket for The Rocket\". They did, but the noise was hardly deafening; the overall mood mellow, interested rather than intense. Of course, actually watching baseball is but one of many choices when at a minor league ballpark.</p> <p>Television truck antennae leered like triffids over one side of the outfield, a clear indication that this game was a matter of national importance; indeed, televised live on ESPN Classic. Oblivious, kids swarmed over the carousel and playground behind left field next to the Texas-shaped giant video screen. Clemens battled for attention with the swimming pool and all-you-can eat picnic plaza near the left field foul pole.</p> <p>Some missed a few of his pitches because they were queuing at the Buzzzz Stop store for a Skeeters T-shirt with the legend's name on the back ($16.24). Stalls behind home plate offered \"complimentary analysis of the nervous system\" and invited folks to enter the Rotary club's win-a-truck raffle. Overheated men in medieval garb promoted the Texas Renaissance Fair.</p> <p>By the time the game was over and the Skeeters had won, 1-0, perhaps 2,000 of the sell-out 7,724 crowd were still on the premises. Hundreds left immediately after Clemens was relieved of duty, including an Astros fan called Eric Olson.</p> <p>\"It was good, pretty much what we expected. He's an old guy, there's not much more he could have done,\" Olson said. \"We were hoping he'd go six innings to a complete game. I guess he didn't want to end up in the hospital,\" said his friend, Richard Bard.</p> <p>Clemens could well end up in the major leagues. Scouts from the Astros and Kansas City Royals were present and he is friendly with the Astros' owner, Jim Crane.</p> <p>The pitcher has argued that this was simply an opportunity to benefit the local community and for him to have some fun. But it is hard to believe he would wish to be a novelty act in a theme park setting unless it was a prelude to something greater. He is hardwired for combat from 60 feet, six inches. Even his children are named Koby, Kory, Kacy and Kody \u2013 \"K\" being the baseball symbol for strikeout.</p> <p>He has always craved contests that matter, and he won the biggest of his life in June. It is only two months since Clemens wept outside a Washington courthouse after a jury found him not guilty of lying to Congress about steroid use. The case was a retrial after the first attempt collapsed last year when prosecutors showed the jury inadmissible evidence.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395229470\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/26/1345987842995/Roger-Clemens-010.jpg\" alt=\"Roger Clemens\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sugar Land Skeeters Roger Clemens throws a pitch during a baseball game against the Bridgeport Bluefish Aug 25. Photograph: David Phillip/AP</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Phillip/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>His former personal trainer, Brian McNamee, testified that he had injected drugs into Clemens' backside between 1998 and 2001, but Clemens' legal team did a good job of discrediting McNamee during proceedings that lasted 10 weeks and were occasionally so tedious that some jury members fell asleep.</p> <p>It was the climax to a controversy that erupted with the publication in December 2007 of the Mitchell Report into performance-enhancing drugs in baseball, which named Clemens and other high-profile stars.</p> <p>After Clemens insisted to a congressional inquiry the next year that he was completely innocent, federal prosecutors charged him in 2010 with obstruction, making false statements and perjury. Facing jail if convicted, he was cleared on all counts, effectively bringing to a close the government's costly and unsuccessful efforts to pursue those linked to baseball's steroids era.</p> <p>Barry Bonds, the all-time home run king, avoided a prison sentence when he was convicted last year not of using steroids but of misleading a grand jury when asked about steroids \u2013p an outcome that felt like the baseball equivalent of Al Capone being convicted for tax evasion.</p> <p>Clemens has always maintained his probity, though it is not surprising investigators were intrigued by a power pitcher who was as good in his forties as during his twenties. He remains a divisive figure nationally, indelibly tainted in the court of public opinion despite the jury's verdict.</p> <p>But not in Houston, where the former University of Texas student lives and retains local hero status. Powered by Texan pride and pragmatism, the city of Big Oil, Enron and Halliburton is adept at absorbing scandals and moving forward. The recently jailed Ponzi scheme fraudster and one-time cricket mogul, Allen Stanford, parked his jets at a private airport across from Constellation Field.</p> <p>Clemens has a personal services contract with the Astros, who may well ask him to take to the mound next month. He has said that he is nowhere near ready to play for a major league team, which is something he has in common with most of the Astros roster. The Astros are in need of hype, attention and a diversion to dilute the feel-bad factor as they skid towards the end of their second successive season as the worst team in MLB.</p> <p>Clemens repeatedly downplayed the idea since his comeback was confirmed last Monday. \"It's a great deal of work and I'm not thinking that at this point,\" he said yesterday. But he has never dismissed it. \"The Astros need some identity right now,\" he added.</p> <p>If Clemens makes an immediate return to the major leagues he will be ineligible for the Hall of Fame ballot for five years. That might be a smart strategy. Next year's candidates include some of the greatest players in history \u2013 the likes of Clemens, Sammy Sosa, Bonds and Mike Piazza.</p> <p>Yet none is likely to be elected to baseball's pantheon in 2013 given the popular and media backlash against stars whose feats were improbably prodigious at a time when substance use was rampant. Some distance might aid Clemens' prospects.</p> <p>He waxed philosophical yesterday. \"Over my career and my life it's been far more good than bad,\" he said. As for those 37 pitches: \"It wasn't five years ago but it was pretty good.\"</p> <p>A fair analysis of his display on an engrossingly strange occasion when minor league met major celebrity and it was hard to know which was the right response: why? Or why not?</p>",

  "<p>Think of Ethiopia and what do you see. Perhaps a starving child, flies in her eyes and belly distended. Painfully thin adults in raggedy clothes, staring balefully at the camera in a fetid refugee camp. Or possibly a famous self-declared saviour from the west, striding purposefully past the decaying corpse of an animal beside a dusty road.</p> <p>Think again. See, instead, a booming capital city, its cafes filled with graduates and cranes lining the horizon. A nation that is one of the world's largest livestock producers and recently became the second country to take delivery of <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-19293543\" title=\"\">Boeing's new 787 passenger jet</a>. An economy that doubled in size this century and is growing at 7.5%.</p> <p>Few countries symbolise the disconnect between outdated western perceptions of Africa and fast-changing&#xa0;realities on the ground better than Ethiopia, the continent's second most-populous nation, whose <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/21/ethiopia-meles-zenawi-dies-illneses\" title=\"\">long-serving leader, Meles Zenawi, died last week</a>. Although&#xa0;the example of one country can never fully explain a diverse continent, this ancient nation illustrates in many ways Africa's progress, potential and problems. Mostly, it is a picture of amazing progress, far removed from the usual stereotypes presented by much of the media and their allies in the aid lobby. They offer simplistic images of death and destruction, ignoring complex realities of a continent encompassing 54 countries and 11.6 million square miles in which life is becoming more peaceful and prosperous.</p> <p>Last week, Africa was in the news over the shooting of striking miners in South Africa, a disturbing echo of the dark days of apartheid. The tragedy highlighted the failure of the party of liberation to deliver social justice in government; the nation is now the world's most unequal society. But it is worth remembering the country is a democracy, with free expression, a fine constitution and some accountability for those deemed responsible.</p> <p>Ethiopia's Zenawi was part of what Bill Clinton and Tony Blair hailed as the new generation of African leaders, heralding an African renaissance alongside <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Kagame\" title=\"\">Paul Kagame</a> in Rwanda and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoweri_Museveni\" title=\"\">Yoweri Museveni</a> in Uganda. Politically, they failed to deliver, festering in office as despotic autocrats.</p> <p>But there is a new Africa emerging, powered by capitalism, embracing globalisation and finally shaking off the shackles of colonialism and the cold war that proved so crippling to development. Just look at the land of Live Aid: one of the world's fastest-growing nations, a sub-Saharan success story like six more of the 10 most expanding economies. Poverty is far from banished \u2013 it's a grinding way of life for millions \u2013 but their numbers are falling fast.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.economist.com/blogs/dailychart/2011/01/daily_chart\" title=\"\">global top 10</a> also includes Ghana, which grew by more than 14% last year and whose cherished democracy sets such a great example; Mozambique, rising like a phoenix from the devastation of a long civil war; and Nigeria, the continent's potential superpower. Bundle all African countries together and they have grown faster for much of the past decade than East Asia.</p> <p>Some dismiss this as just a consequence of the continent's rich resources at a time of rampant development in many parts of the globe. Certainly, oil has fuelled spectacular growth in several countries, while others have made recent discoveries of deposits that ensure Africa will play an increasingly critical geopolitical role. But Ethiopia does not pump any petroleum, relying instead on exports such as cattle, coffee and cut flowers; the value of these exports quadrupled in under a decade.</p> <p>This is the youngest continent, enjoying a demographic dividend with a working population growing by around 10-12 million people each year. An emerging middle class \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2011/may/05/one-three-africans-middle-class\" title=\"\">one-third of Africans</a>, according to one analysis \u2013 is behind an explosion in consumerism. Already, Africans spend more per head than Indians on goods and services.</p> <p>There are still huge hurdles, with sclerotic border controls, stifling bureaucracy, sluggish courts and sleazy corruption. Infrastructure, while improving, remains inadequate \u2013 one reason for the boom in mobile phones transforming everything from agriculture to healthcare. Young Africans \u2013 impatient for change, innovative and increasingly well-educated \u2013 are using mobile technologies to solve problems presented by poor services and political stagnation.</p> <p>And this vibrant continent is getting even younger, with plummeting levels of child mortality and falling fertility. Ethiopia, where nearly half the 84 million population is under the age of 15, is one of 10 countries seeing incredible falls in <a href=\"http://blogs.cgdev.org/globaldevelopment/2012/05/africas-child-health-miracle-the-biggest-best-story-in-development.php\" title=\"\">infant death rates</a> of more than 5% a year. In Senegal, the decline is twice that, stunning figures without precedent in recent history.</p> <p>There has been no single cause of this child health miracle, attributed to a mix of better governance, new technologies and improved health policies, while for all the enduring chaos in the Democratic Republic of Congo, conflict is becoming rarer and more localised. Even Somalia, ripped apart by civil war, is making a faltering return to normality; <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/20/somalia-first-parliament-inaugurated\" title=\"\">last week, it convened its first parliament since 1991</a>. As Michael Clemens, an economist at the Centre for Global Development, said: \"This will be startling news for anyone who still thinks sub-Saharan Africa is mired in unending poverty and death. That Africa is slipping away.\"</p> <p>Unfortunately, this message is failing&#xa0;to filter through to the west, where too many people remain locked into stale narratives of Africa as a land of suffering in need of our salvation. This is to our long-term detriment, especially in Britain, with such strong historic ties, a common language in many countries and the soft power strength of pop music and Premier League football. Twenty years ago, there was virtual economic dependence on Europe; today, half of Africa's trade is with other developing nations \u2013 and not&#xa0;just China.</p> <p>The continent is on the edge of economic takeoff similar to those seen so dramatically in China and India. For all the problems that still exist, a recent&#xa0;survey found investors in Africa&#xa0;are overwhelmingly positive, while those not there are unfailingly negative. These anachronistic attitudes&#xa0;reflect the west's myopic view, but we cannot afford to cling on to them in a world changing so fast. It is time to recognise the emergence of the new Africa.</p>"
