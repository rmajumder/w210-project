  "<p>Even with a new film to sell, Guy Maddin is not your standard-issue eager-to-please director. \"So many people are baffled,\" he says, with well-practised irony. \"The movie will be crystal-clear upon your third viewing.\" This is <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/143131/keyhole\" title=\"\">Keyhole</a>, Maddin's ninth full-length film since 1988; and against all the odds it's secured a theatrical release in the UK. Most of Maddin's work simply doesn't get to Britain, so resolutely has he followed his own path.</p> <p>If you know him at all, it is probably for his ballet film <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rYroFjMvbWk\" title=\"\">Dracula: Pages from a Virgin Diary</a>, or just possibly <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/125068/my.winnipeg\" title=\"\">My Winnipeg</a>, his heartfelt docu-essay tribute to his Canadian hometown. More energetic cineastes may remember 2003's <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/97578/saddest.music.in.the.world\" title=\"\">The Saddest Music in the World</a>, Maddin's most determined shot at the mainstream, an elaborate parody musical starring Isabella Rossellini. The truly dedicated will have sought out <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rzHKR7zbCE8\" title=\"\">Tales from the Gimli Hospital</a>, his 1988 feature debut, set in the remote Canadian settlement of Gimli, some 50 miles north of Winnipeg. All share Maddin's preoccupations: a swirl of phantasmagoric imagery and cut-up surrealism, filtered through his particular brand of cinema ancestor-worship (German silents, 50s Technicolor, big-hat noir) and occasional shafts of very daft humour. Clarity of narrative and ease of access is not high on the agenda; Maddin would appear to be the closest living counterpart we have to <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Smith_%28film_director%29\" title=\"\">Jack Smith, the underground legend of Flaming Creatures renown</a>.</p> <p>In the flesh, the 56-year-old Maddin turns out to be an avuncular, energetic talker, not afraid to discuss his elaborate concepts in detail. Keyhole, it emerges, was made as a result of \"a bunch of dreams I was having that have really been haunting me\". \"Melancholy dreams,\" he says, \"where I revisit my past: dead relatives and homes that have meant a lot to me, particularly my childhood home. I can remember them far better in the dream than I can in waking hours.\"</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395427677\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/30/1346339385121/Guy-Maddin-001.jpg\" alt=\"Guy Maddin\" width=\"210\" height=\"330\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Guy Maddin: 'Whether I want them to or not, my movies end up disjointed and \u00addisconnected and discontinuous.'

Keyhole mashes together noir-gangster imagery with Homer's Odyssey \u2013 \"The Odyssey is a story witnessed through the eyes of a son who idolises his father as a great warrior, and I had a childish notion of a father as a strong alpha-male gangster\" \u2013 and sets up a frankly bizarre and sketchy-to-the-point-of-nonexistent storyline of a hoodlum journeying from room to room in a seemingly haunted house. \"New-age friends of mine say I should say goodbye to my father and wrap him up in a blanket and put him in the ground for ever. But I don't want to. Since we all live in the past and present simultaneously, and the past makes us who we are in the present, destroying it is such a cockeyed notion.\"</p> <p>But Keyhole's tenuous relationship with narrative logic, or even moment-to-moment comprehensibility, means it's perhaps a tad on the self-indulgent side? \"Whether I want them to or not, my movies end up disjointed and disconnected and discontinuous. I feel the only way I can get away with such loosey-goosiness, even for my own judge and jury, if it's genuinely coming from some place honest.\"</p> <p>Maddin can't resist a little facetiousness. \"People have been telling me for years I do myself no favours by making movies that are difficult to classify, so I went all out to make a genre piece to push it through to blockbuster domination.\" He cites the unexpected success of the Dracula film as a forerunner: \"People had an idea of what they'd get, and they got it. People showed up for it. It was supposed to be a one-off thing for TV and ended up getting a theatrical release. The advice I had been given for decades was right: working in the genre mode really helped.\"</p> <p>Still, Maddin wasn't about to give up his habitual idiosyncrasies. He staged <a href=\"http://vimeo.com/802202\" title=\"\">\"collage parties\"</a> to help generate script ideas for Keyhole: \"I invited the best young up-and-coming scene-grabbing artists, in various cities. I would prime their pumps with a few words \u2013 'electric chair', things like that \u2013 and supplied a stack of old melodrama magazines, a stack of porn, and a few kegs of bourbon. We embarked on a very peaceful and therapeutic and yet disruptive process of snipping paper into blizzards of nipples.\"</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/axxhRAuGC5c?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"295\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/axxhRAuGC5c\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>Maddin says he sold a few of the collages to help finance the film: \"I should have kept them, on the off-chance they'd go up in value, but I needed the money pretty badly.\" This underlines the fact that Maddin occupies a special niche, midway between the cinema world and fine art. Money seems to be increasingly on his mind, and explains why he is cropping up so often in galleries. \"I never thought about money in the past; but I decided when I turned 50 I was going to have to. I have no savings, no retirement plan, and the art world just seems wealthier. I started to be more serious about it four or five years ago, and I liked my initial sorties there.\"</p> <p>You also get the sense that the art world is as accepting of film-makers as cinema is of artists: Maddin mentions <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/apichatpong-weerasethakul\" title=\"\">Apichatpong Weerasethakul</a>, but he might just as well have taken cues from <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/artanddesign/2012/mar/26/patrick-keiller-robinson-institute-review\" title=\"\">Patrick Keiller </a>or <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/artanddesign/2007/sep/20/art.popandrock\" title=\"\">Matthew Barney</a>. For the past year or so, Maddin has been working on a film \"seance\" project called Hauntings (or <a href=\"http://www.centrepompidou.fr/Pompidou/Manifs.nsf/0/100E97AF7A91DF75C12579A00050073F?OpenDocument\" title=\"\">Spiritismes</a>, when it fetched up at the Pompidou in Paris earlier this year). The idea is that Maddin and his cohorts would \"contact\" the ghost of a lost film \u2013 <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ladies_of_the_Mob\" title=\"\">William Wellman's Ladies of the Mob</a>, for example, or <a href=\"http://criterioncorner.tumblr.com/post/19638293467/udo-kier-being-possessed-by-mikio-naruses-the\" title=\"\">Mikio Naruse's The Strength of a Moustache</a> \u2013 and then recreate/reimagine it as if under the influence of the cosmic ectoplasm. It's expensive, says Maddin, at half a million dollars a go, but he puts on a good show.</p> <p>Maddin says he tried shooting some of the seances simultaneously with Keyhole, on the same set (\"I built a little studio system where I deployed eight guest film-makers from various parts of my past to shoot in different rooms\"); but Maddin's attempt to be the Louis B Mayer of art cinema had to be abandoned after \"the demands of the two projects started hurting each other\". In practice, this meant actorly rows: Maddin giggles at the memory of his Keyhole stars Jason Patric and Udo Kier storming off set after the latter \"started screaming out as Kaiser Wilhelm in <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Kaiser,_the_Beast_of_Berlin\" title=\"\">The Beast of Berlin</a> in one corner while Jason was trying to achieve some serene, wrathful interiority on Keyhole in another\".</p> <p>Maddin remains an unrepentant avant-gardist, a film-maker committed to walking the untrodden ways, far from commercial gain and sobbing acclaim. Keyhole is no exception. \"I&#xa0;wanted to make something viewers could let themselves go with and just listen to, like a piece of music. I don't mean listen with their ears, I mean listen with their eyes; and feel no need to understand it, but just take it in.\" It may not be to everyone's taste, but cinema is all the richer for his trying.</p> <p>\u2022 Keyhole is released in the UK on 14 September</p>",
  "<p>A lone voice of sanity in a world of madness, Lost in Showbiz professes itself disappointed with Britain this summer. What a let-down this country has proved: capriciously disregarding the activities of the nation's celebrities in order to gawp like mindless idiots at Olympians and Paralympians just because they are performing almost superhuman feats of skill, endurance and bravery. Are the British really that flighty? Is that all it takes to distract attention from the latest important updates about Alex \"The Reidinator\" Reid's engagement to former Celebrity Big Brother star Chantelle Houghton? It is apparently \"strained\" thanks to her inability to come to terms with his cross-dressing alter ego \"Roxanne\", yet the country seems more interested in watching Oscar Pistorius, a man who, as far as LiS can tell, doesn't have any cross-dressing alter ego to speak of.</p> <p>Do we really believe these Olympians are superior to, say, fiance of Kym Marsh and former Hollyoaks star Jamie Lomas, who spent his stag night handcuffed to a dwarf dressed as Mr&#xa0;T? Let's see how many gold medals Jessica Ennis wins while handcuffed to a dwarf dressed as Mr T before we start talking about where the real talent lies. And does no one have any interest in OK! magazine's brilliant scoop about Kerry Katona's relationship with Jonny Laidler? KERRY AND JONNY TALK WEDDINGS AND BABIES screams the headline, which turns out to refer to two sentences in her column reading: \"We're totally just friends \u2013 I bet the headlines will be that I'm getting married or I want a baby, you know what people are like.\" This, my friends, is the real gold: are we so stupefied by the interminable parade of remarkable human achievement on our screens that we've forgotten what quality journalism is?</p> <p>Priorities, people! The ratings for the new series of The X Factor are the lowest in the show's six-year history, allowing Bradley Wiggins to crow \"the Olympics, everywhere you went the country was on a high \u2026 then you see The X Factor and it's like: 'Oh God, everybody has got to put up with that all winter now'.\" A few weeks ago, even <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/lostinshowbiz/2012/aug/09/olympians-will-not-destroy-celebrity-culture\" title=\"\">this column turned quisling in the hands of Peter Robinson</a>, spouting some guff about how athletes represented \"a whole new celebrity stratum\". LiS can only apologise and assure you that normal service is resumed: it is meaningless stories about bizarre hollow orange carapaces, bafflingly elevated to stardom for no discernible reason, from here on in.</p> <p>Thank God the fightback finally seems to have begun in earnest. The scripted reality show stars and former X Factor finalists are massing, the spirit of D-day in their hearts, a rousing chorus of We Shall Not Be Moved on their lips, their spirits bolstered by the front cover of yesterday's Sun, which rightly chose to ignore the Paralympics opening ceremony in favour of the real headline news that Cheryl Cole had sustained a nosebleed in Los Angeles.</p> <p>And what resources this hastily formed army has at its disposal! LiS can barely type, so thrilled is it to disclose what's coming up. A new television series in which Jedward not only \"show funny YouTube clips from around the world\" but also, they proudly announce, wear \"clothes that no one has seen us wear before\"! My Fair Kerry, a \"scripted comedy reality show\" featuring \"crazy antics\" as David Gest attempts to teach the former Atomic Kitten star etiquette! The scintillating rumour that former The Only Way is Essex star Lauren Goodger is to star in the next series of&#xa0;Dancing on Ice! LiS gazes awestruck at this array of glittering jewels: what price the trivial diversions of the Olympic Park now?</p>",
  "<p>During the inspiring (and often moving) <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2012/aug/30/paralympic-games-opening-ceremony-britain\" title=\"\">opening ceremony</a> of the London 2012 Paralympics, news began to filter through on Twitter that <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/2012/aug/29/border-agency-eu-ban-university?intcmp=239\" title=\"\">London Metropolitan University (LMU) had had its status as a Highly Trusted Sponsor for international student visas revoked</a> by the UK Border Agency. Some might say it was a cynical attempt by government to bury bad news at a time of national celebration. Rumours had been rife that an announcement was due since the <a href=\"http://www.londonmet.ac.uk/news/news-releases/2012-press-releases/response-in-regard-to-the-sunday-times-story-on-london-metropolitan-universitys-highly-trusted-status.cfm\" title=\"\">Sunday Times broke the story on 26 August</a> \u2013 even before London Met had been told.</p> <p>The irony of timing was a poignant reminder of our nation's contradictory mindsets. On the one hand, London has greeted the Games in a way few had predicted. Athletes, officials and spectators from around the world have been welcomed to what may be the world's most multicultural city. We are told it is the first time in Olympic history that the host city boasts a permanent resident from all 204 competing nations. Games makers received a roar of appreciation at the London 2012 closing ceremony, and their contribution was surely key to the joyous atmosphere evident in the capital during those remarkable days in July and August.</p> <p>Meanwhile, another viewpoint is reflected in the embattled islander approach of the Home Office, resistant to appeals from chancellors, vice-chancellors, sector-wide organisations and concerned citizens that international students should be removed from the migration statistics since the vast majority leave the country after graduation.</p> <p>Arguments have fallen on deaf ears, whether due to the significant contribution international students make to our economy, the soft political influence international alumni spread around the world or the growing 'internationalisation' agenda. Universities have been encouraged by David Willetts to develop branch campuses and other partnerships overseas \u2013 a case of 'yes' to internationalisation, but only at a distance?</p> <p>The revoking of LMU's licence for international students will have a number of far-reaching consequences, not least financial. What looks like a political decision, or even scapegoating of LMU to satisfy right-wing immigration rage, will have unforeseen consequences across the university and for the individual students within it.</p> <p>Coming just days before the start of term, the inpact on incoming students will be considerable. Some will have worked hard to secure funding and support to achieve their dream of studying abroad, others will have packed and sent things ahead, some may even have arrived in the UK ready for the start of term. As for those already on courses, their search for another university will be complicated by the ease or difficulty with which existing credits are recognised by an equivalent course in a university that is still accepting applications.</p> <p>These are the immediate difficulties for international students but let us also spare a thought for the depleted international environment which domestic and EU students, as well as staff, will face on their arrival or return to LMU.</p> <p>One important aspect of internationalising higher education is to encourage home students to see beyond a parochial worldview, to open their minds to alternative perspectives and ways of thinking, to challenge stereotypes and confront prejudice, to become 'global citizens'. Nationality, race, religion, gender, sexual orientation, physical or mental disabilities have all been used as forms of discrimination or a basis for exploitation and persecution. Foreign students can support our efforts to create a better world by helping us to confront preconceptions and bigotry.</p> <p>Universities have a key role to play in providing a crucible for debate and for large-scale contact with difference or 'otherness', opportunities which can be employed and extended through an inclusive curriculum which incorporates internationalisation alongside other aspects of equality and diversity. How will inclusivity across the curriculum be affected by this perverse decision?</p> <p>The Paralympics opening ceremony reminded us that nationality is only one aspect of diversity, alongside disability. In the words which rang around the stadium, \"I am somebody, I am what I am\", we were encouraged to see people not as able-bodied or disabled, but as individuals. Worryingly, the government seems to have failed to consider this nuance in students, whether home or international. That the news should arrive at a time when diversity was being celebrated to such stunning effect makes the paradox even more poignant.</p> <p><em>Elspeth Jones is emerita professor of the internationalisation of higher education at Leeds Metropolitan University and has published widely, including the edited collection, Internationalisation and the Student Voice</em></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by </strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/guardian-professional\" title=\"\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

  "<p>Chad Harbach's highly praised debut The Art of Fielding is competing with an Iraq veteran's \"raw, visceral\" novel about the impact of war and a journalist's account of the time she spent living in a Mumbai slum on the longlist for the Guardian first book award.</p> <p>Eleven titles have been chosen for the \u00a310,000 prize, from Mary Costello's collection of Irish short stories The China Factory, released by small publisher Stinging Fly Press, to Harbach's novel, which follows the story of baseball player Henry Skrimshander and arrives garlanded with praise from Jonathan Franzen and John Irving. For the second year running, Guardian readers nominated a title, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/aug/13/sarah-jackson-pelt-guardian-first-book-award\" title=\"\">this year choosing Sarah Jackson's \"assured and mysterious\" poetry collection Pelt</a>.</p> <p>Publishers submitted 94 titles for the prize, and judges Ahdaf Soueif, Kate Summerscale, Jeanette Winterson and Guardian deputy editor Katharine Viner, chaired by Guardian Review editor Lisa Allardice, called in many more. Army veteran Kevin Powers was chosen for The Yellow Birds, a novel about a soldier's return home after a year in Iraq, Patrick Flanery for his book about the fictional great South African writer Clare Wald, Absolution, and Charlotte Rogan for The Lifeboat, in which an ocean liner capsizes in 1914, stranding passengers in a lifeboat for three long weeks.</p> <p>\"In fiction we've got novels like The Art of Fielding, a popular and critical hit earlier this year, alongside lesser known titles such as The China Factory,\" said Allardice. \"One criticism of new writing is often that it doesn't engage with contemporary events or recent history, but something like The Yellow Birds, a very raw, visceral account of the Iraq war written by a young soldier, shows this can be done.</p> <p>\"Judging a prize like this, you do very quickly become aware of trends and foibles. Semi-autobiographical novels seems to have given way to whimsical child narrators. The one on our longlist which might seem to fall into this category is Kerry Hudson's novel Tony Hogan Brought Me an Ice-cream Float Before He Stole My Ma, but the voice is so fresh and the writing so energetic that we felt it needed to be included.\"</p> <p>Four non-fiction titles make this year's line-up: New Yorker journalist Katherine Boo's Behind the Beautiful Forevers, her account of <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/books/2012/02/behind-the-beautiful-forevers-surviving-and-living-in-the-slums-of-mumbai.html\" title=\"\">her time living in the Annawadi slum</a> built on rubbish dumps at the edge of Mumbai airport; Susan Cain's Quiet, about the power of introverts, Faramerz Dabhoiwala's The Origins of Sex; and Lindsey Hilsum's Sandstorm, about the Libyan revolution.</p> <p>\"The non-fiction we've chosen is wide-ranging both geographically, from Mumbai to Libya, and across subjects from sex to silence,\" said Allardice, who is joined on the judging panel by authors including Jeanette Winterson, Kate Summerscale and Ahdaf Soueif. \"We've tried to put together a lively list which reflects the diversity of first books this year.\"</p> <p>Reading groups across the country, run in partnership with Waterstones, will now help the panel pick a shortlist, which will be announced in late October.

  "<p>Ministers and universities have joined forces to help legitimate students affected by London Metropolitan University being <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2012/aug/30/london-metropolitan-university-international-students\" title=\"\">stripped of its powers to teach and recruit students from outside the European Union</a>.</p> <p>London Met's vice-chancellor said the action threatened the UK university \"brand\", but the <a href=\"http://www.ukba.homeoffice.gov.uk/sitecontent/newsarticles/2012/august/28-LMU-revoked1\" title=\"\">UK Border Agency</a> insisted that problems over the enforcement of visa rules lay with one university, not the whole sector.</p> <p>The government and university chiefs have begun trying to help up to 2,700 students from abroad affected by the UKBA ruling which means London Met is no longer able to teach even its current international students. It is the first UK university to be stripped of this licence.</p> <p>Those affected need to find alternative courses elsewhere and get new visas within 60 days of receiving \"curtailment letters\", or leave Britain voluntarily. Otherwise they will be removed from the country.</p> <p>The Home Office clarified that the 60-day deadline would only begin once the letters had been delivered to individual students. The Guardian understands it could be weeks before the notices, which are a legal necessity, are sent out in order to give genuine students more time to relocate.</p> <p>The government has also set up a taskforce consisting of the UKBA, the Department of Business, Universities UK, the higher education funding body HEFCE, and the National Union of Students to deal with the situation. It is expected to have its first meeting on Friday to attempt to go through every London Met international student file to identify legitimate cases and help them enrol at other universities.</p> <p>About 290,000 students and dependent visas are issued by the UKBA each year, and 110,000 extensions to such visas.</p> <p>Malcolm Gillies, London Met's head, said the loss of its ability to authorise visas \"sends a fear through many universities in a way that I think is going to be detrimental to their confidence as higher education institutions, but also the projection of brand UK abroad.\"</p> <p>He said responses from other universities included \"commiseration, worry, anger, but also a feeling of probably, 'well thank God it wasn't us this time'. I think that shows the nervousness that many in the sector have, especially at a time when clearly government policy is changing but also when the [UKBA] guidelines have been changing very rapidly.\"</p> <p>Gillies has warned that the future of the university, which has 30,000 students, is at risk because the punishment for its immigration failures will leave a \u00a330m hole in its annual budget, a fifth of the total. The UK's lucrative higher education business in teaching international students involves about 300,000 students and is worth an estimated \u00a35bn a year to the economy.</p> <p>About 500 private higher education colleges have already lost their power to recruit abroad following crackdowns on bogus students.</p> <p>The immigration minister Damian Green said London Met had displayed a \"serious systemic failure\" to know whether its students had the right to be in the UK. He denied making the university a political football over immigration controls and insisted such action would not be replicated across the university sector.</p> <p>Green said people entering Britain as students but seeking work exploited one of the biggest loopholes in the immigration system.</p> <p>UKBA audits of London Met found that more than a quarter of cases sampled had no leave to remain in Britain. There was also no proof that a significant proportion of international students had satisfactory English. In more than half of the cases the university did not know whether students were attending lectures.</p> <p>Green said \"any of these three breaches would be serious\" and that it was important to ensure \"not just private colleges but universities obey the law\".</p> <p>\"What we found here is a serious systemic failure where it appears that the university doesn't have the capacity to be a proper sponsor [of international students] and to have confidence that the students have the right to be here in the first place,\" Green said.</p> <p>University funders and leaders said the first priority was to sort out the future of genuine students.

Every international student looks crushed after the north London university became the first in the UK to be stripped by the Home Office of its ability to sponsor foreign learners.</p> <p>What these students fear most is that if they don't, by some miracle, get themselves a place at a new university within the next few months, they will be removed from the country.</p> <p>Cecil Ezeja, 21, from Enugu state in Nigeria was the great hope for his family. Now he dreads the moment when he has to tell his family that his year of studying electronic communications and the \u00a310,080 they paid has come to naught.</p> <p>\"I can't call them, I don't want to cause any heartbreak \u2026 I want to visit some other unis [first] to see if they can accept me.\"</p> <p>But he knows, like many others, that the timing, just before the start of the academic year, means it is unlikely that another university will have a spare place especially since he is midway through his degree. \"If it was in June or July \u2026 I would have more time to apply for [different] uni \u2026 I'm very upset,\" he said. \"The decision was made at the wrong time. I'm not an [immigration] threat. I came to this country on 3 September 2011 and I've not broken any tiny law.</p> <p>\"I'm just a student. I come to school in the morning, I go back to my house, I go to the library. I haven't done anything \u2026 Maybe there's a few people that are breaking the law but they should investigate [them] not sack all the students, punish everybody.\"</p> <p>For Mohammed Islam, 23, from Bangladesh, it is the second time he has enrolled for a law degree and found himself at an institution suddenly stripped of its ability to host foreign students. \"I came here in 2009, to a college. When I was back home, I don't know which place was a college, because on the website they're all saying they're really good, everything is OK. But when you are not [there] in person, you can not understand what is going on.</p> <p>\"So I came to a college and they had the same problem, they [the Home Office] cancelled their licence. I was in deep water.\"</p> <p>Now he's in deep water again. \"I have to find a new uni and if I can't I have to go back.\"</p> <p>He has not told his parents but hopes they are prepared to stump up another \u00a310,000 to pay for his degree.</p> <p>\"I have a dream,\" he said. \"To finish my LLB from a good university from the UK. This is my main dream.\"</p> <p>Inside the university help centre, the phones are ringing off the hook. Ursula Rehman, from Dubai, looks desperate.</p> <p>She has just one semester to go to complete her degree in biomedical sciences and is not having any luck moving to another university.</p> <p>\"I've spoken to so many universities now and they say, 'oh we don't do transfers, we don't do this, or we'll have to charge you this much'.\" She's exasperated. Everyone, she says, is worried and scared.</p> <p>\"I've got so many friends who come from really poor backgrounds. And they come here so that they have a degree and they go back and get a really good job, because they've got a degree from London UK. And now \u2026\"</p> <p>Tellingly, she has not told her parents either. \"I don't want them to panic, and I hope they don't hear it from somewhere.\"</p> <p>She blames herself for the whole debacle. Rehman says she should have accepted one of the other four university places she was offered three years ago.</p> <p>\"I know its my fault, but I'm really getting tense now.\" Staring down at the floor she adds, \"why did I come here?\".</p> <p>It is a very good question.</p>",
  "<p>So many Indians apply to study at London Metropolitan that a few years ago the university opened recruitment offices in Delhi and Chennai.</p> <p>But on Thursday both branches had been shut down. In the Delhi towerblock where the university had an outpost as recently as 31 July, a financial consulting firm had stuck a print-out of its own logo over the Met's and the university's letterbox in the basement was overflowing.</p> <p>Across the hallway from the old offices on the seventh floor of the Ashoka Estate, Puneet Soin said he was shocked to hear about the UK Border Agency (UKBA) decision. \"If they can take away London Met's licence, they can take away any other university's licence,\" said Soin, who manages the Indian office of Study In UK (SIUK), a commercial firm which helps students win places at UK universities and colleges. His staff had been fielding calls from anxious Indian students worried they could be deported from Britain, or not get beyond passport control at Heathrow.</p> <p>SIUK has 10 wannabe students who were hoping to enrol at London Met in the next few weeks, paying annual fees of \u00a310,000 or more for the privilege; they are now hurriedly trying to find places at other universities in the UK capital. It's proving surprisingly easy.</p> <p>\"Literally five minutes before you arrived I had an email from a rival London university offering to fast track the application of anyone who had been planning to come to London Met,\" said Soin at teatime on Thursday. He wasn't prepared to name the sender.</p> <p>Soin, himself an engineering graduate of Warwick University, regularly used to dispatch students across the hall to talk to recruiters from London Met, and said he had a number of meetings with Mark Bickerton, director of the university's international office.</p> <p>\"Before this UKBA stuff, Mark told me that they were closing down the India offices to save money. He said they wanted to spend it on scholarships for Indian students,\" said Soin.</p> <p>He claimed Bickerton wrote him an email just last week saying he was confident the university would win back its licence to teach and recruit international students, and that SIUK should simply encourage applicants to defer until the February 2013 intake.</p> <p>Soin said it was well known that many Indians applying to UK universities had no intention of studying. \"We divide the market into two categories: the university market for genuine students and the immigration market,\" he said, stressing that his company only worked with the former. \"It's easy to tell someone who just wants to get the visa,\" he said. \"They are the ones who turn up and say: 'Get me into a UK university, here's my budget,' without specifying which university or which course they fancy.\"</p>",

They face removal from the UK unless they can find somewhere to study within 60 days.</p> <p>\"This sends a fear through many universities in a way that I think is going to be detrimental to their confidence as higher education institutions but also the projection of brand UK abroad,\" he told the Guardian.</p> <p>Responses from other universities included \"commiseration, worry, anger, but also a feeling of probably, 'well thank God it wasn't us this time',\" Gillies said. \"I think that shows the nervousness that many in the sector have, especially at a time when clearly government policy is changing but also when the <a href=\"http:///www.ukba.homeoffice.gov.uk/\" title=\"\">UK Border Agency (UKBA)</a> guidelines have been changing very rapidly.\"</p> <p>Gillies has warned that the future of the 30,000-student university is at risk. Five hundred private higher education colleges have already lost their power to recruit abroad following crackdowns on bogus students.</p> <p>The immigration minister, Damian Green, said London Met had displayed a \"serious systemic failure\" to know whether its students had the right to be in the UK in the first place. He denied making the university a political football over immigration controls and insisted such action would not be replicated across the university sector.</p> <p>The UK's lucrative higher education business in international students involves about 300,000 students and is worth an estimated \u00a35bn a year to the economy.</p> <p>Green, speaking on the BBC's Today programme, said people entering Britain as students but seeking work exploited \"one of the biggest loopholes in the immigration system\".</p> <p>UKBA audits of London Met found that more than a quarter of cases sampled had no leave to remain in Britain. There was also no proof that \"a significant proportion\" of international students had satisfactory English. In more than half of cases, the university did not know whether students were turning up to lectures or not.</p> <p>Green said \"any of these three breaches would be serious\" and that it was important to ensure \"not just private colleges but universities obey the law\".</p> <p>\"What we found here is a serious systemic failure where it appears that the university doesn't have the capacity to be a proper sponsor [of international students] and to have confidence that the students have the right to be here in the first place,\" Green said.</p> <p>University funders and leaders said the first priority was to sort out the future of genuine students. It is understood the <a href=\"http://www.hefce.ac.uk/\" title=\"\">Higher Education Funding Council for England</a> and London Met have been in talks for weeks over the crisis, which began when the UKBA suspended the university's right to be a \"highly trusted sponsor\" of students on 16 July.</p> <p>Gillies said the decision, which was taken because of what he called a \"small minority\" among international students not having \"accurate documentation to remain in the UK\", will leave a \u00a330m hole in London Met's finances \u2013 nearly a fifth of its annual budget. The crisis had already cost \"way over\" \u00a310m. Gillies said it would also cost the wider London economy \u00a375m.</p> <p>Gillies said 20-30 universities were already offering to help resettle students. \"It's hard to think of a time that could have been worse [for this decision] because the suspension has done such damage already to our requirement for this coming year.\"</p> <p>Efforts to find alternative places for affected students could prove difficult \u2013 even if they have appropriate visas. Most universities will have finalised their international student numbers for the new academic year.</p> <p>The university may also face legal action from students who have paid up to \u00a313,500 a year for uncompleted courses.</p> <p>London Met will not be able to take extra students from Britain and the EU to make up the numbers and shore up its finances either. In England, for example, due to the need to control the costs of student loans, the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills sets a limit on the number of home and EU students that can be recruited. Given the high demand from home students, universities recruit right up to that limit, and then determine the number of places available to non-EU international students.</p> <p>Prof Eric Thomas, the president of Universities UK, said the organisation was committed to eliminating any abuse of the student visa system, but that there were alternative ways of addressing UKBA's concerns and revocation of a university's licence should only be a decision of last resort. \"We will be working with UKBA to ensure that compliance issues can be addressed in a more constructive way in the future,\" Thomas said.</p> <p>Syed Rumman, vice-president for education for London Met's student union, accused the government of \"chucking students' lives into the bin\". Nine of the 10 union officers, including all five sabbatical officers, are international students, and like others face administrative removal in 60 days if they do not find other higher education institutions to offer them a place.</p> <p>Liam Burns, president of the National Union of Students, said: \"It is disgusting that international students continue to be used as a political football by politicians who seem either incapable of understanding, or are simply uncaring about, the impact of their decisions on individuals, universities and the UK economy.</p> <p>\"This decision will create panic and potential heartbreak for students not just at London Met but also all around the country.\"</p> <p>Geoffrey Alderman of the Association of Independent Higher Education Providers said: \"No one is gloating over this.

John McCain took the stage to lament the wars he didn't get to start after losing the 2008 presidential election, fervently hoping Mitt Romney will make up for lost time. Republicans you have never heard of enjoyed their 15 minutes of fame, though it often seemed much longer.</p> <p>In the early going, the only positive moments were an artfully done (even if foreign policy-free) video tribute to Ron Paul, a cautious but well-received address by his son Rand Paul, and George HW Bush doing an impression of <a href=\"http://www.danacarvey.net/\">Dana Carvey</a> doing an impression of him. (If you're curious, the 41st president nailed it.)</p> <p>But as the program moved toward prime time, the speakers picked up the pace. Mike Huckabee started slow, as if Romney's censors had edited out the former Arkansas governor's charm. But his attack on the Obama administration's HHS contraceptive mandate was powerful, and his attempt to rally evangelicals behind a Mormon and a Catholic was sincere. Condoleezza Rice gave one of the strongest speeches of the convention. Susana Martinez, the first-term governor of New Mexico, was likeable, down-to-earth, and impressive.</p> <p>Paul Ryan, nevertheless, remained the star of the show. Ryan is still honing his skills as a big event speaker and attack dog, but he did a good job delivering some of the most effective and specific anti-Obama barbs heard yet in Tampa.</p> <p>\"College grads shouldn't have to live out their 20s in childhood bedrooms, staring up at fading Obama posters,\" he zinged. \"There is no shortage of words from the White House. What is missing is leadership from the White House,\" was another good Ryan line. Finally, on Barack Obama's tendency to blame his predecessors: \"The man assumed office nearly four years ago. Isn't it time he assumed responsibility?\"</p> <p>You could quibble with some facts: the GM plant Ryan mentioned actually closed down before Obama took office, though Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker has pointed out that the president said he would save it. The line itself serves as a reminder that Ryan himself voted for the auto bailout. But overall, Ryan did what he needed to: he galvanized the conservative base without frightening swing voters, all while amplifying the ticket's attack on Obama's economic policies.</p> <p>The biggest blunder of the night was spending so much time reliving George W Bush's presidency. Bush himself appeared in an innocuous video. McCain channeled Bush on steroids. And for all Rice's rhetorical talent, she was essentially promoting warmed-over Bushism and a revisionist take on the 43rd president's \"forward strategy of freedom\", which didn't grapple with the general failure of his foreign policy in the Middle East.</p> <p>Romney and Ryan should want to get clear of Bush.</p> <p><em>James Antle is editor of the Daily Caller News Foundation</em></p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/michael-cohen\">Michael Cohen</a>: 'Ryan's speech was a good example of just how far the GOP has strayed from the truth'</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395422721\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Observer/Columnist/Columnists/2011/8/6/1312655160523/Michael-Cohen-003.jpg\" alt=\"Michael Cohen\" width=\"140\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Michael Cohen Photograph: Observer</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Listening to Paul Ryan's vice-presidential speech this evening, I think I came within an inch of having a full-blown aneurysm. Never have I heard a major political speech so brazenly and stunningly dishonest. Others will want to talk about Ryan's strong performance and the wild crowd reaction from the assembled GOP delegates, but I'll just spend a few minutes chronicling his cavalcade of lies.</p> <p>Ryan began with a doozy: implicitly blaming Obama for the closing of a General Motors plant in his town of Janesville, Wisconsin. First, that plant was closed when George W Bush was still president. (In fact, here's a <a href=\"http://paulryan.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=200270\">press release</a> from Ryan decrying the closure in June 2008, six months before Obama took office.) So, in a sense, Ryan was complaining that Obama didn't re-open it \u2013 a fairly amazing charge from a candidate and a party that have spent the last two days <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/aug/29/they-built-that-republicans-big-lie\">decrying the role of government in the private sector</a>. It's an even more amazing when you consider that Ryan's running-mate opposed the auto bailout and even penned an op-ed titled \"Let Detroit Go Bankrupt.\"</p> <p>Ryan then quickly pivoted to the stimulus, which he described as \"a case of political patronage, corporate welfare, and cronyism at their worst \u2026 What did the taxpayers get out of the Obama stimulus? More debt. That money wasn't just spent and wasted \u2013 it was borrowed, spent, and wasted.\"</p> <p>As <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/aug/27/why-obama-should-run-success-stimulus\">I wrote about a few days ago here</a>, what the stimulus did provide taxpayers with was 2.5m jobs and an economic boost out of the worst downturn since the Great Depression. This is not to mention all the long-term investments in healthcare, transportation, infrastructure and energy innovation. To argue that the stimulus was <em>wasted</em> is just a breathtaking bit of dishonesty.</p> <p>Then came Ryan's attack on Medicare. He lied about Obama taking money out of the program to pay for Obamacare. He lied about the fact that <em>his</em> budget has the exact same $716bn in cuts for which he attacked Obama. He vowed to protect and strengthen Medicare and honor its promise \u2013 even though his budget would end Medicare's federal guarantee and turn government-supported seniors' healthcare into a voucher program.</p> <p>And perhaps most amazingly, Ryan criticized Obama for creating a bipartisan debt commission and ignoring its recommendations \u2013 recommendations that Ryan voted against <em>as a member of the commission</em>.</p> <p>I could go on. The GOP has done more than create an <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/aug/29/they-built-that-republicans-big-lie\">alternate reality</a>; they have built it on a host of political lies, misstatements and untruths. Ryan's speech was a good example of just how far the GOP has strayed from the truth \u2013 and of how debased our political discourse has become.</p> <p><em>Michael Cohen is a US political columnist for the Observer and Guardian</em></p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/jim-geraghty\">Jim Geraghty</a>: 'The bar is set extremely high for Romney this Thursday night'</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395422723\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Global/content/icons/2012/1/11/1326298456752/jimgeraghty_140x140.jpg\" alt=\"Jim Geraghty\" width=\"140\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>It was a strangely imbalanced night in terms of quality: the early speakers were barely noticed by the conventioneers \u2013 even John McCain, who had some strong critiques of Obama's foreign policy \u2013 and worsened with a speech by near-veep Senator Rob Portman of Ohio (utterly forgettable) and other near-veep Tim Pawlenty (a seemingly endless stream of bad jokes, landing with one THUD after another). About halfway into Governor Mike Huckabee's remarks, it looked like the evening would be a cavalcade of bad-to-mediocre speeches, wondering if we needed even a third night to this abbreviated convention.</p> <p>And then Huckabee got better, with some funny lines and some warm lines \u2013 best was, \"I care less about where Mitt Romney goes to church than where he's going to take this country.\" But the unexpected grand slam was Condi Rice, who at first appeared to be speaking to check a few boxes: foreign policy speech, check; acknowledgement of the Bush administration, check. Instead, Rice offered perhaps the best speech on the country's problems since Lehman collapsed in late 2008, an acknowledgement that the country had stumbled badly and been bruised but was more than capable of picking itself back up and returning to greatness. It was a speech with vision, and the best of the convention.</p> <p>So, the bar was set high for Paul Ryan; yet he cleared it \u2013 with a distinctly different, personable, more intimate style. He started out shaky, but watchers observed that the turning point was discussing his mother \u2013 and then he seemed to relax, and recognize that he knew the story he wanted to tell. Some funny lines will stay with us \u2013 the fading Obama poster on the unemployed grad's childhood bedroom wall \u2013 and I suspect all of the \"granny-killing extremist\" charges are going to have a much tougher time sticking, because Ryan seems so normal: even-keeled and warm and pleasant.</p> <p>Wednesday night left two thoughts: one, the bar is set extremely high for Romney this Thursday night (remember, he's being introduced by Senator Marco Rubio, another one of the GOP's best speakers); and then \u2026 how do Democrats respond to this? Can they go negative and focus on tax returns and contraception and some Seamus jokes after the Republican message has been so focused, realistic, optimistic and bold?</p> <p><em>Jim Geraghty is a contributing editor to the National Review</em></p>",

Among the NGOs expelled were Oxfam, Care and Save the Children.</p> <p>The two men remain at large and Darfur largely disappeared from the news pages as the region lapsed into an uneasy calm \u2013 until this year. More than 700 people have been killed in clashes between rebels and government troops as well as in tribal unrest and criminal incidents, more than for the whole of 2011, according to UN peacekeepers.</p> <p>South Darfur state and its capital Nyala, the largest town in the region, have seen an upsurge of violence in recent weeks. Last month, government troops killed at least eight people during a demonstration in Nyala over price rises, prompting the <a href=\"http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=42619&amp;Cr=Darfur&amp;Cr1=\" title=\"\">UN to call for an independent investigation into apparent excessive use of force</a>.</p> <p>High prices have been a knock-on effect of the breakdown in relations between Sudan and the newly formed state of South Sudan over oil shipment fees. In January, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jan/26/south-sudan-shuts-oil-wells\" title=\"\">South Sudan took the dramatic step of shutting down oil production</a> because of a disagreement over how much it should pay for the use of Sudan's pipelines. The move has had a drastic economic effect on both countries, with Khartoum and Juba forced to curtail public spending as revenues dry up, although there have been signs that the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/04/sudan-south-sudan-oil-row\" title=\"\">two sides may be moving towards a resolution of the oil row</a>.</p> <p>Tension between Sudan and South Sudan has had political repercussions in Darfur. <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-18971171\" title=\"\">Rebel groups in Darfur</a> have linked up with rebels in the Sudanese states of Blue Nile and South Kordofan. Sudan has accused South Sudan of supporting the Darfur rebel groups, a charge the Juba rejects, although it is an open secret it is backing the rebels operating across the border in Blue Nile and South Kordofan.</p> <p>Unamid, the world's largest peacekeeping force, consisting of 16,200 military personnel, 2,310 police and 17 police units of up to 140 personnel each, holds the ring in Darfur. But the UN-AU force, costing $1.5bn a year, has been <a href=\"http://www.smallarmssurveysudan.org/facts-figures-arms-flows-UNMIS-UNAMID.php\" title=\"\">criticised as undermanned and underequipped for its primarily role of protecting civilians</a>.</p> <p>Unamid, however, says 178,000 people returned home in West Darfur state between January 2011 and March this year, which wouldn't have happened if security hadn't improved. But although the situation may have improved in West Darfur state, other areas in Darfur remain problematical.</p> <p>M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res (MSF) had to drastically scale down its operations since May <a href=\"http://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/publications/article.cfm?id=6037&amp;cat=briefing-documents\" title=\"\">in the remote Jebel Si area of North Darfur</a>, where it operated a hospital, five health posts and a mobile clinic. As the only health facilities in this mountainous area, they served a population of 100,000, as well as about 10,000 nomads. The majority of MSF's patients in Jebel Si are women and children. But increasing obstacles have made its work more difficult. Authorisation for shipments of drugs or medical supplies stopped in September 2011, and MSF encountered growing difficulties obtaining work and travel permits for its staff.</p> <p>\"For us it's a medical catastrophe,\" said MSF's Alberto Cristina. \"Emergency cases will die on the road trying to get to hospital.\" The nearest ministry of health facilities are several hours drive away, but insecurity in the area, as well as mountain terrain and poor roads, make access extremely difficult.</p> <p><a href=\"http://practicalaction.org/darfur-3\" title=\"\">Practical Action, the only international NGO that works outside refugee camps in Darfur</a>, has managed to maintain a presence because almost all of its employees are Sudanese. Working through community organisations, particularly women's groups, it has helped to bridge the divide between pastoralists and farmers by demarcating migration routes for cattle.</p> <p>\"We are still able to access areas through local partners,\" said Liam Morgan, a programme development officer, based in North Darfur. \"We have a good relationship with the government and have been there for 20 odd years.\"</p>",

  "<p>The latest <a href=\"http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/migration1/migration-statistics-quarterly-report/august-2012/msqr.html\" title=\"\">migration statistics</a> demonstrate again, as they do every quarter, the folly of the government's target to reduce net migration to less than 100,000 a year. The statistics show immigration to the UK of 566,000 in 2011 and emigration of 350,000, meaning that net migration (the difference between immigration and emigration) was 216,000.</p> <p>The figures do suggest a small decline in net migration to the UK (down from 252,000 in 2010, though the fall is not statistically significant) \u2013 the combination of recession and immigration policy changes may be starting to have an impact.</p> <p>But the statistics also show the government remains a long way from its goal. More up-to-date visa data suggests further declines in immigration are on their way \u2013 student visas issued in the year to June 2012 were down 21% compared with the previous 12 months, and the next quarter's data will likely show further falls. But even reductions on this scale seem unlikely to be enough to get net migration under 100,000, not least because <a href=\"http://www.ippr.org/publication/55/8997/international-students-and-net-migration-in-the-uk\" title=\"\">student migration</a> is mostly short term, which means reduced immigration now leads to reduced emigration later, drastically reducing the impact on net migration after the first year or two.</p> <p>If the target is missed, public confidence in the immigration system will be further undermined, making the politics of migration in the UK even more ugly than it is already. This should be a major concern for anyone interested in encouraging a moderate and mainstream debate on immigration, or in discouraging the extremism that too often characterises the discussion.</p> <p>The more immediate problem, though, is that the government is making progress towards its target only at significant economic cost.</p> <p>Ministers would like the public to believe that the target can be met by <a href=\"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/politics/4505102/Theresa-May-Lets-close-door-on-illegal-immigrants-and-fake-marriages.html\" title=\"\">clamping down on sham marriages and bogus students</a>. (In this context, the timing of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2012/aug/30/london-metropolitan-university-international-students?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">the announcement about London Metropolitan University</a> has raised eyebrows in some quarters.) It is, of course, right to root out abuse of the visa system, but the truth is that the government's net migration target will only be met by drastic reductions in the number of legitimate migrants who come to the UK from outside the EU.</p> <p>In practice, that means reducing the numbers of skilled migrants who come to the UK to work hard, pay taxes, help businesses grow and staff our public services; and of fee-paying students who support our colleges and universities and provide jobs for thousands. It also means <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/jun/08/immigration-rules-couples-stark-choice\" title=\"\">restricting the right of UK citizens to marry someone from overseas</a>.</p> <p>For ministers focused on the net migration target, the deportation or refusal of thousands of legitimate students at London Metropolitan University is a happy side effect of a decision that \u2013 we must assume \u2013 has been driven by a genuine concern about the enforcement of visa rules. A drop of 21% or more in international student numbers may be welcome news for the immigration minister, but it is potentially catastrophic for the UK's highly successful education sector.</p> <p>It's important to talk about numbers in the immigration debate. But establishing one number (net migration) as the be-all-and-end-all leads to bad policy, and squeezes out debate about the issues that worried people about immigration in first place \u2013 jobs, public services, culture and community.</p> <p>The government may yet <a href=\"http://www.ippr.org/articles/56/9194/net-migration--a-target-they-wish-theyd-never-set\" title=\"\">regret setting the net migration target</a>, but for the moment at least it seems committed to it. There are some promising signs <a href=\"http://www.ippr.org/articles/56/9330/labour-is-developing-the-right-instincts-on-immigration\" title=\"\">Labour is taking a more nuanced approach</a> to immigration policy and politics. But in responding to the new figures, it must avoid the temptation to play the net migration numbers game and be willing to talk about immigration's real impacts \u2013 positive and negative \u2013 on the economy, on public services and in communities across the UK.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Why has London Metropolitan University lost its right to recruit international students from outside the EU?</strong></p> <p>Because of what the government has called \"serious systemic failure\" in its monitoring of its international student body. It says UK Border Agency checks suggest that in more than a quarter of the cases it sampled, the students did not have permission to stay in the country, a \"significant proportion\" did not have sufficient English and there was no proof that half of those sampled were turning up to lectures.</p> <p><strong>How many students are affected?</strong></p> <p>The university says around 2,700 already there or planning to go to London Met are directly affected, but the crisis could affect the entire future of the university with its 30,000 students and 2,000 staff.</p> <p><strong>Will students have to leave the country?</strong></p> <p>Those already on courses and with valid visas have 60 days to find another course at another university or college. If they fail to do so they must leave voluntarily or be \"administratively removed\". The 60-day clock for each student starts ticking when he or she receives a letter from the UK Border Agency. These are already being sent out.</p> <p>Any existing student without valid permission to remain in this country \u2013 and the UK Border Agency says its checks found some \u2013 do not get the same 60-day leeway.</p> <p>However, students who were about to come to the UK to take up their studies with what were until Wednesday valid visas will now have them cancelled. If they then travel to the UK, they will be refused entry. It is uncertain how many of these potential students there are. The university said it had confirmed places for about 300 before its licence was suspended on 16 July but it is not clear how many of these have been given visas.</p> <p><strong>How easy will it be to find new places elsewhere for international students already at London Met?</strong></p> <p>Not at all. Most universities have fixed their numbers of international students by now. Then there is the question of matching course requirements to the academic work any London Met international student has already done. Then the student has to apply again for a valid visa. If they don't have one within 60 days from Wednesday they have to leave.</p> <p><strong>Why is the future of the university potentially at risk?</strong></p> <p>The university says this decision blows a \u00a330m hole in its budget \u2013 taking away nearly a fifth of it. The university calls the UKBA action a \"disproportionate\" response which could have \"severely damaging\" implications for its other students. It could not make up the shortfall through taking in more home students even if enough wanted to go there. Funding from the government depends on limits it sets for the number of home students each university can take.</p> <p>Severe financial problems at the university have already meant huge changes at London Met since 2009, including a 70% cut on the number of courses it offers.</p> <p><strong>What does this mean for Britain's reputation abroad?</strong></p> <p>There is some anxiety across the higher education sector. There are about 300,000 non-EU students at university in Britain at any one time, worth an estimated \u00a35bn a year to the economy. Quite apart from that, the international flavour of campuses, not just in seminar rooms and lecture halls, is regarded as a vital part of the university experience.</p> <p>The UKBA says it has been working with London Met since March to remedy its shortcomings. Three other universities have previously had their licence to recruit students suspended and soon put matters right. It also says 500 higher education colleges have had their licences revoked. It is unable to easily estimate the number of student visas that have been revoked as a result or replacement ones issued where students have found suitably licensed alternatives.</p> <p>\"These are problems with one university, not the whole sector,\" said a spokesperson. \"British universities are among the best in the world \u2013 and Britain remains a top-class destination for top-class international students.</p> <p>\"We are doing everything possible, working with the taskforce established by the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills, to assist students that have been affected.\"</p> <p>The UK Border Agency's general advice to international students is <a href=\"http://www.ukba.homeoffice.gov.uk/visas-immigration/studying/adult-students/changes/\" title=\"\">here</a>.</p>",
  "<p>The decision to prevent London Metropolitan University<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/2012/aug/30/border-agency-international-students-threat\" title=\"\"> (LMU) from recruiting non-EU students</a> has so far been met with outrage and ominous proclamations about the institution's future. As someone who has taught there, I'm not-so-secretly pleased.</p> <p>It's not the cracking down on 'immigration' that pleases me \u2013 it's the potential it has to influence teaching and learning standards at the university.</p> <p>I've had LMU classes \u2013 particularly postgraduate modules \u2013 packed with overseas students who I have no doubt hold adequate visas. However, their English language skills I seriously doubt. LMU are clear about <a href=\"http://www.londonmet.ac.uk/international/howtoapply/entryreq.cfm\" title=\"\">their entry requirements</a> but add the proviso that good grades in English in previous stages of education may be enough.</p> <p>I'm told over and over again that it is nigh on impossible to fraudulently gain an English language qualification. That being the case, I only wonder if standards are high enough to equip non-EU students with the skills to pursue a postgraduate course of study in a second language.</p> <p>Many of these overseas students that I have encountered are seriously struggling with speaking, listening, reading and writing in English. They are also paying significantly more to be there than home or EU students, which is why they are so valuable to institutions such as LMU.</p> <p>When I've raised the issue, I am told that students have met the necessary standards for study in the UK, so there's no need to provide them with any additional support other than the usual study skills assistance to which all students are entitled. Then, when it comes to assessment, and the overseas students are graded alongside English and American students, they invariably do much, much worse.</p> <p>I have even been asked to consider raising the grades of the non-EU students \u2013 because a significant number of failures might affect recruitment in those countries; because the non-EU students have paid a lot of money to be here; because it will \"look bad\" to the powers-that-be if so many people in my class are doing badly, and they will blame me.</p> <p>There have been all sorts of changes at LMU over the past few years, which I've followed with great interest. Financial difficulties have led to selling off properties, staff redundancies, amalgamation of departments, contracting out of support services and, currently, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/may/01/womens-library-history?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">the auctioning off of the Women's Library</a>. The current vice-chancellor of the university claims that the shortfall in fees without the recruitment of non-EU students threatens LMU's very existence as we know it.</p> <p>I can't help but think, \"Well, good.\" This is not a university that is run well. The UK Border Agency basically says as much. Six months after it first flagged up that it was considering withdrawal of LMU's trusted sponsor status, it has announced that in a random audit there were problems with nearly two thirds of files.</p> <p>I'm not saying UK BA's procedures are perfect either. The House of Commons Public Accounts Committee have debated <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/2012/may/14/student-visa-rules-cost-universities\" title=\"\">the student visa issue</a> repeatedly, and the higher education institutions who have given evidence tend to concur that the system, particularly for overseas students, is rather chaotic.</p> <p>However, perhaps this instance of keeping a close eye on a trusted sponsor's record-keeping is the sign of a more organised approach for the future. I realise that higher education is now a business, and recruitment \u2013 particularly overseas recruitment \u2013 is part of that. Yet recruiting students simply for the sake of recruiting them, with no thought to academic standards nor how these people will cope with study once they arrive in the UK, is not business, it's irresponsibility.</p> <p>I do sympathise with students who are already in the UK and are panicking about their future \u2013 I really hope they find another institution with space to take them before the term starts.</p> <p>But if this current plight means that LMU concentrates on its core business of teaching and learning, focusing on its most successful departments, and perhaps even reviewing their academic standards, that can only benefit its students, its staff and the rest of the UK's higher education sector.</p> <p><em>This blog was written by a lecturer at London Metropolitan University</em></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by </strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/guardian-professional\" title=\"\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

  "<p>Sadly yesterday's glorious dappled sunshine did not repeat itself this morning. Leaving Jedburgh by the <a href=\"http://www.scotborders.gov.uk/bordersabbeysway/\">Border Abbeys Way</a>, the track rejoined St Cuthbert's Way on Vere Street before going through many boggy woodland paths. These no doubt are a delight on a sunny day, but less so when the rain is sheeting down. At least I was able to refill my water bottle (for free) from a busy little beck in one of the woods.

The distance is about the same, and there seemed little point in risking being on an exposed hilltop at 1200' in a thunderstorm, especially as the reward would have been panoramic 360 degree views of the inside of a cloud.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395519149\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/29/1346276238247/cuthbert_on_from_Kirk_Yetholm.JPG\" alt=\"Cuthbert yetholm Dragon Pennine way\" width=\"448\" height=\"336\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Looks brighter for tomorrow - heading south and east from Kirk Yetholm</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alan Sykes/PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Just after Morebattle \u2013 on the road route, that is \u2013 is <a href=\"http://www.morebattle.bordernet.co.uk/history/linton-church.html\">Linton</a>, whose church is apparently one of the oldest in use in Scotland, and which, despite Christ's advice to St Peter, is built not on rock but on sand.

Alfred Wainwright, whose picture adorns the bar of the Border Hotel here, describes it as \"a quiet village pleasantly set around a tree-shaded green\", adding </p> <blockquote> <p>There is no brass band to greet you, there is nobody waiting to pin a medal on your breast. There may be people about but they will take no notice of you. Nobody cares that you have walked, and just this minute completed, the Pennine Way ... the satisfaction you feel is intensely personal and cannot be shared: the sense of achievement is yours alone simply because you have earned it alone.</p> </blockquote> <p>No such sense of achievement for St Cuthbert's pilgrims, as we're only a little over half way there.<br><strong><br>More tomorrow, as Sykes marches on...</strong></p>",

We are doing this by improving the selectivity of our immigration system and increasing enforcement activity to prevent people coming into the UK illegally and removing those with no right to be here.\"</p> <p>Sarah Mulley, associate director at IPPR, said: \"Even reductions on this scale seem unlikely to be enough to get net migration under 100,000, not least because student migration is mostly short term, which means that reduced immigration now leads to reduced emigration later, drastically reducing the impact on net migration after the first year or two. If the target is missed, public confidence in the immigration system will be further undermined, making the politics of migration in the UK even more ugly than it is already.\"</p> <p>Mulley added that closing the door to immigrants would cost the economy dear. \"The immediate problem is that the government is making progress towards its target only at significant economic cost: reducing the numbers of skilled migrants who come to the UK to work hard, pay taxes, help businesses grow, and staff our public services, as well as fee-paying students who support our colleges and universities and provide jobs for thousands.\"</p>",

  "<p>I'm ready. I just want to go in and get it done now. It feels like the preparation has been going on for so long and watching the Olympics \u2013 where Team GB did amazingly well \u2013 has really built me up for it. But it is a little bit scary \u2013 I've trained for four years for the next few days, starting with the T34 100m on Friday.</p> <p>Back in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2012/jan/04/olympic-diarists-london-2012\" title=\"\">my very first diary in January</a> I mentioned that I felt this year would fly past. And it has. It feels like it should be about March, not August. It really has flown by. I think it is because so much has happened. I've been all over the world and my season is just about over now apart from the Paralympics. It really has gone so fast. It is weird to think how much I've done. It's been incredible.</p> <p>Final preparations were made in our training camp in Portugal \u2013 and even that seemed to go by in a flash. The camp was the same one that we visited back in March, to be kicked off the track by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2012/apr/10/olympic-diary-hannah-cockroft\" title=\"\">a kids' football tournament</a>. There were no problems like that this time around, but I don't think the atmosphere was any different, even with the Games so close.</p> <p>Everyone was quite relaxed and training hard. And we only had one thing to focus on out there. It was a good chance to meet the rest of the team and spend a bit of time together, and get to hang out with Richard Whitehead obviously! So it was kinda cool \u2013 there were no distractions, nothing else to do.</p> <p>It felt like any other training camp apart from the fact that we were without Facebook and Twitter, but that was nice actually, not having to constantly answer people. My phone doesn't ring any more \u2013 it's good, I like it.</p> <p>It was seriously hot over in Portugal, which was nice. And with the heatwave in London it looked a week or so ago like that would prove a taste of the conditions for the Games. We were hoping the warm weather wouldn't disappear when we got home. But it looks like it might be a bit cooler (and possibly wetter) on Friday. Still, I've trained in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/london-2012-olympics-blog/2012/feb/13/hannah-cockroft-olympic-diary\" title=\"\">all conditions and temperatures this year</a>, so a bit of rain hopefully won't be a problem.</p> <p>There were no world records out there, but I had a good top speed on the track. It shows I'm ready to go and show them what I am made of. And I get to compete straight away.</p> <p>It is quite strange because the 100m is on the first day of athletics, with the heats at lunchtime and the final on Friday evening, then I have to wait nearly a week for my next race \u2013 the T34 200m next Thursday. I am not sure what I am going to do with myself.</p> <p>Obviously it is going to be really exciting whatever happens \u2013 I'm competing in my first ever Paralympic event after all \u2013 but after that the challenge is keeping focused on the 200m, which might be rather difficult. But there'll be plenty of people around to keep me focused. It'll all be such an experience.</p> <p>I think I am more confident in the 200m, just because I know I've got more time to pick up speed, more time to try to pick up a lead. The 100m is just so quick \u2013 if you mess your start up you've pretty much lost the race. Which is a little frightening as that is my first race.</p> <p>I was trying to work out a Usain Bolt-Mo Farah type celebration with my brother and he came up with a few ideas, but they all looked very weird. And I don't want to look big-headed, like I've planned it. I've got to win it first, I'll just have to see what I do if it happens. I'll probably just look around and be like: \"What's going on?\" It would be amazing.</p> <p>Maybe for Rio I will work something out \u2013 I've got four years to work on it.</p> <p>The ideal scenario in a week's time? Obviously I'd have two gold medals. That's all that I really want to happen right now. If I can get a Paralympic record or a world record, that would be pretty awesome, but I don't really need them. No one remembers times, they remember medals, right? If I've got two gold medals round my neck in a week's time, I'll be sorted \u2013 happy for life.</p> <p>Me and Sally Brown, the T46 runner on the team, have said that if she \"medals\" then after the Games we'll go on holiday together, but we only get a week off so when we'd do it I don't know!</p> <p>But I'll just be the one eating burgers and chocolate cake and ice cream somewhere.</p>",
  "<p>It was supposed to be Paul Ryan's night. The lineup of speakers was studded with the vice-presidential B listers from both Mitt Romney's first draft picks and the political writers' imaginations: Rob Portman, Tim Pawlenty, Condoleezza Rice, Susan Martinez, John Thune, Mike Huckabee.</p> <p>A major theme of the remarks was the disparagement of liberals' supposed desire to soothe feelings at all costs; Huckabee mocked the new-age parenting cliche of \"giving everyone a trophy for showing up\", but that is also a pretty apt description of how the night's slots seemed to be filled. One speaker actually won a prize for the night \u2013 unfortunately for the Romney campaign, it wasn't Paul Ryan. Former secretary of state Condoleezza Rice walked off the stage in a mist of wistfulness and applause as her passionate and positive message brought the convention to its feet and generated its first taste of unrehearsed, unexpected excitement.</p> <p>Paul Ryan gave a speech as well, and it delivered hormone-injected red meat to a hungry crowd, but it didn't show anyone anything new: In fact, he has been trotting out pieces of it to the stump ever since he accepted the position. The conventional wisdom always had it that Romney would select a \"boring white guy\", and, indeed, the men intended to warm up the stage for Ryan were warm-up speakers almost solely in the sense that their body temperatures may have heated the air around them. The reception they got was lukewarm.</p> <p>Huckabee, Pawlenty, Thune and Portman performed the same basic set of jokes and asserted the same slogans with such uniformity it was hard not imagine them as a single blurry white guy with an intermittent Southern accent, referencing Obama's lack of business experience, Romney revealing humble but generic origins.</p> <p>Again, there may have been a point to this homogeneity. By the time Huckabee got to his eighth recitation of the convention's slogan \u2013 \"We can do better!\" \u2013 one hoped that it was a more immediate assurance than a reference to whatever it is a Romney administration might plan. Sure enough, in the short term, the promise was fulfilled, spectacularly, by Rice.</p> <p>I cannot argue that her speech changed my mind about any of the policies she presented. She was an architect of Bush's pointless, tragic war in Iraq. The speech itself rolled out threats of further expansions in the conveniently ill-defined war on terror. Her economic and energy arguments were vague heralds of free market wish-fulfillment. But with the bar set low enough for Ryan to rise above it, Rice's rhetoric practically soared.</p> <p>Rice used the lens of her own unarguably audacious rise from a child in the deep south to focus on the kinds of ideas that inspire things besides rage. Whereas the generic humble beginnings narratives of the boring white guys filled in blanks, Rice filled hearts. Ironically, she articulated the vision of America that makes Romney's biography so discomforting. She said:</p> <blockquote> \"The essence of America \u2013 that which really unites us \u2013 is not ethnicity, or nationality or religion \u2013 it is an idea \u2013 and what an idea it is: that you can come from humble circumstances and do great things. That it doesn't matter where you came from but where you are going.\" </blockquote> <p>Rice ended \"on a personal note\" to reference \"a little girl grows up in Jim Crow Birmingham\" whose \"parents can't take her to a movie theatre or a restaurant\" but who make \"make her believe that even though she can't have a hamburger at the Woolworth's lunch counter, she can be president of the United States and she becomes the secretary of state\". The part about being in the cabinet and not the Oval Office sounds tacked on, but maybe I'm overly optimistic. But I'm not the only one with such a vision. After Rice spoke, Fox News confirmed that she delivered the speech without a prompter. For them, that is akin to printing \"CONDI 2016\" bumperstickers.</p> <p>Her speech suggested the kind of Republican who would truly \"raise the conversation\", and if it seems like settling to want an opposition party to simply not be so utterly vindictive, well, yes, I will settle for that. It might even mean that the Democrats would ratchet down their spite as well.</p> <p>Ryan's speech did not immediately follow Rice's \u2013 lucky for him. Susana Martinez, the governor of New Mexico, spoke after the secretary and in the context of Rice's ovation she did as well as one could possibly ask. That her first big applause line was for merely owning a gun did suggest that the convention was settling back in to its more familiar mode.</p> <p>Ryan picked up where the cliches before had left off. He only developed real energy as he tore his teeth into Obama, doing so with such delight that some <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2012/08/30/paul_ryans_brazen_lies/\" title=\"\">facts got mangled along the way</a>. There was the familiar lie about Obama's \"raiding\" of Medicare, and a repetition of the accusation that Obama \"closed\" a GM plant in Wisconsin in 2008 before he became president.</p> <p>Ryan's feistiness was probably the right note to end on. Whatever \"We can do better\" is supposed to mean, it's always best to keep focused on executing the next step ahead. For Romney and Ryan, that means ginning up as much antipathy for Obama as possible without making Americans feel stupid for voting for him in the first place. His image of \"college graduates \u2026 staring up at fading Obama posters and wondering when they can move out and get going with life\" is the kind of poignant conjecture that definitely sounds true.</p> <p>Ryan's fresh face and charm allow him to deliver the same old indictments in a way that makes them look like the revelations of someone who only just now realised they'd made a mistake. As a friend who has been disillusioned with Obama for some time now put it, \"He's the Boy Scout with a knife.\" Whether you're frightened or excited by that image tells you something about how you will respond to the Republicans' message on election day.</p>",
  "<p>Sir Rhodes Boyson, the bewhiskered and boisterous former headmaster who became the most colourful champion of traditional educational values in the Thatcher era, but failed to make much mark as a minister, has died aged 87.</p> <p>Unlike many educational theorists Boyson, the son of a Rossendale cotton spinner, had practised what he preached. Before being elected as MP for Brent North in 1974, he had been head of the high-profile, flamboyantly traditional Highbury Grove comprehensive in Islington, so popular, he claimed, that he called one of his many books Oversubscribed.</p> <p>Before the Thatcher landslide of 1979 he published a polemic which advocated denationalisation of state industries, cuts in welfare and trade union rights and an end to most immigration. In a series of lurid \"black papers\" on education he urged school testing and more rigorous standards, issues that still resonate today.</p> <p>But in a succession of junior ministerial jobs \u2013 education under Sir Keith Joseph, social security, Northern Ireland and the environment \u2013 he failed to thrive, not a sufficiently practical politician or team player with the ability to woo colleagues or compromise. Boyson lost his seat in 1997 but his talent for popular and populist themes kept him in the public eye and still writing and appearing on TV.</p> <p>In an era when anodyne professional politicians were first becoming the norm at Westminster, Boyson was a throwback to more idiosyncratic times, a working-class child of Lancashire Methodism, pacifism and civic socialism who made the journey to free markets, privatisation, low taxes and pro-hanging Toryism a decade before Margaret Thatcher led a party disillusioned with the postwar consensus in the same direction.</p> <p>As such his championing of the classroom \"three Rs\", school uniforms and ready recourse to the cane, and his visceral hostility to comprehensive schools \u2013 he felt they damaged the prospects of clever working-class children \u2013 made him a hero of Tory activists, their hopes and prejudices. His disdain for welfare \"scroungers\", single mothers and sexual \"deviants\" did him no harm either.</p> <p>Nor did his anti-Europeanism or his Lancashire accent, complete with mutton-chop whiskers. More moderate and fastidious colleagues despaired of what they saw as his simplistic remedies and his ministerial boss Norman St John Stevas archly referred to him as \"the Colossus of Rhodes\". Snobbery may have impeded his ministerial rise \u2013 and he was a better propagandist. But the cultural faultline which he represented within his party persists.</p> <p>In later life Boyson \u2013 whose PhD from Manchester University was on the Victorian cotton industry whose free trade ethos he came to espouse \u2013 appeared on Have I Got News for You without realising it was a humorous show. Though a cheerfully combative figure, that weakness made him an early target for Ali G's spoof interviews.</p>",

  "<p>Heavy rain continued to drench Louisiana and Mississippi as tropical storm Isaac trudged slowly northwards, but fortified levees and an elaborate flood containment plan appeared to have spared New Orleans from disaster.</p> <p>Isaac, which was downgraded from hurricane status on Wednesday night, was expected to weaken further throughout the day, to become a tropical depression as it heads west towards Arkansas and Missouri. The National Hurricane Center said that Isaac is likely to be reclassified as a tropical depression on Thursday, but heavy rains and flooding could persist over the next few days.</p> <p>Winds \u2013 which had reached speeds of 70mph (112kph), just below the hurricane threshold of 74mph \u2013 are expected to drop below 39mph.</p> <p>The mayor of New Orleans, Mitch Landrieu, said the $14.5bn system \u2013 an array of walls, floodgates, levees and pumps built for the city by the Army Corps of Engineers \u2013 had performed exactly as it should.</p> <p>In New Orleans, rescuers picked up dozens of residents who had ignored warnings to leave low-lying areas, seven years to the day after Hurricane Katrina devastated the city.</p> <p>Power lines were cut and debris littered the streets, prompting city authorities to declare a dusk-to-dawn curfew. Louisiana officials said they would intentionally breach a levee in Placquemines Parish, south of New Orleans, as Isaac lumbered inland from the Gulf of Mexico.</p> <p>Authorities feared many residents would need help after a night of torrential rain and harsh winds knocked out power to more than 700,000 households and businesses.</p> <p>Rescuers in boats and trucks plucked a handful of people who became stranded by floodwaters in thinly populated areas of south-east Louisiana. Emergency officials in Plaquemines Parish said floodwaters had flowed over an 8ft levee between Braithwaite and White Ditch districts.</p> <p>Authorities evacuated hundreds of families from Plaquemines on Wednesday afternoon amid fears of fresh flooding.</p> <p>Convoys of people clutching children, pets and bags streamed in driving rain down state highway 23 while a fleet of ambulances with blaring sirens headed in the opposite direction towards the Mississippi to aid people still in danger.</p> <p>A YMCA centre in Belle Chase, just south of New Orleans, became an improvised refugee station for 125 people after two other nearby shelters filled up.</p> <p>\"The waters had reached the seventh step of my porch and the lawmen told us we had to evacuate the premises,\" said Veraldine Garrison, 72, who arrived with four adult children.</p> <p>\"All we had was the wind and the rain. The wind and the rain.\" Like others, she feared for her home. \"There ain't nothing you can do with mother nature. You can't control that water.\"</p> <p>Beside her, huddled in a blanket, sat a woman rescued from her rooftop, too exhausted or traumatised to speak.</p> <p>Some evacuees complained they were forced to leave pets and valuables behind. \"My chihuahuas, Tiki and Tutu, are still in my trailer home,\" said Thomas Wyman, 80, slumped in a plastic chair. \"And my money, my medicine, it's all there.\"</p> <p>Jim Gabour, who lives in the Faubourg Marigny neighborhood of New Orleans, just next to the French Quarter, said that with electricity knocked out, trees downed and the wind still up, residents were in survivalist mode and did not expect relief until the weekend.</p> <p>\"No electricity, no running water and 80mph gusts,\" Gabour wrote in an email on Wednesday. \"Right now, cutting trees off house in high winds and stinging rains. Cell batteries gone soon. Land lines not working.\"</p> <p>He added later: \"Generator too erratic for computer. No electricity, cable or land lines until weekend. Will have to turn off generator soon, and be in dark again, as we have to ration gas and no stations open. And it is suffocatingly hot.\"</p>",

  "<p>It's now nearly half a century since two black American athletes, Tommie Smith and John Carlos, supported by the Australian athlete Peter Norman, made history at the 1968 Mexico Olympics by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2012/feb/08/olympic-moments-tommie-smith-john-carlos\" title=\"\">staging a protest against racial discrimination</a>.</p> <p>There is little chance of a similar protest against disability discrimination by medal winners at the London Paralympic Games. But for many disabled people such a high-profile protest would be timely, in the face of a tidal wave of prejudice and discrimination against disabled people. This is embodied both in the coalition government's welfare reform and wider social policies, and the acceptance of Olympic sponsors such as Atos and the Dow Chemical Company. The latter companies have come to be associated in many disabled people's minds with cruelly disablist policies: in the case of Atos for carrying out harsh and discriminatory disability benefits assessments and Union Carbide (a wholly owned subsidiary of Dow) for failing in its responsibilities to the many people disabled by the Bhopal disaster.</p> <p>The rush of good feeling engendered by the success of the London Olympics and Team GB will doubtless carry the Paralympics in its slipstream. But the growing gap between the positive rhetoric underpinning the Paralympics and the day to day experience of thousands of disabled people in Britain raises big questions. Isn't it a betrayal of every Olympic ideal?</p> <p>More to the point, isn't it a betrayal of the rights and needs of all disabled people, old and young, in a civilised society? The Paralympics show just what disabled people are capable of, with support and when they are valued. Cuts in disability benefits, social care and mainstream services, meanwhile, are likely to make it impossible for other disabled people to come close to their potential.</p> <p>Disabled people are far too important for the Paralympics to be used as a fig leaf to hide the oppression and discrimination they seem increasingly to face. Ultimately this can only bring the games into disrepute.</p> <p>We must also recognise the wider complicity many of us have in disability policies. The government would hardly be pursuing them, against a significant minority, unless it calculated it had public opinion on its side \u2013 opinion prepared to go along with the view that in hard times, disabled people should no longer expect so much and need to tighten their belts too.</p> <p>The Olympics are meant to encourage optimism. Perhaps there will be a big government and tabloid media change of heart about disabled people after the Paralympics. But let's not hold our breath.</p> <p>The issue now is not so much what legacy the London Paralympics will leave, but what legacy policymakers are leaving the growing number of disabled people that will help make up society in the future and what the rest of us plan to do about this. On this occasion, the most important and effective protest is likely to be one that extends far beyond the Olympic Stadium, beyond disabled people, to embrace the rest of us.</p> <p><strong>This article is published by Guardian Professional. </strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/social-care-network/2012/jul/16/become-member-guardian-social-care-network\" title=\"\"><strong>Join the social care network</strong></a><strong> to receive regular emails and exclusive offers.</strong></p>",

One image that resonated with the tens of thousands crowded into the convention centre was when Ryan spoke about students. \"College graduates should not have to live out their 20s in their childhood bedrooms, staring up at fading Obama posters and wondering when they can move out and get going with life,\" he said.</p> <p>\"Everyone who feels stuck in the Obama economy is right to focus on the here and now. And I hope you understand this too, if you're feeling left out or passed by: you have not failed, your leaders have failed you.\"</p> <p>The immediate reaction from senior Republicans, however, was positive. \"He did all he had to do. He introduced himself personally to the American people,\" said the former House Speaker and one-time Romney rival Newt Gingrich.</p> <p>Gingrich told the Guardian: \"Paul Ryan knows more than Joe Biden has remembered or confused.\" Addressing concern about his lack of experience, Gingrich pointed out that Ryan, 42, is only four years younger than Obama was when elected to the presidency and already has much more political experience than the then Democratic candidate.</p> <p>Ryan's was a measured speech that began nervously but got stronger as it progressed. He had two difficult acts to follow after former secretary of state Condoleezza Rice and the governor of New Mexico, Susana Martinez, delivered powerful addresses.</p> <p>He couched his speech in moral terms. \"We have responsibilities, one to another \u2013 we do not each face the world alone. And the greatest of all responsibilities is that of the strong to protect the weak. The truest measure of any society is how it treats those who cannot defend or care for themselves,\" he said.</p> <p>He added: \"Our rights come from nature and God, not from government.\"</p> <p>The focus now shifts to Romney, who now has to deliver the speech of his life to the convention, one that could determine whether he or Obama will be the next president. He has to win over not only conservatives at the convention, to ensure they turn out as volunteers and on election day, but more importantly an estimated television audience of more than 30 million.</p> <p>The convention in the early evening had been flat, lacking in energy, with delegates milling around, not listening to the speakers.</p> <p>Rice fired them up, accusing Obama of leading from the back in foreign policy. She brought the convention to its feet again towards the end of her speech when she spoke about how a girl who had been banned under the Jim Crow laws from eating a hamburger in her local Woolworth's store in her hometown, Alabama, and rose to become secretary of state.</p> <p>There was a brief protest when a small group of women unfurled a banner saying \"Vagina\", making their point about Republican policies on abortion and other issues related to women. To shouts of \"USA, USA\" from the delegates they left the hall.</p> <p>The divisions and tensions in the Republican party were exposed again when hundreds of supporters of the libertarian Texas Congressman Ron Paul \u2013 who accumulated a lot of delegates during his bid for the presidential nomination \u2013 walked out over rules changes they see as limiting grassroots rights.</p>",

That turned out to involve anything from Handel's Eternal Source of Light Divine to the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and from the apple falling in Isaac Newton's Lincolnshire garden to Stephen Hawking's celebration of the Higgs particle. The great astrophysicist and Sir Ian McKellen, in the guise of Prospero, shared the MC duties, with Nicola Miles-Wildin, as Miranda, intoning Shakespeare's key lines: \"O wonder! / How many goodly creatures are there here! / How beauteous mankind is! O brave new world, / That has such people in't!\"</p> <p>This time all the Queen had to do was turn up and make a short speech. Nobody invited her to follow her scene-stealing role alongside James Bond by joining Pan's People or singing a duet with Beverley Knight. Like the rest of the 80,000 in the Stratford stadium, she sat and watched a Paralympic opening ceremony that cast the spotlight on the role of science in helping to change social attitudes and culminated in the lighting of the 205 new petals of Thomas Heatherwick's long-stemmed cauldron, the flame swooping down from the top of Anish Kapoor's adjacent tower, carried on the last stage of its journey by an athlete attached to a zip wire.</p> <p>\"Prepare to be inspired, prepare to be dazzled, prepare to be moved,\" Sebastian Coe told the spectators. He was talking about the 503 events in which medals will be won, but he could have been describing the uncompromising climax of a four-hour gala, which came with a performance of Ian Dury's Spasticus Autisticus by members of the Graeae Theatre Company and the appearance of a giant version of Marc Quinn's Alison Lapper Pregnant, the sculpture of the limbless woman that once looked down from the fourth plinth in Trafalgar Square. They left no doubt about why we were here \u2013 and about how far we have come since Ludwig Guttmann, the Silesian neurosurgeon who arrived in England as a refugee from Hitler, identified the possibility of using sport to aid the recovery of paralysed servicemen and women who had previously been considered beyond salvation.</p> <p>Facing the world's media this week, the South African runner Oscar Pistorius, whose legs were amputated in infancy, made the point that Paralympic athletes want to be judged not on disability but on ability. In other words, the 4,200 competitors from 164 countries would rather you enjoyed their skills than felt pity for their missing limbs. The fact remains, however, that this bunch of inhabitants of the London 2012 athletes' village come with more voluminous baggage than the former occupants. They simply have more gripping stories. If they didn't, they wouldn't be here.</p> <p>It is thanks to them that we now know something about the implications of being born without a fibula in either leg (Pistorius), with arthrogryposis multiplex congenita (Lee Pearson, the flamboyant holder of nine equestrian gold medals from Sydney, Athens and Beijing), or without hands or feet (the Brazilian swimmer Daniel Dias). We have learned to recognise the possibilities for achievement that remain despite jumping into a swimming pool and breaking your neck (female wheelchair rugby player Kylie Grimes), losing a leg to infantile meningitis (teenage 100m prodigy Jonnie Peacock), or losing both legs under a railway train (javelin thrower Nathan Stephens) or on a Circle Line train on 7/7 (sitting volleyball player Martine Wright).</p> <p>We have been nudged, most of all, towards a deeper understanding of the word \"transformation\", as employed so tellingly by Guttmann, whose intention in founding the Stoke Mandeville Games for the Paralysed, he said, was \"to transform a severely disabled patient into a taxpayer\".</p> <p>There was no sentimentality about Guttmann. A black-and-white film clip shows him responding to a bedridden patient who confesses to a loss of belief in his recovery. \"Now cut that out, will you,\" the doctor snaps, the crispness of his delivery perhaps only marginally exaggerated for the camera. His reward, before his death in 1980, was to see the start of the transformation of his modest concept into the Paralympics, and thereby a transformation in the public perception not just of disabled athletes but of disability in general.</p> <p>Pistorius talked this week of his personal experience of that process. In supermarkets, he said, parents still sometimes turned their children away from the sight of his prosthetic legs. But once he gets a chance to talk to the children, perhaps telling them that his original legs dropped off because he failed to eat his vegetables, the sense of shock and otherness disappears quickly and for good.</p> <p>He noted with approval that the young people who turned up for the Paralympic day in Trafalgar Square a year ago \"didn't have the normal reactions that people show to disabled athletes \u2013 they were friendly and excited.\" The United Kingdom, he added, had dealt with disabled people \"in a very amazing way \u2013 a lot of people around the world will be forced to see the Paralympics through the eyes of people in the UK, and that's a fantastic thing.\"</p> <p>These Games are the real thing, all right, mirroring the Olympics in all sorts of ways. They have their own rows over illegal performance enhancement, in the form of blood-boosting achieved through various methods of self-torture unsuitable for description in a family newspaper. A Paralympics sponsor \u2013 Atos, which tests the fitness for work of disabled people on behalf of the government \u2013 is accused of using its association with the event to launder its image. And there is a dispute over the ability of the Paralympics to create a meaningful legacy at a time when disabled people in the UK are suffering from severe cuts to the employment and support allowance. Part of the real world, indeed, sharing and sometimes highlighting its real and intractable problems. But, for the next 11 days, as we learn the rules of boccia and sitting volleyball, enjoy the visceral thrill of the wheelchair races and watch blind people playing football by ear and touch, we too will be playing a full part in squeezing the last drops of enjoyment from a \u00a39.3bn investment that seems to have delivered the goods.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 30 August 2012. The original said that the nation suffered a <em>petit mort </em>, rather than a <em>petite mort </em>, at the end of the Olympic Games. This has been corrected.</p>",
  "<h2><strong>Day one: 30 August</strong></h2> <p>The opening day of the Paralympic Games and already there are finals galore, 15 of them in the aquatic centre alone. Susannah Rodgers, surprise package of the 2011 IPC European championships, will look to emulate her five gold medals from Berlin in the S7 100m backstroke (heats 10.41am, final 6.50pm) while Jonathan Fox races in the men's S7 100m backstroke (heats 10.31am, final 6.44pm). Natalie Du Toit goes for her 11th Paralympic gold in the S9 100m butterfly (heats 10.53am, final 7.17pm) and the Ukrainian teenager Yevheniy Bohodayko looks to make an impression in his first Games in the S6 100m backstroke (heats 9.30am, final 5.30pm). Also, world and European 60kg judo champion Ben Quilter is in action (from 11am) and Sarah Storey goes for gold in the velodrome in the C5 pursuit (quals 10.40am, final 4.50pm).</p> <h2>Archery</h2> <p>10:00 Men's Individual Recurve -

  "<p>The <a href=\"http://www.ukba.homeoffice.gov.uk/\" title=\"\">UK Border Agency</a> (UKBA) has revoked London Metropolitan University's power to teach or recruit international students, leaving nearly 3,000 students facing deportation unless they can find another place to study within 60 days.</p> <p>The university's vice-chancellor, Malcolm Gillies, has warned that the decision to revoke its licence to take non-EU students would create a \u00a330m loss \u2013 equal to nearly a fifth of the university's budget \u2013 and threatens the institution's future. Of the 30,000 students expected at the university in the new academic year, about 2,700 from outside the EU.</p> <p>A statement posted on the university's website on Wednesday night said: \"The implications of the revocation are hugely significant and far-reaching, and the university has already started to deal with these. It will be working very closely with the UKBA, Higher Education Funding Council for England [HEFCE], the NUS and its own students' union. Our absolute priority is to our students, both current and prospective, and the university will meet all its obligations to them.\"</p> <p>The NUS has contacted David Cameron and the home secretary, Theresa May, to \"express anger at the way that decisions have been made in recent weeks and to reiterate the potentially catastrophic effects on higher education as a \u00a312.5bn a year export industry for the UK\".</p> <p>The university's \"highly trusted status\" for sponsoring international students was suspended last month over fears that \"a small minority\" of students did not have accurate documentation.</p> <p>The revocation of this status means that any students not involved in the failures around monitoring their status will be allowed to remain in the UK and given 60 days to find a new sponsor, \"regularise their stay\" or leave the UK. Any longer stay may lead to deportation and refusal for any application to enter the country for 10 years. The Home Office guidance to universities states: \"If a student has already been given a visa when we revoke your licence, we will cancel it if they have not travelled to the UK. If they then travel to the UK, we will refuse them entry.\"</p> <p>A border agency spokesman said the decision had been made after the university \"failed to address serious and systemic failings that were identified \u2026 six months ago.\" He added: \"We have been working with them since then, but the latest audit revealed problems with 61% of files randomly sampled. Allowing London Metropolitan University to continue to sponsor and teach international students was not an option.\"</p> <p>The universities minister, David Willetts, said a taskforce led by the HEFCE and Universities UK would help overseas students affected by the decision: \"It is important that genuine students who are affected through no fault of their own are offered prompt advice and help, including, if necessary, with finding other institutions at which to finish their studies.</p> <p>The taskforce, which will also include UKBA and the NUS, will work with London Metropolitan University \"to support affected students and enable them to continue their studies in the UK\".</p> <p>In an email before the licence was revoked, Gillies appealed for help to Keith Vaz, the chairman of the Commons home affairs select committee, saying university leaders \"absolutely accept\" some processes on international student recruitment \"will need further adapting\".</p> <p>In a letter to Home Office minister Damian Green, Vaz said: \"While the committee is fully supportive of the government's efforts to clamp down on the abuse of student visas, and the need to follow rigorous processes, I share the vice-chancellor's concerns about the procedure in the case.\"</p> <p>Liam Burns, NUS president, said: \"It is disgusting that international students continue to be used as a political football by politicians who seem either incapable of understanding, or are simply uncaring about the impact of their decisions on individuals, universities and the UK economy.</p> <p>\"This decision will create panic and potential heartbreak for students not just at London Met but also all around the country. The needs of students must be at the heart of any process to find new places of study and NUS will be working with UUK and HEFCE to support affected students and ensure as far as possible that they can continue studying in the UK.\"</p> <p>\"Politicians need to realise that a continued attitude of suspicion towards international students could endanger the continuation of higher education as a successful export industry. This heavy-handed decision makes no sense for students, no sense for institutions and no sense for the country. This situation and the botched process by which the decision was arrived at could be avoided if international students were not included in statistics of permanent migrants.\"</p> <p>Further official information to students is available <a href=\"http://www.ukba.homeoffice.gov.uk/visas-immigration/studying/adult-students/changes/\" title=\"\">here</a>.</p>"
