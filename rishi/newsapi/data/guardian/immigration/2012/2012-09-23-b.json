  "<p>As football continues to wait for the introduction of video technology, the referee's job just becomes more difficult. Now, alongside season-defining decisions on whether the ball has crossed the line, the intent of a player handling the ball and so on, he has to decide whether a player falling to the ground has been fouled, or has in fact \"gone down like Jimmy Krankie\".</p> <p>That was the colourful simile Mark Lawrenson chose on Match of the Day to describe Chelsea's Branislav Ivanovic's descent in Stoke City's penalty area. One hopes the pundit was referring to the incident in 2004 when actor Janette Tough, playing Jimmy, fell 10 feet from a pantomime beanstalk, rather than anything revealed by the Krankies about their remarkably outr\u00e9 personal life in a 2011 BBC Scotland interview, about which some listeners apparently still have nightmares.</p> <p>Lawro's problem is that he has invented himself as the cheeky chappie of football punditry, inheritor of the mantle formerly carried by Ron Atkinson, and that brings its own demands.</p> <p>Big Ron peppered his analysis with colourful argot picked up from training grounds over the decades \u2013 I am not sure he invented much himself \u2013 now lovingly preserved by my friends at the Irish website <a href=\"http://www.dangerhere.com/\" title=\"\">dangerhere.com</a>, one of whose entries gives a clue as to how Ron might have dealt with Ivanovic, and the earlier similar incident in which Chelsea's Oscar was booked. \"I know the lad's got a nudge early doors,\" goes the extract, \"but big Heskey's gone down like Buddy Holly there.\"</p> <p>I believe the Buddy Holly reference was buried alongside Big Ron's career, being considered in extremely questionable taste, given the influence he had on the development of rock'n'roll \u2013 that's Buddy, not Ron \u2013 before his young life was ended when the aeroplane in which he was travelling to a gig went down, rather more tragically than Jimmy Krankie, in February 1959.</p> <p>It's a tricky area, working out statutes of limitations for jokes. After all, there are famous Titanic jokes (Customer in cocktail bar: \"I know I asked for ice, but this is ridiculous.\") and nobody waited a century to tell them. Was Big Ron in order with his Buddy Holly references decades after the crash? I am sure it was never discussed, but perhaps if it had been, he might have watched his words more carefully on other occasions, and we might not have been left with merely a distant echo in Lawrenson.</p> <p>Actually, it might be safer all round to stick with the preference of RTE's Eamon Dunphy, who tends to opt for \"he's gone down like a roll of lino\". The problem with that simile is it excludes younger listeners who have grown up in a more affluent era, certainly for floor coverings. But those of us who pre-date Ikea remember when dad would roll linoleum out across the floor in stages till it covered the surface, a process brought to mind by another favourite of Big Ron's, when he wasn't tramping on the memory of rock'n'roll legends, \"he's gone down in instalments\".</p> <p>That best describes the incident in which Chelsea's Oscar was booked, more I think for his dive and triple salko than the fall, because it looked to me as though the Brazilian had been tripped. Lawro contented himself with the feeble \"Oscar should have had an Oscar\". If he wants to continue to walk in Big Ron's footsteps, he may need writers.</p> <p>I think it is entirely possible MotD gives us Lawro and Harry Redknapp from time to time to make us grateful for Shearer and Hansen. Much though we may enjoy the company of Harry, as an analyst, affable 'Arry is useless, still too close to the game maybe.</p> <p>Frankly, you might as well have a plate of cockles and a cocktail stick in the studio. \"They're proper football people at Everton \u2026 Any young lads watching should take Ashley Cole and Leighton Baines as role models \u2026 Aston Villa will struggle because they've sold their best players and you can't sell your best players and not expect to struggle.\" And so on, Harry burbles. It's to be hoped he finds a club soon, because that's where he is at home.</p> <p>Meanwhile, on the subject of floor coverings, the documentary Being: Liverpool, a fly-on-the-wall (ish) look at life behind the scenes at Anfield, started last week on Channel 5. It has been made by Fox for an international audience, who should be warned, if they are learning English, that that is not normally where we would put a colon.</p> <p>On 5, the colon is presumably intended to demonstrate this is a cut above some of the tosh shown on the channel, and quality was there in abundance, mostly in the lovely homes of Steven Gerrard and Brendan Rodgers, either of whom could cash in the value of the white marble on the floor and pay Andy Carroll's wages for the foreseeable future. Rodgers's gaff looks like a luxury hotel and spa complex transplanted to Formby from rural Hampshire with, it will hardly startle you to learn, not a scrap of lino anywhere.</p>",
  "<p>Two goals each by the captain Katie Chapman and the striker Ellen White gave Arsenal a 4-1 home win against Liverpool to put the champions on the brink of retaining their Super League title.</p> <p>Arsenal's points haul \u2013 30 from their 12 games \u2013 cannot be surpassed but the champagne was left on ice as a 2-0 victory for Birmingham City at Doncaster Belles on Sunday night kept alive Blues' hopes of drawing level. Birmingham could clinch the title on goal difference when the two teams meet on the last day of the season.</p> <p>That scenario is unlikely as Arsenal, who beat Birmingham 4-2 at home in June, are the only unbeaten team and have a goal difference of 20 while their title rivals' is 13 following their trip to Doncaster, where goals from the striker Eni Aluko and the midfielder Jade Moore ensured three points.</p> <p>Arsenal needed two late goals to wrap up victory against the bottom club, Liverpool. The midfielder Chapman struck twice in four first-half minutes but the striker Katie Brusell pulled back a goal midway through the second half. The Liverpool substitute Hannah Keryakoplis then had a header saved by Emma Byrne.</p> <p>White scored twice in the last two minutes, leaving Arsenal waiting to be confirmed as champions, a position they achieved in last year's inaugural Super League. Arsenal won the Premier League \u2013 the top flight ahead of the WSL's formation \u2013 in each of the previous seven years.</p>",
  "<p>Last September, when Barack Obama's approval ratings were in the low to mid-40s and a clear majority of Americans said he did not deserve a second term, veteran pollster Charlie Cook described his ideal Republican opponent as \"odourless and colourless\". With unemployment and the deficit so high and gridlock so stubborn, he explained, a challenger who did not repel independents or unnecessarily antagonise Obama's base should have little problem defeating the president.</p> <p>The trouble was that almost all the&#xa0;Republican contenders during the primary were either extremely colourful or, as candidates at least, stank. There was Newt Gingrich, who wanted to build&#xa0;permanent bases on the moon and, according to his ex-wife, demanded an open three-way relationship with the mistress who is now his current wife; Ricky Perry, who could not&#xa0;remember his own talking points; and Herman Cain, who was accused by several women of sexual harassment and proudly stated that he did not know the&#xa0;name of the president of \"Ubeki-beki-beki-beki-stan-stan\". Each, for a while, was a frontrunner.</p> <p>So when people wonder how Mitt Romney became the party's standard-bearer they need to first remember just&#xa0;how low the standards were. To make sense within the Republican party was, almost by definition, to appear nonsensical outside it. More credible candidates took a look at what you'd have to say and do to compete and decided to sit the election out.</p> <p>After a fortnight of gaffes and worsening poll numbers critics have rounded on Romney's campaign (which is turning into a circular firing squad) and his personal failings as a candidate (a wooden, awkward campaigner who can't relate to ordinary people). But his flaws as a nominee are only properly understood in the context of the flaws of the party that nominated him. Romney's not letting the party down. Quite the opposite. He's a far more plausible, competent and rational a candidate than it deserves. The urgent question is not why, for the time being, the race seems to be getting away from him, but how he has remained in contention for so long.</p> <p>True, this was supposed to be the Republicans' election to lose. When Obama was pitted against a (\"colourless\", \"odourless\") generic Republican in polls, he was defeated. The trouble is, the more voters see what qualifies for a generic Republican the less keen they are to have anything to do with one.</p> <p>It's not difficult to see why. Over the past few years Republicans have come across as particularly heartless. During one primary debate, Texas governor Rick Perry was cheered when introduced as a man who'd overseen 234 executions. <a href=\"https://www.toledoblade.com/Politics/2012/08/15/Joe-the-Plumber-calls-for-fence-start-shooting-to-protect-border.html\" title=\"\">Joe the Plumber, now a congressional candidate in Ohio</a>, spelled out his plan for dealing with illegal immigration: \"Put a fence on the damn border and start shooting.\"</p> <p>They are none too keen on facts. <a href=\"http://www.pewforum.org/Politics-and-Elections/2012-romney-mormonism-obamas-religion.aspx\" title=\"\">The percentage of Republicans who believe Obama is a Muslim</a> has doubled in the last four years and now stands at about one in three, the same proportion of Republicans in the swing state of Ohio who still <a href=\"http://www.publicpolicypolling.com/main/2012/03/limbaugh-and-birthers.html\" title=\"\">do not believe Obama was born in the US</a>. They are not particularly interested in consensus, either. Two thirds of Republicans said they'd rather have a congressperson who <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/post/boehners-problem-his-party-doesnt-like-compromise/2011/07/11/gIQAnUdMhI_blog.html\" title=\"\">stuck to their principles no matter what than one who compromises to get things done</a>. They give little impression of being inclusive. Asked <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/voters-explain-why-blacks-pick-democratic/2012/08/29/2d85f792-f238-11e1-adc6-87dfa8eff430_graphic.html\" title=\"\">why they thought so many African Americans supported Democrats,</a> the most common opinion among those with a view was because of welfare dependency. And they appear stuck in the past. More than one in four Republicans in Mississippi and one in five in Alabama believe interracial marriage should be illegal while closer to two thirds in <a href=\"http://www.publicpolicypolling.com/main/2012/03/other-notes-from-alabama-and-mississippi.html\" title=\"\">both states do not believe in evolution</a>.</p> <p>Such is the extremeness and eccentricity of those to whom Romney must appeal for votes and cash. To be fair, Romney saw this coming. In February he said: \"It's very easy to excite the base with incendiary comments ... I'm not willing to light my hair on fire to try and get support. I am who I am.\" By July, Sarah Palin was insisting the least he could do was throw a match and some gasoline her way. (\"Well, light our hair on fire, then!,\" she told Fox News). Now he's in the process of fullblown self-immolation, and his candidacy is on the brink of crashing and burning.</p> <p>\"The appearance of a Republican party almost entirely composed of ideological conservatives is a new and historically unprecedented development,\" writes Geoffrey Kabaservice in Rule and Ruin: The Downfall of Moderation and the Destruction of the Republican Party. \"It is only in the last decade or so that movement conservatism finally succeeded in silencing, co-opting, repelling, or expelling nearly every competing strain of Republicanism from the party.\"</p> <p>The New Yorker's Ryan Lizza points out: \"<a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2012/03/12/120312fa_fact_lizza\" title=\"\">The number [of Republicans] who call themselves liberal is now close to the number who describe themselves as&#xa0;Aleut or Eskimo.</a>\"</p> <p>Romney understands this problem. He was raised with it. At 17 he saw his father George, the governor of Michigan, walk out of the 1964 convention after a <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/2011/10/31/141857420/new-republic-mitt-romneys-parent-trap\" title=\"\">futile bid to challenge its extremist platform</a>. That year, Gerald Ford symbolically nominated George from the floor, describing him as a man who \"has never let the temporary glitter of expediency obscure the path which his integrity dictated he must follow\".</p> <p>And, as the governor of Massachusetts, one of the most reliably liberal states in the country, Mitt has worked with it. In September 2002, shortly before his gubernatorial election, he told a group of pro-choice campaigners that for all their differences they could make common cause. Melissa Kogut, then head of Massachusetts Naral, told the Washington Post. \"He closed the meeting by taking on a just-between-us tone and saying, essentially, <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/10/09/AR2007100902146.html\" title=\"\">'You need Republicans like me. And the party needs candidates like me, because this issue is killing the party.'\"</a></p> <p>The party he tried to save is dead; the party he represents now deluded. When he speaks candidly within it, he exposes its contempt for the poor in particular and the electorate's intelligence in general. When he speaks carefully outside of it, he exposes its contradictions: driven by the fringe but appealing to the mainstream. This is not a problem of Romney's making; it's the problem that made Romney's candidacy possible.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 24 September 2012. The original said that, of Republicans asked why they thought so many African Americans supported Democrats, \"more than half said because they are government dependents while one in six insisted it was because they were uninformed, ignorant or uneducated\". This was based on numbers in a poll that were assumed to be percentages, but were in fact raw counts.</p>",
  "<p>Has anything of note happened at the Elephant and Castle in south London since <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/1999/feb/23/lawrence.ukcrime9\" title=\"\">the Stephen Lawrence inquiry</a>, in the 1990s?

But no one can do anything unless they have the numbers.\"</p> <p>Aren't you're lumping together a lot of different people from a lot of different cultures?

  "<p>Books, believes Hernando Guanlao, need to live. And they're only alive if they are being read. Thought and effort, time and money went into making them; they will never repay it lying idle in a cabinet or on a shelf. Books need to be set free. So walk by his home on Balagtas Street in Makati, downtown Manila, and it seems <a href=\"http://opinion.inquirer.net/36712/the-little-library-that-could\" title=\"\">books are pretty much all you'll see</a>. Thousands of them, on shelves and in crates outside on the pavement, piled high in the garage and on the stairs, each one free to anyone who wants it.</p> <p>\"People can borrow, take home, bring back or keep,\" says&#xa0;Guanlao, 60, a former tax accountant, ice-cream salesman and government employee known by all as Nanie. \"Or they can share and pass on to another. But basically they should just take, take!\" Guanlao reckons books \"have lives, and have to lead them. They have work to do.&#xa0;And the act of giving a book \u2026it makes you complete. It makes your life meaningful and abundant.\"</p> <p>Thankfully for Guanlao's faith in human nature, people also give&#xa0;\u2013 often people he has never previously met, or doesn't even see: they leave boxes of books outside his door. \"What's taken gets replaced many times over,\" he says. \"I don't keep an inventory. But there are a lot of books. They want to be read, so they come here.\"</p> <p>The Reading Club 2000, as it is called, began 12 years ago as a tribute to Guanlao's late parents, both civil servants. \"They gave me my love of reading,\" he says. \"I wanted to honour them and to do some kind of community service. So I put my old books \u2013 and my brothers' and sisters', maybe 100 in all \u2013 outside, to see if anyone was interested.\"</p> <p>It took a while for people to work out that this was, as Guanlao puts it, a library \"open 24/7, and with no rules\", but the scheme, offering everything from battered crime paperbacks to fashion magazines, technical manuals, arcane histories and school textbooks, is booming.</p> <p>It is helped by the fact that despite a 1994 act pledging \"reading centres throughout the country\", the Philippines, with a&#xa0;population of 92 million, has fewer than <a href=\"http://opinion.inquirer.net/36712/the-little-library-that-could\" title=\"\">700 public libraries</a>, and buying books is a luxury many cannot afford.</p> <p>Fortunately the Reading Club is spreading. Guanlao takes boxes of books into Manila's neighbourhoods himself, on a specially adapted book bike. He has also helped friends set up similar schemes at 10 other sites around the country, and inspired student book drives.</p> <p>Aurora Verayo, from a town several hours drive from Manila, says she came to see Guanlao to donate books, but he persuaded her to open her own centre. \"I'm going a step further and offering reading sessions for children,\" she says. \"This is the start of a&#xa0;movement.\" Mark, a 16-year-old accountancy student at the Philippine Christian University in Manila, is organising a book drive with friends. \"We've collected 90 books so far, and we expect many more,\" he says. \"We're taking them to the barrios next month. Books open minds. A book can take you anywhere.\"</p>",
  "<p>At least nine climbers have been killed and another four are missing after one of the deadliest avalanches in recent years tore down a Himalayan peak obliterating everything in its path.</p> <p>One tented camp nearly 7,000 metres above sea level was levelled and a second, 500 metres further down, was damaged. The identity of the casualties on Mount Manaslu, the eighth highest mountain in the world at 8,163m, remains unclear, but they are thought to include up to four Frenchmen, a Nepalese guide, a German, a Spaniard, and an Italian.</p> <p>Basant Mishra, a police official, told Reuters that the bodies of a German climber and a Nepalese guide had been recovered from slopes of the mountain, which lies about 60 miles (100km) north-west of Kathmandu. \"Rescue pilots have spotted seven other bodies,\" he said.</p> <p>Helicopters were dispatched to the remote area to look for those missing after the early morning accident, but cloud and fog complicated the rescue efforts, Mishra said.</p> <p>According to Le Parisien newspaper, a source at the French ministry of foreign affairs said, \"There were several groups ascending, among them two French groups.\" Four French climbers are believed to have died, but the ministry has refused to make any confirmations.</p> <p>The Dauphin\u00e9 Lib\u00e9r\u00e9 newspaper named three of the missing and presumed dead as R\u00e9my L\u00e9cluse and Gregory Costa, who had intended to descend the mountain on skis, and Ludovic Chall\u00e9ac, a guide from the French ski resort of Chamonix. Two French climbers have been flown by helicopter to Kathmandu for treatment.</p> <p>Organisers of one US expedition said they had received a call from their lead guide on Manaslu saying there had been a large avalanche on the upper mountain in the Camp Three area.</p> <p>Their expedition's team was lower down on the mountain but had moved up to help with the rescue, Gordon Janow of Alpine Ascents said.</p> <p>\"[The] weather was good. [It] was a large serac [ice cliff] that fell,\" he told the Guardian.</p> <p>Glen Plake, a celebrity in the world of extreme sports known for his mohican and boundary-pushing skiing, narrowly escaped the avalanche, <a href=\"http://daily.epictv.com/blog/2012/09/23/avalanche-on-manaslu-plake-alive-remy-and-greg-missing/\" title=\"\">according to French website EpicTv</a>.</p> <p>Plake, 48, said he was in his tent reading his Bible when he heard a roar. Within moments, the tent had been carried hundreds of metres down the mountain's slopes.</p> <p>\"It's a war zone up here,\" Plake told the site.</p> <p>Hundreds of foreign climbers flock every year to Himalayan peaks in Nepal, which has eight of the world's 14 highest mountains, including Mount Everest. September marks the beginning of the autumn, post-monsoon climbing season, which runs through November.</p> <p>Manaslu was particularly popular this year after Chinese authorities restricted access to Cho Oyu, another 8,000m peak.</p> <p>The deaths will undoubtedly provoke further argument about whether big Himalayan mountains favoured by large, fee-paying or sponsored expeditions are becoming too crowded and too commercialised.</p> <p>Several climbers high on the mountain were aiming to be the first-ever to ascent Manaslu without oxygen and ski down. Two teams with around 20 climbers appear to have been waiting at Camp Three for the weather to clear when the avalanche struck.</p> <p>Massive snow falls have made conditions treacherous on and around Manaslu recently. Several climbers had expressed concerns over the avalanche risk before heading up the mountain last week.</p> <p>One Nepalese official said the popularity of Manaslu, first climbed in 1956, was not a problem.</p> <p>\"Yes, base camp might have been a bit crowded but the route higher up was not. This is a natural disaster. Not man-made in any way,\" he said.</p> <p>Authorities in poverty-stricken Nepal are sensitive to charges that too many permits for climbing mountains are sold to foreign expeditions. However, the permits generate much needed hard currency.</p> <p>Dawa Steven Sherpa, a well-known Nepalese mountaineer, said the avalanche might have been caused by heavy snowfall last week.</p> <p>\"The incident might have taken place as snow hadn't yet settled properly,\" he said.</p> <p>Ang Tsering Sherpa, former president of the Nepal Mountaineering Association who has climbed Manaslu several times, said the mountain was regarded as one of the easiest of the 14 peaks that top 8,000m but the accident was not linked to the number of climbers.</p> <p>\"Such avalanche takes place normally if it's too hot or if there is heavy snow fall. Climate change, of course, had some effect but avalanches are uncertain and there is no any exact reason for any one avalanche.\"</p> <h2><strong>A history of recent Himalayan avalanches</strong></h2> <p><strong>5 May 2012</strong> At least 13 people died in Nepal when a slide of snow and ice from Mount Annapurna caused a river to burst its banks and flood the surrounding area, including the town of Pokhara.

  "<p>Andrew Mitchell will hold on to his position as chief whip unless more damaging details emerge about his angry confrontation with police in Downing Street, David Cameron has decided.</p> <p>As his cabinet colleague Eric Pickles mocked Mitchell by describing himself as \"proud\" to be a pleb \u2013 the term Mitchell denies calling officers \u2013 the prime minister made it clear his support was conditional.</p> <p>Government sources said Cameron would stand by Mitchell, who was appointed chief whip in the recent reshuffle, unless there were further developments. Sources said there were no excuses for Mitchell's behaviour, which has prompted a difficult few days for the government.</p> <p>Mitchell has admitted swearing in front of officers who declined, on security grounds, to let him leave through the main Downing Street gates on his bicycle on Wednesday night. But he insisted he used the word \"fucking\" to express frustration and did not direct the word at the police.</p> <p>The public school-educated chief whip has emphatically denied accusations by unnamed police officers that he called them \"plebs\". Mitchell's position would be untenable if he was proved to have used the word, because it would lend support to Labour claims that the Tory leadership regards public servants \u2013 even those charged with guarding the prime minister \u2013 as socially inferior.</p> <p>The chief whip's explanation cut no ice with Labour. Yvette Cooper, the shadow home secretary, said that the confirmation that Mitchell had sworn in front of police guarding Downing Street merited an investigation by Sir Jeremy Heywood, the cabinet secretary.</p> <p>Cooper said: \"We now know that Andrew Mitchell swore at police officers who were doing their job protecting Downing Street. This is completely unacceptable behaviour from a cabinet minister, and a half-hearted private apology is clearly insufficient. Given the justified anger and concern from police officers of all ranks, Mr Mitchell should apologise publicly immediately.'</p> <p>In the first detailed response by a Conservative cabinet minister, the communities secretary, Eric Pickles, said he accepted Mitchell's explanation that he did not use the word \"plebs\". But he mocked Mitchell when he told the BBC Sunday Politics: \"He's never used it in my presence, but then again I'm very proud myself to be a pleb.\"</p> <p>The most authoritative account of Mitchell's side of his confrontation with the police was <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/conservative/9559658/I-dont-believe-that-Andrew-Mitchell-let-loose-the-explosive-P-word.html\" title=\"\">published by the Sunday Telegraph</a>. In his weekly column, Matthew d'Ancona wrote that Mitchell has admitted that he swore, though it was not aimed directly at the police.</p> <p>The paper reports that Mitchell admitted muttering in earshot of the police: \"You guys are supposed to fucking help us.\"</p> <p>Mitchell has let it be known he used the word \"adjectivally\" and was not directing it at the police.</p> <p>Mitchell's explanation may raise questions about the statement he issued on Thursday night when the Sun reported that he had sworn at police and had called them \"plebs\". In the statement, Mitchell said he did not accept he had used the words attributed to him. One of those words was \"fucking\".</p> <p>The Sun reported Mitchell as saying: \"Best you learn your fucking place. You don't run this fucking government. You're fucking plebs.\" The newspaper also reported an eyewitness as saying that Mitchell had described the police as \"morons\".</p> <p>The chief whip, who ran David Davis's unsuccessful Tory leadership campaign in 2005, is known to have a quick temper. But friends said he would never use the words morons or plebs.</p> <p>Mitchell was given a boost on Sunday when the Liberal Democrats declined to call for his resignation. Nick Clegg mirrored No 10's thinking when he said that a line should be drawn under the matter unless more details emerged.</p> <p>The deputy prime minister told the Andrew Marr Show on BBC1: \"I think unless something comes to light about the rival versions about what was and what wasn't said that I don't know about \u2013 I think he should apologise, apologise in full, he's done that \u2013 and [then] draw a line under it in that way.\"</p> <p>But Clegg was highly critical of Mitchell. \"I think that civility, being courteous to the police is important at all times. But of course it's especially important given the tragic events \u2013 the killing of Fiona Bone and Nicola Hughes. So what Andrew Mitchell did was wrong, very wrong. He knows that and he's apologised to the police and explained himself and I think he was right to do so.\"</p> <p>Tim Farron, the Lib Dem president, told Sky News that Mitchell's remarks were \"utterly, utterly dreadful\".</p>",

Correct me if I'm wrong but I do believe that's why we're all here in the first place. Good.</p> <p>There are probably better sides to be facing when you're still looking for your first league win than Manchester United but that's the challenge facing Liverpool this afternoon. It has not been an easy start to life for Brendan Rodgers at Anfield, for while his side have passed the ball daintily, their approach has not been accompanied by the requisite punch up front, a familiar failing for Liverpool. They have only managed three goals in their first four games and two of those have come from set-pieces, the other from a Titus Bramble assist. Just as worrying are the defensive mistakes and the comedy stylings of Pepe the Clown in goal. </p> <p>Yet Liverpool do come into this game on the back of a hot one-game winning streak, following their ripsnorting 5-3 win over Young Boys in the Europa League on Thursday, and they do tend to save their very best form for this fixture. United, who have not made a wholly convincing start to the season, do not like coming to Anfield. It spooks them. In recent years, they have been bullied here, largely because of their lack of a midfield, and they have not won at Liverpool since a Carlos Tevez goal gave them a 1-0 victory in December 2007. If Liverpool can add controlled aggression to their passing game, then United could be in for an uncomfortable afternoon. Having said that Liverpool have won just twice at home in the league this year and United have Robin van Persie up front, while Liverpool have: </p> <p><strong>Kick-off:</strong> 1.30pm.</p> <!-- Block 2 --> <p><strong>Team news.</strong> Apart from the absence of the injured Lucas, Liverpool are at full strength in midfield, where Jonjo Shelvey is preferred to Nuri Sahin. For Manchester United, Nemanja Vidic is spared his inevitable Anfield red card by a mystery injury, so Jonny Evans partners Rio Ferdinand in central defence. David De Gea, who was excellent against Galatasaray in midweek, is surprisingly replaced by Anders Lindegaard in goal, while Ryan Giggs will be anonymous in the centre of midfield.</p> <p><strong>Liverpool (4-3-3):</strong> Reina; Kelly, Skrtel, Agger, Johnson; Allen, Gerrard, Shelvey; Borini, Suarez, Sterling. <strong>Subs:</strong> Jones, Enrique, Sahin, Assaidi, Henderson, Carragher, Suso.</p> <p><strong>Manchester United (4-2-3-1):</strong> Lindegaard; Rafael, Evans, Ferdinand, Evra; Carrick, Giggs; Valencia, Kagawa, Nani; Van Persie. <strong>Subs:</strong> De Gea, Anderson, Hernandez, Welbeck, Scholes, Cleverley, Buttner.</p> <p><strong>Referee:</strong> Mark Halsey.</p> <!-- Block 3 -->  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396551433\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Football/Pix/pictures/2012/9/23/1348402168802/Liverpool-v-Manchester-Un-001.jpg\" alt=\"Liverpool v Manchester United\" width=\"140\" height=\"84\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Oh Giggsy!

What a double act! They could take this show on the road, though it's not clear who's the Morecambe and who's the Wise.</p> <!-- Block 5 -->       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/wtaScFDcFBk?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/wtaScFDcFBk\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p><strong>Phil Podolsky sends in Jose delivering some home truths for Liverpool.</strong> \"They're not the best team in the Premiership. Not even close.\"</p> <!-- Block 6 --> <p><strong>\"That United midfield is absurd,\" blasts Samuel Scott-Moncrieff.</strong> \"I'm beginning to think Ferguson's aversion to combative midfielders who might give us an iota of presence at hostile away grounds is psychological. In exchange for one or two ball winners, tacklers, players who won't crumble immediately under the outpouring of Anfield grief, I would gladly do without van Persie. Going to lose today. And yes i know vaguely applicable midfielders are unavailable, Fletcher being ill, Jones injured, Anderson pants etc.\"</p> <!-- Block 7 --> <p><strong>Word is that Nemanja Vidic is being rested.</strong> Which is strange. Anyway the teams are in the tunnel. They're both wearing red tracksuit tops. United's has \"96\" on the back. Out come the players to a strangely muted atmopshere.</p> <!-- Block 8 --> <p><strong>HANDSHAKE LATEST:</strong> Patrice Evra and Luis Suarez shake hands without any fuss at all. And let that be the end of it. \"That Jose Mourinho's a pretty smart bloke; who'd have ever thought Liverpool wouldn't win the league this season because their team isn't good enough,\" says Rob Moline. \"No wonder Florentino Perez was so keen to snap him up. As in... he used to be good value being controversial or just a bit of an idiot, when did he become so bland?\"</p> <!-- Block 9 --> <p><strong>Sir Bobby Charlton walks on to the pitch to present flowers to Ian Rush in recognition of the Hillsborough disaster.</strong> Ryan Giggs and Steven Gerrard then release 96 balloons as the Kop bellows \"Justice for the 96\". The fans in The Kop then hold up a mosaic. The message is simple: \"THE TRUTH\".</p> <!-- Block 10 --> <p><strong>And as You'll Never Walk Alone ends, the game begins.</strong> United, in their white shirts and black shorts, kick off. They're attacking the Kop in the first half, though I'm not sure if the Liverpool fans are paying too much attention yet. They're still chanting \"Justice for the 96\". It's loud but there's an eerie atmosphere around Anfield.</p> <!-- Block 11 --> <p><strong>2 min:</strong> And now, finally, a roar. \"Yup, you're right about United's \"lack of a midfield\" being the root cause of many of their recent problems at Anfield: see, eg, the game at Anfield in the league in Rafa's otherwise abysmal last season in charge when Lucas simply harried the ball off the ancient Scholes, drove at the United goal and put Kuyt through only for the Dutchman to blast wide in classic Kuyt-style,\" says SB Tang. \"Not sure if Liverpool will be able to make United pay to the requisite degree for starting Giggs in central midfield today though. In the absence of Lucas, we don't have a real terrier in midfield. And United will have the mobile, hardworking Kagawa dropping back to help out when they lose the ball ...\"</p> <!-- Block 12 --> <p><strong>3 min:</strong> United are dominating possession in these early stages, albeit without really going anywhere. That's often been the case at Anfield in recent years.</p> <!-- Block 13 --> <p><strong>4 min:</strong> Young Sterling, the father of three children at the tender age of 17, gets his first chance to run at Patrice Evra. He might be experienced in some regards but he's still a fresh-faced youth on the pitch and Evra quickly steps in to nick the ball off him.</p> <!-- Block 14 --> <p><strong>5 min:</strong> Three children at 17 though.</p> <!-- Block 15 --> <p><strong>6 min:</strong> Liverpool win the first corner of the match, Johnson's cross deflected behind by Rafael. They take it short but Gerrard's fine cross is headed away firmly by Rafael.</p> <!-- Block 16 --> <p><strong>7 min:</strong> Liverpool win the first corner, United have the first shot. Kagawa finds Giggs on the edge of the area and he cuts across the ball with his left foot - rather like Xavi against Granada last night - and his shot fizzes just past the angle of post and bar. By way of response, Liverpool go right up the other end, Sterling playing a neat pass down the inside-right channel for Suarez. He turns a cross-shot into the area that Lindegaard parries out rather shakily, forcing Rafael to head away from Borini, doing superbly not to score an own goal. Gerrard tries to turn home the rebound but Evans is on hand to boot clear. More please!</p> <!-- Block 17 --> <p><strong>9 min:</strong> Half of the ground thought this was in. The impressive Sterling won another corner on the right. Shelvey cut the ball back low to Gerrard, whose low drive fizzed past the right post and into the side-netting, creating the illusion that he had beaten Lindegaard. Sadly not. United were nearly caught out in similar fashion by Galatasaray on Wednesay. You'd think they'd be wise to that ruse by now.</p> <!-- Block 18 --> <p><strong>12 min:</strong> \"I think Ferguson has dug his heels in on the midfield issue,\" says Mark Judd. \"He knows what everyone else knows but is too stubborn to admit it. Buy Cheik Tiote in January.\" They do look very lightweight at the moment. Liverpool are the more cohesive side.</p> <!-- Block 19 --> <p><strong>13 min:</strong> The buccaneering Johnson tumbles under a challenge from Rafael on the left but Mark Halsey waves away his appeals for a free-kick. He accepts the decision with equanimity. Just as well, seeing as it wasn't a foul.</p> <!-- Block 20 --> <p><strong>14 min:</strong> Liverpool are making chances. Liverpool aren't taking chances. What's new? Suarez pierces the shambles masquerading as the United defence with a pass through to Borini. He's clean through on goal and should score but his first touch is utterly dreadful, taking him away from goal. In the end, all he can do is try to turn it across goal but too many United defenders are back. The young Italian gets an earful from Suarez and Gerrard for his sloppiness. Andy Carroll definitely would have scored that. Maybe.</p> <!-- Block 21 --> <p><strong>16 min:</strong> You know who would have scored that? Steven Fletcher. What a brilliantly instinctive finisher he is.</p> <!-- Block 22 --> <p><strong>17 min:</strong> It's all Liverpool. Joe Allen does this really neat thing. He passes the ball to a team-mate.</p> <!-- Block 23 --> <p><strong>19 min:</strong> A quick look at the possession stats reveals that Liverpool have had 64% of it. But they're yet to turn it into a goal which is, of course, supposedly the object of all this.</p> <!-- Block 24 --> <p><strong>20 min:</strong> Liverpool have had three corners to United's nice round zero. Gerrard curls it in from the left but Van Persie heads away at the near post. That might be the first time he's touched it.</p> <!-- Block 25 --> <p><strong>21 min:</strong> Liverpool continue to turn the screw though and from Van Persie's clearance, Gerrard curls a delicious inswinging cross into the box from the left. Agger collapses with Evans keeping a close hold on him but Mark Halsey says no penalty despite loud appeals. There's a stoppage in play, meanwhile, as Rio Ferdinand gets treatment for an injury. Worryingly United's only defensive option on the bench is the inexperienced left-back Alex Buttner.</p> <!-- Block 26 --> <p><strong>23 min:</strong> Ferdinand is back on the pitch but he's still limping. That decision to rest Vidic is looking curiouser and curiouser.</p> <!-- Block 27 --> <p><strong>24 min:</strong> \"I don't disagree with your assessment of Steven Fletcher, but it's a pity he is either too stupid to too stubborn to admit when he's made a mistake,\" says Simon McMahon. \"Maybe he should give Nick Clegg a call as well as Craig Levein.\"</p> <!-- Block 28 --> <p><strong>25 min:</strong> <strong>UNITED GET INTO LIVERPOOL'S HALF!!!!!!!!</strong></p> <!-- Block 29 --> <p><strong>26 min:</strong> Nani wallops a free-kick well over the bar from 35 yards out. Maybe he shouldn't take the set pieces for a while.</p> <!-- Block 30 --> <p><strong>27 min:</strong> Suarez tries a cute chip into the top-right corner from the edge of the area but his aim is awry.</p> <!-- Block 31 --> <p><strong>28 min:</strong> Suarez is so frustrating at times. He got clear on the left side of the area and was faced by two United defenders. Suddenly memories of his mesmeric run against United in March 2011 came flooding back so instead of just crossing it, he tried to diddle his way past Ferdinand, who stands up and gets a foot in to howls of annoyance from the home fans.</p> <!-- Block 32 --> <p><strong>32 min:</strong> The increasingly erratic Evra goes steaming through the back of Sterling as the young winger nicked the ball past the United full-back <em>inches</em> outside the area on the right. Dear me, that was woeful defending. Evra escapes with a final warning, though.</p> <!-- Block 33 --> <p><strong>33 min:</strong> Gerrard whips the free-kick into the area from the right, but Suarez gets too much on his header when it needed to be a glance and the ball flies behind for a goal-kick.</p> <!-- Block 34 --> <p><strong>34 min:</strong> Suarez threatens again. He scampers into the area from the left but his fierce shot is deflected behind by Ferdinand, who looks to be back in full working order again. The corner comes to nothing.</p> <!-- Block 35 --> <p><strong>35 min:</strong> They say managers have to be brave and you have to admire Sir Alex Ferguson's courage in not picking a midfield today.</p> <!-- Block 36 --> <p><strong>37 min:</strong> Kelly bursts down the right, unimpeded by anything as novel as a tackle from a United player. His cross is cut out by Evans but then Nani helpfully picks out Sterling on the edge of the area. He jinks past one challenge but his left-footed shot is blocked by a United defender. United are awful.</p> <!-- Block 37 --> <p><strong>39 min:</strong> <strong>LIVERPOOL PRESS THE SELF-DESTRUCT BUTTON!</strong> JONJO SHELVEY IS SENT OFF! All that dominance and now they're down to 10 men. Shelvey had an inexplicable rush of blood to the head here as he got too excited after tackling Ryan Giggs. He then rushed to challenge Evans but his studs were up and he caught him with his right boot. The strange thing about this incident is the way Evans went into the 50-50 wasn't exactly great either. A split-second later and he could have been the one sent off. Mark Halsey took his time to make his mind up but there was a certain inevitability to Shelvey going.</p> <!-- Block 38 --> <p><strong>40 min:</strong> After getting treatment, Evans comes back on to loud boos from the Liverpool fans. For the crime of being kicked.</p> <!-- Block 39 --> <p><strong>41 min:</strong> But despite only having 10 men, still Liverpool press. They win a free-kick after a push from Ferdinand 30 yards from goal. Suarez takes it and demands a good save from Lindegaard, the Dane diving to his right to push the effort away. Liverpool are very much in this, mainly because United have been so poor.</p> <!-- Block 40 --> <p><strong>44 min:</strong> \"How does the player with both feet off the ground stay on the pitch, and the one with one foot on the ground get a straight red!?\" says Simon Brereton. This is what I mean about Evans's part in this. You're not going to see both players sent off in an incident like that though. That said, Evans got lucky.</p> <!-- Block 41 --> <p><strong>45 min:</strong> As Shelvey walked off, he had a pop at Ferguson, pointing at him and effin' and jeffin'. Ferguson, naturally, did not take it in good spirit meaning Shelvey has become the first non-United player to be on the end of the hairdryer treatment. You can bet the United players are going to be in for a rollicking at half time too. Their performance is still miserable. Borini gets clear down the left but his inviting cut-back is put behind by Evra. Where was Suarez? That cross was begging to be tapped in. To think that Michael Owen's at Stoke.</p> <!-- Block 42 --> <p><strong>Half time: Liverpool 0-0 Manchester United.</strong> Boos greet the half time whistle following Jonjo Shelvey's red card. Manchester United have been thrashed 0-0 but Liverpool are down to 10 men. Surely United can't be so lethargic against the second half, especially with the one-man advantage. Liverpool should be ahead but once again they haven't taken their chances and they could end up paying for it.</p> <!-- Block 43 --> <p><strong>Half time emails.</strong></p> <p>\"Fergie's tactics appear to be to pick 10 idiots and assume that Van Persie will inevitably nick it when someone from Liverpool gets sent off,\" says Alec Cochrane. \"Rodgers tactics are to get it out wide and cross it in for Andy Carroll, with only one fatal flaw.\"</p> <p>\"It was a badly judged lunge from Shelvey, but replays showed Evans had both feet leading into it as well,\" says Matt Dony.</p> <p>\"On Halsey's red against Shelvey: that was as bad a decision as his subsequently rescinded red against Huddlestone,\" says SB Tang.</p> <p>\"Ferguson's bizarre selections suggest a man who is bored of winning, &amp; now wants to handicap himself to keep the challenge interesting,\" says Simon Frank. \"Remarkably few top, top, top, top, players for this massive, massive game.\"</p> <p>\"I think that crime being booed is that Evans was also studs up (see the replay, he catches Shelvey just as badly) and then rolled around like a chubby fella in a oil wrestling match,\" says Josh Collis. \"Still Shelvey ingratiated himself to all LFC fans by shouting a lot at Ferguson on the way off. A future star.\"</p> <p>\"Liverpool are awfully fired up for this game, Shelvey being sent off as a consequence of their high pressing, aggressive approach going too far,\" says David Jerome. \"Despite their team playing well however their fans have behaved disgracefully on a day that is supposed to be about reconciliation, booing Evra for being racially abused and Evans for being the victim of a challenge? Sort it out Liverpool.\" </p> <p>\"What in name of Jehova is the ref doing?\" says Rolf Mellander. \"That's a 50-50 challenge. Shelvey is doing exactly what Evans is doing. Both red or no red. Clown of a referee.\"</p> <!-- Block 44 --> <p><strong>The red card.</strong> Both players were out of control, Jonny Evans going in two-footed as well. On Sky, Gary Neville suggests that both players should have been sent off, so a booking for both might have sufficed.</p> <!-- Block 45 --> <p><strong>At this juncture, let us remind ourselves of Xabi Alonso's thoughts on tackling.</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I don't think tackling is a quality. It is a recurso, something you have to resort to, not a characteristic of your game. At Liverpool I used to read the matchday programme and you'd read an interview with a lad from the youth team. They'd ask: age, heroes, strong points, etc. He'd reply: 'Shooting and tackling'. I can't get into my head that football development would educate tackling as a quality, something to learn, to teach, a characteristic of your play. How can that be a way of seeing the game? I just don't understand football in those terms. Tackling is a [last] resort, and you will need it, but it isn't a quality to aspire to, a definition. It's hard to change because it's so rooted in the English football culture, but I don't understand it.\"</p> </blockquote> <!-- Block 46 --> <p><strong>46 min:</strong> Off we go again. Both sides have made changes, Liverpool introducing the young Spanish midfielder Suso for Borini and United introducing the Not Young midfielder Paul Scholes for the miserably ineffective Nani. And...</p> <!-- Block 47 --> <p><strong>GOAL! Liverpool 1-0 Manchester United (Gerrard, 46 min):</strong> Could it have been anyone else? Suso made an instant impact after his introduction off the bench, gloriously jinking past Scholes on the left before sending a cross that was headed away by Ferdinand. United were dawdling on the edge of the area though and Johnson charged on to the loose ball, before juggling it into the area. He couldn't keep control of it but it came to Gerrard and he chested it down before waiting for it to drop and smashing a low volley into the bottom right corner as United stood and watched. The 10 men have the lead and don't they deserve it.</p> <!-- Block 48 --> <p><strong>48 min:</strong> Liverpool thoroughly merit this lead. There aren't many better players than Steven Gerrard when it comes to the big occasions, although that hasn't always been the case in recent years.</p> <!-- Block 49 --> <p><strong>50 min:</strong> The inevitable pressure from United. Van Persie swings in a cross from the left and Johnson gets a bit lucky that his header back across his own area doesn't fall to a United player. I fancy this is going to be a long 40 minutes for Liverpool.</p> <!-- Block 50 --> <p><strong>GOAL! Liverpool 1-1 Manchester United (Rafael, 51 min):</strong> What a goal this is from Rafael. Liverpool's goal has given United the kick up the backside they needed and they're level straight away. They were just starting to turn the screw and were enjoying their first period of sustained pressure when Rafael struck. There didn't look to be too much danger as Kagawa chested Valencia's cross down to Rafael, but the right-back took a touch and then bent a stunning left-footed curler into the far corner off the inside of the post. Reina didn't have a chance.</p> <!-- Block 51 --> <p><strong>53 min:</strong> Valencia scampers down the right flank and wins a corner off Johnson. United are well on top at the moment. Van Persie sends the corner in and Valencia heads over and wide.</p> <!-- Block 52 --> <p><strong>54 min:</strong> Liverpool aren't going to sit back and just let United come at them. First a raking long pass finds Sterling in behind Evra on the right of the area. He takes too long to shoot though and his eventual cross is headed away. It comes out to Gerrard whose shot is straight at Lindegaard.</p> <!-- Block 53 --> <p><strong>55 min:</strong> Carrick slides a pass through to Van Persie, who's clear in the middle of the area. He's off balance though and slips as he goes to shoot. No penalty, despite the appeals for one.</p> <!-- Block 54 --> <p><strong>57 min:</strong> Now it's Liverpool's turn to cry for a penalty as Suarez leaps through the air \u2013 9.5 say the judges! \u2013 after a challenge from Evans. He doesn't really help himself at times, does he?</p> <!-- Block 55 --> <p><strong>59 min:</strong> Try to contain your shock: Paul Scholes has been booked for a foul on Sterling.</p> <!-- Block 56 --> <p><strong>59 min:</strong> A rapier United counterattack ends with Evra's low cross from the left going behind Van Persie. It might not be too long before we see either Hernandez or Welbeck introduced to partner Van Persie. Kagawa hasn't done very much.</p> <!-- Block 57 --> <p><strong>61 min:</strong> Lindegaard makes an outstanding save to stop Suarez restoring Liverpool's lead. He darted in from the right to make space for the shot and then curled a low effort towards the bottom left corner. Lindegaard got a strong hand to it. By the way, United have scored with their only shot on target.</p> <!-- Block 58 --> <p><strong>63 min:</strong> Van Persie heads Carrick's cross well over. He was under a lot of pressure though. He's still feeding off scraps.</p> <!-- Block 59 --> <p><strong>65 min:</strong> Despite having 10 men, Liverpool are still the superior side. Suarez breaches the United defence again and this time rolls the ball back to Suso, whose clipped effort from, 15 yards out is pushed over by Lindegaard. If they could finish, Liverpool would be a very good side.</p> <!-- Block 60 --> <p><strong>66 min:</strong> Liverpool make their second change, Jordan Henderson replacing Raheem Sterling. Patrice Evra breathes a sigh of relief.</p> <!-- Block 61 --> <p><strong>68 min:</strong> United are so listless. It's as if they don't want to win it. \"The dive by Suarez had all the elements and his form was impeccable<br>but for sheer audacity I am still giving the dive of the week to Ivanovic against Stoke yesterday,\" says JR in Illinois. For sheer audacity, nothing beats <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyoRoLdWCWU\">this</a>.</p> <!-- Block 62 --> <p><strong>69 min:</strong> Suso slips a pass through to Suarez but his cross-shot from a tight angle on the right flashes across goal and, er, out for a throw-in.</p> <!-- Block 63 --> <p><strong>72 min:</strong> There is no coherence to the United attacks. Liverpool are comfortable in defence. The only reason they're not winning is because of a wonder goal from United's right-back.</p> <!-- Block 64 --> <p><strong>76 min:</strong> <strong>PENALTY TO MANCHESTER UNITED!</strong> Out of nowhere Valencia beats Agger and Johnson to a loose ball on the halfway line and steams off upfield with Liverpool completely exposed. He tries to take it past Skrtel but just as he goes to shoot from six yards out, Johnson gets back and clips his heels. Reina is booked for his protests. Will Van Persie dink it?</p> <!-- Block 65 --> <p><strong>77 min:</strong> There's a delay before Van Persie can take the penalty as Agger gets treatment for the injury he suffered when Valencia stole possession. On second glance, Liverpool might feel the penalty was soft - the contact was so light \u2013 although the fact that Johnson didn't appeal was telling, I suppose.</p> <!-- Block 66 --> <p><strong>79 min:</strong> Agger is going to have to go off on a stretcher. He looks to have hurt his foot. It was a poor pass from Suso, the impressive youngster, who put Liverpool into trouble. He'll learn.</p> <!-- Block 67 --> <p><strong>80 min:</strong> Agger, clutching his left leg, is taken off on a stretcher and on comes Carragher. Van Persie has had four minutes to think about this penalty. He's going to chip it, isn't he?</p> <!-- Block 68 --> <p><strong>GOAL! Liverpool 1-2 Manchester United (Van Persie pen, 81 min):</strong> United had missed their last three penalties. They almost missed this one too, Reina getting a hand to Van Persie's penalty but it was hit too firmly into the top-right corner. United have not come from behind to win at Anfield since 1952. This is a complete mugging.</p> <!-- Block 69 --> <p><strong>82 min:</strong> Javier Hernandez replaces the disappointing Shinji Kagawa.</p> <!-- Block 70 --> <p><strong>83 min:</strong> What a chance. Johnson looks to make amends with a cross from the left and Kelly beats both Evra and Evans to the ball but heads it wide of the right post from six yards out. What a chance.</p> <!-- Block 71 --> <p><strong>84 min:</strong> The Liverpool supporters are up in arms after a studs-up challenge from Van Persie on Suso. He's booked. It wasn't too different from the challenge Shelvey was sent off. \"Everyone saying pen because Johnson didn't complain,\" says Niall Mullen. \"Everyone should scream at the ref then?\" You'd complain if you knew you hadn't touched him.</p> <!-- Block 72 --> <p><strong>86 min:</strong> \"Mind explaining why Johnson not appealing is telling - do you think Halsey would have changed his mind?\" says Steve Bowden. \"Reina was booked for protesting - does that make it definitely wrong?\" Because Johnson was the one penalised so probably has a better idea than Reina. For what it's worth, I want to see it again. The contact, if there was any, looked very soft.</p> <!-- Block 73 --> <p><strong>88 min:</strong> There's going to be a lot of stoppage time, of course. The delay before Van Persie took his penalty was four minutes and there will be more than that added on.</p> <!-- Block 74 --> <p><strong>89 min:</strong> Danny Welbeck replaces the hobbling Rafael. Presumably Valencia will go to right-back. \"Did nobody take into account that Johnson probably didn't complain because he was lying on the ground in pain having taken a knee to the chest from Reina during the penalty incident?\" says David Flynn. \"Whether he agreed or didn't he had other things on his mind, like trying to breathe.\"</p> <!-- Block 75 --> <p><strong>90 min:</strong> There will be five minutes of added time.</p> <!-- Block 76 --> <p><strong>90 min+2:</strong> Mark Halsey is not endearing himself to the locals. United have a free-kick after a foul by Henderson on Evans. \"Sorry to ruin the fun,\" says Benedict Simmons. \"His response was the mark of a man who knew he'd fudged it for his team. He just lay on the ground. He went to ground on the halfway line, then got into a position which would let the ref get conned by Valencia and there was nothing he could to about it.\"</p> <!-- Block 77 --> <p><strong>90 min+3:</strong> All is not going to plan for Liverpool. Now Martin Kelly is down injured. I can't believe they're not going to win this match. They probably should have signed a striker in the summer. I'm not yet sure that Borini counts.</p> <!-- Block 78 --> <p><strong>90 min+5:</strong> Hernandez's weak effort is snaffled by Reina. One last attack for Liverpool now. Reina will launch it long. Andy Carroll might have been useful in this situation.</p> <!-- Block 79 --> <p><strong>90 min+7:</strong> Mark Halsey is not a popular man. Ferdinand goes through the back of Suarez on the edge of area. Play continues.</p> <!-- Block 80 --> <p><strong>Full time: Liverpool 1-2 Manchester United.</strong> After one of their worst performances in recent memory, Manchester United have their first victory at Anfield since 2007 and move up to second in the table. The victory papers over the cracks in this side though, because for long periods they were absolutely dire. Yet they got the rub of the green with the refereeing decisions, which means they leave with the points. Somehow Liverpool end a match they dominated from start to finish empty-handed.

However, the move by the UKBA still ultimately threatens thousands of students with deportation, along with the future viability of London Met as a public entity.</p> <p>The past few weeks have demonstrated both that a serious and concerted campaign is capable of delivering results, and that the government has always been more interested in pursuing its ideological agenda in higher education than in protecting students \u2013 effectively using London Met as test case in its market experiment.</p> <p>While London Met and the National Union of Students were <a href=\"http://www.nus.org.uk/en/news/news/nus-announces-independent-intervention-in-london-met-international-student-legal-action/\" title=\"\">launching legal battles</a> to keep students at the institution, private colleges have been circling around, <a href=\"http://www.regents.ac.uk/default.aspx?page=2023\" title=\"\">running open days</a> in the hope of taking displaced students, and the universities minister, David Willetts, last week <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2012/sep/13/willetts-uk-reputation-foreign-student-visas?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">announced a package of \u00a32m</a> in hardship funds for \"legitimate students\" affected by the situation.</p> <p>Far from being a cause for celebration, these moves by the government represent the latest in a cynically presented official narrative around the London Met case: that the government, and the set of private providers now swarming around London Met, are working to alleviate the situation for students left stranded by the incompetence of the university's management. The truth is that the government is exploiting the situation at London Met in order to further its own objectives.</p> <p>London Met is already at the heart of the coalition's experiment, in which massive cuts to public teaching grants are forcing institutions to seek private income streams. Having implemented a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2011/jun/13/london-met-cuts-hammer-blow-creativity\" title=\"\">70% cut to its courses</a> in 2011, including the loss of whole departments such as history and philosophy, the university's management <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2012/aug/14/london-metropolitan-university-outsourcing-plan\" title=\"\">announced last month</a> that it would seek a large-scale privatisation deal \u2013 essentially a corporate buyout of much of its central services.</p> <p>The essential theme of the higher education white paper, much of which is now being brought into effect without a vote in parliament, was the creation of a market \u2013 with private providers allowed to operate, and public universities allowed to go to the wall if they cannot make ends meet. The social consequences of this project will be dire: it is precisely the universities that working-class students rely on that will be forced to merge, or even to close entirely.</p> <p>Like almost all higher education institutions, London Met has come increasingly to rely on international students, whose fees are uncapped. Without this income the university will struggle to survive, and, predictably, the government's new approach to the crisis does nothing to address the insolvency that London Met faces as a result of the UKBA's decision. Instead, Willetts is focused on moving London Met's international students on to other institutions, while \"protecting Britain's reputation\" in the global higher education market.</p> <p>The government's emphasis on making Britain an appealing destination for international students goes beyond the poor taste of viewing people, and their contributions to academia and society, as cash cows and cogs in a market mechanism. It is also dishonest and cynical: the situation at London Met is in large part a product of an increasingly draconian set of visa and immigration restrictions now being used by the Home Office to <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-2196055/London-Metropolitan-University-crisis-Visas-sham-courses-bogus-students.html\" title=\"\">\"send a message\" about \"bogus students.\"</a></p> <p>Over the past few years international students have faced repeated attacks on their ability to study and work in the UK \u2013 as well as paying increasingly astronomical fees, they are required to register at police stations, carry biometric ID and to have their attendance monitored constantly by their institution and the UKBA. In April, the government abolished the post-study work visa \u2013 effectively forcing many international students to leave the country.</p> <p>London Met is not alone in struggling to meet visa monitoring requirements: in a number of prestigious Russell Group universities, staff will privately admit that cuts to registry departments have made them effectively negligent. The effects of a curtailment order in this context are expressly political \u2013 the coalition is refusing to intervene to save the institution from bankruptcy because, unlike the universities that its own sons and daughters attend, London Met has become a target for the government's market experiment in higher education.</p> <p>Ultimately, this chaotic, money-driven experience is not confined to international students. With the rapid extension of the market across the system, this is the government's vision for everyone in higher education. Events at London Met are once again proving to be a crucial and symbolic battleground for the future of education as a whole. Everyone who believes in preserving education as a public service must be willing to take action \u2013 in the courts and on the streets.</p>",
  "<p>I was a pupil at <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marist_Brothers_College_Rosalie\">Marist Brothers College Rosalie</a> in Brisbane, Queensland Australia, a school set up to educate working class boys. My first motivation to teach was Gerard DeSilva, my history teacher and my form tutor. Every time he opened his mouth I felt inspired; he gave me my academic and intellectual hook on which to hang nostalgia.</p> <p>My second motivation was my father. He really struggled in school. In every classroom I've ever taught in I've looked for him, the kid who's struggling, the kid who doesn't understand and is unhappy. But I suppose the real reason I teach is ideological. I'm doing something that's not driven by making a profit but to help people. The Marist Brothers who taught me had a genuine vocation for teaching. I guess I wanted to be that person too.</p> <p>I was about 15 years old when I first realised teaching was for me. The school arranged work experience for me to spend two weeks in a primary school just outside Brisbane. It was confronting. I'd come from a settled home and, for the first time, I met kids who were experiencing domestic violence. I had no way of comprehending it at that age. It really got to me initially in a negative way but then developed into a positive angle - I realised there was a battle to be won to help children. In year 12 I resolved to do a BA in history and then my PGDipEd. It was very tough going and I remember by the October (that's the end of term not the beginning in Australia) I was suffering burn out. I was holding down a part-time job too as duty manager of a supermarket, doing my teaching practice and the course. It was intense.</p> <p>I was lucky to get a job straight away at <a href=\"http://www.tmc.qld.edu.au/joomla/\">Tamborine Mountain College</a> which had been set up by the principal just three years before in response to a need for a school - prior to that kids had to be bussed off the mountain. It was an idyllic place on the Gold Coast hinterland. I got the job because in the middle of the interview the principal started insulting my old school. I went for him and defended the school vigorously. So I got the job. He wanted someone who would be passionate about his school - most of the interviewees had agreed with him when he'd tried a similar tactic. I stayed working at the school for five years and during that time the school tripled in size. I learned an awful lot there about meaningful behaviour change and the importance of community. But I left when my year 8s got to year 12. It seemed the right thing to do to leave with them and besides I'd reached a personal crossroads of sorts.</p> <p>I then got a job in the UK at Thamesbridge College in Reading (now <a href=\"http://www.johnmadejskiacademy.co.uk/\">John Madjeski Academy</a>) it was as rough as guts in those days. So I went from having tiny classes and biddable children who would do anything I asked them to classes that seemed full of children with behaviour issues ranging from willful disobedience to vicious violence. For the first three weeks as my bus drew up to the school I felt sick; I had to literally fight down the vomit. But things began to normalise and I realised I could do it. I was actually assaulted by one child who wanted to hit some kids who had locked themselves in a room. I said: \"If you want to get to them you are going to have to hit me.\" So he did. He smacked me across the face. I've never experienced anything like that in my life and I've been hit by men. My first thought was \"don't cry.\" But I said: \"I'll let you have that but if it happens again I'll fight back.\" I didn't take it further because I'd asked him to hit me, and he came to apologise to me later on. It ended up that his mother worked as a prostitute and those kids had been mocking him for that. I met the best teachers I've ever encountered at that school \u2013 some of them had taught there for as long as I'd been alive.</p> <p>I have found that kids really enjoy having someone from an international background as their teacher, especially more deprived kids. It's a really positive factor for them and offers an avenue of aspiration. After Thamesbridge, I went on to become head of year and head of RE at John Hunt of Everest school in Basingstoke, it was another deprived area and there was at that time a real influx of Polish immigrants into the UK. Lots of kids were bitching about immigrants. I asked: \"So are you saying that immigrants shouldn't be allowed into the country?\" \"Yes\" they said. \"Well, that's me\". There was silence. I hope I helped them realise immigration can have a positive effect.</p> <p>I've also taught in Parma, Italy. I was a chaperone for a group of year 12 students from Tamborine to <a href=\"http://www.convittomarialuigia.pr.it/\">Convitto Nazionale Maria Luigia</a>. I taught English there and did a bit of rugby coaching for two months. It was a great experience although I went home two and a half stone heavier. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/oliver\">Jamie Oliver</a> would have swooned over their canteen, beautiful homecooked Italian food and half a bottle of wine each for the teachers. After lunch, we had a little kip - heaven.</p> <p>As part of a fellowship I received from the <a href=\"http://www.wcmt.org.uk/\">Winston Churchill Memorial Trust</a> (WMCT) fellowship, I've also worked with schools in Norway. I saw there how use of small steps to develop pupil motivation really worked. When you work in other countries and see how things are done you find these little tidbits to share with colleagues and work on. It's the beauty of working internationally.</p> <p>Poverty is a huge issue for me and it's something I've focused throughout my career. Just before I got my current job I worked in the National Strategies for the DCSF focusing on inclusion and outcomes for young people from poor backgrounds. I'm extremely worried about the pupil premium which sounds good on paper but when everything is taken into account, for example less central support, it actually works out as less money for poor children. It seems our new coalition government has a lack of desire to use best practice from the labour government which is really unhelpful.</p> <p>One thing working and researching in other countries has taught me is you can't export an idea without thinking about contextual deprivation and social/economic gaps. For example we think of Norway as being more equal because it's a wealthy society. But it's terrible to be poor in Norway. If the poverty is hidden those people are not going to get support that they need. They're not getting free school meals, they go under the radar. You have to take each school, each pupil and help accordingly. You would spend a pupil premium differently in Australia to how you'd spend it in Reading. That's why pupil data is so important.</p> <p>You have to recognise the differences in countries, that's what working internationally teaches you. The idea that what works in Finland will work in the UK is laughable. The idea you can take one solution and follow it without critique is never going to work. Poverty is like sunshine, it's different in different parts of the world, in different part of the country. There are certain truisms that apply all over such as the link between self efficacy and success. And that's particularly true from children from less wealthy backgrounds. Some things are always true but how you apply that is key. That's something Mr Gove hasn't quite got his head around yet.</p> <p>A better idea is for the teaching workforce to be allowed to reflect on their practice and their pupils and from what I've seen I don't think Ofsted is going to be the one to help teachers do this.</p> <p>I'm now principal at <a href=\"http://www.trinity-school.org.uk/\">Trinity Catholic School</a> in Leamington. I'm a devout Catholic but have never taught in a Catholic School so it's a wonderful opportunity. We've just had our most successful GCSE and A-level results and it's such an exciting time for the school. It's funny though, I can remember driving with my friends from teacher training college after doing a teaching pracs in a really tough school <a href=\"http://bremershs.eq.edu.au/wcms/\">Bremer State High School</a> in Ipswich, Australia. In the second week we all agreed how much we loved it, how much we loved the classroom. I remember saying I'd never want to be headteacher, what an awful, awful job it was all those boring meetings, not being in classroom. But now I'm here doing it - and loving it.</p> <p>I think teaching is a vocation for anyone who genuinely loves teaching. If you feel alive and have a sense of belonging when you stand in front of a class of 30 children then never stop.</p> <p><em>Chris Gabbett is principal of <a href=\"http://www.trinity-school.org.uk/\">Trinity Catholic School</a> in Leamington.
