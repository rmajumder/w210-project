  "<p>A scorching morning in the San Fernando valley and I am driving up and down Balboa Boulevard, parks and fields either side of the motorway, lost. The talking GPS on my dashboard has lapsed into silence, defeated by an arcane destination with no zip code. I spy a park attendant emptying a bin and pull over to ask directions. He eyes me, baffled. I wonder if he is deaf and repeat the question. He still looks confused. \"Did you say river?\" Yes, I reply. Where is the river? He shakes his head. \"What&#xa0;river?\"</p> <p>I find an elderly woman with a straw hat walking her terrier and ask the same question. She looks puzzled. \"What river, honey?\" The river I am supposed to kayak, I reply. She looks at me compassionately, as if I have sunstroke. \"I don't think you're in the right&#xa0;place.\"</p> <p>But I am. Swishing below, all but invisible from the park and motorway above, is the Los Angeles river. A river with water, fish, tadpoles, birds, reeds, banks, a river that flows for 52 miles skirting Burbank, north Hollywood, Silver Lake, downtown and Compton and empties into the Pacific Ocean at Long Beach. A regular river, except that to most Angelenos it's a secret. I&#xa0;ask three other people and receive the same blank looks until finally a park ranger confirms that, yes, there is a river at the bottom of a ravine all of 150ft away.</p> <p>There, amid the reeds, bob a dozen little green and red kayaks, and people wearing helmets and lifejackets are clambering inside them. It is the inaugural season of <a href=\"http://lariverexpeditions.com/\" title=\"\">LA River Expeditions</a>, a pioneering effort to reclaim a waterway that vanished from the city's consciousness almost a century ago. \"Welcome,\" says George Wolfe, the group's founder. \"I&#xa0;hope you're ready for adventure.\" We push off into the current.</p> <p>Until recently this excursion would have been considered not just mad but illegal. City authorities encased the river bed in concrete in the 1930s, turning it into a flood-control channel that was a byword for contamination and forbidden to boaters. For decades it languished all but forgotten, save for Hollywood using its storm drains in films such as <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsYC-hVEpQM\" title=\"\">Grease</a> and <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnM7mFX8D_4\" title=\"\">Terminator 2</a>. Now, however, it has formally opened to boating tours, specifically kayaks and canoes. Activists hope it is the first step towards transformation. \"It's a milestone, and hopefully there are more to come,\" says Charles Eddy, a board member of Friends of the LA&#xa0;River, and part of this expedition, as he navigates his kayak through brambles. \"If you think of the river as a blank palette, people will create all sorts of wonderful things.\"</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395850980\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/27/1346077212783/Kayakers-in-Los-Angeles-010.jpg\" alt=\"Kayakers in Los Angeles\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kayakers paddle under the Woodley Avenue bridge in Los Angeles.

The river, fed by streams from the Simi hills in Canoga park, originally provided food, water and transport for Gabrielino Indians and Spanish settlers. After the US seized control from Mexico the city's water needs outgrew the river. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2006/dec/07/water.usnews\" title=\"\">An aqueduct completed in 1913 directed water from the Owens river in the Sierra Nevada mountains to LA, ending dependence on the LA river.</a> Disastrous flooding prompted its conversion \u2013 desecration, some critics would say \u2013 into a glorified drainage ditch. And so it remained for decades, a butt of jokes, a rubbish dump, out of sight and mind except when used as a backdrop for Hollywood car races and chases.</p> <p>Its nascent revival this summer as a source of recreation and environmental awareness comes amid a renewed water battle. The diverted Owens river is no longer enough \u2013 LA&#xa0;county is home to about 10 million people, not to mention vast farms further south clamouring for irrigation. <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/editorials/la-ed-0808-delta-conservation-plan-20120808,0,4862053.story\" title=\"\">Governor Jerry Brown is championing a proposed $14bn (\u00a39bn) tunnel system to divert water from northern California to southern California's parched cities and farms.</a> Two tubes, each 33ft wide, would direct part of the Sacramento river \u2013 up to 9,000 cubic feet a second \u2013 to existing pumps and aqueducts, supposedly ending <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-cap-water-20120730,0,7084638.column\" title=\"\">the water conflicts that Ronald Reagan, Arnold Schwarzenegger and a string of other governors failed to resolve</a>.</p> <p>\"This thing is never going to be free of controversy and conflict,\" <a href=\"http://www.businessweek.com/news/2012-07-25/brown-says-14-billion-plan-will-boost-california-water\" title=\"\">Brown told a press conference last month</a>. \"But we know a lot more today than we did then. Here we are, 30 years later, with a lot more knowledge and a lot more science.\" The US secretary of the interior, Ken Salazar, said the new tunnels would end \"the epic water wars that have plagued this state for&#xa0;decades\".</p> <p>Maybe, but the plan will have to overcome resistance from environmentalists who say it will kill salmon and farmers who complain about costs. Some analysts think the water wars will drag on, with southern California seeking ever more desperate remedies for its water shortages.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395850981\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/27/1346083196073/Terminator-2-Judgment-Day-007.jpg\" alt=\"Terminator 2: Judgment Day\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">LA as a \"soulless, dystopian metropolis\": Terminator 2: Judgment Day.

But to a coalition of artists, historians, environmentalists and outdoors enthusiasts its fate symbolises an attempt to make LA, branded by critics a soulless, dystopian metropolis, a kinder, gentler, more integrated city.</p> <p>\"We have to start thinking in new ways, and using words differently. If you call it a sewer ditch you treat it like a sewer ditch. Call it a river and you treat it like a river,\" says Wolfe, the expedition leader, as our group paddles upstream through a gorge. An advertising copywriter with a passion for canoeing, Wolfe and some companions made the first journey down the entire river over three days in 2008. It was technically illegal \u2013 the city did not want anyone in its drainage ditch \u2013 but they rebuffed police challenges with a (legitimate) filming permit, a magical pass when dealing with the LAPD, and made it to Long Beach.</p> <p>The voyage obliged authorities to admit that the waterway was navigable, something previously denied, and created a legal wedge to demand public access under public trust doctrine, a concept dating from Roman law. Eddy says 80% of the water was treated sewage, most of the rest groundwater with modest contamination. \"My dog has been drinking it for seven years and he hasn't got three tails.\"</p> <p>Inch by inch, authorities yielded, allowing Wolfe and his friends to take 300 people down the river in a pilot project last year. After nobody drowned or contracted a hideous disease, LA River Expeditions was allowed to start running regular, scheduled trips this summer for around 2,000 people. Tickets \u2013 $55 (\u00a335) each \u2013 were snapped up within minutes of going on sale. \"So here we are,\" says Wolfe, as the group of mostly novice kayakers bump and splash in his wake along a narrow stretch of surging water. The mood is giddy. Like the park attendant and dog-walker, until recently some of us did not even know there was a river, or where it was, or that it was usable. \"I've lived near this river almost all my life and I've never been on it. I jumped at this chance,\" says Gloria Barke, 77, a retired events organiser, as her partner Robert Finkle, 81, a copyright lawyer, paddles from the back.</p> <p>The LA river will never compete with the Danube or Seine or Thames as an attraction for stressed city-dwellers. Nor will it inspire many poems or novels. It is too meagre, too hidden, to ever be fully part of the city. But advocates are on to something when they say it can transform perceptions of LA.</p> <p>After passing a concrete bridge with graffiti-daubed arches and a shopping trolley half-buried in mud, we enter a wilderness that seems a world removed from the freeways and urban sprawl above. \"We call this the Grand Canyon,\" says Wolfe, showing his flair for advertising, as we paddle through a mini-gorge 15ft tall. Nature slowly asserts itself. To our left are wild fig trees, descendants of those planted by the Indians, to our right potentially deadly ricin-producing plants. Further on, hallucinogenic jimson weed. \"Around the next bend is the Apocalypse Now bit,\" says Wolfe. We encounter \"fish sticks\": improvised traps made by unknown hands to trap carp, tilapia and other species. A discourse on how to make the traps is drowned out by a passenger jet roaring low overhead, briefly breaking the spell.</p> <p>The sense that this is something special returns as we moor our boats and slosh ashore, inspecting plants, a turtle shell, a cascade, before resuming the journey. It is difficult to believe that the 405 freeway, the gridlocked bane of LA motorists, is just a mile away. Three hours later we return to where we started, a swampy bank, and moor the kayaks amid some ducks. The tour is over. We saw nothing that would excite David Attenborough. But we glimpsed another LA, one not consumed by automobiles, or turned into a strip mall, where nature and human optimism thrive in a watery realm, an ever so slightly mystic river.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 3 September 2012. The original referred to hallucinogenic gypsum weed. That should have been jimson weed, or Datura, and has been corrected.</p>",
  "<p>There are no comparisons to be made. This is not like war or plague or a stockmarket crash. We are ill-equipped, historically and psychologically, to understand it, which is one of the reasons why so many refuse to accept that it is happening.</p> <p>What we are seeing, here and now, is&#xa0;the transformation of the atmospheric physics of this planet. Three weeks before the likely minimum, the melting of Arctic sea ice has already broken the&#xa0;record set in 2007. The daily rate of&#xa0;loss&#xa0;is now 50% higher than it was that year. The daily sense of loss \u2013 of the&#xa0;world we loved and knew \u2013 cannot be quantified so easily.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/jan/03/david-attenborough-frozen-planet-climate-change\" title=\"\">Arctic has been warming roughly twice as quickly</a> as the rest of the northern hemisphere. This is partly because climate breakdown there is self-perpetuating. As the ice melts, for example, exposing the darker sea beneath, heat that would previously have been reflected back into space is absorbed.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/aug/23/arctic-sea-ice-record-low\" title=\"\">This great dissolution, of ice and certainties</a>, is happening so much faster than most climate scientists predicted that one of them reports: \"It feels as if everything I've learned has become obsolete.\" In its last assessment, published in 2007, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change noted that \"in some projections, Arctic late-summer sea ice disappears almost entirely by the latter part of the 21st century\". These were the most extreme forecasts in the panel's range. Some scientists now forecast that the disappearance of Arctic&#xa0;sea-ice in late summer could occur in this decade or the next.</p> <p>As I've warned repeatedly, but to little effect, the IPCC's assessments tend to be conservative. This is unsurprising when you see how many people have to approve them before they are published. There have been a few occasions \u2013 such as its <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/jan/20/ipcc-himalayan-glaciers-mistake\" title=\"\">estimate of the speed at which glaciers would be lost in the Himalayas</a> \u2013 on which the panel has overstated the case. But it looks as if these will be greatly outnumbered by the occasions on which the panel has understated it.</p> <p>The melting disperses another belief: that the temperate parts of the world \u2013 where most of the rich nations are located \u2013 will be hit last and least, while the poorer nations will be hit first and worst. New knowledge of the way in which the destruction of the Arctic sea ice affects northern Europe and North America suggests that this is no longer true. A paper published earlier this year in Geophysical Research Letters shows that <a href=\"http://www.climatecentral.org/news/arctic-warming-is-altering-weather-patterns-study-shows/\" title=\"\">Arctic warming is likely to be responsible for the extremes now hammering the once-temperate nations</a>.</p> <p>The north polar jet stream is an air current several hundred kilometres wide, travelling eastwards around the hemisphere. The current functions as a barrier, separating the cold, wet weather to the north from the warmer, drier weather to the south. Many of the variations in our weather are caused by great travelling meanders \u2013 <a href=\"http://weatherfaqs.org.uk/node/145\" title=\"\">Rossby waves</a> \u2013 in the jet stream.</p> <p>Arctic heating, the paper shows, both&#xa0;slows the Rossby waves and makes&#xa0;them steeper and wider. Instead of moving on rapidly, the weather gets stuck. Regions to the south of the stalled&#xa0;meander wait for weeks or months for rain; regions to the north (or underneath it) wait for weeks or months for a break from the rain. Instead of a benign succession of sunshine and showers, we get droughts or floods. During the winter a slow, steep meander can connect us directly to the polar weather, dragging severe ice and snow far to the south of its usual range. This mechanism goes a long way towards explaining the shift to sustained \u2013 and therefore extreme \u2013 weather patterns around the northern hemisphere.</p> <p>I have no idea what is coming to Europe and North America this winter and next summer, in the wake of the record ice melt, but it's unlikely to be pleasant. Please note that this record represents a loss of about 30% of Arctic sea ice, against the long-term average. When that climbs to 50% or 70% or 90%, the impacts are likely to be worse.</p> <p>Our governments do nothing. Having&#xa0;abandoned any pretence of responding to the environmental crisis&#xa0;during the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/jun/23/rio-20-earth-summit-document\" title=\"\">Earth summit</a> in June, now they stare stupidly as the ice on which we stand dissolves. Nothing \u2013 or&#xa0;worse than nothing. Their one unequivocal response to the melting has&#xa0;been to facilitate the capture of the oil and fish&#xa0;it&#xa0;exposes.</p> <p>The companies that caused this disaster are scrambling to profit from it. On Sunday <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/news/nation/nationnow/la-na-nn-shell-arctic-chukchi-20120826,0,6093682.story\" title=\"\">Shell requested an extension to its exploratory drilling period in the Chukchi Sea</a>, off the north-west coast of Alaska. This would push its operations hard against the moment when the ice re-forms and any spills they cause are locked in. The Russian oil company Gazprom is using the great melt to try to drill in the Pechora Sea, north-east of Murmansk. After turning its Arctic lands in the <a href=\"http://www.greenpeace.org/international/en/campaigns/climate-change/arctic-impacts/The-dangers-of-Arctic-oil/Black-ice--Russian-oil-spill-disaster/\" title=\"\">Komi republic into the Niger delta of the north</a> (repeated oil spills are left unremediated in the tundra), Russia wants to extend this industry into one of the world's most fragile ecosystems, where ice, storms and darkness make decontamination almost impossible.</p> <p>As I write, activists from Greenpeace, whom I regard as heroes, are <a href=\"http://www.greenpeace.org/new-zealand/en/blog/arctic-action-live/blog/41861/\" title=\"\">chained to Gazprom's supply vessel</a>, preventing the rig from operating. These people are stepping in where all governments have failed. David Cameron, who still claims to lead the greenest government ever, is no longer hugging huskies. In June he struck an <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/damian-carrington-blog/2012/jun/07/energy-uk-norway-oil-gas-renewables\" title=\"\">agreement with the Norwegian prime minister</a> \"to enable sustainable development of Arctic energy\". Sustainable development, of course, means drilling for oil.</p> <p>Is this how our children will see it: that we destroyed the benign conditions that made our world of wonders possible, and then used the opportunity to amplify the damage? All of us, of course, can claim to have acted with other aims in mind, or not to have&#xa0;acted at all, as the other immediacies of life seemed more important. But&#xa0;\u2013 unless we respond at last \u2013 the results follow as surely as if we had sought to engineer them.</p> <p>Stupidity, greed, passivity? Just as comparisons evaporate, so do these words. The ice, that solid platform on which, we now discover, so much rested, melts into air. Our pretensions to peace, prosperity and progress are likely to follow. <a href=\"http://www.enotes.com/shakespeare-quotes/we-such-stuff-dreams-made\" title=\"\">\"And like the baseless fabric of this vision, / The cloud-capp'd towers, the gorgeous palaces, / The solemn temples, the great globe itself, / Yea, all which it inherit, shall dissolve.\"</a></p> <p>\u2022 Twitter: @GeorgeMonbiot</p> <p>\u2022 For a fully referenced version of this article, visit George Monbiot's website: <a href=\"http://www.monbiot.com/\" title=\"\">www.monbiot.com</a></p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 29 August 2012.

Fans, some of whom had queued up 12 hours before the event, were treated to a screening of the episode and a Q&amp;A session hosted by Hardwick, who, thanks to his Nerdist podcast, has become something of a professional nerd emcee at events like this.</p> <p>\"I'm gonna have him sign my sonic screwdriver and hope it doesn't wear off,\" said Remus Sottile, 11, one of the many screaming fans outside the Ziegfeld Theater just north of Times Square. Some of the fans were shouting even before the DeLorean doors opened; when Smith and crew appeared in full view, the screams turned to something indescribably louder: shrieks. Multiple proposals of marriage. Remus, balancing on a metal barrier while stretching his screwdriver above the crowd, looked at his foot and noticed it was shaking from nervousness.</p> <p>Wearing a fez, Remus was at the event with his twin brother, Roman, and their older sister, 13-year-old Zoe, with a binder full of photos of past Doctors. They were disappointed when Smith and crew didn't make it over to their part of the line, but the feeling passed when their spot in standby turned into an entry ticket to join the 1,100 fans already inside the packed theater.</p> <p>As for the show itself, there are \u2026 developments, you might say, that are best left kept unspoiled. Showrunner <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2012/aug/25/doctor-who-bbc-steven-moffat\">Stephen Moffat has promised scarier Daleks this season</a>, and the first episode sets the bar high. Just think carefully about that word \"asylum\" in the title, and the many meanings it can have.</p> <p>\"There's a lot of revelations for the continuation of Doctor Who,\" Smith said to the crowd before the screening. \"Please, don't tweet about it, don't blog about it \u2026</p> <p>\"Don't tell anyone the Doctor's name is actually Keith,\" Hardwick interjects. </p> <p>In any other crowd, asking for such silence may have been pointless, but these were diehard Whovians. Asked by Smith after the episode who among them thought the plot was best kept a secret, nearly every hand in the theater shot up.</p> <p>That kind of investment in a television series is hard to come by, but Moffat, his writers and the actors have worked hard to reward fans with top-notch episodes. Asylum of the Daleks is one of the best in recent memory, and it portends an emotional ride as the show prepares to lose Gillan's character, Amy Pond, along with Rory Williams, played by Arthur Darvill. The pair have been the Doctor's longest-serving companions, but, as fans of the long-running series have learned time and time again, companions \u2013 and Doctors \u2013 are not permanent.</p> <p>\"It's going to be really hard for a couple of days, and then forever,\" Hardwick said to Gillan, of her eventual last episode.</p> <p>\"This is a microcosm of life. Life goes on, we get new people,\" Smith said. \"The show is the biggest thing. It will go on without us.\"</p> <p>Asked about his own eventual replacement, Smith joined Hardwick and Gillan in a game of naming any actor, living or dead, they'd like to see as the Doctor. Hardwick suggested himself. Smith said Peter Sellers \"would be amazing\". Someone from the crowd yelled a vote for Benedict Cumberbatch, and 1,100 heads exploded at the thought of marrying two beloved BBC institutions.</p> <p>Outside the screening, stuck in traffic on 54th Street, the driver of a Bentley turned down his blasting hip-hop enough to shout to the line: \"What are you guys going to see?\"</p> <p>\"DOCTOR WHO\", they screamed back.</p> <p>\"All right, all right,\" he said, smiling.</p> <p>\"Did you see the DeLoreans?\" someone shouted back. \"And I bet you thought YOUR car was cool.\"</p> <p>Sure, DeLoreans, Bentleys, they're nice rides. Not as nice as a Tardis, though.</p>",
  "<p>It was just as well <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Blue\" title=\"Josh Blue\">Josh Blue</a> had a sense of humour because every time he returned to the US after touring abroad with the US Paralympic football team he would be greeted with blank stares. The parawhat?</p> <p>The excitement of playing before cheering crowds in Europe and South America would dissolve in the indifference and ignorance of his home country. The striker and his disabled teammates would play domestic games in near-empty stadiums. \"It'd be just our relatives.\" Even after competing in the 2004 Games in Athens, Blue, who has cerebral palsy, returned home to silence and shrugs. \"Unfortunately it just doesn't get any play here.\"</p> <p>A stand-up comedian, it was not until he won NBC's reality show, Last Comic Standing, in 2006 that the American public woke up to his talent, off the field at least.</p> <p>Blue has a self-deprecating humour focused on living with disability which enchanted viewers and critics. A \"palsy punch\" was effective in a fight, he said, because \"first of all, they don't know where the punch is coming from, and second of all, neither do I\". There was little funny, however, about US ignorance of the Paralympics, a vacuum which left American competitors envious of the support disabled athletes enjoyed in other countries. \"You'd hear about all these projects and think, wow, why aren't we doing that?\" said Christine Tinberg, founder of Bicycling Blind Los Angeles, a group which matches blind people with sighted riders on tandems.</p> <p>London's Games, however, may signal a turning of the tide. Companies like Visa and General Electric are featuring slick commercials with disabled athletes to endorse a range of products. Some disabled athletes are finding additional audiences through social media.</p> <p>Disabled military veterans-turned Paralympians are tapping patriotic sentiment. NBC recently announced it would scale up coverage, previously virtually non-existent, to four hour-long programmes on NBC Sports plus a daily highlights package via the US Paralympics YouTube channel.That pales in comparison with Channel 4's Paralympic fest of an estimated 400 hours, or even the BBC's patchy coverage in 2008 when it showed daily highlights and live coverage at the weekend.</p> <p>Nevertheless Sir Philip Craven, the International Paralympic Committee president, celebrated NBC's announcement. \"It's tremendous news that the London 2012 Paralympic Games will get more airtime in the US then ever before and thoroughly deserved.\"</p> <p>But why has the US been so resistant until now? And to what extent is it embracing the London Games?</p> <p>Beth Haller, a professor of mass communication at Towson university who has written about disability issues, said apathy was largely the result of media neglect. Television networks shunned past Games, she said, leaving viewers unaware there even was a competition for disabled athletes after the regular Olympics. \"Much of it boils down to the economic structure of our media. It concentrates on what will make money, and it thinks the Paralympics won't do that.\"</p> <p>A student who analysed the 2002 Salt Lake City winter Paralympics discovered US journalists scrambling for the airport once the regular Games ended while many foreign journalists stayed on for the Paralympics.</p> <p>Another reason for apathy, said Haller, was that US medal success in the Olympic Games sated national pride, unlike some smaller countries which viewed the Paralympics as an opportunity for consolation medals. Even so, the US amassed 99 medals in Beijing, coming third overall.</p> <p>US awareness has been negligible even among the disabled. Growing up in Minnesota, Blue, a talented footballer from an early age, did not hear about the Paralympics until the age of 22 when a sports-loving disabled friend said: \"You know there's a team for you, right?\"</p> <p>Soon after Blue was scoring goals for the Paralympic squad, but it rankled that he could have been doing so years earlier. \"Elsewhere, especially Europe, there's much greater awareness and respect.\" A glimpse of disabled elite athletes in action, he said, was usually enough to hook fans. \"Have you seen a wheelchair basketball game? They kill each other out there.\"</p> <p>Tinberg, who recruits braille students for her bicycling group, said many initially gasped at the idea of becoming athletes. \"They've never heard of it. They're like, cycling blind, really? How does it work?\"</p> <p>After awareness, the biggest problem was lack of resources. \"Most blind people are unemployed and bikes are expensive.\"</p> <p>Disabled war veterans have given the media a new reason to cover the world's second biggest sporting event \u2013 an event founded in 1948 to help rehabilitate injured British veterans. Of the US delegation 20 are veterans, of which six were injured in combat.</p> <p>\"The veterans are having a huge impact. It pulls people's hearts. And the government is putting a lot of money into sports facilities for them,\" said Tinberg. Last week she was seeking a sighted rider to team up with a recently blinded 21-year-old female soldier.</p> <p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Push_Girls\" title=\"Push Girls\">Push Girls</a>, a reality television show following the lives of four glamorous LA women in wheelchairs, has helped nudge disability issues towards the cultural mainstream.</p> <p>\"Things are changing. I see a lot more awareness,\" said Kenneth Riptoe, executive director of One with Water, a swimming club associated with the Paralympic movement.Most agree. The US Olympic Committee said NBC's expanded coverage meant Americans would see more of the Games than ever before.</p> <p>In a statement NBC, which did not respond to interview requests for this article, said it would conclude coverage with a 90-minute special show on September 16, a week after the Games end.</p> <p>That did little to appease critics who said it was all still too little. \"Hey, NBC found a whole 90 minutes for the Paralympics! In the middle of the afternoon! A week after it's over! Woo hoo!\" wrote one blogger.</p> <p>Blue, who is no longer on the US Paralympic squad, said he will follow his beloved football team from afar. Their first game is against Ukraine, a powerhouse ranked third in the world. \"But they're getting old. We think we can take them.\"</p>",
  "<p><a href=\"http://www.londonmet.ac.uk/\" title=\"\">London Metropolitan University</a> has set up a hotline offering help and support for thousands of worried international students following reports that it is about to lose its right to provide courses to people from outside the EU.</p> <p>The university has been unable to accept any fees from present or potential students since the UK Border Agency (Ukba) suspended its <a href=\"http://www.ukba.homeoffice.gov.uk/sitecontent/newsarticles/2011/july/28-hts-proposed-criteria\" title=\"\">highly trusted sponsor status</a> in July, leaving current students uncertain whether they can complete courses and potential ones uncertain if they can take up offers.</p> <p>Ministers have denied claims <a href=\"http://www.thesundaytimes.co.uk/sto/news/uk_news/Education/article1112409.ece\" title=\"\">made in the Sunday Times</a> that Theresa May, the home secretary, had already decided to end the university's power to sponsor visas. But the university says there is a \"growing \u00a310m hole\" in its balance sheet because of investigations by the agency. A final decision on the university's future is expected this week.</p> <p>The university charges its non-EU students up to \u00a313,500 a year in tuition fees and it says the timing of the UKBA's suspension has made it difficult to alert all its estimated 2,600 international students to the problem. It said it was doing all it could to inform and assist international students and applicants, who had put their faith in the university.</p> <p>Students need clear information on their options for future study and timelines for securing those options, the university said. Home and EU students would also need reassurance and support.</p> <p>Seyda Yilmaz, 20, from Istanbul, is about to start the third year of a \u00a310,000-a-year journalism course. She told the Guardian the threat to international students at the university was shocking and unexpected. \"I hadn't heard anything about this before two days ago, I spoke to two of my Turkish friends. They, like me, didn't know anything.\" She was unable to contact anyone at the university over the weekend.</p> <p>Yilmaz, who lives in north London with her sister, a master's student at the University of Westminster, said she didn't have time to transfer her course. She is currently in Turkey but plans to return to London before lectures begin on 1 October.</p> <p>\"I have a valid visa but I don't know if [Ukba] are going to send me back to my country because the university doesn't have any access to international students.\" Yilmaz has not yet told her parents, but suggested she might prosecute the university if she was unable to finish her course.</p> <p>The university's international students office posted on its Facebook page last Monday thanking students for their patience and saying it was \"frustrated\" Ukba had not yet finalised its work.</p> <p>The post said international students due to start this academic term had until Monday 15 October to enrol. \"With visa processing times being around 15 days, this still gives students good time to make travel and other preparations. As an alternative, postgraduate students might be interested in joining us in February.\"</p> <p>Daniel Stevens, international students' officer for the National Union of Students, said: \"Students are now left in limbo, not knowing if they will have just weeks to find a new course or face deportation. Even those that do find new courses may find themselves thousands of pounds out of pocket and having to uproot to another part of the UK. Students and institutions should be helped to manage the visa sponsorship process rather than facing hasty punitive measures that threaten universities that are both valuable centres of learning and important businesses.\"</p> <p>Stevens echoed concerns of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2012/aug/26/home-office-university-teaching-status\" title=\"\">university's vice-chancellor Malcolm Gillies</a> over the impact on the entire university sector. \"Not only will this decision have disastrous consequences for thousands of students but it may well have a catastrophic impact on the reputation of the UK as a destination for international students creating a knock effect for universities and all their students in the UK.\"</p> <p>\u2022<em> If you are worried about your place at LMU, call </em>the hotline on <em>(+44) (0)20 7133 4141.</em></p>",
  "<p><strong> </strong></p> <p>The Arctic sea ice has hit its lowest extent ever recorded, according to the US-based <a href=\"http://nsidc.org/\" title=\"\">National Snow and Ice Data Center</a> (NSIDC), the Japanese Aerospace Exploration Agency, and Norwegian, Danish and other government monitoring organisations.</p> <p>With possibly two weeks' further melt likely before the ice reaches its minimum extent and starts to refreeze ahead of the winter, satellites showed it had shrunk to 4.1m sq km (1.6m sq miles) on Sunday. The previous record of 4.3m sq km was set in 2007. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/aug/23/arctic-sea-ice-record-low\" title=\"\">The Guardian reported earlier this month that such a record low was likely to be hit imminently</a>.</p> <p>NSIDC scientist Walt Meier said: \"This is an indication that the Arctic sea ice cover is fundamentally changing.\"</p> <p>\"The previous record, set in 2007, occurred because of near perfect summer weather for melting ice. Apart from one big storm in early August, weather patterns this year were unremarkable. The ice is so thin and weak now, it doesn't matter how the winds blow,\" said the NSIDC director, Mark Serreze.</p> <p>The record is widely seen by scientists at the NSIDC and elsewhere as a strong signal of long-term climate warming.</p> <p>\"The Arctic used to be dominated by multiyear ice, or ice that stayed around for several years,\" Meier said. \"Now it's becoming more of a seasonal ice cover and large areas are now prone to melting out in summer,\" said Serreze.</p> <p>\"These figures are not the result of some freak of nature but the effects of man-made global warming caused by our reliance on dirty fossil fuels,\" said John Sauven, the Greenpeace UK director.</p> <p>\"These preliminary figures provide irrefutable evidence that greenhouse gas emissions leading to global warming are damaging one of the planet's critical environments, one that helps maintain the stability of the global climate for every citizen of the world,\" said Sauven.</p> <p>Arctic sea ice follows an annual cycle of melting through the warm summer months and refreezing in the winter. It has shown a dramatic overall decline over the past 30 years.</p> <p>\"Record-breaking ice minimums are becoming the new normal,\" says Clive Tesar of WWF's global Arctic programme. \"We're breaking records on a regular basis as the sea ice continues its decline.\"</p> <p>According to many scientists, the sea ice plays a critical role in regulating climate, acting as a giant mirror that reflects much of the sun's energy, helping to cool the Earth.</p> <p>The formation of the sea ice produces dense saltwater, which sinks, helping drive the deep ocean currents. Without the ice, many scientists fear this balance could be upset, potentially causing major climatic changes.</p>",
  "<p>Jeffery Boswall, who has died of cancer aged 81, helped to cultivate the BBC Natural History Unit's global reputation for wildlife film-making. The popular children's series Animal Magic, which began in 1962, gave Boswall his first TV experience as a producer and director after working in radio. The series' presenter Johnny Morris \u2013 dressed as a zookeeper for the filmed inserts \u2013 had a gentle, humorous style and put words into animals' mouths by mimicking what he envisaged them to be saying. Gerald Durrell was also a presenter of the early programmes.</p> <p>Boswall then worked on Look, presented by Peter Scott, the renowned conservationist and leader of ornithological expeditions worldwide. <a href=\"http://www.wildfilmhistory.org/film/97/Private+Life+of+the+Kingfisher.html\" title=\"The Private Life of the Kingfisher\">The Private Life of the Kingfisher</a> (1966), one of the episodes he produced for the wildlife series, was the Natural History Unit's first programme to be broadcast in colour. Filmed over a year on the river Test in Hampshire, it featured remarkable pictures of the hunter birds mating, performing spectacular dives and feeding their young with whole fish. It won the silver medal at the Moscow film festival.</p> <p>The original black-and-white version, The Kingfisher, had been screened the previous year as a schools programme. Boswall recognised the talents of the directors, Ronald and Rosemary Eastman, and commissioned them to re-shoot it in colour. This began a long and successful wildlife film-making career for the couple. After Look ended, Boswall commissioned other Private Life documentaries (1969-75); the subjects of these single-species studies included the starling, fox, cuckoo and wild duck.</p> <p>He ventured in front of the camera when Alan Moorehead had to pull out of presenting <a href=\"http://www.wildfilmhistory.org/film/102/102.html?filmid=102\" title=\"Review of Wildlife Safari to Ethiopia\">Wildlife Safari to Ethiopia</a> (1970). Boswall spent six months filming in the Horn of Africa with the camera operator Douglas Fisher to bring previously unfilmed animals and plants into viewers' homes. He later presented similar programmes on Argentina (1973), Mexico (1976) and Thailand (1979).</p> <p>Although he had a full and fulfilled life, if Boswall had one regret it might have been that he did not get more exposure in front of the camera. He once told a friend: \"David Attenborough is the presenter of a lifetime \u2013 why did it have to be my lifetime?\"</p> <p>Boswall was born in Brighton, East Sussex. His father, Richard, a grocer who also made a living by renting out properties, died when Jeffery was nine. His mother, Elizabeth, subsequently brought up him and his older brother and sister alone.</p> <p>When Boswall was 13, a friend took him to see the birdlife on the river Adur, at Shoreham-by-Sea. His resulting enthralment with ornithology determined the course of his life. On leaving school at 16, Boswall took a job with the <a href=\"http://www.rspb.org.uk/\" title=\"RSPB website\">Royal Society for the Protection of Birds</a> as assistant warden on Skokholm Island, off the Pembrokeshire coast. Within months, his first article in the journal <a href=\"http://www.britishbirds.co.uk/\" title=\"British Birds journal\">British Birds</a> was published.</p> <p>In 1958, a year after it was formed, he joined the BBC's Natural History Unit, in Bristol, as an assistant radio producer working on The Naturalist and Birds in Britain. Four years later, Boswall started directing Animal Magic and, in 1964, he switched permanently to television.</p> <p>Experience as an officer in the territorial army meant that he planned productions like a military operation. Although some colleagues found him prickly and abrupt, he was widely seen as an eccentric, larger-than-life character with whom it was possible to have a professional disagreement while continuing to be a friend.</p> <p>In a 1988 paper, The Moral Pivots of Wildlife Film-making, Boswall raised the issue of ethics, advocating that the audience should not be deceived. He asserted that this sometimes happened when film-makers baited an animal or gave it food not normally eaten, or introduced it to another with which it did not usually interact. He considered adding sound to the footage to be dishonest.</p> <p>One of Boswall's later films for the BBC, which he narrated and produced, was <a href=\"http://www.wildfilmhistory.org/film/116/Animal+Olympians.html\" title=\"Profile of the documentary Animal Olympians\">Animal Olympians</a> (1980), contrasting the beauty, endurance and power of creatures with human athletes. It was a fun documentary showing, for instance, sprinters being outrun by cheetahs and swimmers proving no match for seals.</p> <p>In 1987, Boswall returned to the RSPB as head of its film and video unit. He produced various short documentaries, including For Love of Birds \u2013 The Story of the RSPB 1889-1989, to mark the charity's centenary.</p> <p>After a few years, he left the RSPB to launch wildlife film-making courses at the University of Derby, where he became a senior lecturer. Later, he lectured widely across the country and on cruises, and sat on film festival juries. Boswall chaired the British Kinematograph Sound and Television Society's international symposiums for wildlife film-makers from 1976 to 1991.</p> <p>In 1961, he married Pamela Watson, who died in 2002. He is survived by their sons, Peregrine, Julian and Rupert.</p> <p>\u2022 Jeffery Hugh Richard Boswall, wildlife film-maker and ornithologist, born 20 March 1931; died 15 August 2012</p>",
  "<p>One of Spain's most horrific, long-running missing persons investigations took a grim twist on Monday after two scientists separately confirmed that a mass of charred bones found in a homemade oven at a property owned by the grandparents of missing siblings Jos\u00e9 and Ruth Bret\u00f3n belonged to a two-year-old and a six-year-old child.</p> <p>Ruth, six, and Jos\u00e9, two, are thought to have been killed by their father, Jos\u00e9 Bret\u00f3n, who claimed they had been kidnapped at a park in the southern city of C\u00f3rdoba while he was looking after them last October. He was eventually arrested on suspicion of kidnapping and held in jail, but has continued to proclaim his innocence.</p> <p>Bret\u00f3n's ex-wife, Ruth Ortiz, has insisted for months that he had either kidnapped or killed the children out of revenge for her leaving him.</p> <p>Spanish newspapers quoted police as describing Bret\u00f3n's attitude under interrogation as \"ice cold\" and investigators have indicated they thought he had either killed his children or was paying someone to keep them at a secret address.</p> <p>Months of searching properties, draining local ponds and dragging rivers had failed to produce results. Bret\u00f3n, a former soldier, had written to newspapers claiming he had been given information that would allow him to find the bodies if released.</p> <p>Police scientists originally said that the bones found in a furnace on a piece of land outside C\u00f3rdoba owned by Bret\u00f3n's parents belonged to animals. But the interior minister, Jorge Fern\u00e1ndez D\u00edaz, admitted fresh reports on the bones revealed they included human remains.</p> <p>The oven had been made by covering an open fire with a metal bell cover so that temperatures reached as high as 800C (1,472F), baking the mud underneath. \"It is as if it was a cremation oven,\" Fern\u00e1ndez D\u00edaz said.</p> <p>Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Berm\u00fadez de Castro, Spain's most celebrated paleoanthropologist and co-director of excavations at the Pliocene and Pleistocene-era Atapuerca cave site in northern Spain, has reportedly produced a report saying that the bones found in the oven include a six-year-old child's teeth.</p> <p>He had been called in to study the bones after the mother's family asked Francisco Etxeberria, a forensic scientist who has dug up many mass graves left over from the Spanish civil war, to analyse them. He surprised police by concluding that the bones included those of both a two-year-child and of a six-year-old. \"It is obvious there were human remains there,\" he told the newspaper El Pa\u00eds. \"They met a violent end.\"</p> <p>Bret\u00f3n's lawyer said his client stood by the original police report stating that only animal bones were in the oven.</p> <p>Further tests on the remains are being carried out, though Etxeberria said that the high temperatures in the oven made DNA testing impossible.</p>",
  "<p>He hasn't performed in public <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vq6mKkdIoQA\" title=\"\">for six years</a>, or released an album in almost a decade, but there is a lot of David Bowie about.

Even in his absence, Bowie eclipsed the stars who did turn up.</p> <p>Next year, the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2012/aug/18/david-bowie-victoria-albert-museum-costumes?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">Victoria and Albert museum</a> will host an extensive exhibition of Bowie's costumes, while the ICA in London pays tribute to his film work this weekend \u2014 an underrated aspect of his creative life that is easily as significant as his knack for throwing together a satin-and-thigh-boots ensemble. Unlike Madonna, Prince or Eminem, Bowie was an actor almost from the moment he began performing. He trained as a mime under <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/2002/jan/30/artsfeatures\" title=\"\">Lindsay Kemp</a>, who was also briefly his lover. When <a href=\"http://www.bowiewonderworld.com/press/70/7409lkemp.htm\" title=\"\">Kemp told a journalist</a> in 1974, \"I&#xa0;taught David to free his body,\" it was more than innuendo: mime technique is visible in everything from the Ziggy Stardust live show to Bowie's Broadway portrayal of The Elephant Man.</p> <p>He had been kicking around film ideas long before Roeg cast him as that forlorn extraterrestrial stranded in New Mexico in the mid-1970s. There had been talk of a film based around the Diamond Dogs album, while the documentary-maker <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2001/sep/01/books.guardianreview\" title=\"\">DA Pennebaker</a>, who shot Bowie's 1973 concert movie <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0086643/\" title=\"\">Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars</a>, was approached to collaborate on a fictional project: \"He thought maybe I could help him, but I&#xa0;explained I didn't know how.\"</p> <p>Though the Ziggy Stardust film wasn't shown widely until 1983, chronologically it was Bowie's first full-length picture. \"I love the film because it's so off-the-cuff,\" Pennebaker tells me. \"We didn't have a lot of cameras. We hardly showed the band. It's a very sexy film, and nobody knows why; he's just standing there singing. But I liked that idea: one man, one concert.\"</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/FpvWZOvzums?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"283\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/FpvWZOvzums\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>Pennebaker was on the Mississippi when he heard that he was wanted in London to shoot what would turn out to be Ziggy Stardust's swansong. \"I thought the record company said 'Bryan Ferry'. I'd never heard of David Bowie.\" He met the singer backstage. \"He was like a businessman; he didn't have that mercurial quality that booms out of him on stage. He was putting on his makeup and talking to his wife, Angie. He was behaving quite rationally, although he did say, 'Last night my mother saw her first spaceship', which I just put down to general conversation.\"</p> <p>Bowie blamed his own boredom with Ziggy for his initial lack of interest in the movie. \"I was so fed up with him,\" he said in 1983. \"But I dragged [the film] out and thought: 'This is a <em>funny</em> film! This boy used to dress like that for a living? My God, this is funny! Incredible! Wait till my son sees this!'\"</p> <p>After killing Ziggy off in that July 1973 concert, Bowie cultivated a new persona: the gaunt Halloween Jack, as seen in Alan Yentob's disquieting <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyTw7xLPg1s\" title=\"\">1974 BBC documentary Cracked Actor</a>. With peg-teeth, skin like paper and hair the colour of burnt marmalade, Bowie is chauffeured around America's west coast like a bag of bones in a hearse, while Yentob gently probes the singer's relationship with his alter egos and interviews swooning US fans. Bowie might have looked like death warmed up and then left to go cold again, but it was the Diamond Dogs tour, glimpsed in Yentob's film, which transformed him from freak into American superstar.</p> <p>As well as capturing that point of commercial breakthrough, Cracked Actor convinced Roeg that he had <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/2012/jun/25/how-we-made-man-fell\" title=\"\">found his man who fell to earth</a>. \"I went to meet David at his house in New York,\" he recalls. \"After about three hours, maybe longer, he arrived and apologised for his lateness. I said, 'Let's have a chat.' He said, 'We don't need to chat. I want to do the film. So \u2013 I'll see you there.' I headed straight for the bar and had a large one. 'I'll see you there.' Fantastic!\"</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/oKF5lHcJY9k?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"283\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/oKF5lHcJY9k\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>They met again on set. \"He kept rather distant, which was rather good for the part. He arrived in that car you see in Cracked Actor, and it had a whole trailer with a library of books. He always went back to that trailer. We spent a couple of evenings together but in the main he was separate; separate but always there. I felt he was perfect \u2013 the inflections, everything, so original. He wasn't inventing it, he was being it.\" The studio executives were more sceptical about Bowie's take on alien life. \"They came on set one day after seeing the rushes and said, 'We're a little concerned about David's performance.' I&#xa0;said: 'Well, how <em>should </em>an alien act?'\"</p> <p>That performance's general immunity from criticism may owe something to the perception that he was playing himself. \"I didn't enjoy it as a movie to watch,\" Bowie later said. \"It's very tight. Like a spring that's going to uncoil, it's got these terrific tensions, these very inhibited feelings in it.\" But his use of stills from that film on two subsequent album covers (<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/musicblog/2011/sep/16/station-station-david-bowie\" title=\"\">Station to Station</a> and <a href=\"http://www.rollingstone.com/music/albumreviews/low-20010511\" title=\"\">Low</a>) suggested that any discomfort was mixed with some pride.</p> <p>With the exception of The Man Who Fell to Earth and the unloved <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUYiqWRC2hU\" title=\"\">1979 drama Just a Gigolo</a> with Marlene Dietrich, which he described as \"all my Elvis movies rolled into one\", Bowie has taken only supporting parts on film. Within the space of a few years in the 1980s, he was a vampire cellist who ages 300 years in an afternoon (Tony Scott's <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_f72oWukcM\" title=\"\">The Hunger</a>), a defiant and pretty PoW (<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QXK6FrhNTos\" title=\"\">Merry Christmas, Mr Lawrence</a>), a tight-trousered Goblin King with an exploding hairdo (<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViftZTfRSt8\" title=\"\">Labyrinth</a>), Pontius Pilate (The Last Temptation of Christ) and a hitman named Colin (Into the Night).</p> <p>The director Julien Temple first worked with Bowie on the 20-minute promo film <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXvAaNcXNzI\" title=\"\">Jazzin' for Blue Jean</a>, in which he played the dual role of nerdy fan and preening rock god. \"It examined that split which exists in him,\" Temple says. \"There's 'normal David' and 'incandescent David'. He wasn't like those performers who exhibit a star-like aura wherever they go. We went to the Notting Hill carnival together, and people wanted to touch him, which was odd because he was this very normal south London guy. It was when he performed that a transformation occurred.\"</p> <p>Temple went on to cast Bowie in <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8NZa9wYZ_U\" title=\"\">Absolute Beginners</a> as the ruthless, amoral ad-man Vendice Partners, who dances on a giant typewriter. \"David had worked in advertising early on and saw through it all. He was interested in using that weird transatlantic DJ voice \u2013 he really got off on that \u2013 and he was quite obsessed with the Sinatra thing. He made Vendice very Rat Pack-like.\"</p> <p>Bowie's film acting became more infrequent from the late 1980s on, his time dominated by one ambitious world tour after another. But he did hint that he was fostering a grand cinematic plan when he turned down Todd Haynes's request to use his music in <a href=\"http://mubi.com/films/velvet-goldmine\" title=\"\">Velvet Goldmine</a> (named after a Bowie B-side), claiming he was holding them back for his own project. (Interviewed later on Jonathan Ross's Radio 2 show, he was dismissive of Haynes's film, which featured Jonathan Rhys Meyers&#xa0;as a Bowie-esque glam-rock chameleon: \"He got the gay stuff right, but he can't do story.\")</p> <p>While his son, Duncan Jones, is now an accomplished director (he made <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twuScTcDP_Q\" title=\"\">Moon</a> and Source Code), Bowie's film work has become confined to eccentric cameos. He played himself <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zavgk2_BJs\" title=\"\">in Zoolander</a> and <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jv6mEv_rDdE\" title=\"\">in the Ricky Gervais series Extras</a>, and could be heard as Lord Royal Highness <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/video/2008/oct/28/spongebob-squarepants-david-bowie\" title=\"\">on SpongeBob SquarePants</a>. But one notable exception raises a hope that we haven't seen the last of Bowie the actor: as the electrical innovator Nikola Tesla <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGPOq7fFahg\" title=\"\">in Christopher Nolan's Victorian thriller The Prestige</a>, he is memorably haunted and distracted, though he was a down-to-earth presence on set. \"Bowie showed up wearing a T-shirt and a pair of jeans and a baseball cap,\" the film's cinematographer, Wally Pfister, recalled in 2006. \"And right away he told us: 'I'm not very good at <a href=\"http://www.screenactorsworkshop.com.au/acting/hitting-marks/\" title=\"\">hitting marks</a>.' Then of course he nailed his marks every time.'\"</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/yGPOq7fFahg?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"283\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/yGPOq7fFahg\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>Temple believes that Bowie's legacy as an actor lies in his more fleeting, enigmatic appearances. \"He's very good in supporting roles but I'm not sure, with the exception of The Man Who Fell to Earth, that he was really a lead actor. The charisma of that type of rock star was different to what was required of a movie star. Rappers in America have made a much more powerful transition to movies. I think it's hard to transfer what's so effective in one discipline to another without bringing along the baggage of the rock star image.\" This, argues Bowiefest co-curator Natasha Dack, is what makes him such a powerful screen presence. \"He doesn't disappear into his roles. It's always him. He's always got that essential Bowieness.\"</p>",
  "<p>Corruption is rife and getting worse in high-growth export markets promoted by the Foreign Office and Downing Street, according to a leading academic who advises corporations on leadership and ethical business practices.</p> <p>In the Bric countries \u2013 Brazil, Russia, India and China \u2013 and beyond to Mexico, South Africa and Indonesia, the demand for backhanders and financial favours is on the rise, says Andrew Kakabadse, a professor of international management development at Cranfield University. In eastern Europe, the situation has deteriorated since the financial crash, with corrupt contracts for new roads and infrastructure projects a feature of the former communist bloc states.</p> <p>\"In two-thirds of the world, one can't do business unless a bribe is given. From Russia to China to Turkey and Greece and most of South America, to many Asian countries, some transactional cost may be incurred \u2013 it is called bribery in the west, in other countries it is called a transactional cost,\" says Kakabadse.</p> <p>According to the academic, about 80% of deals outside Europe and the US are marred by attempts to extract bribes or kickbacks that costs billions of pounds. Ruling elites, middlemen and civil servants routinely demand cash and favours before allowing contracts to be signed. Sometimes they refuse to pay companies for goods and services, knowing local courts will dismiss applications from foreign-owned firms for compensation. Few cases come to court.</p> <p>Britain is keen to venture into new markets as part of what the chancellor, George Osborne, terms \"the march of the makers\", but Kakabadse's comments indicate that encounters with corruption could be one consequence of broaching some territories.</p> <p>Ukraine's president, Viktor Yanukovych, has conceded that his country is in the grip of a corruption epidemic. He says a crackdown on kickbacks to public officials is under way, though his critics allege he has presided over a sharp rise in corrupt practices since taking office. Elsewhere in eastern Europe, Hungary has failed to shake off bad habits and ranks alongside Romania, Bulgaria and the Balkan countries among states where corruption is rife.</p> <p>Multinationals are also becoming embroiled in graft cases. Last week Siemens paid \u20ac330m (\u00a3261.4m) to the Greek government to settle a long-running bribery case. Greece had claimed that bribes paid by the company from the late 1990s to 2007 cost taxpayers \u20ac2bn in overpriced hospital buildings and defence contracts. Greek officials who brokered the contracts gained millions of euros in kickbacks, and an investigation named 15 Greek politicians as also benefiting.</p> <p>Walmart, the US retailer, is examining a report alleging that it bribed hundreds of Mexican public servants to win planning permission to open stores. Documents are believed to show senior executives sanctioned the payments. Nonetheless, Transparency International, which ranks countries by their levels of corruption, says the situation is improving after several years of campaigning against corrupt practices.</p> <p>Few UK businesses will discuss brushes with corruption. This can include their exports being ensnared by corrupt port authority workers, local government staff and planning officers who impound goods and refuse to validate contracts, and high-ranking government officials demanding a slice of foreign company revenues. The engineering firm Mott MacDonald is one of the few to discuss the issue openly, citing corruption as a problem in several countries where it operates.</p> <p>Richard Williams, Mott MacDonald's boss, says many countries are \"ethically challenged\" and managers need to be aware of the demands for kickbacks. The CBI, the UK business lobbying group, echoes the Foreign Office in giving firms a straightforward message: comply with the Bribery Act, which came into effect last year. The act outlaws bribery by UK companies and their local partners. Facilitiation payments, which are bribes to get planning documents processed or the electricity in a local office switched on, are banned, as are favours to protect existing contracts or win business.</p> <p>Williams argues that it would be wrong to characterise Europe as a haven of clean business dealings. He says he wants to warn UK firms that they must be wary of jumping into new export markets blind to the potential for corrupt practices. In central Europe, which is still throwing off some of the worst practices of the communist era, poverty wages for civil servants encourage corrupt practices.</p> <p>\"It is generally state organisations that put a lake of treacle in front of you that must be crossed to win a contract. And even when you win, there is the possibility you have become a victim of something \u2013 a corrupt practice \u2013 that is going on without your knowledge,\" Williams says. \"In some countries we have restricted ourselves to working with the private sector.\"</p> <p>A recent report by the international anti-poverty charity Tax Justice Network found that efforts by global institutions to tackle bribery and corruption had failed, despite a raft of new laws and guidelines ostensibly barring businesses and public institutions from turning a blind eye. It said a crackdown by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, which polices anti-corruption rules put in place by nation states, was \"deeply flawed\" because it failed to look in detail at the role played by tax havens. Much of the cash paid in cases of bribery and corruption makes its way to tax havens to avoid local tax inspectors and bypass the police and officials entrusted with tackling corruption.</p>",
  "<p>Things might look tricky for the Tories right now but, once they win power, they normally manage to hold on to it. With only one exception, every Conservative government since the war has succeeded not merely in getting itself re-elected but re-elected at least twice in a row. They've done so by keeping these Ten Commandments.</p> <p><strong>1. Thou shalt position thyself as the party of the future</strong></p> <p>Successful Conservative governments show they're in touch with whatever passes for modernity at the time \u2013 sometimes simply by hitching a ride on the zeitgeist, sometimes by helping to create it.</p> <p><strong>2. Thou shalt make it thy mission to pigeonhole Labour as the party of the past</strong></p> <p>It may or may not be true. But the best Tory governments never stop reminding people that their main rival is a backward-looking dinosaur.</p> <p><strong>3. Thou shalt work hard to show that thou art on the side of the hardworking, but also fun-loving, ordinary man and woman</strong></p> <p>Overtime up, direct taxes and inflation down. Declare war on benefit scroungers, illegal immigrants and criminals. But spend time, too, on defending people's right to enjoy life's little pleasures against the frumps and the frowners.</p> <p><strong>4. Thou shalt take great care to protect and preserve the middle-class welfare state</strong></p> <p>No full-frontal attacks, then, on child benefit for the well-heeled or the hidden subsidies to home ownership, private and higher education and occupational pensions. At the same time carry on with a capped (and therefore regressive) property tax and NI system.</p> <p><strong>5. Thou shalt not \u2013 at least in private \u2013 buy into the myth that thou art this country's \"natural party of government\"</strong></p> <p>They never tire of trotting out the phrase in public. But behind closed doors Conservative strategists, especially when the party is in office, live in constant (but ultimately productive) fear lest a) Labour get its act together and mobilise what they suspect is its \"natural majority\" and b) disaffected Tories decide to register a protest vote with one of the smaller parties</p> <p><strong>6. Thou shalt spend whatever it takes to buy the very best opinion research in order to make sure that things don't go too far wrong or, if they do go wrong, to show how they can rapidly be put right</strong></p> <p><strong>7. Thou shalt not allow thy backbenchers - let alone thy grassroots - to drive policy lest they strand thee too far to the right of public opinion</strong></p> <p>Sure, ordinary Conservative MPs have sometimes stopped their cabinet colleagues doing things. But the number of times they've forced them into actions they really didn't want to take can be counted on the fingers of one hand.</p> <p><strong>8. Thou shalt strive to reassure the public - both in word and in deed - that the National Health Service is safe in thy hands</strong></p> <p>After making the mistake of voting against setting up the NHS after the war, the Tories have been determined to show that \u2013 whatever their reluctance to resource it properly or their enthusiasm for greater competition \u2013 they are as committed as Labour to the principle of a taxpayer-funded healthcare system free at the point of need.</p> <p><strong>9. Thou shalt work equally hard on trying to keep the media sweet</strong></p> <p>It's striking that every time Conservative governments have gone down to defeat, it's after they've somehow managed to alienate the Tory press.</p> <p><strong>10. Finally, thou shalt not be sentimental about thy leaders</strong></p> <p>Churchill aside, Tory leaders who are loved but then become a liability are dumped. The unloved are nevertheless allowed to stay on if they look like delivering victory or if there's simply no one else willing or able to take over.</p> <p>Conservative governments that keep these Ten Commandments carry on winning. Those that don't, go on to lose. So how are things looking for Cameron and co?</p> <p>At first glance, they don't look so good. The Tories may have pigeonholed Labour as washed-up profligates tied to the trade unions, but they would be hard-pressed to say exactly how they've captured the future. They certainly haven't delivered tangible improvements in the living standards of ordinary people. Nor, in spite of railing against health and safety and \"political correctness gone mad\", are they more obviously in touch with popular culture than Labour.</p> <p>Meanwhile, sheer lack of cash has made politically painful raids on the middle-class welfare state inevitable. And while complacency is unlikely to be a problem for the current leadership, they have \u2013 as happened in this year's budget \u2013 allowed themselves to be driven to do things that they have come to regret in order to prove their Conservative credentials to an increasingly restive parliamentary party.</p> <p>On the brighter side, and although the government's reaction to Lord Justice Leveson's recommendations will require some pretty deft handling, the Tory press is still on board. Benefit cuts, immigration caps and tougher sentences have all proved popular, while the downsides of the NHS reforms might not become obvious until after the next election.</p> <p>Finally, despite all those backbench wet-dreams about Boris Johnson, few would currently bet against Cameron leading his party into the next election. After all, whatever voters think of his party, they still prefer him to Ed Miliband. As a result, keeping the last of the Tories' Ten Commandments \u2013 especially if the economy finally begins to grow again as well \u2013 may just be enough to make up for breaking so many of the others.</p> <p>\u2022 A longer, print-only version of this article was published in <a href=\"http://www.soundings.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Soundings</a>, issue 51 summer 2012</p>",
  "<p>It's where we're all headed, of course, but not all composers make you aware of the fact. I'm talking not just about our inevitable demises, and the end of things as we know them, but something even bigger: the heat-death of the universe. That's how Thomas Ad\u00e8s describes the essential quality that he hears in <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aI0P1NnUFxc\">Gy\u00f6rgy Ligeti's</a> music, in every piece the Hungarian composer wrote, from his earliest works before he fled to the west under cover of sackcloth in a train during the Hungarian Uprising of 1956, to the very last music he wrote in the years before his death in Vienna in 2006.<br> That creative journey encompasses some of the richest music of the 20th century, and reveals an imaginative world of dizzying variety and expressive power. It's no surprise that of the entire post-war generation who were at the forefront of the avant garde in the 1950s and 60s, it's Ligeti who is played the most. And here are just three reasons why: listen to the <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWqxPp6SvMw\">Kyrie</a> of the Requiem for one of the darkest visions of musical terror ever imagined, then revel in the rhythmic glitter and complexity of a piece like the first <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Fi9PHRv8s4&amp;playnext=1&amp;list=PL020D844894B3765F&amp;feature=results_main\">Piano Etude</a>, and relish the warped harmonic world of the <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fo2qIKsSj8\">Horn Trio</a>, like looking at Brahms or Schumann through a distorting mirror.<br> But before we get to the potentially infinite visions of his music and what I think Ad\u00e8s means by that \"heat-death\" idea, Ligeti is the 20th century composer with the most cosmic connotations in popular consciousness. That's thanks to the way Stanley Kubrick used \u2013 <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk%3AGy\u00f6rgy_Ligeti#Lawsuit_over_Aventures_in_.222001.22.3F\">Richard Steinitz, in his biography</a>, relates how Ligeti's music was initially used without permission) \u2013 Ligeti's music in his movies starting with <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/36269/2001/review\">2001: A Space Odyssey</a>. In <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgqI32JX_jY\">2001</a>, and in <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN0Vqog6DqI&amp;feature=fvwrel\">The Shining</a>, too, Ligeti's music (along with Penderecki's and Bart\u00f3k's) is the sound of the other, the alien, the supernatural: passages from the Requiem dramatise the images of 2001's monolith \u2013 music of teeming, horrifying vastness and unearthly intensity - and Ligeti and the other modernists become the sounds of Jack Nicholson's psychological dissemblage in The Shining.<br> But the real otherness, the real distinctiveness of Ligeti's music is much richer than what Kubrick heard in it. From the start of his life in the west, Ligeti was a permanently provocative thorn in the side of any of the received wisdoms and ideologies of the avant garde. Performances of his orchestral pieces from the late 50 and early 60s, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JUxZcL6k90\">Apparitions</a> and <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aI0P1NnUFxc\">Atmosph\u00e8res</a> (which the Berlin Philharmonic and Simon Rattle play at the <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/proms/whats-on/2012/august-30/14328\">Proms on 30 August</a>) were a revelation of a new way of structuring music, of thinking about the possibilities for musical language. Instead of accepting at face value the diktats of the contemporary serialism, or any other of the \u2013isms of the 50s, Ligeti's idea was to make texture as much of a driving force in musical architecture as pitch or rhythm, developing what he called a \"micro-polyphony\" of incredibly dense pile-ups of musical lines so that you're more aware of an ever-changing amorphous cloud of sound than the movement of individual instruments or voices. Sounds complicated? It is to conceive and to compose, but not to listen to: these uncanny textures smother, ooze, and slide into your ears in those orchestral pieces, or the <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApdYpaPamMs\">Requiem</a>, or <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgRZnsAgKng\">Lux Aeterna</a> for 16 voices.<br> Ligeti was not thinking of this music in a vacuum, or pretending that he could provide the definitive answer to the challenges of finding a post-war musical idiom. He never trod any musical or political party line: not least because he had devastating personal experience of where that kind of thinking could lead. As Hungarian Jews, his brother and father were killed in concentration camps, but his mother survived Auschwitz; after the war, he saw the brutality and intolerance of communism at first hand. The last thing he wanted to become as a creative artist was a musical ideologue or despot. I met him when he was already ill in 2003, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2003/oct/17/classicalmusicandopera\">and he told me</a> that he was against the idea of \"plannification\" in music; saying how he could never make a pre-planned musical form as Stockhausen did, for example, in his Licht cycle. Ligeti also said to me, \"I am extremely far away from messianic thinking.\" </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395254753\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Music/Pix/pictures/2012/8/27/1346068339072/Gy-rgy-Ligeti-008.jpg\" alt=\"Gy\u00f6rgy Ligeti\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Gy\u00f6rgy Ligeti in 2000.

His searches and his influences spread far beyond the conventional confines of western culture: the music of the <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIJ9A8eV5QE\">Aka pygmies</a> was one of the catalysts that unlocked the last couple of decades of his creativity, above all the rhythmic invention of the <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5SJDLkE7Tg\">Piano Concerto</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0qoue0JbbU\">Piano Etudes</a>; he was impressed by the sounds and processes of American minimalism in a way that no other avant garde composer in Europe was; and his mind was open to the furthest reaches of contemporary mathematics. He became fascinated by the new ideas of chaos theory that <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heinz-Otto_Peitgen\">Heinz-Otto Peitgen</a> developed in the 1980s, and he extrapolated some of those ideas into music such as the <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiAmhiB2-fs\">4th movement</a> of the Piano Concerto, a chaotic ride to the abyss of continually disrupting, self-annihilating rhythmic patterns.<br> There are, however, constants in Ligeti's musical imagination. One of the most important is the idea of the absurd. Ligeti's world of imagination was simultaneously an asylum, a place of refuge, and a place to process the horror of the 20th century's great geo-political nightmares through which he lived. As a child, he invented a self-sufficient world of his creation that he called Kylwiria; as an adult, he was a lover of Lewis Carroll (he wanted to write an opera based on Alice in Wonderland) and the surreal linguistic games and imagery of Hungarian poet <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S\u00e1ndor_We\u00f6res\">S\u00e1ndor We\u00f6res</a>. One of his very last pieces was <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9bCApV0Ze4\">S\u00edppal, dobbal, n\u00e1diheged\u00fcvel</a>, \"With Pipes, Drums, Fiddles\", a setting of We\u00f6res's poems for percussion quartet and mezzo-soprano. They are, typically for Ligeti, on a tiny scale, and they make sounds like nothing else: each of the seven songs is simultaneously redolent of folk music and of modernist complexity, of childish immediacy and decidedly adult sophistication. Yet this music is absolutely, definitively new, and each number conjures its own little-but-large world of absurdist expression and resonance. They are also, I think, strangely melancholic. The Sippal songs have that quality that all the best absurdist poetry does of making you confront big ideas through lightness of touch, humour, and sleight of hand. </p> <p>Ligeti's pieces are often short, even miniature, but it's as if that smallness of scale makes you aware of some gigantic vacuum around them. The first Piano Etude writes out a nihilistically destructive game of rhythmic abandon, and it does it all in a couple of minutes; there are moments in the <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLy26ZZDRbc\">Violin Concerto</a> in which you don't know whether to laugh or cry at the sounds of the swanee whistles and ocarinas you're hearing in the orchestra; the whole of his opera <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vw8NoTrZBp4\">Le Grand Macabre</a> is both a witty satire on death and a chilling apocalyptic vision. In other words, you hear a reflection of the horrors that Ligeti knew and saw during his lifetime, and you hear also his coming to terms with art's essential futility in the face of all that tragedy. And yet, in the attempt to reflect on or escape from those experiences, Ligeti's music is a clarion-call for the fundamental importance of that supposedly futile artistic effort. It's music that gives you a glimpse of the heat-death of the universe \u2013 and the necessity to keep going, to keep composing, to keep living in the face of that nihilistic fate that awaits us, even if it all, in the end, amounts to nothing. It doesn't, of course \u2026 but it's that existential tension that gives Ligeti's music its humanity, and it's one reason his work, I think, will only become more and more central to every performer's repertoire and every music-lover's ears.</p> <h2>Five key links</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/sa7h7TwJzaM?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"276\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/sa7h7TwJzaM\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p><a href=\"http://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/sa7h7TwJzaM\">Reading this on mobile?

Further east, thousands of families in Miami and surrounding towns lost power, still several hours ahead of the worst expected conditions.</p> <p>Florida Power and Light, the state's largest electricity provider, amassed a large fleet of vehicles and put more than 8,000 engineers on standby to move into affected areas and restore power once conditions allowed.</p> <p>\"We've seen a gradual increase in thunderstorm activity,\" said Dr Rick Knabb, director of the hurricane centre.</p> <p>\"People should stay indoors.

Almost 14,000 people, mostly those still living in tents since the devastation of the 2010 earthquake, were evacuated to emergency shelters.</p> <p>\"The west and south-eastern departments are the most affected by the storm, causing the deaths of at least two persons and damaging bridges, roads and canals,\" United Nations spokeswoman Eliana Nebaa said in a statement.</p> <p>\"The storm is also responsible for flooding, high water areas, and damages to tents and tarps in some camps.\"</p> <p>Several people were also reported missing in the Dominican Republic following Isaac's crossing on Saturday.

  "<p>The British prime minister wants us to <a href=\"http://www.number10.gov.uk/news/david-cameron-new-york-university/\" title=\"\">stop talking about the quantity of aid we give</a>, and \"start talking about what I call the 'golden thread', which is you only get real long-term development through aid if there is also a golden thread of stable government, lack of corruption, human rights, the rule of law, transparent information\".</p> <p>This is not a new wheeze: David Cameron was talking about the golden thread before he was leader of the Conservative party. Although the idea has never been set out in detail, he has described in speeches what he calls \"enablers\" of development: transparency, openness, accountability, empowerment, freedom, rule of law, property rights, absence of corruption, free media, free and fair elections, trade, flexibility and civil society. (<a href=\"http://www.economist.com/node/9257593\" title=\"\">Tony Blair</a> and <a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2011/09/20/opening-remarks-president-obama-open-government-partnership\" title=\"\">Barack Obama</a> have similar ideas.)</p> <p>These ideas may reappear in the conclusions of the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/global-development/poverty-matters/2012/may/28/david-cameron-development-panel\" title=\"\">UN high-level panel on the future of the millennium development goals</a>, which Cameron co-chairs, so it's important to reflect now on whether the golden thread is good development policy.</p> <p>Critics fear it is a naive restatement of economic liberalism, which says developing countries are poor because of bad policies and weak institutions. This thinking led to the policy prescriptions of the 1980s <a href=\"http://www.who.int/trade/glossary/story094/en/index.html\" title=\"\">Washington consensus</a>, now widely regarded as a failure.</p> <p>But Cameron does not intend the golden thread as a return to the 1980s. <a href=\"http://conservativehome.blogs.com/toryleadership/files/cameron_to_cps_on_mcc.pdf\" title=\"\">In a 2005 speech</a> (pdf) he framed it as economic empowerment, which he explicitly contrasted with economic liberalism. What's the difference? Economic liberalism is about removing obstacles to enable firms to be more efficient; economic empowerment is about enabling society to evolve and change more rapidly and more fairly. This is not a semantic difference: the golden thread focuses on openness, transparency, accountability and a free press, none of which was ever part of the Washington consensus.</p> <p>The golden thread fits nicely with the growing interest in \"complexity\" in development. This idea, borrowed from physics and biology, <a href=\"http://www.cgdev.org/content/multimedia/detail/1426397/\" title=\"\">is explored in my online presentation</a>.</p> <p>According to this view, <a href=\"http://blogs.cgdev.org/globaldevelopment/2012/08/what-is-development.php\" title=\"\">development</a> is what happens when an economic, social and political system improves its ability to adapt and evolve. The enablers described by Cameron are plausible candidates for the kinds of policies that could accelerate the ability of an economic and social system to evolve. His view fits the mainstream development consensus that emphasises \"country ownership\" \u2013 that lasting change comes from within developing countries, rather than through policies imposed from outside. With its emphasis on transparency and accountability, the golden thread seeks to strengthen and accelerate those internal processes.</p> <p>But as development policy, the golden thread needs more work. It has three main shortcomings. First, it stresses free markets, jobs and growth, but not other ways to encourage positive social and economic change, such as reducing inequality, tackling the power of elites, providing social protection and ensuring a strong voice for civil society. There is a streak of laissez-faire in the choice of policies that does scant justice to the idea that societies can \u2013 and should \u2013 shape their own evolution.</p> <p>Second, the golden thread has said nothing about the need for changes to the global system, not just within developing countries. Rich countries could promote open, independent, legitimate and accountable institutions internationally; stop stitching up the appointment of top jobs; encourage companies in developing countries <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/global-development/2012/aug/23/uk-government-development-tax-rules\" title=\"\">to pay tax</a> to support the emergence of a social contract; and reform aid to make it less likely to undermine domestic accountability. Rich countries could promote transparency by requiring companies to publish details of their payments to developing countries, and property rights by accepting that a country's people, not illegitimate leaders, <a href=\"http://wenar.info/EIA_Clean_Trade.pdf\" title=\"\">own their natural resources</a> (pdf). Rich countries could support due process and the rule of law by closing financial havens and improving information exchange between tax and law enforcement authorities. They could promote openness and an exchange of ideas by making it easier for people from developing countries to study in their schools and universities, and by improving their immigration policies; and by ensuring that intellectual property rights do not obstruct the transfer of knowledge and ideas.</p> <p>Third, and most important, the golden thread has more to say about desirable dynamics in society than how to bring them about. We have had more failures than successes trying to nurture institutional and political reform in other countries, and efforts to transplant institutions from one situation to another generally end in failure. Understanding economic, social and political change through the lens of complexity should make us modest about our ability to engineer new systems. The golden thread lacks humility about the difficulty of affecting these changes, and risks appearing to offer itself as a universal blueprint for success.</p> <p>Cameron's golden thread fits well with the view that we should do what we can to help change occur from within, not impose it from outside. It emphasises the importance of institutions and policies that may strengthen and shape change. But it would benefit from a broader understanding of how societies change (eg attacking privilege, not just further liberalising markets), appreciation of the need for policy changes by rich countries to improve conditions for change in the developing world, and greater humility about the role that outsiders can play.</p> <p>\u2022 <em>A longer version of this article appears on the </em><a href=\"http://blogs.cgdev.org/globaldevelopment/\" title=\"\"><em>Centre for Global Development</em></a><em> website</em></p>",
  "<p>Behind the outrage surrounding George Galloway's<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2012/aug/22/george-galloway-sacked-holyrood-rape?newsfeed=true\"> ignorant comments</a> on rape is an unfolding tragedy that will eat away at the heart of local democracy in the years to come. Galloway has done his electoral constituency a great disservice because women, especially Muslim women, were key to delivering his Bradford West by-election victory by a margin of over 10,000 votes. When Galloway promised them a programme of political renewal and an era of citizen engagement they believed him and voted for change.<br> His promise was a big deal because minority women had been abandoned by mainstream politicians, who saw them primarily as an adjunct to their fathers, husbands and brothers. The assumption, predominantly from the local Labour party, was that if they could secure the male vote then they pretty much had the elections in the bag. This appeal to the 'biraderi' system of the clan vote relied on patriarchal connections between members of extended families. </p> <p>Mind you, any politician who may be minded to say \"I told you so\", need only look at the composition of Cameron's cabinet and the lack of minority women in their own ranks before criticising Galloway for breaking the 'contract' with his female voters.<br> Whatever your view of Bradford's newest MP - at least until his recent outburst in support of the controversial Wikileaks founder Julian Assange - it is the case that his vitory has drawn Muslim women into local politics at a neighbourhood level. They have been organising weekly policy meetings to discuss ways in which to improve the lives of the district's poor and marginalised groups; plans are afoot for an all-female convoy to Gaza and everywhere in many of the events organized by Respect, women stand alongside men as the public face of the Respect party. Equally the new breed of Respect councilors that has come to the fore on the back of Galloway's victory \u2013 many of them community workers deeply committed to regenerating Bradford \u2013 has breathed new life into local democracy. This had a profound impact on the political culture of the city: where in the past executive decisions were made with little accountability to the electorate, there has been a palpable shift towards greater transparency and scrutiny. Race is no longer a dirty word as there is an acknowledgement that despite the Coalition's attempts to kick the issue into the long grass, the fact that the city's migrant, Muslim and Bangladeshi communities continue to have among the worst life outcomes, requires politicians to grasp this policy nettle. In that sense Galloway has made a difference to how minority communities feel about themselves and the confidence with which they articulate their issues. As director of an organisation intimately involved with racial and social justice, I have long been concerned over the manner in which executive and political decisions have run roughshod over the needs of minority women. The stereotyping of Pakistani women as a group that refuses to integrate to the 'norms' of British life and the tendency to portray them a victims of forced marriages and honour killings are part of the disrespectful way in which minority women are discussed within the 'political' life of Bradford. The marginalisation of minority women is also particularly evident in the manner in which the knife of austerity has been wielded in relation to service cuts. The closure of swimming pools in some of the most deprived districts that specially cater to the needs of Muslim and migrant women; the targeting of Black and Minority Ethnic domestic violence services that are putting the lives of minority women at enormous risk; the decimation of BME voluntary and community sector organisations in the name of mainstreaming (and on the back of spurious equality impact assessments) - have all had a devastating impact on the lives of minority women. Previous attempts by JUST West Yorkshire to have a meaningful discussion on these critical issues have been sadly sidelined.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395245119\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/cartoons/2010/4/23/1272035985175/Salma-Yaqoob-006.jpg\" alt=\"Salma Yaqoob\" width=\"140\" height=\"130\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Respect leader, Salma Yaqoob Photograph: Anita Maric /News Team International</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Anita Maric (STF)/Anita Maric /News Team International</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p> <br>So the election of the five Respect councillors in the recent local elections has been a breath of fresh air. While probably still in the early flush of their political victory, they have been prepared to listen and advocate on issues affecting minority women. The resulting change in political culture is evident: increasingly politicians who would only turn up on their constituents door steps before the elections are increasingly coming down their rarefied poles and connecting with their female electorate.  Sadly Galloway's 'foot in mouth' gaffe threatens to reverse these positive developments. Perhaps we ought not to have been surprised at the turn of events because it was inevitable that he would, as most politicians do, disappoint his voters in the end. As a politician who sees the world as either black or white, it was unlikely that he could appreciate the shades of grey that a consideration on the matter of rape requires. While Galloway is not alone in refracting his world through this dialectic prism, the tragedy is that his failure to understand the lived realities of many women who suffer the ignominy of rape - whether in or out of marriage - is an affront to those women in his constituency who put faith in him by voting for him. The incident has clearly shone a negative light on Galloway and he has been exposed in his true colours. The tragedy is that his conduct over the last few days will undoubtedly return cynicism back into politics. There is likely to be a deep political chasm that will widen in the days to come and it is unlikely that any of the mainstream parties will be able to fill that breach. In that sense Bradford has reached a political crossroads in which the metaphorical clock of political engagement is likely to be turned a long way back.</p> <p><em><strong>Ratna Lachman</strong> is director of <a href=\"http://www.justwestyorkshire.info/\">JUST West Yorkshire</a> which promotes racial justice, civil liberties and human rights in the north of England.</em></p>"
