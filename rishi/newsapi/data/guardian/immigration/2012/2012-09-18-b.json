  "<p>While the 47% of Americans who don't pay federal income tax got most of the flak in Mitt Romney's remarks to a wealthy clique of his supporters \u2013 now captured for posterity thanks to a hidden video camera \u2013 let's not overlook the remaining 53%, many of whom also received flesh wounds and collateral damage from Romney's gaffe-operated machine-gun.</p> <p>Once the initial shock from Romney's comments passes, Latinos, women and Jewish voters will join senior citizens, members of the US military, compassionate conservatives and the less well-off as among those wounded by the Republican presidential candidate's potshots. At least Dick Cheney only ever hit one person while out hunting. Romney, while on the chase for donations, managed to wing much of the US electorate, in one way or another.</p> <p>Here's a gaffe-by-gaffe guide to Romney's self-immolation.</p> <h2>The 47%-plus</h2> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There are 47% who are \u2026 dependent upon government, who believe that they are victims \u2026 These are people who pay no income tax \u2026 So my job is is not to worry about those people. I'll never convince them they should take personal responsibility and care for their lives.</p> </blockquote> <p>The media's fact-checking machines have roared into life and churned out the many obvious flaws in Romney's statement: that the 47% he alludes to includes senior citizens depending on social security and Medicare, the working poor, members of the US military, and the out-of-work, as well as those who do pay taxes in the form of federal payroll taxes, state and municipal taxes, not to mention the national and local sales taxes that are impossible for most individuals to evade.</p> <p>Perhaps the oddest part of Romney's formulation is that these people somehow form an inevitable voting bloc for Obama. In the case of older retired voters \u2013 who don't pay income tax on social security and receive generous healthcare benefits from the state \u2013 that seems unlikely, given that national polls have the over-65s as one of Mitt Romney's strongest bases of support.</p> <p>What of the other parts of the 47% could Mitt Romney have cut off to spite his face-time with fundraisers?</p> <p>\u2022 Those unemployed or in difficulties in the course of this devastating recession, who Romney has been trying to woo with his promises of jobs, find themselves labelled as spineless.</p> <p>\u2022 Students, both because they typically don't pay federal income tax on account of low earnings and because many of them are also recipients of low-cost government grants or loans.</p> <p>\u2022 The working poor, such as a family of four earning a household total of $40,000. They may not have to pay federal income tax, thanks to earned income tax credits, but they can hardly be accused of either believing they are victims or of not taking responsibility for their lives.</p> <p>\u2022 Members of the US military serving in war zones, who are not required to pay federal income tax on their pay and benefits, and are directly employed by the US government, may not be happy at the thought they have a victim mentality.</p> <h2>Israel and Jewish voters</h2> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We have a potentially volatile situation but we sort of live with it, and we kick the ball down the field and hope that ultimately, somehow, something will happen and resolve it. We don't go to war to try and resolve it imminently.</p> </blockquote> <p>Another group of voters that Mitt Romney has had trouble reaching \u2013 in spite of repeated attempts \u2013 is Jewish voters. Poll after poll shows Obama with a wide margin in support, as Democrats have traditionally enjoyed. <a href=\"http://www.jpost.com/USPresidentialrace/Article.aspx?id=285336\">But a recent Gallup poll published by Buzzfeed Politics</a> put it at 70% for Obama and just 25% for Romney.</p> <p>The relationship of American Jews to Israel is a complex and multi-faceted one, but it's hard to imagine many shades of Jewish opinion finding something to celebrate in Romney's remarks on the Israel-Palestine issue: in essence, shrugging it off. </p> <p>The hawks \u2013 who would approve of Romney sabre-rattling remarks regarding Iran \u2013 would prefer more full-throated support from a American presidential candidate. But the majority, especially those who favour a two-state solution, would be unhappy with Romney's remarks that \"the pathway to peace is almost unthinkable to accomplish,\" having rattled off a weak series of objections, and appearing to think that the West Bank borders on Syria.</p> <p>The idea that a US president would merely punt on the most difficult issue in modern geopolitics \u2013 which is what kicking the ball down the field means \u2013 is among the most extraordinary remarks to come out of these tapes.</p> <h2>Women voters</h2> <p>Romney's failure to win more support from women voters is the over-riding reason for his failure to overtake Barack Obama in the opinion polls since becoming the GOP nominee. The Florida tapes suggest why: when prompted by a discussion with the wealthy donors, Romney offers only his wife Ann as evidence of his appeal to women voters.</p> <p>And even then, Romney makes what sound like cynical remarks about his wife's role in the political process: \"We use her sparingly now, in case people get tired or attack,\" he says, although he assures the room that she will be on the campaign trail frequently.</p> <p>Mitt's other meta-analysis again suggests a cold sense of calculation when speaking about his wife: \"We had a person named Hillary Rosen who attacked her and that made Ann more visible to the American people, which I think was helpful and gave her a platform she wouldn't have had otherwise.\" How gallant.</p> <p>The only other issue that women voters might be interested in, it would appear from this tape, is The View, the ABC daytime talkshow. Although Romney counsels The View, aside from one conservative \u2013 Elizabeth Hasselbeck \u2013 the other hosts are described as \"women who are sharp-tongued\".</p> <h2>Latino voters</h2> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Had [my father] been born of Mexican parents, I'd have a better shot of winning this. But he was unfortunately born to Americans living in Mexico. He lived there for a number of years. I mean, I say that jokingly, but it would be helpful to be Latino.</p> </blockquote> <p>A joke it may have been but Romney's remarks can't have helped him gain ground with yet another group he is struggling to win over: Latinos. \"The insult of all insults, Mitt Romney says if he was Latino he would win the presidential election, as if being Latino would have given him any advantage to win the White House,\" was one of many sharp responses, that one coming from Democratic congressman Xavier Becerra.</p> <p>Romney's joke came on the same day his campaign was boasting of a new and high-profile attempt to target Hispanic votes, including an appearance before the US Hispanic chamber of commerce. </p> <p>As with his remarks about women voters, Romney's comments suggest that identity rather than policies are what win elections, which may explain his personal shape-shifting. What he fails to understand is that his policies, especially on immigration and his risible \"self-deportation\" idea, are what is holding him back with Latinos, rather than his ethnic identity.</p> <h2>Compassionate conservatives</h2> <p>Compassionate conservatives do exist and many of them have been up in arms about the thrust of Romney's 47% remark \u2013 an \"imperious canard\", <a href=\"http://www.theamericanconservative.com/the-53-percent-are-at-the-trough-too/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=the-53-percent-are-at-the-trough-too\">as the American Conservative described it</a>.</p> <p>These are otherwise reliable Republican voters, including some Christians and evangelicals, who may find themselves less likely to support or even vote for a GOP presidential ticket headed by Romney.</p> <p>What defence there has been of Romney's remarks has claimed, without evidence, that those in the 47% don't necessarily define themselves as such. That has to be true to a point \u2013 who wants to agree that they are pathetic victims? \u2013 but here Mitt Romney has done the job for them: he has told them that they are victims, that they are feckless, and furthermore that he does not care for them. Romney has, in short, labelled them with a badge of shame.</p> <p>Rusty Reno, editor of First Things \u2013 the conservative religious journal founded by Richard John Neuhaus \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.firstthings.com/blogs/firstthoughts/2012/09/18/absurd-republican-rhetoric/\">dismantled Romney's \"absurd\" remarks with a quiet ferocity</a>. Sketching out the life of a family of a man earning $12 an hour in Omaha, Nebraska, Reno numbered the entitlements a family of modest means required \"for their survival, to say nothing of any opportunity to advance\".</p> <p>The modern welfare and entitlement state is a mess, he concluded: \"But it's historically, intellectually, and morally stultifying to imagine that this mess is somehow unnecessary, that it is the result of the laziness or irresponsibility of working people and the wicked plots of collectivist liberals.\"</p> <p>Writing in the American Conservative, Rod Dreher commented on Reno's criticism: \"I thought I was the only theocon Romney had lost, or just about lost, with his 47% talk. Guess not.\" <a href=\"http://www.theamericanconservative.com/dreher/romney-conservatism-of-the-heartless/\">Dreher described Romney's remarks as \"conservatism of the heartless,\"</a> and that they may have revived economics \"as a pressing moral concern for religious conservatives\".</p>",
  "<p>A key player in the transition to democracy in Spain, Santiago Carrillo Solares, who has died aged 97, was the the longest-serving secretary-general of the Partido Comunista de Espa\u00f1a (PCE). However, the changes he was keen to promote in the country's political system ultimately marginalised the party. He was left a commentator outside it, respected by some, hated by others, notably for his controversial involvement in the darkest episode of the republican defence of Madrid during the civil war.</p> <p>While the dictatorship of Francisco Franco had governed unchallenged since the end of that conflict in 1939, its response to the grave social problems caused by the 1973 energy crisis proved inadequate. Carrillo, formal leader of the PCE since 1959, had been in exile, mostly in France, and began to push for what he called \"the pact for liberty\", a broad opposition front. During Franco's illness of 1974, Carrillo launched the Junta Democr\u00e1tica in an attempt to ensure communist dominance of such moves.</p> <p>He also published two works, Demain l'Espagne (Spain Tomorrow, interviews published in Paris in 1974, though banned in Spain until 1976) and Eurocomunismo y Estado (Eurocommunism and the State, 1977), aimed at proving his moderation. They established him as a leading theorist of Eurocommunism.</p> <p>Franco died in November 1975, King Juan Carlos became head of state, and the following February a heavily disguised Carrillo returned secretly to Spain. By the time the police detained him for eight days in December 1976, he had already played a crucial role in pushing Adolfo Su\u00e1rez's interim government in the direction of reform.</p> <p>The PCE was legalised in 1977, and that June Carrillo was able to lead his party into Spain's first democratic elections since 1936. It gained 9% of the vote, coming third after Suarez's short-lived Uni\u00f3n de Centro Democr\u00e1tico (35%) and the Partido Socialista Obrero Espa\u00f1ol (PSOE, 29%): Carrillo himself became a member of the Congress of Deputies.</p> <p>This was a considerable achievement, but Carrillo had already passed his zenith. In October 1976 he had called a general strike in the hope of provoking what he called the \"ruptura democr\u00e1tica\" (democratic break) \u2013 a scenario resembling the one that had seen the collapse of the dictatorial regime in Portugal. The failure of the strike had opened the way to the more moderate scenario of the \"ruptura pactada\" (negotiated break), advocated by the socialist leader Felipe Gonz\u00e1lez.</p> <p>In fact, the transition to democracy proceeded along the lines of negotiated consensus between the democratic opposition and the most progressive elements of the Franco regime. The PCE was wracked by demands for reform, the authoritarian habits of the aged, exiled leadership sitting ill with the young intellectuals of the internal resistance to Franco.</p> <p>In response to proposals for the reincorporation of the reformists (known as \"renovators\") whom he had previously expelled, Carrillo resigned as secretary general in the summer of 1982. With elections imminent, he was persuaded to reconsider, but the collapse of the PCE vote from the 11% of&#xa0;1979 to 4% as Gonz\u00e1lez's PSOE came to power in October 1982 ensured that he did indeed resign. When his successor, Gerardo Iglesias, sided with the renovators, Carrillo was dropped from the central committee in April 1985.</p> <p>He formed a new workers-communist unity party, the Partido de los Trabajadores-Unidad Comunista, and stood unsuccessfully for parliament in the 1986 elections, in the 1989 European elections, and for parliament again in 1989. Two years later, Carrillo agreed to the mass incorporation of the Partido de los Trabajadores de Espa\u00f1a into the PSOE. He did not go with it, on the grounds that his long track record as a communist prevented him from playing an active role in the PSOE. However, his wife, Carmen Men\u00e9ndez, did join.</p> <p>Born in Gij\u00f3n, on Spain's northern Atlantic coast, Carrillo had in fact started his political life in the PSOE, in which his father, Wenceslao, was a prominent figure. The teenage Santiago was drafted into the party's youth movement, the Federaci\u00f3n de Juventudes Socialistas (FJS), and was a particularly vocal advocate of ultra-revolutionary responses to rightwing obstruction of reform in Spain's Second Republic. Accordingly, in 1934 he was elected secretary-general of the FJS, which became the most radical section of the socialist party.</p> <p>The most dramatic fruit of socialist radicalisation was the uprising by miners in Asturias in October 1934. After it was defeated, Carrillo was jailed. From there he denounced the moderate and centrist sections of the PSOE, and called for the \"bolshevisation\" of the party. However, he accepted the entry of both the PSOE and the PCE into the electoral alliance known as the Popular Front. When he was released from prison after its victory in the February 1936 elections, Carrillo was invited to visit Moscow, where he was brought into the communist orbit.</p> <p>On his return, he promoted the formation, in April, of the Juventudes Socialistas Unificadas (United Socialist Youth), through which the PSOE lost the FJS to the Communist party, of which he was probably already a member. By then, the civil war had broken out, and Carrillo's energy and organisational skills were at the service of the republican war effort.</p> <p>The PCE played a crucial role therein. In early November 1936, with Franco's African Army at the gates of Madrid, the republican government was evacuated to Valencia. Carrillo, now 21, was made councillor for public order in the Defence Junta left behind in the capital, an indication of his special relationship with the Russians. On the same day he announced publicly that he had joined the PCE.</p> <p>He immediately faced a terrible problem. The insurgent General Emilio Mola declared in a radio broadcast that the four rebel columns converging on Madrid would be joined by a \"fifth column\" of nationalist sympathisers, prompting official removals of rightwing and suspect army officers from Madrid's prisons on a large and horrific scale. Carrillo was technically responsible for these prisoners. Russian advisers insisted that they be evacuated. Thus about 2,000 were taken by bus and shot at the villages of Paracuellos del Jarama and Torrej\u00f3n de Ardoz.</p> <p>It was the greatest single atrocity in republican territory during the war, but exact responsibility remains obscure. Communist claims that the buses had been waylaid at anarchist control posts on the outskirts of Madrid were unconvincing. Inevitably, Francoist propaganda built on it to create a picture of \"red barbarism\", and thereafter lost no opportunity to saddle Carrillo with the blame. In fact, the evacuation was a deliberate military decision, taken collectively by various authorities of which Carrillo was only one. However, he was a crucial element in the organisation of the process and his protestations of ignorance were untruthful.</p> <p>In France at the end of the civil war, Carrillo ingratiated himself further with the communist hierarchy by writing an open letter denouncing his father for joining the junta set up by Colonel Segismundo Casado in a vain attempt to negotiate with Franco. From September 1939, Carrillo spent six months in Moscow as secretary to the Communist Youth International. After working for the Comintern and with PCE exiles in Cuba, Mexico and Argentina, he returned to Europe to work for the reorganisation of the party within Spain.</p> <p>In the autumn of 1944, many of the Spanish maquisards who been prominent in the French resistance began to drift to the Spanish border. That October, the PCE delegation in France under Jes\u00fas Monz\u00f3n authorised an over-optimistic and inadequately prepared incursion through the Valley of Aran in the Pyrenees. Snowbound most of the year and sparsely populated by shepherds and woodcutters, it was no place to pick up support. With Franco's well-equipped army on the point of annihilating the invaders, Carrillo turned up with sufficient authority from Moscow to order the abandonment of the operation.</p> <p>Thereafter, Carrillo was de facto leader of the PCE in France, the most important section of the exiled party after that in Moscow, where Dolores Ib\u00e1rruri (La Pasionaria, the passion flower) was secretary-general. In 1948 he was part of a three-person delegation interviewed by Stalin about the situation in Spain. The Soviet leader recommended the abandonment of guerrilla action against Franco in favour of infiltrating the Falangist trade union organisation.</p> <p>Carrillo had separated from his first wife, Chon, in Cuba in 1944. He met Carmen Men\u00e9ndez, a party militant in 1947, and he married her (or openly acknowledged her as his partner) in Moscow in 1949. She was to be his faithful \u2013 and equal \u2013 partner until his death. Back in France, they lived as Monsieur and Madame Giscard, and had three sons, Santiago, Jos\u00e9 and Jorge. From the immensely powerful position of organisation secretary, Carrillo began to work towards taking over the PCE by presenting himself as an advocate of internal reform.</p> <p>In 1954 he called for a renovation of party structures, as a result of which the central committee was expanded to include cadres from within Spain. A showdown came at the end of 1955. When the bulk of the PCE leadership denounced the United Nations' incorporation of Spain, Carrillo praised it as a triumph for the Soviet policy of coexistence. His gamble was justified when La Pasionaria eventually threw her weight behind Carrillo after Nikita Khrushchev denounced Stalin in his \"secret speech\" of February 1956.</p> <p>Carrillo pressed his advantage, and that summer persuaded the PCE to accept a policy of national reconciliation to facilitate alliance with the new non-communist opposition to Franco. He was now virtually acting secretary-general of the PCE, and the post formally became his in December 1959, when La Pasionaria was elevated to the symbolic post of party president.</p> <p>Convinced that his new policy would quickly promote a great national alliance against Franco, Carrillo came into conflict with two erstwhile allies in the struggle for internal reform. Fernando Claud\u00edn was the PCE's most acute thinker and Jorge Sempr\u00fan the intrepid organiser of the secret networks within Spain. Both believed that economic growth in Spain would increase support for the regime.</p> <p>After a bitter debate, Carrillo had them expelled in early 1965, only to spend the next few years incorporating their ideas into his many writings, particularly his book of that year, Despu\u00e9s de Franco \u00bfQu\u00e9? (After Franco, What?).</p> <p>Carrillo's move towards a more liberal position was accelerated dramatically by the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia in August 1968. To maintain the PCE's credibility as a moderate democratic segment of the anti-Franco opposition, he was forced to condemn the Russians. In 1970 Carrillo simply expelled those hardline Stalinists who opposed him.</p> <p>After the upheavals of the 1970s and 80s, Carrillo made a living as a writer. Although he was never a sophisticated theorist, Eurocommunism and the State had made him an international reputation. He wrote an account of his year on the run, El A\u00f1o de la Peluca (The Year of the Wig, 1987) and of his role in the transition, Memoria de la Transici\u00f3n (1983). In 1993 he scored a huge commercial success with his lengthy but disappointingly anodyne memoirs. Other volumes followed, on the Second Republic and the civil war, but he never gave away the secrets that could have done so much to illuminate the history of the period. In late 2000 he published \u00bfHa Muerto el Comunismo? (Is Communism Dead?).</p> <p>Carrillo also became a regular interviewee on television and radio, recognisable by a gruff, knowing voice that reflected seven decades of chain-smoking. He attributed his iron constitution to the advice given him in Moscow in 1936 to take an aspirin every day.</p> <p>As Spaniards began to investigate the crimes of Franco, the consequent backlash made Carrillo the target of ultra-rightwing attacks. A wall adjacent to his apartment block was scrawled with the words \"Carrillo, murderer, we know where you live.\" In October 2005, when the Universidad Aut\u00f3noma de Madrid granted him an honorary doctorate, proceedings were disrupted by militants chanting \"Paracuellos Carrillo asesino!\"</p> <p>He shrugged it all off. In private, his affability and droll conversation belied his background as a party disciplinarian. Then, too, he would recount anecdotes that showed that from the age of 15 until his death he was a cunning old fox, a thoroughly political animal. His wife and sons survive him.</p> <p><em>\u2022 </em>Santiago Carrillo Solares, politician, born 18 January 1915; died 18 September 2012</p>",
  "<p>Back in the early 1940s my grandfather had a great idea. Noting the obsession Californians have with perfectly green front lawns, he decided that what they needed was an automatic sprinkler system. He lavished time and love on it, inventing this and fine-tuning that, and eventually came up with what was essentially an electric clock that could be timed to turn water valves on or off at given times of the day and night. Patent number 2311108 was duly filed in 1943, at which point my grandfather started knocking on manufacturers' doors. It was a long, arduous process. Finally, in 1950, after endless discussions, the Moody Rainmaster hit the stores. It earned my grandfather a modest income.</p> <p>Recently, I decided to follow in his footsteps, but apply a little 21st-century know-how to the mix. Online I found a few like-minded souls interested in producing an improved water sprinkler. We used open-source software to help us create a sprinkler system not only capable of being operated remotely via an app by worried gardeners on holiday, but also sophisticated enough to factor in the latest local weather forecasts before deciding whether to switch the system on or off. We then sent our designs to an assembly house who duly came up with a smart-looking finished product. It has proved quite popular. It took my grandfather a decade and a small fortune to perfect his device and market it. It took us a few months and $5,000.</p> <p>And that in a nutshell is the Maker movement \u2013 harnessing the internet and the latest manufacturing technologies to make things. The past 10 years have been about discovering new ways to work together and offer services on the web. The next 10 years will, I believe, be about applying those lessons to the real world. It means that the future doesn't just belong to internet businesses founded on virtual principles. but to ones that are firmly rooted in the physical world.</p> <p>This has massive implications not just for would-be entrepreneurs but for national economies. The fact is that any country, if it wants to remain strong, must have a manufacturing base. Even today, about a quarter of the US economy rests on the creation of physical goods. A service economy is all well and good, but eliminate manufacturing and you're a nation of bankers, burger flippers and tour guides. As for software and information industries, they may get all the press, but they employ just a small percentage of the population.</p> <p>The nascent Maker movement offers a path to reboot manufacturing \u2013 not by returning to the giant factories of old, with their armies of employees, but by creating a new kind of manufacturing economy, one shaped more like the web itself: bottom-up, broadly distributed, and highly entrepreneurial. The image of a few smart people changing the world with little more than an internet connection and an idea increasingly describes manufacturing of the future, too.</p> <p>It's almost a cliche that anyone with a sufficiently good software idea can create a fabulously successful company on the web. That's because there are practically no barriers preventing entry to entrepreneurship online: if you've got a laptop and a credit card, you're in business. Manufacturing has traditionally been regarded as something else entirely. But over the past few years, something remarkable has begun to happen. The process of making physical stuff has started to look more like the process of making digital stuff.</p> <p>Various innovations are helping to make this possible. The first, of course, is the crowdsourcing power of the internet \u2013 if you don't know all the answers, there is someone out there who will. Put out a call for help on a blog or online forum, and somewhere there will be an expert prepared to help you. The second innovation is the increasing sophistication of design programs that can take raw ideas and transform them into executable files. Just as word-processing software has become ever simpler and more intuitive for the user, so Cad (computer-aided design) programs are becoming simultaneously more sophisticated and easier to handle. You design something; the Cad program works out how it can be&#xa0;produced.</p> <p>And then there is the first generation of 3D printers. These take \"geometries\" on screen (3D objects that are created with the same sorts of tools that Hollywood uses to make computer generated movies and turn them into objects that you can pick up and use. Some 3D printers extrude molten plastic in layers to make these objects, while others use a laser to harden layers of liquid or powder resin so the product emerges from a bath of the raw material. Yet others can make objects out of any material from glass, steel and bronze to gold, titanium or even cake frosting. You can print a flute or you can print a meal. You can even print human organs of living cells, by squirting a fluid with suspended stem sells on to a support matrix.</p> <p>What's important here is not so much current reality as potential. 3D printers, laser cutters and \"CNC\" (computer numerical control) machines, which use a drill bit to shape a block of material, are already sophisticated devices \u2013 a few years ago they would have seemed distinctly sci-fi \u2013 but I suspect that they resemble the technology of 10 years hence in much the same way that the primitive single-colour dot matrix printers of the 1980s resemble the colour laser printers we having sitting in our homes today. Even now scientists are talking about creating manufacturing tools that use \"structural DNA\" to create physical objects. In other words, the technology still has a long journey to make. However, its liberating implications are already there, and I believe that when they are combined with other online innovations, a very powerful manufacturing force is created.</p> <p>First of all, such technology helps remove the shackles from innovation. Until now, the creative process has been beset with obstacles, from the problems inherent in creating a prototype, to the difficulties of persuading a third party to become involved, to the expense of the final launch. And, of course, there's no guarantee of ultimate success.</p> <p>Now, however, things are looking rather different, both at the innovation and the selling stages.</p> <p>Take Alex Andon, for example. After graduating in 2006, he moved to the San Francisco Bay Area for a biotech job. But his real passion was jellyfish, which he had first encountered while sailing in the British Virgin Islands as a teenager. He quit his job and set up a company in a friend's garage to make custom jellyfish tanks with special pumps (a conventional pump will suck in a jellyfish and rip it to pieces), custom water-flow systems to keep the jellyfish off the sides and colourful LED lighting. That in itself was no small feat.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396376778\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/18/1347988412127/jellyfish-001.jpg\" alt=\"jellyfish\" width=\"210\" height=\"330\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Alex Andon's jellyfish tank.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Where Alex also scored, though, was in his ability to test the market before he launched his product. He opted to go via the crowdfunding website <a href=\"http://www.kickstarter.com/\" title=\"\">Kickstarter</a> to see whether people were interested in what he could offer them. If they were, he invited them to help fund his start-up in return for one of his Desktop Jellyfish Tanks at a discount. His aim was to raise $3,000. After a month he had raised more than $130,000. He had managed both to market-test his idea and find his first customers without having to go to the risky expense of first filling a warehouse (or his bedroom) with jellyfish tanks.</p> <p>It's not difficult to see how Maker technology suits this sort of niche enterprise. The chances are that a savvy and committed market already exists for the right product, and, thanks to the internet, it's relatively easy to find it. What's more the current manufacturing technology that supports Makers is ideally suited to small batches of bespoke products \u2013 from customised plastic toys to tailored clothes. With a conventional factory, you fix on a design and mass-produce it; start up is expensive, but mass-production involves compensating economies of scale. With a 3D printer, start up is cheap, but there are no economies of scale to&#xa0;be gained: product number 150 will&#xa0;cost&#xa0;you precisely the same to create as product number 1. That precludes success in the mass market, but does set you up to succeed in a niche market that by its very nature is&#xa0;less price sensitive.</p> <p>Moreover, you can, if you choose, make every item bespoke: number 150 does not have to be precisely the same in appearance as number 100. And you can manufacture at home, perhaps using your own 3D printer (in the US prices are already dropping to $1,000) or sending your files to a third party fitted out with the necessary kit.</p> <p>Having said that, I don't believe that Makers enterprises have to remain small-scale. Many, of course, will opt to do so, creating customised goods for a specialist market. Others, though, can utilise all that the Maker technology has to offer to get an enterprise off the ground, road test its products, respond to customer feedback, and then build a larger-scale company. What they'll have going for them in addition \u2013 and it's something that many larger companies lack \u2013 is agility and flexibility built into their DNA.</p> <p>Imagine a new company, WindCo, making its first product: a small backyard wind turbine generator. They&#xa0;make the first prototype themselves, as well as a handful of others. Then, it's time to go into serious&#xa0;production. WindCo is small, and they don't have sufficient manufacturing capacity themselves, so they outsource to a factory in China that can handle small batches cheaply.</p> <p>If the product is successful and demand builds, they may well opt to move production back home to cut out delays. If it's astonishingly successful, then they may decide to move production to a different factory in China that specialises in bulk manufacturing. They have to be flexible because their business is constantly evolving. They are able to be flexible because their design files are digital, the tooling costs of setting up a new manufacturing operation are minimal, and they all use the same robotic machinery.</p> <p>This adaptive business of the future will need to be accommodating in other ways, too. It needs to be in constant contact with its customers and be prepared to respond quickly to their feedback and criticism. It needs to be able to draw on skills wherever they are, not merely on people who happen to be close to home. The co-founder of a small robot aeroplane enterprise I run, for example, is not someone who answered an ad, but an enthusiast who came to my attention when he started posting inspired ideas for improvements on a online forum I&#xa0;was hosting.</p> <p>That this can work is demonstrated by the success of a Colorado-based company, <a href=\"http://www.sparkfun.com/\" title=\"\">Sparkfun</a>, which operates in one of the most ruthlessly cut-throat of all areas of business \u2013 electronics. Back in 2003 its founder, Nathan Seidle, was an undergraduate engineering student, who was finding it frustratingly difficult to locate electronic components that he needed for his projects. Today, Sparkfun designs and manufactures specialist printed circuit boards, using sophisticated pick-and-place robot machines to assemble them. Its website makes a major feature of its blog, with chatty tutorials and videos from employees, and forums that are full of customers helping one another.</p> <p>Its employees are young, passionate and appear to totally love their jobs. Dogs and hobbies are indulged at work (though not on the production floor); tattoos and indie punk rock reflect its culture. It's a far cry from the \"dark satanic mill\" vision of manufacturing \u2013 much closer in fact to the maverick image of software companies in their startup days.</p> <p>And it works. Today Sparkfun has more than 120 employees and annual revenues of around $30 million. It's growing by 50% a year. A basketball-court-sized ground floor is dominated by robotic electronic production lines, running day and night. Daily blog posts and tutorials have turned its retail website into a high-traffic community, with more than 50,000 visitors a day.</p> <p>The Maker movement has a long way to go before it can really be said to have come of age. But that doesn't mean it should be ignored or regarded solely as a hobbyist's or niche manufacturer's paradise. It represents the first steps in a different way of doing business. Rather than top-down innovation by some of the biggest companies in the world, we're starting to see bottom-up innovation by countless individuals, including amateurs, entrepreneurs and professionals. We've already seen it work before, in bits, from the original PC hobbyists to the web's citizen army. Now the conditions have arrived for it to work again, at even greater, broader scale, in atoms. If the Second Industrial Revolution was the Information Age, then I would argue that a Third Industrial Age is on its way: the age of&#xa0;the Makers.</p> <p><em>Makers: The New Industrial Revolution by Chris Anderson is published by Random House Business Books, priced \u00a320.

  "<p>The UK Border Agency has disclosed that it is working on plans for fast-track passport lanes for rich travellers at Heathrow and other British airports so it can avoid a repeat of the two-hour queues witnessed this year. Brian Moore, the departing head of the UK Border Force, told MPs that \"high-value\" people who were considered valuable passengers by the airlines or valuable to the British economy would be given priority treatment at immigration control under the plans.</p> <p>It would be an extension of a priority queueing system tried out this year at Heathrow, under which passengers from Australia, Canada, the US, New Zealand and other mainly \"old Commonwealth\" countries who do not need a visa to enter Britain would be fast-tracked.</p> <p>Moore told the Commons home affairs select committee: \"It is an idea that officials are discussing with port operators. It will then go back to ministers for them to consider whether and how it is going to be progressed. It is an idea that is being&#xa0;pursued.\"</p> <p>Keith Vaz, the committee chair, pressed Moore as to whether it meant the super-rich would have a fast-track into Britain. Moore said it would cover people who were \"valuable to the economy and were valued by the airlines\". He said the move was intended to demonstrate that Britain was \"open for business\".</p> <p>The plan is likely to be seen as highly divisive, especially if there is any repeat of the two-hour queues at passport control earlier this year and in the runup to the Olympics. Even at normal times, passengers from outside the EU are expected to queue for up to 45 minutes to get through passport control at Heathrow. The airport has a target to keep passport queues below 25 minutes for passengers with EU&#xa0;passports.</p> <p>UKBA declined to give any further detail on who would qualify as a \"high-value business person\" to get such preferential treatment. But it could be safely assumed that frequent business-class flyers might well be nominated by airlines to qualify. Other wealthy individuals and their families that British embassies, consulates and large companies nominate as valuable to the UK economy might also be offered such a fast-track into Britain.</p> <p>Moore said similar fast-track schemes were in operation in other countries, with some airlines offering first-class ticket holders speedy passport checks.</p> <p>The super-rich from outside Europe have already been offered a fast track to settle in Britain under immigration rule changes proposed last year. Overseas \"super-investors\" who are willing to keep \u00a35m in a UK bank account are to be given the right to stay indefinitely in Britain after only three years, two years faster than the five-year wait imposed on every other migrant. An overseas investor who is willing to deposit more than \u00a310m will be able to stay after an even shorter period: two years.</p> <p>This contrasts sharply with the new minimum income threshold of \u00a322,400 a year introduced in July for a British citizen wanting to bring an overseas spouse and child into the country to live with them.</p>",
  "<p>Garden gnomes lining hotel ballroom corridors, models snaking around a skate park, pinging neon and a designer playing the organ at her own show. The final day of London fashion week provided a lively line up of handbag labels Mulberry and Anya Hindmarch alongside two bold shows from emerging talents Thomas Tait and Simone Rocha.</p> <p>Mulberry's show now follows a well oiled format. There's a typically zany concept \u2013 this season gnomes and fabric stuffed lizards. The customary celebrity front row featured usual suspects Kate Moss, Alexa Chung and Lana Del Rey. The soundtrack was upbeat and there was yet another appearance of a dog on the catwalk.</p> <p>Designer Emma Hill said the collection had begun with a picture of ice-lollies, which eventually led her to an English country garden theme. She mixed this with the 1970s \u2013 leather flares appeared on the catwalk. A gecko and floral print biker jacket had an oversized mannish feel while dresses featured a side detail of swinging pleats.</p> <p>But while the clothes are perfectly nice, essentially they are a spin-off to what is a very successful handbag business. A new bag \u2013 the Willow tote with a detachable clutch \u2013 is Hill's big idea for next spring. \"It's very Mulberry to have a commonsense English approach to your bag,\" she said. \"It needs to be useful as well as beautiful.\"</p> <p>In another hotel ballroom, Anya Hindmarch's Pomp &amp; Pleasure presentation saw the designer once again use a moving carousel set to showcase her latest accessories. Staged like a play with different scenes designed for different groups of accessories, the set featured drawings of Regency period figures and furniture. Clutches with tassels looked like cushions. Mini apple and pear shaped handbags decorated \"the parlour\". At its climax Hindmarch was revealed behind an organ supposedly playing the show's music.</p> <p>Many of the younger buzz labels this season have presented very polished collections with increased commercial edge. The only problem with this is that, with the odd exceptions \u2013 Christopher Kane and Jonathan Saunders \u2013 many shows have lacked an element of edge-of-your-seat surprise that London's reputation is built on.</p> <p>Luckily, Tait and Rocha stepped forward on Tuesday morning to deliver two very different but punchy shows.</p> <p>At a skate park on the South Bank, models at Tait's show wove in and out of graffiti and neon strip lights in space age squat heeled white boots, couture-style coats and Japanese leather biker jackets. It was a well-timed jolt of neon yellow and electric blue with architectural shapes and interesting textures.</p> <p>Vogue's market editor, Emma Elwick-Bates, declared it an immediate hit. \"It was an accomplished performance with modern verve and modern silhouettes,\" she said.</p> <p>Rocha cut her catwalk teeth with Lulu Kennedy at the Fashion East initiative. Her third solo show built upon signature ideas of mixing romance with a certain boyishness while also presenting a typically brilliant mix of fabrics, including embroidered organza, patent leather and embellished plastic.</p> <p>\"Youthful and a bit sinister,\" explained Rocha backstage. \"I was reflecting on my own youth and hanging out in the lane behind my house in Dublin after school with boys.\"</p> <p>Kennedy thought it was a \"perfectly judged\" collection. \"The buyers sitting next to me were going berserk, and so was Alexa [Chung] a few seats down. It was an amazing response,\" she said.</p>",
  "<p>Political refugees who risk their lives to sail from Africa to Italy are being abandoned to a life of poverty and isolation, according to a report.</p> <p>The damning survey of Italy's human rights record, released on Tuesday by the Council of Europe, follows the outlawing by the European court of human rights this year of Italy's \"push back\" policy of intercepting migrants in the Mediterranean and handing them over to Libyan patrols.</p> <p>Those migrants who do make it to Italy and qualify for refugee status \u2013 now 58,000 \u2013 are being relegated to the margins of society and are increasingly victims of racist violence, the report found.</p> <p>Investigators focused on the so-called palace of shame, an abandoned eight-storey building on the outskirts of Rome where 800 refugees from war-torn countries in the Horn of Africa camp out, with one bathroom for every 100 residents.</p> <p>\"I was shocked,\" said the council's commissioner for human rights, Nils Mui\u017enieks, after visiting the building. \"Italy does a good job granting refugee status but is no help afterwards, while many other countries give access to housing, citizenship, job and language training and education.\"</p> <p>Donatella D'Angelo, a doctor who gives volunteer assistance at the building said the refugees had been haphazardly granted residency permits for other neighbourhoods in Rome, \"which means they cannot get access nearby to schools or medical care\", she said.</p> <p>\"Some parts of the building are flooded, infectious illnesses are common and the illegal electricity hook-up is intermittent,\" she added.</p> <p>Bihirddim Abdellah, 29, a Sudanese refugee who has lived in the building for five years, said he feared for the women and children's health as winter approached. \"We have no rights, and apart from occasional manual labour there is no work,\" he said.</p> <p>The report also said that despite the Italian government's intention to promote the social integration of Roma and Sinti families in Italy, forced evictions to newly built, segregated camps continue. Many such families have lived in Italy for years.</p> <p>One camp isolated on the edge of Rome \u2013 which the city describes as an \"equipped village\" \u2013 hosts 1,100, is surrounded by a metal fence and video cameras and accessible through a controlled entrance.</p> <p>\"Putting ethnic minorities in segregated camps is not in line with human rights obligations,\" said Mui\u017enieks. \"The alternative was to ask if the families wanted social housing or legalised settlements.\"</p> <p>The report states that staff at a nearby train station were told to count and report \"possible passengers of Roma ethnicity\", while buses stopping at the camp were labelled \"N\" for nomad on the side, added Mui\u017enieks, \"despite the fact most Roma are not nomadic\".</p>",
  "<p>Many people in higher education think of distance learning the same way one would a distant cousin: aware of its existence, perhaps even thinks well of them, but reluctant to pick up the phone and find out how they are doing. And like the cousin you don't know well, the justification for your lack of interest is that distance learning is just a little bit awkward.</p> <p>Distance learning is reputedly characterised by clunky online interfaces, isolation and generally conspiring to make students \u2013 and staff \u2013 miss out on so many of the things that make university life so attractive: daily interaction with people who think like we do. We imagine it to be just a depleted version of the 'real thing'.</p> <p>But in the same way that reconnecting with a distant relative can teach you things about yourself that daily interaction with your closest friends can't, distance learning has things to offer that are difficult to find in a traditional university course. An good example of this is its capacity to instantly connect to people from all over the world. At the <a href=\"http://gse.cat.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Centre for Alternative Technology</a>, we run a range of specialist <a href=\"http://gse.cat.org.uk/gse-postgraduate-study\" title=\"\">renewable energy and sustainable architecture masters degrees</a>. Our distance learning course has enabled us to create a course that gives sustainability a global perspective.</p> <p>A distance learning course puts students into a classroom that spans the whole world. It means the range of perspectives that are brought into that classroom are more diverse than any other method of learning. For a course based on sustainability this is crucial. Sustainability shouldn't be taught as an abstract theory amongst a group of people that all basically come from the same background, it should be taught as a discourse amongst people with diverse experiences of its practical application. Many other fields would benefit from similar thinking.</p> <p>Of course, all university courses will have some international dimension to their intake. But the barriers of increasingly restrictive visa regulations and high cost mean that, in reality, physically attending a course in the UK is becoming increasingly difficult for many overseas students. Academic discourse will suffer if we can't find alternative models, such as distance learning, for bringing students together.</p> <p>Without a doubt there are features of attending university that distance learning courses will never be able to emulate. I've spoken to students on residential degrees at the Centre for Alternative Technology who say they learn as much from chatting to lecturers or other students in the tea breaks as they do from the lectures. Earl Wilson's quip: \"Science may never come up with a better office communication system than the coffee break\", rings true. Still, there are also unique benefits to joining the online classroom that can never be found in a traditional university course.</p> <p>If the benefits of higher education rest on the personal connections that students aspire to make, then we must ask what experiences are of value \u2013 if students just want to meet other people their own age to go out drinking with on a Friday night then sure, that is not what a distance learning course offers. If, however, students are looking to be part of seminars with people with a genuine plethora of life experiences, this is the extra element that a distance learning course can offer.</p> <p>Distance learning doesn't create distances between people, it bridges the distances that already exist and connects diverse people. And the tools are improving to help universities do this better. So rather than simply acknowledge that distance learning exists in a universe far removed from the traditional university campus, it might be time to get to know this 'distant cousin' and learn what it has to add to the strength, and diversity, of UK HE.</p> <p><em>Kit Jones is media officer at the </em><a href=\"http://gse.cat.org.uk/\" title=\"\"><em>Centre for Alternative Technology</em></a></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by </strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/guardian-professional\" title=\"\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

  "<p>A single European rail network with genuinely open competition and common standards is urgently needed to let trains relieve congested roads, according to EU transport commissioner Siim Kallas. He has vowed to push ahead with reforms requiring national rail networks to open up, which could lead to direct trains from Britain to destinations across the continent.</p> <p>At the opening of Innotrans, one of Europe's largest transport conventions, in Berlin, Kallas said \u20ac20bn (\u00a316bn) of a \u20ac50bn European infrastructure fund could be made available for national transport projects to make the networks interoperable, helping stimulate growth. He proposed a single central rail agency to certify all new rolling stock built to a single standard across the continent.</p> <p>\"There must be a genuine single market,\" he said. \"Eighty per cent of people and goods are taken by Europe's roads, and they are saturated. People expect railways to provide some alternatives.\"</p> <p>The German transport minister, Peter Ramsauer, said such reform was needed but would be \"incredibly difficult\" to implement and would cost \u20ac4.5bn for the German track alone. He urged Kallas to think further, suggesting that achieving common standards should be intercontinental, with China drawing up plans for a high-speed connection from Europe across Russia to Xinjiang.</p> <p>Kallas said he believed opening up national markets along the lines of Britain's franchising model was beneficial to passengers and had provided better value for money. He said few other EU states had truly opened up their markets to competition, despite previous directives, with conditions skewed in favour of domestic operators, particularly where train companies still operated the track. In Germany and France the state firms Deutsche Bahn and SNCF still dominate.</p> <p>Ramsauer said he would welcome competition, but accused the French of dragging their feet. \"If we want to travel by ICE (the German fast train) from Frankfurt to London, we need France to open up and so we absolutely have to do the same in Germany,\" he said.</p> <p>However, the minister said he did not believe that Britain's experience had provided a good model for regulation of the network. \"In Britain, they took it to excess and failed. We will not make that mistake. We will keep a government role.\"</p> <p>The Deutsche Bahn chairman, R\u00fcdiger Grube, welcomed the idea of more competition \u2013 \"so we can show how good we are,\" he said.</p> <p>The convention in Berlin is expected to pull in 100,000 trade visitors from around the world, with 115 new trains on display on tracks outside 26 large conference halls filled with global exhibitors ranging from Bombardier and Siemens to small suppliers of parts. Network Rail also has a presence here as its new, deregulated private consulting arm touts for business abroad. <strong>Gwyn Topham Berlin</strong></p>",
  "<p>Five of the six biggest countries in the EU, excluding Britain, have called for a radical overhaul of European foreign and defence policies to create a powerful new pan-European foreign ministry, majority voting on common foreign policies to bypass a British veto, a possible European army, and a single market for EU defence industries.</p> <p>The German-led push, supported by 11 of 27 EU countries, embraces recent calls in Berlin and Brussels for a directly elected European president, sweeping new powers for the European parliament, and further splitting of the EU by creating a new parliamentary sub-chamber for the 17 countries of the eurozone.</p> <p>While the call for a European army was not supported by all 11, the document also calls for a new European police organisation to guard the union's external borders and for a single European visa.</p> <p>Nine months of brainstorming over the future of Europe by the foreign ministers of the 11 countries, launched by Guido Westerwelle, the German foreign minister, has resulted in a 12-page document crammed with policy recommendations. It will prove hugely contentious and, if implemented, will increase the pressure on Britain to quit the EU.</p> <p>\"To make the EU into a real actor on the global scene we believe that we should in the long term introduce more majority decisions in the common foreign and security policy sphere, or at least prevent one single member state from being able to obstruct initiatives,\" the document said.</p> <p>\"Aim for a European defence policy with joint efforts regarding the defence industry (eg the creation of a single market for armament projects); for some members of the group this could eventually involve a European army.\"</p> <p>The backers include Germany, France, Italy, Spain and Poland, five of the six biggest EU countries omitting Britain. The Netherlands, Belgium, Denmark, Austria, Portugal and Luxembourg also signed up.</p> <p>The recommendations include more incendiary steps, including a proposal to re-open and change European treaties by majority voting because getting consensus in a union of 27 or 28 has become too slow, acrimonious and unwieldy.</p> <p>Apart from stiff resistance from Britain, which would veto a European army and refuse to take part in foreign policies with which it disagreed, the proposals are likely to prompt a turf war in the European commission because they would strip several departments of powers and resources, concentrating them in the EU's relatively new diplomatic service headed by Catherine Ashton, a Briton.</p> <p>The document demanded a \"substantial revision\" of the powers of the European External Action Service by next year, streamlining it and giving it authority over development, energy, trade and enlargement currently vested in other parts of the commission. If realised, the changes would produce a European foreign ministry with much more muscle.</p>",

  "<p>Kenyan troops are about to advance on Somalia's rebel-held southern port of Kismayo in a final assault against the Islamist militants of al-Shabaab, according to a military spokesman in Nairobi.</p> <p>Kismayo's capture would mark a major breakthrough for the <a href=\"http://amisom-au.org/\" title=\"\">African Union forces</a> fighting the rebels, but rights groups are concerned a protracted battle could lead to many civilian deaths.</p> <p>A victory would probably reinforce the optimism that greeted <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/10/somalia-chooses-new-president-elections\" title=\"\">last week's election</a> as president of activist and professor Hassan Sheikh Mohamud, the first leader to be chosen in Somalia since the military dictator Mohamed Siad Barre was overthrown in 1991.</p> <p>Al-Shabaab, which has been forced to relinquish control of a number of cities and towns in Somalia this year, is heavily dependent on revenue from charcoal exports through Kismayo's port, and taxes levied on businesses.</p> <p>However, some analysts warn that defeat would not signal the end of the al-Qaida-linked group, which could melt into the countryside and continue attacking the African Union's Amisom troops and their Somali allies. It is also unclear who would then control Kismayo, a lucrative source of income that has been fought over by Somali clans in the past.</p> <p>Military spokesman Colonel Cyrus Oguna said Kenyan troops were stockpiling supplies of fuel and ammunition around the town of Jan Abdala, about 25 miles (40km) from Kismayo, before moving forward.</p> <p>\"The final advance to Kismayo may be in the next one or two days. I cannot tell you with any certainty when [the city] may fall,\" he said, adding it might take a week or two to secure victory.</p> <p>Al-Shabaab said on Tuesday on its Twitter page that \"rumours of Mujahideen withdrawing from Kismayo are blatant lies being peddled by the Kuffar [unbeliever] to further their agenda\".</p> <p>Oguna said al-Shabaab fighters and vehicles from Kismayo were reportedly moving into towns north-west of the city, including Jamaame and Jilib.</p> <p>\"I think they have sensed defeat and the amount of casualties they have incurred \u2026 has been so enormous,\" he said, adding that he believed the rebels were heading to strongholds further north.</p> <p>Kenyan troops crossed the border into Somalia in October last year to pursue the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/oct/17/somali-islamists-threaten-kenya-attack\" title=\"\">al-Shabaab</a> militants blamed by officials for a series of cross-border raids and kidnappings.</p> <p>The troops were integrated into the 17,000-strong African Union Amisom peacekeeping force in June, and are advancing with Somali troops and fighters from the Ras Kamboni militia in the south.</p> <p>Oguna said around 30 al-Shabaab fighters had been killed in the last few days. One Somali soldier also died and one or two Kenyan soldiers were injured, he added.</p> <p>The Kenyan navy has shelled Kismayo in recent weeks, with <a href=\"[http://www.hrw.org/news/2012/08/23/somalia-protect-civilians-kismayo]\" title=\"\">Human Rights Watch</a> saying two teenage boys and a pregnant woman were killed on 11 August.

  "<p>The Palestinian militant turned theatre director Zakaria Zubeidi has resumed a total hunger strike in protest at his continued detention without charge by Palestinian security forces, and his supporters say he could die within days.</p> <p>Zubeidi, who publicly renounced armed struggle in 2006 in favour of cultural resistance, has been held in prison in Jericho since 13 May after being detained in a wave of arrests in his home city of Jenin. He has not been charged with any offence.</p> <p>He received assurances that he would be released, but at a court hearing on Monday his detention was extended by a further 19 days. He declared that he would refuse all food, fluids and medical attention.</p> <p>According to witnesses, a visibly weak and thin Zubeidi told the court: \"This morning the doctor told me I have three days to live if I don't drink water. So this court has decided to kill me.\"</p> <p>Zubeidi's arrest followed an attack by gunmen on the home of Jenin's governor, who shortly afterwards died of a heart attack. A weapon used in the attack was linked by Palestinian investigators to Zubeidi. He denied any involvement and before his arrest he offered to co-operate with the investigation.</p> <p>He told relatives and associates that he had been held in solitary confinement for the first 50 days of detention, had been denied access to a lawyer for more than two weeks and had been abused and tortured by interrogators. His lawyer, Farid Hawwash, was also arrested after criticising the Palestinian security forces.</p> <p>Human Rights Watch criticised Zubeidi's continued detention. \"For more than four months, the Palestinian Authority has violated Zubeidi's basic due process rights to be charged and tried, and continues to ignore his statements that interrogators tortured him,\" said Bill Van Esveld, of HRW.</p> <p>\"The PA's foreign donors should urgently pressure it to end the impunity and arbitrary detentions that Zubeidi's case exemplifies.\" Western governments including Britain and the US provide direct funding to the PA security services.</p> <p>Zubeidi is a director and co-founder of Jenin's innovative but controversial Freedom Theatre. Jonatan Stanczak, managing director of the theatre, said: \"I fear Zakaria will be the first Palestinian prisoner to die as a consequence of hunger strike \u2013 and the terrible thing is that he's in a Palestinian prison.\"</p> <p>Jenny Nyman, the widow of Juliano Mer-Khamis, the theatre's founder who was shot dead 18 months ago, said: \"It's a disaster and a disgrace for the PA. If they let a person who has fought all his life for the freedom of his people die in prison, it's a very dark period, and a big symbol of the state of Palestinian society.\"</p> <p>Hawwash, Zubeidi's lawyer, said he would appeal against the decision in court in Ramallah on Wednesday, but had \"no expectations\" of the outcome.</p> <p>Jenin was a bedrock of the second intifada, or Palestinian uprising, and the home of many suicide bombers sent to target Israeli citizens. Zubeidi was on Israel's most-wanted list as the leader of the al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigade in the city. But Jenin was later held up as a model of good Palestinian governance as the city prospered with economic investment and PA security forces won control from militant groups.</p> <p>A string of attacks in the past 18 months \u2013 including the unsolved murder of Mer-Khamis, the assault on the governor's house and the assassination two weeks ago of the Palestinian security chief Hisham al-Rakh \u2013 has led to claims that Jenin is slipping towards anarchy.</p> <p>The city's new governor, Talal Dwekat, denied there was a crisis. \"There is no problem we're incapable of solving, and no person above the law,\" he said. \"Years ago you would see gangsters and guns in Jenin, but now you walk around and the only guns you see are in the hands of the security forces. There is total control over Jenin.\"</p> <p>Zubeidi's detention is another blow to the Freedom Theatre, which has been repeatedly raided by Israeli security forces since Mer-Khamis was killed. The theatre has antagonised both Israeli and Palestinian authorities by criticising their actions.</p> <p>\"The level of harassment from the Israeli army has been seriously affecting our work to the extent that it has even threatened our continuation,\" Stanczak said. \"Now the PA is also causing problems by detaining Zakaria, but I don't know whether by intention or as a consequence. His detention makes the PA seem like another occupier rather than a servant of the people.\"</p> <p>The theatre has been criticised by conservative elements in the Jenin refugee camp in which it is based over its mixed-gender acting workshops and progressive outlook. \"We challenge power structures, we are provocative,\" Stanczak said. \"If we didn't, what would be the purpose of our work?\"</p> <p>Dwekat said he had not received any complaints about the theatre since he became governor five months ago. \"Even if the theatre makes mistakes, the reaction should not be violent. All our problems should be dealt with through dialogue. The PA is totally supportive of cultural activities.\" He said he planned to make his first visit to the theatre \"very soon\".</p>",
  "<p>Barack Obama may not be a great president, as Gary Younge <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/sep/17/barack-obama-election-gary-younge\" title=\"\">writes</a> elsewhere today. But he certainly is a lucky one. How could his Republican challenger, Mitt Romney, have been so careless, let alone so foolishly inaccurate, as to utter those <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/sep/18/mitt-romney-secret-video\">dismissive sentiments about the Democratic electoral base</a> in a hi-tech age where so many people have an all-singing all-dancing phone on which to record it? Can he recover from it? Probably not.</p> <p>Fatal lapses of taste and personal judgment have always swirled around the mighty. Long before the iPhone was invented, Queen Marie Antoinette was widely quoted as saying of a similar sort of people \"let them eat cake\". She didn't actually say it (she wasn't a lesbian either), but they still chopped off her head. The phrase reinforced a Romney-esque image problem, just as Nicholas Sarkozy's choice of bling restaurant venue to celebrate his election victory in 2007 did him <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2009/may/10/nicolas-sarkozy-approval-ratings-france\" title=\"\">serious reputational harm</a>.</p> <p>The march of intrusive technology through the 20th century was relentless. When the polio-stricken Franklin D Roosevelt was elected president of the US in 1932, no photos were ever printed (and few taken) that revealed the scale of his disability to voters. When Hitler did a jig by the Eiffel Tower the footage wasn't shown on French TV. It was not what conquerers were supposed to do. The infant industry of PR knew that.<br>But today the image-shaping PR men are in a constant battle with YouTube, iPhones and Twitter. When Vince Cable was caught in a Daily Telegraph honeytrap, taped making abusive remarks about coalition Tories, older MPs on all sides were offended on his behalf. But the younger ones I consulted at the time said \"Silly old Vince, nowadays you have to assume you are being recorded at all times.\"</p> <p>A popular figure can still get away with it. Richard Nixon's snarling and profane self-revelation in the Watergate tapes contradicted his public Quaker piety, whereas Ronald Reagan's joke about declaring war on Russia (he didn't realise the mic was live) reinforced his sunny image. John Major complaining about the cabinet's Eurosceptic \"<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/1993/jul/25/politicalnews.uk\" title=\"\">bastards</a>\" \u2013 a private remark picked up by a still-live mic \u2013 reinforced an air of helpless victimhood. If they were bastards why not sack them?

Instead, it was widely seen as proof that Blair was indeed the White House poodle over the invasion of Iraq.

When Jeremy Hunt assured TV viewers that the Olympic team was ready for all eventualities none of his minders could anticipate that the bell the minister was about to ring would have a wonky handle. The bell shot off the handle and nearly brained a voter. Hunt will have to work hard to make sure the YouTube clip is not his political epitaph.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/LgW6wQQ3lY4?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/LgW6wQQ3lY4\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>As always, it depends what happens next. If Romney wins, his slagging off of 47% of the voters was a mere bump in the road to the White House. \"Hey, 53% didn't mind at all.\" But retrospective insight can be ominous. Did no one warn tiny Michael Dukakis, George Bush's Democratic opponent in 1988, that he'd look silly in a helmet inside a tank? Was Neil Kinnock's nine-year campaign for No 10 doomed on that first fateful afternoon when the newly-elected Labour leader and his wife, Glenys, did a photo-op on Brighton beach and were caught by a wave? Come to think of it did no one ask if David Miliband should grip that suggestive banana? Or was the choice of fruit Ed's idea?</p>",
  "<p>It is testament to the appeal of the <a href=\"http://www.ramsbottomfestival.com/\">Ramsbottom Festival </a>that, after the soggiest summer in a century, this boutique Lancashire event attracted thousands of people who couldn't give a fig for the rain.<br> Now in its second year, a <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/the-northerner/2012/aug/14/ramsbottom-festival-music\">celebration of music</a>, poetry, comedy and food took over a little Northern town nestled in the shadow of the West Pennines.

Independent retailers dominate the market town, from butchers and bakers to antique emporiums and artisan coffee shops. According to the exhibition, daily shopping for fresh food, writing a weekly order to be delivered to their homes and collecting the 'dividend' twice a year used to be important parts of peoples' lives:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>From the 1820s, shops spread from the Market Place selling everything that townspeople needed including many goods which were made in the town.

  "<p>Somewhere in the centre of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/vietnam\" title=\"\">Vietnam</a>, roughly halfway between Hanoi and Saigon, lies the small province of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qu%E1%BA%A3ng_Tr%E1%BB%8B_province\" title=\"\">Quang Tri</a>. Palm trees line its white-sand beaches, water buffaloes lounge in its many ponds and farmers bring harvests home in ox-drawn carts.</p> <p>It was here, at around 10am on one sweltering hot morning in 1988, as Nguyen Dinh Thu was hoeing the small piece of land his parents had given him, that he struck the unexploded US military bomb that had lain undisturbed there for 15 years. Nguyen had no knowledge of this, or the 11 other bombs that were later dug up from the ground on which he'd been standing.</p> <p>Quang Tri is a poor province now and was poorer in 1988. In the absence of an ambulance or any available taxi, Nguyen's friends and relatives had no choice but to carry him the 25km to the nearest medical facility in a hammock. It was here, some time later, that Nguyen, a farmer in a developing country, came round to find both his hands had been blown off \u2013his right at the wrist and his left halfway down his forearm \u2013 and his face and legs were riddled with shrapnel which will stay inside him permanently.</p> <p>The Vietnamese government estimates that around 14m tonnes of ordnance, nearly three times that used by the Allies in the second world war, was dropped on Vietnam <a href=\"http://history1900s.about.com/od/vietnamwar/a/vietnamwar.htm\" title=\"\">between 1959 and 1975</a>. Between 10% and 30% of it failed to detonate. According to the most recent official figures, explosions caused by buried bombs and mines claimed around 105,000 civilian victims between 1975 and 2007. In total, the Vietnamese government estimates that around 15% of the total surface area of the country is contaminated by unexploded ordnance (UXO). For Quang Tri, nestled as it is on the wartime division between what was North and South Vietnam, that contamination is closer to 84%. What that means for the families in its many farming communities is that a war they did nothing to start and knew little about has never really ended.</p> <p>For Le Van Tra, the technical operations co-ordinator for the <a href=\"http://www.maginternational.org/\" title=\"\">Mines Advisory Group</a> (MAG) in Quang Tri, this legacy of war is an everyday fact of life. Le Van has been working for the group for 13 years. He and his colleagues investigate the unexploded bombs located by the group's community liaison teams and work out how to make them safe. If Le Van's knowledge of the ordnance found on the ground in Quang Tri can sometimes appear to border on the psychic, it's because it's had to be. Before working for the mines group, he was one of many people \u2013 untrained and uneducated in the workings of unexploded bombs \u2013 who trawled the forests and beaches of Quang Tri hunting for the metal casings that could be traded for scrap. It's an activity both illegal and lethal, but for many in the poor and isolated regions of Quang Tri, the 25,000 Vietnamese dong ($1) a shell casing can fetch is tempting.</p> <p>Given the nature of the work, accurate casualty figures are impossible to come by, but they're high. \"My wife and family were scared,\" Le Van explained. \"They knew that a lot of scrap metal collectors were being killed, but there was a lot of UXO to be found then and scrap metal collecting, for many, was just another part of farming.\" But for every piece of ordnance found came the risk of another explosion, and it was with relief as well as pride that Le Van's wife and family greeted his decision to join the mines group.</p> <p>It's early in the morning at one of MAG's field offices in An My village. Already, most of the adults are at work in the fields, bringing in this year's harvest. Like everywhere in Quang Tri, the scene is an idyllic one: there's no sound but that of the birds and the rhythmic beating of breakers on the nearby shore. Conical-hatted farmers work away in rice paddies as has been done for centuries, and 12-year-old Duong Ba Tien wants to show the MAG team one of the bombs he's found. Duong doesn't know how long it's been there or even how it got there; it's where he grazes his family's water buffalo.</p> <p>His father has told him not to go near it. A 13-year-old boy was killed in An My by an unexploded bomb four years ago as he played in his garden, and the shock waves still reverberate through this tiny community. Duong's bomb is a big one, Le Van explains; it has the capacity to level everything within a 150-metre radius, with shrapnel extending its killing range by a further 350 metres.</p> <p>Le Van, with the confidence of a surgeon outlining a particularly tricky procedure, kneels down beside it to explain how the rust has made the detonator in this particular piece of ordnance unstable.</p> <p>Removing the unexploded bombs, as well as the other items the MAG expects to find in An My, will leave this land safe for Duong, his family and the families of many others throughout the village, as well as removing a shadow that's been hanging over An My for the last 37 years.</p> <p>This is a benefit that Nguyen is well aware of. It's now 24 years since the bomb blast that took his hands and the mines group has cleared his small, 500 sq m piece of land. <a href=\"http://www.rootsofpeace.org/\" title=\"\">Roots of Peace</a>, another NGO, will shortly plant pepper trees, providing Nguyen, his wife and two young children, with a livelihood that a forgotten bomb took away from them all those years ago.</p> <p>Nguyen's voice cracks as he describes the difference the NGOs' work will make to their lives. At last, he has land. At last, he can support his family. He has no grievance, he explains, against the Americans who caused a war and left the consequences to the Vietnamese people. He's just grateful to have his land.</p> <p>Nobody is sure how many unexploded mines and bombs lie beneath Vietnam's picturesque landscape. The government predicts the cleanup work may go on for a further 100 years. In the meantime, farmers and their families will continue to pay the heaviest of costs, in terms of both lives and land, for a war that few of them will ever understand.</p>",
  "<p>\"The novelty has worn off\" is an odd phrase, with unnecessarily limited, negative connotations. Sometimes the novelty fades and the excitement remains. Afghanistan are by far the most interesting team at the World Twenty20 which started in Sri Lanka on Tuesday; it's just that they are no longer new. They are now part of international cricket's furniture. It is not a shock they qualified. It would have been a surprise had they not done so.</p> <p>Afghanistan \u2013 who play India in Group A on Wednesday before facing England on Friday \u2013 are a team of irrepressible optimists; <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2010/apr/27/the-spin-afghanistan-cricket\" title=\"\">full of character, charm and innocence</a>; free of the cynicism and entitlement that pollute modern sport. They are subject to the unique goodwill, affection and gratitude that only occurs when you are exploring virgin territory on behalf of your country. Theirs is a tale the whole cricket world has embraced. The more you delve into their story, the more you fall in love with it. If you have not yet seen the life-affirming documentary <a href=\"http://www.outoftheashes.tv/\" title=\"\">Out of the Ashes</a>, your LoveFilm list is in urgent need of&#xa0;revision.</p> <p>\"There is a lot of problems in the world today, you know?\" the then national coach Taj Malik says in the documentary. \"And everywhere, everywhere, there is complex fighting. The solution of all the problems&#xa0;... is cricket.\" <a href=\"http://www.espncricinfo.com/afghanistan/content/player/318334.html\" title=\"\">Nawroz Mangal</a>, the captain, estimates the cricket-playing population of Afghanistan at more than 500,000. \"After participating in this World Cup, if we do better, I expect 30 to 40% of the population to start playing cricket.\" The swashbuckling wicketkeeper-batsman <a href=\"http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/content/player/419873.html\" title=\"\">Mohammad Shahzad</a> says their participation \"could be a positive step towards bringing peace to the country\".</p> <p>The word \"journey\" has become a little hackneyed in the reality TV age, but Afghanistan's journey is worth revisiting. It began in refugee camps during the Soviet occupation of 1979-89, where cricket was played using shoes for stumps and balls made out of torn-up shirts. The national team became affiliated to the ICC in 2001, when they went on their first tour, a trip across the Pakistan border from Kabul to Rawalpindi. As recently as 2008 they were playing in Division Five of the ICC World Cricket League against Japan, Jersey, Singapore, Botswana and the Bahamas. That was the start of a series of qualifiers for the last 50-over World Cup which took them to Jersey, Tanzania, Argentina and finally South Africa. Their dream of World Cup qualification ended with defeat to Canada in 2009 but they received ODI status at the end of the same&#xa0;tournament.</p> <p>Afghanistan then qualified for the World T20 in 2010, where they were beaten by India and South Africa. Last month they played their first ODI against Australia and <a href=\"http://www.espncricinfo.com/afghanistan/engine/match/571947.html\" title=\"\">were far from embarrassed during a 66-run defeat</a>. Mohammad Nabi clubbed four sixes while the boyish No9, Gulbodin Naib \u2013 whose endearing fixation with his Popeye muscles was a recurring theme of Out of the Ashes \u2013 showed the value of that gym work by hammering three sixes in nine balls off Mitchell Johnson and James Pattinson.</p> <p>That match is one of only two ODIs against a Test-playing nation \u2013 they also lost to Pakistan by seven wickets in February \u2013 but they have an overall record of 12 wins and 11 defeats in that form of the game. In T20 internationals their record is won six and lost five, again with defeats in both their matches against a major nation. They have not played enough games to qualify for a place in the ICC T20 rankings, although their points total would put them 10th, above Ireland and Zimbabwe \u2013 and, for a few days a fortnight ago, Australia.</p> <p>Afghanistan are probably not yet ready to beat one of the big nations. That day will come, however, and a victory against England \u2013 who have lost to Associate nations in two of the past three global tournaments \u2013 should not be completely discounted. \"We have a very competitive team,\" says the ACB chief executive Hamid Shinwari, \"and I hope that they will put up a better show in this year's event.\"</p> <p>They were comfortably beaten in both matches in the Caribbean two years ago, although they left their mark. The lower order swung merrily to recover from 14 for six and 32 for eight to reach 80 against South Africa, while Hamid Hassan took three for 21 in that match and one for eight from three overs against India.</p> <p>Hassan is the best fast bowler among the Associate and Affiliate nations. Afghanistan are not yet Associate members of the ICC, and share Affiliate status with, among others, Cameroon, Luxembourg and the Isle of Man. His former coach, the Pakistan wicketkeeper Rashid Latif, says he is \"good enough to represent even a full nation in a developed team\". His strength, yorkers and ability to swing the ball both ways, prompted Clive Lloyd to say that he reminded him a little of Waqar Younis. As a child he played in secret, because his father hated cricket. Now he loves expressing his talent in public. Hassan's aggression and love of wearing bandanas \u2013 with a lick of sunblock on his cheek \u2013 have led to him being described as the \"Rambo of Afghanistan cricket\".</p> <p>He has been included in the squad despite fitness concerns. Hassan was badly injured playing for an Associate and Affiliate XI against England in Dubai in January, when he dismissed Andrew Strauss and Jonathan Trott during a lively spell, and has bowled only a handful of overs in the past eight months. In his absence, Dawlat Zadran has been Afghanistan's premier new-ball bowler: he was the only non-Irishman included on the five-man shortlist for Associate and Affiliate Player of the Year at last week's ICC Awards.</p> <p>Fast bowling is probably Afghanistan's strongest suit, but batting is their most eye-catching. They are not especially savvy and do not really do nurdling, instead preferring to embrace <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-N8IoqILtRw\" title=\"\">an unashamed six-addiction</a>. Nabi clouted five in a 22-ball half-century during a warmup against Sri Lanka A on&#xa0;Saturday. Overall Afghanistan hit 13 sixes in their 20 overs.</p> <p>It has almost become a cliche to refer to Afghanistan's cricketers as fearless, yet that is the way they play the game. Nobody exemplifies that more than the hard-hitting opener, Karim Sadiq, who goes after bowlers from the moment the umpire calls \"play\".

  "<p>Since the Not The Booker prize is all about openness, I think you should know right away that I like Ben Myers. Is this a conflict of interest? Arguably. But if it is a conflict, it's one that is played out across the books pages every day. The only difference here is that I'm being honest about it.</p> <p>As I'm sure you already realise, friends review friends all the time. And if they didn't, literary journalism would have a few problems. Reviewers often become chummy with the people they write about. It's human nature. I became a reviewer because I like books; it follows that I'll probably also like a few of the writers of those books. Should I then refuse to read their books because of that affection? Well, we can have it out in the comments, but first, a bit more explanation:</p> <p>I first came into contact with Ben years ago, because I liked his sweary prose, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2007/feb/07/fiction.publishing\" title=\"\">as this article (containing the wonderful question \"Has anyone ever seen an e-book?\") witnesses</a>. I read Ben before I knew him. But since then, we've regularly corresponded, met once, and frequently laughed at <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX3tM-W_2TQ&amp;feature=related\" title=\"\">slowed down versions of Metallica songs</a> on Facebook. Does this alter the way I'm going to review <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/fiction/9780956687678/pig-iron\" title=\"\">Pig Iron</a>? Possibly. The thing that gives me pause is wondering whether I'd have been able to write a review for Pig Iron like <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/aug/29/not-the-booker-prize-aj-kirby\" title=\"\">the one I wrote for Paint This Town Red</a>. I think it would have been difficult. Perhaps I'd have managed it. Perhaps \u2026</p> <p>Happily, I didn't have to explore that dilemma this time around. I liked the book. And I don't think knowing Ben has influenced my opinion. Not too much, anyway. Maybe I warmed to it more quickly than I might have otherwise. Possibly, also, I felt extra pangs of sympathy because John-John Wisdom, the unfortunate main narrator, is a weird short northerner who's fond of Jack Russell terriers and therefore reminded me of Ben himself. But it was the writing that mattered. The writing.</p> <p>One more quick personal note before I finally stop talking about myself. I spent part of my early childhood in County Durham, not so far from John-John's home in Pig Iron, and Myers' prose, rich in \"mebbes\" and \"marrers\", \"nees\" and \"nowts\", \"haways\" and \"shite\", tickled my memory. Importantly, it seemed real. John-John and his co-narrator (whom I can't name, since to do so would give away one of the book's successful surprises) speak in a stylised and sometimes strange way: \"And that was when I got the weakness on me and I did faint.\" But it never seems forced or inauthentic.</p> <p>Better still, I barely registered the unusual voice, after a while. It became part of the texture of John-John's world. Every now and again I was conscious of an appealing bit of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitmatic\" title=\"\">yakka</a>: \"I've shat bigger jobbies than that lad.\" Also, a few lovely rhythms: \"He began to treat me differently. I was a mother now. A mother who had endured one miscarriage and two births. I was a body that fetched the water and gathered the wood and kept the fires going and cleaned the clothes and the van and scolded the kids and kissed them better and worried about her husband when he disappeared for nights and days.\" Most of the time, though, I was too immersed in the story to notice what was happening on the surface.</p> <p>It's hard not to make this story sound like a cross between <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0208092/\" title=\"\">Snatch</a> and <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0137523/\" title=\"\">Fight Club</a>. John-John is the son of the bare-knuckle King of the Gypsies, Mac Wisdom, whose life we hear about in retrospect from the second narrator, and whose influence weighs heavy on the protagonist as he attempts to rebuild his life after a long stretch in jail. But there's no Brad Pitt here. No Hollywood. John-John's world is ugly. The fighting isn't about pleasure. Or even escape. It's just savage men knocking bells out of each other: blood, guts and pain described in visceral detail:</p> <blockquote> Mackem's neck tasted warm and bitter and metallic\u2026 I loosened for a second then went at him again, nearly dislocating me bloody jaw. There was a crunching sound and me teeth nearly met in the middle and I must have hit some veins or summat because the blood started pouring out of his neck. Human flesh doesn't tear easily. It's noisy stuff. </blockquote> <p>Things aren't much prettier for John-John when he isn't scrapping. He's forced to live in a pokey, ugly flat on a dangerous estate, where he knows next to no one, and is hounded by a gang of <a href=\"http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/charva\" title=\"\">\"charvers\"</a> whose charm is well-demonstrated in their leader's announcement that \"I'll put you in the fucking ovens where you and your lot belong.\"</p> <p>Even so, there are moments of relief. John-John is consistently amusing, a master of the sardonic aside (\"'I bet you like hearing the old tales, lad'. Like a punch in the cock, I'm muttering.\") He's also big-hearted and warm. Some of the book's best passages come in the descriptions of the quiet fun John-John has tootling around the countryside (\"the green cathedral\") in an ice-cream van, falling in love with a very unsuitable local girl and fussing over his pet dog Coughdrop. John-John is a winning presence. And of course, that makes his catalogue of misfortunes and persecution all the more upsetting; his attempts to right those many wrongs all the more gripping.</p> <p>Caught up as I was, I did wonder sometimes if Myers pushed things too far. Towards the end, especially, things went a bit nuts. Imagine <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/142857/hunger-games\" title=\"\">Hunger Games</a> with an uglier cast, genuine violence and less chance of redemption \u2013 but also fewer loud bangs to distract you from the essential daftness. Now and again, I had doubts, but was always carried through by John-John's force of personality and righteous anger at his and Coughdrop's oppressors. What's more, just when I thought things were about to go right over the top, Myers swerved away gracefully. The ending came in a sudden flash of gold and beauty. To say more would be to give it away; suffice to say, you'll like it when you get there and it's a journey worth making. This is another quality entrant on our shortlist.</p> <p><strong>Next time:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/fiction/9780571277599/the-revelations\" title=\"\">The Revelations</a> by Alex Preston.</p>",
  "<p>I've been reading an out-of-print memoir called <a href=\"http://catalogue.nla.gov.au/Record/2239850\">Mother Signed the Contract</a> by the Australian-born actor Julia James about her first steps in the profession. James was at <a href=\" http://www.rada.ac.uk/\">Rada</a> in the mid-50s, long before the influx of a new generation of working-class actors, and at a time when, for women at least, the place was regarded by some as a finishing school. James is scathing about fellow students who saw their time at drama school as a launch pad for marriage or who won't go out of their way for a job because they had independent means.</p> <p>Times have moved on and competition for drama school places is fierce, but the announcement that the actor Clare Higgins is developing plans with a group of other actors to launch a <a href=\"http://www.thestage.co.uk/news/newsstory.php/37331/exclusive-top-actors-plan-drama-school-for\">free drama school</a> for the increasing numbers of students who cannot afford \u00a39,000 a year for training, is a reminder of how we are in danger of slipping back to a time when theatre was mostly the preserve of the rich. </p> <p>It is one thing to borrow a large amount of money for an education that might increase your earning power, quite another to spend the same amount of money on vocational training for a profession in which many are out of work. The argument that you do not have repay the money until your earnings reach a substantial level cuts no ice with those who come from poorer backgrounds where debt is something to be feared, not just something you pop on your credit card.</p> <p>Sheridan Smith has recently talked about the difficulties she has faced in <a href=\"http://www.express.co.uk/posts/view/344027/Sheridan-Smith-I-broke-down-and-they-kept-the-cameras-rolling-\">being working class </a>in a middle-class profession, and Julie Walters has expressed her concern that the <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/culturenews/9515821/Julie-Walters-warns-of-future-where-only-posh-can-afford-to-act.html\">disappearance of grants</a> means that: \"Working-class kids aren't coming through. When I started, 30 years ago, it was the complete opposite.\" </p> <p>When theatre practitioners gather together chances are they will be predominantly white and middle class, and the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/stage/theatreblog/2012/feb/10/posh-theatre-upper-class-actors\">public-school-educated actor is very much in the ascendant</a> with the success of Benedict Cumberbatch, Eddie Redmayne, Tom Hiddleston and others. People can't help what family they were born into, but the importance of getting the greatest range of people into the profession is obvious, since the pool of actors available undoubtedly influences the kind of work that is made. The Royal Court writing of the 60s would not have thrived without the influx of exciting actors from less privileged backgrounds coming out of drama schools. Actors also often go on to become writers, directors and sometimes artistic directors. </p> <p>Arts Council England's announcement of a \u00a315m scheme to create fairer entry routes into the arts workforce by <a href=\"http://www.artscouncil.org.uk/news/arts-council-news/creative-employment-programme-launch/\">encouraging arts organisations to pay their interns</a> is one small step in the right direction, and Higgins's initiative is another. <a href=\"http://www.thestage.co.uk/news/newsstory.php/37331/exclusive-top-actors-plan-drama-school-for\">She told the Stage</a>: \"There is a dearth of training for people who don't have independent wealth or rich parents. We are aiming to stop that in its tracks.\" We have to, unless we want the equivalent of wall-to-wall Downton Abbey on our stages.</p>",
  "<p>A nice chap and a decent one, Ed Miliband. I hope the Labour leader savours the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/2012/sep/18/hague-afghanistan-politics-live-blog\" title=\"\">15% lead over the divided and demoralised Tories</a> \u2013 it's 12%, according to YouGov in the Sun - which today's Times/Populus poll reports that his party now commands. All I would otherwise advise him to do is not believe a word of it. More than is usually the case, no one can be confident of winning the next election. As in 2010 they may all lose.</p> <p>These are tough times for major party leaders, reflecting voter dismay that goes beyond the travails of protracted recession to general disappointment with politics and politicians. That can be seen in the 15% share of voter preferences going to that underrated party, \"others\" - which can include everyone from the BNP and Greens to Ukip, SNP and the Probably Will Not Vote party.</p> <p>Why should Miliband Junior not feel confident that he's making progress towards obtaining the keys of No 10? The coalition's policies are widely felt to be both unfair and not working \u2013 especially in the central sphere of economic retrenchment as the key to recovery. Several polls have been reporting that more voters share the Labour line \u2013 pay off the debt more slowly \u2013 than the coalition's austerity priority. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/video/2012/sep/04/george-osborne-booed-paralympics-video?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">George Osborne is booed at the Olympic Stadium</a>.</p> <p>There is also talk of revolts within the Tory ranks, of ever-deeper splits between the coalition partners, plots against David Cameron, \"Boris for King\" chatter. As John Major - and he should know \u2013 warned on the Sunday TV sofa, the Tories should have learned from his tottering status after 1992 that regicide is usually a bad policy. Even kamikazes like the Mail's <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2204755/David-Cameron-Ive-fiercest-critic-I-agree-itd-madness-Tories-dump-him.html\" title=\"\">Simon (\" I am no admirer, but\") Heffer now grasp that</a>.</p> <p>The party has never quite recovered from killing off Lady Thatcher in 1990. Legitimacy, once lost, is hard to recover, that's one lesson we were supposed to have learned from the Wars of the Roses. That Bolingbroke, eh? William Hague once quipped that the Tories work on the principle of \"autocracy tempered by regicide\" - yet Hague and all leaders since have suffered the recurring plots.</p> <p>But, but, but. Young Ed probably knows as well as you and I do that his poll lead is partly down to mid-term blues, a routine cyclical event. Remember that Labour's 24% over the Thatcher-led Tories in 1990 failed to deliver victory in 1992, though in fairness both Thatcher and her poll tax had been thrown overboard in the meantime.</p> <p>Opposition parties that go on to win the next election are usually further ahead than Labour's usual 8% to 10% since 2010 \u2013 15% is, I think, the highest recorded since the election. But Tony Blair was up to 40% ahead before his 1997 landslide. Today's polling puts Cameron well ahead of Miliband as the leader voters prefer for No 10 - by 60% to 31% with more than half that 60% saying they are not pleased with Dave, but see him as the lesser evil.</p> <p>It's true that the Tories usually run their affairs on the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F%C3%BChrerprinzip\" title=\"\">F\u00fchrerprinzip \u2013 the \"leader principle\"</a>, which grants sweeping powers on condition of success, whereas Labour's history and temper is more collectivist and cautious (it NEVER sacks its elected leader). But TV politics has focused attention on the leader and everywhere he/she is now more crucial than ever.</p> <p>So a perception that still favours Cameron \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/video/2012/sep/12/hillsborough-disaster-david-cameron-video\" title=\"\">he did well on the Hillsborough statement</a>, didn't he? - matters a lot. There has also been reporting this week that all sections of society will see a modest rise in incomes next year. If true that may help keep the coalition partners afloat, as will the gentle collapse in the weeks ahead of the Boris Bubble and the Lib Dems' own Vince Vapours.</p> <p>Clegg is going to soldier on too, battered and bloodied, but still standing. He fought Michael Gove to a respectable draw over GCSE reform this month \u2013 how respectable only time will tell, but he's learning.</p> <p>And when Newsnight's Allegra Stratton \u2013 my old Guardian colleague \u2013 reports (as she did last night) that ministers are considering linking next year's increases in benefits (not pensions) to wage increases, not inflation, to save money, I doubt if it will make them more unpopular among most voters, however unfair it sounds. If they actually do it, of course. We have been here before.</p> <p>It is the f\u00fchrerprinzip that is slowly undoing Mitt Romney's campaign for the White House. As you will have heard overnight he was caught out <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/18/romney-secret-video-government-dependent\" title=\"\">dismissing Democrat voters \u2013 all of them \u2013 as victims dependent on entitlements from the state</a>, a shockingly stupid as well as immoral thing to say, especially at a time when the label can more plausibly be hung round Wall Street's neck.</p> <p>I was listening to a clever banker only the other day who said that bankers are like alcoholics: there will be no cure until they admit there's a problem. At least Cameron and Osborne know this which may be why \u2013 as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/sep/17/conservatives-expect-barack-obama-reelection\" title=\"\">Patrick Wintour reports today</a> \u2013 they are already preparing for a second Obama term. Whether or not the president deserves it is discussed by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/17/barack-obama-election-gary-younge\" title=\"\">Gary Young here in G2</a>.</p> <p>Can Miliband win in 2015? Perhaps, though plenty of old Labour hands, not all of them admirers of brother David, privately doubt it. In today's Telegraph, doughty columnist, <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/labour/9548336/The-Tories-keep-swiping-but-Ed-Miliband-is-an-elusive-target.html\" title=\"\">Mary Riddell, argues that Red Ed is an elusive target for the Tories</a> and that Gove's reforms are essentially Blairite. On <a href=\"http://conservativehome.blogs.com/majority_conservatism/2012/09/if-george-osborne-could-have-designed-an-ideal-labour-opposition-he-would-have-chosen-the-ed-miliban.html\" title=\"\">ConservativeHome Tim Montgomerie argues that both Eds \u2013 especially Ed Balls \u2013 are sitting targets</a> for Tory election planners, who are simply keeping their powder dry.</p> <p>In that context opinion polls which suggest the coalition is hopelessly unpopular and that Labour only has to sit back and reap its reward do Miliband and Balls no favours. The \"Age of Ed\" \u2013 as over-excited Cameron-bashers are already calling it \u2013 is not upon us. Labour remains vulnerable on tax-and-spend, more Kinnockite than Blairite, on welfare reform and immigration to name three high voter priorities.</p> <p>I suspect Miliband knows all this, but he did volunteer for the job. Oddly enough the complacent view that \"this time it's different\" may be right but with uncertain consequences. The YouGov pollster, Peter Kellner, is reminding audiences that 59% of voters now fear for their children's future against 23% who think it will be OK.</p> <p>Given that the economy has usually been growing at 2% to 2.5% for decades \u2013 it isn't doing that now \u2013 this underlying trend points to a doubling of national wealth ever generation or so. If voters fear that won't happen in the future, that's a scary disconnect for any political leader \u2013 here or elsewhere \u2013 a headwind that may lead to another hung parliament and some sort of coalition after 2015.</p> <p>But even in uncertainty optimism is the best note to adopt. Cameron shows he knows that. Does Ed?</p>",
  "<p>Hawa Aden Mohamed watched the young women in blue and red shawls as their hands fluttered busily over clacking sewing machines in an airy workshop in Somalia's Galkayo town. \"Seeing these girls earning a living, it is a good feeling,\" said the diminutive Somali, whose work to help displaced women improve their living standards was recognised on Tuesday when she was named winner of this year's <a href=\"http://www.unhcr.org/nansen/49c3646c461.html\" title=\"\">Nansen Refugee Award</a>.</p> <p>The prize, which is named after the late Norwegian polar explorer and Nobel peace laureate Fridtjof Nansen, is awarded annually by the United Nations refugee agency, <a href=\"http://www.unhcr.org/cgi-bin/texis/vtx/home\" title=\"\">UNHCR</a>.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.unicef.org/somalia/reallives_7709.html\" title=\"\">Aden Mohamed</a>, or Mama Hawa, was nominated for her work to empower Somali girls and women, especially those displaced by decades of cyclical war and hunger in the Horn of Africa.</p> <p>For the co-founder of the <a href=\"http://www.gecpdsom.org/\" title=\"\">Galkayo Education Centre for Peace and Development (GECPD)</a>, education means everything. \"I think not having education is a kind of disease \u2026 without education, you do not exist much. Physically yes, but mentally and emotionally you do not exist,\" she said during an interview last month in Galkayo.</p> <p>Around 1,250 girls receive formal education from GECPD, and 1,600 over the age of 16 are taught basic literacy, numeracy and other life skills, such as sewing. Most have been displaced by the conflict and droughts that have affected Somalia for more than two decades. According to Unicef, since GECPD began its work <a href=\"http://www.unicef.org/somalia/reallives_7709.html\" title=\"\">the percentage of girls receiving education in the surrounding district has reached 40%</a>, the highest enrolment in Somalia.</p> <p>Mama Hawa's commitment to women's rights in a traditionally patriarchal society has shaped her whole life. And, in many ways, she owes this to a man: her father. When she was 10, he sent her to school \u2013 a controversial decision \u2013 in the central Somali town of Baidoa in the 1950s. \"My father was special when it comes to girls,\" she said. \"I remember the elders, his friends, asking: 'Why do you want to send your girls to school?' And my father used to say: 'Leave my girls alone'. \"</p> <p>This decision began a lifelong love affair with learning that saw Mama Hawa become an educator, a government official, an activist and a refugee. She has now expanded her work in Galkayo to include boys and young men. As well as the sewing workshop, where women and girls make underwear and sanitary pads for \"dignity kits\" for displaced women, the GECPD runs metalwork and woodwork centres for boys in the dusty town of low houses with colourful doors and thorn trees festooned with plastic bags. Mama Hawa said pirate gangs and other militias often recruited street boys, and she wanted to offer them an alternative.</p> <p>The GECPD, which is supported by UNHCR and the NGOs <a href=\"http://www.oxfamnovib.nl/en-home.html\" title=\"\">Oxfam Novib</a> and <a href=\"http://www.diakonia.se/main_eng.htm\" title=\"\">Diakonia</a>, among others, has also opened a youth resource and sports centre, which has become a social and cultural focal point for the town.</p> <p>Mama Hawa at first faced criticism for teaching women to speak for themselves. \"The mosques spoke of us, said we were devils \u2026 Afterwards, it calmed down when they saw how many, almost 250 women, were taking classes in adult education. We had built around 12 schools.\"</p> <p>The GECPD also campaigns against <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/video/2011/apr/18/female-genital-mutilation-video\" title=\"\">female genital mutilation</a> (FGM). Mama Hawa's sister, Fatouma, died aged around seven from an infection contracted after she was circumcised, and the memory still haunts her. \"The word 'Why' \u2026 was not there. [It's] only when you think of the pain \u2026 the deaths, the girls who are circumcised twice because the first time it is not sewn properly ...\" Mama Hawa's voice trailed off. \"You see?\"</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.unicef.org/somalia/SOM_FGM_Advocacy_Paper.pdf\" title=\"\">An estimated 95% of Somali girls undergo FGM</a>, usually between the ages of four and 11, and most suffer the most extreme form of cutting or infibulation. A new constitution, passed in August, outlaws the practice, but campaigners say it will be difficult to enforce.</p> <p>Mama Hawa, who was born in 1949, studied in India before returning to Mogadishu and working in the Ministry of Education for 15 years. She fled abroad when the military dictator Mohamed Siad Barre was ousted in 1991. She ended up in Canada, and recognises that her refugee life \u2013 she found a job and a good apartment \u2013 bore no relation to the horrors experienced by women forced to flee their homes on foot in recent years. \"We always say there is hope, we should not lose our hope, our torch of life \u2026 In reality, it's very difficult, especially for women and children,\" she said.</p> <p>In 1994, she returned to Somalia and the southern port of Kismayo, where she opened a women's education centre. But she was forced to flee abroad again in 1999 as clan militias fought each other.</p> <p>Mama Hawa will have no problem spending the $100,000 prize money. She would like more running tracks at the youth centre, a guesthouse to host visiting teams, and a professional college for women.</p> <p>For 16-year-old Mouna Hassan Mohamed, Mama Hawa has already delivered. The teenager fled to Galkayo from the capital Mogadishu three years ago, and still lives in a camp for displaced people. But the money she makes from sewing has given her some independence and respect. \"The money I earn I use for the family,\" she said as her nimble fingers fed material into the sewing machine. \"I pay school fees for my three younger siblings and I am also able to help vulnerable people.\"</p>",

  "<p>I recently invented a cocoa citrus tea. It was the surprisingly pleasant result of an airborne Jaffa cake, launched by my daughter, landing in my teacup. Terrible table manners, I know, but the result was a zingy chocolatey orange flavoured brew. I have yet to patent it or even entice anyone else to try it, yet I cling to the belief that I may be on to something.</p> <p>After all, some of the greatest dishes came about by accident. The latest serendipitous food to reach us is blond chocolate, as distinct from white, milk or dark. Produced by French chocolate maker <a href=\"http://www.valrhona.com/\">Valrhona</a>, the creation of this accidental chocolate has the flavour of a Joanne Harris novel.<br><br>\"Early one spring morning 8 years ago,\" it goes, \"at Valrhona's Ecole du Grand Chocolat, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Bau put some white chocolate in a bain marie, for a pastry demonstration. But he forgot about it until 10 hours later when the chocolate had turned a honey/butterscotchy shade of blond, smelled of toasted shortbread and had a unique creamy, sugary, slightly salty taste.\"</p> <p>Eight years on chocolate \"engineers\" have finally found a way to reproduce the chocolate on a bigger scale and it's now available to buy in bar and bean shapes from Fortnum and Mason, Harvey Nichols <a href=\"http://www.classicfinefoods.co.uk/\">as well as</a> some <a href=\"http://www.chocolatetradingco.com\">places online</a>.</p> <p>If its appeal is universal and the new product stands the test of time it will enter the annals alongside other accidental foodstuffs, which range from staples such as cheese to more exotic and unusual concoctions like Lea and Perrins Worcestershire sauce.</p> <p>Mankind first tasted the former when an Arab nomad decided to transport milk in a container made from an animal's stomach, complete with the curdling enzyme rennet. When lunchtime arrived he was surprised to find the liquid was now a solid, but ate it anyway and liked what he ate.</p> <p>Worcestershire sauce arose after a failed attempt by John Lea and William Perrins to recreate a much-loved Indian sauce for Lord Marcus Sandy, a former governor of Bengal, who on returning to England went to them with a description of the flavour he was pining for. What they came up with was too powerful, but rather than throwing the sauce away they stashed it in their basement for two years. It aged and changed, improving radically in the process and proving a hit with their customers.</p> <p>A <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potato_chip\">fit of pique</a> led chef George Crum to the invention of potato crisps. A customer at his Saratoga Springs restaurant complained this French fries were too thick. Crum sliced potatoes as thin as he could and deep-fried them until they were hard, then sent them out to the complainer, who loved them.</p> <p>It was being overworked that led St\u00e9phanie Tatin to leave apples, intended for a pie, cooking for so long that they caramelized, leading to the signature dish of the <a href=\"http://www.hotel-tatin\">eponymous hotel</a> she ran with her sister. The list of accidental foodstuffs goes on. It includes choc-chip cookies, tofu, beer, cornflakes, iceberg lettuce, and ice cream cones. Once you start asking questions an awful lot of what we put on our tables was created by accident rather than design.</p> <p>Many a chef will tell you the greater part of cooking is trial and error or absent-mindedness. All <a href=\"http://thewordchef.com/2012/03/your-signature-dish-how-to-create-a-program-that-sizzles/\">signature dishes</a> require a bit of experimentation with ingredients and flavours, and every family seems to have its own peculiar culinary treats, concocted as a result of mistakes or improvisations.</p> <p>My grandmother used to served mashed potatoes with a fried egg on top. On one occasion she picked up a Marmite-smeared fork to mash the spuds. The resulting blend of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/2008/dec/13/family-life-snapshot\">Marmity mashed potatoes</a> which we dubbed \"Marmotegg\" became a family favourite and is something I still crave on a cold winter evening.

  "<p>When I was seven, I told my mum I wanted to work in the zoo. I still remember her face to this day. \"Ahhhh,\" she sighed. \"You want to be a vet?\"<br>\"No,\" I said with a shrug of confusion, \"I want to sell the ice creams.\"</p> <p>From then on and as many children do, I went through a range of career paths: actress, hairdresser, beach lifeguard, magazine journalist, wedding planner and cake decorator. You name it, I had thought about it. Yet, this week I start my PGCE. A Postgraduate Certificate in Education, or as many people have warned me a Pretty Grim Crippling Experience. Yes, I am going to be a modern languages teacher. Cue the cringing faces.</p> <p>I have spent the last four years of my degree, attempting to master the French and German languages, and although I do not consider myself a 'master' I have linguistic passion in abundance, something which I most definitely intend to share with my future students.</p> <p>Why teaching you may ask? I love children. And yes I was warned numerous times not to say that at my PGCE interview, but surely that's one of the most important things?</p> <p>I love education. As a child, I attended a mixed comprehensive school in Derbyshire and was fortunate enough to have incredible teachers. I was that child who loved school.</p> <p>I love languages. I was taught my colours in French, before I started primary school, soon after I knew my numbers and various greetings, whetting my appetite for language learning. Not too long after that, I was studying French and German at Newcastle University. I spent an amazing six months working as an English language assistant in a secondary school in Germany and six months as a journalist on the French Newspaper, <a href=\"http://www.ledauphine.com/\">Le Dauphin\u00e9 Lib\u00e9r\u00e9</a>. It was then, that I knew I had to share my European experiences with our future linguists and inspire them to enjoy, appreciate and be excited by languages and other cultures.</p> <p>Of course, it is only natural to have the nervousness whizzing around your tummy, or so I hope. I am dreading the day one of my student's says, \"Miss, what is pomegranate in French?\" Or \"Miss, how do you say platypus in German?\" In which case, I would point them in the direction of the box of dictionaries.</p> <p>It wasn't that long ago I, was at school myself and I yes I do remember the exercise books being used as frisbees, pen tubes being used to fire soggy-saliva paper bullets at the supply teachers and rude words being highlighted in every dictionary available. But, I guess it just makes it more exciting.</p> <p>I am unsure of what to expect. I am, however, ready to take on the mind-boggling pedagogy, theories and policies, I am prepared to have a cold every other week, I expect to feel like giving up numerous times and I will always have my folder-shaped shield ready for the paper bullets.</p> <p>The responsibility of educating future generations is not something to be taken lightly. I have the 12 books on the reading list, a suitcase that resembles WH Smiths, and a flask for my coffee, because that's what every teacher has right? I guess one of the most exciting things to come out of the start of this new school term is that I get to have a non-uniform day every day and much to my mum's dismay, I got to choose my new school shoes.</p> <p><em>Charlotte Derrett recently graduated in French, German and Media and is starting her PGCE at Newcastle University.</em></p> <h2>This content is brought to you by <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/guardian-professional\" title=\"Guardian Professional\">Guardian Professional</a>.

  "<p><em>Today's extract from the updated edition of <strong>The phone-hacking scandal: journalism on trial*</strong> is by a media academic, <strong>Barry Turner</strong>, who examines the way in which some of the main questions originally set by the Leveson inquiry have been answered, or not.</em></p> <p><em>I have selected just three of the questions highlighted by Turner and begin with one that concerns the effects of competition and asks whether it impacts on the way in which journalists operate...</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396302543\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/18/1347951165808/HackBookFront.jpg\" alt=\"hac\" width=\"165\" height=\"250\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Paul Dacre, editor-in-chief of the Mail titles, emphasised in his witness statements to Leveson that the readers of his paper had an editorial role. He said:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"I am held to account by my readers every day. The act of paying 55p for a newspaper is a voluntary one. If I do not connect with my readers' values and reflect their interests and aspirations, or if I offend them or am unfair or prurient, they will stop buying our newspapers. </p> <p>If that happens in great numbers I will lose my job. Newspapers only survive by connecting with their readership, by representing their interests, reflecting their aspirations and guarding them against injustice.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>This is a problematic answer to a question about morality and ethics. Dacre is talking about the newspaper as a product and his use of the word accountable is irrelevant to the question of press ethics. </p> <p>The editors of the News of the World could easily have deployed such an argument. They could argue, and in fact did frequently, that their readers had a right to the type of story produced by that paper. The question of whether a newspaper survives is naturally second to whether it is ethical.</p> <p>Dacre was vigorous in his rebuttal that he, as editor of the Daily Mail, imposed his will on journalists. In oral testimony, he dismissed the idea that he imposed his will on the newspapers' writers, suggesting that it would be incredulous that he could tell people like Alex Brummer, Simon Heffer, Max Hastings, Janet Street-Porter or Craig Brown what to write. He went on to say:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"All our writers \u2013 and I'm leaving out some brilliant ones \u2013 have their strongly held views, many of them different. It's a rich, diverse spectrum of opinion that permeates the paper.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>This rich, diverse spectrum permeating the paper, according to Dacre's witness statement, represents the interests of and reflects the aspirations of its readership, a readership with a well established right wing perspective making this \"diverse spectrum\" largely a spectrum of right wing political and economic views. </p> <p>It is quite correct that writers such as these would be unlikely to submit to editorial control and could, as suggested in his evidence, simply leave to work elsewhere. That is hardly representative, however. </p> <p>This group of individuals who write as columnists enjoy much more autonomy than the regular newsroom journalists who perhaps have rather less opportunity for walking out and into a new job.</p> <h2>Why don't we leave it to the law of the land?</h2> <p><em>Turner then deals with the matter of constraints on the press. Several publishers and editors argued that the press should not be subject to any additional constraints in relation to behaviour and standards other than those imposed by existing laws...</em></p> <p>Commentators too numerous to count have pointed out that phone hacking is illegal and many question why there is need for an inquiry in the light of that. This is fair comment; there is no set of circumstances where the hacking of a mobile phone could be legal as a news-gathering tool. </p> <p>Sufficient law exists to protect individuals from this kind of behaviour and if, in the face of criminal charges, reporters are not deterred what use is a code of ethics or set of regulations?</p> <p>Since the purpose of the press is to inform the public is it not reasonable to suggest that it should be constrained by the same laws that apply to the public?</p> <p>Well, of course that is the case but it is also clear that the press even if it is serving the public is different from the public in a number of ways. The press is a powerful institution, sufficiently powerful to make or break individuals or even governments. </p> <p>The press, even in what some describe as its decline, is a very rich institution with the mainstream media having deep pockets that protect it from legal consequences. In effect, the press is far more powerful than the individuals it serves.</p> <p>Thomas Gibbons, professor of law at Manchester university, submitted evidence suggesting that some form of \"enforced ethics\" was required to prevent media distortion since the law was silent on matters of editorial control. </p> <p>He pointed out that self-regulation failed because the economic pressures on the press were greater than the journalistic ethics. This is an interesting point. He is correct in identifying media distortion as an ethical problem and one that is not directly addressed by the law. </p> <p>The concept of an enforced code of ethics to prevent distortion of stories is indeed an interesting concept. The problem is in the definition of distortion.</p> <p>The British press has a long tradition of partisanship arising out of its evolution from an overtly and ostensibly political, even seditious origin. Britain is curious in that it effectively has two forms of press/media regulation both very different for historical and political reasons. </p> <p>Distortion is the stock in trade of some of our largest circulation newspapers and is a result of their political bias. Withholding elements of a story and exaggerating others is as old as news-gathering itself and, while it may appear disingenuous and even dishonest, it is difficult to see how any system could control this without entirely changing the traditions and practices of our free press.</p> <p>Our right wing populist press has a fascination with asylum seekers, economic migrants and benefit cheats. These three groups fit neatly into one of the oldest and most popular categories of news, that of the moral panic. </p> <p>The stories are often distorted to ridiculous extents, especially by the use of irrelevant analogies such as comparing the arrival of immigrants with the population of a large city or exaggerating the scale of benefit fraud by targeting either huge frauds or the number of cheats prosecuted in one day. </p> <p>These stories, spun to the benefit of \"Outraged of Tunbridge Wells\", are a distortion and of little value to anyone looking for accurate information about any of these undoubted problems in society but they represent freedom of expression and that includes freedom to be prejudiced.</p> <p>Where distortion is serious the law can, in fact, intervene. We have draconian defamation law in the UK and it is well established that distortion can amount to defamation. A distorted story can impute dishonesty, unfitness or incompetence.</p> <p>One area of inaccuracy that does need some oversight is the lurid publishing in tabloid papers of health stories that are usually focussed on two main themes: health risks or dramatic breakthroughs in research and treatment. </p> <p>These stories suffer from very poor corroboration of often tenuous information and range from the faintly ridiculous to the downright dangerous. </p> <p>There is no excuse for not employing ethical principles. Facts can be validated when interviewing the scientist or medical professional. A couple of standard questions can put the story in context. Has this experiment/observation been corroborated elsewhere? If not, it is not scientifically valid and can be a potentially inaccurate and misleading story.</p> <h2>Why should ethical standards chill investigative journalism?</h2> <p><em>Turner then considers why, if statutory regulation and impartiality requirements do not chill investigative reporting on television, similar constraints should not apply to the press. It is further claimed that broadcasters rely on the press to break controversial stories and then follow up.</em></p> <p>There is little, if any, evidence that broadcasters wait for the printed press to break stories. David Levy of the Reuters Institute told Leveson of a 2009 study:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"Broadcasters who do as much if not more investigative journalism than the press have to meet a two stage test set by Ofcom: first, is the infringement warranted: second, can you justify what you broadcast? </p> <p>There is no pre-broadcast censorship but a requirement to explain and defend your approach to the public interest... [the study's authors] found no evidence that the requirement has either hindered or prevented hard-hitting and important investigations.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>The statement describes the tried and tested methods of ensuring ethical standards are maintained in broadcast journalism, a platform already under tight enforceable guidelines. </p> <p>What appears to be suggested is that since broadcast can manage quite well that the imposition of an Ofcom-style regulation on the print media would not chill investigative journalism. </p> <p>But the hacking scandal is not about investigative journalism. The Leveson inquiry is not about investigative journalism, it is about media ethics and ultimately criminality. We have already seen that the two journalistic traditions of print and broadcast have starkly contrasting cultures as one would expect from beings born in different eras and for different reasons. </p> <p>Witness after witness stated that the purpose of the press is to inform the public and to hold powerful people to account. The purpose of the print media is principally to make money as was succinctly put by Jeremy Paxman in his statement to the inquiry:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"The only thing that seems to concern newspaper proprietors more than articulating their prejudices is accumulating money.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>The question is not therefore whether a new Ofcom-style regulatory body for the press would deter investigative journalism but would it so materially affect a newspaper tradition as to make it no longer viable.</p> <p><em>Tomorrow:</em> <strong>Chris Atkins</strong>, the man who made the <em>Starsuckers</em> documentary, argues that the industry needs an independent regulator with a statutory backstop</p> <p>*<em>The phone hacking scandal: journalism on trial</em>, second and updated edition, edited by Richard Lance Keeble and John Mair, is published by Abramis.
