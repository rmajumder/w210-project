  "<p>\"Did you see that hit?\" crowed the commentator to 12,000 baying spectators. It had taken six minutes for the first sickening crunch, when the British captain Steve Brown was flipped over in his wheelchair by his American opponent, Derrick Helton.</p> <p>The British wheelchair rugby team could be forgiven for having had enough of sickening crunches in their lives: three were disabled in car accidents, two while playing rugby and two more in swimming pool accidents. But in murderball, perhaps the most eagerly awaited competition of the Paralympics, the smash of colliding wheelchairs is not just within the rules, it is fetishised by players and fans.</p> <p>\"Where else can you knock people out of wheelchairs legally?\" exclaimed Aaron Phipps, the goal-scoring star of Britain's opening match against the USA, which ended in victory for the American favourites, who won gold in Beijing.</p> <p>Billed as the mutant child of basketball, ice hockey and rugby \u2013 in wheelchairs \u2013 murderball at first looks more like banger racing, with dangerously pimped-up wheelchairs bristling with protuberant metal cages and bumpers designed to upend rivals.</p> <p>But as the British players variously explained afterwards, it is actually deeply tactical, more like \"chess with violence\" or \"chess with hitting\" or \"that wizard chess in Harry Potter\".</p> <p>The Potter analogy was made by the new boy-wonder of the boisterous basketball arena, David Anthony. The 22-year-old from Neath sported a blue mohican and a punky disregard for politeness, barking at opponents and trying to punch the ball from their grasp, when not hurtling away to score 11 mostly spectacular solo goals.</p> <p>Able-bodied crowds cheering as disabled people knock themselves over, each \"hit\" celebrated with a blast of the Beastie Boys' Sabotage over the Tannoy, might not be everyone's definition of progress, but it didn't feel like voyeurism; just a fast, violent sport played by those with a flippant attitude towards being flipped over that was beyond the ken of mere mortals.</p> <p>For all the collisions and \"going mental\" as Phipps put it, much of the players' energy is taken up with dexterous swivelling to find space as the ball is thrown between players who then seek to wheel it to the opposition goal line. As if the game needed speeding up, no player can hold the ball longer than 10 seconds and a team concedes possession if they don't score in 40 seconds. The British roared away 13-11 in the first quarter as the USA seemed stunned by the partisan crowd and the aggression and pace of Brown and Phipps.</p> <p>Phipps stood out in the British team, but he had to: each player gets a points rating according to disability and no team must have more than eight points on the pitch. As Britain's 3.5 player Phipps had to make a big contribution.</p> <p>By contrast, the USA fielded a more balanced team of four 2.0 players for much of the match, including Nick Springer, a quadruple amputee who caught the ball and propelled his chair at high speed with his elbows.</p> <p>Sportingly, none of the players would reveal the precise on-pitch sledging between the British \u2013 who just missed out on a bronze medal by finishing fourth in Athens and Beijing \u2013 and the Americans, who are the current Paralympic and world champions.</p> <p>\"They tried [to intimidate us] but they failed,\" said Ross Morrison, who suffered spinal cord injuries after breaking his neck, aged 16, playing rugby. In one exchange Phipps was knocked over at full tilt, and as he struggled on the ground Chuck Aoki, the canny leading American scorer with 14 goals, wheeled over to scream \"wanker\" in his face. The USA won the battle of the tumbles, throwing British players over three times to their players being sent flying twice.</p> <p>After a shaky first quarter the Americans took control of the match, and despite a British fight back, the USA ran out comfortable 56-44 winners. The British players were happy with their performance but must now get out of a tough group containing France and Japan.</p> <p>\"That was a tough game, it was a rough game,\" said Anthony after the match. But the constant sledging was simply \"a little friendly banter\" and \"off the court we're all friends again\".</p> <p>Such X-rated clashes are not men only: murderball is a mixed sport and Britain's Kylie Grimes, one of only two women players at the Paralympics, entered the fray in the final quarter. The 24-year-old, paralysed from the neck down after jumping into a swimming pool at a party, performed some useful blocks but was repeatedly bashed by the American captain, Will Groulx.</p> <p>\"It's how it should be. If I'm playing the sport I don't want to be treated any differently,\" she said after the match.</p> <p>\"She doesn't need looking after,\" said Anthony. \"Kylie is an amazing player.\"</p> <p>To talk about bravery is a Paralympic clich\u00e9 but just as it is mistakenly believed the Inuit have hundreds of words for snow, so we really must find more ways of describing these athletes' casual absence of bother when getting severely bashed by aluminium chariots.</p> <p>The players certainly revel in the adrenalin, the knocks and the notoriety.</p> <p>\"It's the glamour sport,\" as the British player Myles Pearson \u2013 sent flying by one crunching challenge \u2013 put it. \"We are the rock stars of the Paralympics.\"</p>",
  "<p>The Obama campaign will be hoping to capture a bit of political magic when Bill Clinton makes his <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/09/05/usa-campaign-clinton-idUSL2E8K4EQY20120905\">keynote speech to the Democratic national convention</a> in Charlotte. Clinton can evoke an era of prosperity that seems like a distant dream in today's bedraggled economy.</p> <p>Apart from his powerful abilities as a speaker and advocate for the independent voters the Obama team need to win over, as president Clinton presided over eight years of strong economic growth, alongside falling unemployment, 21 million jobs added and an almost miraculous bull market in stocks and house prices. US manufacturing staged a recovery. Personal incomes rose dramatically. For those reasons his time in the White House is remembered with a rosy glow, rather than for his affair with an intern and his subsequent legal contortions.</p> <p>It's worth remembering, though, when Clinton takes the stage at the DNC in Charlotte, that he was also extraordinarily lucky \u2013 and lucky in a way that Barack Obama has not been.</p> <p>Clinton's 1992 election victory itself was rather lucky, a combination of a retrospectively mild economic downturn, an uninspiring incumbent, GOP voter fatigue and \u2013 perhaps more than anything else \u2013 the insurgent third party candidacy of Ross Perot. Having said that, Clinton also made his own luck on the campaign trail, especially in the Democratic primaries when he was dogged by evidence of extramarital affairs.</p> <p>Once in office he benefited from a golden business cycle and the rising economic tide it brought with it. That buoyancy enabled him to strike deals on raising taxes and reforming welfare without suffering the fallout that usually attends. Economic growth spurred years of bumper tax receipts, allowing the federal government to turn back time and pay off its debts. And the Federal Reserve under Alan Greenspan nodded its approval with long periods of generous monetary policy.</p> <p>He also was lucky in another respect: the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 and collapse of the Warsaw Pact ushered in a peace dividend unheard of the end of the Vietnam war, enabling the US to trim its enormous military budget. His predecessor George HW Bush had vanquished Saddam Hussain in the first Gulf War, so that even the Middle East was relatively quiescent for most of Clinton's reign. Oil prices fell and remained low.</p> <p>Domestically, he benefitted from demographic good fortune. A baby boomer himself, Clinton's time in office saw his generation enjoy their years of maximum earning potential. In 1996 \u2013 the middle of Clinton's time in office \u2013 the eldest of the baby boom generation hit 50 years old while the youngest were 32. By 2012, that aging demographic bulge is reaching retirement age of 65.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the emerging economies of Asia were entering the global marketplace. China's economic reforms were resulting in cheaper imports and new markets for the US, but before the spurt of growth that has since catapulted China into a global rival.</p> <p>Then there was technology. The internet arrived and transformed computers from office equipment into domestic appliances. The dotcom boom of the later 1990s became a breathtaking global bubble, fed by Greenspan's low interest rates and Panglossian optimism. It burst almost as spectacularly \u2013 but Bill Clinton's luck meant that happened as his presidency ended.</p> <p>Clinton's eight years in office weren't entirely without incident, even aside from Monica Lewinsky. He did face some difficult economic decisions. But in each case, the resilient growth and bumper surpluses of the US economy gave him leeway that Barack Obama has never been afforded.</p> <p>In 1994, Mexico suffered jarring currency turmoil \u2013 nicknamed the \"Tequila crisis\" \u2013 the details of which need not concern us. But Clinton and his Treasury secretary Robert Rubin battled through congressional opposition to give Mexico $50bn in assistance, enough for the peso to weather the crisis. The US government even made a $500m profit on the loans, which were repaid.</p> <p>In 1997 there was a far more dramatic series of events, starting with the Asian financial crisis that saw the \"Asian Tigers\" endure a crash of great severity, with knock-on international consequences. Russia defaulted on its debts and the collapse of the Long Term Capital Management hedge fund caused a credit crunch similar to that seen in 2008. But the underlying strength of the US economy and ever-looser monetary policy via Greenspan saw the crisis contained.</p> <p>And there were wars, most notably in the former Yugoslavia, and ill-fated interventions in Somalia. But nothing on the scale of those launched after 9/11 and inherited by Obama. </p> <p>Of course, luck isn't everything. Although it would have been difficult in the circumstances, Clinton could always have made things worse through policy errors. It's worth remembering that economic inequality rose alongside incomes, while the property boom and easy credit that many enjoyed would blow up a decade later. The Clinton-era financial deregulation would also come back to haunt America. But those consequences were well in the future when Clinton left office.</p> <p>It's also worth remembering that the golden years weren't enough to give Clinton's vice president Al Gore the White House in 2000 (although Florida's voting processes and the Supreme Court probably robbed Gore of a narrow victory). But Clinton is more popular with voters now than his last months in office \u2013 and Obama will be hoping that memories of the good times rub off on his campaign tonight. But what Obama really needs is some of Clinton's luck.</p>",
  "<!-- Block 1 --> <p><strong>Preamble</strong> I was ripped from my sleep at 7.27am this morning. Not sure why my alarm setting was so precise but there you go. It was a decent sleep, just under eight hours with only a couple of brief interruptions. My eyemask slipped off again; that always seems to happen. I'm not entirely sure what I dreamt about, but I think an ex and a Diesel shop were involved. Not diesel as in petrol; I wouldn't have used a capital letter had that been the case. I had some toast for breakfast (dry; I must remember to add Marmite to the list of things I must remember to buy) and then finished some work. I started to watch Clueless but got restless after 10 minutes so I replied to some emails before coming into the office.</p> <p>As those of you who have got this far without switching over to The Competition would surely concur, talking about No1 has a limited appeal. It's a lesson us cricket types should remember. Since England became inexplicably useful in all three formats of the game, every match has been framed in the context of being No1. When England hammered South Africa on Sunday, it was suggested by a few people that today's fifth and final ODI barely mattered because England would remain top of the rankings until the near year regardless of the result.</p> <p>In the parlance of our time, sod that! There is a series to be won here. England lead 2-1, and if they win/tie/no result today's match they will have won eight consecutive ODI series at home for the first time ever. The rankings are emphatically a good thing, but it's time we got back to the humble, self-contained joy of winning matches and winning series. Then \u2013 30 points in cricketclichebingo \u2013 the rankings will take care of themselves.</p> <!-- Block 2 --> <p><strong>England have won the toss and will bat first</strong></p> <p><strong>England</strong> Cook (capt), Bell, Bopara, Bairstow, Morgan, Kieswetter (wk), Patel, Woakes, Tredwell, Anderson, Dernbach.</p> <p><strong>South Africa</strong> Smith, Amla, Elgar, de Villiers (capt/wk), Duminy, du Plessis, Ontong, Parnell, Peterson, Steyn, M Morkel.</p> <!-- Block 3 --> <p><strong>You. Have. Mail.</strong> We know that the internet has pretty much killed society, exposing the narcissistic sociopath in us all. But once upon a time it was a sweet, innocent thing, <a href=\"http://yfrog.com/mmc1ejsj\">as this amusing report from 1992 shows</a>. (The headline is a fake, apparently, but the rest is the real thing.)</p> <p>What are your early memories of the internet? I remember <strike> the puce-faced horror of being caught by mother </strike> the phrase \"information superhighway\", and 'watching' Ian Healy hit a momentous series-winning six at Port Elizabeth on some newish website called 'Cricinfo'.</p> <!-- Block 4 --> <p><strong>1st over: England 5-0 (Cook 4, Bell 0)</strong> Dale Steyn's first ball of the match swings dangerously back in to Alastair Cook. This is Trent Bridge, after all. The third ball also shapes back in but Cook times it sweetly down the ground for four. An off-side wide completes the scoring for the over.</p> <!-- Block 5 --> <p><strong>2nd over: England 10-0 (Cook 8, Bell 1)</strong> The left-arm spinner Robin Peterson is going to open the bowling. Bell takes a single from the first ball and then Cook sweeps round the corner for four.</p> <p>\"My mind has wandered this lunchtime,\" says Peter Harmer, \"and I'm wondering, if you were only allowed to pick players whose surname began with one letter, which letter would you chose.\" That's a great question. Off the top of my head I'd go for H (Hobbs, Hutton, Hammond, Hadlee, Holding) or W (Waugh, Waugh, Warne, Weekes, Worrell, Walcott, plus Wasim and Waqar if you're allowed them as Ws).</p> <!-- Block 6 --> <p><strong>3rd over: England 19-0 (Cook 12, Bell 6)</strong> Steyn's first ball is too straight and eased off the pads for four by Ian Bell. A similarly errant delivery later in the over is pinged to the midwicket boundary by Cook. A fine start for England. In other news, here's your daily statgasm. If England win today they will set a new record for win/loss ratio in ODIs during one calendar year: they would have won 13 and lost one. Not just that, <a href=\"http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/stats/index.html?class=2;orderby=win_loss_ratio;template=results;type=team;view=year\">their current win/loss ratio of 12 is almost double the next best.</a> England 2012: the greatest one-day team ever. End of and fact.</p> <!-- Block 7 --> <p><strong>WICKET! England 23-1 (Bell LBW b Peterson 10)</strong> Bell, who is always so light on his feet against the spinners, Travoltas back in his crease to late cut Peterson for another boundary. And now he's gone! He played defensively outside the line of a delivery that went straight on from around the wicket and was given out LBW by Kumar Dharmasena. He's going to review it. I suppose there's a slight chance he got outside the line but I reckon this decision will be upheld. He's out! There wasn't even an 'umpire's call'. It hit him in line and would have hit leg stump four-fifths of the way up.</p> <!-- Block 8 --> <p><strong>4th over: England 23-1 (Cook 12, Bopara 0)</strong> Demon seamer Ravi Bopara has been promoted to No3. What a strange place he's in. Two months ago he seemed to have finally cracked it when he slapped Australia to all parts; now he can't buy a run.</p> <p>\"My first internet memory is of gathering round an acorn computer at school and slowly watching as the current weather was downloaded through the phonelines,\" says James Grinnell. \"It took 20 mins and looked like a particularly unartistic four-year-old had drawn a weather map that vaguely resembled the uk. We thought it was amazing obviously.\"</p> <!-- Block 9 --> <p><strong>WICKET! England 24-2 (Bopara c de Villiers b Steyn 0)</strong> A golden duck for Ravi Bopara. He felt outside off stump at a good delivery from Dale Steyn and edged a straightforward catch to AB de Villiers. There was a sad inevitability to Bopara failing, although I'm not sure anyone expected a first-baller. He looks shot to bits mentally, almost as bad as Mark Ramprakash back in 1995.</p> <!-- Block 10 --> <p><strong>5th over: England 24-2 (Cook 12, Bairstow 0)</strong> Jonny Bairstow is beaten second ball by a storming delivery. Steyn appealed on his own for the caught behind but there was nothing in it. The next ball goes past the edge as well to complete a sensational over.</p> <p>\"My early internet memories include all the hype about 'working from home',\" says Dr Ian Hawke. \"Which brings the question: why do you go into the office to OBO from one screen to another? Is it the great office company, or your love of public transport?\" I love my colleagues dearly, and it's got nothing to do with the fact we can't use the OBO publishing system from home. Nothing at all.</p> <!-- Block 11 --> <p><strong>6th over: England 30-2 (Cook 14, Bairstow 4)</strong> Morne Morkel replaces Robin Peterson. Bairstow crunches him classily through midwicket for four. \"Does the fact that the Sun article was written by Dot Comme,\" begins Simon Pennington, \"and the 'riddle of 'E' mail' is also referenced at the end suggest this might have been an April 1 story?\" I've been had. I'm King Patsy. I've been played for a fool again, and this time there wasn't even a kooky broad with a love of geek pop involved. Darn it. Still, it's a decent excuse for us to reminisce about when the internet was good, eh? Eh?</p> <!-- Block 12 --> <p><strong>7th over: England 30-2 (Cook 14, Bairstow 4)</strong> Steyn is bowling straight and trying to shape it back into Cook, who is vulnerable to that angle of attack. After five balls on the stumps, he angles one across Cook and past the outside edge. A maiden.</p> <p>\"Well, the H-team (Hobbs, Hutton, Hammond, Headley, Harvey, Hill, Hadlee, Healy, Holding, Hall, Harbhajan (if he's allowed)) has probably the greatest batting line up,\" says Josh Robinson, \"and Clive Lloyd's side (Lawry, Langer, Lara, Leyland, Lloyd, Lindsay, Lindwall, Larwood, Laker, Lohmann, Lillee) has a fantastic attack, but I'd like to go out on a limb and say that this is perhaps the strongest of the lot: Hanif Mohammad, Arthur Morris, Phil Mead, Javed Miandad (c), Stan McCabe, Keith Miller, Rod Marsh, Malcolm Marshall, Ted McDonald, Muttiah Muralitharan, Glenn McGrath (arguably with Mushtaq Mohammad coming in for Marsh). It could be that I'm not old enough to have seen many of the greats, but I find it hard to argue with any side containing Marshall, McGrath and Murali.\" And Keith Miller first change. That's an awesome team. Then again, Larwood, Lillee and Lohmann...</p> <!-- Block 13 --> <p><strong>8th over: England 39-2 (Cook 18, Bairstow 9)</strong> After 12 consecutive dot balls, Bairstow cuts Morkel crisply for four. It's a good over for England in fact, with nine from it when Cook pulls the last ball handsomely over midwicket for four. </p> <p>\"I first started using e-mail and the internet at university \u2013 this inevitably involved a 10-minute walk late in the evening from my dorm to the school's computer lab, sending a few e-mails and then popping in <a href=\"http://www.retrocpu.com/dos/games/0-9/1-0_soccer_manager\">a copy of One-Nil</a> into the floppy disk drive and staying up into the wee hours, watching Luc Nilis bang goals in for fun at the head of my strike force,\" says Darren Kilfara. \"What a game that was\u2026never mind that said floppy disk became infected by a prototypical virus which ultimately wiped out at least one of my family's PCs back at home. Totally worth it.\" And to think some people leave university with regrets.</p> <!-- Block 14 --> <p><strong>9th over: England 41-2 (Cook 19, Bairstow 10)</strong> Bairstow is put down by de Villiers, although it was an exceptionally difficult chance. He inside edged a sharp delivery from Steyn, which meant de Villiers had to change direction and then try to get his left hand down to take the ball at instep height. He got down in time but couldn't hang on. As Sir Ian Botham says on Sky, we should really probably him with saving four runs rather than putting it down as a dropped catch.</p> <p>\"That team of Ms is pretty good,\" says Rob Lee-Davey, \"but someone is going to have to make way for McCague.\" Especially if they have <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_McCague\">team-bonding trips to Dublin</a>.</p> <!-- Block 15 --> <p><strong>10th over: England 42-2 (Cook 20, Bairstow 10)</strong> \"The B side is pretty good too,\" says Steve Hudson. \"The B side is pretty good too: Boycott, Sid Barnes, Bradman, Barrington, Border, Botham, Benaud (capt), Bedser, SF Barnes, Bishop, Bedi.\" And Colin Bland as 12th man.</p> <!-- Block 16 --> <p><strong>11th over: England 48-2 (Cook 25, Bairstow 11)</strong> Cook tries to cut the new bowler Parnell, but it's a bit too full for the shot and he bottom edges it on the bounce to de Villiers. He nails the shot later in the over, however, savaging Parnell for four. </p> <p>\"I was first aware of people actually using the internet in my sixth form at school (93/94),\" says Tim Davis. \"The small band of computer literate <strike> geeks </strike> fellow students back in those days would use the school computers in the library to email each other at lunchtime. 'But\u2026 why not just talk to each other?' I'd cry, somewhat mockingly. They're probably all happily married, rich, successful businessmen now. Whereas I'm still enduring the puce-faced horror of being caught by mother\u2026\" Was the web widely available in 1993-94? Crikey. When I recall the Borden Grammar School sixth form of 1993-94, the only W that springs to mind rhymes with ledgies.</p> <!-- Block 17 --> <p><strong>12th over: England 48-2 (Cook 25, Bairstow 12)</strong> The left-arm spinner Dean Elgar is on for Morkel. His fourth ball is a dipping full toss that Bairstow fails to put away, and there's just a single from the over. Cook has 25 from 32, Bairstow 12 from 27.</p> <p>\"My earliest memory of the Internet is the moment I finally had access, via my Dad's work laptop, an suddenly realising I had no idea what I wanted to read,\" says Brad McMillian. \"The term 'surfing the net' was in use by that time, and had conjured in my mind the idea that I would simply be taken on a random voyage of exciting discovery as soon as I logged on. Fifteen-plus years later I still have no idea what I want to read/discover, so I simply stick to what I used to rely on newspapers and magazines for: news and sport etc and so on...\"</p> <!-- Block 18 --> <p><strong>13th over: England 53-2 (Cook 26, Bairstow 13)</strong> Parnell shrieks for LBW against Bairstow, who walked across his stumps. That looked pretty close but there were doubts over where it pitched and perhaps height. Hawkeye shows it did pitch fractionally outside leg. Everything else is bunkum.</p> <p>\"Barrington?\" says Alex Netherton. \"Does he means <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2007/jul/21/golf.theopen200711?INTCMP=SRCH\">Barrington 'Biscuits' Barrington</a> (see 5pm)?\"</p> <!-- Block 19 --> <p><strong>14th over: England 60-2 (Cook 28, Bairstow 17)</strong> Bairstow gives Elgar the charge and drags an inside edge for a single. Later in the over he premeditates a lap for a couple \u2013 and then Elgar bowls a big front-foot no-ball. That's criminal, especially when the punishment is a free hit, although he redeems himself with an excellent curving yorker that Bairstow can only block. Seven from the over.</p> <p>In other news, who wants to help an OBOette in distress? \"Perhaps somebody can help we find a game called 'Money, Money, Money' that I played on my grandfather's Vic-20 in 1981 or thereabouts,\" says Sara Torvalds. \"There are Commodore 64 games you can buy, but I've yet to see any of the really crude stuff for the Vic-20 available anywhere. Anyone? It was a stick man that you had to guide across the screen, avoiding asterisk 'snow flakes' while fetching a 'bag' of \u2013 you guessed it \u2013 money and getting back safely.\"</p> <!-- Block 20 --> <p><strong>15th over: England 63-2 (Cook 30, Bairstow 18)</strong> Parnell continues to feed Cook's cut, which on the Dunderhead Scale is right up there with informing Francis Begbie that's he the epitome of androgyny \u2013 but this time he rifles it straight to a fielder. Three from the over.</p> <p>\"My earliest memory of the internet is on the day that I got my A-level results,\" says Richard O'Hagan. \"My Dad was a university lecturer at the time and had an early version of email with which he was able to contact my preferred university - some place in Staffordshire - to check I had got in. This was after he rang me at work with my results and got them wrong.\" The internet existed in the 1960s? Honk! Ho-honk! Come on, honk with me now.</p> <!-- Block 21 --> <p><strong>16th over: England 69-2 (Cook 31, Bairstow 22)</strong> South Africa take their bowling Powerplay at the first opportunity and give the ball to Robin Peterson. He concedes just one from the first five deliveries; then, with fine leg and square leg up, Bairstow sweeps between the two men for four.</p> <p>\"My highlight of the summer?\" says Luke Dealtry. \"Thanks for asking. I think it's the celebration unveiled by Ravi in the last few ODIs where he offers a strong-armed handshake just above waist height to whomsoever is nearest; none of this hugging or whooping rubbish. Think it'll ever catch on? I hear he's going for cotton slacks, a button-up shirt and a neckerchief if he plays in India.\" <br>Great point. Has there ever been a more chappish gesture on a cricket field <a href=\"http://www.espncricinfo.com/england-v-south-africa-2012/content/image/580423.html\">than the Bopara handshake</a>?</p> <!-- Block 22 --> <p><strong>17th over: England 73-2 (Cook 32, Bairstow 24)</strong> Morne Morkel is wided for a leg-side short ball to Bairstow. Four from the over. \"Steve Hudson's 'B' team looks very strong but would lose every game due to the number of byes it concedes,\" says Martin Duckworth. \"So may I suggest a 'Keeper, namely Boucher? And tell SF Barnes he's on the twos this week.\" You can have that pleasure. (And then reinstate him ahead of Ian Bishop.)</p> <!-- Block 23 --> <p><strong>18th over: England 75-2 (Cook 34, Bairstow 25)</strong> Peterson puts down Cook, a very sharp return chance as he dived low to his left. He took a similar but probably more difficult chance to dismiss Ian Bell (I think) in the World Cup last year. He didn't close his hands at the right time which suggests he might have thought it was a bump ball.</p> <p>\"I was going to regale you with tales of meeting up with like-minded Star Trek: Deep Space Nine fans in 1995 thanks to the internet while everyone else in the country was making out to Lush B-sides, but instead you may want to take a peek at Ravi Bopara's wiki page,\" says my colleague James Walsh. \"<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ravi_Bopara\">It's got a lot more duck-related lately</a>.\" It's really sad. He was in fantastic form before his personal problems. How many setbacks can a bloke cope with before he decides some things just aren't meant to be?</p> <!-- Block 24 --> <p><strong>WICKET! England 79-3 (Bairstow c Ontong b Morkel 29)</strong> Bairstow has flicked Morne Morkel straight to deep midwicket. He seemed to time it extremely well, and I thought it was clearing the ropes, but in fact he pinged it straight to Justin Ontong. He was aiming towards square leg rather than midwicket. That's a frustrating dismissal because he was looking good and had swivel-pulled the previous delivery superbly for four.</p> <!-- Block 25 --> <p><strong>19th over: England 79-3 (Cook 34, Morgan 0)</strong> Stop whatever you're doing and acquaint yourself with the F5 button: the new batsman is the in-form Eoin Morgan.</p> <p>\"What is a good score on this pitch?\" says Andrew Hurley. \"270? Strange Finn is not playing, for all that I think it's good to finally see Woakes. The dryness of the pitch should really help Patel and Tredwell.\" I'm hopeless at judging pitches, but you'd think anything above 250 would be competitive. As ever, so much depends on Morgan. I'm not sure why they left Finn out as he's been England's best one-day bowler by a distance for the last 12 months, although he hasn't been quite at his best in this series.</p> <!-- Block 26 --> <p><strong>WICKET! England 82-4 (Morgan c Amla b Duminy 0)</strong> Get back to work: Morgan has gone second ball for nought! AB de Villiers brought mid-on up a few yards and Morgan took the bait. He tried to drill the new bowler JP Duminy over the top but screwed it straight to Amla at mid-on. That's a mighty wicket for South Africa, and a triumph for the captain de Villiers.</p> <!-- Block 27 --> <p><strong>20th over: England 82-4 (Cook 37, Kieswetter 0)</strong> Clue 1: it has four letters. Clue 2: England are in it.</p> <p>\"My earliest internet memories: the year was 1995, I was in grade 5 and we purchased a newfangled invention called a dial-up modem,\" says SB Tang. \"Applications and websites I remember using: Hotmail, ICQ (remember that?), and a plethora of crummy search engines, including but not limited to, Altavista, Lycos and Yahoo. But, above all, I remember an incredible discovery made independently and simultaneously by both me and my mate Alex \u2014 Cricinfo. Truly, the cricketing gods' gift to our generation. Long may it prosper.\"</p> <!-- Block 28 --> <p><strong>21st over: England 86-4 (Cook 41, Kieswetter 0)</strong> Cook edges a cut at the new bowler Parnell through the vacant slip area for four. This will be a good test of the new batsman Craig Kieswetter; in his one-day international career he has usually started his innings in the first 10 overs or the last 10. This is a good chance to show he can rotate the strike and build an innings.</p> <p>\"Just tuned in to see wicket four go down,\" says Hannah Marsh. \"I'm going back to the Paras...\" Being quite stupid and all, for about 30 seconds I genuinely thought that was a reference to writing, and that the kids were now calling writing \"going back to the paras\".</p> <!-- Block 29 --> <p><strong>22nd over: England 88-4 (Cook 42, Kieswetter 0)</strong> \"First memory/use of internet: first job in 1998 (!) \u2013 told to research things on the internet, I spent 15 minutes staring at a blank Netscape Navigator page before a kindly colleague showed me where to type the url\u2026\" says Guy Mavor. Nowadays you could avoid human contact by emailing someone to ask how to do it.</p> <!-- Block 30 --> <p><strong>23rd over: England 91-4 (Cook 45, Kieswetter 0)</strong> Three from Parnell's over. For the second time in the innings, England are rebuilding after the loss of two quick wickets.</p> <p>Do you mind if I have a drink of water before going back to the paras? Thanks. It's Buxton, a 500ml bottle. I buy them in packs of eight to save money. It makes sense to do so because I like to bring one each day for the hour train journey into London. It's so important to keep hydrated, especially in the summer. There are myriad benefits to drinking water.</p> <!-- Block 31 --> <p><strong>24th over: England 96-4 (Cook 49, Kieswetter 1)</strong> Cook drives Peterson off the back foot for a couple, helped by a misfield from Elgar at short extra. Kieswetter gets off the mark from his ninth delivery, driving to long off. His nurdling has improved since he started but there is still plenty of work to do. It'll be really interesting to see how he goes today.</p> <p>\"Hope all well?\" says our old friend Sam Collins before getting down to brass tacks. \"The bad news is I'm here again to ask you for another plug. The good news is I hope it will be worth watching.

It's not a trailer, as we haven't cut the film yet, but more something we are showing to distributors and money men to help us finish the film, to prove that we haven't been filming ourselves taking pictures of food for the last nine months. This promo features guys like Strauss, Pietersen, Modi, Holding, Clarke, Srinivasan, Nicholas, Chappell, Dravid and Ed Cowan. Mostly with their clothes on. Lord Selve and Mike Brearley are among the many others we've canvassed too, and should make the final cut that we are hoping to release in May/ June 2013. As independent filmmakers we need to keep asking people to spread the word, so please visit <a href=\"http://www.deathofagentlemanfilm.com\">www.deathofagentlemanfilm.com</a> for further details on the film and investment opportunities.\"</p> <!-- Block 32 --> <p><strong>25th over: England 99-4 (Cook 51, Kieswetter 2)</strong> A single off Parnell brings Cook to a strong half-century from 69 balls. It's a bit excessive to say he needed a score, but after 32 runs in the first four matches he'll be pleased with this. And, as he showed against Pakistan earlier this year, he knows how to bat through when the side are batting first. If England are going to win this they may well need a century from Cook.</p> <p>\"If it's any small consolation,\" says Michael Hunt, \"I spent more than a couple of seconds after reading Over 21 not understanding how you could have made that mistake, but also not really understanding Hannah Marsh's decision to get over the loss of wickets by returning top being a paratrooper.\"</p> <!-- Block 33 --> <p><strong>WICKET! England 99-5 (Cook ct and b du Plessis 51)</strong> Dear oh dear. Francois du Plessis's part-time legspin has brought a wicket second ball. A batsman has 99 problems at the crease but a low full toss should never be one. Cook could have done pretty much anything with it, but he popped a low return catch that du Plessis claimed gleefully. That brought to mind Jacques Rudolph's dismissal of Nasser Hussain at Headingley in 2003; a real WTF moment. Du Plessis hardly ever bowls in ODIs; in fact, that wicket has halved his average of 115.</p> <!-- Block 34 --> <p><strong>26th over: England 101-5 (Kieswetter 3, Patel 1)</strong> A chap called 'Smylers' informs us that Steven Finn has a back injury, hence his absence. The advantage of that is that England now have Chris Woakes coming in at No8.</p> <!-- Block 35 --> <p><strong>27th over: England 111-5 (Kieswetter 10, Patel 2)</strong> Wayne Parnell bowls consecutive front-foot no-balls. The first free hit is squirted for a single by Kieswetter, the second driven for a single by Samit Patel, who was almost run out off a free hit the other day. Kieswetter shows his class with a stunning extra-cover drive for four, holding the pose at the end of his follow through, and then he bottom edges a wild cut stroke on the bounce to de Villiers. What a strange player he is. He uses the sublime and ridiculous as starting points to go further east and west.</p> <p>\"I'd love to send you an email about my first internet memory,\" says Alex Netherton. \"Sadly I am at work and am a bit distracted. I got into work for about nine in the morning (I set my alarm for half seven but got up at 6.59 and had a longer shower than usual instead) and got the bus to work. I've had two lunches today, because I'm going for a run in a bit and want to run further than usual. I had a salt beef baguette, and then some kedgeree a couple of hours later. I'm going to try to run seven miles, running from Highbury to Barbican then back again. Then I'm going to watch Breaking Bad. I think the most recent series has been the best so far, though I'm confused why people say it's good as the Sopranos, when it's not as memorable and far less clever scriptwise. I'm using the internet to send this though, which is apposite, I suppose.\"</p> <!-- Block 36 --> <p><strong>28th over: England 117-5 (Kieswetter 11, Patel 7)</strong> A bit of rubbish from du Plessis is cut crisply for four by Patel. Six from the over. \"You are inviting opprobrium with your purchasing of bottled water,\" says James Galea. \"In the Guardian's pages, indeed. You know those bottles are refillable? I've still got one at home with Ali Cook's lovely face on one side, Matt Prior's less lovely face on the other.\" Refillable with what? <em>Tap</em> water. Eugh!</p> <!-- Block 37 --> <p><strong>29th over: England 118-5 (Kieswetter 12, Patel 7)</strong> A nice, aggressive move from AB de Villiers, who brings back Dale Steyn in the hope of some hot boot-on-throat action. A good over costs just one. Kieswetter has 12 from 30, Patel 7 from 8.</p> <p>\"I remember seeing the 'internet' on our library PCs at Sheffield Uni in 1993,\" says Guy Hornsby. \"Eager to delve in, I started up Netscape and stared at the gruesome flashing colours of Yahoo's homepage (for a couple of weeks I thought it was the homepage of the entire internet until I found the settings) and created my cc mail account so I could email stuff to other students from a floppy disk. That whole last sentence would mean almost nothing to anyone under 30 would it? I still remember fondly playing Doom on my 'Maths DX 66 co-processor' (8mb RAM!!!) and thinking it was the best thing in the world. I blame my 2:2 in Geography on Championship Manager though. That and my 56k modem. God pictures downloaded slowly in those days.\"</p> <!-- Block 38 --> <p><strong>30th over: England 124-5 (Kieswetter 16, Patel 8)</strong> Kieswetter dances down the track to the new bowler Elgar to blast his second ball sweetly to long off for a single. He plays some bloody good shots for one, but he still doesn't play enough shots for one. There are mitigating circumstances, of course, but 62 per cent of his deliveries in this innings have been dot balls. </p> <p>\"Still drooling over which openers to select for the G-men: Greenidge, Gooch, Gayle, Gavaskar?\" drools Michael Wilbur. \"We should find a place somewhere for WG Grace, of course, and I'd like Gower coming in the middle order under no pressure at 400-2. Our keeper Gilchrist should have some licence to play his shots. We might perm one of Ganguly, Greig, Gambhir, Gatting to complete the batting places, but I'm struggling to come up with a strong bowling attack beyond Garner, Gillespie and Gibbs. I think Gary Gilmour doesn't quite have the gravitas required to mix along with his team mates here, or maybe Greig has a role here? Any thoughts on our third quickie?\" It's between Charlie Griffith and Darren Gough I'd say. Or you could whistle up Roy Gilchrist to make things a bit lively. Tony Greig has to play at No6; he's streets ahead of the others.</p> <!-- Block 39 --> <p><strong>WICKET! England 124-6 (Patel c de Villiers b Steyn 9)</strong> Brilliant work from Dale Steyn, who has hoodwinked Samit Patel with the slower bouncer. Patel leered at it for a few seconds with the befuddlement of a man whose space/time continuum had just been broken before gloving it gently on its way to the keeper AB de Villiers. It's another triumph for de Villiers, who brought back Steyn for precisely that purpose. I wonder if Roy Gilchrist ever used the slower bouncer.</p> <!-- Block 40 --> <p><strong>31st over: England 124-6 (Kieswetter 16, Woakes 0)</strong> A wicket maiden from Stale Deyn, brother of Agyness. \"I'd love to tell you about my internet memories too, but I'm at work too and a bit bored,\" says Robert Armes. \"I got up at 7.30 this morning, woken by my wife opening the curtains pointedly loudly. I then had breakfast, which consisted of muesli and coffee. I had a sandwich for lunch but am unsure what I'll be eating this evening.\"</p> <!-- Block 41 --> <p><strong>32nd over: England 130-6 (Kieswetter 21, Woakes 1)</strong> Kieswetter pulls a filthy delivery from Elgar for four and then pushes a single, his 1000th run in ODIs. His figures (average 31; strike rate 91) are pretty good for a man whose place does not always seem entirely secure.</p> <p>\"In other fascinating/mildly interesting/boring/utterly useless internet-related news, WWW is the only initialism that takes longer to say than what it stands for: World Wide Web,\" says Nick Barrett. \"Before you ask no that will not get you the ladies in bars. i know, I was shocked as well.\"</p> <!-- Block 42 --> <p><strong>33rd over: England 132-6 (Kieswetter 22, Woakes 2)</strong> Robin Peterson is back. Chris Woakes is a decent man to have at No8; at the age of 23 he has six first-class centuries (though oddly he has never reached fifty in a one-day match, even for Warwickshire). He is taking time to play himself in, as he must with England six down, and there are two from the over.</p> <p>\"Our household got online in 1996, when I was 13,\" says Niall Harden, \"and I remember typing in http://www.sex.com, just to see what was there. I then panicked, deleted most of the information on my dad's hard drive, and for a while I steamed open all the bills which came in the post, in the belief that our itemised phone bill would have a detailed browser history.\" Now this is more like it. Come on, some of you must have stories of being caught with your browsers down.</p> <!-- Block 43 --> <p><strong>34th over: England 135-6 (Kieswetter 24, Woakes 3)</strong> Duminy replaces Elgar, the 35th bowling chance of the day. Three singles from the over. \"Lot of talk on Sky about low totals and cagey cricket creeping into 50-over cricket (and this series in particular),\" says Harry Tuttle. \"God forbid the Test match will die out, but as it gets rarer our attitude to the different types of LO cricket will evolve. T20 has clearly accelerated thinking about run-scoring, risk-taking and bowling tactics \u2013 not all of it attacking, as is the caricature (for example, top-level T20 is an environment where a dot ball is just as valuable as a wicket). This has clearly had a trickledown (or up) effect on ODIs \u2013 they're no longer sped-up Tests, but slowed down T20s.\"</p> <!-- Block 44 --> <p><strong>35th over: England 140-6 (Kieswetter 27, Woakes 5)</strong> Woakes almost offers a return catch, pushing the ball <em>just</em> past his left hand as he dived low to his left. Five singles from the over, and now England have to take the batting Powerplay.</p> <p>\"Tell Nick Barrett (32nd over) that VW is another example, as it George W (Walker) Bush,\" says Steve Hudson. \"And tell him I've pulled loads of birds with this stuff, it's catnip to them.\" They love the word 'birds' too, I've heard. As for the first bit, I've been had again! It's the day of the patsy.</p> <!-- Block 45 --> <p><strong>36th over: England 149-6 (Kieswetter 32, Woakes 9)</strong> Morne Morkel bowls the first ball of the Powerplay, and Craig Kieswetter smashes it over the covers for four. Then Woakes, beaten for pace, top-edges a hook over the keeper's head for four more. That almost went for six.</p> <p>\"Tell Steve Hudson that if it takes him longer to say 'Dubya' than 'Walker' then he's doing it differently,\" says Josh Robinson. I've been had again!</p> <!-- Block 46 --> <p><strong>37th over: England 155-6 (Kieswetter 33, Woakes 14)</strong> England probably need to get up to 220 to give themselves any chance. Woakes adds four to the total with another top edge, this time as he attempts to cut Parnell. </p> <p>\"A post about accessing internet porn sent by 'Niall Harden'?\" says Sean Moore. \"Really?\" Arf. A quick browse through the Guardian search engine will tell you he's an OBO regular. Then again I may have been inventing emails from him for the last five years, all the while building up to this moment. Just wait till you see what the punchline is for 'Gary Naylor'.</p> <!-- Block 47 --> <p><strong>WICKET! England 156-7 (Kieswetter c Amla b Morkel 33)</strong> Craig Kieswetter's useful innings ends in frustration fashion. He tried to smash Morkel back over his head but sliced it miles in the air, and Hashim Amla backpedalled from mid-off to take a comfortable catch. It might have been a slower ball. Either way, Kieswetter probably didn't need to play that shot at that time; it's all part of his education. Not that this is of any consolation to England just now, because they are going to lose this game and draw the series 2-2. There have been so many soft dismissals today. Sometimes it happens.</p> <!-- Block 48 --> <p><strong>38th over: England 157-7 (Woakes 16, Tredwell 0)</strong> \"As your reader seems to be fascinated by your exemplary first person narrative detailing everything (a student of Russian formalism could give you the correct term for this, but I always got the fabula and syuzhet confused even when I was teaching it), I thought I would let him/her know there is a short story based on a minute by minute update of goings on during a day (an MBM short story no less) by Leonhard Thoma,\" says Ian Copestake. \"Unfortunately it's in German but its called 'Verlieren'.\" A short story about nothing? They've nicked my idea!</p> <!-- Block 49 --> <p><strong>39th over: England 159-7 (Woakes 17, Tredwell 1)</strong> \"George Walker Bush,\" says Phil Sawyer. \"I believe both Josh Robinson and Steve Hudson have spelt 'Walker' incorrectly.\"</p> <!-- Block 50 --> <p><strong>40th over: England 165-7 (Woakes 22, Tredwell 2)</strong> Morkel pulls up with a side problem, although after a bit of treatment he decides to complete the over. That's a bit surprising; why risk it? Woakes flicks a short ball off the hip for four.</p> <p>\"Reading The Spin on Kieswetter and Prior this morning while England<br>Women were beating Pakistan,\" begins Smylers, \"I was wondering how you think Sarah Taylor compares to either of them? In today's T20 match she scored 35 from 17 balls.\" She is a massive genius. <a href=\"https://en.twitter.com/selvecricket/status/241108095651168256\">It's hard to disagree with Selve's verdict</a>.</p> <!-- Block 51 --> <p><strong>41st over: England 168-7 (Woakes 24, Tredwell 3)</strong> Tredwell is beaten, trying to cut a short one from Duminy, and then Woakes is almost run out. A direct hit from du Plessis in the covers would have done for him.</p> <!-- Block 52 --> <p><strong>42nd over: England 172-7 (Woakes 26, Tredwell 5)</strong> If you had told us two weeks ago that this series would end 2-2, we would have envisaged a thriller. As it is the DVD of this series, entitled 'The Greatest One-Day Series' will be available from never, priced \u00a31.</p> <!-- Block 53 --> <p><strong>43rd over: England 174-7 (Woakes 27, Tredwell 6)</strong> Dale Steyn returns to the attack. I think Nasser just said that's the 17th bowling change of the innings. England continue to potter along in singles for the time being. If Woakes is still there in around four overs' time he will start to tee off.</p> <p>\"I remember coming home from boarding school aged about 14 and getting on the web the first time my parents went out with all the filthy intentions you might expect,\" says David Sherwin. \"I opened the browser history (why, I'm not sure) to discover that one of my parents (and it wasn't hard to guess which) shared all my filthy intentions. Not only was this somewhat deflating in that moment, I foolishly brought it up as a 'winning gambit' next time I was arguing with my parents. Bit of a frosty dinner table that evening.\"</p> <!-- Block 54 --> <p><strong>WICKET! England 175-8 (Tredwell b Peterson 6)</strong> Tredwell is done completely in the flight by Peterson, bowled off the inside edge as he tries a vile smear across the line.</p> <!-- Block 55 --> <p><strong>WICKET! England 175-9 (Anderson c M Morkel b Peterson 0)</strong> Two in two balls. Anderson plays a strangely ambitious shot, mistiming a big drive high in the air to mid-off. He was done in the flight as well. Anderson should have just played for Woakes at that stage.</p> <!-- Block 56 --> <p><strong>44th over: England 177-9 (Woakes 29, Dernbach 1)</strong> The batsmen crossed, which means Woakes will face the hat-trick ball. He inside edges it safely round the corner and then drives a single down the ground. Dernbach also takes a single off the final ball; an odd move as it means he rather than Woakes will face Dale Steyn.</p> <p>\"Not a first memory of the internet, but the very latest tale of how far it has come,\" says Dom Price. \"Today The Telegraph puts up a story on its website about a potential cure for cancer that is stalled through lack of funds; someone in the comments sections suggests a crowd-sourcing web page; <a href=\"http://www.fundingjar.com/projects/130/project-info/\">it's set up immediately</a>; and they are already 1% of the way to their total within a few hours. Well done The Internet.\"</p> <!-- Block 57 --> <p><strong>45th over: England 181-9 (Woakes 32, Dernbach 2)</strong> Dernbach somehow survives Steyn's first three deliveries before getting a single off the fourth. Woakes keeps the strike with a single off the lat ball.</p> <!-- Block 58 --> <p><strong>WICKET! England 182 all out (Dernbach c de Villiers b Parnell 2)</strong> Another poor stroke ends an innings of soft dismissals. Dernbach top edges a pull to the keeper and South Africa will need just <strong>183 </strong>to ensure the series ends 2-2. The Is are already dotted, and you'd expect them to care of the Ts.</p> <!-- Block 59 --> <p><strong>INNINGS BREAK</strong></p> <!-- Block 60 --> <p><strong>The good news</strong> is that England defended an even feebler total against South Africa at last year's World Cup. The bad news is that they are not going to do so today/night. The series is going to end 2-2. Go home. Play on the internet.</p> <!-- Block 61 --> <p><strong>1st over: South Africa 8-0 (target 183; Amla 7, Smith 1)</strong> You want two things in one-day cricket: lots of runs and close finishes. As such, this series has been a bit of a stinker. Jimmy Anderson is going to bowl the first over. He usually makes the ball swing here. It's not enough to make it talk; if England are to win he needs to make it sing like a canary. He does get a bit of swing, but his second ball is far too straight and Amla wrists it through midwicket for four.</p> <p>\"Evening Smyth <strike> , evening everybody </strike>,\" says Josh Robinson. \"Just out of interest: what odds would you give on an England victory this evening?\"</p> <p>I'm not giving odds as a I'm poor man who needs every last copper in that jar, but you can choose any forfeit you like if England win, so long as it won't end up with me having a stint in the clink.</p> <!-- Block 62 --> <p><strong>WICKET! South Africa 8-1 (Smith c Tredwell b Dernbach 1)</strong> Prepare the forfeits. It's on! Smith has gone, caught by Tredwell at second slip off Dernbach. He launched himself towards a very wide delivery that raced off the edge towards Tredwell. He dropped a couple on Sunday but was able to grab this at the second attempt after it bounced off his chest.</p> <!-- Block 63 --> <p><strong>2nd over: South Africa 11-1 (target 183; Amla 7, du Plessis 3)</strong> The out-of-form Faf du Plessis has been promoted to No3. Get Ravi Bopara on.</p> <!-- Block 64 --> <p><strong>WICKET! South Africa 11-2 (du Plessis c Kieswetter b Anderson 3)</strong> Crikey. That's right: <em>crikey</em>. South Africa are two down, and du Plessis's miserable trot has continued. He got a nice healthy edge to a beautiful lifting delivery from Anderson, and Kieswetter took a routine catch. Anderson punches the air with the zeal of a man who thinks England can win this.</p> <!-- Block 65 --> <p><strong>3rd over: South Africa 11-2 (target 183; Amla 7, Elgar 0)</strong><br>Anderson's first ball to Elgar is a beauty that swings back, rams into the thigh and gets stuck between his legs. Anderson is charging in at the moment. His last ball goes the other way and beats Edgar's nervous push. Brilliant stuff.</p> <!-- Block 66 --> <p><strong>4th over: South Africa 13-2 (target 183; Amla 8, Elgar 1)</strong> If England get Amla soon they might start to fancy this, because South Africa don't have that strong a batting line-up. Elgar is beaten again, this time by Dernbach.</p> <p>\"Forfeit,\" says Keith Flett. \"If England win, Smyth doesn't shave until January 1st...\" It's a deal.</p> <!-- Block 67 --> <p><strong>WICKET! South Africa 14-3 (Elgar c Kieswetter b Anderson 1)</strong> This is sensational bowling. Anderson gave Elgar an emphatic working-over, beating him with consecutive deliveries before putting him out of his misery with another cracker that lifted and seamed away to take a thin edge on its way through to Kieswetter. That really was outstanding. Elgar goes for one from 10 balls, and he played and missed at five of those.</p> <!-- Block 68 --> <p><strong>5th over: South Africa 14-3 (target 183; Amla 8, de Villiers 0)</strong> Anderson swerves another cracker past the new batsman AB de Villiers. A dot ball means that Anderson has bowled consecutive wicket maidens. This must surely be his favourite ground. He is the only man to <a href=\"http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/stats/index.html?class=11;ground=34;template=results;type=bowling\">take more than 50 wickets in international cricket at Trent Bridge</a>.</p> <p>\"I was having a conversation during the Test series (pre-Strauss retirement) on the England XI for the first Ashes Test next summer\" says William Hardy. \"He had no Strauss or Bell, Trott opening, Prior at No6 and Woakes in. Personally, I can't see either England moving away from their formula, or Bell being dropped. But I wondered what you thought the side would be, and if you see any major changes?\" These are really difficult. I did one of these in March 2008, ahead of 2009, and it was completely wrong (it had Vaughan, Panesar, Ambrose I think). But if I was guessing I would say: Cook, Carberry, Trott, Pietersen, Bell, Morgan, Prior, Swann, Broad, Anderson, Finn. Groundbreaking stuff, eh. Obviously Carberry, KP and Morgan are the iffy three there. I also wouldn't be shocked if Swann didn't make it, though obviously we hope he does.</p> <!-- Block 69 --> <p><strong>6th over: South Africa 19-3 (target 183; Amla 9, de Villiers 4)</strong> Pressure? Arf. De Villiers leans into a delicious back-foot drive at Dernbach that races through the covers for four.</p> <p>\"Do you share the nagging feeling that while Amla's still at the crease, none of this matters?\" says professional mindreader Brad McMillan.</p> <!-- Block 70 --> <p><strong>7th over: South Africa 26-3 (target 183; Amla 11, de Villiers 9)</strong> de Villiers plays a beautiful stroke, timing Anderson to the left of mid-on for four. Then he plays a defensive shot into the ground, from where it kicks to hit him in the grille.</p> <p>\"Surely the only response to a beard related forfeit from Flett is for him to shave off his whiskers should SA still win this,\" says Peter McKean. \"Or at least pare it back to some mutton chops.\" Keith Flett has a beard?</p> <!-- Block 71 --> <p><strong>8th over: South Africa 35-3 (target 183; Amla 11, de Villiers 17)</strong> South Africa have plenty of overs to work with but de Villiers only plays one way, and he pulls majestic consecutive boundaries off Dernbach. The strike rate for each length of delivery on Dernbach's fledgling pitch map is pretty instructive: full (150.00), good (0.00), short (233.33). Next stop, the science of rockets.</p> <p>\"I thought the forfeit was supposed to be for you,\" says Jamie Jermain, \"not for everyone else...\"</p> <!-- Block 72 --> <p><strong>9th over: South Africa 38-3 (target 183; Amla 13, de Villiers 18)</strong> Another good over from Anderson costs just three. He'll probably have one more because a wicket here could decide the match.</p> <p>\"Forfeit: Smyth to end every sentence, spoken or written, with 'LOL' for a year,\" says Tom Bowtell. \"LOL.\"</p> <!-- Block 73 --> <p><strong>10th over: South Africa 43-3 (target 183; Amla 17, de Villiers 19)</strong> Chris Woakes replaces Jade Dernbach. His first over goes for five and includes a good yorker that Amla digs out.</p> <p>\"I did indeed shave my beard off last year to raise money for Right To Work,\" says Keith Flett. \"In the end I got more money from people demanding I immediately grow it back....\"</p> <!-- Block 74 --> <p><strong>11th over: South Africa 44-3 (target 183; Amla 18, de Villiers 19)</strong> Morgan at point saves four when Amla clatters Anderson high to his right. One from the over. </p> <p>\"I remember it before it was the internet, when you had to be in the US armed forces or at a research university, to use Arpanet, then Janet (Joint Academic Network) and my first actual use was for Chemical Abstracts including all the formulae which were a real bugger, or the patent or legal databases, and esa-aerospace,\" says John Starbuck. \"Then the newspapers woke up and started going electronic and there were loads of competing systems. HTTP started (and so did laptops) in the very early 1990s. In 1996-97 we began getting proper search engines and the rubbish began, too.

The next ball is checked in the air but short of mid-on. Amla is clearly starting to feel the pressure, as he shows with a <em>stunning</em> back-foot cover drive for four. What a shot.</p> <p>\"Can't believe no-one's mentioned the bane of early internet geekery, the modem!\" says Alex Book. \"More specifically, the 1200 or 2400 baud modem (I never did find out what 'baud' was \u2013 all I know is that was bloody slow).

Dial-up! Text-based! Modem! I can imagine the day I try to explain to my infant son about any of this \u2013 his incomprehension will be absolute. Then again, to anyone with a life during their teenage years, it might have proved somewhat hard to explain anyway.\"</p> <!-- Block 76 --> <p><strong>13th over: South Africa 55-3 (target 183; Amla 28, de Villiers 20)</strong> The bald community's James Tredwell comes on to replace Jimmy Anderson, who bowled a classy spell of 6-2-19-2. His fourth ball turns a mile, pitching well outside off stump before spitting past Amla's left leg. Two from the over.</p> <!-- Block 77 --> <p><strong>14th over: South Africa 61-3 (target 183; Amla 29, de Villiers 25)</strong> A piece of rubbish from Woakes, short and leg stump, is whirled emphatically round the corner for four by de Villiers. He looks in great nick, as he has for most of the summer, even though he hasn't reached fifty in the internationals.</p> <!-- Block 78 --> <p><strong>15th over: South Africa 67-3 (target 183; Amla 34, de Villiers 27)</strong> Samit Patel replaces James Tredwell. Amla dances down the track to thrash a glorious cover drive for four.</p> <p>\"Hi Rob, I just finished my run,\" says Alex Netherton. \"It was actually seven and a half miles as I felt quite energetic. Probably due to my two lunches (one salt beef baguette and then a kedgeree a couple of hours later). For dinner I think I might have fishfingers, but already I've had a strawberry milkshake and a cereal bar as I was quite hungry when I got in. Tomorrow I think I'll have a smoothie for breakfast, and I'll be keeping the alarm set to 7.30, though I can't be sure I won't wake up before then! Again, not much to do with internet memories, but I am again sending this via the internet. I'll send another update when the cricket starts again in a bit.

England need a wicket here, and they almost get it when Amla, on the back foot, inside edges onto the pads. That could easily have hit the stumps.</p> <p>\"Alex Book reminded of something I miss about the early days of the internet,\" says Brad McMillan, \"namely hearing my mum say 'they're on the Internet again,' after finding my Grandparents' phone was engaged.\" Ha, I'd forgotten all about that.</p> <!-- Block 80 --> <p><strong>17th over: South Africa 76-3 (target 183; Amla 39, de Villiers 30)</strong> England are waiting for a mistake, which is understandable in the circumstances but also risky given the quality of these two batsmen. They can eschew risk and work the ball around for singles, as they do in that Patel over. There is a token run-out referral against de Villiers, but he was comfortably home. Five from the over.</p> <!-- Block 81 --> <p><strong>18th over: South Africa 82-3 (target 183; Amla 44, de Villiers 31)</strong> Amla is playing wonderfully. When Tredwell tries to tempt him with a bit of flight, Amla launches a gorgeous drive over mid-off for a one-bounce four.</p> <!-- Block 82 --> <p><strong>19th over: South Africa 85-3 (target 183; Amla 45, de Villiers 33)</strong> With England needing a wicket, it's a good move to bring Ravi Bopara into the attack. That is not a sentence that has ever been typed before. He has a <em>huge</em> LBW shout against de Villiers first ball that is turned down by Richard Illingworth. It might be going down leg but this is really close. I would have reviewed that, although Alastair Cook has decided not to do so. Alastair Cook is a wise man; it was swinging down leg side. The second ball goes the other way to beat de Villiers' outside edge. A good first over from the new George Lohmann.</p> <!-- Block 83 --> <p><strong>20th over: South Africa 87-3 (target 183; Amla 46, de Villiers 34)</strong> Amla miscues a couple of reverse sweeps off Tredwell.</p> <!-- Block 84 --> <p><strong>21st over: South Africa 90-3 (target 183; Amla 48, de Villiers 35)</strong> Bopara is getting some useful inswing, if gentle, and an LBW b Bopara is probably England's best chance of a wicket just now. Three from the over. South Africa need 93 from 29 overs.</p> <p>\"It must have been around 1978 when I was helping some techies test early communications via computers,\" says John Starbuck. \"They had invented a way of swapping screen images and modifying them but were stuck for something to use in our communications with the Open University, so I took the light-pen (as it wasn't then called) and drew a noughts &amp; crosses grid, with a cross in the centre. I won, but was this the first multi-player game?\"</p> <!-- Block 85 --> <p><strong>22nd over: South Africa 100-3 (target 183; Amla 49, de Villiers 44)</strong> England take the bowling Powerplay and go back to Dernbach. De Villiers leans into a drive that is in the air for a while but perfectly bisects extra cover and mid off before scooting away for four. The next ball is timed gloriously down the ground for four more. Those two shots were a thrilling snapshot of his exceptional talent.</p> <!-- Block 86 --> <p><strong>23rd over: South Africa 108-3 (target 183; Amla 50, de Villiers 50)</strong> Jimmy Anderson is back. This is the game, right now. England have to take a wicket. Amla pushes a single to reach another lovely fifty from 63 balls. His scores against England this summer are 311*, 9, 28, 13, 121, 150, 43, 45 and now 50*. At the moment he's actually being overshadowed by de Villiers, who is playing some sublime strokes. When Anderson overpitches, de Villiers times another straight drive for four, a shot so pristine you could eat your dinner off it. A single off the last ball takes him to a brilliant half-century, his first of the international summer, from only 54 balls.</p> <p>\"Keith Flett made the rookie mistake of failing to stipulate which part of your body you have avoid shaving,\" says Tom van der Gucht. \"When Amla wins this for SA you can duck out of growing a beard by claiming that you were referring to your armpits or feet!\" Hang on, so I have to do the forfeit even if I win the bet? Not even George Costanza would put up with that.</p> <!-- Block 87 --> <p><strong>24th over: South Africa 118-3 (target 183; Amla 55, de Villiers 51)</strong> Ten from Dernbach's over, none in boundaries.

Appointments at 2.30. Last time I went he said my teeth were OK but my gums might have to come out.\"</p> <!-- Block 89 --> <p><strong>26th over: South Africa 132-3 (target 183; Amla 60, de Villiers 60)</strong> De Villiers leading edges Woakes over point for two, a rare false stroke. This partnership has been a great example of mature, high-class batsmen not so much averting a crisis as ignoring it. Their experience allows them just to go out and play, whether the score is 14 for three or 140 for three, and they have calmly taken the game away from England. Kieswetter loses Tredwell's throw from the deep in the lights and, with Bopara daydreaming behind him, South Africa can steal an overthrow. South Africa have taken 42 runs from the bowling Powerplay.</p> <!-- Block 90 --> <p><strong>27th over: South Africa 138-3 (target 183; Amla 64, de Villiers 62)</strong> On Sky, Shane Warne says Alastair Cook has done a \"pretty good job\" as captain in this series. Coming from one of cricket's great lost captains, that's pretty high praise. Ian Bell at mid-on makes a great diving stop when Amla pushes Anderson to his left. That saved three runs, and that might just be the difference between a six-wicket defeat and a seven-wicket defeat.</p> <!-- Block 91 --> <p><strong>28th over: South Africa 141-3 (target 183; Amla 65, de Villiers 64)</strong> De Villiers survives a run-out referral after an excellent piece of work from the bowler Woakes, who raced de Villiers to the non-striker's end and broke the stumps with an underarm throw.</p> <p>\"Things are looking bad for England, but the Aussies let Pakistan beat them by 7 wickets (with 31 balls remaining) in the first T20 in UAE,\" says Sara Torvalds. \"So that's all to the good, right?\" Whisper it \u2013 ssssshhhhhh \u2013 but I've never really done the whole Australia schadenfreude thing. No idea why.</p> <!-- Block 92 --> <p><strong>29th over: South Africa 145-3 (target 183; Amla 68, de Villiers 65)</strong> Bopara on, Anderson off with fine but futile figures of 9-2-41-2. South Africa are coasting. </p> <p>\"If you're hungry, and nobody else can help you, and if you can find them (in your canteen), I strongly recommend Pepperami, specifically the red-packeted 'hot' variety,\" says Brad McMillan. \"I'm presently addicted, 2-3 per day, having replaced cigarettes with them last September. Not sure what the health police would have to say though.\" That sounds lovely, but aren't they \u2013 what's the phrase I'm looking for \u2013 absolutely disgusting?</p> <!-- Block 93 --> <p><strong>30th over: South Africa 149-3 (target 183; Amla 69, de Villiers 67)</strong> \"For supper I had boerewors, pap, gravy and peas and a small glass of red wine,\" says Simon Pamphilon. \"For pudding I had a mild heart attack, after the TV news reader said England were on the ropes all out for 182, and then, in passing, mentioned that we were 11 for 2 before cutting to the weather.

South Africa need 30 from 114 balls. \"'Send your emails in on any subject you like',\" says Phil Sawyer. Really? You really want to hear my well rehearsed rant about how Marvel Comics went so badly wrong with the Spider-Man 'One More Day' story line and how I've never forgiven them since? You really are desperate for emails. Almost as desperate as I am for human company following my room emptying rants about how Marvel Comics etc and so on.\" Man, I thought I was the only one.</p> <!-- Block 95 --> <p><strong>32nd over: South Africa 163-3 (target 183; Amla 80, de Villiers 70)</strong> For those who do enjoy Australia's misfortune, I think I'm right in saying that today's defeat drops them to 10th in the ICC T20 table \u2013 below not only Bangladesh but also Ireland. Tenth! Anyway, enough of that, there's cricket going on at Trent Bridge, and Amla has just blitzed an outrageous six over extra cover off Tredwell. He ran down the track to turn it into a half volley and then launched it all the way. This is now a record fourth-wicket partnership for South Africa against England in one-day cricket.</p> <p>\"The xx,\" says Dan Lucas. \"Anyone heard this yet? I was more entertained waiting for the iTunes updates to download than I was listening to it. Most boring band ever?\" Pretty much. Almost as boring as The Wire.</p> <!-- Block 96 --> <p><strong>33rd over: South Africa 176-3 (target 183; Amla 92, de Villiers 70)</strong> Amla is ending this in a hurry. He drives Dernbach for four, edges another to third man and then smashes a cut stroke for the third boundary of the over. This is lovely, selfless batting from Hashim Amla, who realises I have only one train an hour from St Pancras and wouldn't mind getting the 2055.</p> <p>\"Re: 24th over, it's ESPN, not Afghanistan, who've hired KP. But never say never when mercenaries are involved,\" says Eamonn Maloney. \"and re: 28th over, the reason that you don't 'do' Australia schadenfreude is probably that you're not a prick.\" Well...</p> <!-- Block 97 --> <p><strong>34.3 overs: South Africa 186-3 (Amla 97, de Villiers 75). SOUTH AFRICA WIN BY SEVEN WICKETS TO SQUARE THE SERIES 2-2</strong> Hasim Amla hits the winning boundary off Jade Dernbach. South Africa have <em>battered</em> England, with seven wickets and 93 balls to spare, and a slightly muted series ends 2-2. It's the right result. The remarkable Amla has averaged over 100 in both the Test and one-day series. Right here, right now, there is no better batsman on earth. The result ends England's run of seven consecutive one-day series wins at home, but they remain top of the rankings and, as I said at the start, that's all that matters. Thanks for your emails; see you for the first of three T20 internationals on Saturday.</p>",
  "<p>Fourteen years ago, around the time young Rimsha Masih, now in jail under Pakistan's blasphemy law, was born, a Roman Catholic bishop walked into a courthouse in Sahiwal, quite close to my hometown in Central Punjab. The Right Rev John Joseph was no ordinary clergyman; he was the first native bishop in Pakistan and the first ever Punjabi bishop anywhere in the world. He was also a brilliant and celebrated community organiser, the kind of man oppressed communities look up to as a role model. Joseph walked in alone, asking a junior priest to wait outside the courthouse. Inside the court, he took out a handgun and shot himself in the head. The bullet in his head was his protest against the court's decision to sentence a fellow Christian, Ayub Masih, to death for committing blasphemy. Masih had been charged with arguing with a Muslim co-worker over religious matters. The exact content of the conversation cannot be repeated here because that would be blasphemous. The bishop had campaigned long and hard to get the blasphemy law repealed without any luck. He wrote prior to his death: \"I shall count myself extremely fortunate if in this mission of breaking the barriers, our Lord accepts the sacrifice of my blood for the benefit of his people.\"</p> <p>Joseph had been pursuing another case, in which an 11-year-old, Salamat Masih, along with his father and uncle, was accused of scribbling something blasphemous on the wall of the mosque. We don't really know what he wrote, because reproducing it, here or in court, would constitute blasphemy.</p> <p>The boy's uncle, Manzoor Masih, was shot dead during the trial. The Masih case went to the high court, where a judge, Arif Bhatti, applied common sense and released him. A year later the judge was murdered in his own chambers, and his killers claimed that the judge had committed blasphemy by freeing those accused in the blasphemy case.</p> <p>Frustrated and in a fit of rage, the bishop meditated and reached the conclusion that he should kill himself publicly to make his point.</p> <p>You could argue that Joseph should have organised candlelight vigils, gone on a hunger strike, hired better lawyers. But he had tried everything and realised that a bullet in the head in the middle of a court was his only way to draw attention to this colossal absurdity called blasphemy law.</p> <p>He was wrong. The law stayed. Many more Christians were killed.</p> <p>There are situations though, where confronted with the prospect of a 14-year-old being sentenced to death, as a celebrated community leader you can't do anything but take a gun to your head.</p> <p>And hope for the best.</p> <p><strong>How to commit blasphemy in Pakistan</strong></p> <p>A young girl carrying trash in a plastic bag in a slum in the capital of Pakistan is not likely to arouse much curiosity. Not unless the girl is a Christian. Not unless there is a Muslim boy who wants to inspect the contents of her bag. Then this certain young man, Hammad, takes the trash bag to the local mosque to show it to the imam, Hafiz Mohammed Khalid Chishti (also known as Maulana Jadoon), who decides that the contents of the bag are, indeed, blasphemous but wonders if they are blasphemous enough. So he inserts some pages of the Qur'an in the trash bag. What the girl was carrying was a book of alphabets, taught to children, may or may not have had a verse from the Qur'an in it. Reproducing an image of the contents of this trash bag would be blasphemous, so we are never likely to know. We discover the imam's role in sexing up the blasphemous contents two weeks later when one of the imam's deputies cracks up. By then Rimsha has been arrested, refused bail, sent to jail and a medical board constituted to ascertain her age and mental health. We are still not sure if she is 11 or 14, we don't know if she has Down's Syndrome as was originally claimed. In the initial days of the case, human-rights workers pinned their hopes on Rimsha's mental condition. As if those who demanded her arrest, those who arrested her, those who denied her bail and put her in jail were all mentally \"normal\". Her family has gone into hiding; another 300 Christian families have been forced to leave their homes and are struggling to find shelter in one of the Islamabad forests.</p> <p>So what can constitute blasphemy under the blasphemy law, which has killed dozens in the past decade, made thousands homeless and millions live in permanent fear about what might be found in their trashcan. It's up to the lawyers to argue over how to avoid: \"Whoever by words, either spoken or written or by visible representation, or by any imputation, innuendo, or insinuation, directly or indirectly, defiles \u2026\" but here are some of the everyday situations that can turn you into a blasphemer:</p> <p><strong>1. </strong>Transporting ashes in a plastic bag to a rubbish dump, as has happened in Masih's case.</p> <p><strong>2. </strong>Discussing conjugal rights according to Islam with fellow Muslims if you disagree with them. You might think you are with a fellow Muslim, around a water pump and relatively safe. That is what a schoolteacher in Chakwal thought. And got into an argument. He has been in jail for the past 10 months. His 14-year-old daughter told the daily newspaper Dawn last week that kids won't talk to her because her father is a blasphemer.</p> <p><strong>3.</strong> Not minding your spellings. Last year a teacher checking exam papers called in the police after he found blasphemous material in an answer sheet. The police wouldn't reveal the exact material because that, you know, would be blasphemous. Later it transpired that it was a case of bad spelling.</p> <p><strong>4.</strong> Writing a novel called Blasphemy. Last year there were calls to put an author on trial because she had been disrespectful to religious scholars and spiritual saints. Last I heard she was fine but not writing any more novels with any other name.</p> <p><strong>5. </strong>Writing a children's poem with a lion as its central character. Pakistan's most famous social activist, Akhtar Hameed Khan, who spent his life helping people in Asia's largest slum, tried his hand at a poem like that and spent his last years in courts facing blasphemy charges.</p> <p><strong>6.</strong> Refusing someone a drink of water. Asia Bibi, a Christian woman, who among other blasphemous things (which can't be repeated for reasons by now obvious to the readers of this article) refused her co-workers a drink of water. The local imam accused her of blasphemy. The then governor, Salman Taseer, came out in her support, talked about changing the law, and was killed by his own police bodyguard. The policeman's picture adorns many shops and businesses in Pakistan. Taseer's name has become synonymous with \"going too far\". And nobody, really nobody, wants to mention Bibi's name in a discussion about blasphemy law.</p> <p><strong>7. </strong>Throwing away a visiting card. A doctor in Hyderabad did that to a pestering pharmaceutical salesman and found himself in serious trouble. The salesman had Muhammad as part of his name.</p> <p><strong>Blasphemy: a children's story</strong></p> <p>An academic subject called Islamic Studies was made compulsory for all students in the early 80s. As a student you were taught a story about the prophet Muhammad's life. It was part of Muslim folklore, repeated over and over again in Friday sermons, and told to little kids as a bedtime story. When the prophet started preaching in Mecca, there was a lot of hostility towards him. People pelted him with stones, made fun of him and his new upstart God and his teachings. There was one woman in his Mecca neighbourhood who was particularly nasty to him. As he left his house every day, she would be waiting for him with a basket of garbage that she would empty over him. It happened day after day but he never rebuked the woman, nor changed his path. Then one day he walked the street and no garbage was thrown at him. He turned back and went looking for his tormentor and discovered that the woman was ill and bedridden. He inquired about her health and told her that since she hadn't come out to insult him like she did every day, he was worried about her. The woman, impressed by his generosity, converted to Islam.</p> <p>There is another story that kids are taught these days. This story has almost become the new folklore, repeated endlessly on social networking sites and narrated in graphic detail by the supporters of the blasphemy law. According to this story when prophet Muhammad conquered Mecca he announced a general amnesty except for those who had committed blasphemy against his person. He ordered them to be beheaded. One blasphemer was killed even when he tried to take shelter in the Khana Qaba in Mecca, the most sacred place for Muslims, where it is strictly forbidden to kill anyone.</p> <p>A common Muslim might be puzzled over how both these stories could be true? But before puzzlement starts to border on blasphemy, one must seek the guidance of Pakistani Islamic scholars, who tell us that Islam is the most humane of religions, that there is nothing wrong with the blasphemy law, that it is the implementation which is problematic. Before the current law came into existence, in 60 years there were six reported cases of blasphemy. Since the current law was constituted there have been more than four thousand. But the law has such power that even pleading the statistics is considered blasphemous. When Governor Taseer challenged it, they killed him, and then many of the same Islamic scholars refused to say his funeral prayers.</p> <p><strong>The fear of Allah v the fear of mullah</strong></p> <p>Not too long ago, the role of the clergy in a neighbourhood was confined to birth and deaths, funeral and special religious occasions. You went to the mosque to offer your prayers, you prayed for better crops, for the rains to start or stop; travellers could expect to find shelter for the night. A mosque is no more just that. Equipped with a powerful public-address system and controlled by sectarian religious groups, it's become a little battle headquarter for the neighbourhood. The continuous Shia massacres across Pakistan are not hatched in some far-off land, by enemies of Pakistan or enemies of Islam as Pakistan's maulanas pretend; they are preached, planned and executed from local mosques.</p> <p>People listen to religious scholars.</p> <p>\"If she is innocent, she should be released,\" thundered a dozen maulanas on TV screens after Rimsha was arrested. \"And if she is guilty, the law must take its course.\" They completely ignored the fact that an illiterate child is not likely to even know what constitutes blasphemy. And the law they want to be implemented has led to a situation that even when the accused is found innocent, they are condemned for life.</p> <p>All you need to do to condemn someone for life is to switch on a mosque loudspeaker and make the allegation. Before Chishti was caught in his own trap in the Rimsha case, no accuser had ever been arrested or tried. The laws against hate speech are weak, and almost never implemented. And how can it be considered hate speech when all they are doing is expressing their faith that might include demanding death for all Shias and Ahmedis, and an occasional Christian who may or may not have crossed the line.</p> <p>There are enough sectarian organisations in Pakistan to wage perpetual war. There are enough factions within these organisations that will shoot down every argument, every appeal to rationality. You can't reason with Allah, so you mustn't reason with a mullah, because that too might be blasphemous.</p> <p>A few days before it was found that Chishti had planted evidence against Rimsha, he was interviewed on TV. He was asked if he had been campaigning to expel Christians from his neighbourhood. He seemed puzzled for a moment, then rebuked: \"This is a Muslim country, Allah has given it to us. If these Christians make noise at the time of our prayers, then they should be asked to leave.\" I am certain that even when Chishti was stuffing pages from the Qur'an in the poor girl's trash bag, he believed he was doing Allah's work.</p> <p><strong>The Christian work</strong></p> <p>There is a well-off Christian businessman in Karachi who fusses over the trash basket in his office, handles his work file carefully, because, you never know, a stray scrap of paper can ruin you, your family, your business.</p> <p>Christians make up less than 2% of Pakistanis, the majority of them very poor. Many of them are converts from low caste Hindus, who embraced Christianity in the hope of better status, but most end up sweeping the streets and cleaning clogged up gutters. Because of rampant unemployment the sanitary profession is not exclusive to Christians any more \u2013 there are thousands of Muslims, mostly migrants from rural areas, who sweep the streets and haul the trash but because of old prejudices, it's still considered a profession beneath Muslims. The Christian businessman in Karachi was hiring a cleaning person for his office and inquired about his background. The candidate told him: my family comes from farming but because of bad times we are forced to do this Christian work.</p> <p><strong>My father, the blasphemer</strong></p> <p>My father was as devout and zealous a Muslim as I have ever seen. Never missed a prayer, built a huge mosque in his village and always preferred the stricter, literalist version of religion. He also had a mysterious stomach ailment and the only cure was a verse from the Qur'an recited by the only Christian gentleman in the neighbourhood. This accidental healer was also the neighbourhood sweeper. When I think of these two old men huddled in a room, reciting verses from the Qur'an to cure a minor ailment, I wonder if they were committing blasphemy?</p> <p><strong>Rimsha's future</strong></p> <p>For the first time since the Right Rev John Joseph shot himself, there is some public support for a blasphemy victim. Some religious scholars have come out in Rimsha's support, an odd politician or two have talked about this case becoming a tipping point in the blasphemy debate. But let's not have any illusions: no political party has the courage to rewrite a single word in the law let alone repeal it. The 11-year-old Salamat Masih who Joseph had fought for was sentenced to death. A higher court later overturned the decision but it was obvious the boy would never be safe in the country. A Christian charity helped him find asylum in Europe.</p> <p>Rimsha (if found not guilty) has been offered sanctuary by one of the country's largest seminaries, Jamia Banuria, in Karachi. Banuria is also a staunch supporter of the blasphemy law. Rimsha probably doesn't know that she might end up spending the rest of her life in a Muslim seminary or be left at the mercy of a Christian charity.</p> <p>In Joseph's hometown in Faisalabad, in a Muslim seminary called Jamia Rehmania, they made a monument to his sacrifice. Jamia Rehmania also supports the blasphemy law. The memorial, called Bishop John Joseph Memorial Hall is the only monument in Pakistan dedicated to a blasphemer.</p>",

He continues to be in British territory in the widest sense.\"</p> <p>Celebrity backers of Assange \u2013 believed to include Jemima Khan, film directors Ken Loach and Michael Moore, and millionaire publisher Felix Dennis \u2013 have already lost \u00a3200,000 in bail money they put up for the WikiLeaks founder.</p> <p>At a hearing at Westminster magistrates court on Tuesday, district judge Howard Riddle <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/sep/04/julian-assange-backers-lose-bail\" title=\"\">adjourned a further hearing</a> until October to decide whether nine other backers should also lose their money, after Assange fled an attempt to extradite him to Sweden in June.</p> <p>The Spanish jurist, best-known internationally for his attempt to have former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet extradited from the UK, also said there was no contradiction between his defence of Assange and his own use of international extradition agreements in the past.</p> <p>\"I asked for the extradiction of Pinochet, who had been investigated and charged with \u2026 genocide, torture, serious breaches of human rights,\" said Garzon. \"Assange is having a fundamental right breached too \u2014 freedom of expression \u2014 and that is why he has been granted political asylum.\"</p> <p>Assange'sc defence team have said the Australian offered to be questioned in Sweden when the allegations were first made, was given permission by prosecuting lawyers to leave the country and has subsequently repeatedly offered to be questioned in the UK.</p> <p>\"We are in a position to demonstration that no criminal act has been committed and the allegations are inconsistent,\" Garzon said, adding that it was unusual for countries to use a European Arrest Warrant to bring someone in for questioning when no charges had been brought.</p> <p>Garzon said the defence team intended to make an explicit request to the US to say whether any case was open against Assange or WikiLeaks. \"I can tell you that they won't reply. If they do, terrific \u2013 we want to show that the US is hiding what is happening to Julian Assange.\"</p>",
  "<p>Not long ago, Frances O'Grady was leafing through some old union pamphlets, created by car industry workers in the 1970s. Her father was a shop steward at the British Leyland car plant in Cowley back then, when the company was synonymous with <a href=\"http://www.oxfordmail.co.uk/archive/2011/06/16/Features+(otfeatures)/9081181.Recalling_turbulent_times/\" title=\"\">industrial unrest</a>, <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/4294709.stm\" title=\"\">mass walkouts</a>, furious disputes between a <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/18/business/economy/18car.html?pagewanted=all\" title=\"\">failing management</a> and the <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/693309.stm\" title=\"\">union</a>. The workers were sometimes publicly denegrated.</p> <p>But in a 1978 pamphlet, the extent of their interest in innovation and the strength of their ideas was clear. \"There was this whole section about how the Japanese were working on a prototype for an electric car,\" she says, and the workers suggested the British car industry invest in developing its own, citing, among other arguments, the environmental benefits. The suggestion was apparently ignored. \"Imagine if somebody had listened to them 30 years ago,\" says O'Grady. \"Britain could have been a market leader.\"</p> <p>Stories such as this stoke her belief in workers being given a proper voice in their industries. \"Because working people have a lot of intelligence and ideas and imagination and vision.\" I snort loudly, involuntarily, at this, then apologise. It's not that I disagree \u2013 not at all \u2013 just that it suddenly seems so ridiculous that it should still be necessary to make this case. Of course you're better off harnessing the ideas of your whole workforce, rather than a tiny number of&#xa0;people at the top, who often have very similar backgrounds, outlooks and intimacies.</p> <p>O'Grady laughs uproariously too. She has worked for the unions for more than two decades, and has the ready laughter of a seasoned campaigner, whose sense of humour has kept her going. \"But there's something very deeply held, isn't there,\" she says, \"that somehow one little group of people, whether it's in politics or business, has all the answers \u2026 Ordinary people who have lots of good ideas want more than a suggestion box, and they need a union to represent that thinking.\"</p> <p>This coming week, O'Grady's mission to give workers a voice reaches its height as she becomes the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/jul/10/frances-ogrady-tuc-general-secretary\" title=\"\">general secretary designate</a> of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/tuc\" title=\"\">Trade Union Congress</a> \u2013 the <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-18772379\" title=\"\">first woman</a> to be elected leader in the TUC's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/jul/11/tuc-leader-frances-ogrady-challenge\" title=\"\">144-year history</a>. She takes over officially from <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/brendan-barber\" title=\"\">Brendan Barber</a> at the end of the year, heading a body that represents <a href=\"http://www.tuc.org.uk/tuc/unions_main.cfm\" title=\"\">54 trade unions</a>, with nearly 6.5 million members, almost half of whom are women. Elected unopposed, her appointment has been hailed as the end of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/aug/05/women-changing-union-movement-tuc\" title=\"\">\"male, pale and stale\"</a> era of union leaders, a progressive, none-too-soon step forward.</p> <p>At the start of our interview, I'm not quite sure what to make of O'Grady. When I ask about the three highest priorities for union members, her answer is wide-ranging \u2013 touching on austerity, a stimulus package, decent jobs, dead-end jobs, unpaid internships, bogus training schemes, growing inequality and stagnating living standards. All the right noises, all slightly waffly. Thankfully, it's a blip. O'Grady passes that classic politician's test \u2013 would you want to have a drink with them? \u2013 with distinction, while also being pointed and clever.</p> <p>She'll need to be. Her appointment comes at a time when union numbers <a href=\"http://www.bis.gov.uk/assets/biscore/employment-matters/docs/t/12-p77-trade-union-membership-2011.pdf\" title=\"\">are in year-on-year decline</a>; the ranks of paid-up members have halved from their <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2010/apr/30/union-membership-data\" title=\"\">13 million peak</a> in the late 70s. Yet arguments around employment rights and treatment of workers are more contentious than ever, with new employment scandals each week, from <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-19263787\" title=\"\">zero-hours contracts</a> to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/feb/28/workfare-uk-plot-job-snobs\" title=\"\">\"workfare\"</a> to the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/mar/19/minimum-wage-frozen-for-under-21s\" title=\"\">freezing of the minimum wage</a> for young people. A group of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/aug/17/tory-backbenchers-urge-welfare-reforms\" title=\"\">ambitious Tory MPs</a> recently claimed <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/aug/22/britannia-unchained-rise-of-new-tory-right\" title=\"\">\"the British are among the worst idlers in the world\"</a>; a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/law/2012/may/22/vince-cable-tory-plan-sacking-workers?INTCMP=ILCNETTXT3487\" title=\"\">report</a> by Tory donor Adrian Beecroft proposed making it easier to sack employees without explanation; and last year it was reported that David Cameron's former policy honcho, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2011/jul/28/steve-hilton-policies-coalition-split\" title=\"\">Steve Hilton</a>, had suggested abolishing maternity leave altogether. The sharpness of the arguments is clear on one of the first pages of the <a href=\"http://www.tuc.org.uk/the_tuc/tuc-21274-f0.cfm\" title=\"\">TUC's preliminary agenda</a>, the document that presents possible motions for debate. One statement reads: \"Congress believes that increasing unemployment, and particularly youth unemployment, is a deliberate policy aim of this government.\"</p> <p>Where does she stand on that? O'Grady emphasises that these are just potential motions. \"But there was certainly a strong view in the 1980s, not just among trade unions, but also among a number of intellectuals and commentators, that unemployment was being used as a deliberate measure to keep pay down, and to keep people scared. As long as the number one worry for people, keeping them up at nights, is whether they're going to have a job in the morning, then they are less likely to resist unfair changes, or unfair treatment, or cuts in real pay at work. So there's a fair bit of evidence to suggest it can be a deliberate policy. And I think we do legitimately have to ask why the government isn't taking action to create decent employment for young people, when the evidence is that if you <em>don't</em> do that, you really are going to pay a very high price.\"</p> <p>This isn't the only area where O'Grady suspects there may be ideological forces at work. We talk about the increasingly <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/feedarticle/10242141\" title=\"\">temporary, part-time</a> nature of the labour market, which has created a workforce that's much more difficult to unionise. \"If you were very cynical,\" she says, \"you might think it was a deliberate strategy.\" Then there's the evidence that women are bearing the brunt of the recession, with women's unemployment reaching a 25-year high earlier in 2012. \"You'd be forgiven for thinking that this was part of a back-to-the-kitchen-sink campaign,\" she says. \"When you look at what's happening, with women being hit hardest by job losses, service cuts, threats to take away employment rights, pay depression, rising bills and lack of childcare \u2026 You could be forgiven for thinking that there is a plan here.\"</p> <p>Now 52, her work in the union movement began at the Transport and General Workers Union, on campaigns for a national minimum wage and equal pay for women, before she moved to the TUC in the mid-90s. It's now more than 40 years since <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/oct/02/made-in-dagenham-a-feminist-view\" title=\"\">the Ford sewing machinists' strike</a>, which led to the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2011/mar/08/four-decades-on-equal-pay-yet-to-come\" title=\"\">Equal Pay Act</a>, yet the pay gap between men and women persists. O'Grady says tackling this has to remain a priority, not just for women, but for all workers. \"I think people understand that as long as working people can be divided up, we're weaker. So it's important for all of us to tackle unfairness, so we can't be divided, one against the other, and actually that applies as much to agency workers, to migrant workers who are often on agency contracts, [who are] paid below the rates. People understand that actually it's not the worker who's the problem,\" she says, \"it's exploitation.\"</p> <p>O'Grady is the youngest of five siblings. Did that give her a feeling for the underdog, the sense she had to shout loudly for recognition? \"Oh, I think we all had to, to be fair,\" she says. \"Small house, big family.\" She has three older sisters and one older brother. The four girls had to share a bedroom, while their brother had another. I commiserate, and she quickly corrects me. \"The house was effectively two bedrooms, with literally a box room that took my brother's bed, which he sometimes had to share with my grandad. So I think we got the better end of the bargain!\"</p> <p>She was put up a year at school, and went to Milham Ford comprehensive in Oxford, where she had \"a bit of a gob\" on her, she says. At the same time, in her late teens, she entered the workplace for the first time, with a job at Marks &amp; Spencer. Even though the company did not recognise unions, she joined one. \"I think it was about self-respect, and feeling that we had a right to a voice.\"</p> <p>She worked at a newsagents at the weekend, where the papers gave her a political education, and then started doing a couple of evenings of silver-service waitressing each week at the Oxford colleges. She was soon pulled off this shift \u2013 if she hadn't mutinied already, it sounds like this was imminent. \"It is a great education [working at] Oxford and I'm sure Cambridge too, in that you're exposed to elites that you maybe wouldn't get to see in other places. The thing that really struck me was that I knew I had a brain in my head, and of course, like the entire family, I have strong opinions. You'd get the chance, serving people, to listen in on these conversations, and in some ways you're desperate to put in your two penn'orth. But, also, you know that you are absolutely invisible to them.</p> <p>\"That's why, you know, some of our&#xa0;unions have run these campaigns organising cleaners at Canary Wharf, and elsewhere, and one of the demands has been that the boss should smile at the cleaner. So yes, provide a living wage \u2026\" But also acknowledge the person? \"Exactly. And I think that's really important. I think it's actually probably one of the most subversive demands to put, because it says: treat me like a human being.\"</p> <p>A teacher encouraged her to go to&#xa0;university, and she headed to Manchester, to study history and politics. While there, she became a feminist \u2013 still is \u2013 and went clubbing regularly at new wave venues. It was the end of the 70s, \"a very exciting time, and then, bang, into the 80s, and that was like having a bucket of cold water thrown over everybody \u2026 Suddenly it's back to who you know, and mass unemployment and unions as the enemy within. I fear there are some now, in the backwaters, who'd like to replay that, on the right.\"</p> <p>She had a series of dead-end jobs, including peeling buckets of onions in&#xa0;a fast-food joint, before moving to London and getting into the voluntary sector. Soon she was working in the union movement, while bringing up her two children \u2013 a daughter and a&#xa0;son&#xa0;\u2013 as a single mother.</p> <p>Now, as TUC leader, she wants to build \"a mass movement, a social movement as well as a trade union movement and, particularly for young people, I think we have to offer a home\". She says Ed Miliband, as Labour leader, has been asking the right questions, but needs to go beyond that. \"He's set out themes \u2013 such as responsible capitalism, living standards, a new way of doing politics \u2013 that resonate with ordinary working people. The people I talk to, going around the country, now have an appetite to hear what the answers are. Because I don't think people will be content with a bit of make-do-and-mend. I think people are looking for something that addresses the root causes of the crash and offers them some hope for the future.\"</p> <p>Is there anything she thinks the coalition government is doing particularly well? She pauses, and erupts with laughter. \"How long have I got to think this one through? Of course there are areas where we have constructive engagement, and our job is to represent working people, so we want a constructive relationship \u2026 But the big picture is that they're pursuing a programme of cuts that is dragging the country down and isn't working, and they urgently need to change course.\" She refers to the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/mar/14/osborne-austerity-270000-public-sector-jobs\" title=\"\">270,000</a> public-sector job losses last year, with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/mar/25/public-sector-workforce-shrink-record-low-2017\" title=\"\">700,000</a> expected to go, in total, during this current parliament. \"Critically important jobs, from the Border Agency to care services to nurses and doctors. This is self-harm on a massive scale.\"</p> <p>The TUC had a protest against coalition cuts last year, and around <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/blog/2011/mar/26/march-for-the-alternative-live-updates\" title=\"\">500,000 </a>people came out. Another protest is planned for <a href=\"http://afuturethatworks.org/\" title=\"\">20 October</a>. O'Grady says she hopes this will send \"a strong message that the great majority of people have lost faith in the government's approach to deficit reduction. I&#xa0;mean, it's plain for all to see. We've got the first double-dip recession since the 70s, the biggest squeeze on living standards since the 20s \u2026 It isn't working, but it's going beyond saying it&#xa0;isn't working to saying, here are some practical alternatives. And I don't care whether you call it a plan A or a&#xa0;plan B. I don't care. I understand people sometimes need to save faces,\" she says firmly, \"but this is too important to play politics with.\"</p>",

  "<p>Louisiana is investigating whether tar balls deposited on Gulf of Mexico beaches by Hurricane Isaac were relics of the 2010 BP oil disaster.</p> <p>Government agencies and environmental groups this week reported weathered oil in areas which took the brunt of last week's hurricane \u2013 and which were also heavily damaged by the 4.9m barrel gusher from BP's leaking oil well.</p> <p>\"I'd say there is a smoking gun,\" Garrett Graves, the coastal adviser to Louisiana's governor Bobby Jindal, told news organisations. \"It's an area that experienced heavy oiling during the spill.\"</p> <p>State officials shut down commercial fishing and all shrimping in a 13-mile stretch from Port Fourchon to Caminada Pass, after observing tar mats and high concentration of tar balls on beaches.</p> <p>The Gulf Restoration Network, which has been touring the aftermath of Isaac by air and boat this week, said crew had reported 109 dead pelican in the wake of the storm and oil in a number of locations on the Louisiana and Mississippi coasts.</p> <p>\"We saw a fair amount of oil sheen and fresh tar balls at Ship Island, one of the Mississippi barrier islands,\" said Aaron Viles, a spokesman for the coalition of environmental groups. \"The storm really delivered a shock to the ecosystem, and we are seeing BP oil showing up again and we are seeing, unfortunately, real impacts to an ecosystem still struggling to recover.\"</p> <p>The Gulf network had repeatedly warned that powerful storms risked dredging up oil that had been purposely sunk to the ocean floor, by the use of chemical dispersants in the wake of the BP oil spill.</p> <p>\"When a storm system comes through it re-exposes oil that has settled to the bottom or was buried under sediment, and that newly re-exposed oil is showing up in places that had a lot of oil during the BP spill,\" Viles said.</p> <p>The oil company said the high number of offshore rigs in the Gulf of Mexico made it impossible to tie the tar mats to the runaway BP well without comprehensive testing.</p> <p>The US coastguard is investigating about 90 reported cases of oil and chemical leaks following Isaac, including suspected leaks from offshore platforms and a vacated storage terminal at Myrtle Grove.</p> <p>Environmental groups have warned of damage to wetlands and a citrus grove from an oil spill from a Conoco Phillips refinery in Plaquemines Parish, which took a battering in Isaac.</p> <p>There was also a chemical release in Braithwaite, where two people were killed in flooding.</p> <p>The coastguard has sent oil samples to it lab in Connecticut for testing, officials said.</p> <p>BP said in its statement that it would be \"premature\" to draw any conclusions about the sources of the oil before tests came back.</p> <p>\"It is important to fingerprint the residual oil to determine its origin.

She was briefly a member of the Labour party before becoming the Conservative party's first black female MP.

  "<p>Michael Owen regards football as a vocation but remains resolutely unsentimental about the game which has shaped his life. This paradox disturbs those fans, and some managers, who suspect the former England striker is not sufficiently in love with his profession.</p> <p>Perhaps Owen's biggest problem is that he is not a hypocrite. A man who claims \"I was born to score goals\" does not bother to disguise his belief that there is more to life than hitting the back of the net. As he once said: \"Scoring gives you a 10 second buzz but I would not describe it as joyful.\"</p> <p>Such rare honesty sometimes obscures the pride and understated pleasure Stoke City's new striker derives from his craft while diminishing the determination and professionalism of a player who has recovered from the sort of serious injuries and major surgeries which have ended many other careers.</p> <p>To his critics, though, the 32-year-old's willingness to spend the past three seasons as very much a fringe player at Manchester United somehow offered confirmation that he was more interested in funding his racing stables than starting matches.</p> <p>Until last year, the nearest anyone had ever come to spotting a tear in Owen's eye was when his wife, Louise, was pictured crying at St James' Park shortly after he joined Newcastle United from Real Madrid in 2005.</p> <p>Then, last summer, Brown Panther, not only one of Owen's beloved racehorses but the offspring of an adored family pet, won the King George V Stakes at Ascot and, suddenly, a striker infamous for his ice cold detachment could not stop sobbing. \"No, I have never cried after scoring a goal,\" he agreed later. \"But racing is my passion, I am so keen. It's a different thing to win with a horse bred from a mare which is a family pet. My kids pat her every morning and love her so much.\"</p> <p>Those words grated with many Newcastle fans who noted Owen's failure to engage with both them and the wider north-eastern community during that largely ill-starred spell on Tyneside. If frequently commuting to his home \u2013 within easy reach of those stables \u2013 in Cheshire by helicopter constituted a minor public relations disaster, at least he was not as disingenuous as certain team-mates whose protestations of love for \"The Toon\" soon rang horribly hollow.</p> <p>Moreover, by then, students of Owen's history would surely have forgiven him a slightly cynical streak. As the teenager who scored \"that goal\" against Argentina in the 1998 World Cup he had contended with England's manager Glenn Hoddle telling the press he was \"not a natural goalscorer\".</p> <p>Back home at Liverpool his blistering change of pace and uncanny penalty area precision won countless games but Owen still found himself rotated with Emile Heskey by G\u00e9rard Houllier. As he entered his 20s and his hamstrings began feeling the strain of possibly playing too many matches too young a worrying search for treatments took him to that Mecca of hobbling stars, the Munich clinic of Hans M\u00fcller-Wohlfahrt.</p> <p>A depressing cycle of regular injuries, operations and rehabilitation had begun and, partly with Owen's physical frailties in mind, Rafael Ben\u00edtez sold his star striker to Real Madrid.</p> <p>Owen has, intriguingly, revealed that, preferring to deal in \"facts\" and \"reality\", he struggles to read fiction or watch dramas on television and this lack of imagination arguably saw him treat his time in Spain as a business transaction rather than a great adventure.</p> <p>Yet, if he failed to learn the language properly, embrace the culture or even put Ronaldo (the Brazilian one) or Ra\u00fal in their places, he still scored 18 goals in 41 appearances, despite starting only 15 games.</p> <p>Playing under six managers in four years at Newcastle might have made a football romantic a little sceptical but Owen's cause was most harmed by the cruciate ligament tear he sustained playing for England in the opening minutes of the 2006 World Cup in Germany.</p> <p>When, shortly afterwards, the scale of the injury was confirmed Owen texted his then club manager, Glenn Roeder, to apologise for the inconvenience. The subsequent operation necessitated an allograft \u2013 the transplant of a tendon from a dead man \u2013 and took a year to recover from, during which time Owen supplemented his Newcastle training by working privately with John Green, a respected athletics coach.</p> <p>Despite an enduring knack of scoring on his increasingly rare appearances for Manchester United, it has long been evident that Green's best efforts failed to restore Owen's old sprinter's pace, dictating he is no longer best deployed lurking off the last defender's shoulder.</p> <p>If Fabio Capello called time prematurely on the international career of a striker boasting 40 England goals and 89 caps, Tony Pulis may be best advised to use Owen in an attacking midfield role at Stoke. As he has conceded himself, he can no longer \"pull defences all over the park\". Moreover, as Kevin Keegan discovered four years ago at Newcastle, Owen excels linking play in \"the hole\".</p> <p>As England coach, Keegan had seemed to prefer Andy Cole but he soon changed his mind about Owen. \"I didn't realise how good Michael is,\" he said. \"Playing deeper, Michael can keep the ball all day, see a pass and know when to release it. He'll get more scoring chances from deep and I think that, as a midfielder, he can play until he's 36 or 37.\"</p> <p>While Owen should prosper pouncing on knockdowns from Stoke's Peter Crouch and Kenwyne Jones and fastening on to the sort of crosses he has always relished scoring from, the sole note of caution is that Pulis's recent attempt to play Tuncay in a linking \"hole\" role proved an unmitigated disaster. Owen, though, is a far better finisher than the talented Turk.</p> <p>If the former's fitness record and wage demands understandably deterred several managers, it still seems slightly startling that Stoke were Owen's sole serious suitors. Or that, despite his acute striker shortage, Liverpool's Brendan Rodgers was so quick to dismiss the idea of signing him. Most astonishing of all was that, on Monday, one of the finest forwards of his generation tweeted a picture of his boots accompanied by the words: \"The tools of my trade are stacked and ready to go.\"</p> <p>Is Owen \u2013 the subject of a glossy 32-page advertising brochure dreamt up by his management company before joining Manchester United \u2013 a striker we will only start fully appreciating once he finally retires?</p>",
  "<p><strong>BG</strong> came under pressure after talk of a share placing went round the market.</p> <p>Traders said Deutsche Bank had placed 41m shares at \u00a312.25 each, although BG refused to comment on \"market speculation.\" Meanwhile analysts at Jefferies cut their target price on BG from \u00a320 to \u00a318 to reflect concerns about its Brazil businesses:</p> <blockquote> BG's Brazil exposure is creating a conundrum. By 2020, Brazil will account for around 40% of BG's production. We believe BG either needs to achieve scale and significance, or take some value off the table. Outside of doing nothing, we continue to see BG with ultimately two decisions relating to its growing pre-salt Brazil production exposure. Either BG needs to divest some Brazil exposure and crystallise value, or we also explore the potential of BG merging or acquiring to create a larger, more capable organisation. </blockquote> <p>The gases group closed 50p lower at \u00a312.21 in another uncertain day for the market.</p> <p>Investors were not keen to commit themselves ahead of Thursday's European Central Bank meeting, which is due to unveil plans to buy government bonds to support struggling eurozone countries such as Spain and Italy. Some details of the plan emerged during the day, but this did little to dispel the cautious mood.</p> <p>So the <strong>FTSE 100</strong> finished 14.15 points lower at 5657.86, its second day of decline. Tuesday's poor US manufacturing figures raised further fears of a continuing slowdown in the global economy, as did slightly worse than expected Australian growth data. Added to the prospect of weaker demand from China, that put more pressure on the mining sector, despite analysts at Bernstein beginning coverage on a number of companies with an outperform rating. These include <strong>Rio Tinto</strong>, 4p lower at \u00a327.18, and <strong>BHP Billiton</strong>, down 48.5p to 1778.5p. BHP shares also went ex-dividend.</p> <p><strong>Lonmin</strong> lost another 35p to 529.5p as striking South African miners marched near its Marikana mine, where 34 protestors were shot dead by police last month. There was talk it might need to raise $1.25bn in a rights issue.</p> <p><strong>BP</strong> fell 12.75p to 423.85p as <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2012/sep/05/deepwater-horizon-us-bp-oil-spill\" title=\"\">the US justice department took a strong position against the company regarding the Gulf of Mexico oil spill in 2010</a>.</p> <p>With relatively little in the way of corporate news, a number of broker comments had an effect on share prices. <strong>Wolseley</strong> rose 58p to \u00a326.20 after JP Morgan Cazenove issued an overweight recommendation on the building materials group:</p> <blockquote> JP Morgan's US strategy team argues that we remain in the early stages of a 3- to 5-year up-cycle in US residential construction. We believe the same is true of the Wolseley investment case; while the stock is up 21% year to date and 69% year on year, we still see significant value, based on 1) its US market exposure, which we estimate could provide more than 13% upside to 2014 earnings per share, 2) a potential capital return announcement near-term; even on our base-case estimates we believe there is scope to buy back almost a third of the market cap over three years, 3) ongoing self-help could provide further mid-single-digit upside, and 4) the valuation remains undemanding. </blockquote> <p><strong>BT</strong> was 1.1p better at 222.4p after the same broker has moved its recommendation from neutral to overweight, and raised its price target from 240p to 250p. Analyst Carl Murdock-Smith said:</p> <blockquote> We upgrade BT due to the relative attraction we see versus European incumbents. We believe BT's forecast risk is lower than the sector's, given its exposure to the UK, fixed-line, its lack of exposure to spectrum auctions, and as its fibre rollout plans are already well known and in forecasts (with early proof of monetisation). </blockquote> <p><strong>Lloyds Banking Group</strong> was lifted 1.04p to 33.93p by a SocGen buy note, while among the mid-caps, Argos owner <strong>Home Retail Group</strong> added 1.75p to 97.25p after UBS moved from neutral to buy and raised its target from 90p to 115p. The bank said it believed the first half figures would mark the low point for a number of high street groups, including Home Retail:</p> <blockquote> If Argos can produce broadly stable like for like sales again in the second quarter, its long term sales decline will look more cyclical than structural. If so, the consensus view that the operating companies have no value (net cash plus debtor book equals share price) will look misplaced. The upcoming Argos managing director will also tackle some of the remaining structural issues. <br> Our buy ratings on Marks &amp; Spencer and Home Retail are generally anti-consensus and would benefit both from a further recovery in the UK consumer as well as their own self-help programmes. </blockquote> <p>Despite the generally slow news day there were a couple of bid developments. <strong>Britvic</strong> jumped 41.3p to 369.9p after the soft drinks group said it was in talks about an all share merger with Irn-Bru maker <strong>AG Barr</strong>, up 34.6p at 450.2p. Traders suggested Britvic was now in play and could be attractive to the likes of PepsiCo or Diageo.</p> <p>Lower down the market, luxury jewellery designer <strong>Theo Fennell</strong> roes 3.25p to 15p after saying it was in preliminary bid talks with EME Capital, a group involved in the buyout of London's Soho House club.</p> <p>Finally, in contrast to struggling rival JJB Sports, <strong>Sports Direct International</strong> saw sales surge over the summer.</p> <p>Not only has Sports Direct scored a virtual knockout of JJB, it also received an Olympic boost, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2012/sep/04/uk-retail-sales-olympics-august?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">unlike many UK retailers</a>.

  "<p>In a cave in south-west France an extinct animal materialises out of the dark. Drawn in vigorous black lines by an artist in the ice age, a woolly mammoth shakes hairs that hide its face and vaunts slender tusks that reach almost to the ground.</p> <p>Those tusks were not dangerous enough to save it. As human hunters advanced on its icy haunts, <a href=\"http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2012/06/120612144809.htm\" title=\"\">mammoths faced extinction between 4,000 and 10,000 years ago</a>. The end of the ice age did for these shaggy cold-lovers, but humans helped: <a href=\"http://donsmaps.com/images23/mammothhousekiev.jpg\" title=\"\">entire huts built from mammoth tusks and bones have been found</a>.</p> <p>We didn't mean to help make the mammoth extinct. The <a href=\"http://www.pechmerle.com/english/introduction.html\" title=\"\">wonderful portrait of a mammoth in Pech Merle cave</a> reveals that early homo sapiens was fascinated by these marvellous creatures. This <a href=\"http://donsmaps.com/images3/mammothpechmerle.jpg\" title=\"\">masterpiece of cave art</a> is as acute as any modern work of naturalist observation. The hunters who painted in caves showed the same passion for the natural world as their descendants do. Their culture must have been bereft when the mammoth vanished \u2013 even as they helped it on its way.</p> <p>In the 21st century the same paradox endures. Human activity endangers entire species, yet human culture is profoundly rooted in nature. The loss of a species is also a loss of the images, stories, symbols and wonders that we live by \u2013 to call it a cultural loss may sound too cerebral: what we lose when we lose animals is the very meaning of life. Those first artists in ancient caves portrayed animals far more than they portrayed people. It was in the wild herds around them that the power of the cosmos and the mystery of existence seemed to be located.</p> <p>No species in modern times embodies that fascination more fully than the tiger, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/nov/09/last-chance-to-save-the-tiger\" title=\"\">one of today's most endangered predators</a>. Since the Romantic age tigers have been endowed in art and literature with the marvellous essence of life itself, a primeval power like the enigmatic strangeness the stone age artist saw in a mammoth. \"What immortal hand or eye,/ Could frame thy fearful symmetry?\" wonders William Blake in his 1794 poem The Tyger. That same childlike awe \u2013 Blake's poem appears in his child's eye Songs of Innocence and Experience \u2013 is shared by Henri Rousseau's 1891 painting <a href=\"http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/henri-rousseau-surprised\" title=\"\">Surprised!</a> of an archetypal tiger in a fantastic jungle.</p> <p>These artistic hymns to the tiger are just the noblest expressions of an imagery that pervades modern culture from tigers who come to tea to tigers with neat feet. It just seems unimaginable that a creature so familiar in our shared dreams should vanish from the natural world. Human culture would lose immeasurably from such a disappearance. And what about sharks? More ancient than dinosaurs, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/science/2009/jun/25/sharks-extinction-iucn-red-list\" title=\"\">under threat for the first time in their mind-bogglingly long history</a>, these creatures feed modern culture some of its darkest folklore. Shark films and scare stories are the modern equivalent of stone age hunters telling tales about bears and wolves around the fire. We fear them, but our culture needs them.</p> <p>Cute creatures as well as scary ones inspire the stories and myths that humans cannot live without. Amphibians, most threatened animal group of all, are among the most universal stars of culture. While Blake was marvelling at tigers, the Grimms recorded the folk tale of the frog-prince. Long before that Plato said the ancient Greeks were like frogs around a pond. Aristophanes wrote a comedy called The Frogs. American frogs <a href=\"http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/works-of-art/1998.39.1-.20\" title=\"\">were depicted by the Aztecs</a> as well as providing Amazonian peoples with arrow poison. The very naming of poison dart frogs reveals how deeply they are associated with cultures that are themselves on the brink of extinction.</p> <p>In Britain too, the amphibious denizens of threatened waterlands have always inspired imaginations. Could our culture survive without Toad of Toad Hall?</p> <p>Not so long ago British beaches were seasonally covered with \"mermaid's purses\", the eggs of sharks and rays. The name reveals how deeply nature feeds folk culture, in Britain as in the Amazon. Is it possible still to find masses of mermaid's purses on the Welsh rocks where I used to wonder what they were? I have to look for them with my daughter soon, before it is too late. The range of animals and plants threatened by the sixth extinction \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/series/sixth-extinction\" title=\"\">as covered by the Guardian over this fortnight</a> \u2013 is such that it menaces the foundations of culture as well as the diversity of nature. We are part of nature and it has always fed our imaginations. We face the bare walls of an empty museum, a gallery of the dead.</p>",
  "<p>It is telling that it has been a film-maker who has given us a fresh picture of what it means to be British. When politicians have tried to call up a sense of British identity they have been almost comically inept. Margaret Thatcher premised her market revolution on an image of the country as it might have seen itself in the 1950s, while Tony Blair always seemed to be on the brink of addressing us as fellow Americans. By presenting an inspiring vision of Britain that is rooted in present realities, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/jul/27/olympic-opening-ceremony\" title=\"\">Danny Boyle has achieved what no politician has yet seriously attempted</a>.</p> <p>Boyle's magnificent Olympic ceremony has given Labour an opportunity to rethink what positive value national identity might have in Britain today. Labour has never been an anti-patriotic party, but the discomfort of much of the left intelligentsia with the prejudices that often go with patriotism has allowed British identity to be largely defined by the right. <a href=\"http://cco.cambridge.org/extract?id=ccol0521858429_CCOL0521858429A007\" title=\"\">Orwell tried to define a patriotism of the left</a>, but that was more than 70 years ago; other, more recent, attempts have proved unsuccessful.</p> <p>Tim Soutphommasane's defence of multicultural patriotism has been taken up by a number of Ed Miliband's advisers. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/jon-cruddas\" title=\"\">John Cruddas</a> \u2013 Labour's most gifted thinker \u2013 was among those who invited Soutphommasane to speak to a policy group during a recent stay in London, when he also met the Labour leader. The 29-year-old Australian is attractive to Labour for several reasons. Born in France of Laotian and Chinese parents, he has none of the baggage that many promoters of patriotism carry with them. Rightly, he sees that nationality is a work in progress rather than a settled condition bequeathed by history. But can his theories be applied in Britain? And do they answer Labour's needs at the present time?</p> <p>It is hard to avoid having doubts about the exercise. This is hardly the first time Labour has tried to redefine a classic conservative theme and claim ownership of it. Think of Blair, who started wresting law and order from the Tories soon after he became shadow home secretary in 1992. In electoral terms it was a winning strategy, but Blair benefited from an economic bubble. Does it make sense to focus on questions of national identity when the most challenging issues faced by the next Labour government will be those that come with zero or negative growth? Some who are close to the Labour leadership apparently think so.</p> <p>Academic debates about citizenship and multiculturalism have been going on for a quarter of a century or more. The vast changes that have taken place in the world during that period are significant by their absence from the literature, and in this regard Soutphommasane's study is a standard example of its genre. China is mentioned in the course of a sentence, and Russia and India \u2013 two radically contrasting experiments in marrying democracy with nationality \u2013 are not discussed at all. The longer history of the type of liberal nationalism that Soutphommasane favours is touched on only in passing. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giuseppe_Mazzini\" title=\"\">Mazzini</a> is cited briefly, but France \u2013 an exemplar of the modern democratic nationalist project \u2013 is considered mainly in the context of <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/8458831.stm\" title=\"\">Sarkozy's problems with the burqa</a>.</p> <p>Where the book stands out is in its nuanced treatment of liberalism, and it is this that accounts for its relevance in Britain. Soutphommasane is right in thinking that liberal values \u2013 however they are defined, which certainly shouldn't only be in terms of market choice \u2013 need to be embedded in a shared political culture, with a history and a sense of its own identity. But as he makes clear, the liberal tradition remains the starting point. Over the past few years new currents of thinking have developed that are hostile to liberalism. Wisely, Cameron and Miliband have kept Blue Labour and Red Toryism at a safe distance from any position of influence. Liberalism may have its problems as a universalising theory, but British society \u2013 for all its anxieties about crime and immigration \u2013 is as deeply liberal as any in the world. A party that turns its back on this fact ceases to be electable.</p> <p>Soutphommasane is less convincing when he suggests that the nation-state is the sole legitimate vehicle for liberal values. He is aware that national cultures commonly rest on mythic versions of history. \"An account of patriotic deliberation would be fatally weakened,\" he writes, \"if it does not address this problem of myth.\" What is needed, he tells us, is patriotic self-criticism: \"In most cases, the repudiation of a national myth would not constitute a repudiation of the national project.\" It is an unconvincingly formulaic response. Violence and exclusion are not incidental features of nation-building. Pretty well every nation-state in the world has come into being through a process involving war and assaults on minorities. The idea that this history can be peeled away to reveal a \"national project\" innocent of crime is high-minded self-delusion.</p> <p>The point has more than historical interest. Reading Soutphommasane, you would not realise that some liberal states have managed quite successfully without having a single, overarching national culture of the sort he advocates. Britain, Canada and Spain are not just multicultural societies. They are also multinational polities. Yet for Soutphommasane nationality seems to be singular by its very nature. He frowns on dual citizenship, writing: \"Any need for the expression of multiple cultural affiliations can be done at a level <em>other than</em> that of political membership (that is, within the limits of single-state citizenship).\" Reflecting the importance he attaches to the issue, the italics are the author's. But compelling people to adopt a single national identity \u2013 however multicultural \u2013 is not obviously an advance in liberal values.</p> <p>This country has been as much shaped by conflict as any other, but the ability to enjoy several national identities is one of the chief advantages of being British today. A new settlement between the country's nationalities should aim to preserve this freedom, not sacrifice it to a theory of nationalism. Insisting that nationality can only be properly accommodated in a single state is unlikely to ease the process. The impact of similar theories in many countries has been to justify secession and promote disintegration.</p> <p>It may be that this rebooted version of nationalism will go the way of the wisdom of crowds and the social animal \u2013 novel-sounding ideas that politicians thirsty for soundbites take up and then just as quickly drop. If so it will be a pity. Multicultural patriotism is the only kind that has a future in Britain, and Soutphommasane raises issues of undoubted importance with which Labour is right to engage. However, unless a Scottish referendum on independence or \"devo max\" reshapes the political scene before the general election, issues of national identity are not going to be make-or-break territory for Labour any time soon.</p> <p>The government is floundering because it has run out of options. The much-touted cabinet shuffle has done nothing to improve the situation. Though Cameron may have hoped to head off his party's restive right, demoting Ken Clarke and Baroness Warsi will not appease the neo-Thatcherites who seem bent on a rerun of the Conservative civil war that helped propel Blair into power. Nor will it do anything to diminish the mounting threat to the Tory leader from Boris Johnson. But if the government is reaching a point from which it can no longer recover, the fundamental reason is that it has lost credibility on the economy. With the coalition too fractured and fragile to change direction, Cameron can only hang on in the hope of something turning up. As long as Miliband and Balls can avoid destructive internal wrangles and being distracted by lesser issues, this strategic impotence on the part of the government is Labour's opening to power.</p> <p>The Olympics have left us with a sense that Britain is one of the better places in which to live. It is a feeling that could soon vanish without trace if the country enters an era of more or less permanent austerity \u2013 a realistic scenario that Miliband and his advisers show no sign of having confronted. Their reluctance to address the prospect is understandable, but fine talk of a new patriotism will count for nothing if the next Labour government lacks a strategy for dealing with the shrunken and enfeebled economy it will surely inherit.</p> <p>\u2022 John Gray's <em>The Immortalization Commission</em> is published by Allen Lane.</p>",
  "<p>Hundreds of students, lecturers and staff from <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/londonmetropolitanuniversity\" title=\"\">London Metropolitan University</a> (LMU) are expected to hold a demonstration outside the Home Office in protest at the revocation of the institution's ability to host foreign students.</p> <p>Foreign students who must transfer their studies to another university in the next few months or face being returned to their country of origin without a degree, are expected to be among those leading the demonstration on Wednesday.</p> <p>On Monday night, the vice-chancellor of LMU, Malcolm Gillies, said the university would <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2012/sep/04/london-met-university-contest-visa\" title=\"\">take the government to court</a> after the border agency (UKBA) removed LMU's highly trusted status enabling it to support thousands of foreign student visas, just before the start of the academic term.</p> <p>Interviewed by the BBC, Gillies said UKBA's report of immigration failures at the university was wrong.</p> <p>\"My university is going to seek for this revocation to be stayed \u2026 because our analysis with leading immigration lawyers demonstrates that this report of the UKBA is wrong \u2026 We fundamentally contest the claim that there is systemic failure here.\"</p> <p>The Guardian also understands that a task force involving LMU, Universities UK, the Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE), the Border Agency, the Department of Business Innovation and Skills, and the NUS will meet on Wednesday afternoon at HEFCE's head offices to attempt to sort out the transfer of students to other universities.</p> <p>Any transfer process is expected to be especially fraught for those students who are part-way through specialist courses, or in the middle of PhDs where new supervisors will have to be found.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.nus.org.uk/\" title=\"\">The NUS</a> president, Liam Burns, said he would be lobbying to have costly visa charges waived for students who were being forced to transfer and to ensure years of study did not have to be repeated.

  "<p>Israeli soldiers are refusing to allow entry to a group of about 20 Eritrean refugees trapped for six days between Egyptian land and a high steel fence that Israel has erected along its southern border. Despite high temperatures and lack of shade, the soldiers have been instructed to provide only limited quantities of water.</p> <p>The Israeli interior minister, Eli Yishai, said Israel \"must act with a heavy hand\". The country had \"a very clear policy and a border fence\", he told Army Radio. \"We cannot let them enter.\"</p> <p>The group, which includes two women and a child, are refusing to return to Egypt. Technically, they are on Israeli territory but the recently erected fence prevents them advancing.</p> <p>According to Israeli media reports, one of the women was visibly pregnant, but migrants told the soldiers watching the group she had miscarried.</p> <p>The refugees have not been offered food since arriving at the spot in the northern stretch of the Israel-Egypt border last Thursday. Temperatures in the desert area are expected to peak at about 33C on Wednesday.</p> <p>In a statement, the Israeli Defence Forces said: \"The area under question has a long expanse of fence that was recently built in order to prevent unauthorised infiltration into Israeli territory. On the western side of the fence, on Egypt's side, is a group of foreigners whose entrance into Israel has been prevented thanks to this fence. For humanitarian reasons, [Israeli] forces have been providing the foreigners with water.\"</p> <p>The Association for Civil Rights in Israel condemned the refusal to allow the refugees entry. \"Israel has the right to build a fence, but a fence does not relieve Israel from its obligations,\" said Oded Feller. \"When people are standing at the fence and begging for their lives, we must make sure they are not in danger, and if they are, they must be let in.\"</p> <p>Yishai told Army Radio: \"Every day there are people stuck there. If there were no fence, and if we weren't steadfast, there would be a million people here.\"</p> <p>He conceded that it was hard to see the pictures, but added: \"I am the one who has to make the difficult decision, and if I have to choose between the good of the state, its civilians and its security, [and the good of the families] I will choose that there be a fence, that they won't enter and instead return to their country.\"</p> <p>Last month, another group of refugees were trapped in similar circumstances for several days before they were admitted to Israel for humanitarian reasons, and taken to a detention centre.</p> <p>Israel began building the fence along its 150-mile southern border last summer and it is due to be completed by the end of this year. According to the Population and Immigration Authority, the number of migrants entering Israel from Egypt fell to 200 in August, compared with 2,000 a year earlier.</p> <p>An Israeli government spokesman said: \"According to international practices and binding precedents, the fence is a de facto border, and therefore anyone who is beyond it is not located in Israeli territory and is therefore not eligible for automatic entry.\"</p> <p>No international body had determined that Eritrean or Sudanese citizens were being persecuted in Egypt or that their lives were in danger, he added. \"Therefore, there is no legal obligation to allow entry into Israel of those who are near the fence.\"</p> <p>The presence of migrants from sub-Sahara Africa in Israel has become a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/may/24/israelis-attack-african-migrants-protest\" title=\"Israelis attack African migrants during protest against refugees\">volatile political and social issue over recent months</a>.

Israel's population is 7.8 million.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.hrw.org/\" title=\"Human Rights Watch \">Human Rights Watch </a>said on Wednesday that hundreds of migrants trying to reach Israel were being held by traffickers in Sinai; it said they were tortured, raped and sexually assaulted in an attempt to extort ransom payments from their families.</p> <p>The organisation had \"received numerous reports in recent years of organised criminal groups detaining asylum seekers and migrants in Sinai for extortion before allowing them to complete the journey to Israel\", it said.</p> <p>\"The sums traffickers demanded from the migrants have increased from about $2,500 [\u00a31,580] in 2009 to as much as $30,000 [\u00a319,000]. The traffickers torture the migrants and beat them while they plead with relatives abroad by phone for money to meet their captors' demands. Victims include children as young as 14.\"</p>",
  "<p>On another down day for the market, <strong>BT</strong> is bucking the trend after positive noises from JP Morgan Cazenove.</p> <p>The broker has moved its recommendation from neutral to overweight, and raised its price target from 240p to 250p. Analyst Carl Murdock-Smith said:</p> <blockquote> We upgrade BT due to the relative attraction we see versus European incumbents. We believe BT's forecast risk is lower than the sector's, given its exposure to the UK, fixed-line, its lack of exposure to spectrum auctions, and <br>as its fibre rollout plans are already well known and in forecasts (with early proof of monetisation).  But it carries more balance sheet volatility via its pension deficit. Importantly, near-term obligations of \u00a3325m in March 2013and 2014 are agreed, alongside a mechanism to calculate payments until 2024. Under the current mechanism, even the worst case appears manageable (March 2015 \u00a3655m, increasing to a peak in March 2021 \u00a3724m), in the context of BT guiding 2014/15 normalised free cash flow of around \u00a32.5bn and its dividend guidance implying a 2014/2015 dividend of \u00a30.8bn-\u00a31.0bn. </blockquote> <p>Overall the market has continued Tuesday's decline, with the <strong>FTSE 100</strong> down another 27.15 points at 5644.76 ahead of Thursday's key European Central Bank meeting. Disappointing US manufacturing figures on Tuesday continue to hit sentiment.</p> <p>The US news, along with lower than expected growth in Australia in the second quarter and continuing concerns about China, has left the mining sector lower, despite analysts at Bernstein beginning coverage on a number of companies with an outperform rating. These include <strong>Rio Tinto</strong>, 43.5p lower at 2678.5p, and <strong>BHP Billiton</strong>, down 62p to \u00a317.65. BHP shares also went ex-dividend.</p> <p><strong>BP</strong> continues to be the biggest faller on the leading index, down 17.9p to 418.7p as <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2012/sep/05/deepwater-horizon-us-bp-oil-spill\" title=\"\">the US justice department took a strong position against the company regarding the Gulf of Mexico oil spill in 2010</a>.</p>",
