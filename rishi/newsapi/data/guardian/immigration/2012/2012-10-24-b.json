  "<p>Rio Ferdinand is prepared to shake Ashley Cole's hand at Stamford Bridge on Sunday and that of John Terry in future as the Manchester United player seeks to make a conciliatory gesture amid the racism rows shaking the game. His brother Anton, the Queens Park Rangers defender who was racially abused by Terry, is also open to shaking hands with both Terry and Cole.</p> <p>Ferdinand will start against Chelsea in the vital Premier League fixture that will be televised around the world and although Terry is suspended, as a result of his domestic four-match Football Association ban for the abuse of Anton Ferdinand, Cole will line up against him.</p> <p>There had been conjecture over whether Ferdinand would acknowledge Cole in the pre-match ritual, which is designed to promote fair play and respect. To the dismay of the Ferdinand family, Cole gave evidence in support of Terry at the Chelsea captain's magistrates court trial in July, when he was acquitted of the charge of directing racist language at Anton Ferdinand in the league game between their clubs last October.</p> <p>Rio Ferdinand has been fined \u00a345,000 by the FA for appearing to endorse a tweet that described Cole as a \"choc ice\" \u2013 a slang term with obvious racial connotations \u2013 while Anton refused to shake hands with Terry or Cole when QPR played Chelsea at Loftus Road on 15 September.</p> <p>But after another week or so of race-related controversy, with the low point coming in Serbia last Tuesday, when the England Under-21 player Danny Rose was subjected to monkey chants from the crowd, the Ferdinands have sought to make a statement that might help matters to move forward.</p> <p>It has been a family decision, taken after much discussion. Rio Ferdinand would not have been prepared to shake with Cole on Sunday unless Anton were fully supportive. But rather like United's Patrice Evra and Luis Su\u00e1rez of Liverpool, who put their well-publicised differences to the side for a greater good when they shook hands before the league game between their teams on 23 September, the brothers want to look to the future. Part of their thinking has been that pre-match non-handshaking sideshows cannot be allowed to continue indefinitely.</p> <p>There has been no disguising how they have felt over the past year, particularly towards the FA and the Professional Footballers' Association. The Ferdinands and other black players were dismayed that Terry received only a four-match suspension and as it only applies in domestic competition, he was free to captain Chelsea in their <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2012/oct/23/shakhtar-donetsk-chelsea-report-champions-league\" title=\"\">Champions League tie at Shakhtar Donetsk</a> on Tuesday. As part of an anti-racism action week, Terry's armband was embroidered with the slogan \"Unite Against Racism\".</p> <p>Chelsea's players will wear Kick It Out anti-racism T-shirts on Sunday but the Ferdinands did not wear them before their matches over the weekend, together with a clutch of other black players, in protest at the direction that they feel the campaign has taken. There was a tonic, though, on Wednesday, when the PFA's chief executive, Gordon Taylor, announced a six-point plan to counter racism in the game which featured a call for tougher penalties for racist abuse, including making it potentially a sackable offence.</p> <p>And the Ferdinand brothers<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2012/oct/24/rio-anton-ferdinand-fa-pfa\" title=\"\"> issued a joint statement</a> on Wednesday evening, that was carried on United's website, in which they outlined their commitment to the ongoing discussions aimed at finding a way forward.</p> <p>\"On the issue of Kick It Out,\" they said, \"we would like to go on record to say what fantastic work they have done in the past regarding education and awareness. However, times change and organisations need to change with them. We are more than happy to join the discussion, privately, to make Kick It Out more relevant in its fight to stamp out racism in football.</p> <p>\"Although we have been left disappointed by the PFA and the FA's actions over the last year, as a family, we are committed to working with football's existing organisations towards the betterment of the game and to achieve immediate action.</p> <p>\"We would like to thank all the fans and the staff at Queens Park Rangers and Manchester United for their support in what has been a difficult year. In particular we want to thank [the managers] Sir Alex Ferguson and Mark Hughes. We will not be discussing publicly any issues connected with the case. We are now going to concentrate on playing football.\"</p> <p>Rio Ferdinand can expect to encounter hostility from the Stamford Bridge crowd but Chelsea, while welcoming a passionate atmosphere, will make it clear, as always, that they will not tolerate any behaviour from the stands that crosses the boundaries of acceptability. They will reinforce the day's anti-racism message in the programme. The club continually reviews its security for big matches.</p> <p>Kick it Out released their own statement, welcoming the Ferdinands' move and promising to redouble their efforts to eradicate discrimination from the game. \"Kick It Out very much welcomes this statement,\" it said.</p> <p>\"We know and recognise the hurt that many people have gone through over the last 12 months, none more so than the Ferdinand family themselves.</p> <p>\"We will continue to work across the campaigning and diversity agenda with all partners to ensure the grievances of players are concluded fairly, thoroughly and swiftly.\"</p>",

Young readers taking part in the Guardian's 2012 Young Critics competition - as well as members of the Guardian's children's book site - also had their say as they judged the longlisted books.</p> <p>Julia Eccleshare said: \"The judges read extensively and intensely in their search for the winner of the Guardian Children's Fiction Prize this year, but decided unanimously that The Unforgotten Coat's great immediacy and humour really set it apart. </p> <p>\"With his brilliant depiction of two brothers from Mongolia trying to adapt to school in Liverpool while haunted by a fear from home, Frank Cottrell Boyce never preachers to the reader, and judges felt that he writes with such credibility and warmth that his readers will be left wiser when they have finished the story.\"</p> <p>Frank Cottrell Boyce said: \"It would be amazing to win this award with any book I'd written but it is a special joy to win it with The Unforgotten Coat, which started life not as a published book at all, but as a gift. Walker gave away thousands of copies in Liverpool - on buses, at ferry terminals, through schools, prisons and hospitals - to help promote the mighty <a href=\"http://thereader.org.uk/\">Reader Organisation</a>. We even had the book launch on a train. The photographs in the book, were created by my friends and neighbours - Carl Hunter and Claire Heaney.

So everything about it comes from very close to home - even though it's a story about Xanadu!</p> <p>\"Being shortlisted for the Guardian Prize gives you a particularly warm glow because it is awarded by a panel of your fellow authors. Past winners include my childhood heroes - Alan Garner, Leon Garfield, Joan Aiken - and contemporary heroes like Mark Haddon, Geraldine McCaughrean and Meg Rosoff.\"</p> <p>Charlotte, aged nine, one of the winners of the young critics competition that accompanies the prize, wrote \"The characters are amazingly real and the book is full of surprises.

  "<p>We've reached a moment in American history where debates can be judged by who buys the most clever keyword on Twitter and how quickly (and how many) Tumblrs are launched while they are still happening. As the series of debates this month ended, I felt a pang of guilt and jealousy for every journo-tweet that scrolled across my screen with the simple message: \"Read my take here.\" We're doing \"takes\" now \u2013 though I think of them not as quick sketches of opinion, but in the movie-production sense: a series of line-readings varied in intonation but not content.</p> <p>It would be heresy to say anything besides what's already been decided (by whom? I can't always tell), and the tide of identical opinion overwhelms subtle distinctions about individual arguments. So, when it comes to the presidential contests: Obama lost the first debate; Romney lost the second debate; foreign policy lost the third. </p> <p>The insistence on declaring a \"winner\" in presidential debates has always irritated me. In arguments over philosophy, ideology or morality, what counts as \"winning\"? Back in high school forensics, we walked into speech-and-debate tournaments ready to argue either side, fully aware that the judges evaluated logical consistency, command of the material, originality of arguments, and presentation \u2013 not who was <em>right</em>. To \"win on points\" was a meaningful phrase, because someone was keeping score.</p> <p>Today's presidential debates don't even have a consistent standard for accuracy, and \"winning on points\" just means you came out ahead in a very high-level battle of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dozens\">the dozens</a>. Very well, never mind: it's exactly like high school except then we trusted the judges, because \"zingers\" and moments of special fluency, and not truth, are what seems to sway voters. Voters are not, for instance, undecided on the question of whether across-the-board tax cuts are a good idea. (In fact, they seem set against them <a href=\"http://www.nationaljournal.com/daily/poll-don-t-extend-bush-cuts-for-wealthy-20120618?mrefid=mostViewed\">when you ask directly</a>.)</p> <p>Voters take in a discussion of tax rates as a form of instructional moral theater, a passion play in which the roles of good and evil haven't been definitively cast but will be determined by who makes the argument that <em>sounds</em> the most righteous. How else do you explain the consistent <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RealTimePolitic/status/253665216922005506\">approval</a> of Romney's tax spiel among undecided voters? The Twitter feed of the professors who supervised CNN's \"dial test\" shows, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RealTimePolitic/status/253662826395209728\">again</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ErinBurnett/status/258378909014425600\">again</a>, undecided voters reacting positively to policies that are demonstrably unpopular with most Americans, including independents, by <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-250_162-57416095/cbs-news-nyt-poll-4-18-12/%20?tag=contentMain;contentBody\">margins of 20-30%</a>. (Only 36% all voters say the best way to promote economic growth is \"lower taxes and cut spending\"; 34% of independents say the same.)</p> <p>Judging the debates on salesmanship makes it easier to see past complaints from Democrats that the Romney who showed up for the debates was a different one than we saw on the stump: you can't really say Romney misrepresented <em>himself</em>, just his policies. Indeed, we saw both candidates' true nature, if not always the truth, throughout the series. </p> <p>They are both thin-skinned nerds, whose confidence about their command of facts is more certain than the facts themselves. Obama's sleepy nonchalance in the first debate and narrow-eyed near-sadism in the second spoke, in their way, to his arrogance; whereas Romney's casual, inappropriate references to all things he wants to subdue as things he \"likes\" (Big Bird, teachers, green energy) did the same.</p> <p>Romney showed himself to be awkwardly distant from the norms of American life (what struggling family doesn't look forward to tax-free capital gains!?) and speech (binders!). Obama demonstrated a Gen-X sense of humor, bordering on contemptuous (\"the 80s called\"). Romney's persnickety fixation with the debates' guidelines underscored a preoccupation with compliance that I felt belied the Obama camp's worst insinuations about him: whatever his tax returns or time at Bain might reveal, the guy is not a rule-breaker, much less a felon.</p> <p>Romney is as obsessed with following the letter of the law as Obama is with fudging literal fulfillment of regulations he believes objectionable \u2013 or, at least, politically inconvenient. However well-intentioned he might be, this is an apt description of the administration's position on <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2012/06/25/politics/immigration-administration-reaction/index.html\">immigration law</a> and the <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2012/05/obamas-legal-progression-on-defense-of-marriage-act/\">Defense of Marriage Act</a>: intentional avoidance of enforcement. This casual attitude toward regulations one doesn't care for makes Obama more like George Bush than many Democrats would like to admit (see also: drone strikes, kill lists).</p> <p>Such self-assured capriciousness when it comes to governance is not a moral position I'm particularly comfortable with \u2013 and I'm not sure it's superior to Romney's programmatic intellectual alchemy (\"You say I'm inconsistent? Here is why I'm not! See? I fixed it!\"). Even more to the point, Romney abides by the rules \u2013 but wants to rewrite them so that they benefit him and people like him. And he sees nothing wrong with that.</p> <p>Yet, for a long time, I've thought that Romney's ingrained devotion to rules would make him a relatively unobjectionable president. As my dad put it once:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"At least he won't get us into illegal wars.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>But, of course, the debates showed that Romney's most unwavering trait is changeability. He might not get us into any \"illegal wars\" \u2013 but only because <a href=\"http://thinkprogress.org/security/2012/08/02/627031/dan-senor-romney-closest-adviser/?mobile=nc\">Dan Senor</a> will convince him that there's a law they're following somewhere. Romney is somehow more adaptive to his environment than even our first biracial president.</p> <p>And in that way, he's following a path to victory much like the one we followed as high school rhetoricians: say anything.</p>",
  "<h2><strong>Rishi Siddani,12, writes:</strong></h2> <p>Frank Cottrell Boyce has created an excellent story out of the inspiration he received from a real life story that happened at Joan of Arc Primary. This book has a slight pinch of comedy, a teaspoon of mystery and a whole flagon of brilliance.</p> <p>Two Mongolian refugee brothers, Chingis and Nergui Tuul, appear one day in Julie O'Connor's last term in primary school. Immediately, the author hooks the reader, utilizing their natural sense of curiosity. The reader reads on to search for the answer to their question: who were these two? Julie is chosen to be the brothers' \"Good Guide\". There seemed to be no doubt that this was to be the most memorable last term that Julie had hoped for. The Tuul brothers, in their quest to fit in with their schoolmates in order to confuse the so-called 'demon', passed one month in their Liverpool community aided by Julie.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Chingis and his Polaroid camera transform Liverpool into their own version of Mongolia, and Julie can see bits of Mongolia everywhere she ventures. When one day, however, Chingis and Nergui run away from school, Julie follows them and brings them back home \u2013 back into the \"demon's\" clutches! Next morning, Mr Spendlove, their teacher announces that Chingis and Nergui did not have the right papers to live in England and that the Tuul family was taken back to their home country, Mongolia.</p> <p>Many years later, Julie O'Connor visits her childhood school before it is knocked down. After she greets Mr Spendlove, she sifts through the lost property box. And there it is: the unforgettable coat of Chingis Tuul.</p> <p>Told with the humor, warmth and the brilliant detail which characterizes Frank Cottrell Boyce's writing, this magical and compelling story is enriched by stunning and atmospheric Polaroid photos. It was shortlisted for the Costa Children's book award. </p> <p>It is another magnificent piece of work by a popular, bestselling and prize-winning author. What else could you ask of a book? I recommend it for everyone above the age of 9.</p> <h2><strong>Lottie Longshanks, 9, writes:</strong></h2> <p>Julie becomes the \"Good Guide\" to two Mongolian brothers who \u00adarrive at her school. They're oddly dressed in huge woolly coats and Chengis is very protective of his younger brother \u00adNergui. </p> <p>They have a Polaroid camera and show Julie \u00adphotographs they say are of Mongolia. \u00adJulie's mother welcomes them into her home and Julie wants to pay a return visit but soon discovers that this will never happen. The family fears that demons will steal Nergui, so Chengis tries to confuse them. One day the boys disappear and it is not until she returns to school years later and finds Nergui's coat, in the lost property cupboard, that she understands their behaviour. </p> <p>This book will linger in your \u00admemory long after you've finished it. It made me think about people who are constantly afraid and it opened my eyes to a vast country that once had the biggest empire the world has ever known. </p> <p>The characters are amazingly real and the book is full of surprises. I would recommend it to any reader who likes to find out about other children's lives. It is so \u00adbeautifully written \u2013 almost like \u00adpoetry in places \u2013 that it is very easy to read.</p>",

It is told from the perspective of their new friend Julie, also in year six.</p> <p>\"It absolutely captures the feel of being a child of that age,\" said Eccleshare. \"It's not a big blockbusting novel with obvious themes of dystopia and apocalypse \u2013 instead it's a heart-warming, imaginative, funny story with a very serious message at its heart.\"</p> <p>The Unforgotten Coat was inspired by the true story of a Mongolian girl called Misheel who Cottrell Boyce met while doing a reading at a primary school.</p> <p>When she was taken in the night by the immigration authorities to be deported, one of the things her classmates were most worried about was that Misheel had left her coat behind, as they knew how cold it was in Mongolia. It was an image, Cottrell Boyce said, that haunted him.</p> <p>\"It wasn't a commercial book at all \u2013 it came from a very different place,\" he said. \"The Reader Organisation promotes reading to all kinds of different groups, from kids with difficulties to alcoholics, and they were looking for a book which would cross all the groups. They found it very difficult to find, so I wrote this as a gift.\"</p> <p>Featuring original pictures by Liverpool photographers Carl Hunter and Clare Heney, The Unforgotten Coat \"wasn't written to win prizes or sell loads of copies\", said Cottrell Boyce.</p> <p>\"I love the Guardian prize, the fact it's given by other writers, and that it's gone to books I loved reading like The Owl Service. It's fantastic to win it anyway, but to win with something so exuberant, that was not trying to win any awards, is really great. This is a book that was written for fun, and for friendship.\"</p> <p>Sue Kendall \u2013 the woman who invited Cottrell Boyce to speak at the school where he met Misheel \u2013 was at the ceremony. The author writes in an afterword to the novel that as he was putting the finishing touches to the book, he bumped into Kendall, \"and she told me that Misheel had \u2013 for the first time ever \u2013 rung her that morning from Mongolia\".</p>",
  "<p>Leonid Razvozzhayev spoke quickly from the bed of his one-man jail cell. \"I'm scared to stay here alone,\" he told the group of prison rights activists who had come to visit him. \"I'm afraid those men \u2013 the ones who took me me, who tortured me \u2013 will come back.\"</p> <p>Razvozzhayev, a 39-year-old anti-Putin activist and aide to an opposition MP, flew to Ukraine last week amid a spiralling crackdown on Russia's opposition. Just a day after he arrived, Russian prosecutors opened a criminal investigation into him, the first step to bringing charges for allegedly organising mass unrest and a potential 10-year jail sentence. Thus Razvozzhayev began the long process of bidding for political asylum \u2013 and in the midst of it disappeared, only to turn up at a Moscow prison two days later.</p> <p>Razvozzhayev's story \u2013 one of alleged abduction, torture, death threats and forced confessions \u2013 has sent a bolt of fear and anger through those opposed to Russia's powerful president. It is the latest, and perhaps most convoluted, tale to emerge from the Kremlin's attempt to put down the opposition that emerged to challenge Putin's return to power earlier this year.</p> <p>\"He's not sure what day it is \u2013 he's in such a state, under such pressure,\" said Zoya Svetova, one of the five activists who visited Razvozzhayev on Tuesday. Svetova is a journalist for the New Times, an opposition magazine, in which she described her conversation with Razvozzhayev.</p> <p>Razvozzhayev told the group how he had left Russia for neighbouring Ukraine on 15 October. The next day, prosecutors in Moscow <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/17/russia-opposition-leader-detained-udaltsov\" title=\"\">opened a criminal investigation into him and two fellow activists</a> in the socialist Left Front \u2013 its leader, Sergei Udaltsov, and Konstantin Lebedev. They were suspected of plotting mass unrest and terrorist attacks in Russia, investigators said, citing a propaganda report on state-run television that claimed to show the men plotting revolution.</p> <p>Fearing the worst if he were to return to Russia, Razvozzhayev, an aide to outspoken parliamentary deputy Ilya Ponomaryov, decided to seek political asylum and approached the United Nations high commissioner for refugees (UNHCR) on 19 October. They directed him to a partner organisation for legal counselling. The talks were long. He went out for a sandwich \u2013 and never came back.</p> <p>Razvozzhayev said four men were waiting for him at the exit. \"They threw me in a minivan,\" the New Times quoted him as saying. \"They put a tight black hat on me, so I couldn't see anything, and tied my arms and legs up with tape. And we were off.\" UNHCR issued a statement saying it was \"deeply concerned\" about his disappearance.</p> <p>They drove for hours in near total silence, Razvozzhayev said. At what he believes was the Russia-Ukraine border, he was put into another minivan and driven further. Once they stopped, he was handcuffed and dragged into a cellar and interrogated for two days, he said, alleging psychological torture.</p> <p>\"For two days they didn't let me go to the toilet. I didn't eat, I didn't drink the whole time,\" Razvozzhayev told the prison rights activists. The handcuffs never came off, he added. The unidentified men pressured him into signing a confession and implicating his fellow activists, Razvozzhayev alleged.</p> <p>\"They told me: if you don't answer our questions, then your children will be killed,\" he told the group. \"I agreed to say what they wanted.\" He was then taken to the headquarters of the investigative committee in Moscow, a body akin to the FBI.</p> <p>Video obtained by Life News, a tabloid, and aired on its website on Sunday evening showed Razvozzhayev being transferred from the building to a waiting police van, shouting \"Tell them I've been tortured\". On Monday, the committee issued a statement saying Razvozzhayev had wilfully turned himself in. Officials have denied all claims of torture.</p> <p>The investigative committee charged Razvozzhayev on Tuesday and remanded him in custody for two months. Udaltsov is due to be charged on Friday, it said. The men face up to 10 years in prison if found guilty.</p> <p>\"The massive persecution of dissidents in Russia is continuing,\" the opposition said in a joint statement on Wednesday. \"\"The Russian authorities have turned to methods of direct pressure of force against its opponents.\" Activists held a day-long protest outside the headquarters of the federal security service, the main successor to the KGB, on Wednesday.</p> <p>\"One week ago, we didn't think that a person could be abducted and forced into a confession,\" Svetova told the Guardian. \"We didn't think it was possible to open a criminal case because of a TV programme. This didn't even exist in the Soviet Union. Who knows what's next.\"</p> <p>On Tuesday, the Russian parliament passed the latest in a string of laws that activists warn are designed to crack down on the opposition. The law, which must be signed by Putin before coming into force, expands the definition of high treason to include vague wording that could be used against any Russian who speaks to a foreigner, activists warned.</p>",
  "<p>The Republicans opened up a new line of attack Wednesday accusing Barack Obama of trivialising the election by talking about Big Bird, binders and bayonets because he could not run on his first-term record.</p> <p>In a web ad, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogdjQjxH8LM\">the Republican national committee says</a>: \"If you do not have a record to run on, you make a big election about small things.\"</p> <p>The ad came as Obama began two-day marathon trip round six battleground states as Romney's campaign showed signs of gathering momentum, attracting his biggest crowd of the campaign yet, with more than 10,000 turning out for a late-night rally Tuesday at Red Rocks, near Denver.</p> <p>Anticipating swing state after swing state toppling in his direction on election night, Romney said Colorado could be the one that takes him over the magic 270 number of electoral college votes. \"We're on the homestretch now. And I think the people of Colorado are going to get us all the way there,\" Romney told them.</p> <p>The Republican ad carried clips of Obama talking about Big Bird and Elmo from Sesame Street, about his focus on Romney's debate remark in New York about binders full of women and Obama's dismissive remark in the last debate on Monday about the military having moved on beyond bayonets and horses.<br> As part of the frivolity charge, the Republican ad mentions Obama labelling the Republican candidate last week as suffering from 'Romnesia'.</p> <p>\"Instead of talking about issues, the president offers petty attacks,\" the ad said.</p> <p>The Romney campaign team, co-ordinating its attack with the Republicans, issued a statement suggesting that Obama's 20-page leaflet on Tuesday setting out a second-term agenda was another example of small-scale politics, just a repackaging of old ideas.</p> <p>Obama campaign advisers, speaking to reporters aboard a plane following the president round the six battleground states, insisted the president was addressing the big issues in his campaign speeches, from the economy to health, from education to foreign policy.</p> <p>Jen Psaki, one of Obama's campaign spokeswoman, disputed Republican claims that the momentum was behind its campaign. She said that Obama was tied or ahead in every single swing state, that he was is ahead in terms of early voting and that, contrary to Republican claims, the campaign expected turn-out among Latinos and African Americans, who overwhelmingly support Obama, to be a record.</p> <p>\"We expect the race to be razor-thin until the end,\" she said.</p> <p>In an interview with the Des Moines Register, which was initially off-the-record but is now on, Obama suggested that if he wins the election, it would be because Romney, in harsh rhetoric aimed at undocumented workers, had alienated Latinos. </p> <p>\"Since this is off the record, I will just be very blunt. Should I win a second term, a big reason I will win a second term is because the Republican nominee and the Republican party have so alienated the fastest-growing demographic group in the country, the Latino community,\" Obama said.</p> <p>In the interview, he also offered a little more detail on his plans for a second term, saying he would seek to complete immigration reform in his first year and that a 'grand bargain' could be agreed with Congress on tackling the deficit.</p>",
  "<p>Alex Salmond's chaotic attempts to persuade voters he could take an independent Scotland smoothly into the European Union have suffered another setback, after Spain said Scotland would need to \"join the queue\" and negotiate as a new member state.</p> <p>Foreign minister Jos\u00e9 Manuel Garc\u00eda-Margallo told the Spanish senate on Tuesday that an independent Scotland would have to go through a potentially long negotiating process and win the support of all 27 members, including Spain \u2013 directly contradicting Salmond's position on EU membership.</p> <p>\"In the hypothetical case of independence, Scotland would have to join the queue and ask to be admitted, needing the unanimous approval of all member states to obtain the status of a candidate country \u2026 and to sign the final treaty [of accession],\" Garc\u00eda-Margallo said.</p> <p>Intensifying the pressure on Salmond, the Spanish foreign minister said Scotland would also need member states to scrutinise its legislation before approving the 35 separate chapters that have to be negotiated before a new member is admitted.</p> <p>In September, the European commission president, Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso, also suggested that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/sep/12/barroso-doubt-scotland-eu-membership\" title=\"\">an independent Scotland would be seen as a new state</a>, and would need to apply to join.</p> <p>Garc\u00eda-Margallo did not say whether Spain might block Scottish EU membership, but his rightwing People's party government is currently fighting a battle to prevent Catalonia, a wealthy region with significant levels of autonomy, from calling its own independence referendum. Last weekend, Basque nationalist and separatist parties won two-thirds of the seats in its regional assembly, intensifying pressure on Madrid to cede more powers. It now appears the Spanish government's dispute with its own independence movements has led to a hardening stance on Scotland.</p> <p>Garc\u00eda-Margallo's intervention is another significant setback to Salmond, who has endured bruising allegations from opponents and the Scottish press over whether he had lied about <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/oct/23/alex-salmond-eu-legal-advice-scotland\" title=\"\">receiving formal legal advice from government law officers on EU membership</a>.</p> <p>Until now, Salmond and his ministers have regarded Garc\u00eda-Margallo as a significant ally in their efforts to show that an independent Scotland would be able to freely and smoothly inherit EU membership. They have frequently cited his remarks in January this year, when Garc\u00eda-Margallo indicated Spain was neutral about Scotland's future membership.</p> <p>At the time, Garc\u00eda-Margallo said it was \"an internal subject which will be resolved within the British constitutional framework, which has nothing to do with the Spanish constitutional framework \u2026 they are completely different processes\".</p> <p>Salmond's difficulties escalated dramatically on Tuesday when it emerged his government had never asked for or received any advice from its law officers on whether an independent Scotland would automatically join the EU, after months of hints and apparent confirmation that such advice had been given.</p> <p>His deputy, Nicola Sturgeon, shocked opposition parties by disclosing the advice had only just been requested, after the Edinburgh agreement setting up the independence referendum was signed by Salmond and David Cameron last week.</p> <p>The Scottish government has also gone to Scotland's highest civil court seeking to overturn an order from the Scottish information commissioner, Rosemary Agnew, that it should disclose that advice. That legal challenge \u2013 due to be heard in December \u2013 has now been dropped.</p> <p>Salmond angrily denied on Tuesday that he had lied in an interview with Andrew Neil on BBC1 earlier this year, when he appeared to confirm his law officers had supported his case that an independent Scotland would join the EU automatically, would not need to join the euro and would inherit the UK's opt-outs on border security, immigration and financial treaty requirements. Salmond insisted he had been speaking in general terms in his BBC&#xa0;interview.</p> <p>After headlines and leader columns accused Salmond bluntly of \"lying\", the pressure intensified on Wednesday when the Scottish Tory leader, Ruth Davidson, asked for Scotland's chief law officer \u2013 the lord advocate, Frank Mulholland \u2013 to appear before the Scottish parliament.</p> <p>During prime minister's questions in the Commons on Wednesday, Cameron said the situation was \"truly baffling\" and raised substantial questions about Salmond's assurances on the impact of independence.</p> <p>\"It turns out now they didn't have any legal advice at all and I think what this shows is when you shine the spotlight on the case for separation the SNP put, it completely falls apart,\" Cameron said.</p> <p>A Scottish government spokeswoman said Garc\u00eda-Margallo's latest remarks had been \"overtaken by events\" because there was now a deal between the governments to set up the independence referendum. That document, however, makes no mention of EU membership. \"As Mr Garc\u00eda-Margallo himself said earlier this year, this is an internal matter to be resolved within the UK \u2013 and we now have that clear agreement on the process,\" she said.</p> <p>She implied the Spanish foreign minister's latest remarks were wrong: \"Scotland will inherit exactly the same international treaty rights and obligations as the rest of the UK, as equal successor states.</p> <p>\"Scotland has been an integral part of the European Union for almost four decades, so an independent Scotland will continue in EU membership \u2013 and by definition Scotland already meets the criteria for EU membership, as acknowledged recently by an expert report.\"</p>",

Many warned that Assad was simply playing for time. The Syrian government has said that the opposition is too disunited to observe any truce.</p> <p>Abdelbaset Sieda, the head of the Syrian National Council, the main anti-Assad group in exile, told Associated Press he had little hope a ceasefire would take hold. \"This regime, we don't trust it, because it is saying something and doing something else on the ground,\" Sieda said in an phone interview from Stockholm.</p> <p>Fahd al-Misr, a spokesman for the opposition joint military command, told the Guardian: \"We won't allow the regime to catch its breath and commit more massacres after the truce.\"</p> <p>Jabhat al-Nusra, a jihadi group, rejected the ceasefire call as a \"filthy game\".</p> <p>Crucially, there is no provision for international observers or monitors, without whom it is hard to see how any ceasefire could be enforced. The Arab League and UN both despatched observers earlier in the 19-month conflict, with little effect.</p> <p>But it was still possible that a ceasefire could formally take effect, with rare international backing for a palliative gesture rather than an attempt to reach a comprehensive settlement of the crisis, which has already left an estimated 30,000 dead.</p> <p>Strikingly, both the Russian and Chinese ambassadors to the UN expressed support for a ceasefire. Both countries have good relations with Syria and have protected it from any censure or punishment by the security council. But the last attempt at a ceasefire collapsed within just a few days in April, with both sides accusing the other of breaching it.</p> <p>Brahimi, who took over from Kofi Annan in September, told reporters in Cairo on Wednesday: \"After the visit I made to Damascus, there is agreement from the Syrian government for a ceasefire during the Eid.\" Observers said he may have been deliberately trying to raise expectations and \"bounce\" the Syrians into agreement. But shortly afterwards, Syria's foreign ministry said the proposal was still being studied by the army command, with a final decision to be announced on Thursday.</p> <p>The ceasefire talk came on another day of violence, with government warplanes carrying out bombing raids on the northern town of Maarat al-Numan and nearby villages while rebels surrounded an army base to its east. Five people from one family, including a child and a woman, were killed in the air strikes, according to an opposition monitor, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.</p> <p>In the Damascus suburb of Tadamon, a terrorist car bomb killed four people and injured 11, state media reported. Official media also highlighted a Russian military claim that armed groups in Syria have been supplied with shoulder-launched air defence systems including US-made Stinger missiles.</p> <p>Maarat al-Numan has fallen to the rebels, cutting Syria's main north-south highway, a strategic route for Assad to move troops from Damascus to Aleppo, the country's largest city where the insurgents have a foothold. Fighting raged around a nearby military base whose capture would be a significant step towards creating a \"safe zone\" that could allow them to focus forces on Assad's strongholds in southern Syria.</p>",
  "<p>In the shadow of the Houses are Parliament the chants were cheeky and insistent: \"Hey Ho! Patriarchy has to go!\" yelled hundreds of women, young and not so young, who had gathered for a mass lobby to protest against what they see as an erosion of women's rights.</p> <p>They were joined by around a dozen \"Olympic Suffragettes\" who had performed in the Olympics opening ceremony, carrying banners with the slogan: \"Deeds not words.\".\"Leading them was Helen Pankhurst, great-granddaughter of Emmeline Pankhurst, who said she believed her ancestors would have supported the modern-day feminist movement. \"It feels like we are a crossroads,\" she said, dressed in Edwardian clothing and wearing a \"Votes for Women\" pin badge. \"Feminist activities is increasing in so many ways, but within the institutions, in the world of politics, it feels like we are in a dangerous moment where repressive ideas could take hold,\" she said.\" Looking around at the women surrounding her, she added: \"I'm hoping we will win the argument.\"</p> <p>The women here were gathered to directly lobby their MPs on a range of issues including the impact of cuts on women, rights of refugee women, the representation of women in parliament, low rape prosecutions and access to childcare. But the issue that appeared to have made many women descend on parliament was a recent call by Jeremy Hunt, secretary of state for health, for the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/06/jeremy-hunt-12-week-abortion-limit\" title=\"\">legal time limit for abortions to be halved</a>. Vera Head, who gave her age as \"old enough\", said in her youth her friend had nearly died because of a backstreet abortion. \"I'm here because I think this generation of younger women don't realise how difficult it was, or how we had to fight for these rights. And Jeremy Hunt hasn't got a clue what women had to go through.\"</p> <p>Louise Morris, 37, had come to the march with her four-month-old daughter Charlotte \u2013 the first either of them had ever been on. \"Childcare, pay equality, opportunity and a lack of women in that big house over there \u2013 these are all feminist issues, they affect me and they affect my daughter\" she said. \"I feel at last I can stand up and do something and try to make a difference.\"</p> <p>Kat Banyard, founder of <a href=\"http://ukfeminista.org.uk/\" title=\"\">UK Feminista</a> who organised the lobby, said that there was never a greater need for women's voices to be heard in the face of cuts and threats to reproductive rights. \"It feels like progress on women's equality has not just slowed down, it has gone into reverse,\" she said. \"Cuts are disproportionately impacting women, abortion rights are under threat, women are still outnumbered four to one in Parliament and 84 years after getting the right to vote thousands of women are still victims of rape every year while the rape conviction rate is stuck at 6%. It's not good enough.\"</p> <p>Several women MPs turned out to support the rally \u2013 including Labour MPs Yvette Cooper and Helen Goodman; Conservative MP Amber Rudd; while Caroline Lucas represented the Green party. Harriet Harman added her voice to the protesters on Parliament Square: \"I strongly support these campaigners. There is this misplaced belief that women have achieved equality and they should just shut up and stop moaning \u2013 but there is a broad movement here that will continue to call for change,\" she said.</p> <p>Following a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2012/oct/21/feminism-fit-for-21st-century\" title=\"\">recent Netmums poll</a> which found that only <a href=\"http://www.netmums.com/home/feminism\" title=\"\">one in seven women surveyed by the parenting website would consider themselves feminists</a>, there were a raft of articles proclaiming \"the death of feminism\" \u2013 an idea many women at the lobby found amusing and wide of the mark. Alex Morgan, 31, who had come to the march with her 17-month-old daughter Abigail and her 70-year-old mother, Catherine, said that many of those who would not identify themselves as feminists would nonetheless support \"feminist\" issues such as access to childcare and equal pay. \"I think lots of people don't understand what feminism means, everyone can be a feminist, men can be feminists. It's sounds radical but it isn't, it's just asking for equality and that shouldn't be too much to ask for.\"</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 25 October 2012. The original said that Helen Pankhurst is Sylvia, rather than Emmeline Pankhurst's great-granddaughter. This has been corrected.</p>",
  "<p>Libyan government forces captured the town of Bani Walid on Wednesday, ending an eight-day battle that has cost at least 20 lives and left more than 200 wounded.</p> <p>The desert town, described by the government as Libya's last stronghold loyal to Muammar Gaddafi, has defied official control since January.</p> <p>Government spokesman Nasser al-Mana'a said the offensive followed a string of kidnappings by gangs in the town and the murder of a former militiaman credited with capturing Gaddafi last year.</p> <p>\"Bani Walid had become a centre for fugitives from justice, kidnappers \u2013 we can say they kidnapped the city,\" he said.</p> <p>Television pictures showed army units backed by pickup trucks carrying anti-aircraft guns being deployed in a town square in the centre. A uniformed pro-government militia commander, Feras Sewehli, said: \"Bani Walid is under government control.\"</p> <p>The president of Libya's parliament, Mohamed el-Magariaf, said human rights were being respected by army forces, after the UN secretary general, Ban Ki-moon called for all sides to show restraint. \"Military operations in Bani Walid do not target the city and its people,\" Magariaf said.</p> <p>The International Committee of the Red Cross reported that 25,000 of the town's estimated 80,000 population have fled to refugee camps outside town because of the fighting, the worst Libya has seen since the end of October 2011.</p> <p>At the weekend, supporters of the rebels in Bani Walid mobs tried to storm the national parliament in Tripoli and wrecked a pro-government television station in Benghazi.</p> <p>Unverified reports from inside the town said there had been massacres, indiscriminate shelling and a poison gas attack but no evidence has yet emerged.</p> <p>Bani Walid's television station remained on air throughout the day, labelling army forces as \"gangsters\" and showing footage of two children, one dead from a head wound and the other missing a foot.</p> <p>\"We went in this morning and captured the town, now all is under control,\" said pro-government fighter Muhsen al-Gubbi. \"We are being careful not to target civilians and not use rockets in civilian areas.\"</p> <p>Earlier this month, the government ordered the army to use \"all necessary means\" to free the kidnapped and arrest criminals and Gaddafi-era officials.</p> <p>Army leaders will be pleased with the control of units built around last year's rebel militias.</p> <p>The offensive saw Misratan units outflank the main defensive positions of Bani Walid. But the reality is Libya remains deeply divided along tribal lines, with Bani Walid and other former pro-Gaddafi towns resisting the new order.</p>",
  "<p>Kasha Nelson, 31, was only supposed to go hiking with a friend. But in the 45 minutes it took to drive from Taos to Ski Valley in northern New Mexico she'd changed her vote. For the last three elections she's voted Democrat, but this time she was leaning towards Romney. \"In 2008 I got caught up in the whole hope and change thing, but I've lost total confidence in Obama's ability to get us out of this mess and I thought, with his business background, Romney might be a different breed of politician.\"</p> <p>She shared her intentions with her friend, a woman in her 20s and in a long-term relationship, who promptly reminded Kasha that she had just had an abortion. Romney's election, and the supreme court nominations that come with it, her friend argued, could take away that choice and criminalise that action. Is that what Kasha wanted? Kasha, who was raised \"very\" Catholic in a trailer in southern Alabama, believes abortion is a necessary evil. She finds the Republicans' social conservatism a \"real turn-off\" but \"has a lot of faith in the independence of the supreme court\".</p> <p>Until then, Kasha had become weary of the way all conversations about the election with her friends would start with discussions about making ends meet and then switch to abortion, contraception and gay marriage as soon as she mentioned she might vote for Romney.</p> <p>She was beginning to feel like her life was stalling and was looking for a leader who could revitalise the economy. Once a bilingual teacher, she took a career break to do a creative writing course in Santa Fe, and was now struggling to get back into the job market. After we finished breakfast she was driving five hours to Denver to take up an office job paying $6,000 less than the teaching job she'd left a few years ago.</p> <p>But when confronted with the direct experience of her friend and the direct consequence of her vote, she felt compelled to reconsider. \"I went back and looked up where Romney stood on the issues on his website and I just decided I couldn't vote for that. My vote couldn't just be about money and jobs.\"</p> <p>There are (to adopt Romney's phrase) \"binders full of women\" who are turned off by the Republicans' policies on reproductive rights. But those binders become even thicker when marital status is taken into account. <a href=\"http://thehill.com/conventions-2012/gop-convention-tampa/gop-convention-columnists/juan-williams/245509-opinion-why-the-republican-party-is-losing-the-battle-for-women-voters\">A summer poll</a> gave Obama a 46-point lead among single women like Kasha and her friend. And almost every year there are more of them. Thanks to feminism and the increased educational opportunities, equality laws and reproductive choices that have come with it, women are <a href=\"http://marriage.about.com/od/statistics/a/medianage.htm\">getting married</a> and <a href=\"http://www.babycenter.com/0_surprising-facts-about-birth-in-the-united-states_1372273.bc\">having children</a> later in life. In 1970, unmarried women comprised 38% of the population; today they are 47%. Kasha's mother got married when she was 19 and had Kasha shortly afterwards. Kasha has other options. She'd like to keep them.</p> <p>It's just one of the examples of the many ways in which Americans live, love, move and behave that is having an impact on the nation's electoral landscape. The US is becoming less white, less religious, more urban and diverse in its living arrangements, and migrating to the south and west. Some of these changes, like the growing strength of the Latino vote or an ageing population heading for the sun belt, are demographic. Last year, for the first time ever, <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2012/05/17/152896230/minorities-are-now-majority-of-u-s-births-census-says\">the majority of babies born in America were not white</a>, presaging a near future where white people will be a minority. Others, like the propensity of people to marry later and for women to remain single longer, are social. Some of these changes are happening very quickly: <a href=\"http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/NEWS/usaedition/2012-04-12-Cohabiting---with-kids---_ST_U.htm\">the proportion of children born out of wedlock</a> from 2006-2010 was double that born in 2002. Others take more time: during that same time span the median age at which American women married increased by less than a year. Many are not immediately obvious. The fastest growing \"religious group\" in the US is those with \"no religious affiliation\". In 1944 they were one in 20; in 2004 they were one in seven; by 2024 they are projected to be at least one in five. But all have political consequences. America is changing far faster and more thoroughly than its electoral rhetoric, strategies and alliances can keep up.</p> <p>\"The tectonic plates of American politics are shifting,\" <a href=\"http://www.americanprogressaction.org/issues/progressive-movement/report/2010/06/16/7953/demographic-change-and-the-future-of-the-parties/\">argues Ruy Teixeira in a 2010 paper</a> Democratic Change and the Future of the Parties for the liberal thinktank, the Center for American Progress. \"A powerful concatenation of demographic forces is transforming the American electorate and reshaping both major political parties. And, as demographic trends continue, this transformation and reshaping will deepen.\"</p> <h2>'Latinos became more moderate'</h2> <p>In few places is this clearer than <a href=\"http://fivethirtyeight.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/06/15/presidential-geography-new-mexico/\">New Mexico,</a> which has gone from the swingiest of states to being safely Democratic in just three election cycles. In 2000, the outcome in New Mexico was closer than Florida: Al Gore took it with a majority of just 366. In 2004 the Republicans won it back with a slightly healthier 5,988 lead. Then in 2008 there was a rout. Obama reclaimed it with a 15-point margin and a lead of 125,590. This year it is not even being contested. The last four polls there have Obama leading by double figures.</p> <p>The most obvious explanation for this would be the rising number of Latinos. Between 2000 and 2010 the state's Latino population grew 24.6%. Between 2000 and 2008 the number of registered Latino voters leaped by 44% and the number of actual Latino voters jumped by 51%. At just over a third New Mexico has the highest proportion of Latino voters of any state in the country.</p> <p>But that explanation, on its own, would be incomplete and incorrect. The number of Hispanics were growing in 2000 and 2004, yet the Republicans won the state back and increased their share of the Latino vote. The numbers continued growing and the state still elected a Republican governor (Susana Martinez, who is Latina) in 2010. So there is nothing inherent about a growing Latino population that makes a Democratic outcome inevitable. True, Latinos tend to be poorer and poor people tend to vote Democrat. <a href=\"http://www.latinodecisions.com/blog/2012/08/24/can-the-republicans-connect-with-latinos-on-abortion-2/\">But Latinos are also more likely to be religious</a> and against abortion than the nation at large too. Republicans have the only two Latino governors in the country \u2013 Martinez and Brian Sandoval in Nevada. After this election cycle they will have more Latino senators than Democrats. Of the five states with the highest proportion of Latinos two, California and New Mexico, are safely Democratic. Two, Arizona and Texas are, for now, safely Republican, and one, Nevada, is a swing state.</p> <p>So demography is not electoral destiny. People vote their interests not their identities and parties mould their platforms to appeal to people's interests. There is nothing inevitable about either. Women are evenly split on the issue of abortion; <a href=\"http://publicreligion.org/research/2012/02/january-tracking-poll-2012/\">polls showed Catholics more likely</a> to demand employers provide healthcare plans that cover birth control at no cost than Protestants. Until the 1980 Republicans were more likely to be pro-choice than Democrats. The complicating factor is that quite often those interests are intertwined with their sense of identity. Wealthy African Americans overwhelmingly vote for Democrats not because they will be better off financially, but because they are turned off by the Republicans' racially charged rhetoric.</p> <p>\"A decade ago there would have been a large number of Latinos who saw themselves as conservative. But they became more moderate as the Republicans moved to the right,\" says Gabriel Sanchez, a professor at the University of New Mexico in Albuquerque. The decline has been quite dramatic. <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/ELECTION/2004/pages/results/states/NM/P/00/epolls.0.html\">In 2004 Bush got 44%</a> of the Latino vote; in 2008 <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/ELECTION/2008/results/polls/#val=NMP00p1\">McCain netted just 30%</a>; a poll released <a href=\"http://www.latinodecisions.com/blog/2012/10/17/new-poll-from-latino-decisions-indicates-that-immigration-matters-to-hispanic-voters-in-new-mexico/\">earlier this week by Latino Decisions</a> suggest just 24% will vote for Romney.</p> <p>The reason New Mexico has turned Democrat isn't just because it became more Latino but because Republicans simultaneously became perceived as more xenophobic. \"Republicans have really leveraged the anti-immigrant rhetoric to appeal to their white nativist base, and in the short term that might work nationally,\" explains Sanchez, who also acts as the director of research for the polling organisation Latino Decisions. \"But in the long term it will have negative effects. They are seen not as anti-immigrant but anti-Latino.\"</p> <h2>'This election is a critical juncture for the Republican party'</h2> <p>California is used as the cautionary tale. Between 1952 and 1988 it voted Republican every time bar one. In 1992 Clinton won it with 46% of the vote but it still had the potential to swing back. In 1994 came Proposition 187, a Republican-backed measure to bar undocumented migrants from healthcare, public education and other services in the state. They won the vote (though the law was found unconstitutional) and lost Latinos. Now, like New Mexico, it's safely Democratic. \"Research show that Latinos who came of voting age during that time are less likely to ever vote Republican again because that is when their image of Republicans was formed. Latinos are not in the bag for Republicans yet. But it could get that way if Republicans don't change.\" If it did, Texas and Arizona would, sooner or later, go the way of New Mexico and California.</p> <p>This is not just a problem locally, but with the entire Republican electoral strategy since the end of the civil rights era \u2013 the last time in fact that there was a seismic shift in the nation's electoral allegiances. Back then Republicans realised that if they could shed their reputation as the party of Lincoln they could peel off a whites in both the south and northern suburbs with a subtle appeal to racial animus. It worked. <a href=\"http://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/\">In 1976, Jimmy Carter</a> won all the former confederate states bar Virginia. By 2000, Al Gore won none, even though he and his father had represented one of them (Tennessee) as senators.</p> <p>Richard Nixon explained the plan to his chief-of-staff, Bob Haldeman, who wrote it in his diary. \"You have to face the fact that the whole problem is really the blacks,\" Nixon told him. \"The key is to devise a system that recognises that while not appearing to.\"</p> <p>When white people made up around 85% of the voters that made sense. But over the past three election cycles alone <a href=\"http://www.pollingreport.com/2000.htm\">the white vote has dropped</a> from 80% in 2000 to 74% in 2008. With 50,000 new Latinos becoming eligible to vote every month, the long-term trend for that white share of the vote will be downward, which means the more black and Latino voters the Republicans alienate, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/sep/09/us-most-racially-polarised-election-white\">the more white voters they need to replace them</a>. \"The demographics race we're losing badly,\" said Republican, senator Lindsey Graham, acknowledging the problem. \"We're not generating enough angry white guys to stay in business for the long term.\"</p> <p>They are trying their best. Romney has a 20-point lead among whites \u2013 the biggest racial gap for almost 30 years. Meanwhile, Joe the Plumber, now a Republican congressional candidate in Ohio, has an original plan for immigration reform. \"Put a fence on the damn border and start shooting,\" he says.</p> <p>But sooner rather than later Republicans will either become more inclusive or less viable. \"This is the last time anyone will try to do this,\" one Republican strategist told the National Journal. And Republican consultant Ana Navarro told the Los Angeles Times: \"Where his [Romney's] numbers are right now, we should be pressing the panic button.\"</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398299839\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/24/1351096694145/abortion-protest-capitol-008.jpg\" alt=\"abortion protest capitol\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Republicans' stance on reproductive rights, like their southern strategy on race, was engineered during the early 1970s with electoral advantage in mind. Photograph: AP</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For in an increasingly polarised electorate loyal constituencies make a big difference. In <a href=\"http://news.yahoo.com/swing-state-demographics-might-sway-2012-election-outcome-221800949.html\">swing states like Nevada, Florida, Virginia and North Carolina</a>, white people comprise less than two-thirds of the population. In Colorado, Latinos make up 20%. Even in states like Ohio, Wisconsin or Iowa, where Latinos make up between 3% and 5% of the population, they can make a difference in a close-run contest.</p> <p>\"This election is a critical juncture for the Republican party,\" says Christine Sierra, heads UNM's Southwest Hispanic Research Institute. \"Latinos would be a more diverse voting bloc if there were reasons to vote Republican. But without those reasons its possible they could become as cohesive a voting bloc as African Americans.\"</p> <p>Republicans' stance on reproductive rights, like their southern strategy on race, was engineered during the early 1970s with electoral advantage in mind. In 1969 George Bush Sr, then a Texas congressman, told the House: \"We need to make family planning a household word. We need to take the sensationalism out of the topic so it can no longer be used by militants \u2026 who are using it as a political stepping stone.\" That same year Nixon said: \"No American woman should be denied access to family planning assistance because of her economic condition.\" But a couple of years later, <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2011/11/14/111114fa_fact_lepore\">as Jill Lepore points out in a New Yorker article</a>, Patrick Buchanan wrote a memo to Nixon advocating using the abortion issue to woo the Catholic vote. \"If the president should publicly take his stand against abortion as offensive to his own moral principles \u2026 then we can force [Ed] Muskie [a failed Democratic presidential candidate in 1972] to make the choice between his tens of millions of Catholic supporters and his liberal friends.\" The next week Nixon spoke of his \"personal belief in the sanctity of human life \u2013 including the life of the yet unborn\".</p> <p>This has served them better among evangelicals than Catholics, but it is causing considerable damage to their reputation among the growing number of educated women and unmarried couples.</p> <p>\"I just think Republicans want to take us backwards to another time,\" says Erica, 37, a school teacher who lives in Taos, New Mexico, where she raises her child alone. \"When they're talking about family values I don't think they're talking about a single mum who's juggling child care and work. I don't think they can related to a single woman in her thirties with some life experience. When you go to Planned Parenthood they don't offer you an abortion as soon as you walk through the door. They talk through your options.\"</p> <p>\"They just seem so tunnel-visioned,\" says Erica, who was raised evangelical in Minnesota. The episode when Rush Limbaugh referred to Georgetown student Sandra Fluke as a \"slut\" and a \"prostitute\" after Fluke spoke in support of mandating insurance coverage for contraception, she says, is a case in point. \"That suggests a larger attitude towards women. I don't know if Romney agrees but a large segment of his party does and he didn't come out and say that's crazy.\"</p> <p>Some progressives believe these trends spell the death knell for the Republican party in its present form. \"The Democratic party will become even more dominated by the emerging constituencies that gave Barack Obama his historic 2008 victory,\" argues Teixeira, author of <a href=\"http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/features/2003/0305.teixeira.html\">The Emerging Democratic Majority</a>. \"While the Republican party will be forced to move toward the centre to compete for these constituencies. As a result, modern conservatism is likely to lose its dominant place in the GOP.\"</p> <p>That's too deterministic. For a start there are countervailing trends. The migration of Americans south and west over the years and <a href=\"http://realclearpolitics.blogs.time.com/2010/12/21/reapportionment-and-the-electoral-college/\">the reapportioning of electoral college seats</a> to accommodate those population movements has helped Republicans. If Obama won the same states this year as he did four years ago he would have six electoral college seats less because the population in the states he won has not risen as fast as in the states he lost. Demography alone over the last decade has handed Republicans the equivalent of Iowa.</p> <p>Moreover, most of the groups Republicans are losing are less motivated than those they have gained. Only 71% of Latinos, 76% of the unmarried and 78% of the non religious <a href=\"http://www.gallup.com/poll/154559/US-Presidential-Election-Center.aspx\">say they will definitely vote</a>. Conversely 86% of whites, 87% of Protestants and 88% of married people say they will. This is why there is such a discrepancy between how Obama fares with registered voters compared to likely voters and why the 'ground game' will in the coming weeks will be so crucial. For all the emphasis on women voters Obama is tied with women likely voters overall and trails white women by 9 points.</p> <p>For the Democrats to take advantage of these changes they have to give people something to vote for and then get them to vote. That's not necessarily as easy as it sounds.</p> <p>Still unable to bring herself to vote for Obama, Kasha cast her ballot early for Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson. \"I'm totally disgusted with the two-party system,\" she says. \"We don't have a good choice, and I don't want to want to compromise. I don't care if the guy I vote for doesn't get to win. I've had enough of just voting out of fear for the other side.\"</p>",
  "<p>Gas flaring in 20 of the world's leading oil-producing countries contributes as much to climate change as a major economy like Italy, <a href=\"http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/TOPICS/EXTOGMC/EXTGGFR/0,,contentMDK:22137498~menuPK:3077311~pagePK:64168445~piPK:64168309~theSitePK:578069,00.html\" title=\"\">new estimates show</a>.</p> <p>While flaring has been cut by 30% since 2005, $50bn worth of gas is still wasted annually, the World Bank said on Wednesday.</p> <p>New satellite analysis of the flares \u2013 that are a by-product of oil drilling and which commonly light the night skies in oil fields around the world \u2013 suggests that bans and fines in some countries and the introduction of technology in newer oil fields has significantly reduced the pollution and waste in some countries, but has failed in others.</p> <p>According to the bank, Azerbaijan has cut flaring by 50% in two years, Mexico by 66% and Kuwait now only flares 1% of its excess gas. Other countries, including Qatar and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, now use large volumes of previously wasted gas to generate electricity .</p> <p>The bank's estimates show that flaring was reduced from 172bn cubic metres a year in 2007 to 142bn cubic metres in 2011. However, most of the reduction came between 2005-07 and only six of the world's big 20 oil-producing countries managed to actually reduce flaring in 2011.</p> <p>The figures show that the momentum to reduce flaring is now levelling off with only 10% overall cuts achieved by the world's top 20 emitters since 2007 despite pledges to drastically reduce flaring.</p> <p>The US, ranked fifth for highest volume in the world's gas flaring league table, increased the amount it flared by nearly 50% in 2010-2011 and has nearly tripled the amount it flares in the last five years largely because of shale oil developments in places like North Dakota. Russia, by far the world's greatest flarer, emitted 37.4bn cubic metres of gas in 2011, 1.8bn cubic metres more than the previous year.</p> <p>The bank urged countries and companies to reduce flaring by at least 30% in the next five years, saying it made financial and developmental sense. \"It's a realistic goal. Given the need for energy in so many countries - one in five people in the world are without electricity - we simply cannot afford to waste this gas any more,\" said Rachel Kyte, World Bank vice-president for sustainable development.</p> <p>\"The direction of travel is right but whether it is at the speed or pace needed is another matter. But no country now does not want to wrestle with this issue,\" she said.</p> <p>\"This major waste of a natural resource can be turned into profitable development investments,\" said Sir Suma Chakrabarti, president of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development.</p> <p>Oil companies agreed that the waste of the gas which could be used for power was a problem, but said that it took time, money and technology, as well as infrastructure developments by host countries to make cuts.</p> <p>\"Flaring is very stupid, for sure. But stopping it is difficult. We are going in the right direction but it takes time,\" said a spokesperson for French oil company Total, which has committed to halving the volume it flares by 2014.</p> <p>Communities and non-governmental organisations in Nigeria responded to the bank's appeal by saying little had been done and alleging people were being killed by the pollution caused by some of the richest countries in the world.</p> <p>\"Gas flares are nothing short of crimes against humanity. They roast the skies, kill crops and poison the air. These gas stacks pump up greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, impacting the climate, placing everyone at risk. Gas flares go on because it is cheap to kill, as long as profits keep on the rise,\" said Nnimmo Bassey, director of Lagos-based Environmental Rights Action and chair of Friends of the Earth International.</p> <p>Nigeria is the world's second largest gas flarer but despite government bans, the federal and state authorities have been unable to force companies to stop. Oil flaring was formally banned in 1984 and declared \"unconstitutional\" by the Nigerian supreme court in 2005, but the new figures show companies on the delta have only reduced flaring 10% since 2007.</p>",
  "<p>Zak Hardaker will make his England debut in the European Championship game against Wales in Wrexham on Saturday, replacing the injured Sam Tomkins at full-back, to complete a remarkably rapid rise over the last two years.</p> <p>The 21-year-old was still playing on the wing for Featherstone Rovers in the Championship early in the 2011 season, having been loaned back to his first professional club by Leeds Rhinos to continue his development. But an injury crisis at Headingley led to him joining the Rhinos full-time much earlier than expected, and he has gone on to establish himself as a regular in their back-line, partly through the versatility he has shown in filling in at centre and full-back.</p> <p>It is in the latter position, where he played in Leeds's Super League Grand Final victory over Warrington this month, that the England coach, Steve McNamara, sees him settling \u2013 and even putting pressure on Tomkins in the buildup to next year's World Cup. \"Obviously Sam's a special talent, but we want competition for every place in the team and Zak is capable of providing that at full-back,\" said McNamara, confirming that Tomkins has still not fully recovered from the groin injury that he suffered in late September.</p> <p>\"He's progressed rapidly over the last couple of seasons with Leeds and I'm looking forward to seeing how he goes.\"</p> <p>Hardaker is likely to be joined by several more debutants for a match England are expected to win comfortably. Kallum Watkins, another member of Leeds's Grand Final winning team, is set to be selected at centre, and McNamara also suggested that Chris Hill's impressive late-season form for Warrington will be rewarded with a place in the pack.</p> <p>He could be joined by Luke Burgess, the former Leeds prop who has proved a surprise hit in Australia since joining his younger brother Sam at South Sydney. The Wigan hooker Michael McIlorum will definitely play after the Rugby Football League agreed to an England request to count last weekend's match between the England Knights and Ireland as the last of a three-match suspension.</p> <p>Rangi Chase, the New Zealand-born half-back who made his England debut in last year's Four Nations series but has withdrawn from this competition with a groin injury, is to stay with Castleford next season. The Tigers had seemed keen to offload Chase, who is comfortably their highest-paid player, to ease their financial problems, leading to interest from a number of other Super League clubs as well as the St George Illawarra Dragons in Australia.</p> <p>But despite qualifying for England on residential grounds he was unable to secure the new visa necessary for a move to Hull, and the news that he is staying provides Castleford with a much-needed boost as they aim to rebuild for next season.</p>",

  "<p>On April 6, the National Movement for the Liberation of Azawad (MNLA) <a href=\"http://www.france24.com/en/20120406-mali-tuareg-mnla-junta-independence-azawad\">declared</a> independence from Mali. Announced from France24's Paris studio, this was the peak of the rebellion's media campaign which came a few short months after the start of the uprising in January. </p> <p>At the time, the MNLA seemed to be the credible voice of the rebels and the Tuaregs, and its demands for an independent state seemed for some the only way to end the marginalisation of northern Mali<strong>'</strong>s nomad populations.</p> <p>Then, fault lines began to appear, and two groups \u2013 Ansar Dine and the Movement of Unity and Jihad in West Africa (MUJWA) \u2013 emerged. Their goal: to make Mali an Islamic and Sharia law-abiding state. These Islamist groups soon turned out to be the real masters of the north, <a href=\"http://www.polgeonow.com/2012/09/azawad-islamists-mali-map.html\">chasing</a> the secular MNLA out of its last stronghold in Douentza on September 1.</p> <p>Looking back, the MNLA may appear to be largely an efficient communication strategy created by a group of idealist intellectuals based in Paris. This band still sends communiqu\u00e9s <a href=\"http://mnlamov.net/\">claiming</a> the \"autonomy of Azawad\", delicately reframing its message to the latest field developments. But despite its declining relevance in northern Mali, the MNLA is more than that.</p> <p>While the MNLA's military victories have been short-lived, members of the movement still <a href=\"http://www.ctc.usma.edu/posts/between-islamization-and-secession-the-contest-for-northern-mali\">maintain</a> contact with Mali's mediator, Burkina Faso's President Blaise Compaor\u00e9, international actors such as the UN and the regional West African grouping ECOWAS, as well as Ansar Dine.</p> <p>Even if the <a href=\"http://www.afp.com/en/news/topstories/african-mali-intervention-weeks-says-france\">upcoming</a> international military mission does not include their input, they are likely to have a say in the reconstruction of northern Mali. In order to ensure this, the MNLA recently launched an initiative to meet with northern community leaders and increase its presence. Several international actors still believe the MNLA to be credible enough, and a somewhat lesser evil to other groups in the region.</p> <h2>The rise of Ansar Dine</h2> <p>The story of the MNLA's military defeats remains obscure, as admitting causes of defeat appears as painful for the MNLA as it is for the Malian army. Some <a href=\"http://www.ocnus.net/artman2/publish/Dark_Side_4/Rebels-Rebel-Against-Each-Other-In-Mali_printer.shtml\">reports</a> suggest the Islamists had infiltrated the MNLA from the beginning; <a href=\"http://www.longwarjournal.org/archives/2012/05/turaeg_rebels_and_al.php\">others</a> claim MNLA fighters were co-opted by Islamists later.</p> <p>Nevertheless, the MNLA remains the sole movement in the Malian conflict strictly defending Tuaregs. The group was <a href=\"http://thinkafricapress.com/mali/causes-uprising-northern-mali-tuareg\">created</a> in late 2011 through the fusion of several smaller movements, and obtained the support of several Tuareg tribal leaders.</p> <p>This is not to say, however, that the MNLA speaks for all Tuaregs. Ansar Dine might have recruited several foreign fighters, but its leader, for example, is a well-known Tuareg nationalist: <a href=\"http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5j2E5T3FzSZKJ-OhCpfHOdsoA0idA?docId=CNG.479d25a6bbe0d8ec222921f745502da0.1f1\">Iyad ag Ghaly</a>.</p> <p>Ag Ghaly led several uprisings in the 1990s and the 2000s before joining the Malian High Council of Territorial Collectivities and later became a nominated consul in Saudi Arabia from 2007 to 2010. Since 2003, he has also acted as a mediator to help free hostages held by Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM).</p> <p>During this time, the man described as \"playing all sides of the Tuareg conflict to maximize personal gain\" during the 2008 rebellion on <a href=\"http://leaks.hohesc.us/?view=08BAMAKO824\">leaked</a> US diplomatic cables <a href=\"http://www.france24.com/en/20120612-northern-mali-peace-dealer-or-wrecker-nine-lives-ansar-dine-chief-iyad-ag-ghali\">became</a> a strong Muslim believer, turning his back on his previous reputation for heavy drinking. Ag Ghaly took part in talks with the MNLA before the assault in January, but launched his own Islamist group, Ansar Dine.</p> <p>The support Ansar Dine's chief has garnered can perhaps be explained to an extent by the Tuareg motto: \"Me against my brother, my brother and me against my cousins, and all the family against the others\". In a complex interplay of social forces in northern Mali, allegiances and alliances do not necessarily last. And fluid tribal connections have played an important role in the current dynamic.</p> <p>In 2007, the Ifoghas' tribal chief Intallah ag Attaher was in a car accident that left him paralysed. \"He did not give up his position, which opened possibilities for protracted internal strife between clans internal to the Ifoghas\", Baz Lecocq, a history professor at Ghent University in Belgium, tells Think Africa Press. Two possible successors opposed: His own son Alghabbas, and Iyad ag Ghaly.</p> <p>Now that the MNLA has been militarily defeated, several Ifoghas have joined Ansar Dine out of loyalty, but several also lured by the leader's war chest. These include Alghabbas ag Intallah, whose father is said to officially support the MNLA. And others could also join Colonel El Hadj Ag Gamou, a Tuareg commander in the Malian Army, and Ag Ghaly's enemy. Alliances can swiftly change as they have in the past.</p> <h2>The Tuareg diaspora</h2> <p>According to UNHCR, more than 200,000 Malians have <a href=\"http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=43224&amp;Cr=refugees&amp;Cr1=#.UIfUMVGB1Jc\">fled</a> to neighbouring countries, with 300,000 internally displaced. Many of those refugees are Tuaregs who left early in the rebellion, in January and February. Several simply went back to the camps where they fled persecutions during the 1990s and 2000s rebellions.</p> <p>Among Mali's half a million Tuaregs or so \u2013 in Mali and the diaspora \u2013 it remains unclear how <a href=\"http://www.fpif.org/blog/islamist_militias_more_popular_-_or_less_unpopular_-_in_mali_than_native_tuaregs\">popular</a> the MNLA is.</p> <p>\"I have cousins that are rebels in the MNLA. I was scared for the life of my family. In 1991 and 1994, during the rebellion, fellow soldiers have slaughtered Tuaregs\", says Aoud Ag Maiga, who fled to the Djibo refugee camp in Burkina Faso when fighting began.</p> <p>Now, his wife and children are in a refugee camp in Mauritania. Even if he feels Tuaregs are marginalised, he is confused now about the independence project and his support of the MNLA. \"We are not racists. We believe in equality. We could all live in a secular state of law and order\", he says.</p> <p>Further away, Binetou Wallet Mohamed Ali, 18, left the University of Bamako in February, where she was supposed to join the Department of English Studies. \"People started to look at me strangely. I did not want to be the first victim\", she says.</p> <p>\"Mali is my country. This is where I am born. I want to go back and study. I don't care much about politics\", she adds.</p> <p>Around the refugee camps, there is little talk about independence and many are traumatised by the stories of hands being cut off and presumed adulterers being whipped in the name of the Sharia back home.</p> <h2>Marginalised again</h2> <p>An independent Azawad does not seem to be a priority among the Tuareg diaspora: \"We want our cattle. We want our land. We want to stop having problems. And we don't want to be ruled by foreigners\", concludes Radwane Ag Ayouba, an old Tuareg of the camp, angrily. He confesses that he is afraid he will be in the camps for a long time and is certain that the repression against Tuaregs will be terrible once the Malian army recovers northern Mali.</p> <p>Elsewhere in the camp, an MNLA emissary gives a political speech talking of \"us, the people of Azawad\". But later, we see him leaving the refugee camps in his Mercedes while the rest of the people of Azawad line up to get humanitarian aid.</p> <p>This is of course a very limited snapshot. It is difficult to truly gauge how popular the MNLA is among the Tuaregs. The conflict has had harsh consequences on the people, who are now divided, scattered, and even more marginalised.</p> <p>The humanitarian agenda is now focused on freeing northern Mali from the Islamists, but soon enough Tuareg grievances will need to return to the agenda. So far, in spite of its failures, the MNLA remains the only organisation able to speak for them.</p> <p><em>Marc-Andr\u00e9 Boisvert is a freelance journalist and researcher who lives in Abidjan, C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, and specialises in civilian-military relations in western Africa </em></p>",
  "<p>Ending \"trafficking\" is perhaps the most well-known, well-resourced, well-loved social cause of the 21st century that doesn't require its proponents' agreement on what it even is they wish to end. What is \"trafficking\"? How many people are \"trafficked\"? Look beyond the surface of the fight against trafficking, and you will find misleading statistics and decades of debate over laws and protocols. As for the issue itself, the lack of agreement on how to define \"trafficking\" hasn't slowed campaigners' fight. Rather, defining trafficking has become their fight.</p> <p>Over the last 15 years, anti-trafficking campaigns have ascended to the most visible ranks of feminist, faith and human rights missions, enjoying support from organizations as ideologically unneighborly as women's rights NGO Equality Now and the conservative thinktank the Heritage Foundation. The dominant contemporary understanding of trafficking took hold only around the turn of the century, driven in significant part by the advocacy of women's rights groups who sought to redefine trafficking specifically as the \"sexual exploitation\" of women and children. Indeed, this is the definition that groups like the Coalition Against Trafficking in Women succeeded in getting written into the <a href=\"http://www.uncjin.org/Documents/Conventions/dcatoc/final_documents_2/convention_%20traff_eng.pdf\">first international laws (pdf)</a> related to trafficking. When many people hear about \"trafficking\", this is the picture that comes to mind, and it is one that women's rights groups \u2013 and, increasingly, evangelical Christian groups like Shared Hope International, International Justice Mission and Love146 \u2013 use explicitly in their campaigning.</p> <p>In fact, it is with the influence of these groups that the issue of trafficking itself began to migrate: from relative obscurity, to sessions at the United Nations, to highways in the United States, where drivers now find anti-trafficking billboards featuring shadowy photographs of young girls, images meant to \"raise awareness\". Using such images in service of ending \"sexual exploitation\" may seem contradictory, as the girls photographed are presented in what would otherwise seem to be a quasi-pornographic setting. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/melissagira/status/244241917905346560\">A billboard I passed by last August on the interstate in Louisiana</a> showed a girl who looked sweaty and wide-eyed \u2013 only, with the words \"'NOT FOR SALE: END HUMAN TRAFFICKING\" stamped in red over her face.</p> <p>But what \u2013 and who \u2013 is being fought in what is pictured here?</p> <p>Accurate statistics on trafficking are difficult to come by, which does not stop some anti-trafficking groups from using them anyway. For instance, Shared Hope International, which is aggressively pursuing anti-trafficking legislation in 41 US states, claims \"<a href=\"http://www.sharedhope.org/WhatWeDo/Prevent/CommunityAwareness/DoyouknowLacy.aspx\">at least 100,000 juveniles are victimized</a>\" each year in the United States, and possibly as many as 300,000 \u2013 a figure that has been cited (<a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2011/CRIME/01/23/siu.selling.girl.next.door.judge/index.html?iref=allsearch\">repeatedly</a>) by CNN. In truth, the figure is an estimate from a <a href=\"http://www.sp2.upenn.edu/restes/CSEC_Files/Complete_CSEC_020220.pdf\">University of Pennsylvania report from 2001 (pdf)</a> of how many youth are \"at-risk\" of what its authors call \"commercial sexual exploitation of a child\", based on incidences of youth homelessness. But it was not a <em>count</em> of how many youth are victims of \"trafficking'\", or involved in the sex trade.</p> <p>Prostitution is often conflated with \"trafficking\" in these statistics, in part because the definition of trafficking that has been pushed to prominence refers exclusively to \"sexual exploitation\". In fact, this conflation has found its way into the collection of data: according to a report from the <a href=\"http://www.gaatw.org/\">Global Alliance Against Trafficking in Women</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"[W]hen statistics on trafficking are available, they usually refer to the number of migrant or domestic sex workers, rather than cases of trafficking.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>This purposeful conflation of sex work and trafficking distinguishes the many feminist and faith-based anti-trafficking groups that focus on sex-trafficking from groups that work directly with people who are involved in forced labor of all kinds, whether or not it involves sex work. This schism over who gets to define trafficking is about to come to a head <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/editorials/la-ed-end-prop35-20121010,0,4382854.story\">for California voters in the form of Proposition 35</a>, which, if passed this November, will set higher criminal penalties and fines for those who commit what the authors of the bill define as sex-trafficking, as opposed to labor trafficking. It will also force those convicted of \"trafficking\" to register as sex offenders and submit to lifelong internet monitoring \u2013 whether or not sex or the internet were involved in their case.</p> <p>There is no question that California is home to several industries where, <a href=\"http://freedomnetworkusa.org/what-is-human-trafficking/human-trafficking-basics/\">according to the Freedom Network</a> (whose member organizations employ a human rights-based approach to anti-trafficking work), forced labor is known to occur: agricultural work, restaurant work, construction work, hotel work, garment work and sex work. But what unites the workers in these industries is not \"commercial sexual exploitation\", but the erosion of labor protections and the toughening-up of immigration policies \u2013 which makes many more people vulnerable to coercion and abuse. Cindy Liou, staff attorney at the <a href=\"http://www.apilegaloutreach.org/trafficking.html\">Asian Pacific Islander Legal Outreach</a>, a Northern California-based project that has worked with hundreds of survivors of human trafficking, is advocating for Californians to vote no on this proposition. </p> <blockquote> <p>\"It redefines trafficking in a way that's incorrect, confusing, and terrible. It's highly problematic because it does this at the expense of all trafficking victims \u2013 it ignores labor trafficking victims.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>In fact, so-called \"sex-trafficking\" constitutes only a small percentage of all forced labor, <a href=\"http://www.ilo.org/sapfl/Informationresources/ILOPublications/WCMS_181953/lang--en/index.htm\">as estimated by the International Labor Organization</a>. In their 2012 report, the ILO categorizes \"forced sexual exploitation\" as distinct from other kinds of forced labor, which, in some ways, is helpful as not all forced labor involves sex, and in other ways, adds more confusion to the issue (because what distinguishes \"sex-trafficking\" from sexual abuse is its occurrence within a workplace or work relationship). Still, of the nearly 21 million people the ILO estimates are forced laborers, 4.5 million are estimated to be what the ILO calls \"victims of forced sexual exploitation\" \u2013 that is, over three-quarters of the people around the globe estimated to be in forced labor are <em>not</em> involved in \"forced sexual exploitation\". By contrast, the ILO estimates that 2.2 million people worldwide are forced laborers in prisons or in the military \u2013 people whose stories we are quite unlikely to find on a highway billboard.</p> <p>But, as in the furor over \"sex-trafficking\", it would be wrong to let the volume of public outcry stand in for how significant a problem it is \u2013 however that issue is defined or ill-defined. Similarly, the push for \"real numbers\" can also lead us further into the ideological morass that itself defines the trafficking issue. Jo Doezema, a researcher with the Paulo Longo Research Initiative and author of Sex Slaves and Discourse Masters: The Construction of Trafficking, cautions:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"[E]ven a recognition that disputes over the meaning of trafficking involve politics and ideology does not go far enough: it still leaves intact the idea that trafficking can be defined satisfactorily, if political will, clear thinking, and practicality prevail.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>That is, there can be no assessment of the severity of \"trafficking\" if we define this issue by a simple and coherent accounting of \"victims\". What's lost in the relentless defining and counting are the complex factors behind what is now almost unquestioningly called \"trafficking\". Most of all, what is lost is any understanding or appreciation of the challenges faced by the millions of people working, struggling and surviving in abusive conditions, whose experiences will never fit on a billboard.</p> <p><em>\u2022 Editor's note: the photo caption originally stated that the ILO survey referred to trafficking victims; in fact, it refers to victims of forced labor, which may include trafficking victims, but it did not specifically attempt to count those.

  "<p>Food, the bedrock of life and the foundation of our physical, spiritual and emotional wellbeing, is at the heart of many of the critical environmental and social challenges we face in the 21st century. And the need for addressing the interlinked challenges of hunger and sustainability must be among our top priorities.</p> <p>Put this in the context of a population that will reach some 9 billion by 2050 and changing dietary patterns, particularly in China and parts of the Far East, and the challenge becomes even more daunting. Land and water are key limiting factors here; agriculture already dominates two thirds of ice-free land and continues to be a key driver of habitat and ecosystem loss across the globe. Global forest loss is continuing at a rate of some 130,000 sq km/year, equivalent to an area roughly the size of England and we are literally eating into the natural capital on which our agricultural system depends.</p> <p>Over the last 50 years or so agriculture has arguably served us well in terms of meeting the needs of providing food for growing populations with shifting dietary needs, with many of us spending significantly less of our weekly pay packets, proportionately, on our shopping baskets. This has of course been at a cost, with our natural resource base used at unsustainable rates.</p> <p>So how does global agriculture need to adapt to the challenges of the future and move towards sustainable practices? I would argue that we need to focus on principles that can be applied to many farming systems rather than a never ending and sometimes polarised debate about which farming system is best suited to feed the world within environmental limits.</p> <p>There is never going to be a single silver bullet and sustainable farming systems of the future are going to need to reflect very different political, cultural and social situations. Whether these are organic farmers or inorganic farmers, small scale subsistence farmers in Africa or larger scale farms in the American mid-west, they will all have an important role to play.</p> <p>Sustainable farming systems need to encompass three key factors. They need to be environmentally sound, socially responsible and economically viable. By taking this approach, all farming systems need to consider a certain set of basic principles, which will of course vary slightly depending on context, but may help us set a direction of travel towards more sustainable practices.</p> <p>From an environmental perspective, for example, these could include the need for farming systems to address soil health and erosion, carbon sequestration, waste production or to consider agro-ecological processes that employ closed loop cycles within the farm wherever possible to limit inputs and reduce waste. Examples here include nutrient cycling (macro and micro), biological nitrogen fixation, predation and symbiosis.</p> <p>Another obvious principle would be reducing environmental impacts and enhancing our natural capital, building on key environmental services on which our food system depends. From a social perspective, using this principles based approach, farming systems may still need to address issues such as respecting the rights of local people \u2013 rights to land, water, food and access to markets and the right to decision making.</p> <p>Strengthening the protection of the human rights of land users, including internationally-recognised labour standards and improved outcomes for marginalised groups within the food system (particularly women and children in developing countries through education and empowerment) would be another obvious social principle which should underpin sustainable farming systems.</p> <p>Economically, farming systems could follow principles based on the need for resilient, efficient, productive and profitable farms which provide fair returns to farm labour, land and invested capital. There are potentially many more principles that could apply here and I have just given a few potential examples, but surely this is the most appropriate way forward?</p> <p>The principle of reducing closed loop systems and reducing waste is also an obvious one that applies to all farming methods. One of the biggest issues confronting small scale farmers in Africa, for example, is the issue of post-harvest losses, due to lack of adequate storage facilities or poor access to local markets. While in theory the solutions on the ground seem obvious in practice it's far more complex; farmers often struggle to access advice or more importantly microfinance schemes to build grain storage facilities.</p> <p><strong>Examples on the ground</strong></p> <p>There are many great examples of sustainable farming systems in practice. WWF is working with farmers, scientists and national institutions <a href=\"http://wwf.panda.org/wwf_news/?uNewsID=114481\" title=\"\">in India to promote a System of Rice Intensification</a> (SRI) as an option to reduce pressure on freshwater ecosystems and improve food production and the profitability of rice farmers involved.</p> <p>Rice is a staple food for more than half of the world's population. In Asia alone, more than 2 billion people obtain 60-70% of their calories from rice and its products. Rice farmers, big and small, play a crucial role in ensuring global food security. After all, it is farmers in the developing world who are the key to solving hunger crisis in the developing world, using sustainable methods of production most appropriate to their needs.</p> <p>Politicians, governments, businesses and civil society need to work more collaboratively to find principles based solutions. This approach may require a new emphasis on issues such as knowledge exchange, so that there is better co-ordinated research efforts and improvements to the way in which research and advice is shared or exchanged throughout the food, farming and environment sectors and between the developed and developing world.</p> <p>The issue of integrated pest management and minimum tillage is an example here where research suggests that this can deliver both environmental and economic benefits. What is required is knowledge exchange mechanisms that can look at improved understanding and uptake of these.</p> <p>Across all farming systems, we should be talking about efficiency of production or productivity measured in terms of output per unit input, linked to rewarding producers with fair prices and for a range of other environmental and social goods and services. There has been much recent debate about exactly how much we need to increase production to feed the world in the future; whether its 10% or 60%, one of the key challenges in terms of global food security is access to and distribution of this food.</p> <p>Today we produce enough food in the world to feed everyone with a nutritious and adequate diet. Ultimately of course, we will only move to fairer and more sustainable farming systems globally if we address some of the structural barriers that will enable farmers across the world to do this \u2013 and here of course the role of food businesses, the retail sector and governments are key.</p> <p><em>Mark Driscoll is </em><a href=\"http://www.wwf.org.uk/what_we_do/about_us/building_a_one_planet_future.cfm\" title=\"\"><em>WWF-UK's One Planet</em></a><em> Food Lead</em></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by </strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/guardian-professional\" title=\"\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

  "<p>The <a href=\"http://www.prixpictet.com/\" title=\"\">Prix Pictet</a> is possibly the world's greatest photography prize. In just four years it has become like an Oscar or Nobel prize for stills photographers. It is backed by a private bank, so the cheque for 100,000 Swiss Francs prize is unlikely to bounce.</p> <p>The competition is only open to people nominated by others, attracts the very best entries and the pictures chosen by the judges travel the world for a year in a major exhibition. (Don't think about buying them, though: Pictet has helped elevate pictures of the environment into mainstream \"art\", but a set of any of this year's shortlisted photographers will set you back \u00a310,000 or more.)</p> <p>After water, earth and growth over the last few years, this year's theme was power, and earlier this month the 12 shortlisted photographers showcased some of their work at the Saatchi gallery in Chelsea. The <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/artanddesign/2012/oct/09/luc-delahaye-wins-2012-prix-pictet-award\" title=\"\">main prize was won by Luc Delahaye</a> for a selection of pictures covering the tsunami, Dubai, the World Economic Forum and Opec. It is a brilliant body of work compiled over eight years around the institutions that pull the levers of power and the victims of war and natural disaster.</p> <p>But of the 11 other shortlisted photographers, six submitted pictures of physical environments that have been bruised or violently damaged by industrial power. They included pictures from the 2010 Gulf oil spill, the aftermaths of Chernobyl and Fukushima and destruction of forests.</p> <p>In the words of Stephen Barber, group managing director of the bank Pictet &amp; Cie and founder of the prize:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"Here is art with purpose, art with power to penetrate every sphere of human activity, art with the energy to open the most jaded eye to the catastrophe that creeps upon us or art to document the sleepwalk to cataclysm.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Together, the pictures illustrate the war - there is no other word - being waged by global industry on the environment.</p> <p>Daniel Beltra's pictures of the BP oil spill, first commissioned by Greenpeace, show abstract beauty and seductive horror side-by-side in the Gulf of Mexico. His images of a coral green, oil-stained sea, ablaze with the violent colours of dispersants, illustrate the tiny scale of the clean-up and the gorgeousness of the water.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398275977\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Environment/Pix/columnists/2012/10/19/1350665671215/Prix-Pictet-2012--Daniel--008.jpg\" alt=\"Prix Pictet 2012 : Daniel Beltra\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Oil Spill #1 by Daniel Beltra.

But reading between the lines, this may be the last Pictet to focus on the damage that man has done. In an afterword in the accompanying book, Barber makes the case for expanding the \"mission\" of the award to embrace not just \"environment\" but \"more general questions of sustainability\".</p> <p>This could prove a dangerous road because \"sustainability\" can mean all things to all people. The judges of the Pictet and its advisory board - largely investment managers, business journalists, bank employees and art collectors including Leo Johnson, the brother of the mayor of London, Boris Johnson, a former PricewaterhouseCoopers partner - come largely from that section of the international art and business establishment that has paid little attention so far to climate change or the great environment issues of our time, and who just might welcome a change from these uncomfortable images.</p> <p>Five years ago, writes Barber, \"with the world economy expanding with abandon and easy money in abundant supply, environmental activism seemed not only affordable, but a convenient expiation for our sins of overconsumption. But as the financial crisis took hold, the pieties of the environment lobby came to be seen as extravagant scaremongering\".</p> <p>Well, that may be true in the charmed European, American and British financial corridors of power that created the crisis, but Pictet's directors should need no reminding that the war goes on and those on the frontline would certainly not agree.</p>",

If we lived in a fair and just world it would have been girl group 2NE1's amazing <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUrUPzLm5SI\">I Love You</a> or 4Minute's <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsWl1--Niyg\">Volume Up</a> that would have traversed the language barrier and scored a worldwide hit, rather than Psy and his LMFAOisms. In fact, if anyone could follow Psy's success it would be 4Minute's very own HyunA, who not only produced one of 2011's greatest songs with <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bw9CALKOvAI\">Bubble Pop!</a> but also has a cameo in Gangnam Style, a video that's now been watched 532m times. Psy returns the favour in the day-glo video for HyunA's Ice Cream, the first single to be taken from her new EP, Melting. Making <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kXFcr6oy5dk\">Nicki Minaj's recent effort</a> look like a grey day in Southend, HyunA struts her way through a hyper-real, neon-hued world of ice cream trucks, unspecified protests (at one point she mows down a clown) and some slightly NSFW goings on in a room with some foam (the video has a 15 certificate in Korea). While the song doesn't quite match the heights of Bubble Pop!, it's huge fizzing synths (reminiscent of Britney's Do Somethin') and sheer volume of hooks \u2013 in both Korean and English \u2013 should worm their way into your cranium after about a minute.</p>",

  "<p>You only have to pick up a Lakeland catalogue to see that our relationship with kitchen gadgets has got out of hand. Mango destoners, two-tone icing bags, fruit and vegetable cushions for your salad box to \"improve air circulation\" - these are not exactly essential items.</p> <p>We can all think of examples of more or less pointless culinary kit, and odds are, we have a few ourselves lurking at the back of an overstuffed kitchen drawer: the melon-baller, the egg-slicer, the garlic-peeler. Utensils like this make me think: what was wrong with a spoon, a knife, or fingers? All too often, a new gadget seems designed to replace a cooking skill that we have lost. When you know how to use a paring knife, you have no call for strawberry hullers.</p> <p>On the other hand, a tool is only worthless if you don't use it. If you regularly make retro fruit salads, a melon baller might be your trustiest companion. I often hear cooks disparage waffle makers as a waste of space; but that's because (poor them) they don't eat stacks of crispy buttery waffles for weekend breakfast. One person's cherry pitter is another person's <a href=\"http://www.georgeforeman.co.uk/Specials_qc_8.html?gclid=CLO7\">Lean Mean Grilling Machine</a>.</p> <p>The modern glut of kitchen gadgetry is not such a bad thing if you view it in context. For most of history, there were no labour saving devices. Why? Because there was little incentive to save labour when the labour in question was not your own \u2013 when meals were prepared by wives and servants. A <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Le_M%C3%A9nagier_de_Paris\">14th century recipe</a> for pancakes asks for the batter to be beaten long enough to \"weary one person or two\". This is a chilling image, summoning up a kitchen in which underlings are arrayed like so many utensils. When one was worn out, another would step forward. Now, if I want to make crepes, I can reach into my overstuffed kitchen drawer and blitz the batter for a few seconds using an electric hand held blender. I call that progress.</p> <p>Some of the best kitchen inventions are ancient. Pestles and mortars were in common use 10,000 years ago. The Romans had <a href=\"http://www.dkimages.com/discover/Home/Food-and-Drink/Cooking/Utensils/Cheese-Graters/Cheese-Graters-02.html\">cheese graters</a>, <a href=\"http://www.britishmuseum.org/research/search_the_collection_database/search_object_details.aspx?objectid=464060&amp;partid=1&amp;searchText=roman+colander&amp;fromADBC=ad&amp;toADBC=ad&amp;numpages=10&amp;orig=%2fresearch%2fsearch_the_collection_database.aspx&amp;currentPage=1\">colanders</a>, elaborate steamers and frying pans. The balloon whisk, still a functional as well as beautiful kitchen object, <a href=\"http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=-HStec87HdcC&amp;pg=PT295&amp;lpg=PT295&amp;dq=gillian+riley+whisk+scappi&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=zHtObVZBFh&amp;sig=CocTPR4jaPVti4OWOwCVdea2wHc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=mKKGUM7BGNGA0AXG6YCQCA&amp;ved=0CC8Q6AEwAg\">dates back to Italy in the sixteenth century</a>. But this appearance of continuity is deceptive. We easily forget that the kitchen itself \u2013 a purpose-built room in which to cook \u2013 was something that very few people had until the 20th century. In the one-room dwellings that most humans cooked and lived in, the kitchen was everywhere and nowhere. Smoke from the cooking fire dominated everything, but the utensils were few: a soot-black cauldron, perhaps, a gridiron for toasting and a few spoons and dishes.</p> <p>Viewed from this perspective, the sheer abundance of our kitchenware shops seems glorious as well as absurd. The clash of lime green and fuchsia pink bakeware signals the fact that cooking can now be a way to play rather than a source of drudgery or pain. We can summon ice and fire at will. We can grind things at the press of a button that would once have needed hair sieves and an army of servants to achieve. And alongside the frankly superfluous gizmos \u2013 cupcake makers, electric herb choppers and the like \u2013 are some genuinely useful breakthroughs. It's a small thing, but <a href=\"http://www.oxo.com/p-223-swivel-peeler.aspx\">good vegetable peelers</a> \u2013 ones that efficiently remove a thin layer of peel without gouging your hand - have only been in our lives since 1990. Similarly, we have been drinking coffee in Britain for 360 years, but only since 2005 have we been able to use the brilliant <a href=\"http://www.google.co.uk/products/catalog?q=Aeropress&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;cid=4244798419831759569&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=nJ6GUJrPG9KX0QXLq4HIBA&amp;ved=0CDEQ8wIwAQ\">Aeropress</a>, a non-electric device that pushes the coffee through a tube using air pressure \u2013 my new kitchen favourite.</p> <p>So, tell me, which are the kitchen inventions you couldn't live without - and which would you relegate to the back of the cupboard?</p>",
  "<p>Lady Gaga will be immortalised in the name of a newly identified genus of fern. Researchers at Duke University in North Carolina have given 19 different species of fern the genus \"Gaga\", in recognition of the singer's \"fervent defence of equality and individual expression\".</p> <p>By honouring Lady Gaga in this way, the academics have doubtless paved the way for a series of fern-based costumes. Indeed, study leader <a href=\"http://today.duke.edu/2012/10/gagafern\" title=\"\">Kathleen Pryer said the decision</a> was inspired by Gaga's outfit at the 2010 Grammy awards: <a href=\"http://www.focusonstyle.com/blog/lady-gaga-and-giorgio-armani-prive-at-the-grammy-s-a-spectacular-fashion-collaboration/\" title=\"\">her heart-shaped Armani Prim\u00e9 getup</a> apparently recalled the bisexual reproductive stage of these ferns. It was even, Pryer observed, the appropriate shade of green.</p> <p>While 17 of the ferns are simply being recategorised from the genus <em>Cheilanthes</em>, two are new discoveries: <em>Gaga germanotta</em>, found in Costa Rica, has been baptised with a reference to the musician's real name; <em>Gaga monstraparva</em>, from Mexico, gets its moniker from the Latin for \"little monster\" \u2013 Gaga's term for her fans.</p> <p>\"As we started to consider [naming them after Gaga], the ferns themselves gave us more reasons why it was a good choice,\" <a href=\"http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/10/23/germinated-this-way-new-fern-species-named-after-lady-gaga/?ref=music\" title=\"\">Pryer said</a>. At least one species, for example, has the sequence \"GAGA\" among its DNA base pairs. The ferns also have \"somewhat fluid definitions of gender\" and can even self-fertilise to spawn a new fern.</p> <p>More importantly, Pryer and her colleagues are big fans of Gaga's songs. \"We often listen to her music while we do our research,\" She said. \"We think that her second album, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/may/18/lady-gaga-born-this-way-review\" title=\"\">Born This Way</a>, is enormously empowering, especially for disenfranchised people and communities like LGBT, ethnic groups, women \u2013 and scientists who study odd ferns!\"</p> <p>In September, scientists at the University of Thailand gave Lady Gaga's name to a newly identified species of parasitic wasp, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/science/2012/sep/16/new-to-nature-aleiodes-gaga\" title=\"\"><em>Aleiodes gaga</em></a>.</p>",

Twenty-four hours after the sighting he had heard, through the wife of another officer, of a crew member \"posting something on their Facebook page to the effect that they saw a 'dead critter' yesterday but are being censored by NOAA from saying anything else \u2026 followed by a lot of indignant comments from others.\"</p> <p>The attempt to shut out the media also sat uneasily with Greenpeace.</p> <p>NOAA <a href=\"http://www.noaanews.noaa.gov/stories2010/20100617_whale.html\" title=\"\">did put out a press release about the dead whale</a>. However, the release was edited and shortened in a way which appeared to minimise the effects of oil on whales.</p> <p>\"The public has no idea what the fate of those animals is,\" Davies said.</p> <p>That information may never surface. There were believed to be about 1,200 sperm whale in the Gulf of Mexico at the time of the spill, making it one of the biggest populations in the world.</p> <p>However, scientists concede little is known about how whales respond to oil spills \u2013 even in an area as heavily mined as the Gulf of Mexico. Few whales strand on land, and it is practically impossible to carry out necropsies at sea.</p> <p>\"We do know that oil spills do kill whales but we know very little about how lethal they are and what makes them lethal,\" said Hal Whitehead, cetacean research biologist at Dalhousie University in Nova Scotia. \"The whales that are there or used to be there move around a fair amount so if they weren't actively avoiding the spill there is a good chance that quite a large proportion of them might have gone into it.\"</p> <p>NOAA scientists, working with Oregon State University, have been tracking a number of sperm whale in the Gulf of Mexico through satellite transmitters since the spill. \"There isn't at least anything published that has clear linkages between sperm whale that got covered in oil and died in the same way,\" said Bruce Mates who heads the marine mammal institute at Oregon State.</p> <p>And with the one whale carcass recovered so far, scientists were not able to establish the definitive cause of death.</p> <p>\"Scientists did take samples from the carcass, but because the animal was so badly decomposed the cause of death could not be determined,\" Smullen said.</p> <p>Indeed, Smullen said he was unable even to confirm whether the whale had even been exposed to BP oil, writing: \"Due to ongoing litigation issues, we are not able to discuss this aspect of our investigation.\"</p>",

  "<p>The Home Office has downgraded the threat to London and other targets in England from republican terror groups opposed to the Northern Ireland peace settlement from \"substantial\" to \"moderate\".</p> <p>It follows a downturn in terror attacks within Northern Ireland and the continued inability of anti-ceasefire republicans to mount strategic terror attacks in Britain.</p> <p>But the Home Office has warned that the threat level within Northern Ireland itself remains dangerous with the chance of attack in the province described as \"severe\".</p> <p>Much of the reason for the downgrade in threat to England from the likes of the Continuity IRA and a merged terror group <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/jul/26/ira-northern-ireland-dissident-republican-groups\" title=\"\">styling itself as a new IRA</a> is due to security operations in the Irish Republic. In recent months the Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na has mounted several arrest operations aimed at disrupting dissident republican activity.</p> <p>Last week it arrested nine suspects across the state who garda\u00ed believed were connected to the new IRA \u2013 a hardline republican umbrella group made of up the Real IRA, independent republican units and Republican Action Against Drugs in Derry. The so-called new IRA has also been diverted into an increasingly bloody feud with armed criminal gangs who shot dead the former Real IRA \"commander\" of Dublin earlier this autumn.</p> <p>During the IRA's campaign between 1969 and 1997 the Provisionals used the Republic as their main logistical base to transport bombs across the Irish Sea into Britain and further afield. While large bombs such as the one in London's Bishopsgate in 1993 and Canary Wharf three years later were built by IRA engineers from south Armagh and were transported to London using personnel from units along the border, the Republic was used as a gateway to smuggle the devices over to England.</p> <p>Much of the Garda success in thwarting the various factions of dissident republicanism is down to human intelligence. The force has been active in recruiting and running informants within all the main terror groups opposed to the peace process.</p>",

Before, we had Gaddafi's army. Now we have armed militias killing women and children. They have been surrounding the city for 20 days but within the last five days they got crazy and have made our lives here a real hell.</p> <p>There is no safe place to hide in Bani Walid. I was in opposition to Gaddafi and was imprisoned in Abu Salim prison for a long time, but I regret every moment I opposed Gaddafi after what I have seen here.</p> <p>These armed militias are so barbarian, they are committing crimes against humanity and no one is recognising that.

It is already in an appalling situation and lacks most of the basic medical stuff. Water and power are cut but people have stored food at home.</p> <p>Some of the families started to flee to escape the shelling. More than 50,000 people left but the route outside the city is a rocky and desert one and really hard to go through with children. Other families decided to stay for fear of robbery. People are worried to leave their houses and come back to find everything is stolen.</p> <p>I left during the liberation war but when I came back I found my car was stolen. This time I am staying and will die in my home. We call upon the humanitarian society to come and help us as the city is entirely sealed off and even fleeing is not safe.</p> <p>This is an act of revenge and racism. People have decided to defend their homes and honour with the arms they have and I can assure you if the situation continues like that, Libya will slip to a civil war eventually.</p> <p>They are destroying an entire city but people will not keep silent, there are more than 53 tribes in Bani Walid and they have decided to die for their land.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-10-24T13:44:24.479Z\">at 2.44pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5087d818b5794584b1c13ed2\" class=\"block is-summary\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-24T11:59:20.282Z\">12.59pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Summary</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Today's main news is that international envoy Lakhdar Brahimi says he has agreement from the Syrian government on a ceasefire for the Muslim holiday of Eid al-Adha which begins on Friday.</strong></p> <p><strong>Brahimi also says \"most\" of the anti-Assad fighting groups that he has been able to contact agree on \"the principle\" of a ceasefire.</strong></p> <p><strong>The Syrian government has yet to confirm its agreement, and there have been widespread doubts as to whether a ceasefire can take hold or be sustained.</strong></p> <p>Other Syria-related news:</p> <p>\u2022 At least 20 people are reported to have died when Syrian artillery gunners shelled a bread bakery full of workers and customers in Aleppo on Tuesday.</p> <p>\u2022 Government aircraft attacked Maaret al-Numan and the village of Mar Shamsheh yesterday, as troops and rebels battled over a nearby Syrian military camp that has been under siege for days, AP reports citing the British-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.</p> <p>\u2022 Syrian rebels have acquired portable surface-to-air missiles including US-made Stingers, the Interfax news agency quoted Russia's senior general as saying today.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-10-24T11:59:58.159Z\">at 12.59pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5087d2ecb5794584b1c13ecd\" class=\"block is-summary\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-24T11:37:16.693Z\">12.37pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Concern over move to deport Syrian</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Amnesty International is \"deeply alarmed\" at an attempt by the UK Border Agency to forcibly return a Syrian activist to Damascus.</p> <p>\"The planned removal was due to take place on 21 October, but was prevented in the high court, due in part to Amnesty\u2019s intervention in the case,\" Amnesty says in <a href=\"http://www.amnesty.org.uk/news_details.asp?NewsID=20396\">a statement</a> issued today.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Amnesty provided information about the current human rights crisis in Syria and expressed grave concerns about conditions in the country and fears for the safety of the individual if returned.</p> <p>As far as Amnesty is aware, no other EU countries are currently returning Syrian asylum seekers to Syria.</p> <p>Amnesty told the court that people who oppose or are perceived to oppose the government are at risk of persecution or serious harm by the authorities if returned to Syria.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-10-24T13:45:46.746Z\">at 2.45pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5087cf4e95cb4897f0db524c\" class=\"block is-summary\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-24T11:21:50.197Z\">12.21pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">A 'last chance' for Syria?</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>A ceasefire in Syria, if it happens, must be welcome even for three days to stem the bloodshed and perhaps provide a platform to exit this crisis, says Chris Doyle, director of the Council for Arab-British Understanding.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>However, this remains distant, as there is no final decision by the regime and it may well be banking on its opponents rejecting a deal, just to gain positive PR for Assad.</p> <p>If there is a genuine prospect that a ceasefire will hold then the international community must act to shore it up with a much larger monitoring force than in the past, local ceasefire deals and a resolute consensus by Syrian, regional and international actors not to undermine it.&#xa0;</p> <p>It should be reinforced by full humanitarian access and release of prisoners.

  "<p>During <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/conservative/9597741/David-Cameron-at-Conservative-conference-as-it-happened.html\" title=\"\">his speech at the Conservative party conference</a>, the prime minister reiterated his commitment to reforming public services, saying that unreformed public services are a key hallmark of countries \"on the slide\".</p> <p>The government's programme for reform intends to make public services more creative and innovative. As the voluntary sector has decades of experience in identifying, addressing and preventing inequalities, I see voluntary organisations as well-placed to improve both the design and delivery of many public services. And this involvement is vital for the voluntary sector. In many cases, it is the best way for organisations to achieve their mission, as it means they can provide direct support to beneficiaries.</p> <p>To enable this, I believe that lessons should be learned from real experiences. Take the <a href=\"http://www.bacaproject.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Baca project in Leicestershire</a>, which designs and delivers servicestargeting the needs of 15 to 19-year-olds trafficked in the UK or seeking asylum. They have found it difficult fully to capture the benefits of their unique services in the box of a contract tender document. Or <a href=\"http://www.westmerciaprobation.org.uk/\" title=\"\">West Mercia Probation Trust</a>which is successfully <a href=\"http://www.westmerciaprobation.org.uk/page.php?Plv=1&amp;P1=17\" title=\"\">working in partnership with youth charity YSS</a> to jointly explore new potential services to help reduce reoffending.</p> <p>Yet to enable charities to provide these innovative services, there are a number of steps that could be taken by central government. Firstly, by continuing to offer grant funding could support pilots of experimental ideas and enable new entrants into the public service market. Secondly, data on service users' needs, motivations and choices should be made widely available, in accessible formats, to allow providers to propose services that are responsive to people's needs.</p> <p>At a local level, commissioners should engage at an early stage with prospective service providers, as well as with social investors. Commissioners should also be proactive in developing partnerships and subcontracting relationships among providers to enable new collaborations and innovation. It is important for potential providers, including social investors, to have adequate time to prepare for contract bids.</p> <p>Of course, charities also have a role to play in enabling the successful innovation of services. They should proactively make contact with commissioners at an early stage, so as to avoid risk-averse and cautious procurement practice, which too often hampers innovation. They should also be prepared to invest time and staff resources into preparing for public service delivery, such as ensuring that governance structures have the operational and strategic skills to manage contracts and deliver services.</p> <p>Here at the National Council for Voluntary Organisations (NCVO), we have co-ordinated <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/public-leaders-network/blog/2012/oct/24/charity-expertise-public-service-innovation\">a collaborative report </a>to share the experiences and expertise of the voluntary sector. The report has been created in partnership by 14 organisations, specialising in areas including health and social care, criminal justice and social investment.</p> <p>The government's <a href=\"http://www.openpublicservices.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/\" title=\"\">open public services agenda</a> could transform services to be more responsive to the needs of users and local communities. Our report shares some possible barriers to innovation and experts discuss the need to manage risks for providers, the potential of social investment and the need for central government to ensure minimum standards are upheld.</p> <p>Government needs to listen to and learn from the experience and expertise of charities so that the voluntary sector's potential for providing innovative solutions to improve our public services can be fulfilled.</p> <p><em>James Allen is head of public services and partnerships at the National Council for Voluntary Organisations</em> </p> <p><em>\u2022 To respond to this, or any other article on the Public Leaders Network, email public.leaders@guardian.co.uk.
