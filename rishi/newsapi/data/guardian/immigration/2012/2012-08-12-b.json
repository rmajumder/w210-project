  "<h2>Archery by Eddie Butler</h2> <p>After the women's individual competition at Lord's, the silver medallist, A\u00edda Rom\u00e1n, and bronze medallist, Mariana Avitia, took a call from the president of Mexico, who wished to congratulate them on becoming their country's first ever medal winners in archery. The two women went to the press conference and delightedly took their place on either side of Ki Bo-bae of South Korea, the gold medal winner. Ki promptly burst into tears and apologised to her country for winning \u2013 in a sudden-death one\u2011arrow shoot-off \u2013 with a score of 8. \"Koreans do not shoot 8s,\" said the champion.</p> <p>It was a slightly unusual way to celebrate Korea's domination of the sport, especially since Ki is generally seen as the more happily demonstrative face of archery in a part of Asia where it is taken very seriously. Oh Jin-hyek, Ki's boyfriend and known as \"Soft Drink Pig\" for his taste for fizzy refreshments, won the men's individual competition, and the women's team took their seventh gold medal in seven Games.</p> <p>Italy, thanks to a 10 with a last arrow \u2013 no other score would have sufficed \u2013 from the ever so slightly paunchy Michele Frangilli, took the men's team event. Italy celebrated with Mexican delight. Britain's archers took their failure to go further than Larry Godfrey's place in the last 16 with a solemnity worthy of the Koreans.</p> <h2>Athletics by Anna Kessel</h2> <p>Athletics is always labelled the blue riband event of an Olympic Games, and in the case of London 2012 the billing was entirely justified. Although rowing and cycling sent a wave of excitement across the nation during the first week, it was the first Saturday of the athletics that set the Games alight. An unprecedented three British gold medals in 45 minutes, from Jessica Ennis in the heptathlon, Greg Rutherford in the long jump and Mo Farah in the 10,000m, provided a thrilling opener to the track and field events as the British public whooped and swooned. On that evening it seemed impossible to imagine that such noise could be repeated, let alone bettered in the following days.</p> <p>But that kind of thinking did not factor in the Usain Bolt effect. When he entered the picture along with an impressive team of Jamaica sprinters, the anticipation in the Olympic Stadium went stratospheric. Bolt's team-mate Yohan Blake, the 100m and 200m Olympic silver medallist, described it best when he talked about the Jamaica sprint relay team dropping in from outer space \u2013 not quite human, direct from Mars. Bolt joked that Blake was off his head but the 22\u2011year\u2011old did not have it far wrong.</p> <p>When Bolt, despite question marks over his fitness, tore apart the competition to defend both of his sprint titles and earn himself legendary status, the watching public were overawed. Bolt became the centre of the party, and everyone wanted a piece of him. Whether he was posturing on the track, or posing with three female Swedish handball players in his bedroom, Bolt was front\u2011page news. Helping his team to a world record in the 4x100m relay was no more than icing on the cake as the quartet clocked 36.84sec, smashing their old mark by 0.2sec and leaving the USA trailing on the home straight, as Nesta Carter, Michael Frater, Blake and Bolt brought home the baton for the fourth athletics world record of the Games.</p> <p>Perhaps most pleasing of all for the sport was the emergence of new stars. David Rudisha was the standout candidate for global recognition as the 800m runner pulled off arguably the athletics performance of London 2012. Rudisha, a shy 23-year-old from the Maasai tribe in Kenya, broke his own world record in a time of 1min 40.91sec. But it was the manner in which he did so that caught the imagination. Sprinting from the outset he indicated that he was not content to simply win his first Olympic gold medal but that he wanted to do it in style. Caught up in the excitement spectators leapt to their feet, urging him on as he kicked once, and then twice, the field chasing him, dragged to their own personal bests and national records.</p> <p>Just when it had seemed as though nothing could top these moments, as though nothing could ever make the crowd cheer louder, Farah came back to the Olympic Stadium to win his second title in the 5,000m. As he sprinted for the line, the roars that accompanied his long elegant strides were deafening. Dropping to the track to perform a drill of sit-ups, the 29-year-old clowned around Bolt-style, and the crowd were enthralled. The entire stadium stayed on to watch Farah receive his gold medal, chanting: \"We want Mo!\" while they waited. Their patience was rewarded as not only Farah but his long-time friend Bolt returned to the arena to stand on the podium together, an iconic image that will last long in the memory.</p> <h2>Badminton by Peter Walker</h2> <p>One of the more low-key Olympic sports received some unwelcome global exposure following farcical scenes in which four mixed doubles pairings \u2013 the Chinese top seeds, plus two South Korean duos and one from Indonesia \u2013 very obviously tried to lose their last matches in the opening group stage to ensure kinder knockout ties. Crowds at the Wembley Arena venue booed and jeered as some of the world's top players repeatedly hit serves into the net or wildly out.</p> <p>All were disqualified the next day, as it emerged the sport's governing body had been warned repeatedly by players and coaches that the new group stage could lead to such scenes. The Badminton World Federation apologised, but insisted the group stage system still had its merits.</p> <p>One of the Chinese players thrown out, 26-year-old Yu Yang, took to the Chinese social media site Weibo to announce her retirement, saying the organisers had \"heartlessly shattered our dreams\".</p> <p>This drama done, it was very much business as usual as China still won all five gold medals \u2013 the Chinese second seeds took the mixed title \u2013 as well as two silvers and a bronze. The other medals went mainly to traditional strongholds such as Denmark, Japan and India.</p> <h2>Basketball by Owen Gibson</h2> <p>It still seems a lot of money to spend on a venue that is going to be taken down immediately afterwards, but the pillow-like basketball arena on the Olympic Park created one of the best atmospheres of the Games. Inevitably, the focus was on the USA throughout but the fervour with which rowdy Spanish and Lithuanian fans, in particular, followed their teams meant the temporary venue rocked even in the early stages of competition. A particularly bad-tempered quarter-final between France and Spain was criticised for betraying the values of the Olympic movements. But there will be inevitable questions about the competitiveness of some of the games in the early group stages, as demonstrated by the fact that the USA topped group A with a points difference of +191 while Nigeria finished fifth with a points difference of -118. Great Britain did not embarrass themselves, but did not live up to ambitious pre-Games hopes that they might qualify.</p> <p>Inspired by Luol Deng they did, however, overcome China in their final group game by 90 points to 58. Once the competition got serious in the quarter-final stage, the action moved to the North Greenwich Arena and the USA moved inexorably towards a final against Spain. In the women's competition, USA were also dominant, beating France 86-50 in the final.</p> <h2>Beach volleyball by Owen Gibson</h2> <p>Before the Games, the beach volleyball tournament became a symbol of what London hoped to achieve. A tight arena crammed into an iconic location on Horse Guards Parade, played on the 5,000 tonnes of sand brought in for the occasion and presented with as much razzmatazz as organisers could muster, it was one of the feelgood destinations of the Games. Whether the dancers, the Benny Hill theme and the Kiss Cam added up to an experience that was more entertainment than sport didn't seem to detain the 16,000 packed into the venue every day, and it became a magnet for celebrities and royals. But on the court the action was intense and frantic. The German pair of Jonas Reckermann and Julius Brink won the men's competition but the US continued their longstanding dominance of the women's tournament. Following an all-American final, Misty May-Treanor and Kerri Walsh Jennings won their third gold medal at consecutive Games. British women's pair Zara Dampney and Shauna Mullin failed to make the last 16 after being defeated by an Austrian couple in a \"lucky loser\" play-off. But both paid tribute to an atmosphere that they said would remain with them for ever. \"Every time I stepped on court, it's given me goose pimples,\" said Dampney. The future of the sport in Britain is uncertain, but the 5,000 tonnes of sand will be used to create 30 new courts within the M25. With the sport heading for the more traditional setting of Copacabana beach for the next Games in Rio, it seems safe to assume it will again be one of the more high profile draws.</p> <h2>Boxing by Kevin Mitchell</h2> <p>To finish ahead of Cuba, Russia and the old \"East\" in Olympic boxing \u2013 not to mention the USA men going home potless \u2013 describes a quite wonderful London Games for this dedicated and talented Great Britain squad.</p> <p>Three golds, one silver and a bronze: to outstrip the deeds of the 1956 team, whose golden heroes, Terry Spinks and Dick McTaggart, were for years held aloft in boxing like the 1966 World Cup team; to do better than the Beijing battlers, who came home with a gold and two bronze \u2026 and to do it at home, these are considerable achievements.</p> <p>Whether the host broadcaster, the arbiter of our national conscience for the past fortnight, elevates boxing alongside the lesser deeds of the divers and horsey folk, the wonderful cyclists and the rowers, well, that is doubtful given the marginalisation of the sport in the BBC's main bulletins. Boxing still frightens the middle classes.</p> <p>Yet nothing can dilute the experience for Anthony Joshua, Luke Campbell, Nicola Adams, Freddie Evans and Anthony Ogogo \u2013 as well as the five who did not get a medal. Campbell, the bantamweight king, described it best. \"We live together, we eat together, we travel the world together.\"</p> <p>The Americans, meanwhile, who have won more Olympic boxing gold than even the Cubans, do very little together and had only the gold of Claressa Shields to console them after their worst performance.</p> <p>The memory that will resonate will be aural as much as visual: that wall of sound that turned the ExCeL into a half\u2011lit bearpit of excitement over the past fortnight.</p> <p>Nearly every day and night session was sold out, unheard of in modern times. But they did not just come to see the Cubans, or even the British boxers, but the exceptional competitors from Europe and beyond and, most noisily, the Irish. The Daily Telegraph even thought Katie Taylor was British; as did the Russian sports minister. Now they know.</p> <p>It was the women who surprised us all. This was their inaugural Olympic tournament and their excellence and good humour were a revelation to many who knew little about their sport. Natasha Jonas and Adams smiled from start to finish, through disappointment and triumph, and poor Savannah Marshall was dumbstruck in defeat, as was the team captain, Tom Stalker, who could find no words to express his disgust at losing a fight he was sure he had won.</p> <p>That was one of many debated decisions \u2013 although Joshua and Ogogo will admit they also benefited from close calls. The sport is dogged by incompetence and pig-headedness. Change is coming, though. There is talk of introducing 10-9 rounds, as in the pros, and five three-minute rounds are virtually nailed on for the next Olympics. Headguards have already been done away with in the semi-pro World Series of Boxing and that will be a feature of Rio in 2016 too, as the amateur game converges with the professional. Then we will have blood to go with the glory, the money \u2013 and the noise.</p> <h2>Canoeing by Robert Kitson</h2> <p>From the white water of Lee Valley to the calmer waters of Eton Dorney, this was another sport that took full advantage of its rare moment in the sun. It helped that Britain scored an unprecedented medal one-two in the two-man slalom, with Tim Baillie and Etienne Stott enjoying the run of their lives to pip compatriots David Florence and Richard Hounslow to the gold.</p> <p>There was success, too, in the sprint kayak for the sensationally quick Ed \"The Cleaver\" McKeever, who added Olympic gold to the world and European titles he won in 2010. GB canoeing's national performance coach Brendan Purcell reckons McKeever could be kayaking's equivalent of Sir Chris Hoy, with the potential to compete strongly at the next two Olympics.</p> <p>Given Tim Brabants's gold in Beijing in 2008 was the first by any British canoeist in Olympic history, it has been some transformation.</p> <p>Liam Heath and Jon Schofield also collected bronze in the two-man kayak to give the normally dominant paddlers of eastern Europe something else to chew on. With Australia winning a surprise gold in the K4 category, only their third medal in the sport's 74-year history at the Games, there has been a small but significant shift in the world order. Overall, though, the leading nation honours were predictably shared by Hungary and Germany, who collected three golds and six medals apiece, followed by Ukraine and Russia. There is no question the GB team enjoyed an uplift from home advantage but, as with the rowers, it was by no means the sole explanation for their success.The introduction of 200m sprint racing seemed popular with the public, although buying tickets for 36 seconds of action may not be everyone's idea of a wise investment.</p> <h2>Cycling by William Fotheringham</h2> <p>Nine out of 10. That number dominates any reckoning of cycling at the London Games, simply because Great Britain's hit rate from the track was so spectacular, the contest over the six days so completely one-sided, the flood of world records so overwhelming. Since Beijing, followers of Dave Brailsford's troupe have assumed that 2008 could never be topped. How could it? Well, win seven out of 10 golds, add in a silver and bronze and a disqualification, then factor in demented, deafening, ecstatic full houses and inch-perfect organisation, and if sporting nirvana exists, what we saw in the velodrome from August 2-7 was not far from it.</p> <p>If Brailsford and his coaches, and Sir Chris Hoy, Victoria Pendleton, Ed Clancy and the others deserve praise, it's for holding their nerve. In Hoy and Pendleton's case, in one final push in the face of adversity; in Clancy's, in his and his team pursuiters' capacity to take on the dominant Australians; in the sprint coaches', for not giving up when the team sprint conundrum seemed impossible. Brailsford and Sutton didn't shy at the hardest decision of all, to drop Hoy from the sprint, and it paid off; they also gambled on the nascent talent of Laura Trott and Philip Hindes at the vital moment.</p> <p>Despite disappointing world championships from 2009 to 2011, the mantra remained constant: Olympic events are all that matter. It wore thin, but was ultimately vindicated. In addition, Brailsford had cover. The goalposts were moved, but not far; the loss of two timed events \u2013 men's and women's pursuits \u2013 from Beijing was compensated for by the omnium, in which \u2013 guess what? \u2013 timed events account for half the points. The two other disciplines dropped from Beijing, the points and madison, were less suited to the British methodology, and produced a single bronze between them in 2008.</p> <p>The opposition came lulled by the slow British buildup and went away humiliated. But rather than allegations of magic wheels, or indulging in a bitter-Tweet symphony \u2014 to cite only the French \u2014 the opposition should take a long hard look at themselves. The Dane Lasse Hansen's victory in the omnium and Anna Meares's gold in the women's sprint were examples of occasions when fine competitors simply knew no fear; the German win in the team sprint a rare instance of Brailsford's boffins failing to dot every 'i'.</p> <p>British success aside, what to retain of things two-wheeled at London 2012? On the plus side, unprecedented and immense support for the men's and women's road events, of such quality that it's hard to imagine that this is only the fifth Games in which the best \u2013 professional \u2013 road cyclists have been eligible to compete. If there was ever an argument for investment in women's cycling, this was it. On the minus side, BMX increasingly looks like a demolition derby unworthy of the Games and Team GB's domination in the velodrome should not make us ignore the flaws in the rejigged track programme, which is now too thin and too dependent on timed events, underlined in London by spreading five days of competition into six.</p> <h2>Diving by Esther Addley</h2> <p>The despair on the face of the world champion, Qiu Bo, said it all. Beaten into second place by a dazzling performance by the American David Boudia in the 10m platform final, the Chinese diver buried his face in the tiles of the shower, inconsolable. Such is the exceptional standard of Chinese diving, and so great are the expectations on the country's divers, that even against the best of the rest of the world, performing at their very highest, silver is not good enough.</p> <p>Some members of China's diving delegation were in tears, too \u2013 a remarkable sight given that the country's tally in London 2012's eight diving contests ended at six golds, three silvers and a bronze. At Beijing four years ago the country had come even closer to a gold clean sweep, denied only after a brilliant final dive by the Australian Matthew Mitcham won him the individual 10m contest. On the platform and the springboard, alone and in pairs, men and women, China remains utterly dominant in the sport. It left some very strong diving nations looking as if they were fighting over the leftovers. Mexico did well with two silvers, while Russia claimed the remaining gold in the men's individual 3m springboard. Boudia had already won a bronze for the US with Nicholas McCrory in the synchronised platform event.</p> <p>For Britain's performance director, Alexei Evangulov, the picture from London is reasonably positive. Tom Daley's bronze proved that he is much more than a pretty face, and meant the squad hit its pre-Games target of between one and three medals. Daley and synchro partner Pete Waterfield had missed the podium in the synchro event only by one place after a single mistake.</p> <p>There were fifth-place finishes in the women's synchro platform and men's synchro springboard, from a squad which, at 12, was the largest team of British divers to qualify for the Olympics since 1908. Most encouraging, perhaps, is the young talent who now have Olympic experience: aside from Daley, who is still just 18, Alicia Blagg is 15, Jack Laugher, 17, Chris Mears, 19. Roll on Rio.</p> <h2>Equestrian by Stephen Moss</h2> <p>Many pundits were critical of the decision to stage equestrianism at Greenwich Park and even after 10 days of fabulous, mostly sun-blessed action in which Britain exceeded expectations by winning three golds, a silver and a bronze there were still a few naysayers. \"Where's the legacy?\" they cried.</p> <p>In many ways they were right. The wonderful arena will now be dismantled; the cross-country course has already gone, with the obstacles distributed to other venues. Soon it will all be a memory and Greenwich's angry dog walkers will have back their park. But what a memory!</p> <p>Britain's double dressage gold will certainly have a legacy in terms of coverage, participants and sponsors. Soon we will all be able to distinguish piaffe from passage. Team GB's surprise team showjumping gold got plenty of headlines, too, though there was further disappointment for Nick Skelton in the individual competition. The format was bizarre: Skelton jumped four clear rounds in qualifying but none counted on the day of the final. So why have them? It was absurdly convoluted, a sign that the sport has forgotten how to communicate with the public.</p> <p>The eventing, with which the horsefest began, was dominated to a ludicrous degree by Zara Phillips, who at least had the good grace to be embarrassed. Zara-mania obscured the fact there was a genius riding \u2013 Michael Jung, right,who on his 30th birthday secured individual gold and became the first rider to hold the world, Olympic and European titles simultaneously.</p> <p>He also led Germany to team gold, with Britain taking silver. Tina Cook and the veteran Mary King, who like the 54-year-old Skelton vowed to be in Rio, performed heroically but the world No1, William Fox-Pitt, and Lionheart failed to roar.</p> <p>So Britain won three golds, Germany two and the 30-year-old Swiss rider Steve Guerdat took the individual showjumping gold when Skelton's Big Star had the Cutty Sark fence down when trying to force a jump-off.</p> <p>Skelton's blue eyes blazed defiance but he was desperately disappointed. Spare a thought, too, for the Dutch, who had victory in the team showjumping in their grasp before Gerco Schr\u00f6der had a fence down, and who felt robbed of gold in the individual dressage. They added colour, passion and good sportsmanship to a fantastic fortnight.</p> <p>The arena may soon be history but some grand spirits will forever inhabit Greenwich Park.</p> <h2>Fencing by Jamie Jackson</h2> <p>One of the five core Olympic sports to feature in every modern Games, the event was headed by Italy, who collected three golds to the two of South Korea and China. With its darkened hall, competitors' futuristic white suits and a hood studded with LEDs that flash when hit, this is a kind of combat Star Wars for the sports fan.</p> <p>There was also fencing's 15 minutes of Olympic fame when South Korea's Shin A-lam staged a sit-down following her last-second loss in the women's epee. After 75 long minutes she left the piste but still protested, unsuccessfully, that Britta Heidemann semi-final win should be reversed as she had made two attempts to strike without the clock changing.</p> <p>GB interest seemed to be heading for the file marked anonymous until Richard Kruse, James Davis, Husayn Rosowsky and Laurence Halsted gave Italy a major scare in the quarter-finals.</p> <h2>Football by Daniel Taylor</h2> <p>A success overall, but only to a point. Football was always going to feel slightly peripheral, especially when the crowds were so sparse and some of the venues so far away. Add to that the roll\u2011your\u2011eyes predictability of Great Britain's men going out to South Korea on penalties on the night of Jessica Ennis, Mo Farah and Greg Rutherford.</p> <p>But the past few weeks should have done the women's game a lot of good. The crowd for GB's defeat of Brazil at Wembley was 70,584, destroying the previous record. That was good but the outstanding memory came in the semi-final when Canada led three times, USA clawed it back three times and pinched it at the death, after 123 minutes, courtesy of Alex Morgan's header. Every tournament needs a classic match and this ticked every box.</p> <h2>Judo by Jamie Jackson</h2> <p>From the opening Saturday to the following Friday the sport proved a story machine. The prime mover here was Densign White, the British Judo chairman, who was premature with his scathing criticism of home disappointments. When White spoke, only Colin Oates of the eight judoka who had competed had managed a win. Cue Gemma Gibbons winning silver in the women's 78kg \u2013 GB's first judo medal in 12 years \u2013 plus Karina Bryant claiming bronze in the 78kg+, to make this Britain's best Olympic yield since 1992.</p> <p>White's awkward week hardly improved when Winston Gordon, who made the 90kg last-16, said of him: \"My grandmother told me there is a saying \u2013 when a fish rots, it rots from the head.\" Gibbons refused eye contact with White during her medal ceremony.</p> <p>This was all before the astonishing revelation that Mongolia's Tuvshinbayar Naidan had contested the 100kg final despite tearing his anterior cruciate ligament in the semi\u2011final.</p> <h2>Gymnastics by Emma John</h2> <p>Despite the unforgivable raft of empty seats, the North Greenwich Arena turned out to be one of the most intensely atmospheric venues of the Games and it delivered the performances to match.</p> <p>This Games will go down as the one when British gymnastics came good. Four medals \u2013 more than twice the sport's stated target \u2013 proved that Britain are, for the first time in history, a force to be reckoned with. Louis Smith's pommel horse silver was the best result and Beth Tweddle's longed-for bronze \u2013 the first individual medal for a British woman \u2013 the most significant but there was joy too in seeing the strength of the teams and the emergence of new talent like Max Whitlock.</p> <p>The artistic gymnastics combined wins for dead certs with some shocking upsets. And USA were involved in both: their much-hyped women's team destroyed the field in the team contest and took five medals in all, yet their two surest things \u2013 Jordyn Wieber in the all-around and McKayla Maroney in the vault \u2013 missed out on golds that supposedly had their names already inscribed. Japan's Kohei Uchimura, the only man to win three back-to-back world all-around championships, took his expected Olympic title only after proving himself mortal: Britain's Kristian Thomas beat him in qualifying.</p> <p>Trampolining, which also took place at the NGA, could not have asked for more to raise its profile than a champion with the unforgettable name of Dong Dong. The Chinese world champion had a fantastically acrobatic routine to match and, though there was disappointment for the home favourite Kat Driscoll \u2013the former world No1 did not qualify for the final \u2013 the feeling was of a sport that had found its perfect showcase.</p> <p>But while the rhythmic gymnastics at Wembley Arena dazzled with its costumed finery, its kitsch connotations of majorettes could not quite catch the British imagination in the same way. Russia's dominance did not allow for much drama. Evgenia Kanaeva became the first rhythmic Olympic champion to retain her title and Britain came last in both team and individual event, which is perhaps one reason why we still struggle to take it to our hearts.</p> <h2>Handball by Peter Walker</h2> <p>A sport with very little tradition in the UK became one of the spectator successes of the Games, the dedicated Copper Box arena packed every day with a mixture of continental diehards fans and curious locals. The latter had the novelty of seeing the first-ever British teams to play Olympic handball, although both men and women lost every single group game, most by significant margins. The narrowest loss was the women's six-point defeat to Angola. Once the minor nations had been swatted aside, handball bigwigs Norway, Montenegro, Sweden and France competed in the finals, with Norway (women) and France (men) triumphant.<strong> </strong></p> <h2>Hockey by Peter Walker</h2> <p>Not since the days of the British men's run to hockey gold in the 1988 Olympics has the sport proved so popular with a domestic audience. This was in part due to a measure of home success \u2013 the GB women won bronze; the men were fourth \u2013 but also due to some fantastically dramatic matches and clever staging. The 16,000-capacity Riverbank Stadium, though just a temporary scaffolding structure, was one of the more noisy and visceral Olympic venues with its steeply raked seating and innovative pink acrylic pitch, designed to make the ball easier to see.</p> <p>Both British teams did well to progress from strong groups into the semi-finals, pulling off some exceptional moments along the way, not least the men's unlikely late fightback from 3-0 down against Australia to secure a draw. More dramatic still was the Dutch women's semi-final win over New Zealand, which went to a shootout.</p> <p>When it came to the knockout stages the traditional hierarchies of hockey remained in place. The GB women lost to Argentina, who in turn took silver to the Netherlands. The Dutch men dispatched their British peers 9-2 in the semi but lost in the final to Germany.</p> <h2>Modern pentathlon by Stephen Moss</h2> <p>The modern pentathlon was created by Baron de Coubertin and first took its place in the Olympics of 1912. Its centenary passed with little ceremony and what looks a rather distinguished slot \u2013 the final weekend and, in the case of the women, the final medal to be awarded. But it is, in reality, a cul de sac. The athletes dislike having to wait so long and it gets overshadowed by the last day of the athletics and the closing ceremony.</p> <p>The sport has revamped itself \u2013 women were given their own event in 2000 and the competition now ends with what is seen as a more spectator-friendly combined shooting-and-running event. But stories persist that some movers and shakers want it removed from the Olympics, seeing it as anachronistic.</p> <p>It would be good if it stays. It is pleasingly eccentric \u2013 decamping from Stratford to Greenwich for the second half of what was quite a long day of competition \u2013 and enshrines many of De Coubertin's chivalrous virtues, except in the fencing where the competitors are not above disputing with the judges whether a hit has been made.</p> <p>The eastern Europeans remain the ones to beat, with David Svoboda of the Czech Republic winning the men's event and a posse of Hungarians and Russians close behind, and Laura Asadauskaite of Lithuania taking gold in the women's event.</p> <p>The silver-medal winners, Cao Zhongrong and Samantha Murray, show that the Chinese and Great Britain are on board but it would help the sport if it spread the gospel to the United States, traditionally weak in the event. The Olympics would be poorer without the modern pentathlon.</p> <h2>Rowing by Robert Kitson</h2> <p>Much was expected of British rowing on Dorney Lake and great things duly unfolded. The rest of the world could be forgiven for wondering what on earth their \u2013 and the GB cyclists' \u2013 secret was. The final tally of four golds, two silvers and three bronzes comfortably exceeded the pre-Games target of six and represented the most successful haul by a GB squad at any Olympic regatta in history.</p> <p>The \"Dorney roar\" was raucous from the outset, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning memorably securing the first home gold of the Games.</p> <p>Katherine Grainger, partnered by Anna Watkins, finally added an emotional gold to the three silvers she had previously earned and a third female duo, Sophie Hosking and Kat Copeland, leapt out of the shadows to win the lightweight women's double sculls. All three results reflected splendidly on the GB women's coaches.</p> <p>There could easily have been more lightweight success for the men's four and men's double sculls, both of whom had to settle for silver by the narrowest of margins. Instead it fell to the men's four of Andy Triggs Hodge, Pete Reed, Tom James and Alex Gregory to retain their Olympic title and extend the rich legacy of Steve Redgrave and Matthew Pinsent. Nowadays Redgrave's primary role is to hoist shattered athletes back ashore, a role for which no one on the planet is better suited. Lottery funding and the relentless excellence of J\u00fcrgen Gr\u00f6bler, below, have clearly helped but Redgrave's dedication has set the benchmark by which everyone else measures themselves.</p> <p>It was not just a Brit fest. The German men's eight won a spectacularly hard-fought final and the Kiwi men's pair of Eric Murray and Hamish Bond were as unstoppable as the All Blacks in full cry.</p> <p>Perhaps most symbolic of all was South Africa's gold medal in the lightweight men's four. Their crew included Sizwe Ndlovu, rowing's first black gold medallist. The sport is still perceived in certain quarters as a haven for posh white men; here was the perfect riposte.</p> <p>It may be a while, even so, before there is a place on the podium for Hamadou Djibo Issaka of Niger, the Games's unlikeliest participant.</p> <p>Hailing from a country which incorporates a large chunk of the Sahara Desert and has no rowing boats, \"Issaka the Otter\" was a converted swimmer whose previous experience of pulling oars amounted to three months. He, and Great Britain's record-breakers, both plan to be back in 2016.</p> <h2>Sailing by Steven Morris</h2> <p>Sailing has long been seen as a sport practised by few, watched by even fewer. The Dorset branch of the London 2012 Games may have changed that forever.</p> <p>For a start, 15 countries shared the 30 medals. The powerhouses of sailing, Team GB and Australia, ended up with the most medals, nine between them. To the chagrin of the GB team, Australia got the better of them for the first time since 1992. Spain also squeezed ahead of GB with two golds medals to Ben Ainslie's one.</p> <p>But there were medals, too, for the likes of Poland and Argentina. China won their first gold medal in a boat rather than on a board and Cyprus secured their first medal in any Olympic event in the Laser dinghy class.</p> <p>Sailing's world governing body, ISAF, was pleased that nations not known for Olympic sailing were represented. The Cook Islands sent a competitor, as did Trinidad &amp; Tobago. ISAF hopes they will return and spread the word to other nations in the Pacific and Caribbean.</p> <p>The governing body is optimistic that by Rio 2016 more African and Asian countries will be at the Olympic regatta. Countries including Kuwait, Oman and Saudi Arabia are close to being ready to take on the bigger nations.</p> <p>Another success of the regatta has been Weymouth's Nothe Fort spectator area. Some 4,500 people have sat on the grassy slopes every day to watch races taking place a few hundred metres off shore, the action explained via big screens and expert commentary.</p> <p>Most seem to have thoroughly enjoyed the experience. Those without tickets have found spots on beaches, cliff-tops and Weymouth's stone pier. It is estimated that 70,000 people were there to witness Ainslie win his fourth&#xa0;gold.</p> <p>One reservation expressed by some sailors was the proximity of the Nothe course \u2013 one of four used \u2013 to the shore. Because it was so close, the wind could be unreliable. Some sailors complained that it made the medal races, which all took place on the Nothe course, too open to chance.</p> <p>The teams who have struggled will have lots to think about between now and Rio. Partly inspired by the Nothe, the Brazilians are planning to create a course close to the shore at the Marina da Gl\u00f3ria and build a stand for 10,000 people.</p> <p>But as well as being about elite sport, the Olympics must be about bringing in more people. Hundreds of children tried sailing and windsurfing on Weymouth beach during the Games. Sailing clubs are reporting an increase in inquiries from people keen to have a go. The legacy may be that, in time, sailing could come to be regarded as not just the plaything of the rich few and also an exciting spectator sport.</p> <h2>Shooting by Barney Ronay</h2> <p>The Royal Artillery Barracks staged an excellent Olympic shooting competition. There were gripes beforehand from British shooters excluded from the main Olympic Park in favour of suburban Woolwich but the venue itself was a triumph, a dimpled plastic spaceship set in appealing leafiness and praised by competitors for its scale and crowd-magnifying acoustics. It was a fine Olympic competition too, bringing the first gold medal of the Games, for the supernaturally unerring Yi Siling of China, who snatched first place in the women's 10m air rifle with the shooting equivalent of a sprint finish in the final round.</p> <p>Shooting also provided one of the early stories of the Games, the appearance of eight-month pregnant Malaysian shooter Nur Suryani Mohamed Taibi, the first Olympian to compete in such an advanced state of incubation (she finished 34th). The medals were shared mainly between South Korea, USA, China and Italy but there were also medals here for Kuwait, Qatar and billion-strong Olympic minnows India, not to mention a gold for Team GB's shooting farmer Peter Wilson in the double-trap.</p> <p>Shooting guns at targets doesn't get much better than this. A barrack-bound Olympic success.</p> <h2>Swimming by Andy Bull</h2> <p>The grumpy frump on the fringe of the party, British Swimming had a poor Olympics. The official medal target was between five and seven but the performance director, Michael Scott, had repeatedly said that he wanted to match the tally from Beijing, where the team won six medals including two&#xa0;golds.</p> <p>They did not get close to either target, finishing with one silver, from Michael Jamieson, and two bronzes, both won by Becky Adlington. The sport will surely have its funding cut and Scott has admitted he will have to make the team \"leaner and meaner\" as a result. Absurdly, he was awarded a new four-year contract just before the Games.</p> <p>Six medals was not an unrealistic target. The squad included three world champions in Liam Tancock, Adlington and Keri-Anne Payne, two world silver medallists in Ellen Gandy and Hannah Miley, and nine swimmers ranked inside the world's top five in their events. This was the most talented squad British Swimming has had in a generation, which is why they got 23 swimmers into Olympics finals. The trouble was that their return from that was so meagre. As Scott said: \"Success is measured in podium places.\"</p> <p>Medals are not the only measure, of course. But it was even more disappointing that so few of the top British swimmers set personal bests, or even matched the times they had set at the Olympic trials, held in the same pool back in March. Collectively, the squad seemed to peak too soon. For Adlington, for example, there was no shame in being beaten by the brilliant 15-year-old Katie Ledecky in the 800m freestyle. What was puzzling, as she said herself, was that eight weeks beforehand, in Barcelona, she had swum quicker than she managed on the night. She suggested that the team were suffering with a touch of stage fright. Scott refused to accept that. He thinks that they did not have enough \"race toughness\" and that they had should have competed more in the runup. It is too late now. These swimmers missed out on the chance of a lifetime.</p> <p>One conspicuous exception was Jamieson, a man who has what Tom Wolfe called \"the right stuff\". He broke the British record three times: in the heats, semi-finals, and final of the 200m breaststroke. Hungary's Daniel Gyurta had to set a world record to beat Jamieson to gold. The Scot was one of the very few who seemed to be buoyed up by the occasion, rather than bowed down by the pressure of it.</p> <p>There were other good performances too, but not enough of them. Elizabeth Simmonds did well in the 200m backstroke, as did Robbie Renwick in the 200m freestyle. The obvious link between the three is that none of them was expected to deliver a medal.</p> <p>It would be wrong to blame the press and public for putting the stars under too much pressure, though there was every reason to have high expectations. The synchronised swimming team, on the other hand, were allowed the luxury of being content with coming sixth. In doing that, they met the target set by their coach.</p> <h2>Table-tennis by Jamie Jackson</h2> <p>Beneath a final medal table dominated by China \u2013 all four golds, plus two silvers \u2013 lay the offering of human stories that form the deep well of true Olympic spirit. Vanuatu's Anolyn Lulu may have lost her preliminary round game 4-0 to Ligia Silva of Brazil too fast for her sense of competitive pride, but the 33-year-old had begun the Games by carrying the flag of the South Pacific island nation into the Olympic Stadium. This added further lustre to her fame in her homeland where everyone already recognises her, and provided rich memories to warm her on her return to Vanuatu.</p> <h2>Taekwondo by Jamie Jackson</h2> <p>Martin Stamper, Jade Jones, Sarah Stevenson and Lutalo Muhammad were GB's entrants and all offered compelling yarns. Stamper made the semi-finals of the 68kg division, while Jones won a stunning gold in the 57kg class, then said: \"There was a lot of pressure on taekwondo to do well, because we have got the potential. The whole team has come a long way in a short period of time. We are getting bigger and better. Hopefully now more people can get into taekwondo.\"</p> <p>The expectation Jones mentioned appeared to have mortally affected Muhammad, whose golden opportunity arrived inside the biggest poisoned chalice of recent memory. Chosen ahead of Aaron Cook, the world No1, in the 80kg division, Muhammad was required to win a medal to vindicate GB Taekwondo. After losing in the quarter\u2011finals, the Londoner was reprieved via a repechage and proved his courage by going on to claim bronze. Stevenson, the 67kg world champion, crashed out after losing her opening fight. But after losing both parents during the previous 18 months, perspective was a comfort.</p> <p>In the broader sense this was the Games where taekwondo entered the wider sporting consciousness.</p> <h2>Tennis by Kevin Mitchell</h2> <p>It wasn't just Andy Murray winning a gold medal that made the Olympic tennis special. It was witnessing the organic shift in mood at Wimbledon.</p> <p>There was a weirdness about the place that struck everyone who went there. For a start, the Army had moved in, and steel barriers across the roads gave the genteel suburb an air of Northern Ireland at the height of the Troubles, a bit of a jolt for Hyacinth and her neighbours. Yet there was no menace, just a sense of imposed order, with squaddies roaming through the packed avenues between the courts, some of them armed, many of them here for the first time, no doubt, and gawping at the splendour of the All England Club while supposedly also keeping an eye out for who-knows-what. It was as if we were all in an Alfred Hitchcock movie without realising it.</p> <p>In the seats, there was good humour and noise \u2013 plenty of it, more than is normally allowed, certainly on Centre Court. The Belarus flag made its way into the Royal Box during the mixed doubles final and, if the committee did not splutter at the sight, it surely jotted down a reminder that this might be taking hospitality too far.</p> <p>To give the crusty old burghers their due, Wimbledon embraced the Olympics. The arrivistes, by and large, ogled respectfully at this quaint old beast of an institution and everyone had a jolly good time.</p> <p>There was talk among the tennis hacks about the merits of three-set matches up to the final \u2013 not a bad idea, so it's doubtful it will be taken up \u2013 and there was celebration of a fine new Olympic champion in the men's singles, and the recoronation of another in the women's, Serena Williams.</p> <p>The tennis was good, the weather behaved itself, the food \u2013 apart from a passably good sausage on a roll from a van below the players' lounge \u2013 was predictably dire.</p> <p>We won't see its like again and Wimbledon will slip its blazer back on soon enough. But, all in all, it was worth it.</p> <h2>Triathlon by Sean Ingle</h2> <p>Triathlon has been the fastest growing sport in the UK for more than a decade but it must have gathered plenty more converts over four days during London 2012, especially after the performance of Alistair Brownlee. He followed a 1500m swim and 43km bike ride with a 10km run in 29.07min \u2013 only 97 seconds slower than Mo Farah's time to win gold in the men's 10,000m. It was Britain's first triathlon medal at the Olympics and it was soon followed by bronze for Alistair's brother Jonny, who survived a 15-second penalty for climbing on his bike a centimetre too early and a violent bout of post-race sickness to take his place on the podium. The women's race, meanwhile, was decided by photo-finish after one of the closest and greatest triathlons in history. Switzerland's Nicola Spirig got gold, with only the width of her vest separating her from Sweden's Lisa Norden, who took silver.</p> <p>Britain's Helen Jenkins defied an injured knee to finish fifth, falling back behind the leaders only in the last kilometre. Afterwards she said the crowds around Hyde Park, often 10 or 12 deep, had kept her going. Expect lots of men and women in ill-fitting lycra tri\u2011suits to try the sport for the first time in 2013 \u2013 and more Brownlee dominance in the years ahead.</p> <h2>Water polo by Jamie Jackson</h2> <p>A kind of soaking wet murder ball, water polo is a perpetual motion of attacks consisting of whizz-paced passes controlled instantly and bionic-wristed one-hand shots that move like cannonballs at opposing goalkeepers. That's the tame stuff. Beneath the surface is where it's really at: just about anything goes in a skulduggery-fest of which the GB captain, Fran Leighton, admitted: \"Its all about having the face of an angel above the water while all the fighting goes on underneath.\" GB women could take losing narrowly to Russia, 7-6, but going down 16-3 to the auld enemy Australia was as palatable as a belly full of chlorine.</p> <h2>Wrestling (Greco-Roman and freestyle) by Jamie Jackson</h2> <p>Kyrgyzstan's Aisuluu Tynybekova became the first woman wrestler to represent her country and defeat in her first match did not dilute the achievement of competing here. The 19-year-old 63kg freestyle entrant had overcome a lack of female competition in her homeland \u2013 she practises against men \u2013 and the \"stingy\" diet provided by her Olympic committee, to qualify for the Games. As a sport freestyle wrestling, which allows grabbing from below the waist, felt too similar to judo, while the Greco-Roman discipline \u2013 no below-waist action allowed \u2013 was the purer experience. Russia, Japan and Iran headed the gold medal count, with three each.</p> <h2>Volleyball by Sean Ingle</h2> <p>Seeds were planted at these Games, even if volleyball is unlikely to grow into a mainstream UK sport. Crowds of first-timers, eager to try something new, were entranced by the set and spike \u2013 as well as the outrageous athleticism on display. The atmosphere was usually excellent too, helped by the large pockets of away fans and the cheap tickets. And while Team GB's men were unable to win one of their five matches, the women \u2013 ranked 69th in the world and without lottery funding \u2013 did beat Algeria, 43 places above them. The challenge now will be to get the sport into the schools, and keep some level of elite-level funding.</p> <h2>Weightlifting by Simon Hattenstone</h2> <p>Forty-four Olympic and world records were broken over the course of the Games \u2013 along with a fair few hearts, and very nearly Matthias Steiner's neck after a 196kg barbell crashed down on the defending champion (he was extremely sore, but thankfully OK). Behdad Salimikordasiabi from Iran proved himself the strongest Olympian in the world, lifting a ludicrous total of 449kg to win the men's super-heavyweight. For the first time, and to some consternation, a lifter won from the B final. Was North Korea's Om Yun-cho deliberately underplaying his strength? And, if so, was this an acceptable form of gamesmanship? To be fair to the little lad, he did become only the fifth man in history to lift more than triple his bodyweight in the 56kg category.</p> <p>Zoe Smith acquitted herself admirably, scored a personal best and showed Britain might have a future in weightlifting. My personal highlight was seeing the Welsh refuse wagon driver Natasha Perdue make a total. She was knackered, nervous, injured and desperate to post a score for her father, Terry Perdue, who had weightlifted twice in the Olympics and died in 1998. When it came to the clean and jerk, she could barely walk let alone lift. She heaved the barbell up bit by bit, in such agony that her face was squeezed in half. After a wobble that lasted an eternity Perdue held it still above her head. She had managed it, and it was an incredibly moving moment.</p>",
  "<p>It's getting very close. The tension is rising. Over 11 days, around 4,200 athletes from 150 countries will have the London arena, as well as Weymouth for sailing and Eton Dorney for rowing, as their setting for a global audience.</p> <p>I am talking, of course, about the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/paralympics-2012\" title=\"\">Paralympics</a>. There's an appetite. More than 2m of the 2.5m tickets have been sold, and it seems impossible to get hold of the rest. Global television coverage will focus on athletes who have become heroes in their own countries \u2013 and who have congenital problems, who are blind or hearing-impaired, or spine-damaged or have lost limbs after accidents.</p> <p>Though disabled athletes had occasionally taken part in the Olympics before, the Paralympics proper goes back to disasters of the last century. Its real founder was the neurologist <a href=\"http://www.sciencemuseum.org.uk/broughttolife/people/ludwigguttmann.aspx\" title=\"\">Ludwig Guttmann</a>, a German Jewish migrant to Britain who left Germany in 1939 on the eve of war. He settled in Oxford and then in 1944 went to Stoke Mandeville hospital, to treat British servicemen who had suffered spinal injuries.</p> <p>There, inspired by the 1948 London Olympics, \"Papa\" Guttmann put his belief in the strengthening power of sport into practice with his own wheelchair-based games. By 1952, the <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-14896776\" title=\"\">Stoke Mandeville Games</a> had 150 international competitors. In 1960, at the Rome summer Olympics, the competitions were being held in parallel; the term \"paralympics\" was probably originally meant to refer to paraplegia, but now means \"alongside\" the Olympics, and was first used officially in 1988.</p> <p>It's useful to know all that, I think, as a corrective to any notion that the Paralympics are recent, or \"politically correct\". Indeed, the more you think about them, the more inextricably linked they are to the thinking of the mainstream games.</p> <p>For sport isn't fair, is it? You need guts and hard work \u2013 but you also need the luck of a particular physique. The dominance of Kenyans, Ethiopians and Somalis in long-distance running has a lot to do with geographical altitude and having bigger lung capacity as a result. To be a great sprinter, you need formidable power \u2013 you can't train yourself to be Usain Bolt. Or think of the huge arm-spans (and feet) of great swimmers \u2013 you can't will yourself into the same shape as Michael Phelps, either.</p> <p>Then there are the other kinds of luck. There aren't many Indian athletes because India doesn't care as much about the Olympics as, say, China or Brazil. A talented gymnast shrewd enough to be born in Russia, or the US, would have rather more help and support than one who happens to be born in Chad or Bolivia.</p> <p>There is a crude, unthinking sports fan who confuses the human lottery with virtue; who worships a Bolt or a Phelps because they are big and physically impressive; or who thinks that Australian or British sportspeople are inherently \"better\".</p> <p>Why waste time talking about it? Because it's exactly the same kind of stupidity that denigrates other people because they happen to have been born with physical palsy or a learning disability, or to have had a car accident that resulted in both legs being amputated. When it comes to sport, thinking people aren't particularly interested in the unequal distribution of luck that is part of the human condition; they're interested in the guts, spirit and staying power.</p> <p>What's interesting is what separates out the ones with determination, no self-pity and considerable courage. Some people with Mo Farah's physical inheritance are presumably lazy. Farah himself, even with his advantages, speaks of a long, long slog to reach the medal podium.</p> <p>And this is the story of the Paralympics on stilts \u2013 or wheels, rather, or blades. These are athletes whose initial store of physical luck was less, but whose determination equals than of a Bolt or a Rebecca Adlington; and whose courage is greater.</p> <p>If we are prepared to learn about the weird scoring system for diving, or pretend to understand why a little man on a motor-scooter leads the sprint cyclists, because we're interested in the human stories they reveal, then just the same must apply to the rules and qualifications for wheelchair rugby, or boccia (the boules-style game for people with cerebral palsy) or goalball (for the sightless).</p> <p>However, the Paralympics may be morally more important than the Olympics. For the stupid adoration of people because of their physical luck has as its flip side the stupid ridiculing or hostility to people because of their disabilities. In essence, it's the same thing. The comedian's vile insult, the punch at a bus-stop, the schoolboy mockery of wheelchair-users are all failures of empathy \u2013 failures to see the people who are actually there.</p> <p>And in Britain, at least, this is the time to worry. Official government figures show that the number of <a href=\"http://www.equalityhumanrights.com/legal-and-policy/inquiries-and-assessments/inquiry-into-disability-related-harassment/\" title=\"\">disability hate crimes</a> reported to the police in England and Wales has reached a record high \u2013 there were some 1,942 last year. That figure has doubled since 2008 and, given the likelihood of the most vulnerable and scared people reporting such crimes, is only a tiny tip of a big iceberg. Other surveys suggest that a fifth of Britain's 10 million disabled people have suffered abuse or harassment in public.</p> <p>So what's going on? Charities believe it must be linked to the rise in \"scrounger\" rhetoric by ministers, and the suggestion that huge numbers of people are <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/may/14/disability-living-allowance-reform-analysis?CMP=twt_gu\" title=\"\">dishonestly claiming benefits</a>. In hard times, this is toxic. And because there are always a few bad apples, it is an addictively easy blame game. Yes, there are idle people with disabilities. Yes, there are crooks who happen to be partially sighted. It's the same with those who aren't disabled \u2026 except that they are a little harder to pick out, and pick on.</p> <p>As the Paralympics will remind us, there's a vast range of disability, and it's people with learning disabilities who are most at risk. According to the <a href=\"http://www.papworth.org.uk/index.php\" title=\"\">Papworth Trust</a>, 90% of them report being bullied, with a third saying it happens every week or every day. These are the people at the sharpest end of the fear and insecurity that comes with hard times.</p> <p>What's happening to them is the latest episode in the sad saga of discrimination of old: \"they're the same\" \u2013 all black, gay or Jewish people. It's seeing the label, not the person. Mostly, in modern Britain, we've moved beyond this. Mostly, but not quite. That's why the Paralympics matters so much. Papa Guttmann is watching.</p>",
  "<p>What a difference a day makes. Samantha Murray had begun the modern pentathlon with a tentative display in the fencing event that seemed destined to knock her out of the running. She finished it on the podium with a silver medal round her neck.</p> <p>The 22-year-old took Britain's final medal of these Games after a thrilling finish against Brazil's Yane Marques in the Greenwich Arena. Her efforts in the first three events had put her in fourth place going into the final discipline, a combined running and shooting event, and with a handicap of only eight seconds behind the leader Laura Asadauskaite, the Lithuanian world No1, who took the gold here.</p> <p>In the four-lap finale, a 3,000m cross- country run interspersed with three rounds of target shooting on a 10-metre range, Murray lost several positions as she struggled to shoot down her five targets and finished the first lap in seventh place. But she made up places on the second lap until she had only Asadauskaite and Marques ahead of her.</p> <p>With Marques's legs beginning to look wobbly on the third 1km lap, Murray caught the 26-year-old Brazilian as they approached the shooting range for the last time. A brilliant final round and a burst of leg speed as she left the shooting area put her second and simultaneously broke Marques's resistance. As the Preston lass ran into the arena for the last time she was seconds ahead and the crowd's cheers of encouragement had turned to triumph.</p> <p>\"It was a complete dream to have a home crowd screaming for me and just lift me up like that,\" Murray said. \"I could have carried on running for another 10 minutes because I was loving it so much. I was just so proud. I've had a tough day but it's been a good day.\"</p> <p>This marked Britain's fifth of nine modern pentathlon medals contested at the Olympics since its introduction as a women's sport in 2000, an unusual dominance in a sport largely competed for by eastern Europeans. But the high expectations also led to crushing disappointment for Mhairi Spence, Murray's team-mate. Spence is the current world champion \u2013 a title she won in Rome in May, where Murray took bronze \u2013 but she finished 21st here and said afterwards that, while the sport was a great leveller, \"it definitely knows how to break your spirit sometimes\".</p> <p>Nicknamed \"Fencey Spencey\" for her favourite discipline, the world No4 was expected to shine in the first event at the Copper Box, where the competitors are required to fence every one of their opponents in a one-minute bout, the first hit winning. She started strongly, playing cat and mouse with her opponents in her trademark style, but three hours is a long time to fence \u2013 the athletes play no fewer than 35 bouts \u2013 and her frustration became evident as the usually smiley athlete argued with her coach, having lost her bout to the defending champion, Lena Sch\u00f6neborn.</p> <p>Although Spence repaired some of the damage and remained in 11th place after the swim, four downed fences in the showjumping and a failure to hit her shooting targets sent her plummeting through the field. \"Everything just kind of went wrong today,\" she said, \"and obviously I'm gutted because I proved a couple of months ago that I'm good enough to stand on the podium \u2026 I don't feel like I'm a world champion right now.\"</p> <p>Murray herself had suffered a terrible start to the day. She lost seven straight bouts in the fencing before gradually, very gradually, improving her standing. In joint 16th after the first discipline, she seemed to have left herself a mountain to climb. And mountain climbing is not even on the programme.</p> <p>But as any regular observer of the sport will tell you \u2013 if you can find one \u2013 a day is a long time in modern pentathlon. Eleven hours, in fact. And by hour five, Murray had dragged herself into bronze medal position thanks to an outstanding performance in the 200m swim. The Hungarian Sarolta Kovacs went out fast and Murray clung to her shoulder and, when Kovacs set a new Olympic record of 2min 08.20sec, Murray was only nine hundredths of a second behind her. Surprisingly Murray declared herself disappointed with her swim later:</p> <p>The showjumping round provided, as ever, the most dramatic contest of the day. Modern pentathletes have only 20 minutes to introduce themselves to the horses they will ride, who are drawn by lot, and a number of riders found the relationship wanting \u2013 not least Tamara Vega of Mexico. Her mount threw her on the second part of a triple and she ended up jumping the third part dangling from the underside of his neck.</p> <p>When Ukraine's Iryna Khokhlova, who had been lying 14th, put in the first clear round of the contest, gaining herself a perfect score of 1,200, the pressure was on for the remaining riders. No one else could match her feat, although Asadauskaite put in a masterly ride with only one fence deduction \u2013 her horse was so proud he leapt over the exit gate on his way out of the arena.</p> <p>Spence, who came to modern pentathlon through horseriding, had drawn a dark grey called Coronado's Son and, while pentathletes are given briefing notes on their mounts, his made no mention of his burning eagerness to complete the course. It took all of Spence's determination to keep him in check and the four fences he knocked down along the way put her ultimately out of medal contention. \"I was just pointing and hoping for the best,\" she said later, \"doing the best I could with what I got. That's life, isn't it?\"</p> <p>But a good ride from Murray took her into the final round only 32 points behind Asadauskaite. She attributed her calm performance at the end to the psychological training she has undergone: \"I could have bottled it and thrown it away,\" she said.</p> <p>\"Holding a pistol when you've just run 2km, co-ordinating your breathing, you've got sweaty palms, your heart's racing \u2013 it's tough, it's a challenge. But I've pictured and trained my mind for that moment.\"</p>",
  "<p>It was impossible to feel anything remotely like a sense of doom from the packed steps of the grandstands here at Folkstone on Sunday, as the sun beamed on Family Day at Kent's only racecourse. The bars were full, sundry ice cream vendors were rapidly turning cones into coins and the appearance of Peppa Pig created much excitement.</p> <p>But if nothing changes, Folkestone will open its gates for only seven more racedays. After 18 December it will be gone for good. The problem is that the place looks like this only twice a year. There were an estimated 6,000 in the stands and a similar crowd is expected on 2 September, another Sunday, but otherwise Folkestone is restricted to midweek meetings. Ten of its 24 fixtures this year are Tuesdays, when it is not at all unusual for the attendance to dip below 1,000. \"If we could race here every other Sunday in the summer, you would get an amazing crowd,\" says Kate Hills, a spokeswoman for Northern and Arena, which owns the track.</p> <p>As things are, the track \"has failed to be financially viable for a number of years\", according to a notice in the racecard. Now that planning permission for 800 homes on the site has been denied, Northern and Arena have had enough.</p> <p>Hills remains hopeful that the planning inspector can be moved to change his position. In the meantime she reports: \"We've moved the fixtures to courses within the group that offer better facilities, where we can offer more prize money and as locally as possible.\" In practice that means Lingfield (60 miles away), Brighton (75 miles) or Fontwell (100 miles).</p> <p>No planning inspector wants to be told he must change his mind and say yes to 800 new houses or be responsible for the closure of a long-established sports ground. Nor does the British Horseracing Authority wish to hear that a racecourse faces the axe if it does not immediately hand the track an extra half-dozen weekend fixtures.</p> <p>But such is the case and, if no one is prepared to intervene, a business will close that ought to be perfectly viable and racing will lose its local connection with a large community not short of prosperous pockets.</p> <p>The BHA would say that it is in no position to hand out new fixtures like so many sweets, especially at a time when there is so much pressure on the funds available for prize money. And after all, there is no racecourse in the country whose position would not be improved by a handful of extra Sunday dates. Northern and Arena owns many such fixtures and could make Folkestone viable just by moving some of them here.</p> <p>But why would it do that when those same fixtures can generate a much better income elsewhere? Instead Folkestone will be allowed to die and its possessions shared out among the survivors.</p> <p>It would be nice to think racing's bad news would end with the closure of this track and of Hereford but the portability of fixtures means that any course, if part of a large group, must work very hard to avoid being the least profitable in that group. So long as the present system persists, British racegoers must learn not to get sentimental about venues.</p>",
  "<p>It was party time at the North Greenwich Arena, as America and Spain bid farewell to the Olympics with a manic basketball disco. YMCA thundered through the speakers, lights went off, cheerleaders glittered, and lovers kissed on command from the TV cameras. National dress was the order of the day \u2013 stars and stripes ponchos, dressing gowns and wigs versus red and yellow Superman outfits, transfers and head paint. \"Who is here for Spain?\" asked the over-exuberant warm-up man. He was answered by a polite cheer. \"And who is here for the USA?\" A ferocious roar followed.</p> <p>So this fabulous celebration of grafting-for-tuppence amateurism and multi-billion pound business came to a conclusion that would have left both bin-wagon driver Natasha Perdue and Lord Visa happy. The USA triumphed 107-100 over the Spanish. At half-time the US had a one-point lead. Shortly into the second period, it was Spain who were ahead, even if few in the crowd believed they could actually win. This US team is as feted as it is wealthy \u2013 even the Obamas are dream team groupies. Michelle hugged the entire team after the match against France, and looked thrilled to get the opportunity, while the President verged on the star-struck as he joked with the big men after a pre-Olympics friendly in Manchester. The Obamas were absent for the final, but power couples were still to be seen \u2013 Arnold Schwarzenegger and Boris Johnson looked like a team made in heaven. This might well be the last dream team we see. At the next Olympics, a rule might be introduced to restrict the number of players over the age of 23 to three \u2013 as in the football. In a strange way, this might liberate the next generation to play more fantasy basketball.</p> <p>Legendary coach Mike Krzyzewski insisted the final would be his last match in charge and his team wanted to give him a deserving send-off. Before this match, his record was 61 games won, one lost \u2013 the only defeat coming against Greece in 2006. The Spanish were always going to put up a fight, though. And boy did they tough it out here.</p> <p>Sports-wise, they are great at everything these days \u2013 football, tennis, formula one, handball, cycling. The only thing they can't do is economics \u2013 but you could say that about most countries. In 1994, the Spanish reached the Olympic final, only to be beaten by a USA team featuring a young Michael Jordan, and since then it's been glory pretty much all the way. They won the 2006 World Cup in Japan, and then two successive Eurobaskets in 2009 and 2011. The current team features a number of NBA players including the seven-foot Gasol brothers, Marc and Pau. This match was a replay of the basketball final in Beijing \u2013 and this time the Spanish ran the USA even closer.</p> <p>The USA made clear before the Olympics that it wasn't a question of whether their team of moneyed all-stars won, it was how. The plan was to do it in a style that honoured, and possibly challenged, the original dream team of Magic Johnson, Michael Jordan, Larry Bird et al. Well, they won, but Magic et al can rest assured they remain the supreme dreamers. There have been glorious moments \u2013 Kevin Durant and Carmelo Anthony have been hitting three-pointers with their eyes shut, and LeBron James became the first American in Olympic history to achieve a triple double against Australia (10 points, 10 assists and 10 rebounds, in other words the perfect all-round performance). They've never looked like losing, yet there has been something mechanistic about the performances \u2013 a shortage of thrills, spills and insouciant dribbles.</p> <p>Before the Olympics, there was so much pre-emptive criticism that these immensely talented individuals could only play as individuals that they have gone the other way \u2013 sacrificed the flair for a Protestant work ethic. After their first game against France, Krzyzewski, who assisted the original dream team, said that if anything his team were overpassing.</p> <p>Meanwhile the Spanish played like their football team \u2013 patient, probing, always looking for the sly killer pass. For every three-pointer Durant scored, Juan-Carlos Navarro responded with one of his own, and in the nimble-footed giant Pau Gasol they had possibly the best player on the pitch. But in the final third of the match, James and Kobe Bryant \u2013 who has announced his retirement from the international team \u2013 stamped their authority, Chris Paul controlled from the back and Durant just couldn't stop scoring. Thirty seconds before the end they called a timeout simply to celebrate, which seemed a little churlish. The subs came on to play out time, the hooter went and the dream team chest-bumped and fist-bumped for all they were worth. Born In The USA blazed out of the speaker system, and everybody forgot that Bruce Springsteen wrote the song as a critique of American imperialism.</p>",

  "<p>An initiative to flag potential terrorist threats at an Boston airport has led to to widespread racial profiling of passengers, it was reported Sunday.</p> <p>A report by the New York Times found that more than 30 federal officers involved in the \"behaviour detection\" programme at Logan International Airport said that the operation targets black and Hispanic people as well as those of a Middle Eastern appearance.</p> <p>The claims will come as an embarrassment to air security chiefs, who had been touting the initiative as a model for transport hubs across the US. It also comes at time when the Obama administration has attacked the use of racial profiling by law enforcement authorities in Arizona and elsewhere.</p> <p>The programme was brought in to allow officers to stop, search and question passengers deemed to be acting suspiciously.</p> <p>Under the initiative, specially trained \"assessors\" would monitor security lines at check-ins and pull aside those observed to be displaying tell-tale signs \u2013 such as avoiding eye contact, fidgeting or sweating.</p> <p>Passengers considered suspicious are then taken away for more intensive questioning.</p> <p>But the system has led to de facto racial profiling, it is claimed. Thirty-two officers have submitted written complaints to the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) over the targeting of minorities by colleagues.</p> <p>Some of the stop and searches were the result of pressure from manager who hoped that it would lead to the discovery of drugs, outstanding arrest warrants and fraudulent immigration documents.</p> <p>As a result, assessors have been looking for people who fit certain profiles \u2013 such as Hispanics travelling to Miami, or black people wearing baseball caps backwards, it is claimed.</p> <p>\"They just pull aside anyone who they don't like the way they look \u2013 if they are black and have expensive clothes or jewellery, or if they are Hispanic,\" one white officer told the New York Times.</p> <p>In an anonymous complaint to the TSA obtained by the newspaper, an officer wrote: \"The behaviour detection program is no longer a behaviour-based program, but it is a racial profiling program.\"</p> <p>Passengers have also complained of the seemingly discriminatory practice.</p> <p>Kenneth Boatner, a black psychologist and educational consultant, was detained for nearly half an hour while attempting to travel to Atlanta on business last month. Agents examined belongings \u2013 including patients' clinical notes \u2013 after singling him out.</p> <p>In an interview with the New York Times, Boatner said he felt humiliated and that the officers never explained why he had been targeted.</p> <p>But he suspected it was because of his race and attire \u2013 he was wearing sweat pants, a white T-shirt and high-top sneakers at the time.</p> <p>\"I had never been subjected to anything like that,\" Boatner said.</p> <p>In a statement, the TSA said the programme at Logan \"in no way encourages or tolerates profiling\" and that passengers are not allowed to be pulled aside based on their nationality, race, ethnicity or religion.</p> <p>\"If any of these claims prove accurate, we will take immediate and decisive action to ensure there are consequences to such activity,\" the agency added.</p>",
  "<p>Two Afghan policemen have shot dead a senior commander and eight other officers, the latest in a string of attacks by rogue security forces that are poisoning efforts to build up the police and army as foreign troops head home.</p> <p>The attack in south-western Nimruz province near the Iranian border on Saturday was the fifth in less than a week to involve men in uniform turning on their comrades or foreign trainers.</p> <p>The attackers were local men who had only signed up for the police three months ago, said Shakila Hakimi, head of the Nimruz provincial council. In an added twist, the pair targeted the man who had vouched for their trustworthiness, the provincial head of criminal investigations, Abdul Hadi Azizi, said.</p> <p>Mohammad Eesa was based in the provincial capital, but was making a brief visit to the troubled Delaram district to discuss the security situation, he said. \"These two man came yesterday because they knew Eesa and through him had been introduced to the district police chief and got their weapons and uniform,\" Azizi said by phone, after visiting the site of the shooting.</p> <p>The men opened fire in the yard of the district police chief's office, killing Eesa and eight others, and wounding another man before they were themselves shot, he added. \"This was a very sophisticated effort by the insurgents,\" Azizi said. \"Eesa was a good guy, very honest. He was cheated by these two guys as he didn't know they had a connection with the Taliban.\"</p> <p>The insurgent group claimed credit for the attack, which came just a day after policemen shot dead six US soldiers in neighbouring Helmand province.</p> <p>It was the bloodiest single day for foreign troops in the province since six British soldiers were killed by a roadside bomb in early March, and a grim reminder of the growing threat foreign forces face not just from the Taliban but also from their supposed allies.</p> <p>Three US Marine Corps special operations troops were shot dead early on Friday in Sangin district, a northern corner of the province that has seen heavy fighting. The killers were an Afghan police commander and some of his men, who had invited the US officers to join them for a meal and to discuss security.</p> <p>In the evening, an Afghan policeman shot dead a further three US soldiers as they exercised on a joint base about 40 miles south-west of the provincial capital.</p> <p>On Tuesday, two Afghan soldiers killed a US soldier and injured two others in eastern Paktia province, and on Thursday two other Afghan soldiers opened fire on a group outside another base in the east, although the only person killed was one of the gunmen.</p> <p>So far this year 37 foreign soldiers and military contractors have been killed in 27 such attacks, far more than in 2011. They have become such a commonplace threat that foreign units working with Afghan forces are often watched by armed \"guardian angels\" from their own ranks.</p> <p>In a sign of growing concern, President Hamid Karzai issued a rare condemnation of the deaths of foreign soldiers, and ordered an investigation into shootings in Helmand and Paktia. \"The enemy \u2026 does not want to see Afghanistan have a strong security force, targets military trainers,\" Karzai said in a statement that described the gunmen as \"terrorists in Afghan security uniform\".</p> <p>Nato commanders argue that the attackers account for a tiny portion of security forces, now more than 300,000 strong, and say many are driven by personal grudges rather than loyalty to the Taliban or other insurgent groups.</p> <p>But the shootings are disproportionately damaging to morale, and in some ways the attacks on Afghans from within their own forces are more worrying than the attacks on foreign forces.</p> <p>The Nato trainers will eventually head home, leaving the Afghan police and army to fight a hardened insurgency, a challenge that will be made much tougher by mistrust in their own ranks.</p>",
  "<p>Gut-wrenching renditions of Mexican popular classics combined with a taboo-breaking personality and an iron liver ensured that Chavela Vargas, who has died aged 93, lived her own legend to the full. Vargas's raw, rasping voice and intimate arrangements stripped down well-known rancheras, boleros, revolutionary ballads and tangos to leave them as haunting laments, punctuated by waves of tenderness and bitter irony.</p> <p>In the 1990s, the Spanish film-maker Pedro Almod\u00f3var, whom Vargas described as her \"soulmate\", included her music in his films and championed her work, thus ensuring that she will be remembered not only as a tequila-soaked cantina singer from Latin America, but also an international artist who could sell out the most formal venues. \"Chavela Vargas turned abandon and desolation into a cathedral within which we all fit,\" Almod\u00f3var wrote after her death. \"She emerged reconciled with the errors she had made and ready to make them again.\"</p> <p>Vargas was born in Costa Rica. By her own account, she hardly knew her parents and was brought up by relatives in the countryside, dreaming of the day she would escape to bigger things. Vargas left for Mexico as a teenager and, after a while singing on the streets, became a fixture of the effervescent artistic scene of the post-revolution years. Even in that context, she stood out. She not only slept with women, but also sang love songs about them, wore trousers, smoked cigars, drank heavily, carried a loaded pistol and credited her recovery from polio to shamans.</p> <p>\"Chavela carries with her an aura of grace, charm and a legend,\" the writer and journalist Paco Ignacio Taibo said in a 2009 television documentary about his friend's life, \"but she is also an emotionally possessed earthquake.\"</p> <p>Vargas was particularly close to the painter Frida Kahlo. \"I admired her deeply,\" the singer said, \"but my love was much bigger than my admiration.\" She lived for a couple of years with Kahlo and her husband Diego Rivera, whom she described as \"a bit amphibian in his ways\".</p> <p>Vargas was also inextricably associated with Jos\u00e9 Alfredo Jim\u00e9nez, the singer and composer of many of the best known ranchera songs. The title of her 2002 autobiography Y Si Quieres Saber de Mi Pasado (And If You Want to Know About My Past) comes from a line from a Jim\u00e9nez song that continues \"... it will be necessary to tell a lie\".</p> <p>Vargas and Jim\u00e9nez would go on drinking binges together that lasted for days at a time and included helping each other serenade the different women they desired. But while Jim\u00e9nez died young, Vargas continued to drink bars dry until she was in her 60s. She then stopped, abruptly. \"Life offered me the most beautiful things that a human being can have,\" she said, \"and I preferred to sink into alcohol.\"</p> <p>Vargas suffered deeply from the homophobic atmosphere that enveloped Mexico and helped ensure she was not fully embraced by her adopted homeland until after Spain had elevated her to stardom. \"I opened my arms and I said to the world: 'Come here, let's talk.' And the world and I talked every night and sometimes it rejected me,\" she said in <a href=\"http://elpais.com/diario/2009/05/10/eps/1241936812_850215.html\" title=\"\">an interview with the Spanish newspaper El Pa\u00eds in 2009</a>. \"It required tears of blood for me to get ahead.\"</p> <p>In her final years, for all the talk of pain, she was also notably satisfied with her achievements. She continued to travel and perform, making the last of her 80 albums, La Luna Grande, in 2011 \u2013 a homage to the poetry of Federico Garc\u00eda Lorca, with whose spirit she said she chatted regularly.</p> <p>\"I am proud that I do not owe anybody anything, and it is wonderful to feel free,\" she said in 2009. \"Now I have the desire to lie down in death's lap, and I am sure that will be quite beautiful.\"</p> <p>\u2022 Isabel \"Chavela\" Vargas Lizano, singer, born 17 April 1919; died 5 August 2012</p>",
  "<p>On 5 and 6 June earthlings gathered to watch Venus cross the face of the sun. We won't have that opportunity again until 2117, but on 10 November 2084 something even more wonderful will be on offer. The Earth will transit across the sun \u2013 <a href=\"http://astroblogger.blogspot.co.uk/2012/06/transit-of-earth-from-mars-november-10.html\" title=\"\">for observers on Mars</a>, that is. This time the valiant speck rowing across the solar disc will be us. Will anyone be there on Mars to see it?</p> <p>Fifty years ago, the answer would have been a confident yes; some even hoped we'd get there in time to view the last Earth transit, in 1984. Then the possibility dwindled as Nasa turned away from manned space travel towards robotic landers such as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/science/2012/aug/06/mars-curiosity-rover-nasa-perfect-landing\" title=\"\">Curiosity</a>.</p> <p>Now, the answer seems to be turning to yes again. Nasa plans to send humans to Mars in the 2030s, and sees Curiosity as preparing the way for this rather than undercutting it. Meanwhile, a private company, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars_One\" title=\"\">Mars One</a>, has been founded by the Dutch entrepreneurs Bas Lansdorp and Arno Wielders to try to beat Nasa by sending four people to Mars in 2023. They will not just plant a footprint; they will settle, and four more people will join them every two years until the colony is self-sustaining. They will be emigrants, not explorers: initially, at least, there will be no return trips, as it's much easier to get people to Mars than to get them back.</p> <p>As if this were not astounding enough, Mars One will raise the $6bn needed by doubling as a reality TV show, with private investors. Volunteers will undergo 10 years of training under the public eye, then viewers will vote on which four go first. We'll see them on their seven-month journey, then watch and talk to them as they land, assemble their homes, set out solar panels, melt Martian ice and grow food. It will be a shared ride; the company have already recruited a veteran of the original Dutch Big Brother to organise it.</p> <p>Lansdorp and Wielders are gambling on human curiosity \u2013 on human nature. You could even say that they are getting humanity to Mars using human nature itself as fuel. If they succeed, Nasa will land to find a Big Brother house already there. How will Nasa respond? Will it go sooner, be bolder, plan a colony instead of a visit? Almost anything could happen.</p> <p>The nightmare possibilities of Mars One project are obvious. If the media novelty wears off, the settlers might be abandoned a few years after landing. Technical failures, with loss of life, could scupper future support for Mars travel. And Mars may become the property of a private company \u2013 a terrifying thought. But perhaps there is hope in the heart of these terrors.</p> <p>In the 1990s, the entrepreneur Craig Venter similarly threatened to beat the public <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/science/human-genome-project\" title=\"\">Human Genome Project</a> to the sequencing of the human genome. Had he won outright, humanity's genetic essence would now be owned by private investors charging for its use. Instead, the project raced heroically faster, and they and Venter announced a joint result in 2000, with access free to all. Venter later said this was all he wanted: to make things happen.</p> <p>Could we see something like this with Mars? Also, what about Earth? The big puzzle facing Earth-dwellers at the moment is how to motivate ourselves to do things clearly worth doing, but lacking immediate pay-offs. Our feeble response to the environmental crisis is a glaring case. To outwit ourselves, we need to harness our own psychology in new ways, and trick ourselves into doing good.</p> <p>Could there be a genius of human motivation out there, ready to dream up some psychologically astute Earth One project? It might rest on some strange or frightening ploy at first, but if it rescues life on Earth, we'll have it.</p> <p>And if it works, second-generation human Martians might not only watch the transit of Earth in 2084, but marvel at how that little round silhouette bears such foolish but inventive beings, and how they have achieved such wonders despite (and because of) themselves.</p>",
  "<p>As \"Dog the Bounty Hunter\", Duane Chapman has made a name for himself tracking down offenders on his hit US reality TV show, but his own criminal past came back to haunt him when the UK government refused to grant him a visa.</p> <p>Chapman, whose show has run for eight seasons in the States, was due to appear on Channel 5's new series of Celebrity Big Brother from Wednesday but the UK Border Agency denied him entry because of his involvement in the 1976 murder of Jerry Oliver in Pampa, Texas.</p> <p>Oliver was shot dead by one of Chapman's friends when they went to buy marijuana from him. Chapman was outside waiting in a car when Oliver was killed inside his house during a struggle. Nevertheless, he was convicted of first-degree murder and served one and a half years of a five-year sentence.</p> <p>Chapman said he was not seeking to minimise his involvement \u2013 \"I should not have been there, that's that\" \u2013 but insisted he had turned his life around. His show, screened on Sky2 and Pick TV in the UK, features him praying with his family for safety and for a successful mission \"in Jesus's name\" before going to work on criminals, who frequently repent in his presence.</p> <p>A sworn letter provided by Charles Love, a Pampa police officer at the time of the murder, provided as supporting evidence for Chapman's visa application, described the bounty hunter's role as \"minor\".</p> <p>\"I'd like to see your country and I have a lot of fans there and I'd like to meet them,\" Chapman told the Guardian from Hawaii. \"I have always wanted to come here.\" He was bound by confidentiality from confirming his scheduled appearance in the Celebrity Big Brother House but expressed hope the \"red tape\" could be overcome.</p> <p>However, his wife, Beth, who is also his business partner and co-star, was more forthright. \"It's just incredible that something that he did 33 years ago is just haunting him,\" she said. \"It prevents him making a living. Our society is so unforgiving it seems, no matter how many good things we do.\"</p> <p>She pointed to <a href=\"http://www.pinewswire.net/article/boy-meets-dog-the-bounty-hunter-through-make-a-wish-foundation/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+PINewswire+%28PI+Newswire%29\" title=\"\">her husband's work with the Make-A-Wish Foundation</a>.
