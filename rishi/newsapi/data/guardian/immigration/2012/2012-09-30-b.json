  "<p>This year has seen a record loss of sea ice, and greenhouse gas concentrations above the Arctic at their highest point for possibly 800,000 years. Crop-wrecking droughts and record temperatures have scorched the US midwest.

It remains, however, one of the greatest threats to human progress, and tackling it could be a huge economic opportunity.</p> <p>There is so much to gain from investing with speed and scale in a modern low-carbon economy that the failure to do so appears both reckless and short-sighted.

The <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/sep/17/arctic-collapse-sea-ice\" title=\"\">perilous acceleration of Arctic ice loss</a>, and the imminent threat of irreversible climate change poses a similar ultimatum to the economic system that is pushing us over the brink. For society's sake I hope this time we redecorate.</p> <p>Fortunately, many people are queuing up to propose better designs, rather than just cursing the interiors, as you can read about <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/interactive/2012/oct/01/50-months-climate-interactive\">here</a>.</p> <p>Monday 1 October marks the halfway point in <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2008/aug/01/climatechange.carbonemissions\" title=\"\">a 100-month countdown to a game of climate roulette</a>.</p> <p>On a very conservative estimate, 50 months from now, the dice become loaded against us in terms of keeping under <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2009/dec/18/copenhagen-five-climate-scenarios\" title=\"\">a 2C temperature rise</a>. This level matters because beyond it an environmental \"domino effect\" is likely to operate. In a volatile and unpredictable dynamic, things like melting ice, and the release of carbon from the planet's surface <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2011/jan/05/climate-change-feedback-loops\" title=\"\">are set to feed off each other</a>, accelerating and reinforcing the warming effect.</p> <p>The time frame follows an estimate of risk of rising greenhouse gas concentrations from the world's leading authority on climate change, <a href=\"http://www.ipcc.ch/\" title=\"\">the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC),</a> that passed a certain point, it will no longer be \"likely\" that we stay the right side of the line. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2010/dec/01/cancun-climate-talks-island-states-sea-levels\" title=\"\">Some consider even a 2C rise too much</a>, but it is the limit that the EU and others have signed up to.</p> <p>Extraordinarily, however, in spite of the stakes, the issue has receded from the political frontline like a wave shrinking down a beach. This could, though, merely be a prelude to it returning with a vengeance. Politicians may have turned their backs, others have not.</p> <p>Here's what a broad selection of groups and individuals who range from the Women's Institute to Oxfam and Margaret Thatcher's former environmental adviser, say in an open letter published in the Guardian today to the coalition government and opposition:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"This year has seen the record loss of sea ice, and greenhouse gas concentrations above the Arctic at their highest point for possibly 800,000 years. Crop-wrecking droughts and record temperatures have scorched the American Mid-West.\"</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>But, to our dismay, climate change and the weather volatility it fuels have fallen far down the political agenda when it needs to be at the top. It remains, however, one of the greatest threats to human progress, and tackling it is a huge economic opportunity</p> </blockquote> <p>They call on both the coalition and Labour to spell out what they will do differently in the next 50 months to prevent a climate catastrophe.</p> <p>Individually some go further. James Gustave Speth, the former head of the United Nations Development Programme <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/oct/01/50-months-james-gustave-speth\" title=\"\">appeals for mass, non-violent protest</a>.</p> <p>The climate scientist Prof Kevin Anderson says it is too late for rich countries to \"grow\" their way out of the problem and must find a new way to run their economies. He says everyone, including climate scientists, must reduce their emissions and he commits to lowering his own.</p> <p>Barbara Stocking, chief executive of Oxfam also says it's <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/oct/01/50-months-barbara-stocking\" title=\"\">time for lifestyle change</a> in the wealthy world, especially if we are to tackle global poverty.</p> <p>Sir Crispin Tickell, former UK permanent representative to the UN and the man credited with persuading Margaret Thatcher as prime inister to acknowledge and act on global warming, calls for a World Environment Organisation to simplify and make effective the wide range of international treaties and agreements.</p> <p>Many more people describe the huge opportunities for economic recovery and better lives that could come from a great transition to a low-carbon, high well-being economy, but which are currently going begging.</p> <p>Change is in the air, in spite of the current official blind spot and attempt to return to business as usual, or even go \"backwards\" as today's joint letter of concern warns. Why, for example, do we <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2012/sep/07/george-osborne-north-sea-oil\" title=\"\">encourage the oil industry with tax breaks</a>, when <a href=\"http://www.neweconomics.org/sites/neweconomics.org/files/UnburnableCarbon_WEB.pdf\" title=\"\">we know</a> that to avoid runaway climate change we can only afford to burn around a fifth of the fossil fuels left in the ground, making it unburnable?</p> <p>The ideas from our 50 contributors are just a taste of the creativity and innovation available. The failure to act \"appears both reckless and short sighted\" they write. Yet in the government, the situation appears to be like the old joke about the shopkeeper. When a customer asks for a new product, the shopkeeper replies, \"No, sorry mate, people keep asking me for that and I keep telling them, there's just no call for it.\"</p> <p>Whether it was rebuilding Europe after the second world war, or action to protect the ozone layer, we know it is possible to put aside narrow self-interest. Leadership like that goes down in history.</p> <p>What we do in the next 50 months is not a choice between what we have done in the past and what we are doing today. It is an invitation to embark on the most extraordinary, exhilarating and challenging adventure our society has yet faced, learning how to thrive without disastrously destabilising the climate on which we depend. Every step matters, and it matters most that we start walking.</p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.onehundredmonths.org\" title=\"\">100 months and counting...</a></p>",
  "<p>Slumping into the cramped confines of my seat, recovering my composure after a frantic, protracted check-in that made me mislay my wallet, almost miss my flight, and become \u20ac100 poorer, the result of my experiment in travel seemed obvious: boats and trains beat the pains of planes any day.</p> <p>But the real problem with air travel is not the carbon footprint, the hassle of security checks, the tedium of the boarding gate, the soulless sprawl of the hire car lot, or Ryanair's excessive excess charges and unavoidable fees for allegedly optional extras. The deeper issue is that how we travel reflects and shapes the way we think, and we have become a society of airheads.</p> <p>I started thinking about this because of a recurring desire to recreate an annual childhood journey by ferry and overnight train to visit our family in northern Italy. Was it just nostalgia pulling me, or is something of real value lost at 30,000ft? I decided to go to Italy the old way and return the new, to see how the experiences really compared.</p> <p>The passenger terminal at Dover docks did not provide the most promising start, having all the charm of a 1970s coach station. But once on deck, with the <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m24_-tc4xGk\" title=\"white cliffs\">white cliffs</a> fading into the distance, I had a real sense of a proper trip starting, something that the palm-sweat-inducing jolt of take-off doesn't provide. The sedate passage of the ship, the gradual emergence of the French coast, and the disembarkation in the open air, with a real town in clear sight, provided a sense of the continuities between places. In contrast, planes simply transport you from one anonymous, homogenous edgeland to another, between airports virtually identical in their black and yellow signage and multinational franchises. It's the difference between travel \u2013 a movement between places in which the journey is part of the experience \u2013 and transit, the utilitarian linking of here and there, in which the destination becomes all that matters and the transfer simply something to put up with.</p> <p>This was most evident in the gaps between each leg of the journey. Stopping for an early dinner in Paris at one of Caf\u00e9 Charlot's street tables, the attraction of this is obvious. In contrast, the park next door to Gare Calais Ville is not exactly the idyllic location for a tasty picnic gathered from a nearby boulangerie. It appears to be a garden of lost souls, populated by people with vacant stares, not so much filling time as biding it, abiding in it, with no sense of anything to do. However, places like these and the makeshift tents and camps of asylum-seekers viewed from the bus from port to train station \u2013 interesting rather than obviously pleasant \u2013 often become the most memorable parts of journeys, and you only see them when travelling indirectly, in the interstices of the conventionally appealing.</p> <p>Consumer culture has made us too accustomed to getting only what we want, no more and no less. Experiences are atomised into their component parts, the extraneous excised in an attempt to maximise the impact of the parts we prefer, with no thought to how their context changes them. But if you only ever get what you know you already want, serendipity is denied and the richness of experience is reduced to the button-pushing delivery of crude hits of fun, excitement, novelty or reassurance, often consumed in the private bubble of home or headphone.</p> <p>In this respect, train travel on commuter routes has, alas, gone the same way as flying, as I am reminded on the two-hour TGV ride from Calais to Paris. But on longer distances, there is a palpably different attitude among travellers. Accompanying us in our four-berth couchette from Paris to Milan, for example, were Amanda and Ian from New Zealand. They were taking this trip because Amanda has a wonderful and vivid memory of stepping out of an overnight train into a Venetian dawn 20-odd years ago. Say what you like about flying, but <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cjLlR9aJRA\" title=\"North Terminal at Gatwick\">North Terminal at Gatwick</a> just doesn't have the same effect.</p> <p>In some ways train travel demands more of us. But even at 5.50am, after a night of interrupted sleep in a narrow bunk, the great terminus of <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7A3TVZAQIc\" title=\"Milano Centrale\">Milano Centrale</a> has infinitely more charm than any baggage reclaim area. It is a contemporary malaise to avoid things that require effort but are rewarding in favour of gains in convenience that come at the price of blandness and loss of variety.</p> <p>How different the flight back was, starting with the frantic and pointless shifting of luggage from one bag to another required by Ryanair's punitive baggage policy. Worse, as I went to pay the \u20ac100 excess, I couldn't find my wallet, which had slipped unnoticed into the long-gone hold bag in the confusion. After rushing through security dangerously and predictably late, yet not predictably enough for us to have relaxed in the first place, the long queue of passengers is still boarding. The only redeeming feature of the whole flight was the magnificent view of the Alps from above.</p> <p>It might be objected that \"slow travel\" is just an indulgence of the time and cash-rich. But you actually gain holiday time when travelling is an integral part of the experience, because you lose none to mere transit. As for expense, the gap was not so wide, and was almost nothing after the excess baggage fee. And yet despite all I've written, I admit I have another trip coming up and, guess what, I'm flying. I'm just another airhead, led by apparent ease and convenience away from what is more profoundly rewarding.</p>",
  "<p>Barack Obama and Mitt Romney were gearing up on Sunday for three days of intense preparations for the first of the US presidential debates, which is almost certain to be the Republican candidate's last chance to turn around his struggling campaign.</p> <p>The 90-minute debate in Denver on Wednesday will be the first opportunity Americans will have to see the two candidates side by side and compare not only their policies but how they look and behave. The outcome could be decided by a hesitation in explaining a policy, a smart riposte or a display of arrogance.</p> <p>Each side took part in the usual ritual of talking up their opponent at the weekend in an attempt to dampen expectations. Paul Ryan, the Republican vice-presidential candidate, speaking on Fox News on Sunday, described Obama as \"a very gifted speaker\". Supporters of Obama claimed Romney had won nearly all of the debates during his gruelling nomination process.</p> <p>Estimates for the number of viewers in America range from 50 million to 60 million, almost double the number who watched the party conventions. There will be two additional debates, in Long Island and Florida, but it is the first that usually has the most impact.</p> <p>Obama, with significant poll leads in the swing states, can play defence, just getting through the evening without making a mistake. The onus is on Romney to make an impression.</p> <p>Chris Christie, the Republican governor of New Jersey, acknowledged on NBC's Meet the Press on Sunday that Romney would need to do well in the first debate. \"You're going to have tens of millions of people for the first time really tuning in and paying attention to this race ... On Thursday morning the entire narrative of this race is going to change.\"</p> <p>Both candidates were readying themselves for three days of intensive preparation. Obama, after a campaign event in Las Vegas on Sunday night, heads to Henderson half-an-hour's drive away for three days of preparation. Romney will also do three days of preparation, arriving in Denver Monday.</p> <h2>Do debates make a difference?</h2> <p>Some political analysts argue that the debates do not matter, usually ending inconclusively and quickly forgotten. Others point to debate moments over the last 52 years, since the first televised debate between Kennedy and Nixon, that have turned out to decisive.</p> <p>John McCain, failed Republican presidential candidate in 2008, who has debated with both Obama and Romney, did not anticipate any \"breakthrough\" moments, saying they they have become rarer in recent decades.</p> <p>\"I can't remember the last time there was one of these comments that grabbed everybody's attention because, frankly, the candidates are too well prepared,\" McCain told CNN on Sunday.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396937031\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2008/09/27/0926_stage_460x276.jpg\" alt=\"Barack Obama and John McCain\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Then Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama and  John McCain in their first presidential debate in 2008.

Hillary Clinton was a seemingly insurmountable 30 points ahead of Obama in the race for the Democratic presidential nomination until she hesitated when asked a question in a 2007 debate about illegal immigration. </p> <p>Tad Devine, a Democratic strategist involved in presidential campaigns from Mondale in 1984 through to Kerry in 2004, believes debates are important. He recalled Mondale jumped 23 points in a poll after having a good first debate with Reagan and that Gore lost a three to four point lead in 2000 after his debate with George W Bush.</p> <p>He argues it is possible for Romney to use the debate to mount a comeback.</p> <p>\"Romney has got to get himself back into the race. He needs voters to have one more look at him and this is it,\" said Devine.</p> <p>\"If the Romney team are smart, they will not try to do it all in the first debate. They need to make up some ground and get people to like this guy a little. It is all about how he comports himself. If they are smart and he starts repairing his image, you can change a lot in 90 minutes.\"</p> <h2>Preparations</h2> <p>Romney's campaign team has long argued that the debates are pivotal and, because of that, the candidate has been rehearsing since at least August, locking himself away for mock-up debates with senator Rob Portman from Ohio standing in for Obama.</p> <p>According to the Obama team, the president has had less time to prepare because of his White House duties, though he has occasionally taken time out for visits to the Democratic national committee's headquarters in Washington for debate sessions, with senator John Kerry standing in for Romney.</p> <p>The preparations at the rival camps will be intensive, with soundbites rehearsed over and over again. They will prepare on replicas of the Denver stage, the rehearsals filmed and analysed. </p> <p>Obama, with a tendency for long answers, is being encouraged by staff to be snappier. One of his advisers, Jen Psaki, said last week: \"The president is familiar with his own loquaciousness and his tendency to give long, substantive answers.\" </p> <p>The relentless preparations include appearance as well as policy, with ties and suits chosen to avoid blending in with the stage backdrop.</p> <p>Devine remembers that, in spite of all the detailed preparations for one Gore-Bush debate, one of the problems was a failure to check how Gore's make-up would look on camera. Viewers complained he looked \"too orangey\".</p> <h2>Expectations</h2> <p>It has become commonplace that, ahead of the debates, the two camps talk up the opposing candidate in an effort to lower expectations. Romney supporters talk up Obama's oratorical skills, while the president's campaign has been claiming that Romney has had a great deal of practice at debates during his nomination process.</p> <p>In reality, neither candidate is a great debater. Often forgotten is that Obama, while one of the best orators in the US, performed poorly at debates during the during Democratic primaries and caucuses before the 2008 election, though he improved towards the end. The White House spokesman, Jay Carney, at the time a reporter, admitted last week that Obama had become the nominee in 2008 \"in spite of his debate performances\".</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396937032\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2012/1/20/1327024713757/Mitt-Romney-and-Newt-Ging-007.jpg\" alt=\"Mitt Romney and Newt Gingrich in the CNN debate\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mitt Romney and Newt Gingrich in a CNN debate earlier this year.

Obama will seek to exploit this to the fullest while Romney has to try to explain it away.</p> <p>Romney's success against Gingrich in debate was attributed at the time to his debate coach, Brett O'Donnell, who subsequently left his staff. O'Donnell, in an interview with the Associated Press last week, said Romney has to try to confront the 47% remark. \"He has to turn the 47% and make sure people understand the reasoning behind that argument, how that's the result of the president's policies.\"</p> <p>The dominant issue will be the slow economic recovery, from an unemployment rate over 8% to the burgeoning deficit and taxation. Other issues will be healthcare reform, immigration and women's rights. Foreign policy is not on the agenda until the final debate.</p> <h2>Debates that made a difference</h2> <p>The first televised debate between Kennedy and Nixon in 1960 cost the Republican the election. Kennedy looked better on television while Nixon appeared unshaven and ill at ease.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396937033\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2008/10/14/kennedy460.jpg\" alt=\"John F Kennedy, Richard Nixon, 1960 presidential debate \" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">John F Kennedy and Richard Nixon wait for the start of their televised presidential debate on 26 September 1960.

In 1980, Reagan won a debate and the election with the question \"Ask yourself, 'Are you better off now than you were four years ago?'\"</p> <p>Gore came off second best in a debate with Bush in 2000. Devine recalled that the Gore team thought it had won but the Bush campaign successfully spun to the press that Gore had looked arrogant, sighing repeatedly throughout the debate and rolling is eyes. The spin worked.</p>",
  "<p>My friend <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/g2/story/0,,395345,00.html\" title=\"Interview with Lou Kenton in the Guardian\">Lou Kenton</a>, who has died aged 104, was the oldest surviving British member of the International Brigades (IB) and a remarkable political activist with 40 years' membership of both the Communist and Labour parties.</p> <p>Born in Stepney, east London, to Jewish Ukrainian refugees, he was moved to join the Communist party in 1929 by the prevalence of antisemitism. A printer in Fleet Street in the 1930s, he was convenor of the Printing and Allied Trades Anti-Fascist Movement; was one of the brave hecklers at the Blackshirts' rally at Olympia, west London, in 1934; and was in the thick of things at the battle of Cable Street in the East End in 1936.</p> <p>He joined the IB in 1937 as an ambulance driver, but he also distributed supplies, evacuated Basque children and raised funds back in Britain. His first wife, Lillian, an Austrian refugee, also went to Spain and worked as a nurse. They later divorced. The defeat of the Spanish Republic left Lou briefly depressed, but at this time he met his second wife, Rafa, whom he married in 1941, and with whom he spent the rest of his long life.</p> <p>In the second world war he initially worked on a whaler in the south Atlantic. Back in Britain, he was badly injured in a bombing raid and was hospitalised for two years. After the war he worked as an organiser for the Communist party in London, and helped run the ex-servicemen's squatting movement. He incentivised recruitment by offering a trip to Paris for Bastille Day as a prize. The trip soon became an event in its own right and in 1947 it attracted 1,000 people who paid their own way.</p> <p>From these beginnings came Progressive Tours, for decades the principal travel company for holidays behind the iron curtain. Lou was central to the organising in 1955 of a commemorative rosarium in the Czech village of Lidice, the scene of one of the worst German atrocities of the second world war. He remained involved with the campaign for many years; in the 1990s he and Rafa were awarded the freedom of Lidice.</p> <p>Lou's faith in the Communist party was shattered by the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968, and both he and Rafa left to join the Labour party. Professionally, Lou returned to newspapers, working at the Financial Times well into his 70s. In retirement he found a new career, as a prolific maker of commemorative pottery for unions and other organisations. In 2009, he was one of the IB veterans awarded Spanish citizenship.</p> <p>Lou is survived by Rafa and their children, Judy and John.</p>",
  "<p>There's not a list long enough to detail all the benefits of international collaboration for students. Teachers and heads talk about how working with schools and students overseas motivates, inspires, adds real meaning and purpose to learning, is an opportunity to build soft skills, strengthens employability and develops an understanding other cultures. And this is just scratching the surface.</p> <p>But what about the impact on school leaders, teachers and staff?</p> <p>For Robert Ford, deputy head teacher, with responsibility for the curriculum, at Crickhowell High School, Powys, working with school leaders in other countries helps his school take its learning beyond its rural surroundings in Wales.</p> <p>He said: \"We are a very rural school in the Brecon Beacons in Wales and interacting with the wider world and accessing ideas and other people and schools is crucial for our wider understanding and meaningful educational experience.</p> <p>\"And this seems to be key for most schools; international collaboration helps staff to go beyond their own school grounds to seek ideas for improving their school, teaching practice and lessons.\"</p> <p>Robert has been involved with global learning for many years, on a range of projects, funding, programmes and worked with schools and educational boards around the world. As such, Crickhowell has designed programmes to ensure teachers, school leaders and support staff get contact with international partners - as well as students.</p> <p>\"For me it has been an incredible side to my development as a teacher and a school leader,\" he said. \"The experience of seeing classrooms and schools around the world in places as diverse as Siberia, Indonesia, Thailand, the USA and Canada makes me see education in a much more holistic way. It also allows me to use comparative knowledge of different educational systems in the way I carry out the decisions and plan for the future in a 21st century global world where education has never mattered more.\"</p> <p>Cookridge Primary in Yorkshire is another school embedding international collaboration into professional development for staff and lessons for students.</p> <p>It has an impressive portfolio of links and projects that include a wide-ranging funded partnership with Colegio Esperanza - a school in Mexico, funded collaboration with schools across in Finland, Slovakia, Ireland and another school in Birmingham for the national perspective as part of the British Council's Comenius multilateral scheme.</p> <p>Jo Speak, assistant head teacher, Cookridge Primary School said: \"We have teachers going to Europe for professional development. We have three members of staff in Finland, as we speak. So, we're looking forward to them sharing their ideas and development following the meetings there.\"</p> <p>Sending staff away on exchanges is all part of the grand plan for Cookridge Primary; to absorb and implement new ideas and practices picked up from international partners - and beyond.</p> <p>From approaches to teaching and pedagogy to the ways of working with outside agencies, Cookridge and its partner school in Mexico swap all their best brainwaves and practices. \"It's all about opening our eyes and questioning things that we take for granted or the way we've always done things. By working with leaders in other countries, we can enter into dialogue of why we do things. It's an added bonus to international collaboration,\" says Jo.</p> <p>She added: \"I've been really inspired by the dedication of teachers no matter where they are and the enthusiasm to work as a member of a team, whether there's the atlantic ocean between them; it's that building up of relationships, being creative and thinking up ideas that will help our learners no matter what country they're living in.\"</p> <p>Although lots of the lessons and projects inspired by these partnerships celebrate differences between cultures, it's exploring the shared agendas that reap most benefits for school leaders. Through the British Council's Comenius programme the school has been able to network with other schools in Europe to explore areas such as special educational needs, more able children or working with children from the travelling and Roma communities.</p> <p>Jo said: \"Whatever the focus is, it's an opportunity to work together to discuss different approaches and pedagogy, and it's that ability to carry on working with fellow colleagues and having dialogues to explore what works well and what doesn't.</p> <p>\"That's a great opportunity for our teachers and leaders in the UK to get out and work with colleagues across Europe.\"</p> <p>It's breaking out of that silo-style of working that appeals to many school leaders. Particularly head teachers.</p> <p>\"The role of a head in a school is quite challenging and sometimes quite an isolated role,\" says Derek Smith, head of Olashore International School in Nigeria. \"So there's quite a lot of support that can be found through links with heads from other schools; through conferences and social networking and so on.</p> <p>\"When you're a teacher, one of the things you don't often see is in another teacher's classroom and it's the same when you're a head. What you don't often see is other schools and what's being done successfully.\"</p> <p>Derek spends lots of time visiting local schools in his area, and, when he's in the UK, visiting schools here too. He also uses digital tools to connect with heads; LinkedIn for leaders in other countries and Blackberry Messenger (BBM) to talk to peers in Nigeria.</p> <p>Tools are important. For example, Derek is currently working with a group of school leaders via an initiative at the American University of Nigeria to set up a new teacher training group. They share ideas and contact through BBM, as it's the easiest way to communicate in Nigeria.</p> <p>He said: \"If you want to do something like that, you have to use a tool that the heads are happy to use. Most people don't have time to learn something else in addition to running their school. I think different countries have different key areas and if you want to connect to international heads you need to use something that doesn't make their life more difficult.\" </p> <p>As well as informing his approach to management and innovation in his school, international work and collaboration has played an interesting and crucial part in Derek's personal career development too. In 1995, back when he was a maths teacher in the UK, he volunteered with VSO, which set him on the path to becoming head of an international school.</p> <p>He said: \"I worked in a local school in Guinea-Bissau but it gave me a lot of opportunities to be involved in a lot of things. I set up teacher training workshops and through that I ended up having contacts with heads and other schools and that extended up to work with the Ministry of Education and European Union in country. That gave me a lot of the experience of dealing with people at different levels.\"</p> <p>Damian James, curriculum manager of health and life services at South West College, Northern Ireland, is another teacher turned leader whose career has developed thanks to experience with international collaboration. It all started around 15 years ago when he was a lecturer of travel and tourism at the college.</p> <p>He said: \"My colleagues applied for British Council funding for Comenius projects and I accompanied them on exchange visits, and so on. From there my role increased and changed as I became involved more in instigating projects and developing opportunities.\"</p> <p>Over time the college has evolved and he has moved into a management role.</p> <p>\"On a personal level, I have no doubt it has helped me move in to my management role within the college. I believe it has shown my ability to develop work from scratch, from an initial contact right through to either securing funding or coming up with ideas to collaborate on the different levels highlighted already.</p> <p>Working on international projects is a central aspect to Damian's role but he has seen the impact on the wider team too.</p> <p>\"International collaboration also offers a series of staff development opportunities from developing project management skills, to increasing enthusiasm and self-confidence for teaching,\" he said. \"It offers development opportunities outside of the routine - enhancing all-round abilities.</p> <p>\"It also promotes increased tolerance and respect for others, develops skills, motivation, capabilities and self-confidence which results in greater pride in college work. It also promotes teamwork and can provide an energy to college life, and add all round value. Crucially too, it helps the college be seen to be innovative and as offering exceptional educational opportunities, in turn helping to develop and enhance our reputation with local businesses and other stakeholders.\"</p> <h2>This content is brought to you by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/guardian-professional\" title=\"Guardian Professional\">Guardian Professional</a>.
