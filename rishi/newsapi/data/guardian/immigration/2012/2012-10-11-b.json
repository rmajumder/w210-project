  "<p>I never liked the guy in seat 7A anyway. That's probably business class, isn't it? So he was the one all stretched out smugly with his shoes off already and his complementary Bloody Mary and copy of Newsweek magazine as you were herded past towards the back. Or, if the plane was white and orange, he was the one who pushed past earlier in the queue, holding his printout boarding card in the air, shouting: \"Speedy boarding, yes.\" Paid an extra \u00a315 just so he can get on a couple of minutes earlier and sit near the front. Loser.</p> <p>Well, you're not so smug or speedy now, are you, now that your seat has been catapulted 153 metres away from the main chunk of fuselage, and lies broken in the dirt. To be honest, I didn't dislike him <em>that</em> much, not for this to happen. \"I think it's clear that this wouldn't have been a survivable area in the aircraft,\" says Anne, one of the air-crash investigators.</p> <p>They crash a plane, an old Boeing 727, into a dry lakebed in northern Mexico. <a href=\"http://www.channel4.com/programmes/the-plane-crash\" title=\"\"><strong>The Plane Crash</strong> </a>(Channel 4) it's called, unequivocally. And it's extraordinary television \u2013 mesmerising and terrifying, Strangely exciting too; that may have something to do with the soundtrack of urgent, sawing strings, not unlike the Spooks music.</p> <p>A plane crash is rarely caught on camera, and when it is it's usually all juddery, hand-held and amateur. Because this is done on purpose, with four years of meticulous planning behind it; it's filmed expertly, from many different angles (including from inside the cabin), and can be slowed down, frozen and shown over and over again. Nor is it morbid, because no one dies in this one.</p> <p>The men flying the plane jump out and parachute to safety. Last one out is a hero pilot named Jimbob (of course). From then on, another hero pilot called Chip (ditto) flies the plane by remote control from a little tiny plane that follows the big one. Like one of those little fish that swims under sharks, what are they called \u2026 oh yeah, pilot fish.</p> <p>Remaining on board are just a few crash test dummies, because they're not doing this just for a laugh; it's a serious experiment, with lessons to be learned and implications for aircraft design in the future. The plane hits the ground, not massively hard, but too hard, front wheels first. It crumples immediately. The front section breaks off and the rest carries on, thundering across the dry lake, a massive ball of momentum and dust and terror. When it comes to rest, headless, the engines are still running. Like those chickens that go on running after their heads are cut off \u2026 seeing as we seem to be in the business of searching the animal kingdom for analogies.</p> <p><em>Andale, Andale!</em> cry the Mexican firefighters, speeding to extinguish the engines with their big long hoses. Or <em>Jos\u00e9s</em> as they're called around these parts. When it's calmed down, Anne and her team can get involved, check the dummies and the black box recorder (which is red, as it happens).</p> <p>The front sections have taken the brunt of the impact, and no one ahead of the break, including our friend in 7A, would have survived. (Actually, I don't think there was even a dummy in 7A, it just happens to be the seat that's been thrown furthest). It's like some weird kind of reverse natural selection, where the more successful you are \u2013 first- and business-class passengers, even the speedy bloody boarders \u2013 the less likely you are to survive. Whereas we plebs in the back may well be OK.</p> <p>Crashes aren't always like this, of course, but we are told this is the commonest sort. It does make sense, given that planes tend to go forwards. Anyway, it's good enough for me. I'll be heading towards the back from now on, sitting right by an emergency exit, away from any fat people who may block my passage out of there. I will also be wearing my seatbelt at all times, in order to avoid \"submarining\" (disappearing under the seats in front). And when the call comes to brace I shall do just that, as I would rather have a broken foot than a broken head.</p> <p>Trouble is, the speedy boarders may well have seen this too. And by the time I get on, it will be full back there. Only 7A will be left, there will be a human elephant seal in 7B \u2026</p> <p>You know what I'm thinking after watching this? I'm thinking Cornwall. Greycation next year. They must be loving this, the folks at the Cornish tourist board. And the B&amp;B ladies. And the birds of the Thames estuary that Boris has it in for. And George Monbiot.</p>",
  "<p>So, BBC news is biased? There have been complaints that its coverage is not always impartial. But now the BBC Trust's chairman, former Tory grandee Chris Patten, has <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/oct/10/bbc-review-liberal-bias\" title=\"\">set up an inquiry to examine whether its coverage is too liberal</a>.</p> <p>We have been here before. Conservatives have agitated against the BBC for decades. Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, they raised the issue of liberal or left bias at the corporation. Norman Tebbit famously attacked Kate Adie over the coverage of the US bombing of Libya in 1986. During the Iraq war, the BBC was accused of being biased in favour of Stop the War, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2003/apr/22/iraqandthemedia.politicsandthemedia\" title=\"\">against all the evidence that they swallowed the WMD story whole</a>. Then, as now, it might be instructive for the \"independent\" review to take account of the evidence on the alleged bias of television news.</p> <p>Part of the review will cover the topics of Europe, immigration and religion. But the research evidence that we have does not suggest a liberal bias. On the contrary, it suggests a routine tendency for BBC news programmes to give more time and context to, and less interrogation of, establishment and elitist views.</p> <p>On Europe, for instance, the BBC has been found to be more negative and critical of the EU than the German media. <a href=\"http://jou.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/6/2/221\" title=\"\">On the European constitution, this finding held</a>, even when reporters were relatively more Europhile. <a href=\"http://gaz.sagepub.com/content/72/3/251.short\" title=\"\">A study of BBC online coverage of immigration</a> found that it \"invites a reading that might, most positively, be described as unease\" in relation to immigration.</p> <p>There seems to be some suggestion that the review of the BBC may also examine religion in general, and Islamophobia in particular. No shortage of material there. A variety of academic studies has examined how the BBC and other media have covered Islam, especially since September 2001. <a href=\"http://www.llc.manchester.ac.uk/research/projects/etrist/conferences/Fileuploadmax10Mb,169791,en.pdf\" title=\"\">One found that \"the framing of Islam as a security threat can be inferred from the very large numbers of news items in which Muslim political and military or paramilitary actors have been shown in postures of hostility towards aspects of&#xa0;[western] societies\".</a></p> <p>The authors contend that \"while distinctions are made between dangerous, fanatical, politically driven Islamism and Islam as a religion, these distinctions are not always made clear, so there is a persistent danger of conveying the issues in terms of an all-embracing clash of civilisations\". Not a lot of support in these studies for the contention in a <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-2212544/A-day-shame-Civil-Service.html\" title=\"\">Daily Mail leader column</a> last week that the BBC \"consistently attacks Christianity (though never Islam)\".</p> <p>There have been virtually no rigorous studies that concluded that the BBC was either \"objective\" or biased to the left. Almost every single study undertaken since the earliest, by the <a href=\"http://www.glasgowmediagroup.org/\" title=\"\">Glasgow University Media Group</a> in the 1970s and 1980s, concludes that elite perspectives dominate the news. On the one occasion that an apparently serious study found the opposite (Martin Harrison's on the 1984-5 miners' strike), it was later <a href=\"http://www.glasgowmediagroup.org/images/stories/pdf/aqtwo.pdf\" title=\"\">revealed that the research was flawed</a> (not to mention being subsidised by ITN).</p> <p><a href=\"http://mcs.sagepub.com/content/32/3/517.full.pdf\" title=\"\">An examination of the TV coverage of the current economic crisis</a> concluded that \"there was an overwhelming bias in the direction of narratives deriving from an elite perspective on what matters and what is thus newsworthy\".</p> <p>Whoever oversees the forthcoming BBC review must be allowed to undertake rigorous research. In the past, when truly independent academics have been commissioned, the results have not been what the Mail might have expected.</p> <p>Those familiar with the research will not be surprised to hear that elite sources and explanations dominate news on Europe, immigration and religion. If the BBC Trust is serious about living up to its obligations to tackle bias, it will start a process that ensures a wider range of views is accessed, explained and contextualised.</p> <p><em>David Miller is professor of sociology at&#xa0;the University of Bath and a director of&#xa0;Spinwatch</em></p>",
  "<p>Turkey's prime minister, Recep Tayipp Erdogan, has accused Russia of directly supplying munitions to the Syrian government, after Turkish jets intercepted a plane en route from Moscow to Damascus.</p> <p>Russia had earlier flatly denied that the Syrian plane, which was forced to land in Ankara, was carrying any military equipment. But Erdogan told reporters: \"These were equipment and ammunition that were being sent from a Russian agency&#xa0;\u2026 to the Syrian defence ministry,\" the Associated Press reported. \"Their examination is continuing and the necessary [action] will follow.\"</p> <p>Erdogan's comments clearly implied that he was accusing Moscow of lying.</p> <p>Earlier, in angry exchanges, Russia had accused the Turkish authorities of endangering Russian lives when the Syrian Air Airbus was intercepted by Turkish F16 fighter jets on Wednesday evening.</p> <p>Turkish media reports said cargo confiscated from the plane before it was allowed to leave Ankara included radios, antennae and equipment \"thought to be missile parts\". Syria immediately condemned the Turkish action as piracy.</p> <p>Turkey said previously that it had received an intelligence tip-off that the plane had illegal cargo on board. Erdogan warned last year that Turkey would be willing to take measures to \"stop and confiscate\" any shipment of military supplies, by air or sea, to Syria in contravention of its own unilateral embargo.</p> <p>The incident underlines sharp and growing disagreements over the crisis \u2013 the bloodiest of the Arab spring \u2013 which Syrian opposition activists say has cost 30,000 lives in the last 19 months. On a new and alarming front, Turkey and Syria have traded artillery fire several times over their border in the past week.</p> <p>Diplomats said Turkey was flexing its muscles after Russia refused to condemn Syria at the United Nations last week when mortar shells fired by the Syrian army killed five civilians in a Turkish border village.</p> <p>Birol Akg\u00fcn, of Ankara's Institute of Strategic Thinking, told Zaman newspaper: \"This is a signal to both Syria and third parties, such as Russia and Iran.\"</p> <p>Russia is Syria's closest ally and has supplied it with weapons as well as providing diplomatic and political cover in the UN security council. Turkey has called for President Bashar al-Assad to step down and has allowed limited supplies of weapons to be delivered across the border to the Syrian rebels.</p> <p>Syria protested that the Airbus passengers were in a \"very bad psychological state\". One of them, a Syrian aviation official, alleged that Turkish officials pointed guns at crew and handcuffed passengers.</p> <p>\"We had no cargo on that aeroplane,\" Vyacheslav Davidenko, spokesman for Russia's state arms export company Rosoboronexport, told Reuters. \"We always deliver our weapons in full compliance with international norms. Sending weapons on a passenger aeroplane breaks about every law there is,\" he said.</p> <p>Russian and Chinese objections mean there are no international arms sanctions in force against Syria. Moscow has balked at western pressure to cut co-operation with or pressure the Syrian regime and has made several unsuccessful attempts to deliver renovated helicopters. One shipment was sent back as it rounded the coast of Scotland in the summer.</p> <p>\"Russia is not interested in escalating the conflict in Syria,\" said Ruslan Aliyev, an analyst at the Centre for Analysis of Strategies and Technologies, a Moscow-based consultancy with links to Russia's defence community. \"Secretly delivering weapons to Syria would put at risk Russia's image and reputation and [Vladimir] Putin's personal reputation. No Russian leader would go on such a risky venture.\"</p> <p>Assad sought to calm tensions with Ankara, describing Syria and Turkey as brothers in an interview published on Thursday. He insisted Turkey had \"no reason to go to war\" over the cross-border clashes. \"We should work on this issue together,\" he told the left-leaning Turkish newspaper Aydinlik. \"In times like this, countries should correct their mistakes by talking to each other.\"</p> <p>Inside Syria, meanwhile, battles continued in Idlib province, near the Turkish border, as rebels sought to consolidate control of a strategic town on the main north-south highway. Rebels said they captured Maaret al-Numan on Wednesday. The British-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said clashes continued after rebels attacked a military convoy and nearby checkpoints. The Syrian Revolution General Commission reported 47 deaths in Idlib, Deraa, Damascus and Homs.</p>",

  "<p>Home Office ministers tried to persuade the Jordanian government to grant the terrorist suspect Abu Qatada a pardon so that he could be deported from the UK, an immigration tribunal has heard.</p> <p>The act of clemency would have cleared the way for him to be retried for two bomb attacks in Jordan without relying on evidence extracted under torture from alleged co-conspirators.</p> <p>After the then security minister, James Brokenshire, was told this was not possible, UK officials continued research into when the King of Jordan could issue a pardon. Details of the government's increasingly inventive attempts to remove Abu Qatada, 52, emerged on the second day of his appeal against deportation at the Special Immigration Appeals Commission (Siac) in London.</p> <p>Other UK requests \u2013 for the Jordanian courts to rule on the admissibility of the evidence and to give an undertaking not to bring evidence obtained through torture \u2013 were also refused, Anthony Layden, the former British ambassador to Libya who specialises in negotiating diplomatic assurances, revealed.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/law/2012/oct/10/abu-qatada-extradition\" title=\"\">Siac is hearing Abu Qatada's appeal</a> after <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jan/17/abu-qatada-deportation-blocked-european\" title=\"\">Europe's human rights judges ruled</a> that he could not be deported while there was a \"real risk that evidence obtained by torture will be used against him\".</p> <p>The government has been seeking assurances from Jordan that Abu Qatada, who a judge once described as Osama bin Laden's right-hand man in Europe, will not be tried on the basis of evidence obtained through torture.</p> <p>Layden revealed details of the talks which took place in a meeting in Jordan on 14 February. Under cross-examination by Edward Fitzgerald QC, for Abu Qatada, he said: \"I think the question of a pardon had been asked earlier and Brokenshire was asking for an answer.\"</p> <p>The pardon was being sought because the evidence used in convicting Abu Qatada in his absence was \"granted by torture\", Layden agreed, saying he had not referred to government assurances because it was a matter for the prosecutors and the courts. Asked whether torture was widespread and routine in Jordan, Layden replied: \"Matters have improved. It's still my view that torture may take place in Jordan and we have to proceed on the basis that it does.\"</p> <p>\"Political pressure\" was put on Home Office and Foreign Office lawyers to secure assurances that Abu Qatada could be deported, he said. Ministerial advisers asked UK officials to ensure that \"minimum requirements\" were met to enable his removal.</p> <p>Layden recalled a meeting in Whitehall last spring attended by Whitehall lawyers. \"There was an atmosphere of a certain amount of political pressure at the time,\" he said. The term \"minimum requirements\" had come from one of three special advisers who were present, he explained.</p> <p>Fitzgerald asked about a meeting between the home secretary, Theresa May, and the King of Jordan, at which she said the \"perception that Jordan used torture\" put about by the European court of human rights needed to be corrected.</p> <p>Layden said he had not been present but added that \"it was being put to us [that torture] was no longer representative\" of what was being done.</p> <p>Layden dismissed suggestions that Abu Qatada could, if acquitted, be subsequently arrested under a Jordanian law permitting administrative detention. But he did agree that as many as 13,000 people are believed to be in custody because they had been detained under the orders of regional governors.</p> <p>He hoped Abu Qatada would be given a trial \"sufficiently fair to discharge our responsibilities\". The hearing continues.</p>",
  "<p>Programmes made in the recent past are always disconcerting. They look almost like today's \u2026 but not quite. The acting style is almost the same \u2026 but not quite.

Harvey, played by <a href=\"http://www.heraldscotland.com/arts-ents/film/a-man-for-all-seasons.18184021\" title=\"Kenneth Cranham\">Kenneth Cranham</a>, returns to find his house is rubble, his children barely recognise him, jobs are scarce, and his wife Rita has been having a whale of a time helping the war effort in her own special way. But gradually the family Moon coheres and so, round it, does the audience. There are lovely lines (\"'Course it's boring! All honest jobs are boring!\" explains the patriarch to his newly employed offspring) and exchanges that far outnumber any clunkers. \"I don't see how you manage to shave in that broken bit of mirror,\" says Violet, the formidable nan, to Harvey. \"I've got a good memory for faces,\" he replies.</p> <p>Then there are the tiny touches that conjure up that frequently misremembered postwar world: the birthday cakes planned weeks in advance, the gathering of everyone in the house to admire a piece of steak brought to the table, the shaving mirror that, of course, stays broken \u2013 all testifying to how long things took to improve. Brownshirts recruit at the local market. The installation of a telephone in the Moon household is almost as transformative as the penicillin that cures Violet's pneumonia. Antisemitism is still rife, as Harvey realises when he begins a relationship with his Jewish landlady, an Austrian refugee. And the nation's wallpaper, as Violet points out, is uniformly terrible.</p> <p>The family \u2013 who laugh and jab and argue just like a real family \u2013 becomes a warm, living, loving thing. The story of Harvey rebuilding and bettering his life is the story of <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOYZ2dlg2CQ\" title=\"postwar Britain\">postwar Britain</a> in microcosm, the family's interests and affairs beautifully and masterfully evoking national concerns. But you don't have to consciously notice this to be moved. You'll find yourself welling up at odd moments regardless of any bigger picture.

  "<p>Everybody has been spurned, and nobody likes it. Thus, the early stages of J\u00fcrgen Klinsmann's relationship with US soccer were bound to be tense. </p> <p>When the former Germany coach <a href=\"http://www.soccertimes.com/usteams/2006/men/dec08.htm\">rejected US Soccer Federation president Sunil Gulati's overtures in 2006</a>, <a href=\"http://www.bigsoccer.com/\">BigSoccer</a>'s USMNT section filled with threads befitting the book <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Hes-Just-That-Into-Understanding/dp/141690977X\">He's Just Not That Into You</a>. Fans went through the four stages of grieving \u2013 1) denial, 2) self-doubt, 3) anger, 4) acceptance. \"Klinsi\" would change his mind. Klinsi didn't like us, but it was somehow our fault. Klinsi sucks as a coach anyway. Things just didn't work out.</p> <p>Flash forward a few years. Bob Bradley's US <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6I3HCOMYTYc\">beats Mexico in the Gold Cup final</a>, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDnYv5FgFPw\">reaches the Confederations Cup final</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MpMBEmBBsQ\">advances at the World Cup</a>. Klinsi? Who? We're so over him. Gulati extended Bradley's deal. </p> <p>But <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-wEuk85OV8\">a second consecutive Gold Cup final flop against Mexico</a> was the death knell. Suddenly, the dude who was too good for us re-entered the picture. So did hurt feelings.

Still, fans' self-doubt and anger lingered. Sometimes emotions cloud the view.</p> <p>The biggest practical question, as always, was about players and tactics. Every USMNT fans knew that Landon Donovan, the USA's all-time leading goalscorer, and Clint Dempsey, perhaps our best ever European export, were too close to 30 for comfort. A once steady stream of nasty and physically imposing defenders had narrowed to a trickle. The US had (and has) more quality central midfielders than roster spots, but even a team of 10 Genaro Gattusos has to score to win. </p> <p>Bradley knew the US player pool in North America quite well and built a 4-4-2 counterattacking machine. He favored two holding midfielders, pushed Dempsey and Donovan to the flanks and normally didn't ask them to play too much defense. The result was up-and-down games with the feel of a yo-yo: pulled in one direction for a second, then another. The US scored goals against teams big and small, but six dedicated ball-winners left us exposed to counterattacks and counter-counterattacks.</p> <p>Enter Klinsmann. Many feared he would copy his German national-team formula, a suspiciously familiar counterattacking 4-4-2. More worrisome, he had botched the job at Bayern Munich. Skeptics believe that his failure there <a href=\"http://blogs.reuters.com/soccer/2009/04/28/bayern-show-ruthless-streak-with-klinsmann-sacking/\">exposed his tactical limitations</a>, but another take is that Bayern's ego-laden locker-room, of Arjen Robben and Franck Rib\u00e9ry, would be difficult for anyone. </p> <p>On the other hand, <a href=\"http://www.fifa.com/worldcup/archive/germany2006/overview.html\">Klinsmann excelled with Germany</a>, where he found a team in transition, the iconic Michael Ballack in decline, and managed to inject some confidence. If you look beyond your anger at being spurned in 2006, you'll realize he was never the coach to make that game-changing 60th-minute substitution. But he never fielded dysfunctional starting XIs. If you look past your self-doubt, you'll realize that the US, like Germany in 2005-06, offers a promising player pool which is in a bit of a divot.</p> <p>Early on, Klinsi discarded the run-and-gun 4-4-2 in favor of a tilted 4-3-1-2, although on the field, players take up spots in a 4-4-2. However, Klinsi normally selects a third holding midfielder, either Francisco Torres or Kyle Beckerman. When the team plays defense, this player shields the back line alongside Maurice Edu and Jermaine Jones. On the other flank, either Dempsey or Donovan will have light defensive duties and will be expected to move center on offense. </p> <p>Defending with seven has made the US hard to score against. The opposition creates fewer clear chances, thanks to a clogged middle. Even in <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpsXXKLAZeU\">the 2-1 loss to Jamaica</a>, both Jamaican goals came from free-kicks. However, what about offense? </p> <p>Some cry for the old days of bursting down the flanks. We remember the youthful Dempsey dribbling fearlessly at <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2006/jun/18/worldcup2006.match2\">Italy in the 2006 World Cup</a> and Donovan's bursts against Brazil in the 2009 Confederations Cup final. <a href=\"http://www.ussoccer.com/news/mens-national-team/2011/06/us-men-fall-4-2-in-2011-gold-cup-final.aspx\">The 4-2 Gold Cup loss to Mexico in 2011</a> was a hell of a game, high on entertainment, even if we lost.</p> <p>And that is why Klinsmann's tenure with the US has been successful but easily derided: if he made the overly cautious Germans fun, he has made the fun-loving Americans boring. Defenders no longer overlap with abandon or hoof the ball 60 yards \u2013 they try to pass horizontally. In <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxemyyWlOTI\">the second game against Jamaica</a>, the US held over 70% possession in the first half, a Barcelona-esque stat. In the forthcoming games against Antigua &amp; Barbuda (away on Friday) and Guatemala (in Kansas City on Tuesday), expect more of the same: few chances. Midfield passing. Decisive free-kicks. Possession. </p> <p>It's not the stuff dreams are made of \u2013 aside from <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ek0ppCL5y7M\">the Mexico away win</a>&#xa0;\u2013 but the US remains on course to qualify for Brazil 2014.</p> <p>Of course, you have the right to criticize <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2012/oct/09/jozy-altidore-usmnt-roster-dropped-usa\">Klinsmann's more curious roster picks</a> and occasional substitution gaffes. Just try to do so with a level head. Remember that <a href=\"http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2012/writers/grant_wahl/10/08/jozy-altidore-usa-world-cup/index.html\">Jozy Altidore has handled his recent selection snub better than you</a>. Klinsmann led us along in 2006, but this time he's really serious about coaching the USMNT. He's bound to start treating us right. I just know it.</p> <p><em>Elliott Turner blogs about soccer at <a href=\"http://www.futfanatico.com/\">Futfanatico.com</a><br></em></p>",
  "<p><strong>Title:</strong> Delirious</p> <p><strong>Date:</strong> 1983</p> <p><strong>The set-up:</strong> Eddie Murphy was standup comedy's first true megastar. Fearless, good-looking, a gifted mimic, leather-clad and toweringly self-confident, propelled by TV success on Saturday Night Live to Hollywood success in 48 Hours, he made this concert film in 1983 just after his hero, Richard Pryor, had proved that this was something comedians could do now. It was another giant hit. It remains arguably the most famous standup comedy performance of all time. When Murphy filmed it he was 22. No one since with a moustache has been so cool.</p> <p>You do have to make a few decisions about watching Murphy's standup now, though. There's homophobic material in here, <a href=\"http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1916&amp;dat=19960510&amp;id=gTBJAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=rgYNAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1633,1452476\" title=\"\">which he has since apologised about</a>. There's also a fairly old-fashioned attitude to women, and a delight in himself that maybe, under the circumstances, is easier to indulge. \"I fuck with everybody,\" Murphy says. \"I don't give a fuck. I don't mean anything by it.\"</p> <p>For what it's worth, I believe him. Unlike Pryor, Murphy was never much of a social commentator. What he is above all, and has always been, is a virtuoso of the voice. At best, the words are half the point. He does impressions. And what's special, apart from his electric attitude, is just how very, very good they are.</p> <p><strong>Funny, how?</strong> Ask Mr T to record the <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STtOWGWEIkc\" title=\"\">lines that Murphy delivers in his voice</a>, play each version one after the other, and I bet my fee for this article that you can't choose the real one consistently. It's a bet I feel safe in making, because I don't think Mr T is likely to cooperate by reciting Murphy's gay fantasy about him. (Indeed in his next standup film, Raw, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KOBGuM9swtE#t=7m30s\" title=\"\">Murphy imagines a vendetta developing</a>.) Still more remarkable \u2013 indeed astonishing \u2013 is the impression of <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQXddCgDxjk\" title=\"\">Michael Jackson singing</a>. <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bojnqBFadz4\" title=\"\">Or Elvis</a>. <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hLVmw81qDSA\" title=\"\">Or James Brown</a>.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/hLVmw81qDSA?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"369\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/hLVmw81qDSA\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>Like Pryor \u2013 or, for that matter, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/stage/2012/jul/19/comedy-gold-bill-cosby-himself\" title=\"\">Bill Cosby</a> \u2013 Murphy manages to use his sheer performing talent to make extended tales about his family into something that thousands of people pay to watch. His stepfather, Vernon, in particular, can't have been grateful to see his drunken antics etched into posterity. The many imitations of children are very sharp, which perhaps is no surprise considering how recently the imitator had been one.</p> <p>Murphy was a more versatile and successful actor that Pryor, but I think he was a worse comedian. The emphasis on setting himself up for the next impression means the show is actually quite light on jokes. And some of his observations \u2013 children's fear of kissing ugly relatives, for instance, or of dropping ice cream \u2013 have since become gag standards, if they weren't then. By sheer force of popularity, however, this show changed comedy. And Murphy has a talent you could watch for days. From his predecessors, he took inspiration. To his successors, he passed on power.</p> <p><strong>Comic cousins:</strong> Red Foxx, George Carlin, Robin Williams, Richard Pryor, Chris Rock.</p> <p><strong>Steal this:</strong> (on Captain Kirk) \"I ain't no racist, but you've got to be a horny motherfucker to fuck a green bitch.\"</p>",
  "<p>After <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/may/23/on-the-road-review\" title=\"\">its premiere at Cannes</a> earlier this year, Walter Salles's On the Road \u2013 based on the 1957 novel by Jack Kerouac \u2013 has now arrived for its UK release in a re-edited form, trimmed by 15 minutes to just over two hours. The dissatisfactions of this overripe and overblown road movie remain exactly the same. The film is stiflingly reverent towards its source material, and indeed towards itself. It's good-looking and handsomely produced, but directionless and self-adoring, richly furnished but at the same time weirdly empty, bathed in an elegiac sunset glow of male adoration.</p> <p>What seemed rhapsodic and euphoric on the page here looks smug, self-regarding and intensely self-conscious. When the actors start mouthing ersatz-passionate dialogue about poetry and novels, the movie starts to flatline, and worse still, when they start on about how incredibly life-affirming they all are, it is as dead as a haddock on a slab. The men in the film look hopelessly shallow. The women become, by contrast, sharper and more interesting in their dissent and discontent, but in a way that unbalances and destabilises the drama. It's comparable to Salles's other road movie, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/101700/motorcycle.diaries\" title=\"\">The Motorcycle Diaries</a> (2004), about the early adventures of Che Guevara and his buddy Alberto Granado, but there the travellers were learning to think and care about people other than themselves. This isn't the case with the heroes of On the Road, who have dozens of madly contrived parties, in which they heroically swig from bottles, smoke joints, have sex and become narcissistic and boring in a&#xa0;way that isn't intentional.</p> <p>The road trip back and forth across the US is part of the literary education of budding writer Sal Paradise, played by Sam Riley. In the late 1940s, Sal's father has just died; he hangs out with the gabbling Ginsberg-figure Carlo Marx (Tom Sturridge) in various hipster dives, but is himself blocked. Then everything is turned around by meeting a beautiful man, Dean Moriarty (Garrett Hedlund), based of course on the Beat icon Neal Cassady. He's a wild free spirit, a wanderer taking odd jobs and turning tricks. Dean is gloriously unfettered by the boring bonds of hearth and home; he is a hobo of the mind and spirit, just taking off when and where he pleases, squeezing life dry. His&#xa0;companion is the gorgeous 16-year-old Marylou, played by Kristen Stewart, but he seems to have other quasi-conjugal ties around the country about whom he isn't too worried. Inspired by this freewheeling alpha-male, Sal himself hits the road, sometimes with Dean, sometimes without, scribbling notes for a book.</p> <p>Sal has a sort of homoerotic bond with Dean, which is displaced into their mutual infatuation with Marylou,&#xa0;but there is never any sense that either man genuinely cares for Marylou, or is interested in her: there are many, many scenes in which the guys greet each other with fond hugs, fonder than the embraces they give the women, but even these emotional connections are subordinate to the ones&#xa0;they&#xa0;have&#xa0;with&#xa0;themselves.</p> <p>Other friends and acquaintances join them on the road, and we become aware that while the guys are heading for the hills, they have in almost every case left a woman behind, fuming. Camille (Kirsten Dunst) finally throws Dean out on his ear; Galatea (Elisabeth Moss) rages at her errant husband \u2013 and the women's anger, though shrill and futile, has a kind of real life that the complacent male voyagers do not. Marylou herself is endlessly tolerant, endlessly bland. What has she sacrificed or gained in her emotional and erotic adventures with the two heroes? It's a mystery. Viggo Mortensen and Amy Adams have eccentric cameos as Old Bull Lee (based on William Burroughs) and Jane, a couple who give houseroom to the travellers.</p> <p>On the Road was an explosion of literary energy, an intensely American grabbing of possibilities, but the movie insists too much on its elegiac past tense. For me, the film comes fully alive only in the break between Sal and Dean, a break that shows something has been at stake after all. In literature, as in life, there are winners and losers. The writer may have been subordinate to the glamorous man of action, but has been all along a kind of parasite. Poor Dean is just raw material for fiction, destined to be left behind as Sal becomes a New York big-shot, but even here, Sam Riley's Sal does not register any sense of sadness or betrayal or what Greene called the splinter of ice in one's heart that a writer needs \u2013 merely a vague regret. Well, that arguably does justice to the ruthlessness and reserve a writer needs. The journey is supposed to count more than the destination. Both feel like a disappointment here.</p>",

  "<p>Marie Stopes, the sexual health charity, predicts women will travel to Belfast from the Republic to have terminations when it opens the first private clinic to offer abortions on the island of Ireland.</p> <p>Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK where the Abortion Act 1967 does not apply, owing to opposition from the churches and almost all parties at the Stormont assembly, and abortion is legal only in exceptional circumstances. Like their counterparts in the Republic, where abortions are illegal, Northern Irish women travel to other parts of Britain for terminations.</p> <p>The centre's programme director, Dawn Purvis, said: \"We believe this is great news for the people of Northern Ireland because we will be able to meet their family planning and sexual health needs in a way that has not been seen here before. We have a new, purpose-built, centrally located specialist centre. Our team are highly trained and dedicated healthcare professionals. And our services will be delivered in a confidential, sensitive and non-judgmental way.\"</p> <p>Purvis is a former leader of the Progressive Unionist party.</p> <p>Abortions will only be offered in the first nine weeks of pregnancy at a cost of \u00a3450. The clinic, which opens next Thursday, also provides sexual and reproductive services including short- and long-term contraceptive options, emergency contraception and HIV testing.</p> <p>Dr Paula Franklin, medical director with Marie Stopes, said the abortions, which involve taking tablets, would be carried out only after two doctors agreed women met set criteria.</p> <p>\"In cases where we feel the woman's case meets medical requirements, we will carry out medical abortions. That's where two doctors independently review the woman's history and current physical and mental health,\" she said.</p> <p>Sin\u00e9ad Ahern, a spokeswoman for Choice Ireland, a pro-choice organisation in the Republic, said it would reduce the \"psychological and financial burden\" on women south of the border seeking a termination.</p> <p>Anti-abortion campaigners in Northern Ireland say they will campaign to close down the clinic offering abortion services. Bernie Smith from the organisation Precious Life said: \"I am absolutely outraged. An organisation which is making profits from the death of unborn children is not welcome in Northern Ireland. There will be an outcry from the people, from government and from the churches.\"</p> <p>A group of Irish nationals who had abortions abroad because their babies would not survive outside the womb also welcomed the opening of the clinic in Belfast.</p> <p>But Ruth Bowie, of the Terminations for Medical Reasons campaign group, said a number of women both sides of the border would still be forced to cross the Irish Sea to have a termination. Fatal foetal abnormalities are only picked up within 12 to 20 weeks of pregnancy \u2013 long after the nine-week limit at the Marie Stopes clinic in Belfast.</p> <p>\"This development in Belfast will be of no help to the women north and south who are facing the trauma and upset of fatal foetal abnormalities,\" Bowie said. \"Women and men in this situation continue to be forced to travel away from family, friends and their homes at the worst time of their lives.</p> <p>\"We continue to campaign for a change in this outdated law and will not stop until women and men who make this heartbreaking decision are afforded to the dignity to be cared for in their own country.\"</p>",
  "<p>Cities present a sustainability conundrum: though they are the most efficient way to provide infrastructure and services for large populations, they are, in absolute terms, incredibly inefficient.</p> <p>Cities cover just 2% of the Earth's surface yet consume about 75% of the world's resources, and given that more of the world's population now live in cities than in rural areas, it's clear they are key to tackling climate change and reducing resource use.</p> <p>Urban administrators face huge challenges to make cities more sustainable. From traffic jams and inefficient buildings to social inequality and housing, the problems are complex and hard to tackle \u2014 but not insurmountable.</p> <p>Some cities are forging ahead with the use of innovative urban planning, technological and governance models, showing that with the right focus and resources, cities can become \"smart\" or more sustainable.</p> <p>According to the latest Siemens' <a href=\"http://www.siemens.com/press/en/events/2011/corporate/2011-02-asia.php\" title=\"\">Green City Index for Asia</a>, Singapore is the best-performing city in the region when measured against a range of sustainability criteria.</p> <p>\"Singapore is at the leading edge of sustainability,\" says Nicholas You, chairman of the World Urban Campaign Steering Committee at <a href=\"http://www.unhabitat.org/categories.asp?catid=9\" title=\"\">UN-Habitat</a>. \"It's an island state with limited resources so it had no choice but to go green if it wanted to survive economically.\"</p> <p>Singapore's experiences have important lessons for other urban centres. Take its water treatment. In 1963, water functionality was shared between multiple ministries and agencies, which made it difficult to formulate a coordinated, long-term strategy.</p> <p>With a rising population and finite freshwater resources, action was needed, so ministers set up a national water agency, PUB, which became the sole body responsible for the collection, production, distribution and reclamation of water in the city.</p> <p>Today, its water operation has been transformed. Two thirds of Singapore's land surface is now a water catchment area with water stored in 17 reservoirs, including the Marina Basin, right in the heart of the city.</p> <p>Called NEWater, wastewater is collected and treated to produce water that's good enough to drink. This meets 30% of the city's water needs, a target that will be increased to 50% of future needs by 2060.</p> <p>Earlier this year, Siemens was contracted to identify CO2 reduction opportunities in transport, residential and non-industrial buildings, and IT/communications in the Tampines district.</p> <p>As part of the city's plan to reduce CO2 emissions by 30% by 2030, Siemens will report back in 2013 with implementation costs, a plan to implement the changes and the design of pilots to trail three technological solutions.</p> <p>\"This will be a good test-bed for new technologies to prove what we can do,\" says Dr Roland Busch, Siemens' CEO of infrastructure and cities sector. \"It's a way to demonstrate in the highly competitive environment that is Singapore, that we can bring energy efficiency to the next level in addressing all the basic needs of cities.\"</p> <p>EDF and Veolia recently signed an agreement with Singapore's Housing Development Board (HDB), the city-state's largest developer, to develop software that will help it develop sustainable, urban planning solutions in HDB towns.</p> <p>ForCity will simulate the built environment of a city and its impact on resources, the environment, people and intervention costs to help the HDB make its towns function more efficiently and become more pleasant to live in. The tool will be trialed in the Jurong East district of Singapore.</p> <p>Transport is another sector that has seen investment recently. On an island of 4.8 million people with limited space, moving people around as efficiently as possible is key to its economic viability. A decade ago, city administrators warned that congestion could cost Singapore's economy $2-3bn a year if transport infrastructure was not improved.</p> <p>Then, there were two separate transport-charging systems in the city: road tolls and public transport, including the metro and buses. But since 2009, after a series of smart card innovations, people have been able to use e-Symphony, an IBM-designed payment card that can be used to pay for road tolls, bus travel, taxis, the metro, and even shopping.</p> <p>The card can process 20 million fare transactions a day and collects extensive traffic data, allowing city administrators to constantly tweak routes to ensure the most efficient journeys and minimise congestion.</p> <p>All these measures combine to make Singapore a smarter city. \"What we have done is to research and try to distill the principles for Singapore's success in sustainable urban development \u2013 we call it a liveability framework,\" says Khoo Teng Chye, executive director at the Centre for Liveable Cities based in Singapore.</p> <p>\"Quality of life, environmental sustainability and competitive economics. These are the components that make cities liveable.\"</p> <p>As the competition for resources increases and cities expand to accommodate rising populations, even those without the geographic constraints of Singapore will have to embrace smart city principles. If they don't, they will lose out financially, unable to attract businesses and talent from cities that do. The planet simply can't sustain current levels of resource use and environmental degradation. It's not a choice; cities <em>have</em> to change.</p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by </strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/guardian-professional\" title=\"Guardian Professional\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

  "<p>Home Office ministers sought a pardon for Jordanian terror suspect Abu Qatada in a bid to deport him from the UK, a tribunal has heard.</p> <p>James Brokenshire, the then security minister, asked Jordanian ministers in February if the radical cleric, once described by a judge as Osama bin Laden's right-hand man in Europe, could be pardoned if returned.</p> <p>Even when Brokenshire was told this was not possible, the government had a \"plan B\" to find out when the Jordanian king could issue such a pardon, the special immigration appeals commission (Siac) in central London heard.</p> <p>Anthony Layden, the former British ambassador to Libya who specialises in negotiating diplomatic assurances, revealed details of the talks which took place at a meeting in Jordan on 14 February.</p> <p>Under cross-examination by Edward Fitzgerald QC, for Abu Qatada, Layden agreed that the possibility of a pardon for the cleric was explored.</p> <p>\"I think the question of a pardon had been asked earlier and Mr Brokenshire was asking for an answer,\" Layden said.</p> <p>The pardon was being sought because the evidence against Abu Qatada was \"granted by torture\", Layden agreed.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/law/2012/oct/10/abu-qatada-extradition?INTCMP=ILCNETTXT3487\" title=\"\">Siac is hearing Abu Qatada's appeal </a>against deportation after Europe's human rights judges ruled the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jan/17/abu-qatada-deportation-blocked-european?INTCMP=ILCNETTXT3487\" title=\"\">51-year-old could not be deported </a>while there was a \"real risk that evidence obtained by torture will be used against him\".</p> <p>Layden also said simple assurances from the Jordanian government that evidence gained by torture would not be used were never going to be enough to deport him as it was a matter for the prosecutors and the courts, not the government.</p> <p>The UK government also asked Jordanian prosecutors if they would give \"an undertaking in advance that they would not rely on the statements\" gained through torture, but the Jordanians refused, Layden agreed.</p> <p>An attempt to get Jordan's state security court to rule on the admissibility of the statements before Qatada was deported had also been rejected, he added.</p> <p>The tribunal continues.</p>",
  "<p>Gloucester is the only rugby club in England that has a chance of staging a match in the 2015 World Cup. Kingsholm is one of 17 grounds on a shorter longlist announced this week by the tournament organisers, who will make use of 12.</p> <p>Ten of the stadia have staged rugby matches: Twickenham, Wembley, the Millennium Stadium, Old Trafford, Stadium MK, Coventry Stadium (the grounds will not bear the names of sponsors during the World Cup), Leicester City Stadium, Ashton Gate, Villa Park and Kingsholm. Rugby league internationals were staged at Newcastle United's St James' Park more than a century ago.</p> <p>There is no place for Welford Road, the traditional rugby ground with the biggest capacity in the Premiership. If the World Cup bandwagon rolls into Leicester, it will head for the city's football ground over the road which boasts not just an extra 33 per cent capacity but, according to the audit carried out on all the potential grounds, has better facilities for players, advertisers and the media.</p> <p>Martyn Thomas, the former chairman of the Rugby Football Union who would have been a driving force in the organisation of the World Cup, disagreed with the omission of Welford Road, saying that there was a moral obligation to use more rugby stadia.</p> <p>He has a point, but why is the south-west unrepresented? Exeter could have hosted a match between Fiji and Namibia as Rotorua did in New Zealand last year \u2013 while Cardiff will play host to a number of matches, including a quarter-final, if the Welsh Rugby Union gets its way?</p> <p>England's successful bid for 2015 was for a one-nation tournament. The Rugby Football Union surely has a moral obligation to every region in England, but not to Wales. The Millennium Stadium holds 74,000 spectators and the aim in 2015 is to sell 2.9m tickets, so that not only is the \u00a380m the RFU has guaranteed to the International Rugby Board met, but the hosts will generate their own seven-figure profit.</p> <p>\"You would like to think that rugby would reward those who invest in rugby and it has not done that in this case,\" said Simon Cohen, the Leicester chief executive. \"The decision says, unfortunately, that money is the driving force now.\"</p> <p>Money is the driving force now: indeed. It is why sympathy for Leicester has to be muted, even though, three years out from the World Cup, there should have been time to address problems raised in the audit. At least the Tigers can now appreciate how Championship clubs who aspire to the Premiership feel: the minimum standards criteria for entry into the top flight are demanding, placing an emphasis on facilities and capacity, which is exactly what the World Cup organisers are doing.</p> <p>The Premiership clubs are currently trying to reform the way the Heineken Cup is organised. Their representative on the board of the tournament's organisers, European Rugby Cup Ltd, is Peter Wheeler, a Leicester director. He was at the stakeholders' meeting in Rome this week.</p> <p>Money is the means by which Premiership Rugby is hoping to bring about the change it wants: to boost the commercial pot, as it says it has done through its television deal with BT Vision, which includes a cross-border element, and everyone will be better off; never mind the question of whether there is a moral obligation in a six-nation tournament to ensure that every country is represented, just offer them a few quid in compensation.</p> <p>The Tigers have been one of the clubs in recent years who have protested that the salary cap Premiership Rugby operates is holding back clubs in Europe. \"For a club like Leicester, the cap presents us with a major challenge which could, potentially, seriously inhibit our future playing success and our vision to make Tigers the best club in world rugby,\" said Peter Tom, the club's chairman, at the end of 2020.</p> <p>Earlier that year, Wheeler had lamented that the cap was more trouble than it was worth.\" The benefits of it are not definable apart from an evenly based league in which one team can beat any other on a given day,\" he said. Leicester, the best supported club in the Premiership, were not being allowed to properly exploit their commercial advantage.</p> <p>So Leicester should appreciate that money is the driving force behind the 2015 World Cup: none is going to be wasted on getting grounds ready, although the hiring of football stadia is unlikely to be cheap. The Tigers themselves took their 2006 Heineken Cup quarter-final against Bath from Welford Road to Leicester City's ground, virtually doubling the attendance from the 16,815 capacity which then applied at their stadium to 32,500.</p> <p>Harlequins go big game hunting at Twickenham every year, Saracens hire Wembley and a London double-header is staged at Twickenham at the start of every season. Northampton took their Heineken Cup group match last season to Milton Keynes. Like the 2015 World Cup organisers, the clubs' motive is to broaden the spectator base and give the paying punters an experience beyond the 80 minutes of rugby.</p> <p>Obligations of clubs and unions are frequently to themselves; the greater good becomes secondary in the dash for cash. Those who pay to watch rugby regularly will lament the lack of familiar grounds in 2015, but they are not the ones being targeted by the tournament organisers, whose focus is on those who rarely, if ever, pay to watch the sport and, of course, the television audience.</p> <p>When the World Cup was last staged in the British Isles back in 1999, Wales were the hosts but provided only three of the 18 grounds used in the tournament: the Millennium Stadium, the Racecourse Ground in Wrexham and Llanelli's Stradey Park. Ashton Gate was one of the three clubs grounds in England to stage matches, along with Welford Road and the then McAlpine Stadium in Huddersfield.</p> <p>Welford Road and Kingsholm hosted matches in the 1991 World Cup, along with Otley, but the tournament is a different beast now. The event in New Zealand last year was played out while a debate raged off the field about how much money the major unions received, some of them arguing that they lost revenue in a World Cup and would not be able to take part in 2015.</p> <p>Leicester, more than any other club, should understand where the 2015 organisers are coming from, acting just as Premiership Rugby would. And it should not be forgotten that all the money the IRB makes from the World Cup is reinvested in the game.</p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/signup/thebreakdown\" title=\"\"><strong><em>This is an extract from the Breakdown, our free weekly take on the world of rugby.

  "<h2>Longman &amp; Eagle, Chicago, Ilinois</h2> <p>In Chicago's Logan Square \u2013 a beautiful, historic neighbourhood with wide boulevards and a crop of new businesses \u2013 this art-centric, six-room inn sits above the cult restaurant of the same name. Everything from the slatted wood ceiling to much of the furniture was designed and built by the owners (Robert McAdams has a woodworking company called Mode Carpentry). Each of the rooms is decorated with local art, including a wall of screen-printed wallpaper by a local design collective. Other creative touches include handmade wooden drink coins (for use at the bar downstairs, known for its killer whiskey selection), mix tapes, custom wooden speakers, chambray sheets made by the Chicago company Unison, and hanging terrariums over the bathroom sinks. Indulge in the minibar filled with unusual snacks like Gunslinger beef jerky, or head downstairs in the morning for the gutsy eggs and sausage breakfast, which comes with a can of PBR beer. <br>\u2022 <em>2657 North Kedzie Ave, +1 773 276 7110, </em><a href=\"http://www.longmanandeagle.com/\" title=\"\"><em>longmanandeagle.com</em></a><em>, rooms from $85 </em></p> <h2>Wandawega, Elkhorn, Wisconsin</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397561905\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Late_offers/pictures/2012/10/11/1349942993175/Wandawega-wisconsin-005.jpg\" alt=\"Wandawega, wisconsin\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Wandawega, wisconsin</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Owned by ad execs David Hernandez and Tereasa Surratt, this 25-acre Wisconsin retreat, an hour and a half from Chicago sticks close to its roots as a Latvian summer camp, offering canoeing, archery, hiking, fishing, shuffleboard \u2026 you name it.

  "<p>I went to bed last night in a different world. David Cameron's conference speech had transformed the United Kingdom into a new country, a more ambitious country, a Torier country. For the first time, I slept in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/oct/10/david-cameron-leader-aspiration-nation\" title=\"\">Aspiration Nation</a>. And it was bloody rubbish. Cameron drivelled out the words \"aspiration\" and \"aspirational\" nine times yesterday. He was so pleased with \"aspiration nation\", he said it twice.</p> <p>What a desperately empty word to fix on. A word that means, if we're being literal, a puff of air. Here's the thing about aspiration: as a political ethos, it's nothing but a Ponzi scheme. Everyone deposits their hopes and dreams to do better, fervently trusting that the sharp fellow in the nice suit will turn this portion of our faith into a better future.</p> <p>A few will get their aspiration back with interest, and the sharp fellow in the nice suit can claim this as proof that his extra-special investment scheme works. According to the speech, he's found a way to \u2013 wait for it \u2013 <em>spread privilege</em>. That is, he's claiming to be able to give everyone equal shares in a condition that is defined by inequality. A privilege is something that other people don't have. If you share it out, it ceases to be privilege. Like any dodgy banker, Cameron is promising the impossible.</p> <p>Most of the people who put their savings in with Aspiration Nation will gain nothing; many will come out worse. That's not a regrettable side effect of the aspiration economy, by the way: it's a necessary part of its function, because aspiration is relative. For some to do better, others must fail. For academies to be centres of excellence, the rest of the education system must miss out on money and resources. And for one person to rise, others must stay in the same place \u2013 or fall lower.</p> <p>It wouldn't have to be like this if the aspirations Cameron was encouraging were actually, well, aspirational. Who does he praise in his speech? \"The doers. The risk takers. The young people who dream of their first pay cheque, their first car, their first home \u2013 and are ready and willing to work hard to get those things.\" That's the big Tory dream? A job, a car and a house? Clearly, house prices and unemployment in this crocked economy mean those things are a tantalising mirage beyond the reach of many of us; but if they're the dream, then I'd suggest there's something seriously wrong with the reality.</p> <p>What about aspiring to an education, an accessible public transport system and a social care system that means children <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/oct/05/immigration-children\" title=\"\">don't starve to death</a> in the UK? Is that \"aspirational\", or does aspiration only cover being a money-earning, money-spending economic unit, sucking cash in at one end and parping it out the other like a financial lugworm? Am I allowed to aspire to decent employment benefits, or do true aspirants sell themselves out for a bundle of shares?</p> <p>If we're supposed to aspire to a first pay cheque, it does make me wonder where workfare \u2013 sorry, \"the Work Programme\" that Cameron boasts about in the speech \u2013 fits in, given that it's a means of getting young people to do menial jobs for nothing under the guise of giving them \"training\". (I'm a trained checkout operator. It took three days and because this was in the wild big government days of 1997, the company I was working for paid me to train. Crazy.)</p> <p>When you buy into the aspiration economy, you buy into the idea that you can make your own luck by just wishing hard enough. And then, when the house and the car and the pay cheque don't show up, you'll be too busy blaming yourself (\"If only I'd been more aspirational!\") to remember that we're in the middle of a recession contrived by the same sharp fellow in the nice suit huffing and puffing on stage.</p>",

This makes it difficult for coastal countries to ascertain whether vessels have histories of IUU fishing and whether they are managed by legitimate operators. For example, Kummyeong 2 (pictured), documented by EJF as fishing illegally in Sierra Leone in December 2011, was identified three months later in Guinea operating under a new identity. EJF travelled to Guinea in March 2012 where they identified Kummyeong 2 anchored at sea, one mile from the port of Conakry. The vessel had erased its name and painted a new name, Conosu, on its hull. Sierra Leone now considers it a fugitive, and efforts are ongoing to make sure it returns to face a fine for its illegal activities. EJF is campaigning for the vessel to be banned from exporting its catches to the EU</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: EJF</span> </figcaption> </figure>",
  "<p>If the conference season has revealed anything, it is that all three leaders have identified the same portion of the electorate that will bring them victory in 2015. Call them suspicious strivers, alarm clock Britons, blue collar Tories or the squeezed middle, they are the only people to whom Britain's leaders seem to want to talk.</p> <p>Nick Clegg spoke to the \"millions of people up and down the country, who, no matter how heroic or mundane their battles, keep going, keep trying, keep working, whatever life throws at them\".</p> <p>Or take Ed Miliband: \"I want to talk to all of the people of this country who always thought of themselves as comfortably off, but who now find themselves struggling to make ends meet. They think the system just doesn't work for them. I want to talk to them and all the millions of people across our country who don't think they get a fair crack of the whip.\"</p> <p>Or George Osborne: \"Let's hold in mind who we do it for. That cornershop owner, that teacher, that commuter, that pensioner and that entrepreneur. They strive for a better life. We strive to help them.\"</p> <p>Or Cameron: \"We are the party of the want to be better off, those who strive to make a better life for themselves, and we should never be ashamed of saying so.\"</p> <p>Now it could be argued these hardworking families are just marketing guff, just a collation of conference banalities to be filed away alongside Mondeo Man.</p> <p>But Lord Ashcroft, who does more intelligent polling than any other politician in the UK, believes they are an identifiable group, or groups. At the beginning of this week, he landed them into two categories \u2013 the entitlement-anxious and suspicious strivers. Both groups feel cheated by the near decade-long squeeze on their living standards.</p> <p>The first group, representing just over a quarter of the electorate, are mainly female, not highly educated, feel insecure and are pessimistic. They think people who do not work seem to have an easier time than they do; they sometimes ask themselves why they bother. They fear for their children's prospects, and are the segment most likely to blame immigration for stagnant wages and lack of jobs. They say Labour is the best party in all policy areas except \"reforming welfare to stop scroungers and cut benefit dependency\", an issue on which they put the Conservatives 10 points ahead \u2013 compared with a 30-point lead for Labour among the sample as a whole.</p> <p>They say they would prefer Miliband to Cameron as prime minister and want a PM that listens. They account for a third of Labour's poll share, but just over a tenth of the Tories.</p> <p>The second group, the suspicious strivers, are smaller, representing only 15% of the population. They are broadly the successors to the C2 blue-collar workers that Margaret Thatcher won from Labour in the 1980s, and seem to be slipping away.</p> <p>But these voters, disproportionately male, independent and rugged, are not sure that their efforts will bring them the rewards they should. They suspect that hard work counts for less than connections when it comes to getting on in life. They think people expect too much of the state: they are open to realistic messages that Britain is in a world struggle.</p> <p>They also believe they pay the most into the system for the least return, and are particularly concerned that their children will not find good jobs or be able to buy a house even if they go to university.</p> <p>At the last general election, the Tories won 29% of these voters, compared with 19% who voted Labour. Now, 25% say they will vote for Labour, with 20% intending to vote Conservative again.</p> <p>Each party has its own way of attracting the suspicious strivers. Clegg points to lifting groups out of tax by raising personal tax allowances. He promises the burden of deficit reduction \u2013 a precondition for recovery \u2013 will start at the top, ideally with a wealth tax. He also insists his party has grown up, and is now a party explicitly of the centre with Liam Fox to his right and Ed Balls to the left.</p> <p>Miliband, by contrast, thinks he can make an appeal by saying he understands the impact of immigration on wages and jobs, and by promising responsibility at the top and the bottom. He says the squeezed middle are right to say society does not work for them due to the \"cosy cartels and powerful interests that the government has not cut down to size\".</p> <p>Cameron's reworked cabinet has spent much of the week speaking exclusively to these strivers on issues such as burglary, immigration and small business.</p> <p>But in his aspiration nation speech, Cameron tried to widen the appeal, incidentally focusing on the three areas on which the coalition mostly agree: the economy, education and welfare. The aim was less to appeal to a single demographic, but to the values of aspiration that this demographic cherishes.</p> <p>He describes this not as the centre ground, but the common ground, the place to where the compassionate \"one nation\" truly rallies. The common ground is to the right on welfare and the deficit, displays a generosity of spirit on social issues but is tough on crony capitalism.</p> <p>The Tories still believe, despite the incompetence and the economy, they are closer to the beating heart of the strivers. Their focus group people sometimes hold up cards asking the public what image most represents Labour. Not along ago, the answer was a fat man sitting on a sofa at home watching TV \u2013 the classic welfare scrounger. It may be cruel, and unfair, but it shows Miliband still has some striving to do.</p>",
