  "<p>It was while his team-mates on Eritrea's Olympic team were out watching the men's marathon in the Sunday sunshine that <a href=\"http://www.london2012.com/athlete/ghebresilasie-weynay-1061666/\" title=\"\">Weynay Ghebresilasie</a> finally decided to take the decision that has changed his life forever.</p> <p>Without a goodbye, the 18-year-old walked out of his quarters at the Olympic village, threw away the sim card that had been given to him by the team's minders and embarked on the process of claiming asylum in the UK \u2013 turning his back on a life as a conscript in the army of one of the world's most reclusive and repressive&#xa0;regimes.</p> <p>\"As recently as last month, when I competed in Spain, I had managed to retain some optimism that the conditions back home would get better, but they seem to be getting worse and worse instead,\" Ghebresilasie told the Guardian. The middle-distance runner carried his nation's flag during the Olympic opening ceremony at the head of <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/olympics/2012/countries/eritrea/athletes?sports=&amp;gender=&amp;filter=Filter&amp;isOneToWatch=0&amp;isMedallist=0\" title=\"\">a team 12 Eritrean athletes</a>.</p> <p>While there have been reports that as many as a dozen athletes from various countries have gone \"missing\" rather than choose to return to their home country, Ghebresilasie is the first to go public on why he has chosen to claim asylum.</p> <p>Visas permitting Olympic athletes to be in the UK legally run out in November but Ghebresilasie said that he has already spoken to immigration officials at the UK Border Agency's asylum screening unit in &#xa0;Croydon.</p> <p>Three other Eritrean athletes including Rehaset Mehari, the team's only female athlete, have also claimed asylum but were not willing to come forward to speak due to fears of retribution against their families, according to the Eritrean Youth Solidarity for Change, a diaspora-based opposition group which is now providing support to Ghebresilasie.</p> <p>\"There are reasons to be concerned about our families because the regime is unpredictable and is likely to treat my actions as a betrayal,\" the 3000m steeplechase runner said.</p> <p>\"If someone is being accused of illegally leaving the country it's not unusual for a fine to be imposed on their family, or for their next of kin to be detained.\"</p> <p>Despite struggling with extreme poverty and with a population of little more than 5 million people, Eritrea maintains one of the largest armies in Africa, made up of soldiers forced indefinitely into national service. A 2009 investigation by Human Rights Watch and the United Nations high commissioner for refugees (UNHCR) said these conscripts are subjected to torture and illegal forced labour.</p> <p>\"Once you are forced into national service there is no way of getting out of what is a very tough life, other than if you lose a limb or are declared medically unfit,\" said Ghebresilasie, who has three brothers in the Eritrean army and lost a fourth in the 1998-2000 war with Ethiopia that claimed tens of thousands of lives.</p> <p>Clad in a red and black tracksuit and cradling a bottle of water, he appeared melancholy as he chatted about his Olympic experience, <a href=\"http://london2012.bbc.co.uk/athletics/event/men-3km-steeplechase/phase=atm033900/index.html\" title=\"\">in which he finished 10th in his heat</a>.</p> <p>\"It had been a dream come true to compete here and I was hoping to perform well, perhaps even come close to a medal, but due to mismanagement and politics I could not achieve what I wanted.\" he&#xa0;said</p> <p>\"The truth is that we are not treated as athletes. For example, there were times when we went to other countries to compete and I was denied medical treatment by the Eritrean officials in charge, some of them high ranking-army officers.\"</p> <p>In contrast, he had nothing but positive comments to make about Britain's stewardship of the Olympics, mentioning the \"fantastic hospitality\" and singling out the volunteers for special praise.</p> <p>Asked if he could one day envisage himself competing for Britain, should the right circumstances evolve, he replied: \"I still very much love my country and it's the harsh conditions and lack of basic human rights which has compelled me to seek asylum.\"</p> <p>\"Who knows what the future holds but for now I'm taking things one day at a time and I hope to continue to pursue my first love which is athletics.\"</p> <p>Ghebresilasie is not the first Eritrean athlete to use the opportunity afforded by sport to seek a new life elsewhere. The entire national football team fled during a 2009 competition in Kenya, leaving only a coach and one other official to make the journey home.</p> <p>But many other Eritreans have not been so lucky in their attempts to flee a country where President Isaias Afewerki \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/us-embassy-cables-documents/195418\" title=\"\">described as an \"unhinged dictator\" in the US embassy cables</a> revealed by WikiLeaks \u2013 justifies the existence of his large army with the threat of a renewed conflict with Ethiopia, from which Eritrea gained independence in 1992.</p> <p>The UN estimates that 3,000 people left Eritrea in every month of 2011, most for Sudan or Ethiopia, many bound for Israel, while an investigation by the Somalia and Eritrea monitoring group uncovered a trafficking highway running from the Eritrean highlands through Sudan's refugee camps into the Sinai desert, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/feb/14/egypt-bedouin-kidnap-refugees-israel\" title=\"\">delivering Eritrean asylum-seekers to Bedouin gangs</a>, who use starvation, electrocution, rape and murder to extort up to $40,000 (\u00a325,000) from relatives in the Eritrean diaspora for their release.</p> <p>\"The situation forces people to do things that may cost them their life, but at the end of the day sometimes there isn't a choice,\" Ghebresilasie said.</p>",

About 100 youths set fire to cars, a nursery school and a youth centre as well as firing buckshot and throwing projectiles at police officers, who filled the streets with teargas as reinforcements arrived from neighbouring areas.</p> <p>\"The confrontations were very, very violent,\" the mayor of Amiens, Gilles Dumailly, told French television network BFM, describing \"a scene of devastation\". One officer was in a serious condition, Dumailly said.</p> <p>There had been unrest among youths on housing estates in Amiens-Nord earlier this month and again on Sunday night, apparently triggered by resentment over spot checks by police on residents.</p> <p>The French media reported that violence broke out between local residents and the police following a check on a driver said to be driving dangerously, near to the spot where the family and friends of a 20-year-old who died in a motorbike crash on Thursday had gathered for a memorial ceremony.</p> <p>As the unrest grew police fired teargas and rubber bullet rounds, which some residents considered excessive.</p> <p>The poor relationship between police and local youths has often been the source of conflict on housing estates across France. The northern area of Amiens in the Somme is classed among the 15 most troubled neighbourhoods in France. It was recently included in a list of the government's \"priority security zones\", which will get a reinforced police presence.</p> <p>There were riots in Amiens during the nationwide disturbances in 2005 across France's housing estates. The city has often experienced unrest, but the prefect's office said there had never been violence \"as serious as this\".</p> <p>Public buildings including a nursery school and sports centre were destroyed by fire, causing an estimated \u20ac1m (\u00a3800,000) in damage.</p> <p>A group of about 100 young men jeered and jostled the French interior minister on Tuesday when he met officials in Amiens.</p> <p>\"Calm down! Calm down!\" Manuel Valls yelled as the crowd bumped him while he entered the town hall surrounded by bodyguards.</p> <p>He told a news conference inside that a minority of people were terrorising the community. \"Firearms! Can it be considered normal that people turn firearms on police? It's unacceptable ... law and order must be restored,\" Valls said.</p> <p>The president, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, said: \"Our priority is security, which means that the next budget will include additional resources for the gendarmerie and the police.\"</p> <p>The far-right Front National party immediately seized on the unrest in the rundown neighbourhood to link insecurity in France to the issue of \"massive immigration\".</p>",
  "<p>\u2022 Massoud Shadjareh's last trip to the US was uneventful. Having studied at Berkeley University in California, he was able to take his children down memory lane. He enjoyed the sights, met with relatives. But the next trip might not go as smoothly. Shadjareh, chair of the Islamic Human Rights Commission and the driving force behind a controversial demonstration outside the US embassy in Mayfair this Friday, says he has had his visa to visit the US \u2013 valid until 2014 \u2013 revoked. \"There has been no explanation,\" he says. \"I have never given any talks or anything like that in the states. It's all very strange.\" The&#xa0;embassy can't or won't shed light on an individual case. But he does have political enemies, and we know that the US antenna is famously sensitive. In&#xa0;February <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2093796/Emily-Bunting-Leigh-Van-Bryan-UK-tourists-arrested-destroy-America-Twitter-jokes.html\" title=\"\">a British couple were banned from entering the US after tweeting that they were off to \"destroy America\"</a>. It means partying to excess, they explained. To no avail.</p> <p>\u2022 The coalition stumbles on, and&#xa0;one would have thought Labour would be taking advantage. But&#xa0;in the red corner, things are quiet. Perhaps they're being retrained. Certainly that is the case on Exeter city&#xa0;council, where members face social media tuition after Labourite Catherine Dawson was caught being beastly about Ben Howlett, the chair of Conservative Future. In a 5am tweet, <a href=\"http://www.thisisexeter.co.uk/Twitter-trouble-city-councillor/story-16633194-detail/story.html\" title=\"\">she called him a \"cheap little prick\"</a>. Big mistake. No one likes being called cheap.</p> <p>\u2022 That sound in west London, meanwhile, is the opening of a can of worms. For it seemed the issue of an alleged attempt to nobble a standards watchdog in Hounslow was going to be kicked into the long grass. Said watchdog, the former Met detective sergeant <a href=\"http://www.london2012.com/torch-relay/torchbearers/torchbearers=gurpal-virdi-798/\" title=\"\">Gurpal Virdi</a>, an independent member of&#xa0;Hounslow council's standards committee, went to the authority with evidence that a well-connected figure tried to get him on side over a planning dispute. A complaint was made to Scotland Yard, which declined to investigate. But if those said to be implicated breathed a sigh of relief, it was premature. Because Virdi, who retired from the Met earlier this year, is famously dogged, having previously brought and won a string of legal actions against the Met as the victim of false allegations and discrimination. Thus we learn that following further talks, the matter now has a crime number and is being looked into. In uniform or out, Virdi tends not to give up on things.</p> <p>\u2022 Though the Olympics were a triumph, many hope the Paralympics will do better in terms of gender equality. Someone might have a word with the official kit provider, Adidas. The women's GB football shirt was out of stock online for almost the entire duration of the Games, and things seemed no better at Adidas's flagship store in Oxford Street. When one customer asked for the women's GB football shirt, a sales assistant tartly informed her that they weren't stocking it. Too many lines to stock, they said. Something had to give. Still, there were hockey skirts for the girls. They like pink, don't they?</p> <p>\u2022 Finally, it is the stated wish of Alex Healey, the 17-year-old son&#xa0;of John Healey, the Labour MP for Wentworth and Dearne, not to get too deeply involved in representative politics. But, <a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/y567m/my_dad_is_a_member_of_parliament_and_has_been_for/\" title=\"\">on the evidence of a webchat the young man has hosted</a> about his life as the son of a prominent MP, that would be a shame. Not many of his age, in his position, could comfortably say \"ask me anything\" and expose themselves without ruin to questioning \u2013 some of it hostile \u2013 on Labour's political direction, fiscal policy and the war in Iraq \u2013 \"I was in year three at the time (I&#xa0;was eight years old). I didn't speak to him for a couple of days\". Also his dad's expenses; his father's reason for leaving the shadow cabinet \u2013 \"I was about to finish school and I don't think people realise how much it takes to be a minister/shadow minister. I saw him basically once a week\". \"Has growing up as a son of a politician encouraged or deterred you from trying to become an MP in the future,\" one questioner asks him. \"Good question,\" replies Alex.&#xa0;\"The long and short of it is, it has completely discouraged me.\" Still, there's hope and there's time.</p> <p><em>Twitter: </em><a href=\"http://twitter.com/hugh_muir\" title=\"\"><em>@hugh_muir</em></a></p>",
  "<p>The British bank Standard Chartered has agreed to pay a $340m (\u00a3220m) fine to a US regulator which had accused it of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/aug/06/standard-chartered-iran-transactions\" title=\"\">scheming with Iran</a> to hide billions of pounds' worth of transactions from the US authorities, leaving the financial system susceptible to \"terrorists\" and \"drug kingpins\".</p> <p>The last-minute settlement \u2013 just hours before the bank had been due to appear before the New York department of financial services (DFS) \u2013 came after the bank's chief executive, Peter Sands, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/aug/13/standard-chartered-boss-arrives-new-york\" title=\"\">flew into New York</a> to take direct control of the situation and despite his insistence that the allegations contained inaccuracies.</p> <p>The fine is the latest embarrassment for a UK bank, following the penalties slapped <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/jun/27/barclays-chief-bob-diamond-bonus-fine\" title=\"\">on Barclays for attempting to manipulate Libor</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/jul/17/hsbc-executive-resigns-senate\" title=\"\">the accusations levelled against HSBC for laundering money through the US for drug barons in Mexico</a>.</p> <p>It is particularly damaging for Standard Chartered \u2013 which is based in London but best known for its banking services in Asia and Africa \u2013 as its management, led by Sands, had been boasting just two weeks ago that it was \"boring\" and had a more conservative culture than its rivals.</p> <p>A week ago, the DFS said that Standard Chartered had left the US financial system \"vulnerable to terrorists, weapons dealers, drug kingpins and corrupt regimes, and deprived law enforcement investigators of crucial information used to track all manner of criminal activity\".</p> <p>Led by Benjamin Lawsky, the DFS said that the two parties had agreed that the problems included transactions of at least $250bn. This is the sum that he had included in his order last Monday. The bank conceded that $14m of transactions broke the rules and apologised for them.</p> <p>A hearing with the DFS originally scheduled for Wednesdayhas now been adjourned, but the bank may face penalties from other US authorities which are still investigating breaches of sanctions on Iran covering the period 2001 to 2007. There were suggestions last night that the $340m was half the fine the DFS had asked for.</p> <p>The bank said that a \"formal agreement\" with the DFS was expected to be completed shortly and that it was continuing to work with other regulators. The DFS alleged last week that one senior banker remonstrated with a US colleague using the words \"you fucking Americans\" when warned of the potential breaches of US sanctions. The bank was wrongfooted and took eight hours to respond publicly. US regulators have traditionally worked together when investigating alleged breaches of rules and Lawsky indicated that the DFS would work with the other bodies involved, including the US Treasury, the Federal Reserve, the New York Justice Department and the District Attorney.</p> <p>New York governor Andrew Cuomo said he had created the DFS last year because \"we believed that New York needed a tough and fair regulator for the banking and insurance industries to protect consumers and investors\".</p> <p>.</p>",

My granny used to smoke cigarettes called Sue Perkins, though they may have been spelt Superkings. Ash used to fall off into the porridge she was making, for our breakfast. Mmmm, ash porridge. She wasn't at all like Mary Berry, possibly more fun, though. But that's by the by.</p> <p>There's a new batch in.

  "<p>The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/09/gu-kailai-china-quick-trial\" title=\"\">murder trial of Gu Kailai </a>and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/mar/30/bo-xilai-profile\" title=\"\">downfall of her husband Bo Xilai</a> has lurched from Shakespearean tragedy to Victorian melodrama. All the essential elements are there: overweening ambition, a poisoning, a sink of corruption, treachery and blackmail.</p> <p>Add in the alleged British spy Neil Heywood's rendezvous with death at the Lucky Holiday Hotel in Chongqing and Gu's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/07/gu-kailai-trial-china-bo-xilai\" title=\"\">reported comment to investigators to</a> \"write up anything they'd like\"&#xa0;she couldn't remember for her confession, and China's greatest political scandal for a generation seems like a cross between an airport thriller and a Stalinist show trial.</p> <p>There's no reason to believe we'll be any the wiser as to what actually happened when the court gives its verdict and sentence \u2013 or if Bo himself, sacked as Chongqing's Communist party secretary, is put on trial for \"serious disciplinary violations\".</p> <p>The evidence suggests at least that Bo's family, like those of other Chinese leaders, enriched themselves on the back of his position \u2013 and that Heywood was up to his neck in that. What's much clearer is that the fall of Bo, who attempted to use his left-leaning Chongqing administration to secure a commanding place in the party's Beijing leadership, has been seized on to change China's political direction.</p> <p>As the scandal erupted earlier this year, powerful forces out for full-scale privatisation made a concerted bid for decisive \"reform\". In February, a World Bank report, backed by elements in the government, demanded sweeping deregulation and a \"complete transition to a market economy\". The call was taken up at the National People's Congress. Corporate interests that had&#xa0;chafed against a system in which they claimed \"the state advances, the private sector retreats\" launched a neoliberal offensive.</p> <p>As the Chongqing crisis came to a head in April, Premier Wen Jiabao declared that the state banks' monopoly had to be \"broken\". After Bo's police chief tried to defect to the US embassy, the backlash intensified. Wen linked Chongqing with the taboo Cultural Revolution and a string of Maoist and leftist websites were banned.</p> <p>The basis for the politicisation of the scandal isn't hard to find. Bo himself was a populist politician on the make, not a Maoist. But the policies he championed gelled into a Chongqing model which appealed to China's \"new left\" and created a political pole for those looking to overcome the ballooning wealth gap and social costs of China's breakneck development.</p> <p>His \"sing red\" revival of revolutionary songs and culture and \"smash black\" campaign against organised crime grabbed the most attention, and have now been closed down. But it was the huge expansion of low-cost housing and&#xa0;welfare provision from the profits of a burgeoning state-owned economy, combined with 3m \"hukou\" urban residence permits handed out to migrant workers, which explains why Bo remains popular in Chongqing even after his disgrace.</p> <p>Chongqing's departure from government policy can be exaggerated \u2013 its private sector has expanded even faster than the public sector and foreign investment boomed. But the gap between Chongqing and the Guangdong model \u2013 where party secretary, Wang Yang, has hailed the role of private enterprise and growth rather than distribution, under the slogan \"small government, big society\" \u2013 is clear enough.</p> <p>In the aftermath of Bo's fall, the triumph of Guangdong was duly declared. But, <a href=\"http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2012/08/08/the_chongqing_model_worked\" title=\"\">as Kevin Lu of the World Bank's foreign investment agency argues in Foreign Policy magazine</a>, \"the&#xa0;Chongqing model worked\" \u2013 by mobilising state resources to boost collective consumption.</p> <p>And it is the decisive role of publicly owned banks and companies in China's hybrid economy that has delivered <a href=\"http://www.china.org.cn/opinion/2012-08/03/content_26114793.htm\" title=\"\">the fastest growth per head of any major economy in history</a> over the past decade, the most rapid consumption growth and the largest-scale poverty reduction programme ever.</p> <p>In particular, the Chinese government's ability to instruct state banks and enterprises to drive up investment during the global crisis is the main reason why its economy has grown by 40% over the past four years, while the US's grew by 1%, the EU's shrank by 1.5% and Britain's by 4.3%. Within that expansion there have of course been inefficiencies and speculative bubbles \u2013 not to mention the environmental degradation, corruption and gross inequality that has disfigured China's rise.</p> <p>Nevertheless, as western economies continue to stagnate or worse, it's hardly the time to hand over the reins to the private sector \u2013 as demanded by China's corporate class and the US government (US treasury secretary <a href=\"http://www.treasury.gov/press-center/press-releases/Pages/tg1553.aspx\" title=\"\">Tim Geithner grumbles that Chinese state enterprises have an unfair advantage</a> because they don't pay \"market-based dividends\").</p> <p>But in the climate of \"reform\" and liberalisation earlier this year, the Chinese government held back from the kind of direct investment needed to offset stagnating global markets \u2013 and the private sector failed to respond. The result has been falling growth \u2013 and Beijing is now again having to shift back to a state-driven stimulus.</p> <p>In the next few weeks, China's highest level leaders will be chosen for the next decade. What course they take won't just be settled by what goes on behind closed doors but by what happens on the ground in a country where there are now 180,000 \"collective protest incidents\" a year.</p> <p>Resistance to neoliberal pressure is \"very strong in both society and government\", <a href=\"http://www.lrb.co.uk/v34/n09/-wanghui/the-rumour-machine\" title=\"\">Tsinghua University's professor Wang Hui</a> argues. But how the political struggle over the lessons of Chongqing and Guangdong is resolved will help to determine China's future.</p> <p><em>Twitter: </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/SeumasMilne\" title=\"\"><em>@SeumasMilne</em></a></p>",
  "<p>Great Britain are on course to win more medals in Rio in four years' time than they did in London, according to the funding body that underpinned the nation's best Olympic performance in more than a century.</p> <p>No host nation has managed to avoid a drop off in its performance at the Games that followed but UK Sport's chief executive, Liz Nicholl, said there was \"no reason\" why Team GB could not better its London medal haul of 65 in Brazil.</p> <p>Peter Keen, the former UK Sport performance director who devised its \"no compromise\" strategy, also said it was \"game on\" to improve on the London medal tally in 2016.</p> <p>\"More medals is entirely possible,\" said Nicholl. \"That is something we would want to commit to. If the system gets better, there's no reason why we can't get more medals.\"</p> <p>Keen said: \"There are so many things we can improve, whether that's governance or coaching. If we apply the knowledge we've got, there's no reason we can't get more medals. It's absolutely game on.\"</p> <p>If ministers get their way, it could be that Lord Coe, who delivered London's successful Games, will lead the most successful British team in 104 years into the next one. Ministers are understood to be keen that Coe becomes the next chairman of the British Olympic Association, after Lord Moynihan announced he would step down a year early in November.</p> <p>UK Sport hailed the success of Britain's Olympians, who exceeded its pre-Games target of at least 48 medals and at least fourth place in the medal table. After they had won their last medal, in the modern pentathlon on Sunday, the count stood at 65 \u2013 the exact number that Keen privately predicted before the Games. They finished behind only the USA and China in the medal table.</p> <p>In public UK Sport would say before the Games only that it hoped to win between 40 and 70 medals and finish at least fourth in the medal table. It set 48 as the baseline. \"We knew top four was a possibility; we knew we could challenge the Russians,\" said Baroness Campbell, the chair of UK Sport. \"We can truly say this is the most successful Olympic team ever and the high performance system here is clearly working. Our no compromise approach clearly is working. We're proud of the athletes and we're proud of the sports.\"</p> <p>In Beijing athletes won 47 medals in 12 sports. Officials took heart from the fact that Britain won medals across 17 sports in London and that the sports that have delivered the lion's share of medals over recent years \u2013 cycling, rowing, sailing \u2013 continued to succeed.</p> <p>The government this week promised to maintain investment in elite sport at roughly the same level for the Rio cycle, by putting \u00a3508m into UK Sport over the next four years.</p> <p>UK Sport is reviewing funding levels for every sport. As revealed by the Guardian in June, sports that qualified for London only because they were awarded home nation places are likely to see their funding cut altogether unless they can prove they will qualify for Rio, perform creditably and be in with a good chance of a medal by 2020. The vulnerable sports include synchronised swimming, beach volleyball, basketball, table tennis, handball, indoor volleyball, water polo, rhythmic gymnastics and weightlifting. \"We will not be able to fund every sport,\" said Nicholl. \"Our aim is to make sure that we invest in every sport with medal potential. That for us is an absolute minimum. The starting point for handball and other sports with host nation places is to demonstrate they can qualify by right for the Olympics. If they can't be there, we can't invest in them.</p> <p>\"A sport like handball has been able to raise its profile like never before. It should be able to attract interest from the general public and corporate sponsors. Every sport must be responsible for growing itself to the point where it can get a medal. We'd love to see it come through to a position in future where they could qualify by right.\"</p> <p>Every sport must submit a revised business plan by October in light of their performance at the London Games and the UK Sport board will decide how to allocate its funds on 12 December.</p> <p>Ministers, keen to create a more joined-up approach across British sport and replicate the success at the elite end in community sport, hope Coe will consider becoming the BOA chairman after the Paralympics.</p> <p>The move would be compatible with a portfolio of other business and sporting interests and wouldnot necessarily preclude him also running to be president of the International Association of Athletics Federations when that job becomes vacant in 2015.</p> <p>Coe has agreed to become a part-time \"legacy ambassador\" to the coalition government, but ministers are keen for him to take on the BOA role. They also hope to persuade Sir Keith Mills, the deputy chairman at Locog, to take on a dual role as chair of UK Sport and Sport England.</p> <p>Plans to merge the two bodies have been put on ice, but a joint chairman could be an option to try to get the two bodies to work more closely together and maximise their commercial income.</p>",
  "<p>An independent inquiry has established that&#xa0;Anders Behring Breivik, the clean-cut white supremacist who methodically murdered 77 people in Norway, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/13/anders-behring-breivik-attacks-halted-report?utm_source=twitterfeed&amp;utm_medium=twitter\" title=\"\">moved around unchallenged for three hours after detonating a car bomb,</a> despite police receiving eyewitness accounts of an armed man in protective gear.</p> <p>Were the police looking for a different kind of killer? Or, despite the existence of a long-established white power underground in Norway, was it assumed that this was not a terrorist attack which would have triggered a protocol of nationwide alerts and roadblocks? The verdict on Breivik, whom prosecutors wanted declared insane and who believes multiculturalism has harmed \"white Christian identity\", is due in a few days.</p> <p>While mass killing always has a madness to its method, white supremacists are all too often declared to be psychopathic loners, where others are seen as part of organised ideological networks.</p> <p>Following the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/05/gunman-sikh-temple-wisconsin\" title=\"\">massacre of Sikh worshippers by another white supremacist in Wisconsin last week</a>, little was made of the similarities between this apparently \"senseless killing\" and the recent <a href=\"http://presstv.com/detail/2012/08/08/255058/mosque-target-hate-crime/\" title=\"\">firebombing of a Missouri mosque</a>. Had <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/08/wade-michael-page-violent-far-right?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">Wade Page</a> been Wadi Pervez and his victims predominantly white, talking heads would have debated the relationship between his religion and violent inclinations while \"moderate Muslims\" would distance \"the community\" from him.</p> <p>Instead, there were suggestions that Page had targeted Sikhs \"unfairly\", alongside irrelevant discussions about Sikhism. Chances are that <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/06/21/peter-king-muslim-radicalization-hearings_n_1613746.html\" title=\"\">Representative Peter King will not hold hearings, as he did for Muslims</a>, on the \"extent of radicalisation in the American white Christian community and that community's response\".</p> <p>While black and, more recently, Muslim anger are widely seen as the problematic pathologies of our times, and thus subjected to the full weight of sociological, scriptural, political and even economic analysis, declared white rage is routinely relegated to the fringes, written off as the result of individual psychopathy, and eliciting passing interest only after blood is shed. Supremacists warn that there are \"thousands of other angry white men like Page out there, the vast majority of them unknown\". Yet as former department of homeland security analyst <a href=\"http://www.democracynow.org/2012/8/9/former_dhs_analyst_daryl_johnson_on\" title=\"\">Daryl Johnson points out</a>, an extensive report on rightwing terrorism, including white extremism, was angrily repudiated by Congress in 2009 and the number of security analysts devoted to domestic non-Islamic terrorism slashed to just one.</p> <p>This marginalising of the real and present danger of white terrorism at a time when other forms of religious or nationalist militancy are under unprecedented scrutiny has to do with how \"whiteness\" itself operates.</p> <p>Sociologists note that in Europe and America, whiteness and the privileges that have accrued to it historically are reliant on invisibility. To have white privilege is to not identify or be identified as racially specific unlike, say, \"black athletes\", \"Asian entrepreneurs\" or just an ethnic minority air passenger.</p> <p>White supremacists make it difficult to uphold the individualist axiom that society is now \"post-racial\" or \"colour blind\". By asserting racial affiliation and calling for (the perpetuation of) an endangered white domination, they paradoxically undermine a more quotidian white power which, writes scholar Richard Dyer, \"secures its dominance\" by remaining ostensibly featureless and general. It can sit aloof from \"multiculturalism\", which is deemed a special pleading thing that only ethnic minorities do.</p> <p>Whiteness is no more scientific or natural than any other racial category and is as internally diverse, but it still has huge operative force. It has expanded over time from an Anglo-Saxon and Nordic provenance to include, for instance, the Irish and Italians. Historians such as <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Roediger\" title=\"\">David Roediger</a> and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noel_Ignatiev\" title=\"\">Noel Ignatiev</a> have shown how who was deemed white was often linked to capitalist imperatives, such as union-busting, increasing earning power and dividing labour forces. That economic affluence still bears on ideas of whiteness is clear from pejoratives such as \"chavs\" or \"white trash\" attached to \"poor whites\", the qualifier itself implying contradiction.</p> <p>While its institutional force is denied, a sense of collective whiteness is still appealed to for political purposes, often in code, through invocations of \"shared Anglo-Saxon heritage\" or attacks on immigration, criminal \"black culture\" and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/jul/28/olympics-multicultural-crap-tweet-misunderstood\" title=\"\">\"leftie multicultural crap\"</a>. When <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2012/aug/10/david-cameron-school-sports-targets\" title=\"\">David Cameron knowingly invokes \"Indian dance\"</a> as a time-wasting activity that justifies target cuts as sports fields are sold off, the address is to the presumed racial solidarity of the \"you and I who wouldn't think of [it] as sport\". It's the multiculturalism, stupid!</p> <p>Though all white supremacists are not poor, a brutally inequitable economic order generates underclass anger, and there is encouragement for this sometimes murderous rage to be displaced on to foreigners, Muslims, gays, blacks, Jews and immigrants.</p> <p>With ongoing military conflicts also pitting a \"civilised west against archaic others\", is it sheer coincidence that Page was an ex-soldier now thrown, like many veterans, into an economy where there are neither jobs nor prospects?</p> <p>No murderer represents a community. But all killers, however psychopathic, act in a context, whether of economic deprivation, racism, militarisation, gun proliferation or lack of mental healthcare. To minimise these social realities in favour of individual psychopathy condemns us all to shooting in the dark.</p> <p><em>Comments on this article will be switched on tomorrow</em></p>",
  "<p>Sometimes, it's not what you do, but how you do it that counts. For proof of this, one need look no further than Sleeping Dogs, United Front's love-letter to Hong Kong action movies' late 1980s heyday. Here is a game that sounds like a cocktail of movie tropes and game mechanics that have been reheated and refried so many times that you can practically smell grease on them. But if you're able to stop picking at its component parts and just appreciate Sleeping Dogs as a whole, you'll most likely find that it's one of the most thrilling and consistently enjoyable games of 2012.</p> <p>Sleeping Dogs tells the story of Wei Shen, a Hong Kong bruiser who has just returned to his hometown after a lengthy stint in the US. Things kick off with Wei being thrown in a holding cell for selling narcotics and while there, he bumps into Jackie, a childhood mate who is languishing down the bottom end of the food chain in the local Triads. Wei asks if Jackie can get him some work, and before you know it, Wei's collecting protection money from market stall owners, stealing and selling cars and beating up rival gang members with a tyre iron. What Wei's new Triad mates don't know is that their newfound muscleman is an undercover cop, tasked with bringing down their criminal organisation from within.</p> <p>If the plot set-up in Sleeping Dogs sounds a little tried and tested, then the gaming structure that houses it will strike readers as even more so. To put it bluntly, Sleeping Dogs owes a huge debt of influence to the Grand Theft Auto series. It's set in a huge urban sandbox that the player navigates on foot and in vehicles, it tells a crime story through a series of fetch-quests and, yes, there are a ton of mini-games, side missions, car chases, gun battles and fist fights.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-394731256\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Technology/Pix/pictures/2012/8/14/1344954462813/Sleeping-Dogs-008.jpg\" alt=\"Sleeping Dogs\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sleeping Dogs</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But while United Front is working with an established gaming rubric and plot elements that are older than the game's age certificate, it infuses the proceedings with an enticing freshness that allows players to ignore their cliched origins.</p> <p>Take, for example, Wei's loyalties and how they're split between his Triad comrades and the police commanders to whom he reports. Sure, this is a plot device that's one part City on Fire and two parts Infernal Affairs, but United Front uses it as a springboard and dives straight to its murky depths.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-394731257\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Technology/Pix/pictures/2012/8/14/1344954780836/Sleeping-Dogs-008.jpg\" alt=\"Sleeping Dogs\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sleeping Dogs</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As Wei works his way up the Triad ranks, he becomes more valuable as a police asset, but he also becomes attached to the criminals he's essentially trying to bring down. His Triad brethren may be a pack of violent thugs and psychopaths, but they have strong codes about loyalty and family, and they care far more about Wei's well-being than his police commanders. They, for their part, are more concerned with building a case against the Triad bosses, and if that means Wei has to break the law, or put himself in harm's way, so be it. In a way, the taskforce commanders are as callous and calculating as the Triad overlords they're trying to bust.</p> <p>So on the surface, Sleeping Dogs is about a man with divided allegiances, but as the player progresses through the game, United Front digs deeper with its narrative. The taskforce authorities show a disturbing willingness to blur the lines of legality; the regular police find themselves having to use Wei's Triad connections to solve crimes that their commanders aren't concerned with. As Wei advances through the ranks, his former friends become liabilities he has to protect. And the Triad's code of honour is revealed to be little more than a set of manners that the gang leaders are expected to observe as they engage in bloody turf wars, which are later revealed to be part of a more insidious power play.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-394731258\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Technology/Pix/pictures/2012/8/14/1344954697130/Sleeping-Dogs-008.jpg\" alt=\"Sleeping Dogs\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sleeping Dogs</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Every time the player thinks they have the story clocked, United Front peels away another layer that both changes their expectations and ups the dramatic stakes. It's not completely original, but it's effective nonetheless. The fact that all the characters in the game are very well written and superbly voiced doesn't hurt, either. In short, United Front works hard to pull the player into the game's narrative, and it's easy to become invested in Wei's story even before the action starts. It's easily one of game's strongest assets.</p> <p>The game's second trump card is the in-game map of Hong Kong, represented here as a neon-encrusted metropolis where majestic skyscrapers tower over a sprawling hive of illicit activity. Flea markets and illegal fight clubs rub shoulders with chop shops and gang hangouts. Every main road and highway begs to be raced along, and the city's street grid is intercut by a ton of back alleys and side streets.</p> <p>The map is also bursting with activities, mini-games and side-quests for the player to get stuck into; they can bet money on mahjong or cock fights, compete in street brawls for money and test their mettle on the street racing circuit. In one particularly challenging mini-game, players can attack gang members in their hangouts, hack the nearest CCTV camera and then use it to bust local drug dealers. They can also hunt for lock boxes containing cash, shrines that offer health upgrades and a collection of statues they can trade at the local dojo to open up new combat moves.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-394731259\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Technology/Pix/pictures/2012/8/14/1344954633802/Sleeping-Dogs-009.jpg\" alt=\"Sleeping Dogs\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sleeping Dogs</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Story missions and side quests inevitably lead to gun battles, car chases or fist fights and United Front have done a lot of work to make Wei feel and handle like an action movie hero. The hand-to-hand combat system is a two-button affair that owes a debt of inspiration to Batman: Arkham Asylum, but it's loads of fun to use and surprisingly deep. Not only do players have a lengthy list of combos to unlock, they can also use items in Wei's environment to dispatch foes in decidedly grisly fashion \u2013 like wall fans into which they can shove faces or meat hooks on which they can impale torsos.</p> <p>Gun fights handle like they would in a cover-based third-person-shooter, but there's an element of bullet-time tossed in for good measure; when Wei vaults cover, the action slows down and players are able to easily draw a bead on opponents. Driving sections remain fun and fresh due to the fact that the game doesn't penalise players too much for collisions. Players are also able to ram other cars off the road using the X button, or hijack other vehicles by having Wei leap out of his car and onto the roof of a target in a move that'll prompt a knowing smile in anyone who ever played Midway's Wheelman.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-394731260\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Technology/Pix/pictures/2012/8/14/1344954508143/Sleeping-Dogs-008.jpg\" alt=\"Sleeping Dogs\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sleeping Dogs</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Nearly everything the player does feeds XP into three meters: Face, Police and Triad. The latter two unlock abilities on two skill trees, such as the ability to hotwire a car without setting off an alarm, or the power to disarm an opponent in one swift combat move. High Face rating allows players to wear sharp suits and drive flash cars, but it also bestows gifts such as a car valet who'll deliver a vehicle for Wei anytime and any place he needs it.</p> <p>So while Sleeping Dogs works from an established palette, it's an absolute blast to play. Like the Uncharted series, the focus here isn't to break new ground for the medium through innovation. Instead, the aim here is to make the player feel like an action hero in a piece of blockbuster entertainment, while remaining fun to play throughout. Sleeping Dogs is not the most original game you'll play all year, but it's easily one of the most enjoyable and it's arguably one of the best.</p>",
  "<p>For Pakistan's broadcasters, no celebration of the country's 65th birthday would be complete without Muhammad Ali Jinnah. Every few minutes, usually in a burst of graphics, images of the tall, gaunt lawyer who managed to carve the country out of British India in 1947 takes over the screen.</p> <p>After a few seconds of grainy black and white footage of the man known as the Quaid-i-Azam, or \"great leader\", the viewer is returned to presenters wearing suitably patriotic green clothes and reports about the day's events, including military parades and the festooning of Islamabad's major public buildings with spectacular quantities of lights.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-394712228\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/14/1344958656110/Muhammad-Ali-Jinnah-002.jpg\" alt=\"Muhammad Ali Jinnah\" width=\"140\" height=\"130\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Muhammad Ali Jinnah.

Yet this is regarded by many as the most important Jinnah moment of all.</p> <p>For it has become a touchstone for liberals aghast by the state of Pakistan, which they fear is increasingly intolerant of its minorities, including Hindus, Christians and Ahmadis, who regard themselves as a sect of Islam but are legally banned from calling themselves Muslims.</p> <p>\"You may belong to any religion, caste or creed \u2013 that has nothing to do with the business of the state,\" Jinnah told the gathering on 11 August 1947.</p> <p>Murtaza Solangi, director general of Radio Pakistan, said the speech had become a \"dividing line between the forces who want Pakistan to go in a particular direction\".</p> <p>\"Those who want it to be a sectarian or communal or Islamic state don't recognise this speech and never talk about it,\" he said. \"And [for] those who want Pakistan to be an inclusive Muslim state where people are free to practise their faith and not discriminate on basis of religion this is kind of rallying cry.\"</p> <p>Solangi has been on a quest to find a recording of the speech, which even in text form was ignored for decades, particularly during the 1980s when the country's leaders actively sought to create a more Islamic society.</p> <p>While state broadcaster Radio Pakistan has an almost complete library of Jinnah speeches, his call for a secular Pakistan is absent. No one has a copy. Both the BBC and All India Radio were asked to check their archives, but nothing was unearthed.</p> <p>There are near-daily reminders that Pakistan has struggled to live up to Jinnah's ideals. Hindu leaders cite killings, abductions and forced marriages, warning that many Hindus have had enough and are trying to leave the country.</p> <p>Last week, hundreds of Hindu pilgrims who attempted to travel to India were held up at the border after the government feared they would claim asylum. Despite assuring they would not, several crossed the border and promptly announced to Indian reporters their intentions never to return to Pakistan.</p> <p>Solangi said if a copy of Jinnah's speech was ever found and broadcast it would be \"huge\" because in the ongoing struggle about what sort of place Pakistan should be his voice would be \"galvanising\".</p> <p>\"It is not easy to discredit Jinnah, the founder of the country,\" he said.</p>",
  "<p>A man convicted of trying to blow up an Israeli airliner 26 years ago no longer poses a security threat and could be released on parole in Britain, the high court has been told.</p> <p>However, in an extraordinary twist, Nezar Hindawi, a Palestinian, remains in prison because he wants to go to Jordan, his adopted country. British officials say they do not know whether Jordan is willing to accept him so he must stay in jail in the UK.</p> <p>The case is in marked contrast to that of Abu Qatada, the radical Islamist preacher the UK government has been trying for years to deport to his native Jordan. In this long-running case, the high court in the autumn will test Britain's assurances from Jordan that evidence obtained from torture will not be used in Qatada's impending terrorist trial there.</p> <p>At a high court hearing in the Hindawi case, Mr Justice Silber has ruled that Hindawi can challenge the continuing refusal to release him on the grounds that it is irrational.</p> <p>Hindawi was sentenced to 45 years in jail in 1986 for attempting to place a bomb on an El Al aircraft in the baggage of his unwitting and pregnant girlfriend at Heathrow. He was described at his trial as an agent of the Syrian government.</p> <p>In 2009, the Parole Board said he could be released on licence for deportation to Jordan since it judged there was no further risk of him offending.</p> <p>However, the then justice secretary, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/nov/25/terrorist-1986-minister-refusal-release\" title=\"\">Jack Straw, vetoed the recommendation</a>. The board accused the government of adopting a \"cynical\" attitude by not bothering to find out the attitude of the Jordanians to Hindawi's potential presence in their country.</p> <p>Last year, the high court ruled that Straw's veto was unlawful. The board subsequently changed its mind and said Hindawi should not be released after all unless Jordan specifically said it had no objection to him being deported and sent there.</p> <p>It is this decision that will now be challenged in the high court.</p> <p>The Parole Board argued that Hindawi may make speeches in Jordan inciting others to acts of terrorism. But Tim Owen QC, instructed by BirnbergPeirce, for Hindawi told the high court the board's approach was \"irrational and grossly unfair\".</p> <p>It was particularly irrational, Hindawi's lawyers say, to argue that his actions could be managed and monitored in the UK \u2013 as the Parole Board says could be done\u2013 yet could not be managed in Jordan.</p> <p>Anthony Layden, a Foreign Office official responsible for negotiations over deportations \u2013 including the Qatada case \u2013 told the Parole Board last year the issue was \"fraught with difficulty\" since Hindawi's attempted terrorist attack was aimed at an Israeli airliner.</p> <p>He added: \"Jordan has for many years had an official modus vivendi with Israel, but this is not universally popular in Jordan.\"</p> <p>However, Layden concluded that if Hindawi had satisfied the Parole Board in the UK \"that he no longer poses a threat to the security of the United Kingdom, the Jordanian authorities will conclude that he does not a pose a threat to Jordan\".</p> <p>Lawyers familiar with the case suggest that British officials are stonewalling \u2013 that they do not want to be accused of taking any active part in Hindawi's release and are therefore in no hurry to press the Jordanians on whether they would accept him.</p> <p>Ironically, if Hindawi wins his forthcoming legal challenge he stands a greater chance of being released here and not being deported at all.</p> <p>Hindawi is likely to be released in 2016 \u2013 30 years after he was convicted, lawyers say.</p>",
  "<p>Attacks on a packed bazaar in south-western Afghanistan and a food market in the north have killed nearly 40 people and injured over 70 others, almost all of them civilians, making Tuesday one of the bloodiest days in a summer of heavy violence.</p> <p>In normally peaceful Nimroz province a team of suicide bombers struck around 3.30pm local time.</p> <p>One targeted a hospital gate bazaar bustling with people buying food for their evening meal, and making preparations for this weekend's Eid holiday, which marks the end of the holy month of Ramadan.</p> <p>At least 29 people died and more than 50 were injured, said Abdul Majid Latifi, head of the police's intelligence operation for the province. Of the dead, 24 were civilians, many of them women and children.</p> <p>\"There were around 100 people selling phone cards, fruits and other things in a small space on the street, every three or four metres a vendor,\" said Abdul Hadi Azizi, head of the province's criminal investigation department.</p> <p>\"Just imagine how many people must have been there with all the shoppers as well.\" Many of the wounded had serious injuries, so the toll was likely to rise, he added.</p> <p>The attack was the deadliest that Nimroz province has endured in over 10 years of war, but both of the intelligence officials warned that it could have been far worse.</p> <p>They disrupted a cell of 11 suicide attackers on Monday night, killing two in a village just outside the provincial capital, capturing three others, and confiscating a car packed with explosives and several guns and assault rifles.</p> <p>\"Last night the group suicide attackers were planing something for today, so we launched an operation,\" said Latifi. However police did not manage to track down the whole group.</p> <p>Six suicide bombers escaped, but police shot three dead the next day before they could detonate their explosives. The one attacker who targeted the hospital gates caused most of the bloodshed; two policemen were also wounded by a separate explosion, Latifi added.</p> <p>There was no immediately obvious motive for the attack in a sparsely-populated corner of Afghanistan with no foreign presence, nestled against the border with Iran.</p> <p>It lies on a drug smuggling route, which brings some violence, but there has been little insurgent activity compared to neighbouring Helmand province. A Taliban spokesman declined to comment on whether the group were responsible for the attack.</p> <p>\"I don't think there was any flashpoint or target. They are just trying to make a disaster by killing civilians,\" said Shakila Hakimi, head of the provincial council.</p> <p>The attacks came just days after two policemen shot dead nine of their comrades in an unprovoked attack in a northern corner of the province, a reminder of spreading violence.</p> <p>In northern Kunduz province, just a few hours after the Nimroz attack, a motorbike packed with explosives was detonated in a small town's food market as people prepared to break the Ramadan fast.</p> <p>\"10 people were killed, and 21 injured, all civilians,\" said the provincial police chief, Samiullah Qatra, adding that among the victims were children who sold deep-fried potato pancakes and other popular snacks.</p> <p>There are growing fears in Afghanistan that as western troops speed up a security handover to their Afghan counterparts, who are much less well-trained and equipped, the country will see a rise in violence.</p> <p>The UN said this week that civilian casualties were around 5% higher in July than the same month of 2011. They had declined in the first half of the year but officials described the fall as a \"hollow trend\" linked to an exceptionally harsh winter, rather than evidence of improved security.</p> <p>A rising toll in recent months would broadly fit with security data from the Nato-led coalition, which said that between April and June Taliban attacks on foreign and Afghan forces rose 11% from a year earlier.</p> <p>\u2022 Additional reporting by Mokhtar Amiri</p>",

One local resident, after last year's festival, commented: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I doubt that any screening in the country could match the pleasure of seeing <em>The Fog</em> at St Mary's lighthouse.</p> </blockquote> <p><br>Now in its third year, the festival's screenings and events take place at venues including the attractive 125 foot high <a href=\"http://www.friendsofstmarysisland.co.uk/\">St Mary's Lighthouse</a>, the astonishing grandeur of Vanbrugh's <a href=\"http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/seaton-delaval-hall/\">Seaton Delaval Hall</a>, a shopping mall, Spanish City's seafront dome, a seafront caf\u00e9 and a charity shop.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-394729190\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/14/1344947641445/Whitley_Bay_Outer_Dome_cred_Oran_Milstein.jpg\" alt=\"Dome Whitley Bay film festival\" width=\"160\" height=\"107\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Dome at Whitley Bay's Spanish City.

This year will see <em>The Piano</em> shown on the beach, <em>Dawn of the Dead</em> in a bland shopping centre and <em>Whisky Galore</em> at St Mary's Lighthouse. There is also a \"Secret Cinema\", in which the location and film are kept under wraps until the last minute. Last year clues led the audience to a seafront hotel, where <em>The Shining</em> was shown in a mock-up of the eerie ballroom of the Overlook Hotel.</p> <p>In the more normal surroundings of the <a href=\"http://www.playhousewhitleybay.co.uk/\">Whitley Bay Playhouse</a> there will be a screening of the 2007 film <em>Across the Universe</em>. This was co-written by the festival's patron, Whitley Bay-born <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0478588/\">Ian la Frenais</a> \u2013 best known for his work on programmes like <em>The Likely Lads</em> and <em><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2002/apr/29/firstnight.broadcasting?INTCMP=SRCH\">Auf Wiedersehen Pet</a></em>. It will be followed by an interview with the writer and a chance for the audience to ask questions. He will also discuss the forthcoming TV series <em><a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/latestnews/2012/spies-of-warsaw.html\">The Spies of Warsaw</a></em>, starring David Tennant and Janet Montgomery, in an adaptation of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2009/may/31/spies-of-warsaw-alan-furst?INTCMP=SRCH\">Alan Furst's novel</a>, due to be broadcast on BBC 4 this autumn. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-394729191\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/14/1344947743015/Whitley_Bay_Dome_Int_cred_Oran_Milstein.jpg\" alt=\"Dome film festival whitley bay\" width=\"160\" height=\"107\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Take your seats.

  "<p>Breezes carried the last notes of the muezzin's call to prayer over the rust-brown mountains.

They sell fairy floss and bags of popcorn from long poles slung over shoulders, or strings of sea shells, acrylic socks and steaming coals.</p> <p>Youngsters swung on the play equipment in the shade of the crumbling Mamluk fort. Teenage girls chatted, stretching their toes toward the water. Fully dressed from head to toe, some plunged screaming into the water, then trudged back on to land dripping and grinning. Others stared across the water to the Israeli town of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eilat\" title=\"\">Eilat</a>, whose bright lights formed a pretty lace in the darkening sky.</p> <p>Shadows spread across the sand while lovers murmured, sitting chastely side by side.

  "<p>Just how far will the dispute between Iraq and Iraqi Kurdistan go? Clashes between the Iraqi prime minister, Nouri al-Maliki, and the Kurdish president, Massoud Barzani, have been escalating since the US withdrawal at the end of 2011, leading to speculation about the declaration of an <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/oct/14/kurdish-strategy-iraq-kurdistan\" title=\"\">independent Kurdish state</a>. Certainly the hypothesis of an armed conflict between the central Iraqi government and the autonomous Kurdish region cannot be excluded.</p> <p>One recent example of current tensions occurred last month when the Kurdish peshmerga prevented the Iraqi national army from reaching the Fishkhabur crossing into Syria in the Zimar region, one of the \"disputed territories\". According to AFP, an anonymous Iraqi source has accused the Kurdish authorities of illegally buying anti-aircraft and anti-tank weapons \"with help from a foreign country\". Fingers point to Turkey, which supports Iraqi Kurdistan and is in conflict with Baghdad. Last spring Barzani tried in vain to dissuade the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/feedarticle/9775961\" title=\"\">US from selling F16 fighter planes</a> to Iraq.</p> <p>This tension has been exacerbated by the war in Syria. Barzani supports the rebels whereas Maliki, who is pro-Iran supports Bashar al-Assad. Profiting from this situation, the Iraqi branch of al-Qaida has resurfaced and on 23 July claimed responsibility for a series of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jul/24/116-dead-iraq-attacks\" title=\"\">attacks that killed 116</a> people.</p> <p>Baghdad and Erbil have an endless list of grievances, ranging from border controls and the integration of the peshmerga to the Iraqi national army, to the delimitation of Kurdistan and the sharing of wealth between the centre and the autonomous region \u2013 especially oil.</p> <p>There is a fear that growing Kurdish independence will serve as an example to the Sunni provinces, or even to the oil-rich Shia province of Basra in the far south of Iraq, which produces 2m of the 2.5m Iraqi barrels a day. \"Al-Maliki would far rather be the leader of a large country than the master of a 'Shia-istan' in the south of Iraq,\" was one western diplomat's analysis. Conversely, Barzani sees himself as the defender of Iraqi minorities in the face of Shia \"hegemony\". That is why he granted asylum to the Sunni vice-president Tariq al-Hashemi in December 2011, after he was judged in abstentia in Iraq for having headed a death squad during the civil war (2005-2008).</p> <p>The Kurdish-Sunni rapprochement, promoted by Turkey, has led to a coalition that is seeking to overthrow Maliki \u2013 so far without success. In retaliation, the Iraqi prime minister denounced his opponent's corruption and nepotism on a private Kurdish television station last June, pointing out that Barzani's son heads the autonomous region's security services while his nephew is prime minister.</p> <p>At the core of this friction lies the issue of Iraqi Kurdistan's independence. According to one diplomat, Barzani's dilemma is as follows:&#xa0;\"He knows that Kurdistan is not ready and that other countries in the region would not appreciate a declaration of independence. But he is also aware that the longer he waits, the stronger Baghdad will become.\"</p> <p>This article originally appeared in <a href=\"http://www.lemonde.fr\" title=\"\">Le Monde</a></p>",
  "<p>I was particularly struck by Clive Stafford Smith's comment about the madness of the justice system <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/law/2012/jul/08/clive-stafford-smith-jury-system-insanity\" title=\"\">(Implacable foe of the death penalty, 3 August)</a>. It is something I have pondered, and was brought home to me recently when I was burgled. I came home to a ransacked house and various things stolen, and in no time two detectives and a fingerprint man were busy in my house.</p> <p>Next day a uniformed policeman gave me a number for my insurance company, which in due course replaced the stolen items. Later I was filled in on the identification of the suspect, who will almost certainly get a custodial sentence. I was a little shaky for a few nights afterwards, and a little inconvenienced while waiting for replacements.</p> <p>Consider in comparison the plight of the many children whose parents, including a vast army of absent fathers, have abandoned them for various reasons. These children, almost without exception, grow up feeling unwanted, deserted and maligned, usually at a very young age. And carry, at the very least, what some may call a chip on their shoulders for the rest of their lives.</p> <p>Where is the justice and lawful support for these children? How is it possible that the law works unceasingly to find the cat burglar, but ignores the deserting parents who are, after all, very easy to identify? Why is it not unlawful to abandon your child?</p> <p><strong>Gaynor McGrath</strong><br>Armidale, NSW, Australia</p> <p><strong>More than some can bear</strong></p> <p>Amelia Gentleman's expos\u00e9 of what goes on at a strip club is, for most of us men, not much of a revelation at all <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2012/jul/20/lap-dancing-club-behind-scenes\" title=\"\">(Too much to bare, 3 August)</a>. If you want to get to the real truth, just ask a man that frequents these places.</p> <p>Strip clubs are for men who either can't get sex on their own, have been married for a long time and miss the contact with a different woman or recluses that can't get near a woman. The ugly truth of these clubs is that if the girls want to make money, they have to be willing to prostitute themselves. There is the off-chance that a rookie (a man) will go in and a girl will empty his wallet because he never bothered to ask how much a lap dance is and he keeps asking for another one. Other than that, most clubs are full-service places and the fee is usually $160 for 30 minutes for full service, half that for half-service.</p> <p>It's the ugly truth. A club gets busted, it opens under a new name in a different place \u2013 ad nauseam.</p> <p><strong>Maximo Pichardo</strong><br>New York City, US</p> <p>\u2022 The 3 August edition of Guardian Weekly runs to 48 pages, of which a full four, including photographs, are devoted to Amelia Gentleman's article about one of London's oldest lap-dancing clubs. Is this some sort of joke on the part of editor Abby Deveney or is the Guardian doing its best to become \"trendy\" in an effort to get away from its starchy image of a serious medium for the intelligentsia? If so, please desist, lest we revolt against having the piss taken out of us even more.</p> <p>Perhaps you have already planned a follow-up article on pole-dancing or massage parlours. The mind boggles.</p> <p><strong>John Orton</strong><br>Lindfield, NSW, Australia</p> <p>\u2022 Congratulations on Amelia Gentleman's piece on the London lap-dancing club. It's useful to be reminded that such things \u2013 which, as we read it, make high claim to present themselves as respectable \u2013 exist. Certainly it is not a unique or even exceptional case of exploitation of women with poor prospects, but it is one case that has <em>pignon sur rue</em> in the centre of London (or western Europe, should you prefer).</p> <p><strong>Marc Jachym</strong><br>Paris, France</p> <p><strong>Threat to peace process</strong></p> <p>Your leader comment is right: having come so far restoring peace after decades of brutal and often atrocious armed struggle on all sides, there is indeed a risk that an \"alienated and dispossessed youth\" in Northern Ireland could \"too easily become a recruiting ground for terror\" in a climate of recession and spending cuts <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/jul/27/editorial-northern-ireland\" title=\"\">(Keep focused, 3 August)</a>.</p> <p>The trouble is that these economic hardships are hitting hard just as the healing process is getting into its stride there. A decade back hopes were high that a better state was at last being created for young people in the north and the mood on this was buoyant.</p> <p>Certainly that was how Martin McGuinness, then education minister in the new power-sharing arrangement, put it to me in Adelaide in 2000. \"Young people,\" he said, had \"come through 30 very bitter years of conflict and this [was] bound to take its toll on them\". He continued: \"Undoubtedly that leads to a sense of insecurity about the political situation and nervousness about it, which is bound to have a detrimental effect in every aspect of their lives. The question now is how we can make politics work and show young people that politics can work for them so that they can place some faith in the democratic process.\"</p> <p>\"These young people,\" McGuinness said, \"have been given hope [by the peace process] and they've never had that before.\"</p> <p>It is this generational recovery \u2013 one that has continued strongly throughout the last decade or so \u2013 that is now being menaced by recession and cutbacks. While this threat remains, a peace process that is progressing well is being undermined and its ultimate success cannot be taken for granted.</p> <p><strong>Terry Hewton</strong><br>Adelaide, South Australia</p> <p><strong>Clientelismo in Sicily</strong></p> <p>Reading Tom Kington's report on Sicily's economic reality was a depressing experience <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jul/21/sicily-bankruptcy-mafia-new-greece?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">(Fears grow for Sicily as bankruptcy looms, 27&#xa0;July)</a>. Kington compares Sicily's bloated civil service (one full-time office staff for every 239 inhabitants) to Lombardy's more reasonable one to 2,500 ratio and points to clientelismo politics as the root cause.</p> <p>Two decades ago, following a 20-year study of Italy's regional government institutions, Robert D Putnam published Making Democracy Work: Civic Traditions in Modern Italy. Putnam found that, in the north, for \"at least 10 centuries\" a multitude of societies, guilds, mutual aid societies, co-operatives and unions fostered \"norms of reciprocity and networks of civic engagement\" resulting in horizontal political relationships. By contrast, Italy's southern regions evolved in the opposite direction, entrenching vertical political relationships.</p> <p>Putnam defines horizontal to mean \"I'll do this for you now, knowing that somewhere down the road you'll do something for me\" and vertical to mean \"I'll do this for you now, if you do that for me now\" \u2013 Kington's clientelismo.</p> <p>Vertical politics, clientelismo, is today's dominant ideology. It is more likely that those who would fix Sicily's problems will achieve little more than to install new clientelismo beneficiaries.</p> <p><strong>Andr\u00e9 Carrel</strong><br>Terrace, British Columbia, Canada</p> <p><strong>Caught in drugs crossfire</strong></p> <p>What steps is the US government taking to reduce the number of drug users in the US? <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jul/15/honduras-human-rights-war-drugs?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">(Ordinary Hondurans get caught up in the crossfire of US war on drugs, 27 July)</a>. Logic suggests that a reduction in the demand would eliminate some suppliers. When a supplier is eliminated, but demand remains constant, the price of the narcotic rises and makes it more profitable for the remaining suppliers.</p> <p>Eliminating the demand would eliminate the employment of those tracking down suppliers, which provides a lifetime occupation for the tracker. Is that the purpose of their actions? Because the demand is not reduced.</p> <p>Of course, eliminating US demand might save the lives of innocent citizens of Honduras, and maybe even some in Mexico.</p> <p><strong>David Cowan</strong><br>Edmonton, Alberta, Canada</p> <p><strong>Advertising as comment</strong></p> <p>I read The classics: with hot bits <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/jul/17/missing-sex-scenes-charlotte-bronte?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">(27 July)</a> with dismay. Not because someone has written erotic additions for the classics \u2013 that is predictable in today's oversexualised society \u2013 but because the Guardian printed what amounts to an advertisement for the publisher as \"comment\". Permitting the selling of a product so thinly disguised is something I am saddened to see.</p> <p>The statement \"Clandestine Classics, risque remakes of classics including Jane Eyre...\" names the company. Claims such as \"The erotic romance titles that I publish are read by an overwhelmingly female audience \u2026\" make me blush for my gender and your paper.

  "<p>It didn't take long for <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/aug/12/paul-ryan-hailed-donations-romney\" title=\"\">Mitt Romney's Republican running-mate, Paul Ryan</a>, to make the kind of impact on us foreigners which will delight his admirers and confirm the bookies' hunch that Barack Obama may well win his second term in November despite an ailing US economy. Just two days on the job and some bright spark has just unearthed Ryan's attack on the NHS.</p> <p>It confirms the impression I got from reading the Fleet St Tory press on Sunday after Romney's introduction of him as \"the next president of the United States\" (whoops). \"Who says Romney is always risk-averse, eh?\" and, \"this will set the contest alight\". It sounded like whistling in the dark to keep conservative spirits up, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/oliver-burkemans-blog/2012/aug/13/conservative-elation-mitt-romney-pick-paul-ryan\" title=\"\">knowing that the choice may well prove a Palin-esque mistake</a>.</p> <p>We can shrug and say that Congressman Ryan doesn't know much about the NHS, either its strengths or weaknesses, so we needn't waste much time on his views. That's true as far as it goes. Very bright (so we keep being told) and charismatic (Mitt needs help in that department), Ryan is an ideologue who would look at a taxpayer-funded healthcare system and condemn it out of hand.</p> <p>That's what he did in the Wall St Journal (proprietor: R Murdoch) in 2009 when he warned that the Obama health plan would put the US on \"a glide path towards European-style socialism\" in which voters would become dependent on government, reluctant to embrace spending cuts which might hit their healthcare.</p> <p>\"We need only look to Great Britain and elsewhere to see the effects of socialised healthcare on the broader economy. Once a large number of citizens get their heathcare from the State (it's always with a capital 'S' among the Ryan crowd), it dramatically alters their attachment to government,\" he wrote.</p> <p>OK, we can follow that and agree with it \u2013 or not.</p> <p>What we do know is that the UK still spends less than 10% of its GDP on healthcare, as do most advanced EU healthcare systems, more or less, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care_in_the_United_States\" title=\"\">while the US spends at least 15%, and probably nearer 17%</a>, a US health executive (private sector) told me recently.</p> <p>Which system its both fairer and more efficient in terms of health outcomes? We all know the answer. Despite the brilliance of its hi-tech medicine and its restless quest for innovation, it's not the US.</p> <p>That's what the great battle over Obama healthcare was all about: to create a system underpinned by compulsory insurance \u2013 nearly 50 million Americans, one in six, are uninsured \u2013 greater efficiency as well as fairness and bear down on costs which benefit doctors, insurance firms and pharmaceuticals, but not US business overall. Health costs are a weighty burden on both employers and staff, the largest single cause of personal bankruptcy.</p> <p>We know all this, don't we? That's where critics of Andrew Lansley's marketisation plan for the NHS \u2013 a bit more competition between the NHS, private and voluntary providers - often get it wrong.</p> <p>Lansley knows what a mess the US system is and doesn't want to copy it. No one does and even pro-market campaigners like <a href=\"http://www.reform.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Reform</a> now cite the low-cost health care innovations being pioneered in places like Mexico and Brazil as examples we might usefully explore.</p> <p>For all his vaunted cleverness I doubt if Paul Ryan knows much about this. Americans are surprisingly insular in many ways, that's why they call their local baseball competition the World Series (although the Toronto Blue Jays are allowed to play). Example? Two from yesterday's FT will do. Columnist Gillian Tett explained that many major American corporations earn most revenue abroad now - 90% of sales are overseas even for Tupperware now \u2013 which helps in a recession, but is bad for US politics. Most CEOs can no longer be bothered with it.</p> <p>And on the same page Kishmore Mahbubani, an academic policy analyst in Singapore, patiently explained why the New York state regulator, Benjamin Lawsky, was wrong to beat up on <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/08/14/us-standardcharted-probe-idUSBRE87C04O20120814\" title=\"\">Standard Chartered Bank the way he did</a>. Right or wrong (probably wrong?) he acted unilaterally (probably for local political reasons) in a world where <em>co-ordinated</em> action between global bank regulators is more vital than ever. It wouldn't occur to Benny that Asian regulators might be unimpressed \u2013 and that their views now count for a lot, his for less.</p> <p>But Paul Ryan is a familiar type in so many ways. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Ryan\" title=\"\">Check out his CV here</a>. Being born in heartland Wisconsin doesn't automatically make him insular. The region's industries have bled badly during globalisation. But he's also a professional politician of the kind conservatives usually like to deplore \u2013 Barack Obama didn't have much of a CV before politics either.</p> <p>Ryan's father died young of heart trouble (there's a family history) which has made him a fitness fanatic, something American health policymakers need to take more seriously than most. He worked his way through college, but also used his late father's state benefits to help out. There ought to be an irony check here, but \u2013 as Obama is already pointing out - Ryan advocates a small state solution while still voting for expensive government programmes. We know the type.</p> <p>Professional politician? Yes, After college in Ohio, where he first encountered Hayek, Friedman, Von Mises and the intoxicating works of Ayn Rand (Alan Greenspan, who presided over the great boom and bust at the Federal Reserve was also a Rand fan), Ryan went straight to work for Wisconsin senator Bob Kasten at just 22.</p> <p>When Kasten lost his seat the same year (1992) Ryan stayed on in Washington \u2013 the wicked capital to Tea Party types \u2013 so he's not the \"Washington outsider\" they claim he is. Within six years \u2013 at 28 \u2013 he was back home (1997) and elected to Congress. He will face his eighth re-election (the law allows it) while running for Veep this autumn. Though he always did part-time jobs, there's a sniff of privilege in that CV, the long-established Ryan family construction business and some political jobs which may have helped him up the ladder. Meritocracy and nepotism are close cousins, as we know.</p> <p>As you've probably read in the past two days Ryan is now chairman of the House of Representatives budget committee, author of the Ryan Plan to shrink the federal government by such devices as a cap on healthcare spending (ironically Medicare for the elderly, Medicaid for the poor, are government programmes that outspend the NHS), a 10% cut in government jobs and a simplified income tax system, 10% and 25% bands to replace the current six.</p> <p>That's a $6tn cut in federal spending over 10 years and would trim everything from roads and airports to student loans, environmental protection and food stamps for the poor \u2013 everything except social security (which is basically benefits and pensions) and defence. Ryan's proposed \"block grant\" system of payment to states running Medicaid would on some estimates cut the numbers entitled to it from 41 million to 27 million.</p> <p>It has prompted the wits to say that Romney, who has flip-flopped on so many issues in his quest for the presidency, has now outsourced his brain. Whatever the candidate says to reassure Middle America that he's not as radical as Ryan, the running mate is the more dynamic figure, the man who brought vast cheering crowds of loyalists out to cheer an astonished Romney in Waukesha, Wisconsin, yesterday.</p> <p>Plenty of Americans see government as the enemy \u2013 and only this year big money funded <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/06/07/after-wisconsin-recall-el_n_1579319.html\" title=\"\">a successful referendum result</a> in Wisconsin to endorse the governor's plans to curb trade union rights, this in a state once famous for progressive welfare reform. There was a <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/global/wisconsin-shooting\" title=\"\">mass shooting at a Sikh temple</a> there only last week. Many people are under pressure and come up with some crazy solutions.</p> <p>One of the more interesting articles on Ryan that I have read claims that he is more of a principled conviction politician than many critics \u2013 or this article \u2013 might suggest.</p> <p>Jacob Weisberg, chairman of the Slate website, has been telling his readers that Ryan's arrival on the ticket will force Americans to consider basic issues they might otherwise be tempted to duck.</p> <p>Thus he would pay for some of his promised tax cuts \u2013 Americans love tax cuts, even when it leads straight to added debts for their children - by eliminating tax deductions. He doesn't say which ones, but that is a recipe for getting more taxes from the rich.</p> <p>Other commentators say that Ryan's arrival allows Obama to switch the election's spotlight from his record, patchy in hard Bush-created times, to what a Romney-Ryan administration might do. Scary stuff.</p> <p>Weisberg's sombre conclusion is that Ryan knows about the hard choices ahead for the US as it seeks to improve its performance in the face of the Chinese ascendancy, that he has a coherent policy which finally starts to make have-it-both-ways conservatives honest as the Democrats are not yet in the quest to make government more affordably efficient.</p> <p>Brutal honesty in election year is a bold option. For that reason Ryan on the ticket probably means a Republican defeat in November. Rupert Murdoch, who likes winners, is backing him. But, as we know, Rupe is fast losing his grip. David Cameron should watch from a safe distance and learn from the Romney-Ryan train crash.</p>",

  "<p>There are themes and gimmicks, bells and whistles in other shows on the fringe, as comics test the boundaries of their art form. But straightforward, autobiographical standup doesn't lose its appeal \u2013 not as long as it's deployed with as much flair as in Sara Pascoe's new show. A star of sitcoms including <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01f87nh\" title=\"\">Twenty Twelve</a>, Pascoe has threatened a great solo show since her 2010 fringe debut \u2013 and delivers here, by sidelining <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/2010/aug/09/sara-pascoe-review\" title=\"\">winsome surrealism</a> and addressing the life she's lived and the things she really cares about.</p> <p>Sara Pascoe the Musical, as the show is called, begins with a scene-setting song; thereafter, one or two punchlines are set to snatches of music. But otherwise, Pascoe's guitar sits unplayed. This is mainly straight standup, with an alternative title \u2013 Adolescence and Images of Women in the Media, Pascoe calls it \u2013 that mightn't have looked so grabby on the poster. But Pascoe has nothing to apologise for. Unlike, say, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/stage/2012/aug/05/rhys-darby-edinburgh-festival-review\" title=\"\">Rhys Darby's childhood tales</a> elsewhere on the fringe, Pascoe's schooldays material has the specificity and idiosyncracy of lived experience, not cliche. And she doesn't let interesting stories get in the way of laughs. There's droll material, say, on the mis-marketing of H\u00e4agen Dazs ice cream, whose real constituency of lachrymose women Pascoe would target with the tagline \"a sweet alternative to suicide\".</p> <p>Throughout, she keeps the routines peppy and smart, inhabiting the mind of her teenage self, and making as if to care about the rivalries and rumours that loom so large on the adolescent landscape. The contrast between sly, metropolitan 30-year-old and naive Essex teen is both amusing and poignant, as Sara's young self covets a boob job, or finds herself betrayed by a boyfriend while singing All Saints songs on a karaoke machine. Her backstory lends authority to Pascoe's material on sexism in the media \u2013 not an unfamiliar subject, but one in need of the spirited critique undertaken here. She's also wonderfully blase about her female/feminist subject matter, joking about her first period in defiance of an unofficial embargo on the subject, and dropping in lines like, \"I then made the difficult decision to put my baby up for abortion\", without explanation or apology.</p> <p>It's all kept light, though, by an unfeigned sense of her own ridiculousness, and the quality and frequency of the jokes. With her best show yet, Pascoe is that rare beast \u2013 a comic with more to say than her time will allow, and a real zest for saying it.</p>",

  "<!-- Block 1 --> <p>12.00pm: Good afternoon. The Guardian's Olympic editor <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/owengibson\">Owen Gibson</a> will be online <strong>from 2pm BST</strong> to take part in a live webchat. </p> <p>Owen took the job as Olympics editor in December 2008 and will continue in the role through for Paralympics, which begin in two weeks' time. If you have any questions for a man who has lived London 2012 for the past three and a half years, drop them into the <strong>comments section below</strong>. </p> <p>In the meantime, here is Owen writing on the unexpected success of the Games: \"<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/aug/12/olympics-success-story\">From tiptop venues to friendly volunteers \u2013 where did it all go right?</a>\"</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It began with fears that venues were sinking into the mud following weeks of rain, serious concerns over whether there would be enough security guards to keep the public safe and the biggest call on the army outside wartime.</p> <p>The reaction to the Olympic torch as it toured the nation had raised the hopes of organisers, but the last-ditch security crisis dented optimism as the volume of public disquiet about the \u00a39.3bn cost to the public purse grew louder.</p> <p>Just over a fortnight later, London's Games ended bathed in sunshine as the country giddily rose to acclaim a host of new sporting heroes amid hopes that it would lead to a new sense of ourselves and \u2014 in the words of a Locog slogan that once seemed cloying but now feels appropriate \u2014 \"inspire a generation\". </p> </blockquote> <!-- Block 2 --> <p>1.57pm: Owen will be along to answer questions soon, but while you're waiting here is his pick of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2012/aug/13/london-2012-guardian-highlights-golden-games\">the best moments of the Games</a>: </p> <p><strong>Mo Farah's 10,000m triumph</strong></p> <blockquote> <p>The first time I entered the Park to be greeted by witty, smiling volunteers and professional, charming soldiers was a big moment \u2013 you realised this was going to work after all. But amid a ludicrously crowded field, the first half of Mo Farah's historic double edges it as a standout sporting memory. You can ladle all the meaning on to it you like \u2013 and the sight and sound of middle England collectively losing its marbles for a Somali-born, west London-raised man of the people was something to behold \u2013 but at its core this was simply an imperious sporting feat. No British man had won the event and there had not been a non-African winner since 1984. Farah tore up the rulebook, working with his American training partner, Galen Rupp, to deal with each surge as it came, refusing to panic and striking for home with supreme confidence at 600m as the noise reached wild levels. The wall of sound in that intimate yet imposing bowl contained a note of disbelief, as if a crowd who had only just seen Jessica Ennis cross the line and Greg Rutherford jump to an unlikely gold could not believe what they were seeing. By the time Farah crossed the line to cap 47 minutes that will go down in British sporting history, there was barely a dry eye in the Olympic Stadium. Unfinished Sympathy, the Massive Attack song that was playing as Farah charged round his final lap, will never sound the same again.</p> </blockquote> <!-- Block 3 --> <p>2.11pm: Owen is now in the comments sections answering questions. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/17679272\"><strong>peteC58</strong></a> starts us off with a question about the lack of Olympic spirit, to which <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/17680335\">Owen replies</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Hello all. Hope you're not feeling too bereft. There's still the Paralympics to look forward to. In answer to @peteC58, glad you had a great Olympics. I agree on your first point. Generally, thought the presentation of the sport was first class and made a real effort to include those who didn't usually follow them without alienating the purists. But it was a shame that they didn't find time to introduce every athlete before every race. Sometimes it was entirely random - the announcers would get halfway through the field and have to stop because the gun was going off.</p> <p>Saw plenty of spontaneity on the podium (what about the Farah/Bolt moment?) but agree that biting your medal is becoming a bit passe. Perhaps we can persuade medal winners to come up with something new for 2016?</p> <p>Supporters from some nations were certainly rowdier than others (the Lithuanians gave particularly loud and well-refreshed backing to their basketball players) but in the main I was struck by how sporting the crowds were. Even when Greg Rutherford was leading the long jump, there were still loud cheers for his opponents. In the team sports (and the boxing arena) the atmosphere was more raucous - but in a good way. Can't comment on that particular incident with the Poles though I'm afraid.</p> </blockquote> <!-- Block 4 --> <p>2.16pm: <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/17680277\"><strong>markgreenwood</strong></a> asks a questions about the fairness of the ticketing process: <strong>\"You say that you think the ticket allocation process was probably the fairest way of distributing tickets I still feel this was the one thing that Locog got completely wrong. Their system encouraged people to bid for far more tickets than they really wanted. It encouraged the rich, the gamblers, the credit-card-junkies to go for broke and commit thousands of pounds. These people were usually rewarded with success, for some, fistfuls of tickets. Their system specifically discouraged anyone who was more careful.\"</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/17680521\">Owen replies</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Compared to a first come, first served system (the only real alternative), I still think a ballot was the best approach for the first batch of ticket sales. Locog have figures that they claim show no one really ended up with fistfuls of tickets - the average successful applicant got four costing \u00a3275.</p> <p>But - and it's a big but - there were many other aspects of the ticketing process they got wrong. There should have been a stricter limit on how many tickets a single applicant could apply for. Ticketmaster's system simply wasn't able to cope with the demand and seemed unnecessarily unwieldy. Many people spent many frustrating hours waiting to be told the tickets they wanted weren't available. Ben Marsh, with his amazing online ticket tracker, managed to do what the world's biggest ticketing company failed to do and find a way of checking which tickets were actually available at any one time.</p> <p>I also feel Locog should have been upfront about roughly how many tickets would be available for each session at each price point. Both the IOC and Locog admit there are lessons to learn from the ticketing process - not least for the way the IOC divides up its tickets between the host, the International Olympic Committees and the sponsors.</p> </blockquote> <!-- Block 5 --> <p>2.22pm: On <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/guardiansport\">Guardian Sport's Facebook page</a> K.k. Kaushik asks when will India have a chance to host the Games.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/17680698\">Owen replies</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>You could ask the same question of the middle east and Africa. The fact the IOC will go to Rio next time, the first ever Olympics in South America, shows it is willing - and keen - to take the Games to new territories. <br>But it was notable that Baku and Doha both dropped off the longlist for 2020 (leaving Istanbul, Tokyo and Madrid) and president Jacques Rogge has a long list of logistical and practical concerns about the middle east.</p> <p>India is an interesting one - the Delhi Commonwealth Games was seen by many as the proof of concept for an Olympic bid, but didn't go so well. A solid bid for 2020 did not materialise. But there is no doubt that in sporting and economic terms it is a huge market - even if Olympic sports are not traditionally very strong. There are also issues around how a bid would be structured and funded. 2024 could be a possibility.</p> </blockquote> <!-- Block 6 --> <p>2.26pm: <strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/17680622\">ExtraConnect</a></strong> asks about the handover between Games: <strong>\"Any idea why the \"Olympic Movement\" do the Olympic handover ceremony at the end of the main Olympics and not after the paralympics?

They then pack up their Louis Vuitton suitcases and leave Park Lane, before the International Paralympic Committee (based in Bonn and headed by Brit in Sir Philip Craven) roll into town.</p> <p>Locog, however, organise both events as an integrated whole - they have been held in parallel with the Olympics since 1988 in Seoul.</p> </blockquote> <!-- Block 7 --> <p>2.29pm: <strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/17680572\">OllyWinkles</a></strong> asks about the TV coverage of future Games: <strong>\"It seems entirely likely that the BBC will not be able to afford rights to broadcast future Olympics.

Since it was not discernable via TV and I didn't attend any live events, I have no strong view, but don't much like the way music has crept into football (e.g. when a goal's scored). What do you think about it?\"</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/17681044\">Owen replies</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It was certainly one of the talking points of the Games for those of us in the stadium. On the first night of athletics action, as Dibaba surged to victory in the women's 10,000m there was extremely loud European dance music playing and it seemed entirely incongruous. Locog admitted they'd got that wrong and turned it down a bit.</p> <p>But, to my own surprise, I found that once they had done so the music actually added to the atmosphere - particularly in morning sessions that are traditionally flat affairs but in London were attended by noisy fans who seemed excited to be there.</p> <p>Not sure Seb, a track and field purist, was massively convinced but most seem to like it. I agree with you about music after goals in the football though - Middlesbrough and Wigan among the worst offenders.</p> </blockquote> <!-- Block 9 --> <p>2.38pm: <strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/17678926\">HarryPalmer42</a></strong> asks about the legacy of the Games and how the media will cover some of the sports that have been popular during the past two weeks: <strong>\"Having seen the public interest in these sports raised over your stint as olympics editor what will your recomendation be to the Guardian senior management in relation to future coverage of the smaller sports? As I fear the back pages and content of the website will soon be Football, Football Football as before.\"</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/17681232\">Owen replies</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It's a very fair question - if largely above my pay grade. There's no doubt that many of those watching (and many of those covering) the Olympics welcomed the respite from the national obsession/sport. It's a simple fact that for many people these sports exist only once every four years, but I agree the media also has a responsibility to provide a spread of coverage. But with the best will in the world, it's going to be hard to find space for sports in which we're unlikely even to qualify in 2016.</p> <p>The likes of rowing, triathlon, taekwondo, equestrian are a slightly different case - it's up to those sports to capitalise on the boost in profile and popularity the Olympics brings and bring their sport to a wider audience. If there is a genuine appetite for coverage (and with web analytic tools we can see exactly how popular different sports are) then we will provide it. Cycling is a good example of a sport that really broke through in Beijing and has capitalised since - there were days during the Tour de France when we filled page after page of the sport section with it, often at football's expense.</p> <p>But for all everyone is slightly down on football at the moment, you can bet that within a fortnight everyone will be back on board with the soap opera.</p> </blockquote> <!-- Block 10 --> <p>2.45pm: <strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/17678736\">mullets</a></strong> is curious about the Olympic village: <strong>\"Were athletes able to come and go freely? Would they be able to leave and go for, say, a meal with their families on an evening? Was there a guest house-like curfew? What about during the day on non-competition days?\"</strong></p> <p>Owen replies:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Athletes could come and go from the Village at will, but individual teams would all have had their own policies regarding curfews etc, especially while still in competition. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/aug/04/london-2012-kim-collins-axed-st-kitts\">Kim Collins fell foul of his team's rules and was barred from competing in the 100m</a>.</p> <p>Team GB officials said their athletes were all disappointingly well behaved. German discus gold medallist Robert Harting, on the other hand, celebrated victory by tearing off his vest and running down the hurdle track. He then got drunk on a German cruise ship moored in Docklands, lost his accreditation, failed to get back into the village and spent the night at a train station. Needless to say he looked a bit sheepish at his medal ceremony the next day.</p> </blockquote> <!-- Block 11 --> <p>2.48pm: <strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/17678670\">AndyMitchell</a></strong> asks about the TV coverage of the Games: <strong>\"Am I being unreasonable or do you agree the Olympic Broadcasting was a bit under par in places?\"</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/17681506\">Owen replies</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Interesting you should say that @AndyMitchell. Although the BBC's coverage was generally widely praised (not that I saw much of it for obvious reasons), there were some grumbles about OBS - the IOC-owned broadcaster that provides the feed. There was a huge row during the cycling road races about their inability to provide split times, making the race difficult to follow (which prompted a blame game between OBS, the BBC and Locog). Neither were the various intricacies of the controversies in the velodrome (most obviously Victoria Pendleton's elimination) made very clear. I suspect it is one of the issues that will form part of the debrief - after Locog did such a good job of presenting the sport in the venues, it was a shame that OBS couldn't always capture that.</p> </blockquote> <!-- Block 12 --> <p>2.52pm: <strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/17678443\">JacksonPollocksNo5</a></strong> wants to know about the volunteers and how many of them were paid: <strong>\"I know of someone who was going to do it (but be paid) but despite being paid for training and getting his uniform etc. was refused to be allowed to do it as he didn't turn 18 until his first day of work.

Likewise Boris's army of 8,000 London Ambassadors (the ones in the garish pink).

There should a final conclusion to the long running saga/fiasco by October. I suspect West Ham will still get the nod, but there is much negotiation still to be done. I agree that it was a fabulous sporting arena. It's likely that the reduction in capacity will come from the addition of hospitality boxes between the two tiers and spacing out some of the remaining seats. But the sight lines and intimate atmosphere that made it so special as an athletics stadium should remain. The sound system sounded great too so it should work for big concerts.

Warships in the Thames, rocket launchers down the road from my house in Oxleas Wood and fighter planes flying overhead in the days before the opening ceremony didn't do much to change perceptions. <br>In the event it didn't feel like that at all. Once hundreds of thousands of people flooded the venues they changed the atmosphere entirely, aided by the brilliant volunteers and - ironically - the 18,000 troops drafted in.

  "<h2>The winner #1: Olympics</h2> <p>The Olympics closing ceremony <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2012/aug/13/olympics-closing-ceremony-tv-ratings\" title=\"\">may have surpassed the more creatively adventurous opening in the UK TV ratings</a>, at least going by viewer averages (23.2m v 23.0m) rather than peak viewers, but it doesn't seem to have impacted the box office more than the event has in general. Sunday takings for top film <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/148370/ted\" title=\"\">Ted</a> were only marginally behind Friday, and were ahead on Sunday in the case of runnerup title <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/141046/dark-knight-rises\" title=\"\">The Dark Knight Rises</a>. For family films such as <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/146821/brave\" title=\"\">Brave</a>, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/148325/ice-age-4\" title=\"\">Ice Age 4: Continental Drift</a> and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/148521/dr-seuss-the-lorax\" title=\"\">Dr Seuss' The Lorax</a>, which are not reliant on late-evening showtimes, Sunday offered the best of the three days' takings. Overall, the Olympics almost certainly negatively impacted all films in the market, with Saturday evening offering the tempting alternative of Mo Farah winning the men's 5,000m final (12.9m viewers at peak) and Tom Daley competing in the men's 10m diving (15.9m). The sunny skies can't have helped, either.</p> <p>The threat of the Olympics finale saw Universal hold off releasing <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/147726/bourne-legacy\" title=\"\">The Bourne Legacy</a> until Monday 13 August (it opened Friday 10 August in the US), and Disney likewise kept Brave back until 13 August for cinemas in England and Wales. Those two decisions must have removed several million in grosses from the market, although this also made life a little easier for existing titles.</p> <p>Cineworld opted to engage in some brand-burnishing activity around the Olympics, offering free live screenings of the opening and closing ceremonies at 27 venues, as well as of selected events. Admission figures are not available.</p> <h2>The winner #2: Ted</h2> <p>Top film was once again Ted, with an amazing \u00a317.21m after just 12 days. For a non-animated, non-sequel comedy that isn't based on an existing property, that's a record amount. The Hangover stood at \u00a37.72m after two weekends of play, and Bridesmaids \u00a37.92m. Men in Black previously held the record in this category, with \u00a315.67m after two weekends, an 11-day figure. Love Actually is close behind, with \u00a315.12m after two weekends. Top result for a live-action comedy, including sequels and titles based on established characters, is The Inbetweeners Movie, with \u00a325.86m after 12 days.</p> <p>Seth Macfarlane's film dropped 47% from the previous weekend. More impressive than its \u00a33.17m weekend total is the \u00a37.88m it's added over the past seven days. As a 15-certificate title, the film doesn't benefit from the big boost in weekday daytime traffic experienced by family pictures during the school holidays, but is nevertheless proving a strong midweek performer.</p> <h2>The loser</h2> <p>Despite being the top new release, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/146748/step-up-4\" title=\"\">Step Up 4: Miami Heat</a> represents a significant disappointment for distributor Universal, with an opening number that signals the end for this lucrative mini-boom in street-dance films. The flashmob-themed dance drama debuted with \u00a3680,000, as against \u00a32.02m for Step Up 3D and \u00a32.36m for Step Up 2: The Streets. The genre was already looking shaky when StreetDance 2 kicked off with a lacklustre \u00a3608,000 earlier this year, as against \u00a32.49m (including previews of \u00a3701,000) for the original StreetDance film in 2010. Now similar numbers for Step Up 4 suggest that audience interest in dance films has contracted to about one third of levels witnessed as recently as two years ago. Further sequels are still just about possible, but only with a lower investment in production and marketing spend, and studios will be wary of further erosion of audience base. Instead, expect the dance genre to take a new direction.</p> <h2>Battle of the giants</h2> <p>With \u00a346.26m after four weeks of play, The Dark Knight Rises continues to mount a strong challenge to Avengers Assemble as the top film of 2012. Marvel's superhero team-up stood at \u00a344.98m at the equivalent stage of its run, on its way to a total of \u00a351.84m. The Dark Knight took bang-on \u00a349m, and the trilogy closer will have no trouble surpassing that total. Over the past seven days, The Dark Knight Rises has overtaken seven pictures in the all-time rankings \u2013 in ascending order, Bridget Jones's Diary, Alice in Wonderland, Toy Story 2, Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, The Inbetweeners Movie, The King's Speech and Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban \u2013 and now stands in 24th place, just behind Jurassic Park.</p> <h2>The arthouse market</h2> <p>Arthouse pickings were slim, with Jo Nesbo's <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/148123/jackpot\" title=\"\">Jackpot</a> and the starry but indifferently reviewed <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/143056/360\" title=\"\">360</a> among the under-performers (see \"Other openers\", below). The value of creating an event around a release is amply demonstrated by the case of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/101744/lodger\" title=\"\">The Lodger</a>. Hitchcock's 1927 silent film was presented three weeks ago with a live Nitin Sawhney score, followed by a Q+A with the composer, <a href=\"http://www.barbican.org.uk/music/event-detail.asp?ID=12875\" title=\"\">beamed from London's Barbican</a> to 10 additional cinemas nationwide. The \u00a323,700 generated from that event is now added to the rerelease's official opening weekend tally, boosting it to over \u00a330,000.</p> <p>Significant previews also push documentary <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/145819/ai-weiwei\" title=\"\">Ai Weiwei: Never Sorry</a> to nearly \u00a331,000. Overall, the arthouse market this summer has really lacked a Coco Before Chanel (\u00a32.62m) or La Vie En Rose (\u00a31.63m). Top foreign language title (excluding Bollywood) is A Royal Affair, with \u00a3360,000.</p> <h2>The future</h2> <p>Thanks to a dearth of commercially appealing new releases, the market overall is 54% down on the previous weekend, and also 49% down on the equivalent frame from last year, when Rise of the Planet of the Apes and The Smurfs both arrived to heat up the box office. Next weekend should be a different story, since The Bourne Legacy's Monday-to-Thursday takings will all be added into its weekend tally, and ditto for Brave's haul from English and Welsh cinemas. Joining the fray are <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/148845/expendables-2\" title=\"\">The Expendables 2</a> and British romcom <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/148837/wedding-video\" title=\"\">The Wedding Video</a>. Alternatives include Michelle Williams and Seth Rogen in Sarah Polley's <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/143110/take-this-waltz\" title=\"\">Take this Waltz</a>. The market will need all the help it can get in its battle to match the equivalent weekend from 2011: that's when The Inbetweeners Movie made its record-pulverising debut.</p> <h2>Top 10 films</h2> <p><strong>1.</strong> <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/148370/ted\" title=\"\">Ted</a>, \u00a33,174,766 from 513 sites.

  "<p>Nearly 10 million more tourists should be visiting the UK from overseas by the end of this decade under plans to capitalise on the Olympic Games announced by Jeremy Hunt.</p> <p>The culture secretary used what was billed as a keynote speech on tourism to announce record-breaking figures for visits to the UK and spending by tourists this year. He said reports from hotels, well known shopping areas, theatres and the credit card company Visa all showed increased business during the Games.</p> <p>To ensure the interest stimulated by the Olympics and associated events, such as the torch relay and the Cultural Olympiad, continued, Hunt announced another \u00a310m funding for tourism campaigns in the UK and China.</p> <p>He said he had asked for a feasibility study into the idea of a biennale arts festival for London or the UK, similar to the famous event in Venice every two years.</p> <p>The target was to increase overseas visitors from just over 30m a year to 40m a year by 2020, Hunt told an audience at the Tate Modern gallery in London.</p> <p>\"The Olympics should be for Britain what Usain Bolt is for athletics \u2013 something that grabs the attention of the whole world and refuses to let it go,\" he said.</p> <p>\"We must use this extraordinary year to turbo-charge our tourism industry. To create jobs and prosperity on the back of a globally enhanced reputation. And to show that when we talk about Olympic legacy, tourism is an opportunity we seized and ran with all the way to the finishing line.\"</p> <p>Of the \u00a310m announced, \u00a32m was for the Holiday at Home campaign aimed at encouraging people to make more trips and holidays in the UK.</p> <p>The remaining \u00a38m would be targeted at the Chinese market, where the UK ranks low compared with other European countries for visits, and where the ranks of the middle class, who could potentially afford such a holiday, are booming, Hunt said.</p> <p>\"Through this new campaign, I want us to treble the number of Chinese visitors we attract, getting to 500,000 by 2015.\" He said meeting that target would create 14,000 jobs and generate more than \u00a3500m a year in extra visitor spending.</p> <p>The relatively modest sums follow \u00a31bn of government money pledged to support the \"Great\" tourist advertising and marketing campaign at ahead of the Olympics.</p> <p>The culture secretary could not help indulging in some light-hearted rivalry with one of the more successful tourist destinations: Hunt said his favourite stunt pulled off by the \"Great\" campaign was a billboard outside the Louvre museum in Paris boasting that, unlike the home of Leonardo da Vinci's Mona Lisa painting, the British Museum was free to enter.</p>",
  "<p>The UK's Olympic weather is set to take its leave along with the remaining athletes, as unsettled conditions surround a band of heavy rain moving in from the Atlantic.</p> <p>Warm temperatures will continue, however, and there is the prospect of a finer and more settled spell returning in time for the Paralympics, which start on 29 August.</p> <p>Inured to a summer barely deserving of the name, thousands of fetes and festivals should overcome the worst of the weather, thanks to the UK's famously changeable meteorology. Even the worst day on this week's forecast, Wednesday, offers almost everything from sunny spells to gales and heavy rain.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/weather/uk/uk_forecast_weather.html\" title=\"\">Meteorological Office</a> has flagged up a yellow \u2013 or \"be aware\" \u2013 alert for a large lozenge on its UK map, stretching north in a largely straight line from the Devon-Dorset border to the Lake District. Everywhere to the west of this should be prepared for heavy rain and \u2013 especially in the south-west \u2013 gales, which could cause damage. Yellow is the third most serious of the Met Office's four weather warnings.</p> <p>Thunderstorms will continue for the remainder of the week, in familiar summer fashion, with dramatic spectacles of largely sheet lightning in their wake. The forecast to the weekend says: \"Remaining windy on Thursday, with sunshine and showers. Less windy, but further occasionally heavy rain likely on both Friday and Saturday. Generally humid, especially in the south-east. Warm nights continuing.\"</p> <p>The Met Office said of the longer term: \"As we move towards the end of August, it looks like remaining unsettled in all areas, but with some short-lived drier and brighter periods. Daytime temperatures by this stage largely around average or a little below, with the best chance of occasional above-average temperatures in the south-east.\"</p> <p>Bad weather in the <a href=\"http://www.cairngormmountain.org/\" title=\"\">Cairngorms</a> in Scotland led to a helicopter operation on Ben Macdui, a peak second only in the UK to Ben Nevis at 1,309 metres (4,295ft), when 14 hillwalkers were guided to safety by mountain rescue teams from Aberdeen and Braemar and officers from Grampian police.

  "<p>Promising players, low-level doubts, patchy wins marked by moments of excellence, swelling hope, and then a crash against the first decent side they came up against. Brazil's Olympics ended in disappointment and, as the frustration of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2012/aug/11/mexico-olympic-football-gold-brazil\" title=\"\">their defeat to Mexico in the final clears</a>, so the post-mortem begins. Brazil were desperate to win Olympic gold for the first time but, with the Confederations Cup representing their only competitive football between now and the start of their World Cup they are hosting in 2014, it was also about preparation.</p> <p>The evidence is contradictory. On the one hand, Brazil are clearly blessed with a highly gifted generation. If home advantage proves a spur rather than an intolerable pressure, that may be enough to carry them to a sixth world title. But the Olympics also exposed the flaw at the heart of Brazilian football, the tension that threatens constantly to bring them down.</p> <p>As Tim Vickery explains in <a href=\"http://www.theblizzard.co.uk/product/issue-six-print/\" title=\"\">Issue Six of The Blizzard (out September)</a>, Brazilian football changed in the 70s. Part of the justification for the military coup in 1964 was the appointment of \"technocrats\" to run the economy and counter rampant inflation. The desire for bureaucratic experts seeped into other areas, including football. There was a desire to measure and to control, a movement that received a boost after the 1974 World Cup when Holland exposed the flaws of the South American style by thrashing Argentina and Uruguay and then beating Brazil with a highly systematised approach. From that moment, the men with the clipboards took over.</p> <p>There was a reversion to the old, individualistic style under Tel\u00ea Santana at the 1982 World Cup \u2013 and to an extent in 1986 \u2013 but thereafter the technocrats have held the upper hand. It's won two World Cups and led Brazil to another final, while radically improving their record in the Copa Am\u00e9rica: until 1997 (in part, it's true, because they hadn't taken the tournament particularly seriously) Brazil had never won the Copa Am\u00e9rica on foreign soil; they went on to win four of the next five.</p> <p>Vickery argues that, contrary to stereotype, Brazil cares more than most places about winning. The defeat to Uruguay in the final game of the 1950 World Cup is still seen as a national catastrophe. Attendance figures fluctuate wildly according to the form of club sides. Success, though, hasn't brought Brazil much love; there's still a harking back to the verve that brought three World Cups between 1958 and 1970. Dunga, having won a Copa Am\u00e9rica and a Confederations Cup, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2010/jul/04/world-cup-2010-dunga-brazil\" title=\"\">was bundled out of the manager's job</a> for one bad half in the World Cup, largely because his approach was seen as somehow inimical to Brazilian football's self-image.</p> <p>\"Today football is made by technocrats, but also by commerce and marketing,\" <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/blog/2012/jul/12/emerson-leao-ney-franco\" title=\"\">said Emerson Le\u00e3o</a>, who saw the change of emphasis as Brazil's goalkeeper at the 1974 and 1978 World Cups. \"It's not about romance. What is a technocrat? Somebody who learned from a teacher in college or from a computer and not from the field. Now I'm going to tell you the Brazilian disaster: in the junior section of many professional teams the coaches are 100% technocrats. The president of the team believes in those people, because they come and present a wonderful training plan. Maybe they don't present things harshly as I would. These are the technocrats who appeal to the marketing types. But you have to know how to handle the players; to use psychology.\"</p> <p>A generation has grown up watching Nike adverts showing carefree men with questionable hair-cuts freestyling through airports, cityscapes and prison ships and wondering how that equates to Dunga and C\u00e9sar Sampaio, or Edmilson and Gilberto Silva, or Z\u00e9 Roberto and Gilberto Silva, or Felipe Melo and Gilberto Silva, sitting doggedly in front of the back four. Nike's advertising hasn't created the contradiction that lies at the heart of Brazilian football culture, but it has highlighted it, perhaps even accentuated it.</p> <p>Neymar, poor, overhyped, brilliant Neymar, is compelled to do tricks. It's not enough that his team wins; he must also perform individual miracles and live up to the advertisers' ideal. It is his misfortune to live in the age of an Argentinian genius: he must also confirm to Brazilians with every breath that he is as good, or at least may soon become as good, as Lionel Messi. Pel\u00e9's pursuit of the line that they are equals not merely confirms his debased status as a pundit, but is actually counter-productive, heaping pressure on Neymar and deflecting attention from far more significant issues.</p> <p>The twin pressures on the Brazilian game have resulted in a style of football that recalls Arrigo Sacchi's description of Real Madrid in the galacticos era: it is full of specialists. There are those who dribble and run and shoot, and there are those who sit back and fill the spaces to allow them to do so. It's simplistic and effective against weaker opposition, but vulnerable to more streetwise opponents: even before Mexico beat them, Brazil had stuttered against <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2012/jul/26/brazil-egypt-football-london-2012\" title=\"\">Egypt</a> and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2012/aug/04/london-2012-brazil-honduras-quarter-final\" title=\"\">Honduras</a>, before being extraordinarily fortunate against South Korea, who should have had two penalties in the semi-final. It also explains why so many of Brazil's holding midfielders are tacklers and distributors like Lucas or shuttlers like Ramires, and so few of them deep-lying creators in the way Falc\u00e3o or Gerson once were.</p> <p>As football elsewhere becomes increasingly about universality, about players being able to perform a multiplicity of roles, it also feels like an old-fashioned style. Old and new came together a year ago today in Pereira, Colombia, in the quarter-final of the Under-20 World Cup. Spain, with their systematised approach, held the ball, passed and passed, worked players into positions and twice scored from crosses from overlapping full-backs. Brazil, thanks largely to the individual excellence of Oscar, Willian, Henrique and Duda, also scored twice, then won on penalties. The quality of their forwards was not in doubt, but it felt like a smash-and-grab. Brazil went on to win the tournament but Spain had been the best side.</p> <p>High-class individuals are not enough, as Brazil found at the Copa Am\u00e9rica last year. Neymar and Ganso were both given their head there and both found it hard to deal with the sort of tough, tight defending they simply they don't experience in Brazil. Brazil failed to beat Paraguay twice and Venezuela before going out in the quarter-final. It wasn't so much that defenders went in hard, but that the willingness of opposing defences to press and close down space in a way that was unfamiliar to them, while referees were far less generous in awarding free-kicks for minimal contact. The frustration the Brazilian coaching staff showed to Mark Clattenburg and his officials in Saturday's Olympic final was another manifestation of that, as Brazil ended up, again and again, dribbling down blind alleys as they were denied to time to measure passes.</p> <p>The far bigger problem was Mano Menezes's baffling decision to start, as he had in the semi-final against South Korea, with Alex Sandro rather than Hulk. Perhaps it was an attempt to bridge the gap between the back and front of midfield, perhaps it was born of a fear of Neymar's reluctance to track the opposing right-back (Oh Jae-suk in the case of South Korea; Israel Jim\u00e9nez in the case of Mexico), but it left Brazil hopelessly unbalanced, with Romulo and Oscar forced to drift right to try to fill the space in front of Rafael. As Rupert Fryer pointed out, it was the lack of anybody ahead of him on that right flank that cost Brazil the first goal, as the Manchester United full-back was forced to turn inside and then underhit his pass to Sandro.</p> <p>In terms of personnel, Brazil look reasonably well placed in their preparations for 2014. A front four of Neymar, Oscar, Hulk and Leandro Dami\u00e3o offers a blend of pace, power and individual skill, knitted together by the vision of Oscar. Lucas and Ramires, while neither is a great long-range passer, will protect the back four. Marcelo on the left and Dani Alves or Maicon on the right are as good an attacking full-back pairing as exists at the moment. Thiago Silva needs a partner at centre-back (Juan? Dede? David Luiz?) and there are serious problems in goal, where J\u00falio C\u00e9sar is in decline and there are no obvious candidates to replace him.</p> <p>Most sides, though, would be delighted to have such a nucleus of players already in place. Brazil's problem is to reconcile them to one unifying philosophy.</p>",
  "<p>A few weeks ago, a picture showing hundreds of dark-skinned men splayed across a beach was passed around on Facebook. The men appeared to be either asleep, or more likely, dead. They lay against each other, their faces averted from the camera, while men in fatigues holding semi-automatic weapons towered over them. The caption read: \"Continuity of massacre of Muslims of Burma by Buddhists. More than 1,000 killed yesterday. Please share.\"</p> <p>After some probing, the photograph <a href=\"http://blogs.tribune.com.pk/story/12867/social-media-is-lying-to-you-about-burmas-muslim-cleansing/\" title=\"\">turned out to be a fake</a>. But all fabrications aside, there actually is a bona fide crisis unfolding along the Burma and Bangladesh border \u2013 despite the poppycock on social media, the sham did raise questions that traditional media have largely ignored.</p> <p>Violence between Buddhists and Rohingya Muslims in Burma's Rakhine region erupted in June after the <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-18395788\" title=\"\">alleged rape and murder</a> of a Buddhist girl by Muslim men. The scale of violence has led to scores of deaths and the <a href=\"http://www.hrw.org/news/2012/07/31/burma-government-forces-targeting-rohingya-muslims-0\" title=\"\">mass displacement of tens of thousands of people</a>. After a state of emergency was declared in the province, the entry of Burma's security forces lent another dimension to this conflict. Amnesty International <a href=\"http://www.amnesty.org/en/news/myanmar-rohingya-abuses-show-human-rights-progress-backtracking-2012-07-19\" title=\"\">said in early August</a> that Rakhine Buddhists, together with security forces, purposefully meted out devastating violence against the Muslim minority.</p> <p>This violence is only the latest chapter in a long history of state-sponsored repression against the Rohingya. It began when Burma began its project of \"Burmanisation\" in the 1950s, with its lofty aims for racial purity and the nationalisation of resources following the end of British rule. The minority was targeted in pogroms in 1978, <a href=\"http://www.nst.com.my/opinion/columnist/suu-kyi-must-not-ignore-the-rohingya-1.122681\" title=\"\">stripped of their citizenship in 1982</a> and became the perfect foil for rampant human rights abuse, including slave labour and torture, that <a href=\"http://www.opendemocracy.net/ishak-mia-sohel/plight-of-rohingyas-in-myanmar-international-community-and-aung-sung-suu-kyi_\" title=\"\">led to a second exodus into Bangladesh</a> in 1991-1992.</p> <p>But not only are the Rohingya a disenfranchised people, they are dark-skinned Muslims with little relevance, representation and significance to anyone. Unable to deal with a matter the much-vaunted Nobel peace laureate Aung San Suu Kyi has not endorsed, the western world has tiptoed around the issue. Aung San Suu Kyi's silence is evidently an attempt to placate her constituency ahead of general elections in 2015, and to criticise her now would be like admonishing Nelson Mandela in the run-up to the 1994 election in South Africa. But unlike South Africa in the 1990s, Burma is not on the verge of some tremendous political shakeup; while the Rohingya are being sacrificed as collateral damage in the greater project of the democratisation of Burma, Aung San Suu Kyi is missing an extraordinary opportunity to live up to her reputation.</p> <p>Meanwhile, in that parallel universe known as the \"Muslim world\", the Rohingyas have joined Palestine, Kashmir, Iraq and Afghanistan on the list of flagship Muslim causes. In a region that is home to the world's greatest concentration of Muslims, the delayed reaction of neighbouring Indonesia, Malaysia and Brunei is startling. Last week, Bangladesh, another Muslim country, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-19125916\" title=\"\">ordered three NGOs</a> to stop providing food and other humanitarian assistance to Rohingyas in the border area, claiming it did not want to encourage more asylum seekers to its shores. Already 40,000 unregistered Rohingyas live in makeshift camps in Bangladesh, and <a href=\"http://www.unhcr.org/pages/49e487546.html\" title=\"\">according to the UN Refugee Agency</a>, the latest violence will result in a greater influx of people \u2013 whether Bangladesh likes it or not.</p> <p>While Burma's Muslim neighbours struggle to respond, Saudi Arabia has thrown money at the problem. It has fallen to Turkey to <a href=\"http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/fm-davutoglu-pledges-to-help-rohingya-muslims.aspx?pageID=238&amp;nID=27556&amp;NewsCatID=338\" title=\"\">act decisively</a> by further extending its newly found benevolence to the Islamic world. As images of the Turkish prime minister's wife <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MEfniqNel0g&amp;feature=player_embedded&amp;fb_source=message\" title=\"\">sobbing</a> as she witnessed the effects of the violence herself begin to be passed around online \u2013 further cementing the Rohingya cause to the long list of Muslims' suffering \u2013 Muslim prayers have bemoaned the global silence as proof of the grand conspiracy against Islam. And yet little is being done by Muslims to actually reverse the treatment of their purported brethren themselves.</p> <p>It all makes for a rather disempowering picture, but it doesn't have to. Given how fast a fake picture can spread its way across the world, imagine what we could do with a little engagement.</p>",
  "<p>\"When I heard about giving birth in a hospital on Radio Sila, it was the first time anyone suggested that to me,\" says 37-year-old Achta Abakar Ibrahim, a Darfur refugee and mother of 10. She sits in the shade of her compound in Djabal camp, near Goz Be\u00efda, eastern Chad, plaiting the hair of her four-year-old daughter, Malia.</p> <p>\"My first six children I had at home, and although \u2013 thanks to God \u2013 I didn't have any serious problems, it was just so much easier in the hospital,\" she says. \"There, they know what can go wrong, and that made me so much more confident.\"</p> <p>Radio Sila is one of three radio stations \u2013 the other two are Absoun in Iriba and Voix de Ouaddai in Abeche \u2013 which were set up in 2005 and 2006 by the international media development charity <a href=\"http://www.internews.org/\" title=\"\">Internews</a>. Now, similar stories to Ibrahim's can be heard in many of the 12 camps dotted along Chad's border with Sudan, home to 265,000 people displaced by conflict in Darfur, or in the host villages that welcomed them.The stations use a mix of targeted social action programmes and innovations on a range of subjects, often those considered taboo in local communities. These have included interactive phone-ins and discussions to provide information, and a communications channel between refugees and aid agencies.</p> <p>\"People talk much more openly on the radio. They listen to each other and learn from each other's experience,\" says Nalga Katir, who organised a debate on female genital mutilation, sponsored by the UN Population Fund, in the refugee camps. \"They're just a voice on the radio, so it allows them to debate in a way they would be afraid to face-to-face, and then you see after the programme people are sitting in the shade of a tree still discussing it.\"</p> <p>However, despite the fact that almost none of the Darfuris are returning home, funding for refugee projects in the region is getting harder to come by \u2013 and the radio stations are no exception. Internews pulled out at the end of July. Formal training on management matters and revenue generation was given to local journalists, who had been trained by the organisation, before it left, and the stations are now in the process of transforming into independent community radio associations.</p> <p>Money will be an enormous challenge. Radio Voix de Ouaddai has projected a budget of $60,000 for the year ahead, an enormous sum in a country where a journalist's average wage is $150 a month. Advertising revenues are few and far between, as a culture of publicity has yet to take off in Chad, particularly in the isolated villages of the east. So how will they do it?</p> <p>\"We will start charging for services which used to be free before,\" says Abdelzerak Arabi, manager of Radio Sila. \"For example, a government notice will be 5,000CFA ($10), or a notice about a death or [a] funeral will be 1,000CFA ($2).\"</p> <p>It's hoped that a core funding grant from the UN Development Programme will also materialise, which promises $250,000 to the radio stations for the next year, and about 15 journalists have agreed to work for free in the meantime.</p> <p>Money aside, Chad still presents unique difficulties to journalists. Although media regulations and laws have been significantly relaxed in recent years, in 2008 a number of journalists were arrested after rebel attacks on the capital, N'Djamena. There are problems with electricity supply, repairing equipment and poor roads, and many people in Chad are reluctant to talk to journalists. There are just 34 radio stations in the whole country; in Iriba and Goz Be\u00efda, there was no other media at all before Internews arrived.</p> <p>But it seems the Internews stations have made huge strides in achieving the ultimate objective of a community radio station \u2013 to become valued and loved by the people they serve.\"What I like about the radio journalists is they go and look with their own eyes, and then talk about what's happening. I trust that they verify the story before they publish,\" says Mohammed Ali Ismael Zidane, in a market in Goz Be\u00efda.</p> <p>Whether that love of radio can translate into tangible support for the teams in Abeche, Goz Be\u00efda and Iriba is a big question, but for now at least there is a will to survive.</p> <p>\"I love being a journalist, it's the best job in the world,\" says Madjihinguem Nguinabe, a Radio Sila journalist who's agreed to work for free. \"I will give everything I have, from the training and [the] knowledge, all my energy and spirit to keep this station running.\"</p>"
