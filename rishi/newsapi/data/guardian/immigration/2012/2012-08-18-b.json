  "<p> A Kenyan man who was paralysed after being shot by carjackers nine years ago has caught the imagination of the nation by embarking on a 2,485-mile journey to South Africa on a manual wheelchair to seek treatment for his spinal injuries. Zachary Kimotho, a 44-year-old veterinarian, began the journey in June with the aim of raising \u00a31.9m to build a spinal injury treatment unit in the Kenyan capital, Nairobi.</p> <p>On the first phase of his journey, Kimotho raised \u00a3650,000 and covered 78 miles of the route to South Africa, where the nearest spinal cord injury rehabilitation centre is. In a telephone interview on Friday with the <em>Observer</em>, Kimotho, who was near the border of Tanzania and Kenya, said he had continued despite cold and wet weather and he had blisters on his hands from turning the wheels.</p> <p>\"It has been a very cold season in Kenya and I also have to contend with speeding motorists. I have faced so many challenges but I don't want them to deter me from the goal,\" he said.</p> <p>Kimotho was selected in June to be the face of the campaign organised by the <a href=\"http://www.kenyanparaplegic.or.ke/\" title=\"\">Kenyan Paraplegic Organisation</a> to raise awareness of the suffering of spinal injury patients in Kenya. They appealed for the public to help <a href=\"http://www.bringzackbackhome.com/\" title=\"\">\"Bring Zack Back Home\"</a>, urging Kenyans to each contribute a Kenyan shilling (about a penny) in the hope that enough money would be raised to build the unit, saving Kimotho from having to complete his arduous journey. Kenyans took to social media to spread the word and the hashtag #BringZackBackHome became a top trend on Twitter.</p> <p>Kimotho was paralysed in 2004 after he was shot in his car in Nairobi. \"All of a sudden, a vehicle stopped in front of me and through the windscreen, I could see a man raising both hands. Momentarily, I thought I had caused an accident,\" he said. A man with a gun then told him to open the door and to move to the passenger seat. He then felt a sharp pain in his shoulder. \"A bullet pierced through my shoulder, through my spine all the way to the other shoulder,\" he said.</p> <p>Kimotho was in Kenyatta National Hospital for three months. Six months before the incident his wife had died, leaving him to bring up their son, now 10, alone. He had also lost his job as a vet a few months before. When he was discharged he was in a wheelchair, but he believes that his circumstances would have been greatly different had he received better care. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2012/aug/08/kenyan-dangerous-drivers-twitter-roads\" title=\"\">With 20,000 people injured in road accidents each year</a>, the spinal injury wing of the Kenyatta hospital is overstretched. Kimotho now hopes to help others avoid his fate. \"I would like other spinal injury patients to benefit from proper treatment and rehabilitation \u2013 treatment I never got,\" he said.</p> <p>But Kimotho's journey has now been halted by bureaucracy. \"We had to stop because we had [only] applied for a [fundraising] licence of 60 days,\" he said. The Kenyan Paraplegic Organisation has acquired 12 acres of land in Nairobi to build the new spinal care unit. \"In early September, we'll lay a foundation with the amount raised so far for all to see how their money has been spent. Then we'll launch phase two of the initiative,\" Kimotho said.</p>",
  "<p>Singing pop songs has turned into something of an arms race of late. Thanks in no small part to the bear pit of TV talent shows, female singers are now required to holler louder, longer and more fiercely than the next girl; their notes need to bend more ways than a wrestler in a torture chamber. \"Smashing it\" is the grail \u2013 a display of firepower, not restraint; a surfeit of heat, to the detriment of nuance.</p> <p>Jessie Ware, 27, from Brixton, is different. Having spent the past couple of years appearing on a number of tracks by post-dubstep types \u2013 she sang three tracks on SBTRKT's celebrated debut album last year \u2013 Ware is about to release her own debut, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2012/aug/16/jessie-ware-devotion-album-stream\" title=\"\"><em>Devotion</em></a>. She can smash it, but chooses not to. There are moments during tonight's lean, hungry headline set \u2013 40 minutes, no encore \u2013 where Ware holds a big note then whips her head away from the microphone, pulling back from the overkill. It happens on <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XFju_Ngws4\" title=\"\">Running</a>, the last song in the set, and earlier, on <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tE9LV05L13s\" title=\"\">No to Love</a>, greeted by whoops each time. The appreciative crowd crammed into this small Brixton club is probably divided 70/30 between fans and her friends and family. Her mum hasn't bought all the tickets this time, Ware grins, but her friend Phil has brought the entire bridge club along.</p> <p>Ware's <em>Devotion</em> comes out on Monday 20 August, and it replaces the fancy vocal vaulting de nos jours with a more glacial glide through British R&amp;B, pop, soul and electronic music that owes far more to Sade than it does Adele (a friend of Ware's). You would not know it to hear her, but Ware went to school with Florence Welch, Jack Pe\u00f1ate and Maccabee Felix White.</p> <p>Fellow south Londoner Katy B is more of a musical fellow traveller. Both she and Ware came up putting vocals on tracks with the swishy rattle of drum'n'bass or the judder of dubstep beneath them, before turning their aerated voices to bold pop. Sampha \u2013 another incumbent British soul voice \u2013 joins Ware on stage for two tracks tonight, the compelling, SBTRKT-produced vulnerable duet <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2M6VItZtAh4\" title=\"\">Valentine</a> and, less successfully, What You Won't Do for Love.</p> <p>But where Katy B sounds fresh and girlish, despite the hours she puts in clubbing, Ware seems more grown-up, something of a cross between Greek statuary and a glam pub landlady; she was, until fairly recently, a budding journalist on the<em> Jewish Chronicle</em>. Her best songs are downbeat, pregnant with tamped-down feeling. The greatest by far, tonight, is Wildest Moments, a big, forlorn tune about a volatile friendship where Ware's resigned sweetness plays off against the<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMJkddvJ4L4\" title=\"\"> big drums and electronic feints</a>.</p> <p>The debt to Sade is one Ware admits freely, and it's not merely musical. Ware looks immaculate, her bequiffed up-do offset by big earrings and eyebrows sculpted as though by lasers. <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kvlFWmvgeVI\" title=\"\">Her videos</a> are luxe affairs (for now, on a budget) that hark back to the posing 80s, but in a way that doesn't make you cringe.</p> <p>In person, though, Ware is no ice queen. She exhorts the front row to tell her if she gets lipstick on her teeth. She spends time explaining how songs came to be; who they are for. There's one, the slightly too gloomy Taking in Water, for her little brother; another, the slightly too breezy Sweet Talk, that she wrote with Julio Bashmore, a Bristol house DJ-turned-producer who shares credits on <em>Devotion</em> with the Invisible's Dave Okumu. Okumu joins in tonight as well, a big bear of a man whose resemblance to Soul II Soul's Jazzie B is coincidental.</p> <p>But when her band \u2013 a mixed blessing of guitar, bass, drums and electronics \u2013 start up, Ware is transformed. She becomes her bone structure \u2013 elegant, chiselled. Mostly, the songs measure up. <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eblGD5yuid8\" title=\"\">110%</a> retains a little drum'n'bass, but quickly transforms into the kind of brisk pop nugget that reminds you of the run of Scandinavian popstrels five years ago, headed by Robyn. Sometimes, as on Night Light, however, the fug of lounge funk threatens to suck Ware into disposability. The perils ahead are clear. Ware could easily become more soul-pop cannon fodder, just another coo in&nbsp;the churn of singers. To avoid that she&nbsp;needs to stay chilled.</p>",
  "<p>I am eating brilliant brains with two of the best chefs in the world. Yielding, delicious, lightly cooked in a pan. \"So good,\" grins Juan Mari, as we wolf them down. No fine dining this, just simple food, spanking fresh: iridescent red mullet and newborn broad beans; tiny peas, potatoes the size of marbles bought from the market only moments before. Elena, his fellow cook and daughter, is immaculate in whites. \"They are my most comfortable clothing, like pyjamas,\" she smiles, as she checks the lunch menu at <a href=\"http://www.arzak.info/arz_web.php?idioma=En\" title=\"\">Arzak</a>, the restaurant which bears the family name.</p> <p>We eat delicate local anchovies with our fingers, lifting them by the tail. \"Fresh anchovies must be eaten by lunchtime,\" she insists, as we settle to discuss her work, her family, her food.</p> <p>This year, <a href=\"http://www.theworlds50best.com/awards/best-female-chef/\" title=\"\">Elena was named the top female chef</a> in the World's Best 50 Restaurants list, a recognition she says she is proud to accept on behalf of her mother Maite, her aunt Serafina and her grandmother Paquita, who have all helped to make Arzak one of the top 10 places to eat anywhere. The award is also \u2013 though she won't say it \u2013 recognition of a step out from under the shadow cast by the colossus of Basque cooking that is Juan Mari Arzak.</p> <p>You can see the excitement and pride in Elena's eyes when locals rush to give her a hug as we stroll around San Sebasti\u00e1n. They all feel involved in the success of this modest 42-year-old mother of two with a stellar palate who helped bring the avant-garde tastes and textures of the Basque region to the attention of the world.</p> <p>Suppliers shout her name and show off line-caught squid, still flashing like a touch screen and flushing with crimson. One holds a stiff mackerel by the tail and waves it like a sword. Elena points out the sleek sheen on the hake. Not the same, she says, as you get in the UK. \"Here, there are deep pools in the sea with special plankton that make it unique. For us, it is the king of fish, subtle, with finesse, and softly flavoured.\"</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-394943967\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/14/1344947959957/Elena-and-Juan-Mari-admir-001.jpg\" alt=\"Elena and Juan Mari admire bonito at a fish stall in La Bretxa market\" width=\"220\" height=\"138\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Elena and Juan Mari admire bonito at a fish stall in La Bretxa market. Photograph: Pal Hansen for Observer Food Monthly</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Pal Hansen for Observer Food Monthly</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>While Juan M is mobbed by admirers \u2013 it must be like walking around Rome with a popular pope \u2013 Elena quietly stands by, chatting with a fish seller about black monkfish and school (Elena has a daughter, Nora, aged seven, and a son, Mateo, five, \"always awake, like my father\", she laughs). Tenderly, she touches her father's sleeve, whispers a few words, and runs back to buy the live squid for supper. She likes it very finely sliced, dusted with flour and salt, fried till crisp.</p> <p>\"You want a drink?\" beams Juan M, as we stop at a <em>pintxos</em> (Basque tapas) stall in the basement of La Bretxa market. Elena has her third coffee of the day, her father his first glass \u2013 \"doctor's orders, only red wine and champagne,\" he says. We eat bacalao with perfect slippery potato while he explains how to spot hot peppers from sweet. It is all about the white hairs, he says. He can also tell whether a dish has been cooked by a man or a woman, he adds, though here I am less convinced.</p> <p>Juan M is nearing 70 now and hasn't slept in two days, he says, having flown in from Mexico where the family once owned a restaurant. But while Elena and I try to keep up, like children being dragged on a leash by a large dog, he strides ahead to the old town for a plate of his favourite prawns. \"You want a drink?\" he asks, proudly pointing to the \"San Sebasti\u00e1n-style London gin\" he is producing with his friends behind the El Tamboril bar. The prawns \u2013 <em>gambas a la gabardina</em> [in a raincoat] \u2013 come wrapped in an ethereal batter. Shopping finished, we take a car to the restaurant to talk and eat, until suddenly Juan M calls a stop for chorizo. \"You want a drink?\" he smiles, eyes sparkling, almost innocently.</p> <p>Elena and her father's lives mirror each other in many ways. They both discovered their love for cooking in their school holidays. They both studied with the great chefs of their day \u2013 Juan M in France with Paul Bocuse, the Troisgros brothers and Alain Senderens; Elena with Alain Ducasse, Ferran Adr\u00eca and Pierre Gagnaire. But, more importantly, they've both been shaped by cooking in the San Sebasti\u00e1n restaurant their family has owned for 115 years.</p> <p>Paquita took over the kitchen at Arzak on the death of her husband when Juan M was nine. \"He was an only child surrounded by women, in a matriarchy,\" says Elena. \"I think that is why he idolises women now.\"</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-394943968\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/14/1344948191054/Arzak-restaurant-001.jpg\" alt=\"Arzak restaurant\" width=\"220\" height=\"121\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Arzak restaurant.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\"The restaurant was different then,\" he adds. \"Our bedroom opened on to the dining room, there was my mother, my grandmother among five cooks, not the 30 now, serving traditional food. But I was very happy.\"</p> <p>By the time Elena was chopping vegetables as a child, Juan M was maybe the most important chef in Spain, famed for the revolutionary <em>nueva cocina vasca</em> he helped create with fellow San Sebasti\u00e1n chef Pedro Subijana.</p> <p>Like her father before her, she cherishes her time as a child in the kitchen. \"We were only allowed to work for two hours a day in the holidays,\" she says. \"I always wanted to stay longer. I adored being there with my sister, my mother, my grandmother, my aunt, my family.</p> <p>\"My mother was in my father's shadow,\" she says softly. \"It was harder for women then, but I trust her palate so much. I owe her everything.\"</p> <p>Elena was always an adventurous eater. \"I can remember the smell of my first truffle when I was eight, and a <em>txangurro</em> [crab] dish, without laurel [bay] as we like it here. My parents also brought home wonderful cheese from their travels.\"</p> <p>Good at school, she was, though, always determined to be a chef. Calming her concerned parents by first passing her university entrance, she studied and cooked outside Spain \u2013 including a six-month stint at Le Gavroche in London, aged 20 \u2013 before returning to San Sebasti\u00e1n.</p> <p>\"I spent six years abroad,\" she says. \"I had a cocktail of ideas, but I had to find my identity at Arzak, otherwise I wouldn't be useful. I worked in each station of the kitchen to relearn what happens in my house. I also studied many books of Basque cooking to learn more about my roots.\"</p> <p>She discovered her style in San Sebasti\u00e1n's markets. \"In the 90s, chefs here were cooking with mangoes,\" she shudders. \"I saw the local produce, the small peppers, other things, and I thought why are we not using more of this in modern food. After four years I had found my voice.\"</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-394943969\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/14/1344948083321/In-the-Arzak-kitchen-001.jpg\" alt=\"In the Arzak kitchen\" width=\"220\" height=\"293\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">In the Arzak kitchen. Photograph: Pal Hansen</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Pal Hansen</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Introducing her ideas for a cutting-edge Basque cuisine took time, patience and intense negotiation. \"My father risked very much with the ideas he started to make with me,\" she says. \"Sometimes he would say, 'the sauce is horrible, we will change it' and we would lose half the plate. I think my father thought, 'If I don't allow Elena to make her new things she will get bored and leave', but he also knew that if I introduced a tandoor, ginger, a mole from Mexico, it would work with the tastes of my region.\"</p> <p>A world-beating father and daughter team was born. \"Sometimes I wonder whether my father would have evolved in another way,\" she says. \"Perhaps he would be better. But we have been working together for 17 years. I am 42 now.\" Even today, both must agree on each new dish that appears on the menu (although Elena is still smarting over a sea urchin gratin\u00e9 her father vetoed 15 years ago).</p> <p>Back in the kitchen at Arzak. I ask Juan M what makes his daughter one of the best chefs in the world. He pauses, smiles and orders vintage Cristal to accompany our simple bowl of potato and peas. \"Primero, she is very ordered,\" he says quietly. \"Segundo, most important, is her palate. To be a good chef, you must know what is well done and not. Even where we are now with our cooking, we recognise Basque tradition.\"</p> <p>She has always had the sensibility of a chef, he says. \"When she was five years old I took her to the best restaurant in San Sebasti\u00e1n. She asked for her meat 'less well-done but warm'. I was embarrassed. Even as a child, she was always showing others what to do.\"</p> <p>It is Elena's turn to be embarrassed now. \"What we eat, how we eat, is in our culture,\" she says, taking the conversation into a more comfortable area. \"Our signature cuisine is Basque. My father and I talk about this all the time. Our taste is from here. We were born here. Since childhood we have in our minds a flavour: parsley, squid, hake throats. Even if we use herrings or dill, we cook unconsciously with this identity.\"</p> <p>While Juan M pours more champagne, Elena tells me that he cried for two days when told of her award.</p> <p>\"I am 70 in a month,\" he shrugs. \"My life is very long. It has been very special. She is a woman, I am a man. But in cooking there is only a plate. Sometimes she makes dishes I don't like. Sometimes I will make dishes that she won't like. But we make many, many dishes on which we agree.</p> <p>\"I have given a lot to her, she has given a lot to me. Our cooking is not from Juan Mari. It is not from Elena. It is Arzak!\"</p> <p>After seven extraordinary, exhausting hours together, Elena sums it up. \"I am Elena Arzak,\" she says simply, \"the daughter of Juan Mari. The possibility of cooking was always in my heart.\"</p> <p><em>For more information about the food and culture of San Sebasti\u00e1n, see</em><a href=\"http://www.sansebastianturismo.com/\" title=\"\"><em> sansebastianturismo.com</em></a></p>",

  "<p>Three out of four British people believe the Olympics showed Britain to be \"a confident, multi-ethnic country\", according to a survey of the national mood.</p> <p>The same proportion of Britons (75%) say they supported all Team GB athletes with equal passion, regardless of where they were born, with only 13% saying they had felt more loyal to British-born competitors.</p> <p>The poll, conducted by Ipsos MORI, for the independent thinktank British Future on the final weekend of the Olympics fortnight, shows attitudes are even more positive after the Games than they had been when people were questioned at the end of last year.</p> <p>Responding to the findings, the director of British Future, Sunder Katwala, whose father came to Britain from India in 1968, two weeks after Enoch Powell had warned that the country would be \"building its own funeral pyre\" by increasing immigration, said the late Tory minister's argument \"belongs to the history books now\". He said: \"What we see in Team GB is a snapshot of the making of modern Britain. At least a third of Britain's 65 medals reflected the positive contribution of immigration and integration to Britain over the last three generations. Team GB is not a perfect microcosm of modern British society. After all, it was selected through fierce sporting meritocracy, not any desire to offer a representative picture.</p> <p>\"There were almost no British Asian team members, though I saw plenty of young children with Union Jack facepaint in the Olympic Park who might be inspired in the next generation. But put our team alongside the torch carriers, the volunteers and the crowds, and it offered a pretty good snapshot of the country we have become: confident about our shared identity and shared pride. Britain has changed \u2013 but perhaps we have never before been quite as proud to be British.\"</p> <p>No fewer than 86% thought the Olympics had a positive effect on the national mood with 53% of these believing it had been \"very positive\". Only 6% said the effect had been negative; 82% of people said the Games had made people feel more proud to be British; 79% thought they would increase the amount of sport people play and 50% believed they would lead to an increase in volunteering; 67% said they were surprised how much the Olympics had brought the country together; while 58% thought the Games would leave a lasting, positive legacy.</p> <p>People were, however, realistic about the broader prospects for 2012. Back in December, 52% were optimistic about 2012 for them and their family and 26% pessimistic. As the Olympics ended, only 47% were saying the year had been good so far, while 27% said it had been bad for them and their families. Among Scots, opinion was divided about whether the Games would assist or hamper the independence cause. The most common view, held by 33%, was that it would lower support for separation, with 17% saying it would decrease support a lot. Around a half of Scots believed it would make no difference.</p> <p>Britain-wide, 66% agreed (12% disagreed) with reviewers that Danny Boyle's opening ceremony reflected the best of traditional and modern Britain. Asked whether the Games had shown the country to be a \"confident, multi-ethnic society\", 75% agreed (27% strongly) while only 7% disagreed.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-394903754\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2012/8/18/1345326922569/Olympic-poll-graphic--001.jpg\" alt=\"Olympic poll graphic \" width=\"460\" height=\"1206\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Olympic poll.

The wise thing to do, of course, would be to ignore them. Move on. Return to real life. Cherish the memories and not waste time looking for answers.</p> <p>And in this spirit there are indeed some queries that I'm happy to leave well alone. The meaning and purpose of Fatboy Slim's inflatable octopus, for example, and the disturbing shape and colour of Ray Davies's hair.</p> <p>But there are certain itches that cannot remain unscratched. And so, almost a week on from the celebration of great British popular music, there's still the bemused urge to know what preening boy band One Direction were doing there, and how George Michael was allowed to perform a song that no one had ever heard, and why Annie Lennox chose the dirgeful Little Bird and looked like she was appearing in a zombie version of <em>Les Miserables</em>, and what conceivable bearing on anything did the lifeless fashion interlude have?</p> <p>Such is the imponderable nature of these decisions that no doubt even the artistic director, Kim Gavin, would struggle to provide a rational explanation. Certainly the BBC commentating team of Huw Edwards, Hazel Irvine and Trevor Nelson were of little help. Only Nelson could boast any expertise in the field, but for all his professions of awe he sounded morosely detached or underwhelmed.</p> <p>As Irvine is so straight that she makes Sue Barker seem like a rock chick, she unwittingly gave the impression that, all things considered, she'd rather be interviewing Lee Westwood about his short game.</p> <p>Thus it fell to Edwards, the Martyn Lewis of his generation, to enlighten us. \"It's a jam-packed hour full of big names and brilliant music,\" he said in the officious tone of a budget airline steward running through a list of available sandwich fillings.</p> <p>In the event, the names were not as big as they might have been and the music mostly fell short of brilliant, but there were several highly enjoyable sequences. Curmudgeons have complained that there was too much pop music, as though the evening might have benefited from a performance of John Tavener's <em>The Protecting Veil</em>.</p> <p>But Gavin's idea \u2013 and it was a sound one \u2013 was to throw a party, and to that end the much-maligned (at least by the shoe-gazing fraternity of music critics) Jessie J turned in a PB performance, bringing a voice and vibrancy to the proceedings that the lacklustre Spice Girls couldn't hope to match.</p> <p>If Gavin's vision \u2013 full of mod London aesthetics \u2013 was narrower and less bold than Danny Boyle's, that was only right. The job of the opening was to raise a curtain on a nation, whereas that of the closing was to raise a glass to the Games. Both, like Team GB itself, reached Olympian heights.</p> <p>Those musical selection quibbles aside, the one slight disappointment was that the BBC, which put in a near-faultless performance over 17 days, sent the wrong team to the final event. Edwards and Irvine made it seem like being stuck at the school leaving disco with the headmaster and PE teacher, which, if nothing else, lent renewed resonance to the Who's spirited rendition of My Generation: \"Why don't you all f-fade away/ And don't try to dig what we all say.\"</p> <p>There were two films last week that relied on surprising castings for much of their dramatic punch. The weightiest of them was <strong>Tracie's Story</strong>, the first in the second series of Jimmy McGovern's <em>Accused</em>. It featured Sean Bean as Tracie, a love-starred transvestite who would have given Les Dawson's Ada a run for her money in a world's least-convincing woman competition.</p> <p>Better known for playing gruff, macho men, Bean was excellent as both Tracie and her male self, Simon, a frustrated English teacher, forever doomed to recite The Lady of Shalott.</p> <p>Dressed in spangly minidress and fright wig, the burly Tracie asked a bartender for a \"multiple orgasm\".</p> <p>\"On the rocks?\" he asked mechanically.</p> <p>\"Wherever, darling,\" she quipped back, \"I'm easy.\"</p> <p>That could have sounded just like a Les Dawson sketch, but Bean brought a touching melancholy to Tracie that suggested a scarred vulnerability beneath the brash Yorkshire wit. Equally well handled was the dalliance with Stephen Graham's conflicted married man.</p> <p>It worked as a parody of the heterosexual extramarital affair, intimating that affairs are themselves a parody of marriage and, in turn, that marriage can be a parody of love. They may not be original points, but they were addressed with originality, which at this late stage of human evolution is all that you can ask.</p> <p>What undermined the story was the inbuilt series conceit of a neat courtroom ending. In this case it hinged on Graham's character's failure to recognise Tracie in her non-drag Simon persona. Love may be blind, but not <em>that</em> blind. You simply can't hide Bean's distinctively masculine face with a bit of makeup and false hair. It would be like trying to conceal the identity of Abraham Lincoln's Mount Rushmore sculpture by spraying rouge on its cheeks.</p> <p>The other piece of conspicuous casting of the week was Rob Brydon as a first bed- then wheelchair-bound soldier in <strong>The Best of Men</strong>. Here was a drama that was utterly fearless in the face of social stereotypes and sentimental tropes, embracing both in the heartiest of warming hugs.</p> <p>A fictionalised account of the postwar origins of the Paralympics at Stoke Mandeville hospital, it focused on Dr Ludwig Guttmann, the German refugee who revolutionised the treatment of paraplegics. As played by Eddie Marsan, he was a scourge of received wisdom and apathy who was wont to say things such as: \"Ve are vinning ze battle of ze buttock.\"</p> <p>Brydon did well as an alternately brooding and wisecracking Welshman struggling to come to terms with his paralysis, but he was powerless to dislodge the treacly atmosphere of costumed nostalgia that smothered the proceedings like gauze on a camera&#xa0;lens.</p> <p>No one in their right mind looks to ITV two-part crime dramas for a shot of uncompromising verisimilitude, but even so, <strong>Thirteen Steps Down</strong> set new records on the codswallopometer. It was as if it had been filmed as an experiment in which character motivation was replaced by thematic reiteration. That would be a challenging strategy at the best of times, but plain bonkers when dealing with a plot that veered around like a meths drinker on a unicycle.</p> <p>There was a psychotic young man (Luke Treadaway) sharing a house with a grumpy old lady (Geraldine James) and a lot of hocus pocus about John Christie, the creepy serial killer of 10 Rillington Place fame. But that summary implies a narrative cohesion it never began to attain. How I longed for the dramatic discipline of the Olympic 5,000m.</p>",
  "<p>Towards the end of his third year at Sussex, Ian McEwan, somewhat reluctantly, visited the university's careers office. He already knew that he wanted to be a writer, but perhaps, he thought, this could be done in combination with a parent-placating job: \"I had read<em> Seven Pillars of Wisdom </em>[by TE Lawrence] and the one thing I could imagine being was an Arabist diplomat, the kind of man who would wear a dinner jacket one evening and a keffiyeh the next.\" The careers office gave him a pamphlet. \"On the back of it was a table. There were two columns. On one side was your age, all the way up to 65. On the other was your expected salary at any given age. I looked at it and it filled me with horror. My whole life was there. I was going to spend the next 35 years working my way through this table.\" The aspiring author's riding-a-camel-over-a-sand-dune fantasies were thus brought to a sudden and rather feeble end.</p> <p>Luckily, this was the early 70s, when it was very bliss to be alive. Honestly! \"I had the time of my life,\" says McEwan, with a fervent smile. \"It was very easy not to have a job, to live the life of a full-time writer. I had a huge apartment in south London and it cost me \u00a33 a week. The occasional review for the <em>TLS</em>, the occasional piece for <em>Radio&#xa0;Times</em>, and I could very easily pay my rent, buy a few books, make a weekly trip to the launderette. There were no machines everyone needed, apart from a hi-fi. I didn't feel poor at all. At the risk of sounding like Virginia Woolf, I could live on \u00a3700 a year.\"</p> <p>But what about the chaos? The piles of rubbish, the power cuts, the bodies left unburied? \"Oh, the crises didn't trouble me at all. I didn't own anything; I had no stake. I was restless, excited and a touch reckless. I remember reading Daniel Defoe's <em>A Journal of the Plague Year</em>. I loved the idea of a city in chaos. There was this line in it that went something like, 'We walked north out of London in order not to have the sun on our faces.' I thought: that's real freedom. I had this 'let it come down' feeling.\"</p> <p>There follows a brief pause while he considers what brought an end to this low-level insurrection, and I attempt to match up the 70s McEwan, hair trailing his cheesecloth collar, with the 21st-century version, who is today wearing tastefully crushed pale linen. His task is probably the easier. As he will tell me: \"The moment you have children and a mortgage you want things to work; you're locked into the human project and you want it to flourish.\" For my part, a leap of imagination is required. When I was told my meeting with McEwan would take place in the boardroom of his publisher, Random House, I was terribly disappointed; I wanted to nose round one of his famously lovely homes (preferably the exquisite Fitzrovia terraced house that was the model for the surgeon Henry Perowne's house in<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2005/jan/30/fiction.bookerprize2005\" title=\"\"><em> Saturday</em></a>). But now it strikes me as rather appropriate. McEwan is the nearest thing to<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/jul/22/publishers-ebook-popularity\" title=\"\"> EL James</a> that literary fiction has right now; in this sense, the boardroom chair on which he is uncomfortably perched \u2013 it keeps flipping back, forcing his knees up in the direction of his ears \u2013 might as well be a throne. No wonder I can no more see him in a launderette than I can picture him watching <em>The Only Way is Essex</em>.</p> <p>Anyway, the 70s. That is the decade in which McEwan's new book, <a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9780224097376\" title=\"\"><em>Sweet Tooth</em></a>, is set. I can't say too much about its plot, for the simple reason that it's a novel with a <em>Roger Ackroyd</em>-ish twist and it would be awful to ruin the surprise. But here are the bare bones: Serena Frome is a young Cambridge graduate who finds herself recruited to MI5. An avid reader, she's deployed to work on a cold war propaganda scheme, codenamed Sweet Tooth, in which government cash will secretly be deployed to fund artists likely to portray the west in a favourable light. One of these artists is a promising young writer, Tom Haley. First, Serena falls in love with his stories. Then she falls in love with their writer. No, she is not a particularly good spy. Her real-life contemporary, Stella Rimington, would have had her for breakfast. (<em>Sweet Tooth</em>, incidentally, makes reference to an ambitious colleague of Serena's called Millie Trimingham.)</p> <p>How did this curious, beguiling book \u2013 a spy novel without even so much as a hint of a poison-tipped umbrella \u2013 begin? Which came first, MI5 or the 70s? \"It's hard to say,\" says McEwan. \"I rather drift into my novels. For a long time I've been interested in the <em>Encounter </em>affair [Stephen Spender resigned as the editor of the literary magazine <em>Encounter</em> in 1967, after it was revealed that the CIA had been covertly funding it], and I wondered if there was something in there for me; after I finished <a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9780099512790\" title=\"\"><em>On Chesil Beach</em>,</a> which is set in the early 60s, I thought: sooner or later I'm going to write about England in the 70s. So I think it was both. In the end, though, I just took up my green notebook and got Serena to start talking \u2013 albeit somewhat against my will.\" Why? \"Because I've got a prejudice against first-person narratives. There are too many of them. They're too easy; it's just ventriloquism and authors can hide their terrible style behind characterisation. Any number of cliches are permitted.\"</p> <p>McEwan's MI5 is a hidebound place, staffed mostly by Pooterish, middle-aged men; filing cabinets are the order of the day, not invisible ink. He was, he says, interested in the idea of institutions and how they grow to have their own weird logic. \"What was extraordinary about the cultural cold war was that the CIA in particular poured millions of dollars into very worthy things \u2013 like a festival of atonal music in Paris in 1950. The idea was to persuade left-of-centre European intellectuals that the west was best and that America wasn't just mindless and materialist. And when you think about the horrors the Soviet regime produced, you think: why not? But you also think: why did they do this in secret? Why didn't the government just use the National Endowment for the Arts or something? It never occurred to them that secrecy wasn't necessary.\"</p> <p>In the novel, though, his interest in MI5 wavers a little once Tom Haley appears on the scene, perhaps because he and Tom Haley have so much in common. Haley teaches at Sussex University; he's published by Tom Maschler, who first edited McEwan; he does a reading for his first novel with McEwan's friend, Martin Amis; and two of his stories have been purloined on his behalf from his creator's backlist. \"Yes,\" says McEwan. \"Well spotted. The novel is a muted and distorted autobiography, though unfortunately a beautiful woman never came into my room and offered me a stipend.\"</p> <p>So what is he saying, exactly? This merging of fact and fiction, and the several duplicities that run through the book, when combined with its passionate accounts of reading and writing, suggest, at least to me, that<em> Sweet Tooth</em> is a meditation on the fact that novelists are cunning and cold-hearted thieves; in fact, doesn't Tom Haley say as much? \"Yes. Tom mentions the ruthlessness that is necessary to the process \u2013 and it's Serena's fear, too, that he'll write about her.\" Graham Greene said that all writers have a \"chip of ice\" in their hearts. Does he?</p> <p>\"No, I don't think I do. Philip Roth once said to me years ago, when he took an interest in me as a young writer: you've got to write as if your parents are dead. It was very good advice, and I stuck to it, and now I look back with some horror. My father, especially, was torn between exultant pride that I'd published a book and sheer horror at what was in it. So I must have had a steely bit of detachment then. But I've never done what Bellow did in <em>Herzog,</em> or Roth, or Hanif [Kureishi]\u2026 put their ex-wives in books. I couldn't do that.\" He thinks for a moment. \"My chip of ice is a bit\u2026 slushy.\"</p> <p>Ian McEwan is the child of a soldier: his father, David, was a working-class Scot who worked his way up to the rank of major. He was born in Aldershot and lived first in Germany and then in Libya until, at the age of 11, he was sent to a state-run boarding school in Suffolk. McEwan has said in the past that this was quite a bleak time: \"I just went numb for four or five years.\" On the other hand, his dorm experiences came in handy when, in 2005, he travelled with the environmental group Cape Farewell to Svalbard in the Arctic \u2013 the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/mar/14/solar-ian-mcewan\" title=\"\">trip that inspired his last novel</a>, <a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9780099549024\" title=\"\"><em>Solar</em></a>. Not for him the chaos of the bootroom. He kept his stuff safely under his bed.</p> <p>After an English degree at Sussex he went to the University of East Anglia, where he studied for an MA, tutored by Angus Wilson and Malcolm Bradbury. He moved to London in 1974 and became part of the literary set that centred on Ian Hamilton's <a href=\"http://www.ianhamilton.org/newreview/index.html\" title=\"\"><em>New Review</em></a> (Hamilton, like Wilson, has a walk on part in <em>Sweet Tooth</em>) and the Pillars of Hercules pub in Greek Street, Soho. It was during this time that he formed some of his most important friendships: with Martin Amis, Julian Barnes and Christopher Hitchens.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/dec/16/christopher-hitchens-appreciation-by-ian-mcewan\" title=\"\">Hitchens died of cancer last year.</a> What is the post-Hitch world like? Oh no. He looks so terrible, as pale as ash, I wish I had not asked. \"It's very\u2026 desolate. It really does feel empty. He was the one of us who seemed to embrace all of literature; as time goes by, I don't think people will associate him with his taking an unusual line on Iraq. They will connect him with his brilliant essays on writers: Chesterton, Kipling, Wodehouse. The appetite. The conversations. I really do miss them. Martin and I regularly check in with each other in the post-Hitch desert.\"</p> <p>How, though, did he manage to stay friends with them all? The literary world can be bitchy and envious. Fall-outs are standard. \"Well, we knew each other before we were known; it's not as if we are movie stars all hanging out together.\" Besides, he says, novel-writing isn't like sprinting. No one needs to come second; there is infinite space for good writing. \"And perhaps we're too old, now, to be jealous. The status anxiety wears off. I like their company. Supper at Julian's is one of the great pleasures.\"</p> <p>But what if one of them had had to slope off and join a less celebrated profession? \"It probably would have changed things, yes. Maybe it was a self-selecting group, though. Who would want to hang out around the Pillars of Hercules? Only those bent by this passion for writing books. We were absolutely determined to become writers. We didn't use words like 'passion', but we acted them out. Writing was the only important thing.\"</p> <p>His success came a little later than that of Amis. The early macabre books \u2013 think incest, think murder, think sex with shop mannequins \u2013 were acclaimed and they had their devoted fans, but I don't imagine they were big sellers (the first came out in 1975). Then, in 1998, his novel <em>Amsterdam</em> won the Booker prize. Nine years later, his 2001 novel <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2001/sep/23/fiction.bookerprize2001\" title=\"\"><em>Atonement</em></a> was made into an Oscar-winning <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/119568/atonement\" title=\"\">film</a>, at which point its already considerable sales doubled, even tripled. Does he think success has an effect on creativity?</p> <p>\"Of course it makes a difference,\" he says. \"But I've always done what I want to do, with the result that when I close the door and unhook the phone I feel all the old anxieties associated with trying to get something right.\" And there are certain new anxieties. \"You worry that sooner or later \u2013 it has to happen \u2013 you can't write; that you will become less thought-rich; there is the danger of repeating yourself. All writers in their 60s have to confront these things. When should you stop? Do you tail away with a series of feeble novellas? But in the silence of trying to do it, it doesn't feel different.\" He is keen to remind me that <em>Atonement</em> is an anomaly. \"It [having a huge hit] happened once. A couple of books recently haven't earned back their advances, and the advances weren't that big. <em>Solar</em>, since I'm being frank with you, was loathed by the Americans. It absolutely bombed.\"</p> <p>This is no good. If he's trying, metaphorically speaking, to give me a reality-checking cold shower, it isn't working. His life, from the outside, seems so replete, so purposeful, so \u2013 not a word one usually associates with writers \u2013 happy. It's enough to make you sick! He laughs. \"Yeah, well, stay with that thought.\" And then: \"Like lots of people, I made a very good second marriage [to Annalena McAfee, a journalist whom he met when she came to interview him]. We have to learn how to get that right\u2026 and I take a lot of delight in my sons [from his first marriage, to Penny Allen, whom he divorced in 1995]. I thought it would be bleak when they stopped thinking I was God, but I love the unfolding plot of their early adulthood.\" One is a molecular biologist, the other is working in PR.</p> <p>You can't necessarily organise how life works out, he tells me. But still, I can't help but read his own contentment \u2013 such peace always involves, I think, a certain amount of effort \u2013 as a rebuke to his (now dead) parents. Their marriage was troubled, largely because they were keeping a painful secret: in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2007/jan/17/books.booksnews\" title=\"\">2007, McEwan discovered that he had an older brother</a>, Dave Sharp \u2013 the result of an affair between his parents when his mother, Rose, was still married to her first husband (Ernest Wort, with whom she had two children, was off fighting in Italy; her baby with David McEwan was born in 1942; Wort died from combat injuries in 1944). The baby was given away via a newspaper ad in the <em>Reading Mercury </em>which said: \"Wanted, Home for Baby Boy, age one month; complete surrender.\"</p> <p>\"That would have been my father,\" says McEwan. \"He would have written that ad. 'Complete surrender' \u2013 it's semi-military.\" Did he feel cross when he discovered what his parents had done? \"Yes. I wanted to shake them. I wanted to say, 'Confront this; deal with it, make yourselves happy.' My regret is that they didn't meet David, because he would have reassured them he wasn't bitter. One of the first things he [David] said to me was, 'I was loved as a child.' He went to visit my mother but she'd already lost her mind. If he'd gone even a year earlier\u2026\"</p> <p>It's such a sad story, given that Rose and David eventually married and could have brought up their child together. \"Yes. They closed something down for themselves. Probably that was my father too. I can hear him say it, 'What's done is done.' But my parents' generation\u2026 it took the 60s for people to give themselves permission to talk about things.\"</p> <p>Is the presence of his brother in his life (Sharp is a bricklayer) another element of his contentment? I think it must be. Even if they're not best friends, a flashlight has been shone in the direction of yet another shadow. McEwan doesn't disagree. \"It makes life richer,\" he says, quietly. \"It absolutely does.\"</p> <p>It's a measure of McEwan's writerly reputation that, even before publication, <em>Sweet Tooth</em> is causing a fuss; the Booker judges have naughtily neglected to put it on their longlist. \"Oh, I've become immune to the Booker,\" he says, though this is an easy line to take when you've already won it. \"I think we need something a little more like the Pulitzer prize, where there isn't this great race. The sense that it's a 110 yard dash has a streak of vulgarity about it.\" As for the reviews, he won't read them. Does he think, as so many people claim, that we are witnessing the end of publishing and, with it, perhaps, the slow death of the novel itself? \"We have a hunger for talking and thinking about others and I don't think any other form can deliver that insider-ish feeling.\"</p> <p>Screen or paper, it doesn't matter. On the other hand, he's just moved house \u2013 yes, Henry's place has been sold, replaced with a flat in Bloomsbury and a house in Gloucestershire \u2013 and he has spent several days pulling books from boxes. \"You put them on the shelf and it's the complete narrative of your existence,\" he says. \"All these crappy, yellowing paperbacks I bought when I was 17. I'll never read them again, but I could never throw them away, either.\" He hugs himself, trying his best \u2013 mostly for my benefit \u2013 to look neurotic. \"I want them around me and that's not something you can do electronically.\"<em> </em></p>",
  "<p>Italian and German cultures do not, as a rule, have many characteristics in common \u2013 as anyone who is interested in economics, food or football well knows. This dichotomy makes the Alpine region of South Tyrol an intriguing, Channel 4-style experiment. A geopolitical <em>Wife Swap</em>, if you like.</p> <p>A small, hilly place about twice the size of Kent, South Tyrol is an idyllic enclave of medieval castles, steepled churches, apple orchards and vineyards. An Austrian territory for eons, it has been an Italian province since the First World War, but no one seems to have told most of the half-million inhabitants. Today 70% of South Tyroleans speak German and another 5% have Ladin, a local dialect in the Dolomites, as their first language. Road signs offer you at least two, sometimes three variations, and when you walk into a shop there's always a moment of sizing up before you decide to go for a \"Buongiorno\", a \"Guten Tag\" or even a \"Gruss Gott\".</p> <p>As a holiday destination, it sends some mixed messages, too. Should you expect somewhere ordered and efficient, or chaotic and charming? Or would South Tyrol somehow have fatally assumed the more regrettable stereotypes of all its influences? You know, no sun loungers <em>and</em> waiters who try to sleep with your girlfriend.</p> <p>The good news is that South Tyrol has emerged blessedly unscathed from its traumatic parental tug of war. As a territory, it has always valued its independence: it has been&#xa0;run since 1948 by the South Tyrolean People's Party, which is free to assign 90% of all levied taxes. So while some aspects of life here are unmistakably Italian and others Germanic, it remains a place not quite like anywhere else in Europe.</p> <p>South Tyrol can seem a gnarly, impenetrable place to reach, existing entirely within the Alps sung with the Austrian border to the north and Switzerland to the west, and its landscape is defined by spiky peaks and dense forests. There are now road links from Innsbruck and Munich, but most British travellers fly to Verona and proceed north for a&#xa0;couple of hours by rail or hire car.</p> <p>This journey will be extended if you stay \u2013 as you must do \u2013 in the Pension Briol. This 13-room fairy-tale hotel is halfway up a volcanic mountain in the Dolomites, in the east of the region. First you have to reach Barbiano, a village high in the Isarco Valley; map readers be warned that there are multiple place names (here we will favour the Italian versions).</p> <p>At Barbiano you leave your transport in a car park and take one of two options for reaching Briol: either a punishing 15-minute taxi-jeep ride on a rocky path up the side of the mountain or an hour-long scenic walk through Alpine pastures and wildflower meadows.</p> <p>The advantage of arriving on foot is that the remarkable Briol slowly reveals itself through gaps in the trees. The mountain you are climbing is called Tre Chiese, named after three ancient churches, but is known locally as \"the mountain of women\". It was bought in the 19th&#xa0;century by Johanna Settari; she divided it up and handed it down to her 15 children (11 daughters and four sons). Settari laid down a few ground rules: most importantly, that the mountain should remain in the family and that development would be limited to simple, congruous structures. These wishes have been assiduously respected.</p> <p>Briol started off in 1898 as a&#xa0;Tyrolean mountain refuge, but was developed into its present form in the 1920s by Hubert Lanzinger. Obviously an admirer of the Bauhaus school of design, he set out to make \"a temple to the sun\" at 4,300ft. The result is a stunning modernist structure of brick and wood with large windows that allow you to peer down over Val Gardena and a mountain-water swimming pool.</p> <p>The guesthouse is run by Settari's great-granddaughter, Johanna von Klebelsberg, and her husband Urban, and staying at Briol feels (pleasantly) like stepping back in time. The elegant pine chairs and tables, crockery and cutlery were all designed by Lanzinger; the floorboards are spruce. There are no private bathrooms, just shared facilities on each floor and a white tin jug in your room. Dinner is announced by a cowbell, and you are brought three courses without being consulted on the menu. This is only a problem if you don't like dumplings and apricot tart; your sole decision is to pick wine from a list created by Urban, a vintner by trade. There are no TVs, just an old-fashioned games room \u2013 and don't even think about asking for a Wi-Fi password.</p> <p>I had heard that the von Klebelsbergs were working with acclaimed Swiss architect Peter Zumthor, the 2009 Pritzker prize laureate, on five wooden treehouses for Briol, but Johanna seemed almost embarrassed when I brought this up. She has known Zumthor for many years, long before his recent celebrity, and the idea of the retreat being overrun by architecture groupies made her deeply uncomfortable.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395035796\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Observer/Columnist/Columnists/2012/8/13/1344854578213/Fincube-low-energy-house-008.jpg\" alt=\"Fincube low-energy house\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A Fincube low-energy house at Renon.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Despite von Klebelsberg's protests, those with an interest in design are likely to be drawn to South Tyrol anyway. If you can bear to leave the cool and calm of Briol you can see an alternative vision of modernist living at Renon, the location of an example of a&#xa0;Fincube house. Fincubes are high-concept, low-energy homes built from wood and glass that are sustainable and transportable.</p> <p>In the region's capital, Bolzano, there is Museion, a modern and contemporary art museum housed, since 2008, in a futurist oblong cube. Nowhere is South Tyrol's intermingling of cultures more evident than in Bolzano, a small city with the German-speaking medieval centre on one side of the River Talvera and the predominantly Italian modern quarter on the other. Museion stands in the middle, and with its transparent facade it seems like it is uniting these two unlikely cultures. Like the rest of South Tyrol, it shouldn't work, but somehow it does.</p> <h2>Essentials</h2> <p>British Airways (<a href=\"http://www.ba.com\">ba.com</a>) flies twice daily from Gatwick to Verona from \u00a390 return.

Photograph: Romas Foord</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Romas Foord</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This is a recipe I learnt at the River Caf\u00e9. Rose taught me how to make this rustic Italian soup two ways \u2013 an autumn/winter ribollita and a summer ribollita.</p> <p>Serves 6<br><strong>fresh cannellini beans </strong>225g <br><strong>garlic</strong> 2 cloves, peeled and finely chopped<br><strong>head of celery</strong> 1 whole, cleaned and finely diced (reserve the bright yellow leaves)<br><strong>carrot</strong> 1 medium, peeled and finely diced<br><strong>red onions</strong> 2 medium, peeled, finely diced<br><strong>pequin chillis</strong> 4 dry, crushed (or 2 standard dried red chillis) <br><strong>olive oil</strong> 55ml <br><strong>heirloom tomatoes</strong> 450g, blanched, peeled <br><strong>flat leaf parsley</strong> 2 handfuls or <strong>marjoram</strong> loosely packed and then roughly chopped<br><strong>Swiss chard</strong> 575g, stems removed and roughly chopped<br><strong>stale Italian bread</strong> enough to cover the cooking pot in one even layer when sliced about 1cm thick<br><strong>sea salt, black pepper and olive oil</strong> to finish</p> <p>Place the fresh, uncooked beans in a pot and add just enough water to cover them. Then add half as much water again. Bring the water to the boil and turn down to a low simmer and cook until tender, but not mushy. Allow the beans to cool in their liquid.</p> <p>If using dried beans, add water to cover and then add the same amount again. Cook as you would fresh beans but be aware that dried beans will take significantly longer to cook.</p> <p>To make the soup, in a wide saucepan, fry the garlic, celery, carrot, onion and chillis in the olive oil over a medium heat.</p> <p>While the vegetables are cooking, squeeze the tomatoes over a bowl to release their seeds and juice. Make sure to get all of the seeds out. Strain the seeds from the tomato liquid and reserve the juice. Discard the seeds.</p> <p>After cooking the vegetables for about 30 minutes, until they are soft and lightly caramelised, add the parsley (or marjoram) and fry for another 5 minutes. Next, add the tomatoes with their liquid, and beat the tomatoes with a whisk. Continue cooking for another 30 minutes over a low heat. The tomato liquid should be absorbed by the other vegetables and your soup should be, once again, fairly dry. Now add the beans along with their cooking liquid and cook over a low heat, simmering for 20-25 minutes, or until the soup comes together: the various components should move together when stirred, but the soup should still be moist from the beans' cooking liquid. Add the chard and fold it into the soup. Cover the surface of the pot with the bread and pour just enough hot water over it all to moisten the bread. Give the bread a generous drizzle of good olive oil and remove the pot from the heat. Let the soup sit unattended for 10 minutes, then stir to combine. It should be thick and delicious. Season with salt and pepper.</p> <h2>Cucumber salad with trout roe, sesame seeds and herbs</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-394701399\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/14/1344940162523/Cucumber-salad-with-trout-008.jpg\" alt=\"Cucumber salad with trout roe, sesame seeds and herbs\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cucumber salad with trout roe, sesame seeds and herbs.

Place in a bowl and toss with salt then drain over a colander for 1 hour in the fridge to remove some of the water.</p> <p>Pat dry and quickly wipe the bowl to remove the salty water. Add the cucumbers back to the bowl along with the vinegar and garlic and let sit for 5 minutes, then add the creme fraiche, olive oil, 2 tbsp of sesame and coriander seeds. Roughly chop half the mint and dill/coriander and gently mix.</p> <p>To serve, pile high in a bowl and sprinkle with the roe, then finish with the remaining herbs and sesame seeds.</p> <h2>Tomatoes with cured sardines and basil mayonnaise</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-394701400\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/14/1344940573087/Tomatoes-with-cured-sardi-008.jpg\" alt=\"Tomatoes with cured sardines and basil mayonnaise\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tomatoes with cured sardines and basil mayonnaise. Photograph: Romas Foord</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Romas Foord</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>These are so easy and I love the freshness of curing my sardines.</p> <p>Serves 6<br><strong>sardine fillets</strong> 16<br><strong>red wine vinegar</strong> 55ml <br><strong>sel gris or Maldon salt</strong> <br><strong>pequin chilli peppers</strong> 2, crushed<br><strong>lemon</strong> zest of \u00bd a lemon<br><strong>olive oil</strong> 3 tbsp <br><strong>mixed heirloom tomatoes</strong> 225g <br><strong>grilled bread</strong> 6 slices, rubbed with a clove of garlic and drizzled with olive oil</p> <p>For the basil mayo (this will make more than you need for this recipe, but can be kept for up to a week in the fridge)<br><strong>egg yolks </strong>2 <br><strong>lemon juice</strong> 2 tbsp <br><strong>English mustard</strong> 1 tbsp <br><strong>olive oil</strong> 225ml <br><strong>basil leaves</strong> a good handful (reserve a few of the best-looking leaves for serving)</p> <p>For the basil mayonnaise. Place the egg yolks, lemon juice and mustard in a food processor and whizz until frothy. Add the olive oil in a thin stream until the oil is all incorporated and you have a thick creamy mayonnaise. If your mayonnaise is thick and gloppy, add some iced water to let it down. Add the basil \u2013 it's important it is really tender. If the spines seem too tough, split each leaf down the middle and remove the centre vein. Give the basil a rough chop, then add it to the processor and give the mayonnaise another spin with the basil. The blade of the processor should make quick work of the basil and your mayo should turn barely green with small specks of basil running through it. Finally, add a tablespoon of salt, transfer to a non-reactive container, cover and refrigerate so that the basil stays green.</p> <p>You can leave the fish overnight for a fully cured fillet, or use them after a few hours for a milder flavour. Place the red wine vinegar in a non-reactive tray and lay the sardine fillets cut-side down in it. Sprinkle over the salt, a little crushed chilli, a couple of rasps of lemon zest and finally a little olive oil.</p> <p>Slice a few of the larger tomatoes, then cut the smaller tomatoes into rustic chunks. Season gently with a touch of salt, then drizzle with some of the fish marinade. Let these sit for a second while you compose the plate.</p> <p>Place the grilled bread on a plate and top with a dollop of basil mayo. Place the tomatoes evenly on top, then top them off with the cured sardines and finish with a few leaves of basil.</p> <h2>Grilled rib-eye with sweet corn and coriander butter</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-394701401\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/14/1344940317702/Grilled-rib-eye-with-swee-008.jpg\" alt=\"Grilled rib-eye with sweet corn and coriander butter\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Grilled rib-eye with sweet corn and coriander butter. Photograph: Romas Foord</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Romas Foord</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This recipe is great to do on the grill. Slather the spicy butter on the corn.</p> <p>Serves 6<br>For the rib-eye and corn<br><strong>bone-in rib-eye steaks </strong>3 x 6cm-thick (about 1kg each)<br><strong>lemon</strong> \u00bd <br><strong>husked sweet corn</strong> 6 ears</p> <p>For the coriander butter<br><strong>unsalted butter</strong> 450g, room temperature <br><strong>coriander leaves</strong> 2 large handfuls (reserve a few for garnish)<br><strong>red chilli</strong> 1 tbsp, finely diced <br><strong>pickled jalapenos</strong> 4 tbsp, drained (reserve the brine, if available)<br><strong>lemon zest</strong> 2 tsp (about \u00bd a lemon's worth)<br><strong>Banyuls vinegar or red wine vinegar</strong> 1\u00bd tbsp (or the reserved jalapeno brine)<br><strong>Maldon salt</strong> to taste</p> <p>To make the butter, start with the room temperature butter in a large mixing bowl. The butter should be soft and malleable, but not melting. Finely chop the coriander and add it to the butter. Mix it well, using your hands or a mixer. Once the coriander is thoroughly incorporated into the butter, add the rest of the ingredients and mix again, until it all comes together into a creamy, green butter with specks of chilli. (Mixing the coriander in first will prevent it from oxidising.) Add salt to taste.</p> <p>If you plan to use the butter straight away, leave it out at room temperature. Otherwise, you can keep it fresh in the fridge for a few days or in the freezer for even longer. Remember to bring your butter back up to room temperature before you use it.</p> <p>To cook the steak and sweet corn, generously season the steaks all over with salt. Let them rest for 10 minutes at room temperature and preheat a grill or grill pan over a medium heat.</p> <p>Put the steaks on the grill or pan and cook, uncovered, until the bottom has a lovely dark brown crust, about 15 minutes \u2013 rotate the steaks after about 7 minutes to get nice cross-hatched grill marks. Use tongs to gently flip the steaks and cook the second side the same way. Rest for about 8 minutes.</p> <p>While the steaks are resting, place the corn on the grill or grill pan. Cook, rotating frequently, until the corn is nicely charred all the way around. Remove the corn and let it rest for just a minute or two.</p> <p>To assemble the dish, use a sharp knife to cut the steaks across the grain into 1cm-thick slices. Place a few slices of steak on each plate. Slather a tablespoon of butter on each piece of corn and place one ear next to the steak on each plate. Garnish with a few extra leaves of coriander and drizzle the steak with olive oil, if you please. Serve the rest of the butter on the side.</p> <h2>Blueberry clafoutis with lemon verbena ice cream</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-394701402\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/14/1344940439859/Blueberry-clafoutis-with--008.jpg\" alt=\"Blueberry clafoutis with lemon verbena ice cream\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Blueberry clafoutis with lemon verbena ice cream.

It goes really well with pretty much anything, even a simple salad. I love the lightness and the intense corn flavour in the dish.</p> <p>Makes one large oval dish, 28cm long x 20cm wide x 5cm deep<br><strong>sweetcorn kernels </strong>650g <br><strong>milk</strong> 110ml <br><strong>cream</strong> 225ml <br><strong>butter</strong> 3 tbsp <br><strong>flour</strong> 3 tbsp <br><strong>eggs</strong> 4, separated<br><strong>salt</strong> to taste</p> <p>Preheat the oven to 200C/gas mark 6. Butter a baking dish of the above dimensions and place in the refrigerator to chill.</p> <p>Place the milk, cream and corn kernels in a pot. Bring to the boil and turn the heat off. Strain the mixture and split the corn kernels into two separate bowls. Split the liquid into two separate bowls as well. In a blender, puree half of the warmed corn kernels with half of the milk and cream mixture until silky smooth. Pour the pureed corn mixture back into a bowl with the rest of the corn kernels, milk and cream.</p> <p>In a separate pot, melt the butter just until it begins to froth. Do not let it colour or fry. Add the flour and cook over a medium-low heat, whisking constantly and making sure to get your whisk into the corners of the pot so that the roux never burns or sticks to the pot. After 5 minutes or so, your butter and flour should come together into a foamy mass and the flour should no longer taste raw. At this point, slowly add to the corn mixture, whisking vigorously so that no lumps form. Continue to cook and whisk over a medium-low heat until the mixture has thickened. Season to taste with salt.</p> <p>Whisk together the egg yolks and add a little of your warm corn mixture to temper the yolks. Then pour the yolks into the pot with the rest of the corn mixture. Whisk it all to thoroughly incorporate the egg yolks. Set aside to cool.</p> <p>In a bowl whisk the egg whites until they are stiff but not grainy. Carefully fold the whipped whites into the cool sweetcorn base until just incorporated. Be careful not to deflate the egg whites during this process.</p> <p>Take the buttered baking dish out of the refrigerator and fill three-quarters full with the sweetcorn mixture. Place in a roasting tin and fill the tin halfway up the side of the baking dish with hot water. Bake at 200C/gas mark 6 for around an hour, or until set.</p>",
  "<p>After the critical mauling former BP boss Tony Hayward received for his handling of Gulf of Mexico blowout, you would think he'd want a quiet life. But instead, his new job as boss of Genel Energy has put him at the centre of a skirmish between the oil barons of Iraq and Kurdistan.</p> <p>Genel, whose backers include Nat Rothschild, has taken a bet on Kurdistan being the next big province for the oil industry and recently increased its stake in an exploratory field there. So the City will want to know Hayward's take on the argy-bargy between Baghdad and Erbil at the company's half-year results on Thursday. Iraq has threatened to cut ties with foreign oil companies if they violate Iraqi law and proceed with upstream work in the self-governing region. Kurdistan, meanwhile, is close to completing a pipeline to Turkey that will enable its producers to bypass Iraq altogether.</p> <p>Mehmet Sepil, Genel's president, is already feeling chipper: \"Baghdad has lost its oil and natural gas fight against northern Iraq. Baghdad says it will put those who operate in northern Iraq on a blacklist but the largest companies in the world are working there. The energy fight is over today. The important question is when Baghdad will admit this.\" My guess is not any time soon.</p> <h2>Premier still in choppy waters<br></h2> <p>There will be another chance to take the temperature of the (political) waters of the South Atlantic when plucky British explorer Premier Oil reports its first-half figures on Thursday.</p> <p>Last week rival Desire Petroleum did its best to drum up excitement over the chances of a commercial oil strike off the Malvinas, as Buenos Aires likes to calls them. The buzz bodes well for Premier, which recently bought a 60% stake in Aim-listed Rockhopper Exploration's interests in the Falkland Islands to get its hands on some of the action in the Sea Lion field, which could have between 400m and 500m barrels of recoverable reserves.</p> <p>But the oil companies are battling in choppy seas, as the Argentinian government is threatening to take anyone \"illegally\" drilling off the disputed islands to court. The British government has promised to stand by its explorers, and many industry experts point out that the Argentinian court threats are highly unlikely to stand up under international law.</p> <p>But some equity analysts have since questioned the wisdom of Premier choosing to put so many of its eggs into such a fragile basket. The chief executive, Simon Lockett, will need to explain why the Sea Lion should be allowed to roar.</p> <h2>Another hurdle for BAA<br></h2> <p>BAA, the owner of Heathrow airport, had a quietly successful Olympics \u2013 which counts as a major achievement for one of the UK's more pilloried businesses. Given that success for BAA consists of not being caned by the national press on a daily basis, a glitch-free Games is cause for celebration. But it faces a more complicated repeat of that test on Wednesday when it is expecting its busiest arrival day for Paralympians, with more than 1,000 athletes expected to arrive while the airport handles about 190,000 passengers at the same time.</p> <p>It will be an interesting introduction for BAA's newest prospective shareholder, Qatar Holding, which has agreed to acquire a 20% stake in the business. Spain's Ferrovial, which once owned 55% of BAA, will soon find its stake dipping below 40%. If the next few weeks go smoothly, as they hopefully should, then perhaps BAA can begin to think it has banished the operational glitches that have bedevilled its recent history, not least the terrible handling of the 2010 snow crisis. If errors abound, however, the ensuing media and political reaction might make the Qataris wonder what they have let themselves in for.</p>",
  "<p>Geocarpy is a term used by botanists to describe the unusual \"behaviour\" of a plant that deposits <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diaspore_%28botany%29\" title=\"\">diaspores</a> directly into the soil. That is to say, not just its seeds, but also associated tissues that assist in dispersal. Although geocarpy is uncommon among flowering plants in general, it is widespread in at least eight different families. One example known to us all is the peanut, <em>Arachis hypogaea</em>.</p> <p>Geocarpy is often associated with plants growing in ephemeral or highly variable habitats. It is thought that geocarpy is a means of retaining offspring in a favourable micro-habitat and protecting them from unsuitable conditions, sometimes including fire or predators.</p> <p>A newly discovered species from north-eastern Bahia in Brazil is the first example of geocarpy in the family <em>Loganiaceae</em>. It belongs to the genus <em>Spigelia</em>, which includes about 60 species of neotropical herbs and shrubs. Members of the genus may be found from about the latitude of Buenos Aires northwards, through Central America and into the Caribbean and southern US. More than half of all species are restricted to South America, with 15 in Bahia alone. And although dwarfism is not unknown in the genus, it is rare and limited to just a few species.The first examples of this spectacular little plant were no more than 3cm tall and were first discovered by plant collector and author Jos\u00e9 Carlos Mendes Santos. Most were found on exposed roadside soil partly covered by leaf litter, in the Atlantic forest biome.</p> <p>The flower appears for a short while during the rainy season and disappears completely through the dry season. Other specimens were observed in leaf litter- or moss-covered sandy soil along the border of patches of tabuleiro forest and were taller, up to 25cm.Plants showed two growth forms. The first produces flowers after only three pairs of leaves are formed and the plant is just 1cm tall. The second flowers after four or five pairs of leaves unfurl and the plant is more than 10cm tall. In the first form, the ripe fruit is deposited on the ground; in the higher form, flowers bend but cannot touch the soil.</p> <p>This unusual and lovely flower was described by an international team of collaborators, led by Alex Popovkin and including co-authors from <a href=\"http://www.wcu.edu/\" title=\"\">Western Carolina University</a>, Madrid's <a href=\"http://www.escet.urjc.es/\" title=\"\">Escuela Superior de Ciencias Experimentales y Tecnologia</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.rutgers.edu/\" title=\"\">Rutgers University</a>. The specific name refers to the \"sometimes repeated bending of its infructescence branches to the ground, figuratively evoking an image of the etiquette of genuflection\".</p>",

This is the romance of the cup in excelsis, and a comparison between the two sides makes David look like a lively outsider when he met&#xa0;Goliath.</p> <p>Gothenburg, founded in 1904, are the most successful club in Swedish history, with 18 championships and two Uefa Cups. Langholmen are only 10 years old and lie second from bottom of Division 4, the sixth tier of Swedish football. They have 10 teams above them in the league and a further 276 in the Swedish football pyramid.</p> <p>\"It's probably the equivalent of Manchester United playing a good county-level side, two levels below the Conference,\" says Andrew O'Sullivan, the left midfielder and press officer. Imagine Manchester United against Stocksbridge Park Steels or Hemel Hempstead Town in the FA Cup. Exactly. \"We would have to have a miraculous performance, they would have to leave their minds behind in Gothenburg, and only then would there be any chance of us unsettling them. As a player, the original feeling of excitement has now changed into the slight fear of a 16-0 thrashing.\"</p> <p>The Gothenburg squad includes Tobias Hysen, the son of the former Liverpool defender Glenn. His last match was for Sweden against Brazil on Wednesday. \"A seamless transition of quality,\" says O'Sullivan.</p> <p>Brazil almost certainly has more football players than Langholmen does people. It's a tiny island famous for two things: it was a prison island until 1975 \u2013 which is why Langholmen play in black-and-white stripes \u2013 and it has a Schnapps factory.</p> <p>Langholmen's shirts are sponsored by Southside, \"Stockholm's best and friendliest Irish pub\". It's the team's unofficial clubhouse, with memorabilia adorning the walls. The pub staff store and wash the kit, while providing Chips of Victory \u2013 or Chips of Mediocrity \u2013 after each game. It seems fair to assume that ice baths and Gatorade chasers are not on offer.</p> <p>The club started when a group of friends, mainly British and Irish, met for a regular Saturday morning kickaround on a gravel pitch. A few years later they set up a team and joined the Swedish football pyramid at the bottom in Division 8. Langholmen were promoted five times in the first seven years and even spent a season in the national, semi-professional Division 3. They now have six men's teams and two women's teams and are exploring the possibility of a youth scheme.</p> <p>They usually play at Essinge IP (known as the Rock), a pitch in a residential area with a car park that has precisely seven spaces. For this match they have hired Grimsta IP, the home ground of the second-tier team IF&#xa0;Brommapojkarna.</p> <p>\"The logistics behind this game are such that we wouldn't be able to control security or fit enough people round the pitch,\" says O'Sullivan. Their usual attendance of around 50 is expected to rise to between 800 and 1,000. They tried for the Olympic Stadium but it was already booked. \"Maybe,\" says O'Sullivan, \"Bruce Springsteen is in town.\"</p> <p>O'Sullivan works for a brand consultancy. There aren't any butchers, bakers or candlestick makers, but, in the best cup underdog tradition, the team come from all walks of life: there is a teacher, an accountant, an IT project manager, a carpenter, a recruitment consultant, an IT programmer, a physiotherapist, a telecoms salesman, a subway driver and a bunch of students. The manager, Stuart Lascelles, runs a gym.</p> <p>Most will work on the day of the game \u2013 and the morning after, too, even if it seems fair to suggest that productivity will not be at an all-time high as the events and the drinks of the previous night swirl round their heads.</p> <p>Langholmen were entered into the Swedish Cup by virtue of making the final of last season's Stockholm Cup. Victories in the first two rounds took them into the last 64, the point at which the big sides join the draw. \"We hoped for a big club but thought we'd probably get some team nobody had heard of,\" O'Sullivan says. \"When it happened I was at work and got a text from one my team-mates, which said: 'Have you seen it?' I'd completely forgotten about the draw so I replied: 'Have I seen what? What are you on about? You're freaking&#xa0;me out.' Then all hell broke loose. It was pandemonium.\"</p> <p>SVT, the Swedish equivalent of the BBC, have interviewed the team on a number of occasions. They were on the national news, and even trended on Twitter for a few hours last week. They have had shirts reprinted for the game with additional sponsorship, while a local Welsh and Irish butchers will put on a barbecue at the game.</p> <p>\"This is what we've been working towards for 10 years,\" says the chairman, Mats Gustavsson. \"We are ambitious, we set ourselves high standards, and in many ways this high-profile opportunity is a reflection of all the hard work put into the club by a dedicated band of members and&#xa0;supporters.\"</p> <p>As such there will be an inevitable rush for souvenirs at the final whistle. \"What is the general etiquette of shirt swapping at the end of a game these days?\" O'Sullivan asks. \"They won't want our shirts will they? But I quite fancy one of theirs \u2026\"</p>",
  "<p>The international diplomatic row over WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange \u2013 who is avoiding extradition to Sweden by taking refuge in the Ecuadorean embassy in London \u2013 was escalating as Ecuador continued to push for the support of its South American neighbours.</p> <p>Having secured an emergency meeting of the Organisation of American States over what Ecuador says is Britain's threat to invade its embassy in London to arrest Assange, the Ecuadoreans are pushing for similar meetings of the Union of South American Nations, the left-leaning Alba association of Bolivarian states and the UN.</p> <p>On the agenda for the OAS meeting will be both Ecuador's claims that the UK has threatened the principle of \"inviolable\" status of its embassy in the UK and demands that the UK grant \"safe passage\" for Assange out of the UK.</p> <p>As Assange prepared to give a statement on his situation \u2013 reportedly outside the embassy, where he could face arrest for breach of his bail conditions \u2013 the row over Britain's veiled threat that it could enter the embassy to arrest him appeared to escalate.</p> <p>On Friday the OAS voted to hold a meeting next Friday following Ecuador's decision to grant political asylum to Assange. Assange has described the move as a \"historic victory\" but the foreign secretary, William Hague, made it clear that the Australian would not be allowed safe passage out of the country.</p> <p>The latest developments came as the Australian government released redacted logs under a Freedom of Information request detailing its deliberations over the Assange case. Included in the documents is the Australian government's legal view that any US attempt to prosecute Assange under the Espionage Act \u2013 which Assange says he fears \u2013 would face \"serious obstacles\".</p> <p>The released cables also appear to directly contradict Assange's claims that he had sought asylum with Ecuador because Australia had \"abandoned\" him by refusing to intervene in his planned extradition.</p> <p>Officials claim he has been contacted eight times by consular officials while in the embassy. The sources added that far from refusing Assange help, it was Assange who had declined Australian assistance.</p> <p>Assange has been in the embassy for two months after facing extradition to Sweden to be questioned on claims of sexual assault. He denies the claims and says he fears being sent to the US if he goes to Sweden.</p> <p>The decision by the OAS to debate the affair follows a letter from the Foreign Office to Ecuadorean authorities, warning it believed it had a legal basis to arrest Assange in the embassy, interpreted by Ecuador as a threat to raid the building \u2013 although this has been denied by the UK which says it prefers a \"negotiated outcome\".</p> <p>The US, Canada and Trinidad and Tobago opposed the resolution, but 23 members voted in favour of the meeting. There were five abstentions and three members were absent. OAS secretary general Jos\u00e9 Miguel Insulza said the meeting would be about \"the problem posed by the threat or warning made to Ecuador by the possibility of an intervention into its embassy\".</p> <p>He added: \"What is being proposed is that the foreign ministers of our organisation address this subject and not the subject of asylum nor whether it should be granted to Mr Julian Assange. That will be discussed between Great Britain and Ecuador. The issue that concerns us is the inviolability of diplomatic missions of all members of this organisation.\"</p> <p>Ecuador's president, Rafael Correa, said in a radio interview on Friday that his nation was not trying to undermine Sweden's attempts to question Assange. He said: \"The main reason why Julian Assange was given diplomatic asylum was because his extradition to a third country was not guaranteed; in no way was it done to interrupt the investigations of Swedish justice over an alleged crime. In no way.\"</p> <p>Hague has said that diplomatic immunity should not be used to harbour alleged criminals. He said it is a \"matter of regret\" that the Ecuadorean government granted the WikiLeaks founder political asylum but warned that it \"does not change the fundamentals\" of the case.</p> <p>The case could go on for some \"considerable\" time, Hague said, adding: \"We will not allow Mr Assange safe passage out of the United Kingdom, nor is there any legal basis for us to do so.\"</p> <p>Ecuadorean ministers have accused the UK of threatening to attack the embassy to seize Assange, after it emerged that the Diplomatic and Consular Premises Act 1987 could allow revocation of a building's diplomatic status if the foreign power occupying it \"ceases to use land for the purposes of its mission or exclusively for the purposes of a consular post\".</p> <p>But Hague said: \"There is no threat here to storm an embassy. We are talking about an Act of Parliament in this country which stresses that it must be used in full conformity with international law.\"</p> <p>The Swedish foreign ministry said that it had summoned Ecuador's ambassador over the Latin American country's \"unacceptable\" decision to grant asylum to Assange.</p>",
  "<!-- Block 1 --> <p><strong>Preamble</strong> Preamble? You want a <em>preamble</em>? It's the Saturday of the Lord's Test, the sun is burning, everything is at stake and a kid is 28 runs away from a moment that would melt the hardest heart. There's your preamble!</p> <p>(Yes, yes I am running a bit late.)</p> <!-- Block 2 --> <p><strong>Take the most exacting day's work</strong> of your life, multiply it by a thousand and you're still nowhere near what Jonny Bairstow went through yesterday. It will be such a challenge for him to get past this first hour, not least because, if he gets through the first eight overs, he will then have to contend with the second new ball. That new-ball period may well decide this match.</p> <!-- Block 3 --> <p><strong>73rd over: England 210-5 (in reply to South Africa's 309; Bairstow 74, Prior 22)</strong> It's a glorious day at Lord's, absolutely perfect. There will be some sore, pink shoulders in north west London at 7pm. Jacques Kallis is going to bowl the first over of the day, which shows that South Africa have an eye on that new ball. Bairstow tucks him through midwicket for two, the first runs of the day.</p> <!-- Block 4 --> <p><strong>74th over: England 211-5 (in reply to South Africa's 309; Bairstow 74, Prior 23)</strong> It'll be Morne Morkel at the other end. That might seem unusual, in that Dale Steyn doesn't take the new ball at the start of the innings, but that's because of the two left-handers at the top of the order and Morkel's hold over Strauss. Steyn will take the second new ball because there will probably be two right-handers. Even if Stuart Broad is in, Steyn won't mind. Morkel starts with an excellent, tight line to Prior, giving him no room to free his arms. Prior pushes a single to cover to end an excellent over.</p> <p>\"Crucial session this,\" says Peter Haines. \"What a perfect set-up for the Saturday of the Lord's Test \u2013 this is definitely the sporting highlight of the year. Oh, and it seems that South Africa did end the career of a third England captain; it's just that it's Pietersen, not Strauss.\" With every passing day, the chances of him playing for England again seem to recede.</p> <!-- Block 5 --> <p><strong>75th over: England 211-5 (in reply to South Africa's 309; Bairstow 74, Prior 23)</strong> This is a fine, disciplined start from South Africa. Their line to Prior has been extremely good, and that's a maiden from Kallis. The camera cuts to a couple drinking champagne in the crowd, at 11.09am. \"You can't afford to be dehydrated in this weather...\" says Sir Ian Botham on Sky. What a day to be at Lord's. It's absolutely perfect. There's a lovely, respectful hush around the ground.</p> <p>\"They've got to say to themselves, runs don't matter this morning,\" says Chris Evans. \"Be 260 for five at lunch and be 150 ahead at the close.\" Tell that to Matt Prior. I know what you mean, although I'm not sure it would be wise for Prior, or indeed Bairstow, to play such an unnatural game.</p> <!-- Block 6 --> <p><strong>76th over: England 215-5 (in reply to South Africa's 309; Bairstow 78, Prior 23)</strong> Morkel is a touch too full and straight, the first bad ball of the day, and Bairstow drags him through midwicket for four. He's 22 away from one of the great feelgood centuries of the last decade. Please please please let him get what he wants.</p> <p>\"Eff being 260/5 at lunch,\" says Josh Robinson. \"Being 360/8 would be fine. More than fine, obviously, given the other ways in which batting in that style might turn out.\"</p> <!-- Block 7 --> <p><strong>77th over: England 216-5 (in reply to South Africa's 309; Bairstow 78, Prior 24)</strong> South Africa are giving Prior absolutely nothing to work with here. Their plan is to control the scoreboard until the second new ball, and they've done it very well; there have been eight runs from five overs this morning.</p> <!-- Block 8 --> <p><strong>78th over: England 219-5 (in reply to South Africa's 309; Bairstow 80, Prior 25)</strong> Bairstow works Morkel through midwicket for a couple to move into the eighties. \"STOP talking about a possible c*****y!!\" says David Ward.</p> <!-- Block 9 --> <p><strong>79th over: England 220-5 (in reply to South Africa's 309; Bairstow 80, Prior 26)</strong> Tahir bowls a token over before the new ball in the hope he can snare Prior for the third time in the series. He doesn't. The camera cuts to more people drinking pink champagne. The gits. That's right: <em>gits</em>.</p> <p>\"Is it arguable that Onions and Monty in the side for Broad and Swann would make the team stronger?\" says Jatinder Sahota. \"This is especially the case with Swann who I think has been below par for a while now. Finn may not be as good a bat as Bresnan but by keeping him out of the team until now surely England weakened themselves overall \u2013 and doesn't the same principle apply?\" You could certainly make that case, although it's moot because there is no chance of England ever going in with a tail of Finn, Anderson, Onions and Panesar. Good for last-day rearguards, I suppose, but I'm not sure about them actually scoring any runs. Onions is a fascinating bowler. I know Selve thought he would have been a good option in this game, and he took a couple for Durham the other day. In a different era he would already have 100 Test wickets.</p> <!-- Block 10 --> <p><strong>80th over: England 221-5 (in reply to South Africa's 309; Bairstow 80, Prior 27)</strong> Dale Steyn is coming on. He'll have one over to get loose with the old ball \u2013&#xa0;and he makes it talk, snapping a beauty past Prior's outside edge. The next goes past the edge too, although that one didn't really deviate. Prior has made five from 26 balls this morning, a reflection of South Africa's disciplined line.</p> <!-- Block 11 --> <p><strong>WICKET! England 221-6 (Prior c Kallis b Philander 27)</strong> Pour yourself some pink champagne, get behind the sofa, do whatever you need to do because it's time for the second new ball \u2013 possibly the decisive period of the entire series. And Prior has gone first ball! Oh for heaven's sake. He had a big drive at a seductive outswinger from Philander that flew off the edge to Kallis at second slip. It was really travelling but Kallis held on, as he always does. Matt Prior will not, it's fair to say, tell his grandchildren about that stroke. It was a minor shocker.</p> <!-- Block 12 --> <p><strong>81st over: England 221-6 (in reply to South Africa's 309; Bairstow 80, Broad 0)</strong> England could get cleaned up here. Stuart Broad, the new batsman, <a href=\"http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/player/10617.html?class=1;template=results;type=batting;view=reverse_cumulative\">really needs a few runs</a>. Philander is getting the new ball to swing appreciably, although his line to the left-hander isn't right at the moment. He moves around the wicket as a result and has a huge shout for LBW turned down when Broad misses a yorker. They have to review this surely? No, Graeme Smith has decided against it. It swung a long way so it might have slipped down the leg side, but that was really close. Hawkeye shows that it was missing leg. That's an excellent bit of judgement from Smith and the keeper AB de Villiers. A wicket maiden from Philander, and an ominous one for England.</p> <!-- Block 13 --> <p><strong>82nd over: England 225-6 (in reply to South Africa's 309; Bairstow 84, Broad 0)</strong> Bairstow times Steyn nicely through the covers for four. Steyn is getting the ball to swing as well, so this is going to be a serious challenge for the England batsmen. If you offered Andy Flower and Andrew Strauss a total of 300 now in exchange for their deepest, darkest secrets, I reckon they'd sing like canaries.</p> <p>\"There's no need for pink champage envy Rib,\" begins Duncan Smith, promisingly. \"I am quite sure, from your rarified position you could easily start a JustGiving page. I think all of us here on the obo value you enough to contribute funds for a bottle of Lambrusco and some cochineal.\" If you make it Lambrini it's a deal.</p> <!-- Block 14 --> <p><strong>83rd over: England 228-6 (in reply to South Africa's 309; Bairstow 86, Broad 1)</strong> Philander goes back over the wicket to Broad, who flick-pulls pleasantly for a single to get off the mark. Then Bairstow steals a second to long leg. He has been excellent between the wickets in this innings. Here's an interesting stat (which may well be meaningless in a few minutes, but still). In the last 30 years, <a href=\"http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/stats/index.html?agemax1=22;ageval1=age;class=1;filter=advanced;orderby=start;orderbyad=reverse;runsmin1=100;runsval1=runs;team=1;template=results;type=batting;view=innings\">only two men have scored Test centuries for England before their 23rd birthday</a>: Mike Atherton and Alastair Cook. <a href=\"http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/stats/index.html?agemax1=22;ageval1=age;class=1;filter=advanced;orderby=start;orderbyad=reverse;runsmin1=100;runsval1=runs;team=1;template=results;type=batting\">And only 13 players have done it overall</a>.</p> <p>\"Every ball, every ball is so, so tense,\" says Gary Naylor. \"And they say a T20 innings is 120 events.\"</p> <!-- Block 15 --> <p><strong>84th over: England 232-6 (in reply to South Africa's 309; Bairstow 86, Broad 5)</strong> Broad normally likes to counter-attack, although the context makes that extremely difficult. He is beaten by Steyn, chasing a wide one off the back foot when he should have been forward, and then pings a crisp cover drive for four. England trail by 77.</p> <p>\"Also, you can tell Broad knows he's batting terribly at the moment. He hasn't even been hogging the reviews like he normally does,\" says Elliot Carr-Barnsley. \"A year or so ago he'd be waving his arms like a semaphore operative even if his middle stump was hurtling towards the slips.\"</p> <!-- Block 16 --> <p><strong>85th over: England 236-6 (in reply to South Africa's 309; Bairstow 90, Broad 5)</strong> That's a lovely stroke from Bairstow, a stiff-wristed crunch through midwicket for four off Philander. He's into the nineties. <em>He's into the bloody nineties</em>. There isn't a dry nail in the house.</p> <p>\"Oh balls,\" says Guy Hornsby, suddenly recalling The Bad Thing from last night. \"That's got to be galling for Prior. Right up there with finishing fourth in the marathon, running out of paint when you get to the last part of the wall, treading on an upturned plug, and writing your best OBO mail ever only to send it in after the close of play. Are the pavilion windows intact? The balance is back with South Africa again surely. This is such a <strong>PROPER</strong> Test match. Bairstow looking for a ton, Broad in need of sensible runs, England looking for a lead and South Africa looking for a lead. It doesn't get much better than this really. This is the Flamin' Hot Monster Munch of Test matches.\"</p> <!-- Block 17 --> <p><strong>86th over: England 243-6 (in reply to South Africa's 309; Bairstow 94, Broad 8)</strong> Broad drives Steyn on the up through extra cover for three. I wonder what Jonny Bairstow's pulse rate is right now. Whatever it was, it's just gone up a bit more: he is beaten by a jaffa from Steyn and edges the next ball wide of the slips for four. I don't think it would have carried anyway, but it was a genuine edge. Does anyone have any beta blockers I can borrow for the next 20 minutes?</p> <p>\"I must confess to being more nervous watching this than I was on my wedding day, at the birth of my children or being swabbed at immigration at Auckland airport,\" says Phil Withall, to the delight of his wife, his children and the crack swab team at Auckland airport. \"Please let young Bairstow do it, please.</p> <!-- Block 18 --> <p><strong>87th over: England 251-6 (in reply to South Africa's 309; Bairstow 94, Broad 16)</strong> Broad shovels the new bowler Morkel off the hip for a couple, with Steyn doing very well to save the boundary. Sometimes, when you see those boundary saves, you think, <em>All that for one or two runs</em>. Not in this game. Every run is a precious thing \u2013 and Broad gets four more with a superbly timed squirt through point. A drag through midwicket for two takes England past 250. The unspoken intensity of this Test match is just wonderful.</p> <!-- Block 19 --> <p><strong>WICKET! England 252-7 (Broad c Amla b Steyn 16)</strong> That's the end of Broad's cameo. Steyn dug in an excellent, straight short ball that Broad could only push gently to Amla at short leg. It was all strangely straightforward, and Steyn barely bothered to celebrate. Those are decent runs from Broad, though, 16 from 22 balls. South Africa lead by 57.</p> <!-- Block 20 --> <p><strong>88th over: England 253-7 (in reply to South Africa's 309; Bairstow 95, Swann 1)</strong> Swann is greeted with a zesty short ball that trampolines past his not inconsiderable chin. \"Can Bairstow please get his century so I can start concentrating on the research I am trying to do in the British Library?\" says Eva Broer. \"This is too tense to be able to focus on some 16th century popes and their taste in art...\"</p> <!-- Block 21 --> <p><strong>89th over: England 254-7 (in reply to South Africa's 309; Bairstow 95, Swann 2)</strong> On the England balcony, Andrew Strauss is munching on his right fingernail. He's really tucking in too. Everyone is so desperate for Bairstow to do this. South Africa are prolonging the moment, with Morkel bowling temptingly wide of off stump. Bairstow is not tempted.</p> <p>\"Perhaps Duncan Smith would like to <a href=\"http://www.justgiving.com/stephfincham2/eurl.axd/596549cb73f2de4aab62940f5aa2cb41\">contribute to my JustGiving page as you don't have one</a>?\" says my colleague Steph Fincham. \"I'll be cycling across Rajasthan in February to raise money for the children's cancer charity CLIC Sargent...\"</p> <!-- Block 22 --> <p><strong>90th over: England 262-7 (in reply to South Africa's 309; Bairstow 95, Swann 10)</strong> Swann slashes Steyn up and over the cordon for four. The response is an angry short ball that Swann pulls contemptuously for four more! At the risk of asserting the bleedin' obvious, this is great stuff. In other news, some other news from India: VVS Laxman, one of the more beautiful batsmen we've ever seen, <a href=\"http://www.espncricinfo.com/india-v-new-zealand-2012/content/current/story/578096.html\">has retired from international cricket</a>.</p> <p>\"On TMS they just mentioned how good a throwing arm Steyn has from the deep,\" says John Starbuck. \"I suspect it's because he's an expert at the wrist action \u2013 have you noticed how he whips the wrist down at the moment of delivery? It's a lot more pronounced than anyone else's in this game, almost on a par with a mainstream spinner.\" That's a good point. Flintoff had a notable snap of the wrist as well.</p> <!-- Block 23 --> <p><strong>91st over: England 262-7 (in reply to South Africa's 309; Bairstow 95, Swann 10)</strong> Bairstow fresh-airs a woolly cut stroke at a very wide delivery from Morkel. He does exactly the same next ball. \"Settle boy, settle,\" pleads David Gower on Sky. When Bairstow leaves the next ball, there is extravagant applause from the crowd. I can't remember the last time when everyone was so desperate for an England batsman to make a century. Graham Thorpe in 2003 maybe? South Africa are expertly prolonging his stay in the nineties, bowling wide of off stump for the most part. It's a maiden from Morkel, who has been outstanding this morning. Bairstow has already faced 21 deliveries in the nineties.</p> <!-- Block 24 --> <p><strong>REVIEW! England 264-7 (Swann not out 12)</strong> The marvellous Dale Steyn strikes again! Swann is going to review it \u2013 there are two left, so he may as well \u2013 but he's in trouble here. He pushed down the wrong line of a good delivery that jagged back into him. But Hawkeye says it was bouncing over the stumps! Swann survives! What a bonus for England. I think Swann thought he was out and only reviewed it because there were two left.</p> <!-- Block 25 --> <p><strong>92nd over: England 264-7 (in reply to South Africa's 309; Bairstow 95, Swann 12)</strong> \"Prior's dismissal means he is currently second in both the England batting aggregates and averages to he who shall not be named, who is also top of England's bowling averages,\" says Graem Peters. \"At the end of the series, the head coaches are each allowed to choose the opposition player of the series. It would be interesting to see what would happen if Kirsten chose Kevin Pietersen.\" Crikey, that's a good point. It wouldn't quite be up there with Mohammad Amir two years ago but it would still be uncomfortable. They might give it to Anderson, whose series average of 41.85 is a travesty.</p> <!-- Block 26 --> <p><strong>WICKET! England 264-8 (Bairstow b Morkel 95)</strong> English cricket has just had its heart broken. Jonny Bairstow has gone for 95, cleaned up by an excellent full-length delivery from Morne Morkel. Bairstow tried to whip it to leg but it ducked back in and burst through his defences. He walks off to a standing ovation for an immense innings, and if you're not moved by this, you don't have an anima. We must be two-eyed and say that it was majestic bowling from Morkel, who kept Bairstow in the nineties and then bowled him with a beauty. Bairstow made only one run in his last 40 minutes at the crease.</p> <!-- Block 27 --> <p><strong>93rd over: England 266-8 (in reply to South Africa's 309; Swann 12, Anderson 2)</strong> Crikey. This email, which must have been stuck in a jam on the information superhighway, is accompanied by big dollops of sadness. \"Irrespective of whether he gets his hundred, this has been a terrific innings by Bairstow,\" says SB Tang. \"He's shown guts, determination and no small amount of skill under the most difficult of circumstances. It's safe to say that he's booked his ticket to India this winter.\" That will be a big tour for him, because he had problems there in the ODIs last year. I suppose the seven batsmen in the squad could be the six from this game plus Bopara.</p> <!-- Block 28 --> <p><strong>94th over: England 268-8 (in reply to South Africa's 309; Swann 12, Anderson 2)</strong> Graeme Swann did make 85 against South Africa back in 2009-10. England would take half that here, even a third of it. He may as well tee off and try to get as close to 300 as possible. Give it some humpty, it's the weekend.</p> <p>Here's Tom Bowtell. \"On TMS, Blowers, apropos of something, just said: 'Geoffrey Boycott has a corridor of uncertainty in his bed'.\" Oh that is magnificent.</p> <!-- Block 29 --> <p><strong>95th over: England 274-8 (in reply to South Africa's 309; Swann 13, Anderson 7)</strong> Anderson gloves a grisly short ball from Morkel short of slip \u2013 his hand was off the bat, Mr Tucker \u2013 and then drives three through mid on. There is plenty of chat between Morkel and Anderson, two gentle souls who get in character as soon as they enter the field. South Africa lead by 35.</p> <p>\"I must say,\" says Josh Robinson, \"there was something wonderfully reassuring about the way Bairstow got out: it showed me that I can at least play around a<br>straight one just like a Test batsman, even if it usually happens much earlier in my innings.\"</p> <!-- Block 30 --> <p><strong>96th over: England 276-8 (in reply to South Africa's 309; Swann 14, Anderson 8)</strong> Philander replaces Steyn, who bowled a fine spell of 8-1-28-1. Anderson steals a run to mid off. Every little helps. \"What an innings Bairstow played and it would be a huge surprise if he isn't a fixture in the team for the next ten years,\" says Mark Lloyd, who has quite the memory on him. \"Back in the dark days of 1989 <a href=\"http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/current/match/63508.html\">I was lucky enough to be at Lord's</a> to see a David Gower Ashes hundred but the innings I remember more is Robin Smith's 96. Terry Alderman denied him a maiden hundred with a beauty that nipped back and bowled him. I remember at the time wondering if that would be the closest Smith ever got to a Test century. I only hope Bairstow ends up a) becoming as important to England as Smith became, and b) being treated better than Smith was by the selectors. Hats off to the young man!\"</p> <p>I can't find a clip of that dismissal, but here's a bit of Alderman action from 1989, when he was close to unplayable. <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBG1pSMgTnw\">I suppose it helps if you actually try to play him</a>.</p> <!-- Block 31 --> <p><strong>97th over: England 277-8 (in reply to South Africa's 309; Swann 14, Anderson 8)</strong> Anderson is rapped painfully on the left elbow by Morkel. You could see all the muscles pulsating at the point of contact. He's getting some treatment, although he doesn't seem especially perturbed. This delay will ensure that this is the last over before lunch. Anderson plays out those two deliveries to end another brilliant session of Test cricket. South Africa were outstanding, making England fight for every run, and they lead by 32. Jonny Bairstow was dismissed five runs short of a maiden Test century. Like the man said, it's been emotional. Rob Bagchi will be here for the afternoon session; email him on <a href=\"mailto:rob.bagchi@theguardian.com\">rob.bagchi@theguardian.com</a>.</p> <!-- Block 32 --> <p><strong>LUNCH</strong> Afternoon all. Here's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/aug/18/vvs-laxman-retires-india-international-cricket\">our story on the retirement of VVS Laxman</a> which, I think, is an inevitable consequence of his recent form but nonetheless saddens me that I won't see him bat again. At his best he had a dreamlike quality of composure when well-set, the ability to transform a commonplace shot such as a leg-glance into a thing of charm and a handsome ease at piercing the infield that kept the scoreboard moving at a pace that perplexed the assumptions of bowler and spectator alike. </p> <p>Rob Wright has invaded Selve's inner sanctum, which is more than I have done as he notes: \"Just had a tour of the Lord's media centre, including the bit where all the papers do their OBOs. I excitedly enquired whether Rob Smyth and Rob Bagchi might be there, and was met with a blank stare. Met Boycott and Gower though.\" We're in Kings Cross, Rob, which allows us the scope to moonlight on football later this afternoon though we'd much prefer to be there.</p> <!-- Block 33 --> <p><strong>Wicket!! Anderson c Rudolph b Steyn 12</strong> Fending off the fourth short ball he's faced, the last of this over, he takes his eyes off it and dollies it up for third slip to run six feet in and catch it.</p> <!-- Block 34 --> <p><strong>98th over: England 283-9 (in reply to South Africa's 309; Swann 17, Finn 0)</strong> An enthralling morning session with honours just about even, England scoring 67 for the loss of three wickets and some supreme bowling from Morne Morkel. Steyn begins from the Pavilion End, dishing up another elbow polka for Anderson who is now wearing a bandage covered by a sweatband on his bruised left funny bone. The first three balls are all short of a length, Anderson stepping to leg and cut-pushing the last of them to third man where the fielder's slip gives England three. Steyn finally pitches one up to Swann who tucks in with an on-drive to within a foot of the rope and they run three more. Anderson is out from the last ball of the over, <strong>England 26 behind</strong>.</p> <!-- Block 35 --> <p><strong>99th over: England 291-9 (in reply to South Africa's 309; Swann 23, Finn 2)</strong> Tahir comes on to toy with Finn's mind. Swann takes a single off the first ball and Finn accomplishes himself well to get off the mark with a toppling sweep. The batsmen swap singles again, leaving Swann on strike for the last ball and he belts it over midwicket for four.</p> <!-- Block 36 --> <p><strong>100th over: England 293-9 (in reply to South Africa's 309; Swann 23, Finn 4)</strong> Steyn peppers Finn but he gets in line to play it off his chest well short of short leg. The next one is another bouncer, not played so well, Finn fending it to where silly point might have been placed. Next Steyn pitches it up, drifts to leg and Finn tucks him away for two. This short stuff eventually worked for Anderson and Broad but it's a relentless, bullying strategy and the umpires let it pass. Finn withdraws the bat from the last ball of the over, another half-tracker, and it glances him on the shoulder on its way through to De Villiers.</p> <!-- Block 37 --> <p><strong>101st over: England 294-9 (in reply to South Africa's 309; Swann 24, Finn 4)</strong> Philander, buttock knack and all, replaces Tahir after the leggie's solitary over. Swann pushes a single and puts Finn back on strike. Big Vern is bowling Broad pace and surprises himself and Finn with low bounce to which the batsman shows the maker's name. He gets in line, Finn. If he's a rabbit he's not the kind that runs down a hole by the square leg umpire.</p> <!-- Block 38 --> <p><strong>102nd over: England 297-9 (in reply to South Africa's 309; Swann 25, Finn 4)</strong> Swann has Steve Waugh-like confidence in his partner, taking another single off the first ball of an over. A \"red-inker\", chides Nasser Hussain. At times like this Steyn looks like a shark, all nose and teeth and cold, cold eyes. What a magnificent and vicious bowler he is, though, smacking Finn on the helmet behind his ear and they take a leg-bye. A few inches lower and that ball would have put Finn in hospital. At last Swann farms the bowling, swatting a cut off the top half of the bat down to backward point and running one to end the over.</p> <!-- Block 39 --> <p><strong>103rd over: England 298-9 (in reply to South Africa's 309; Swann 26, Finn 4)</strong> Philander looks as stiff as a scarecrow but gamely soldiers on. No swing. \"Without wishing to underplay the quality of Bairstow's innings, and its importance in the context, aren't people being a bit premature in taking it to show that he's sure to be a success in Test cricket now?\" writes David Wall. \"That's one success in four matches when in the previous ones he looked pretty unconvincing. Moreover, as it turned out, his innings sadly fell short of being decisive in the match. England do have to win, after all. That's not to say it's not a good sign, and I hope he does continue to show the resilience and quality he showed here, but he wouldn't be the first who failed to build on early promise.\" He wouldn't David but what was encouraging was the signs that he'd taken on board the weaknesses West Indies exposed and done something about it. \"What is a sure sign of quality (in a different field, of course) is the way Blowers just used 'tautological' in his commentary on TMS in a throwaway fashion\" he continues. \"It's a sad reminder that we're going to have to endure Jonathan Pearce and Alan Green for the next nine months.\"</p> <!-- Block 40 --> <p><strong>104th over: England 303-9 (in reply to South Africa's 309; Swann 26, Finn 8)</strong> Finn sways out of the way of one that goes past his chin so Steyn comes round the wicket, bounces him, and Finn hooks him for four. \"Oh right,\" writes Dale Slater. \"When Steyn goes short he's bullying and you're looking for intervention from the umpires. When Anderson and Finn are relentlessly short to Steyn in bad light and floodlight failure, it's a strategy of some merit. The only bullying that's going on here is those who control the means of communication taking advantage of it to reinforce their own little prejudices and pop a few more bricks in their wall of stereotypes.\" Wow. When did I say bullying in a cricket context was a bad thing? I said it was relentless and understandable given it did for Anderson and Broad and that umpires these days don't do anything about it, not that they \"should\".</p> <!-- Block 41 --> <p><strong>105th over: England 308-9 (in reply to South Africa's 309; Swann 32, Finn 8)</strong> Swann leans into an off-drive, eyes wide, and smashes a four over mid-off from Philander's slightly overpitched third delivery. \"Crucial session this,\" writes Peter Hanes. \"Swann's hitting and Finn's bravery are raising England's spirits, but they could be up against it if South Africa make the most of the good batting conditions now. This is great cricket.\" It is.</p> <!-- Block 42 --> <p><strong>106th over: England 312-9 (in reply to South Africa's 309; Swann 35, Finn 9)</strong> England draw level when Swann leg-glances Steyn for a single and ahead when Finn prods one into the off-side.</p> <!-- Block 43 --> <p><strong>107th over: England 314-9 (in reply to South Africa's 309; Swann 36, Finn 10)</strong> Smith drops Finn at first slip, a straightforward chance that bursts through his hands and into his chest. Finn runs a single as the ball cannons of towards leg gully. \"Knowing words like 'tautological' doesn't mean you can't have a howler or two,\" writes John Starbuck. \"Blowers this afternoon has already failed to identify 'turbine' as the modern kind of windmill and also said he'd never seen a bat in the form of a cake. Me too.\" He was on tip top pork pie eulogising form on Thursday. Ian Copestake says: \"The key to bringing the literacy level of footer commentary up to and beyond that of cricket is by unleashing the glories of Stuart Hall at every possible match. He would eat tautologies for lunch and make a feast of his own alliterative biscuits.\" A gem:<br>\"On his firm Stuart Hall International Travel: 'I've never been brilliant in business. If you have an artistic bent, you're never going to be good at the logistics of business. I've no time for all that. I'm the man who ran $hit Travel - what a great venture that was.'</p> <!-- Block 44 --> <p><strong>Wicket!! Finn c Duminy b Morkel 10</strong> <strong>England are all out for 315, six runs ahead</strong>. Morkel copped him with a slower ball, his bat through the uppercut too soon and slicing it up to Duminy at point. Swann's vital innings ended on 37 not out.</p> <!-- Block 45 --> <p><strong>Innings break</strong></p> <!-- Block 46 --> <p><strong>1st over: South Africa 0-0 (England lead by six runs on first innings; Petersen 0, Smith 0)</strong> Anderson begins to Petersen with his tail up and mithering about the indent/foothold on the crease where his left foot lands. Smyth has sent me a stat that none of the last 24 Lord's Test have been won by the team trailing on first innings. Interesting but as he points out, probably means nothing in this context. Every ball bar the last is on an outside-off line but the sixth hurries Petersen into a drive that squirts off the edge towards cover. On come the ground staff with their saw dust to fix the hole.</p> <!-- Block 47 --> <p><strong>2nd over: South Africa 2-0 (England lead by six runs on first innings; Petersen 1, Smith 1)</strong> Dale Slater's been back on. \"Point was, that whenever an English journalist hears the words 'South Africa' he finds in his Book of Cliches that the true meaning of the phrase is 'Nasty Bully' - just as surely as he finds the word 'Englishman' actually denotes 'Plucky lad grinding on against incredible odds'! Honestly, you reach for these phrases with Pavlovian predictability; you don't even know you're doing it!\" And he who seeks prejudice where there is none, what is he? Have you read the respect and admiration we've shown for South Africa throughout this series? Or taken the word \"bullying\" and inflated it for all its worth to pander to your sense of victimhood? Smith plays a loose hook of Broad from a ball that was wider and bounced higher than he initially thought. He gets enough on it to clear midwicket and it drops like a stone 30ft in from the boundary.</p> <!-- Block 48 --> <p><strong>3rd over: South Africa 6-0 (England lead by six runs on first innings; Petersen 5, Smith 1)</strong> Glorious whipped shot from Petersen through midwicket for four. Anderson was looking for outswing and the edge but it didn't deviate. The fifth ball of his over did, though, jagging away from Petersen's forward defensive and into Prior's hands. The England players' squeals are louder than the crowd's.</p> <!-- Block 49 --> <p><strong>4th over: South Africa 7-0 (England lead by six runs on first innings; Petersen 5, Smith 2)</strong> Huge appeal from Broad when he thinks he's got Petersen leg-before with the batsman prodding around the ball but he got an inside edge, as the replay confirmed. \"It may be worth mentioning that Blowers only used 'tautological' to try and dig himself out of the hole he'd dug by saying Finn had got himself tucked up in 'angular angles',\" writes Hugh Barker. Those pesky angular angles.</p> <!-- Block 50 --> <p><strong>5th over: South Africa 12-0 (England lead by six runs on first innings; Petersen 9, Smith 3)</strong> Forgot to mention that South Africa had knocked off the deficit in the third over and had now moved into the black. Anderson comes round the wicket to Smith and he plays that trusty shovel shot around the corner and takes the single. David Gower thinks England are playing to his strengths because he's also vulnerable with that shot early in his innings. Anderson's got the face on, more so when Petersen plays a majestic cut for four.</p> <!-- Block 51 --> <p><strong>6th over: South Africa 17-0 (England lead by six runs on first innings; Petersen 13, Smith 4)</strong> Broad resumes after a length chat with Anderson and then much gesturing from third slip with Fingerbobs hands to show him how the ball should be moving. He bounces Smith first up but then strays too straight, allowing Smith to turn it to square leg. He tosses the next ball up to Petersen, who smacks him through the covers for four. Time for Finn. Smith changes his bowlers much quicker than Strauss does.</p> <!-- Block 52 --> <p><strong>7th over: South Africa 17-0 (England lead by six runs on first innings; Petersen 13, Smith 4)</strong> Anderson bowls one of Boycott's \"lollipop bouncers\" to Smith who has an age to duck out of the way. \"Just to clarify, it wasn't the word 'tautological' that was nice about that bit of commentary but the completely natural, throwaway way in which he used it (and why not, it's a perfectly cromulent word),\" writes David Wall. \"If Clive Tyldsley had used a similar word or phrase then he'd keep trying to work it into the rest of the commentary just to remind everyone how clever he'd been.\" Sorry. I'm anispeptic, frasmotic, even compunctuous to have caused you such pericombobulation. Smith chases another wide bouncer, hooking and top edging squarish but short of Ian Bell who stops the single.</p> <!-- Block 53 --> <p><strong>8th over: South Africa 20-0 (England lead by six runs on first innings; Petersen 14, Smith 6)</strong> It's still Broad, still barely breaking 80mph. Petersen taps a single through the legside and Strauss runs from slip to chat to him which, if it was meant to inspire him, doesn't as he bowls a wide long-hop outside leg stump. He drops short again and Smith hooks him off his visor, a neat controlled pull that the hare Bairstow prevents from going for four with a sprint and a slide. Richard Potter can stand for many of you on the subject of Dale Slater. \"He says: 'Honestly, you reach for these phrases with Pavlovian predictability.' That, Sir, is drivel, and you know it.\"</p> <!-- Block 54 --> <p><strong>9th over: South Africa 22-0 (England lead by six runs on first innings; Petersen 16, Smith 6)</strong> Big shout when Anderson traps Petersen on the pad, pushing forward. It hit him outside the line. More from proud Cantabrigian, Richard Potter: \"'angular angles' from Blowers was more oxymoronic than 'tautological'. Blowers from Cambridge would agree - Oxymorons are people from the other place \u2026\"</p> <!-- Block 55 --> <p><strong>10th over: South Africa 22-0 (England lead by six runs on first innings; Petersen 16, Smith 6)</strong> Swann comes into the attack and places a short-leg, short midwicket and slip for Smith. The bowler turns it from the start, enticing Smith, as is his wont, to hit against the spin towards square leg and midwicket, which he does a couple of times competently even if it excites Matt Prior enormously. Maiden.</p> <!-- Block 56 --> <p><strong>11th over: South Africa 24-0 (England lead by six runs on first innings; Petersen 17, Smith 7)</strong> White handle grips still look odd to me, you can't see the join with the gloves when Petersen hits powerfully. Anderson continues, looking rather mournful about the lack of consistent or even regular swing. \"Julian Barton de Courcy Thompson, who played for Kent in the 90s was a right arm quick bowler,\" writes Nick Mannion. He was actually South African and also a medical doctor \u2026 of gynaecology as it happens\u2026 Apparently he was/is the go to expert on the corridor of uncertainty.\" Fnarr.</p> <!-- Block 57 --> <p><strong>12th over: South Africa 24-0 (England lead by six runs on first innings; Petersen 17, Smith 7)</strong> Swann continues with his line of attack to Smith who again works the ball against the spin into the legside. He catches Petersen on the front leg prodding forward and appeals though it hit him outside the line, so Swann bowls a bit straighter.</p> <!-- Block 58 --> <p><strong>13th over: South Africa 31-0 (England lead by six runs on first innings; Petersen 18, Smith 13)</strong> \"Afternoon Bagchi, afternoon everybody,\" writes Josh/Johs Robinson. \"I think I've found a <strike> good </strike> use for Twitter. If an email is bad enough that even you won't publish it, one can tweet it to the good folks over at the Sofa, and they'll read it out to <strike> all </strike> their listeners. OK, so maybe there's a case to be made that emails that aren't good enough even to appear on the OBO are best left in Robinson's sent mail folder. Yes, I think I've convinced myself that that's actually yet another example of why Twitter is evil. It is the place where <a href=\"https://twitter.com/westendproducer/status/233463522045079552\">this</a> appeared, though.\" Unimprovably put by Wiggins. Finn takes over from Anderson. His first three balls are shortish and outside off, Smith playing and missing the first then clumping him for four with a bludgeoning cut.</p> <!-- Block 59 --> <p><strong>14th over: South Africa 32-0 (England lead by six runs on first innings; Petersen 19, Smith 13)</strong> Swann is devilishly interested in testing whether Smith can play against the spin with as much efficacy as he did at the Oval, trying to tempt him into an outside edge when playing across the line. So far Smith has had the upper hand. One more over before tea.</p> <!-- Block 60 --> <p><strong>15th over: South Africa 33-0 (England lead by six runs on first innings; Petersen 20, Smith 13)</strong> Finn comes in to Petersen with Nasser Hussain suggesting the tickle down the legside to the keeper is the dismissal they're aiming for and he does have a drive at one drifting across him that he misses and then gets off strike the next ball with a push to mid on. <strong>South Africa end the session 27 ahead</strong>. Thanks for all your emails, particularly Clare Davies and her detective work. Rob Smyth will be here for the evening session.</p> <!-- Block 61 --> <p><strong>TEA</strong></p> <!-- Block 62 --> <p><strong>Hello again</strong>. This doesn't look too pretty, does it. The new ball deviated about as much as a prissy nun, and unless England get some reverse swing they are going to find it very difficult to force a winning position. We'll have a pretty good idea of where the match is heading by the close; there are still 37 overs remaining in the day.</p> <!-- Block 63 --> <p><strong>Meanwhile, at the Oval</strong> <a href=\"http://www.espncricinfo.com/county-cricket-2012/engine/current/match/542535.html\">Just look at this</a>!</p> <!-- Block 64 --> <p><strong>16th over: South Africa 33-0 (England led by six runs on first innings; Petersen 20, Smith 13)</strong> England have around 100-120 overs from now to bowl South Africa out if they are to have a chance of winning the game. It really won't be easy as the pitch is a belter. Swann starts after tea to Petersen, with a slip and a short leg. It's a maiden.</p> <!-- Block 65 --> <p><strong>17th over: South Africa 34-0 (England led by six runs on first innings; Petersen 20, Smith 14)</strong> Despite his failure in the first innings, <a href=\"http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/stats/index.html?class=1;filter=advanced;ground=10;orderby=batting_average;qualmin1=2;qualval1=matches;template=results;type=batting\">Graeme Smith still has a three-figure average at Lord's</a>. He leaves a delivery from Steven Finn that isn't too far of off stump, although ultimately Smith knew what he was doing. He wasn't so sure next ball, when an attempted pull met only with still air. A good over from Finn.</p> <!-- Block 66 --> <p><strong>REVIEW! South Africa 34-0 (Smith not out 14)</strong> England have wasted a review. Smith was beaten by a beauty from Swann that ripped past the edge and the fielders behind the stumps (though not Swann) went up for caught behind. Kumar Dharmasena said not out \u2013 which I suppose is reason enough to review given his performance in this game \u2013 and replays showed there was daylight between bat and ball. There was more than a hint of desperation in that review.</p> <!-- Block 67 --> <p><strong>18th over: South Africa 34-0 (England led by six runs on first innings; Petersen 20, Smith 14)</strong> So what's England's minimum requirement in the remaining 35 overs? I suppose they would want at least two wickets, ideally three. \"On the subject of the photo at the top,\" says Mac Millings, \"I didn't know Naylor had taken up smoking.\" <a href=\"http://www1.pictures.zimbio.com/mp/kxNRKUFirF-l.jpg\">Here, for those who were wondering, is a picture of Mac Millings</a>.</p> <!-- Block 68 --> <p><strong>19th over: South Africa 35-0 (England led by six runs on first innings; Petersen 21, Smith 14)</strong> Petersen pulls Finn for a single. England do at least have control of the scoreboard, which is a quarter of the battle. If England are to somehow win this game it will probably come down to a time/runs equation. </p> <p>\"<a href=\"http://media.slated.org/displayimage.php?pid=119\">This is why I'm not showing my face in that picture</a>,\" says Mac Millings.</p> <!-- Block 69 --> <p><strong>20th over: South Africa 35-0 (England led by six runs on first innings; Petersen 21, Smith 14)</strong> Yet another maiden, from Swann to Petersen. His figures are 6-4-2-0. With many teams you'd say that this almost strokeless batting approach would be risky, but South Africa's top six have the discipline to bat forever, regardless of what the scoreboard is doing.</p> <p>\"Aaargh!\" says Phil Sawyer. \"Smyth, I hold you entirely responsible for the fall of that last Middlesex wicket. Lancashire desperately needed a Surrey defeat to at least keep within touching distance of avoiding relegation going into the fag end of the season, and the impossible was just starting to look possible until you went and flagged it up to the world. No hotpot for you.\"</p> <!-- Block 70 --> <p><strong>21st over: South Africa 42-0 (England led by six runs on first innings; Petersen 23, Smith 19)</strong> Smith back cuts Finn for the first boundary in eight overs. \"Getting twitchy at all the commentators jinxing the South African batsman with talk of their imperturbability,\" says Helen Musselman. It's not an attempt to jink them, just a sincere judgement as to how the game is developing. I'd be surprised if South Africa lost another wicket all match, never mind 10 by tea tomorrow.</p> <!-- Block 71 --> <p><strong>WICKET! South Africa 46-1 (Smith LBW b Swann 23)</strong> Graeme Swann has got him! I was just typing 'The certainty of Smith's batting is awe-inspiring and terrifying' when he went for an ugly sweep, missing it completely as the ball zipped on to hit the pad. Kumar Dharmasena raised the finger, and after a long discussion with Alviro Petersen, Smith decided to walk off without reviewing the decision. He was right to do so: Hawkeye showed the point of contact was 'umpire's call' and it was hitting the just below the off-and-middle stump bail. There was no need for Smith to play that shot. Blame it upon a rush of blood to the head.</p> <!-- Block 72 --> <p><strong>22nd over: South Africa 46-1 (England led by six runs on first innings; Petersen 23, Amla 0)</strong> The new batsman is Hashim Amla. He has struggled a little since that triple hundred at the Oval \u2013 his series average is an embarrassing 120.33. He defends his first ball from Swann, who has a lovely rhythm and figures of 7-4-6-1.</p> <p>\"I have a bottle of Joseph Perrier in the fridge for emergency celebrations,\" says Josh Robinson. \"I was planning on opening it when Bairstow got his ton, and after he fell for 95 I decided to open it when Middlesex hit the runs that consigned Surrey to defeat. Now I think I should decide to open it at the moment when South Africa's series victory is confirmed. I think that's what they call hedging.\"</p> <!-- Block 73 --> <p><strong>23rd over: South Africa 48-1 (England led by six runs on first innings; Petersen 24, Amla 1)</strong> Stuart Broad replaces Finn, and his first ball reverse swings in towards Petersen. Two more later in the over shape back into Amla. This is really encouraging for England because the ball is only 23 overs old. Hence the '23rd over' bit at the top of this entry, yeah?</p> <p>\"Is there a league table of Test bowlers and their record of successful DRS decisions?\" says John Starbuck. \"Swann must be on it somewhere. Perhaps more pertinently, does it include umpires too?\" I have no idea, but I do know that Aleem Dar has a 110 per cent success rate.</p> <!-- Block 74 --> <p><strong>24th over: South Africa 49-1 (England led by six runs on first innings; Petersen 24, Amla 2)</strong> \"I want to see Max Millings when he was a young man, when his wife's heart stopped at her first sight of him, when she fell helpless into his arms and whispered 'take me',\" writes <strike> Mac Millings </strike> Alex Xu.</p> <!-- Block 75 --> <p><strong>WICKET! South Africa 50-2 (Petersen LBW b Broad 24)</strong> Another one gone! England are flying! Broad had Amla dropped two balls earlier and then trapped Petersen plumb in front with a beautiful reverse inswinger. Petersen played across the line and knew immediately he was gone. He didn't even consider a review. What a stunning Test match this has been. Twenty minutes ago England were moving towards the brink; now they have two wickets, the ball is reversing and all bets are off.</p> <!-- Block 76 --> <p><strong>25th over: South Africa 50-2 (England led by six runs on first innings; Amla 3, Kallis 0)</strong> England could have had another wicket, but Prior dropped Amla earlier in the over. It was a difficult chance diving to his left when Amla gloved a short from Broad down the leg side, but Prior almost always takes those. Prior was really angry, almost gritting his teeth as he shook his head. The wicket of Petersen soon changed his mood.</p> <!-- Block 77 --> <p><strong>26th over: South Africa 52-2 (England led by six runs on first innings; Amla 4, Kallis 1)</strong> Strauss must be tempted to give Kallis a couple of others of rough stuff from Finn. Against that Swann is bowling really well, and Kalls gets an inside edge onto the pad and not far wide of Taylor at short leg. South Africa by 46. Can anyone lend me some beta-blockers please?</p> <p>\"My good chum Dominic Sayers did <a href=\"http://blog.dominicsayers.com/2011/04/12/umpire-ranking/\">an Umpires' DRS-o-meter in April of last year</a>,\" says Ant Pease. \"It's now out of date, but shows pretty much what you just said; that Aleem Dar is very good indeed. Daryl Harper, not so much.\"</p> <!-- Block 78 --> <p><strong>27th over: South Africa 57-2 (England led by six runs on first innings; Amla 8, Kallis 2)</strong> Kallis has a filthy record on this ground: 23 runs in four Test innings before this, one run in two ODI innings and 20-odd in his only T20 knock here. He hooks Broad for a single and then Amla plays a gorgeous back-foot square drive for four.</p> <p>\"Please don't get carried away,\" says Clare Davies. \"England are not 'flying'. It's just good Test cricket and the most excited we should get is to exclaim 'Game on' in discreet and refined tones. All right?\"</p> <!-- Block 79 --> <p><strong>28th over: South Africa 61-2 (England led by six runs on first innings; Amla 8, Kallis 6)</strong> The camera cuts to an admirable obese gentleman in the pavilion as Swann comes in to bowl again. After blocking a few, Kallis drives Swann imperiously over mid on for four. That was a seriously good shot.</p> <p>\"The photo,\" says Iain Chambers. \"I'm pretty sure that old geezer puffing on a stogie forgot his bow tie and has cunningly fashioned one out if a Tunnocks caramel wafer wrapper.\"</p> <!-- Block 80 --> <p><strong>29th over: South Africa 66-2 (England led by six runs on first innings; Amla 8, Kallis 6)</strong> Amla wears a short ball from Broad on the body \u2013 and then Kallis takes one on the helmet, completely missing an attempted hook. The ball bounced off the helmet and overs the slips for four leg byes. I would definitely give Finn a short spell at Swann's end before Kallis gets his eye in.</p> <!-- Block 81 --> <p><strong>30th over: South Africa 70-2 (England led by six runs on first innings; Amla 11, Kallis 7)</strong> \"I think it's time to retire the term '110%',\" says John Starbuck. \"Ever since Chancellor Ozzy started using it, in what he (probably) fondly imagines to be a knowing, ironic way, it's become the numerate's equivalent of 'inter web', still employed by crass lifestyle journalists. Squares, the lot of 'em.\" Oh it's a hideous term. I used it knowingly. Obviously. In fact it's a decent rule of thumb: if you read a cringeworthy term or phrase on the OBO, just assume it's being used knowingly. Yeah?</p> <!-- Block 82 --> <p><strong>31st over: South Africa 81-2 (England led by six runs on first innings; Amla 12, Kallis 16)</strong> Kallis makes room to uppercut Broad high over the cordon for four, and concludes the over with another boundary, driven beautifully off the back foot. This pair have regrouped calmly after that manic 10 minutes when England took two wickets and had Amla dropped.</p> <p>\"If I stay in this pub with my gin, not talking to anyone and only reading the OBO, will I forget about football?\" says Liz Rippin. \"Or will Amla ruin my weekend anyway by batting his way to a million runs? Please advise.\" Are you a Liverpool fan? Did they not win today? Oh well, there's always 2013-14. Besides, if you drink enough gin, by 11pm you'll be convinced they won 7-1, with all eight goals from Andy Carroll.</p> <!-- Block 83 --> <p><strong>32nd over: South Africa 85-2 (England led by six runs on first innings; Amla 16, Kallis 16)</strong> What a beautiful shot from Amla. He was given a hint of width by Swann, and skipped back to cut it emphatically for four.</p> <p>\"Amla, when he's facing Swann, is shuffling from leg to off to a ridiculous degree. By the time he hits the ball, his leg stump is completely exposed,\" says SB Tang. \"Swann just needs to spear in a well-disguised yorker onto his leg stump. I seem to recall Amir dismissing Simon Katich \u2014 another obdurate leg-to-off shuffler \u2014 at Headingley in July 2010 with a ball that pitched outside leg and swung back to clatter into the leg stump.\"</p> <!-- Block 84 --> <p><strong>33rd over: South Africa 92-2 (England led by six runs on first innings; Amla 20, Kallis 19)</strong> Anderson replaces Broad, who bowled a good ageing-ball spell of 5-0-19-1. He strives for a reverse swinging yorker to Kallis, who waves it superbly wide of mid on for three. Amla then pings a beautiful square drive for four. South Africa have scored 22 from the last three overs; the mood of the match has changed yet again.</p> <!-- Block 85 --> <p><strong>34th over: South Africa 94-2 (England led by six runs on first innings; Amla 21, Kallis 20)</strong> Swann is milked for a couple. This partnership is starting to look a little ominous for England.</p> <!-- Block 86 --> <p><strong>35th over: South Africa 101-2 (England led by six runs on first innings; Amla 28, Kallis 20)</strong> Amla brings up a fine fifty partnership with a thick edge for four off Anderson. South Africa lead by 94, there are 17 overs left in the day, and England are in the same postcode as the place called 'need a wicket'.</p> <!-- Block 87 --> <p><strong>36th over: South Africa 102-2 (England led by six runs on first innings; Amla 29, Kallis 20)</strong> Amla sweeps Swann for another single. These two look a bit too comfortable for comfort. It might well be time for a bit of Finn music with a couple of men back.</p> <p>\"I'm following the cricket to forget about that other sport, and the repeated mental beatings that Liverpool visit upon me,\" says Matt Dony. \"Three months of excitement wiped out in 90 painful minutes. Please don't add to that. Just allow me to read about the jeffing cricket. I've been nothing but supportive, and I always defend your crass cliches as 'knowing'. All I ask is a little reciprocation. Viva cricket!\" There's no need to be sad. I don't care what anyone says, the race for a Champions League place in 2018-19 is wide open.</p> <!-- Block 88 --> <p><strong>37th over: South Africa 111-2 (England led by six runs on first innings; Amla 30, Kallis 24)</strong> The ball hasn't reversed much for Anderson. A couple of induckers but nothing more. Kallis opens the face to steer another boundary to the vacant third-man area, and the following delivery swings down the leg side for four byes. South Africa are scoring far too quickly at the moment, with 41 from the last seven overs.</p> <!-- Block 89 --> <p><strong>38th over: South Africa 112-2 (England led by six runs on first innings; Amla 31, Kallis 24)</strong> Swann breathes new life into the game with a fine over that include three huge appeals. He <em>begs </em>for LBW when Amla is hit on the back leg, but Kumar Dharmasena says not out. Swann wants to review it, Strauss is not convinced. England have only one review left and I suppose they can't risk it. It's the right decision as it hit the pad outside the line of off stump. There's an even bigger appeal next ball when Amla gets in a tangle as he attempts a slap to leg. Again Dharmasena says not out, again England decide not to review and again it's the right decision: this one was turning past the leg stump. Then there's a third LBW appeal, this time against Kallis. It wasn't a bad shout but he was outside the line. Excellent work from Kumar Dharmasena, who after an iffy start to this match has had a very good day.</p> <!-- Block 90 --> <p><strong>39th over: South Africa 116-2 (England led by six runs on first innings; Amla 35, Kallis 24)</strong> Finn comes on for Anderson. England are starting to make things happen again at the end of a long day. Amla inside edges consecutive deliveries, the first wide of off stump for two and the second onto the pad, from where it lands safely on the off side. There are 13 overs remaining today. Please please please please please let England take another wicket or seven.</p> <!-- Block 91 --> <p><strong>40th over: South Africa 121-2 (England led by six runs on first innings; Amla 39, Kallis 25)</strong> Swann now has no slip but two men on the leg side, short leg and backward short leg. Amla clips a full delivery through midwicket for four with beautiful timing.</p> <!-- Block 92 --> <p><strong>41st over: South Africa 125-2 (England led by six runs on first innings; Amla 39, Kallis 29)</strong> Another boundary to the vacant third man area, with Kallis forcing Finn wide of the slip cordon. This has been a fantastic partnership at a crunch time in the entire series. Amla and Kallis have not so much coped with the pressure as ignored it. If they are still here at the close, South Africa will sleep very soundly tonight.</p> <!-- Block 93 --> <p><strong>42nd over: South Africa 126-2 (England led by six runs on first innings; Amla 40, Kallis 29)</strong> Amla just about gets his bat down on a horrible grubber from Swann, although I think he'd have been outside the line anyway.</p> <!-- Block 94 --> <p><strong>43rd over: South Africa 128-2 (England led by six runs on first innings; Amla 42, Kallis 29)</strong> Ten overs remaining. One last push, from Queen, country and mace, and to keep Piers Morgan's mouth shut. Finn is getting a bit of reverse inswing and has a big shout for LBW against Amla turned down by Simon Taufel. Height is the issue, as ever with Finn, and Strauss is not interested. Replays show it was bouncing over the top.</p> <!-- Block 95 --> <p><strong>44th over: South Africa 130-2 (England led by six runs on first innings; Amla 42, Kallis 31)</strong> Swann's figures are 18-4-33-1. Pr-etty good indeed, although Enlgand could really do with one becoming two before the close and to hell with that Spice Girls song.</p> <!-- Block 96 --> <p><strong>45th over: South Africa 131-2 (England led by six runs on first innings; Amla 43, Kallis 31)</strong> Finn's certainly reversing it now. He also gets one delivery to seam back grotesquely towards Kallis, who takes it on the arm without complaint. \"That would have been three months off for you Nass...\" says Beefy on Sky. Seven overs remaining; a wicket now would be pure gold for England.</p> <!-- Block 97 --> <p><strong>46th over: South Africa 131-2 (England led by six runs on first innings; Amla 43, Kallis 31)</strong> Swann switches around the wicket to Amla, who will have to change his approach. He had been exposing all three stumps when moving towards the off side to repel Swann. A maiden.</p> <!-- Block 98 --> <p><strong>WICKET! South Africa 131-3 (Kallis LBW b Finn 31)</strong> Kallis has been given out LBW by Simon Taufel \u2013 but he must think he's hit it because he reviewed the decision instantly. Hang on, the first replay suggests he he didn't hit it: the two noises were the ball hitting both pads. Height is the other big issue. It only needs to shave the bails for it to be out. Here comes Hawkeye ... <strong>he's gone</strong>! It was smacking the middle-and-leg bail. This is a <em>huge</em> moment in the game. Kallis is really unhappy \u2013 he thinks he's been stiffed in both innings \u2013 but that looked a perfectly fair decision. There was nothing at all on Hotspot. He pushed around his front pad at a good delivery that came in just enough to beat the inside edge as Kallis pushed around his pad. His bat made contact with his pad as well, and I think that's why he thought he hit the ball.</p> <!-- Block 99 --> <p><strong>47th over: South Africa 131-3 (England led by six runs on first innings; Amla 43, Steyn 0)</strong> Dale Steyn is in as nightwatchman. There are still five overs remaining after this, but we won't get them all because play has to end at 6.30pm. Steyn survives the remainder of a fine over from Finn, a wicket maiden.</p> <!-- Block 100 --> <p><strong>48th over: South Africa 136-3 (England led by six runs on first innings; Amla 48, Steyn 0)</strong> Look, I know greed is one of the seven deadly sins \u2013 and look what happened to that bloke in Se7en who got greedy \u2013 but I don't care. The wicket of Kallis was lovely and brilliant and spiffing and life-affirming, but could we have Amla before the close as well please? Nice one.</p> <p>It doesn't happen in that over. Swann, still around the wicket, bowls a strange long hop that is smashed for four by Amla. At first I thought it was a Warne-style bouncer but in fact it just slipped out. It was the filthiest delivery of the series. \"One twenty for four here lads,\" shouts one of the England fielders, which is the definition of optimism given South Africa are 136 for three.</p> <p>In other news, Snickometer suggests that Kallis <em>might</em> have got an inside edge, but it's not conclusive \u2013 so much was happening at the same time \u2013 and there's no way the decision could have been overturned, even if Snicko was available to the third umpire.</p> <!-- Block 101 --> <p><strong>49th over: South Africa 137-3 (England led by six runs on first innings; Amla 49, Steyn 0)</strong> Amla, driven back in his crease, pushes Finn off the face of the bat and just wide of Taylor, diving to his left at short leg. Steyn then takes a hit on the glove from Finn and calls for treatment. He's in a bit of pain here. The break (in play, not on Steyn's left hand) will ensure this should be the last over of the day. Steyn gets into line for the last two balls of the over. We will have time for one more.</p> <!-- Block 102 --> <p><strong>50th over: South Africa 145-3 (England led by six runs on first innings; Amla 57, Steyn 0)</strong> Stuart Broad will bowl the last over of the day, a smart move from Andrew Strauss. Amla drives him sweetly through mid off for four to reach a tough and vital half century, and then fizzes another boundary through extra cover. That's the end of another storming day's Test cricket: 85.3 overs, 252 runs, eight wickets and the match still in the balance. South Africa lead by 139 and are slight favourites, but England are still right in this. Thanks for your emails; see you tomorrow.</p>",

  "<p>Chinese tourists are much in demand these days \u2013 not least among Britain's government. The reasons for this are obvious: Chinese visitors tend to spend on average <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p00m8qw9\" title=\"\">three times more than other overseas visitors</a>, yet at the moment France receives 25-30% more visitors than Britain. This is why a division appears to be emerging within the government, with culture secretary <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/aug/14/london-2012-tourism-funding-boost\" title=\"\">Jeremy Hunt trying to make it easier for Chinese tourists</a> to obtain visas, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/aug/16/theresa-may-blocks-chinese-visa?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">while home secretary Theresa May has been blocking such changes</a>.</p> <p>In principle, Britain should be a major destination for Chinese tourists. Britain has an unparalleled reputation for goods that are considered to be much higher quality than those made in China, and often cheaper. British brands such as Burberry and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2011/mar/09/chinese-love-clarks-shoes\" title=\"\">Clarks shoes are notoriously famous in China</a> for their style and craftsmanship..</p> <p>The UK is high up in the list of places that the Chinese want to visit; lagging behind the US, the dreamland of opportunities, but often ahead of the rest of Europe. There is a sense of mystery about the UK: it's often the images of England's green parks, countryside and Victorian houses that people point to as an alternative to polluted, overcrowded cities such as Beijing and Guangzhou.</p> <p>The capital is viewed as modern and dynamic, while being ingrained with history. When asked what other images are conjured up by the UK, the reply is often \"the Queen, tea and Oxbridge\". This strong cultural identity is something the Chinese admire, particularly after much of its own was destroyed during the shambolic Cultural Revolution of the 1960s.</p> <p>So what's stopping them actually coming? Sebastian Wood, the British ambassador in Beijing, has described the UK as a \"fortress\", and while this is perhaps an exaggeration, Britain does have a reputation as a country that is harder to access.</p> <p>The main problem for Chinese tourists is a matter of logistics \u2013 the UK is not included in the <a href=\"http://www.theschengenoffice.com/explained/schengen_visa.html\" title=\"\">Schengen visa</a>, which allows access to a host of European countries such as France and Germany. What this means is that an entirely separate process is required to gain entry into the UK. Although an overhaul earlier this year means that visa applications are now completed online, visitors are still required to visit one of 12 UK centres across the country for a face-to-face interview and fingerprinting. If you don't live near one of these centres already, you'd have to travel some distance to get there.</p> <p>Another problem is that Chinese people want to visit more than one country if they are going to make it all the way out to Europe \u2013 travel abroad for leisure is still a relatively new concept, so many want to cover as much ground as possible. Going to the extra trouble of seeing a country the size of a large province in China (of which there are 33), when the Schengen visa will get you into 26 countries, makes the former seem a less worth it.</p> <p>There is also the issue of cost: \u00a347 for a Schengen visa, \u00a382 for the UK. On top of this, the UK is viewed as stricter in its handling of visas compared with the rest of Europe, fed by urban legends of rejected applications. In the end, the decision comes down to one question: is Britain worth the hassle?</p> <p>What can the government do about this? Yes, make the application process more user-friend, less costly and soften border barriers without breaching national security \u2013 after all, there are a lot of people in China, most not looking to contribute to the UK's GDP.</p> <p>But what the UK government should realise also is that much of the power lies in the hands of Chinese travel agents and middlemen who arrange visits abroad and have considerable influence on visas applications. It needs to think seriously about this lot before implementing any wild ideas for getting the Chinese over to part with their money.</p> <p>The British are sometimes seen as conservative and more rain-stricken than its American or Australian counterparts, but that's easily solved: surprisingly perhaps, the Chinese love the British royal family. For many in China, the royals are a reminder of their own imperial rule that collapsed at the beginning of the 20th century: both curiosity and envy play a role. So just get Will and Kate on a plane to Beijing to shake a few Chinese hands.</p> <p>Oh, and inviting the Dalai Lama over for tea at No 10 on a near annual basis is probably not the best way to bring in this patriotic bunch. But I guess that's what makes the British British.</p>",
