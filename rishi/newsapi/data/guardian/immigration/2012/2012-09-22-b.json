  "<p>James Flynn studied mathematics and physics at the University of Chicago, before switching to political philosophy. Currently, he is a professor of political studies at the University of Otago in New Zealand. His name has been lent to the \"Flynn effect\" \u2013 his discovery that IQ scores have risen significantly from one generation to another over the past century. He is 78.</p> <p><strong>What does IQ measure?</strong><br>That depends what it's used for. Sometimes, an IQ test is a force for good. You have a kid at school who is doing badly and you think he seems brighter than that. You give him an IQ test and he knocks the socks out of it. So it can be used to help diagnose an individual's educational problems. Some universities use IQ tests as part of an entrance exam.</p> <p>The second thing they are often used for is to measure the difference between groups. But this works only if their quality of environment is roughly comparable.</p> <p><strong>Your book, <em>Are We Getting Smarter?</em>, talks about the recent IQ gains made by women.</strong><br>Women today match men but only in advanced countries, where women get an equal shake. One of the most interesting things is that at university women do have IQs about two points lower than men, maybe three, and a lot of scholars say: \"Ah-ha, that means women aren't as bright\", but why do you think that might be?</p> <p><strong>Is it to do with the type of people who pursue going to university?</strong><br>Well, it has to do with the fact that, if you take a girl of 17 from secondary school with an IQ of 100, she will get better grades than the typical boy. So that means that the girl with the IQ of 100 may well get to university and the boy won't. So the male sample is more elite; it has a higher threshold. This reveals one of the disturbing things about British education: if you look at the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development statistics, at the end of secondary school, only the top third of boys matches the top half of girls for reading. In America, only the top quarter of boys matches the top half of girls for written composition. This is why so many women are beginning to dominate journalism and law.</p> <p><strong>If I took an early IQ test, would I find it baffling the way the problems are set?</strong><br>No, you would knock the socks out of it because people who designed the early IQ test were ahead of their time. They were highly professional people who had been schooled in the scientific ethos, and they weren't typical of their day. Let's take a question that you would get and an intelligent person of 1900 might not: if you were asked: \"What do dogs and rabbits have in common?\", what would you say?</p> <p><strong>They are both mammals.</strong><br>Correct. A kid in 1900 would say: \"You use dogs to hunt rabbits.\" He would get the question wrong because, before people had lots of formal schooling, they had a utilitarian mentality, and they were fixated on the concrete world and using it to advantage. You've been raised in a scientific world where you think classifying things is an obvious prerequisite for understanding them. To you, a dog and a rabbit are just mammals; you are not interested in whether it is a beagle and good for hunting rabbits. So IQ gains over time are totally fascinating if you know how to interpret them and don't just run around saying: \"Are we getting more intelligent?\"</p> <p><strong>So these observations show that IQ is determined by environment rather than genes?</strong><br>At the individual level, genes are important, as they are for other qualities such as height.</p> <p>It's very different, however, to use IQ to compare groups and say that, because one group has a lower mean IQ, that shows that it is genetically inferior. For example, if you look at developing nations, there are six for which we have good IQ data. Three of these are making gains faster now than we Europeans are. These are Turkey, Brazil and Kenya and I predict that eventually all three of them are going to match us for IQ. As for the three other nations, there is nothing the matter with their genes but with their circumstances. You have Sudan, where they keep having civil wars; you have Saudi Arabia, where most of them are sitting around feather-bedding on oil wells; and you have the Dominican Republic, where they have their infrastructure wiped out every 10 years by hurricanes, tsunamis and tornadoes. There is nothing the matter with their genes, but if Britain had all of its infrastructure destroyed every 10 years, it wouldn't be doing so well.</p> <p><strong>You have also described something you call the \"bright tax\".</strong><br>It has always been thought that bright people's minds deteriorated less after the age of 65. I found that that was true for verbal abilities, but the brighter you are the faster your analytical abilities deteriorate after 65, all the way down the scale. Even the average person deteriorates more quickly than the below-average. That sets an interesting question. Is the good analytic brain, like a high-performance sports car, something that requires more maintenance in old age than the body can give it \u2013 that would be a physiological hypothesis. Or is it that we mainly use our analytic ability at work, so that if you are bright you have a cognitively demanding job and when you retire you are like an athlete who has lost his exercise advantage.</p> <p><strong>How would one mitigate this cognitive decline post-65: do crosswords, take up running, learn a new language?</strong><br>Mental exercise will do you good at any age. Even if your brain is deteriorating, it will deteriorate more slowly if you use it. Just as while I can't run 10k anything like [as fast as] when I was young, if you are really out of shape, even at 78, I could give you a hard time.</p> <p><strong>Are you going to tell me your time for 10k?</strong><br>When I was young it was 32 minutes, and in those days the world record was around 29. When I was 66, I could still run it in 45\u00bd. My ability to run at under 50 minutes has receded since I have entered my 70s.</p> <p><strong>Other than the obvious physical benefits, why do you run?</strong><br>There is no doubt that the blood supply to the brain, due to a cardiovascular system that is efficient, helps intelligence in the pre-frontal lobes; that is true. I don't do it for that reason, but I am sure that I get the benefit.</p> <p>There was a wonderful study by the OECD where they gave a test of working memory \u2013 what a pity it wasn't a test of analytical ability, but it wasn't \u2013 and they divided the countries into those like France, where 80% of people retired between 55-65, and those like Sweden and Switzerland, where 80% were still in work, and the loss on working memory in France for that age was twice as great. Which tells us that, if you kept exercising your brain at work, your working memory held up better.</p> <p><strong>You have written four books this year, including one about climate change.</strong><br>I kept the book under 100 pages, it is called <em>Climate Change and the Environment</em> \u2013 I'm looking for a publisher. I guarantee anyone can read it in less than four hours and learn what they need to know.</p> <p>My conclusion is that, yes, we are making a contribution. At one time, the climate sceptics had a case, but their case is now falling apart. Keep your eye on the west Antarctic ice shelf: we are in trouble. It looks as if it's going to go, and, even if half of it goes over the next century, that will raise sea levels by three metres, and your beloved London is going to be in a fix.</p> <p>Laser fusion is probably the best long-range hope for clean energy: that is where you bombard heavy hydrogen with fusion to try to set up an interaction that would actually generate more energy than you put into it. But that research is probably about 70 years away from being dominant. Before then we are going to need a stopgap.</p> <p>Are We Getting Smarter?<em> by James R Flynn is published by Cambridge University Press (\u00a316.99)</em></p>",

  "<p>Eugenia Tymoshenko steps out of a cab in sunny Knightsbridge wearing black high heels, a smart tan skirt and black jacket. She could be something senior at Goldman Sachs, but her pressing business is about life, death and justice. The 32-year-old is on a campaign to free her mother from a seven-year jail sentence in a Ukrainian prison \u2013 and, she says, from physical and mental torture that threatens to kill her.</p> <p>Eugenia's mother is Yulia Tymoshenko, the former prime minister of Ukraine, sent to prison after a sequence of events that combines the plot of a revenge thriller with the darkest politics of the Soviet Union era. In October last year, Tymoshenko was found guilty of criminally \"abusing her office\" in what the United States and European Union have both called a politically motivated show trial. Even Russian president Vladimir Putin criticised the sentence. Since the start of her prison term, her daughter claims, Yulia has been beaten and denied access to a doctor or drugs. She has also been accused \u2013 without evidence \u2013 of the murder of a fellow MP. Tymoshenko's supporters have protested and battled police on the streets of Kiev, and Tymoshenko herself has gone on hunger strike. Now it seems her only hope of freedom is her daughter.</p> <p>Eugenia makes an unlikely saviour. Until her mother's sentence, her career was running an Italian restaurant in Kiev. \"I never had any ambition for politics,\" she tells me. These days Eugenia strides confidently into TV studios for interviews. She talks with poise and passion to presidents and prime ministers. She addresses meetings of MEPs and briefs lawyers. And she litigates. \"Ukraine courts don't work,\" Eugenia says. \"We have to go overseas.\"</p> <p>When we meet she is in London talking to lawyers as she takes action in the British courts against Ukraine's first deputy prosecutor. In&#xa0;March, Renat Kuzmin told BBC Ukraine that he had \"reliable information\" that money from her mother's accounts had been transferred to pay hitmen who had gunned down MP and businessman Yevgen Shcherban, as&#xa0;well as his wife and his assistant, at an airport in 1996. \"She has never been questioned, and this allegation has no basis in fact,\" Eugenia says, toying with her pasta. One senses that this lapsed restaurateur now rarely finishes a meal.</p> <p>Eugenia comes across as a mixture of relentless focus \u2013 displaying her mastery of the legal and political minefield that confronts her mother \u2013 and the restless stress of somebody who wishes that she could wake up to find that this was all a bad dream.</p> <p>Her mother first gained international prominence in 2004 as one of the leaders of the Orange Revolution that freed her country from the Soviet empire. Alongside Viktor Yushchenko, who survived a near-fatal dioxin poisoning attack that disfigured his face, Tymoshenko \u2013 famous for her golden blonde braid, worn like a crown around her head, and her wardrobe of expensive peasant chic \u2013 was a figurehead for hundreds of thousands of revolutionaries who braved sub-zero temperatures in Kiev to protest against a fraud-tainted presidential election \"won\" by Viktor Yanukovych. The Supreme Court ordered a rerun and Yushchenko was elected to the presidency.</p> <p>\"Those days were incredibly exciting,\" says Eugenia. \"It seemed like the end of all the political troubles for Ukraine. We could move towards becoming a member of a free and democratic Western Europe.\" Yushchenko appointed Eugenia's mother as prime minister, but their dalliance with democracy and each other did not last long. Eight months later they fell out over bitter accusations of corruption. Yushchenko sacked Tymoshenko during a live TV address to the nation in September 2005 and the following year brought in Viktor Yanukovych, of all people, as his new prime minister. \"It was then that I began to fear for my mother,\" Eugenia says.</p> <p>Ukraine has been through 15 premiers since that first flush of independence. It is a country where political alliances are notoriously short-lived and morph very quickly into acrimony and revenge. However, Viktor Yanukovych and Yulia Tymoshenko share a history and a loathing that runs deep even by Ukrainian standards. Did Eugenia or her father not try to persuade her to stay away from a political tide that was turning strongly against her?</p> <p>\"Ten years ago maybe we could have,\" Eugenia says, her dark eyes momentarily staring into the middle distance. \"But now she sees her fight as a fight for Ukraine.\"</p> <p>Born in 1960, Yulia Tymoshenko was an economist and engineer who, with her husband Oleksandr, built a fortune with their now-defunct corporation United Energy Systems Ukraine (UESU), a gas-trading concern which also included venture capital firms and two banks. The rise of UESU was meteoric \u2013 some said suspicious. By the end of 1996, under the patronage of then-prime minister Pavlo Lazarenko, the company controlled 25% of the Ukrainian economy. According to the Ukrainian newspaper&#xa0;<em>Izvestia</em>, UESU was a kind of a \"state within a state\".</p> <p>One of the wealthiest businesspeople in the country, Tymoshenko entered politics in the 1990s. Blessed with incredible willpower and energy \u2013 and a hard edge behind her trademark smile \u2013 \"Lady Yu\" could work a crowd like nobody else. When a rival in parliament claimed that if she sold her pearls they would raise enough cash to feed an average Ukrainian family for five years, she ripped off her necklace and threw it at him. \"There's not a single pearl in this necklace,\" she shouted.</p> <p>Her fall from power was just as dramatic. Five years on from the Orange Revolution, president Yuschenko's popularity had vanished. The 2010 presidency battle was instead fought between the old regime's Yanukovych and Tymoshenko, with Yanukovych narrowly prevailing. Tymoshenko challenged the result in court and continued to protest even after the election had been deemed free and fair. Yanukovych demanded her resignation as prime minister; her government resigned after a parliamentary vote of no confidence.</p> <p>Almost immediately the justice department moved against her, reopening an old case of tax evasion and amassing evidence to put her on trial for Shcherban's murder. The case which made it to the courts first concerned a major contract signed with Russia in 2009 to import gas. Tymoshenko was accused of exceeding her powers by forcing the state company, Naftogaz, to agree to a deal that overpriced the gas, and of costing the country \u00a3120 million.</p> <p>In July 2011 Eugenia was in court to see her mother in the dock and Yushchenko giving evidence against her. Tymoshenko was found guilty in October and ordered to repay the \u00a3120m in damages. \"Nobody can humiliate my honest name,\" she insisted as she began her sentence in Women's Prison No 54 in Kharkiv, 300 miles east of Kiev.</p> <p>Knowing his own arrest was imminent, her husband Oleksandr fled to the Czech Republic and was granted political asylum. \"By the time of my mother's conviction nearly a dozen of her associates had been arrested and some jailed,\" Eugenia says. \"To see your mother sent to prison is horrible, unbearable. Equally, I was not surprised. It was Yanukovych's verdict, not the court's.\"</p> <p>For Eugenia, the key to protecting her mother \u2013 and obtaining her release \u2013 is keeping her fate present on the global stage. For that she had the advantage of an international upbringing. Eugenia had spent nine years in England, boarding at Rugby School and studying at LSE. Shielded from Ukraine's poverty by her family wealth, Eugenia was not immune from her mother's searing ambition: \"She always wanted me to be a good student, to be top of my class. At the beginning it was hard to keep up to her standards.\" Eugenia smiles. \"My father is not so strict. With him I always found a good ear.\"</p> <p>In 2004 she met Sean Carr, a heavily tattooed biker from Leeds and aspiring rock singer with the Death Valley Screamers, in a&#xa0;Red Sea bar in Egypt. She married him a year later. Eleven years older than Eugenia, Carr was suddenly ranked the ninth \"most influential foreigner in Ukraine\" by the <em>Kiev Post</em>. In the land of the Orange Revolution his rock career soared. It did not last. \"I got divorced last year,\" Eugenia says matter-of-factly. Children? \"No children.\" A pause. She will not be drawn on whether campaigning for her mother's release was a contributory factor to her marriage breakdown. When pressed she says: \"This interview is about my mother.\"</p> <p>In December Eugenia was invited to address the annual congress of the European People's Party, the largest centre-right grouping in the European Parliament, to which her mother's party is aligned. She took to the stage nervously clutching her speech and faced 1,000 delegates from 39 countries, including Nicolas Sarkozy and Angela Merkel. \"It was terrifying!\" she remembers.</p> <p>Eugenia was concerned about her mother's health: Yulia had a herniated disc in her back. \"She is denied painkillers and can no longer walk,\" Eugenia told the delegates. \"Even the priest cannot see her. She is suffering tortures. I'm scared that this torture will continue until it kills her.\" A week later a video appeared on Ukrainian TV of Tymoshenko bedridden in prison, a shadow of herself and protesting at being filmed against her will. It went viral on the web. International opinion began to rally.</p> <p>This February Eugenia met Hillary Clinton in Washington DC. \"She came over as soon as she saw me and said: 'We really support your mother and we are very worried about her.' Mrs Clinton is a very warm person. I asked if she could put pressure to get my mother treated medically. She spoke to Yanukovych twice and said he had admitted that it was wrong to deny her medical help.\" Two months later, prison officers came to Tymoshenko's cell at 11pm, turned out the lights, wrapped her in a blanket and took her to hospital in Kharkiv. Once she was there, photographs showed severe bruising on her arms and stomach. She alleged she had been beaten en route.</p> <p>\"She was not allegedly beaten,\" Eugenia says fiercely. \"She was hit so hard she could not breathe!\" Hillary Clinton protested and Tymoshenko herself went on hunger strike for 20 days, losing 10kg. Eugenia was horrified. \"I tried to persuade her not to. She was already so weak. But she said: 'Stay strong!'\"</p> <p>Eugenia says the endless travelling, lobbying and media interviews are physically and emotionally draining, but not as stressful as seeing her mother. She might still be in a hospital but Yulia Tymoshenko is kept in isolation behind three sets of bars. \"We hug and hold hands but we can only talk in whispers. Her room on the ninth floor is bugged. There are three cameras on her 24 hours a day, including her bathroom. She has the same prison guards who can walk in unannounced at any time. She has very limited communication with the outside world. She could not even call me on my birthday.\" Eugenia pauses. \"We do have good days,\" she continues. German doctors have been allowed to treat her mother. \"Her back is still painful but her health has improved,\" Eugenia says.</p> <p>Does Eugenia fear for her own safety? \"I have never been involved in politics or my parents' business. If Yanukovych goes against me, it will be very obvious,\" she shrugs. \"I know they watch me and intercept my calls, but I also know I have done nothing wrong. I am in the best position to speak out.\"</p> <p>Thanks to Eugenia the Tymoshenko case has been a PR disaster for Yanukovych's government. In May 2012 it had to cancel a meeting of regional leaders at Yalta when Germany, the Czech Republic, Italy and 10 other EU countries pulled out in protest. Ukraine did co-host the Euro 2012 football championship in June with Poland, but the British, German, Austrian and Belgian governments said that no ministers or officials would attend matches in Ukraine.</p> <p>Supporters portray Tymoshenko as an Aung San Suu Kyi figure. However, her ability to attract and antagonise in equal measure makes her more like Benazir Bhutto, twice prime minister of Pakistan, who was charged by her president with corruption and money-laundering, and assassinated in 2007. When Tymoshenko was taken from the court to prison her supporters were on the street, but so were her detractors, shouting: \"Keep her in a prison. She is a thief!\"</p> <p>Eugenia insists that her mother is a tireless campaigner against repression and corruption. But there are question marks against Tymoshenko's own behaviour. According to the respected Washington-based Freedom House, which visited Ukraine in 2012, for instance, Yanukovych has spent $100m on an extravagant presidential retreat. So why in two stints as prime minister did Tymoshenko not do something about it? \"My mother had a lot of responsibility to bring change to Ukraine,\" Eugenia says, \"but she did not have sufficient instruments to bring it through and had to focus on problems with the economy.\" However, it was a lack of economic focus that led to Ukraine going broke and having to limp to the west for loans that killed the Orange Revolution.</p> <p>The European Court of Human Rights has held an initial public hearing into the \"admissibility and merits in the case of Tymoshenko v Ukraine\". It is now deliberating behind closed doors. It might take months to pronounce, and even if it does find in her favour, a guilty verdict in the tax evasion or the murder cases could see Yulia Tymoshenko remain behind bars for many years.</p> <p>Eugenia is convinced that her mother will return to public life. \"I think she will be with us this year,\" she says, although it is unlikely that Lady Yu will be free before parliamentary elections on 28 October \u2013 Tymoshenko supporters fear they cannot win with their figurehead behind bars. \"I don't worry about her political life; I worry about her health. We are all fighting for her. My dad and I are sending food and clothes parcels but we are doing it separately.\" Eugenia misses her family. \"In May my grandfather died, and I was the only one who could go to his funeral. I just want us to all be together.</p> <p>\"The government wants the world to forget her. I'm not going to let that happen.\"</p>",
  "<p><strong>I</strong>t is nine o'clock on a Saturday night and I should be at an old friend's party. There are likely to be nice people there, artistic, talented; and the hostess is a wizard cook. It was seven for seven thirty, dress smart but \"not too smart\"...</p> <p>I am not at the party however. Nor is my dress remotely smart, consisting as it does of a fisherman's sweater, more holes than wool, and a pair of frayed tracksuit pants smelling faintly of urine. This is my usual garb \u2013 my uniform, if you will \u2013 when I visit my betting shop of choice in north London.</p> <p>There is one other punter in the place \u2013 a nicotine-stained old guy in a raincoat who is operating a strange roulette system consisting of a plethora of tiny stakes that more or less cancel each another out.</p> <p>I used to watch small-scale punters like this with contempt. I've always been a big-bet man myself, usually staking the maximum allowable sum in all the major chains (\u00a3100) on my preferred game \u2013 blackjack. Then one day I found myself in a Ladbrokes shop on a Saturday afternoon with every station occupied. I waited a quarter of an hour for a seat to come vacant. It was then that I realised that the size of the bet didn't count for anything: I was just as desperate and sleazy as the rest of them.</p> <p>That convinced me of the true nature of my predicament, though sadly it didn't do anything to curtail it. So I would find myself, at 9.50am, hovering on the threshold of William Hill in South End Green, waiting for the joint to open. Hard to retain much self-respect after that. No less pitiful, you might say, than an alcoholic outside the off licence at 9.50am on a winter morning, slapping his cirrhotic sides against the cold.</p> <p>After wishing my confrere an unacknowledged \"Good luck\", I make my way to a terminal and park my backside on the sticky black leather seat.</p> <p>I've gambled online, and in live casinos, but neither has the same, uniquely sordid appeal as the betting shop. It's the tackiness of the betting shop that, for me, puts it without peer as a means of wrecking your life. And among the charms of the betting shop, blackjack has the greatest appeal.</p> <p>This has something to do, I assume, with the structure of the game: the ability to stand or take another card creates an irresistible illusion of control. With roulette, you spin the wheel, and that's it; horses: once they're off, ditto. Whereas with blackjack, few things can match the adrenaline rush you get when that third card takes you to 20 or, incredibly, to 21.</p> <p>If you're not familiar with gaming machines, they are, in appearance and construction, not unlike the automatic ticket vendors at railway stations. Though, in this case, in return for the money you feed in, you mostly get nothing back.</p> <p>The soulless strip lighting of the shop creates a curiously appealing, dismal ambience \u2013 a kind of physical equivalent to my own spiritual landscape. I'm starting to think the north London artistes I ought to be rubbing shoulders with at this moment don't know what they're missing as they chew on their boeuf bourguignon and mashed potato canap\u00e9s and sip Rioja. So, why am I here? Well, clearly because I'm a schmuck, but that's not what I mean; I mean biographically speaking \u2026</p> <p>For many years an old friend of mine and I have been devotees of poker. It began with evenings of spontaneous, anarchic, life-enhancing mayhem at his flat, escalating from there, by insidious steps, into a serious fortnightly home game complete with league table and annual trophy. Now, if all poker \u2013 all gambling games, in fact \u2013 are potentially addictive and obsessional, Texas Holdem is both of those things to the power of 10.</p> <p>Being endowed with just the right, catastrophic psychic make-up, I was pretty soon hooked. One day in February 2005 I asked the old pal in question if there was anywhere you could play Holdem online. He chortled and gave me the name of a \"reputable\" site. That night I opened an account and began to play.</p> <p>I started in a restrained way \u2013 five or six hours a day \u2013 maybe a bit more if I had no work on. Soon I was convinced I'd struck gold. Here, at last, was the steady, reliable source of income I'd been dreaming of ever since giving up a well-paid job in the City to concentrate on, of all things, translating 17th-century French verse comedies.</p> <p>I couldn't keep this goldmine I'd hit on to myself. I announced arrogantly at dinner parties that I had discovered a new string to my bow, a sure-fire revenue stream. The \"fish\" (poker speak for bad players) out there had to be seen to be believed. I even managed to convince myself that I was earning a living from the game. It took many weeks of steady, daily losses before a nagging suspicion was born that something might be amiss. A subsequent check of bank and credit card statements revealed a \u00a34,000 net loss in a matter of weeks. How?</p> <p>I was an addict by now, of course, and that kind of self-delusion is standard addict practice. Worse still, because of the peculiar nature of gambling addiction \u2013 many experts reckon it's the hardest of all addictions to cure \u2013 once it dawned on me that I was in fact losing, I figured the only way to recoup the money was to play more and then yet more.</p> <p>One time, after playing non-stop for three days, so that the index finger of my right hand had started to tingle from repeatedly clicking the mouse to bet on or fold a hand, I woke to find that somebody had broken into my flat during the night and festooned it with playing cards. They were all over the walls, they were dangling from the curtains. Wherever I went \u2013 bathroom to wash, kitchen to make breakfast \u2013 they kept popping up.</p> <p>I dismissed this (despite having once suffered from a bout of manic depression that included delusions) as some sort of short-term optical glitch that was only to be expected in the circumstances, and soon hurried back to my laptop to resume playing.</p> <p>Then, around lunchtime, I was in the loo, when I looked down and saw that there was a playing card lying in the bottom of the bowl. This was no vague optical effect, either, but a perfectly formed, shiny new king of hearts.</p> <p>I called my GP, fixed an emergency appointment and got myself straight down there. \"You're mad,\" she said, perhaps more accurately than she'd intended, when I had described the situation. \"You have a history of mental problems. You should not be doing this. Go home, switch off your computer, or better still, chuck it in the bin and take this pill and get some sleep.\"</p> <p>She placed a large white tablet in my hand. Feeling a whole lot better, I reckoned I would just get a couple more hours' play in, take the tablet and turn in. Unfortunately, I drifted off in the middle of a hand, without having taken the pill, and when I woke up a couple of hours later I was dying...</p> <p>Well, perhaps not quite. In the ambulance they informed me that I was having a massive atrial fibrillation, brought on by four days and nights without sleep, sprayed something on the roof of my mouth, and asked for my next of kin. On reaching A&amp;E I was attended to with worrying promptness and a drip was inserted in my neck. I was in there all the next day, my pulse returning to normal just 20 minutes before I was scheduled to be medically \"rebooted\".</p> <p>All this makes gambling seem a dark and destructive business, and, of course, it can be. But that's pretty obviously not the whole story. Like all addictive activities, it offers astonishing highs \u2013 highs as high as the lows are low. If it didn't, who on earth would take it up in the first place? During a lucky streak, for instance, I get a sense of quite astonishing and implausibly sustained wellbeing. There was the time, to cite one of many, when I turned my last \u00a32,000 in the world into \u00a382,000 over a spell of about three weeks. (The fact that I went on to blow the lot in 10 minutes and was suicidal for a fortnight thereafter is another matter.) Regaining a recent loss brings a special pleasure of its own, as any gambler will tell you: a weird, warped sense of redemption.</p> <p>Equally true, on the other hand, is an observation by Casanova, who had a sideline in gambling and noted that inside every serious gambler lurks a miser. Or, to put it another way, a greedy klutz wanting something for nothing.</p> <p>But, yes, the highs. Perhaps even more exhilarating than that 80 grand streak was the day when I had gambled everything away except a \u00a35,000 overdraft facility. By this stage I had had to remortgage my flat to the tune of \u00a320,000. I spent the day debating with myself whether or not I should try my luck and see what I could do with that 5k. What had I got to lose? It wasn't even my money, but the bank's.</p> <p>As usual, the inner demons (the shrinks, the addiction experts, call it this \"permission thought\") won the argument, and at midnight, came the start of a new 24-hour period, which meant that I was allowed to deposit fresh funds. I transferred the overdraft money to my William Hill account and sat down to a hand of blackjack, staking the maximum allowable amount on one hand of \u00a35,000.</p> <p>I hit 20 with that hand, won, 20 with the next, won again, won again with the third bet. In the space of two minutes I had not merely quadrupled my 5k overdraft, but could now pay off my mortgage and be, once more, to some degree at least, a free man.</p> <p>I collapsed on the sofa, numb with joy, sandbagged by bliss. But the demons were of the opinion that I shouldn't stop there. In their judgment this was clearly a streak, and there was at least one more win out there \u2013 possibly even blackjack, which pays 150%. I went back to my laptop, put another 5k on and hit blackjack. In 10 minutes, from four consecutive hands, I had made \u00a322,500, and changed my life. I remember sitting in the dark for half an hour with such joy and relief washing over me.</p> <p>But, for the MOST PART, the order of the day has, inevitably, been self-destruction. I have lost, at a conservative estimate, a quarter of a million pounds over the past seven years. And I am once again remortgaged, for 30k this time.</p> <p>I do not complain about any of this \u2013 not the debt, the near-death experience, not even the huge and horribly dark spells of despair and self-loathing. Nor am I especially plagued when I remember that, but for gambling, I would now be living on a comfortable income from royalties scrimped and saved over 15 years of hard showbiz slog.</p> <p>There is nothing worse in this world than a sore loser, and nowhere is that more true than in gambling. The tax revenues from the big gaming companies help build schools and hospitals, pay for teachers, doctors and nurses. This is something, I tell myself.</p> <p>I do sometimes wonder quietly why walking down any major street in London has to be, for me and my fellow gambling addicts, rather like negotiating Scylla and Charybdis \u2013 Paddy Power or Betfred here, William Hill or Ladbrokes there. But the resentment doesn't last. I have swallowed my pride, sought professional help, attended GA meetings. At the time of writing I haven't gambled, in any shape or form, for several months.</p> <p>The other day, for instance, as I approached Finchley Road, near where I live \u2013 a thoroughfare positively festooned with betting shops \u2013 I conceived a strong urge to have a flutter on the betting machines. What harm could it do, now that I was cured? I found myself walking, like a zombie, towards the nearest of the outlets. I must have forgotten the time I once lost \u00a36,000 trying to win \u00a32 to cover the cost of a piece of broccoli I'd deemed overpriced.</p> <p>Suddenly, like young Stephen Dedalus in <em>A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man</em>, as he walks down Lott's Lane in search of stimulus, then suddenly spins round and heads for home, I turned. The pull on me as I headed back toward the bus stop, and home, was astonishingly powerful. The feeling of triumph as I boarded a bus and headed for Hampstead (where any betting shop manager worth his salt will, at my own request, eject me from the premises on sight) was one that, to anybody who hasn't been there, might seem pathetic.</p> <p>The gambler in me is still looking to recoup, needless to say. But now he does it in different ways. It's a truism to say that no very disastrous experience is without its compensatory positives \u2013 its winnings, in other words. What I have gained from gambling is twofold. Firstly, there is a much-needed sense of one's own fallibility that I suspect was lacking in me before the debacle began. Secondly, and perhaps more usefully, I have acquired a measure of immunity to disaster.</p> <p>Misfortune of sundry kinds, and especially financial, can easily be put into perspective by the mere recollection of the mayhem one has been through. That is a perhaps not inconsiderable boon in these days of, for many of us, unwonted austerity and ongoing financial uncertainty. I am, if you like, a mini Greece, only a stop or two ahead, with a viable reconstruction package already in place, and working. Whether this is all bunkum, and I turn out to be another De Quincy \u2013 bragging about how he'd beaten his addiction to opium when he was taking the stuff till the day he died \u2013 only time will tell.</p> <p><em>Ranjit Bolt's </em>Cyrano de Bergerac <em>opens at the Roundabout Theatre in New York on 11 October</em></p>",
  "<p>It is a paradox that may or may not console the Lib Dems. Britain does not love its coalition \u2013 in fact, many members of the coalition do not much like it themselves \u2013 but another hung parliament is a quite plausible outcome of the next general election.</p> <p>Senior Labour figures are already half-thinking about a scenario in which they are the biggest party in the Commons, but fall short of securing a parliamentary majority. When members of the shadow cabinet flirtatiously suggest that there are Lib Dems that they could do business with, they are trying to destabilise the coalition, but it is more than just mischief-making. Few senior Labour people believe that their current opinion poll leads are a reliable indicator of a solid Labour victory at the next election. Many Conservatives rant and rail about being forced to share power with the Lib Dems. But the more thoughtful and electorally numerate among them wonder how they can win on their own next time and don't find many answers that are convincing. In both the bigger parties, forward-looking people can see themselves once again seeking the support of the Lib Dems. Providing, of course, that there are enough Lib Dem MPs left to form a coalition.</p> <p>Our opinion poll today underlines the punishing price in lost popularity that they have paid for power. Nor does the poll offer an easy answer to the party about how it might rebuild its support between now and its next rendezvous with the electorate. In the darker corners of their conference in Brighton, there will be Lib Dems conjecturing whether a change of leader might do the trick. There may even be a few who openly advocate replacing Nick Clegg with someone who might be able to retrieve some lost support. But our poll also suggests that the most frequently mentioned someone else \u2013 Vince Cable \u2013 would not be a miracle cure for his party.</p> <p>Rather than waste their time on the leadership question, speculation about which is probably at least a year premature, the Lib Dems would be better off discussing where they want to go. To do that, it would be helpful first to understand how they got here. Richard Reeves, until recently the party's director of strategy, offers some typically candid, illuminating and provocative thoughts about that in a pamphlet for Demos called \"A Liberal Inside\". He writes: \"The impact of the Liberal Democrats on government has been strong and positive. But the impact of government on the Liberal Democrats has been devastating.\"</p> <p>He is right to contend that some of that devastation was an inevitable consequence of the translation from a party of protest into one of power. That was going to be painful for the Lib Dems in almost any circumstances. Even in benign economic times, junior partners in coalition governments almost always lose support the moment they move into office. The Lib Dems' experience in power has also demonstrated just how hard it is to govern as a liberal, especially when hitched to a party with very different impulses. Some of their most cherished objectives, such as parliamentary reform, have been left as roadkill by the juggernauts of Tory and Labour hostility.</p> <p>Damage has also been self-inflicted. They have made some serious mistakes in power, some of which had their origins in errors they made in opposition. The slump in their support has been exacerbated because of the contradiction between how they generally presented themselves for most of the time that Tony Blair and Gordon Brown were in office, as a leftish alternative to Labour, and what they did next, which was to go into government with the Conservatives. In the run-up to the 2010 election, Mr Clegg made an effort to alter both the party's policies and public perceptions of where they sat on the political spectrum, but the social democratic wing of his party resisted.</p> <p>One result, which has had consequences that no one anticipated, was the reckless pledge about tuition fees, the subject of the pre-conference mea culpa by Mr Clegg. The tuition fees policy was a classic opposition pledge, designed to scoop up votes from students without putting much, if any, thought into what would happen if the Lib Dems were ever required to deliver on it. That much their leader has now basically admitted. Some of his advisers counselled against the apology on the grounds that it would be ridiculed and taken as a sign of his desperation \u2013 both of which it has been \u2013 though none of them seems to have anticipated that it would also spawn musical spoofs on the internet. Mr Clegg has embraced the viral mockery, largely because he didn't have much choice. He hopes that he may eventually get some credit for manning up to a mistake and, by doing so, win more of a hearing for the things that the Lib Dems have achieved in government.</p> <p>It is important to be clear, because some of the headlines haven't been, about what he was apologising for. He did not say sorry for breaking the pledge, but for making it in the first place. And the reason they did that was because the Lib Dems were hoping to outbid Labour for votes on the left.</p> <p>That is not going to work for the Lib Dems next time, not least because it would be so incredible. I cannot see a profitable future for the Lib Dems as another social democratic party. Britain already has a well-established social democratic party which is larger than the Lib Dems. It is called the Labour party. Having spent five years governing with the Conservatives, the Lib Dems would be deservedly ridiculed if they went into the 2015 election presenting themselves as some sort of vaguely leftish alternative to Ed Miliband. Nor is there going to be much joy for the Lib Dems in trying to compete with the Tories on terrain which is naturally Conservative. In private discussions within the coalition, Tory strategists sometimes ask their Lib Dem counterparts why the party persists in its liberal approach to immigration and its pro-Europeanism when these positions run against the grain of a lot of public opinion. True enough; they do. But there remains an important slice of the electorate that has generous instincts on immigration and still believes Britain's future should be as an engaged member of the EU. If the Lib Dems are not going to represent them, no one else will.</p> <p>As the Lib Dems have discovered, it is a challenge sustaining a distinctive identity as the junior partner in a coalition. But in some ways, their rivals are helping them carve out some potential electoral niches. It is a long time since I heard David Cameron describe himself as a \"liberal Tory\". It is also a long time since he claimed that a government led by him would be \"the greenest government ever\". The shrivelling of liberal and green Toryism creates space for the Lib Dems to be clearly differentiated from their frenemies in the coalition.</p> <p>In his pamphlet, Mr Reeves makes a strong case that, to be true to their historical traditions and to stand a chance of clawing back some support by the time of the next election, their future has to be as a radical liberal party, distinct in its values and philosophy from both Labour and the Tories, fighting the tribalism of conservatives of both left and right, presenting itself as more compassionate than the Conservatives and more trustworthy with the nation's finances than Labour, and a more reliable guardian of civil liberties than either. His central, positive theme would be the radical redistribution of power away from failed institutions, whether they be Westminster or the banks.</p> <p>Convincingly presented, this prospectus might indeed help the party to rebuild its support. Voters who are instinctively liberal anyway could find their way back to the most liberal of the parties. For more negatively minded members of the electorate, the Lib Dems, for all the mistakes they have made in office, could be the lesser of three evils. Then there are voters who could back the Lib Dems because they don't trust either Labour or the Conservatives to govern on their own.</p> <p>One problem is that those voters may be too thinly spread across the country to secure all that many seats. Another \u2013 the problem they failed to solve at the last election \u2013 is how you write an honest manifesto of your liberalism when you know and the voters know that, if you do get to see power again, it will be shared with someone else.</p> <p>The Lib Dems' biggest mistake at the last election was not the tuition fees pledge, but failing to be clear with the electorate that coalition inevitably means compromise and compromise entails not being able to deliver previous promises. The answer, perhaps, is for their next manifesto to tell us how seriously its commitments should be taken. Signed-in-blood pledges would be ones they vow to stick by come hell, high water and coalition negotiations. Pencil pledges would give fair warning that these commitments were subject to being erased. The final category would be invisible ink pledges, liable to disappear during the first hour of any power-sharing negotiations with other parties. That's something for the Lib Dems to think about. In fact, given that another hung parliament is quite likely, it is something for all the parties to think about.</p>",
  "<p>In 1957 Jack Kerouac, suddenly famous as the authentic prophet of the Beat generation, wrote to Marlon Brando to ask him to star in a film adaptation of his novel <em>On the Road</em>. The instantly legendary book, written in three weeks on a single roll of paper, had just been published to contentious acclaim, and Kerouac, never a man scared to dream, had high hopes that the film could be a similar fast-forward phenomenon. He imagined himself starring in it as his questing alter ego Sal Paradise, alongside Brando, who would take the part of Dean Moriarty, the fictional version of his Benzedrine-fuelled soulmate, Neal Cassady.</p> <p>In his suitably breathless letter to Brando, Kerouac could hardly contain his excitement at the prospect: \"I'm praying that you'll buy ON THE ROAD and make a movie of it\u2026 \" he wrote. \"Don't worry about the structure, I know to compress and re-arrange the plot a bit to give a perfectly acceptable movie-type structure\u2026 I visualise the beautiful shots with the camera on the front seat of the car showing the road (day and night) unwinding into the windshield, as Sal and Dean yak\u2026 You play Dean and I'll play Sal (Warner Bros mentioned I&#xa0;play Sal) and I'll show you how Dean acts in real life\u2026 we can go visit him in Frisco, or have him come down to LA. [He's] still a real frantic cat\u2026 All I&#xa0;want out of this is to be able to establish myself and my mother a trust fund for life, so I can really go roaming around the world\u2026 to write what comes out of my head and free to feed my buddies when they're hungry\u2026 \"</p> <p>Brando never replied to Kerouac's letter, though he kept it (it sold early this year at auction for $33,600), and the movie of <em>On the Road </em>was often dreamed of but never made by the time Kerouac had drunk himself to oblivion aged 47 in 1969. A young director called Francis Ford Coppola picked up the rights, and in the subsequent 40 years at least five versions of a script were worked and reworked, and almost every up-and-coming actor with a restless soul and an eye for the horizon was linked with the mythological project \u2013 from Dennis Hopper through to Sean Penn. Though the book was the prototype of a hundred road movies and one blueprint for \"bromances\" from <em>Butch Cassidy </em>to <em>Brokeback Mountain</em>,<em> </em>it seemed ever more resistant to adaptation as the decades rolled on. Jean-Luc Godard had come close to directing it as his first Hollywood film; by the time the Brazilian director Walter Salles approached Coppola with the ambition to do it in 2007, the original travelling-light encounter with the American road was freighted with all sorts of baggage.</p> <p>In homage to that fact, before he made the film, and while production money ebbed and flowed, Salles, the director of the <em>Motorcycle Diaries of Che Guevara</em>, made a documentary about the journey Kerouac's book itself had undergone on the way to the cinema screen. One of the first things Salles did when he had finally cast his Sal and Dean was to show them this movie at a month-long total immersion \"beatnik bootcamp\" in Montreal, preparing them for the months of filming ahead. I'm sitting in a hotel in London with Salles's Sal Paradise, listening to him recount some of that history, and the surprise is that he is doing so in a thick Yorkshire accent.</p> <p>Sam Riley, who relishes the accent in question, could never be accused of ducking a challenge. His first screen role was as the ultimate doomed and cultish rock star, Ian Curtis of Joy Division, who took his own life in 1980 and whose fans had the fervour of disciples. It was Riley's mesmerising performance channelling the singer in Anton Corbijn's film <em>Control</em> that convinced Salles he could take on the even more daunting legend of Kerouac. In between times Riley had also set himself up to fail as Pinkie Brown in Graham Greene's <em>Brighton Rock</em>, a remake of the 1947 film which was the benchmark of postwar British cinema.</p> <p>\"<em>On the Road</em> is another one of those,\" Riley says in his cheerfully blunt way, as if it is his fate to play the unplayable, \"a film in which the audience has a very clear idea of who they think your character is, so you know you are asking for it. But that's the challenge. And that's why you know you don't want anyone else to do it. I auditioned for Sal Paradise early in 2009 and it seemed to go well, but I didn't hear anything for 18 months \u2013 and part of me was a bit relieved, to be honest \u2013 but then my agent called and said: 'You start filming in a few weeks' and I thought: 'Fuck, here we go\u2026 ' Walter showing us the documentary he had made didn't help much. He had footage of a lot of Coppola's casting sessions from over the years. The young Russell Crowe and Matthew McConaughey and others. Brad Pitt saying he was glad he eventually got too old to play Sal because it would have been too much pressure. I was thinking: 'Great\u2026 '\"</p> <p>At his hippy retreat Salles had Riley and Minnesota-born Garrett Hedlund, who would play Dean, meet everyone he could find who had known the original Beat double act, writers and drug casualties and people who had been around their San Francisco of the 50s. Neal Cassady's son came for a weekend. And all of these survivors looked Riley up and down. \"Obviously I was as surprised as anyone else that Walter wanted a Yorkshireman to play Jack Kerouac,\" he recalls. \"I remember the first biographer we met, a very nice gentleman whose whole life revolved around academic study of the Beats. Garrett and I greeted him at the door and he said to Garrett: 'You must be Dean.' Then looked over my shoulder and said: 'Which one is playing Kerouac?' I said: 'I am.' He said: 'You are awful tall to be Kerouac, and you don't have blue eyes.' And I started to say something else and he said: 'My God! Are you British?'\"</p> <p>Not surprisingly, after a month of this, Riley and Heglund, and their co-star Kristen Stewart, who plays Dean's wild-child girlfriend, Marylou, were desperately keen to move on. Which was probably Salles's intention. Over the subsequent six months they properly took to the highway. \"Walter wanted us to be as bonded as possible. We had to wrap Kristen's stuff in the first three months so we were flying all over the place to get the right weather,\" Riley recalls. \"We went down to Patagonia for four days for the snow, and then Louisiana, 100% humidity, then Arizona, then Mexico, then Calgary, then we finished in San Francisco\u2026 \"</p> <p>I'd watched the film a couple of days before seeing Riley. That sense of ever-shifting location is its abiding character, along with the diminishing highs of drifting and home-wrecking as Sal and Dean search for their personal nirvanas in sex and drugs and writing and change. Riley and Hedlund and Stewart make a mythical threesome (sometimes in every sense), but the yearning for newness that gave the book its tone, that made it the attention-deficit bible for generations of rootless young men everywhere, is predictably tough to replicate on screen. The sadness of always chasing one last good time quickly becomes repetitive, which is part of the point. After a while only the scenery changes, though there are plenty of memorable characters along the way, notably Viggo Mortensen's William Burroughs.</p> <p>It is a testament to Riley and Heglund that Sal and Dean's complicated love for each other is likably credible throughout. It couldn't have worked had he not got on well with Hedlund, Riley says. \"It was a big ask in that way. Six months travelling together. We couldn't have grown up in more different parts of the world or come from more different backgrounds. But Garrett's not a typical young actor; he's very warm. He was already in character when I met him two years before. It was the part he was born to play, really. He's more considerate than Dean, but all the talking in mad obsessive tangents was completely him. I remember the first morning \u2013 he came in with this poem. He was like: 'I was up late last night and I've written something and I want to share it with you all.' And he read out this amazing poem. I thought: 'Bastard.' And I could see Walter looking at me thinking: 'What have you got?' I was like: 'The dog ate mine, you know... '\"</p> <p>I'm guessing that the film may have cured any vestigial wanderlust in 32-year-old Riley; it looks like the kind of job that makes you happy to get home.</p> <p>He laughs. \"It's odd. I was cured of that already by being in my band.\" In his early 20s, having left his public boarding school, Uppingham, and having been rejected by all the London drama schools, Riley fronted a band called 10,000 Things, in which his brother played bass. They threatened success for a while, playing the Reading Festival, supporting Razorlight and Babyshambles on tour, but it came to nothing in the end. It did in retrospect, though, give Riley some insight into Kerouac's vagabond spirit.</p> <p>What was the furthest they got, I wonder.</p> <p>\"We went all the way to Dundee once, which was a long way in our bus,\" he says. \"We'd bought it from Leeds council and it only had a seat at the front. We had sofas and stuff in the back, mirrored windows. We loved it. In a different town every night. It was great for a while.\"</p> <p>At school Riley had told people who asked that he would either be a rock star or an actor, \"not being cocky, only because acting and singing were the only things I could do\". It was a while coming. The first time he ever saw himself on a screen was the premiere of <em>Control</em> at Cannes five years ago. \"I was lucky it was such a beautiful film,\" he says. \"But it was very weird. I mean like hearing your own voice on an answerphone, but magnified a lot. I think I left nail marks in the arms of the seat. You just fear you are going to do something false. You are just thinking: 'Don't fuck up.' And as an actor I still don't really know exactly what I am doing most of the time.\" You wouldn't guess; his debut won him several awards, including the unofficial accolade of Mark Kermode's actor of the year, but his experience remains limited.</p> <p>He's still only properly been in four films, which makes it a bit like a high-wire act, he suggests. He is grateful for the advice of his wife, Alexandra Maria Lara, whom he met working on <em>Control</em> \u2013 she has been a star in Germany and beyond since she was 16 and was Oscar nominated for her role as Hitler's secretary in <em>Downfall</em>. They live in Berlin, which Riley loves. \"You know, you set out wanting to be as famous as you can be, but then the closer it gets, you get a bit apprehensive,\" he says. He had seen the price of fame up close in brushes with the likes of Pete Doherty, and he could mine some of that experience for the Kerouac film. \"I feel quite safe and isolated in Germany,\" Riley says. \"My wife is very well known there. But I am only looked at when I am holding her hand.\"</p> <p>It allows him to maintain his inner Yorkshireman even, as he mentions in passing, now he is working with Angelina Jolie on the Disney film <em>Maleficent</em>. \"My parents are relieved as much as anything that I'm getting some work,\" he says with a smile. \"They get to visit me on set. I was driving them around Pinewood on a golf buggy. They met Angie. They loved all that. My father is a typical Yorkshireman. When I was about 12 the whole family went to Disneyland \u2013 it was our one real big holiday abroad. So he likes the fact Disney is now paying me. 'Sam, you realise that was like a free holiday now,' he told me.\"</p> <p>As the mother-fixated Kerouac discovered perhaps too late, however hard you try, you can never properly escape where you came from. Riley rather enjoys that fact. \"I caught myself looking at the thermometer outside the house the other day,\" he says. \"To see whether it was warmer than yesterday. I thought: 'Christ, it's happening. I'm becoming my dad.' I'll be getting the map out next and seeing exactly where we drove to in <em>On the Road</em>.\"</p> <p>On the Road<em> opens on 12 October</em></p>",
  "<p>Far from green shoots bursting forth, Lee Hopley, chief economist of manufacturers' group the EEF, sees a shadow falling over British industry. \"It feels like the mood has shifted down over the last quarter: the dark clouds do appear to be gathering,\" she says.</p> <p>Recession in the eurozone, the slowdown in China and the risk that America is heading for a \"fiscal cliff\" are all making exporters nervous, while demand at home remains relatively weak, she argues. The latest official figures showed that manufacturing output in July was 0.5% lower than a year earlier \u2013 though recent surveys show a modest pick-up in confidence.</p> <p>Individual manufacturers echo Hopley's assessment. \"There's been no further drop-off in demand; but if we saw any further drop-off, the patient would be dead,\" says James Greenham, managing director of EMS Physio, which sells hi-tech equipment for physiotherapists from its base just outside Oxford.</p> <p>\"I certainly don't see any uplift in business for the UK,\" he says. Many of his products are for export, which makes EMS exactly the sort of manufacturer Vince Cable is trying to encourage; but Greenham says most markets are seeing a slowdown.</p> <p>\"There's still demand from certain parts of the world \u2013 the Middle East and Asia \u2013 but I'm not aware of any country where the distributor is saying, 'things are brilliant'.\"</p> <p>Having lost out on an \u00a38,000 NHS contract to an overseas rival, Greenham would like to see the government using its procurement budget to back British firms.</p> <p>For Andrew Churchill, the managing director of precision engineering firm JJ Churchill, based in Leicestershire with 130 employees, the situation changes depending on which part of his industry you look at. \"We're seeing a very mixed picture,\" he says.</p> <p>In defence, lead-in times are so long that orders are still bouncing back from the recession of 2008-09. \"We made massive reinvestment during the recession ... and we're well placed to benefit from the recovery.\"</p> <p>When it comes to the parts his firm manufactures for giant diesel engines, though, business has declined by a third; yet the civil aerospace business is still \"brisk\", as is the car industry, where the expansion of Jaguar Land Rover, for example, has had knock-on benefits throughout the supply chain.</p> <p>Churchill would like to see the government take kick-starting growth more seriously. \"From my perspective, I support Osborne's fiscal mandate, and I think the deficit is very important; but we haven't seen any effect with regards to stimulating growth: there's an economic mandate that's missing.\"</p> <p>Green shoot rating \u2605</p> <h2>Banking</h2> <p>By the end of this month, Royal Bank of Scotland will have paid \u00a32.5bn in fees for the insurance it bought from the government to insure its most toxic assets. Three years after joining the asset protection scheme, the bailed-out bank is expected to withdraw from it in the coming weeks after surviving the downturn without having to make a claim on the policy that played such a vital role in keeping it afloat in the dark days of the crisis.</p> <p>That is one green shoot, perhaps, for a banking industry that was brought to its knees four years ago when Lehman Brothers collapsed.</p> <p>But as Ian Gordon, banks analyst at Investec, points out, it is hardly a major step, given that the taxpayer will still be left with an 81% stake in the Edinburgh-based bank. That stake, which once stood closer to 84%, has only been falling because the bank is issuing new shares to outside investors, thereby diluting the government stake.</p> <p>Similarly, the taxpayer stake in Lloyds Banking Group has fallen to just below 40% as a result of the issue of new shares. It is hardly a healthy picture, but in the past two months the share prices of many banks have enjoyed a minor rally \u2013 a sign perhaps that the worst may be over for an industry that has more recently been saddled with scandals ranging from attempting to rig the Libor rate to laundering money for drug barons in Mexico.</p> <p>Yet the launch of the Funding for Lending programme by George Osborne, aimed at getting more credit into the economy, is further evidence that the banking industry is still not functioning normally. Lending by banks to small businesses has continued to decline. The Federation of Small Businesses last week said that 42% of firms seeking loans were being turned down. Meanwhile, BDRC Continental's quarterly SME Finance Monitor found that only 43% of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) used external finance such as a bank loan, compared with 51% just three months earlier.</p> <p>The moribund state of the lending market has prompted critics of the banking industry to call for greater state control. Liberal Democrat peer Lord Oakeshott says: \"There can be no sustainable green shoots while the big banks, and critically RBS, are starving small firms of finance\".</p> <p>RBS and Lloyds are already subject to major restructuring programmes to reduce their riskiness.

Earnings from foreign visitors to Britain were 6% lower in July than the same month last year; but there are hopes that business will pick up in the autumn.</p> <p>In Brighton, Etheridge insists, \"business has been great\".

Banks still have billions of pounds of loans on their books from the boom years that they fear may not be paid back in full, as prices continue to drift downwards. \"Their attitude is, 'I'm not going to do anything that isn't as close to 100% safe as it can be,'\" he says \u2013 hence the large deposits many lenders are demanding from first-time buyers.</p> <p>\"Since Funding for Lending was announced, there has been a steady downward movement in mortgage rates,\" says Ray Boulger of mortgage broker John Charcol.

  "<p>Q: What do <a href=\"http://www.junotdiaz.com/\" title=\"\">Junot D\u00edaz's</a> three books have in common? A: Yunior, the flamboyantly unfaithful Dominican narrator who talks a streetwise American-English studded with Spanish slang. This repetition is a brave gambit with an enormous payoff. In <em>Drown</em> (short stories, 1996), Yunior's voice was not quite fully formed. Nervous of its own newness, the book included a glossary for some of the Spanish terms (coyly omitting words such as leche or chochas \u2013 <a href=\"http://translate.google.com/\" title=\"\">Google Translate</a> if you're not hispanophone). <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/feb/23/featuresreviews.guardianreview20\" title=\"\"><em>The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao</em></a> (Pulitzer prize-winning novel, 2007) left the Spanish unglossed and borrowed from the vocabularies of sci-fi and fantasy. Now this second collection refines Yunior's voice further, into an utterly convincing idiolect that takes in delicate literary detail and tough bilingual argot.</p> <p>In D\u00edaz, there are always other stories taking place away from the main narrative. Yunior is centre stage in <em>This Is How You Lose Her</em>: although his brother, Rafa, has cancer, his primary concern is his own life and heartbreaks. D\u00edaz's great achievement is to remain true to the helpless solipsism that possesses all of us most of the time, while allowing the reader to see those other stories on the periphery of Yunior's purview.</p> <p>\"Invierno\" is a spare, unsentimental account of immigration. Rafa, Yunior and their mother have come to New Jersey to join their father. It is snowing and Papi won't let them leave the apartment for weeks. We follow Yunior's struggles with language and his doomed attempts to befriend the white children from the neighbouring apartment. In the background, Papi is having an affair. Yunior is no naive, unreliable narrator; he knows, more or less, what's going on, but he is more worried about taming his afro-ish hair to avoid trouble from Papi (who eventually shaves it off). Here is the beautifully understated ending, when the family \u2013 minus Papi \u2013 finally leave the apartment: \"We even saw the ocean, up there at the top of Westminster, like the blade of a long, curved knife. Mami was crying but we pretended not to notice. We threw snowballs at the sliding cars and once I removed my cap just to feel the snowflakes scatter across my cold, hard scalp.\"</p> <p><em>This Is How You Lose Her</em>: the title announces the theme, which is, overwhelmingly, infidelity. D\u00edaz writes a cracking love rat and the only weak moments are the self-consciously right-thinking ones. (Like \"Otravida, Otravez\", the one non-Yunior narrative, which attempts to tell the woman's side of things.) Alongside the addictive voice and killer eye for detail (\"his stubble quivering in beads of water, compass needles\"), the chief pleasure of these stories is the unflinching honesty D\u00edaz brings to the subject of betrayal.</p> <p>In \"The Sun, the Moon, the Stars\", Yunior loves Magda but cheats on her with Cassandra anyway. Magda asks if Cassandra was good in bed. \"To be honest, baby, it was lousy,\" Yunior tells her \u2013 then confides to the reader: \"That one is never very believable but you got to say it anyway no matter how stupid and unreal it sounds: say it.\" Later, we learn that in the first week of knowing Cassandra, Yunior \"made the mistake of telling her that sex with Madga had never been top notch\". Cassandra advises him \"to find a girlfriend who could fuck\". And they soon wind up in bed together.</p> <p>This is Yunior remembering the beginning of the infidelity: \"The first night we did it \u2013 and it was good, too, she wasn't false advertising \u2013 I felt so lousy that I couldn't sleep, even though she was one of those sisters whose body fits next to you perfect. I was like, She knows, so I called Magda right from the bed and asked her if she was OK.</p> <p>You sound strange, she said.</p> <p>I remember Cassandra pressing the hot cleft of her pussy against my leg and me saying, I just miss you.\"</p> <p>It's all there: every lie dissected, each surprising emotion itemised. A reviewer's cliche, perhaps, but if you liked his two previous books, you'll love this one, because D\u00edaz is boldly, brilliantly, doing the same thing again, only better.</p>",
  "<p>A man steps across the floor of what seems to be a basement or dungeon, on a film shot by a wobbly, handheld camera. Blood, sticky underfoot, runs beneath his boots \u2013 and the camera catches what seems to be a severed head. The scene is being played on a computer screen, watched by an intense young man, transfixed. A beautiful girl looks also, over his shoulder. \"Is that Iraq?\", she asks, squirming at the degenerate and apparently gratuitous cruelty. \"Mexico,\" replies the man with a grunt, clearly terrified himself. Welcome to the latest film by Hollywood's \u2013 even America's \u2013 heretic-in-chief, Oliver Stone. Unsurprisingly, this brief exchange is charged with greater meaning than it appears at first sight, and the film's director has come to elaborate.</p> <p>The physical presence of Oliver Stone is not unlike that of his impact on cinema over the last four decades. He is immediately contrapuntal: tanned leathery skin, khaki waistcoat and black boots in the seamless, breezy tranquillity of a grandiose hotel in Berlin, answering waiters' questions in polite German with a growl, complimenting the pretty-prim waitress on her looks with a gravelly chuckle. And when he gets down to the business of explaining his new film \u2013 sleeves rolled up, hair like that of an old rocker (which he is) \u2013 there is no polite prologue to the heresy. \"Yeah, this is one of America's wild wars that never ends and ain't going anywhere: the war on drugs.\" After all, this is the man who has \u2013 famously or infamously, depending on who you are \u2013 subverted and scorned every norm, rhyme and reason on which the narrative of the US political establishment (and America's strut in the world) is premised, his canon thereby so much greater than the sum of its parts.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/36343/platoon\" title=\"\"><em>Platoon</em></a> and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/89121/born.on.the.fourth.of.july\" title=\"\"><em>Born on the Fourth of July</em></a> were pivotal contributions to America's attempt at reckoning with its own self-generated catastrophe in Vietnam; <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/77907/jfk\" title=\"\"><em>JFK</em></a>, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/61568/nixon\" title=\"\"><em>Nixon</em></a> and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2008/nov/09/w-review\" title=\"\"><em>W.</em></a> retold and revolutionised received wisdom on the death of one president and the lives of two others. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2006/oct/01/drama\" title=\"\"><em>World Trade Center</em></a> rescued the human story of 9/11 from that manipulated by Washington for its own reasons.</p> <p>Perhaps most cogently of all, with hindsight, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/117586/salvador\" title=\"\"><em>Salvador</em></a>, from 1986, was among very few films or mainstream expressions of any kind which looked at the dirty war that ravaged the Americas during the 1980s through a Latin American lens, repositioning President Reagan's role as more that of jackboot than sponsor of the freedom he claimed to be spreading, through alliances with dictators and death squads. And more recently, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/131532/south-of-the-border\" title=\"\"><em>South of the Border</em></a> stood and stands as the only attempt of its kind to document a new dynamic across the hemisphere, and the rise of newly confident leftwing leaders in the Latin Americas, unbowed by the colossus, the US. Stone's latest, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/146822/savages\" title=\"\"><em>Savages</em></a>, is to be seen in that vein \u2013 only the story concerns the country that is a mere 20 minutes walk from Texas across the Rio Grande, and just south of the border from the golden beaches of San Diego. It addresses the first war of the 21st century (which gives us a glimpse of what the rest of it may well look like), the narco cartel war in Mexico.</p> <p>Of course Stone is drawn to this: Mexico's war \u2013 if that is what it is \u2013 has claimed 50,000 lives, and has done so with striking and baffling cruelty. \"A lot of these people have died slowly,\" says Stone, approaching his theme. \"I didn't want to show people being dissolved in acid, and there are plenty of other things we could have shown but didn't, or had to cut.\"</p> <p>Indeed there are: in his hypothetical but meticulously researched film Stone does not detail the sewing of a flayed face to a soccer ball, or the decapitated bodies left dangling from bridges, mutilated corpses strewn along highways or filling mass graves. Strangely, though, the US media seems as keen to avoid mention of the daily litany of death across its underbelly as it is to cover it; even less does the American establishment want to understand <em>why</em> all this is happening, and consider the possibility that there may be deep-rooted economic causes of at least aspects of Mexico's agony for which the US bears some responsibility, quite apart from its insatiable need to consume drugs and welcome the profits they generate through its banks.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/KC2zbOwbeEs?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"276\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/KC2zbOwbeEs?rel=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>High time for a major film about all this, in an America which, as Stone says, \"doesn't give a shit\" \u2013 even though the violence is next door and spilling over the US government's fence through the desert, in defiance of Washington's militarisation of the sieve-like border. America wants there to be a wall along the 2,000 miles it shares with Mexico, like the one that once ran beneath the window at which Stone sits in Berlin. But that is not going to happen when the border is also the busiest commercial frontier in the world, crossed by a million people every day.</p> <p>At first sight, Stone may seem to have flinched from making this badly needed film. <em>Savages</em> is not for the most part set in Mexico, not is it overtly about Mexico, as it might have been. It is an adaptation of a novel by the great American writer on the border and drug war, Don Winslow, about two men: Chon, a traumatised veteran of Afghanistan and Iraq, and Ben, a karmic botanist par excellence. Their combined experience and knowledge enables them to grow marijuana of unrivalled potency and quality. It also helps them secure the devotion of lovely blonde O, whom they share as a narcotic-erotic <em>m\u00e9nage \u00e0 trois</em>.</p> <p>Stone's generic Baja cartel, led by a matriarch called Elena, is set on acquiring the seed if not its growers, and kidnaps O in pursuit of this aim. The boys react heroically, and set out to rescue their woman. In the background is an aspirant <em>deus ex machina</em>, Dennis, a corrupt agent for the Drug Enforcement Administration, who works alongside not only Don and Chon, but also the cartel's vicious enforcer on the US side, Lado.</p> <p>There is detail in the film which Stone is the first \u2013 and only one, north of the border \u2013 to grasp, and the detail is important in reading not only this narco war, but also what it means to modern capitalist society. First is the perverse innovation in the cruelty, for its own sake and its recreational aspect. Stone treats us to the execution of a suspected snitch, hung by his wrists and whipped until he confesses (even though he is innocent), after which he is incinerated alive with a tyre around his arms and torso, running in wild circles to his death. During the scene, there's a moment of mastery: the soundtrack, the cackling laughter of those watching. It takes Stone to work that out. Yes, in Mexico's war, this is <em>fun</em>. \"It's getting crueller out there,\" muses Stone. \"It's gone up a level.\"</p> <p>Another insight is the cartels' mastery of the internet and along with it their satanic sense of humour. The tit-for-tat over kidnapped O is conducted largely through cyberspace, and at one point the cartel sends our heroic duo an animated cartoon of the decapitation of their girl. And there is this about the real-life cartels: unlike the Bosnian Serbs or even al-Qaida, they do not need to speak to us, to the media or politicians, except on their terms. They control their message, they do so through their own <em>mantas</em> or banners, sick but funny notes pinned to the more illustrious victims' mutilated corpses, but above all through the internet \u2013 and in doing so they laugh at us. They have no cause to proselytise, nor is there any retort to them \u2013 that is their sick genius, and that is why they laugh. \"Yeah \u2013 that humour thing,\" says Stone. \"It's something else. It takes someone who knows what's going on to understand it, the humour and the cruelty. I was scared of it, but I wanted to make sure I could keep time with what is going on.\"</p> <p>One of Stone's hallmarks, in films such as <em>JFK</em> and <em>W.</em>, is that he make you suspend disbelief so thoroughly that you can be forgiven for thinking you're observing the real thing, not a dramatisation. In <em>Savages</em> Stone has mercilessly captured the horrific details of Mexico's war and it is tempting to ask why he opted for an action movie with rather annoyingly gym-cut Colgate Californians and a Barbie-blonde stoner as its central characters, instead of something that gets us inside Mexico. Inside, if not the Tijuana cartel, which is now, as Stone himself admits, \"dealing with small pocket change\", then a film about those others who are redefining what a narco cartel \u2013 indeed, criminality \u2013 is in the new world and global economy. The paramilitary Zetas, for example, are an entirely new breed of syndicate, utterly ruthless, apparently unstoppable. It seems a shame that even a film by America's most irreverent director (who has looked at the US through a rare Latin American eyepiece) <em>must</em> be centred on the United States. One would like Stone's take on the world's most wanted criminal, Joaqu\u00edn \"Chapo\" Guzm\u00e1n, fugitive leader of the Sinaloa cartel, or his nemesis, who has overtaken even him for savagery, Osiel C\u00e1rdenas Guill\u00e9n, founder of Los Zetas.</p> <p>But actually I am missing the point completely, thinking this way. Stone has a terrifying and convincing thesis as to why the film has to be set in America, with American characters: \"The point,\" he says, \"is that wars come home, they come home to roost. And there are connections: one of the two main guys has come home from Afghanistan and Iraq, and he's brought all that with him, what I think are new levels of cruelty and combat technology we have out there.\"</p> <p>He drives his theme: \"Of course, humankind has always been cruel \u2013 the Third Reich and so on. But I think there are new levels of cruelty, new technologies now, a new ball game. Maybe I'm wrong, but the cruelty level in the world just went up in these recent wars. We get a lot of information about what's happening in Iraq, the Middle East and Afghanistan, which comes back to America with this guy. And who knows how this may influence what's happening in Mexico \u2013 I think it probably does.\"</p> <p>It's a shocking but cogent point about the nature of the violence, and its arrival into our public domain. Stone cut his teeth in Vietnam, where images of violence (the famous girl on the bridge burned by napalm; and scenes from Stone's own films and past as a veteran) were supposed to shock us \u2013 and did. Now, in reality, all that has volte-faced: the Zetas relay their own atrocities on the web as recruiting posters, and in Stone's film, to parley with their proposed business partners. It has been posited before that the Zetas got their ideas for torture and execution videos from al-Qaida, who in turn respond to souvenir photos taken by American troops of their own abuses in Abu Ghraib. Stone, typically, hurls us to the logical, heretical, conclusion.</p> <p>\"This Middle East thing brought it to another level. The barbarism came back in a big way, and it was Bush who started that. It all began with Afghanistan and Iraq. The guy in the movie brings it home; and the cartel brings it home.\"</p> <p>There are cinematic considerations too: \"It's based on Winslow,\" says Stone, \"and we've made it into a thriller. No, I don't think the cartels would work that way with independent marijuana growers in California. No, there aren't any IEDs going off in the Californian desert \u2013 but,\" and he grins with inimitably Stoneian mischief, \"I like the idea!\"</p> <p>Another subtlety is Stone's depiction of the fall of Elena, the matriarch. This occurs as the result of a mutiny by Lado, who has switched sides to a rival, El Azul, and because she comes to California to visit her daughter. Her collapse \u2013 and with it, by implication, that of her cartel \u2013 could signify the arrival of a greater power, a new cartel led by El Azul. This has happened in real life: Guzm\u00e1n has defeated the Tijuana cartel, which was led by one of the first female <em>capos</em>, Enedina Arellano F\u00e9lix. It could be because \"it's tough taking orders from a woman\", observes Stone of Lado. But it could also be seen as Elena's weakness of character, or at least her old-fashioned view of what a cartel's code should be. As Stone puts it: \"She's a good traditional woman. She's proud of the fact that her daughter is ashamed of her. And her fall is the fall of the don. Elena was weak because she had a thing for her daughter and wanted to rescue her.\" This is exactly it: the mutation of Mexico's cartels from the don of old, with his (or her) attachment to family and codes of honour, however criminal or perverse they were, and the transfer of power to those whose only code is raw ruthlessness \u2013 like Guzm\u00e1n or, to an even greater degree, the Zetas.</p> <p>In <em>Savages</em>, the DEA agent Dennis is corrupt and credible. He protects Chon and Ben for money, takes a bribe to deliver them Elena's daughter, and gets to strut and moralise at a press conference when Elena is finally felled \u2013 having himself switched allegiances to El Azul along with his contact, Lado. The role is in part shaped by a former DEA agent Stone hired called Eddie, who had \"30 years experience. He was in the Middle East and he knew the scene in Mexico. I got into the DEA that way \u2013 Eddie took care of us; and getting that kind of insight into the DEA is a big deal.\"</p> <p>Lado is a credible character who \"wants to be an American\", says Stone. \"He takes his kids to little league, his wife worries that he's out last thing at night with his 'gardening business' \u2013 his cover, and of course he has other women. He comes in one night, and she can smell a woman on him and he takes her apart, he rapes her \u2013 but we had to let that scene go.\"</p> <p>Lado \"also has eight or nine chihuahuas at his feet\", observes Stone, and it is a detail to relish though the scene was cut: \"I've been to a couple of these drug lords' places\", he says, \"and it's like ocelots to them. They've got all these hairless chihuahuas, proud of the fact that 'they cost me a fucking fortune'.\"</p> <p>Stone's conclusion focuses less on the economic backdrop in Mexico than the failure of the war on drugs. Stone of course takes this further, entwining his themes. First: \"That border is going all day and all night long. And it's 2,000 miles long. There's no way they're going to stop this. Dammit \u2013 they tried to build a wall across Berlin!\" He gestures out of the window towards Starbucks, where no-man's land used to be: \"Walls don't work, period.\" And second: \"I don't see anything coming out of this so far as the war on drugs is concerned. It's been 40 years now, and its just become a method by which more money can be generated to fight what they now call narco-terror.\" And here's the crux, the entwinement again: \"Drugs and terror, they couple them together, and the drug war becomes part of the war on terror that never ends. Part of the total terror that is overcoming our lives.\"</p> <p>Apart from connections to the Middle East already made, it is impossible to continue in this vein without invoking <em>South of the Border</em> \u2013 indeed it is impossible to discuss any Stone film in isolation from the others.</p> <p><em>South of the Border</em> is a documentary series of interviews with those who are bringing Latin America to a new critical mass, a shift in power vis-a-vis the United States. All of them are elected, leftwing presidents of countries that have been, as Stone puts it, \"in Uncle Sam's backyard\", but which now brandish a new self-confidence, after decades of American puppet regimes: N\u00e9stor and Cristina Kirchner of Argentina, Luiz In\u00e1cio da Silva of Brazil, Rafael Correa of Ecuador, Evo Morales of Bolivia, Paraguay's Fernando Lugo and, famously, Hugo Ch\u00e1vez of Venezuela.</p> <p>In January 2008, Stone's audacious recent history on the theme of <em>South of the Border</em> began in this newspaper, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2008/jan/06/film.usa?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">with an interview he gave</a> the <em>Observer</em> in Bogot\u00e1 in which Stone refused to condemn the Farc guerrillas, with whom he was trying to negotiate the release of three hostages. With him were N\u00e9stor Kirchner and Hugo Ch\u00e1vez. \"I remember it well!\" he half-laughs now. \"I was on a mission. I wanted to stay low key. N\u00e9stor was there, and Hugo, and the American Red Cross, flying into this shithole of a town. Anyway, the Red Cross helicopter arrives, and, well, it was called off. The Farc people are always wary of the CIA, and I think the Americans just couldn't have Hugo involved in anything that would be a success \u2013 the hostages were released shortly afterwards, after Hugo had gone.\"</p> <p>He reflects now on the wider theme: \"The numbers don't lie. These are countries which have seen growth and real improvements after being failed by neo-liberal economics. The US took the side of the bad guys constantly \u2013 the media covering up so many of the abuses, in Argentina, Chile \u2026 But now, for the first time, these countries have thrown off the stranglehold of the International Monetary Fund and US treasury, which made loans the terms of which were those of what they call the 'neo-liberal Washington consensus' \u2013 [to] not only pay back the loans, but conform their economies to the privatisation of the kind we have here: hospitals, military, prisons. Well, in South America, privatisation did not work, it had disastrous consequences.</p> <p>\"And what they essentially did in the last 10&#xa0;years was to throw off that tyranny. Their people have suffered so much, and they voted in new leaders. But even after they were elected, these people were resented by the US. I've never read one positive word about anything these people have done in the US media \u2013 let's face it, the Americans don't accept the idea of the election of leftwing leaders in their own backyard.\"</p> <p>Accordingly: \"Each one of these leaders has been picked off, one by one, by the United States&#xa0;\u2026 Disunite them, break them off from each other. But they've stood firm, and I think this is an important moment. They've done good for their countries, and I hope they last.\"</p> <p>There is a connection between <em>Savages</em> and another Stone film, in fact two of them: <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/89165/wall.street\" title=\"\"><em>Wall Street</em></a> and its recent sequel, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/135251/wall-street\" title=\"\"><em>Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps</em></a>. Chon and Ben have a money-launderer, a finance geek who has left the big bank for whom he worked. In real life, however, we now know that this would be no freelancer; this would be the man from the bank itself, in suit and tie, protected all the way to the top. The scandal and outrage of major high street banks laundering Mexican drug cartel money has made headlines recently: <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2012/jul/17/hsbc-executive-resigns-senate\" title=\"\">American Wachovia and British HSBC</a> were the first to be named and shamed \u2013 with more on the way \u2013 but the typical fines in such cases fall well short of proper punishment.</p> <p>The banks' direct connections to the cartels' bloody war and the misery of drugs inevitably causes Stone to reflect on his two films about what was once his father's business, in those distant days when, he says \"a bank was something that you saved with, and gave you a loan\". He says of the money-laundering: \"You kind of get a sense of where the real power lies. Gekko [his character in <em>Wall Street</em>] was an 1980s creature. But by 2008-9, the banks had changed. What Gekko was doing in the 1980s, everyone was doing \u2013 rigging things, fixing things \u2013 the outsider Gekko had become the system. Look at them! Making money with the money they took from the public, and gambling with it! You have these huge settlements, with AIG underwriting Goldman Sachs \u2013 and it's all over New York, that level of confidence, that level of arrogance and impunity. You go to the Hamptons, and you feel it.\" And there is an inevitable connection between this financial elite and the corporatisation of government.</p> <p>\"The United States,\" he says, \"has been a corporate-controlled country increasingly since world war two. The concept of a national security state plays into that concept of us as a mega-corporation. I view the Pentagon as essentially a huge corporation. The United States has moved into corporate gridlock, and the gridlock controls us \u2013 the power of the lobbyists, banks, oil companies, pharmaceuticals \u2026 After Reagan triumphed in 1980, we had this embrace of the free market. But it's not a free market really, it's fixed. Because monopolies tend to dominate it, they come to the fore and push everybody out of the way. So it's a rigged playing field, like we saw in 2008 \u2013 the banks getting bigger and bigger.</p> <p>\"And you know the weird thing?\" he asks, as if to the street below, those around the Brandenburg Gate. \"Everyone wants to buy into that shit! The people take their cue from whoever has the power and the money! Go into the Four Seasons in New York, and power is the hero! No one wanted to talk about the poor Vietnamese when this all started, or the poor people in Latin America \u2013 no, we embrace power!\"</p> <p>He goes on: \"I don't think Americans give a shit about out there. They don't understand why in the Middle East everyone hates America. They don't understand the 'backyard'. JFK did, and so did Henry Wallace when he was vice-president. They both tried to turn it round \u2013 and what happened? As soon as JFK was assassinated, Lyndon Johnson said he'd crank it up in Vietnam. In Latin America it was: 'Enough of this Alliance for Progress' shit, what about the $9bn we've got invested down there?'\"</p> <p>Which brings Stone to another subject he wants to talk about; for it never rains, it only pours with this tempest of a man. As <em>Savages</em> premieres, get ready \u2013 at the end of this month \u2013 for the publication of his book and thereafter the 10-part television series (to be shown in Britain next year) on which it is based, <em>The Untold History of the United States</em>. Working with the American University historian Peter Kuznick, Stone has compiled a series which, he says \"is inspired by your British series <em>The World at War</em> \u2013 pure narrative, no talking heads and actors to portray some of the players. Ten one-hour programmes; everything's been fact-checked and now CBS has a copy. It's an unorthodox, true global story about America. About how Truman did not have to drop the atomic bomb that all the kids get taught was dropped to save lives and stop the war. That isn't why it happened, it was so that the world would become a huge amphitheatre for America. It's about the true origins of the cold war, which we all think was started by the Russians when they invaded eastern Europe (he gestures towards the window again, sun glinting off an S-Bahn train trundling through the glorious iron-and-glass station at Friedrichstrasse \u2013 not long ago, the overground platforms were in East Berlin; the underground ones were an interchange for the West Berlin U-Bahn system).</p> <p>\"It's about Truman after the war, a small man, a cold warrior and a political hack. After the war, we tried to demobilise, but it didn't last long. They created this legacy of rightwingers who pulled at this alarm that we were falling behind the Russians. But the Russians never achieved anything like parity \u2013 maybe at the end of the 1970s, but it broke them.\"</p> <p>This is not history for history's sake, however \u2013 this is the history of our present and future, long beyond cold war, into war on terror, war on drugs: \"It's the history,\" says Stone, \"of our building the national security state, which is interested in nobody's security apart from that of the state. Always supposedly falling behind the enemy, so there would be no end to it. It's a legacy thing,\" he pleads, almost. \"The American history our kids are reading is all upside down. Everything is the opposite to what you think.\" With Stone, a conversation can only return to the beginning \u2013 in the best sense \u2013 \"because it is all interconnected\", as are his films. But there is not time \u2013 though he does afford himself a valedictory thought that sends a shiver down the spine.</p> <p>\"This terror that we're supposed to be so terrified of \u2026 What the fuck is it? Why should we all be so scared? Well, there's big money in it, for sure. So now we have every form of technology at the disposal of the government and its war on terror \u2013 but who are we supposed to be terrified of? <em>Why</em> must we be so terrified?\" For want of any further answers to his terrifying rhetorical question about being terrified of terror, Stone affords himself a joke, for like all good heretics, he is a jester too, at the court of America: \"Jeezus!\" He swallows a small bowl of salad dressing, neat, and rises from his chair. \"The idea that the government is doing all this to protect <em>me</em> from <em>marijuana</em>!?\"</p> <p><em>Savages was released on 21 September.

  "<p>The extraordinary 2,000-mile journey made by millions of butterflies each autumn from Canada, through the USA to Mexico is revealed in minute detail for the first time in a multimillion-pound 3D film. The insects' hair, scales and body movements in flight can be seen with a clarity that moved scientists at a preview screening to tears.</p> <p>Filming the migration of the monarch butterfly took five years and was made possible by the development of new technology. The film's British director, Mike Slee, used the pioneering 3D \"snorkel system\" which can film insects in 3D \"like nobody else before\".</p> <p>Micro CT and MRI scans for medical purposes have also been adapted to view inside a chrysalis, showing a caterpillar transform into a butterfly over a period of two weeks.</p> <p>It is thought that<em> Flight of the Butterflies 3D</em> \u2013 which has its world premiere tomorrow \u2013 could do for butterflies what the feature documentary <em>March of the Penguins</em> did for penguins.</p> <p>Monarchs have orange and black wings with distinctive veins and spots, but so detailed is the technology that every butterfly looks individual.</p> <p>The scales on their wings and \"punk\" hairstyles on some heads stand out vividly. So too hundreds of tiny breathing tubes feeding air into the pupa, \"like shredded wheat,\" Slee said. \"Nobody's ever seen in 3D inside a chrysalis as it changes from caterpillar to butterfly.\"</p> <p>He added: \"You watch a caterpillar morph into a butterfly, one of nature's most extraordinary moments. I still can't believe it when I watch it \u2026 It's rather like when they first brought out ultrasound and you could see a baby in the womb.\"</p> <p>Almost all the butterfly footage is shot in slow motion \u2013 120 frames per second rather than 24.</p> <p>Tomorrow's premiere takes place at the Smithsonian, Washington, one of the world's most respected educational institutions, with a UK cinema release to follow. Scientists were overwhelmed by the footage at a preview. One of them, Chip Taylor, said: \"The film is \u2026 truly extraordinary \u2026 I have been amazed by the overwhelming emotional reaction that revealing the scientific secrets of the butterfly has had \u2013 even the eminent board of science advisers had moist eyes when the lights went up.\"</p> <p>Slee made his name as a film-maker of natural history programmes and directed the film <em>Bugs! 3D</em>, about two rainforest insects, narrated by Dame Judi Dench.</p> <p>\"But <em>Bugs</em> was almost wholly shot on film, whereas <em>Butterflies</em> uses digital technology that has changed natural history film-making. Digital allows you to be closer,\" said Slee.</p> <p>The success of <em>Bugs</em> prompted cinemas and several foundations to support this new production, a collaboration between Britain, Canada and Mexico, which follows the quest of one man, the late zoologist Fred Urquhart, to uncover the secret of the butterflies' annual migration. After 40 years, Urquhart discovered their hideaway in remote central Mexico where they spend the winter before returning north.</p> <p>The monarch has multi-purpose antennae and tactile sensory receptors on its head, legs and feet that help it navigate and migrate long distances. Their migration involves flying 25 to 30 miles a day, although some tagged individual monarchs have covered hundreds of miles in a few days. Catching free rides on high altitude winds and storing fat reserves, after arriving, they rest for months in the evergreen trees on the mountaintop.</p> <p>Slee estimates that there are 50m butterflies per hectare, with the sites covering more than six hectares: \"That's a possible 300 million monarchs.\"</p> <p>The film shows millions of them dancing in slow motion. Each wing beat is a whisper, but the film-makers achieve a combined wash of sound.</p> <p>Filming was difficult in 3D and 10,000ft up a mountain, requiring 70ft camera cranes and a 100 crew.</p> <p>Slee said: \"Shooting wildlife in 3D is technically complicated. Things can't come too close to camera, but how do you tell millions of butterflies to stay away? We had to work out tricks. They only fly where there's sunshine. So we created big shades in front of the camera so they wouldn't accidentally come into our danger zone.\"</p> <p>The film could also play a part in the monarch's conservation. Scientists are extremely concerned that monarch populations are declining because the caterpillar's only food source \u2013 milkweed \u2013 is being eradicated.</p> <p>SK Films, the American distributor, is encouraging audiences to grow milkweed and also to create their own butterfly gardens by selling seed-packets in cinemas.</p> <p>The film dispels the myth that butterflies live only for a day. Monarchs create about four generations each year. Those from the first three generations live only a few weeks, but it is the fourth \u2013 known as the \"super generation\" \u2013 that migrates south and survives for between five and six&#xa0;months.</p> <p>\"It's all triggered by daylight and warmth,\" Slee explained. \"They genetically don't mature, and use the spare energy from not having sex to fly 2,000 miles.</p> <p>\"That's their ace. They fly to Mexico, where there's this perfect forest and perfect climate. They go into a dormant state and hang in the trees until the sun shines on them again, and they come back to life. That generation will fly back north to lay eggs \u2026 and the story begins&#xa0;again.\"</p> <p>But even butterflies get lost. Earlier this month, a monarch was spotted in&#xa0;Dorset.</p>",

  "<p>On police videotape, a 19-year-old girl named those she believed had intended to kill her. They would try again, she said. \"People are following me, still they are following me. At any time, if anything happens to me, it's them,\" she told the officers calmly. \"Now I have given my statement,\" she asked an officer, \"what can you do for me?\"</p> <p>The answer was very little. Banaz Mahmod went back to her family in Mitcham, south London. Three months later she disappeared. It was several months before her raped and strangled body was found and four years before all those responsible for killing her were tracked down and jailed. Her father and uncle planned her death because the teenager had first walked out of a violent and sexually abusive arranged marriage, and later had fallen in love with someone else.</p> <p>Now a documentary is to be premiered at the Raindance film festival, which opens this week, that includes for the first time some of the recordings made both by Banaz herself in the runup to her murder and the videotapes of some of the five visits she made to police to report the danger she felt herself to be in and name, before the event, her murderers. She told how her husband was \"very strict. Like it was 50 years ago.\"</p> <p>\"When he raped me it was like I was his shoe that he could wear whenever he wanted to. I didn't know if this was normal in my culture, or here. I was 17.\" Her family were furious when she finally left him.</p> <p>The so-called honour killing of Banaz, who was murdered on 24 January 2006, shocked not only the country but also the police team, who faced a daunting task in bringing her killers to justice. They faced an investigation within an Iraqi Kurdish community, many of whom believed Banaz had deserved her fate for bringing shame on her father \u2013 a former soldier who fled Saddam Hussein and had sought asylum in the UK with his wife and five daughters. Mahmod Mahmod and his brother, Ari, were jailed for life for their part in the murder in 2007, but two other men involved fled to Iraq and were extradited back before being jailed for life in 2010.</p> <p>Detective Chief Inspector Caroline Goode, who won a Queen's Award for her dedicated efforts in getting justice for Banaz, said she found the case harrowing. In most cases police get justice after a murder for the family. \"In this case the family had no interest whatsoever in the investigation. It was an absolute outrage that this girl was missing and nobody cared.\"</p> <p>The film also shows the continuing effects of the killing, with both Banaz's boyfriend and her sister, Bekhal, still living in hiding and in fear. Bekhal has put her own life at risk by her decision to give evidence against her family in court. She now \"watches her back 24/7\".</p> <p>Remembering her sister, she tells the film-makers: \"She was a very calm and quiet person. She loved to see people happy and didn't like arguments, she didn't like people raising their voices, she hated it. She just wanted a happy life, she just wanted a family.\"</p> <p>The film, <em>Banaz: A Love Story</em>, was made by the former pop star and now music producer and film-maker Deeyah. Norwegian-born, but of Punjabi and Pashtun heritage, <a href=\"http://deeyah.com/about-deeyah/\" title=\"\">Deeyah</a> has herself been subject to honour-related abuse and her singing career was marred by endless death threats that, in part, led to her giving up touring. The story of Banaz, who died because she just wanted to be an ordinary British teenager, she said, struck an immediate chord with her.</p> <p>\"Despite the horror, what emerges is a story of love,\" said Deeyah. \"What has upset me greatly from the very beginning of this project is how absent Banaz was from her own story. Whenever you see a film about someone who has passed you will always have family, friends, people who knew the person, sharing their love, their memories and thoughts about the person who has died; they have home videos, photos. That was just not the case here at all. The only person speaking for Banaz who had known her alive was her sister. Other than that, everyone else in the film came to know Banaz after she had died.\"</p> <p>A search for other witnesses to her life proved fruitless. \"We tried to find anyone who would have known her, no one came forward,\" said Deeyah. \"Then I came across the videotape with Banaz herself, telling us what her suffocating reality was like. Watching this tape for the first time was among the most difficult things I have ever experienced. I had spent three-and-a-half years working on this film, learning everything I could about this young woman's life and her death, we were in the final editing process and suddenly here she was, when no one else would come forward to speak about her.</p> <p>\"I found it excruciatingly sad to see her and at the same time I felt so glad to finally get a chance to see her and hear her. No one listened to her in her life. As a society we let down Banaz, as her community we let her down. I am sorry she had to die for people to start learning more about this problem, although measures have been taken to improve the understanding around this.</p> <p>\"There is a very long way to go before we can adequately understand, protect and support women at risk. We don't need empty slogans or lip service, we need real concise action on this issue. Living in western societies, we need our lives as 'brown' women to matter as much as any fellow human being.\"</p>",
  "<p>When the Uruguayan president Jos\u00e9 Mujica was asked about his <a href=\"http://www.druglawreform.info/en/country-information/uruguay\">proposal</a> to make a historic break with global prohibition and put in place a legal, state-controlled market for cannabis, he replied: \"<a href=\"http://world.time.com/2012/06/26/uruguay-wants-to-legalize-marijuana-sales-should-the-rest-of-the-world-follow/\" title=\"\">Someone has to be first</a>.\"</p> <p>In fact, recent years have seen reforms to cannabis policy and law proceeding apace around the world. The <a href=\"http://www.release.org.uk/downloads/publications/release-quiet-revolution-drug-decriminalisation-policies.pdf\">trend for decriminalisation</a> of possession for personal use (with civil or administrative penalties replacing criminal ones) has spread across much of Europe, Latin America, and beyond. Some countries have gone further, finding various ways around the strictures of international prohibition (under the three UN drug conventions) to have de-facto legal supply as well. The famous Netherlands cannabis \"coffee shops\" operate under a legal fudge in which their activities are technically illegal, but in practice are tolerated and licensed. The Spanish decriminalisation policy tolerates the personal possession of two plants and has allowed the creation of more than 300 <a href=\"http://www.beckleyfoundation.org/2011/07/01/cannabis-clubs-in-spain/\" title=\"\">cannabis co-operatives</a>. These pool the allowances of all their members, then farm and supply the resulting grass on a non-profit basis to these members from premises managed by the co-operative.</p> <p>Most surprising have been reforms in the US, the spiritual home of the \"war on drugs\" ethos and still its primary cheerleader internationally, despite more than <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/05/22/legalize-marijuana-56-percent-rasmussen-poll_n_1537706.html\">50% of Americans</a> now supporting cannabis legalisation. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Places_that_have_decriminalized_non-medical_cannabis_in_the_United_States\">Fourteen US states have decriminalised cannabis possession</a>, and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_cannabis_in_the_United_States\">17 now allow medical cannabis</a> \u2013 in some cases with the distinction between medical and non-medical use becoming increasingly blurred. Most significant are the <a href=\"http://nationalcannabiscoalition.com/2012/07/comparing-marijuana-legalization-measures-in-oregon-colorado-and-washington-state/\">three state ballot initiatives</a>, in Washington, Oregon and Colorado being voted on in November, which will legalise and regulate cannabis markets for non-medical use.</p> <p>While the US initiatives are groundbreaking and, if <a href=\"http://blog.norml.org/2012/09/12/new-poll-washingtons-marijuana-legalization-initiative-i-502-holds-huge-lead/\">current polling</a> holds up, may well be the first real cracks in the edifice of global prohibition, they are, like most reforms, being led by (excuse the pun) grassroots campaigns. One of the unique aspects of the Uruguayan legalisation proposal is that it is government led. Indeed, the Mujica proposal for a state monopoly on cannabis production and supply has, ironically, run into conflict with another Uruguayan bill promoted by cannabis activists that seeks to decriminalise personal consumption of up to eight plants and establish co-operatives along the lines of the Spanish model.</p> <p>While unlikely to prove popular in the US, the idea of government monopoly is appealing in many ways, certainly for a pioneering initiative such as this. It is vitally important to learn from the mistakes made with alcohol and tobacco regulation. That means avoiding over-commercialisation and, while allowing legal availability to adult consumers, putting in place a regulatory framework to minimise health and social harms, rather than maximise profits. What this means in practice has been explored in some detail in Transform's <a href=\"http://www.tdpf.org.uk/blueprint%20download.htm\">Blueprint for Regulation</a> which outlines potential controls over products (potency, price, information on packaging etc), vendors (licensing, vetting, training requirements), venues for sale and consumption (location, appearance, opening hours), and availability (age access controls, membership clubs). A responsible government is a far better entity to develop such a model than the free market.</p> <p>The regional context of the Mujica proposal is also critical. The debate on drug law reform in Latin America has accelerated, with multiple heads of state now <a href=\"http://transform-drugs.blogspot.co.uk/2012/02/12-latin-american-leaders-call-for.html\">openly tabling the possibility of wider reforms including legalisation</a>, and the Organization of American States currently reviewing all the options, as frustrations have grown with the <a href=\"http://evolvecms.webfreelancersuk.co.uk/sites/default/files/Crime-briefing.pdf\">deteriorating security situation and violence</a> related to the drug trade. The perception is that Latin America carries an unacceptably heavy burden for drug consumption in the US and Europe, and that the externally imposed solution, a military and police-led war on drugs, is costly and counterproductive \u2013 as Mexico in particular has found out to its cost in recent years.</p> <p>The Mujica proposal is, perhaps unsurprisingly, couched within a bill of security measures and is being primarily promoted on that basis and, as is often the case with drug reform legislation, it includes provisions for increased penalties for traffickers. It also faces a number of other hurdles; it needs to be reconciled with the decriminalisation bill, and it does not enjoy majority public support (40% are in favour). Then are the objections from the guardians of the prohibitionist status quo, the US and the UN drug agencies.</p> <p>If or when the Uruguayan initiative will be realised remains impossible to say \u2013 they may be first, they may not. But it is now clear that someone will be, and soon. After decades of counterproductive failure, the era of blanket global prohibitions on drugs is finally coming to an end.</p>",
  "<p>Thursday evening, President Obama told voters during a televised candidates' forum on Univision, the largest Spanish-language TV network, that he regretted not having enacted comprehensive immigration reform during his first term. He described the lack of reform as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/20/barack-obama-immigration-reform-failure\">his \"biggest failure\" during his first term in office</a>.</p> <p>I share that regret and frustration, but also agree with the president that after election day, we will have a new opportunity to break the Republican gridlock that has thwarted serious immigration reform for decades. But Congressman, you may ask, how could the next four years be any better for enacting immigration reform legislation than the last four years, or eight, or 16? My answer: because of what will happen on election day.</p> <p>President Obama's statement to Univision suggests to me that we will see real leadership from the during his second term \u2013 and I look forward to standing with him to make comprehensive immigration reform a national priority. Election day will be a turning point and significant immigration reform is possible because the dynamics of the issue are shifting.</p> <p>To enact any sensible immigration reform, the Democrats will need to bring 90% of the votes to get a bill passed, but after election day, finding 10% of the votes among Republicans will be a lot easier. If the Republican party is to survive, it must sue for peace on the immigration issue and move beyond gridlock.</p> <p>While jobs, education, and healthcare rank among the top issues for Latino voters, immigration is a threshold issue. If you are opposed to immigration or support strictly punitive immigration measures, you cannot even start a conversation about other issues with most Latino voters. And if your party condones the sharp rhetoric and mean-spirited proposals that some Republicans embrace, it is a tough deficit to overcome. Some leaders inside the Republican party understand this reality.</p> <p>Mitt Romney has fallen with Latino voters and he can't get up. In August, the Romney camp announced a target of attracting 38% of the Latino vote, but his support currently lags in the 20s \u2013 with little chance that it will improve.</p> <p>And in America, we do not elect the president nationally, but state by state, with the electoral college votes of each state you win adding to a national victory. We know how most states will votes, leaving far fewer than a dozen swing states to determine the outcome nationally.</p> <p>Because of Latino voters and their support for Obama, victory looks likely. In Nevada, Colorado, New Mexico, and Florida, Latinos make up significant percentages of the electorate and are breaking strongly for Obama and the Democrats. Even in states like North Carolina and Virginia, where Latinos make up a smaller percentage, the races are so close that how Latinos vote \u2013 both who they vote for and how many turn out \u2013 will probably determine who wins, and therefore who wins nationally.</p> <p>So, I see the day after election day as a day when Democrats look around and say that a huge factor in Romney losing and Obama winning was Latino voters.</p> <p>To be sure, like a lot of constituencies, Latino voters are not as enthusiastic right now about President Obama as they were four years ago. Enforcement of the old, broken system has increased dramatically under President Obama, resulting in record deportations and record expansion of programs to enlist state and local police in enforcing federal civil law, undermining local public safety as a result.</p> <p>The president has accomplished a lot through administrative action to remove threats to our society while allowing assets to our communities to remain in this country. But we can only fully modernize our immigration system through legislation and bring it into the 21st century, including getting more high-skilled immigrants to choose America and reuniting families that sometimes wait more than 20 years for a visa. </p> <p>The Republicans will soon understand how costly their obstruction and wrong-headedness has been, and I think we will be able to return to the table to discuss how we couple legal immigration, legalization for undocumented immigrants, and enforcement in the workplace and at the border into a politically viable and successful immigration reform package. With illegal immigration at an historically low level, we can and must get control of immigration and get millions of undocumented residents into the system and on-the-books.</p> <p>But we will need Republicans who want to help solve the problem to join us.</p>"
