  "<p>David Cameron will be told that he should spend less time on modernising and detoxifying the Conservative brand and focus more attention on core Tory values if the party is to win the next election.</p> <p>Leaders of a new group, Conservative Voice, are to say that the party needs to work harder to ensure it once again becomes the party of aspiration.</p> <p>The group, which is supported by David Davis and Liam Fox, is the brainchild of the <a href=\"http://conservativehome.blogs.com/\" title=\"\">ConservativeHome</a> founder Tim Montgomerie and the former chairman of the National Conservative Convention, Don Porter.</p> <p>Its advisory board includes Conor Burns, who resigned as a ministerial aide over House of Lords reform, and the campaigning Tory MPs Priti Patel, Robert Halfon and Dom Raab.</p> <p>Porter outlined the thinking behind the group in <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/conservative/9194154/The-Tory-party-has-lost-sight-of-its-true-values.html\" title=\"\">a Telegraph article in April </a>in which he called on the party to have the courage to stand up for its traditional values.</p> <p>He wrote: \"In recent times, there has been an almost evangelical focus on the 'modernisation' or 'detoxification' of the Conservative brand. The result has been a growing disconnect between the party leadership and the grassroots, and a loss of clarity, principle and policy direction.</p> <p>\"The Conservative party has, at its best, always been radical and reforming. Under Disraeli and Shaftesbury, it introduced social reforms before Labour even existed.</p> <p>\"But 'detoxification' saw us ignore issues where we were clearly in tune with the voters, such as immigration and Europe. Even just talking about them was seen as reinforcing the supposed 'nasty party' image and alienating voters.\"</p>",
  "<p>It would be hard to deny that Italy, <a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052702304141204577510072562464162.html\" title=\"\">with a public sector debt of more than \u00a31 trillion</a>, needs to trim its public spending. But it is also hard not to regret the Italian government's decision to close its <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/aug/31/bedford-italian-community-consular-services\" title=\"\">special consular facilities in Bedford</a> at the end of this month as a result. It is an act that will deprive one of Britain's oldest Italian communities of services upon which many of them still depend. It is more than 50 years since the London Brick Company went recruiting in southern Italy, producing a migration that gives Bedford the third largest Italian population in the UK, after London and Manchester. The brickworks are long gone, but the Bedford Italians remain, as many as 20,000 of them on some estimates. They have passport, visa and pension needs which, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-beds-bucks-herts-19516596\" title=\"\">as they protested at the weekend</a>, are better provided locally than in London or online. The Bedford Italians are an unusual community that should be cherished, by Britain and Italy alike.</p>",
  "<p>Is Nouri al-Maliki becoming Iraq's next dictator and, if he is, does anyone in Washington care? The second half of the question is easy to answer. The Pentagon wanted to keep 8,000 troops in Iraq after withdrawal. But Maliki made it clear there would be no US troops after the agreement expired on 31 December 2011. The state department also planned for an embassy up to 16,000 strong, and a CIA station 700 strong, but the Iraqi strongman made short shrift of a sizeable US civilian presence, by insisting that his office take direct responsibility for approving every US diplomatic visa. Washington could use the soft power of military supply contracts, but is unwilling to do that. Maliki is allowing Iranian overflights to resupply Assad's embattled regime in Syria. Washington still does not want to know.</p> <p>As to the first part of the question, Maliki's authoritarianism has some way to go before it reaches the proportions of Saddam Hussein's terror. But the charge sheet is growing: the night of the US withdrawal, troops and tanks led by Maliki's son surrounded the houses of his vice-president Tariq al-Hashemi and two other members of the Sunni-dominated Iraqiyya coalition. On Sunday <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/10/iraqi-vice-president-attacks-verdict\" title=\"\">Hashemi was sentenced to death in absentia</a>, for masterminding death squads against rivals. Confessions were tortured out of three of his bodyguards, one of whom died from his injuries. Iraqiyya, which won the most seats at the last election in 2010, is not the first victim of Maliki's power grab.</p> <p>As Toby Dodge, a leading Iraqi scholar, has <a href=\"http://www.iiss.org/publications/survival/survival-2012/year-2012-issue-3/iraqs-road-back-to-dictatorship/\" title=\"\">chronicled</a>, Maliki gained complete control over Iraq's security forces, subverting the formal chain of command, moving the office of commander-in-chief into his office, and creating provincial command centres, commanded by generals who were handpicked by him. Under him, the Iraq special operations forces, described as the best in the Middle East, became a praetorian guard, dubbed \"Fedayeen al-Maliki\". The same goes for the intelligence services and the judiciary. Having seen off those Sunnis who downed their arms and tried politics in 2010, Maliki's next target will be the Kurds, whose autonomy he will threaten, and then the Sadrists. The end product will be a centralised state not unlike Vladimir Putin's Russia. Like Putin, Maliki practises a form of competitive authoritarianism. This employs the toolkit of a democratic state (a parliament, set elections, a constitution) for a purpose that is anything but \u2013 the maintenance of power at all costs, torture and death squads included.</p> <p>It should therefore come as no surprise that al-Qaida, which was decimated when Sunni tribal chiefs turned against it, is back in business. Maliki's quest for domination could drive his country back into civil war.</p>",
  "<p>Barely 10 weeks before voters from Cornwall to Cumbria are due to elect their first police and crime commissioners, Trish Branson is an unusually well-informed citizen. Most midweek passersby in Leicester's busy city centre can only offer a puzzled frown when asked what they know about the government's policing plan. But Branson knows enough to be concerned about it.</p> <p>\"I've heard that several candidates have had to step down because of minor criminal convictions when they were teenagers,\" says the adult social care adviser. \"I'm also wary because we seem to be going to get people with no background in the police who see things from a business point of view. We need a balance between business efficiency and meeting the needs of the voters.\"</p> <p>That fear may be misplaced, along with predictions that political extremists or law-and-order populists would rush to fill the 41 new posts across England and Wales: an English Defence League (EDL) candidate is standing in Bedfordshire, but there is little evidence of the EDL, British National Party or wannabe Clint Eastwoods making much impact so far, though there are colonels and ex-police superintendents aplenty, an air marshal and at least one ex-SAS man.</p> <p>Ministers deplore what they dismiss as \"anti-democratic pessimism\" about their experiment. Critics, who include the Electoral Reform Society (ERS), say the government has only itself to blame for negative publicity when it floats an important initiative, but does so hastily and on the cheap. Even the minister driving the policy quit this week.</p> <p>The predictable result is that in Leicestershire \u2013 as elsewhere \u2013 the most that voters seem to have registered is a string of complaints about hastily-drafted rules. The ban on magistrates standing was reversed last month, but not the ban on youthful convictions. Last week veteran councillor Mike Quigley, 65, stood down as Tory choice in Nottinghamshire over a drink-related offence committed on his 21st birthday. In Derby Labour's candidate, Alan Charles, was first told he was debarred and then reinstated \u2013 over a conditional discharge when he was 14.</p> <p>The lack of state funding available for candidates, even for the traditional free mailshot to every voter, may add to such confusion. Even the usually bullish Electoral Reform Society predicts turnout may be only 18.5%, half the modest level for local elections each May, not in autumn damp and dark.</p> <p>\"No one has a clue how these elections will work out,\" warns Sam Chapman, a Lancashire councillor and ex-police officer who reports on all 41 campaigns on his invaluable <a href=\"http://topofthecops.com/\" title=\"\">TopoftheCops</a> website.</p> <p>Despite airy assurances from Nick Herbert, who resigned as police minister for unrelated reasons in this week's reshuffle, that the internet, local and social media will fill the gap, all candidates seem agreed it is going to be a struggle relying on hustings and radio phone-ins.</p> <p>Leicestershire, which includes the micro-county of Rutland, is one of the smaller police authority areas to vote on 15 November, and has only 2,000 officers.</p> <p>So far the contest here is no more or less typical than elsewhere except that the Tory flag-bearer, Sir Clive Loader, is an ex-Harrier combat pilot, later an air chief marshal of the RAF, the most senior military candidate standing. He happens to live locally in Wing. The winner of a three-man shortlist, Loader, 58, currently faces a Labour city councillor, Sarah Russell, 32, and Suleman Nagdi, 55, an independent. Others may still stand.</p> <p>A soft-spoken businessman and community activist as well as a spokesman for the city's large Muslim population, Nagdi's extensive contacts reach into Whitehall and the police training college at Bramshill, Hampshire. A former teenage refugee from east Africa, he is now a deputy lord lieutenant of Leicestershire, with two sons in the police. Nagdi is respected, Russell is a popular deputy mayor, but Loader is the man that reporters spot popping into police HQ to talk policy. Though the rural \"doughnut\" around Labour Leicester is pretty Tory (seven of the area's 10 MPs) he insists the result could be close.</p> <p>The government's theory for bringing in directly elected commissioners was that a suitable supply of public-spirited, independent-minded candidates would materialise, willing to risk losing their \u00a35,000 deposit (the threshold to save it is a 5% vote), raise their own campaign funds and take the flak for four years if elected to the \u00a365,000-\u00a3100,000 jobs.</p> <p>The new officers are not just about setting police budgets and priorities, sacking the chief constable if necessary. They will be police and <em>crime</em> commissioners (PCCs). As such, they will be \"public safety mayors\", galvanising councils and other local partners, driving improvements in the whole criminal justice system. That includes sluggish courts, child protection, victim support and problem family management \u2013 as well as replacing shadowy police authorities in holding their force to account.</p> <p>In the language of the \"new localism\" that means refocusing away from Home Office or party priorities towards voter concerns. It is the long-term crime-reducing side of the brief that most exercises thoughtful candidates in Leicester and elsewhere, aware that some voters will prefer headline-grabbing gimmicks to patient slog.</p> <p>\"The voters' priority in Leicester and Leicestershire is neighbourhood policing and how to keep it in the face of cuts,\" says Russell, the Labour candidate.</p> <p>When Labour ministers flirted with the idea of electing PCCs, to make the police more responsive to voters' priorities for crime and justice, the police led the charge against the idea. Ministers then backed off. But David Cameron and Theresa May were not to be deterred and have pressed ahead despite flagging coalition poll ratings and unpopular cuts in police budgets that could play badly for them in November.</p> <p>Rival party moods feel different. Labour opposed the Tories' PCC legislation, but knows it must field candidates \u2013 unlike the cash-strapped Lib Dems, who have decided not to organise nationally (likewise the Greens and Plaid Cymru). But the Lib Dems' leader, Nick Clegg (who had these elections delayed from May), will not stop local associations getting involved \u2013 or backing independents.</p> <p>Some will, including Avon and Somerset, where Lib Dems reckon their councillor Peter Levy has a chance in a supplementary voting system. Will coalition loyalty deliver second preference votes \u2013 unless Ukip stands as it plans to in most contests? Tactical voting could be important. In Birmingham a Lib Dem councillor, Ayoub Khan, is eyeing the post, one of the few ethnic minority candidates in mainstream contention.</p> <p>Ahead in opinion polls, Ed Miliband should be optimistic. But Labour looks at sprawling county-based policy authority constituencies and knows the formula favours the Conservatives, the opposite of the rural/suburban \"wasted votes\" complaint at general elections. Despite Tony Blair's best efforts, law and order remains a Tory cultural issue that excites their activist base \u2013 and cash \u2013 more than Labour's. Who better to lead the charge against police budget cuts, so the shires argument runs, than a retired colonel or a lantern-jawed air marshal who once led the RAF's 31,000 personnel and handled a budget of \u00a32.5bn?</p> <p>These are unprecedented elections for unusual jobs in untested constituencies, a contest with plenty of theories and irrelevant polling data but no satnav. Turnout will be crucial and good independent candidates know it will be tough to generate voter awareness without a familiar party wrapper \u2013 unless they are already high-profile local crime-fighters or celebs. In such large constituencies merely appealing to the anti-politics mood of voters will probably not be enough to win.</p> <p>So, despite its hard-done-by moans and earlier selection of candidates (all done by mid-June), Labour can hope to win a minority of the 41 posts, mostly in the big metropolitan forces (London has no election because as an elected mayor, Boris Johnson is already a de facto PCC), including Manchester, where the sitting MP, Tony Lloyd, got a clear run at the party's nomination. Eyebrows were raised at suspected deals over the Manchester seat Lloyd will vacate. He is one of seven Labour MPs and MEPs, past and present, in contention.</p> <p>In Hampshire a row is bubbling over the selection of retired Tory MP, Michael Mates. A spritely ex-colonel and security minister, Mates is now 78 and unrepentant over his high-profile support for Asil Nadir, the jailed Polly Peck fraudster.</p> <p>In the West Midlands the favourite to win is another Labour politician, the Wolverhampton councillor Bob Jones, who brought in his defeated rival, Yvonne Mosquito, as his prospective deputy. Jones deplores the \"Americanisation\" of UK policing, but that is another lurking misapprehension. There are dozens of models of US police accountability, none of them quite like Britain's new one. America's most famous reformist cop, Bill (\"Broken Windows\") Bratton, was appointed or elected in three different ways to run \u2013 not merely oversee \u2013 the New York, Los Angeles and Boston forces.</p> <p>In South Wales \u2013 with its 1 million voters from Swansea to Cardiff and the Valleys \u2013 another MP, the former Welsh secretary and first minister, Alun Michael, won the Labour nomination, and his son, Tal, won the nomination in North Wales after resigning as the force's chief executive. His success is less certain than his father's.</p> <p>Also doubtful is that of Hamish Sandison, a Labour barrister fighting Gwent. His independent rivals include an ex-police sergeant, Chris Wright, and Ian Johnston, the Gwent force's own ex-chief superintendent.</p> <p>As in mainstream politics, women make up barely 20% of declared candidates. On Merseyside the Blairite Jane Kennedy, a former security minister in Belfast, beat a fellow ex-minister, the combative Peter Kilfoyle, and the police authority chair, Bill Weightman, to the Labour nomination. Voter hopes are high that the winner will stand up to what is widely seen there as a tradition of arrogant and heavy-handed policing.</p> <p>Most famous of all among the Westminster and Strasbourg retreads seeking election is Lord Prescott, 74, but still restless for elective action. The former MP for Hull East beat a Humberside local police chief, Keith Hunter, by only 552 votes to 458 in the party ballot and made himself a tempting target in the process. Ukip's local MEP, Geoffrey Bloom, is one of those trying to topple him one last time: a contest to watch.</p> <p>In Northamptonshire Ukip is backing Jim MacArthur, whose CV includes a stint in the SAS \u2013 though it is Labour's nominee, the union official Lee Barron, who has boldly promised officers will spend 90% of their time on the street.</p> <p>Sam Chapman (Tory runner-up to Tim Ashton in Lancashire) believes Ukip has \"a very significant opportunity\" on 15 November to expand its appeal beyond Euroscepticism. The party says it knows it and is weeding out sub-standard applicants that might embarrass it. Nominations formally open on 8 October and close on 19 October.</p> <p>Elected PCCs will take over from police authorities a week after polling day (transition teams are hard at work) and if the Home Office's imminent publicity campaign makes its intended impact, then the PCCs will soon feel the heat of public expectation. The job is comparable to being a minister of state in Whitehall, but far more exposed, says Alun Michael.</p> <p>The history of devolving power from Whitehall is littered with fiasco and retreat, especially in England, where Labour's hopes for regional government were rejected in referendums, as were Tory plans last May for elected city mayors \u2013 except in Bristol, which will elect its mayor on 15 November too.</p> <p>Elected PCCs have been imposed without any pilots, let alone local referendums. It could be another flop \u2013 or an unexpected success. Most voters may be ignorant of the concept, but they know what they want. \"More police on the streets would be nice,\" snaps one man in Leicester. \"It was a big mistake closing our police station,\" says another outside Tesco in Oakham, the county town of Rutland. \"My impression is that they're taking our police officers away and it's all being done now from far away in Leicester.\"</p> <p>Squaring the divergent circles of perception and reality against a background of cuts will be the task facing Leicestershire's new PCC and other lucky winners as winter draws in.</p>",
  "<p><strong> </strong></p> <p>France's richest man, Bernard Arnault, head of the LVMH luxury group, is suing the leftwing newspaper Lib\u00e9ration for publicly insulting him.</p> <p>Arnault launched a lawsuit on Monday after the paper carried a large photograph of the business tycoon with the headline \"Casse-toi riche con!\" (Get lost, rich jerk) on its front page.</p> <p>The headline echoed the former president Nicolas Sarkozy's insult to a farmworker who refused to shake his hand at the national agricultural show.</p> <p>Sarkozy told the man: \"Casse-toi pauv' con!\" (Get lost, poor jerk).</p> <p>The Lib\u00e9ration story referred to Arnault's announcement that he was seeking Belgian nationality just a day before President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande confirmed a 75% tax band for those earning more than \u20ac1m a year.</p> <p>Hollande has called for exceptional \"solidarity\" from the rich to help France overcome its economic woes that include high unemployment, public debt and stuttering growth. Hollande has said there will be \"no exceptions\" to the new tax and asked business leaders to lead by example by paying up.</p> <p>Lawyers for Arnault, ranked the world's fourth richest man with a net worth of around $41bn (\u00a325.6bn) by Forbes magazine, announced in a statement that he was suing Lib\u00e9ration for public insult over the headline, which he described as vulgar and violent.</p> <p>Arnault, who transformed LVMH into one of the world's largest luxury firms after taking charge of the group in 1989, has denied that becoming Belgian is an attempt to cut his tax bill and said it was being done for business reasons. He insisted he would continue paying his taxes in France, but his protestations cut little ice with France's governing Socialists.</p> <p>Lib\u00e9ration pictured the suited businessman carrying a suitcase and smiling, and described his demand for Belgian nationality as \"a symbol of the selfishness of the richest\".</p> <p>The move could be the first step towards obtaining citizenship in Monaco, Lib\u00e9ration said. As a Frenchman in Monaco, Arnault would be required to pay French taxes. But if he drops his French nationality after becoming Belgian, he could avoid them.</p> <p>\"France, love it or leave it,\" read the headline on the front page of the Communist daily Humanit\u00e9.</p> <p>The LVMH group includes Christian Dior, Louis Vuitton, Guerlain, Hennessy cognac and the champagne label Mo\u00ebt et Chandon, among others.</p>",
  "<p>It was a statement to gladden the heart: \"I make no apology for attacking spivs and gamblers who did more harm to the British economy than Bob Crow could achieve in his wildest Trotskyite fantasies, while paying themselves outrageous bonuses underwritten by the taxpayer.\"</p> <p>So declared Vince Cable, to thunderous applause, in September 2010 at the Liberal Democrat conference. Crow's transport strike quickly blew over. Bankers' greed and larceny did not.</p> <p>The only problem in all of this was that Cable was in charge of policy towards business in a Conservative-led government \u2013 square pegs and round holes.</p> <p>Nothing, and everything, has changed in the ensuing two years. Cable remains in his job. The Tories remain in office. However, the austerity sacrifices have not paid off as the economy continues its drift into nowhere, and the brief love-in between coalition partners has gone sour.</p> <p>Relations between David Cameron and Nick Clegg are cool but correct, with the coalition's big strategic issues being dealt almost exclusively between the quartet \u2013 these two plus George Osborne and Danny Alexander. Cable has been kept at arm's length by a Tory party that dislikes his politics and by Lib Dem leader who suspects his motives.</p> <p>Undeterred, Cable ploughs his own furrow. While a deficit hawk, he opposes the Tory desire to make it easier to sack workers; he sees the immigration clampdown, especially on universities, as counter-productive; he is against Heathrow expansion; and he would love to introduce a wealth-property tax.</p> <p>Enhanced by his unintentional outburst about the evils of Rupert Murdoch (which took him from embarrassment to vindication in a matter of months), Cable believes that he is on the right side of most of his disputes with the Conservatives, and that most Lib Dems agree with him.</p> <p>He is probably right. But he might be advised, for the sake of his own ambitions \u2013 let alone for the fortunes of his party \u2013 to temper his enthusiasm. No politician with nous \u2013 let alone one from a competing party \u2013 should allow himself to be duped by an <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/sep/09/vince-cable-rebuffs-conservatives-deregulation?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">Ed Balls bearing garlands of praise</a>. Labour showed in 1997 and 2010 that it has little interest in working with the Lib Dems and that its heart it remains intensely tribal.</p> <p>This does not mean that there won't be a future Lib-Lab coalition, but that the junior partner should treat any inquiry with extreme caution.</p> <p>Labour's first choice, understandably, is outright victory in 2015. Its second choice would be a coalition with an emasculated Lib Dem group of 10-20 MPs, happy to take any crumbs from the table. One or two jobs lower down the cabinet table might be offered in return for support. Cable, if he is not careful, is putting himself in a position to be that grateful suitor.</p> <p>Cable is delighted by the attention. Who wouldn't be? He is addressing the concerns of many existing Lib Dems about the relationship with the Conservatives, while pressing the buttons of members and supporters who have almost certainly moved over to Labour, the Greens or others. He embodies the aspirations of the social democratic wing of the party, but the former Shell executive and original <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Orange_Book:_Reclaiming_Liberalism\" title=\"\">Orange book</a> signatory is not a \"lefty\", as is often portrayed. The chances are slim, but he may end up dislodging Clegg \u2013 not through a challenge, but if the present leader steps down before the election. There are no serious rivals to Cable, which helps to explain why Labour believes it is in a win-win situation. It can draw its man in, while destabilising an already unhappy&#xa0;coalition.</p> <p>Cable needs to box more cleverly, to keep his distance from both sides (and not just from the one is he is supposed to be notionally working with). He should learn from his boss's misguided rose-garden love-in with Cameron in May 2010. Clegg has been made to pay for an excess of trust in others who did not have his interests in mind. Cable is in danger of falling into the same trap.</p>",
  "<p>After weeks of speculation about which of Team GB's Olympic stars would be strutting their stuff on Strictly Come Dancing, the BBC has confirmed that medal winners Victoria Pendleton and Louis Smith will be among the celebrity line-up for this year's series.</p> <p>Like every Olympic athlete, Pendleton, the gold-winning queen of the velodrome, and Smith, the gymnast who picked up individual silver on the pommel horse and team bronze, were facing a period of adjustment to their newfound fame after the London Games.</p> <p>But for this pair it will not be their first brush with showbiz. Smith auditioned unsuccessfully for The X Factor in 2009, while Pendleton is no stranger to glossy magazine shoots and has starred in a TV ad for hair brand Pantene.

  "<p>Good for the Republicans trying to mix it up, color-wise. Speakers at their convention last month included South Carolina Governor Nimrata \"Nikki\" Haley, whose parents emigrated from the Punjab, and Mia Love, a Haitian-American Mormon running for congress in Utah. They reached out to Latinos with New Mexico Governor Susana Martinez and Florida Senator Marco Rubio, and to African Americans with former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice. Craig Romney, the nominee's youngest son, even gave a speech in Spanish.</p> <p>But a few sprinkles of chocolate and caramel don't change the overall flavour: Republicans are <a href=\"http://www.gallup.com/poll/118937/republican-base-heavily-white-conservative-religious.aspx\">still vanilla</a>. A <a href=\"http://www.nationaljournal.com/daily/romney-and-black-voters-an-uneasy-relationship-20120827\">recent NBC/Wall Street Journal poll showed that among African Americans</a>, Mitt Romney polls at 0%. Yes, zero. That doesn't mean absolutely no black people will vote for him: former presidential candidate and pizza king Herman Cain says he will. So do Representative Allen \"Democrats are Communists\" West, of Florida, and Texas Congresswoman Stefani Carter, who has just been named to Romney's \"Black Leadership Council.\" But the poll data mean that very, very few African Americans, fewer than the poll's 3% margin of error, support Romney. </p> <p>He does better with Latinos: between 25% and 30% (pick your poll) claim they're willing to give the ticket a whirl. Nevertheless, if the Republicans are to win in November, they will have to do it with <a href=\"http://nymag.com/daily/intel/2012/08/2012-or-never-for-gops-white-base.html\">white voters</a>. Romney's own campaign numbers gurus say he needs at least 61% of them. </p> <p>That might work \u2013 this year. But it will probably never work again. White America is shrinking. In 2012, for the first time in modern history, the majority of babies born in the US belonged to some kind of \"ethnic minority\". According to the Census Bureau, in 25 to 30 years, non-Hispanic whites will no longer make up a majority of the US population. If the Republican party continues to cling to plutocracy, misogyny, homophobia, and racial division, it will be, as President George HW Bush (surely the whitest of white men ever to occupy the White House) would say, \"in deep doo-doo\".</p> <p>South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham, one of the GOP's brighter bulbs, worries that they're \"losing the demographic race\". He told the Washington Post:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"We're not generating enough angry white guys to stay in business for the long term.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Ed Rollins, a senior strategist, agrees, calling his party \"a bunch of old white guys\", who are ignoring the way the country is heading:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"We need to basically broaden the base, we need to have more women, we need to have more Latinos, we need to have more African-Americans.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Good luck, gents. Most American women are pretty keen on getting equal pay for equal work, now made easier by the 2009 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/sep/06/republican-gender-gap-mirrors-womens-pay-disparity?newsfeed=true\">Lilly Ledbetter Act</a>. Paul Ryan, along with most Republicans in the House of Representatives, voted against it. Women also want to be in charge of their, you know, lady-parts. Yet Republican-controlled state legislatures have tripped over themselves to introduce laws forcing women seeking an abortion to undergo transvaginal ultrasounds to get, as one pious supporter called it, <a href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/mojo/2012/03/transvaginal-ultrasounds-coming-soon-state-near-you\">\"a window into her womb\"</a>. This year's Republican platform document declares that since \"life\" begins at the nanosecond of conception, abortion is verboten \u2013 even if the woman has been raped, even if carrying a pregnancy to term would jeopardise her health. Zygotes: good. Women wielding vaginas: bad.</p> <p>Republicans wonder why \"family values\"-loving Latinos favor godless, gay-marriage-promoting Democrats over them.

  "<p>The man who invented the emoticon claims the whole thing has gotten out of hand. In 1982, professor Scott Fahlman sent an electronic message to his colleagues at Carenegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh advising them on how best to clarify if they'd written something funny or not. \"I propose the following character sequence for joke markers: :-)\", the message ran. It continued, unnecessarily: \"Read it sideways.\" In 2012, Fahlman is less chipper about his creation. He fears he has unleashed a monster.</p> <p>\"I think they are ugly,\" said Fahlman this week of the now ubiquitous smiley. Not all smileys though, just the ones that are coloured yellow. \"They ruin the challenge of trying to come up with a clever way to express emotions using standard keyboard characters\", he told the <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/happy-30th-birthday-emoticon-8120158.html\" title=\"\">Independent</a>. \"But perhaps that's just because I invented the other kind.\"</p> <p>The other kind are what we might call your traditional emoticons. The yellow kind we might call <em>emoji</em> (after the Japanese graphic characters from which they derive). The former are characteristically used to convey emotions. The latter can perform that function too, but they can also just simply say \"ice cream\" or \"crab moving sideways\". Thirty years on, maybe it's time to ask: what have emoticons ever done for us?</p> <p>Well, first, they can help to clarify the presence of a joke. Irony is often flat on the page, a boss once told me, and it turns out my ironising is flatter than most. An emoticon at the end of a sentence can retrospectively tell people that they should have laughed at that, that there's still time to laugh at that and, if they don't laugh at that, then the problem lies with them. The same applies, by the way, to making people cry.</p> <p>However, emotional steerage is just one use for <em>emoji</em>. Sometimes you just post a small graphic of a smelly but cute little turd just for the heck of it. For three months I appended every other instant message with cool shades <em>emoji</em>, even though \u2013 half the time \u2013 I didn't even feel that cool. For me, the primary function of the emoticon (either kind) is not to provide emotional content to my online conversation. What my <em>emoji</em> are really saying is \"Look, I know how to fuck around on the internet!\". That is an important message to convey. Anyone who watched the first episode of the new season of The Thick of It on Saturday will know that. There is no greater insult in the 21st century than someone suggesting you don't \"get\" the digital world. Any discomfort you might feel in seeing conversation reduced to 140 characters, or porn becoming the new books, has to be suppressed for fear of humiliation and subsequent cyberbullying.</p> <p>For those lucky enough never to have known a world without <em>emoji</em>, however, there are different questions. Like what is really lost by communicating entirely in corny cartoon pictures? The haterz, aka those who are proficient in the English language, may say that a lot will be lost. But they would, because they've spent a significant amount of time teaching themselves to talk in polysyllables and don't want to feel they've thrown it away. A young child, however, may decide the most apposite and explicit way of describing their current mood would be to post an <em>emoji</em> of a stinking, but still rather cute turd.</p> <p>I predict that, in the next 30 years, the use of emoticons will head in a direction that would have caused the 1982 version of Professor Fahlman to soil his drawers. I just don't know whether it would be in a good way or not. Such is the heady, fizzy state of the internet right now that sometimes I think we're on the verge of an entirely new mode of expression and communication. Other days I just think :((</p>",

  "<p>BP has agreed to sell some of its Gulf of Mexico oil fields for $5.6bn as it builds up cash reserves ahead of potentially huge fines for 2010's Deepwater Horizon disaster.</p> <p>The British oil giant is selling its interests in older smaller fields in the gulf to Plains Exploration &amp; Production of Houston.

  "<p>The world's only global system of carbon trading, designed to give poor countries access to new green technologies, has \"essentially collapsed\", jeopardising future flows of finance to the developing world.</p> <p>Billions of dollars have been raised in the past seven years through the United Nations' system to set up greenhouse gas-cutting projects, such as windfarms and solar panels, in poor nations. But the failure of governments to provide firm guarantees to continue with the system beyond this year has raised serious concerns over whether it can survive.</p> <p>A panel convened by the <a href=\"http://unfccc4.meta-fusion.com/kongresse/cdm69/templ/play.php?id_kongresssession=5255\" title=\"\">UN reported on Monday</a> at a meeting in Bangkok that the system, known as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/jul/26/clean-development-mechanism\" title=\"\">the clean development mechanism</a> (CDM), was in dire need of rescue. The panel warned that allowing the CDM to collapse would make it harder in future to raise finance to help developing countries cut carbon.</p> <p>Joan MacNaughton, a former top UK civil servant and vice chair of the high level panel, told the Guardian: \"The carbon market is profoundly weak, and the CDM has essentially collapsed. It's extremely worrying that governments are not taking this seriously.\"</p> <p>The panel said that governments needed to reassure investors, who have poured tens of billions into the market, by pledging a continuation of the system, and propping up the market by toughening their targets on cutting emissions, and perhaps buying carbon credits themselves.</p> <p>Governments have a last chance to restore confidence in the system when they <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/nov/29/qatar-bid-2012-climate-talks\" title=\"\">meet in Qatar this December to discuss climate change</a>. But few participants hold out any hope that they will agree to toughen <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/feb/02/55-countries-greenhouse-emissions-pledge\" title=\"\">their 2020 emissions targets</a>, which are scarcely even on the agenda. Instead, governments are <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/dec/11/durban-questions-and-answers\" title=\"\">focusing on drawing up a new climate change treaty by the end of 2015</a>, which would stipulate emissions cuts for the period after 2020.</p> <p>Under the CDM, developers of projects to cut carbon emissions in developing countries receive a UN-issued carbon credit for every tonne of carbon dioxide the project avoids. This applies to a wide range of activities, from building new windfarms and solar panels, and distributing more efficient cook stoves and lights, to the installation of technology on factories to prevent the release of certain industrial gases.</p> <p>The system was set up under the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/mar/11/kyoto-protocol\" title=\"\">1997 Kyoto protocol</a>, after years of debate, but no credits could be issued until that treaty finally came into force in 2005. Since then, just over 1bn CDM credits have been issued.</p> <p>These carbon credits can in theory be bought by the governments which are obliged by the Kyoto protocol to cut their emissions, to count against their targets. In practice, however, with the US refusing to ratify Kyoto and big emerging economies such as China, India and Mexico carrying no emissions-cutting obligations under the treaty, Europe is the only market of any size. The EU <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/jun/07/ets-emissions-trading\" title=\"\">has its own cap-and-trade emissions scheme</a>, under which heavy industries are awarded a quota of carbon they can emit, which they can top up by buying the UN credits.</p> <p>But the recession and Eurozone crisis have whipped the rug from under this market. As industrial activity has declined, and the after effects of too-generous carbon quotas early on work themselves through, few EU companies now need to top up their carbon quotas. To make matters worse, the current phase of the Kyoto protocol ends this year, and of the world's major economies only the EU has pledged to continue it.</p> <p>All of this has combined to bring about a collapse in the price of UN credits, from highs topping $20 (\u00a312.50) before the financial crisis to less than $3 each today. At such rates, many potential projects are not commercially viable. Financiers and project developers have abandoned the market in droves.</p> <p>MacNaughton warned that critics of the market, who argue it does not do enough to cut emissions, could end up regretting its demise, because the years of work it took to set up the market could not easily be replicated. \"This is a stable framework, with functioning mechanisms and standards and legal [procedures], and all the things you need for a market. People are assuming this will all still be there in a few years when they want it again, but I don't think it will [unless they act],\" she said. Even if countries decided on reform, no new system could start functioning before 2020, so the CDM could \"play a bridging role\".</p> <p>Mitchell Feierstein, chief executive of Glacier Environmental Funds, said the CDM had long been overshadowed by bigger opportunities for green investors. \"Carbon markets will exist [in future] but certainly not as they exist today,\" he said. \"Investment capital will continue flowing into the innovative technologies which increase energy efficiency while reducing global dependence on fossil fuels. Private capital is now more easily deployed in other investment opportunities without the bureaucratic hassles of the current CDM.\"</p> <p>But the CDM still has its optimists. Flora Yu, of the carbon specialist IdeaCarbon, said the market was likely to continue, as some countries \u2013 including Australia, China and South Korea \u2013 have been developing their own cap-and-trade carbon markets, which they will want to link to a global system. \"There is still a potential opportunity for the CDM, to further develop the amount of money and resources that have already been invested in it. We think it is not going to go away.\"</p>",
  "<p>Dish after dish arrives at the tables: succulent lamb, cloud-ear mushrooms, steaming corncobs and whole roast fish. Bottles of beer are quickly replaced as glasses clink and empty.</p> <p>The 30 guests of honour in this cheery Beijing restaurant are taken aback less by the abundance than by the fact of the dinner itself. After all, these are labourers from the province, and they have never met their host before. The wealthy entrepreneur is treating them as part of a new scheme to bridge a social gulf: Invite a Migrant Worker to Dinner. Organisers hope 10,000 fellow urbanites across China will follow suit.</p> <p>\"I didn't believe it at first. We all thought it was a joke,\" said Wang Wenyuan, a foreman who moved from rural Shanxi province to the capital three years ago. \"It's impossible for us to be asked to dinner. This is the first time I've&#xa0;been invited by a city person.\"</p> <p>China's 150 million migrant workers are the force that has powered its economic miracle, yet they are treated as second-class citizens. The country's <em>hukou</em>, or household registration system, divides people into urban and rural dwellers and allocates their rights to services such as education and health accordingly. Migrants have little choice but to keep moving. The real income ratio between town and country is more than 5:1, <a href=\"http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2012-08/14/content_15676185.htm\" title=\"\">according to recent research</a> \u2013 a&#xa0;gap around 26% wider than in 1997. But those who construct the cities' buildings and clean their streets are condemned to poorer services, greater vulnerability and, often, the disdain of established residents.</p> <p>Tonight's diners talk not just about the punishing hours and the years away from home and family, but about the petty indignities: the glances from urbanites when you climb onto a bus with a bundled quilt or, still grimy from the day's labour, pass them on the street. \"If there are 10 people, maybe two of them will treat us like equals. The rest still look down on us,\" said builder Li Yunfei. Though some think attitudes are improving, with city residents admiring their work ethic, the stereotypes are oddly familiar to western ears: migrants are dirty and uncouth. They undercut wages and overwhelm services.</p> <p>Yang Pei, the young woman who devised the dinner programme, says she hopes that sitting down to eat together will allow the two groups to get to know each other. \"I hope the word <em>nongmingong</em> [rural or migrant worker] can fall out of use and people will feel ashamed to use it,\" said Prof Wang Zhenyao of Beijing Normal University, one of several scholars backing the scheme. \"People tend to think cities can get rid of them. But without those migrant workers, cities cannot function properly.\"</p> <p>Older workers, who always intended to return home, may not care so much. But younger ones want to become urban citizens, yet see no hope, said sociologist Lu Huilin of Peking University. \"They feel the disparity between their lives and those of city dwellers,\" he said. \"They are unsatisfied. They hold grudges against and even show their contempt for urban citizens.\"</p> <p>Last year, <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/06/14/us-china-labour-migrant-idUSTRE75D0ZK20110614\" title=\"\">a report by an official thinktank</a> warned the new generation would become a threat to stability unless given the rights they deserve. <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/06/27/us-china-riot-idUSBRE85Q07G20120627\" title=\"\">Clashes have already occurred</a> between migrants and longer term residents. Such friction has <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/mar/01/chinese-newspapers-migrant-workers-rights\" title=\"\">fuelled growing calls</a> for drastic reform or outright abolition of the hukou, designed for a planned economy that no longer exists. Trial schemes have allowed migrants to register as urbanites within their home region. But officials worry about the strain on cities, potential instability and the mammoth cost of&#xa0;expanding welfare. The pilots have had mixed results, with migrants reluctant to give up their farmland, fearing inadequate compensation and the loss of their safety net. When substantial programmes falter, it is hard to imagine a meal \u2013 or even 10,000 \u2013 overturning entrenched discrimination.</p> <p>It is easy to be cynical; the dinners were launched by recruitment site Gongzhongwang, where Yang Pei works, and several have been hosted by celebrities, with television cameras at hand to record their generosity. Tonight's dinner is hosted by Victor Yuan, a well-known media personality. But supporters say high-profile figures and publicity are exactly what's needed to shift wider attitudes. And Yuan \u2013 who grew up in a&#xa0;family of pig farmers \u2013 gives each guest&#xa0;his mobile number.</p> <p>Such connections can matter. The construction crew's last boss hired them to work 10-hour days for three months, then refused to pay. When they protested, he sent thugs to beat them and warned them not to take things further: he had relationships with people that mattered, they didn't. The workers were about to head home when they were invited to dinner. \"After this, I'm trying to persuade them to stay. I will try my luck again,\" said Wang Wenyuan.</p> <p><em>Additional research by Kathy Gao</em></p>",
  "<p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/07/mildred-nevile-obituary\" title=\"\">Mildred Nevile</a> was a long-time board member and trustee of Cafod. She used to talk endlessly about the individual acts of generosity of ordinary Catholic families inspired by Cafod's appeals for Biafra or Cambodia or Ethiopia: the couple who had donated the money they had saved up for a new carpet for their living-room because others needed it more; the working man going without beer for Lent.</p> <p>She never promoted herself, but through her breadth of experience she became a role model for women, and I was somewhat in awe when I first met her. We were two of the three Catholic participants on an ecumenical visit to Cuba in the early 1980s. As we emerged from the airport, separated from the rest of the party, the atmosphere was of a balmy, tropical Caribbean isle, with small knots of people, chatting, laughing, smoking cigars and eating ice-creams; not a uniform in sight, and no sign of our government minders, or our colleagues. Mildred giggled: \"Did we come to the right island?\"</p> <p>We found a hotel and holed up for the night. \"What if they never find us?\" Mildred joked. The next day we were discovered, admonished by the Cuban officials, and reunited with our delegation. In those 24 hours, I had got to know her effortless warmth and wit; for the next two weeks, she impressed our hosts with her relentless passion for the cause of social justice for the poor.</p> <p>She never wore her religion on her sleeve. She was never preachy. And yet at the heart of all she did was a deep faith. She once said: \"My goal has been to find ways for the Catholic church to become actively involved in the issue of justice. There is now an assumption within the church that a Catholic should do something for those who suffer and are underprivileged.\"</p>",
  "<p>We have all wanted to sound profound and sophisticated at one point in time. To say with one's nose up in the air that one only reads classics and the cr\u00e8me of English literature. But there are some books that we teenage girls cant resist. Anything remotely gossipy, which reflects on our lives of living for boy bands, ice cream and wanting a pair of shoes we know we can never have. Karen McCombie is the reason that the classics are growing fungi in the back of the book shelf.<br>Because her books are strangely addictive!</p> <p>The Love's are one of those rare families that are left in the world.

Then, teenage life happens. And teenage life has the ability to mess up anything. Literally anything. Your best friends, your grades, and your self esteem, above everything else. And Rowan starts to lose herself in it all. Trying to find who she is, and who she's meant to be.</p> <p>It's real. That's what I love. When we read books about Victorian orphans and children losing their parents in violent accidents, they generate truck loads of sympathy and praise, but how many authors actually focus on boring daily lives?

  "<p><strong>BP </strong>has continued its divestment programme by selling $5.55bn worth of Gulf of Mexico assets to US group Plains Exploration.</p> <p>The deal includes the Marlin, Dorado and King fields, as well as BP's stakes in Horn Mountain and Holstein. It brings the total proceeds from the sale programme instigated after the Deepwater Horizon disaster to $32bn, out of a total target of $38bn. BP's chief executive Bob Dudley said:</p> <blockquote> While these assets no longer fit our business strategy, the Gulf of Mexico remains a key part of BP's global exploration and production portfolio, and we intend to continue investing at least $4bn there annually over the next decade. </blockquote> <p>Analysts said the company had received a good price for the assets, and BP's shares have added 2.85p to 437.55p. Peter Hutton at RBC Capital Markets said:</p> <blockquote> The implied price of the deal is significantly higher than we had expected. We estimated the value of the assets at $2.2bn. <br> We see this a positive progress for BP towards their divestment target, which now reaches $32bn of the $38bn target by the end of 2013, with Texas City ($3.5bn to $4bn estimate) still to come and smaller deals of assets not yet announced. </blockquote>",
  "<p>When I start university this October, you may be surprised to know that the thing I am most looking forward to is meeting the international students. This is one of the reasons why I made the London School of Economics my first choice \u2013 I knew it was very multicultural, the complete opposite of the town in which I live.</p> <p>As the London Met visa scandal continues, it is clear many people have a perception of international students as immigration-rule dodgers at worst, or extremely lucky beneficiaries of a UK university education at best.</p> <p>But few people think about the extent to which students from abroad can improve the education experience for all those involved. International students bring much more than their money to the institutions that teach them.</p> <p>Of course, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/higher-education-network/blog/2011/apr/13/overseas-students-degrees-uk-universities\" title=\"\">as Dr Tamson Pietsch writes</a>: \"Overseas students have been a welcome source of income for British universities.\" When it comes to tuition fees, international students pay far more than home students.</p> <p>This alone is a strong incentive for UK universities to recruit from abroad. The money they bring in can be used to provide new facilities or improve old ones to the benefit of all students.</p> <p>There are further advantages: international students help sustain the UK's academic research, particularly when it comes to subjects like science, engineering and maths. With <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Aq73qj3QslDedEtHdlk5T29Ea2FrMTVMMHRHam1mbEE 11:53\" title=\"\">international students accounting for around 45%</a> of the UK's postgraduate students, some research may not even be possible without international students wanting to undertake their studies in the UK.</p> <p>International students also have a significant impact on both national and regional economies, with a <a href=\"http://www.bis.gov.uk/assets/biscore/higher-education/docs/e/11-980-estimating-value-of-education-exports.pdf\" title=\"\">Department for Business, Innovation and Skills research paper</a> estimating that they account for a contribution of around \u00a38bn to the UK economy. This includes off-campus expenditure as well as their tuition fee contribution. <a href=\"http://www.exeter.ac.uk/media/universityofexeter/internationalexeter/pdfs/Oxford_report.pdf\" title=\"\">A report by Oxford Economics</a> estimated that the GDP generated by international students at the University of Exeter directly supported 2,480 jobs in the city.</p> <p>However, one of the most important benefits of international students is the way they diversify campus. Home students get a broader experience of life by learning alongside students from every corner of the globe.</p> <p>Personally, I feel meeting people with different values and beliefs will help me widen my cultural awareness, gain new perspectives and improve my social skills. I will be coming across people I probably wouldn't have met at all if I hadn't gone to university.</p> <p>LSE has a diverse range of societies that really reflect its multiculturalism, from the Czech and Slovak society to the Chile society. Many host events throughout the year, showcasing dance, music and drama. By attending, local students develop an interest in the culture and politics of other countries.</p> <p>In today's world, international students are good for UK universities and, more importantly, good for a multicultural Britain. It is essential that our universities offer them a supportive environment \u2013 for the sake of their home students as much as those from abroad.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395914479\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2012/5/22/1337679637344/Guardian-students-sign-up-001.jpg\" alt=\"Guardian students sign up banner\" width=\"468\" height=\"60\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Guardian students sign up banner</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>",

Wow, the Paralympics really have changed attitudes to disability.</p> </blockquote> <p><br>The Economist suggests <strong>disability</strong> is <a href=\"http://www.economist.com/node/21562229\">\"the new green\"</a>, and says business may find disability as important as environmentalism. It argues:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Disabled people are not just potential employees. While working at Merrill Lynch, Rich Donovan, who has cerebral palsy, looked at disabled people as an emerging market and found it much bigger than he expected: \"1.1 billion people, that's the size of China.\" He noted two trends. A generation of people who had benefited from disability laws is coming out of education and into work; second, as the babyboomers age, disabilities are spreading rapidly. That means rising demand for products and services for this unprecedentedly wealthy and consumerist generation.<br>Yet when he analysed companies in the S&amp;P 500 index, Mr Donovan\u2014who now runs his own firm\u2014found that only a quarter had a strategy aimed at these markets and only 6% were doing serious business in them. He has devised a \"Return on Disability\" index, which tracks the shares of the 100 firms that deal best with disabled people. Over the past five years it has outperformed the broader stockmarket. Later this month Bloomberg will include this on its financial-information terminals.<br>Such approaches contrast with the way businesses usually look at disabled people: as charity cases, or as needing lots of box-ticking compliance rules and as the source of annoying lawsuits. Good treatment can make business sense, too.</p> </blockquote> <p>But perhaps the key test will be whether ministers' attitudes to disability have changed. Two families' distressing stories highlight the impact of the government's welfare reforms. </p> <p>Lucy Glennon has compiled a <a href=\"http://storify.com/LucyTweeting/welfare-reform-is-causing-hell?utm_medium=sfy.co-twitter&amp;utm_source=t.co&amp;utm_content=storify-pingback&amp;utm_campaign=&amp;awesm=sfy.co_k8Me\">storify of tweets</a> in which Simon, whose fiance has a disability and son is autistic, describes his family's circumstances as they face a benefit cap and his fiance has been placed on a return to work scheme. </p> <p>And Sue Marsh has <a href=\"http://diaryofabenefitscrounger.blogspot.co.uk/2012/09/welfare-warnings-become-reality.html\">published a post by a mother of four whose husband suffered a brain injury almost a year ago</a>, in which she describes how she is fighting for rehousing as well as the rehabilitation and re-education her husband needs:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I fight daily battles, not just on an emotional level facing the fact that my soul mate, my whirlwind romance, my everything, is not the man he was, and all the grief that leaves me to deal with, but surmounting this, then further battles with the benefits system, a car which is on its last legs and not having any idea how I would ever replace it\u2026<br>The system clearly does not work for people who genuinely need it. And I genuinely do!</p> </blockquote> <p>She adds that when she contacted her MP about her situation, she was told to approach the local council. Introducing the guest post, Marsh writes:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>... we spent two years or so warning what the Welfare Reform Bill 2010-11 would do. We were accused of scaremongering, of hyperbole. But we knew what was coming. We knew what this so dreadful piece of legislation was going to do. Though the Government refused to conduct an overall impact assessment, we knew what the overall impact would be. Why? Because the bill, now an act, was referring to our lives.</p> </blockquote> <h2>Other news</h2> <p>\u2022 BBC: <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-19539090\">TUC says 'manage economy like the Olympics'</a><br>\u2022 Children &amp; Young People Now: <a href=\"http://www.cypnow.co.uk/cyp/news/1074577/youth-leaders-dedicated-minister-represent-sector\">Youth work leaders call for a dedicated minister to represent the sector</a><br>\u2022 Community Care: <a href=\"http://www.communitycare.co.uk/Articles/07/09/2012/118506/council-pays-out-50000-for-not-meeting-disabled-mans-needs.htm\">Council pays out \u00a350,000 for not meeting disabled man's needs</a><br>\u2022 Independent: <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/government-plans-to-cut-thousands-of-health-and-safety-inspections-8120984.html\">Government plans to cut thousands of health and safety inspections</a><br>\u2022 Inside Housing: <a href=\"http://www.InsideHousing.co.uk/care/labour-promises-to-improve-housing-for-elderly/6523662.article\">Labour promises to improve housing for elderly</a><br>\u2022 LocalGov.co.uk: <a href=\"http://www.localgov.co.uk/index.cfm?method=news.detail&amp;id=106867\">Olympics legacy begins with travel investigation</a><br>\u2022 Public Finance: <a href=\"http://www.publicfinance.co.uk/news/2012/09/tax-freeze-timing-questioned/\">Tax freeze timing questioned</a><br>\u2022 Telegraph: <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/9531622/Iain-Duncan-Smith-told-millions-will-struggle-to-claim-universal-credit.html\">Iain Duncan Smith told millions will struggle to claim universal credit</a><br>\u2022 Wales Online: <a href=\"http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/2012/09/08/welsh-secretary-david-jones-cornered-by-teenager-over-housing-benefit-cuts-91466-31795418/#.UEtyLXcNOXI.twitter\">Welsh secretary David Jones cornered by teenager over housing benefit cuts</a></p> <h2>SocietyGuardian blogs</h2> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/patrick-butler-cuts-blog\" title=\"\">Patrick Butler's cuts blog</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/sarah-boseley-global-health\" title=\"\">Sarah Boseley's global health blog</a></p> <h2>SocietyGuardian on social media</h2> <p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/SocietyGuardian\" title=\"\">Follow SocietyGuardian on Twitter</a><br><a href=\"http://twitter.com/patrickjbutler\" title=\"\">Follow Patrick Butler on Twitter</a><br><a href=\"http://twitter.com/#!/clare_horton\" title=\"Follow Clare Horton on Twitter\">Follow Clare Horton on Twitter</a><br><a href=\"http://twitter.com/#!/AlisonBenjamin1\" title=\"Follow Alison Benjamin on Twitter\">Follow Alison Benjamin on Twitter</a><br><a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/societyguardian\" title=\"Facebook page\">SocietyGuardian's Facebook page</a></p> <h2>SocietyGuardian weekly section</h2> <p>SocietyGuardian editor: <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/alisonbenjamin\" title=\"Alison Benjamin\">Alison Benjamin</a><br>Email the SocietyGuardian editor: <a href=\"mailto:society@guardian.co.uk\" title=\"\">society@guardian.co.uk</a></p>",

  "<p>After <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/blog/2012/sep/06/history-sea-greenpeace-arctic-sunrise\" title=\"\">setting out from northern Norway last week</a> to witness <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/aug/27/arctic-sea-ice-shrinks-lowest-extent\" title=\"\">this year's record sea melt in the Arctic</a>, we reached the edge of the Arctic polar ice cap this morning. It's far further north than expected, at around 82 deg N, but the annual sea ice retreat here has been nowhere near as great as on the Alaskan side of the ice cap, where it has dramatically pulled back hundreds of miles further than usual.</p> <p>The plan was to send our Danish ice pilot and a photographer up in a helicopter to examine the ice scape, but it was far too foggy and the Norwegian chopper pilot wasn't going up for anyone.</p> <p>There has been much to see, though. Like two polar bears hunting just 150 yards from the boat. We sounded a respectful warning horn as we passed them on our port side but they barely registered us.</p> <p>More remarkably, we saw distinct human footprints on another ice floe. We are possibly 500 miles from any habitation, so whose footprints were they? Where had they come from? How old were they? Had the polar bears got whoever it was? The consensus view is that they could be a year old on a floe that has circulated hundreds of miles and travelled perhaps from as far as Greenland or Svalbard. They could be those of a seal hunter or a fisherman.</p> <p>We are now less than 500 miles from the north pole and the temperature is dropping fast. The plan is to press deeper into the ice to find a good-sized floe where the three scientists, based in Cambridge, Scotland and the US, can set up their instruments to measure ice thickness, wave action and how the waves change as they penetrate the ice.</p> <p>Nick Toberg from the University of Cambridge is working with Ettiore Pedretti, an engineer from the Scottish Marine Institute in Oban, to see how waves get under the pack ice and break it up. The impact of the waves on the rapid acceleration of ice loss in the Arctic is a little understood area and they have brought a buoy full of instruments which they will test. Next year they want to return with 25 more buoys to monitor wave action over many kilometres. The data could be vital to understanding how waves expose more water to solar radiation and allow the ice to melt from below.</p> <p>Julienne Stroeve, from the National Snow and Ice Data Centre in Colorado, is here to track and \"characterise\" the ice we pass though. She mostly works from satellite data, but they can't tell the quality or age of the ice or the way it is moving.</p> <p>Greenpeace has its own plans, which I can't divulge, but what ice pilot Arne Sorensen is looking for is a stable ice floe at least two metres thick, 100 yards long and a little less wide. The Arctic Sunrise will then attempt to moor up against it. Then, polar bears, fog, time, weather, ice and much else permitting, we will descend on to the ice for much of the week.</p>",
  "<p>To my shame, I had never heard of Sir Ludwig Guttman until two weeks ago.

I now know a lot more, after the BBC's television film, the Best of Men, a snapshot of Guttman's work at Stoke Mandeville.</p> <p>My mind is blown. Guttman's achievements over a very long period were astounding. To start with, he was Germany's leading neurologist in the late 1920s. Then, as head of the Jewish Hospital in Breslau, he had to suffer the Nazis' gathering persecution of the Jews, from 1933 until 1939.</p> <p>He emigrated with his family to Oxford, where he slipped seamlessly into a job at the <a href=\"http://www.oxfordradcliffe.nhs.uk/home.aspx\" title=\"\">John Radcliffe Hospital</a>. In 1943 he was asked by the government to become director of the new National Spinal Injury Centre at the emergency medical services hospital at Stoke Mandeville. This was an amazing appointment at the time, when many of the German Jewish intelligentsia in the UK had been shipped off to quasi-internment on the Isle of Man.</p> <p>The spinal injury centre was set up because the military expected a lot of spinal injuries from the fighting after the D-Day landings. I am impressed by this foresight, particularly because in 1944 the life expectancy for someone who sustained a spinal cord injury was just three months. No treatment existed, and people were left to die from bed sores, pneumonia and urinary infections. The choice of Ludwig Guttman showed the military had confidence that he, a German Jewish refugee, was the only doctor in the country who could change all that. There seemed to be no British doctors who had made any progress in this field. Wartime presents impossible challenges and demands imaginative solutions.</p> <p>The authorities were right in their choice. Guttman accepted the post on condition he could treat patients in his own way, with no interference. He set up his unit with 24 beds and two patients. Within six months, the number of patients had grown to 60 and, within a few years, Guttman had transformed an 80:20 death rate into 20:80.</p> <p>Guttman's secret was that he treated the whole patient: medically, physically and psychologically. To him, medicine was not a series of little boxes \u2013 unlike much of today's medicine. He made colossal demands on his patients, his nurses and his fellow doctors \u2013 of whom there were very few in the early days \u2013 and on himself.</p> <p>John Silver, one of his doctors, said of him: \"He exerted a total, obsessive control over all aspects of care at the hospital, whether it was him coming round in the middle of the night to make sure that the nurses had turned patients, or checking on the quality of the cleaners' work or that of the food served on the wards. Everything was his responsibility. This was such an enormous contrast with consultants in other hospitals.\"</p> <p>Please note, consultants of today.</p> <p>Margaret Maughan, Britain's first Paralympian gold-medallist, complained about his \"Germanic\", authoritarian ways. And Eva Loeffler, his daughter, who worked for a time at Stoke Mandeville, complained that he used to criticise her work in the presence of other staff.</p> <p>But everybody loved \"Poppa\" Guttman, and did what they were told. Maybe you can only achieve what he did if you behave like that.</p> <p>Sport was not just to develop a patient's muscles but, according to Guttman, to \"counteract abnormal psychological and antisocial attitudes \u2013 a disabled person's attitude to himself deteriorating into an inferiority complex characterised by anxiety and loss of self-confidence and personal dignity, resulting in self-pity and self-isolation\". <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/aug/27/paralympic-foundations-maverick-doctor\" title=\"\">Sport could bring a person back into the community</a>.</p> <p>The early sports were wheelchair basketball and archery, and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/from-the-archive-blog/2012/aug/30/archive-history-of-the-paralympics?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">the first Stoke Mandeville games were held in 1948</a>. It was typical of Guttman, and showed his ambition, that he held these games on the first day of the London 1948 Olympic Games. That was chutzpah. They continued annually. In 1952, a team of Dutch ex-servicemen joined them, and in 1960 they were incorporated into the Rome Olympics, with 350 athletes from 24 countries. This year, the Paralympics are somewhat larger. After he retired in 1966, Guttman stayed involved with the Paralympic movement, which he had founded. He died in 1980.</p> <p>For somebody to invent a new branch of medicine, to defy the Nazis, to establish a centre of excellence with scarce resources in wartime in another country, and then go on to found a great international movement \u2026 now, that is somebody I would call a doctor.</p> <p><strong>This article is published by Guardian Professional. </strong><a href=\"http://reg.guardian.managemyaccount.co.uk/healthcare/start.php\" title=\"\"><strong>Join the Guardian healthcare network</strong></a><strong> to receive regular emails and exclusive offers.</strong></p>",

  "<p>The fire is out. The flame that lit up London for the best part of six golden weeks has flickered its last, extinguished in a closing ceremony that brought an end to the Paralympic Games and so to Britain's Olympic summer. Sunday night marked the end of a season of wonder that seemed to surprise the hosts as much as the guests, a period where we looked in the mirror and were met by an unexpected reflection \u2013 one we rather liked.</p> <p>The end came in an extravaganza of fire and light that deployed the now-familiar London 2012 combination of the surreal and the spectacular. The athletes paraded and a member of the royal family made a grand entrance \u2013 Prince Edward this time \u2013 but so too did a motorcade of steampunk vehicles that were part Terry Gilliam, part Heath Robinson, interspersed with dancers in gorgeous costumes and performers doing wild stunts, all backed by the reliable stadium-rock of Coldplay. The audience may not have divined a clear storyline, but it hardly mattered. They wanted to drink in the spirit of London 2012 while they still could, as if they were catching the last rays of a summer sun that had warmed them so well.</p> <p>And so concluded what was surely the most successful Paralympic Games since the first such competition \u2013 an archery contest among 16 disabled war veterans staged at Stoke Mandeville hospital on 28 July 1948, the opening day of the last London Olympics. This time, 64 years later, athletes competed in venues that were uniformly packed, stadiums as full as those at the Olympics a fortnight earlier thanks to a record-smashing advance sale of more than 2.4m tickets.</p> <p>The result was what the sociologists call an \"educable moment\" for the people of this country on a topic that for many has been barely visible and rarely discussed. The subject is disability, more complicated than anything thrown up by the Olympics, but revealed in a new light by the events of the past 10 days.</p> <p>The Paralympic purists would rather we didn't labour the point, preferring our focus to be on the Games as elite sport, no more and no less. The media manual from the British Paralympic Association instructed journalists: \"Anything specifically relating to, or focusing on, an elite athlete's impairment is generally considered unnecessary.\"</p> <p>Plenty of those who got hooked would agree, noting that after an initial adjustment, spectators and TV viewers did indeed start watching the Paralympics the way they watched any other sport, rooting for the home team, willing them to victory.</p> <p>Those who made the stadium roar on Thursday night for David Weir, Hannah Cockroft and Jonnie Peacock were cheering the way they had for Mo Farah, Jessica Ennis and Greg Rutherford on that super Saturday night in August: for supreme athletes of strength, power and grace. But there was more to it than that, a fact acknowledged night after night by Channel 4's much-admired The Last Leg, fronted by Adam Hills, an Australian comic with a prosthetic limb.</p> <p>In his closing show he recalled how the production team had regularly downed tools to marvel at, say, a one-legged athlete doing the long jump. The fact the competitor had only one leg was central to the wonder of the feat.</p> <p>The serially decorated equestrian Lee Pearson said as much when, ahead of these Games, he called on his fellow Paralympians and Games organisers to be less reticent about their impairments. \"Let's be interested in that,\" he said. \"If I watch disabled sport, you're intrigued about who is disabled, what's wrong with them and how it affects them in their sport and in their daily lives.\"</p> <p>If the choice is between emphasis on sport or on disability, perhaps the breathtaking sights on display over the last week and a half suggest an answer: both. For integral to all sport is the notion of physical endeavour within specific constraints, either of time or under the rules: what can a gymnast do on a wooden beam only 10cm thick, how many goals can a team score in 90 minutes? In Paralympic sports there are all the usual constraints and then an extra one: how fast can a man or woman run with this or that impairment? But the principle \u2013 maximum effort within fixed parameters \u2013 is the same.</p> <p>What many millions now know is that this produces not a lesser form of sport but, in many cases, sport of a more intense kind. If part of the appeal of watching rugby is witnessing the physical courage of players ready to throw their bodies in front of danger, then how much more thrilling is wheelchair rugby, a game that relies on the aggression and recklessness of athletes ready to slam deliberately into an opponent, even though that might mean one or both of them tipping out of a wheelchair? The stakes are higher.</p> <p>When Belgium took on Sweden on Wednesday, I gasped along with the rest of the spectators as a player was sprung from his chair and left sprawling on the ground. I assumed paramedics, or at least a couple of physios, would rush on to the indoor court to help him up. But there was no rush. Two officials conferred, debating not the player's wellbeing but whether his team had earned a penalty. The issue was sport, not disability. No wonder they call it murderball.</p> <p>Similarly defining of elite sport is the display of awesome skill. No one could watch Brazil versus Argentina in the five-a-side blind football without dropping their jaw at the players' close control of the ball, precise and delicate. Such control was outstanding in itself, but in those who could not see it was little short of incredible.</p> <p>And if team sports show off the human capacity for co-operation, then that's true of the Paralympics writ large. Plenty of people loved the sight of Katherine Grainger and Anna Watkins rowing in tandem to win Olympic gold.</p> <p>But it was deeply, unexpectedly moving to witness blind runners circling the track, each one linked to a guide, who matched them stride for stride; to see goalball teams, each player blind, emerging into the arena in single file, their hands touching the shoulder of the athlete in front; to see those Brazilian and Argentinian footballers, forced to resolve their deadlocked match by a penalty shootout, helped by a coach first tapping on each goalpost, the sound guiding them towards the target. This was humanity at its best, working together to achieve what would be impossible alone.</p> <p>The world records might not be the same as those of their non-disabled fellow athletes, the times they run not as fast. But if sport is often a blend of courage, skill and teamwork then the Paralympics are sport all right \u2013 only more so. The name Paralympics hardly does the event justice: they are not to the Olympics what a paralegal is to a lawyer. In some ways, they are a more extreme version: they are the ultra-Olympics. </p> <p>But they are also the antidote to that Leni Riefenstahl strain of Olympianism, the cult of the body perfect which reached its climax in the 1936 Berlin Games. How appropriate that those first Stoke Mandeville Games were invented by Dr Ludwig Guttmann, a German-Jewish refugee from Nazism and its pursuit of a world free of both Jews and disabled people. For the Paralympics are the cult of the body imperfect, an insistence that even a flawed body can be glorious.</p> <p>All of this has been an education for the host nation. Irene Oldham, 72 and using a wheelchair to get around the Olympic Park, told me she had grown used to people's embarrassment around disability. But the past 10 days had been different. \"It's been an eye-opener, even for children. They're saying 'I can't believe they're doing this. They can do better than we can'.\"</p> <p>Nearby was the Nicholl family, including 10-year-old Jake, who admitted he was \"a bit freaked out at first\" by the sight of athletes missing an arm or a leg, but who now found the sport even more exciting than the Olympics.</p> <p>The shift was noticeable in the Park. If, say, an amputee in team colours went by in a wheelchair, heads would turn. Not because they were gawping at someone with a disability, but in case they'd spotted a Paralympic celebrity. They didn't want to stare; they wanted an autograph. Disabled people have long reported being ignored, mocked or even abused in the streets, talked down to or just not seen \u2013 but for 10 days, when Cockroft or Weir raced in speed wheelchairs that gleamed like ancient chariots, 80,000 people hailed them as heroes. As Sebastian Coe said in a short, pitch-perfect speech last night: \"We will never think of disability the same way.\"</p> <p>And this has not all been reverence of the familiar, triumph-over-tragedy variety (though there has been some of that). Instead these disabled athletes have been revealed in the same multiple shades as any other group of hyper-competitive super-achievers. Whether it was cyclist Jody Cundy <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/aug/31/jody-cundy-disqualified-anger-paralympic-cycling\" title=\"\">turning the air blue with rage</a> after he was disqualified or Oscar Pistorius being a sore loser in the 200m T44 race, it confirmed that Paralympian is not a synonym for saint \u2013 that a disabled person is also capable, as the Last Leg put it, of \"being a nob.\"</p> <p>If patriotism is self-congratulation on a collective scale, then Britain has good reason to feel patriotic. For we embraced these Paralympic Games as no other nation has. The venues were packed, that 2.4m figure five times as large as the 480,000 advance tickets sold in Beijing in 2008. The difference in treatment has been visible in media coverage too. In Britain it's been wall-to-wall on Channel 4 and with big, poster-style front pages on many of the newspapers. In the US the rights-holding network NBC has not covered the Paralympics at all, save for an hour or two on a niche cable station and a planned 90-minute \"special\" to be aired next weekend.</p> <p>Campaigners will say we should not pat ourselves on the back too warmly. Discrimination against the disabled is real and has not gone away deepened by benefits cuts; access in parts of London is still awful; there is even a risk that people might judge those disabled people not capable of swimming like Ellie Simmonds or cycling like Sarah Storey even more harshly, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/aug/30/paralympic-spirit-insults-disabled-like-me\" title=\"\">castigating them for not pushing themselves harder</a>.</p> <p>All that is true. And yet if staging a global event such as the Olympics and Paralympics is a test for a nation, then it is one Britain can justly consider itself to have passed and passed with distinction. These Games were efficient and well-run, lifted by 70,000 dedicated, welcoming volunteers. They showed a nation ready to cherish all its citizens, black and white, male and female, born here or born elsewhere and \u2013 we now know \u2013 disabled and not. For so long, it has been said that Britain is a conservative country. Well, the last six weeks, which began with an opening ceremony celebrating Britain as a place of social revolution, say otherwise.</p> <p>Of course we're not perfect. But if the Paralympic Games have taught us anything, it is that perfect is not everything. Leonard Cohen did not perform in the ceremony, though as it happens he was in concert in London at the very same time. One of his songs would have fitted neatly as an anthem for the Paralympic ideal, for it is a hymn to imperfection. \"Forget your perfect offering,\" he sings. \"There is a crack in everything. That's how the light gets in.\"</p>"
