  "<p>Andr\u00e9 Villas-Boas faces a selection dilemma over Sandro that has compounded his problems in midfield as he prepares for his first match in charge of Tottenham Hotspur at Newcastle United on Saturday.</p> <p>Sandro has been away from Tottenham all summer due to his participation at the Olympic Games with Brazil, which ended only last Saturday when they lost the final to Mexico. But Villas-Boas has still not been able to work with him because the player has travelled with the full Brazil squad to Sweden for Wednesday's friendly at the Rasunda Stadium.</p> <p>Villas-Boas has scheduled a later training time for Thursday's session at Spurs Lodge in the hope that his various international players will be able to join in, having returned to London. But even if Sandro were to train and do so again on Friday, before the squad fly to Newcastle, it would represent a gamble for the manager to pick him.</p> <p>Sandro's match fitness is not in question and he is known for his stamina but Villas-Boas's 4-3-3 system is different from that of his predecessor, Harry Redknapp, who played 4-4-2, and Sandro would have very little time to practise in it. Villas-Boas met Sandro at the Brazil Olympic squad's hotel in Hertfordshire to discuss the new season and it is clear that the 23-year-old is integral to his thinking. But it is a source of frustration to Villas-Boas that he has not yet seen him on the training field.</p> <p>Villas-Boas must also contend with the loss of Scott Parker to achilles surgery and the on-going issue with Luka Modric, who wants a move to Real Madrid. Modric, who has travelled to Croatia for his national team's friendly against Switzerland on Wednesday , has not yet trained with the Tottenham first-team squad this summer as his head and heart are elsewhere.</p> <p>Villas-Boas is not likely to pick him at Newcastle, which would appear to leave Jake Livermore and Jermaine Jenas, the club's forgotten man, in line to start at Newcastle, in the deeper midfield positions behind the new signing Gylfi Sigurdsson. Villas-Boas has preferred Livermore and Jenas in pre-season to Tom Huddlestone, much to the latter's annoyance.</p> <p>Chelsea have similar frustrations with Brazil over Oscar, the midfielder they signed from Internacional during the Olympics. Like Sandro he played throughout the London Games and he, too, has gone to Sweden for Wednesday's fixture. Roberto Di Matteo, the Chelsea manager, admitted that the situation was a hindrance and he will consider easing Oscar in gradually when he reports to Cobham later in the week. The Manchester United full-back Rafael da Silva has also been selected for the Sweden friendly, after competing at the Olympics.</p> <p>Chelsea's Brazil centre-half David Luiz has travelled to Sweden despite limping away from Sunday's Community Shield defeat by Manchester City after suffering a knock, and Ramires has been called back into the squad, though he has not played for Brazil since the 2011 Copa America. Neither Luiz nor Ramires featured at the Olympics. The Real Madrid defender Marcelo, who played at the Games, has been excused from the Sweden match.</p> <p>The game will be the last to be staged at the Rasunda before it is demolished to make way for a new arena and it marks a re-run of the 1958 World Cup final that was staged there; Brazil beat Sweden 5-2. The Swedish FA has invited Pele and other members of that Brazil team to attend as the guests of honour.</p>",
  "<p>Predicting which Olympic boxers will go on to be successful in professional boxing is a dicey affair. There are some amateurs whose abilities translate better to the pro ranks. For instance, some have big punching power but it is harder to knock out an amateur wearing headgear, and a knockout is a pretty definitive way to win a fight as a pro.</p> <p>Being a successful pro does not have one magic formula \u2013 some fighters become successful pros because they are exciting, some because they are excellent, some because they are both.</p> <p>Winning Olympic gold does not guarantee success on the next level \u2013 in fact, the amateur scoring system largely rewards making any kind of contact over making meaningful contact, whereas in the pros, \"clean, effective punching\" is crucial to the standard used by judges.</p> <p>Little consideration is given in the list below to who actually can or will turn professional. The Cubans, for instance, have to defect to become pros and some medal-winning Ukrainians are already joining a semi-pro outfit being hosted by the International Amateur Boxing Association (AIBA), so we cannot anticipate when they might be facing the professional boxers we know, if ever.</p> <h2>Super Heavyweight \u2013 Anthony Joshua</h2> <p>Anthony Joshua is fast. The Briton bloodied his Olympic opponents and knocked them down, so he's got serious power. He has a punishing jab, he's fearless and he's a big boy at 6ft 6in. You get the impression he could get much, much better.</p> <p><strong>Honourable mention:</strong> Erislandy Savon Cotilla (Cuba)</p> <h2>Heavyweight \u2013 Oleksandr Usyk</h2> <p>If anyone, it's Oleksandr Usyk, because the Ukrainian had moments of pro-style heavy hitting, but this was the worst weight class for prospective prizefighters in London and Usyk is about the beginning and end of heavies even deserving an honorable mention.</p> <h2>Light Heavyweight \u2013 Egor Mekhontcev</h2> <p>In another weak class Russia's Egor Mekhontcev may just have been the most destructive light heavyweight when he was at his best.</p> <p><strong>Honourable mentions:</strong> Oleksandr Gvozdyk (Ukraine), Julio la Cruz Peraza (Cuba)</p> <h2>Middleweight \u2013 Terrell Gaush</h2> <p>Terrell Gausha scored a rare Olympic stoppage in the round of 32 and it announced his arrival as the best pro prospect on Team USA. Not only is he fundamentally sound but he can really hit. He should have made it to the quarter-finals save for some poor judging but his brand of accurate, hard punching could definitely win over pro judges if his opponents make it to the final bell.</p> <p><strong>Honourable mentions:</strong> Ryota Murata (Japan), Esquiva Falcao Florentino (Brazil), Adem Kilicci (Turkey)</p> <h2>Welterweight \u2013 Errol Spence Jr</h2> <p>Another relatively weak class, and another member of Team USA \u2013 Errol Spence Jr. Spence made it farther than any other US boxer, to the quarter-finals, and he did it with a kind of mini-Gausha style.</p> <p><strong>Honourable mentions:</strong> Serik Sapiyev (Kazakhstan), Alexis Vastine (France)</p> <h2>Light Welterweight \u2013 Roniel Iglesias Sotolongo</h2> <p>It is a tough choice between Roniel Iglesias Sotolongo and the man he defeated in the Olympic final, Ukraine's Denys Berinchyk, but Iglesias showed off versatility throughout the tournament, especially when he engaged the slugging Berinchyk at his own game and beat him at it. Cuban fighters who turn pro tend to keep some of their \"score when you need to/don't take risks/just win\" training and it makes them less than thrilling, but Iglesias was willing to duke it out and was adept at it when he did.</p> <p><strong>Honourable mentions:</strong> Denys Berinchyk, Munkh-Erdene Uranchimeg (Mongolia)</p> <h2>Lightweight \u2013 Vasyl Lomachenko</h2> <p>It's hard not to go with the amateur god Vasyl Lomachenko. He's a phenomenon. It's unclear how much power he'd have as a lightweight, so he might be a better pro in a lower division. Lithuania's Evaldas Petrauskas was more exciting than the Ukrainian, though.</p> <p><strong>Honourable mentions:</strong> Evaldas Petrauskas, Jose Ram\u00edrez (USA), F\u00e9lix Verdejo (Puerto Rico), Yasniel Toledo Lopez (Cuba)</p> <h2>Bantamweight \u2013 Oscar Valdez Fierro</h2> <p>Oscar Valdez Fierro of Mexico displayed the aggressive, body-attacking, boxer-puncher pro stylings of his compatriots that have made boxers from that nation so popular not just with the big Hispanic fan base but hardcore fans everywhere.</p> <p><strong>Honourable mentions:</strong> John Joe Nevin (Ireland), L\u00e1zaro Alvarez (Cuba), Joseph Diaz Jr (USA).</p> <h2>Flyweight \u2013 Robeisy Ramirez Carrazana</h2> <p>Robeisy Ramirez Carrazana makes every punch count. When he launches an attack, it's a hurting kind. He's also just all-around skilled \u2013 very hard to hit on defence and capable of doing it all in the ring. He's young enough that maybe some of the appropriate-for-amateur/inappropriate-for-pro Cuban traits have not set in yet.</p> <p><strong>Honourable mentions:</strong> Tugstsogt Nyambayar (Mongolia), Nordine Oubaali (France)</p> <h2>Light Flyweight \u2013 Kaeo Pongprayoon</h2> <p>Little to choose from here but Thailand's Kaeo Pongprayoon slightly mimics the \"little guy darting in-and-out/landing big, hard combos\" style of Manny Pacquiao. It's not clear if the 32-year-old wants to go pro or would have enough time to make much of it.</p> <p><strong>Honourable mention:</strong> Devendro Singh Laishram (India)</p>",
  "<p>The armed forces will take two years to recover from their involvement in the Olympic Games because so many personnel have been deployed at short notice and taken away from normal duties, the military's chief planner for the Games has said.</p> <p>In an interview with the Guardian, Wing Commander Peter Daulby also warned that critics who wanted a smaller military put the country at risk of not being able to cope with these kind of civil emergencies, or a \"national strategic shock\".</p> <p>Daulby, who was put in charge of the military's Olympic planning 18 months ago, said the need to send thousands of extra troops to the Games at the last minute after the G4S debacle showed \"the country needs a military for more than war fighting\".</p> <p>Describing the Olympics as the largest peacetime operation ever performed by the armed forces, he said: \"It just shows you the dangers of pulling the military down. I am sure that there are some people who think that if we are a smaller military power we will be less likely to get involved in international operations.</p> <p>\"If we shrink the military, do we really understand what we are losing? Look at the speed with which we pushed up the throttle. It proves the military offers the country a huge amount of resilience.\"</p> <p>Daulby, 45, was one of several senior officers who spoke to the Guardian about the military's contribution to the Olympics, which increased more than threefold from May last year.</p> <p>Then, only 5,000 personnel were expected to be deployed, but that increased to 18,000 when the Olympic organisers Locog admitted they had significantly underestimated the number of security guards needed at the venues \u2013 and G4S conceded it had over-estimated its ability to recruit and train the extra staff.</p> <p>\"We were originally planning to provide niche capabilities,\" said Daulby. \"When the requirement for venue security was doubled, that was a bit of a game changer. We had to generate 18,000 people. That does not mean that there are 18,000 spare people. It means that the government has prioritised [the Olympics].</p> <p>\"It will take two years to recover from this, to get back to normal, to get everything back into kilter. You can't expect them to go back to normal routine very easily.\"</p> <p>He said the UK's commitment to Afghanistan had not been affected by the Olympics, but the military had exceeded by 6,000 the maximum number of people he thought the Ministry of Defence could supply.</p> <p>\"Anything above 18,000 and you start to shut down elements of defence,\" he said.</p> <p>\"We put a bucket of men up and that was taken. We put another bucket of men up and that was taken. We have proved we can do it \u2026 most people think they have done something really special here. I think there is a great sense that the UK has nailed this.\"</p> <p>The rush to train and get everyone ready meant \"we were building the plane at the same time as flying the plane\", he said.</p> <p>\"We did not think that it would be healthy for the Olympic Games to be too militarised. Our fears were not well founded. It has been an enhancing experience.\"</p> <p>Brigadier Richard Smith said the scale and difficulty of the military's role in London 2012 was comparable to operations in Iraq and Afghanistan.</p> <p>\"In terms of threat it is not comparable, but in terms of scale it is more than comparable. The complexity of the basing and the training to get them to task \u2026 it's been a massive operation in a short space of time.</p> <p>\"In Iraq and in Helmand, we could build up over time and establish ourselves. For this we had a short space of time and we had to get it right first time.\"</p> <p>Smith said the armed forces had realised the need to reconnect with the British people after years of operations abroad, and admitted there was anxiety how the public would react to so many people in uniform at a sporting event.</p> <p>With the UK withdrawing from Afghanistan, and British bases in Germany being closed, too, the public will need to get used to seeing more of the military, he said. \"It is a really important point. We recognised we have an opportunity to set conditions for us when we are predominantly UK-based armed forces. We want to easily connect with the people from whom we are drawn. This has given us the opportunity to show us as professional and approachable human beings.\"</p> <p>Smith said the military had tried to be flexible when presented with concerns, including those from some competitors. \"In the equestrian community, they were worried that the helicopters from HMS Ocean would scare the competitors in the dressage at Greenwich Park. We adjusted the flight paths so they did not. We didn't want to blunder in as a blunt tool.\"</p> <p>Asked if the military could mount a similar operation in five years' time \u2013 when defence cuts will have stripped 20,000 posts from the army \u2013 he said: \"I am not going to answer that. Give us a challenge and we will rise to it.\"</p> <p>Among the most difficult tasks in the days before the Games was finding enough portable toilets and showers to equip Tobacco Dock, east London, where 2,500 personnel were stationed for the Games. The military works on the basis of one toilet for 10 people, and one shower for every 20.</p> <p>\"It has been a mammoth task,\" said Major Austin Lillywhite. \"We had to go to Ireland for the portable toilets. We couldn't find them anywhere else at such short notice.\"</p> <p>The MoD hired 192 coaches to ferry troops to and from the Olympic venues, and spent \u00a3300,000 on equipment such as TVs for entertainment at the temporary bases.</p> <p>It also signed a laundry contract so that military uniform for everyone on duty had been cleaned and ironed.</p> <p>\"We want the men and women to look a good standard. If they all turned their irons on at the same time in the morning, the power would go down.\"</p> <p>None of these contracts are coming out of the military budget. The Treasury and G4S will be paying for the military's extra contributions.</p> <p>G4S announced on Sunday that it was giving \u00a32.5m to the armed forces as a goodwill gesture. The donation will go towards welfare amenities, including sports equipment, and to sports associations which have backed serving athletes, including rowing gold medallists Heather Stanning and Pete Reed.</p> <h2>Provisions supplied to feed the Olympics troops</h2> <p>Eggs: 205,800</p> <p>Vanilla ice cream: 21,056 litres</p> <p>Potatoes: 38,999 kilograms</p> <p>Sausages: 7,756 kilograms</p> <p>Apples: 33,376</p> <p>Beef: 7,252 kilograms</p> <p>Chicken: 5,240 kilograms</p>",
  "<p>For Jackie Jamieson, the most emotional week of her life came four months before this year's Olympics. In March, her son Michael was going through swimming trials, hoping to represent Great Britain in the breaststroke. He'd been unsuccessful at 100m, and with the 200m trial coming up, his mother decided to write him an email. There was a memory she had carried privately for 14 years. When Michael was 10, she had walked past his bedroom, \"and he was sitting on the end of the bed, and looked in a wee daze,\" she says. \"I said to him: 'Son, are you OK?' And he said: 'Oh Mum, I've just had a dream, and it was so, so real. I had a dream I was going to do something special as a swimmer.'\"</p> <p>Jamieson takes a deep breath as she tells this story, suppressing a sob. \"He'd missed out in the 100, and he was devastated, and he wasn't right in himself. And so the night before his 200, I sat, and I sent him an email, and I referred back to that story. I said, you may have forgotten, but I've carried this in my heart for a long, long time.\" The next day he made the team.</p> <p>In late July, that triumph brought Michael to the Olympic aquatics centre, where he smashed the British 200m breaststroke record twice in the qualifying rounds, then a third time in the final. In that last race he picked up the silver medal, the best of <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/olympics/19226042\" title=\"\">the three medals</a> won by the British swimming team, and the crowd roared their relief. This was the second most emotional week of his mother's life, and she was in the stadium, but couldn't watch. \"I remember closing my eyes, as he was coming in to touch the wall. And then, when I opened them, and saw his name, it's like somebody puts a switch on and you start to shake. I remember turning to my husband, and holding on to him, and I felt my weight going on to him, and just crying and thinking: 'Oh my goodness me, he's done it.'\" When Michael walked by, she blew him a kiss, \"and then I just held my hands together. I thought: what a moment. I'll never forget this, as long as I live.\"</p> <p>The athletes' parents have been more prominent than ever in the London Olympics, reflecting the audience's emotions with a pin-sharp, heightened intensity born of years spent supporting their children, ferrying them to practices, washing their towels, sacrificing holidays, giving them space to develop, advising when needed, and watching as their hopes occasionally shatter and change. The weight of all this was clear in the <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-19175323\" title=\"\">footage of Carol Hoy</a>, in the velodrome for the men's keirin, peeking at her son Chris, clapping her hands, turning away, peeking again, covering her eyes, until the moment the crowd erupted, signalling her son's sixth Olympic gold medal and his status as the most successful British Olympian ever. At this, her face broke slowly with relief. Then she started to cry.</p> <p>Another parent whose expression ricocheted from ecstasy to tears was Bert Le Clos, who <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1tduGQPJJw\" title=\"\"> recorded a memorable interview with Clare Balding</a> immediately after his son Chad won gold in the 200m butterfly, beating Michael Phelps. He was beaming, irrepressible, exclaiming over \"his beautiful boy\". Speaking to Le Clos now, over the phone at his home in South Africa, he still seems ecstatic. \"I haven't got my voice back yet,\" he says, \"from the talking, screaming, crying. This morning I was crying again. We knew five or six months ago, when Chad was training, that he had a huge chance to beat Michael. But it's easier said than done. Then, closer to the time, he was getting stronger and stronger and stronger, and I knew he'd win \u2013 until I got to that London arena and saw the magnitude of the Olympics, and the millions and millions of people. By the time the 200 fly came, the final, I was saying about 2,000 prayers a minute, that he would just get a little bronze.\"</p> <p>The moment his son beat Phelps, Le Clos says he nearly \"ate the woman next to me, a Canadian woman. I grabbed her and picked her up. She got the shock of her life.\" He says he can't stop crying. \"Oh my God, every time he talks, my lovely boy, I want to cry \u2026 [Chad] made a speech last night, where he said: 'My Dad used to cry when I made the relay B team.' They're my kids. For me, it's normal to cry. But I made the whole of South Africa cry.\"</p> <p>The emotion of the Olympics can be overwhelming even for audiences who first encounter a winning athlete when they're at their strongest, most invincible. For their parents, who remember them at their most vulnerable, the emotion reaches another pitch. For Adrian Trott, for instance, the experience of seeing his daughter Laura <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2012/aug/07/laura-trott-olympic-omnium?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">win two gold medals for cycling</a>, in the women's team pursuit and the omnium, began with her premature birth 20 years ago. The day after she was born he and his wife Glenda were told she had a collapsed lung, and he says the 25-minute drive from home to the hospital that day was \"the longest ever\". Laura needed surgery, and seeing her in an incubator was highly traumatic, he says. \"The procedure for repairing a collapsed lung on an hours-old baby is the same as for you and I. You poke a tube in under the arm, into the chest cavity and start sucking out the air so that the lung can expand, and then obviously you've got to give it time to heal, because it's punctured. That whole process, and getting her back to her birth weight, took about six weeks \u2013 but it felt like a bloody lifetime.\"</p> <p>For the first two and a half years of her life, Laura had to be taken to the hospital for checkups. She was diagnosed with asthma, and the paediatrician said \"it was controllable, you could deal with it,\" he says, \"but one thing that would help was some form of physical activity, to strengthen and regulate her breathing\".</p> <p>That's part of the reason Adrian and his two daughters, Laura and Emma, took up cycling. Another was that Glenda needed to lose weight, and together the family became keen cyclists \u2013 so much so that Glenda, who was signed up to a hospital diet-and-exercise scheme, lost half her body weight in the space of 18 months. Laura also went to trampoline classes, and there were more worries about her health when she began passing out in mid-jump. One day, after a swimming lesson, says Adrian, \"we were in the lounge, and she went to give me a hug, as kids do, and just blacked out. The first thing she asked me when she came around was: 'Am I dead?'\" Tests suggested she was simply dehydrated, but the experience shook her father.</p> <p>Does it bother him to see the limits she pushes her body to these days? After all, on finishing her races Laura often vomits. He says no. He knows a few other people who push themselves that hard \u2013 Laura's sister Emma, also a professional cyclist, does it, as has he a couple of times. Laura gets her competitive streak from him, says Adrian. As a child he was so competitive: \"I'd race raindrops down a wet window, you know? I still get really annoyed if someone 10 or 15 years younger beats me in a bike race.\" In fact, most of the parents I speak to are, or have been, seriously sporty. Jamieson was a keen swimmer when she was growing up, and \"could have been pretty formidable\", she suspects, but \"certainly didn't have the parental support that Michael's had. I eventually just gave up.\" Bert Le Clos used to play for the junior team of professional football club Durban City, but says he's a terrible swimmer. \"I swim like a world-champion stone. I go straight to the bottom.\"</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-394789316\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2012/8/13/1344882385720/Kate-Walsh-in-action-agai-008.jpg\" alt=\"Kate Walsh in action against Japan during the Olympics.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kate Walsh in action against Japan during the Olympics. Photograph: Getty Images</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The parents of Olympic athletes often have to cope with seeing their child in pain \u2013 and sometimes horribly injured. Barbara Walsh, mother of the British women's hockey captain, Kate Walsh, was there on the first Sunday of the Olympics, when the British team was playing Japan. Her daughter was hit in the face with a stick, and suffered a fractured jaw. \"We were actually feeling quite relieved at the time because they were four nil up,\" says Barbara, \"and I think there were four minutes left of the game. Then Kate went down. She never stays down, and I knew the minute she lay flat on the floor and kicked her feet there was something the matter ... When we got to her in the trauma unit, fortunately there were no mirrors around, so she couldn't see her jaw sticking out to one side. It was quite funny actually because her first question was: 'Did I win the ball?'\" She had.</p> <p>Kate went under general anaesthetic to have a titanium plate stitched into her jaw, and Barbara expected this to be the end of her Olympics. \"On the Monday, when she was coming around, she was just being sick, and I thought, there is no way she is going to be back playing. And when she left the hospital on the Wednesday, she still looked quite frail.\" She was prescribed a liquid diet for six weeks, and had to sleep at a 45-degree angle.</p> <p>But Kate comes from strong stock. Her mother works in sports development at Liverpool John Moores University and her sister Rachel plays hockey professionally in Holland. So less than a week after Kate's injury, Barbara received a text that simply said \"starting\".<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2012/jul/30/london-2012-kate-walsh-hockey\" title=\"\"> Her daughter went on to play the whole match</a>. And she saw the team right through to the triumph against New Zealand that won them the bronze medal. In that match, there was a party atmosphere after they scored the first goal, says Barbara, \"but I wasn't 'party atmosphering', I have to say, until the final whistle went.\"</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-394789317\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2012/8/13/1344881423411/Beth-Tweddle-Olympic-bron-008.jpg\" alt=\"Beth Tweddle Olympic bronze medallist.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Beth Tweddle, the Olympic bronze medallist in gymnastics. Photograph: Colin McPherson</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Colin McPherson</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I ask Barbara about sacrifices, and she say's it's mainly been Kate who has had to make them, missing her grandfather's funeral with great regret, for example, to attend a tournament in America. \"I said I thought he would have wanted her to go,\" says Barbara, \"and actually the day of his funeral was the very one it was announced the Olympics would be in London, which seemed like a link.\" Many of the other parents echo this outlook, saying it's their children who have had to make sacrifices \u2013 parties, friends, relationships \u2013 rather than them.</p> <p>But there are financial implications for some. Le Clos says their Olympic dream has taken a lot of effort and money, and while they used to live in a house with a sauna and jacuzzi, the family now lives in a small three-bedroom townhouse. \"But I'm the happiest I've ever been ... You neglect your business when you go away [to races]. It's five or six days, you leave your business behind, and that takes its toll in the end. So the sacrifices are huge, and if you don't make them, you won't make it. It's a hell of a thing.\"</p> <p>Like Kate Walsh, the gymnast Beth Tweddle <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2012/aug/06/olympics-gymnastics-beth-tweddle-live?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">also won a bronze</a>, for her performance on the uneven bars \u2013 it was Britain's first ever medal for an individual women's gymnastic event. She was battling a significant knee injury too, and had spent weeks sleeping with an ice machine strapped around it. Not that her father Jerry seemed nervous. When asked what he had been going through during his daughter's Olympic test, he told journalists he'd been \"laying a patio\". Her mother Ann confirms this, and explains her husband is \"very much a doer, so his way of coping with nerves was just to keep himself busy all week\". They were staying at their son James's house, \"so he actually laid a turf for the lawn, and put down a little patio, and painted a bathroom\".</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-394789318\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2012/8/13/1344881485427/Keri-anne-Payne-open-wate-008.jpg\" alt=\"Keri-anne Payne, open water swimmer.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Keri-Anne Payne, the open water swimmer.

But I was terribly nervous ... We have no communication on the day at all, we just send her a good luck text, and she watches out for us in the stadium. She knows where we are, but she doesn't acknowledge us until afterwards, and she did this time, when she knew she'd won the medal. I was just standing there with tears in my eyes, and she looked up and for once she had tears in her eyes too.\"</p> <p>It was a very different experience to Beijing, where Beth came fourth. \"Fourth is horrible,\" says Ann. \"I remained very calm at the time, I just wanted to talk to her ... then I went back to the hotel and totally broke down.\"</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-394789319\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2012/8/13/1344875581474/Usain-Bolts-father-Welles-008.jpg\" alt=\"Usain Bolt's father, Wellesley at his grocery store in Jamaica.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Usain Bolt's father, Wellesley at his grocery store in Jamaica.

I would love to have run down there and just grabbed hold of her at the end, and given her a hug, but the powers that be wouldn't let me.\" Keri-Anne says the support of her family at times like this is \"incredibly important. To have their support after a disappointing race \u2013 a disappointing result, not a disappointing race \u2013 it means the world that they're still here, and they'll still love me. I guess that's the worrying thing when you don't have a good swim. You think everything's going to change. But nothing changes. You're still the person you were.

Jackie Jamieson still pictures Michael standing on a starting block as a child, her \"wiry little wee boy\". To Wellesley Bolt, father of Usain, the fact that his world-beating son has remained the same person as ever is a source of great pride. \"He's worked hard to be where he is,\" says Wellesley, \"and it's hard to be on top. It's easy to come down and you have to work harder to stay there.\" Having watched his son's Beijing triumphs on TV, he was in the stadium this time, and says he was \"a bit tense\", at first. \"But once he was out of the blocks I was more relaxed. There was a lot of pressure to deliver, because he lost in Jamaica in the trials, you know? And once he did, it was a great moment. I almost broke down in tears. Almost,\" he repeats, \"but I hung in there!\"</p>",
  "<p>Former prime minister Gordon Brown has invoked Britain's Olympic medal success \u2013 based, he said, on \"pooling and sharing\" of national resources and expertise \u2013 as an argument against Scottish independence.</p> <p>Speaking out at the Edinburgh international book festival, Brown said that the Union had made possible a raft of shared British institutions, including the National Health Service, the BBC and the armed forces \u2013 and had created a Britain that was much more fair and equal than it would otherwise be.</p> <p>\"One thing I take from the Olympics, a point that Sir Chris Hoy has already made for me \u2013 when we pool and share resources for the common good the benefit is far greater than would have occurred if we'd just added up the sum of the parts. So the National Health Service is common insurance policy \u2026 the BBC, shared across the United Kingdom. The armed forces, so you don't have a Scottish, a Welsh and an English army.</p> <p>\"The Olympics it is pretty clear \u2013 we managed to do it in cycling with pooled resources \u2013 if you had just divided the money and put a tenth to Scotland and a tenth to Yorkshire, you could not have achieved the same results we did.\"</p> <p>The average person in Scotland was just 4% worse off than the average person in England, he said. That contrasted with the difference between, say, Luxembourg, where the average person is six times better off than the average person in Bulgaria; or the United States, where the average person was over three times better off than the average person in Mexico. He also cited differences between Israel and Gaza, and between different parts of the US.</p> <p>The danger of breaking up what he called \"fiscal union\", was he said, that in Scotland \"you will either have to cut public expenditure enormously, beyond what is already being done, or you are going to have tax Scottish people more. Fiscal autonomy means more taxes in Scotland.\"</p> <p>If the union were broken up, he said, \"there would be regionally varied minimum wages, and a race to the bottom, with one unit trying to undercut the other. Break up and you will have different social security rates but you will end with pensioners being treated completely differently in different parts of Britain, or unemployed or disabled people. And people will think that's not progress, that's moving backwards.\"</p> <p>Indeed, he argued, success of pooling of resources between England and Scotland will forge an example for other countries seeking to grow closer in the future. \"If you look at the future, states existing side by side are going to have to find a way narrowing the differences between them. We have a model \u2026 that people will look at when they look at economic union in Africa and in Asia.\"</p> <p>An adviser to Alex Salmond, the first minister, said he thought Brown's references to the economies of the West Bank, Mexico and Delaware in the US were \"completely off the wall and bizarre.</p> <p>\"I just think that statistics about the West Bank and Israel, and statistics about Spain and Morocco, I just don't see what he's going on about,\" he said. \"I think his case is totally weird. I don't see why any of this has anything to do with the future of Scotland. Is he saying Morocco should join with Spain? Is he saying Delaware and Mississippi should be one state?\"</p> <p>Salmond, leader of the Scottish National party, plans to use the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/aug/13/london-olympics-boost-glasgow-commonwealth\" title=\"\">Commonwealth Games, hosted by Glasgow 2014</a> and other major events \u2013 such as the Ryder Cup golf tournament at Gleneagles and a Scottish clans homecoming festival \u2013 as springboards to promote Scotland's cultural and political vitality, to build up support for independence.</p> <p>A spokesperson for finance secretary John Swinney said: \"Scotland is better off than the UK as a whole, and therefore Gordon Brown is wrong on tax and spending, and wrong about fiscal autonomy and independence.</p> <p>\"In 2010-11, Scotland contributed 9.6% of UK taxes, but we received only 9.3% of UK spending. The bottom line is that Scotland will be better off with independence and control of our own resources.\"</p> <p>Peter Wishart, MP for Perth and North Perthshire, said: \"We all know what the independence referendum will be fought over. We all know what the issues are: the economy, do we want things like Trident, having weapons of mass destruction... I don't think I have every had anyone say, in all the door-knocking I've done this summer, that 'the thing which is important to me when I vote on independence is the Olympic games in London'.\"</p>",
  "<p>BP has sold its Californian oil refinery to US firm Tesoro as part of a $38bn selling&#xa0;spree following the Gulf of Mexico disaster.</p> <p>The British oil group sold the Carson refinery, south of Los Angeles, along with its 800 dealer-operated petrol stations across southern California, Arizona and Nevada for $2.5bn (\u00a31.6bn) in cash.</p> <p>The sale brings the divestments made by BP 2010 to $26.5bn. It said it was on track to achieve $38bn of asset sales by the end of next year.</p> <p>BP has been selling off non-core assets since the Deepwater Horizon disaster in the Gulf of Mexico.

BP maintains that it has \"turned the corner\", but its second-quarter figures disappointed the City with a 35% drop in underlying profits to $3.7bn.</p> <p>BP has become a takeover target in the wake of the costly disaster, which has damaged its reputation and finances. The disposals have made it a \"much smaller meal\" to digest, according to Louise Cooper, analyst at City broker BGC Partners \u2013 it is \"no longer a 10-course feast\".</p> <p>The business remains under the cloud of the 2010 spill, as it is yet to reach a settlement with the US department of justice. In addition, BP is locked in a dispute with its partners in the Russian TNK-BP venture, which makes up a 10th of group profits.</p> <p>As part of the refinery deal, BP is also selling storage and distribution assets, including more than 100 miles of pipeline and several marine, land storage and product marketing terminals.</p> <p>New owner Tesoro will keep on the majority of the 1,700 staff at the refinery, petrol stations and other assets, although there could be some redundancies, said BP, which put Carson and Texas City refineries \u2013 two of its five in the US \u2013 up for sale in February 2011.</p> <p>Carson produces 266,000 barrels a day. Texas City, which remains unsold turns 470,000 barrels into petrol and jet fuel but does not have the distribution network and other assets that Carson has.</p> <p>Iain Conn, chief executive of BP's global refining and marketing business, described the deal as a \"significant step in the strategic refocusing of [BP's] US fuels business\". He added: \"Together with the intended sale of Texas City, this will allow us to focus BP's operations and investments exclusively on our three northern US refineries and their large and important marketing businesses.\"</p> <p>The company is close to completing a multibillion dollar upgrade at its Whiting refinery in north-west Indiana, and is also upgrading at Cherry Point in north-west Washington to produce cleaner burning diesel fuel, as well as investing in a cleaner fuel project at its joint-venture near Toledo in Ohio.</p> <p>The Carson deal is expected to close by the middle of next year.</p>",
  "<p>The body of 12-year-old Tia Sharp was found wrapped in a black bedsheet in a black bag in the loft of her grandmother's house, it has emerged.</p> <p>Separately, Stuart Hazell, the 37-year-old man accused of her murder, was remanded in custody as he was sent for trial at London's Old Bailey after appearing before Camberwell Green magistrates via videolink.</p> <p>Wearing a blue T-shirt, he was seated at a table in Sutton police station during the five-minute hearing.

He gave no plea. When asked by the clerk of the court if he understood the charge, he replied: \"Yes. I do\".</p> <p>He will appear before the Old Bailey by videolink on Wednesday and a plea and case management hearing is set for 19 November.</p> <p>Details of the case were not opened in court as the chairman of the bench, Charu Joglekar, said it was an indictable offence and magistrates did not have jurisdiction. No family members attended the brief hearing.</p> <p>Tia's body was discovered on Friday afternoon in the terraced council house where her grandmother lived with Hazell. Hazell was arrested several hours later in a field in nearby Merton.</p> <p>The schoolgirl, who regularly visited her grandmother, was reported missing on Friday 3 August. Police had visited the premises frequently since then.</p> <p>A specialist team searched the house in the early hours of Sunday 5 August and apparently examined the loft where Tia's body was discovered five days later by another team.</p> <p>The Metropolitan police has apologised to Tia's mother, Natalie Sharp, 30, saying that human error was to blame for their failure to find her body sooner. That failure is now the subject of an internal Metropolitan police inquiry.</p> <p>The cause of Tia's death has not yet been established but it is understood that police are examining a theory that she may have been smothered. A postmortem examination was halted on Saturday night and is expected to recommence this week. Although officers await formal identification of a body found at The Lindens on Friday, the alleged victim is named in the murder charge as Tia Sharp.</p> <p>More than 100 officers were drafted in to search for the missing schoolgirl. Friends, neighbours and members of the local community carried out their own searches and handed out thousands of leaflets bearing Tia's photograph.</p> <p>Christine Sharp, Tia's grandmother, was arrested on suspicion of murder on Saturday but bailed on Sunday until October.</p> <p>Her neighbour Paul Meehan, 39, was bailed on suspicion of assisting an offender.</p> <p>Tia's mother, Natalie Sharp, and her partner, David Niles, 29, who live 10 miles away in Mitcham, Surrey, visited a shrine of hundreds of flowers and cards on the pavement near The Lindens on Sunday. The couple left a white orchid, a teddy bear and a card before Sharp was led away sobbing.</p> <p>Tia's natural father, Steven Carter, who lives in Northampton but came to London to help with the search, said he would miss her for ever. He told ITV News: \"I'm heartbroken, angry, robbed. Robbed of my beautiful little girl who I will never see again, hold, kiss, touch. I don't know what to say \u2026 I want justice for my daughter \u2013 the proper way.\"</p> <p>Of the last time he saw Tia, he said: \"She jumped in my arms, she told me she loved me, we spoke about her school, what she was doing \u2026 she called me Daddy. I'll miss her forever.\"</p> <p>Detectives examined more than 800 hours of CCTV footage and received more than 300 calls to the incident room during the search with 60 reported sightings.</p>",

  "<p>For once, Afghanistan was just another country. Used to being treated as victim or headache on the international stage, its athletes lined up at the Olympics to compete as equals and revelled in showing the world another face, unconnected to decades of conflict.</p> <p>For Afghans back home, it was an emotional rollercoaster. Two weeks of competition brought the glory of the country's second ever medal, dashed hopes of a third, triumph in getting one over on its powerful neighbour Pakistan, and anger over the role of an old enemy \u2013 corruption.</p> <p>The divided nation was seized by a brief, unifying fit of taekwondo fever as the diminutive fighter who is probably the country's biggest sporting hero took to the mats. Rohullah Nikpai, whose Olympic profile lists his profession as hairdresser, is an unlikely champion: a poor former refugee, he is from the Hazara ethnic minority, which has long faced discrimination from more dominant groups.</p> <p>But his background meant nothing to millions of Afghans when he unexpectedly claimed a bronze medal in Beijing, becoming the first person from their country to stand on an Olympic podium.</p> <p>Half of Kabul stayed up late to watch him clinch another bronze in London, and one of the city's regular power cuts sent men streaming out to ice-cream stalls and other shops with generators to catch the end of one fight.</p> <p>There was joy across the country, and an explosion of excitement on social media, which has been embraced by the tiny but growing elite with internet access.</p> <p>An international community pleased to have something to celebrate in the middle of a decade-long war jumped on the bandwagon, with congratulations from the US embassy and the Nato-led coalition that has been fighting in Afghanistan for more than a decade.</p> <p>There was also elation that Afghanistan had bettered their richer and more powerful neighbour Pakistan, which has long been resented for interference in Afghan affairs.</p> <p>\"Afghanistan's Rohullah Nikpai wins Taekwondo bronze!! That's one more medal than its failed enemy, Pakistan,\" @Afghanpolicy crowed on twitter.</p> <p>The only people not caught up in the excitement seemed to be the Taliban. \"We are considering a reaction to this. Cannot say whether happy for the medal or not,\" a spokesman for the insurgent group told the BBC's Harun Najafizada.</p> <p>The country's second medal hope, Nesar Bahawi \u2013 another taekwondo fighter \u2013 lost his bronze medal bout. But having fought with injuries so severe he was taken to hospital after the match, his bravery won the hearts of Afghans.</p> <p>The aftermath of Nikpai's victory and Bahawi's near-miss also reflected some of Afghanistan's perennial problems. Government critics noted that Americans were faster than their own president to congratulate their double hero.</p> <p>And there was anger when it emerged that the country's 22-strong Olympic delegation did not include a physiotherapist. Arif Paiman, spokesman for the Olympic committee headed by Lieutenant General Muhammad Zahir Aghbar, said London organisers provided doctors for all competitors. But both taekwondo fighters were battling with injuries that might have been better managed by someone who knew them personally.</p> <p>Activists blamed corruption, a common scourge in a country that has been judged the fourth most graft-ridden in the world. \"Because every post is a political position and acquired based on affiliations to warlords and power-holders, the position of head of the Olympic committee is given to an army general who should instead be fighting the insurgency up in the mountains,\" said activist Wazhma Frogh.</p> <p>\"[Yusufzai] isn't a trained sports expert, that's why he takes his bodyguards and friends on sports-related trips \u2026 while there was no physiotherapist for injured Bahawi.\"</p> <p><em>Mokhtar Amiri contributed reporting</em></p>",
  "<h2><strong>1 The Brownlee brothers take gold and bronze</strong></h2> <p>In the weeks before these Games, the West Yorkshire brothers Alistair and Jonny Brownlee dreamed of crossing the line together in the triathlon, though they knew the Olympic rules prevented such a finish. As it turned out they both found a way to triumph. When Jonny, the younger brother, was hit with a 15-second penalty on a technicality in his changeover between the swimming and cycling it seemed his chance of a medal was gone. His brother had other ideas. Leading from the front Alistair set out at a brutal pace on the first two laps of the 10k run around the Serpentine, stretching the field and carrying only his brother and the world champion Javier G\u00f3mez with him. The tactic, which the brothers had discussed during the cycle ride, established for the breakaway trio a 30sec lead over the rest of the field, and allowed Jonny to take his penalty and still win bronze, while Alistair strode out magnificently for gold. Watching on, it seemed the closest sport has ever got to a \"two little boys had two little toys\" moment. Tear-jerking brilliance. <strong>Tim Adams</strong></p> <h2><strong>2 Wojdan Shaherkani takes to the mat</strong></h2> <p>My personal highlight was probably, in pure sporting terms, the least worthy moment of London 2012. Saudi Arabia's Wojdan Shaherkani has achieved only a blue belt in judo and it was probably thanks solely to sportsmanlike politesse that she was allowed to stay on her feet for 82 seconds before being floored by her opponent in the women's 78kg contest. As she left the mat, she did not even know which way to bow. But if it was negligible as a contest, as an act of courage it was heart-stirringly impressive \u2013 a 16-year-old girl who has never before been permitted to compete internationally, defying the hateful abuse she has received and daring to become the first woman from her country to take part in the Games. Her appearance in London was never going to win her anything but who knows, it may just inspire others to do something so shockingly transgressive as to participate in sport. <strong>Esther Addley</strong></p> <h2><strong>3 Ruta Meilutyte shocks the world</strong></h2> <p>It was day three in the Aquatics Centre and the big fish of US swimming, Michael Phelps and Ryan Lochte had been circling each other. The pool had yet to come to life but on to the deck strode a little-known 15-year-old from Lithuania in a green swim cap. Ruta Meilutyte hit the front in the 100m breaststroke and her last 25m brimmed with the confidence of a youngster never having tried and failed. She pushed to go faster and surged to gold. Grinning wildly, Meilutyte perched on the lane rope and lifted her arms wide to the 17,000 roaring fans in the steeply raked wings of seating. It was a gesture that crackled with realisation of what she had achieved despite or perhaps because of her youth and in that electrifying moment the champion and the crowd connected. <strong>Robert Booth</strong></p> <h2><strong>4 Ryan Lochte and Michael Phelps go head to head</strong></h2> <p>The single best race I saw was David Rudisha's record-breaking run in the 800m final, with Mo Farah's victory in the 5,000m just behind. But I'm going to pick the first Thursday night in the pool, when Ryan Lochte and Michael Phelps fought for the title of the greatest all-round swimmer at the Games. Both swam twice on the night, and each had about 30 minutes to recover between races. Lochte finished third in the 200m backstroke and then got blitzed by Phelps in the 200m individual medley. Phelps staggered on to the podium, so tired he had to lean against the wall to stop himself falling down, then got back in the pool and destroyed the field in his 100m butterfly semi-final, finishing in the fifth-fastest time in history \u2013 he was a lot slower when he won the final the next night. He swam with a touch of the old anger that always used to fuel him, as if to say \"you think I'm washed up? Watch this\". He has no peers. Everyone else was swimming for second. A furious Phelps is one the finest sights in sport and this was the last great evening for the greatest Olympian. <strong>Andy Bull</strong></p> <h2><strong>5 Team GB baffle the cycling world</strong></h2> <p>Cycling offered many favourite moments: Bradley Wiggins speeding past Luis Le\u00f3n S\u00e1nchez in the time trial, the women's pursuit team closing on the Americans in the final, Laura Trott's utter mastery of the elimination, the tears of Chris Hoy. But Olympic winning is the norm for GB cyclists. What was unique was when the silver medallist Gr\u00e9gory Baug\u00e9 took over the post-race press conference to quiz the newly crowned sprint champion Jason Kenny about how he did it. The Frenchman's conclusion: \"You will play possum until Rio, then \u2026 bam.\" As a summary of the opposition's complete lack of answers in the velodrome, it could not be bettered. <strong>William Fotheringham</strong></p> <h2><strong>6 Mo Farah's 10,000m triumph</strong></h2> <p>The first time I entered the Park to be greeted by witty, smiling volunteers and professional, charming soldiers was a big moment \u2013 you realised this was going to work after all. But amid a ludicrously crowded field, the first half of Mo Farah's historic double edges it as a standout sporting memory. You can ladle all the meaning on to it you like \u2013 and the sight and sound of middle England collectively losing its marbles for a Somali-born, west London-raised man of the people was something to behold \u2013 but at its core this was simply an imperious sporting feat. No British man had won the event and there had not been a non-African winner since 1984. Farah tore up the rulebook, working with his American training partner, Galen Rupp, to deal with each surge as it came, refusing to panic and striking for home with supreme confidence at 600m as the noise reached wild levels. The wall of sound in that intimate yet imposing bowl contained a note of disbelief, as if a crowd who had only just seen Jessica Ennis cross the line and Greg Rutherford jump to an unlikely gold could not believe what they were seeing. By the time Farah crossed the line to cap 47 minutes that will go down in British sporting history, there was barely a dry eye in the Olympic Stadium. Unfinished Sympathy, the Massive Attack song that was playing as Farah charged round his final lap, will never sound the same again. <strong>Owen Gibson</strong></p> <h2><strong>7 David Rudisha's 800m world record</strong></h2> <p>Few sporting achievements have left me genuinely gobsmacked but David Rudisha's victory in the 800m was one, even before all those privileged enough to witness it realised he had taken one tenth of a second off his own world record and acknowledged the feat with one of the loudest, most gutteral stadium roars I have ever heard. Such was the Kenyan's self-confidence he thought nothing of gambling the farm on breaking his record, bringing the best out of his beaten opponents in the process. So much so that Andrew Osagie's last-place finish was one of the stellar British performances of the Games. <strong>Barry Glendenning</strong></p> <h2><strong>8 Beth Tweddle's brilliant bronze</strong></h2> <p>So many highlights. Mo, double Mo, Jessica, Super Saturday, the terrier-whippet Brownlee brothers, the Caribbean stall in the Olympic Park, the myriad of flowers in the wetlands, anything in the velodrome, the tenacious British handballers and weightlifters who never stood a chance but gave it their all, Michael Phelps's final individual race, the astonishing 15 and 16-year-old gold-winning girl swimmers from China and America, Tom Daley coming good, so many wheelchairs in a city in which the disabled are all too often invisible. But best of all was Beth Tweddle's retirement bronze \u2013 ethereal grace, true grit and the hands of a navvy. My mum always loved Beth and now I know why. <strong>Simon Hattenstone</strong></p> <h2><strong>9 Nicola Adams and Katie Taylor box to gold</strong></h2> <p>Yes, the Olympic Stadium on successive Saturday nights, amid the fluttering union flags and much of the 80,000 crowd singing the national anthem \u2013 think Last Night of the Proms on steroids \u2013 was something else. But while no one will forget the Jess, Greg and Mo show, or the sequel a week later, for history on a truly epic scale you had to had to be at the ExceL on Thursday for the women's boxing finals. By some wonderful alchemy the Irish fans had turned a few hundred tickets into several thousand and for two hours they stomped and clapped and ol\u00e9-d. British supporters caught the mood, especially while <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/nicola-adams\" title=\"\">the Guardian columnist Nicola Adams</a> was bamboozling the world champion Ren Cancan to become the first women's Olympic boxing champion in history. When Katie Taylor, Ireland's golden girl, joined her about 15 minutes later the volume shot off the scale, especially when the MC announced: \"Ladies and gentleman, the winner by a score of 10 points to 8, and Olympic champion \u2013 Katie \u2026\" The rest was drowned out by exultant hosannas. The best atmosphere of the Games, bar none. <strong>Sean Ingle</strong></p> <h2><strong>10 Tumbleweed in the ExCeL</strong></h2> <p>At the ExCeL the seven-sport cocktail blurred into a ceaseless \"happening\" so there are two, related incidents. The privilege of the job is variety, so doorstepping the Kyrgyzstan wrestler Aisuluu Tynybekova as she moved through the mixed zone after her first-round loss was an experience. After confidently yelling \"Aisuluu\" she finally stopped and, understandably, waited for the question. With no Kyrgyzstani or Russian personnel present a tumbleweed moment of Pinteresque silence followed, then she walked off. The second moment came the next day when this parish's esteemed rugby correspondent questioned a line in the report of Tynybekova's 63kg bout that stated fermented horse milk is Kyrgyzstan's national drink. \"How do you actually milk a horse?\" came the quite reasonable query. <strong>Jamie Jackson</strong></p> <h2><strong>11 Beth Tweddle's uneven bars routine</strong></h2> <p>It was 12 years since Tweddle had begun her gymnastics career. In that time she had won everything \u2013 European, Commonwealth and world titles \u2013 but an Olympic medal. Despite being almost a decade past prime gymnast age, and beset by serious injuries, she had kept training and competing because a fourth place at Beijing had left her heartbroken. In qualifying, her belief-defying uneven bars routine made seasoned professionals gasp \u2013 and everyone knew that if she could just repeat it in the final, she would fulfil her dream. She did, and for the first time on a podium, the true stoic of her sport shed a quiet tear. <strong>Emma John </strong></p> <h2><strong>12 GB women's handball team v Angola</strong></h2> <p>Did they win? No. Was it close? Not even nearly. Did they try? By God, yes. The British women's handball team may not have landed a medal, or much troubled the leviathan nations of their sport, but in their Copper Box match against the world No8 team Angola, the rookie crew showed more heart, ferocity and sheer giddy joy in taking part in the Olympics than many other teams. The narrow 31-25 score line was a testament to their energy and determination, and, hopefully, a sign of greater things to come. As their coach, Jesper Holmris, said: \"If we're competitive now with only four or five years of practice, and starting totally from scratch, then of course there's a really good future for handball in Britain.\" Fingers crossed. <strong>Sam Jones</strong></p> <h2><strong>13 Jessica Ennis wins the heptathlon</strong></h2> <p>Looking back, it all began with Jessica Ennis. It was the 2012 poster girl, somehow shaking off the weight of public expectation, who got British athletics off to an incredible start that first morning in the Olympic stadium. Roared along by the crowd, the first time we felt the magic of their combined 80,000 strong voices, she gave us a sensational performance in the 100m hurdles: 12.54sec, so good it had Britain's team captain, Dai Greene, doing a double-take of the clock. The time alone put the 26-year-old in the history books \u2013 fast enough to have won gold in the individual event at all bar two Olympic Games. The pure anticipation, knowing that Ennis would go on, break more records, was spine tingling. The following evening, under an East London night sky, Britain's golden girl started the gold rush \u2013 the whoops and the tears \u2013 and then the lingering questions: did this really happen? Or were we all just dreaming? <strong>Anna Kessel</strong></p> <h2><strong>14 Jade Jones's taekwondo gold</strong></h2> <p>Picking a solitary highlight risks overlooking the sheer brilliance of Danny Boyle's opening ceremony, the inspiring deeds of Team GB's cyclists, rowers, riders and the feelgood buzz of the Games as a whole. Perhaps the best snapshot, though, was Jade \"The Headhunter\" Jones's helmet-hurling gold in the taekwondo; fearless British female excellence was the Games's constantly recurring storyline. That photo of Wiggo posing next to the \"Modfather\" Paul Weller (separated at birth?) was great, too. <strong>Robert Kitson</strong></p> <h2><strong>15 Chad le Clos steals Michael Phelps's thunder</strong></h2> <p>One of Michael Phelps's greatest triumphs as an Olympian was entwined with a loss in a discipline in which he was meant to be indestructible. In the 200m butterfly final Phelps won his 18th medal \u2013 so equaling the Olympic record \u2013 but a twist was buried inside a moment that was meant to be swathed in glory. The event that had belonged to him for over a decade ended in defeat and a silver medal when South Africa's Chad le Clos produced a blistering finish that just beat Phelps to the wall. That conclusion defined the exhilaration and pathos of sport. Bert le Clos, Chad's burly dad, then gave us the most entertaining interview of the London Olympics. <strong>Donald McRae</strong></p> <h2><strong>16 The opening ceremony</strong></h2> <p>These things are, without exception, awful. Except somehow this one wasn't. At the start of these fearfully anticipated Games it seemed almost enough that London had managed to get though this appalling game of global party charades not just unembarrassed but looking oddly and defiantly happy with itself after Danny Boyle's baroque and unapologetically intelligent left-leaning British history primer. In fact the only hole in Boyle's vision of Albion was perhaps a refusal to acknowledge the plastic rubbish that infests much of modern British life. Where was the cringe-making tat, the gurning mediocrity? On the other hand the creation of a giant looming Voldemort/David Cameron (yes, Boyle: we noticed) menacing the saintly NHS with his scythe more than made up for it. <strong>Barney Ronay</strong></p> <h2><strong>17 Murray finally wins at Wimbledon</strong></h2> <p>Got to be Henry's Hug. When the 11-year-old Henry Caplan, eyes welling up, rushed through the seats on Centre Court at Wimbledon to hug Andy Murray after he'd beaten Roger Federer to win the gold medal, sport went from theatre to humanity. Henry told his startled father he \"had to go\". It was a spontaneous gesture that captured the emotion of the moment and told us something about the changing relationship between Murray and tennis fans who have taken a little while to warm to him. If a small boy from Essex can embrace the Scot, surely the rest of the country can too. Even south of the border. <strong>Kevin Mitchell</strong></p> <h2><strong>18 Ben Ainslie's gold medal</strong></h2> <p>Ben Ainslie was simply magnificent. He trailed Jonas Hogh-Christensen throughout the preliminary 10-race series and looked beaten in the medal race. Somehow he clawed back the Dane's lead and in the final race got ahead and stayed ahead to become the most successful Olympic sailor of all time. He was skilful but it was his steely determination to win that was most impressive. He willed his way to that fourth gold. And 70,000 people turned out on the beaches, cliffs and Weymouth's stone pier to roar him home. He wasn't on great form; he shouldn't really have won it. But, somehow, you always knew he would. <strong>Steven Morris</strong></p> <h2><strong>19 GB win team showjumping gold</strong></h2> <p>I spent much of the Olympic fortnight among the horsey folk at Greenwich Park, where the arena surely offered the best views in London. I had excursions to the bizarre beach volleyball, the refined fencing and to Wimbledon, where I saw Roger Federer's epic semi-final win over Juan Mart\u00edn del Potro and then Andy Murray's demolition of the great man himself. In sporting terms, the latter must win. But in human terms, the best moment came in the team showjumping, where Britain pipped the Netherlands for gold. The Dutch should have won really \u2013 the final rider, the individual silver medallist Gerco Schr\u00f6der, just had to ride a clear round to nail it, something that was well within his compass. But he had a fence down, the contest went to a jump-off and the rest is hysteria. I would have been bereft but immediately after the jump-off I was standing next to the unsaddling arena as the British celebrated. \"That was good sport,\" one of the Dutch riders called across. I thought that was a brilliant response. \"A silver won rather than a gold lost,\" they insisted. And they meant it. <strong>Stephen Moss</strong></p> <h2><strong>20 Laura Trott goes wild for Chris Hoy</strong></h2> <p>On Super Tuesday in the velodrome I was among a scrum quizzing the new omnium gold medallist, Laura Trott, as just in front of us, Sir Chris Hoy raced in his keirin final. She politely kept talking till the crowd noise made it obvious the finish was imminent. On seeing Hoy zip across the line first Trott jumped in the air, screamed as loud as she could, danced an improvised jig, hugged a British official and went straight back into answering some anodyne question I'd just put to her. Amazing moment, and a lovely woman. <strong>Peter Walker</strong></p> <h2><strong>21 Yohan Blake runs the bend</strong></h2> <p>It was tucked away in a relay race \u2013 albeit a final that was run in a world record time \u2013 but Yohan Blake's third leg of the men's 4x100m was the best piece of bend running I have ever seen. Taking the baton from Michael Frater, he was matched against Tyson Gay, the second fastest man of all time. His legs working at a phenomenally high cadence, he reached a velocity that seemed to challenge the laws of centrifugal force and clocked a time of 9.0sec. After that, all Usain Bolt had to do was grab the stick and be himself. <strong>Richard Williams</strong></p> <h2><strong>22 Bradley Wiggins wows the time trial</strong></h2> <p>The complications of a time trial means that, quite often, at the end, you're watching hundredths of a second flick past on a giant screen instead of the riders: or if you are watching the riders, it's quite hard to work out if they've won \u2013 so there's often a split-second of perplexity. That was the moment of the London games, as the information sunk in, that Bradley Wiggins had won an Olympic gold in the same year as winning the Tour de France, and Chris Froome had got a bronze, that the home disadvantage had been overcome, all this dawning under an unexpected burst of sunlight. <strong>Zoe Williams</strong></p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 15 August 2012. The original said that Ruta Meilutyte hit the front in the 100m backstroke rather than breaststroke. This has been corrected.</p>",
  "<p>The lemon was almost too big for Vincenzo Crescenzo's grimy palm. With his nails, he scratched the fruit's bumpy skin until the white pith showed through.</p> <p>\"Smell that,\" he said, as a pungent aroma infused the steamy air of the orchard. It was 9am and Crescenzo had finished work for the day. At this time of year, he begins at five and continues \"until the heat becomes too great\".</p> <p>Crescenzo started working in the lemon groves of the Amalfi coast when he was 10. Apart from military service, and a spell as a migrant worker in Switzerland, he has worked in them ever since, growing the <em>sfusato</em> lemon \u2013&#xa0;so-called because, with its pointed ends, it looks much like a spindle, a <em>fuso</em> in Italian.</p> <p>The orchard, owned by a Roman, is tiny: five terraces with about 150 trees set into a precipitous hillside that falls away to the glittering Bay of Salerno. In a few days, Crescenzo will begin to harvest.</p> <p>This summer, he can expect around 50 cents (39p) a kilo \u2013 a big improvement on last year. Even so, the harvest will not yield a profit. \"The owner has had this orchard for 15 years and she's never once got back her costs,\" he said.</p> <p>For 73-year-old Crescenzo too, lemon-growing is something of a hobby. Like most of the others who work the orchards above Cetara, he is a pensioner. \"Young people don't go into this job,\" he said. \"They can't make any money.\"</p> <p>Behind him was one reason why: the ferry from Palermo, lazily gouging an arc of backwash through the azure surface of the bay. The route from Sicily is called the \"sea motorway\". It offers truckers an inexpensive way to shorten their journey to the markets of central and northern Italy. Many of the lorries aboard were no doubt carrying lemons far cheaper to grow than a <em>sfusato</em>.</p> <p>Along the coast in Maiori, Carlo de Riso, manager of the area's main sorting and packing plant, describes the growing of this gourmet's delight as \"heroic agriculture\". The lemons are brought down to his plant on the backs of labourers, each carrying a bag containing 57kg of fruit.</p> <p>Quixotic might be a better description than heroic, were it not that the <em>sfusato </em>brings with it a vital guarantee. \"The lemon farmers here are the sentinels of the environment,\" said Angelo Amato, vice-president of the consortium for the protection of the Amalfi coast lemon.</p> <p>With its steep cliffs, the coast is susceptible to landslides. The roots of the lemon trees help to stabilise the ground, and the dry stone walls of the terraces also play a crucial role.</p> <p>\"They are made so that the rainwater which is needed stays, while the rest drains away,\" said Mario Tozzi, a researcher at the National Research Council (CNR).</p> <p>The last deadly landslide was two years ago. But there are fears that, if the lemon groves disappear along with their mostly elderly cultivators, the area could see a major disaster like the landslides that killed 161 people in the nearby inland town of Sarno in 1998.</p> <p>\"There are some similarities,\" said Tozzi. \"The old woods above Sarno had been replaced by hazelnut trees with shallow roots.\"</p> <p>Several attempts have been made to give the <em>sfusato</em> a future. The 1990s saw the limoncello liqueur, which nowadays absorbs about 10% of the crop.</p> <p>True Amalfi coast limoncello is exquisite: airily bittersweet. But its success has led to the marketing of imitations, made either with essence or fruit that does not qualify for the protected geographical indication (PGI) the EU has conferred on Amalfi coastal lemons.</p> <p>A law was passed four years ago to give the farmers subsidies. But no funds have been found to make it effective.</p> <p>One hope for the future lies with the new, mainly young leadership of the consortium. In May, Carlo de Riso's cousin, an internationally renowned pastry chef, Sal De Riso, was chosen as&#xa0;president.</p> <p>\"I use 5,000kg of lemons a year,\" he said at his little factory, high in the mountains above the coast. De Riso said one of his aims was to put a squeeze on big firms which make <em>panettone</em> and use&#xa0;minute quantities of the Amalfi coast's lemons so they can put the PGI emblem on their packaging. They were being asked to include a minimum proportion and pay a fee to use the symbol, he said.</p> <p>The consortium is also working with the CNR to find uses for the huge number of lemons that are discarded. For every 10kg that reach the market, 16-18kg are picked. The leftovers could go into juices, ice cream and even beauty products.</p> <p>Ultimately, though, said Amato, the future depended on making the business more efficient and drawing in younger people. \"With modern irrigation equipment and a minimum of between 7,000 and 10,000 sq metres of land, you can turn a profit,\" he said.</p> <p>Of late, lemon-growing on the Amalfi coast has received a boost from an unlikely source. \"The economic crisis is bringing people back to the land,\" said De Riso. \"We even have lawyers and engineers who have returned to work the orchards belonging to their families\".</p>",
  "<p>Cristina Roman didn't know where to begin. When asked how the epic violence and criminal impunity in her native Ciudad Juarez invaded her own life, she paused, then asked: \"How far should I go back?\"</p> <p>She decided to begin from May 2010. It was then at the height of the bloodletting there in Mexico's deadliest city when, one night at 4am, she, her husband and three sons awoke to a terrible pounding at their front door. \"My husband went to see who they were. Then he said: 'Go hide with the kids. They have guns,'\" she recalled. </p> <p>\"By the time I had my baby in my arms, the gunmen were already in the house.\"</p> <p>Roman, 28, is a member of Mexicanos En Exilio \u2013 or \"Mexicans In Exile\" \u2013 a network of Mexican activists, journalists, politicos and ordinary working-class families like hers, who arrived in the United States seeking asylum from criminal assassins in Mexico. These are innocent victims of the Mexican drug war. In the words of their immigration lawyer, Carlos Spector, an immigration lawyer in El Paso, Texas, where most of these exiles end up, they \"risked their lives for truth and justice in Mexico\" and were \"forced to leave because of the Mexican government's failure or unwillingness to protect them\". </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-457479540\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/13/1344866029306/Missing-persons-poster-in-001.jpg\" alt=\"Missing persons poster in Mexico\" width=\"220\" height=\"328\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Missing persons posters in Juarez. Photograph: Daniel Hernandez</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Cristina's case is different, however. She didn't protest against corruption or document violence, but fell victim for a rather banal reason: being in the wrong place at the wrong time. The incident that put her in a drug cartel's crosshairs was a mass shooting she escaped as one of few surviving witnesses. From a small home in New Mexico, where she now lives in hiding, Cristina reflected on that event, but noted it wasn't her first brush with violence in Juarez. That's how she began describing the night three gunmen broke through her front door.</p> <p>Personal accounts like hers, while isolated, provide shocking glimpses of the trauma and tragedy that exist for people living amidst Mexico's brutal drug war. These stories also reveal a state of lawlessness that experts say is unlikely to stop any time soon.</p> <p>As gunman entered her home, Cristina told her sons, aged eight and six, to stay calm. The men soon called for her to come out. She did, and was immediately grabbed and thrown to the floor. The men then pistol-whipped her husband, who collapsed next to her. \"They asked for money, jewelry, car keys, everything they wanted,\" she recalled. \"I said: 'I don't know what you're looking for, but you can take whatever you want. I only want my children.'\" </p> <p>One man \u2013 \"El Vato\" \u2013 hovered over her saying he would execute them all. Another gunman then said: \"What are you doing? We came for him. Don't get out of control.\"</p> <p>He said: \"Go to your kids' room, close the door, and no matter what you hear, don't leave, don't speak.\" Cristina did as told. And for the next half hour heard them beating her husband. He groaned and wept through the assault as she huddled with their sons in silence.</p> <p>After 30 minutes, when the noise finally ceased, Cristina came out to the awful realization that her husband had been kidnapped. Two hours later, her brother-in-law received a phone call with ransom instructions.</p> <p>Cristina's husband owned a small used-car dealership, and over the next two days, she and her brother-in-law hustled to sell his lot, liquidate assets, raise funds, withdraw savings. \"We did everything we could to get all the money together and paid half the ransom the first day, the other half the second day,\" she said, her voice quivering. \"The third day they were supposed to return him and they didn't. The fourth day they threw his dead body in the street.\"</p> <p>Mexican president Felipe Calderon often claims that 90% of the drug war victims are criminals. That vague sentencing of 60,000 people naturally enrages victims' families. </p> <p>Nik Steinberg, a Mexico researcher for Human Rights Watch, also disputes its validity. \"The government has not produced empirical evidence to back up this claim,\" he said. \"Instead what we have found in the overwhelming majority of killings in Mexico is that the government has not even opened a criminal investigation, let alone charged or sentenced someone.\"</p> <p>The men who killed Cristina's husband were never brought to justice. There is no way to know whether they worked for the Zetas or Sinoloa cartels, which are active in Juarez Valley. That is a strong possibility, however. According to Ben West, an analyst for geopolitical intelligence firm Stratfor, the cartels have increasingly diversified their criminal activity to include extortion, kidnapping and human trafficking, in response to losses incurred in the drug trade. <br>Ironically, this means that Mexican civilians are becoming victims of their government's success. </p> <p>West added: \"You have criminal groups taking advantage of the overall security situation and basically pulling people at gunpoint and saying give me your money. With the police all caught up in this, there is no rule of law.\"</p> <p>Cristina took a job at a Juarez nightclub after her husband's murder. She went from stay-at-home mother to single breadwinner for three overnight, and moved in with her parents so they could help.</p> <p>And for almost a year, they managed. Then the cartel violence found her again.</p> <p>On 31 March, 2011, at about 8.30pm, a group of federal police officers entered the bar telling everyone to line up against the wall. Searching for weapons, they padded men between the legs, looked up women's skirts, emptied handbags and checked bathroom stalls. That level of scrutiny was unprecedented, Cristina said. At one point an officer even began groping a colleague of hers. She intervened, saying: \"Hey \u2013 we respect you and your work, you should respect us. You can't treat us like that.\" The man backed off, but not before delivering an ominous message. \"You haven't seen anything yet,\" he said. \"The worst is yet to come.\"</p> <p>And truly, it was.</p> <p>A few minutes after the police left, two men entered the bar carrying automatic weapons. A man near entrance lunged for the doorway and they shot him. \"That was the first person to go down,\" Cristina recalled. \"I dropped to the floor. Everyone was screaming with fear.\" </p> <p>With ruthless abandon, the assassins opened fire in every direction, killing all they could, shooting everyone in sight. \"I could see people around me in pain, some people dead,\" Cristina recalled. At some point the men lit the bar on fire. A waitress next to Cristina ran as soon as they left, saying: \"I'd rather be shot to death than burn.\"</p> <p>\"When it sounded like all the shooting had stopped, and you could smell the place was starting to burn, I had to go too,\" Cristina said. She ran outside, where several cars were on fire. </p> <p>She ran to the parking lot and suddenly froze when four pairs of headlights turned on. They were four federal police trucks. They had never left. \"The only thing I thought at that moment was: Sin Madre,\" she said \u2013 a phrase that literally means \"motherless\" but is also slang for \"goddammit.\"</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-457479541\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/13/1436786653972/Feliz-Viaje-001.jpg\" alt=\"Feliz Viaje\" width=\"460\" height=\"440\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A sign wishing travellers a good trip, between Ciudad Juarez and the United States. Photograph: Daniel Hernandez</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Daniel Hernandez</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Incredibly, municipal police pulled up just then. They jumped from their cars, hurling curses at their rivals. \"They turned their attention to them,\" Cristina said, referring to the federal police, who refused to let the responding officers through. \"That's the only reason I got away.\"</p> <p>Despite serious efforts to purge corruption from their ranks, reports of Mexican law enforcement engaged in criminal activity are rampant. \"What mostly happens is police officers work by day for the city, then as a side job also do security for the cartels,\" said West, of Strator. \"And that obviously creates all sorts of conflicts of interest.\"</p> <p>\"All levels of police are implicated,\" he added. \"But what is probably most alarming is that the military is also falling into corruption. The government is running out of tools to fight this problem.\"</p> <p>Cristina showed great poise escaping the El Castillo bar massacre; she fell into a daze, however, immediately afterward. \"I was just wandering,\" she said, \"lost, till 4am when I finally got back to the house.\"</p> <p>The following day, three survivors gave statements to police about the event. Too intimidated, Cristina refused. She had no plans to talk, but that wouldn't make a difference, unfortunately. About a week later, a friend from the bar \u2013 another survivor \u2013 called Cristina to warn her that \"sicarios\" \u2013 assassins \u2013 were asking for them at nightclubs downtown. </p> <p>Cristina had no intention of going to work at a nightclub again. \"I just couldn't,\" she said. Nevertheless, they found her one afternoon driving on a highway. They drove a Dodge Ram, and tried to bully her toward the shoulder. They wore masks, her son said, and tried to run her off the road but somehow she pulled away. </p> <p>\"I'm still not sure how I managed to keep control of the car,\" she said. \"They tried to kill me with my kids.\"</p> <p>She stayed up that night thinking about what to do. \"It had gotten to the point where I was very scared, always worried that people were looking for me,\" she said. \"I was terrified for my children.\" </p> <p>\"I talked to my oldest son Raul about the possibility of coming to the US,\" she recalled. \"I thought about it all night, and then on the 13 April I took my boys and what I could pack and went to the bridge.\"</p> <p>According to the department of homeland security, 4,400 Mexican nationals have applied for US asylum in 2012. That number already exceeds the 4,000 requests filed in 2011, and is more than three times the 1,200 made in 2005, before the drug war began.</p> <p>These people represent a fraction of the displaced, of course. And only a fraction of them will see their requests granted. Over the past six years, only 11% of asylum cases from Mexican nationals were granted. And that average is trending downward. As Crystal Massey, an activist in Spector's office, explained: \"Unless you can show that you belong to a particular social group that is not the whole country right now, you don't qualify for asylum.\"</p> <p>Cristina's first hearing is this fall. With federal police implicated in the massacre she witnessed, she hopes a immigration judge will find her government complicit in her persecution. </p> <p>Her mother, sister, brother-in-law and nephews will go through asylum hearings too. They followed Cristina across the border after their own tragic run in with \"sicarios\". Gunman showed up at their door recently demanding to know Cristina's US address. Her father refused to reveal it, and for his loyalty he was taken with the promise that the rest of the family was next. </p> <p>Her father was never seen again and is assumed killed. When asked for her full name and age \u2013 \"Cristina Roman Dozal, 28\" \u2013 Cristina offered his name too: \"Manuel Roman.\"</p> <p>And it's deaths like his, and her husband's, and the ruthless killings of innocents at the El Castillo bar that cause Cristina to grow upset when confronted by the claim that 90% of Mexican drug war victims are criminals. </p> <p>\"In their crossfire they're getting innocent people. In the bar where I worked, maybe they were going after one bad person, but they killed innocent people too. And then there is more bloodshed when they pursue the witnesses,\" she said, her voice quivering. \"They go for a person, kill their mother, kill their brother. They kill lots of innocent people. They killed my father. It just keeps spreading out and it's mostly innocent people.\"</p>",
  "<p>The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/13/australia-asylum-seekers-pacific-islands\" title=\"\">Australian government's plan to process people on Nauru and Manus Island</a> won't stop refugees making the boat journey to Australia. People risk their lives trying to get here because they feel like they have no other option.</p> <p>When I first saw the boat on which I was going to travel from Indonesia to Christmas Island, I thought there was a very good chance I would die at sea, but what else could I do? I couldn't return to Afghanistan because I'd been beaten many times as a result of my work with the UN election monitoring team there.</p> <p>One of the local political parties accused me of working against them. It wasn't true but every time they saw me, they were beating and torturing me. My life was in danger so I crossed into Pakistan and paid a people-smuggler US$7,000 to get me to Australia. Getting on that boat to Christmas Island was my only option.</p> <p>The journey was terrifying. There were about 120 people on the boat and we were held below deck. It was hot, dark and full of generator fumes. Throughout the 80-hour journey, all we wanted was some fresh air. Many people, including me, were sick the whole way. There were no life jackets on board and I had never travelled by sea before. We had a few lemons, some rice and a bit of water to drink.</p> <p>On the third night at sea we thought the boat was going to sink because the engine had broken down. There were huge waves and we all thought we were going to die. They managed to fix the boat and one of the smugglers told us the Australian navy would rescue us.</p> <p>At one o'clock in the morning, they arrived and took us to Christmas Island. I spent a month there before being moved to another detention centre in Tasmania. Now I have permanent residency in Australia.</p> <p>I think the only way to stop people from making that dangerous trip to Christmas Island is to process more people in Indonesia. At the moment the UNCHR takes a very long time to process anyone there and people feel they have no option but to get on the boats.</p> <p><em>\u2022 Maisam's name has been changed to protect his identity</em></p>",
  "<h2>Seattle Sounders have had a week of sucker punches</h2> <p>When you've had a difficult week, it's possible that the last person you want to see flailing his way towards you is Steven Lenhart. And when you think that you've actually ended that week on a surprise upbeat note, it must just add insult to injury when Lenny pops up with yet another injury time goal to sucker punch you just before the final bell.</p> <p>In the 91st minute of injury time, Seattle looked to have beaten San Jose at their own game, by scoring a late, late equalizer through Fredy Montero, to silence Buck Shaw stadium. It had been a draining week for Seattle - having won three consecutive US Open Cup titles, they were <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2012/aug/09/us-open-cup-2012-final-sporting-kansas-city-seattle-sounders\">denied a fourth on penalties at Sporting K</a>C, in a shootout that included a controversial retaken penalty, after Gspurning was adjudged to have come off his line to save Nagamura's 4th penalty. Had the save stood it would have tilted the shootout Seattle's way for the last two penalties - but Johnson missed his final kick in the wake of the incident and the Sounders' remarkable Cup run was over, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0zBKtfAZCA\">on an emotional night at Livestrong Park</a>.</p> <p>So it must have felt like a cathartic moment when Montero pounced to tie up the scores on Saturday night. He had had a terribly subdued Cup final and started this game on the bench, as did the exhausted Johnson and the playmaker Rosales. But with San Jose leading 1-0 through a second half Dawkins goal, all three were thrown on by Sigi Schmid, in search of an equalizer, and his bold move looked to have got its reward, as Montero played San Jose at their own late show game.</p> <p>They should have waited a minute. There was still time for a stung San Jose team to maraud upfield and pick up a couple of corners, the second of which was met by the head of Lenhart to secure yet another late result for San Jose and deliver yet another sucker punch to Seattle. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-audio\" data-canonical-url=\"http://p.mlssoccer.com/SAu5a/video/1109804/1109804_2012-08-12-005904.640hq.mp4\"> <object width=\"620\" height=\"349\" id=\"cf33a91oi\" name=\"cf33a91on\" classid=\"clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://p.mlssoccer.com/SAu5a/video/1109804/1109804_2012-08-12-005904.640hq.mp4\" /><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\" /><param name=\"allowScriptAccess\" value=\"always\" /><embed width=\"460\" height=\"369\" src=\"https://p.mlssoccer.com/SAu5a/video/1109804/1109804_2012-08-12-005904.640hq.mp4\" id=\"cf33a91ei\" name=\"cf33a91en\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" allowFullScreen=\"true\" allowScriptAccess=\"always\" /></object> </figure>  <p>.<br>Lenhart is one of those players who seems to both invite and deny description - for this week's attempt I'll just say that watching him go up for that ball in slo-mo must have provoked the same reaction on the Seattle bench as seeing a dog that has jumped in the lake arrive back among a linen-clad picnic, to shake himself dry: \"Lenny! Nooooooooooooo...\" </p> <p>He's just being Lenhart. But Seattle could have done without seeing him, and San Jose, at the end of a tough week. </p> <h2>Sporting's celebrations continue</h2> <p>The past week will live long in the memory of Sporting Kansas City fans.</p> <p>After clinching their first piece of silverware since 2004 on Wednesday \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2012/aug/09/us-open-cup-2012-final-sporting-kansas-city-seattle-sounders\">the shootout win over Seattle</a> at a raucous LiveStrong Sporting Park captured the 2012 US Open Cup \u2013 they also returned to the summit of the Eastern conference on Saturday night.</p> <p>Facing a long time leader of the East (D.C. United) straight after going 120 minutes in a grueling and emotional cup final victory in front of your own fans wasn't ideal for SKC. But they thoroughly deserved the three points, as a celebratory mood reverberated around LSP all night long.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-audio\" data-canonical-url=\"http://p.mlssoccer.com/SAu5a/video/1109682/1109682_2012-08-11-224822.640hq.mp4\"> <object width=\"620\" height=\"349\" id=\"cfc6665oi\" name=\"cfc6665on\" classid=\"clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://p.mlssoccer.com/SAu5a/video/1109682/1109682_2012-08-11-224822.640hq.mp4\" /><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\" /><param name=\"allowScriptAccess\" value=\"always\" /><embed width=\"460\" height=\"369\" src=\"https://p.mlssoccer.com/SAu5a/video/1109682/1109682_2012-08-11-224822.640hq.mp4\" id=\"cfc6665ei\" name=\"cfc6665en\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" allowFullScreen=\"true\" allowScriptAccess=\"always\" /></object> </figure>  <p>.</p> <p>Teal Bunbury headed Graham Zusi's corner home for the opener but DC hit back in the first half with Andy Najar's run and pass finished off at the back post by Nick DeLeon. But Zusi proved the hero for SKC, smashing home the winner just after the hour mark. Zusi shone on Saturday. He set up the first \u2013 a league leading tenth assist of the season \u2013 scored the winner and hit the woodwork twice. His energetic display came after going the distance on Wednesday versus Seattle, proving his immense appetite for success across the board. </p> <p>The University of Maryland product hasn't had it all his own way this season - after starting the season in the same sensational fashion he displayed in 2011, Zusi's form had petered off of late. Initially called up to Jurgen Klinsmann's national team camp in June, he was then omitted from the squad for the US friendlies against Scotland, Canada and Brazil. That seemed to knock his confidence, and it was no coincidence that as Zusi's form nosedived, so did Sporting's. After winning their opening seven games of the season, Sporting hit an inconsistent run. But things are once again looking rosy in that part of the Midwest. And with Bunbury's return to form \u2013 notching two goals in his last two games \u2013 coupled with Zusi at his creative best, that sparks trouble for the rest of the league. The latter manages to find pockets of space in wide areas, and between opposition midfield and defenses, with ease - and Sporting hope to thrive on that.</p> <p>Now back on top of the pack clambering for the Eastern conference, Sporting will have their work cut out to stay there. They face New York twice and Houston once, in their next five games, signifying a pivotal stretch that'll go a long way to deciding who clinches the conference crown. Having the wizardry of Zusi on tap could well be the determining factor that tips the scales in Sporting KC's favor.</p> <p>As for New York and Houston, second and third behind SKC respectively, they cancelled each other out over the last week, with <a href=\"http://www.mlssoccer.com/matchcenter/2012-08-10-ny-v-hou/highlights\">New York's 2-0 win on Friday night</a> at Red Bull Arena avenging last Friday's 2-0 loss to the Dynamo at BBVA. <strong>JPW</strong></p> <h2>Real Salt Lake can't maintain traction, Vancouver Whitecaps gaining it </h2> <p>This has been a difficult couple of months for Real Salt Lake, who by their own high standards, and those of Jason Kreis, look curiously vulnerable. The Rio Tinto is not the fortress it once was, and while several of the veterans at the core of a great side are still there and producing, there remains the sense that at times the project has been running on fumes this year. At any given time you know that Saborio or Espindola are likely to burst out and have one of those unplayable games (and Saborio was unlucky to <a href=\"http://www.mlssoccer.com/matchcenter/2012-08-11-van-v-rsl/highlights?videoID=196193\">glance a brave attempt off the post</a> with the score at 0-0 on Saturday), but yesterday's game with Vancouver was symptomatic of a growing trend with RSL, where they fall behind and can't get back into the game.</p> <p>It's easy to forget that earlier in the season we were briefly talking about RSL rather than San Jose as the team you could never put away, but you wonder how much of that was due to a residual mindset from a team that was already beginning to break up (in that peculiar inevitability that eventually forces even a steadily built MLS team to cycle in younger, cheaper players, due to the salary cap). The <a href=\"http://www.mlssoccer.com/matchcenter/2012-08-11-van-v-rsl/highlights\">2-1 defeat to Vancouver</a> was Real's second straight loss. They'll probably win next week - they're still a good side and can demonstrably beat anyone in the league on their day. But it's hard to see how they're going to be going into the play-offs with momentum at this point, as opposed to say Houston, San Jose, LA, or even their hosts in Saturday's game, Vancouver.</p> <p>Martin Rennie may have wanted to swap notes with Kreis yesterday. Rennie's in the upswing stage of his team's cycle - players like Robson, Miller and Dane Richards (<a href=\"http://www.mlssoccer.com/matchcenter/2012-08-11-van-v-rsl/highlights?videoID=196202\">scorer of a classy second on Saturday</a>) are joining an already overhauled blend animated by the rookie striker Darren Mattocks - and the Whitecaps look to be getting stronger and stronger. Rennie has driven them to resolute home form in particular, after inheriting a side who'd had an uninspiring expansion year - thus also inheriting a mandate for change. As things stand they'll be a threat in the run-in and play-offs, but what will be fascinating is watching how Rennie juggles this side over the next couple of years - as salary cap demands meet the need to continually develop and introduce young players to his system.</p> <p>Kreis is still an exemplar of how to do this, and if this is a transition year, it's worth remembering that second in the overall standings is the envy of most of those at full tilt behind his team. But with Champions League fixtures kicking in now, an already stretched squad may continue to struggle to maintain what traction they have. They're 5 points behind San Jose now, with Vancouver and Seattle a further 5 points back and now the Galaxy lurking a mere point behind those two. <a href=\"http://www.mlssoccer.com/standings\">The West is tightening</a> <strong>GP</strong></p> <h2>Donovan is the King of the SuperClasico</h2> <p>If your going to win the SuperClasico, you might as well win it in style. <a href=\"http://www.mlssoccer.com/matchcenter/2012-08-12-chv-v-la/recap\">The LA Galaxy dismantled Chivas USA on Sunday night</a>, drubbing The Goats 4-0 courtesy of an inspired performance from captain Landon Donovan. It was the perfect way to bounce back after a 4-0 loss of their own, after their lopsided loss to Seattle last time out. The Galaxy certainly displayed character, to reaffirm their playoff credentials after the defeat at CenturyLink Field. </p> <p>Assisting on all four goals on Sunday, Donovan now leads the league in assists and has 9 goals and 12 assists in 21 SuperClasico matchups. Donovan was at his creative best, but Chivas gave him far too much time to wreak havoc. The Goats are having a much better season in 2012 and boasted the league's best defense before the derby, but now their faint playoff hopes look to be on the brink. They have four games in hand of their fierce rivals but sit ten points behind LA, who occupy the final postseason berth. </p> <p>It was the Galaxy's fifth straight SuperClasico series win, and they've now won the title seven times out of eight. The king of the SuperClasico, Donovan, moved fourth all-time in MLS assists (105), but was keen to point out the superb play of his teammates in the blowout win:</p> <p>\"Our team was great tonight, and when we defend that way, it makes my job really easy. I don't have to do a lot of defending. I can focus on things that I'm good at, and when I had the ball, guys made good runs, intelligent runs. They wanted the ball. They wanted to score, so it made it really easy.\"</p> <p>On the night LA sparkled; they went 1-0 up after Donovan set up Keane as the duo combined to tear open Chivas' defense, but the second took a long time coming as Dan Kennedy stood on his head in goal for the Rojiblancos. However Donovan soon delivered twice for Brazilian Juninho to finish with aplomb, before whipping in a corner seven minutes from time that Omar Gonzalez headed home for his first goal since 2011, after recovering from an ACL tear. </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/GmIFfeMAcrg?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"369\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/GmIFfeMAcrg\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>.</p> <p>LA now sit just one point behind Seattle and Vancouver in the West, who are third and fourth respectively. They still have David Beckham to return, as his duty at the London 2012 games came to a close. That shows the depth LA now have at their disposal, after superb performances from other midfielders Marcelo Sarvas and two-goal hero Juninho.</p> <p>But the night belonged to Donovan, who now travels to Mexico City to play in a \"friendly\" for the USA at the Azteca. Donovan travels South of the Border in fine form, with his side now having lost just once in their last seven league games. His involvement for Jurgen Klinsmann's side means he will miss LA's emotional league game with Columbus on Wednesday. In Sunday night's game, the Galaxy honored the late Crew midfielder Kirk Urso with <a href=\"https://twitter.com/LAGalaxy/status/234884973038039040 \">armbands bearing his name and number 15</a>. <strong>JPW</strong></p> <h2>Columbus Crew and Toronto FC honor Kirk Urso</h2> <p>Yesterday Columbus Crew were due to face their northern rivals Toronto FC in the first game since the sudden death of young midfielder Kirk Urso last weekend. As the weekend approached, a somber Crew organization tried to rally themselves for what would inevitably be a very difficult day for the family, friends and colleagues of the young player - promising to give their all in the game as a tribute to the player's own commitment and enthusiasm for the game.</p> <p>Then at the end of the week, when it became apparent that Urso's funeral was taking place this weekend, Toronto <a href=\"http://www.thecrew.com/news/2012/08/crew-vs-toronto-fc-match-rescheduled-august-22\">agreed to postpone the game</a> to allow the Columbus players to attend the ceremony, and honor their team mate alongside his family and friends. It was the right decision - there's always an argument for what someone \"would have wanted\", but in this case it felt like a weight that this particular sporting occasion was not designed to bear. Better to pause.</p> <p>As it turned out, Toronto's gesture allowed for a very specific type of respect to be paid between rival fans - writing in the comments section of our weekend preview Ben Hoelzel, of the main Columbus supporters group, Crew Union, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>On behalf of Crew supporters, I would like to say that this a very class gesture by the Toronto organization (which already has a congested schedule with CCL play).</p> <p>And the TFC fans and Crew supporters that usually have a go at each other on the online forums leading up to these games have shown nothing but class and respect. Yes there is some rivalry there, but there are some things more important than sport. So, thank you to those TFC supporters that have shown some true class this week in the wake of this tragedy.</p> </blockquote> <p>There's not much to add to that, but Joe and I would like to again wish all strength to the Urso family, Kirk's friends, and all at the Crew organization, at this difficult time. <strong>GP</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.mlssoccer.com/standings\">MLS Standings</a></p>",
  "<p>Is it all over yet? I must confess that I fell asleep several times during Sunday night's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/gallery/2012/aug/12/london-2012-closing-ceremony-pictures\" title=\"\">Olympic closing ceremony</a>, which went on a bit too long. At various points I became convinced that the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/aug/13/olympic-games-closing-ceremony-culture\" title=\"\">great pagan pop festival</a> was about to end. But no, Rio's carnival crew popped up to give us a taster for 2016 (I think they'll manage) and the final speeches gave way to Take That or The Who. Was that Darcey Bussell? What was she doing there with the old rockers?</p> <p>But I'm falling into a familiar trap: carping about a creatively chaotic conclusion to a magnificently well organised and enjoyable global celebration, which Britain hosted in great style. I can only find one half-hearted whinge (is it a record?) in today's coverage in the Daily Mail (two if you count the \"What was druggie Kate Moss doing there?\" article). Moss-bashing is a Mail campaign.</p> <p>I <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2012/jun/01/britain-olympic-gold-moaning\" title=\"\">complained about this </a>six weeks ago when the gloomsters were working themselves up into a lather about everything going wrong. In the event only G4S, the private sector security contractor, really screwed up, only to have <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/jul/24/london-2012-olympics-g4s-military\" title=\"\">the armed forces step in</a> and become the unplanned hit of the Games.</p> <p>As usual, most of the cynics and miserablists turned out to be closet sentimentalists who went overboard in the opposite direction once they spotted they'd backed the wrong horse this time. So I was both appalled and impressed that <a href=\"http://hitchensblog.mailonsunday.co.uk/2012/08/if-you-believe-that-olympic-glory-makes-a-nation-great-just-remember-the-ussr.html\" title=\"\">Mail on Sunday columnist, Peter (brother of Christopher) Hitchens</a>, was willing to appear on Radio 4's Today on Monday morning to denounce the closing ceremony as a \"moronic inferno\".</p> <p>What's more, said Hitchens, it was proof that the Christian monarchy we used to inhabit has been overthrown by what I think he called \"New Labour totalitarianism\", underpinned by pop music. Reactionaries always think this way, the decline from past glory is a form of romanticism, though they mistake it for realism.</p> <p>Hitchens's Larkin-esque tirade includes you, Boris and Dave: Hitchens says you're both enslaved by the New Labour zeitgeist and that George Osborne calls Tony Blair \"The Master\". Incidentally, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/aug/13/politicians-success-london-olympics\" title=\"\">Blair was annoying in his own way</a> on the same Radio 4 show, but has the merit of being cheerful. His interpretation of the message of the London Games was that modern Britain is about diversity within common and shared core values.</p> <p>Let's hope he's right, since there's no visible alternative. The hard task now as we return to the day job, complete with hangover recession and the rest, is realistically to assess how best the feel-good legacy of the Games can be exploited for the common good \u2013 from urban regeneration to healthier kids and revitalised tourism \u2013 without going completely barking in the opposite direction of Peter Hitchens in proclaiming a new Britain has been born this past 16 days, or that an old one has been re-born.</p> <p>I'll serve up Tory MEP Dan Hannan's, <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-2184689/Multiculturalism-Nonsense-The-Olympics-victory-patriotism-common-British-values.html\" title=\"\">blowhard article in last week's Mail, </a>which asserted that Team GB's triumph and the nation's mood were not vindications of multiculturalism or New Labour collectivism, but of the competitive spirit and deeply held voluntary traditions.</p> <p>It's no worse than many others of the genre. Desperate Dan \u2013 whom I love to tease as \"Peruvian-born Dan\" during his uber-patriotic outbursts \u2013 makes some good points, though claiming that the Games vindicate Norman Tebbit's famous \"cricket test\" is stretching it a bit. But the other side has good points to make, too.</p> <p>As Martin Ivens fairly explained in the Sunday Times, \"the Tories have a guilty past\", those 10,000 playing fields sold off under Maggie and Major, that vital funding and PE targets recently slashed by Michael Gove. Like most of life's endeavours, achievement is usually a mixture of co-operation and competition. Was it not Isaac Newton who said \"If I have seen further than other men it is because I have stood on the shoulders of giants\", in much the same way that athletes have paced each other and generously praised each other in victory and defeat these past two weeks?</p> <p>If Premier League footballers, foul-mouthed, over-paid louts that too many of them are, can capture half the spirit in the coming season we will all be better off. It is not true that \"nice guys finish last\". If it was, our footballers really would be world beaters.</p> <p>The awkward fact is that, just as Labour once sanctioned a lot of nonsense about the unhealthy nature of competition (those of us never picked for the team get the point, though it's wrong), so many conservatives kid themselves that it's all about liberating people from the burdensome state. The state is there to protect and nurture. It is all about proper boundaries.</p> <p>I heard usually risk-averse Mitt Romney's new running mate, Paul Ryan, banging on about the wicked state last night. That should scare floating American voters. Obama may not be a great president, but he is a lucky one. It was Jess Ennis who thrived in Sheffield's publicly funded sports facilities, the gracious Ennis too who gently told an interviewer that young athletes shouldn't be forced to compete too young.</p> <p>So the politicians will use their autumn conference speeches to claim that the London Olympics vindicate their own vision of 21st-century Britain; they will make both valid claims and dud ones. We need not listen to them too hard. Mo Farah is more fun to listen too and more gracious. He also seems very smart. Nice guys sometimes do surmount setbacks and come first. Not many, alas, but enough to cheer us all up at the prospect.</p> <p>In summary, just that may be the real legacy of the London Games: a surge of enjoyable happiness, which has embraced some people who had expected to be indifferent. Even without the Bank of England's Eeyore, Mervyn King, (silver medalist to Peter Hitchens's gold?), warning everyone that the halo effect may not do much for the economy, history suggests the economic benefit is likely to be modest.</p> <p>We can't be sure. David Cameron's upbeat prediction may be right after all. But there's a lot to be said for a cheering-up in hard times, even an expensive one like this. It's been the biggest mood-changer since the Falklands war (also costly) in 1982, a retired general told the Times letters column today.</p> <p>That's an interesting comparison, a reminder that this country seems to pull the stops out and perform really well when its back is against the wall. So it's good to see a nation (four nations if you prefer) looking at ease with itself and be reminded that the things which unite us remain powerful and generous in spirit on occasion.</p> <p>Me, I love the idea of the golden post boxes being repainted in Olympiads' neighbourhoods. Daft but nice. Back in the real world the economy is still flat-lining and the bills must be paid, Syria is still bleeding, the polar ice cap is melting faster than we feared and <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-2187422/A-bride-41-John-Cleese-72--years-marriage-No-3-ended-12m-divorce.html\" title=\"\">John Cleese has just remarried </a>for the fourth time. As the nights draw in and queues return to Heathrow, it's surely best to remember Mo's beam. Those golden post boxes should help.</p>",
  "<p>As the puffed-out chests of many of its inhabitants demonstrates, Great Britain is feeling rather smug about the Olympics. But how has the sporting extravaganza been seen around the world?</p> <h2>Australia</h2> <p>Still reeling from a poor performance that saw them come only 10th in the medal table, Australia nonetheless gave London 2012 a large thumbs-up. At least one Aussie risked being ostracised by suggesting London may even have gone one better than Sydney in 2000. \"These Olympics had Sydney's vibrancy, Athens's panache, Beijing's efficiency, and added British know-how and drollery,\" wrote Greg Baum, in the <a href=\"http://www.smh.com.au/olympics/news-london-2012/the-verdict-its-been-a-right-bangup-job-20120812-242we.html#ixzz23PvfIPBq\" title=\"\">Sydney Morning Herald</a>. \"With apologies to Sydney, they might just represent a new PB [personal best] for the Olympics.\"</p> <h2>China</h2> <p>The enthusiasm for London 2012 was a little more muted in Bejing, the 2008 hosts. In a poll on <a href=\"http://www.huanqiu.com/\" title=\"\">huanqiu.com</a> \u2013 the website of the populist state-run tabloid Global Times \u2013 95% of respondents thought Jacques Rogge wrong to praise London 2012 as happy and glorious. There is continuing anger at the badminton debacle that saw one Chinese pair and three from other nations disqualified. \"Judges had double standards and made themselves look very unprofessional,\" one commenter wrote below the poll results. \"And the tickets were shockingly expensive. The worst Olympics ever! From this Olympics, we see the fall of the [English] gentleman.\"</p> <p>In a similar poll on <a href=\"http://www.ifeng.com/\" title=\"\">ifeng.com</a>, more than 56% of the 190,000 who voted gave a low rating to London 2012 due to poor organisation and the questionable judgment of referees, with 68% deeming the Beijing Games more successful. One user on the <a href=\"http://www.weibo.com/\" title=\"\">Sina Weibo</a> microblog said: \"London Games' has become a swear word.\"</p> <h2>US</h2> <p>There was a little more love across the Atlantic, with a <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/13/sports/olympics/a-memorable-and-musical-olympic-closing-ceremony.html?pagewanted=all\" title=\"\">blog by David Segal in the New York Times</a> which noted that \"the Games have hit this country like an extra-strength dose of a mood-enhancing drug\". The alarmists and detractors had little fodder, he noted. \"Even the weather played nice. This was an astoundingly seamless production, given the size of this city and the scale of the endeavour.\"</p> <p>Newspapers on the west coast hailed the Olympics as a triumph of British spectacle and innovation. \"Without getting too mushy, my take-away is always that, at heart, people want to get along and respect each other's cultures while seeing the world's best athletes do awesome stuff,\" mushed <a href=\"http://www.mercurynews.com/mark-purdy/ci_21297430/purdy-classic-mementos-these-london-olympics?source=pkg\" title=\"\">the San Jose Mercury News</a>, singling out the volunteers for special praise. \"London made that happen again. Cheerio to all responsible. Well done.\"</p> <p>Bill Dwyre, the LA Times correspondent, said Britain had <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/sports/olympics/la-sp-oly-dwyre-closing-ceremony-20120813,0,700270.column\" title=\"\">captured the essence of the event</a>. \"Every four years, some of us who type for a living lose about three weeks of our lives to gain a lifetime of experiences. It is called the Olympic Games.\" The finale, he said, capped a magical Games. \"It is a wonderful, captivating musical show.\"</p> <h2>Israel</h2> <p>The Israeli press, full of anguish about the country's poor showing at the Olympics, praised London's staging of the Games. \"The London Olympics gets a high score,\" wrote Uzi Dann on the front page of the liberal daily, <a href=\"http://www.haaretz.com/\" title=\"\">Haaretz</a>. It wasn't, he said, \"as perfectly staged as those in Beijing, but there was a much better atmosphere, a genuine carnival feeling. The athleticism was outstanding, the crowd was wonderful (even if it was overly patriotic) and the Olympics organisers were astoundingly nice, polite and obliging.\"</p> <h2>Thailand</h2> <p>In Thailand, papers focused on their country's own poor performance after athletes failed to bring home anything but silver and bronze despite winning gold medals at every Games since 1992. Meanwhile, in Malaysia, badminton silver medallist Chong Wei has been forced to apologise to Chinese rival Lin Dan over a controversial YouTube rap video in which the gold medal winner was denigrated as \"cocky\" and \"on dope\" before being warned by film-maker (and sometimes rapper) Namewee: \"I see you one time, I beat you up one time.\"</p> <h2>Germany</h2> <p>German commentators have marvelled in the past two weeks at the way in which the British confidence in their own identity has received a boost thanks to the Olympics.</p> <p>Gina Thomas, wrote in the <a href=\"http://www.faz.net/\" title=\"\">Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung</a>, that \"Britons who for years have become used to their own failings have amazed themselves at the Olympic Games. In the Olympic frenzy that has captured the nation and turned cynics into a happy human throng, Britain is celebrating itself not only as a country of immigration, but after years of growing separatist tendencies, once again as a united kingdom.\"</p> <h2>France</h2> <p>Despite the disappointment of Paris having lost out to London to run the 2012 games and David Cameron's stoking of cross-Channel awkwardness over fair play and false starts in the cycling, France's verdict on the running of the Olympics was an enthusiastic pat on the back. \"Extremely positive\" both in terms of \"sporting results and organisation\", said the daily <a href=\"http://www.liberation.fr/\" title=\"\">Lib\u00e9ration</a>, while <a href=\"http://www.lemonde.fr/\" title=\"\">Le Monde</a> noted that Britain has as many \"whingers and professional pessimists\" as France, and these had gladly predicted doom, gloom and chaos before the start of the Games, but had been proved wrong.</p> <p>As well as new British sporting faces \u2013 and France did question whether British sport was dominated by the upper-classes (based in part on the royal equestrian presence) \u2013 Paris discovered a character they previously knew next to nothing about: Boris Johnson. \"And the winner is \u2026 Boris,\" said a headline in the <a href=\"http://www.lejdd.fr/Jo-Londres-2012/Actualite/Boris-Johnson-a-regale-les-Britanniques-des-ses-bons-mots-pendants-les-JO-542140\" title=\"\">Journal du Dimanche</a>, marvelling at a \"Viking-like\" buffoon-politician the paper felt managed to make the most out of every appearance, including his five minutes hanging from a zipwire.</p>",
  "<p>For the most part, it's illegal to sell your body in Britain. But, in fact, there are various legal ways human body parts can be sold that don't involve waking up in a bath of ice with a kidney missing. In a research experiment, I tried to see <a href=\"http://www.channel4.com/programmes/whats-my-body-worth\" title=\"\">how much of the human body can lawfully be put up for sale</a>: by trying to sell as much of my own body as I could. It turns out pretty much everything God gave us can be sold.</p> <p>Why would I do this? Body parts are sold on the black market because there's often a genuine medical need. This year, 1,000 people in the UK will die on the organ transplant list. Couples unable to conceive wait years for donations of egg or sperm. Some doctors argue that a legal market for life-giving body parts should to be created in order to increase donations. But there are enormous ethical concerns and so far the government has refused to allow any kind of financial incentive for donors, apart from allowing some expenses. I investigated whether the law is hindering a legitimate market, firstly looking at what's already on sale here in Britain \u2013 and whether the price is reasonable.</p> <p>Sex is the most obvious thing to sell. While I wasn't prepared to prostitute myself, I \"rented\" my body out as a lapdancer. Working at a London strip joint, I found that pole dances are given away for free, but nude lapdances start at \u00a320. The sales pitch to prospective dancers is that you can earn \u00a31,000 a night \u2013 but it turns out this kind of money is a rarity. Lapdancers only make such amounts if get a customer to hire them by the hour. For that you earn \u00a3500 \u2013 but the club takes 20%. On top of that, they'll take a \u00a3100 fee from dancers just for showing up.</p> <p>So I tried to sell my hair. I was quoted \u00a350 by a hairdresser in London that specialises in harvesting human hair to make wigs for chemotherapy patients. I was hoping they'd offer me considerably more, given that wigs can sell for \u00a31,000.</p> <p>The British pharmaceutical industry uses many bodily fluids to test new drugs, and I was hopeful for a decent sale upon learning they pay up to \u00a31,750 for 1ml of blister fluid, \u00a31,000 for a cup of saliva and \u00a31,600 for a gram of earwax. But the prices are paid to intermediaries, \"virtual tissuebanks\" who source samples from around the world. Strictly speaking, the money isn't for the tissue itself, it's for refrigeration, licence fees and research, but given companies are for-profit I was sure some money should go to donors. The best offer I got was \u00a330 for some blood. Another clinic would have paid me \u00a350 for some skin \u2013 if I had psoriasis. However, every clinic told me that officially money is only \"compensation for my time\" because the law in the UK is so strict about selling any body parts. In Britain, it's not donors who are making the money.</p> <p>A decent earner turned out to be an auction website for people who buy bodily fluids for sexual purposes: imagine eBay, but for fetishists. Here, one can sell anything. Human urine is about \u00a330 a pot, breast milk \u00a35, even fingernails and faeces do their own roaring trade. One man offered me \u00a31,000 a year for manicure videos.</p> <p>It's paradoxical that it's possible to sell one's body for a variety of \"specialised\" purposes, and yet it's virtually impossible to do so for legitimate reasons, such as for medical research. Many in the pharmaceutical industry are hugely critical of the Human Tissue Act which governs what's permissible to sell for medical purposes. They say it's unfeasible for companies to recruit donors in Britain, and so they're forced to import tissue from overseas, notably American biobank repositories.</p> <p>My most valuable sale item was eggs. In the UK, they only allow donors \u00a3750 compensation, which means almost no donors come forward \u2013 and many desperate prospective parents are driven overseas to buy eggs. But in the US, thousands of women sell eggs \u2013 it's a mainstream market.</p> <p>One egg broker agreed to fly me to California for retrieval. It's a fiercely competitive industry, egg-selling, and only the best-looking and most intelligent women get top dollar \u2013 up to $15,000. Unfortunately, because I'm 32 years old, I was told my eggs aren't worth much and I'd \"only\" receive $5,500. As I was handed a giant box of hormones with which to inject myself, I came to a belated realisation that perhaps the price wasn't worth it. It's troubling that the trade targets very young women, many of whom don't think through the psychological implications of doing this.</p> <p>The greatest irony of all, is that my body is undoubtedly worth more dead than alive. In America, once a cadaver has been disarticulated into about 60 different tissues, the body parts are processed and made into medical products, which together are worth up to $250,000 on the open market. Some companies are listed on major stock exchanges \u2013 this is no niche market.</p> <p>So by the end of my experiment, I saw some dizzying prices, but didn't end up with much in my wallet. While it's ridiculous that people who are willing to donate bodily fluids as harmless as urine and saliva for crucial medical cannot be paid, I did end up coming around to the old-fashioned idea that altruism must drive any decision to donate. Women who donate eggs, or those who choose to give away a kidney must not be coerced by money to meet their bills. I don't know the answer to the UK's terrible shortage in eggs or kidneys, but I do know that the answer is not in writing a giant cheque.</p> <p>\u2022 Storm Theunissen's documentary film, <a href=\"http://www.channel4.com/programmes/whats-my-body-worth\" title=\"\">What's My Body Worth?</a>, is on More4 at 10pm, tonight, Monday 13 August</p>",

The decision came after months of political wrangling which came to a head in June when two boats carrying refugees <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/jun/21/boat-capsizes-christmas-island\" title=\"\">capsized north of Christmas Island</a> within a week of each other, killing at least 90 people.</p> <p>Gillard, like the centre-right opposition Liberal party, argued that refugees should be processed offshore, but the two main parties disagreed about the location. The Labor party wanted to send asylum seekers to Malaysia as part of a swap deal in which Australia would resettle bona fide refugees. But without a majority in parliament \u2013 and lacking the support of the Greens (who hold the balance of power and oppose offshore processing), Gillard was unable to get the required legislation through parliament.</p> <p>On Monday Gillard said her government had accepted the recommendations of the expert panel convened six weeks ago to find a political solution. \"What this report is calling on parliamentarians to do is to compromise and to act. This report is telling us not to stay in our fixed positions but to act and get things done,\" she said. \"When our nation looks at what is happening at sea, too many lives have been lost.\"</p> <p>The announcement drew immediate condemnation from human rights groups. Pamela Curr, of the Asylum Seeker Resource Centre, described the report as \"a comprehensive package of harm\".</p> <p>\"People will still drown. What this [report] is making sure is that people drown elsewhere and don't drown right in front of us,\" she said.</p> <p>More than 600 refugees have drowned in the past three years. The panel recommended refugees be sent to Nauru and Manus Island for processing to deter others considering undertaking the dangerous voyage to Australia. \"We recommend a policy approach that is hard-headed but not hard-hearted. That is realistic not idealistic. That is driven by a sense of humanity as well as fairness,\" said the panel's chair, Angus Houston, a former air chief marshal.</p> <p>The panel recommended that the changes to asylum policy should be part of a comprehensive regional framework that could later include Malaysia, provided safeguards and accountability measures governing the agreement with Kuala Lumpur could be strengthened.</p> <p>It said that the government should apply the principle of \"no advantage\" to ensure that no benefit was gained through \"circumventing regular migration arrangements\". Gillard said: \"You need to equalise treatment for asylum seekers so you don't get a better deal if you get on a boat.\"</p> <p>The panel also recommended increasing Australia's humanitarian intake from 13,750 a year to 20,000, rising to 27,000 over five years, as an incentive for refugees to apply through regular immigration channels. Turning back asylum boats to where they came from was not a safe option at the moment, it said.</p> <p>Human rights groups said the recommendations were in breach of Australia's international legal obligations.</p> <p>\"Penalising people based on their mode of arrival is clearly in breach of [Australia's] obligations,\" Graham Thom, of Amnesty International, told ABC television. \"We are only talking about people who come by boat, we're not talking about the thousands of people who come by plane and seek asylum in this country. What we are doing is penalising one particular group and actually taking them to a very remote place where we know they've been damaged in the past and holding them hostage to stop other people from coming.\"</p> <p>Pamela Curr, of the Asylum Seeker Resource Centre, described the report as \"a comprehensive package of harm\".</p> <p>\"People will still drown. What this [report] is making sure is that people drown elsewhere and don't drown right in front of us,\" she said.</p> <p>The UNHCR said it would need to study in more detail the proposals for offshore processing in Nauru and Papua New Guinea. \"The efficacy and integrity of such proposals will need to be assessed against their ability to deliver effective protection outcomes to refugees identified as needing protection under international law, not least through the 1951 refugee convention to which Australia is a party,\" it said in a statement.</p> <p>The Liberal opposition spokesman on immigration, Scott Morrison, said the panel's findings amounted to an endorsement of his party's policies and gave the government \"the opportunity to fix the mess they've made\" by resuming the previous Conservative government's policy of offshore processing.</p> <p>Former Liberal prime minister John Howard set up detention centres on Manus Island and in Nauru. Manus Island was closed in 2004, while former Labor prime minister Kevin Rudd shut down the Nauru detention centre soon after he won power in late 2007.</p> <p>The Greens welcomed the recommendation of increasing the number of humanitarian places, but condemned offshore processing. \"This is about a policy that strips out legal protections in Australian law,\" said the party's leader, Christine Milne. The Greens would not be party to something that was \"cruel to people\" and \"sets up a chain of detention centres right across the Pacific\", she said.</p> <p>This month 650 refugees have been picked up trying to reach Australia by boat. The annual number of arrivals by boat represents about 2% of Australia's total migration.</p>",
  "<p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/universal-pictures\" title=\"\">Universal</a> was clever to keep the Bourne name in the title of the fourth instalment in the franchise.

However, the essence of Bourne hangs over this excellent new story director by franchise screenwriter <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0006904/\" title=\"\">Tony Gilroy</a>, who has taken a more expansive look at the spy world created by <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/2001/mar/14/guardianobituaries.books\" title=\"\">Robert Ludlum</a>.</p> <p>The new protagonist Aaron Cross, like Bourne, is also the product of a shadowy spy project and \u2013 here's the killer \u2013 he's portrayed by one of the most exciting actors on the rise today. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2012/aug/11/bourne-legacy-jeremy-renner\" title=\"\">Jeremy Renner</a> is no spring chicken at 41 but ever since his stunning performance in <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/130570/hurt-locker\" title=\"\">The Hurt Locker</a>, he's been gathering momentum on the fringes.

The effect of both roles has been to allow Renner to percolate into the collective psyche. As a result I reckon most moviegoers heading in to The Bourne Legacy will have had a hunch who he was but wouldn't have been able to put a name to the face. After watching this movie they will.</p> <p>The $40.3m (\u00a326m) opening weekend may be the second lowest in the franchise precisely because of the unfamiliarity factor, but strong word of mouth will allow The Bourne Legacy to stick around in the coming weeks. It won't reach the $227m scored by <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/119889/bourne.ultimatum\" title=\"\">Ultimatum</a> (2007) or the $176m posted by <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/101541/bourne.supremacy\" title=\"\">Supremacy</a> (2004), but episode four does indeed represent a new hope and should have the chops to overtake the $122m final gross of Identity, the first in the series back in 2002.</p> <p>It's a tricky thing to change direction in the middle of a franchise but kudos to Universal for having the guts to go with an actor who is not yet a household name. The one-shot in the US advertising materials was smartly done. Renner stands gun in hand as an overlay of black and grey horizontal panels partly obscures his face and torso. The title stacks up in the bottom left of the image, strong enough to stand out and remind audiences of the franchise. The effect is that, at a glance, you might think it's Damon in the picture. Closer inspection reveals the identity of the new actor and this goes hand-in-hand with the tagline: There was never just one. It's skillfully done and understated, rather like the tone of the franchise.</p> <p>Casting Will Ferrell and Zach Galifianakis in a comedy about rival political contenders sounds like timely stuff in this election year and by many accounts <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1790886/\" title=\"\">The Campaign</a> is pretty funny. The Warner Bros comedy opened in second place on a highly creditable $27.4m. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/141046/dark-knight-rises\" title=\"\">The Dark Knight Rises</a> was dethroned after four weeks but it's done well and sits on the cusp of $400m in the US and $850m worldwide.</p> <p>Far more interesting is how <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1535438/\" title=\"\">Hope Springs</a> will play out. Sony's \"dramedy\" reunites Meryl Streep with David Frankel, who directed her in <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/113237/devil.wears.prada\" title=\"\">The Devil Wears Prada</a>. Streep and Tommy Lee Jones tread carefully as a sexless couple who undergo marriage counselling. Steve Carell is the sympathetic relationship guru.</p> <p>Hope Springs has grossed $20m after five days, which isn't half bad considering the subject matter. It would appear to be a pet project for studio head Amy Pascal given the lack of easy sell, so it's hard to predict which way it will go. The under-50s will have little to do with it, so all eyes will be on the older demographic. The movie arrives with awards potential and in a season that upon first glance might not be as strong for women as last year: Streep \u2013 the Eternal Contender (and current best lead actress Oscar holder for The Iron Lady) \u2013 could be back in contention again.</p> <p><strong>North American top 10, 10-12 Aug 2012</strong></p> <p><strong>1</strong> <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/147726/bourne-legacy\" title=\"\">The Bourne Legacy</a>, $40.3m</p> <p><strong>2</strong> The Campaign, $27.4m</p> <p><strong>3</strong> <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/141046/dark-knight-rises\" title=\"\">The Dark Knight Rises</a>, $19.5m.

We have identified spending of around \u00a311bn - which is essentially the government's \u00a39bn plus Locog's published budget of \u00a32bn. Locog will not publish any details until after the games themselves, so we have divided up its funding using what we know, which is that Locog is paying for half the budget for ceremonies, half the budget for the paralympics and, obviously, the cost of running the events themselves.</p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/datablog/2012/jul/26/london-2012-olympics-money\">Read more</a></p> <h2>8.

How the Olympics - and Britain - changed since the 1908 games</a></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-394740173\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/7/9/1341829479878/olympics-poster460.gif\" alt=\"1908 Olympic fencing poster\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">1908 Olympic fencing poster</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: guardian.co.uk</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>London was the first city ever to have hosted three Olympics. In 1908, at the height of the British empire, it was a last-minute choice, stepping in for Rome after the eruption of Mount Vesuvius. In 1948, Germany and Japan were banned following their wartime defeat, the Soviet Union was absent and this was the 'austerity Olympics' in a broke country. So, how does 2012 compare?</p> <p>The House of Commons Library, the team which usually supplies MPs with the answers to tricky research questions, is publishing the ultimate statistical guide to how Britain, London and the Olympic games themselves have changed. Olympic Britain, out today, charts how the world the Olympians of 1908 knew would seem unrecogniseable today. And how we got there.</p> <p>In 1908, the first modern Olympics of 1896 were still a live memory, and this was quite a different world. The majority of the competitors came from the imperial empires of Britain, Russia, Germany, the Austro-Hungarians and France, plus the new power: America. The five rings of the Olympic symbol weren't invented until Baron Pierre De Coubertin presented it to the world in 1914.</p> <p>Although the colonies were allowed to participate, it was hardly encouraged for fear it would lead to national identity and undermine their European masters. Two indigenous Africans from South Africa had been allowed to compete in the St Louis games of 1904, featuring in 'athletic games for savages', although they were allowed to enter the marathon, finishing ninth and twelfth out of 36. It wasn't until 1952 that any other sub Saharan country participated, Ghana, although it didn't win a medal until Clement Quartey won a boxing silver in 1960.</p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/datablog/2012/jul/10/london-olympic-charts-medals-competitors\">Read more</a></p> <h2>11.

It's more than just reporting results.</p> <p>And, as the games developed, the big questions of the day became around how to interpret the stream of numbers emanating from Stratford's Olympic Park and venues around the region. It became less about using other people's data and generating our own. </p> <p>As soon as the 8,000 runners started carrying the Olympic torch around the country, data journalists started working at breaking down the numbers behind the news. This investigation by <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/datablog/2012/jul/26/olympic-torch-relay-places\">Help Me Investigate and published not he Datablog</a>, for instance, looked into the hundreds of 'ghost runners', who weren't on the official list but were instead placed there by sponsors. The 25% of places outside of public nomination campaigns were allocated through internal processes at commercial partners, the International Olympic Committee, sporting bodies, direct invitation from Locog, and the relay's sponsors - one of whom allocated 15% of its 1,360 places for its own staff. Some data on places is still missing.</p> <p>The fact that this information was closed and required a major investigative effort reflects a lot of what we know about the Olympics: the stuff you really want to know isn't necessarily the information that's open and published freely. It's much more likely to be hidden right around the corner. </p> <p>And if data journalism is about anything, it's about turning that corner and telling that story.</p> <h2>More data</h2> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/data\">More data journalism and data visualisations from the Guardian</a></p> <h2>World government data</h2> <p></p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world-government-data\">Search the world's government data with our gateway</a></p> <h2>Development and aid data</h2> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/data-store/global-development-data/search?q=\">Search the world's global development data with our gateway</a></p> <h2>Can you do something with this data?</h2> <p>\u2022 <strong>Flickr</strong> Please post your visualisations and mash-ups on our <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/groups/1115946@N24/\">Flickr group</a><br>\u2022&#xa0;Contact us at <a href=\"mailto:data@guardian.co.uk\">data@guardian.co.uk</a></p> <p><strong>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/page/2009/jun/17/1\">Get the A-Z of data</a><br>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/data-store\">More at the Datastore directory</a></strong><br><strong>\u2022 <a href=\"http://twitter.com/guardiandata\">Follow us on Twitter</a><br>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/pages/Guardian-data/155291341187950\">Like us on Facebook</a></strong></p>",
  "<p>It is one of the sunniest days of the year in Oldham and the Baptist chapel is packed as the weekly <a href=\"http://www.oldhambaptist.org.uk/about/about.shtml?/about/Welcome_project.htm\">Oldham Unity Destitution Project</a> gets going. In the kitchen older local women and two, young, brightly-dressed Muslim girls are serving hot food and drinks. In the main hall people from many different countries are sitting at tables enjoying the food and, of course, cups of tea. In the creche the children are playing, whilst their parents are selecting from the tables of food that stretch across three of the walls. </p> <p>The Olham Unity Destitution Project started after the street violence in the town nine years ago as a befriending project, since when it has expanded to provide a vital service for the growing destitute community in the Oldham area. Every week without fail it gives a food parcel worth \u00a36.50 to at least 50 destitute refugees. This consists of basics such as rice, lentils and tins of tomatoes. </p> <p>Stewart Bailey, secretary of the group, tells me that the project responds to a humanitarian need:</p> <blockquote> <p>Destitution affects people who have fled conflict in countries including Iran, Iraq, Afghanistan and Palestine, to mention just a few. Many are traumatised and have to prove their refugee status. They often fail due to personal factors such as trauma and a lack of easy proof, as well as not being able to access legal support. Whilst in this process the government supports them with housing and a small amount of money. But once they are deemed not to be eligible as refugees, they have all their housing and money withdrawn and become destitute. Even if they want to appeal, it is difficult because of the changes in legal aid to get solicitors to take up the case, while dedicated services such as Oldham Law Centre have now closed.</p> </blockquote> <p>Even for people who decide that they are prepared to go back to their home country, things are not straightforward as Stewart explains:</p> <blockquote> <p>These people can apply for Section 4 funding which will provide financial support whilst they are waiting to return home. But not everyone is accepted and some countries such as Iran will not accept them back anyway.</p> </blockquote> <p>The Red Cross attend the project each week and check people's eligibility for destitution support. They are able to give limited financial help for the first year. After that the project, which is not a charity, has to meet its own costs, raised by regular appeals.</p> <p>The centre is run entirely by volunteers. As Stewart says:</p> <blockquote> <p>People get involved because of their philosophical or political views. We range from Marxists to Methodists. Many local faith groups provide support, including the Baptist church who provide a city centre venue. Other churches provide weekly food collections while the Pakistani community provide storage for our food.</p> </blockquote> <p><br>On the day I was there,during Ramadan, Islamic charities had provided bags of food including fresh meat, a rare treat for the recipients as the project has no cold storage facilities.</p> <p>The centre has built up good local links with NHS services. Local medical and dental practices will register people and accept the Baptist chapel as an address. Many of the refugees come from war-torn countries and need counselling and so the project refers them to the Freedom from Torture service. </p> <p>One of the people using the project when I visited was Ali, a young Kurdish man who had fled Iran due to his political activity. He told me his story:</p> <blockquote> <p>I came from Iran nine months ago and applied for asylum. They rejected my claim and now I have no housing or money. I come to the project for food and clothes. In Iran I was a football player and I want to get back into this. </p> </blockquote> <p><br>Mike Luft, one of the volunteers, has been helping Ali to link up with local team <a href=\"http://www.fc-utd.co.uk\">FC United</a>.</p> <blockquote> <p>They have been very positive in supporting some of our young men. It's not just about giving them food and clothing, its about helping them to join the society we are all part of. </p> </blockquote> <p><br>Mike and his wife Heather provided practical support by taking Ali to the sports training ground so that he can join the weekly training group.</p> <p>Robin Pye, who co-ordinates the community and education work at FC United, explains their work with asylum seekers and refugees. </p> <blockquote> <p>FC United want to benefit the community we serve so we provide support to groups that have differing needs, including unemployed young men as well as asylum seekers. We recognise their particular problems of loneliness and extreme poverty.We offer sports training as a way for them to integrate into life in Manchester. Football has an international language and can help these young people by getting them involved in the sport and making friends.</p> </blockquote> <p>Stewart says that the project is:</p> <blockquote> <p>Community cohesion at its best. We work from the basis that these people are homeless and hungry, and ask the question; what can we do about it? </p> </blockquote> <p><br><em>The project is happy to accept donations of food, clothes and money, please contact stewartbailey1943@hotmail.co.uk </em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-394636359\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/4/27/1335515878833/Bernadette-Hyland-001.jpg\" alt=\"Bernadette Hyland\" width=\"140\" height=\"130\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bernadette Hyland Photograph: Bernadette Hyland</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bernadette Hyland</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><br><em>Bernadette Hyland is a <a href=\"http://lipsticksocialist.wordpress.com/\">freelance writer and blogger.</a> She is active in her trade union, <a href=\"http://www.unitetheunion.org/\">Unite </a>, and volunteers at the <a href=\"http://www.wcml.org.uk/\">Working Class Movement Library</a> in Salford.</em></p>",

The prospects of building a far larger ground in London are always disheartening. Queens Park Rangers, however, are at least undaunted.</p> <p>Philip Beard, the chief executive, contrived to be chirpy when reflecting on the fact that it would take five years at the very least to bring into being a new home with 45,000 seats. \"That gives us the time to cultivate the brand and the support of QPR,\" he declared.</p> <p>In practice, an impressive ground might be the quickest way of all to increase attendances substantially. As Beard appreciates, though, there are no swift or easy means to create large football facilities in London. QPR should at least be encouraged that they are likely to have a modern training centre at Warren Farm next season.</p> <p>A stadium is a much more troubling topic. Even Roman Abramovich must be getting downcast as he ponders the challenge of giving Chelsea a ground with a greater capacity than the current 42,000 at Stamford Bridge.</p> <p>Realism is unavoidable at QPR. Tony Fernandes, the majority shareholder in the club since last year, has business acumen and a sense of caution. \"I think it's important not just to throw money at the game,\" he said. That calmness, all the same, does not mean that he is passive.</p> <p>Neil Warnock took QPR into the Premier League last year. \"He's a special guy, we're very happy with him,\" Fernandes said at the time.</p> <p>The contentment did not last when Warnock went eight games without a win in the league. He was sacked in January. His replacement Mark Hughes did enough to keep QPR in the top flight.</p> <p>There has been a sensible craving for security after the team conceded 66 goals in the Premier League season, with only the relegated clubs doing worse. The goalkeeper Rob Green has joined after leaving West Ham. Ryan Nelsen saw little action after a move from Blackburn Rovers to Tottenham Hotspur in January, but Hughes may feel that the know-how of a 34-year-old has a higher value for QPR.</p> <p>No one at least can accuse the club of delusions. Little cash, for instance, has changed hands so far in the close season. Park Ji-sung has joined from Manchester United with the initial fee reported to be \u00a32m. It is scarcely an eye-catching sum and the midfielder is 31, but his consistency and general ability were appreciated at Old Trafford. Another United player, the full-back F\u00e1bio da Silva, has arrived on loan.</p> <p>Although it makes sense to deal in well-known quantities, there is also a need to bring some vivacity to the team and there has been a breadth to Hughes's acquisitions. Junior Hoilett, who left Blackburn Rovers at the end of his contract, has it in him to beat opponents and bring some extra liveliness to QPR's approach. The Canadian was in the Ewood Park youth programme from the age of 13.</p> <p>Hughes, as Blackburn manager, overlapped with Hoilett for a year and would had a sense of the player's potential even if the youngster was out on loan to the German club Paderborn. That sort of familiarity is even more marked in the case of Nelsen, whose long stay at Blackburn included three full seasons under the management of Hughes.</p> <p>There are assets at Loftus Road and Joey Barton could be numbered among them were it not for the fact that his career is being swamped by controversies. The midfielder was sent off at Manchester City at the close of last season with mayhem breaking out once he had been shown the red card. That did not merely help the hosts take the title.</p> <p>His misconduct led to a 12-match ban and, of late, he has made pre-season appearances for Fleetwood Town to recover match fitness.</p> <p>His omission from QPR's's pre-season tour to Malaysia could well be interpreted as a form of exclusion, but it would hardly have made practical sense for the club to involve a player who could not be considered for selection once the real season is in progress. There had been briefly been talk of the club cancelling his contract although that did not appear feasible in reality.</p> <p>The club, after all, did value a footballer who had come to them after four years with Newcastle United. Barton started 31 of QPR's league matches last season. It is obvious that there will be a reluctance even to try and rehabilitate him but professional sport normally deals in practicalities. The 29-year-old may yet re-emerge.</p>",

  "<p>Stuart Hazell, the man accused of murdering the missing schoolgirl Tia Sharp is to appear in court .</p> <p>Hazell, 37, will appear via videolink at Camberwell Green magistrates' court charged with the murder of 12-year-old Tia, who was missing for a week before her body was discovered in her grandmother's house in New Addington, south-east London, last Friday.</p> <p>Tensions in the community of New Addington are running high as the investigation into the murder continues.</p> <p>Hazell was charged in the early hours of Sunday morning with the murder of the 12-year-old, who was last seen on Friday 3 August at the house Hazell shared with her grandmother, Christine Sharp, 46.</p> <p>Sharp, who was also arrested on suspicion of murder, has been released on police bail. She has not been charged.</p> <p>Natalie Sharp, 30, Tia's mother, and the girl's biological father, Steven Carter, visited the rapidly expanding shrine on Sunday. The child's mother left an orchid, a teddy bear, and a card that read: \"Our baby girl, we love you very much, always will. Sorry baby that this should have happened. I wish I was there to protect you. We know you're safe now and you are home with us everywhere we go.\"</p> <p>Paul Meehan, 39, a neighbour, was arrested on suspicion of aiding an offender and has also been released on police bail. He has not been charged.</p> <p>No formal identification of the body found at 20 The Lindens, on the New Addington estate near Croydon, south-east London, has been made but Scotland Yard said the victim was named in the murder charge as Tia Sharp.</p> <p>The postmortem investigation, which was halted Saturday evening, was expected to resume on Sunday to provide more details of how the child died. It was likely to continue some time in the coming week, Scotland Yard said, adding that the decision on when to restart would be left to the pathologist.</p> <p>More than 80 officers were involved in the search for Tia after her mother reported her missing on 3 August. But it took four searches of her grandmother's home before officers found her.</p> <p>Scotland Yard has admitted that due to human error a specialist search team did not discover the body in the early hours of last Sunday morning when they examined the house; the search included the location where Tia was later discovered, which is understood to be the loft.</p> <p>It was only when another full forensic examination was carried out on Friday afternoon that the body was found, and the hunt for Hazell began. He was arrested at 8.25pm in Merton, after he was spotted by several members of the public.</p> <p>Scotland Yard has publicly admitting its failings over the search of Christine Sharp's home. Commander Neil Basu apologised to Natalie Sharp for the length of time it took to find her daughter's body. He said the force was doing a \"review and examination\" of its search processes to ensure such errors were not repeated. Over the weekend Basu gave more details of the three failed searches over the last week.</p> <p>Basu said: \"It is important that we explain more about the circumstances of the searches. Four scene examinations were conducted of the property. The first followed immediately from the missing person report that was received on Friday 3 August. An initial visit was made to assess the situation and examine the property. This visit was not regarded or viewed as a full search of the property.</p> <p>\"The second visit was a full search of the property with the consent of the occupiers. This was [on] 5 August over a period of two hours. All parts of the premises were searched including the location where a body was discovered, five days later, on Friday 10 August. An early review has been conducted and it is now clear that human error delayed the discovery of the body within the house.\"</p> <p>The Met said on Sunday it had not referred the inquiry to the Independent Police Complaints Commission. It is understood the IPCC has decided not to hold informal talks with the Met about the failures identified during the searches, and that the Met search team was led by a trained police search adviser.</p> <p>Hundreds of floral tributes, teddy bears and cards have been left outside the New Addington property where Tia stayed at weekends and during school holidays with her grandmother.</p> <p>Janette Dixon, 52, who left a teddy bear at the memorial, said: \"It's heartbreaking. I have got four grandchildren of my own and the idea that something like this could happen is just devastating. The whole community was out searching for her, all day and everyday, but she was in that house all the time. It is unbelievable.\"</p> <p>Collette O'Brien said she felt guilty because the community had failed to find Tia. Laying two bunches of white flowers, she said: \"I wanted to bring my daughters to pay our respects. It is hard to put into words. We all tried to find her but it appears she was in that house all the time. It is just heartbreaking. I feel this awful sense of guilt that I couldn't have done more.\"</p>",
  "<p>A panel of experts set up to advise the Australian government how to deal with refugees who arrive by boat has recommended they be processed offshore in a third country, prompting condemnation from legal and human rights groups.</p> <p>The panel recommended refugees be sent to the Pacific island of Nauru and to Papua New Guinea's Manus Island for processing as a disincentive to others considering undertaking the dangerous voyage to Australia.</p> <p>\"We recommend a policy approach that is hard-headed but not hard-hearted. That is realistic not idealistic. That is driven by a sense of humanity as well as fairness,\" said the panel's chair, retired Air Chief Marshall Angus Houston.</p> <p>The panel recommended that the changes to asylum policy be part of a \"comprehensive regional framework\", which could later include Malaysia, provided that safeguards and accountability measures governing the current agreement with Kuala Lumpur could be strengthened.</p> <p>The panel also recommended increasing Australia's humanitarian intake from 13,750 a year to 20,000 (rising to 27,000 over five years), as an incentive for refugees to apply through regular immigration channels.</p> <p>Turning back asylum boats to where they came from was not a safe option at the moment, it said.</p> <p>Human rights groups have condemned the recommendations as being in breach of Australia's obligations under the refugee convention.</p> <p>\"Penalising people based on their mode of arrival is clearly in breach of our obligations,\" Graham Thom, of Amnesty International, told ABC television.</p> <p>\"We are only talking about people who come by boat, we're not talking about the thousands of people who come by plane and seek asylum in this country. What we are doing is penalising one particular group and actually taking them to a very remote place where we know they've been damaged in the past and holding them hostage to stop other people from coming,\" he said.</p> <p>Pamela Curr, of the Asylum Seeker Resource Centre, described the report as \"a comprehensive package of harm\".</p> <p>\"People will still drown. What this [report] is making sure is that people drown elsewhere and don't drown right in front of us,\" she said.</p> <p>The Labor party caucus is reviewing the recommendations but the conservative opposition party welcomed the panel's findings, saying they endorsed its long-standing policy. The opposition spokesman on immigration, Scott Morrison, said the panel's report gave the government \"the opportunity to fix the mess they've created\" by resuming the previous conservative government's policy of offshore processing.</p> <p>The Greens, who hold the balance of power in parliament, welcomed the recommendation of increasing the number of humanitarian places for refugees, but condemned offshore processing.</p> <p>\"This is about a policy that strips out legal protections in Australian law,\" said the party's leader, Christine Milne. She said the Greens would not be party to something that was \"cruel to people\" and \"sets up a chain of detention centres right across the Pacific\".</p> <p>The panel was set up six weeks ago after parliament failed to reach agreement on the offshore processing of refugees (the policy of both major parties) following the sinking of two refugee boats in a week between Indonesia and Australia's Christmas Island.</p> <p>Six hundred and fifty refugees trying to reach Australia by boat have been picked up this month. Over the past three years, 600 others have died at sea.</p>",
  "<h2>Winning tip: Gallipoli old town<br></h2> <p>You cross a narrow causeway to reach this island-like old town. Climb up the steps and take a circular walk, looking down to the sandy beaches backed by distinctive umbrella pines. For respite from the heat, descend to the Frantoio Ipogeo at Via Antonietta de Pace, one of many olive oil presses buried in the rock below the streets.

The sea is warm and turquoise and there is this secret to be discovered: 50m offshore, just below the surface, lies a wrecked ship, sunk by the British navy in 1941.

But when the doors opened, Palazzo Siena was revealed in all its glory. New this summer, it's a family-run boutique B&amp;B and a food and design haven. The owner has decorated the hotel in an Italian old-fashioned style with modern accessories. The patio has a beautiful sea water pool. Food includes typical Puglian treats such as Friselle bread with olive oil, oregano and tomatoes. The eight rooms are spacious and comfortable and there's not a sound from the street.

Dish after dish appears: blanched chicory in white bean pur\u00e9e (we were shown by a kindly waitress how to blend it with olive oil and crumbly fried bread); home-made oreccheitte with greens; potatoes baked with mussels and cheese.

One of the best lunches we've ever had.<br><em>+39 0832 245178,</em><a href=\"http://www.lezie.it/\" title=\"\"><em> lezie.it</em></a><br><strong>helenmb</strong></p> <h2>Al Trabucco da Mimi, Peschici</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-394508299\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/pictures/2012/4/11/1334155807745/Il-Trabucco-Peschici-008.jpg\" alt=\"Il Trabucco, Peschici\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Il Trabucco, Peschici</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This a lovely restaurant set near the gorgeous village of Peschici (at Punta San Nicola) has a beautiful view of the bay, and sunset if you go there for dinner. The <em>trabucco</em> is an old fishing structure typical of the Gargano. This restaurant offers fresh fish and is a great place to end a hard day at the beach. Finish off with a gelato in Peschici town.<br><em>+39 0884 962556, </em><a href=\"http://www.altrabucco.it/\" title=\"\"><em>altrabucco.it</em></a><br><strong>shyamall</strong></p> <h2>Ostuni</h2> <p>Ostuni is a city of white buildings on a hill that looks stunning as you drive up the winding roads to get to it. Itdoes not seem to cater to foreign tourists so there are plenty of opportunities to practise Italian. In restaurants children will get smiles from servers and special suggestions about what to eat on the menu of wonderful tasting food at very reasonable prices. Ostuni is a solid base from which to experience Italy with the family and for fewer euros than more popular Italian destinations.<br><strong>2boysmum</strong></p> <h2>Masseria Fumarola</h2> <p>The Masseria Fumarola is a farmhouse converted into a beautiful boutique hotel. Every room is unique, the outside space is fantastic, from a drink on the terrace, alfresco eating, to the beautiful pool and the surrounding fields. But most importantly, the food there is divine, from the breakfasts, which I still dream (try the carrot cake) to the best ever antipasti buffet I've ever seen. <br><em>+39 0804 303722, </em><a href=\"http://masseriafumarola.it\" title=\"\"><em>masseriafumarola.it</em></a><br><strong>treacle75</strong></p> <h2><strong>Porto Selvaggio nature reserve</strong><br></h2> <p>This is a stunning and enchanting natural park in the Salento area, a protected area of very wild and luxuriant pinewood that leads, after a 20 minute walk, to an amazing little creek surrounded by white rocks. The water is crystal clear and the surroundings do not get too busy so it is the perfect place to relax having a bit of privacy. There are several trekking paths, some quite challenging, that lead to other areas such as the Uluzzo tower and the Grotta del Cavallo.<br><a href=\"http://www.portoselvaggio.net\" title=\"\"><em>portoselvaggio.net</em></a><br><strong>paduk</strong></p> <h2>Le Grotte de la Civita, Matera</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-394508300\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Observer/Columnist/Columnists/2012/8/8/1344444490266/Grotte-della-Civilta-001.jpg\" alt=\"Grotte della Civilta\" width=\"460\" height=\"277\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Grotte della Civilta</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A hotel in a cave! The Sassi in Matera is a Unesco world heritage site, a stunning collection of cliffside cave dwellings with ornate carved stone frontages. Best viewed from the ravine opposite the town, the scene is positively biblical. Mel Gibson used the Sassi as Jerusalem's double in The Passion of the Christ, but don't let that put you off. The area was run down and basically a slum until the 1970s, but in the past 10 years the unique charms of the Sassi are finally receiving their dues. Le Grotte della Civita is a boutique hotel where Philippe Starck bathtubs stand proudly in bare limestone caves, the sparseness of the setting uniquely romantic, artistic and beautiful. The breakfasts are delicious as well, and it's a brilliant spot from which to explore the region. <br><a href=\"http://www.i-escape.com/le-grotte-della-civita/overview\" title=\"\"><em>i-escape.com/le-grotte-della-civita</em></a><br><strong>embryo</strong></p> <h2>Ceglie Messapica</h2> <p>I thoroughly recommend picking one of the small, whitewashed hilltop towns in the beautiful Valle d'Itria area as a base. I happened to pick Ceglie Messapica, which is known for its excellent regional cuisine. It is less expensive than the better-known towns, such as Ostuni or Alberobello but close enough to explore a range of places like Martina Franca, Cisternino, Locorotondo, Ostuni and Alberobello, as well as the lovely and sandy Torre Canne beach. A car is essential and driving through ancient olive groves with dark red earth dotted with trulli is an absolute pleasure - but make sure you have a satnav!<br><a href=\"http://www.comune.ceglie-messapica.br.it/\" title=\"\"><em>comune.ceglie-messapica.br.it</em></a><br><strong>pugliamo</strong></p> <h2>Cisternino butchers</h2> <p>The butchers in this village are open well into the evening and they give you the option to choose the meat you like from their fridge. They will then cook it for you fresh and then serve it with chips, salad and regional wine. This is typical for the region but no tourists would know about it \u2013 I was shown this by a Pugliese friend.<br><strong>Georgia86</strong></p> <h2>Punta della Suina</h2> <p>There is something magical about beaches surrounded by pine forests, and Punta della Suina is one of these gems. The sea is classic Salento \u2013 calm and so transparent it's unreal. It has stunning views of historic Gallipoli, and not many Italians know of its existence. Avoid the lido (expensive and a tad loud) and walk until you find your very own spot \u2013 lie down and let the smell of the pines trees fill your lungs.<br><a href=\"http://puntadellasuina.it/\" title=\"\"><em>puntadellasuina.it</em></a><br><strong>danapt</strong></p> <h2>Bar del Moro, Torre San Gregorio<br></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-394508301\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Observer/Columnist/Columnists/2012/8/8/1344445216761/bar-del-moro-001.jpg\" alt=\"bar del moro\" width=\"460\" height=\"277\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">bar del moro</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This fantastic restaurant was recommended by an Italian friend from Lecce and it is wonderful. The outdoor terraces overlooking the Ionian Sea have a relaxed atmosphere and are busy with local and holidaying Italians. There is no written menu; the dishes comprise what is available daily - an array of delicious antipasti served tapas style, followed by a seafood pasta course, and if you have room, a fish course too. Portions are huge and tasty.<br><em>+39 0833 767842</em><br><strong>kbranford</strong></p>"
