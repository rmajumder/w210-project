[
  "<p>Paul Ryan, Mitt Romney's vice-presidential running-mate, will embark on the biggest challenge of his political career on Wednesday night, trying to sell his boss to the Republican convention and to millions more watching at home.</p> <p>Ryan, one of the great hopes of the Republican party, will deliver a primetime keynote speech designed to both bolster Romney and land punches on Barack Obama.</p> <p>He will focus on drawing sharp distinctions with Obama on economic policy, according to excerpts released in advance of the speech.</p> <p>Contrasting his joint Romney-Ryan economic plan to cut taxes and spending with what he described as the failure of Barack Obama's economic policies, he will say: \"We have a plan for a stronger middle class, with the goal of generating 12 million new jobs over the next four years.\"</p> <p>Ryan will not make the mistake of the keynote speaker on Tuesday night, New Jersey governor Chris Christie, who failed in his task of building up Romney. Christie was 17 minutes into his speech before mentioning Romney's name.</p> <p>\"Our nominee is sure ready,\" he will say of Romney. \"His whole life has prepared him for this moment \u2013 to meet serious challenges in a serious way, without excuses and idle words. After four years of getting the run-around, America needs a turnaround, and the man for the job is governor Mitt Romney.\"</p> <p>The Wisconsin congressman will also attack Obama's healthcare reforms, which have received little mention from the convention platform so far this week.</p> <p>\"Obamacare comes to more than two thousand pages of rules, mandates, taxes, fees, and fines that have no place in a free country,\" he will say. \"The president has declared that the debate over government-controlled health care is over. That will come as news to the millions of Americans who will elect Mitt Romney so we can repeal Obamacare.\"</p> <p>Much of the rest of Ryan's speech consists of warm but largely empty rhetoric. He will say the final months of the campaign for the White House would present a clear choice between the Romney-Ryan spending cuts plan and what he portrays as Obama's failed stimulus package.</p> <p>Delegates were looking to Ryan replicate the excitement created by the 2008 vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin \u2013 while avoiding the later pitfalls of her disastrous media appearances.</p> <p>Ryan, in the speech, will focus on presenting himself, as he has done throughout his political career, as a small-town, ordinary Joe, turning again, as he has in the past, to folksy language. \"My Dad used to say to me: 'Son. You have a choice: You can be part of the problem, or you can be part of the solution',\" Ryan said.</p> <p>He will be followed on Thursday night by Romney, who faces the most important speech of his political career when he addresses the convention. It is one of the last major opportunities for Romney, speaking to an estimated 50,000 in the hall and potentially more than 30 million at home, to break free from Obama after months in which the two have been tied in the polls.</p> <p>In the speech, Ryan criticises Obama's healthcare reforms, an economic plan to create 12 million new jobs over the next four years.</p> <p>The Obama campaign launched a pre-emptive strike before Ryan's convention speech, releasing a new video using black-and-white footage to highlight their contention that he is a throwback to a bygone era.</p> <p>The Obama campaign said: \"Paul Ryan has made it clear that he'll take the nation back to a very different era \u2013 including the same failed policies that crashed our economy in the first place.\"</p> <p>In the video, mocked up to look like newsreel from the 1940s and 1950s, the Obama campaign accuses him of supporting a budget that will hurt the working class, end the Medicare health scheme, and cut programmes for students. It also accuses him of being anti-women and anti-abortion.</p> <p>A Ryan spokesman, Brendan Buck, responding to claims in the video that Ryan would be disastrous for the working-class, accused Obama of \"tired and misleading attacks in an attempt to divert attention away from his failed record\".</p> <p>Romney, after arriving in Tampa on Tuesday, earlier than planned, flew on Wednesday to Indiana to address army veterans before returning to Florida. He said that he would rather address the veterans than polish his speech. His main thrust was to denounce planned cuts by Obama in the military budget.</p> <p>\"We are now just months away from an arbitrary, across-the-board budget reduction that would weaken the military with a trillion dollars in cuts, severely shrink our force structure, and impair our ability to meet and deter threats,\" Romney said. In spite of Republican efforts, the prospect of defence cuts has failed to take off as an election issue, in the main because the top concern of voters is unemployment.</p> <p>Condoleezza Rice, the secretary of state in the Bush administration, was the warm-up for Ryan. In a CBS interview on Wednesday, Rice said that Romney \u2013 unlike Obama \u2013 would lead from the front in world affairs, although Romney has had little to say about foreign policy so far.</p> <p>While Rice insisted she was not advocating intervention in Syria, she said: \"When the United States's voice is muted, the world is a more dangerous place \u2026 just look at the situation in Syria, for instance. We have a circumstance in which [Syrian president Bashar] Assad is butchering his people, the Iranians are helping him to do so, the United States seems to be mired in the security council, the Russians and the Chinese say, 'No, no, no,' and we don't seem to have an answer.\"</p> <p>Rice was adamant she would not take a role in a Romney cabinet, saying she intended to remain in the academic world.</p> <p>One of the biggest obstacles to Romney winning the presidency, in spite of widespread and deep dissatisfaction with Obama's handling of the economy, is the alienation of Latinos through his anti-immigration rhetoric. The Democrats enjoy a two-to-one advantage over the Republicans among Latinos, one of the fastest-growing groups.</p> <p>The former Republican governor of Florida, Jeb Bush, George's brother, and who is married to a Latino, expressed his frustration with his own party at a Hispanic outreach meeting in Tampa on Tuesday. He predicted the party will not close the gap with Latino voters until they \"stop acting stupid\".</p> <p>The Republican national committee also risked alienating floating voters by publishing as part of the convention its official programme a platform document setting out various policy goals such as a ban on all abortions, a ban on gay marriage, turning Medicare into a voucher scheme and introducing more tax cuts.</p> <p>Romney is not bound by the platform programme. His campaign, while saying it supports the Medicare reform and more tax cuts, favours exemptions from the abortion ban in cases of rape, incest and where there is risk to women's health.</p>",

Louisiana officials said they would intentionally breach a levee in Placquemines parish, south of New Orleans, as Isaac lumbered inland from the Gulf of Mexico.</p> <p>Authorities feared many residents would need help after a night of torrential rain and harsh winds knocked out power to more than 700,000 households and businesses.</p> <p>Isaac has top sustained winds of 70mph (112kph), just below the hurricane threshold of 74mph (119kph).</p> <p>Army Corps spokeswoman Rachel Rodi said the city's bigger, stronger levees were withstanding the assault. \"The system is performing as intended, as we expected,\" she said. \"We don't see any issues with the hurricane system at this point.\"</p> <p>New Orleans mayor Mitch Landrieu issued a curfew for the city. Police cars had been patrolling the nearly empty streets since Isaac began bringing fierce winds and heavy rains to the city Tuesday night.</p> <p>Rescuers in boats and trucks plucked a handful of people who became stranded by floodwaters in thinly populated areas of south-east Louisiana. Emergency officials in Plaquemines Parish said floodwaters had flowed over an 8ft levee between the Braithwaite and White Ditch districts. </p> <p>Authorities evacuated hundreds of families from Plaquemines on Wednesday afternoon amid fears of fresh flooding.</p> <p>Convoys of people clutching children, pets and bags streamed in driving rain down state highway 23 while a fleet of ambulances with blaring sirens headed in the opposite direction towards the Mississippi to aid people still in danger.</p> <p>A YMCA centre in Belle Chase, just south of New Orleans, became an improvised refugee station for 125 people after two other nearby shelters filled up.</p> <p>\"The waters had reached the seventh step of my porch and the lawmen told us we had to evacuate the premises,\" said Veraldine Garrison, 72, who arrived with four adult children.</p> <p>\"All we had was the wind and the rain. The wind and the rain.\" Like others, she feared for her home. \"There ain't nothing you can do with mother nature. You can't control that water.\"</p> <p>Beside her, huddled in a blanket, sat a woman rescued from her rooftop, too exhausted or traumatized to speak.</p> <p>Some evacuees complained they were forced to leave pets and valuables behind. \"My chihuahuas, Tiki and Tutu, are still in my trailer home,\" said Thomas Wyman, 80, slumped in a plastic chair. \"And my money, my medicine, it's all there.\"</p> <p>Jim Gabour, who lives in the Faubourg Marigny neighborhood of New Orleans, just next to the French Quarter, said that with electricity knocked out, trees downed and the wind still up, residents were in survivalist mode \u2013 and did not expect relief until the weekend.</p> <p>\"No electricity, no running water and 80mph gusts,\" Gabour wrote in an email on Wednesday. \"Right now, cutting trees off house in high winds and stinging rains. Cell batteries gone soon. Land lines not working.\"</p> <p>He added later: \"Generator too erratic for computer. No electricity, cable or land lines until weekend. Will have to turn off generator soon, and be in dark again, as we have to ration gas and no stations open. And it is suffocatingly hot.\"</p>",
  "<p>On 17 July, President Barack Obama spoke at a campaign rally in Roanoke, Virginia. It was a typical event for an incumbent president who is seeking a second term. <a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2012/07/13/remarks-president-campaign-event-roanoke-virginia\">In his remarks</a>, he offered his vision of government's role in spurring entrepreneurship and creating jobs in the United States:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"If you were successful, somebody along the line gave you some help. There was a great teacher somewhere in your life. Somebody helped to create this unbelievable American system that we have that allowed you to thrive. Somebody invested in roads and bridges. If you've got a business \u2013 you didn't build that.&#xa0;Somebody else made that happen. The internet didn't get invented on its own. Government research created the internet so that all the companies could make money off the internet.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>This is all fairly boilerplate rhetoric \u2013 a basic recitation of how Democrats view the role of government and its interplay with the private sector. But in this statement, there was one phrase that Republicans have grabbed on to like a famished dog with a new bone:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"You didn't build that.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>That single phrase, taken out of context by Republicans, has become the GOP's symbol of Obama's supposed contempt for the free market and entrepreneurship, and for his socialist assault on America. Sure, it's a <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/jul/26/mitt-romney/putting-mitt-romneys-attacks-you-didnt-build-truth/\">misleading lie</a> to cast it that way. But in the hands of Republicans intent on furthering their vision of the free market as a fragile institution whose success relies on as little interaction with the federal government as possible, it quickly became a stand-in for all that is wrong with Obama.</p> <p>And so, the Republicans made \"We built that\" the theme of Tuesday's convention proceedings. Speaker after speaker hammered on this theme, accusing Obama of disrespecting small business. But they did so with almost a wilful sense of hypocrisy. For example, Delaware lieutenant governor candidate <a href=\"http://www.buzzfeed.com/andrewkaczynski/rnc-primetime-speaker-gave-extensive-powerpoint-on\">Sher Valenzuela&#xa0;attacked</a> Obama for the line despite the fact that, just a few months ago, she gave a detailed speech to a business group about how they could do a better job getting government contracts.</p> <p>The shining example, however, was <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/08/28/phil-archuletta-gop-convention_n_1838173.html\">Phil Archuletta</a>, a New Mexico businessman whose business makes outdoor signs \u2013 in part, for the federal government. Archuletta's chief complaint against the president was that Obama's stimulus bill had made it harder for him to win government contracts \u2013 an odd message for an evening dedicated to the notion that small businesses need government to get out of the way.</p> <p>Democratic partisans were busy tweeting out the fact that Obama has signed multiple pieces of legislation providing tax breaks for small businesses, but such \"facts\" simply bounce harmlessly off the GOP's protective truth shield. Indeed, if there is one overarching takeaway, not only from the sessions so far at the Republican convention, but also from the last year of political campaigning, it is that Republicans not only toil in their own narrowly and misleadingly constructed world, but really are just <em>making stuff up</em>.</p> <p>There were plenty of instances on display last night, beyond the \"you didn't build it\" meme. The most pernicious and racially-coded example is the oft-repeated claim by the Romney campaign that Obama, by granting waivers to states, has gutted the work requirement of the welfare reform bill (passed more than 15 years ago). The charge has become a crucial element of Romney's attacks on the president, even though, as many independent fact-checkers have pointed out, it simply isn't true. It's another lie; and yet, it was repeated last night by former Democratic Congressman Artur Davis, and again, by failed presidential candidate Rick Santorum, who went a step further and accused Obama of creating a \"nightmare of dependency\".</p> <p>These are the big lies; but there are so many other ones that it's almost impossible to keep track. For example, speaker after speaker denounced Obama for running up $5tn in debt. While budget deficits that have increased the national debt have occurred during Obama's presidency, only someone who believes history began on 20 January 2009 (when Obama took office) can think he is fully responsible.</p> <p>As this handy <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/wp/2012/08/28/republican-national-convention-the-one-graph-you-need-to-see-before-watching/\">chart, put together by the folks at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities</a>, the debt is a result of a confluence of factors: the Bush tax cuts, the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, the decline in tax revenue from the economic downturn, Tarp, and \u2013 very slightly \u2013 recovery measures put in place by President Obama. Republicans have completely washed their hands of any role and any responsibility for America's ever-increasing red tape \u2013 and it should be noted that the budgets of both Romney and Ryan (when he served in the House) would, because of massive tax cuts, further explode the deficit.</p> <p>Republicans also decry the president's jobs record and they certainly have a point, but again, to blame Obama for 8% unemployment is to ignore the fact that Congress exists: it has regularly blocked any and all job creation measures ever since Obama's stimulus bill, which did create about 2.5 million jobs. </p> <p>Then, there are assertions like keynote speaker New Jersey Governor Chris Christie's claim that Americans are \"overtaxed\", even thought the tax burden on taxpayers is at its lowest point since the Truman administration \u2013 and Obama has repeatedly cut taxes as president. Indeed, as Tom Schaller, a political scientist at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County (UMBC) said to me:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"Republicans say they value low taxes and hard work but fought until the 11th hour against the only tax levied directly on work: the payroll tax.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>But all of this is at pace with a conservative worldview that considers government to be nothing more than malevolent interference with the smooth operation of the private sector \u2013 except when it's not. \"Jobs don't come from government,\" said Texas Senate candidate Ted Cruz last night, a view that basically sums up GOP economic thinking. But if you listened to Republican governors on Tuesday, you might have found yourself surprised to discover that, in their states, the government has played an oddly integral role in spurring job creation. If you listened to Mary Fallin, governor of Oklahoma, extol the virtues of the energy industry in her state and bemoan \"more government, bigger spending and more regulation\", you might never know that the oil and gas industry is deeply reliant on \u2013 and spends millions lobbying for \u2013 tax breaks from the federal government.</p> <p>One can believe that government should play a less direct role in the workings of the private economy \u2013 clearly, this is a defensible notion. But to listen to Republicans harping on Obama's \"you didn't build that\" line is to hear a party that views \"government\" in the most simplistic imaginable terms. This isn't a governing philosophy; it's a caricature of how the economy actually works.</p> <p>To be sure, it's hardly unusual for political rhetoric to take liberties with the truth, or to stretch an argument to breaking-point, but with Republicans today, the issues runs much deeper. Very simply, the way they talk about what the federal government does or should do, and about the role of spending, taxation and regulation, is more than just a compendium of lies: it describes an alternate reality.</p> <p>In the GOP's defense: at least they can argue they built that.</p> <p>\u2022 Editor's note: this article originally identified Mary Fallin as governor of Nebraska; this was amended to Oklahoma at 12.30am on 30 August 2012.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was further amended on 3 September 2012 to clarify Thomas Schaller's affiliation.</p>",
  "<p>While a tropical storm batters the Gulf coast and Republicans make their case for reclaiming the White House, Barack Obama diverted attention from both by typing three simple words on Wednesday afternoon: \"ask me anything.\" </p> <p>When a politician needs to relate better to an unsure public, secret weapons include wives, friends, pets and \u2013&#xa0;if you're Bill Clinton \u2013 brass musical instruments. For Obama, his talent has long been his ability to communicate in digital. And so he appeared out of nowhere on the Reddit message board \u2013 as <a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/user/PresidentObama\">PresidentObama</a> \u2013 fielding questions from people who want to know about everything from Gitmo to the White House beer recipe (\"It will be out soon! I can tell from first hand experience, it is tasty,\" he <a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z1c9z/i_am_barack_obama_president_of_the_united_states/c60ncij\">wrote</a>.)</p> <p>For the uninitiated, Reddit is a labyrinthine message board that hosts countless topic boards (subreddits) policed by interested parties (redditors). Users can cast a vote to send story links and comments up or down. The best content, in theory, rises to the top of each subreddit. </p> <p>Though Wednesday was certainly a moment in the sun, Reddit has managed to stay largely out of the mainstream. For first-time visitors, the shorthand takes awhile to understand. \"AMA\" for instance, stands for Ask Me Anything, one of the more mainstream features on the site, where anyone can put themselves forward to be questioned about their area of interest of expertise.</p> <p>Celebrities and politicians alike have attempted to let the asking public pelt them with questions \u2013 with varying degrees of success, as some of the more overly self-promoting users have found out the hard way. (No word yet if Obama's \"Don't forget to vote in November!\" went over well with the community.) </p> <p>And today, Obama's \"AMA\" soared to the top of Reddit itself. </p> <p>Here is a selection of his answers from the chat, exactly as they appeared on Reddit: </p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z1c9z/i_am_barack_obama_president_of_the_united_states/c60n8iu\">On troop surge in Afghanistan:</a> </h2> <p>The decision to surge our forces in afghanistan. Any time you send our brave men and women into battle, you know that not everyone will come home safely, and that necessarily weighs heavily on you. The decision did help us blunt the taliban's momentum, and is allowing us to transition to afghan lead - so we will have recovered that surge at the end of this month, and will end the war at the end of 2014. But knowing of the heroes that have fallen is something you never forget.</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z1c9z/i_am_barack_obama_president_of_the_united_states/c60n24k\">On internet legislation:</a></h2> <p>Internet freedom is something I know you all care passionately about; I do too. We will fight hard to make sure that the internet remains the open forum for everybody - from those who are expressing an idea to those to want to start a business. And although their will be occasional disagreements on the details of various legislative proposals, I won't stray from that principle - and it will be reflected in the platform.</p> <h2>On money in politics:</h2> <p>Money has always been a factor in politics, but we are seeing something new in the no-holds barred flow of seven and eight figure checks, most undisclosed, into super-PACs; they fundamentally threaten to overwhelm the political process over the long run and drown out the voices of ordinary citizens. We need to start with passing the Disclose Act that is already written and been sponsored in Congress - to at least force disclosure of who is giving to who. We should also pass legislation prohibiting the bundling of campaign contributions from lobbyists. Over the longer term, I think we need to seriously consider mobilizing a constitutional amendment process to overturn Citizens United (assuming the Supreme Court doesn't revisit it). Even if the amendment process falls short, it can shine a spotlight of the super-PAC phenomenon and help apply pressure for change.</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z1c9z/i_am_barack_obama_president_of_the_united_states/c60n33k\">On sports teams:</a></h2> <p>I'm a [Chicago] Bulls guy.</p> <h2>Questions we wish he answered:</h2> <p>\u2022 President Obama, why didn't you close Guantanamo Bay as you promised you would?<br>\u2022 The ice in the arctic is the lowest ever recorded, and there are two more weeks of melting left in the summer. Will climate change get the attention it so desperately needs in your second term?<br>\u2022 Mr. President, given the last four years (and especially the last two), what gives you confidence that Congress will be willing to work with you in a second term?</p> <h2>And one we're glad he didn't:</h2> <p>\u2022 Toilet paper - facing out, or facing in?</p>",
  "<p>I work for a media organisation but I must fess up: the media is as good at 'speaking truth to power' as it is at inventing 'truths', exploiting our collective fear and perpetuating stereotypes. Guilty as charged.</p> <p>For those reasons of course \u2013 and others such as working on controversial research and a <a href=\"http://sciencecareers.sciencemag.org/career_magazine/previous_issues/articles/2008_09_12/caredit.a0800134\" title=\"\">concern over a loss of credibility among peers</a> \u2013 academics can be reticent about talking to the media. But as Fiona Fox, director of the Science Media Centre, writes in a <a href=\"http://interactive.bis.gov.uk/scienceandsociety/site/media/files/2010/01/Science-and-the-Media-Securing-the-Future.pdf\" title=\"\">report about science and the media</a>, \"rightly or wrongly, some of the most important science debates of our times have been conducted on the front pages and in the headlines of the mainstream news \u2026 we ignore the mass media at our peril.\"</p> <p>On the surface, all higher education institutions have heeded those words. No university is without a press office, few do not have academics trained up as media experts, some are even proactive about informing the media about the availability of these experts to comment on issues as they arise. Still higher education and the media do not always make comfortable bedfellows.</p> <p>Melonie Fullick, a doctoral researcher at York University in Canada, has written a fair bit about the HE-media relationship. In one <a href=\"http://speculative-diction.blogspot.co.uk/2011/06/universities-media-part-2-why-media.html\" title=\"\">blogpost</a>, she lists 10 recurrent themes covered by the media, which she describes as \"often ill-informed\". She adds: \"While there are serious problems with some of the changes happening in universities, the debates that happen in the media don't necessarily contribute to public debate in a productive way.\"</p> <p>It would seem from bad science to bad policy, academia can \u2013 and is often \u2013 misrepresented. But as both Fullick and Fox say, the solution is not in returning to the 'knowledge castle' and pulling up the drawbridge. Universities and the researchers who work in them must engage with the media, and must do so ... well, engagingly.</p> <p>So on Friday 31 August at 12 BST, we'll discuss how to build trust in university-media relationships, how to avoid an institution, individual or piece of research being misrepresented or misquoted and best practice in traditional and social media training for researchers and academics.</p> <p><em>The discussion will take place in the comment threads beneath this blog.

  "<p>Republicans are looking to vice-presidential candidate Paul Ryan to fire up a lacklustre party convention dogged by bad weather and a lack of enthusiasm among many delegates for Mitt Romney.</p> <p>Delegates are hoping Ryan can replicate the excitement created by the 2008 vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin \u2013 while avoiding the later pitfalls of her disastrous media appearances.</p> <p>\"Early on, Sarah gave a lot of energy to people, and I think Paul will do the same,\" former Mississippi governor Haley Barbour told the Hill, the Washington newspaper devoted to politics.</p> <p>After losing all but a few minutes of the opening day on Monday to hurricane Isaac, the first full day on Tuesday was largely subdued, with little of the raucousness and enthusiasm normally found at Republican conventions.</p> <p>Many of the party's weakness going into the autumn campaign are also on display at the convention, with women and Latinos, two groups in which Romney is trailing badly behind Barack Obama, being pushed to the fore. There is only a tiny minority of African Americans among the overwhelmingly white audience.</p> <p>Women, Latinos and black Republicans are being given prominent roles as speakers, and a delegation made up mainly of Latinos has been pushed into a spot in front of the main platform.</p> <p>Ryan's role, as well as building up Romney, is to rally the diehard conservatives and Tea Party activists who make up a large part of the Republican base.</p> <p>The Obama campaign launched a pre-emptive strike before Ryan's convention speech, releasing a new video using black-and-white footage to highlight their contention that he is a throwback to a bygone era.</p> <p>The Obama campaign said: \"Paul Ryan has made it clear that he'll take the nation back to a very different era \u2013 including same failed policies that crashed our economy in the first place.\"</p> <p>In the video, mocked up to look like newsreel from the 1940s and 1950s, the Obama campaign accuses him of supporting a budget that will hurt the working class, end the Medicare health scheme, and cut programmes for students. It also accuses him of being anti-women and anti-abortion.</p> <p>A Ryan spokesman, Brendan Buck, responding to claims in the video that Ryan would be disastrous for the working-class, accused the Obama of \"tired and misleading attacks in an attempt to divert attention away from his failed record\".</p> <p>Ryan will be speaking after the failure of New Jersey governor Chris Christie, Tuesday's keynote speaker, to fulfill his task of mounting an effective attack on Obama and talking up Romney. Christie spoke for 17 minutes before he mentioned Romney.</p> <p>Condoleezza Rice, the secretary of state in the Bush administration, is to be the warm-up for Ryan. In a CBS interview on Wednesday, Rice said that Romney \u2013 unlike Obama \u2013 would lead from the front in world affairs, although Romney has had little to say about foreign policy so far.</p> <p>While Rice insisted she was not advocating intervention in Syria, she said: \"When the United States' voice is muted, the world is a more dangerous place \u2026 Just look at the situation in Syria, for instance. We have a circumstance in which [\u202aSyrian president Bashar] \u202cAssad is butchering his people, the Iranians are helping him to do so, the United States seems to be mired in the security council, the Russians and the Chinese say, 'No, no, no,' and we don't seem to have an answer.\"</p> <p>Rice was adamant she would not take a role in a Romney cabinet, saying she intended to remain in the academic world.</p> <p>One of the biggest obstacles to Romney winning the presidency, in spite of widespread and deep dissatisfaction with Obama's handling of the economy, is the alienation of Latinos through his anti-immigration rhetoric. The Democrats enjoy a two-to-one advantage over the Republicans among Latinos, one of the fastest-growing groups.</p> <p>The former Republican governor of Florida, Jeb Bush, George's brother, and who is married to a Latino, expressed his frustration with his own party at a Hispanic outreach meeting in Tampa on Tuesday. He predicted the party will not close the gap with Latino voters until they \"stop acting stupid\".</p> <p>The Republican national committee also risked alienating floating voters by publishing as part of the convention its official programme a platform document setting out various policy goals such as a ban on all abortions, a ban on gay marriage, turning Medicare into a voucher scheme and introducing more tax cuts.</p> <p>Romney is not bound by the platform programme. His campaign, while saying it supports the Medicare reform and more tax cuts, favours exemptions from the abortion ban in cases of rape, incest and risk to women's health.</p>",
  "<p>When power starts to shift in the Middle East, its people have long known what to expect. Challenges to authority have rarely been met with a&#xa0;promise of consensus or inclusion. Strong-arm suppression \u2013 the more forceful the better \u2013 has been the default reaction to dissent. The price&#xa0;has usually been brutal.</p> <p>Syrians who wanted an end to regime dominance knew the rules when they started demanding changes in the region's most uncompromising police state in March last year. Now, 18&#xa0;months and more than 23,000 bodies later, and&#xa0;with no end in sight to the chaos ravaging the country, their&#xa0;worst fears are being realised on a&#xa0;scale that continues both to horrify and numb.</p> <p>And yet, the events of the past 18&#xa0;months have shattered one of the abiding guidelines to life under totalitarian rule \u2013 that absolute power is uncontestable. If anything has so far been achieved through the bedlam now rumbling through Syria and indeed other parts of the Arab world, it is a new reality: the power of the street has exposed the fragility of authority.</p> <p>\"I had always said they would fall over when we were no longer scared of them,\" Moustafa Abu Khalil, a retired electricity worker from the northern Syrian town of Jisr al-Shughour, told me in June. \"It took a long time to get to the point where people were prepared to risk everything, their families, their futures, just to bring about change. \"The truth be told, [the people] probably wouldn't have got here if the regime did not continue to escalate the violence every month. That just fed the flames. And now we have a true revolution, civil war, call it what you will. It is a point of no return.\"</p> <p>With all of Syria's cities now under siege, its capital Damascus and commercial hub Aleppo engulfed in violence, Syria seems well past that proverbial point. Defections have whittled down the strength and numbers of the country's vaunted military and destruction and misery is&#xa0;seriously testing the resolve of both&#xa0;regime supporters and those who&#xa0;want Bashar al-Assad gone.</p> <p>The country's economy has been under the anaconda-like grip of international sanctions, which have ground industry to a halt, crippled trade supply lines, battered the currency and shattered confidence. In the hard-hit north, little works any more. War has seen Syrian society, already stuck \u2013 seemingly permanently in 1973&#xa0;\u2013 wound back even further. There are more donkey carts than cars on the streets of some towns between Aleppo and the Turkish border. Clapped-out tractors belch fumes from precious fuel&#xa0;that is sold in&#xa0;two-litre bottles on&#xa0;rubbish-strewn roadsides for around $8 (\u00a35).</p> <p>\"None of us can afford it,\" says Abu Nour, a member of the Free Syrian Army, who, before the Syrian uprising gained momentum, was a tailor whose only military experience was 15 months as a&#xa0;conscript more than a decade ago. \"I'm not sure where the money is coming from to get us to the frontline. Those things a person like me doesn't ask.\"</p> <p>Abu Nour is now a foot soldier in the&#xa0;rebel army that is at the vanguard of the fight for Syria's destiny. Drawn largely from the rural poor, and also represented by conservative Islamic groupings such as the Muslim Brotherhood, the FSA has taken the battle to the country's two lead cities, where it is now engaged in a fight to the death with the regime army.</p> <p>Rebel groups entered Aleppo and Damascus in mid-July and their early gains sparked predictions that four decades of uncompromising rule was about to end. But as a withering summer draws to a close across the northern plains that have harboured Aleppo, and the central plateau on which Damascus, the world's oldest capital has stood for more than 6,000 years, this early optimism has yielded to a more unpalatable reality \u2013 that neither side is&#xa0;about to secure a decisive victory in either city anytime soon.</p> <p>The soaring death toll this week in&#xa0;Damascus, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/aug/28/syria-worst-massacre-daraya-death-toll-400?utm_source=dlvr.it&amp;utm_medium=feed\" title=\"\">where more than 300 people were reportedly killed in one day alone</a>, and the grinding misery in the battlefield suburbs of Aleppo, have left many in Syria \u2013 and in the rest of the ever-more restive region \u2013 wondering what comes next.</p> <p>\"Change of this scale is perilous,\" says Rita Sabbagh, a Damascus businesswoman who supports the regime. \"You must understand that meaningful shifts in thinking and behaviour take generations in this part of the world. Did they really think they would just ride into town like this and the regime would run away?\"</p> <p>Were he to try to cut a deal with Syria's fractious opposition groups or to capitulate to their demands, the downside for Assad and the regime he inherited from his father is obvious. Also increasingly clear, even to lay observers, is the scale of the risk to Syria's neighbours if the civil war continues to expose regional fault lines&#xa0;that have remained unaddressed throughout the modern history of the&#xa0;region.</p> <p>After the 500-year Ottoman empire disintegrated more than 90 years ago, the borders of Syria, Iraq, Lebanon, Jordan and what was to become Israel were defined \u2013 often on imperial whim. The pact between Britain and France that led to Syria's independence, known as the Sykes-Picot agreement, cobbled together various sects under the banner of nation states, which have not coexisted easily.</p> <p>For more than 40 years, the Alawite sect, which is loosely aligned to Shia Islam and had long been persecuted under the Ottomans, has been used to solidify regime control. Most of the key regime figures, including the Assads, have been Alawites ever since Bashar's father, Hafez al-Assad, was at the peak of his powers. Despite comprising around 12% of Syria's population, the Alawites dominate the Syrian establishment and hold most key positions in the military and security apparatus. Now, as&#xa0;Syria wobbles, the sect feels a deep sense of threat from the country's majority Sunnis, some of whom hold grudges against the regime because of&#xa0;its treatment towards them before the uprising.</p> <p>\"Egypt and Libya have taught us that the way that power works [now] in Syria does not have to be the way it will always be,\" said Mohammed Hariri at one of Aleppo's frontline zones earlier this month. A realignment of power appears to be top of the wish list for many fighters and residents alike in Syria's opposition strongholds. But such a shift will not be contained within Syria's borders \u2013 a fact that is causing increasing alarm outside the country and fuelling fears&#xa0;that changes more profound than&#xa0;anything since the fall of the Ottomans are starting to take place in&#xa0;the Middle East.</p> <p>In neighbouring Lebanon, long under the tutelage of Syria to the east and the influence of other players, such as Saudi Arabia, the United States, France and Israel, the tension is palpable. \"I'm afraid that if things are to stay like that, it could lead to the partitioning of Syria and where that will lead the Middle East, don't ask me,\" the leader of Lebanon's Druze sect, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walid_Jumblatt\" title=\"\">Walid Jumblatt</a>, told the Guardian earlier this month. \"Big historical cities will be destroyed. Assad might take refuge in the mountains. Now he is trying to cleanse the Sunnis from Latakia, Benyas, Tartous. It seems the map of Syria is being changed. What is left of the famous Sykes-Picot agreement is being changed.\"</p> <p>Along with Jumblatt, other Lebanese leaders broadly aligned to the west or Saudi Arabia have been lying low this summer. The country's former prime minister, Saad Hariri \u2013 whose father, the Lebanese elder statesman Rafiq Hariri, was assassinated in 2005 \u2013 has been in self-imposed exile in Riyadh and Paris for the past 18 months.</p> <p>Samir Geagea, a political ally of the Hariri, who leads a prominent Christian political bloc, <a href=\"http://www.free-lebanon.net/syria/lf-leader-samir-geagea-escapes-assassination-attempt/\" title=\"\">survived a failed attempt by a sniper to shoot him</a> in his garden in June. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/aug/14/assad-lebanon-damascus-syria\" title=\"\">The arrest earlier this month of Lebanon's former information minister, Michel Samaha</a>, a key ally of Bashar al-Assad, has given weight to the fears that assassins are lurking.</p> <p>Samaha has been charged with receiving explosives and instructions from Syria's national security chief, General Ali Mamlouk, allegedly with the knowledge of Assad, to target 20 key figures in Lebanon. He was entrapped by a close aide who filmed him saying Assad was personally aware&#xa0;of the plans. His case is now before a military tribunal, a rare event in Lebanon, where state institutions have often failed to assert their independence.</p> <p>In Iraq, where assassins have remained a part of the political fabric for much of the past eight years, there is also a growing fear that the chaos in Syria cannot be contained. Islamist groups that wreaked havoc between 2004 and 2007 have announced that they are trying to reclaim ground they lost during fighting with US forces and&#xa0;militias that were at the time backed by the US and Iraqi governments. They claim to be drawing inspiration from the Syrian uprising, which has in part been joined by a new dynamic \u2013 jihadists from other parts of the Arab world, some of whom see the fighting taking place in Syria as part of a global jihad.</p> <p>\"They are trying to make their presence felt again,\" the director general of&#xa0;the intelligence division at Iraq's interior ministry, Major General Ali Hussein Kamal, explained earlier this month. \"They see what is happening in&#xa0;Syria as a chance for them.\"</p> <p>Sitting in his fortified office in a riverside Baghdad suburb, Kamal claimed that Syria's insistence that the&#xa0;uprising against it is a foreign-led plot using jihadists was at odds with Iraq's recent dealings with Syria. \"In&#xa0;2009, the bombs that targeted the ministries could clearly be traced back to Syria,\" he said. \"Both in planning and instruction.\"</p> <p>Asked whether he believed that regime figures had known of the bombing campaign, in which huge bombs targeted the finance, foreign and justice ministries, as well as the Baghdad governor's offices, killing more than 200 people, Kamal said: \"I refer you to&#xa0;the comments of the defected Syrian&#xa0;ambassador to Iraq who said the&#xa0;regime had close links to al-Qaida and had links to the recent bombings in&#xa0;Damascus.\"</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395465184\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2012/8/29/1346257793617/A-man-reacts-after-an-air-010.jpg\" alt=\"A man reacts after an airstrike on Azaz, 15 August 2012\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A man reacts after an airstrike on Azaz destroyed 10 buildings on 15 August 2012. Photograph: AP</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As Aleppo has burned, the regime counter-assault in Damascus has been relentless over the past fortnight. The Syrian army has warned of \"inevitable death\" for rebel fighters who don't put down their weapons in areas known as opposition strongholds. Anti-regime neighbourhoods say they have little reason to trust that pledges of amnesties will be honoured by a military that has shown no quarter in more than a year of&#xa0;battles with rebels. And, as sectarian positions harden, in an increasingly volatile region, there appears little reason for the regime to decide that now would be a time for compromise.</p> <p>Iran, which has viewed Syria as its key&#xa0;ally in the Arab world for much of the past 30 years, has shown signs of increasing belligerence as the situation in&#xa0;Syria has deteriorated. The fall of Damascus would be a serious strategic blow for Tehran, as it would for its key ally in Lebanon, Hezbollah, which has enjoyed staunch support and patronage from both regimes since 1982.</p> <p>Also unflinchingly in Syria's corner is&#xa0;Russia, which has acted to prevent even more severe international sanctions or any move towards direct foreign intervention in the conflict. Russia's ties&#xa0;to the Syrian regime date back to Soviet days and have, in many ways, post-dated them. Libya and Egypt had at&#xa0;times been in the Soviet sphere. Syria, meanwhile, has barely left it despite the&#xa0;end of the cold war more than 20&#xa0;years ago.</p> <p>Late last month, in a grand villa&#xa0;in the Aleppo hinterland that belongs to the family of General Hikmat Shehabi, a former confidante of Hafez al-Assad who left Syria shortly after his son was named president, rebels thumbed through old books on a lounge room shelf. One had been signed by the late North Korean dictator, Kim Jung-il. There were also tomes in tribute to Assad Sr and eulogies to the achievements of Soviet society. Time had stood still in the dusty marble mansion, just as&#xa0;it had on the drab empty streets outside where this society in the north&#xa0;of&#xa0;a country deeply embroiled in revolution seemed collectively unsure about what to do next.</p> <p>\"Nobody has come to help us,\" said&#xa0;Khalid Ibrahim, a steel worker who joined the rebel army when dwindling business closed his workshop earlier this&#xa0;year. A Russian-made Mig fighter jet circled nearby as Ibrahim pressed his point. \"We knew what we were up against when we took this on, but in Libya the Americans were there within a&#xa0;month. France and Britain were fighting each other to be the first to bomb Gaddafi. And Assad is worse, much, much worse.\" He shook his head, then added: \"This could be a disaster, or a new map. Only God knows which way it will go.\"</p> <p>In dozens of conversations the Guardian has had with Syrians in recent months \u2013 some diehard regime backers and others just as deeply committed to the opposition cause \u2013 a&#xa0;clear sense has emerged that the popular uprising that started it all in the southern city of Deraa has been dwarfed by something far more significant.</p> <p>The arc of revolution that started in&#xa0;Tunisia, surged through Egypt, then&#xa0;raged through Libya, has hit an obstacle in Syria, one that may prove difficult as a whole for the region to bypass. \"History has hijacked what the people were trying to achieve,\" says Amal Kuzbari, a Syrian teacher from Homs, now a refugee in southern Turkey. \"It&#xa0;was simple at the beginning and it&#xa0;isn't now.</p> <p>The fight for Syria has become a struggle for the destiny of the region. It&#xa0;is also now a clash of ideologies and orders, of sects and societies. The battle for regional influence runs straight through Damascus and none of&#xa0;the region's main players are willing to yield ground. \"It's Sunni versus Shia, Arab versus Persian, America versus Russia, the list goes on,\" says a western diplomat. \"This is unfinished business on many levels.\"</p> <p>What will emerge from Syria's civil war will likely take many months to determine. A rapid end to the regime would not mean an end to crisis. The vacuum that would follow the end of strongman rule would take some filling \u2013 the recent experience of Iraq to the east, another sectarian state bound together by an autocrat, clearly demonstrates that.</p> <p>Even states such as Turkey, with strong borders and robust institutions, will remain susceptible to Syria's spillover effects. Turkey is now hosting around 40,000 Syrian refugees and said earlier this year that it has prepared contingencies for up to 500,000. However, if Syria's Kurds decide that the crumbling of state authority gives them the chance to push their case for statehood, <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/08/29/us-syria-crisis-refugees-turkey-idUSBRE87S08020120829\" title=\"\">Turkey will be facing more than a refugee crisis</a>.</p> <p>\"Changing how power works [in the&#xa0;region] is a good thing,\" explains a&#xa0;Syrian exile in Beirut, who claims to support neither side. \"But I'm not sure people know exactly what it is they have started.\"</p>",

  "<p>If the Venice film festival needed an electric charge to shock it into motion, it came midway through the world premiere of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/aug/29/reluctant-fundamentalist-review?intcmp=ILCMUSTXT9384\" title=\"\">The Reluctant Fundamentalist</a>, when a Wall Street hotshot watches the planes hit the World Trade Centre and then flashes an exultant smile at his TV screen. \"In that moment I should have felt sorrow or anger,\" our hero confesses. \"But all I felt was awe.\"</p> <p>The Reluctant Fundamentalist \u2013 directed by Mira Nair from the novel by Mohsin Hamid \u2013 is a globalised rites-of-passage tale, torn between two worlds, pointed towards disaster, and damning capitalism and terrorism with the same brush. Yet while the material may be contentious, its director insisted that the film be viewed as a dialogue rather than a confrontation.</p> <p>\"I hope American audiences receive it as it was intended \u2013 as a film made by people who understand what it is to love America,\" Nair said. \"I hope they see it as a conversation between two cultures that goes beyond the prejudices that contaminate us. I really believe, unlike George W Bush, that it's not a case of 'You're either with us or against us'. There is a third way. There is common ground.\"</p> <p>The Reluctant Fundamentalist stars the British actor Riz Ahmed as Changez, a Pakistani immigrant who first chases and then rejects the American dream, eventually falling in with a group of radical Islamists back in his native Lahore.</p> <p>\"Changez grows up between two worlds, and as a British Pakistani I can relate to that,\" Ahmed explained. \"I attended a university [Oxford] where my cultural background was very different to those around me. But the film is about getting rid of those labels and stereotypes \u2013 or at least stretching the labels wide enough so that we can live inside them comfortably.\"</p> <p>It could be argued that The Reluctant Fundamentalist brings its director full circle. Indian-born and New York-based, Nair won the Venice Golden Lion award for her 2001 drama <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/89830/monsoon.wedding\" title=\"\">Monsoon Wedding</a>. The prize was handed out on 9 September, - just 48 hours before the terrorist attacks.</p> <p>\"I remember it well,\" said Nair, now 54. \"I live in New York. My husband and family were in the city. It took me a week to get back there and, when I did, the whole place reminded me of images from my home country \u2013 the refugee camps, the sense of a war zone, the sense of fear. In New York you rarely hear anyone speaking English. Everyone is a foreigner and yet everyone belongs. But suddenly it became a place where everyone who looked like us was viewed as 'the other'. It was a deeply disturbing time \u2013 both for us and for the world.\"</p> <p>The Reluctant Fundamentalist sets the stage for what is being regarded as a mouthwatering lineup at this year's festival. Potential highlights include To the Wonder, a new drama from the revered director <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/terrence-malick\" title=\"\">Terrence Malick</a>, and Spring Breakers, a student heist caper shot by the iconoclastic American film-maker <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/harmony-korine\" title=\"\">Harmony Korine</a>. Elsewhere, the controversy looks likely to be provided by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/paul-thomas-anderson\" title=\"\">Paul Thomas Anderson</a>'s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/146341/master\" title=\"\">The Master</a> \u2013 reputedly a thinly veiled biopic of Scientology founder L Ron Hubbard.</p> <p>The oldest festival on the movie calendar, Venice celebrates its 69th birthday with a refurbished site and a new artistic director in Alberto Barbera. \"The festival is like a grand old lady,\" <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/may/29/venice-film-festival-slims-down-sober\" title=\"\">Barbera told Italian journalists earlier this summer</a>. \"A refined lady, but one in need of freshening up.\"</p> <p>Barbera's solution is a more even spread of established film-makers, with emerging talent from outside the Hollywood orbit. Among the new arrivals are Hinde Boujemaa, whose documentary, It Was Better Tomorrow, probes the consequences of the Tunisian revolution, and Haifaa al-Mansour, reportedly Saudi Arabia's first female feature film director. \"A festival should not just be a catwalk for celebrities,\" Barbera has insisted.</p> <p>Those in the running for this year's Golden Lion must convince a panel headed by Michael Mann, the American director behind <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/60365/heat\" title=\"\">Heat</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/81962/insider\" title=\"\">The Insider</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/129313/public-enemies\" title=\"\">Public Enemies</a>. Asked by Barbera to deliver an opening statement, Mann appeared momentarily stumped before electing to keep it simple. \"We have a terrific jury,\" he said. \"Everyone is looking forward to seeing some exciting work over the next 10 days.\" When navigating a confusing, shifting, globalised world, it is sometimes best to focus on the fundamentals.</p>",
  "<p><a href=\"http://stcuthbertsway.info/\">St Cuthbert's Way</a> winds its meandering path or 100 kilometers from <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2006/mar/03/ruralaffairs.comment?INTCMP=SRCH\">Melrose Abbey</a> in the Scottish Borders to <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2002/dec/20/ruralaffairs?INTCMP=SRCH\">Lindisfarne</a> on the Northumberland coast. Both places are closely associated with Cuthbert's life. Nobody knows for certain whether he was born in what is now England or Scotland. What is fairly certain is that as a teenager he became a monk at Old Melrose, a couple of miles east of the present Abbey ruins. Later on he became abbot of Melrose before moving to Lindisfarne to become prior and eventually bishop.</p> <p>The long distance trail between Melrose and Lindisfarne takes in some glorious countryside on both sides of the border, and past some fascinating places at start and finish and at many places in between.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395342785\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/29/1346229363338/Cuthbert_almost_certainly_didnt_leave_from_here_Melrose_Abbey.JPG\" alt=\"cuthbert melrose haig walter scott\" width=\"448\" height=\"336\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">St Cuthbert almost certainly didn't leave from here.

The path carries on through beautiful varied woodland. At Newtown St Boswell you join the Tweed, fast flowing from recent rain, and there were several herons with their slow-motion lazy flight. A slight detour from the path brings you to <a href=\"http://www.historic-scotland.gov.uk/propertyresults/propertyabout.htm?PropID=PL_097&amp;PropName=Dryburgh%20Abbey\">Dryburgh Abbey</a>. Set in beautiful parkland on a bend in the Tweed, the north transept of the abbey boasts the graves of two famous Scottish borderers. First is Sir Walter Scott, whose house at Abbotsford is nearby. More recent is that of Lord Haig, the commander in chief of the army during World War 1. A plaque explains that his gravestone</p> <blockquote> <p>is the same as those placed in many lands over his comrades who fell in the Great War</p> </blockquote> <p>It doesn't go on to add that the \"comrades\" he sent to their deaths were mostly in their teens and 20s, while he died peacefully aged 87. Interestingly, Historic Scotland, in the \"highlights\" section of its information panel \"Welcome to Dryburgh Abbey\", mentions Scott's grave but not Haig's \u2013 they can't be ashamed of him, surely?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395342787\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/29/1346229467662/Cuthbert_Waterloo_Monument.JPG\" alt=\"waterloo melrose cuthbert\" width=\"150\" height=\"160\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Waterloo Monument.  Very fine views from the base.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alan Sykes/PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>After a pleasant mile or so following the Tweed, the path joins the Dere Street, a Roman Road which ran north from Hadrian's Wall and which would almost certainly have been travelled on by Cuthbert. Parts of it run between an avenue of ancient oaks interspersed with ash and maple. Up to the east is the Waterloo Monument column, while to the west of the road is the site of the Battle of Ancrum Moor, where the Scots, including <em>Wicked Wat</em>Scott of Buccleuch thumped an English raiding party in 1545, killing 800 men and capturing another 1000. Sadly the beauty of the Roman Road is not enhanced by the noise from the busy parallel A68 main road. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2004/mar/16/iraq.iraq2?INTCMP=SRCH\">Michael Ancram</a>, a once prominent tory shadow cabinet member who seems to have disappeared from view since the coalition government came to power, was Earl of Ancram (an alternative spelling of the village), and his family, the Kerrs, still own large estates in the area.</p> <p>Jedburgh, a mile or so south of the path, has a few hotels and B&amp;Bs which makes it a convenient place to stop for the first night, and has the day's third abbey. The town appears to go to bed at about 9pm, has a cafe whose menu advertises \"tap water, small 75p/large 99p\", something I've never seen before anywhere.</p> <p><em>More from Alan tomorrow - as the Heavens threaten rain.</em></p>",

  "<p>I'm in love. Again. I can't believe it. I thought I was over all that - the palpitations, the tug of lust across a crowded room but it turns out I'm not. My pulse quickens and my palms sweat as I fight my way across to the objects of my desire \u2013 in the Miu Miu section of Selfridges shoe hall. Oh my word! <a href=\"http://www.net-a-porter.com/product/311121\">The sinuous curve of the heel</a>! The inky darkness of the suede! The saucy little zip at the back! And, oh horrors, the price tag\u2026 Hush, can you hear that? That's my middle-aged common sense hitting the floor with a resounding thud. You know how it goes \u2013 the internal argument between good intentions and running for the cash register, booty in one hand and the credit card in the other. It'll be fine, you tell yourself, and it is, until the bill arrives and then it's a diet of self-recrimination, guilt and Pot Noodle for a month. It's shoes that are my Achilles heel, in a manner of speaking.</p> <p>I've always had a thing for shoes (and bowls, books, jugs, rings, old linen, cats and ice cream). I've written about shoes before and barely scratched the surface because there's just so much still to be written. To me shoes are works of art and I could, if I wished, write entire books about them. They are covetable, stroke-able, cherish-able, delicious pieces of design. I adore the curve of an instep, the arch of a foot, the hourglass shape of a Louis heel. Where shoes are concerned I have no will power \u2013 I have the backbone of a sonambulant squid.</p> <p>I'm not alone in this obsession. It's a well-trodden path, if you'll forgive the pun, but I do wonder if I'm in the minority for not having the wearing of beautiful shoes as the principal reason for buying them? I'm quite happy to sit and gaze at them, as I would a painting in the National Gallery, and I leave a different pair out of their box every week so that I can look at and enjoy them. Think of the love and pride with which <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/latestnews/2012/110112accused.html\">Sean Bean described Tracie's (size 10) Italian made custom stitched heels</a> in Jimmy McGovern's Accused the other week and you might begin to understand. I'll happily potter about at home in favourite shoes and sometimes I'll wear them for special occasions but I don't want to wear them out by wearing them OUT \u2013 it's a pair of flip-flops and a quick pause in a shop doorway or on the bus to change shoes. To be honest with you I've reached the age where I'm not prepared to put up with plantar fasciitis for the sake of the look of the thing anyway and it never ceases to amaze me that, however comfortable a pair of shoes are at home, by the time you've been standing for 10 minutes with a glass of wine in one hand and a mini-burger in the other your feet are on fire and you spend the rest of the evening looking for somewhere to take the weight off. In my recent partying past I've been known to take my shoes off partway through the evening and carry them around like a handbag \u2013 the problem with this is that I'm not very tall and disappear below canap\u00e9 height without a 6\" heel. Besides, the look is a bit flower-child-with-a-bus-pass.</p> <p>Anyway, I love and need designer shoes but I don't have that many really, mostly because I also need to eat and put a roof over my head. I also think (and I'm sure there'll be howls of protest at this) that once you're past a certain age/weight/physical shape some shoes just look wrong, like you're trying too hard. Still nothing will wean me off the shoes that can make or break an outfit, your hip, your bank balance and your heart.</p> <p>Follow The Invisible Woman on <a href=\"http://twitter.com/TheVintageYear\" title=\"\">Twitter @TheVintageYear</a></p>",

  "<p>The awful inevitability of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ballad_of_East_and_West\" title=\"\">Kipling's non-meeting of east and west</a> is the subject of this movie by Mira Nair, which begins the 2012 Venice film festival, adapted from the 2007 novel by<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/mohsin-hamid\" title=\"\"> Mohsen Hamid</a>. It's a sweeping and heartfelt tale of divided loyalties and reversion to type, in a world where the complacent ideas of globalised capitalism were shattered by 9/11.</p> <p>This is bold and muscular storytelling with a plausible performance from Riz Ahmed in the lead role \u2013 though there is something flabby and evasive in the inevitable equivalence it winds up proposing between Islamic fundamentalism and aggressive American capitalism.</p> <p>Ahmed is Changez, and if ever a character had a significant name, it's this one. He's a charismatic firebrand professor in Lahore, spreading anti-Americanism among his excitable students, under surveillance by the CIA and suspected of having something to do with the recent kidnapping of an expatriate American academic. And yet when Changez starts telling his life story to American journalist Bobby (Liev Schreiber) we see his troubled life unfold in flashback.</p>      <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-395409819\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/brightcove/2012/8/30/120830VeniceFundamentalist-16x9.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/connectedTV/1280/2012/8/30/120830VeniceFundamentalist-720.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2012/8/30/120830VeniceFundamentalist_3gpLg16x9.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/ad/120830VeniceFundamentalist/120830VeniceFundamentalist.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2012/8/30/120830VeniceFundamentalist_3gpSml16x9.3gp\"/> </video>   <p> Changez's ideological training camp was a Wall Street corporation: as a bright Pakistani immigrant to the US he gets an Ivy League scholarship and is fast-tracked into a high-flying Manhattan job, mentored by a beady-eyed Gordon Gekko figure, Jim Cross (Kiefer Sutherland). Mira Nair shows us that here is where Changez learns to be ruthless, internationally strategic, and fanatical. As an investment analyst, he travels the world showing businesses how to maximise profit \u2013 with cut-throat layoffs. But then 9/11 happens and Riz Ahmed shows us, in a flash, Changez's response \u2013 the response he cannot suppress but which is soon supplanted by horror at this mass murder.</p> <p>He grins. He is thrilled at the terrorists' spectacular audacity and the way they have humbled the mighty US. A micro-second later, he feels revulsion at the carnage \u2013 and unease at his own unguarded reaction \u2013 but cannot forget that initial, visceral response. Later, in the paranoid and besieged atmosphere, he is picked on in New York for the colour of his skin; defiantly he grows his beard, refuses to conform. Crucially, he has been having an affair with a young woman, Erica (Kate Hudson), who is still mourning a lost love whose place he has been trying to take: Changez has been a Fake American Boyfriend. The inevitability of his return to Pakistan and embrace of radicalism is obvious: but the movie tells us that the nature of this radicalism has been dictated by America.</p> <p>It is significantly in Istanbul \u2013 the world-historic border of faiths \u2013 that a disillusioned publisher tells Changez he is a \"janissary\": a fighter against his own side, like the Christian boys captured and trained to be warriors by the Ottoman empire. And these warriors, for mysterious reasons of self-hate, are the fiercest of all. It could be that Mira Nair is playing on the significance of the word \"janissary\" in the history of western imperialism and south Asia. Winston Churchill memorably justified his hostility to Indian self-government on the ostensible grounds that Muslims would be threatened: \"An army of white janissaries, officered if necessary from Germany, will be hired to secure the armed ascendancy of the Hindu.\"</p> <p>But having established this balance of fundamentalisms, does the movie just retreat into a copout? And what, ultimately, is the nature of Changez's reluctance as a fundamentalist? Is it simply down to each of the two sides of his personality feeling guilt about the other? Or is it that Hollywood rules dictate that Changez has to be a nice guy: a \"reluctant\" hero? It is a rather feeble liberal-humanist note to end on, but there is fascination in this story of an idealist, torn in two by history.</p>",
  "<h2>The winner</h2> <p>Arthouse cinema bookers have lamented that this summer lacked a big specialist release to rank alongside past summer hits <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/130736/coco-before-chanel\" title=\"\">Coco Before Chanel</a> or <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/117957/la.vie.en.rose\" title=\"\">La Vie en Rose</a>. May offered <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/145817/raid\" title=\"\">The Raid</a> and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/145667/moonrise-kingdom\" title=\"\">Moonrise Kingdom</a>, and June delivered <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/146747/angels-share\" title=\"\">The Angels' Share</a> and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/143054/killer-joe\" title=\"\">Killer Joe</a>, but July and August failed to contribute a big winner, leaving the space occupied by commercial auteur titles such as <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/148230/magic-mike\" title=\"\">Magic Mike</a> and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/141046/dark-knight-rises\" title=\"\">The Dark Knight Rises</a>.</p> <p>Now, however, arrives <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/145816/imposter\" title=\"\">The Imposter</a>, a plucky underdog contender delivering \u00a3345,000 over the four-day holiday weekend, including previews of \u00a329,000, from just 49 sites. Joint distributors Revolver and Picturehouse report sold-out shows in the Clapham and Hackney Picturehouses and Ritzy Brixton, in London, and in other cities such as Brighton, Norwich, Exeter and Bath. Bart Layton's true-crime investigation has benefited from a much more aggressive release strategy in the UK than has been the case in the US, where a gradual rollout has seen it accrue $386,000 after seven weeks of play. With a screen average there running at a so-so $3,350 for the current weekend, it's hard to envisage any significant US expansion, whereas, in the UK, further bookings are a dead cert.</p> <p>Top documentary opening for the year so far is <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/148279/katy-perry\" title=\"\">Katy Perry: Part of Me</a>, with \u00a3449,000 including \u00a391,000 in previews, but that was from a release on 326 screens, and concert movies arguably exist in a separate category. Excluding concert films, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/145816/imposter\" title=\"\">The Imposter</a> has achieved the biggest debut for a documentary since <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/141505/senna\" title=\"\">Senna</a> roared off with \u00a3375,000 including \u00a327,000 in previews last summer. Senna's eventual lifetime tally of \u00a33.17m will likely prove too lofty a goal for The Imposter, but the film should have no problem besting the likes of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/146456/marley\" title=\"\">Marley</a> (\u00a3958,000), <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/125351/man.on.wire\" title=\"\">Man on Wire</a> (\u00a3879,000) and maybe even the Perry doc (\u00a31.17m). It all depends now on the strength of audience word, and the twin distributors will take heart that grosses rose over the four-day period, building to Monday's \u00a394,000.</p> <p>Unsurprisingly, Picturehouse programmed <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/145816/imposter\" title=\"\">The Imposter</a> enthusiastically in its own sites, and achieved a 35.5% market share on the title. Cineworld, which has a reputation for an arthouse-friendly programming mix, came second with 21.6% of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/145816/imposter\" title=\"\">The Imposter</a>'s gross. Top site was Curzon Soho, in London, with \u00a314,359 for the three days and \u00a320,216 including Monday. The picture expands to 75 cinemas from Friday. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/145816/imposter\" title=\"\">The Imposter</a> beat rival upscale offering <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/145818/shadow-dancer\" title=\"\">Shadow Dancer</a>, an IRA drama that straddled the arthouse-mainstream divide. Released on 168 prints, the Clive Owen/Andrea Riseborough picture managed \u00a3201,000 from Friday to Sunday, and \u00a3288,000 including the holiday Monday.</p> <h2>The lowbrow hit</h2> <p>The weekend offered a study in contrasts with another British production, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/148902/keith-lemon\" title=\"\">Keith Lemon: The Film</a>, also arriving in cinemas. While <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/145816/imposter\" title=\"\">The Imposter</a> was screened aggressively to critics, achieving <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2012/aug/23/the-imposter-review\" title=\"\">many five-star endorsements</a>, the Keith Lemon picture was protected from critical judgment for as long as possible, before the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2012/aug/23/keith-lemon-film-review\" title=\"\">inevitable one-star responses rained down on it</a>. And while grosses for <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/145816/imposter\" title=\"\">The Imposter</a> steadily climbed day by day throughout the holiday weekend, Keith Lemon went in the opposite direction \u2013 although, in fairness, on Monday it faced additional competition from newly arrived comedy <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/148836/watch\" title=\"\">The Watch</a>. Overall, Keith Lemon opened with a respectable \u00a31.20m over the Friday-to-Sunday weekend, and \u00a31.53m including bank holiday Monday, enough for fifth place. Keith Lemon convincingly beat rival comedy <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/147184/three-stooges\" title=\"\">The Three Stooges</a>, which managed \u00a3353,000 over the three-day weekend, which rises to \u00a3509,000 including previews, and to \u00a3683,000 including Monday's takings.</p> <p>When backers Lionsgate announced an 24 August release date for <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/148902/keith-lemon\" title=\"\">Keith Lemon: The Film</a>, comparisons with <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/142846/inbetweeners-movie\" title=\"\">The Inbetweeners Movie</a> (out 19 August last year) were inevitable, since they are both spin-offs from UK TV comedies. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/142846/inbetweeners-movie\" title=\"\">The Inbetweeners Movie</a> opened with an attention-grabbing \u00a313.22m, including \u00a34.57m in previews.</p> <h2>The chart champ</h2> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/146821/brave\" title=\"\">Brave</a>, suffering a modest drop of 9% from the previous weekend, convincingly held on to the top spot, and, including the Monday holiday, has achieved a healthy \u00a314.4m. The Pixar flick has one more week before kids return to school, by which time it should have overtaken the studio's lowest-performing hits <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/113137/cars\" title=\"\">Cars</a> (\u00a316.5m) and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/142460/cars-2\" title=\"\">Cars 2</a> (\u00a315.6m). It should also become Disney's biggest family flick this year, beating <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/145286/muppets\" title=\"\">The Muppets</a> (\u00a316.8m).</p> <p>Many titles achieved similarly robust holds, notably <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/141046/dark-knight-rises\" title=\"\">The Dark Knight Rises</a> (slipping 9%), <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/148529/diary-of-a-wimpy-kid\" title=\"\">Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Dog Days</a> (down 8%) and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/148325/ice-age-4\" title=\"\">Ice Age 4: Continental Drift</a> (off 5%). Bucking the trend was <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/148845/expendables-2\" title=\"\">The Expendables 2</a>, with a 34% fall.</p> <h2>The record breaker</h2> <p>A week ago, this column reported that <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/141046/dark-knight-rises\" title=\"\">The Dark Knight Rises</a> had overtaken <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/122806/dark.knight\" title=\"\">The Dark Knight</a> to be the biggest ever Batman flick at the UK box-office. Now it has passed <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/147193/avengers-assemble\" title=\"\">Avengers Assemble</a> (\u00a351.8m) to become the biggest hit of 2012. With \u00a353.1m so far, Christopher Nolan's film is now the 13th biggest of all time in the UK, beaten by, in no particular order, three Harry Potter films, the three Lord of the Rings films, Avatar, Toy Story 3, Titanic, Mamma Mia!, The Phantom Menace and Casino Royale. The UK is relatively unusual in the particular success of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/141046/dark-knight-rises\" title=\"\">The Dark Knight Rises</a>. In most other territories worldwide, the more family-friendly Marvel film has played to a broader and bigger audience.</p> <p>Also continuing its ascent in the UK is Seth Macfarlane's <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/148370/ted\" title=\"\">Ted</a>, now the fourth biggest hit of 2012, behind just <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/141046/dark-knight-rises\" title=\"\">The Dark Knight Rises</a>, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/147193/avengers-assemble\" title=\"\">Avengers Assemble</a> and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/148325/ice-age-4\" title=\"\">Ice Age 4</a>. Adding another \u00a32.2m over the four-day weekend for a total to date of more than \u00a326m, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/148370/ted\" title=\"\">Ted</a> looks headed for a final tally north of \u00a330m.</p> <h2>The future</h2> <p>With not much fresh material arriving in the market, the weekend was an unsurprising 30% down on the equivalent frame from 2011, when <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/142846/inbetweeners-movie\" title=\"\">The Inbetweeners Movie</a> spent a second week at the top spot, one place ahead of highest new entrant <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/141706/one-day\" title=\"\">One Day</a>. This week, a mixed bag of treats arrives for the dog days of summer, including Ben Stiller comedy <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/148836/watch\" title=\"\">The Watch</a>, which landed Monday, Colin Farrell in a remake of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/148835/total-recall\" title=\"\">Total Recall</a>, an Aussie twist on <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/130311/hangover\" title=\"\">The Hangover</a> called A Few Best Men, horror title <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/147610/the-possession\" title=\"\">The Possession</a>, and the self-explanatory <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/148919/cockneys-vs-zombies\" title=\"\">Cockneys vs Zombies</a>.

  "<p>The scenes from a parched field near Rustenburg of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/aug/17/south-african-police-shot-miners\" title=\"\">well-armed police officers opening fire on miners</a> waving spears and clubs has cast South Africa in a new light \u2013 that of a land of lowly citizens, kept in check by a distant elite of government ministers, and their friends in industry and the trade unions.</p> <p>If South African democracy is real, then the massacre at Lonmin's Marikana platinum mine should put nationalisation \u2013 or \"resource nationalism\" as it is has been coyly renamed by the ruling African National Congress (ANC) \u2013 back on the political agenda. It should not do so to humour the \"anything but [President Jacob] Zuma\" wing of the ANC but simply because there is an urgent need to address underdevelopment in a sector that employs 1 million people.</p> <p>\"The state of mining has not improved much since apartheid,\" says the development economist Margaret Chitiga-Mabugu of the Human Sciences Research Council (HSRC). \"The mining charter requires the companies to do more than they do but the follow-up is just not there, which is a failing of the department of mineral resources.\"</p> <p>A judicial commission appointed by Zuma will investigate the killing of 34 miners on 16 August and the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/aug/14/south-africa-lonmin-platinum-mine-clashes\" title=\"\">deaths in the preceding week at Marikana</a> of two police officers and eight strikers. The short timeline implied in the commission's remit is in danger of inviting an outcome that blames trade union rivalry, slaps Lonmin gently on the wrist and condemns police excesses.</p> <p>But a bigger picture of the South African mining sector shows the problems run far deeper. Coincidentally, on the eve of the Marikana tragedy, the church-funded <a href=\"http://www.bench-marks.org.za/\" title=\"\">Bench Marks Foundation</a> \u2013 which studies corporate social responsibility programmes \u2013 painted a grim picture of misery, death, poverty, illness and environmental damage in the world's richest platinum deposits in North West province.</p> <p>Its report, <a href=\"http://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=communities%20in%20the%20platinum%20minefields&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;ved=0CCMQFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bench-marks.org.za%2Fresearch%2Frustenburg_review_policy_gap_final_aug_2012.pdf&amp;ei=19g8ULr-F8q60QXxwoHYDw&amp;usg=AFQjCNHobtdDtZPDhRasF3k-GhRy-bz2yA&amp;cad=rja\" title=\"\">Communities in the Platinum Minefields</a>, says platinum mining operations at Marikana \"include high levels of fatalities\" and that the \"residential conditions under which Lonmin employees live are appalling\".</p> <p>This was not news to the 25,000 miners at Marikana. Those who charged the police on 16 August had emerged from the Wonderkop settlement, where up to seven people sleep in each shack, and share taps and hot-wired electricity. Just as under apartheid, the residents are migrant workers and the settlement is a hotbed of social problems. These ill-educated men, mining one of the world's most expensive minerals for a net monthly payment of less than 5,000 rand (\u00a3380), had entrusted their lives to a healer who claimed his witchcraft would disable the police's firearms.</p> <p>Running what is effectively a single-party democracy, the ANC has the luxury of being able to be both for and against nationalisation at the same time. The ANC in government \u2013 supported by the National Union of Mineworkers \u2013 squirms at the concept, treating it as the \"loony\" machinations of ousted Youth League leader <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/julius-malema\" title=\"\">Julius Malema</a>. Just two weeks before the Marikana killings, Zuma told diplomats \"blanket nationalisation\" was not government policy.</p> <p>The trouble is that most South Africans want to own their subsoil. The government's plea that it cannot afford the estimated 1 trillion rand needed to buy out the private sector is compromised because senior ANC figures draw substantial dividends from their investments in Lonmin and other companies. At a policy conference in June \u2013 called to set the stage for the December conference at which Zuma is expected to seek re-election as party president \u2013 six out of nine ANC provinces were in favour of mine seizures.</p> <p>\"Marikana has put nationalisation back on the agenda,\" says Chitiga-Mabugu, one of the authors of HSRC's report <a href=\"http://anc.org.za/docs/discus/2012/sims.pdf\" title=\"\">State Intervention in the Minerals Sector</a>, commissioned by the ANC. It looks at resource management in countries such as Norway, Botswana, Angola and Chile, and rules out wholesale nationalisation for South Africa.</p> <p>But the report calls for a decisive state role in the sector: reviews of existing licences, a broadened tax regime, the closure of loopholes for under-reporting, and real strategies that would maximise the development benefits of South Africa's vast mineral wealth \u2013 including training and spinoff \"beneficiation\" industries.</p> <p>The HSRC report does not scapegoat the mining companies but points to deep governance flaws. It warns that little will be achieved without one major political change: the partners in government \u2013 the ANC, the Communist party and the Confederation of South African Trade Unions \u2013 need to start pulling in the same direction on economic policy.</p> <p>\"South Africa could have realised maximum benefit from its mines long ago, but over the years the priorities of the players have not been aligned,'' said Chitiga-Mabugu.</p> <p>The direction South Africa takes in the wake of the Marikana killings will tell us both about the past and the future. It will show whether the 18 years since the end of apartheid have been part of an uplifting journey of transformation driven by committed politicians or whether they have simply consolidated a marriage of convenience between black liberation fighters and white captains of industry.</p>",

Not because it looks like a hopelessly generic horror film. Not because the poster appears to have been put together by someone's drunk auntie falling face-first onto a laptop while Photoshop happened to be open. It's because, according to its poster, Hold Your Breath is actually called #holdyourbreath. That's right, it's the world's first hashtag movie. This, without question, already makes #holdyourbreath the worst film ever made.</p> <p>But can #holdyourbreath really be as bad as its title suggests? It's the first theatrically-released film from The Asylum, the production team behind Mega Shark v Giant Octopus, Two-Headed Shark Attack and Milf, so there's a good chance it will be. Or maybe the title is just an unfortunate marketing decision that damages an otherwise perfectly good film. Let's pick through #holdyourbreath's trailer to see which is true \u2026</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395351963\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2012/8/28/1346151798041/Still-from-Holdyourbreath-008.jpg\" alt=\"Still from #Holdyourbreath 1 \" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\"> </span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p> <strong>1)</strong> The #holdyourbreath trailer begins, as many horror films do, with some youngsters about to embark on a #campingtrip.

To quote this young lady: \"Sometimes when a really evil person dies, they're forced to roam around the cemetery that they're buried in searching for souls to possess. When you drive past a cemetery you have to hold your breath or else they can possess you.\" Not only is that a needlessly complicated plot, but it's also about 50 characters too long for it to fit on Twitter, let alone be a hashtag. #Rubbishpremisefortwitter.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395351966\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2012/8/28/1346153555798/Still-from-Holdyourbreath-008.jpg\" alt=\"Still from #Holdyourbreath 4\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\"> </span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p> <strong>4)</strong> By the way, this is the really evil person who happened to be buried in the cemetery the youngsters passed \u2013 you can tell he's evil by all the #jamonhisface. But it's OK, because holding your breath as you pass a cemetery is such a pointlessly obscure myth that several thousand people must previously have driven past that exact cemetery without even thinking about it. There's no way these youngsters could possibly be the first people ever to go past the cemetery without holding their breath. I mean, without #holdingtheirbreath.

I know how she feels. Every time I write #holdyourbreath, I can feel a piece of my soul wither up and die.

So what is this film supposed to be called? Is it Hold Your Breath? Is it #holdyourbreath? Is it #Hold Your Breath? There aren't any rules any more. Does The Asylum even know what a hashtag is?

  "<p>Low-lying areas in south-east Louisiana faced serious flooding on Wednesday as Hurricane Isaac began to slowly move inland and towards New Orleans.</p> <p>After making landfall on Tuesday night in extreme south-eastern Louisiana, Isaac remained stationary for several hours, unleashing 80mph winds on a sparsely populated neck of land that stretches into the Gulf of Mexico. Early on Wednesday it started moving towards New Orleans at around eight miles an hour \u2013 exactly seven years after the city was devastated by Hurricane Katrina.</p> <p>Floodwater has already lapped over an 18-mile (29km) stretch of the levee along the Mississippi river in Plaquemines Parish, south-east of the city, threatening serious flooding.</p> <p>There were reports of four-to-nine feet of water in the streets, houses flooded and perilous attempts to flee. Sheriffs' deputies made house-to-house visits looking for residents who had remained after an evacuation order.</p> <p>\"Say prayers: Plaquemines Parish has decided to attempt a roof rescue despite conditions that should prohibit it. #ToughChoices,\" tweeted <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JenHale504/status/240751839325347840\" title=\"\">local reporter Jen Hales</a>.</p> <p>Billy Nungesser, the president of the coastal Plaquemines Parish, said the 3-metre levees had not yet collapsed, but warned that roads in the area were already impassable, hindering the evacuation of the few remaining residents.</p> <p>\"As that water flows over the top, it eventually will eat out portions of that levee, which then it washes away. Either that or the inside of the levee will fill up. One or the other will happen. Either way that area's going to be totally inundated with water,\" he told CNN.</p> <p>Gene Oddo, trapped by floodwaters in his attic with his family in Braithwaite, part of Plaquemines Parish, said the water appeared to have stopped rising. \"I'm not scared. I ain't scared of anything. It looks like it's stabilising,\" he told local TV channel 4WWL. Oddo said at least three neighbouring families were also trapped. Weather experts said the storm was slowly moving westwards from Plaquemines.</p> <p>Ryan Bernie, a spokesman for the city of New Orleans, said the storm had caused only minor street flooding before dawn and felled trees but had left roughly 125,000 people without power.</p> <p>The National Hurricane Center had warned in its 5pm ET update that Isaac was getting better organised as it neared south-east Louisiana. The hurricane had picked up force, with maximum sustained winds measured at 80mph.</p> <p>President Barack Obama signed emergency declarations for Louisiana and parts of Mississippi and warned against overconfidence. \"We're dealing with a big storm and there could be significant flooding and other damage across a large area. Now is not the time to tempt fate. Now is not the time to dismiss warnings,\" he said.</p> <p>Speaking in Mississippi, Craig Fugate, head of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, warned the storm was moving slowly and that heavy rains could cause inland flooding. \"This is not just a storm for the coastal counties,\" Fugate said.</p> <p>The governor of Louisiana, Bobby Jindal, said the storm's slow speed of 10mph meant some areas of New Orleans would experience six to 10 hours of hurricane-force winds and that storm surges could top 10ft. He said 41 parishes had declared emergencies, and seven were at least partially evacuated.</p> <p>Seven years almost to the day after Katrina hit, New Orleans was hoping that $14.5bn-worth of civil works \u2013 a 133-mile chain of levees, flood walls, gates and pumps \u2013 would avert another catastrophe.</p> <p>Mitch Landrieu, the mayor of New Orleans, did not order an evacuation of the city, but those living outside the levee system were strongly encouraged to leave. \"We don't expect a Katrina-like event, but remember there are things about a category one storm that can kill you,\" Landrieu said.</p> <p>In the lower ninth ward, a sprawl of largely ramshackle one- and two-storey homes, which were hit hard by Katrina, appeared abandoned at first glance. St Claude Avenue, the main drag, was empty.</p> <p>But as the sky turned an ominous metallic grey, you could find those who had stayed behind. \"You need money to leave,\" said Scott McMorris, 47, a mechanic. \"A lot of people can't afford to run. You either pay your bills or you run. Can't do both.\"</p> <p>Further up the street, bunkered in his home, was Gregory Richardson, 56, a retired oil rig worker with rheumatism. He had stocked up on water, ice, batteries and tinned food. He would have left, he said, but didn't have the cash. \"My social welfare comes on the third of the month. If it came this week I wouldn't be here talking to you now.\"</p> <p>He narrowly survived Katrina in 2005, which killed 1,800 people after the levees broke in the storm surges that followed the hurricane. \"It was madness. I was rescued after four days by the army.\" He prayed Isaac would be more merciful. As he spoke the wind opened and slammed shut his front door.</p> <p>Mandatory evacuations were ordered for St Charles Parish and parts of Jefferson Parish and Plaquemines Parish: low-lying regions outside the city's defences.</p> <p>About 7,000 Plaquemines residents out of the population of 23,000 were ordered to evacuate, and many of those who could not or would not leave town were holed up in a well-preserved old hall with gold-painted chandeliers and ceiling fans. Folding beds were arranged in neat rows and seats faced a flat-screen television and a kitchen; naval officers and police looked on</p> <p>\"This building holds 80, next building 200, the backup location which we've overflowed to we have a capacity of 200. We're already pretty full. We're at 340,\" Gina Meyer, the superintendent of emergency medical services, said on Tuesday.</p> <p>One resident, 21-year-old Joseph Buras, was sanguine about the risks. \"The worst it's probably going to get is 90mph winds, so people aren't in so much of a panic as they normally would. Then again the fear of Katrina is still in a lot of people's hearts. So when they heard a hurricane was coming they just hauled it,\" he said. \"We've survived the worst, this isn't the worst.\"</p> <p>Back in the lower ninth, others stayed because they trusted the repaired and fortified levees would withstand whatever Isaac threw at them. The bolder ones intended to enjoy nature's show.</p> <p>Darrel Walters, 48, and Kerwin Brown, 50, watched an exodus of neighbours with nonchalance, perching on chairs in their yard, bare-chested, smoking and sipping Budweiser. \"We got some medicine right here,\" said Walters, tapping his beer.</p>",
  "<p>Social entrepreneurship often focuses on finding solutions to problems in the developing world. But, as the European Union battles with the ongoing recession and the US experiences rising levels of poverty, social enterprise solutions are increasingly appropriate in advanced industrial countries as well.</p> <p>Thane Kreiner, executive director of the <a href=\"http://www.scu.edu/socialbenefit/index.cfm\" title=\"\">Centre for Science, Technology, and Society</a> at Santa Clara University, says that reverse innovation could one day \"help us fix what's broken in our own backyard.\"</p> <p>\"Some innovations that social entrepreneurs are bringing to the developing world help alleviate conditions of poverty, like lack of access to electricity for lighting. But some of the solutions would be extremely beneficial for us to adopt in the developed world,\" he says.</p> <p>\"If you can serve the poor profitably, you can disrupt existing markets.\"</p> <p>Healthcare has great potential for reverse innovation, especially as costs soar ever higher, says Kreiner.</p> <p>\"The kind of learning that we see can inform ways that could really transform delivery of services and goods that right now are quite expensive.\"</p> <p>The US government spends more than any other OECD country on its healthcare system, even though the World Health Organisation has ranked it 37th in performance.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.aravind.org/\" title=\"\">Aravind Eye Care System</a> established by Govindappa Venkatswamy in India in 1976, has performed 4 million operations thanks to its \"McDonald's-style\" high volume assembly, says Kreiner.</p> <p>Aravind also developed the intra-ocular lens, manufactured by its subsidiary, Aurolab, at a fraction of the cost of imports.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.salauno.com.mx/\" title=\"\">SalaUno</a>, a for-profit social enterprise based in San Francisco, has now replicated the Aravind model in Mexico. Over the past year, SalaUno has carried out 133 cataract operations a month - free of charge for those who cannot afford the treatment.</p> <p>SalaUno is one of 160 social enterprises in the global social benefit incubator (GSBI) programme based at Santa Clara University in the heart of Silicon Valley.</p> <p>Last week, 19 social entrepreneurs arrived at the university for intensive in-residence coaching and lectures from some of Silicon Valley's big names such as Geoffrey Moore, author of the tech entrepreneur's rulebook, Crossing the Chasm.</p> <p>Since the programme began 10 years ago, 90% of the social enterprises are still going and have benefited about 74 million people, says Kreiner.</p> <p>\"Social benefit is a necessary predecessor to economic growth,\" he says. \"Almost always it provides employment opportunities for people in those communities and acts as nuclei for economic growth.\"</p> <p>GSBI is funded by a Skoll Foundation grant and corporate gifts from Deloitte, Microsoft and Applied Materials. But the real \"secret sauce\" is the pool of high-calibre mentors from Silicon Valley, says Kreiner.</p> <p>Executives from blue chip companies such as Cisco and Intel volunteer their coaching services for the social entrepreneurs in the four months leading up to the Clara University residency.</p> <p>Ten out of the 19 on the GSBI programme are women, part of an encouraging trend, says Kreiner.</p> <p>\"The rise of women in social entrepreneurship and leadership is striking. We're also seeing more sophistication, higher levels of education.\"</p> <p>Shivani Siroya founded InVenture, an SMS-based accounting tool for<br>low-income individuals and businesses and pioneered a credit-scoring standard for clients that conventional financial institutions would deem unbankable.</p> <p><a href=\"http://inventure.org/\" title=\"\">InVenture</a> now has more than 5,000 users and has made 2,000 loans with an average size of $2,000 (\u00a31,200). It is now expanding operations in Africa, where another SMS-based service, M-Pesa in Kenya, now processes 25% of the country's GDP via text message, bypassing conventional banks.</p> <p>Such ventures enable the poor to access services that would otherwise be price prohibitive, says Kreiner.</p> <p>\"Even in the US, one of the most ridiculous \"poverty premiums\" is for loans where it becomes too expensive to borrow money to lift yourself out of poverty,\" he says.</p> <p>Other examples of \"reverse innovation\" on microfinance enterprises that started in the developing world and then identified a similar need in the US are Kiva, Grameen and Samasource, which is launching SamaUSA later this year.</p> <p>\"The poverty level in the US continues to climb, and Europe suffers from an ongoing recession,\" says Kreiner. \"As we search for avenues out of the economic crisis, the innovations of social enterprises like Samasource, Kiva and Grameen and their experiences of developing world poverty could help us fix what's broken in our own backyard.\"</p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by </strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/guardian-professional\" title=\"Guardian Professional\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

  "<p>Some weeks ago, the staff at a small charity in Newcastle-upon-Tyne realised that a 10% cut in their council grant meant they could no longer afford to offer traditional holiday activities to the 60 or so children of homeless families for whom they provide a summer play scheme.</p> <p>So the charity improvised. Out went the visits to the seaside or the City farm; in came hand-made Jubilee or Olympic-themed activities in the park that cost practically nothing. Not quite so much of a treat, maybe, but still fun.</p> <p>But the trips to the park didn't solve a more profound problem caused by the funding cut: how to provide a summer's worth of breakfast and lunch to the deprived and hungry children on the play scheme?</p> <p>During term time, the youngsters received a free school breakfast and a free school meal. In past years the charity, <a href=\"http://www.children-ne.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Children North East</a>, had used a small part of the activities budget to ensure that during the school holidays the kids were fed at the play scheme. Now that safety net was gone.</p> <p>Asking the parents for a contribution was not an option. Many of the children's parents were \"refused\" asylum seekers: they neither qualified for welfare benefits, nor were they allowed to work. In the jargon, they had <a href=\"http://www.bridgesprogrammes.org.uk/images/public_funds.pdf\" title=\"\">\"No Recourse To Public Funds\"</a>. In practical terms they literally had no income at all.</p> <p>So the charity's 60 staff responded in the way that charity workers do when there is no alternative, and nowhere else to turn. They put their hands in their pocket and paid for the children's lunches themselves.</p> <p>The staff set up what in effect was a mini-food bank scheme. They bought \"a little extra\" in their weekly family shopping trip, and used it to stock up the charity's new \"pantry\": pasta, baked beans, bread. Not the most nutritious or varied of menus but one that at least \"kept the children feeling full.\" A local wholesale grocer, <a href=\"http://www.jrholland.co.uk/foodservices/index.html\" title=\"\">JR Holland</a>, donated fruit.</p> <p>Thus did the charity's workers heroically, and with great generosity, put food on the table for the children. Children North East's chief executive Jeremy Cripps is proud of his staff, but he holds no illusions that the situation is either fair, right or sustainable. Essentially, his staff picked up the tab because the State had done a runner.</p> <p>He eloquently <a href=\"http://childrennortheast.blogspot.co.uk/2012/07/passing-funding-buck-to-well-meaning.html\" title=\"\">describes on his blog</a> how this situation came about:</p> <blockquote> So here we have a Government without the humanity to care for very vulnerable people until they are deported by giving them even a minimal amount of money to feed their children; a local authority providing shelter for those families but forced to cut back on its spending by the Government; passing that cut on to a charity which too has to economise; the buck passes to the charity's staff who cannot stand by and do nothing while in daily contact with children in basic need of food; so they take it upon themselves to make sure children do not go hungry. </blockquote> <p>Soon the children will be back at school, and the local education system (aided by the <a href=\"http://www.greggsfoundation.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Greggs Foundation</a>, which supplies free school breakfasts) will ensure they are fed. At least, until the next school holidays, when, unless Cripps can miraculously persuade a donor to stump up some cash, the staff-financed food bank will be resurrected.</p> <p>This is the way things will be from now on, suspects Cripps:</p> <blockquote> This is the reality of the so-called 'Big Society' in 'austerity Britain' </blockquote> <p>\u2022 Are you a charity or public services worker who has had to dip into their own pocket to help out clients as a result of funding cut backs?

  "<p>Yesterday was August 28th 2012. Remember that date. It marks the day when the world went raving mad.</p> <p>Three things of note happened. The first is that <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/aug/27/arctic-sea-ice-shrinks-lowest-extent\" title=\"\">a record Arctic ice melt had just been announced</a> by the scientists studying the region. The 2012 figure has not only beaten the previous record, established in 2007. It has beaten it three weeks before the sea ice is likely to reach its minimum extent. It reveals that global climate breakdown is proceeding more rapidly than most climate scientists expected. But you could be forgiven for missing it, as it scarcely made the news at all.</p> <p>Instead, in the UK, the headlines concentrated on <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/aug/28/david-cameron-taunted-tory-mp-heathrow\" title=\"\">the call by Tim Yeo</a>, chair of the parliamentary energy and climate change committee, for a third runway at Heathrow. This sparked a lively debate in and beyond the media about where Britain's new runways and airports should be built. The question of whether they should be built scarcely arose. Just as rare was any connection between the shocking news from the Arctic and this determination to increase our emissions of greenhouse gases.</p> <p>I wonder whether we could be seeing a form of reactive denial at work: people proving to themselves that there cannot be a problem if they can continue to discuss the issues in these terms.</p> <p>The third event was that the Republican party in the United States began its national convention in Tampa, Florida \u2013 a day late. Why? Because of the anticipated severity of hurricane Isaac, which reached the US last night.</p> <p>As Kevin Trenberth of the National Centre for Atmospheric Research, <a href=\"http://www.springerlink.com/content/0008xl84w0743102/fulltext.pdf\" title=\"\">noted earlier this year</a>:</p> <blockquote> \"Basic theory, climate model simulations, and empirical evidence all confirm that warmer climates, owing to increased water vapor, lead to more intense precipitation events even when the total annual precipitation is reduced slightly \u2026 all weather events are affected by climate change because the environment in which they occur is warmer and moister than it used to be.\" </blockquote> <p>(h/t: <a href=\"http://thinkprogress.org/climate/2012/08/27/747071/isaac-poised-to-torment-new-orleans-as-category-1-hurricane-on-anniversary-of-katrina/\" title=\"\">Joe Romm at Climate Progress</a>)</p> <p>The Republican party's leading lights either deny climate change altogether, or argue that people can adapt to whatever a changed climate may bring, so there's nothing to worry about.</p> <p>The deluge of reality has had no impact on the party's determination to wish the physical world away.

  "<p>The US looms large in much of the media coverage of Android and iOS. Google and Apple are both headquartered in Silicon Valley, as are plenty of well-funded startups and globally-recognised technology blogs.</p> <p>With 165m active iOS and Android devices in the US alone, it's also the world's biggest market for smartphone apps on these platforms. Yet the research that 165m figure is drawn from \u2013&#xa0;a <a href=\"http://blog.flurry.com/bid/88867/iOS-and-Android-Adoption-Explodes-Internationally\">study by mobile analytics firm Flurry</a> \u2013&#xa0;also makes it clear that there are opportunities well beyond the US for Android and iOS developers.</p> <p>Published earlier this week, the research is based on analytics data from 200k applications using Flurry's tools. The headline claim is that there were more than 640m Android and iOS devices in use during July 2012.</p> <p>The \"in use\" part is important, for Apple and Google's own figures tend to focus on sales (or activations, in Google's case) over the lifetime of their platforms. Apple <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2010/jun/07/apple-wwdc-iphone-announcement\">said in July 2012</a> that it had sold 410m iOS devices since the first iPhone's launch in 2007, while Google <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/global/2012/jun/27/google-i-o-keynote-google-tablet\">revealed in June 2012</a> that it had activated 400m Android devices.</p> <p>Flurry claims that its 165m active iOS and Android devices in July made the US the largest market in the world in terms of combined usage of the platforms \u2013&#xa0;it doesn't split them out \u2013&#xa0;ahead of China's 128m, the UK's 31m, South Korea's 28m and Japan's 22m.</p> <p>What's more interesting than the pure figures, though, is the wider trend. \"Year-over-year, Flurry calculates that net active devices in the U.S. grew by approximately 30 million, while China saw more than 100 million new active devices enter the market,\" explains Flurry's Peter Farago in the company's blog post.</p> <p>\"At this rate, China's active installed base could overtake the United States as early as the 2012 Holiday season.\"</p> <p>In fact, Flurry's separate chart of the fastest growing iOS and Android markets by active devices \u2013&#xa0;the one at the top of this article \u2013&#xa0;expands on this. China, Chile, Brazil, Argentina, Iran, Vietnam, Mexico, Russia, Turkey and India make up the top 10 \u2013&#xa0;all with more than half a million active devices in July 2011.</p> <p>\"Notably, all four BRIC countries (Brazil, Russia, India and China) are represented in the top 10-ten growth countries for smart devices, reinforcing their new stage of advanced economic development,\" wrote Farago.</p> <p>Or to put it another way: 165m active Android and iOS devices in the US is impressive, but add the BRIC countries together \u2013&#xa0;China (128m), Brazil (13m), India (11m) and Russia (9m) \u2013&#xa0;and you get 161m active devices just on these two platforms.</p> <p>Now think about potential growth. Another Flurry chart maps its active-user estimates against the adult populations of each country to gauge how near to saturation they are. It suggests that the US has 78% penetration of active iOS and Android devices, while the UK has 74%.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395352781\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/29/1346232456096/flurry-chart-penetration.jpg\" alt=\"Flurry penetration chart\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Are countries like the US and UK nearing saturation point? Source: Flurry</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This raises a red flag for me: three quarters of the UK population weren't using an Android or iOS device in July 2012. comScore stats <a href=\"http://www.comscore.com/Press_Events/Press_Releases/2012/5/EU5_Map_Usage_via_Smartphone_Growing\">published in May</a> suggest that overall smartphone penetration was 55% in March 2012, and that's a figure that includes BlackBerry, Windows Phone and Symbian.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Google's <a href=\"http://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/mobileplanet/en/graph/?country=uk&amp;category=DETAILS&amp;topic=DETAILS_PENET&amp;stat=PENET01&amp;wave=wave2&amp;age=all&amp;gender=all&amp;active=stat\">Our Mobile Planet research</a> suggests that 51% of the UK population currently owns a smartphone, with iOS and Android taking a 59% combined share of that 51%, rather than the population as a whole. Flurry's figures must include people with multiple devices \u2013&#xa0;an iPhone and an iPad, for example.</p> <p><strong>Update:</strong> I asked Flurry's Farago about this, and he points out that Flurry's penetration stats cover 15-64 year-old adults, rather than the entire population. \"For the UK, Flurry's penetration estimate against the total population, from infants to the truly venerable, comes in at 49%,\" he says, adding that the company sees \"not that large\" an overlap for multiple device ownership.</p> <p>Even so, its stats still hint at growth to come in those BRIC markets: 10% of the Chinese adult population are using an Android or iOS device according to Flurry \u2013&#xa0;presumably with the same multiple-device caveats \u2013&#xa0;while the penetration stands at 6% in Brazil and Russia, and 1% in India.</p> <p>A bonanza in store for app developers? Perhaps. But that bonanza may well come from startups and developers based in those countries who understand the markets and the business models required for success.</p> <p>Which is a long-winded way of saying the most interesting apps companies in the next five years are more likely to come from Brazil, Russia, India and China as Silicon Valley.</p> <p><em>Updated on 29 August 2012 with Flurry's response to the question of IOS and Android penetration among the general population.</em></p>",
  "<p>As he's the figurehead of Nigerian Afrobeats, it feels appropriate that D'Banj's debut UK headline show takes place on the final day of the Notting Hill carnival. Alongside the usual dancehall and soca, a good proportion of the anthems that fuelled this year's sound systems and floats are the hits that have propelled the rise of Afrobeats in the UK: Atumpan's The Thing, Ice Prince's Oleku and, of course, D'Banj's own Oliver Twist, a song of such popular reach that it even made it on to EastEnders.</p> <p>Keeping that carnival spirit going is&nbsp;D'Banj's MO tonight, as is that of a significant proportion of the audience, who have hotfooted it down the road from the carnival. As an entertainer, D'Banj treads the line between suave and rambunctious with ease: his dapper yellow-lapelled blazer is swiftly shed as he starts to rival his own dancers in snake-hipped, low-grinding ability, and the gold chain follows as he plunges off stage for a&nbsp;spot of crowd-surfing. By the show's climax, D'Banj is half-naked and essaying moves that seem to&nbsp;refer mostly to the title of&nbsp;his forthcoming album, Mr Endowed.</p> <p>After a late entrance compounded by&nbsp;technical difficulties leaves the crowd slightly restless, D'Banj may feel putting that level of&nbsp;work in is necessary \u2013 but it transpires that the music does the trick just as well. \"This is not a fluke,\" he announces midway through the show, perhaps mindful that not everyone present is aware of his seven-year career before Oliver Twist. Tonight, though, his older material goes down almost as well, from the call-and-response of Why&nbsp;Me to the lovelorn Scapegoat, and D'Banj bridges the gap between his more lilting, organic songs and his recent tougher, trancier dance-floor anthems with ease. His between-song patter has a tendency to ramble, but the show's culmination in&nbsp;Oliver Twist is stellar proof that an international hit can&nbsp;be engineered with&nbsp;ease&nbsp;if based around a resonant, inarguable statement such as \"I like&nbsp;Beyonc\u00e9\".</p>  <figure class=\"element element-audio\" data-canonical-url=\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\"> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?button_hashtag=GdnReview\" class=\"twitter-hashtag-button\">Tweet #GdnReview</a> <script>!function(d,s,id){var js,fjs=d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];if(!d.getElementById(id)){js=d.createElement(s);js.id=id;js.src=\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\";fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js,fjs);}}(document,\"script\",\"twitter-wjs\");</script> </figure>",
  "<p><em>Boneland</em> is an adult sequel to the two books for children <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/alangarner\" title=\"\">Alan Garner</a> published in 1960 and 1963. Colin and Susan, in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/unclassified/9780007355211/the-weirdstone-of-brisingamen\" title=\"\"><em>The Weirdstone of Brisingamen</em></a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/unclassified/9780007127870/the-moon-of-gomrath\" title=\"\"><em>The Moon of Gomrath</em></a>, are twins of about 12, rushing about on non-stop miraculous adventures and accepting supernatural events with almost superhuman placidity. At the end of the second book, Susan appears to be destined for an otherworldly fate or role. At the beginning of this third book, she has vanished. Her brother Colin has aged some 30 or 40 years, and their author nearly 50.</p> <p>Fifty years is a long time between books, yet it seems right and natural that Garner should need five decades to gyre back round to where he began, the legend-haunted landscape of Alderley Edge, to be able to follow his story deeper into the human psyche and the dark abysm of time.</p> <p>Colin has become a brilliant astrophysicist, ornithologist, and all-round savant with five or six masters' degrees, as well as being an outstanding cook, carpenter, and social misfit. He has total recall of everything that has happened to him since the age of 13, but has lost all memory of the years before that, along with his sister, and his intrepidity. The almost phlegmatically fearless child has become an anguished, supersensitive, self-absorbed man whose incoherent obsessions are driving him mad.</p> <p>Colin is searching for his sister and his sanity, but the wellbeing of the world is also at stake. The descendant of men who danced and sang on Alderley Edge to keep the stars in their courses and bring the sun back from winter death, Colin is a shaman, heir of the shamans of the ice age and ages long before. He needs to find his own balance because his job is to keep the balance of the world. The rocks and caves of a reef of Triassic sandstone in Cheshire are the axis of the balance, the navel of the universe, the centre that must hold.</p> <p>That centre is also in a cave in Delphi, an island in the Klamath River of California, a thousand places on Earth, and the Earth itself as revealed to the astronaut Rusty Schweickart on a walk in space \u2013 wherever human beings feel the depth of their connection to the world and take it as a sacred responsibility.</p> <p>Yet this universal connection is felt as deeply local. This place is the sacred place. More mythmaker than fantasist, Garner names his chosen, actual landscape minutely, feature by feature, stone by stone, relishing the old place-names and the grand vocabulary of geology, weaving the words into a litany of confirmation, the endless repetition that keeps the end from coming, the rhythmic dance on the world's edge that maintains the world. Alderley Edge is the scene of a timeless ritual that must be re-enacted over and over by ignorant and ephemeral mortals. Personal tragedy and redemption are subsumed in the cosmic vision.</p> <p>No wonder that the people of his story are less characters than masks, types, archetypes. But as imaginative literature reclaims the territories forbidden it by realism, and moves back from Elfland towards the outskirts of Manchester, it treads on risky ground. Readers looking for more than mere adventure expect characters whose behaviour and reactions are humanly comprehensible.</p> <p>The child twins Colin and Susan were semi-characterless actors in a fantasy tale. Colin is both severely disturbed radio-astronomer and the man chosen from his generation to \"look after the Edge\" \u2013 and how to reconcile these roles in a character in a modern novel? How are the pyschic sufferings of a man so anachronistically fated and so emotionally crippled to be made comprehensible?</p> <p>The author's success hinges partly on his division of the character into two \u2013 the 21st-century scientist Colin and an unnamed stone age ancestor. But in the end, his success must depend on the reader's willingness to be teased through an imaginative labyrinth by allusions, hints, puzzles, and tricks such as unascribed dialogue and undescribed location. The process of Colin's healing, the stages of therapy, the un-nesting of image within image, is fascinating, but the narration demands that the reader let the author manipulate and control, just as Colin is manipulated by the analyst.</p> <p>And she, in the end, appears to have been a witch or goddess: in a serious novel, this is again risky.</p> <p>Garner can count on the trust and admiration of many of his readers to see him through it, but my trust and admiration, though great, weren't always sufficient. No rereading has yet given me a clue to the meaning of the first eight lines of <em>Boneland</em>. Is the all-wise, wise-cracking, motorcycle-riding psychoanalyst the Witch-Crone or the Moon Mother? Is Susan one of the Pleiades? Is truth, as Garner would have it, not attainable through knowledge, only through belief?</p> <p>Where all the teases and all the risks pay off, for me, is in the shadow-story of the man who \"looked after the Edge\" so long ago, the solitary artist-shaman of the ice age. These sections of the book are told in a charged, elliptical, symbolic, highly concrete language: \"He cut the veil of the rock; the hooves clattered the bellowing waters below him in the dark. The lamp brought the moon from the blade, and the blade the bull from the rock. The ice rang.\"</p> <p>You figure out what it's all about gradually; as with poetry, learning another language, learning to see and think differently, the demands and rewards are intense and real. It is this element of the book, in which the obsessions come into focus and a true balance is glimpsed, that will bring me back to <em>Boneland</em>, knowing I'll find there what no other novelist has ever given us.</p> <p>\u2022 Ursula K Le Guin's <em>Lavinia</em> is published by Phoenix.</p>",

  "<p>In the midst of post-landing activities, and before setting off on its first substantial drive, Nasa's Mars rover Curiosity is using the scorch marks of its own landing to study the red planet's surface.</p> <p>Settling down to begin regular science activities on the floor of 150km-wide Gale Crater, Curiosity's operators have been testing the nuclear-powered vehicle's many science instruments, its driving capabilities, as well as its radio transmission abilities. Following short test drives last week, and the first extension of its robotic arm, more of the rover's instruments have been turned on and found to be working perfectly.</p> <p>Curiosity team members proudly presented on Monday an sample image taken by one of the rover's main scientific cameras. The colour camera, equipped with a 100mm focal length lens <a href=\"http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/msl/multimedia/images/?ImageID=4566\" title=\"\">to zoom in on fascinating features</a>, clearly reveals layered terrain up to 16km from the landing site. Curiosity is due to be driven around 10 metres to take another image of the same distant location, allowing a stereo picture of the hills to be created.</p> <p>These images of the foothills of Mount Sharp, at the centre of Gale Crater, immediately threw up a geological puzzle. They clearly consist of layered material, but while the lower strata within them are close to horizontal, <a href=\"http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/msl/multimedia/images/?ImageID=4559\" title=\"\">upper layers are inclined</a>. This suggests that the top strata were preferentially deposited in one direction, but identifying the process responsible, which could be volcanic or wind-driven, for example, may have to wait until Curiosity can visit the hills.</p> <p>Landing on 6 August, the rover descent stage's powerful rockets <a href=\"http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/msl/multimedia/images/?ImageID=4477\" title=\"\">scoured patches of the surface</a> while hovering over the landing spot, dislodging surface dust and possibly altering the surface material. On Monday, Curiosity was manoeuvred to park over one of these greyish scour features, which can even be seen from orbit.</p> <p>This unusual parking spot was chosen so that the rover's Russian-led Dynamic Albedo of Neutrons (DAN) instrument can bombard the soil under the rover with neutrons to measure the amount of hydrogen there, as a proxy for water and water ice.</p> <p>This is likely to be one of the few places that Curiosity will visit where the surface won't be covered by a layer of dust. The rover's laser-equipped ChemCam instrument will also probe the scour marks to determine their composition.</p> <p>The rover's operators have gradually been increasing the rate at which data is sent back to Earth. More than 7 gigabits of data have already been transmitted. The fastest way for Curiosity to send data is via the three spacecraft currently operating in orbit around Mars: the Nasa satellites Mars Odyssey and Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, and the European Space Agency's Mars Express.</p> <p>The fastest rates are achieved via MRO: when passing over the rover, Curiosity and the satellite also communicate via a second test communications channel, which allows the speed at which science data is broadcast to be increased to up to 2 megabits per second when conditions are good.</p> <p>One of the rover's unique instruments \u2013 the Sample Analysis at Mars (SAM) \u2013 has set about sniffing the makeup of Mars's atmosphere. Unexpected traces of methane \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/blog/2009/jan/15/mars-controversiesinscience\" title=\"\">a possible signature of life</a> \u2013 in first sample of gas caused great excitement back on Earth \u2026 until it was realised that a small amount of gas from Earth had been carried to Mars inside the instrument.</p> <p>One of the experiment's aims is to double-check measurements made by the Viking landers in 1976, measure isotope ratios in the atmosphere and attempt to detect methane. The latter is known to exist on Mars but its origin is currently a mystery.</p> <p>The rover will leave its landing site for good this week, first travelling at least 100 metres away so that it can sample surface material unaffected by its landing. It will then head for a spot named Glenelg, chosen as a target as it's the meeting point of three types of terrain.</p> <p>The ultimate goal for Curiosity will be the foothills of Mount Sharp where the layered terrain has been glimpsed, but it is unlikely to arrive for at least another year.</p> <p>The Curiosity team has also played from Mars <a href=\"http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/msl/news/whatsnew/index.cfm?FuseAction=ShowNews&amp;NewsID=1325\" title=\"\">an audio message</a> delivered by Nasa administrator Charles Bolden. Echoing Soviet broadcasts of the Internationale from the moon, this will be followed later on Tuesday by music recorded by will.i.am.</p> <p>In the words of Dave Lavery, Nasa Curiosity programme executive, with photographs, SAM data and audio signals being sent to Earth, for the first time we have \"the sounds, the sights, and the smells of Mars\".</p>",

A second landfall was expected overnight.</p> <p>As wind and rain intensified in New Orleans as the hurricane made landfall at the extreme southern part of the Plaquemines Parish region, mayor Mitch Landrieu held a press conference at 8pm ET. \"The message of this press conference is to let you know that your city is secure,\" he said. </p> <p>More road closures this afternoon have made leaving the city increasingly difficult. The mayor warned residents to stay indoors because of the risk of flying debris and flooding. \"We're in the hunker-down phase,\" he said.</p> <p>As of 10pm ET, Entergy Corp was reporting 150,000 were without power in south-eastern Louisiana. Most parts of New Orleans and the surrounding areas were expected to suffer power cuts overnight and into Wednesday afternoon.</p> <p>Billy Nungesser, the president of Plaquemines Parish on the coast south-east of New Orleans, said that water was lapping over the levee at the Mississippi River. He did not expect significant problems to develop as a result but said that the high water level was unexpected. </p> <p>\"It was scary to see. We were worried about the back levee, never the Mississippi river,\" he said.</p> <p>Nungesser added on WWLTV that the degree of damage to his house was reminiscent of Hurricane Katrina. \"Water has blown through the sockets in my back wall; that only happened in Katrina. My whole roof is leaking. I didn't get that kind of damage from anything but Katrina \u2013 [Isaac] seems a lot more than a category one,\" he said.</p> <p>The National Hurricane Center had warned in its 5pm ET update that Isaac was getting better organised as it neared southeastern Louisiana. Isaac had picked up force, with maximum sustained winds measured at 80mph.</p> <p>President Barack Obama signed emergency declarations for Louisiana and parts of Mississippi and warned against overconfidence. \"We're dealing with a big storm and there could be significant flooding and other damage across a large area. Now is not the time to tempt fate. Now is not the time to dismiss warnings,\" he said.</p> <p>Speaking in Mississippi, Craig Fugate, head of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, warned that the storm was slow moving and that heavy rains could cause inland flooding. \"This is not just a storm for the coastal counties,\" Fugate said.</p> <p>The Louisiana governor, Bobby Jindal, said the storm's slow speed of 10mph meant some areas of New Orleans would experience six to 10 hours of hurricane-force winds and that storm surges could top 10ft. He said 41 parishes had declared emergencies, and seven were at least partially evacuated. </p> <p>Seven years almost to the day after Katrina hit, New Orleans was hoping that that $14.5bn worth of civil works \u2013 a 133-mile chain of levees, flood walls, gates and pumps \u2013 would avert another catastrophe.</p> <p>Landrieu, the mayor, did not order an evacuation of the city, but those living outside the levee system were strongly encouraged to leave. \"We don't expect a Katrina-like event, but remember there are things about a category 1 storm that can kill you,\" Landrieu said.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/TQYrEEcgEJw?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/TQYrEEcgEJw\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>In the lower ninth ward, a sprawl of largely ramshackle one and two-storey homes that was hit hard by Katrina, appeared abandoned at first glance. St Claude Avenue, the main drag, was empty. </p> <p>But as the sky turned an ominous metallic grey, you could find those who had stayed behind. \"You need money to leave,\" said Scott McMorris, 47, a mechanic. \"A lot of people can't afford to run. You either pay your bills or you run. Can't do both.\" </p> <p>Further up the street, bunkered in his home, was Gregory Richardson, 56, a retired oil rig worker with rheumatism. He had stocked up on water, ice, batteries and tinned food. He would have evacuated, he said, but didn't have the cash. \"My social welfare comes on the third of the month. If it came this week I wouldn't be here talking to you now.\" </p> <p>He narrowly survived Katrina, which killed 1,800 people after the levees broke in the storm surges that followed the 2005 hurricane. \"It was madness. I was rescued after four days by the army\" \u2013 and prayed Isaac would be more merciful. As he spoke the wind opened and slammed shut his front door.</p> <p>Mandatory evacuations were ordered for St Charles Parish and parts of Jefferson Parish and Plaquemines Parish: low-lying regions outside the city's defenses.</p> <p>About 7,000 Plaquemines residents out of the population of 23,000 were ordered to evacuate, and many of those who could not or would not skip town <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/aug/28/isaac-lousisiana-faith-post-katrina\">were holed up in a well-preserved old hall</a> with gold-painted chandeliers and ceiling fans. Folding beds were arranged in neat rows and seats face a flat-screen television and a kitchen; naval officers and police looked on</p> <p>\"This building holds 80, next building 200, the backup location which we've overflowed to we have a capacity of 200. We're already pretty full. We're at 340,\" Gina Meyer, the superintendent of emergency medical services, said on Tuesday.</p> <p>One resident, 21-year-old Joseph Buras, was sanguine about the risks. \"The worst it's probably going to get is 90mph winds, so people aren't in so much of a panic as they normally would. Then again the fear of Katrina is still in a lot of people's hearts. So when they heard a hurricane was coming they just hauled it,\" he said. \"We've survived the worst, this isn't the worst.</p> <p>Back in the lower ninth, others stayed because they trusted the repaired and fortified levees would withstand whatever Isaac threw at them. The bolder ones intended to enjoy nature's show.</p> <p>Darrel Walters, 48, and Kerwin Brown, 50, watched an exodus of neighbours with nonchalance, perching on chairs in their yard, bare-chested, smoking and sipping Budweiser. \"We got some medicine right here,\" said Walters, tapping his beer.</p>",

On one side of the Gulf of Mexico every agency of government was being marshalled to prevent hurricane Isaac destroying New Orleans. On the other side in Tampa speaker after speaker at the Republican convention implored government to get out of the way because it was wrecking the country. Between them hovered the ghost of hurricane Katrina \u2013 an episode Republicans would rather forget, botched by a president they no longer mention. </p> <p>It was a night to address Republican vulnerabilities. For a party struggling to connect with women, almost half the speakers were female; in a campaign alienating African-Americans and Latinos where the overwhelming majority of delegates are white, roughly a third of the speakers were black and Hispanic.</p> <p>For a party with a nominee, Mitt Romney, the public has yet to warm to, there was his wife \u2013 Ann.</p> <p>To her fell the task of explaining why she fell in love with him in the hope that the nation might follow. Before a backdrop of family snaps going back to prom night she said she was not there to talk about politics, but love. After a lengthy, scarcely veiled swipe at the economic record of Obama \u2013 the man they love to hate \u2013 she swivelled back to Mitt: the man she lives to love.</p> <p>\"You should get to know him,\" she said. \"He made me laugh.\" When she was done, Mitt came on for a hug to the tune of My Girl.</p> <p>While Ann channelled her inner Oprah, the New Jersey governor, Chris Christie, channelled his inner Soprano. After explaining how his Sicilian mother taught him to talk plainly, he chose respect over love. While Ann vouched for Mitt as a man of empathy, Christie was supposed to vouch for his steadfast principle. In the end Christie vouched more for his own record in New Jersey than Romney's candidacy. With his barnstorming style and resolute oratory, by the end of the week his enduring legacy may prove to be the warm-up act that eclipsed the main event. </p> <p>But it was also a day rooted in deception. The theme was \"We Built That\" and dominated by testimony from small businessmen lambasting Obama for saying they did not build their businesses. To make that work they had to omit the middle of Obama's speech where he said: \"If you were successful, somebody along the line gave you some help. There was a great teacher somewhere in your life. Somebody helped to create this unbelievable American system that we have that allowed you to thrive. Somebody invested in roads and bridges.\"</p> <p>The evening closed with a prayer for those in the path of the hurricane. As the winds and rain bore down on Louisiana many prayed that the levees wouldn't fail. Who, one wonders, built those?</p>",
