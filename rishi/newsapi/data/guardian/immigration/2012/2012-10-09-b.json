  "<p>The transformation of Latin America is one of the decisive changes reshaping the global order. The tide of progressive change that has swept the region over the last decade has brought a string of elected socialist and social-democratic governments to office that have redistributed wealth and power, rejected western neoliberal orthodoxy, and challenged imperial domination. In the process they have started to build the first truly independent South America for 500 years and demonstrated to the rest of the world that there are, after all, economic and social alternatives in the 21st century.</p> <p>Central to that process has been Hugo Ch\u00e1vez and his <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bolivarian_Revolution\" title=\"\">Bolivarian revolution</a> in Venezuela. It is Venezuela, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/06/venezuela-election-result-oil-politics\" title=\"\">sitting on the world's largest proven oil reserves</a>, that has spearheaded the movement of radical change across Latin America and underwritten the regional integration that is key to its renaissance. By doing so, the endlessly vilified Venezuelan leader has earned the enmity of the US and its camp followers, as well as the social and racial elites that have called the shots in Latin America for hundreds of years.</p> <p>So Ch\u00e1vez's remarkable presidential election victory on Sunday \u2013 in which <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/interactive/2012/oct/09/venezuela-election-results-map-open-data\" title=\"\">he won 55% of the vote on an 81% turnout after 14 years in power</a> \u2013 has a significance far beyond Venezuela, or even Latin America. The stakes were enormous: if his oligarch challenger <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-19858755\" title=\"\">Henrique Capriles</a> had won, not only would the revolution have come to a juddering halt, triggering privatisations and the axing of social programmes. So would its essential support for continental integration, mass sponsorship of Cuban doctors across the hemisphere \u2013 as well as Ch\u00e1vez's plans to reduce oil dependence on the US market.</p> <p>Western and Latin American media and corporate elites had convinced themselves that they were at last in with a shout, that this election was \"too close to call\", or even that a failing Venezuelan president, weakened by cancer, would at last be rejected by his own people. Outgoing World Bank president <a href=\"http://www.businessweek.com/news/2012-06-08/world-bank-chief-zoellick-says-chavez-s-days-are-numbered\" title=\"\">Robert Zoellick crowed that Ch\u00e1vez's days were \"numbered\"</a>, while <a href=\"http://www.businessweek.com/news/2012-10-08/chavez-win-called-by-bofa-points-to-bond-rout-as-barclays-flops\" title=\"\">Barclays let its excitement run away with itself by calling the election for Capriles</a>.</p> <p>It's all of a piece with the endlessly recycled Orwellian canard that Ch\u00e1vez is some kind of a dictator and Venezuela a tyranny where elections are rigged and the media muzzled and prostrate. But as opposition leaders concede, Venezuela is by any rational standards a democracy, with exceptionally high levels of participation, its electoral process more fraud-proof than those in Britain or the US, and its media dominated by a vituperatively anti-government private sector. In reality, the greatest threat to Venezuelan democracy came in the form of the abortive <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2002/apr/21/usa.venezuela\" title=\"\">US-backed coup of 2002</a>.</p> <p>Even senior western diplomats in Caracas roll their eyes at the absurdity of the anti-Ch\u00e1vez propaganda in the western media. And in the queues outside polling stations on Sunday, in the opposition stronghold of San Crist\u00f3bal near the Colombian border, Capriles voters told me: \"This is a democracy.\" Several claimed that if Ch\u00e1vez won, it wouldn't be because of manipulation of the voting system but the \"laziness\" and \"greed\" of their fellow Venezuelans \u2013 by which they seemed to mean the appeal of government social programmes.</p> <p>Which gets to the heart of the reason so many got the Venezuelan election wrong. Despite claims that Latin America's progressive tide is exhausted, leftwing and centre-left governments continue to be re-elected \u2013 from Ecuador to Brazil and Bolivia to Argentina \u2013 because they have reduced poverty and inequality and taken control of energy resources to benefit the excluded majority.</p> <p>That is what Ch\u00e1vez has been able to do on a grander scale, using Venezuela's oil income and publicly owned enterprises to slash <a href=\"http://www.cepr.net/documents/publications/venezuela-2012-09.pdf\" title=\"\">poverty by half and extreme poverty by 70%</a>, massively expanding access to health and education, sharply boosting the minimum wage and pension provision, halving unemployment, and giving slum communities direct control over social programmes.</p> <p>To visit any rally or polling station during the election campaign was to be left in no doubt as to who Ch\u00e1vez represents: the poor, the non-white, the young, the disabled \u2013 in other words, the dispossessed majority who have again returned him to power. Euphoria at the result among the poor was palpable: in the foothills of the Andes on Monday groups of red-shirted hillside farmers chanted and waved flags at any passerby.</p> <p>Of course there is also no shortage of government failures and weaknesses which the opposition was able to target: from runaway violent crime to corruption, lack of delivery and economic diversification, and over-dependence on one man's charismatic leadership. And the <a href=\"http://transition.usaid.gov/performance/cbj/158267.pdf\" title=\"\">US-financed opposition campaign</a> was a much more sophisticated affair than in the past. Capriles presented himself as \"centre-left\", despite his hard right background, and promised to maintain some Chavista social programmes.</p> <p>But even so, the Venezuelan president ended up almost 11 points ahead. And the opposition's attempt to triangulate to the left only underlines the success of&#xa0;Ch\u00e1vez in changing Venezuela's society and political terms of trade. He has shown himself to be the most electorally successful radical left leader in history. His re-election now gives him the chance to ensure Venezuela's transformation is deep enough to survive him, to overcome the administration's failures and help entrench the process of change across the continent.</p> <p>Venezuela's revolution doesn't offer a political model that can be directly transplanted elsewhere, not least because oil revenues allow it to target resources on the poor without seriously attacking the interests of the wealthy. But its innovative social programmes, experiments in direct democracy and success in bringing resources under public control offer lessons to anyone interested in social justice and new forms of socialist politics in the rest of the world.</p> <p>For all their problems and weaknesses, Venezuela and its Latin American allies have demonstrated that it's no longer necessary to accept a failed economic model, as many social democrats in Europe still do. They have shown it's possible to be both genuinely progressive and popular. Cynicism and media-fuelled ignorance have prevented many who would naturally identify with Latin America's transformation from recognising its significance. But Ch\u00e1vez's re-election has now ensured that the process will continue \u2013 and that the space for 21st-century alternatives will grow.</p> <p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/SeumasMilne\" title=\"\"><em>@SeumasMilne</em></a></p>",
  "<p>Austrian daredevil Felix Baumgartner's attempt to parachute to earth from the edge of space has been postponed for at least 48 hours after gusty winds in New Mexico hampered the launch of the balloon that would take him skywards.</p> <p>Baumgartner, a 43-year-old former soldier, was aiming to jump from 23 miles above the Earth in a specially pressurised suit, plummetting to the ground at speeds that would break the sound barrier before he triggers his parachute.</p> <p>Team spokeswoman Sarah Anderson later said no new launch attempt would be made before Thursday. She said Wednesday had been ruled out due to further weather concerns and to give the mission's support crew a day off.</p> <p>The stunt, if successful, would break five world records. Baumgartner would become the first human to ever break the sound barrier in free-fall; make the highest free-fall altitude jump, ride the highest manned balloon flight and longest free-fall and his jump platform is believed to be the largest manned balloon in history.</p> <p>Baumgartner has made a name for himself with acts of derring-do. The former paratrooper, known as \"Fearless Felix\" for reasons that need no explanation, has parachuted off buildings and mountains and once into a 600 foot deep cave. Baumgartner had already done two practise freefalls \u2013 one from 71,000 feet in March this year and a second from 97,000 feet in July.</p> <p>Tuesday's jump was due to take place far above an airfield near the town of Roswell, which is famous for its UFO sighting. All had appeared well as Baumgartner donned his special suit, climbed into the capsule and then waited for the balloon to inflate. \"I am strapped into the capsule and I am ready to go,\" he had told the stunt's mission control team.</p> <p>However, as the slivery balloon began to be inflated it was buffeted by heavy winds and the mission was postponed. Baumgartner, whose attempt is sponsored and run by the caffeinated drinks brand Red Bull, had postponed his first attempt on Monday, also after high winds.</p> <p>There was, unsurprisingly, little sign that he was contemplating giving up. On the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RedBullStratos\">mission's official Twitter feed</a>, Baumgartner issued a simple statement promising the attempt would go ahead at some stage. \"It's all about what we do now and accomplish now. We've made it so far, there's no way turning back,\" he said.</p> <p>If successful Baumgartner's feat will raise the prospect that stricken astronauts might be able to survive a disaster of the type that hit the space shuttle Columbia in 2003 by actually bailing out of their craft. Baumgartner's top medical man in the stunt is Dr Jonathan Clark, whose wife Laurel Clark died in the Columbia accident. Clark is now dedicated to improving astronauts' chances of survival in a high-altitude disaster.</p>",
  "<p>Strange, isn't it, but Neil O'Brien's advice to the prime minister is exactly the same advice that Ed Miliband needs (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/oct/05/conservatives-new-workers-party\" title=\"\">A new party of the workers</a>, 6 October). The starting point is the tough views that voters, and particularly Labour voters, have on crime, welfare and immigration. O'Brien sees a programme which propels these issues to the fore as one that could win, for the Tories, the blue-collar votes in the Midlands and the north. But the same approach could deliver for Labour in the south, while holding our vote elsewhere. I do not, however, believe this will be enough. We need to also present credible plans to the electorate. And part of this will be to devise policies which deal with the causes of issues rather than their symptoms.</p> <p>In my own area of interest, on poverty for example, we need to put in place a strategy which ensures that today's poor children do not automatically grow up to become poor adults. Poor children's life chances are largely determined before they enter school. If the causes of poverty are to be addressed, so that poor children do not automatically become poor adults, we must address, before children go to school the lifetime inequalities which schools have proved powerless to combat. Only with both approaches will Labour reap the rewards of a general election victory in 2015.<br><strong>Frank Field MP</strong><br><em>Labour, Birkenhead</em></p> <p>\u2022\u2008It's good to see the Labour party's analysis returning to socialist roots, after so long (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/oct/02/ed-miliband-one-nation-speech1\" title=\"\">Labour leader vows to unite country as he claims 'one nation' mantle</a>, 3 October).

There was no sign from that meeting that that was likely to happen.\u201d</p> <p>Professor Brian Cathcart, who founded the Hacked Off campaign, said the meeting had been productive.

As a Labour councillor, I was something of an intruder. I went a little red at the hotel reception, mumbling apologetically that I wasn\u2019t \u201cactually a Tory\u201d and feeling shell shocked at the huge numbers of powerful looking men in corporate suits. But as it turned out, one group of Conservatives were far more frightening than any other. These are the \"nice guys\", and they pose a serious electoral threat to Labour.</p> <p>This group is not a formal alliance, but they are all critical of economic liberalism. They are prepared to challenge the market when it isn\u2019t working for people, and they have a genuine concern for the poor. They are socially conservative, and believe in family, community and tradition. They admit that 1979 brought problems as well as benefits. They are sceptical of big business wielding too much power and stick up for strivers, whether they work in the public or private sector. They believe there is such a thing as society. They are, in essence, One Nation Tories.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/graemearcher/100184381/what-do-tory-activists-want-how-about-an-end-to-the-smug-upper-class-stereotype-andrew-mitchell-embodies/\">&#xa0;\u2022 Graeme Archer at the Telegraph says the Andrew Mitchell affair illustrates what could be the biggest problem facing the Tories.</a></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Defeating Labour isn't the same thing as securing a Tory majority, however, as we learned in May 2010.

Unremarkable, you might say. Parties attack each other, particularly when conference season is on. However, there is a new intensity to the Tory leadership's assault on Ed Miliband. They don't seem to have been shaken by Labour's successful conference, but they have been stirred. They appear to appreciate that the threat level has changed.</p> <p>The old approach \u2013 of treating Miliband as a complete joke and smirking whilst explaining that he is the Tories secret electoral weapon \u2013 has been rendered redundant. Mili E has hardly been reborn as Tony Blair, but he has momentum and the huge advantage of a great many voters returning to Labour from the Lib Dems.</p> <p>This makes the next election more difficult for the Tories. It was supposed to be won on the back of a strong recovery and the alleged uselessness of Ed.

The Financial Times called it \"shock therapy for the country\", a quote the publishers apparently took as a compliment.</p> <p>I usually try to adopt a neutral tone in these blogposts, but I have to say I found the whole thing pretty terrifying. Britannia Unhinged might have been a better title.</p> <p>Raab lamented the fact that their book had been caricatured as \"Tories blast lazy Brits\", but said that since Thomas Edison's time \"the average number of hours worked by Britons has fallen by a third \u2026 We have a shrinking proportion peddling harder and harder not just to drive our economy but also to maintain our precious public services.\"</p> <p>He was keen for this not to be seen as public sector v private sector - he said that since 1997 lawyers' hours had stayed constant while police officers' had increased, for example - but he rather let the cat out of the bag by adding: \"On average public sector workers work two hours a week less than private sector employees yet they're paid more and they're less productive.\"</p> <p>Raab said that \"Labour's push to get 50% of young people into university was particularly pernicious. Too many of our universities are instilling a culture of laziness\" just when we needed the opposite. University students worked on average 26 hours a week, he said - \"seven hours less than the European average\". (The idea that university work can be totted up and compared this way seems a bit reductive to me.)</p> <p>He concluded: \"We're going to have to rediscover, recognise and reward the lost value of hard graft that made this country great\" - which really is not a million miles away from \"Tories blast lazy Brits\".</p> <p>Kwarteng also touched on education, saying that for 30 years exam results had improved, a sequence that could only be seen in the \"natural world\" in terms of life expectancy. Everyone else seems to be using the Olympics as an example of everything at the moment, so I will just politely ask him to consider that physical and sporting achievements are almost uniformly on the same sort of upward curves.</p> <p>Asked about the cancelled Building Schools for the Future programme, Skidmore said private companies made \"rapacious\" profits from it. \"Why do we not then have for-profit schools? \u2026 India, China, they're not spending the big bucks on the buildings. It's the teachers that matter.\"</p> <p>If anything, the audience seemed even more rightwing than the panel. The MPs were asked by businesswoman Rachel McLean: \"When I go to India I don't hear anybody talking about work-life balance \u2026 Why do we spend all our time talking about it in the UK?\"</p> <p>Raab replied that his wife was expecting their first child, but she \"earns considerably more than me\" so \"how do you balance the dual roles of breadwinning and childcaring?\" That was a \"major issue\" for his family, he said, although he did not see it as one of work-life balance.</p> <p>Patel said of Indian businessman Ratan Tata \"there was a great deal of hysteria when he said he comes over here and at 5pm people are simply not there [at work]\". There were different cultures in the country regarding work, she said. Her own immigrant parents \"worked 24/7 running small shops\", and Patel said she shared that work ethic.</p> <p>It was left to one delegate to point out that in countries such as India and China that the authors were lionising great proportions of the population \"work very hard but for very little money\". Patel said they weren't holding up these countries as role models but merely pointing out that they were now Britain's competitors.</p> <p>A male delegate asked why there was such public hostility to the \"modest improvements\" (aka cuts) the government were making.

They'll be given a list of options. They might want something restorative or punitive. They might want it to be carried out nearby or as far away as possible. But what matters is that the punishment will be chosen by the victim. <br>&#xa0;<br>For too long, victims of crime have had no voice - but this government is giving victims back their voice.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>\u2022 She criticised Labour for choosing former politicians as police commissioner candidates.</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Conservative candidates include a former air chief marshal, several magistrates, business men and women and former police officers. <br>&#xa0;<br>Looking at Labour's candidates, they seem to think the public are desperate for one last reunion tour of the politicians they rejected at the last election - Lord Prescott and the Has Beens, coming soon to a venue near you.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>\u2022 She accused Labour of using immigration to keep down wages.</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>When we came to office, we found that official government assessments assumed that there was absolutely no displacement of British workers by immigrants. No wonder all the Whitehall departments were lined up in favour of more and more immigration. So when we asked our independent advisers to look at the effect of immigration on jobs, they found that every 100 non-European working age immigrants were associated with 23 fewer British-born people in work. <br>&#xa0;<br>And, by the way, Labour knew just what they were doing. According to Jon Cruddas, Ed Miliband's policy chief, Labour were \"using migration to introduce a covert 21st century incomes policy.\" That's right, Labour - the party of the working man and woman - admit that they deliberately used immigration to keep down British wages.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-10-09T14:48:03.331Z\">at 3.48pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-507430df58f91d7bbadac180\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-09T14:12:47.725Z\">3.12pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/artanddesign/audioslideshow/2012/oct/09/party-conference-three-decades-lens\">This is lovely - a slideshow of some of Martin Argles best party conference photographs for the Guardian, with a commentary from Martin.</a></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5074305158f91d7bbadac17e\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-09T14:10:26.132Z\">3.10pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Damian Green,</strong> the policing minister, is speaking to the conference now.</p> <p>He starts with rather a good joke.

They are arguing that teachers give only the most perfunctory reports. They are saying that teachers shouldn't do photocopying, they are saying that teachers shouldn't put up displays, they are saying that teachers shouldn't invigilate exams.

The action short of strike action by members of the NASUWT and NUT is ensuring that teachers' time is focused on delivering the highest standards of teaching and learning for every pupil.</p> <p>Michael Gove appears to want to return schools to a past where teachers spent their days standing at photocopiers or undertaking bureaucratic form filling, rather than concentrating on teaching and learning.</p> </blockquote> <p>And this is from <strong>Christine Blower</strong>, general secretary of the National Union of Teachers.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Michael Gove does not have a monopoly of concern that all children and young people should have high aspiration and the very best teaching and support to achieve.

Before he arrives, it's worth quoting an extract from an article about the Johnson/Cameron rivalry in this week's New Statesman. It's by Andrew Gimson, Johnson's biographer.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Boris Johnson is trying to kill David Cameron. That may sound like an exaggeration, but the word \u201ckill\u201d was used by Johnson himself, in a column about \u201cthe basic drama of politics\u201d written soon after the Labour landslide of 1997: \u201cPolitics is a constant repetition, in cycles of varying length, of one of the oldest myths in human culture, of how we make kings for our societies, and how after a while we kill them to achieve a kind of rebirth \u2013 as Tony Blair would put it, new life for Britain\" \u2026</p> <p>Johnson is now in a position to persecute the prime minister almost daily. On past form, he will use the Tory conference in Birmingham once more to upstage Cameron. The Mayor of London can be bolder about tax cuts, the des\u00adirability of getting rid of the euro, the need for a new airport, the best ways of getting Labour voters to back the Tories, and also on any passing issue of the hour, such as the atrocious manners of Andrew Mitchell, the chief whip who called the police plebs. Cameron, as the cautious voice of the establishment, cannot match Johnson the Merry England maverick on any of these subjects.</p> <p>Over the next three years, we can expect Johnson to bend every sinew to demonstrate that he is the party\u2019s greatest electoral asset and the one man who could lead it to an overall majority. He will try to become the person to whom the party feels compelled to turn. It is notable that he is already spoken of as a man for the top job or for no job at all. If he does one day supplant Cameron, he will regard it as belated recognition of his natural supremacy.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-10-09T10:04:19.139Z\">at 11.04am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5073f3b558f91d7bbadac138\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-09T09:51:49.503Z\">10.51am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Boris bingo</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>We're going to be playing Boris bingo during Johnson's speech, which starts in about 10 minutes. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/interactive/2012/oct/09/boris-johnson-speech-bingo-conservative-conference-2012\">Click here for your bingo card</a>.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-10-09T10:04:38.657Z\">at 11.04am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5073f22458f91d7bbadac137\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-09T09:45:08.723Z\">10.45am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here are some of the best Conservative conference stories and articles from today's papers.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2214820/Pick-punishment-May-tells-victims-crime-unveils-sweeping-justice-reforms.html\">\u2022 Theresa May tells the Daily Mail in an interview that victims of antisocial behaviour will be given a say in how offenders are punished.</a></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u2018One of the big problems for the victims of antisocial behaviour is that they feel powerless,\u2019 said Mrs May.</p> <p>\u2018Somebody does something to them or their property and they feel they don\u2019t get reparation, or feel they are not part of the process.</p> <p>\u2018We want to ensure that they have a choice.

Cameron said some kind things about me too, and I must say I have been mulling over his suggestion that I could help the cause by buying a national newspaper or two. Which one to choose? To influence the BBC, the answer must be the Guardian. Between April 2010 and February it bought 59,829 copies of the paper \u2013 more than any other. Indeed it bought 11,000 more Guardians than Telegraphs, though the latter\u2019s circulation is three times as big. I wonder why this could be.

Here are the main points. I've taken some of the quotes from the Press Association.</p> <p><strong>\u2022 Cameron said that having a referendum would be \"the cleanest, neatest, simplest and most sensible\" way of obtaining public consent for a new settlement with the EU</strong>. Previously he said that a referendum or a general election could be used to obtain public support for a new EU deal, but this morning's comment makes it almost inevitable that the party will back a referendum (see 8.39am).</p> <p><strong>\u2022 He said the government was changing the law about tackling burglars because currently there was \"uncertainty\" about the level of force that was allowed.</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I think there has been uncertainty about what proportionate means are so we are saying you can do anything as long as it is not grossly disproportionate. You couldn't, for instance, stab a burglar if they were unconscious. But really we should be putting the law firmly on the side of the homeowner, the householder, the family and saying, when that burglar crosses that threshold, invades your home, threatens your family, they give up their rights \u2026</p> <p>I'm more interested in the rights of the people who want to defend their homes and their properties.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>\u2022 He claimed that he was not concerned that Boris Johnson was more popular with the Conservative party than he was.</strong> On ITV's Daybreak the presenter said that, while the Tories were chanting \"Boris, Boris, Boris\", they weren't chanting \"Dave, Dave, Dave\". Cameron said this because he was prime minister.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There are lots of people that are more popular than me in this world, because I have to be the one who takes the difficult decisions on behalf of the country to recover us from the dreadful state that Labour left us in. That's just life, but in politics what matters is you do your duty, you do the right thing for your country.</p> </blockquote> <p>He also said that he wanted to have \"big stars in the Conservative party that can carry our message to the country\". He said he had told Johnson that, when he stands down as mayor, he should look for another job in politics. Cameron may, however, have given a better indication of his true feelings when James Naughtie asked if he had thought of offering Johnson a job abroad. Cameron clearly found the prospect attractive (see 8.30am and 8.53am).</p> <p><strong>\u2022 He rejected claims that the welfare cuts announced this week meant that the Conservatives were once more the \"nasty\" party.</strong> When this was put to him on ITV's Daybreak, he replied:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I don't accept that for a moment. When we came to power there were people all over the country getting up and going to work and their taxes were going towards families in London who were getting each \u00a350,000-\u00a360,000 of housing benefit every year. That isn't fair, so I want a fair welfare system that works for everybody.</p> </blockquote> <p>He also rejected claims that the Conservative party was turning to the right. Citing his decision to announce more money for the NHS and to protect the aid budget, he said the party was not being leftwing or rightwing but just demonstrating \"sensible, common ground, common sense. Conservative, practical thinking\".</p> <p><strong>\u2022 He refused to say whether or not he believed Andrew Mitchell's denial that he called police officers at the gates of Downing Street \"plebs\". </strong>When James Naughtie said that Cameron had chosen to believe Mitchell rather than the officer who wrote up a report of the incident in his log, Cameron queried this.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>No, what I chose to do was accept the fact that Andrew Mitchell has apologised and the police don't want to take their complaint further, or take any further action, and they accepted his apology. This is what I accept. I'm not going to go into the private conversations I had. Suffice it to say, what happened was completely unacceptable and must never happen again.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>\u2022 He said that the new IMF report saying the British economy will shrink this year would not lead the government to change course economically.</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>What the IMF are saying is, first of all they are coming into line with other forecasts, which are disappointing, that there is going to be a very poor picture for growth in Europe. They are not advising us to change course, they are saying unless things get dramatically worse, we should stick to our plans, which is about reducing public spending and dealing with debt and deficit.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>\u2022 He hinted that he would be happy to see Jimmy Savile <strong> posthumously</strong> stripped of his knighthood.</strong> This is what he told ITV when asked if he was in favour of this.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We have something called a forfeiture committee. It is not chaired or sat on by me but it is responsible for looking at honours and the removal of honours, and obviously they have to do their job too.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>\u2022 He said that he had been burgled twice when he was living in North Kensington.</strong> \"There was one occasion when I left the keys of my car and they loaded up my Skoda and drove off and that was particularly angst-making.</p> <p><strong>\u2022 He said he hoped his wife Samantha would take him out for a balti tonight to celebrate his birthday.</strong></p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-10-09T09:37:19.130Z\">at 10.37am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5073d6d4c0e361310bc6ca3e\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-09T07:53:53.695Z\">8.53am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here's some Twitter reaction to the Cameron Today interview.</p> <p>From the Daily Mail's James Chapman</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/jameschappers/status/255568239873110016\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Dave is eating Naughtie for breakfast.

The government has taken several measures to get more money from the rich. You would not accept me making budget measures on this programme.</p> <p><em>Q: But you've done that with welfare measures. You said you would cut housing benefit for the under-25s. Many of these people have children. Those children will suffer.</em></p> <p>Cameron says he launched a national conversation about welfare in a speech earlier this year. He thinks it is right to look at this issue. If you are out of work and get a flat on housing benefit, you have no incentive to find a job.</p> <p><em>Q: What are you going to do to get more money from those at the top?</em></p> <p>Cameron says there is more to do on tax evasion and tax avoidance.</p> <p><em>Q: But that's the duty of any government.</em></p> <p>Cameron says it was not been done in the past.

May is expected to indicate at the very least that the UK will opt out of EU police and justice co-operation when the decision has to be made in 2014. This will be packaged up as part of the UK repatriating powers from Europe. But it will be hugely controversial as it involves areas of international police co-operation including the European arrest warrant, the instrument under which James Forrest was arrested recently in France after leaving the country with his pupil Megan Stammers. The arrest warrant is seen by police and intelligence officers as one of the most successful instruments in European crime fighting, having helped speed up extraditions and the whole process of bringing some of Europe's most wanted criminals to justice. If the UK opts out of all police and justice co-operation it can selectively opt back in to some of it at a later stage, provided other countries do so. But this is an important statement of this government's new direction on Europe. Nick Clegg has gone out of his way to praise the arrest warrant and the broader policy of cross-border crime fighting.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-10-09T08:37:55.822Z\">at 9.37am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5073ca6058f91d7bbadac11b\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-09T06:56:49.424Z\">7.56am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>It's David Cameron's 46th birthday today and he's celebrating it by giving a round of interviews.

  "<p>The reported killing of the leader of the ferocious Zetas narco cartel, Heriberto Lazcano, by Mexican marines is a major coup for the armed forces battling the world's wildest criminal syndicates.</p> <p>If this is Lazcano, President Felipe Calder\u00f3n \u2013 who is nearing the end of a term marked by a catastrophic war against the cartels \u2013 will be able to claim with justification that it is a high point of his period in office. It also gives the incoming government of the rival PRI party new momentum to prosecute the war against the Zetas.</p> <p>Lazcano, right, filled a crucial role in the genealogy and tactics of Mexico's crime syndicates. He ranked high in the country's \u2013 and the world's \u2013 most wanted lists, along with Joaqu\u00edn \"Chapo\" Guzm\u00e1n, leader of the Zetas' rival gang, the vast Sinaloa cartel. But the two come from very different lineages and present the government with different challenges.</p> <p>Guzm\u00e1n is a modern incarnation of the \"old school\" mafia don, claiming the mantle of a family that ran narco trafficking for decades through a vicious, pyramidal structure. But the recent bloody history of Mexico's cartels has been one of constantly pushing the bounds of savagery, breaking down the old \"corporate\" nature of cartel control, with contacts in politics. The Zetas are the cartel of our time: their violence is perverse \u2013 almost innovative \u2013 in its cruelty, adept on the internet, unrelenting in every way.</p> <p>The Zetas were founded by Guzman's nemesis, Osiel C\u00e1rdenas Guill\u00e9n, as a paramilitary enforcement wing of the Gulf cartel, and they rapidly set new limits in violence and insurgent tactics. Lazcano was a key lieutenant, and after C\u00e1rdenas was arrested \u2013 he is now in jail in Texas \u2013 the Gulf cartel split and the Zetas became a cartel in their own right, under Lazcano's control.</p> <p>As such, they have pitched themselves wildly against every other criminal syndicate in the country \u2013 and many beyond, becoming Mexico's bridge to the European cocaine trade through an alliance with an Italian group, the Calabrian 'Ndrangheta, which has mirrored their tactics.</p> <p>With a smaller narcotic base than Guzm\u00e1n from which to work, the Zetas expanded their business to take over migration rackets into the US. This led to the largest single massacre of the drugs war, the killing of 72 central Americans who, it is believed, refused to pay the Zetas' \"toll\" for illegally crossing the border. Under Lazcano's leadership their affairs included widespread extortion, kidnapping, prostitution and the export of stolen oil to the US. Lazcano's paramilitary troops even battle Guzm\u00e1n's men for cocaine trade routes through Guatemala and El Salvador, and have turned Mexico's showpiece cosmopolitan city, Monterrey \u2013 which thought itself immune \u2013 into a battleground.</p> <p>But there is no reason to suppose the scourge of violence will abate because of Lazcano's reported killing, and if it does, that the influence of the narco cartels will decline. For like Guzm\u00e1n's Sinaloa cartel, the Zetas are also taking territory. In several parts of Mexico police and even the political apparatus have come under their control \u2013 just as others are under Guzm\u00e1n's.</p> <p>One possible option available to Mexico's new president-elect, Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto of the PRI, is to do a deal of some sort with Guzm\u00e1n to secure a return to the old, pre-Calder\u00f3n \"order\", whereby a kind of conviviality existed between Guzm\u00e1n's family elders from Sinaloa and Guadalajara and the PRI's formidable political structure.</p> <p>The Sinaloa cartel, which has many clients in Mexico, is the only organisation with which any hope of such arrangements can lie, such has been the ferocity of the Zetas under Cardenas and Lazcarno.</p> <p>With the death of Lazcano, we can expect the war against the Zetas to be scaled up, and a bloody reaction from Lazcano's heirs to ensue. Guzm\u00e1n, meanwhile, will watch and wait for his moment.</p>",
  "<p>For all the cheers and chuckles at Boris Johnson's conference speech on Tuesday, it's not easy to find Tory activists in Birmingham's International Conference Centre who think that London's mayor is ever going to lead their party after David Cameron \u2013 let alone be the saviour who wins the difficult election ahead in 2015. All but the most ideological dislike austerity, yet feel they have little choice but to buckle down \u2013 and hope it works. There is no Plan B here.</p> <p>But there again, it is not as easy as it once was to find activists among the paid professionals \u2013 from lobbyists and single-issue campaigners to the media pack \u2013 who are an increasingly dominant presence, here to listen to earnest policy discussion on the conference fringe but rarely to partisan rhetoric in the main hall. \"This is the first year when not a single activist has come from my constituency,\" confides one MP. \"In the old days you could stay at a seaside B&amp;B. To come to Manchester or Birmingham can cost \u00a3600.\"</p> <p>Jean and Eric are retired managers from Warrington, energetic and cheerful, who booked early for a three-night bargain for \u00a3421 (breakfast included) in the new Hotel La Tour. The couple don't dismiss the Boris Question hanging over the conference out of hand \u2013 \"he's fun, he makes politics enjoyable\" \u2013 but do worry that Cameron is making too many enemies among nurses and teachers.</p> <p>Yet it is public sector fat cats, the council chief executives getting \u00a3500,000 payoffs and walking into a new job, which offend their sensibilities more than bankers. \"He should stop chopping at the bottom and go for people at the top,\" says Jean, who cites a Daily Telegraph expos\u00e9 of charity heads' high salaries. Plenty of Tories here in modest public service jobs share that grievance. Should they be more centrist or more hardline? They seem unsure.</p> <p>From the Isle of Wight (they call England \"North Island\"), Dona Ratcliff and Alan Wells, past and current chairs of the constituency association, love Boris's sense of humour and his cleverness. \"He is sort of Churchillian,\" says Ratcliff. But she also agrees with Wells's admiration for the PM \u2013 \"head and shoulders above the rest and very confident. He gives the impression of not listening, but he does listen.\"</p> <p>As a champion of apprenticeships and Michael Gove's school reforms, Wells is far more concerned about getting the jobless back to work than the \"Batter a Burglar\" incitement in Tuesday's papers. Iain Duncan Smith exemplified compassionate conservatism but it harder getting across the \"compassionate but tough\" message of his welfare reforms, he concedes. Ratcliff says it's true that some people on benefit \"live in \u00a32m houses\".</p> <p>Brigid Simmonds is a Tory, but here in her capacity as chief executive of the British Beer &amp; Pub Association. She backs deficit reduction (\"Cameron has to be decisive\"), wants less of a nanny state and less EU regulation. Though Cameron is floating a version of the EU referendum in Birmingham, only specialist Europe-baiting rallies \u2013 with topics such as \"We Need to Talk About Europe\" \u2013 call for Britain to leave. Maybe hardliners have defected to Ukip?</p> <p>Like most party conferences, the tone is a mixture of high seriousness and high jinks. Even the Tories hold fringe meetings well after the gin and tonic hour nowadays. At lunchtime Phillip Blond's \"Red Tory\" thinktank, Res Publica, staged an event with the Consumer Finance Association, which grappled with how best to provide affordable credit to the poor in ways the poor can manage.</p> <p>There is an almost Fabian quality to the debate, which sits uneasily with the poor-bashing speeches from ministers on the main floor. But contradictions abound at this mid-term conference. At a fringe meeting, staged by the pro-market Reform campaign on Monday night, some members of the audience couldn't wait for the break-up of the euro \"so that growth can resume the next day\".</p> <p>City experts on the platform recoil with horror at the certain cost to Britain and the wider world of such disruption. It is the same story over immigration. Activists want to curb it, but industry and the City fear that ministers \"ratcheting up the rhetoric\" (as the Institute of Directors' Simon Walker puts it) are damaging the economy as skilled workers and rich Chinese tourists go elsewhere. Immigrants claim less in benefits than other people, adds Walker.</p> <p>With a five-year, fixed-term parliament \u2013 the coalition's one constitutional reform \u2013 in place, there is none of the fevered speculation about when the next election might come: 2015 or even earlier if the coalition fractures deepen? This is a fingers crossed, steady-as-she-goes conference, far blander than the socialist-bashing Thatcher years, more technocratic and didactic than lurid tabloid language suggests.</p> <p>As at rival conferences, debate has been hollowed out, these are showcase rallies for the leadership with the politics equivalent of Open University seminars attached. Everyone knows that any government's choices will be limited by debt and market sentiment, by eurozone recession and \u2013 as George Osborne stressed \u2013 by the rise of Asia, where people work harder and smarter. Europe must adapt or decline.</p> <p>That context does not leave much scope for the sort of subversion that Michael Heseltine's Plan B routinely staged on the conference fringe in the later Thatcher years or Norman Tebbit did once he decided John Major was a disappointment. Boris Johnson's fringe rally this week was content-free burlesque by comparison.</p> <p>Cheering up activists is a valuable talent but, as Ken Clarke reminded the London mayor, he needs to put his nose to the grindstone and deliver serious reform if he wants to be taken seriously one day. Or as one backbench MP put it: \"It's not an issue until after the election and besides, I don't think the party will want another Etonian as leader, do you?\"</p>",
  "<p>Austrian daredevil Felix Baumgartner's attempt to parachute to earth from the edge of space has been postponed for the second day running after gusty winds in New Mexico hampered the launch of the balloon that would take him skywards.</p> <p>Baumgartner, a 43-year-old former soldier, was aiming to jump from 23 miles above the Earth in a specially pressurised suit, plummetting to the ground at speeds that would break the sound barrier before he triggers his parachute.</p> <p>The stunt, if successful, would break five world records. Baumgartner would become the first human to ever break the sound barrier in free-fall; make the highest free-fall altitude jump, ride the highest manned balloon flight and longest free-fall and his jump platform is believed to be the largest manned balloon in history.</p> <p>Baumgartner has made a name for himself with acts of derring-do. The former paratrooper, known as \"Fearless Felix\" for reasons that need no explanation, has parachuted off buildings and mountains and once into a 600 foot deep cave. Baumgartner had already done two practise freefalls \u2013 one from 71,000 feet in March this year and a second from 97,000 feet in July.</p> <p>The jump was due to take place far above an airfield near the town of Roswell, which is famous for its UFO sighting. All had appeared well as Baumgartner donned his special suit, climbed into the capsule and then waited for the balloon to inflate. \"I am strapped into the capsule and I am ready to go,\" he had told the stunt's mission control team.</p> <p>However, as the slivery balloon began to be inflated it was buffeted by heavy winds and the mission was postponed. Depending on weather conditions, another attempt is likely to be made on Wednesday. Baumgartner, whose attempt is sponsored and run by the caffeinated drinks brand Red Bull, had postponed his first attempt on Monday, also after high winds.</p> <p>If successful Baumgartner's feat will raise the prospect that stricken astronauts might be able to survive a disaster of the type that hit the space shuttle Columbia in 2003 by actually bailing out of their craft. Baumgartner's top medical man in the stunt is Dr. Jonathan Clark, whose wife Laurel Clark died in the Columbia accident. Clark is now dedicated to improving astronauts' chances of survival in a high-altitude disaster.</p>",
  "<p>First, Mitt Romney threatened to cut funding to Big Bird. Now, in another campaign-strategy foul against the voters of tomorrow, his campaign has announced he has turned down a request to appear on Nickelodeon's election special. </p> <p>The children's channel launched the show, Kids Pick the President: The Candidates, in 1988. Candidates answer videotaped questions from children, and then viewers can vote for their choice of president in an online poll. In five of the past six presidential elections, child voters chose the same candidate as the eventual winner of the adult poll.</p> <p>President Barack Obama accepted an invitation to appear this year. Nickelodeon said it would use file clips of Romney addressing some of the issues raised in the questions posed by viewers.</p> <p>Linda Ellerbee, host of Nick News, said she was disappointed by the Romney team's decision.</p> <p>\"I would be equally disappointed if he had said yes and Obama said no,\" Ellerbee told the Guardian. \"It's not a personal thing, it's just a shame when both candidates don't see it as something important.\"</p> <p>Only two other presidential-hopefuls have refused invitations to the show. John Kerry declined the offer in 2004 and George W Bush withdrew in response. He had participated in 2000.</p> <p>The network said Nick News reached out to Romney several times since April, but his campaign told the program he couldn't fit the appearance in his schedule. </p> <p>\"I am still holding the door open until midnight October 14, I can work all night and cut the show and get him in. We'll meet him anywhere,\" Ellerbee said.</p> <p>The special will air on 15 October on Nickelodeon.</p> <p>Obama answered questions about the top campaign issues of this year's election for the special and responded to the kids' questions about jobs, same-sex marriage, illegal immigration and gun control. He also talked about heartbreak and his most embarrassing moment, said the network. </p> <p>\"Running into the wall is par for the course for me,\" the president said.&#xa0;\"I'm running into doors and desks all the time.\"</p> <p>Kids Pick the President sets out to increase children's understanding and awareness of the election, candidates and campaign issues and will announce the poll results on-air Monday, 22 October. </p> <p>The Romney campaign did not respond to requests for comment. </p> <p>In the first presidential debate last week, <a href=\"http://\">Romney provoked anger from another bastion of children's television</a> \u2013&#xa0;Sesame Street. The 43-year-old television show is a staple of PBS, which provides free, educational programming to US televisions. </p> <p>During the debate, Romney said: \"I'm going to stop other things. I like PBS, I love Big Bird. Actually I like you, too. But \u2026 I'm not going to keep on spending money on things to borrow money from China to pay for [it].\"</p> <p>This comment initiated waves of social media mockery and <a href=\"http://www.thirteen.org/insidethirteen/2012/10/04/pbs-statement-regarding-october-3-presidential-debate/\">prompted a defensive response from the network</a>. </p> <p>\"As a stated supporter of education, Governor Romney should be a champion of public broadcasting, yet he is willing to wipe out services that reach the vast majority of Americans, including underserved audiences, such as children who cannot attend preschool and citizens living in rural areas,\" PBS said.</p> <p>PBS also noted that most of their funding is provided by local member stations which raise their own money in addition to the federal funding they receive.</p>",
  "<p>The Mexican authorities have claimed one of their biggest victories against the notoriously bloody Zetas drug cartel, but admit they have lost the body of Heriberto Lazcano, the gang's brutal leader, who they say was killed in a shootout with the navy.</p> <p>Most of the original members of the Zetas cartel, which was formed in the 1990s, have been captured or killed, but Lazcano, who went by the nicknames \"el Lazca\" and \"the Executioner\", had appeared untouchable. The United States had offered $5m and the Mexican authorities $2.3m in rewards for information leading to his arrest.</p> <p>Authorities in the northern state of Coahuila were called out by the navy on Sunday at about 6pm to recover two bodies killed in a shootout near the town of Progreso, about 80 miles from the US border, the state's attorney general, Homero Ramos, told reporters on Tuesday.</p> <p>Ramos said the bodies were handed over to a local funeral parlour after being fingerprinted and photographed. Reading from a statement and refusing to answer questions, he added that the owner of the parlour had informed the authorities at about 8am on Monday that a masked and heavily armed unit had snatched both bodies.</p> <p>The Zetas are known for their strong esprit de corps, and often go to great lengths to recover the bodies of cartel members killed in clashes with other gangs and the authorities.</p> <p>Ramos did not say when the authorities realised that fingerprints taken from one of the cadavers matched those of Lazcano on a national database, and that photographs of the corpse matched descriptions of the trafficker.</p> <p>The navy released details of the prints along with two pictures of Lazcano's body, apparently taken on a morgue slab. This backed its earlier statement late on Monday that referred only to \"strong indications\" that it had killed Lazcano.</p> <p>It was left to Ramos to give details of the shootout, which he said began when a navy patrol tried to stop a suspicious vehicle near a baseball field. He said that after the driver of the vehicle was killed, the passenger got out and ran, but was shot dead about 300 metres away. The authorities said weapons recovered in the vehicle included two rifles, grenades, and a rocket-propelled grenade launcher.</p> <p>The Zetas cartel is one of the main combatants in Mexico's horrific drug wars, which have killed more than 55,000 people since President Felipe Calder\u00f3n launched a military-led offensive against organised crime nearly six years ago.</p> <p>Lazcano was one of the founders of the Zetas, which started out in the late 1990s as an enforcement unit within the Gulf cartel, formed from a core of deserters from an elite army unit. Born in 1975, Lazcano spent seven years in the army before deserting in 1998. He originally went by the codename Zeta 3.</p> <p>The Zetas later developed into a major cartel in their own right, known for the discipline of the military-style training and tactics they employed in battles with rivals and the authorities, as well as for the wide range of criminal activities they pursued alongside drug trafficking, such as the mass kidnapping of Central American migrants passing through Mexico and extensive extortion rackets.</p> <p>But the Zetas are probably most famous for the no-holds-barred brutality they employ to keep the territories they control docile, as well as during incursions into areas under the influence of rivals. While other cartels, most notably the Sinaloa cartel, headed by the infamous trafficker Joaqu\u00edn \"El Chapo\" Guzm\u00e1n, regularly form alliances of convenience with other groups, the Zetas tend to go it alone.</p> <p>From late 2011 Calder\u00f3n made it clear that the Zetas were the most urgent target of his wider offensive against all the cartels, because of their extreme violence. The string of hits against the group has intensified in the past few weeks, with the pressure spiralling in Coahuila in particular after the murder of the son of a prominent politician was blamed on the group.</p> <p>The most recent arrest of a major Zeta operative came on Saturday when the navy captured Salvador Martinez Escobedo in Nuevo Laredo, just across the border from Laredo in Texas. The navy said Martinez, nicknamed \"the Squirrel\", had ordered the massacre of 72 migrants in Tamaulipas state in August 2010, among many other atrocities.</p> <p>Unofficial reports on Tuesday said Martinez had identified Lazcano from the photographs taken of one of the men killed in Sunday's shootout.</p> <p>In recent years Lazcano had shared the Zetas' leadership with another founding member, Miguel Angel Trevi\u00f1o Morales, known as \"Zeta 40\", although there had been some reports that the pair had split. Trevi\u00f1o Morales has a reputation that is even more bloody than Lazcano's.</p>",
  "<p>Julian Assange has found a new platform on which to press his case against extradition: the vast \"little monster\" fanbase of the pop star Lady Gaga, who has <a href=\"http://gagadaily.com/news/lady-gaga-visits-julian-assange-in-london/\" title=\"\">visited him for dinner</a> at the Ecuadorean embassy.</p> <p>Gaga dined with the WikiLeaks founder on Monday night after launching a perfume at the Harrods department store next door to the embassy where Assange, 41, has been holed up since seeking political asylum in June.</p> <p>WikiLeaks seized on the apparently impromptu visit by one of the world's biggest-selling singers to urge its defenders to \"educate her support base\", which includes over 30 million followers on Twitter.</p> <p>Assange broke his bail conditions to evade extradition to Sweden where he is wanted to face allegations of rape and sexual assault, which he strenuously denies.</p> <p>He believes he faces imprisonment in the US and has claimed he could be sent to Guant\u00e1namo Bay for his role in disseminating classified US government documents.</p> <p>Gaga, whose real name is Stefani Germanotta, has backed several political campaigns, notably gay rights campaigns in America. This week she urged her fans, who she calls \"little monsters\", to read up on fracking, the controversial technique of extracting shale gas, which campaigners complain causes environmental destruction.</p> <p>Gaga's meeting with Assange was heavily plugged by WikiLeaks, which urged supporters to join protests outside the embassy and kept them up to date about Gaga's arrival. The Bad Romance singer posted pictures of the visit on her website, including one of her with Assange inside the embassy. Her trademark extravagant dress, including a witch-style hat, made for a stark contrast with Assange's plain white T-shirt.</p> <p>Assange is able to accept visitors but cannot step outside the embassy because the British authorities have posted policemen at the front and back entrances who are poised to arrest him if he leaves. He would then be sent to Sweden under the terms of a European arrest warrant (EAW).</p> <p>Last week, Assange's visitors included a group of financial backers who stood to lose \u00a3140,000 in bail money because of Assange's refusal to accept the supreme court's verdict upholding the EAW.

  "<p>In 1967 Pete Townshend heard the voice of God. Confirming his reputation for working in mysterious ways, the deity chose to introduce himself to the Who guitarist at the Rolling Meadows, Illinois branch of Holiday Inn. \"Suddenly it became clear that I longed for a transcendent connection with the universe itself, and with its maker,\" writes Townshend, adding, in a deadpan segue, that the band's drummer Keith Moon had other priorities on that tour. \"While I made progress with my search for meaning, Keith was causing havoc with a birthday cake, a car, a swimming pool, a lamp and a young fan's bloody head.\"</p> <p>The comical contrast explains what made the Who both one of the biggest bands in the world and one of the most restless. While Moon embraced rock stardom with open arms, Townshend wrestled with it, forever trying to justify himself to the spectre of the avant-garde artist and reliable family man he might have been. Townshend's years of psychotherapy ensure that <em>Who I Am</em>, which he first tried and failed to write in the mid-90s, isn't one of those rock memoirs that puts the what before the why. His past is a puzzle he is sweating to decipher. When a record label boss chides \"Your fans don't know who you are any more,\" Townshend reflects: \"Had they ever known? Even now I'm still trying to find out who I am.\" Or as the hero of the Who's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/may/30/quadrophenia-seminal-album-who\" title=\"\"><em>Quadrophenia</em></a> album has it: \"Schizophrenic? I'm bleeding quadrophenic.\"</p> <p>In Townshend's mind, the cataclysmic power of the Who's early work was rooted in trauma. At the age of six he was sent to live with his mentally ill grandmother, Denny, \"a perfect wicked witch\", who, he is convinced, allowed him to be sexually abused by her lovers; he also alludes to giving his mother's lover \"the green light\". The precise events elude him (\"My memory just shut down\") but the shards of detail are chilling: an unlocked flat, the \"little Hitler moustache\" on one male visitor, the beckoning of a car door. In one of disappointingly few insights into his songwriting, he retrospectively interprets his 1966 \"mini-opera\" medley \"<a href=\"http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-3099526434105125496\" title=\"\">A Quick One, While He's Away</a>\" as a cryptic account of his time with Denny.</p> <p>Townshend also believed that his music, informed by his art-school studies, reflected the damage done to a generation born amid post-war rubble and confronted, in adolescence, by the existential terror of the Cuban missile crisis. \"As I raised the stuttering guitar above my head, I felt I was holding up the bloodied standard of endless centuries of mindless war.\" Most of his audience, one suspects, just enjoyed the noise and spectacle.</p> <p>How many fans of the Who knew or cared that his ritual guitar-smashing was inspired by Gustav Metzger's theory of <a href=\"http://www.luftgangster.de/gmetzger.html\" title=\"\">auto-destructive art</a>? Or that the 1965 song \"The Kids Are Alright\" was partly informed by Purcell's <em>Gordian Knot Untied</em>? Call him pretentious \u2013 he does, happily, call himself that more than once \u2013 but it was this highbrow mission that propelled him towards the dizzying ambition of albums such as <em>The Who Sell Out</em>, <em>Tommy</em> and <em>Who's Next</em>. After a fruitless attempt to sell one grand concept to his bandmates he complained to his first wife, Karen: \"It's like trying to explain atomic energy to a group of cavemen.\"</p> <p>Townshend's unease with certain aspects of rock stardom may have pained him but it kept him relatively stable throughout the band's early years. Between 1967 and 1973 he steered the Who to greatness while spurning drugs and (most of the time) infidelity, and studying the teachings of the Indian mystic Meher Baba. Only later, as he confesses, did he become a clich\u00e9. On the Who's 1980 US tour he spent around $40,000 on cocaine and often fell asleep cradling a bottle of brandy. By the following year he was hanging out in New York crackhouses and conversing with the devil. \"I was turning into Keith Moon.\" There were psychological shocks that might explain this downward spiral \u2013 Moon's death from a sedative overdose in 1978, or the 11 Who fans who were killed in <a href=\"http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/eleven-people-killed-in-a-stampede-outside-who-concert-in-cincinnati-ohio\" title=\"\">a crush at a gig in Cincinnati</a> a year later \u2013 but Townshend earns the reader's sympathy by refusing to ask for it. His prose is crisp, clear and unflinching.</p> <p>Most rock memoirs run out of gas once the classic songs dry up and the major crises have been overcome, but Townshend's life after sobering up and splitting the Who in 1982 was never dull. He worked as an acquisitions editor for Faber and pursued several political causes in between sporadic reunions and solo albums. He also suffered from depression, briefly resumed drinking and saw his beleaguered marriage disintegrate. In 2003, he was arrested for accessing child pornography.</p> <p>Townshend isn't coy about his sexuality. He says he is \"probably bisexual\", citing his attraction to Mick Jagger (\"the only man I've ever seriously wanted to fuck\") and a one-off liaison with the journalist Danny Fields. He describes his adulterous pursuit of several younger women in terms that often make him seem seedy and pathetic. But on this subject he is adamant that, as a victim of abuse, he was researching an expos\u00e9 of the child porn industry. He is either a liar or the victim of a cruelly ironic misunderstanding. The evidence against him consists of a single unprocessed credit-card payment.</p> <p>That cloud remains, but elsewhere there is sunlight. He has remarried, and his fractious relationship with Roger Daltrey has mellowed. Unlike Moon and the Who's bass-player John Entwistle, he has survived his addictions. He recalls singing the climactic line of \"A Quick One, While He's Away\" \u2013 \"You are forgiven!\" \u2013 while \"thrashing at my guitar \u2026 frantically forgiving my mother, her lover, my grandmother, her lovers, and most of all myself\". Without a guitar in his hands, reaching that cathartic moment proves rather more challenging, but <em>Who I Am</em> is an unusually frank and moving attempt.</p>",

  "<h2>The winner</h2> <p>When <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/125815/taken\" title=\"\">Taken</a> debuted in the UK in September 2008 with \u00a31.17m, the Liam Neeson action film proved a surprise word-of-mouth hit with audiences, its box office dropping just 6% the following weekend, and eventually achieving a healthy total of 5.5 times its opening number (\u00a36.39m). The film went on to be a robust performer on DVD. In other words, all the planets looked felicitously aligned for the sequel, and industry expectations for commercial performance were appropriately high.</p> <p>Even so, the success of Taken 2 has caught commentators by surprise. With \u00a36.19m over the three-day weekend, and \u00a37.38m including Thursday previews, the Istanbul-set film has already grossed more than the entire UK run of the original Taken. If previews are discounted from opening weekend figures (as they should be), Taken 2's debut has been exceeded by only four films this year: <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/141046/dark-knight-rises\" title=\"\">The Dark Knight Rises</a> (\u00a314.36m), <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/144027/avengers\" title=\"\">Marvel Avengers Assemble</a> (\u00a313.23m),<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/140156/spider-man-reboot\" title=\"\"> The Amazing Spider-Man</a> (\u00a36.77m) and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/145506/prometheus\" title=\"\">Prometheus</a> (\u00a36.24m).</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/filmblog/2012/oct/08/us-box-office-taken-2-looper?intcmp=ILCMUSTXT9386\" title=\"\">In the US</a>, Taken 2 opened with $49.5m (\u00a330.9m), double the original Paris-set film's debut gross. By rule of thumb, based on the US figure, you would expect a UK opening around \u00a35m for Taken 2, but it's doing better than that. One likely factor is certification. The original Taken was awarded a 15 for \"strong violence and scene of torture\", whereas Taken 2 is <a href=\"http://www.bbfc.co.uk/CFF291014\" title=\"\">12A for \"moderate threat and violence\"</a>. Not only does this allow younger teens to attend unaccompanied, but also kids of any age may go accompanied by adults. Expanded, more active roles for Maggie Grace and Famke Janssen \u2013 respectively the daughter and ex-wife of Liam Neeson's former CIA operative \u2013 should have helped broaden appeal.</p> <p>Top site was <a href=\"http://www.myvue.com/\" title=\"\">Vue Westfield</a> in London's Shepherds Bush, with a nifty \u00a399,000 over the four days, followed by Vue Westfield Stratford in east London, then Cineworld Sheffield, Cineworld Glasgow and Vue Dublin. Reviews were decidedly mixed. Among critics surveyed by <a href=\"http://www.metacritic.com/\" title=\"\">Metascore</a>, the <a href=\"http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20121003/REVIEWS/121009988\" title=\"\">Chicago Sun-Times's Roger Ebert</a> was among the most positive: \"If you're buying what Luc Besson is selling, he's not short-changing you.\"</p> <h2>The runners-up</h2> <p>Although not exactly a direct competitor to Taken 2, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/148727/looper\" title=\"\">Looper</a> does combine action and an older marquee name in Bruce Willis, and any release grossing more than \u00a36m in three days inevitably sucks oxygen out of the room. For those reasons, Looper's distributor eOne will be plenty happy with a moderate 37% drop from the previous weekend, and \u00a35.41m after 10 days. In the US, Looper has taken just over $40m, so this is another case where a film could be said to be performing better in the UK.</p> <p>Similarly, although <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/149042/sinister\" title=\"\">Sinister</a> targeted the reliably robust horror audience, for whom it would be top choice, distributor Momentum will be pleased that Taken 2's success did not knock it off course. Sinister's \u00a31.44m debut is identical to the opening salvo of Momentum's horror hit <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/141338/insidious\" title=\"\">Insidious</a> from April 2011. Both films are from producer Jason Blum.</p> <p>In fourth place, teen drama <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/147832/perks-of-being-a-wallflower\" title=\"\">The Perks of Being a Wallflower</a> looks a tad soft, given the gutsy advertising campaign from eOne. With just over \u00a3600,000 from the three days, and \u00a3828,000 including two days of previews, the picture delivered a screen average of \u00a31,832, or \u00a32,524 if you look at the previews-inclusive figure. The teen genre is notoriously tricky. Warners recently came unstuck with <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/149104/now-is-good\" title=\"\">Now Is Good</a>, adapted from Jenny Downham's teen fiction Before I Die: the film has only taken \u00a3583,000 in three weeks of release, and already looks dead in the market.</p> <h2>The flops</h2> <p>Screenwriter Noel Clarke has endured a rough run at the UK box-office this year, with <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/147776\" title=\"\">Fast Girls</a> and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/147611/storage-24\" title=\"\">Storage 24</a> both arguably suffering from unsustainably wide releases. The same excuse can't be made for his latest effort, smutty wedding farce <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/149649/knot\" title=\"\">The Knot</a>, which debuted on just 43 screens, delivering a limp \u00a318,700 and a \u00a3433 average. The film is currently rated <a href=\"http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_knot_2012/\" title=\"\">0% fresh at Rotten Tomatoes</a>, with 16 UK critics surveyed.</p> <p>Still, The Knot's result is slightly ahead of <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1876451/\" title=\"\">Sparkle</a>'s, given the latter's \u00a315,900 debut from 52 cinemas. This remake of the 1976 girl-group saga features Whitney Houston's last screen performance. It was released in the US back in August on more than 2,000 screens, grossing a disappointing $24m in total, and it's fair to assume that Sony decided an aggressive push here in the UK was unlikely to deliver a result that justified the marketing expense.</p> <h2>The arthouse battle</h2> <p>With a fall of just 23%, the gentlest of any film in the top 10, French true story <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/149158/untouchable\" title=\"\">Untouchable</a> is winning the battle for fans of middlebrow uplift. In more limited play, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/149322/liberal-arts\" title=\"\">Liberal Arts</a> landed in 16th place, with a so-so \u00a387,400 from 45 screens, including nearly \u00a320,000 in previews. Given questions about whether audience appeal would match critical adulation, a modest 28% drop for Leos Carax's <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/147447/holy-motors\" title=\"\">Holy Motors</a> will more than satisfy distributor Artificial Eye. Holding even more impressively is German arthouse hit <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/149279/barbara\" title=\"\">Barbara</a>, from Christian Petzold. Dropping just 3%, the picture is clearly enjoying positive word among the niche audience.</p> <h2>The survivor</h2> <p>With 10 consecutive weeks inside the top 10, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/146821/brave\" title=\"\">Brave</a> is only the second film to achieve this feat in 2012, the other being <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/146340/men-in-black-iii\" title=\"\">Men in Black 3</a>. However, it is doing so at a much more competitive time. Brave has posted 10 consecutive weekends at \u00a3300,000-plus, whereas Men in Black 3's takings had dwindled to \u00a335,500 by its 10th week of release. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/148325/ice-age-4\" title=\"\">Ice Age 4: Continental Drift</a> managed a nine-week run inside the top 10, and also nine consecutive weekends at \u00a3300,000-plus.</p> <h2>The future</h2> <p>Thanks to Taken 2's sensational result, overall the market is a hefty 65% up on the previous weekend, and also a decent 15% improvement on the equivalent frame from 2011, when <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/141426/johnny-english-reborn\" title=\"\">Johnny English Reborn</a> debuted at the top just shy of \u00a35m. This weekend, many cinemas will be playing previews of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/147830/madagascar-3\" title=\"\">Madagascar 3</a>, but box-office returns won't be included until the film's official release on 19 October. Instead, look for healthy takings for <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/149648/hotel-transylvania\" title=\"\">Hotel Transylvania</a>, which has already grossed $77m in the US. Adult audiences are targeted with upscale fare including Walter Salles's Jack Kerouac adaptation <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/142861/on-the-road\" title=\"\">On the Road</a> and quirky indie romance <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/149509/ruby-sparks\" title=\"\">Ruby Sparks</a> from the directors of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/114024/little.miss.sunshine\" title=\"\">Little Miss Sunshine</a>. Action comedy <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/92010/hit-and-run\" title=\"\">Hit &amp; Run</a>, with Dax Shepard, Kristen Bell and Bradley Cooper, is hard to call.</p> <h2>Top 10 films</h2> <p><strong>1.</strong> Taken 2, \u00a37,378,048 from 506 sites (<strong>New</strong>)<br><strong>2.</strong> Looper, \u00a31,519,503 from 466 sites. <strong>Total:</strong> \u00a35,412,102<br><strong>3.</strong> Sinister, \u00a31,435,722 from 370 sites (<strong>New</strong>)<br><strong>4.</strong> The Perks of Being a Wallflower, \u00a3827,983 from 328 sites (<strong>New</strong>)<br><strong>5.</strong> ParaNorman, \u00a3797,754 from 502 sites. <strong>Total:</strong> \u00a35,263,993<br><strong>6.</strong> The Campaign, \u00a3389,287 from 382 sites. <strong>Total:</strong> \u00a31,675,159<br><strong>7.</strong> Brave, \u00a3304,735 from 449 sites. <strong>Total:</strong> \u00a321,570,349<br><strong>8.</strong> Resident Evil: Retribution, \u00a3286,350 from 331 sites. <strong>Total:</strong> \u00a31,519,851<br><strong>9.</strong> Untouchable, \u00a3245,343 from 153 sites. <strong>Total:</strong> \u00a3964,308<br><strong>10</strong>.

  "<p>I spent three years teaching at the <a href=\"http://www.theboxingacademy.co.uk/\">London Boxing Academy Community Project</a> (LBACP) in Tottenham, North London, where the 2011 summer riots began. The aim of the LBACP was the make use of the traditionally strong relationships that boxing coaches hold with wayward young men, in an educational setting.</p> <p>The students were mostly black boys, all of whom had been excluded or were at risk of exclusion. I was employed to teach at the LBACP by the Westminster thinktank <a href=\"http://www.civitas.org.uk\">Civitas</a>, which believes that with the right methods, anyone can get a decent education.</p> <p>The project was set up through the <a href=\"http://www.londonboxingacademy.co.uk\">London Boxing Academy</a>, and a later incarnation of the project called <a href=\"http://www.theboxingacademy.co.uk\">The Boxing Academy</a> (that I was not involved in) was one of the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2011/dec/09/christmas-charity-appeal-boxing-academy-london\">Guardian's chosen charities for its Christmas Appeal</a>.</p> <p>When I taught, there was always a boxer or boxing coach in the room, who served as a teaching assistant, mentor and (sometimes) minder. They were called pod leaders, and they provided positive male role models for the students. The students were taught a reduced curriculum of core subjects (to GCSE standard), and so were able to spend up to half their timetable doing sport. They liked sport, so unlike when they were in mainstream, they wanted to come to school, and this made providing them with an education enormously easier. </p> <p>My book about the project and working with the inspirational principal Chris Hall, a boxing coach of 30 years standing, is called <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Boxing-Clever-Alternative-Provision-Traditional-Relationships/dp/1906837430/ref=pd_rhf_se_p_img_2\">Boxing Clever</a>. The book is based on diaries that I kept during my time teaching.</p> <p>One of the events that I recorded in the diaries centred on a girl called Laura in the book. The students at the LBACP had a peculiar knack for getting at the truth in the most cutting, blunt manner, but Laura was exceptional. That lesson, Laura was having a temper tantrum because she did not want to work at a desk (she sat on a chair in the corner of the room). I insisted that she sat at a desk. This was around the time that I was organising a trip to Oxford University, where I had studied as an undergraduate, something that the students found fascinating. Indeed, Laura, after jumping up and smashing my plastic bin into a thousand pieces, and telling me that she was \"not some fucking dog\", and informed me quite correctly \u2013 as she was shepherded out the door by the pod leader \u2013 that I \"was not in fucking Oxford now\".</p> <p>One thing that Laura was getting at in her tirade was that there is a knowledge gap between alternative provision and the mainstream. Mainstream teachers rarely have much experience of alternative provision, and visa-versa, which is clearly to the detriment of both. So, what are the lessons for mainstream teachers from what I did?</p> <p>First, that boxing can be a solution for troublesome kids. Boxing teaches respect and self-control in extreme situations (for example, being bashed on the nose). It is an outlet for aggression. And, as I have said, boxing coaches have a record of sorting out even the most difficult of delinquents. This is partly because boxing coaches are interested in something the boys are good at, whereas most people have to concentrate on all the things they are bad at. But it is mostly because boxing coaches give up one-to-one quality time, often for nothing, when most people are just too busy. That's why Laura put up with her pod leader shepherding her out the door \u2013 she trusted him. Although we immersed our students in the sport \u2013 the school was literally in a boxing gym \u2013 it is perfectly possible to use boxing in mainstream schools. For example, I know that <a href=\"http://www.harrismerton.org.uk\">Harris Academy Merton</a> (the academy that replaced the secondary school I attended in south London) runs a <a href=\"http://www.bigtboxingclub.piczo.com/?cr=6\">mentoring programme</a> with a local boxing gym. You could too.</p> <p>Second, mainstream is not the Holy Grail. Many people ask me \"how many students went back to mainstream?\" but this question misses the point. For those students, mainstream was not the best place for them. They couldn't cope with it, and they would soon deteriorate if they went back. So consider, why do we cram everyone into mainstream schools, as if providing an education is like manufacturing a widget? The 40% or so who do not achieve the benchmark GCSE grades are deemed to have failed \u2013 so why don't we try something different with more of them than we do today? Consider, in your school, which of your students would be happier and more successful in an alternative provision project based around sport, or caring for animals, or a trade. Then, do something about it, and avoid a possible future exclusion. Who is your Laura?</p> <p>Third lesson is that kindness and care can bridge any divide. Race, class and culture are irrelevant when you show your humanity. Teachers know that, obviously - but I'm saying that it works even with the hard cases that are on the way towards exclusion. Our principal, Chris Hall was able to hold positive relationships with even the most difficult students because he genuinely liked the students, and they knew it. Chris' mantra was that \"rules without relationships ain't worth toffee\". For Chris, that meant having access to the rule-maker, so that the students could get their grievances off their chest. It also meant that Chris' relationship with the students was used to make the students want to obey the rules because they wanted to please Chris. Chris and I built those relationships by visiting the students' families in their homes, going to court to support them when they were charged with criminal offences, and by organising trips that took them out of their familiar surrounding (for example to Oxford and to the <a href=\"http://www.londonrussianballetschool.com\">ballet</a>).</p> <p>Fourth, that tragedy stalks teachers who work in the alternative provision sector. My favourite student, who I taught to read in my spare time and who I was trying to get a job for this summer, was <a href=\"http://www.tottenhamjournal.co.uk/news/crime-court/man_charged_with_murder_over_stabbing_of_tottenham_man_1_1444994\">murdered on 11 July this year</a>. He was one of the main characters in my book. I have been <a href=\"http://www.tottenhamjournal.co.uk/news/crime-court/teachers_launch_appeal_fund_for_tottenham_stab_victim_s_funeral_1_1478119\">fundraising for his funeral</a>, which is taking place this Friday. This is an extreme example of my final lesson from my time in Tottenham: that you have to be tough to work with children who are at risk of being excluded.</p> <p><em>Tom Ogg is the author of Boxing Clever - a book about his experiences teaching at the London Boxing Academy Community Project.

  "<p>The new justice secretary's announcement that he will let householders deploy \"disproportionate\" force defending homes and families has been greeted by criminal lawyers with dismay.</p> <p>Chris Grayling's determination to reform the frequently reviewed laws of self defence was described as a vote-catching initiative that will be difficult to translate into legislation.</p> <p>Speaking at the Conservative party conference in Birmingham, Grayling said: \"Being confronted by an intruder in your own home is terrifying, and the public should be in no doubt that the law is on their side. That is why I am strengthening the current law.</p> <p>\"Householders who act instinctively and honestly in self defence are victims of crime and should be treated that way. We need to dispel doubts in this area once and for all.\"</p> <p>The current law already allows people to use \"reasonable force\" to defend themselves (either at home or on the street), to protect others, to prevent crime or to protect property.</p> <p>Section 76 of the Criminal Justice and Immigration Act 2008 says the degree of force used in self-defence must be \"reasonable in the circumstances\" as the person acting genuinely believed them to be.</p> <p>The justification of acting \"honestly and instinctively\", taken from one key judgment widely relied upon, is already embedded in Crown Prosecution Service guidance.</p> <p>But the justice secretary wants to change the definition. Use of \"disproportionate force\" is not currently lawful. Grayling will allow householders to use force that they \"believed was reasonable in the circumstances but was actually disproportionate when viewed with the benefit of hindsight\", the Ministry of Justice said.</p> <p>This will, it appears, expand the current discretion of the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) to decide whether or not to prosecute. The <a href=\"http://www.cps.gov.uk/legal/s_to_u/self_defence/index.html\" title=\"\">CPS updated its guidance on the law of self defence only in May this year</a>.</p> <p>The recent case that revived interest in self-defence laws involved Andy and Tracey Ferrie, who used a legally held shotgun to defend their remote Leicestershire cottage. The intruders were injured. The Ferries were held for 40 hours by police but were not charged.</p> <p>There are relatively few prosecutions of householders who use force against intruders. An informal trawl by the CPS suggests that between 1990 and 2005 there were only 11 prosecutions of people who attacked intruders in houses, commercial premises or private land. Only seven of those resulted from domestic burglaries.</p> <p>Last month <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/sep/27/burglary-offence-person-senior-judge\" title=\"\">the lord chief justice, Lord Judge, implied there was sufficient leeway in the law as it stands </a>to protect householders from unnecessary prosecution.</p> <p>Householders who defend themselves against burglars should not be expected to exercise \"calm cool judgment\", he explained. \"You are not calmly detached. You are probably very cross and very frightened \u2013 a mixture of both \u2026 the householder is entitled to use all sorts of reasonable force to get rid of the burglar.\"</p> <p>Responding to Grayling's initiative, Michael Turner QC, chair of the Criminal Bar Association, said: \"It's a vote-catcher. There's no concept elsewhere in British law of allowing anyone to use disproportionate force for pretty obvious reasons.</p> <p>\"It's no surprise that a non-lawyer [Grayling] would come up with such a crazy idea. Are we really saying that the police should not even investigate cases [where an intruder has been injured]? I can't believe this will make it into statute.\"</p> <p>Richard Atkinson, the chair of the Law Society's criminal committee, which represents solicitors, said: \"Whatever he comes up with will have to be very clear to be well defined. Grayling is setting himself a difficult task.</p> <p>\"Will it apply to commercial property as well as homes? There needs to be consultation on it. It will have judicial consequences in many other areas.\"</p> <p>Maura McGowan QC, vice-chairman of the Bar Council, said: \"The law on self defence is perfectly clear. Householders are fully entitled to use proportionate force to defend themselves and their property, which is a principle which we support. At a time when fundamental principles of open justice are under threat from ill-considered legislation and severe cuts, it is regrettable that chasing populist headlines is top of the new justice secretary's agenda.\"</p> <p>Another criminal barrister, David Farrer QC, was equally dismissive of the proposal. \"Once again another government is pledging to reform self-defence laws,\" he said. \"We have seen the same populist sentiments from successive governments. However, the realities are that there is no need to reform the current laws.</p> <p>\"In practice, the application of the reasonable force test is perfectly straightforward and is applied to facts of each individual case. The CPS in recent years has caught the mood of the country and is making sensible decisions on bringing prosecutions in self-defence incidents.\"</p>",

  "<p>When Kevin Keegan returned from Hamburg in 1980 <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVLJsxyIX-o\">he captured his love of England in song</a>. Over simple acoustic strumming \u2013&#xa0;think Mull of Kintyre with a higher tempo and fewer bagpipes \u2013 he sang: \"Oh how I yearn to be home again... we'll sit by the fireside and sing, we'll walk down a country lane on Sunday morning.\" </p> <p>Keegan has always been a patriot, but his romanticised view of England has not always caught the imagination of those around him. His paean to the nation failed to chart and he ended his international career on a Wembley toilet.</p> <p>Keegan resigned from the role of England manager 12 years ago this week. His team had played poorly at Euro 2000 and were then beaten at home to Germany in the last game at the old Wembley. They lost to <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTlmD8oIzt8\">a single Dietmar Hamman goal</a> \u2013&#xa0;a free-kick from well outside the box that should have been saved by David Seaman.</p> <p>David Davies tells the story of what happened after the match in his diary, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2009/aug/01/fa-confidential-david-davies-review\">FA Confidential</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>The old Wembley closed down in humiliation. Even the heavens wept for England. But no one at the FA could have predicted what happened next. On entering the dressing room, I couldn't believe the scene. Steam poured out of the showers, making it difficult to see who was where, but I glimpsed Kevin in one corner. Tony Adams, David Beckham and other players sat around in various states of undress.</p> <p>'David, you tell him not to do it,' shouted Tony, who was completely fired up. <br>'David, he'll listen to you,' pleaded Becks, who was in tears. <br>'What?' <br>'Talk to him,' Tony said. <br>'Who?' <br>'Kevin!' Tony and David both yelled. <br>They didn't need to tell me what Kevin had done. He'd thrown in the towel. I knew it. I looked at Kevin. </p> <p>'Don't leave. You have to stay.' <br>'No, no, no,' Kevin replied. 'I'm off. I'm not for this.' <br>'This isn't happening,' I thought. I wasn't prepared mentally for such a situation. Think fast. Calm things down. Lock away the emotions. Shift into work mode. <br>'Come on, let's go,' said Kevin, 'I'm ready to face the press.' <br>'No, you're bloody not. We're having a talk before you go anywhere near the press.' </p> <p>Where on earth could we find that was private? The tunnel? Crawling with television reporters. The dressing room? Heaving with emotional players. The bath area? I couldn't hold a vital conversation with an England manager as players dived into the water. Only one option presented itself. The toilet cubicles. A dramatic moment in England's long football history occurred in the ancient loos of a stadium facing demolition. The impending destruction could almost be smelled in the air. </p> <p>Dragging Kevin into a cubicle, I shut the door behind us. We stood there, facing each other. 'You can't change my mind,' Kevin said. 'I'm out of here. I'm not up to it. I'm going out to the press to tell them I'm not up to it. I can't motivate the players. I can't get the extra bit out of these players that I need.' </p> </blockquote> <h2>King Kevin abdicates again: Where now for England?</h2> <p><em>David Lacey, writing a few days after Keegan's resignation, summed up the predicament facing the FA:</em></p> <p>Of the 10 men who have been in charge of the England football team over the past 54 years, Kevin Keegan will be remembered as a cheerleader who denied Wembley one last hurrah and then quit while he was behind. Keegan's sudden resignation five minutes after his team had lost Saturday's World Cup qualifier 1-0 to Germany concludes the most bizarre period yet in the quirky history of national managers.</p> <p>The England coach had taken over 20 months ago after the Football Association's decision to sack Glenn Hoddle once the prime minister, put on the spot in a day-time television chat show, had muttered that if Hoddle really had implied the disabled were paying for the sins of past lives he ought to go. In view of what has happened now Hoddle might have been referring to the FA international committee, for if ever a body is reaping the whirlwind of past misdeeds it is surely this one.</p> <p>Bobby Robson took England to the semi-finals of the 1990 World Cup but his contract was not renewed, Terry Venables had already decided not to sign a fresh contract by the time England reached the last four of Euro 96, the committee having expressed doubts about his legal wrangles with Alan Sugar and the Department of Trade and Industry, and Hoddle's sin was to express his beliefs clumsily to a national newspaper.</p> <p>The timing of Keegan's departure was totally predictable. His temperament and lack of tactical nous made him a bad choice from the start. When he originally agreed to take the job for four matches, while remaining manager of Fulham, he promised that the players would sing the national anthem with passion and bring a similar mood to their performances. Well, not all of the team were singing before Saturday's match and not enough of them were in harmony during the game to form a barbershop quartet.</p> <p>Keegan also stressed that he would not leave Fulham once his four-match stint had ended. After two games in charge, however, he decided that \"it's time to stop playing games: I want the job\". On Saturday he again decided it was time to stop playing games, only now he believed he was not up to the job after all. In other words, after taking the England post saying I'm sorry I'll read that again, he has abandoned it admitting I'm sorry I haven't a clue.</p> <p>Keegan's plea of mea culpa \u2013 \"I'm blaming nobody but myself. I wasn't good enough\" \u2013 the revelation that during England's awful first half that he did not know what to do, his apparent self-sacrifice in order to hand the squad over to someone with more knowledge and the hardly original thought that he wants to spend more time with his family will cut little ice with experienced Kev-watchers.</p> <p>He has walked out after a defeat that made it imperative that he stayed for at least four more days in order to give England the best chance of repairing the damage, serious though hardly mortal, to their chances of qualifying for the World Cup caused by an initial home defeat. Instead of which Howard Wilkinson, the FA's technical director, will again pop up like George, the inflatable automatic pilot in Airplane, to take over the team for Wednesday's qualifier in Finland.</p> <p>When Don Revie quit on England during a World Cup qualifying campaign the FA tried, unsuccessfully, to ban him from football for 10 years. True, Keegan did not conduct covert negotiations with the United Arab Emirates before giving his resignation exclusively to a newspaper, but his defection is scarcely more admirable.</p> <p>If, as he insists, he enjoyed the full support of everybody at the FA from the chairman to the Lancaster Gate cat then surely he could have given the job one more chance.</p> <p>Keegan's excuse that the fans who clamoured successfully for his appointment had helped him make up his mind on Saturday by booing him as he left the arena is barely worth consideration. If every England manager had walked out after being jeered at Wembley Alf Ramsey, Ron Greenwood, Bobby Robson, Graham Taylor and Glenn Hoddle would not have lasted anywhere near as long as they did.</p> <p>According to Adam Crozier, the FA's chief executive who has limited experience of these things: \"It is never easy to say I'm not going to be England coach any more. To walk away from that is a very courageous thing to do.\" Yet surely it would have been even more courageous to stay put, tough it out, and risk the probability of being ditched by the FA if the team also lost in Helsinki.</p> <p>It is not as if Keegan had a rough ride from the media, who let him down relatively lightly after the debacle of Euro 2000. He was never vilified in the press as Robson was more than once. He was never lampooned as cruelly as Taylor nor hung out to dry like Hoddle. The heat in Keegan's kitchen barely rose above gas mark one.</p> <p>Crozier was nearer the mark, albeit unwittingly,when he observed that \"I think Kevin Keegan knew he was making the right decision for Kevin Keegan \". That is surely the point.</p> <p>On Saturday Keegan made all the right self-deprecatory noises in the interviews. He is a master of the soundbite and it is a pity that his tactical know-how in handling reporters' questions was not matched by an ability to organise the England team.</p> <p>\"I just feel that for Kevin Keegan there is nothing more in football I want to do,\" he said a trifle wistfully. Presumably this precludes returning to TV as a soccer pundit. Surely he can never sit in judgment on England again having admitted that he did not know enough when he was in charge.</p> <h2>The aftermath</h2> <p>Tony Banks, the former Sports Minister who led England's failed bid for the 2006 World Cup, blamed \"half-arsed journalists\" and the \"self-appointed experts\" in the crowd who had jeered Keegan. But the manager admitted he had not been up to the job: \"I just don't feel I can find that little bit extra you need at this level to find a winning formula. I just feel I have given it my best shot. I don't want to outstay my welcome.\"</p> <p>Keegan later admitted that he had not enjoyed his time as England manager: \"I found it soulless. I found it hard to fill in the time. I found myself going and training the blind team, the deaf team, working with the ladies team. It's a very difficult job.\"</p> <h2>The replacement</h2> <p>When it came to replacing Keegan, there was a dearth of English candidates. Peter Taylor took over the job as caretaker for a single defeat to Italy, but was never really in contention. In a typical bout of doublespeak, Harry Redknapp distanced himself from the position: \"I cannot think of a worse job. Whoever takes it, three or four months down the line will be getting abused. The simple truth is, no matter what side you pick, we don't seem to look good enough. I cannot think of a worse job.\"</p> <p>Terry Venables wasn't optimistic about his chances: \"It's well documented that the FA didn't want to go back before Kevin took the job, which meant going back to me, so I think that rules me out.\"</p> <p>Writing in the Guardian, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2000/oct/27/sport.comment\">Ron Atkinson decried Roy Hodgson's chances</a>: \"I don't want to decry Roy because he has worked very hard to get where he is, but we are talking about the England national job here. Someone who has been as successful as him in Switzerland is Christian Gross, but would anybody be touting him as Kevin Keegan 's successor?\" </p> <p>Howard Wilkinson was given this assessment by one Guardian writer: \"Motivational skills: None, unless you are a believer in gobbledegook. Tactical awareness: Great if you like the ball hoofed higher than a sponsor's blimp. Temperament: Drone, drone, drone (think William Hague). Verdict: Would be totally outclassed.\"</p> <p>When the merits of foreign coaches were condsidered, the Guardian leader warned applicants to be wary of the Sun. Perhaps Sven G\u00f6ran-Eriksson would have preferred a heads-up about their sister paper, the News of the World:</p> <blockquote> <p>To judge from the views which have poured into websites, most fans believe there are only two options for filling the vacancy. First: Terry Venables second: someone else. Someone else, this time, might not be English. One ingenious pundit says the FA should go back to Fulham, where they found Mr Keegan, and hire his French successor, Jean Tigana. </p> <p>Stuffy old cricket dared to do it, engaging the Zimbabwean Duncan Fletcher, and last season's performance suggests it may have paid off. Yet any foreign import who takes the job will need to be a stupendous success, since otherwise the sort of obloquy which came the way of Graham Taylor, Glenn Hoddle and others will break out all over again, but this time with added xenophobia. Even the Sun, contenders should be aware, knows the French for \"turnip\".</p> </blockquote> <p>In the end, Sven Goran-Eriksson took the job and became the first foreigner to manage England. He is now the technical director of BEC Tero Sasana FC in Bangkok, Thailand. Contrary to the reasoning of David Lacey, Keegan is now a pundit.

In ten easy steps, Google lays out the most important things developers needs to do for their tablet apps to be successful, including optimizing for larger screens, taking advantage of a tablet's extra space, and adjusting fonts and widgets.</p> </blockquote> <h2><a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/122b5704-116d-11e2-a637-00144feabdc0.html#axzz28k2ekvxU\">Cisco cuts ties with ZTE after Iran sales &gt;&gt; FT.com</a></h2> <blockquote> <p>Cisco said it had cut ties with ZTE after an internal probe revealed that the Chinese company had sold Cisco's equipment to Iran.</p> <p> Sales of US technology products to Iran have been banned by the US government, but ZTE is understood to have sold Cisco internet routers to the company that controls the Telecommunication Company of Iran (TCI).</p> </blockquote> <p> Coming after the Huawei/ZTE criticisms by the House Intelligence Committe, this starts to look like a trend.</p> <h2><a href=\"http://allthingsd.com/20121008/for-better-or-worse-emirates-passengers-can-now-yammer-on-their-cell-phones-in-flight/?refcat=news\">Emirates passengers can now yammer on their cellphones in flight &gt;&gt; AllThingsD</a></h2> <blockquote> <p>Dubai-based Emirates said Monday that it will start letting passengers on its A380 aircraft talk using their cellphones while in flight.</p> <p> The service works with standard phones in conjunction with OnAir, the company that provides Wi-Fi service for Emirates' aircraft.</p> <p> The only major limitation is that, per Federal Aviation Administration rules, the phones can't be used over the US, so the service shuts down within 250 miles of the States.</p> </blockquote> <p> \"Dubai more technologically flexible than US\" isn't a phrase you expect to hear often.</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/technology/2012/10/iphone_5_review_marveling_at_the_existence_of_the_greatest_phone_ever_made_.single.html\">iPhone 5 review: Marveling at the existence of the greatest phone ever made &gt;&gt; Slate Magazine</a></h2> <p>Farhad Majoo: </p> <blockquote> <p>All top-of-the-line smartphones on the market today do pretty much the same things. Since they've all got similar specs--superfast LTE networking, great cameras, great displays, app stores that carry most of the apps people want--the only reason you would choose one over the other is personal taste. If you like a wider screen, you might go with the Samsung Galaxy SIII. If you like Windows' more informative start screen, you'd go with something made by Nokia. The iPhone's unique comparative advantage is build quality: If you want a phone that is a pleasure to hold, one that just looks and feels better, there's no equal on the market. No other phone is even close.</p> </blockquote> <p> A month ago Manjoo reckoned the iPhone 5 was \"boring\".

First, Americans don't like the idea that marketers are collecting data about their online behavior and shopping habits.
