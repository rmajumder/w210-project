  "<p>Four giddy years and an entire adolescence in the making, Tom Daley's home Olympics are in danger of unravelling with not so much a splash as a ripple. Daley finished 15th out of 18 qualifiers in the preliminaries for Saturday's final rounds of the 10m platform dive, an event in which he was world champion in 2009.</p> <p>It was a terribly disappointing display from Britain's most celebrated water Olympian in a high-class field. Amid some exuberant dives from the Mexicans and further refined excellence from the gold medal favourite Qiu Bo, Daley's performance was notable mainly for the contrast between his own edginess and the enduringly shrill and hopeful home support that greeted this long-time face of the Games every time he approached the ladder in Stratford.</p> <p>\"It was a tough competition,\" Daley said afterwards. \"I don't normally compete at that time of night for one, and there were 32 competitors. Having to wait for half an hour between dives was tough. At the end my legs were starting to get tired. I've done my job today but not by the most comfortable of margins.\"</p> <p>Daley's fate at these Olympics came down to his last dive of six, at which point he was placed 26th. He did enough to take him into an early-morning semi-final while Pete Waterfield, also disappointing, finished well outside the qualification. For Daley Saturday is another day while there was a certain hopefulness to his insistence a night-time final would not be a problem this time.</p> <p>\"That's different,\" he said. \"You've got the final atmosphere so you know it counts, whereas here you know it doesn't actually count towards the medals. You never know what can happen at the Olympic Games.\"</p> <p>Ranged beneath the undulating whale's-belly roof of the Aquatics Centre, the Daley-ites had returned in numbers to witness the end-game of his own four-year Olympic odyssey. Germ\u00e1n S\u00e1nchez of Mexico raised the first gasps with a stunning opening dive, while Qiu summoned a moment of almost eerie calm at the lip of the board before posting the best dive of the first round (his second half an hour later was near faultless).</p> <p>And so at last it was Daley time. Cue the flags and that rolling wave of diffuse hysteria as Daley composed himself and produced a rather stunning moment of anticlimax. It was his signature dive, the Twister, but the execution was taut and the entry slack. The cheers were politely deafening but Daley's dive left him in 17th place.</p> <p>This event is a wonderful piece of theatre in its own right, a plunge from a genuinely alarming height that sees divers entering the water at a whiplash-friendly 35mph. It also felt \u2013 inevitably \u2013 like a terribly poignant sporting metaphor as Daley stood on his Olympic perch, four years in the construction, ready to plummet into unforgiving waters. The roars reverberated as he mounted the board again. An inward 3\u00bd somersault was executed with greater \u00e9lan but the entry was still ragged. Daley improved again with his third dive, producing a fine armstand back triple somersault to bump himself into ninth position.</p> <p>Perhaps the nerves were understandable. Daley has had the toughest of years and only the hardest heart would not wish him a medal of some colour; not just as fitting decoration to this fine Team GB showing but mainly because of his own rather tender and tortured narrative. This is a young man who has spent his entire adolescence menaced by the looming spectre of these Olympics, a bum-fluffed face of the Games who has assumed the burden of prolonged expectancy even while, away from domestic eyes, the Chinese diving programme bore its own brilliant fruits. Daley has responded by upping his own training regime and even making rather delicate attempts at dampening expectations.</p> <p>It is, of course, too late for that. A mob-handed corporate sub-structure has nourished the Daley persona since Beijing, providing not just teen appeal but ample sponsorial heft. It is a peculiarly self-sustaining celebrity. \"Britain's Tom Daley has everything but a medal\" ran one rather dry headline in the Wall Street Journal this week and voices from within the coaching fraternity have already suggested his commercial activities have been a distraction, contrasting with the asceticism of the Chinese. This week there was even a localised fanfare when Daley passed 1m followers on Twitter.</p> <p>On a night of strangely edgy 10m diving it began to look as though this might be his only significant landmark of these Games. Daley's fifth dive was his worst of the competition and left him briefly facing disaster. Cue that last-ditch rally to make the cut. \"My legs just started to get a bit shaky and I generally felt tired,\" he said. \"I was trying to keep up my energy but the home crowd definitely got my adrenaline pumping on the last dive.\" Qiu finished first here and appeared awesomely composed. Behind him his team-mate Lin Yue and Sasha Klein of Germany also looked a cut above the rest.</p>",
  "<h2>Gulliver's Travels, Edinburgh</h2> <p>Romanian director Silviu Purcarete put on a very showy Faust at the 2009 Edinburgh International festival \u2013 a spectacular and seductive performance of Goethe's morality tale with more than 100 actors \u2013 and returns to give Jonathan Swift's satire his devilish treatment. In fact, Swift's journey into human behavior \u2013 which also operates as a send-up of travellers' tall tales \u2013 should suit Purcarete, whose production will be very much guided by the musical score specially created by Belfast-born composer Shaun Davey. Aimed very much at an adult audience, the play explores themes of immigration and exile in an interpretation of the classic story that gave us such memorable creations as the island of Lilliput and its tiny inhabitants.</p> <p><strong><em>King's, Fri to 20 Aug</em></strong></p> <p><em>Lyn Gardner</em></p> <h2>2008: Macbeth, Edinburgh</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-394508436\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/9/1344530853343/2008-Macbeth.-004.jpg\" alt=\"2008: Macbeth.\" width=\"220\" height=\"132\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">2008: Macbeth.

The old adage suggests that children should be seen and not heard, but they are given a voice in this experimental new piece created by Chris Goode, a theatre-maker of infinite talent and infinite compassion. Based on verbatim conversations with more than 30 children aged between eight and 10, and exploring such issues as being scared, getting lost and growing up, the piece offers a unique, first-hand perspective on what it's like being a child.

  "<h2>Roy Ayers, Brecon &amp; London</h2> <p>His work has been sampled by stars including Erykah Badu and Ice Cube, he was a key figure in the acid jazz movement, and he's been dubbed \"the Godfather of neo soul\". The contemporary musical influence of vibraphonist and vocalist Roy Ayers remains so vibrant that it's startling to recall he's now in his 70s, and his original inspiration came at five, when swing-era bandleader Lionel Hampton gave him his first pair of vibes mallets. Ayers splices smooth jazz, disco, funk, Afrobeat and hip-hop, and his live shows blend the instincts of a pop-musical visionary and a consummate entertainer.</p> <p><strong><em>Market Hall, Brecon, Sat; Ronnie Scott's, W1, Mon to 18 Aug </em></strong></p> <p><em>John Fordham</em></p> <h2><a href=\"http://summersundae.com\" title=\"\">Summer Sundae</a>, Leicester</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-394526188\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/9/1344513095577/Django-Django-004.jpg\" alt=\"Django Django\" width=\"220\" height=\"132\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Django Django</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Now in its 12th year, Summer Sundae is the festival equivalent of a commuter town \u2013 most of the benefits of a traditional event (good bands; a not unattractive location) while enjoying prosaic but valuable features like being 10 minutes walk from decent transport links.

Christina Ryat (you pronounce it \"riot\") is the latest artist to have been signed up, and it's not hard to see why. At first listen to her debut album, Totem, it's probably Ryat's voice that grabs you the most, sounding \u2013 with its stage whisper phrasing \u2013 not entirely unlike Bj\u00f6rk's. Under that surface similarity though, there's a lot of strong electronic business going on too: this is an album that recalls the busiest moments of Aphex Twin, drum'n'bass, and, occasionally, recent Radiohead. Live, meanwhile, Ryat generates much the same energy. Working with her array of keyboards and samples, hers is a physical and occasionally theatrical performance, as she spins the many plates of her music: vocal samples, keyboards, and chaotic drum patterns.</p> <p><strong><em>Lightbox, SW8, Fri</em></strong></p> <p><em>JR</em></p> <h2><a href=\"http://greenman.net\" title=\"\">Green Man Festival</a>, Crickhowell</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-394526190\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/9/1344513251544/Mogwai-004.jpg\" alt=\"Mogwai\" width=\"220\" height=\"132\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mogwai</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Never mind a revival, these days \"folk\" has become a high street commodity.

  "<p>Ariel Pink stands alone like an ice-cream van in winter. He's a hyper-intelligent, pot-bellied, beady-eyed, apple-bong-smoking composer from Beverly Hills. His varied life has turned him from a sheltered child in therapy into a maverick who sings about castration and sausages. In terms of eccentricity, he has no rivals.</p> <p>There isn't enough of it left in music. Sure, there's a faint smudge of strangeness running across 2012 \u2013 Madonna (breast, guns), Lana Del Rey (lips, acting), MIA (middle finger), etc. But Ariel Pink makes them look like anaesthetised Ellie Gouldings. In a hunt for the ones who inspire WTFs, OMGs and exclamation marks that turn into 1s because you're too excited to hold down shift, he's right there, on his own, and we need him.</p> <p>His new album Mature Themes, his ninth official release, includes a song called Driftwood (a title made famous in 1999 by wet, boring Scottish men singing about a wet, boring thing) in which he barks madly about \"the bad breath of a cross-eyed goat\". Lyrically, it's full of schnitzels, nymphomaniacs, pink slime, \"blow jobs of death\", dreams, American primitives, assassins and G-spots.</p> <p>The world outside his records is one of meltdowns, hoax band break-ups, ridiculous interviews, self-hate and the refusal to buy clothes, appease anyone or partake in life as we know it. The inevitable on-stage meltdown came at Coachella in 2011. Ariel shouted, \"You hate me,\" stormed off into the wings, and returned to crouch, smoking under a keyboard, as his band played on. On the YouTube clip (Ariel Pink: Master Of His Craft Or Piece Of Crap?) a disappointed teenager comments, \"He disengaged with every other human.\" Hello, suburban American youngster? That's the whole point.</p> <p>Ariel's tics make him irresistible and vital. During a recent phone interview conducted from his LA bedroom at 4am his time, Ariel hung up on me twice then asked me for a cigarette. In the year he got his first smartphone, he has used it to ask Tyler, The Creator to make his next video via Twitter (@menopausemen) and to joke about his band's break-up on Facebook. He uses it to self-record himself \"mouth-drumming\", too. Imagine the contents of that voice memos folder.</p> <p>We should salute Ariel Pink. Music is too impatient to accept weirdness and unpredictability at the moment, and as a result, he's the only one we've got.</p> <p>So, let him into your life. Love him. It might seem difficult \u2013 and immersing yourself in the work of an artist who shrieks very specific fast food orders in a woman's voice for four minutes (Schnitzel Boogie) won't be easy \u2013 but you'll be okay. As he says on Symphony Of The Nymph: \"I'm just a rock'n'roller from Beverly Hills. My name is Ariel Pink.\"</p> <p><strong><em>Mature Themes is released on 4AD on 20 August</em></strong></p>",
  "<p>\u2712Years ago I was with a group having a drink in the Earl of Onslow pub in West Clandon, Surrey, when in walked the Earl of Onslow (now, sadly, deceased. He was a strange man in some ways, but he was very funny and he bought his round.) The family house and land are in the village.</p> <p>Anyhow, we could not have been much more surprised if we'd been in the King's Head and Charles II had appeared with Nell Gwyn and a couple of spaniels. One thing Onslow said was that every decade or so, someone tries to reform the House of Lords (he was one of the elected peerage, if that makes sense) and it always fails. So everyone sits back and says, \"you know, it actually works quite well\". Which it does.</p> <p>Then a few years later, they try again. It's happened this week. It's absurd that we are one of the few countries in the world that has a non-elected upper house. On the other hand, the US Senate is one of the most dysfunctional legislatures in the free world. I don't think Nick Clegg should be too worried.</p> <p>\u2712May I be allowed to join those who are delighted to be proved wrong about the Olympics? We grumbled about the expense, the G4S security screw-up, the ghastly sponsors (\"proud to accept only Visa\" says a little placard on the food vans. What next? \"Sorry, we have self-esteem issues with MasterCard \u2026\")</p> <p>Anyhow, following Boris Johnson's lead, here are 10 things I have really liked about the Olympics.</p> <p><strong>1</strong> London has been such a great place. Normally it is a morose, grumpy city, but for two weeks it's been warm, friendly, and buzzing. And I like helping foreign visitors round; it's easy, and they're very grateful. \"I'm afraid that due to three separate signal failures, it's impossible to reach the Olympic Park except by rickshaw.\" \"Why, thank you, sir\".</p> <p><strong>2</strong> The sheer efficiency and energy of all the helpers, including those soldiers denied leave. Yes, there is the occasional familiar sound of a British person given a uniform \u2013 even a red and purple nylon uniform \u2013 relishing the chance to order other people around. But for the most part, all the helpers are incredibly engaging and helpful.</p> <p><strong>3</strong> The BBC's coverage. Eat the crunchy cinders of humiliation, Sky. For a fraction of what they charge for their service we can get every single moment of the action, even BMX and kayaking. Yes, they still have their standard lines for when British athletes fail \u2013 \"she needs a great performance now\" means \"she doesn't have a prayer\". \"He's going to give it everything he's got\" equals \"he doesn't have a prayer.\"</p> <p>But overall it's been superb. And if you agree that it's too Britcentric, you haven't seen the American coverage. It must come as a surprise for their viewers to discover that any other countries are taking part.</p> <p><strong>4</strong> The Aussies are spitting tacks at their poor results. In public they're being laidback \u2013 \"for us, silver is the new gold,\" said one of their reporters. In private, I know from Australian friends, they are in a rug-biting rage. And to be more or less level with New Zealand: the pain just goes on throbbing. As Gore Vidal nearly said, \"it is not enough to win; Australia has to lose.\" Let's call them \"the plucky island nation\" \u2013 that'll rile them even more.</p> <p><strong>5</strong> President Hollande came over early, at the point where GB were doing worse than France. He said that we were \"rolling out the red carpet for French medal winners\", a sarky rejoinder to Cameron's silly remark about unfurling the red carpet for rich French tax avoiders. Didn't quite work out like that, did it Frankie? M. Hollande increasingly reminds me of Jacques Tati's M. Hulot, calmly spreading chaos everywhere he goes. Yet Hulot always retained a certain poise and dignity, a trick which seems to evade the president.</p> <p><strong>6</strong> They have provided 150,000 condoms for 10,800 athletes in the Olympic village. Since one condom is enough for a couple that is around two dozen per pair over 17 days. Quite a party.</p> <p><strong>7</strong> The beach volleyball in Whitehall is terrific fun, with lots of music and dancing and everyone having a marvellous, even joyful time. We saw the men's match between Holland and Switzerland, supporting Switzerland because we have friends there. But we didn't know which of their four official languages to use. \"Come on, you Cantona Helvetica!\" doesn't have a ring.I was also delighted to learn that you aren't obliged to eat McDonald's. A hog roast bap, admittedly at \u00a37, contained a mountain of delectable moist meat, with a tangy apple sauce and two big chunks of crispy crackling. Luscious.</p> <p><strong>8</strong> The keirin cycling. Apparently keirin is a Japanese sport devised entirely for gambling. The riders are led, before he peels away, by an elderly man in a motorised bike, which looks very sweet.</p> <p><strong>9</strong> Joanna Rowsell, the gold-winning track cyclist, who proudly took off her helmet to reveal that she has alopecia. \"I'm bald \u2013 deal with it!\" was a brave and heartening gesture.</p> <p><strong>10</strong> The two women from Saudi Arabia and Palestine who ran in hijabs. They lost their heats, but were cheered as if they had won.</p> <p>\u2712But I don't get this \"inspiring a generation\" stuff. We should recognise that most schoolchildren don't like taking part in sport. As a member of my year's fifth XV at my (state) school I prayed for rain every Thursday afternoon. I could run a bit and if I had had a strict training regime, a tough diet, and given up all other activities I might have been bidding for bronze in the all-Leicestershire schools 100 yards (under-15s), which is not exactly Olympic glory. So I was, like 99% of my generation, inspired to watch TV and listen to pop records instead.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 13 August 2012. The original said the UK was one of only two countries in the world that had an unelected second house. Only the UK and Lesotho have a system that allows some members of the second chamber to inherit their office. Other countries have wholly appointed second houses.</p>",
  "<p><strong>The Guilty One</strong> by Lisa Ballantyne (Piatkus, \u00a36.99)<br>Similar in some ways to Simon Lelic's&#xa0;recent <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/dec/16/thrillers-reviews-roundups\" title=\"\"><em>The Child Who</em></a>, this moving, insightful debut focuses on the relationship between Sebastian, a child accused of murder, and his solicitor Daniel, who has shrugged off his own damaged childhood but is forced to confront his demons by the disturbing strangeness of Sebastian's case and the death of his estranged foster mother Minnie (a fantastic character). Its conclusion is nail-biting courtroom drama, but this is really a novel about behavioural and class boundaries. The wealthy, like Sebastian's parents, abuse their children but are left alone by social services. Working-class Daniel, by contrast, was removed from his drug-addict mother at 11 \u2013 the same age Sebastian is now \u2013 and transformed by Minnie's tough love.

He has, however, the same urges and weaknesses as his Christian colleagues \u2013 notably a drink problem; his religion is relevant to the case, but never used by Culver to make political points. The plot turns on Rashid's efforts to find his niece's killer. It involves a vampire youth cult and feels a bit 2006, a bit leadenly post-<em>Twilight</em>. (The Abbey is a club in an old church, where the vampires hang out and drink blood.) It's no masterpiece, but it is a properly good, as opposed to merely competent, mass-market thriller, and that's impressive when you consider its self-published origins.<br><strong>The Guardian</strong> by David Hosp (Macmillan, \u00a312.99)<br>This standalone effort from lawyer Hosp introduces a new hero in CIA agent Jack Saunders. There are shades of <em>The Moonstone</em> about its McGuffin \u2013 a jewel-studded knife called \"The Heart of Afghanistan\", with the power to determine who controls the country. It has been stolen first by the Taliban and now by Charlie Phelan, a corrupt army clerk responsible for shipping. When weedy Charlie surfaces in Boston trying to offload it on to a local gangster, his disgraced-war-hero-with-a-diploma-from-the-school-of-hard-knocks sister Cianna gets involved. And Cianna, as Hosp never tires of reminding us, is hot stuff, with her red hair and \"tight, fit\" body. Every (male) conversation about her seems to begin or end with the line: \"I hear she's very attractive.\" Hosp is a decent storyteller and <em>The Guardian</em> is an absorbing read, despite the stock characters and the pall of ordinariness hanging over the writing.<br><strong>The Falcons of Fire and Ice</strong> by Karen Maitland (Michael Joseph, \u00a312.99)<br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/fiction/9780141031910/company-of-liars\" title=\"\"><em>Company of Liars</em></a> author Maitland swaps medieval England for Portugal in 1539 \u2013 a country in the grip of the Inquisition. After her father, the Portuguese royal falconer, is arrested on a false charge of heresy, Isabela can prevent his execution only by travelling alone to Iceland to capture two rare falcons. Maitland's teeming novel strives for epic status, jumping around between narrators and countries, giving us oracle twins, a powerless child king and a wily adventurer who may not be what he seems. If its Hammer Horror version of history is hard to take seriously, you can't fault it as (gruesome) spectacle. Maitland's language feels simultaneously authentic and modern: \"Move aside, you useless pail of piss,\" etc. Invigorating.</p>",
  "<p>Joachim Fest was the editor of Albert Speer's correspondence, as well as the author of an early biography of Adolf Hitler and the definitive account of the last days of the Third Reich. But if his subject matter was challenging, then he had a personality to match. Not only a noted historian, he was a public intellectual of rigour, unrelenting in his pursuit of the issue at hand.</p> <p>During the bitter historians' dispute in the 80s about the Holocaust, referred to as the <em>Historikerstreit</em>, Fest argued tenaciously against the \"singularity\" of the Holocaust; an iconoclastic position at the time, and still controversial \u2013 and painful \u2013 to many now. Co-publisher of the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, one of Germany's most respected broadsheets, Fest was&#xa0;a thorn in the side of the West German leftist intellectual orthodoxy before the fall of the Wall. His great value as a journalist was that he could cut through to the nub of a question, often with a cool, if cruel, wit. Take his response to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/guntergrass\" title=\"\">G\u00fcnter Grass</a>'s Waffen SS membership, revealed 50 years after the fact. \"I can't understand how someone who for decades set himself up as a moral authority, and rather a smug one, could pull this off.\"</p> <p>So the uncompromising \"Not Me\" of the title seems entirely in keeping with Fest's character. Actually, it was his father's maxim, taken from the Matthew's gospel: \"Others betray you, not I.\" Fest had an early grounding in intransigence, and this is what makes this memoir so intriguing. It covers not his career, but rather his passage into adulthood during the Third Reich.</p> <p>The family milieu is fascinating, and will be unfamiliar to most British readers. Fest's parents were devout Catholics, proudly Prussian, and had been ardent supporters of the Weimar Republic. Regarding both communists&#xa0;and Nazis with deep distrust, they kept company with like-minded political activists and intellectual Catholic clergy, and had many close Jewish friends.</p> <p>Great weight was given to learning in this circle, and Fest marks the stages of his formative years by the books he was given to read. At his boarding school in Freiburg, southern Germany, he buried himself in Schiller's <em>Wallenstein </em>\"throughout the autumn and early winter of the Russian campaign, so that for me, Freiburg is forever associated with Schiller and as an absurd contrast to the ice storms and blizzards outside Moscow\".</p> <p>Immersed in both high culture and current events, the young Fest was also taken seriously by the adults who passed through his household. This was evidently stimulating for a quick and developing mind, and perhaps also established the intellectual certainty that so marked him out in adulthood. After Fest made clear to his headmaster how parochial he thought him, his fellow pupils asked: \"Have you no manners?\" \"I certainly did, I retorted, but only where there was mutual respect.\"</p> <p>The author's bone-dry humour is evident throughout the memoir. It emerges as just one of the many defences the family had to cultivate to endure the Nazi era. They lived with poverty, social exclusion, and under constant threat of visits from the Gestapo, but Fest doesn't take the moral high ground. If ever a book demonstrated the slow but seemingly unstoppable reach of tyranny, even into the private realm, it is this one. He shows how tempting compromise becomes, even while it remains loathsome, and bears witness to the cost and limits of individual courage.</p> <p>His memories of his father are particularly affecting in this regard. Johannes Fest was a school teacher, whose repeated refusal to join the Nazi party led to him being banned from employment. From 1933 until the end of the war, this intelligent and energetic man was reduced to an observer, watching the gradual erosion of civil society around him, first with incredulity and then with horror. He concentrated his efforts on his immediate circle, urging Jewish friends to leave, and seeing off the Hitler Youth who came calling to forcibly recruit his sons.</p> <p>Fest absorbed his father's scathing view of the regime, scratching caricatures of Hitler on to his school desk. At the meeting that confirmed his subsequent expulsion, Fest's father put his arms about him \u2013 a rare and bravely public show of approbation. His blessing was not easily won. Of Fest's chosen field, his father said the Third Reich was \"no more than a gutter subject. Hitler's supporters came from the gutter and that's where they belonged. Historians like myself were giving them a historical dignity to which they were not entitled\".</p> <p>Fest senior learnt of the developing Holocaust through friends, and his sense of impotence must have been intolerable; it certainly left its scars. When his sons entreated him to write about his experiences after the war, he responded: \"I did not want to talk about it then, and I do not want to now. It reminds me that there was absolutely nothing I could do with my knowledge.\" While others accepted requisitioned villas in leafy suburbs from the Allies, Fest senior refused. \"For compensation, my father had only the knowledge of meeting his own rigorous principles.\"</p> <p><em>Not Me</em> is a quiet, proud, often painful, always clear-eyed memoir. That it was a bestseller in Germany is perhaps not surprising, but it surely deserves wide attention in the English-speaking world. It is illuminating of the man, of the times he lived through, and also of a rare kind of moral resolve, both sobering and inspiring.</p> <p>\u2022 Rachel Seiffert's <em>Afterwards</em> is published by Heinemann.</p>",
  "<p>If the Hungary-Ukraine border is the first hurdle of the inaugural Central Asia Rally, we have collided with the top of it and landed on our chins. The Ukrainians are asking for \u20ac10,000 per car to let us through, citing a highly dubious claim about our Hungarian registration plates.</p> <p>The idea behind the rally is simple: buy a load of old bangers in Budapest, drive them east for 18 days and finally sell them again in Dushanbe, capital of Tajikistan. The customs officers, though, aren't impressed by the export plates which are fitted to most of the 10 vehicles taking part. The extraordinary \"deposit\" will get us through this red tape, but there's a sense within the group that in this part of the world corruption is the only thing more widespread than bureaucracy. We aren't going to hand over a cent.</p> <p>Earlier this morning, just as we were about to leave the Hungarian capital, tour coordinator Attila Berenyi gave an impassioned speech to the rally's 30 participants. \"There will be problems,\" he said. \"We will face challenges. But one way or another \u2013 with your car or without it \u2013 you will make it to Dushanbe.\"</p> <p>Now people are cursing his prescience. The rally is managed with \"minimum assistance\" from the organisers \u2013 individual problem-solving is encouraged \u2013 but people didn't expect such calamity so early. The group splits to try to find their own route eastward, agreeing to aim to meet up again in Kazakhstan. A Portuguese team decide to take their chances with officials in Serbia in the hope of getting on their smooth highway. A Hungarian team, driving a 20-year-old Austrian fire truck, persevere with Ukraine but take a route through Moldova, where no one knows anything about Hungarian export plates \u2013 and even if they did, a \u20ac200 backhander eases their passing.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-394509236\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Observer/Columnist/Columnists/2012/8/9/1344511879529/Gorno-Badakhstan-001.jpg\" alt=\"Gorno-Badakhstan\" width=\"460\" height=\"275\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The cars queued for seven hours at the Gorno-Badakhstan internal border in Tajikistan.

Along with Attila and fellow route coordinator Gabor Ondruss, I will be in Pace Car One, a tragically slow Nissan Vanette. We will drive through Romania and Bulgaria, pass through Turkey along the south coast of the Black Sea, head quickly through Georgia and Russia, north around the Caspian Sea, and finally rejoin the planned route in Kazakhstan. I write those sentences as though I'm spreading soft butter on warm toast, but the result of covering such a distance when we've lost a day yet added 900 miles to our route is some of the most sustained, brutal travelling I've ever done.</p> <p>It takes 27 hours to drive to Istanbul along sluggish Romanian roads and through the darkness of rain-lashed Bulgaria. After five hours of fitful sleep in Istanbul, we follow that with a 29-hour drive to Tbilisi, capital of Georgia, where we manage another four hours in bed. It's far from ideal, but to make up the ground, we must become objects of perpetual motion.</p> <p>In the face of such adversity, camaraderie is essential, and luckily I'm well compensated with my travelling partners. Attila has been suffering for his love of travel for years. In the early 1990s, he went to Egypt with just $150 and managed to string it out for five weeks.</p> <p>\"I was haggling for cigarettes, for third-class train fares,\" he says. \"In the end, I lost 10% of my body weight, but I saw everything I wanted to see.\" The 42-year-old pauses for a second. \"I don't think I could do it again.\"</p> <p>Gabor, meanwhile, lived in Africa on and off for almost a decade. A polyglot, he enjoys the endless complications of language, but he also knows what it's like to sit on a bus without air conditioning for 30 hours. Between us we've been to almost 200 countries, but even with all that travelling experience the amended Central Asia Rally route is an exhausting test. At one point, between Tbilisi and Khiva in Uzbekistan, we drive for 60 hours, only stopping for food and water, napping in shifts when the biting, banging potholes allow.</p> <p>It's not all misery: Turkey's coastal route along the Black Sea is spectacular, as is the drive out of Georgia, through the looming beauty of the Caucasus mountains. Chechnya, on the other side of the Russian border, was never part of the original plan but even redeveloped Grozny \u2013 which, with luxury apartments and a gaudy new mosque, now looks like a mini Dubai \u2013 is strangely attractive.</p> <p>There are low points too, and the nadir is our 22 hours in Russia. Every few miles, corrupt cops flag us down, barking \"<em>registratziya</em>\" through the window, before inventing a series of traffic infractions that can all be waved away for a fee, typically around \u00a36. It's depressing to see these men in uniform, Kalashnikovs slung over their shoulders, essentially saying: \"Spare some change.\" And it's especially galling knowing that we have paid \u00a3125 for a visa to be in their bleak country.</p> <p>We're stopped 10 times, and asked for baksheesh on at least half of these. Speaking Russian or English in those circumstances can be as much of a hindrance as a help. In both languages, these joyless shysters are adept at extortion, but if faced with an unknown language, like Hungarian, or rapid lowland Scots (\"Ah'm scunnered wae this pish, ya bawbag\") they sometimes decide we're more hassle than we're worth.</p> <p>Yet making yourself indecipherable is contrary to the spirit of the rest of the rally. While Russian is spoken in most of the countries we visit, the majority of teams don't know any, so everything from car repairs to finding a guesthouse is achieved through games of charades. Handily, a permanent layer of scum on the vehicles provides a dirty slate on which to draw diagrams and write numbers.</p> <p>The rally is a test of the participants' luck, patience and endurance, and for the first week ours are respectively nonexistent, frayed and kaput. Others have similar travails as they swap Europe for Asia, including a couple of minor crashes and several breakdowns. In their own ways, each border crossing is a squalid nightmare \u2013 a man with a gun can be intimidating, but a man with a rubber stamp really has you by the balls. At one point, Gabor hands over a \u20ac2.50 bottle of \"Hungarian champagne\" to a Kazakh guard who is trying to delay us. \"He thinks he's won,\" says my co-driver, \"but he hasn't tasted that stuff yet.\"</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-394509237\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Observer/Columnist/Columnists/2012/8/9/1344512037912/Samarkands-Registan-001.jpg\" alt=\"Samarkand's Registan\" width=\"460\" height=\"275\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Samarkand's Registan square.

Every night, our hotels and guesthouses are full of drivers regaling others with tales of their bizarre days in these little-visited parts of the world. Good or bad, everything becomes a story.</p> <p>Mercifully, things start to slow down a little when we get to strange, sprawling Uzbekistan. Its currency, the som, doesn't carry much value \u2013 1,000 som is the biggest note in circulation, but it's only worth about 35p, so to walk around with a tenner is to feel like a Vegas high-roller. Bribing officials here would look genuinely impressive given the fat wedges of money that would change hands, but to their unending credit, over the four days we're in their country the Uzbeks never ask for a thing. Not even when we deserve a fine.</p> <p>One day I ride in car six, with Miguel Almas and Miguel Esteves from Portugal. In another world they are a vet and a psychiatrist; in this one they're a pair of hard-drinking, hard-driving (though not always at the same time) desperados on a mission to experience everything they possibly can and to have a bloody good laugh while doing so. Their motto \"Why not?\" is perplexingly difficult to contradict, even when I really want to. Our drive in their red, 20-year-old VW Passat estate (185,000 miles on the clock) is supposed to be simple, but a few deliberate wrong turns, and a bit of off-roading later (\"Why not?\") we find ourselves detained by the Uzbek military. After an hour of shared confusion, they send us on our way, but even though we are clearly in the wrong \u2013 we strayed into a military zone \u2013 they never hint at a bribe.</p> <p>The Central Asia Rally is in its infancy, but it approximately follows the ancient silk route, through Uzbekistan's market towns of Khiva, Bukhara and Samarkand, up into the mountains of Tajikistan. We spend a week in this lofty little nation, which also borders Afghanistan. Many of the teams plan to make an excursion there but I opt out. With my British passport, I feel that by essentially holidaying there, I'd be on a Venn diagram comprising the cruise ship passengers who frolicked on Haitian beaches immediately after the 2010 earthquake, and a marine posing over an Afghan corpse. I'd be between those two, on an intersection marked wanker.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-394509238\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Observer/Columnist/Columnists/2012/8/9/1344511961813/Tajikistan-mountains-001.jpg\" alt=\"Tajikistan mountains\" width=\"460\" height=\"275\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The beautiful mountain landscape of Tajikistan. Photograph: Jamie Lafferty</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jamie Lafferty</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Besides, Tajikistan offers plenty in its own right. Snow-capped peaks, glaciers, ravines, gorges, turquoise lakes, geysers, hot springs, waterfalls, snow leopards, bears, the endangered Marco Polo sheep \u2026 Tajikistan has it all, except for other tourists. When we drive over the 3,200m-high summer route from Tavildara to Khorog we don't see another vehicle for two hours. The people are warm and welcoming, and a great many of them have the same intense green eyes as National Geographic poster-girl <a href=\"http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2002/04/afghan-girl/index-text\" title=\"\">Sharbat Gula</a>.</p> <p>Scrabbling around in these mountains presents more challenges for our old bangers: at one point four vehicles have to form a chain with tow ropes to get our increasingly useless Nissan out of a river. Yet, somehow, we all make it through the Pamir mountains, over the 4,272m Koi-Tezek pass, and all the way to Murghob, just 30 miles from the Chinese border. Out here in the Gorno-Badakhshan Autonomous Province (GBAO), the people have been largely abandoned by their government. A separate ethnic group, the Pamiris picked the losing rebel side during Tajikistan's bloody civil war in the 1990s, and the army were not gracious in victory.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-394509239\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Observer/Columnist/Columnists/2012/8/9/1344531133155/Towed-out-001.jpg\" alt=\"Towed out\" width=\"460\" height=\"148\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Vehicles line up to pull the Nissan out of a river in Tajikistan. Photograph: Jamie Lafferty</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jamie Lafferty</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As a result, Murghob has minimal electricity (from solar panels and generators) and gets its water from wells. There is a constant smell of burning. A handful of determined NGOs struggle against the odds to keep the town afloat, and they need all the help they can get. The rally teams do what they can by donating wheelchairs, clothes and stationery, which we have brought over 5,200 miles from Budapest and beyond.</p> <p>Murghob is as far east as we will go \u2013 from here it's three days' drive back to Dushanbe, hugging the Afghan border along a bucking dusty road. After 200 hours of driving, it proves too much for our Nissan, which gives out on a mountain pass at 1am when something vital pops in the engine. After much fretting and failed attempts at towing, we decide to abandon it and give the keys to a local in Dushanbe.</p> <p>Thankfully the Miguels are on hand to give us a lift to the nearest town, from where we take a 10-hour taxi ride to the capital. That the Portuguese are there at all is extremely fortunate. Only two hours previously, in one of the most surreal moments of the rally, a mechanic offered them a bag of rubies for their beaten-up Passat, despite the fact that both its bumpers have been shorn off and the windscreen is cracked. Even if the jewels had really been glass, they would probably have made a profit, but with 400 miles still to go they had to decline.</p> <p>When we finally get to the end, a hairy viaduct of raised eyebrows greets me as I limp into the perfumed lobby of the Hyatt Regency in Dushanbe dusty and deranged, my filthy hair set hard like a rubbish action figure. I try to ignore their dismay, check in and just sleep, sleep, sleep.</p> <p>The rally has been incredibly hard work, almost three weeks of unending challenges and no small amount of anguish in pursuit of adventure. It represents a much more old-fashioned, organic kind of travel: wandering off with only a vague plan and taking your chances with the great unknown.</p> <p>\"Of course it's tough,\" laughed Gabor during one 10-hour stretch along an annihilated Uzbek highway. \"We just didn't say exactly how tough.\"</p> <p><strong>Follow Jamie on Twitter </strong><a href=\"https://twitter.com/MegaHeid\" title=\"\"><strong>@megaheid</strong></a></p>",
  "<p>\"Five Years Ti-i-ime,\" my nine-year-old son is showing Noah and the Whale chords on an air ukulele to sixtysomething Liverpudlian Jack. Both play real ones back home.</p> <p>\"Santia-a-go!\" They change the words to match the moment and Lucas's demonstration appears to be winning Jack round. He is sceptical about our presence here.</p> <p>We're in the garden of an <em>albergue</em> (pilgrims' hostel) in the hamlet of A Rua, on one of the world's most famous pilgrimage routes, the Camino de Santiago de Compostela (the Way of St James). Jack, like most of the 250,000 annual pilgrims, is walking the route.</p> <p>\"Some things are not for children,\" he says, when I explain we are on a new cycle touring package for families: our luggage is transported daily and sturdy all-terrain bikes make the 20km average mileage easy.</p> <p>\"It's not about being easy,\" Jack persists.</p> <p>My latent Catholic sort of agrees. I was brought up thinking pilgrimages were all hair shirts and suffering. I'm long lapsed but still there's a part of me that feels bowling carefree along the camino is somehow cheating.</p> <p>I had also expected that pedalling furiously after a kamikaze kid would not be conducive to quiet contemplation. I was wrong.</p> <p>Yes, sometimes we've been bombing down bumpy mountain tracks with Lucas shouting \"Buen camino!\" at walkers he's almost taken out, but at others we've moved at a more leisurely pace, in companionable silence. Now we are seated round a large table in the Casa do Acivro hostel, communing with an assortment of adults, definitely not Lucas's usual social circle.</p> <p>And he is holding his own. He's moved from car talk with ex-racer Tim from Swindon to describing the Canadian he mistook for Jesus (there are plenty of sandaled, bearded, tunic wearers along the route) and the nun who helped him pull his bicycle from a puddle so deep he should have thought twice before riding through it.</p> <p>Lucas is enjoying the cycling but also the camaraderie and is quick to grasp the concept of pilgrimage. \"It's not just about getting there,\" I say when he asks why people don't just go straight to Santiago cathedral, where the bones of St James the Apostle are interred. \"It's about the journey and what happens along the way.\"</p> <p>\"Like the Wizard of Oz,\" says Lucas</p> <p>If there had been a no-frills flight to the Emerald City, there would have have been no journey of discovery, no friendships forged and no encounters with good and evil.</p> <p>The folk we meet are mainly driven not by religion but by various forms of spiritual and personal motivation. Not everyone knows why they are doing it, or what they will take home, but they are convinced it will be something.</p> <p>Santiago can be reached on foot from France, Portugal or southern Spain but the most popular route is the Camino Franc\u00e9s, which begins in Saint-Jean-Pied-de-Port in the French Pyrenees and runs some 780km before reaching Santiago. Many pilgrims walk the entire way; others choose to complete shorter sections. Our cycle route runs 100km from Sarria, a small city in the Lugo province of north-western Spain. The camino is marked with yellow arrows and the scallop shell of St James, making it virtually impossible to get lost.</p> <p>But pilgrimages shouldn't run too smoothly, and our first obstacle comes when we find that two adult cycles have been delivered to our hostel. This turns out to be a bonus as we end up walking the first part of the way, experiencing it as most pilgrims do. We chat to retired couples, Californian hippies and elderly Spanish women who offer olives and ruffle Lucas's hair \u2013 an occupational hazard for a small blond boy in Mediterranean countries.</p> <p>To my surprise, my son, who doesn't eat vegetables, tries an olive and masks his discomfort long enough to put distance between himself and the giver before spitting it out. Later, with a cheery \"might as well,\" he samples the local speciality, <em>pulpo a la Gallega</em> (octopus with herbs and olive oil) and gives it the thumbs up.</p> <p>Taking delivery of new bikes, we're off next day, pedalling in the slipstream of the macho Lycra brigade.</p> <p>\"What happens if something goes wrong with your bike,\" an elderly Irish man from Cork asks, as we stop for coffee and a slice of Santiago (almond) cake.</p> <p>The bikes come with an impressive looking tool kit.</p> <p>\"Can you use it?\" he raises his eyebrows and I nod towards the ciclistas, dowsing their faces with water from one of the many camino-side fonts.</p> <p>\"So that's your plan B is it?\"</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-394508957\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/pictures/2012/8/8/1344445875558/Lucas-takes-a-breather-on-001.jpg\" alt=\"Lucas takes a breather on the camino\" width=\"460\" height=\"618\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lucas takes a breather on the camino</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Actually, it's my plan A but fortunately the bikes can take the strain of the often-rugged terrain. The route is beautiful but not easy going. We bounce along mountainous dirt tracks, dodge tree roots in eucalyptus forests and sink deep into mud in fields awash after several days' torrential rain. We are soon saddle sore, but no real pilgrimage passes without some pain.</p> <p>As we near Santiago, off-road tracks give way to quiet country lanes. After the village of Lavacolla, where traditionally pilgrims washed themselves in the river, we climb Monte do Gozo (Mount of Joy) and are rewarded with our first, moving, joyful sight of Santiago's cathedral. The sight of the golden granite spires stretching above the Unesco heritage city gives a real sense of what it must have been like for early pilgrims, who had been walking for weeks with this in mind.</p> <p>Up close, it's just as impressive. Lucas is awed by the stonemasonry, the gilded interior and the vast <em>botafumeiro</em>, reputedly the largest incense burner in the world, but underwhelmed by the main attraction. We join a queue to shuffle down steps and peek through a grille at the silver tomb of St James.</p> <p>\"If I'd walked 500 miles to see this, I'd be disappointed,\" says Lucas. (I think he was expecting actual bones or a saintly apparition \u2013 definitely something more than just a regular tomb. ) \"It is like the Wizard of Oz: he wasn't what they expected.\"</p> <p>Exiting via the gift shop into the early evening sunshine, we buy ice-creams in the Praza das Praterias. Here we meet Jack again, in flip-flops. His blistered feet and limping gait testify to the arduous nature of his journey.</p> <p>\"Was the cycling fun?\" he asks.</p> <p>\"Yes,\" Lucas replies. \"But I'd like to walk it, when I'm a bit older. That would be more satisfying, somehow.\"</p> <p>\"Five years' time?\" Jack winks and strums his imaginary ukulele.</p> <p>\"Composte-e-la,\" Lucas strums back, their brief exchange a tacit acknowledgement of their individual achievements.</p> <p><em>\u2022 Camino Ways (020-3468 1516, </em><a href=\"http://www.caminoways.com\" title=\"\"><em>caminoways.com</em></a><em>), which provided the trip, offers a variety of tours on the camino: a seven-night trip from Le\u00f3n to Santiago costs from \u20ac650, including accommodation, luggage transfer and route notes.

Wow!</p> <p>Quarter-pipes, half-pipes and super-pipes have long been an attraction of the French Alps, but the one that the nine-year-old and I have just been through is made of stainless steel, not snow. It's part of the new <a href=\"http://www.avoriaz.com/mountain-holidays/index.php\" title=\"Aquariaz\">Aquariaz</a> mountain waterpark \u2013 the highest in Europe \u2013 brought to the ultra-family-friendly, pedestrianised resort of <a href=\"http://www.avoriaz.com/\" title=\"Avoriaz\">Avoriaz</a> by Center Parcs Europe and its parent company, <a href=\"http://www.pv-holidays.com\" title=\"Pierre  Vacances\">Pierre &amp; Vacances</a>.

In addition to the aqua half-pipe or \"slidewinder\" \u2013 which you can ride solo or<em> \u00e0 deux</em>, in a single or double rubber tube \u2013 and a brilliant waterplay area for younger children including an aquatic see-saw, there's a long and fairly demanding climbing wall alongside one of the pools. The climb ends at a rope that swings you over the water against a backdrop of mountains \u2013 Aquariaz has spectacular views of the Alps through vast floor-to-ceiling windows. Two indoor Jacuzzis set amid tropical foliage are trumped by a third out on the terrace, where you can relax while looking out at dramatic peaks \u2013 whether flooded by sunlight yet streaked with the remains of last winter's snow or, in the ski season, dazzling white.</p> <p>Aquariaz is open year-round, making it a choice apr\u00e8s-ski venue for those who want to warm up and relax tired muscles after a day on the slopes. In summer, Avoriaz makes a good destination for those looking for an interesting alternative to a beach holiday, especially for families.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-394510798\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/pictures/2012/8/8/1344446625697/Rhonda-s-nine-year-old-tr-001.jpg\" alt=\"Rhonda\u2019s nine-year-old tries paragliding\" width=\"460\" height=\"342\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rhonda\u2019s nine-year-old tries paragliding</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For my nine-year-old adrenaline junkie, it provided the setting for a first attempt at paragliding, flying tandem with an instructor. He, his less adventurous brother, aged eight, and I also signed up for a mountain-biking beginners' session, taking us down through forests and wildflower meadows and across streams, accompanied by the tinkle of cowbells over the hillsides.</p> <p>Towards the end of our 90-minute ride, we strapped our bikes to a chairlift that took us back up the mountain to a traditional dairy farm for a <em>go\u00fbter</em>, or cheese-tasting, accompanied by a farm tour (in French) and the chance to watch the herdsman bring in the cows for milking.</p> <p>For my younger son, aged four-and-a-half, there wasn't a huge amount to do in terms of organised excursions, but you can hire smaller bikes to pootle around the resort, where all kinds of facilities and activities are laid on, many (including Aquariaz) free either to all, or to those who buy a \"Multipass Premium\" (\u20ac2 a day to those staying with Pierre &amp; Vacances, and certain other accommodation providers; free to under-fives).</p> <p>The facilities include a \"beach\" with volleyball and sand games, tennis and badminton courts, football and basketball, bouncy castles and trampolines, p\u00e9tanque, mini-golf and a children's adventure trail. Organised activities through the day and into the evening \u2013 again, many for free \u2013 include sports tournaments, a fantastically mad-cap family go-karting grand prix and even \"friendly\" sumo battles.</p> <p>If you don't want to hire bikes, the resort is small enough to stroll around, or there's a free mini-train that does the rounds every few minutes. There are also shuttle buses plying the sinuous mountain road down to the neighbouring resort of Morzine with its year-round ice-rink (included in the multipass).</p> <p>Better still, there are walks galore in the surrounding mountains \u2013 some of them short enough even for those with little legs. Our favourite was the 90-minute jaunt down to Les Brochaux waterfall and then on to the village of Les Lindarets with its free-roaming goats. A chairlift whisks you back up to Avoriaz. All chairlifts in the area \u2013 some of them taking you over the border into the Swiss part of the Portes du Soleil ski and cycling region (remember to take your passport) \u2013 are free to ride with your multipass.</p> <p>There was plenty more we didn't get time for \u2013 whitewater-rafting is on the agenda for a second visit, as is the via ferrata (rock climbing on set routes using fixed cables) and donkey trekking. But if that all sounds a bit full-on or you fancy a spell in the local sauna and hammam, the resort has a nursery, a creche and a full programme of children's club activities every day but Saturday. In this fresh-air playground, it's only natural that most activities take place in the great outdoors. But though the staff do speak some English you can't count on there being many other anglophone children in the clubs \u2013 but then that's because Avoriaz, as a summer resort, is still very much a French secret.</p> <p><em>\u2022 The trip was provided by Pierre &amp; Vacances (</em><a href=\"http://www.pv-holidays.com/gb-en\" title=\"Pierre  Vacances\"><em>pv-holidays.com</em></a><em>), which has flats for four in summer from \u20ac540.

  "<p>Chris Cross looks like a slightly camp extra from Pirates of the Caribbean. He's as tall as a ship's mast, is wearing a leopard skin bandana and his clothes are covered in skulls and crossbones.</p> <p>He's from Newcastle and is a magician and escapologist once described as \"a lanky Geordie velociraptor\". There's an air of unpredictability about him, so I'm surprised when I look down and see what he's wearing on his feet.</p> <p>\"Socks and espadrilles, Chris?\" I ask, pointing.</p> <p>\"They're ever-so toasty,\" he tells me, swishing a foot, coquettishly. \"It's all about the espadrilles. There's a hint of madness, but I'm bookable.\"</p> <p>Chris is part of the Blink Collective, an organisation that works as an online marketplace for amazing experiences and I've joined him in Covent Garden, where he's going to teach me the rudiments of street performing.</p> <p>He's also got a pair of handcuffs. \"I'm going to padlock you in those later,\" he tells me, swishing them in front of me. \"And if you're really lucky, I'll tell you how to get out of them too.\"</p> <p>Chris performed his first magic trick at the age of 10. It was a disappearing coin trick bought for \u00a32.49. \"It was a coin, a piece of elastic, a safety pin and a crocodile clip,\" he tells me. \"It was rubbish but I was a fat kid and whenever I did it, I got respect. It was a confidence booster. I was cool.\"</p> <p>Confidence isn't something Chris currently has a problem with. He's a bag of beans. As we walk together through Covent Garden, he's happily chatting to everyone. \"Don't you hate it,\" he says to two police officers as they pass us, \"when you go out, and you're both wearing the same thing?\"</p> <p>They giggle. One reaches for his handcuffs. I hope he's not going to put them on me. I haven't learned how to get out of them yet.</p> <p>\"I was working clubs and strip joints when I was 13,\" Chris tells me. \"I'd go in, ask to see the manager, say I'm really good. I've seen me before. You should book me. And then I'd do a few tricks. That would hook them in. By the time I was 16 I was making enough to leave school.\"</p> <p>\"I've done magic for Prince Charles, Prince Harry, Dizzee Rascal and the cast of Geordie Shore.\"</p> <p>The trick, I'm learning, to street performing is to make your presence felt. \"It's a hard life,\" says Chris. \"What you get in your hat is all you're taking home that day.

The way I see it, every single one of those people has my money in their pockets. I just have to work out how to get them to give it to me.\"</p> <p>He sits me down and pulls out the handcuffs. \"Now then,\" he says, fixing me with a penetrating stare, \"I'm going to teach you the secrets of magic.

  "<p>Wandering along the narrow, twisting streets of the tiny south Devon village of Shaldon, past the bowling green and rows of thatched cottages and listed Georgian homes, you wouldn't bat an eyelid if a horse-drawn carriage rolled past, or a lady swept by in Georgian dress. It seems to be the seaside village that time forgot, almost.</p> <p>For nearly 200 years, residents have gathered every August on the pocket-sized red sandy beach for the annual regatta, while the distinctive black and white boat, which shuttles people across to the town of Teignmouth on the other side of the estuary, is Britain's oldest passenger ferry, dating from Saxon times. Guarding this community from the sea is the Ness, Shaldon's towering headland and cliff face, through which runs a smugglers' tunnel to a hidden beach.</p> <p>But times are changing, thanks in part to one man who seems to have begun something of a gentle revolution. Tim Bouget, a Michel Roux-trained chef who was born in the region, returned in 2006 from world travels to find a handsome Georgian building for sale in narrow Fore Street. He and wife Clare bought and renovated the building, and opened it as a restaurant, named \"<a href=\"http://odetruefood.com/\" title=\"ODE Shaldon\">ODE</a>\" \u2013 after the building's postcode. This year the cosy rustic restaurant features in the pages of a number of esteemed food publications, including the Michelin Guide, and the Good Food Guide. It even beat Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall's River Cottage to bag the <a href=\"http://www.thesra.org/some-good-thing/sustainable-restaurant-awards/\" title=\"Sustainable Restaurant of the Year 2012 awards\">Sustainable Restaurant of the Year 2012 award</a>, and is now the country's highest-rated sustainable restaurant. Local residents may have been a little suspicious of a chef who has plied his trade at a Michelin-starred restaurant in London's Park Lane opening for business in sleepy Shaldon, but most have come round.</p> <p>Bouget recalls the time he and Clare forgot to lock the door of the restaurant before going out for the day. \"When we came back there was a list of names, times and phone numbers on a piece of paper. People had come in, made their own reservations and left.\"</p> <p>I have eaten there and I am not in the least surprised that even the law-abiding people of Shaldon would risk arrest to secure a table.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-394571316\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Observer/Columnist/Columnists/2012/8/9/1344532641211/New-beach-huts-in-Shaldon-001.jpg\" alt=\"New beach huts in Shaldon\" width=\"460\" height=\"275\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">New beach huts in Shaldon.

Last year the tired beach-front chandlery which had been peddling buckets, spades and crab lines for years was transformed \u2013 not without some local resistance \u2013 into five splendid beach huts that spill on to the sand. (One is currently for sale at \u00a3220,000). Next door is <a href=\"http://www.theclippershaldon.co.uk/\" title=\"The Clipper\">The Clipper</a>, a former beach-front cafe that was refurbished, extended and reopened in April 2012 as a stylish cafe run by two Italian chefs, who grow many of their own vegetables on a farm a mile away, while bread comes from the Shaldon Bakery, a craft bakery just down the road, which opened in 2009.</p> <p>Further along The Strand, where a narrow road separates the beach from the handful of pubs and guesthouses, is <a href=\"http://www.numberonethestrand.co.uk/\" title=\"Number One\">Number One</a>. When I visited last year this was the charming but jaded Beachcomber Caf\u00e9, as it had been for 20 years. Now it is a contemporary space with a centrepiece bar lined with Champagne bottles, a tapas menu and an emphasis on local suppliers, not least locally caught fish.</p> <p>This summer has also seen a number of new shops opening. In June, Chicy Rachael's homeware and gift shop appeared, selling beautiful wooden bowls turned by Rachael's father, a joiner in Teignmouth, across the estuary. Two weeks ago The Yummy Shop was born \u2013 a deli with wares including gluten-free Devon farm ice cream and organic farm eggs.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-394571317\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Observer/Columnist/Columnists/2012/8/9/1344532741841/Organic-treats-at-cafe-OD-001.jpg\" alt=\"Organic treats at cafe ODE\" width=\"460\" height=\"275\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Organic treats at cafe ODE</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Walk up the hill towards the Ness \u2013 past the Ness House Hotel, a striking Georgian building that is now a restaurant and bar with rooms \u2013 and you will find Bouget's latest venture, \"cafe ODE\", which opened in May in a converted stable on the hillside overlooking the river Teign. Motivated by the birth of the couple's daughter, Thula, the cafe serves affordable family food with a sustainable heart, from organic farm ice cream to a good portion of locally sourced fish and chips for \u00a38.50. True to Bouget's passion, the building is constructed from locally quarried stone and powered by renewable energy sources, while the benches are made from reclaimed materials and the menu boards were salvaged from a skip. Bouget even regularly ventures through the nearby smugglers' tunnel to forage for sea lettuce and rock samphire at the \"secret\" beach.</p> <p>Shaldon's salty sea air remains rich with history, but it is edging into the present in a fittingly charming way.</p> <p><em>\u2022 </em>For more information go to <a href=\"http://shaldon-village.co.uk/\" title=\"Shaldon village\">shaldon-village.co.uk</a></p>",

  "<p>The finish line is in sight. After two weeks of exertion, of triumph and dejection, of glittering victory and head-down defeat that have been the focus not just of British attention but of the gaze of the entire world, the London Olympics of 2012 will soon be over \u2013 and the reflection will begin.</p> <p>In truth, the reflection has been under way from the very start, from an opening ceremony that did not serve up mere spectacle but asked its audience, particularly its British audience, to think. Danny Boyle's spectacular, so beautifully executed and ingeniously conceived it lingers in the mind even as the closing draws near, stood apart from its predecessors thanks not only to its humour and eccentricity, but also because it had something to say.</p> <p>It presented 1948 as the pivot year in the history of modern Britain. That was the last time London played Olympic host, but also the year that saw the founding of the National Health Service and the arrival of the Windrush, the ship bearing the Caribbean migrants who would change the face of Britain.</p> <p>Both those themes \u2013 an ethos of public service and ethnic diversity \u2013 would be amplified in the ceremony and, more importantly, in the Games themselves. But that reminder of late 1940s Britain suggests another thought, too.</p> <p>For those immediate years of post-war austerity and exhaustion, still on rations as we watched our global empire unravel, birthed a national narrative that endured, with the odd interruption, for more than six decades. It is the story of decline, of Britain as a has-been nation, once glorious, now reduced to a tired marginality, bobbing around in the Atlantic stuck between Europe and a superpower United States. Somehow the story seeped into our bones, expressed in our best-loved sitcoms \u2013 with their tales of frustrated men, from Captain Mainwaring to David Brent, made ridiculous by delusions of grandeur \u2013 and by a brand of newspaper whose unspoken daily message is that the country is going to the dogs.</p> <p>Then along came London 2012 to change the script. Despite all the familiar fears of failure \u2013 of traffic snarl-ups, botched security arrangements and dreadful weather \u2013 we have surprised ourselves by staging a global event of infinite complexity with near-perfect success. The new venues, including an architecturally gorgeous velodrome and stadium, were built ahead of time and have worked flawlessly. The locations that were not new but old places put to new use \u2013 whether beach volleyball in Horse Guards or showjumping in Greenwich \u2013 showed the capital in a fresh and telegenic light, the London of a Richard Curtis movie. Not only have the athletes and bigwigs travelled to and fro without a hitch, so has everyone else. Spectators \u2013 once, admittedly, they had negotiated an online ticketing system apparently designed to induce collective rage \u2013 have filled late-night trains, sleepy with awe and delight at what they have seen. London did not fail or struggle. Instead the sun shone and the city hosted an Olympic Games of wonder.</p> <p>But if the backroom organisers showed that Britain could still excel, the country's athletes delivered an excess of proof. Team GB did better than at any Games since the first hosted by London in 1908 \u2013 back when the judges and umpires were all Brits and plenty of the sports were only played by us anyway. To rank third in the medals table this time, beaten only by superpowers US and China, is an achievement that simply does not square with the loser-ish self-image we have spent decades cultivating.</p> <p>The effect, of both these organisational and sporting triumphs, was a national good mood so unaccustomed in many it prompted suspicion and unease. Some wondered if all this patriotism was healthy for our collective soul. But most grew hoarse, cheering at the TV for the man or woman in the now-familiar all-blue union colours to row or pedal or run just a bit faster.</p> <p>And so perhaps historians might record this strange, heady fortnight as the moment when we finally laid to rest a national myth that had dogged us so long, concluding a narrative that began with one London Olympiad and ended in another: the age of decline, 1948-2012.</p> <p>Here too the opening ceremony set the tone, suggesting that we should love the country we have become \u2013 informal, mixed, quirky \u2013 rather than the one we used to be. That both it and the Games have enjoyed such a consensus of support is a surprise, because all of this is much more contentious than it appears. To see that, look no further than the clear losers of London 2012.</p> <p>Atop that uncelebrated podium stands reactionary Britain. Its face belongs to Aidan Burley, the Conservative MP who tweeted his fury at the \"multicultural crap\" he saw in Boyle's extravaganza, but behind him are all those who nodded at the Daily Mail's denunciation of the \"plastic Brits\" swelling Team GB's ranks. The Burleyites took a thorough beating at these Games, watching as not just Guardian-types but the nation exalted in the success of a team as diverse as any British city. On that golden Saturday night, when Greg Rutherford, Jessica Ennis and Mo Farah won and won and won, Twitter was cracking a joke that turned on how much we had changed: \"A ginger, a mixed-race woman and a one-time Somali refugee walk into a pub \u2013 and everyone buys them a drink.\"</p> <p>There will be others who need to alter their message after these Games. BBC bashers, emboldened after the jubilee pageant debacle, will surely hold their tongues for a while, after the corporation served up the kind of consistency, quality and quantity that perhaps only a publicly funded broadcaster is capable of. Andrew Lansley has had his warning, via Boyle, about the NHS: it is treasured not just as a valued service but as a core part of Britain's national identity. And Alex Salmond cannot easily claim the union has lost its emotional pull, not after he's seen the ease with which so many Britons, including Scots, draped themselves in its once terminally unfashionable colours.</p> <p>Of course it cannot last, not at this pitch at any rate. Already, like the holidaymakers who know they are due to fly home in a couple of days, the sense, even the dread, of a return to normality is looming. False dawns are frequent, in sport especially. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/aug/06/london-2012-british-racial-attitudes\" title=\"\">Witness the victorious French football team of 1998 that was meant to hail a new, racially inclusive future for that country</a>: it didn't quite work out that way. As today's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/aug/10/london-2012-team-gb-success-feelgood-factor\" title=\"\">Guardian/ICM poll</a> shows, most Britons are not going to let the Olympics shift their views on immigration: those Somali-born asylum seekers unblessed by Mo Farah's gifts will not be applauded as they walk into the pub. Our problems haven't gone away just because the news bulletins have barely mentioned them for two weeks. While we were studying the medals table, new figures showed the economy flatlining. We still live in the age of austerity, facing unpalatable cuts, governed by institutions many of which we no longer trust. Even the immediate weather forecast is unsettled.</p> <p>But that does not mean we have to cast aside what we just lived through. For we got a glimpse of another kind of Britain. A place which succeeds brilliantly, not least by drawing equally on all its talents, black and white, male and female. A place where money and profit are not the only values, <a href=\"http://www.alastaircampbell.org/blog/2012/08/09/the-volunteers-are-70000-reasons-why-these-games-are-great-and-they-are-changing-britain-for-the-better/\" title=\"\">exemplified by the 70,000 volunteers who made the Games work</a> and showed the world a smiling face while they were at it. A place that reveres not achievement-free celebrity, but astonishing skill, granite determination and good grace, the land not of <a href=\"http://www.itv.com/essex/\" title=\"\">TOWIE</a> but of Bradley Wiggins, Nicola Adams and Laura Trott. A place where patriotism is heartfelt, but of the soft and civic rather than naked and aggressive variety; a place that welcomes visitors from abroad and cheers louder for the Turkish woman who came last in a 3,000m steeplechase heat than it did for the winner.</p> <p>This is the Britain we let ourselves see these past two weeks. It will slip from view as time passes, but we are not condemned to forget it. We don't have to be like the <a href=\"http://www.literarytraveler.com/articles/blaustein_israel/\" title=\"\">long-ago poet who once wrote</a>: \"Did you exist? Or did I dream a dream?\"</p> <p><em>Twitter: </em><a href=\"http://twitter.com/j_freedland\" title=\"\"><em>@j_freedland</em></a></p>",
  "<h2>Women's basketball 9pm</h2> <p>France will take on the USA in today's final after beating the European champions, Russia, 81-64 in the semis but their coach sounded less than hopeful ahead of the game. \"The United States built the game,\" said Pierre Vincent. \"They cannot be beaten, they're invincible.\" He may have a point. France are in their first final of an Olympics and ranked eighth in the world while the USA team are undefeated in 40 Olympic Games in a streak spanning 20 years. The French back-up point guard Edwige Lawson-Wade sounded a little bit more optimistic. \"To beat the USA you have to do the perfect game. Perfect in defence, perfect in offence. It's something that happens once every few years but it happens.\"</p> <h2>Canoe Sprint 9.30am</h2> <p>Four finals take place today: the men's canoe single (C1) 200m, men's kayak single (K1) 200m, women's kayak single (K1) 200m and men's kayak double (K2) 200m. Great Britain have athletes competing in the latter three events with Ed McKeever \u2013 who has been labelled the Usain Bolt of the canoe world \u2013 the one to watch. McKeever is competing in the K1 200m final and is a strong medal contender. Liam Heath and Jon Schofield reached the final of the K2 with a time of 32.940sec while Jess Walker will compete for a medal in the women's K1.</p> <h2>Diving 10am</h2> <p>The semi-final and final for the 10m platform take place today. Although partners for the synchronised dive, Tom Daley and Peter Waterfield would have competed against each other for an Olympic medal if Waterfield had not failed to qualify on Friday. Daley, too, was unconvincing. One of his biggest competitors will be the reigning champion, Australia's Matthew Mitcham, who said recently: \"I've been smashing myself for quite some time now, in a good way. Training very hard and putting my abs through very rigorous training and the rest of my body as well.\" Sounds&#xa0;ominous.</p> <h2>Football 3pm</h2> <p>Following an exhilarating two weeks the men's football tournament draws to a conclusion in this afternoon's gold medal match. Brazil take on Mexico after easing past South Korea 3-0 in their semi-final, looking for their first Olympic gold. Mexico, like Brazil, are yet to lose a match in London 2012 but the Brazilian legend Pel\u00e9, who met the Team GB gold medallist rower Katherine Grainger this week, will be at Wembley to support his compatriots. \"I hope we get the gold medal that I never got.\"</p> <h2>Cycling (Mountain bike) 12.30pm</h2> <p>The women's cross-country final gets under way, the first day of the two-day competition. Taking place at Hadleigh Farm in Essex, the race will see 30 cyclists compete for a chance to win a medal. Team GB will be represented by Annie Last, who won silver in the Under-23 class at the 2010 world championships and was British senior champion in 2011 .</p> <h2>Hockey 3.30pm</h2> <p>Team GB were destroyed 9-2 by the Dutch in the semi-finals but will have to pick themselves up for tonight's third-place play-off against Australia. And that is just what they are going to do, according to the captain, Barry Middleton. \"That wasn't really us and it's hard to explain why it happened.\" Germany take on the Netherlands in the final at 8pm.</p>",
  "<p>The warm glow of Team GB's best performance in 104 years and pride in an Olympic Games well received at home and abroad have led a clear majority of the British public to conclude the \u00a39bn they cost is good value for money.</p> <p>A new Guardian/ICM poll has revealed that 55% of Britons say the Games are \"well worth\" the investment because they are doing a valuable job in cheering the country during hard times, outnumbering the 35% who regard them as a costly distraction from serious economic problems.</p> <p>The commanding 20 percentage point lead comes despite the fact that respondents were expressly reminded of the cost in the survey, and may indicate faith in a beneficial legacy from the Games.</p> <p>The findings appear to support the thesis of Lord Coe, chairman of the London 2012 organising committee (Locog), that enthusiasm for the Games would be a \"slow burn\" but would eventually ignite among the British public. Coe will also be cheered that support for the Games, which have the motto \"inspire a generation\", is strongest among the young and remains high outside the capital.</p> <p>The performances of Team GB athletes, who have surpassed their Beijing total and are now guaranteed to finish third in the medal table, also appear to have helped shift public opinion, which was previously sceptical about the value of the Games.</p> <p>Coe said there was a \"limited window of opportunity\" to capitalise on the feelgood factor around the Games and create a lasting sporting and economic legacy.</p> <p>The debate continued to rage on Friday, with David Cameron defending the decision to abandon pledges around the amount of time spent on sport in school, and Labour's Ed Miliband calling for a 10-year cross-party plan to maximise the Olympic effect.</p> <p>A total of \u00a39.3bn in public, lottery and council tax funding was spent on venues and security, although ministers have said there should be about \u00a3300m in contingency money left over. Locog's \u00a32bn operational budget is privately raised from sponsorship and ticket sales.</p> <p>But hopes that the Games might foster a new spirit of tolerance towards migrants and minorities have met with more mixed results.</p> <p>Coe has emphasised London's \"home from home\" welcome ever since London won the bid to host the Games in 2005, stressing the capital's tolerant, diverse nature. The public emphatically sides with Danny Boyle \u2013 whose opening ceremony celebrated symbols of diversity and declared \"This is For Everyone!\" \u2013 over the Conservative MP Aidan Burley, who infamously tweeted that his efforts were <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/jul/28/olympics-opening-ceremony-multicultural-crap-tory-mp\" title=\"\">\"multicultural crap\"</a>.</p> <p>By a two-to-one margin of 68% to 32%, respondents agree that modern Britain is stronger as a country of many cultures, support for multiculturalism that rises to 79% in London and 81% among the very youngest respondents, aged 18-24.</p> <p>On the other hand, after being reminded of the success of minority ethnic Britons such as the Somali-born 10,000m champion, Mo Farah, voters remain inclined to doubt that most newcomers do anything positive for Britain.</p> <p>By a narrow 53%-47% margin, the survey finds agreement for the suggestion that \"More often than not immigrants \u2026 do not bring anything positive, and the likes of the Olympic-winning athletes are an exception\".</p> <p>Faith in the contribution of immigrants is much stronger in London, where 62% disagree with this statement, and a majority of respondents aged under 45 likewise disagree, but among pensioners there are particularly marked doubts about newcomers \u2013 with 64% of the over-65s describing the Olympians as \"exceptions\".</p> <p>Attitudes harden further when the question switches to immigration in general. Only 32% of respondents say the Olympic successes make them \"more positive (or less worried)\" about it, against just 68% who disagree.</p> <p>This time the refusal to allow the Olympics to alter attitudes is marked in every part of the country, including London, as well as across all age groups and regions.</p> <p>Professor Anthony Heath of Oxford University, who has just completed a major study on multicultural Britain for the Economics and Social Research Council, said he was not surprised by the divergent results from the different polling questions. He explained: \"We see an impressive level of support for multicultural Britain, despite continuing concern about immigration.</p> <p>\"That suggests the British public is rather more sophisticated than politicians recognise. Anxiety about the unplanned wave of immigration following EU enlargement is perfectly consistent with pride in the achievements of our long-established Black British and Asian communities\".</p> <p>Overall support for the Olympics is striking evenly split across the sexes, with 54% of men and 56% of women regarding the Games as \"well worth\" the cost.</p> <p>Across the age range, the young are most enthusiastic, with support at 60% or more among the under-35s. The professional AB social class is keenest, with 63% saying the Games are well worth it, but among all occupational grades the enthusiasts outnumber the sceptics.</p> <p>That is also true across every part of the country, except for Scotland, where opinion is evenly split 42%-42%.</p> <p>London 2012 organisers will be particularly gratified that the triumphs of Team GB have translated into acclaim for the Games beyond the capital. They believe that the success of the torch relay, which was seen by an estimated 15m people on its 70-day tour of the UK, helped catalyse support beyond London. The enthusiasm of Londoners, 57% who see the Olympics as valuable, is in fact outdone by support of 58% in the south-west, 61% in the rest of the south-east and 68% in Wales.</p> <p>Other surveys have also suggested that the Games have acquired a feelgood factor since they got under way. <a href=\"http://ukpollingreport.co.uk/blog/archives/5977\" title=\"\">YouGov recently found that hosting the Olympics was the right thing to do by 57% to 29%</a>, as compared to a 53%-35% split before the Games started. The 60% YouGov recorded as expecting a successful games before they started rose to 71% once they began.</p> <p><em>ICM Research interviewed 2,021 adults aged 18+ online on 8-9 August 2012.

  "<p>\u2022 An article about the Ethiopian prime minister, Meles Zenawi, who has not been seen in public since June, said his Tigray People's Liberation Front had waged a successful 30-year war that toppled the dictatorship of Mengistu Haile Mariam in 1991. The TPLF was not formed until 1975, although the Eritrean independence war can be dated from 1961. The article also said the opposition won 23&#xa0;seats in disputed parliamentary elections in 2005. It won 23 in Addis Ababa, and more than 170 overall (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/08/meles-zenawi-profile-ethiopia-prime-minister\" title=\"\">Pragmatic autocrat who has close ties with the US</a>, 9 August, page 22).</p> <p>\u2022 Some calculations were a decimal place out in an article that said the&#xa0;sprinter Usain Bolt won the Olympic 100m in a time that was 0.6&#xa0;seconds faster than his performance four years&#xa0;ago in Beijing, but half&#xa0;a second slower than the world record he set in 2009. In fact his time of 9.63 seconds was 0.06 seconds faster than his Beijing time and 0.05 seconds slower than his world record (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/aug/09/usain-bolt-fifth-gold\" title=\"\">Bolt seals place in pantheon with another stunning double</a>, 10 August, page 2).</p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/08/ethiopia-meles-zenawai-not-seen\" title=\"\">Ethiopian prime Meles Zenawi not seen for seven weeks</a> was amended because the original said Meles had not been seen in public since a G8 summit in Mexico in June.

  "<p>Roy Hodgson has indicated he wants to keep John Terry in his plans for the England team even if the Football Association rules that the Chelsea captain did racially abuse Anton Ferdinand.</p> <p>Terry will not be involved in Wednesday's friendly against Italy after Hodgson named an experimental squad notable for the return of Michael Carrick and call-ups for Jack Rodwell, Steven Caulker, Jake Livermore and Ryan Bertrand.</p> <p>Hodgson was always planning to experiment and the England manager said it would need \"an enormous ban\" for Terry not to remain a part of future squads at the end of the FA's disciplinary hearing.</p> <p>Hodgson said the same applied to Rio Ferdinand, Anton's elder brother, who has been charged with misconduct by the FA for responding to a tweet about \"choc-ice\" in a conversation about Ashley Cole's evidence during Terry's recent trial at Westminster magistrates' court. Ferdinand said his comment was misconstrued.</p> <p>However, Ferdinand's exclusion from the latest squad all but confirms what is widely known already, namely that his international career is over while Hodgson is in charge. Terry faces a more serious offence, which he denies, arising from Chelsea's trip to QPR last October, but Hodgson does not believe a guilty verdict should rule the player out of being picked to represent his country in the future.</p> <p>\"John Terry has been through a charge in a court; now he has to go through the process the FA has embarked upon,\" Hodgson said. \"The same applies to Rio. As far as I am concerned, it is a disciplinary matter, which the FA will take care of.</p> <p>\"As long as they don't suffer enormous bans that will keep them out of my thinking there is no reason for me to believe I can't consider them in the future. And obviously I will.\"</p> <p>As well as Terry, Hodgson has also left out his other first-choice defenders from Euro 2012 \u2013 Cole, Joleon Lescott and Glen Johnson \u2013 and several other senior players, including Steven Gerrard and Wayne Rooney. Frank Lampard returns in midfield and Hodgson blamed a misunderstanding for Carrick's non-involvement in Euro 2012.</p> <p>\"Michael Carrick would have always been in our thinking. I was given to believe he didn't want to be part of the England setup. He didn't want to be considered for the Euros so I reluctantly thought if people are not available they are not available.\"</p> <p>Carrick had, indeed, withdrawn from contention while Fabio Capello was still in charge at the beginning of the year, on the basis he was fed up of being a fringe player. Stuart Pearce, the caretaker manager, asked him to return for the February friendly against Holland but could not talk him round. David Geiss, Carrick's agent, then informed the FA this was still the case shortly before Hodgson named his Euro 2012 squad.</p> <p>\"He [Carrick] has had discussions with Gary [Neville] and me since and it turns out that he does want to play,\" Hodgson said. \"This is an ideal opportunity to invite him to play for England again. There has never been any doubt that Carrick has not been in our thoughts or our wishes. It was more a case of believing he wasn't available for England and that it was a final decision.\"</p> <p>Hodgson's squad includes five of the players who were involved in the Olympics with Great Britain. \"I think it's very important to get a look at some of the younger players. But it's also important to make sure that the players who should have been with us at the Euros \u2013 John Ruddy, Frank Lampard, Gary Cahill \u2013 had a chance to come with us.</p> <p>\"There's a good balance in the squad. There are plenty of senior players to start the game for us but it will also be nice to see some of the younger ones. I've left [out] a lot of the players who did extremely well at the Euros \u2013 the senior players whose position is in no doubt \u2013 to give others a chance.\"</p> <h2><strong>England squad to play Italy in Berne on 15 August</strong></h2> <p>Joe Hart (Man City), Jack Butland (Birmingham), John Ruddy (Norwich); Kyle Walker (Spurs), Gary Cahill (Chelsea), Steven Caulker (Spurs), Phil Jagielka , Leighton Baines (both Everton), Ryan Bertrand (Chelsea); Jack Rodwell (Everton), Michael Carrick (Man Utd), Frank Lampard (Chelsea), Jake Livermore (Spurs), Tom Cleverley (Man Utd), James Milner, Adam Johnson (both Man City), Ashley Young (Man Utd), Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain (Arsenal), Theo Walcott (Arsenal); Daniel Sturridge (Chelsea), Andy Carroll (Liverpool), Jermain Defoe (Spurs).</p>",

  "<p>Like the other military policemen in the minibus, Mohammad Asaad was wearing civilian clothes as he set off for work in the north of the province of Damascus. \"No one would take the risk of wearing uniform,\" he told me as he lay in his bloodstained T-shirt in Tishreen military hospital, Syria's main centre for wounded security force personnel and their families.</p> <p>At An Nabk, a small town about 35 miles from the capital, the crowded minibus came across an unexpected obstacle on Thursday morning. \"We were surprised to see insurgents blocking the road. Without warning they started shooting,\" he recalled as doctors dressed his injured arm.</p> <p>\"They used every kind of weapon. Our minibus tipped over, and several people died,\" he said. \"The passengers included civilians and one of the dead was a mother. The insurgents ran off and we managed to call for help to bring us here.\"</p> <p>In a nearby ward another policeman who survived the incident was about to be X-rayed. Doctors said the attack had produced six \"martyrs\", the standard term used by all sides in Syria's civil war for military and civilian dead. Five others needed surgery.</p> <p>The lethal encounter was typical of a conflict in which a growing number of government troops and police are dying. Hundreds of police and soldiers are losing their lives in ambushes and other attacks along Syria's roads as they try to contain the opposition and bring reinforcements to areas of fighting.</p> <p>In another ward at the military hospital two young conscripts, barely out of their teens, were being treated. One was in too much pain to talk. The other described how the roadside military post they were guarding came under attack, also on Thursday morning, in Al Tall, a district on Damascus's northern outskirts. They were struck by bullets but managed to escape and hide.</p> <p>Within the last few weeks the rebel attacks have come closer to Damascus. Fighting erupted in several outlying districts of the capital in the last two weeks of July. Although the rebels withdrew from some of them after heavy government retaliation, the regular sound of artillery and helicopters is causing widespread concern.</p> <p>Many better-off residents are sending spouses and children to Beirut or Amman. \"My daughter and her family moved the children's beds into the corridor. They look out over eastern Damascus towards Qaboon, and the noise was too intense and frightening. They have now moved to Lebanon,\" one resident, a strong critic of the government, told me.</p> <p>Several government officials also keep their spouses and children out of the country, and are not penalised for it. An estimated 15,000 poorer people have fled from districts where clashes have occurred and are sheltering in schools. The International Committee of the Red Cross and the Syrian Arab Red Crescent have been providing emergency food, water, and healthcare for thousands of displaced people around the city and in Damascus province. The UN refugee agency is providing blankets. Next week it plans to start providing hot meals for at least 6,000 families who cannot cook their own iftar, the meal that ends the daytime fast during the month of Ramadan.</p> <p>The army has stepped up the random searches at checkpoints on the main roads in and out of the city, creating major traffic jams during rush hour. Minibuses \u2013 the favourite form of public transport for the city \u2013 are often stopped and passengers, in particular young men, are asked to show their IDs. One young man sitting next to me was ordered off the bus when the soldier queried whether he was really a resident of the city.</p> <p>Compared with the scene in February when I last visited Damascus, the mood is clearly tenser. At that time it was sometimes hard to believe that war was raging elsewhere in Syria. The capital itself, with its tree-lined streets in the city centre, looked completely normal, with children playing in parks and women walking unescorted even after dark. The streets are emptier now and fewer shops stay open in the late evening, even though after a day of blistering 100-degree temperatures, it is the best time to be outside. \"Normally in Ramadan after iftar, the streets are full of people enjoying the cool air. Look at it now. This is the reaction to what's going on,\" said a government official.</p> <p>Staff at Tishreen hospital confirm there has been a surge in violence, though they blame the rebels. \"The number of injured we treat has increased over the last six months, and particularly over the last month, because of the escalation of support for the terrorists. The average intake of wounded now ranges between 20 and 50 a day. They mainly come from districts of Damascus province, though because we are the best military hospital in the country, we get some from further away if they have complicated wounds,\" said the hospital's director, who holds the military rank of general. His office walls have three pictures of President Bashar al-Assad, one alongside his baby son, and two of the Syrian leader's father, Hafez al-Assad. A wiry figure with short gray hair, the general wore full army uniform, complete with black boots, though \u2013 like the wounded policemen \u2013 he said he and his colleagues had stopped wearing uniform on their way to and from work. For what he also called safety reasons he declined to give his name. Four of the hospital's nurses and two doctors had been killed on their way to work in the last six weeks, he said.</p> <p>\"We have about 20 martyrs daily, only one or two of whom are civilians,\" he added. A few die in hospital but most of the dead are soldiers whose bodies are brought to the morgue for relatives to collect for burial. A five-minute service is held in a concrete yard at the back of the building in front of a triptych of paintings on large boards, one showing the eternal flame at the tomb of the unknown soldier, the centre-piece a montage of wings, anchor and crossed swords, marking the three armed services, and on the right-hand panel the national flag. As we watched, a coffin of cheap-looking, almost paper-like, wood, draped in the flag, and with the name of a dead soldier at the front, was loaded into the back of a minivan, and two relatives got in beside the driver and drove off to a cemetery.</p> <p>The general complained that foreign governments were aiding what he called the terrorists. \"It has escalated here because of money being pumped in from Qatar and Saudi Arabia and support from the United States and Britain. The US and Britain claim to be fighting terrorism but why do they support Islamic extremists and terrorists on our soil?</p> <p>\"When insurgents attacked soldiers in Sinai, Israel and Egypt were allowed to slap them down, so why don't they allow our army to hit the terrorists here? The US supported the mujahideen in Afghanistan because they were fighting the Soviet Union, but then the US had to kill some of the same jihadis,\" he said.</p> <p>In a bed in a private room upstairs Haytham Shaaban, a wounded colonel, lay with both legs bandaged below the knee and his right leg in a metal clamp. He is an Alawite from a small town near Tartus in Syria's coastal north-west, the heartland of the Alawite offshoot of Shia Islam, from which the ruling Assad family comes. His wife who sat near him is Sunni, while another middle-aged couple visiting them were also Alawite and Sunni.</p> <p>Colonel Shaaban claimed that Syria's rebels were trying to divide people on the basis of their sect when intercommunal relations in Syria's multicultural society had always been good, as his own family and friends could testify. Like other government loyalists, he insisted Syria's protesters were manipulated by an outside conspiracy.</p> <p>\"The demonstrators were told to raise the issue of sectarianism,\" he said. \"That was the demand of the countries which organised this.\" He acknowledged Syrians were angry with corruption but argued: \"If this was a revolution against corruption, we would have joined it ourselves and the president would have been the first to join it.\"</p> <p>This week's defection by Prime Minister Riyad Hijab, a staunch official with a long history of loyalty to the Ba'ath party, raised rebel hopes of further cracks in the government hierarchy. It led Jay Carney, the White House spokesman, to claim it as \"a sign that Assad's grip on power is loosening\". Colonel Shaaban denied this.</p> <p>\"We will terminate the criminal groups supported by Arab and foreign countries and make Syria secure again. They'll never undermine our morale,\" he declared. He followed the official spin, put out on state TV, of remaining cool and not denouncing the former prime minister as a traitor or a rat. As the colonel put it, \"the government is not linked to one person. It's a personal decision.\"</p> <p>Earlier, a senior government official, who did not wish to be named, told me: \"This country is not normal at the moment. Fear can surprise one. There are three ways of reacting. You can become more stubborn in your views. You can resign and keep quiet. Or you can defect.\"</p>",
  "<p>Standing at a crossroads, just on the edge of Aleppo on Tuesday, Abdul Rahman, his wife, mother, and three young children were carrying their possessions in plastic bags. They had covered the furniture inside their home in the nearby suburb of Sahor, locked the front door and started walking north.</p> <p>The family had no car and were hoping to find a minibus to take them to safety in Turkey. But neither the buses, nor much else, are working in Syria's second city anymore. And neither Abdul Rahman, a car mechanic, nor most of the residents that remain, have fuel, or the means to pay the exorbitant rates now being charged for the precious few litres available on the black market.</p> <p>As the roar of a warplane pierced the blue sky above, the family seemed to be resigned to their fate. \"I hope one of the farmers, or anyone else who still has fuel, will let us get on his truck,\" said Abdul Rahman as two of his children wept by the roadside. \"But look around, there is nothing moving.\"</p> <p>Towards the north, the drab grey fringes of the city gave way to pastures turned copper-toned by the sun and fruit orchards that seem to be begging for rain. To the west, down the road towards a main underpass into the central city, a heat haze shimmered above the baking black tarmac. The only vehicle visible was an upturned bus that had been looted and scorched when the siege of the city started around two weeks ago.</p> <p>Shops remain shuttered in most of eastern Aleppo. Rubbish continues to pile up by the day. A pervasive stench now hangs over the east of the city, a fetid mix of refuse, death and sewerage \u2013 it is difficult to distinguish between them anymore.</p> <p>The rumble of bombs and the scream of jets make another assault on the senses. On Tuesday morning, near a rebel position in the east of the capital, one of the jets approached fast and low. Its camouflage markings could easily be made out as it raced towards the rebel-held school house in its sight. So could the bombs attached to its underbelly.</p> <p>The jet roared across the top of the rebel base \u2013 a schoolyard, in which portraits of former dictator Hafez al-Assad lay smashed inside on the floor. It dropped its bomb \u2013 and missed, instead hitting a small adjoining home, killing a family of 10 and leaving a neighbourhood in despair.</p> <p>Those hours of anguish following the air strike offered one of the few glimpses into the mood of Aleppo at war. In the east of the city, once thriving market places come alive only in the hours before dusk. Workshops that line main roads are closed and footpaths eerily empty.</p> <p>The ancient citadel that towers above Aleppo's cultural and historic heart stands in defiance to the trouble all around. The medieval castle has seen revolution and war before, its stone walls seeing off the Byzantines, Greeks and Romans.</p> <p>But this popular uprising gives the feeling of breaking new ground. The uncompromising order of the four-decade Assad-family rule is now in play, and so too is the regional dynamic that has underpinned the regime since the fall of the Ottoman empire.</p> <p>Were Aleppo to fall it would almost certainly be followed by Damascus, amplifying the 1,500 schism between Shia Islam, whose leaders are backing the regime and the region's Sunnis, whom mostly oppose it. The instability now crippling Syria's two main cities could easily destabilise the neighbouring nation states that emerged from the ruins of empire and war 90 years ago.</p> <p>For now though, the battle in Aleppo is being fought in two halves. To the west of the citadel, past the old marketplace and the cobbled alleys around it, regime forces remain in effective control.</p> <p>\"They're beyond the wall of the castle,\" a young rebel from the Aleppo countryside said as he looked through the scope of his assault rifle. \"Go anywhere near them and a sniper will kill you.\"</p> <p>A maze of overpasses mark the battle lines for now. The road that snakes west along one overpass from the central suburb of Sarhor is barren and menacing. Across the crest of the hill is a regime checkpoint, the first of many in the west of the city, where life is reputedly easier than in the rebel-held east.</p> <p>It is difficult to gauge though; any reporter found by an official without a regime-issued visa for entering Syria would quickly experience life on the inside of the feared police state, the pillars of which are in an administrative district only two miles away.</p> <p>There, in the hub of state power, regime flags still fly above government buildings as they do from army positions and state institutions.</p> <p>The jets that haunt the skies in the other half of town are not heard here. Restaurants still serve the Aleppo establishment and commercial class, which has shown few signs of wavering in its support for the regime. And state media assures people that it will all be over soon.</p> <p>But the uprising has undeniably reached even the regime's staunchest supporters and penetrated its inner sanctums. \"They are scared over there,\" said a defector who escaped from the city's dreaded intelligence district on Thursday, motioning across the overpass. \"It is not a normal situation and people don't know who is going to win.</p> <p>\"The atmosphere is not normal. It has never been like this before.\"</p> <p>On Wednesday, rebel leaders in northern Aleppo insisted that they would soon be launching attacks against state buildings, particularly intelligence services. The attacks, they said, would serve two purposes; to remind the security network that it is no longer omnipotent \u2013 and to free many of the thousands of prisoners jailed in the buildings.</p> <p>Around noon yesterday, the first such attack was launched on a prison near central Aleppo. Rebels claim the two-hour fight for control of the facility led to the deaths of guards and freedom for many inmates, some of whom then quickly joined their ranks.</p> <p>To the south of the facility, smoke continued to billow above the suburb of Salahedin, which was a rebel stronghold until Thursday and is now a bombed-out wasteland.</p> <p>Elsewhere, in the east, the call to prayer from suburban mosques echoed across a vast and tired city. The holiest day of the week, in the third week of the month-long Ramadan fast, was largely sombre and silent.</p> <p>\"Maybe our victory will come after Eid [the three-day festival to mark the end of Ramadan]\", said Abu Nour, an Aleppo rebel whose unit was forced to flee Salahedin. \"I don't want to have to think too much about what will happen next. All I know is that what we are doing is right.\"</p> <p>As she helped neighbours pick through the ruins of the house bombed by jets, one woman didn't seem so sure. \"What have they done to Aleppo?\" she said. \"What are they doing to Syria. How will it end?\"</p>",

  "<p>The shock of losing a precious job in a town afflicted by high unemployment is always hard. A foundation for a stable family life and secure home instantly disappears, replaced with a future filled with fears over health insurance, missed mortgage payments and the potential for a slip below the breadline.</p> <p>But for Bonnie Borman \u2013 and 170 other men and women in Freeport, Illinois \u2013 there is a brutal twist to the torture. Borman, 52, and the other workers of a soon-to-be-shuttered car parts plant are personally training the Chinese workers who will replace them.</p> <p>It's a surreal experience, they say. For months they have watched their plant being dismantled and shipped to China, piece by piece, as they show teams of Chinese workers how to do the jobs they have dedicated their lives to.</p> <p>\"It's not easy to get up in the morning, training them to do your job so that you can be made unemployed,\" said Borman, pictured, a mother of three who has worked for 23 years at the Sensata auto sensors plant.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-394528205\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2012/8/10/1344608047322/Bonnie-Borman-at-Sensata--004.jpg\" alt=\"Bonnie Borman at Sensata in Freeport\" width=\"220\" height=\"132\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bonnie Borman at Sensata in Freeport. Photograph: Carlos Ortiz/Polaris</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Carlos Ortiz/Polaris</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Borman knows her eventual fate in the stricken economy that surrounds Freeport. \"I am going to be competing for minimum wage jobs with my own daughter,\" she said.</p> <p>Such scenes have been common in America as manufacturing has fled abroad in search of cheaper wages.</p> <p>But, in the midst of the 2012 presidential election, Freeport is different. For Sensata is majority-owned by Bain Capital, the private equity firm once led by Mitt Romney, that has become a hugely controversial symbol of how the modern globalised American economy works. Indeed, Romney still owns millions of dollars of shares in the Bain funds that own Sensata.</p> <p>So as Sensata strips out costs by sacking American workers in favour of Chinese ones, the value of Romney's own investments could rise, putting money into the pockets of a Republican challenger who has placed job creation in America at the heart of his bid for the White House.</p> <p>The story of how Bain became involved in a car factory in a small town amid the rolling farmland of northern Illinois is emblematic of modern financial wheeling and dealing.</p> <p>Bain bought the firm that was to become Sensata in 2006, when it was the Texan arm of a Dutch company. It then floated it on the stock exchange in 2010, but kept a majority stake. Sensata came to own the Freeport plant at the beginning of 2011 as part of a wider purchase of a car parts business from Honeywell.</p> <p>Sensata spokesman Jacob Sayer said closing the Freeport plant to cut costs was a key element of the Honeywell deal. \"If that had not been part of the strategy, then the deal would not have been so attractive,\" he said.</p> <p>Bain has declined to comment. But it has made a lot of money from owning Sensata, quadrupling its initial 2006 investment. In business circles that focus on the bottom line is all that matters. But, not surprisingly, it cuts less ice in Illinois.</p> <p>Workers insist their operation is profitable and makes top quality auto sensors.</p> <p>\"I understand business needs to make a profit. But this product has always made a ton of money. It's just that they think it is not enough money. They are greedy,\" said Tom Gaulraupp, who has put in 33 years at the plant and is facing the prospect of becoming jobless at the age of 54.</p> <p>Mark Shreck, a 36-year-old father-of-three, confessed he was one of the few workers not surprised at the layoffs, as this is the second time his job has moved to China. \"I feel this is what companies do nowadays,\" he said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-394528206\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2012/8/10/1344605889495/Freeport-mayor-George-Gau-004.jpg\" alt=\"Freeport mayor George Gaulrapp\" width=\"220\" height=\"132\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Freeport mayor George Gaulrapp. Photograph: Carlos Ortiz/Polaris</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Carlos Ortiz/Polaris</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Freeport workers have appealed to Bain and Romney to save their plant. The local town council, several Illinois politicians and the state's Democratic governor have all rallied to their cause. \"This company is competitive globally. They make a profit here. But Bain Capital decided to squeeze it a little further. That is not what capitalism is meant to be about,\" said Freeport mayor George Gaulrapp, 52, pictured.</p> <p>The anger towards Bain and Romney is palpable. Romney has become the target for the emotions of a community who built lives based on the idea of a steady manufacturing job: a concept out of place in the sort of fluid buy-and-sell world from which Bain prospers. \"I didn't have a clue what Bain was before this happened,\" said Cheryl Randecker, 52. \"Now when I hear Romney speak it makes me sick to my stomach.\"</p> <p>President Barack Obama's campaign has sought to make Bain's record of buying and selling companies \u2013 often involving job losses \u2013 a key part of its strategy of painting Romney as an out-of-touch super-rich financier. In turn, Romney, who left Bain in 1999, has defended his long career there, saying Bain ends up generating economic growth and spurring job creation. Far from profiting from layoffs, Romney has portrayed Bain as a model for the American future.</p> <p>That argument stuns Illinois governor Pat Quinn. \"If he thinks that is the model for American economic growth then he is barking up the wrong tree,\" Quinn told The Guardian.</p> <p>Of course, no one at the Romney campaign wants to be linked with the Freeport plant closure. \"Governor Romney is not familiar with this issue and has not been involved in the management of Bain since 1999,\" said campaign spokeswoman Amanda Henneberg.</p> <p>Nor does anyone at Sensata want to discuss the social costs of their decision. \"We don't have any statement on the impact it has on Freeport,\" said Sayer. Bain did not return a request for comment.</p> <p>But the impact is enormous on individuals and city alike. Freeport, a city of 26,000, is struggling. Its downtown features empty store fronts and businesses barely getting by.</p> <p>The loss of 170 solid well-paying jobs will ripple out into this economy, further straining city resources, hurting businesses and eventually adding to Freeport's foreclosure problem. \"There is a sense of fright. People don't know what this means for their families, their health insurance and whether they will keep their homes,\" said mayor Gaulrapp.</p> <p>It is already happening.</p> <p>Tom Gaulrapp \u2013 no relation to the mayor \u2013 worries he will be homeless. \"It is a real possibility,\" he said. Randecker's daughter has already quit nursing college in Iowa to save money. Joanne Penniston, 35, is wondering if she will have to leave town. \"I would have to uproot my whole family,\" she said.</p> <p>Dot Turner, who joined the firm when she was 18 and freshly married and then put in 43 years on the factory floor, has suddenly found long cherished retirement plans thrown into disarray. She is 62 and knows finding another job will be tough. \"I should not be standing in an unemployment line at this stage of my life,\" she said.</p> <p>Turner too finds it hard to hear Romney talk of creating jobs when the post she has worked at for four decades \u2013 and which paid for three children to go to college \u2013 has just been sent overseas by a firm majority-controlled by Bain. \"When Romney talks about creating jobs, it is just a big fairy tale,\" she said.</p> <p>There is little chance of a happy ending for Freeport. The workers collect petitions and hold demonstrations. But they know they are likely doomed. \"We are not stupid. We know we are unlikely to save our jobs. But if we get the next company that tries it to think twice, then maybe we save our neighbour's job. Or our children's,\" said Tom Gaulrapp.</p> <p>Meanwhile, bit by bit, the machines inside the Freeport plant are being packed up, beginning their long journey to China. By the end of the year it will be over. \"It is kind of like part of your family being shipped out - I worked with that stuff for years. Now there's nothing left but a discoloration on the floor where the equipment used to sit,\" Gaulrapp said.</p>",
  "<p>One point that got mostly overlooked in the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2012/aug/09/google-record-fine-ftc-safari\">Federal Trade Commission (FTC) fine against Google</a> - $22.5m, which would be a lot for you or me, but amounts to about 15 hours' operating profits based on the company's operating profits from its second quarter - was the dissenting opinion of one of the five commissioners, J Thomas Rosch, from the majority.</p> <p>(<strong>Update:</strong> Rosch has again dissented after the <a href=\"http://ftc.gov/opa/2012/08/facebook.shtm\">FTC settled with Facebook</a> over its altering of privacy settings. More in the piece below.)</p> <p>The commissioners split 4-1 in what they thought should be the correct way to treat Google over its behaviour. In fact, Rosch's dissent was so strong that the other four had to write an <a href=\"http://www.ftc.gov/os/caselist/c4336/120809googlestatement.pdf\">opinion</a> (PDF) explaining their reasoning.</p> <p>But first, here's Rosch's beef. In his <a href=\"http://www.ftc.gov/os/caselist/c4336/120809googleroschstatement.pdf\">minority opinion</a> (PDF), he says that he thinks that the FTC Act obliges him (and the others) </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>to determine whether there is both 'reason to believe' there is liability and whether the complaint is in the 'public interest' before we vote out any complaint, whether it be a litigation complaint or a consent decree.</p> </blockquote> <p>Clear enough so far? He's setting out what the ground rules are for deciding whether to vote on something: liability and public interest.</p> <p>Now it gets interesting. </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There is no question in my mind that there is \"reason to believe\" that Google is in contempt of a prior Commission order. However, I dissent from accepting this consent decree because it arguably cannot be concluded that the consent decree is in the public interest when it contains a denial of liability.</p> </blockquote> <p>That is: if Google won't agree that it is liable for what it has done, then Rosch doesn't think it should be let off with just a fine. In fact, he's really quite vexed (reading between the lines) at the fact that all Google does accept about the FTC is that it has jurisdiction, and that it's doing this in the right location: He points to the FTC Order (handing down the fine) which says \"[The] Defendant [Google] denies any violation of the FTC Order, any and all liability for the claims set forth in the Complaint, and all material allegations of the Complaint save for those regarding jurisdiction and venue.\" </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Yet, at the very same time, the Commission supports a civil penalty of$22.5 million against Google for that very same conduct. Condoning a denial of liability in circumstances such as these is unprecedented.</p> </blockquote> <p>He also points out that Google has been charged before with \"engaging in deceptive conduct\" over Buzz, its social network which enrolled you whether or not you really wanted to be enrolled (much the same as Google+, in fact, though that seems to handle privacy rather better - so much better that nobody can tell how much of anything actually goes on there). Google, says Rosch, is essentially being charged with contempt of the FTC's Consent Order over Buzz - which is how it got into this whole thing.</p> <p>Says Rosch: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\"This scenario \u2013 violation of a consent order \u2013 makes the Commission's acceptance of Google's denial of liability all the more inexplicable.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>He points out that $22.5m \"represents a de minimis amount of Google's profit or revenues.\" But it's even worse, he says: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\"the Commission now has allowed liability to be denied not only in this matter but also in the Facebook settlement where Facebook simply promised to 'go and sin no more' (unlike Google, Facebook was not previously under order). There is nothing to prevent future respondents with fewer resources than Google and with lower profiles than Google and Facebook from denying liability in the future too.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>And that's the real nub of Rosch's complaint with the mamjority decision: that if you let Google (and Facebook, which was also put under a consent order essentially for swapping around its privacy rules so often) off without admitting that what they did was wrong, then others will too. And if you <em>don't</em> do that, then it becomes one law for the big guys with <a href=\"http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/04/23/under-scrutiny-google-spends-record-amount-on-lobbying/\">hefty lobbying operations</a>, and one law for the small ones.</p> <p>For complete clarity, I emailed the FTC on Thursday, and Commissioner Rosch's office responded to my queries as follows: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Commissioner Rosch doesn't think that the Commission has any business accepting a denial of liability when 1) Google sees fit to pay over $22 million in civil penalties; 2) Google is in clear contempt of a Commission order; and 3) there is no limiting principle, so that the acceptance of a denial of liability in this case represents a precedent for respondents less well-heeled and with a lower profile than Google to also negotiate a denial of liability. Commissioner Rosch notes that the FTC has a precedent here -- it is to allow defendants to \"neither admit nor deny\" liability. The Commission just didn't hold Google to that precedent in this case.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Update:</strong> in his <a href=\"http://ftc.gov/os/caselist/0923184/120810facebookstmtrosch.pdf\">Facebook dissenting opinion</a> (PDF), Rosch says: \"I cannot find that either the \"reason to believe\" or the \"in the interest of the public\" requirement is satisfied when, as here, there is an express denial of the allegations set forth in the complaint.\" So it's just as with Google: Rosch feels that companies should take responsibility for their actions (or inactions) - and wants the FTC to shift to a model like the Securities and Exchange Commission, where if you deny the charges then you can't be part of a consent order (essentially, getting you out of going to trial).</p> <p>There's certainly evidence that within the FTC, Google isn't exactly flavour of the month. In a call with reporters, David Vladeck, the director of the FTC's bureau of consumer protection, pointed to other privacy screwups by Google - Buzz, the Street View Wi-Fi data collection - and <a href=\"http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/08/09/f-t-c-fines-google-22-5-million-for-safari-privacy-violations/?ref=technology\">said</a> \"The social contract has to be that if you're going to hold on to people's most private data, you have to do a better job of honoring your privacy commitments\". He wasn't impressed by Google's explanation that the cookie workaround was unintentional: \"As a regulator, it is hard to know which answer is worse: 'I didn't know' or 'I did it deliberately'.\" </p> <p>Google's statement, beyond which it's not shifting, is that \"We set the highest standards of privacy and security for our users.\" </p> <p>But if Rosch was the dissenter, why did the other four think it was OK to let Google off without admitting liability? Here's what they say: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Here, as in all cases, a defendant's denial of liability in a settlement agreement has no bearing on the Commission's determination as to whether it has reason to believe the defendant has violated the law or that a proposed settlement will afford appropriate relief for the Commission's charges. To the contrary, the Commission acts based on its consideration of the staff's investigative work, and in this instance we have strong reason to believe that Google violated its order.</p> </blockquote> <p>In other words: denying that you killed somebody doesn't cut much ice when you're found holding the knife still in their heart. (Or, less dramatically, denying you ever took those cookies isn't much use when you've been photographed on CCTV with your hand in the cookie jar.)</p> <p>The key question, the commissioners say, is whether Google will now abide by the consent order. The fine, they imply, is a big whack on the back of the hand for Google \"when the accompanying complaint does not allege that the conduct at issue yielded significant revenue or endured for a significant period of time.\" That's an important point, since there's absolutely no way of knowing how much revenue - if any - Google actually derived from what it did. </p> <p>Yet simple measures of revenue aren't the key point. What's really important, as Vladeck said, is whether we, as consumers, can trust companies with our data, because our data is becoming all that there is of us (and if you don't believe that, read again about how <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2012/08/apple-amazon-mat-honan-hacking/\">technology writer Matt Honan had his digital life erased</a> by a couple of hackers who wanted access to his Twitter account).</p> <p>And after this fine, and with the EC still pondering whether it accepts <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2012/jul/02/google-eu-antitrust-case\">Google's offerings to solve its antitrust questions</a> over search, and the FTC - them again - <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2012/apr/27/ftc-google-antitrust\">pondering the question of whether Google has abused its dominant position in search</a>, and with the Wi-Fi/Street View issue rumbling on in Europe (with the German data protection authorities considering what action to take, and now the UK's <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2012/jul/27/google-street-view-controversy\">Information Commissioner's Office doing a forensic examination of the data</a>), and with the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2012/aug/07/authors-damages-google-book-copyright\">Google Book scanning controversy</a> still rumbling on too, one wouldn't say that Google is out of the woods yet. Even if the FTC's fine represents less than a day's profits, the effects on its reputation could linger for a lot longer.</p>",
  "<p>This year marks the centenary of the death of Octavia Hill, the Victorian social reformer and pioneer of social housing.</p> <p>In 1864, moved to action by the appalling state of housing for London's poor and with the financial backing of writer John Ruskin, Hill took the keys of handful of run-down properties in Marylebone Place known as \"Little Hell\". A decade later Hill was providing homes for 3,000 tenants around the capital, achieving a 5% return for investors and plunging any extra profit back into the community.</p> <p>Hill was a pioneer of social and affordable housing but also a campaigner for mixed communities, regeneration and clean air. She campaigned for open spaces within the capital, and helped to prevent development on Parliament Hill and Hampstead Heath in north London.</p> <p>Though Hill had a great passion for both social housing and the preservation of green spaces, the two now often find themselves on opposite sides of the development argument. The National Trust, co-founded by Hill, opposed the government's National Planning Policy Framework, the policy that cabinet members hope will \"help build the homes the next generation needs\".</p> <p>With Hill's early distinction between the deserving and undeserving poor echoed in today's debate over welfare reform, how should Hill's principles be applied in the modern age?

  "<p>Beyond the p\u00e9ripherique, a short drive through the <a href=\"http://www.paris.fr/english/parks-woods-gardens-and-cemeteries/woods/bois-de-vincennes/rub_8211_stand_34153_port_18985\" title=\"\">Bois de Vincennes</a> \u2013 by Paris's close-cropped standards almost unimaginably untamed \u2013 is the <a href=\"http://www.theatre-du-soleil.fr/thsol/index.php?lang=en\" title=\"\">Th\u00e9\u00e2tre du Soleil</a>, the company Ariane Mnouchkine co-founded and has run for the last half-century. The theatre is located somewhere in the grounds of the Cartoucherie, a<a href=\"http://www.theatre-du-soleil.fr/thsol/a-propos-du-theatre-du-soleil/l-historique,163/?lang=fr\" title=\"\"> former munitions factory</a> buried in the dark of the wood. </p> <p>For many, the journey is a pilgrimage. Mnouchkine is regularly ranked as one of the world's most influential directors, the <a href=\"http://www.internationalibsenaward.com/winners/adriane/\" title=\"\">only female winner of the international Ibsen award</a>, whose productions \u2013 20-odd in the last 48 years \u2013 are often spoken of in awe. Soon after the <em>\u00e9v\u00e9nements</em> of 1968, Th\u00e9\u00e2tre du Soleil exploded to attention with its rough-and-tumble devised works <em>1789</em> and <em>1793</em>, which brought the history of the French revolution to scandalous, shocking life. Their cycles of <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XquydfFTvos\" title=\"\"><em>Richard II, Twelfth Night and Henry IV</em></a> (1981\u201384) reached an estimated 250,000 people, fusing Shakespearean history with stylised imagery drawn from Japan, Bali, India, then a four-part odyssey into Greek tragedy, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OahkdsfIPgg\" title=\"\"><em>Les Atrides</em></a><em> </em>(1990\u201392), that blended Kathakali with kabuki.</p> <p>Always restless, Mnouchkine has sometimes made migration itself her subject: 2003's <a href=\"http://theater.nytimes.com/mem/theater/treview.html?res=9805E5DC1F30F933A15754C0A9639C8B63&amp;fta=y\" title=\"\"><em>Le D\u00e9rnier Caravans\u00e9rail</em></a> (The Last Caravan Stop) dramatised the experience of refugees from Kurdistan, Chechnya, Iran, Russia and a flurry of other countries into an extraordinary six-hour experience that featured no fewer than 169 characters. In French, the word <em>spectacle</em> is simply the offhand word for \"show\", yet Th\u00e9\u00e2tre du Soleil interpret it literally \u2013 they seem unable to make theatre that is anything less than epic.</p> <p>But for all its flamboyant internationalism \u2013 21 nationalities are represented among Th\u00e9\u00e2tre du Soleil's ranks, and it now has sister companies drawn from Afghanistan and Cambodia \u2013 the company has only ever visited Britain twice, creating the intriguing paradox that more people here have read about their work than can ever have seen it (not least because Mnouchkine almost never grants interviews to the English-speaking press). </p> <p>When they bring their sea-soaked <a href=\"http://www.eif.co.uk/folespoir\" title=\"\"><em>Les Naufrag\u00e9s du Fol Espoir (Aurores</em>) to the Edinburgh festival later this month</a> \u2013 teasingly described as \"a play collectively devised by Th\u00e9\u00e2tre du Soleil, half-written by H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Cixous [and] loosely based on a mysterious, posthumous novel by Jules Verne\" \u2013 it will be the first time they have toured to the UK for 20 years. It is quite a moment. The Ibsen citation declared: \"to enter a Mnouchkine production is to enter another world.\" In the ringing phrase of <a href=\"http://books.google.co.uk/books/about/Ariane_Mnouchkine.html?id=nMxwQgAACAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y\" title=\"\">the critic Judith G Miller</a>, she is nothing less than a \"nomad of the imagination\".</p> <p>If one were looking to cast a nomad of the imagination, the mild-looking woman in front of me, swathed in a baggy grey hoodie, a tussle of white hair coiling around her spectacles, isn't an obvious candidate for the role. It has been arranged that we will talk after the company has lunched together. Though the Cartoucherie is not the commune it once was, this isn't so much a meal, I sense, as a metaphor for how the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre du Soleil operates. \"Well, it's important,\" Mnouchkine replies in softly accented English. \"We work a lot, so life has to be as nice as possible, and relationships too \u2013 we are a company of 75 people now, and of course there are crises, problems.\" So it's not entirely the workers' paradise it seems? She laughs. \"Sometimes it's hell! Sometimes it's terrible. It is made by human beings. They're not angels, and they're not devils either. They can be both. We can all be both.\"</p> <p>It's tempting to speculate that this urge to forge a family \u2013 and her lifelong fascination with migration \u2013 has its roots in Mnouchkine's own past. She was <a href=\"http://dlibrary.acu.edu.au/staffhome/siryan/academy/theatres/mnouchkine,%20ariane.htm\" title=\"\">born on 3 March 1939</a>, to a British mother, the actor Jane Hannen, and the film producer Alexandre Mnouchkine, a Jewish\u2013Russian \u00e9migr\u00e9 who fled to Paris with his parents after the revolution. Mnouchkine rarely talks about her mother (her parents separated when she was 13) and perhaps the most important relationship in her life was with her father, who <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituary-alexandre-mnouchkine-1453830.html\" title=\"\">became one of France's most successful postwar film producers</a>, and remained until his death in 1993 an intimate artistic collaborator, helping finance her first theatre, scraping together cash for what remains <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-dJx0w6VhA\" title=\"\">her only full-length feature, 1976's <em>Moli\u00e8re</em></a>. \"At every moment of my life,\" she said in 2005, \"the only thing of which I was entirely certain was that my father loved me.\"</p> <p>After France crumbled to the Germans in June 1940, the young family was forced into hiding; Alexandre's parents, unable to escape, were dragged from their home, then deported and gassed. Mnouchkine's only authored script is an adaptation of <a href=\"http://books.google.co.uk/books/about/Mephisto.html?id=0vkt3vgoBLYC\" title=\"\"><em>Mephisto</em>, Klaus Mann's bitterly satirical novel about the rise of Nazism</a>, and her deep sympathy for displaced peoples and the victims of conflict is not confined to the stage. She has been a passionate campaigner for human rights, especially in the Palestinian Territories, Tibet and Afghanistan, and in 1996 <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/1996/04/04/world/african-immigrants-refusing-to-leave-france.html\" title=\"\">the company opened its doors to 382 illegal immigrants</a>, many from the former French colony of Mali.</p> <p>Though the young Ariane grew up watching Parisian theatre \u2013 it was there that she first saw Kathakali \u2013 it's surprising to hear that she got a taste for performance in Britain (though there is admittedly the family connection: <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/theguardian/2011/jan/15/harriet-walter-interview-dame\" title=\"\">the actor Harriet Walter</a> is a cousin). While on a year abroad from the Sorbonne in the late 1950s, studying English in Oxford, she drifted into the ambit of the Oxford University Dramatic Society. She recalls: \"I was getting a bit bored because I didn't have enough to do, so I joined. I worked with Ken [Loach] and John [McGrath] as an assistant, we became good friends. Anthony Page came to direct <em>Coriolanus</em>.\" What was it that caught her about theatre? She sounds almost dreamy. \"It was a realm, an island \u2013 a world that could be transformed, clarified, harmonised, analysed. I still remember the night I decided that theatre was going to be my life.\"</p> <p>Back in Paris in 1959, and still a student, she set up ATEP (<a href=\"http://www.theatre-du-soleil.fr/thsol/nos-spectacles-et-nos-films/nos-spectacles/genghis-khan-1961/programme\" title=\"\">l'Association Th\u00e9\u00e2trale des Etudiants Parisiens</a>) \u2013 a leftist rival to the Sorbonne's classical company that promptly made itself notorious by sponsoring political lectures during the Algerian war. It was this group that evolved into the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre du Soleil, founded as a cooperative in the summer of 1964, with each member contributing 900 Francs (salaries are still more or less equal across the company, and far from generous: \u20ac1,400 a month for new arrivals, \u20ac1,800 for long-term members, including Mnouchkine herself). Naming the theatre after the sun, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/1992/09/27/theater/theater-behind-the-masks-of-a-moralist.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=pm\" title=\"\">Mnouchkine told the New York Times in 1992</a>, felt inevitable: \"We were looking for life, light, heat, beauty, strength, fertility.\"</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395159557\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/8/1344432563117/Scene-from-the-play-Le-De-008.jpg\" alt=\"Scene from the play Le Dernier Caravanserail\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A scene from Le D\u00e9rnier Caravans\u00e9rail at the Theatre du Soleil.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: pr</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It was a British play that gave them their first hit \u2013 <a href=\"http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/theatre_journal/summary/v050/50.1pr_wesker.html\" title=\"\">a production of Arnold Wesker's <em>The Kitchen</em></a>, performed in 1967 in the radical setting of the Cirque M\u00e9drano, whose unsparingly, precise choreography, learned from <a href=\"http://www.ecole-jacqueslecoq.com/en\" title=\"\">a stint with the circus guru Jacques Lecoq</a>, introduced smart Parisian audiences to the unvarnished realism of this angry young Englishman (albeit one who had <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/stage/2012/may/21/arnold-wesker-food-for-thought\" title=\"\">sweated in the real-life kitchens of Paris's Restaurant le Rallye</a>). \"I'm still so grateful to Arnold for giving us this play,\" Mnouchkine smiles. \"It was a big success in England, we were really <em>nobody</em>, and he gave us the rights. Suddenly we existed.\"</p> <p>Nonetheless, it was a canny bit of planning. Wesker's script makes pointed links between the broiling tensions in the workplace and those of wider society; by May the following year French students were on the streets, and TdS threw itself into <em>la lutte</em>, performing the play for striking car workers. But though the company had found a purpose, it still didn't have a home: a struggle to take over the defunct Les Halles market ended in failure (Mnouchkine still grimaces at the memory), but in 1970 they got a tip-off about the old armaments factory in Vincennes: \"It was a miracle, really. Somebody told us about it, and I arrived here the same day. A soldier was cleaning up and I said, 'What are you doing?' He said, 'I'm closing up, the army has gone, I'm the last one.'\" She looks triumphant. \"We squatted before he left.\"</p> <p>The company set about the arduous process of transforming the derelict units into living, breathing spaces: accommodation for anyone who needed it, prop manufacture and storage, wardrobe \u2013 and of course, the theatre itself, a huge hall under an expansive glazed roof that is internally rebuilt for every production (for Edinburgh audiences a life-size replica is currently being raised in an exhibition hall near the airport).</p> <p>Later, I am escorted by an actor through the Cartoucherie's treasury of converted warehouses: a workshop for musician <a href=\"http://www.artworksberlin.de/englisch/Lem%EAtre/index.html\" title=\"\">Jean-Jacques Lem\u00eatre</a>, stuffed with improbable-looking instruments; cavernous costume stores, with shoes and camisoles neatly filed in boxes on one wall, fur and velvet capes beneath blankets on racks; a mask workshop.</p> <p>People who buy a ticket to the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre du Soleil don't simply get a show: they are absorbed into a dramatic experience whose every detail, from the <em>navette </em>that picks them up from the M\u00e9tro to the meal they eat beforehand, has been carefully, almost ritualistically planned. Members of the company cook and serve; visitors are invited to peer through windows into dressing rooms to observe the cast putting on their makeup. This is one of the few theatre companies where audiences are required to put in nearly as much mental preparation as the actors; one of the earliest, too, to explore the concept of theatre as immersion, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/2011/jul/04/immersive-theatre\" title=\"\">decades before Punchdrunk and other such companies</a>.</p> <p>Mnouchkine explains: \"We're not a shop. It's unfortunate we need people's money, but we're not selling something. That's why I hate the word 'production': it's not produced, it's a ceremony, it's a ritual, it is something which is very important for your mental strength, and you should go out of the theatre stronger and more human than when you went in.\" And she herself still doles out food and tears tickets? She pulls a face. \"The <em>least</em> you can do is welcome people.\"</p> <p>Although Mnouchkine's career is sometimes separated into phases \u2013 from the early, improvisatory works, through the epic sequences of Asian-influenced histories, to her border-crossing collaborations with <a href=\"http://www.egs.edu/faculty/helene-cixous/biography/\" title=\"\">writer and philosopher Cixous</a>, who first became involved with the company in the mid-80s \u2013 the company's lifeblood has been improvisation. Nearly everything you see on stage is created collaboratively \u2013 in the early years laboriously observed and notated from rehearsals, these days captured by a small video camera. She looks scornful when I ask why improvisation is so important. \"It is a strange question, because would you ask an author why ink is important? It's a way of writing. In our company, actors are really the authors.\" Even when they're dealing with a pre-existing text? \"Theatre is not only what you say, it's what you do. It's the reaction that has to be caught, it's the mood, the emotion, the state of mind. Even when we worked on Shakespeare, we improvised. Otherwise you just repeat famous phrases. What you have to do is try and understand not only how Shakespeare wrote it, but how he heard it.\" She mimes a splat on the table. \"What did he feel when he suddenly discovered, say, Falstaff landing on his paper?\"</p> <p>Mnouchkine experienced her own thrill of discovery when she first travelled east, taking a year off in the early 1960s to explore Japan, India, south-east Asia and, bravely for a 23-year-old travelling alone, remoter parts of the Middle East (she remembers seeing women accessorising their hijabs with miniskirts in a pre-Russian Afghanistan). It opened the young director's eyes to art forms as richly diverse as <em>bunraku</em> puppetry and Javanese gamelan. \"It was a shock,\" she reflects. \"It was like suddenly finding what you knew existed but hadn't seen. Asian theatre is a master for metaphor.\"</p> <p>It was years before those metaphors crept into her own work, initially in the Shakespeare productions, but the lessons were profound. \"It took some time to digest everything, to make it ours, not what we call <em>Japonaiserie</em>.\" There was, however, criticism that this was exactly what the productions were \u2013 well-meaning but naive attempts to borrow ideas from the east and attach them to western forms. \"In <em>Richard II</em> there was still a little bit of <em>Japonaiserie</em>,\" she admits. \"We use what we need. We're like a bunch of <em>m\u00e9caniciens foux</em>, mad mechanics, who pick up this tool, then that other one, use it in strange places.\" She remarked once, I say, that Asian theatre helped her escape the trap of naturalism. She smiles cryptically. \"Naturalism is a good word for a bad idea. Art is to do with transformation.\"</p> <p>Like a surprising number of directors, Mnouchkine seems touchingly in awe of the powers exhibited by actors. I wonder if she ever feels envious. \"When I'm on stage, I don't believe myself,\" she says. \"But when I look at them I believe. Even someone who is supposed to be a king but looks like a potato.\"</p> <p>She resists talking about her family, her father aside; although she had a relationship with Cixous and, after they went their separate ways, another female member of the company, her private life remains private. While almost childlike in her warmth, there is a trace of remoteness about her. When she won the Ibsen award, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/stage/2010/mar/09/les-naufrages-du-fol-espoir\" title=\"\">she shared the \u20ac300,000 prize money with her colleagues</a>, so they could have an extra month of rehearsal. I wonder where the company ends and she begins. Perhaps it isn't a distinction that means much.</p> <p>One answer might lie in <em>Les Eph\u00e9m\u00e8res</em> (2006), roughly translatable as \"Ephemera\", described by one critic as a show in which <a href=\"http://theater2.nytimes.com/2009/07/10/theater/reviews/10ephemeres.html?n=Top%2FReference%2FTimes%20Topics%2FSubjects%2FT%2FTheater\" title=\"\">\"the grey fabric of everyday life \u2026 is made to shimmer with significance and quiet intensity\"</a>. In some ways her most intimate piece to date, it was a mosaic of narrative fragments played out \u2013 rhythmically, heartstoppingly \u2013 on wheeled stages spun by hand through the darkened space: an image of how individual memories become history, and also of their elusiveness. Several scenes emerged from memories Mnouchkine offered herself: one, perhaps rawest, of her mother saying goodbye to their family. She admits she was taken aback to see it creeping into the show. \"It was by accident: all the actors were telling their own memories, so I found myself obliged, in a way. And then one actor suddenly grabbed it and put it on the stage.\" Was it strange, seeing her own life represented after a lifetime representing others? \"Yes, but also rather beautiful. The person who was really surprised and moved was my sister. She had no idea: I was so occupied with everything that I didn't think to warn her.\"</p> <p>Mnouchkine has fought many battles during her 73 years: getting the company going, finding it a home, travelling, researching, giving political press conferences, housing refugees; once, in 1995, taking part in a <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/1995/08/27/world/chirac-backs-hunger-strike-over-bosnia.html\" title=\"\">month-long hunger strike to protest France's failure to intervene in Bosnia</a>. She remarked in an interview a few years back that she felt that her \"forces of consolation [were] diminishing\". What did she mean? \"It's true,\" she sighs. \"I don't feel my age except in some parts of my body, and in that it takes more time to <em>se conseler</em>, how do you say, console oneself? When I was young I was violent, in a way. I would <em>break</em> sorrow.\" She mimes boxing. \"I don't do that any more, I just put it away. Do you understand what I mean? It takes a lot of strength to get over sorrow.\" Her voice softens. \"I still do it, it just takes more time.\"</p> <p>Her theatre has sometimes been called utopian. Is that a good thing? \"Utopia is not something which is impossible; it is something that has not been done yet.\" So somewhere utopia exists? \"Yes,\" she says, with disarming definiteness. \"We are on the path to utopia. I accept that.\"</p> <p><em>\u2022 </em><a href=\"http://www.eif.co.uk/folespoir\" title=\"\"><em>Les Naufrag\u00e9s du Fol Espoir (Aurores)</em> is at the Edinburgh festival</a> from 23-28 August. www.eif.co.uk/folespoir.</p>",
  "<p>The Perseid meteor display is upon us. Over the course of the next four days, Earth will plough through the debris stream left by a giant comet that has been circling the sun since the birth of the solar system. </p> <p>Each tiny cometary fragment that hits our atmosphere is usually no larger than a speck of dust. Yet it burns up with an incandescent display that we call a shooting star. If you want to get technical about it: a meteor.</p> <p>This year, the Perseids will be visible from the northern hemisphere between 11 and 14 August. </p> <p>If the clouds cooperate and the skies are clear this weekend, the prime times to watch are generally between midnight and 3am. This year the night of the 12th going into the 13th is expected to be the best. But meteor showers are extremely variable and if you have the chance, watch in the early hours of any morning between the 11th and 14th.</p> <p>The direction in which to look is the east. If you know your constellations, find Perseus then look at its surroundings. Take a deck chair, blankets and a hot thermos to keep you company. Even in August, you will need the last two. Then wait. The expected rate of meteors this year is <a href=\"http://www.jodrellbank.manchester.ac.uk/astronomy/nightsky/nskyaug12.html\">a few dozen per hour</a>.</p> <p>Every Perseid you see was once in the tail of Comet Swift-Tuttle, a 27-kilometre-wide iceberg in space. It spends most of its time in the outer solar system, reaching beyond the orbit of Pluto. Then, every 133 years, it dives past the sun, replenishing the supply of Perseids.</p> <p>Swift-Tuttle, like all the comets, is in a constant state of disintegration. Comets hail from the outer solar system where icy compounds are easily maintained because it is so cold. As a comet approaches the sun, however, the heat melts the ice and solid grains of dust are released into space. This creates the ephemeral tails that are seen stretching across the night sky. </p> <p>As the tails disperse they create the debris streams that give us meteor showers. There are <a href=\"http://www.astro.amu.edu.pl/~jopek/MDC2007/index.php\">64 established meteor showers</a> that hit Earth every year and the Perseids are generally considered the best. </p> <p>And if you really want to impress your geeky friends, while simultaneously boring everybody else, ask them why meteors burn up in Earth's atmosphere. The chances are they will say friction. It's a popular misconception.</p> <p>Friction is caused when objects slide against one another. That is not the case for a meteor. When it hits the upper atmosphere it is travelling faster than 160,000 kilometres per hour (100,000 miles per hour). This compresses the air in front of it. When any gas is squeezed it naturally heats up. In this case the temperature reaches several thousand degrees, and this burns up the meteor. No sliding motion, no friction.</p> <p>As you're watching this weekend, spare a thought for the wonder of it all. Every single one of those meteors was born as the Earth was forming, about 4.5 billion years ago. That means each has a story to tell.</p> <p>By capturing the meteors before their demise, as the <a href=\"http://stardust.jpl.nasa.gov/home/index.html\">Stardust mission</a> did, we can begin to read the story of the birth of the solar system.</p> <h2>How to share your photos</h2> <p>Email a <strong>high-resolution jpeg or tiff photo file (maximum size 20MB)</strong> of this year's Perseids to <a href=\"mailto:your.photos@guardian.co.uk\">your.photos@guardian.co.uk</a> with \"Perseids meteor shower\" in the subject heading and a short description in the email of what you could see along with <strong>your name, location, and when the picture was taken</strong>.</p> <p>If you can fit it all in a tweet, you can also send your pictures to us via Twitter.

  "<p>With just two days of competition left, most of the medals have already been handed out. So the time has come for the Armchair Athlete to award a few of his own for those events that weren't in the original schedule, but which have become every bit as closely fought and entertaining for those of us left watching the Olympics from the living room sofa.</p> <h2>Biggest moaners</h2> <p>Britain's smile has been just that bit wider these past two weeks as the failures and the gripings of our three most bitter rivals has made our own success all the sweeter. After snatching the Olympics from under French noses in 2005, the Brits have outclassed the French everywhere apart from the swimming pool. Especially the velodrome, where the French team accused us of having magic wheels \u2026 wheels that just happened to be made in France. The Aussies and Germans have also badly underperformed, with their home team fans and media turning on them and calling them chokers. Life doesn't get much better.</p> <p>Gold: France</p> <p>Silver: Australia</p> <p>Bronze: Germany</p> <h2>Britain's greatest Olympian</h2> <p>Before the games, there was only one candidate: Sir Steve Redgrave with his five rowing gold medals. After Bradley Wiggins won gold for the time trial on the first Wednesday, the BBC decided a little recalibration was required and Wiggo was elevated above Redgrave on the grounds that he had won the most medals in total \u2013 four gold, two silver, one bronze - and declared him Britain's greatest ever Olympian. After Sir Chris Hoy had taken his sixth gold, who did the BBC call on to pass over the mantle of Britain's greatest Olympian? None other than Sir Steve.</p> <p>Gold: Sir Chris Hoy</p> <p>Silver: Sir Steve Redgrave or Bradley Wiggins</p> <p>Bronze: Sir Steve Redgrave or Bradley Wiggins</p> <h2>Most predictable exit</h2> <p>Unfortunately, the men's and women's sprint relay teams have yet to compete, so there is still some \u2013 if not much \u2013 doubt about their failure to pass the baton round the whole track. But even if they do drop it again, there was nothing less unexpected than the GB football team going out on penalties in the quarter-final. They would lose to the Marshall Islands on penalties if they played them. Nearly as inevitable was that Jonas Hoegh-Christensen would lose the medal race in the Finn sailing class, despite having led throughout the competition. No one beats Ben Ainslie. And the whole world experienced deja vu as Chinese hurdler Liu Xiang pulled up injured for the second Games in succession.</p> <p>Gold: GB football team</p> <p>Silver: Jonas Hoegh-Christensen</p> <p>Bronze: Liu Xiang</p> <h2>Rarest sighting</h2> <p>You would have had to know your athletics history to know that Seb Coe's greatest rival on the track was Steve Ovett, as the Brighton-born runner has been almost entirely airbrushed out of these Games. These are Lord Coe's Olympics and nothing is going to spoil them. While Typhoid Dave and Bozza have been piggy-backing on Team GB's success at every opportunity, Ed Miliband has gone to ground. Nick Clegg probably wishes he had too, as he was booed at the hockey. There have been a few mentions of Linford Christie in the commentary team, but no pictures. He remains unforgiven by the BBC for a failed drug test late in his career.</p> <p>Gold: Steve Ovett</p> <p>Silver: Ed Miliband</p> <p>Bronze: Linford Christie</p> <h2>Best groper</h2> <p>This has been the Games when the commentators have gone <em>mano a mano</em> with one another to grab chunks out of any passing athlete. Jake Humphrey made a late surge by snogging Mark Cavendish, and John \"Fingers\" Inverdale would have been a cert for top podium spot if he hadn't been taken away from the rowing and put out of harm's reach, anchoring the BBC's coverage from the Olympic Stadium. So Phil \"Roving Hands\" Jones was left to win at a canter as he pawed any unsuspecting athletes moments after they had crossed the finishing line.</p> <p>Gold: Phil \"Roving Hands\" Jones</p> <p>Silver: John \"Fingers\" Inverdale</p> <p>Bronze: Jake \"The Tongue\" Humphrey</p> <h2>Worst uniforms</h2> <p>One of the clearest winners. One look at the Russian tracksuits was enough to induce a migraine, and if the Russians want to conduct a postmortem on why their medal tally has been down on expectations, they could do worse than start there. Team GB might also want to examine whether its sluggish start to the Games was precipitated by the truly hideous uniforms they were made to wear for the opening ceremony. Not even Robbie Savage wants to look like Robbie Savage in Strictly Come Dancing. We also expected something rather more stylish of the Spanish.</p> <p>Gold: Russia</p> <p>Silver: Great Britain</p> <p>Bronze: Spain</p> <h2>Britain's already forgotten gold medallists</h2> <p>When Heather Stanning and Helen Glover won Britain's first gold medal of the Games in the coxless pairs after an anxious four days with nothing much to celebrate, they were hailed as Britain's saviours by John Inverdale and Clare Balding. Now they'd be lucky to be recognised in the street \u2013 though their fame lasted rather longer than that of British shooter Peter Wilson's 30 seconds. And you have to feel for Greg Rutherford, whose long jump gold was totally eclipsed by Jess Ennis and Mo Farah on the same night.</p> <p>Gold: That bloke who won the shooting</p> <p>Silver: Those women in the rowing</p> <p>Bronze: The long jumper</p> <h2>Best parents</h2> <p>Sir Chris Hoy's parents rarely miss any of their son's competitions and they did more than their fair share of nail biting and hiding their faces. But they were the epitome of reserve compared with Lynn and Rick Raisman, who lived every second of their daughter Aly's bar routine in the gymnastics. Even so, the winner \u2013 by the length of the home straight \u2013 was South African swimmer Chad Le Clos's father Bert, for his interview with Clare Balding. \"What a beautiful boy! I've died and gone to heaven.\"</p> <p>Gold: Bert Le Clos</p> <p>Silver: Lynn and Rick Raisman</p> <p>Bronze: Carol and David Hoy</p> <h2>Best pundit</h2> <p>The clear favourite going into the Games was Michael Johnson, who always manages to sound more intelligent and informed than anyone else around him. But while still far better than most others, Johnson has been a bit low on energy this time round and has sometimes appeared as if he wished he wasn't being asked to fill dead airtime with the same guff he said half an hour ago. The slow start by the US to the track and field events seemed to have made him grumpy. Mark Cavendish, meanwhile, was a revelation at the velodrome; funny, knowledgeable, honest and up for the craic. Ian Thorpe was always worth watching, if only for his costume changes.</p> <p>Gold: Mark Cavendish</p> <p>Silver: Michael Johnson</p> <p>Bronze: Ian Thorpe</p> <h2>Worst music</h2> <p>There can't be anyone left in the world who can bear to listen to Let Me Entertain You, We Will Rock You and We are the Champions ever again, such has been the frequency with which they are played during any lull in competition. And sometimes during it. Still, it was preferable to the Benny Hill theme tune that accompanied the women's beach volleyball. We didn't need reminding that it was a sport included primarily for the perve factor. It also encouraged the commentators to call all women athletes \"girls\". Not that they needed much encouraging. But the outright winner is Paul McCartney for his performances at the opening ceremony and in the velodrome.</p> <p>Gold: Sir Paul McCartney</p> <p>Silver: Benny Hill</p> <p>Bronze: Robbie Williams and Queen</p> <h2>Best self-publicist</h2> <p>From \"accidentally\" getting stuck on a zip wire, to being \"caught on camera\" at every venue, to muscling in on the political agenda - \"Everyone should do two hours sport a day at school like me. Look what it did for me.\" Hmm. Boris Johnson has effortlessly mastered the art of being in several locations at the same time and taking the credit for everything on offer. If you didn't get to a live event, it's because Bozza hogged your ticket.</p> <p>Gold: Boris Johnson</p> <p>Silver: Boris Johnson</p> <p>Bronze: Boris Johnson</p> <h2>Biggest sponsorship own goals</h2> <p>\"We are proud to only take Visa\" was written large over every Olympic retail outlet. Most visitors were totally underwhelmed to be massively inconvenienced and find that their non-Visa credit cards weren't accepted, and will now go out of their way to ensure they never use Visa again. I don't know how much Adidas paid \u2013 with Visa, presumably \u2013 to be an official sponsor, but it wasn't worth it. Everyone came away thinking that it was Nike's Games. And the sight of so many swimmers walking out in mirrored goggles with Dr Dre's clamped over their ears wasn't a great advert for the headphones.</p> <p>Gold: Visa</p> <p>Silver: Adidas</p> <p>Bronze: Dr Dre</p> <h2>Best crying</h2> <p>The toughest and most keenly fought event of the whole games was won by rowers Mark Hunter and Zac Purchase, after they were narrowly beaten into second place having led for most of the race. This sparked yet more tears from John \"Fingers\" Inverdale, who broke down himself after hugging them. For once Sir Chris Hoy didn't make it to the top of the podium, while Vicky Pendleton was disqualified \u2013 her third DQ of the Games \u2013 on the grounds that she's got \"magic tears\" that seldom stop flowing and therefore has an unfair advantage.</p> <p>Gold: Mark Hunter and Zac Purchase</p> <p>Silver: John \"Fingers\" Inverdale</p> <p>Bronze: Sir Chris Hoy</p>",
  "<p>The tiny homestead lies deep in the savanna, far from any road; tyre marks in the dirt offer the only trail. Nearby, a cow and a donkey drag a wooden plough in uneasy tandem. Looking on is Faisal Farah, who has receding short hair, two prominent yellowing front teeth \u2013 and a blue jacket that says \"Team GB\".</p> <p>On Saturday Faisal will walk four miles to Wajale, the nearest village with electricity, to watch his brother Mo race for a second Olympic gold.</p> <p>Their mother, Amran, who has remained in rural Somaliland despite Mo's success abroad, will be with him in the crowd around the TV, just as she was for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/aug/04/mo-farah-team-gb-olympic-medals\" title=\"\">the 10,000m final last weekend</a>.</p> <p>\"When he won, I exploded like a bomb!\" says Faisal, a farmer who, at 37, is eight years Mo's senior. \"I ran out in the streets shouting.</p> <p>\"There were a lot of people delighted and cheering. I celebrated and gave people gifts of khat [a bitter-tasting leaf] and meat.\"</p> <p>Mo will run for Britain in the 5,000m, but Somalis will be watching just as closely, claiming him as their local hero. The runner was born in Mogadishu, the capital of Somalia, and his family lives in the semi-autonomous Somaliland region, where Mo returns around once a year to widespread adulation. Locals speak admiringly of him visiting orphanages and refugee camps and setting up a charity. Faisal says Mo has built two houses for the family.</p> <p>Mo is the fourth of eight children, according to Faisal, who is the eldest. Faisal lives far off the beaten track, more than 40 miles from Hargeisa, close to the Ethiopian border and a world away from the lights and noise and logos of the Olympic stadium. Visitors are advised to travel with armed guards, following a road lined with abandoned petrol stations, trees customarily planted by newlyweds and a sign offering assurance that the area has been de-mined. The final part of the journey requires a Land Cruiser to bump and skid through bushy terrain and muddy quagmires.</p> <p>In the surrounding farmland are camels, cattle, donkeys, goats and lambs, crops such as cereal and watermelon, and small homesteads with dome-shaped dwellings fashioned from tarpaulins tied with rope. In one, a sickly boy can be seen with flies crawling over his face.</p> <p>Along the way, women in brightly coloured hijabs walk and wave, hoping for a lift.</p> <p>Faisal, who must trek to Wajale every time he wants to charge his phone, leans against a tractor and reminisces about looking out for his younger brother when they were growing up. \"Mo was always interested in sport: football and athletics,\" he says. \"He always ran in the streets as a child. He was very smiley and happy all the time.\"</p> <p>Despite Faisal's age advantage, Mo beat him at running. \"We played together, we walked together. We played football and sometimes we raced but he was faster than me. He was a dynamo.\"</p> <p>Watching Mo's Olympic glory in London, he feels no sibling rivalry, he insists. \"It is as if I myself am running, so I cannot be jealous of him.\"</p> <p>Their father was a businessman and the family lived comfortably in a substantial stone house. But Somalia was sliding towards two decades of civil war. \"In Mogadishu, everyone was militia,\" Faisal recalls.</p> <p>\"People in our neighbourhood died or were injured because, like us, they originally came from Somaliland. I remember gunfire and explosions, often targeted at us. I don't like it when the memories come back. I try not to remember.\"</p> <p>The family moved first to Somaliland, but conditions were harsh. \"We were refugees. We left our business and money. We were poor, living in a very small tent in a refugee camp. The country was destroyed and there was every problem, like lack of food and power. Luckily Mo was a healthy boy.\"</p> <p>They then sought relief in neighbouring Djibouti, while Mo's father returned to London, where he had been born and raised. Mo followed at the age of nine and joined his extended family in Hounslow, barely able to speak English. Faisal had no desire to follow.</p> <p>\"Mo went for better life, but I don't want to go there,\" he muses. \"I like the benefits of this country. Of course I miss my brother but he communicates by phone day and night. He tells me, 'If you starting training, maybe you will reach the Olympics one day!' When he comes back each year, we share a lot of stories.\"</p> <p>It is difficult for their parents to live continents apart, Faisal adds, \"but my mother doesn't want to go there. She doesn't like the city.\"</p> <p>Neither Faisal nor others here seem too troubled by Mo wearing adopted British colours. He continues: \"He's a Somali, whichever flag he holds, and he's my brother. He can be a double citizen. If he ran with the Somaliland flag it would be great, but he has British nationality so he must run with the British flag this time. We hope he will run all the way and be a famous man.\"</p> <p>Somaliland declared independence in 1991 but is still not internationally recognised as distinct from Somalia. Faisal says that, although he and Mo were born in Mogadishu, they still regard Somaliand as home. <a href=\"http://oodweynenews.com/news/107472-orodyahanka-caanka-ah-mo-farah-iyo-fanaanka-wayn-ee-sir-maxamuud-cumar-oo-maanta-ka-dhoofay-magaalada-london-iyagoo-kusii-jeeda-somaliland.html/attachment/great-britains-mo-farah-poses-with-a-so\" title=\"\">Mo has previously posed for photos with the tricolour of Somaliland</a>, not Somalia's flag of a white star on pale blue.</p> <p>Edna Adan Ismail, the former foreign minister of Somaliland, says: \"<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZZGqvE3FhA\" title=\"\">Mo Farah may have been born in Mogadishu, as were many Somalilanders</a> who happened to be working or living there during the time when Somaliland and Somalia were united, but he is not from Somalia. He is from Somaliland. He is from the Isaaq clan, and Jibril Abokor sub-clan, who are not natives of Somalia.</p> <p>Ismail, widow of the former prime minister and <a href=\"http://www.ednahospital.org\" title=\"\">founder of a university hospital</a>, adds: \"Somalilanders were elated and were greatly celebrating Mo's victory. Although he ran for Britain, he is one of ours and his achievements can only make us proud and can also be regarded as yet one more connection with the British empire.\"</p> <p>But south of here, in Mogadishu, Mo has plenty of fans who care little for politics but a great deal about hope. Unhappy the land in need of heroes \u2013 the line is apt. Although a combination of insecurity, poverty, Ramadan and a two-hour time difference means there will be few public gatherings to watch Saturday's race, it seems almost anyone with satellite TV at home will be tuned in.</p> <p>Among them is Amal Mohamed Bashir, 18, who watched the 10,000m with her mother and sisters and jumped to her feet when Farah clinched gold. \"It was a very big night for me because he has a Somali name and Somali origins,\" she says, wearing a headscarf, Real Madrid shirt and red and black skirt. \"Whichever country he runs for, he's still Somali.\"</p> <p>Bashir, a sprinter who says she was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/jul/04/road-to-london-2012-somalia\" title=\"\">denied a place in Somalia's two-person team in London</a> because of a bureaucratic mix-up, adds: \"I'm very proud of him; I'm one of his biggest fans. He has talent and capability and we are trying to follow in his footsteps. It gives us a power because he's Somali, he did it and won it. I can try to do it and win it. I hope to be like him.\"</p> <p>Earlier this week Bashir could be seen with 20 other young hopefuls pounding the dust of Mogadishu's battered and bruised Konis stadium.</p> <p>Goats clambered on the surrounding concrete terraces, makeshift tents for the displaced and destitute populated a nearby hill, and the smashed remains of a wall testified to two decades of anarchy.</p> <p>But Mo's achievements chime with a growing sense of optimism and possibility among Somalis returning from the diaspora as the bloodshed slowly declines. Jabril Ibrahim Abdulle, director of the <a href=\"http://www.crdsomalia.org\" title=\"\">Centre for Research and Dialogue</a>, says: \"We Somalis are running short of heroes to be honest with you. At the end of the day, he's the first ethnic Somali to win an Olympic gold.\"</p> <p>Asked whether Mo could inspire a new generation, Abdulle adds: \"It's a question of how much it's publicised. I don't see Somali kids taking it right now in the middle of Mogadishu and saying, 'I want to imitate Mo Farah', because of other issues. But of course if he comes here and gets a hero's welcome, that could change things.\"</p> <p>Mo's victory did create huge buzz among Somalis inside and outside the country using social media. There was no mistaking the symbolism.</p> <p>\"Tonight, the little giant rose to amazing heights,\" said one message that was rapidly circulated after the 10,000m. \"Tomorrow, we as a nation can do the same. After all, Farah is our own.\"</p>",

Nine of the top 15 slots on the list were taken by male authors, including King (who earned $39m thanks to the release of his doorstopper novel about the assassination of JFK, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/fiction/9781444727296/stephen-king\">11/22/63</a>), legal thriller writer John Grisham ($26m), Wimpy Kid author Jeff Kinney ($25m) and newcomer George RR Martin, who made $15m following <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0944947/\">the adaptation for television of his Song of Ice and Fire fantasy series</a>.</p> <p>The highest-ranking female writer on the list was Janet Evanovich, in third with earnings of $33m, but Forbes believes next year will present a very different picture. Not only will Suzanne Collins benefit from the full portion of the proceeds from <a href=\"http://www.thehungergamesmovie.com/index.html\">the first Hunger Games film</a>, and JK Rowling from the release of her first adult novel The Casual Vacancy this September, but <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/aug/07/erotic-book-fifty-shades-british-bestseller\">EL James' record-breaking earnings from the erotic Fifty Shades trilogy</a>, which sold 20 million copies in four months, will assure her \"a place near the top of next year's top authors list\", according to Forbes.</p> <p>\"At the height of Fifty Shades mania, the erotic novels were estimated to be generating as much as $1.3 million per week for their author, EL James. And that's not counting the $5 million she received from Universal Pictures and Focus Films for the theatrical rights,\" said the magazine, suggesting that perhaps Twilight author Stephenie Meyer, who made $14m last year, might deserve a cut as \"James's books originated as works of Twilight fan fiction\".</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/jeffbercovici/2012/08/09/women-on-the-rise-among-the-worlds-top-earnings-authors/\">The world's highest-paid authors, according to Forbes</a></h2> <p>James Patterson: $94 million</p> <p>Stephen King: $39 million</p> <p>Janet Evanovich: $33 million</p> <p>John Grisham: $26 million</p> <p>Jeff Kinney, $25 million</p> <p>Bill O'Reilly: $24 million</p> <p>Nora Roberts: $23 million</p> <p>Danielle Steel: $23 million</p> <p>Suzanne Collins: $20 million</p> <p>Dean Koontz: $19 million</p> <p>JK Rowling: $17 million</p> <p>George RR Martin: $15 million</p> <p>Stephenie Meyer: $14 million</p> <p>Ken Follett: $14 million</p> <p>Rick Riordan: $13 million</p>",
  "<p>OK, first things first - let's congratulate Sporting KC for winning the US Open Cup on Wednesday night ensuring a) that Seattle Sounders wouldn't win a record fourth successive trophy and b) that I didn't spend the evening squinting from the press box at indistinct AC Milan and Real Madrid players knocking the ball around somewhere in the distance at Yankee Stadium, but instead <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2012/aug/09/us-open-cup-2012-final-sporting-kansas-city-seattle-sounders\">spent it on a chair giving updates on the weather just outside Kansas City</a>. I care because you do. </p> <p><strong>Sporting KC</strong> are back in Eastern Conference action against <strong>DC United</strong> on Saturday night, while the <strong>Sounders</strong> face a tough test regrouping for a trip to <strong>San Jose</strong> the same evening (that'll be our live game this weekend). And speaking of regrouping, <strong>New York</strong> must try pick themselves up after their defeat at <strong>Houston</strong> last Friday night, to defend their unbeaten home record against the same opponents<em>this</em> Friday night. </p> <p>Normally a rivalry game between <strong>Columbus </strong>and <strong>Toronto</strong> would be guaranteed to come with some edge, but the game has been entirely overshadowed by the untimely death of Columbus midfielder Kirk Urso last week. There will be tributes for the player at the game. </p> <p><strong>FC Dallas </strong>look to have turned a little bit of a corner, while their opponents <strong>Colorado</strong>, will have been glad to turn the page of the calendar that said \"July\". They beat rival <strong>Real Salt Lake</strong> last week, after a winless previous month. Like Seattle, RSL don't have it easy as they try to get back on track - with a tricky away trip to <strong>Vancouver</strong> coming up. </p> <p>Three games on Sunday this week - <strong>Philadelphia Union</strong> face <strong>Chicago Fire</strong> in what could be a decent measure of relative progress for both sides, after decent second quarters of the season. Meanwhile <strong>New England</strong> face <strong>Montreal</strong> as the post-Shalrie Joseph era continues for the Revs, against the Impact and their Serie A veterans. Finally, the team Joseph went to, <strong>Chivas USA</strong>, \"host\" the final Superclasico of this year's three, against <strong>LA Galaxy</strong>, with the mini-series currently tied at one apiece.</p> <p>Some of our regular cast of fan reps, bloggers and beat writers are back to give a local perspective on each of the weekend's competing teams and their chances - see what they have to say and add your own predictions in the comments section. We'll be back on Monday, reflecting on the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/blog/2012/aug/06/seattle-sounders-los-angeles-galaxy-eddie-johnson\">Five Things we Learned this weekend</a>. In the meantime, join me for this weekend's live game, <strong>San Jose vs Seattle</strong>, and/or follow me on Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/KidWeil\">@KidWeil</a> for updates on that and other matters of grave import. </p> <p><em>All game times listed are EST</em></p> <h2>New York Red Bulls vs Houston Dynamo, Fri 8pm (NBCSN)</h2> <p><strong>Tim Hall</strong>, author of \"The view from 101\" for <a href=\"http://www.firsttouchonline.com\">First Touch</a>, New York:</p> <p>The Red Bulls had a chance last Friday to really establish a foothold atop the Eastern Conference if they could take three points from Houston Dynamo. Unfortunately, Hans Backe's men came out and delivered one of the most lackluster performances from any team this season. There was minimal creativity despite the addition of Tim Cahill to the lineup, and for the most part the Red Bulls seemed like they wanted to be anywhere else than in Texas that night. </p> <p>So on that Friday night, the Red Bulls surrendered the Eastern Conference lead to Houston, and must now settle for playing Houston for the Eastern Conference lead on Friday night. MLS scheduling logic, ladies and gentlemen! This time the Red Bulls are at home, where they, just like Houston, are undefeated on the season. Tim Cahill should be good for about 60 minutes in his proper home debut, but he and the rest of the proper attacking forces - Thierry Henry, Kenny Cooper and Sebastien Le Toux - will have to show they have the desire to play and win. A second consecutive loss against Houston, and New York can kiss almost any hope of a number one seed goodbye, and will instead be staring at an increasingly tight middle of the table. </p> <p><strong>Zach Woosley</strong>, <a href=\"http://www.dynamotheory.com/\">Dynamo Theory</a>, Houston:</p> <p>Nothing rhymes with orange...except WINNING. Not only did the Dynamo get to fire off El Capitan (the replica 18th century mountain howitzer cannon awarded to the winner of the season series between Houston and FC Dallas), they whooped the New York Red Bulls to take over first place in the Eastern Conference. Now, I know it's only August but the Dynamo are playing some stout soccer right now and there's no reason to believe that's going to change. The 4-3-3 formation is working to perfection and thanks to Jermaine Taylor being a genuine bad ***, the loss of Geoff Cameron is not causing the defense any problems.</p> <p>A second straight match with the Red Bulls, this time in New York...don't you just love MLS scheduling? This won't be easy, in fact it wouldn't surprise if the Red Bulls are able to get some revenge, especially with Dax McCarty back from suspension. Still, the Dynamo are playing great and I don't think there's any team that scares them at the moment, at least in the East. It should be a great game and I really think the Dynamo can get another win. Maybe I'm being greedy, but it's hard not to be confident about this team at the moment. That said, a draw would be perfectly fine with me. </p> <h2>Vancouver Whitecaps vs Real Salt Lake, Sat 7pm</h2> <p><strong>Brenton Walters</strong>, Communications Director, <a href=\"http://vancouversouthsiders.ca/\">Vancouver Southsiders</a>:</p> <p>The Whitecaps have had an extended break, which is probably good for the team, as they have to assimilate a few new players. Scottish internationals Barry Robson and Kenny Miller were excused from international duty so they could settle in with the team, and new defender Andy O'Brien and Brazilian midfielder Tiago Ulisses should get some time to train with the team, though don't look for either to start a game soon.&#xa0;</p> <p>Our last game was a tough 2-1 defeat to Real Salt Lake in Utah. The team played well, with Darren Mattocks impressing again and Robson showing his quality in the middle of the park again. We could have left Utah with something, but a couple of defensive mistakes gifted Real Salt Lake the victory. </p> <p>Saturday's game is a re-match against Real Salt Lake, a game we need to get something from if we're going to stay firmly in a play-off spot. We saw last game that we can compete with and even outplay the Western powerhouse team, especially in the middle of the park, so we'll head into the game hoping for a win. Our home form is stellar, our players are fit and rested, and Rennie has some depth on the bench if he needs it. Look for Bonjour and DeMerit to redeem themselves. Our entire team needs to play a solid 90 minutes, and we'll need something special (again) from our strike force. Maybe Miller to get his first goal in a Whitecaps shirt?&#xa0;</p> <p><strong>Denzel Eslinger</strong>, <a href=\"http://www.rslsoapbox.com/\">RSL Soapbox</a>:</p> <p>For Real Salt Lake there are 10 matches left in the MLS regular season. Their last 10 matches didn't show well with just a 4-5-1 record and that has a lot of people asking questions about how good this RSL side might be. &#xa0;Are they too old? Are they too comfortable as a team? Are they too slow? Too narrow? And all of those are valid questions for a team that has struggled for the last two months. Coming off their 1-0 loss at Colorado last weekend, RSL now has to head north of the border to take on the Vancouver Whitecaps, a team that they faced just a couple weeks ago at Rio Tinto Stadium. In that match RSL picked up a hard fought 2-1 win.</p> <p>That match ended with Joe Cannon being given a straight red card for handling the ball outside of the area, and since Vancouver has had the last two weeks off they should be well rested and ready to go without their number one keeper. For RSL it has been thousands of miles of travel to Costa Rica and then Colorado, now they have to try to find a way to beat a Whitecaps side that has only lost once at home this year and they have to do it without Jamison Olave, who is out with an injury. Mission Impossible? Nope, but it sure isn't going to be easy. RSL must find a way to force Vancouver to make mistakes and then capitalize on them, and that is easier said than done. I am picking a 2-2 draw in this one.</p> <h2>Columbus Crew vs Toronto FC, Sat 7.30pm</h2> <p><strong>Ben Hoelzel</strong>, <a href=\"http://crewunion.com\">Crew Union</a>, Columbus Crew:</p> <p>With the tragic, sudden, and still unexplained death of 22 year old rookie midfielder Kirk Urso Sunday morning, it may seem inappropriate to fret over and analyze something as seemingly meaningless as a game. There was even talk of postponing this weekend's match, but Coach Warzycha decided that Urso would \"want us to go on the field and win the game and play as hard as he did.\" As condolences and remembrances continue to funnel in, there is one common thread: Urso loved soccer. There can be few better ways to honor him than to pour ourselves into our own Saturday routines with all the dedication he showed, but now, with a much greater appreciation for how special each weekend is that we get to spend watching the sport we love with the people we love.</p> <p>Last week it was the same old Crew: agonizingly pitiful offense, Gruenebaum with more outstanding goalkeeping, good defense with one small mistake that leads to an unlucky goal (credit to D.C.'s Pontius, however, he has shown a great knack for goal this season), and the Crew drops another close one. </p> <p>This week sees old foe Toronto return to Columbus. The Crew won early this season 1-0 in Toronto. But, this isn't the same TFC team that lost its first nine games of the season. With a new coach and lots of new faces on the pitch, Toronto is much improved, but they're still struggling to play well in successive games. The Crew have also been inconsistent, which makes this game hard to call. The real question will probably be if heavy hearts make for heavy feet and clouded minds, or if tragedy will inspire victory? This week, I just have to believe in these guys. 2-1 for Kirk's friends in black and gold.</p> <p><strong>Duncan Fletcher</strong>, <a href=\"http://www.wakingthered.com/\">Waking the Red</a>, Toronto:</p> <p>Last week saw Toronto FC go into Chicago on the back of a 5-1 Concacaf Champions league win, and with new signing Eric Hassli making his debut up front. What happened was a bit of a let down. Hassli showed his class for sure, but didn't really touch the ball much as it was all Chicago, all the time. TFC actually took the lead when Ryan Johnson, capitalising on a misplaced backpass from Marco Pappa, scored while simultaneously slipping over. It was 1-0 at half time, but Chicago came back and after Logan Emory was sent off, and with Jeremy Hall off injured, Chicago added the insult by scoring the winner against the 9 men. It finished 2-1, a thoroughly deserved loss for TFC, very much killing off the faint playoff hopes that sprang from their earlier 3 game win streak.</p> <p>This week it's to Columbus, and as well as hopefully getting 90 minutes from Hassli, they'll (fitness permitting) be reinforced at the back by new signing Darren O'Dea, formerly of Celtic and most recently Leeds United. Given the Kirk Urso news, this should be a very emotional game, and how the Crew react could decide it really. Will they be motivated to win one for Kirk? Probably - in which case they'll have too much for TFC. Crew win 2-1. </p> <h2>Sporting Kansas City vs D.C. United, Sat 8.30pm </h2> <p><strong>Malena Barajas</strong>, co-founder, <a href=\"http://womenunitedfc.com/\">Women United FC</a>, Sporting Kansas City:</p> <p>Coming off the buzz from its US Open Cup win \u2013 and ending an eight year run without a trophy \u2013 Sporting KC will be one of two things in its upcoming match against DC United: fatigued or inspired. Sporting KC got the win after 129 minutes of play, but did not come away injury-free. Left back Seth Sinovic was assisted off the pitch due to what looked to be an ankle injury. This creates some instability for the SKC back line, with Collin out of play the last couple of matches and Chance Myers (who played all 129 minutes on Wednesday) just returning from injury. Even if the starting defenders hit the pitch Saturday, there is still the need for Vermes to be cautious. DC United's De Rosario will be a definite threat.</p> <p>In the midfield, Graham Zusi has looked unfocused and Roger Espinoza is back from the Olympics and looking good despite having virtually no rest. His compatriot at DC United, winger Andy Najar, has rested and could prove difficult for Sporting KC. On the upside, forward Teal Bunbury seems to be finding his form lately. With Bunbury, CJ Sapong and Kei Kamara up, there is a lot of opportunity for Sporting to score some goals. Sporting KC has won its past two matches against DC United and has kept four clean sheets in its past six matches in League competition. DC United has struggled to score on the road, but Sporting KC has struggled to score at home. This may be an evenly fought match for these two, but a necessary win for Sporting KC to keep its place at the top of the table. </p> <p><strong>Martin Shatzer</strong>, <a href=\"http://www.blackandredunited.com/\">Black and Red United</a>, DC:</p> <p>Saturday's 1-0 win over the Columbus Crew wasn't exactly a resounding one for D.C. United, but it was a win nonetheless. Following two road losses and an unbalanced schedule that gave United lots of time to wallow in their temporary slump, getting back on track was critical at RFK Stadium. United dominated possession for much of the match and had far better chances, but could only finish one of them. Chris Pontius got his 10th goal of the season in finishing off a great run from rookie Nick DeLeon to put D.C. on top. The return of Argentine center back Emiliano Dudar helped solidify the shutout for the home team.</p> <p>This weekend's match won't quite be as simple as United pays a visit to Sporting Kansas City for a big battle between talented teams that could determine playoff position in the Eastern Conference. The Sporks just played in the U.S. Open Cup Final on Wednesday night, so United may be catching them at a good time. Look for Pontius and Dwayne De Rosario to attack their tired legs endlessly and without regret.</p> <h2>FC Dallas vs Colorado Rapids, Sat 9pm</h2> <p><strong>Parrish Glover</strong>, <a href=\"http://the-inferno.net\">The Inferno</a>, Dallas:</p> <p>The feud between Brek Shea and Schellas Hyndman has come to an apparent end, with the young star returning to the starting lineup for this past weekend's game against Portland. The return paid dividends as well, with Shea setting up Scott Sealy for a 51st minute goal. Unfortunately, the Hoops also welcomed the return of the red card to our squad as well. Zach Loyd and Franck Songo'o had been locked in a fierce battle all game long, with Loyd picked up a second yellow card not long after the goal. The Dallas defense fought valiantly, but gave up an equalizer in the late stages. Two more squandered points in a season full of wasted opportunity.</p> <p>This weekend, we welcome the return of the Colorado Rapids to Frisco, Texas. The Rapids are the side that hosted the come-from-behind victory that snapped our three-month winless streak last month, and we relish the opportunity to rack up more points against the struggling Rapids. Loyd's red card suspension will mean more that the attack will need to compensate for a weakened back line. Fortunately, David Ferreira has quickly returned to his 2010 form captaining the midfield. He and Shea looked strong working together in Portland and supporters are hoping to see more of their collaboration on Saturday night.</p> <p><strong>Richard Bamber</strong>, COO, <a href=\"http://www.bulldogsupporters.com\">Bulldog Supporters Group</a>, Colorado Rapids:</p> <p>Last week the Rapids stopped the rot with a hard fought 1-0 win against Real Salt Lake, their first in 9 attempts. Rapids fans have to cast their minds back to May 2009 to recall the last win against their Rocky Mountain Cup rivals. The team played with the heart &amp; soul that fans love to see &amp; there really was no better team to bring the losing streak to an end. Because the victory was against RSL, it's almost as if it's worth 2 or 3 against other teams. They say the game is built on hope &amp; there is plenty of that around Denver at the moment; hope that the bad times are past, hope that we may just still be able to make a run for the play-offs.</p> <p>This weekend the Rapids have the task of travelling to hot &amp; dry Texas to face an FC Dallas team that they know they can beat. MLS Cup 2010 references aside, two sendings off for Dallas in the first away game back in May allowed the Rapids to come away with a 2-0 away although at a cost of a nasty ankle injury to Omar Cummings. Omar is back however Conor Casey is a concern having missed training today, presumably due to the same hamstring problem that's kept him out for the last few weeks. We should go for the win, however a draw would keep the feelings of hope alive for us.</p> <h2>San Jose Earthquakes vs Seattle Sounders, Sat 10.30pm</h2> <p><strong>GUARDIAN LIVE GAME</strong></p> <p><strong>\"Nerdy Gales\"</strong>, <a href=\"http://www.centerlinesoccer.com/\">Center Line Soccer</a>, San Jose:</p> <p>Before facing the Chicago Fire a fortnight ago, Steven Lenhart Wig Night led to a degree of levity for the pre-game team lineup picture and a surreal Harpo Marx ambiance in the stadium. Spectacular saves throughout the game by Chicago goalkeeper Sean Johnson, continually defied the determined efforts of the Earthquakes offense. With extra-time running out after 98 minutes (yes, 98), Lenny pounced on the ball for the latest of late equalizers - the newly hirsute crowd wigged out, and it was blonde-haired bedlam at Buck Shaw. Shea Salinas donned a fan's fake curls leaving the referee stuttering in his wake, uncertain as to whether his celebration was a bookable offence. <br> The more restrained friendly against Swansea City FC ended in another tie: 2-2, and was our first opportunity to see Mehdi Ballouchy, the curly haired midfielder recently acquired from NYRB - a Ballouchy Wig Night is surely on the cards. After a bye in Week 22, the Earthquakes remain at home for this weekend's match up with Seattle. Despite the cup loss, Seattle are not in Kansas anymore and are coming off a 4-0 romp over the LA Galaxy in MLS play, and will present a tough challenge for the Quakes to keep their home streak alive. The Earthquakes squad are rested, Ballouchy is up to speed, and the synthetic Seattle bounce is absent from the lush green grass of Buck Shaw \u2013 I believe the Quakes will remain unbeaten at home. </p> <p><strong>Sam Chesneau</strong>, <a href=\"http://www.gorillafc.com/\">Gorilla FC</a>, Seattle:</p> <p>What a week for Sounders FC. To have such high emotional confidence following a 4-0 destruction of the Los Angeles Galaxy in front of close to 61,000, to a belly blow of losing the US Open Cup final in penalties. We saw a tale of two teams. The first MLS match, a managing clinic by Schmid, made for a deflated Galaxy squad left with no answers and nothing but excuses post match. It was amazing. You couldn't ask for a better way to go into a cup final than Sunday night's contest at the Clink. </p> <p>Then Sporting Kansas City happened. A team that always seems to bring out the worst play in our squad, reminiscent of the Houston Dynamo teams of the latter part of the previous decade. Ugly physical brutish soccer that results in bodies flying everywhere and tempers lost. At the end of the day, the Sounders can place the blame on referee Ricardo Salazar all they want, <a href=\"http://imgur.com/iLwbm\">maybe justifiably</a>, but missing 3 penalty kicks in a row does not win you hardware.</p> <p>This Saturday's match against the San Jose Earthquakes will mark the 3rd game in 6 days, the latter two being on the road. It will be asking a lot to think the Sounders can come away with 3 points after the 210 minutes played within a 4 day period, so to come away with a point on the road would be acceptable. However this was a team built to be competitive on multiple fronts, so hopefully we'll see a little more of the newly acquired players, Christian Tiffert and Mario Martinez. How will the team will respond to Wednesday night's final? This Saturday will put this year's team character on full display.</p> <h2>New England Revolution vs Montreal Impact, Sun 7pm</h2> <p><strong>Julie Kumor</strong>, <a href=\"http://www.midnightriders.com/\">Midnight Riders</a>:</p> <p>Another week, another frustrating result with more frustrating play.&#xa0;I thought given the results of the past couple weeks, plus being at home, that the Revs were going to come out a blazing, and instead they looked frustrated.&#xa0;Maybe the emotional toll of trading Shalrie was too much for the team this week?&#xa0;Shalrie hadn't played the past few games, so they shouldn't have been missing his presence on the field, so it is possible he had much bigger impact off the field than the team realized.</p> <p>There were moments in the game that I couldn't understand why they weren't passing the ball to players that were clearly open, instead they were trying to dribble the ball into the goal.&#xa0;I got the feeling that the trust level among the players is at a new low - or everyone wanted to be the hero.&#xa0;Since there is so little positive about this game, I look forward to Sunday against Montreal - news from the front office is that our newest DP Jerry Bengtson will be back from the Olympics to play.&#xa0;His Olympic play was a confusing thing to cheer for - on one hand you want to see him do well (and he did) on the other you want him back on the field playing well for the Revs. </p> <p>Trading Shalrie, dumping the much touted number 9 Moreno, and Bengtson's play at the Olympics - in summary there was more interesting things happening off the field then on the field versus KC.&#xa0;Against Montreal, I think they will figure it out as long as Bengtson plays. 2-1 Revs.</p> <p><strong>Sofiane Benzaza</strong>, <a href=\"http://www.mountroyalsoccer.com\">Mount Royal Soccer</a>, Montreal:</p> <p>The Montreal Impact repeated an important feat for the second time in its MLS season: back-to-back MLS wins. The momentum from the win vs the New York Red Bulls followed the team, as the Impact took on the Philadelphia Union. The new ''3-5-2'' for Montreal saw Nesta, Rivas and Ferrari line up against a young, dynamic Union team. With Marco Di Vaio absent, Andrew Wenger took over and scored off a corner-kick before the end of the first half. The game as a whole was not the most exciting but the Impact took care of business. Felipe scored on a scissor kick to seal the deal, probably one of the top goals I have seen in MLS this season.</p> <p>This Sunday, the Impact take on another patriotic-themed team, the New England Revolution. 5 points behind the Chicago Fire, Montreal cannot afford not-to-win even if the game is away at Gillette Stadium. The Revolution is another young team but has stronger offensive assets than the Union. Last time both teams played, the Impact took a win at home but it was not easy, with Nguyen and Sene always dangerous in different situations.</p> <p>It will be an interesting test for newly-acquired (goalkeeper swap with the Timbers) Troy Perkins who should face the Revolution on Sunday.</p> <h2>Philadelphia Union vs Chicago Fire, 7pm (Galavision)</h2> <p><strong>Scott Kessler</strong>, Managing Editor, <a href=\"http://www.brotherlygame.com\">The Brotherly Game</a>, Philadelphia:</p> <p>Saturday was a disappoint for the Philadelphia Union, to say the least. After flying high for most of John Hackworth's time as interim head coach, the Union came crashing down against the Montreal Impact. A poor performance sent Philadelphia home with a 2-0 loss and an even harder time attempting to force itself back into the playoff race. There was little to take away from the game for the Union, leaving them with only a chance at redemption against the Chicago Fire, on Sunday, as a way to forget about the defeat.</p> <p>The main story line heading into Saturday has revolved around Bakary Soumare. The tall center back holds the potential to drastically change the Union's entire season, but questions have been posed as to whether or not he's ready to play after knee surgery in March. If Soumare does play on Sunday, his debut would come against his former team, the Fire, and most likely come in place of captain Carlos Valdes, who may be traveling to join up with the Colombian national team.</p> <p>If Valdes is away, Soumare's inclusion in the starting lineup would provide Philadelphia with its strongest option, given that Porfirio Lopez or Chris Albright remain the only backups at center back otherwise.</p> <p>Prediction: 1-1. A goal from Josue Martinez, given the start in place of McInerney, who was suspended for his reaction to Nelson Rivas' headbutt of Antoine Hoppenot, brings the Union even, and neither team can do much else.</p> <p><strong>Stephen Piggott</strong>, <a href=\"http://www.hottimeinoldtown.com/\">Hot Time in Old Town</a>, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/whiskeybrothers05\">Whiskey Brothers Aught Five</a>, Chicago:</p> <p>Seconds after Marco Pappa's errant back pass, the Fire went down 1 nil at home last week to Toronto. If that happened last year, heads would've dropped and confidence levels plummeted. But this is 2012 and Chicago Fire is a completely different animal. Even though they were trailing 1-0 at halftime, I knew they would come back and win - the players did too; turning it around courtesy of a brilliant header by rookie-of-the-year candidate Austin Berry late in the match. Fernandez had a great, though injury-shortened, debut and Frank Klopas also showed his coaching maturity, taking off the lackluster Oduro at halftime and replacing him with DP Sherjill MacDonald, who had an excellent second half. Nyarko also came in for the injured Fernandez and continued his brilliant form.</p> <p>Philly poses a somewhat different threat for the Fire this Sunday. I expect a very similar lineup to the one against TFC with the only change perhaps being up top, where MacDonald is much better suited to holding the ball up than Oduro. Philly may give a debut to former Fire defender Bakary Soumare which would be a bold move considering that Philly's center back pairing of Okugo and Valdes have played well recently and Soumare hasn't played a first team game in several months. His inclusion could be a positive for the Fire who could exploit the potential new center back partnership. Freddy Adu has had a quiet few games for Philly and the Fire will look to continue that trend Sunday night. The team is on a good run and picking up three away points should be the goal. 2-1 Fire with goals from MacDonald and Rolfe.</p> <h2>Chivas USA vs LA Galaxy, Sun 11pm (ESPN2, ESPND)</h2> <p><strong>Alicia Ratterree</strong>, <a href=\"http://www.thegoatparade.com/\">The Goat Parade</a>, Chivas USA:</p> <p>Last week, Chivas USA were on a bye, which was a little unfortunate as they were coming off a 1-0 win the previous week against the Portland Timbers in Portland. That victory resulted in a season sweep of the Timbers, which is a nice accomplishment, but Chivas have considerable work to do over the rest of the season if they want to make the playoffs in 2012. One factor that may help is the arrival of midfielder Shalrie Joseph, who was traded from the New England Revolution last week. Considering the weaknesses in midfield and the problems the team has had in providing quality service to the attackers, it is hoped that Joseph can provide an instant upgrade.</p> <p>The Goats return to action Sunday against the LA Galaxy in the third edition of the 2012 SuperClasico. Each team has taken a game in the series this season, and Los Angeles bragging rights are on the line. In addition, the match has larger implications, as Chivas are chasing the Galaxy for the final playoff spot. As a result, this is one of those proverbial \"six-pointers\" that could prove crucial to Chivas' playoff hopes at this stage of the season. If they can play Sunday with a stout defense and some attacking creativity, they have a good chance to win the game.</p> <p><strong>Josie Becker</strong>, Editor, <a href=\"http://www.lagconfidential.com\">LAG Confidential</a>, Los Angeles:</p> <p>Last week was atrocious for the Galaxy, which is a shame because their form in July was excellent. Defending became an afterthought as the Seattle Sounders seemed able to score at will. Looking back, it's sort of amazing that a back line featuring a rookie, a player still rehabbing from injury, and a player who isn't very good, took this long to have just an absolute stinker. Still, the Galaxy as of late have at least been able to score goals over their stinkers. LA never looked threatening, never recovered from giving up a goal in the first five minutes. </p> <p>Now this week the Galaxy face the rubber match of this year's SuperClasico series. LA last played Chivas three times in a season back in 2009, when teams played a double round robin and then two extra matches against two regional rivals. Chivas went goalless in three that year - so far this year they've managed one goal from a penalty. With Chivas scoring only 14 goals thus far this year, the story is simple. Either the Galaxy score goals and win, or don't and lose. The possibility for an all out shoot out from these two clubs is minuscule. </p> <p>It's unlikely the Galaxy DP trio has it in them to contribute as little as they did in Seattle for a second straight week.</p>",
  "<h2>Sight lines</h2> <p>Which are the best and worst festival venues for seeing theatre? A comment under today's review of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/2012/aug/09/after-the-rainfall-review?newsfeed=true\">After the Rainfall</a> from someone who sat at the back of the venue in Pleasance Dome and was rewarded by seeing almost nothing is a reminder that, beyond the Traverse, very little work on the fringe is seen in ideal conditions. It's often one of the reasons why new writing in particular fares badly on the fringe, although the two plays I've seen so far in the <a href=\"http://https://www.underbelly.co.uk/new-voices-edinburgh-2012 \">Old Vic New Voices season</a> at Underbelly \u2013 B*tch Boxer and One Hour Only (both in Big Belly) \u2013 suggest that when the writing is strong and the design simple you can pull it off.</p> <p>I'd like to hear your tips for Edinburgh's best and worst venues. I've been telling people who are going to see <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/2012/aug/08/mies-julie-edinburgh-review?newsfeed=true\">Mies Julie</a> at <a href=\"http://www.assemblyfestival.com\">Assembly Hall</a> on the Mound that it is well worth getting to the venue early and queuing to get a seat near the front, and quite frankly I'd prefer never to see another theatre show in the <a href=\"http://www.arfringe.com\">Assembly Rooms</a> Ballroom, although the dynamic is fine for comedy. The demonstration room at <a href=\"http://www.summerhall.co.uk\">Summerhall</a> (where I saw the powerful and heartfelt We Are Chechens! and The Shit) is hugely atmospheric, but the acoustics are poor, and in Pleasance Two sound from the courtyard frequently drifts across the stage, a problem that affects many venues. It's been a good decision by <a href=\"http://www.northernstage.co.uk\">Northern Stage at St Stephens</a> to steer clear of the main church space, which even in its Aurora Nova glory days presented enormous difficulties for artists and audiences.</p> <p>The difficulties of venues have always made me wonder why more artists don't take their shows outside and use the natural beauty of Edinburgh as backdrop. Of course that's exactly what the Edinburgh international festival is doing with <a href=\"http://www.eif.co.uk\">NVA's Speed of Light</a>, which nightly takes 850 people up <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur%27s_Seat,_Edinburgh\">Arthur's Seat</a> in the dark. I'd like to have seen the health and safety report on that. </p> <h2>Bad behavior</h2> <p>Talking of Speed of Light brings us on to bad behavior in the theatre, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/2012/may/08/the-new-cultural-rules-audience\">a subject we have often covered</a>. At least standing up and shouting \"rubbish\", as <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/stage/2012/aug/09/orla-o-loughlin-edinburgh-festival?newsfeed=true \">happened at a performance of Morning</a> at the Traverse earlier this week, shows some kind of engagement. It was less obvious on Thursday night on Arthur's Seat, where NVA's participatory artwork was taking place, as it will for the rest of the month. In the briefing before we set off, people were asked not to talk too much and keep their voices low, not to take photographs and to turn off their mobile phones. What happened? People talked incessantly all the way up and down the mountain, took photos and called their friends on their mobiles: \"Hey, you'll never guess, it's 11pm and I'm on Arthur's Seat.\" Whoopee! </p> <h2>Quote of the day</h2> <p>Accusing, weary man to girlfriend in the Underbelly bar: \"OK, I'll come and see another show, but not if we have to queue again to buy the tickets and to get into the show. You said doing the fringe would be fun, but I'm beginning feel like a pre-glasnost East German during a food shortage.\"</p> <h2>What to see: my weekly theatre tips</h2> <p>Right, it's an abbreviated What to see this week because the focus is very much on Edinburgh, where the <a href=\"http:// www.eif.co.uk \">international festival</a> opens tomorrow. Shows this week include Grzegorz Jarzyna's 2008: Macbeth which is set in a Middle East state, and Christoph Marthaler's My Fair Lady-inspired Meine faire Dame, about linguistic confusion. On the fringe, my recommendations so far are: Mies Julie at Assembly Mound; Knee Deep at Assembly George Square; Caesarian Section \u2013 Essays on Suicide and The Shit at Summerhall; Bullet Catch, Blink, Morning and Bravo Figaro! at the Traverse; The Curious Scrapbook of Josephine Bean and The Ballad of Pondlife McGurk at the Scottish Book Trust; I Heart Peterborough at Pleasance Courtyard; The Price of Everything, The Ugly Sisters and Oh, the Humanity (I saw this prior to the festival) at Northern Stage at St Stephens; One Hour Only and B*tch Boxer at Underbelly.

  "<p>The problem with the so-called golden era of US television is that even the most TV-obsessed among us can't possibly hope to watch every show out there.

  "<p>Shahkeel Miah is looking for Bangladesh. He is on a lunch break from his job as a security guard at the Olympic Park, and has wandered down to Orbit Circus, the public space next to Anish Kapoor's giant structure, clasping in his hand a small and unremarkable enamel lapel pin.</p> <p>Sitting at a round picnic table with his wares arrayed like trophies in front of him, Stavros Potouridis has got Bangladesh. More accurately, among the thousands of badges displayed on trays on the table, placed in bags at his feet or pinned proudly to his jacket, he has at least one lapel pin of the Bangladeshi flag topped by the Olympic rings. He dips deep in his bag and picks it out, holding it in front of the security guard like a sweet treat to a child.</p> <p>But Potouridis takes a quick look and sniffs at the badge in Miah's paw, the only one he has. The Greek wants the Coca-Cola pin of the day, and there's no way a plain little London 2012 badge is worth the swap. \"Try one of the other guys!\" he calls, as Miah wanders off.</p> <p>Less than a fortnight after a strange new city sprang up in east London, the Olympic Park has developed a curious but frenzied new barter economy, its currency being the pin badge. Those popping in to watch the sideshow that is the sporting action may be unaware of it, but for many of those working on the site the trade in badges is a newfound hobby that is fast becoming an obsession.</p> <p>Displayed on the lanyards of their Olympic accreditation badges, many staff \u2013 from security guards to journalists, and Games Maker volunteers to sponsors' employees \u2013 have taken to brandishing their small, multicoloured pins like medals. They are a way of signalling your experience of previous Games and a medium for striking up conversation with complete strangers.</p> <p>\"I'd never heard of it and when we first noticed it, we were like, that's so immature,\" says Sophie, who escorts guests around the site for sponsors Visa and has carried her large branded lollipop sign to the badge trading area. \"Now we love it. I think everyone who is working on the site is getting really into it.\"</p> <p>She and her colleagues were given a pin by Visa at the outset, giving them an immediate head start over other collectors as pins produced internally by broadcasters and sponsors rather than sold in bulk are among the most desirable. Articulated badges with moving parts are also eagerly sought \u2013 a Dow pin with an arrow pointing to the changing British weather is a favourite. Badges traded with athletes are, for obvious reasons, like gold dust.</p> <p>Pin trading, it turns out, is almost as old as the Games itself, having started in 1896 when athletes began exchanging the coloured cardboard discs used to distinguish them from officials and media. Participating bodies increasingly produced badges throughout the last century, and collecting them grew into a frenzied hobby, particularly in the US. At the Los Angeles Games in 1984, 10,000 people a day attended a makeshift barter market outside the LA Coliseum.</p> <p>Perhaps inevitably, at the Calgary Winter Games four years later, official pin trading centres run and branded by Coca-Cola were opened inside the Olympic parks themselves. The centre in Stratford, east London, has a number of indoor tables for officially sanctioned traders, and rather more outside, in the main park plaza, where unofficial traders set up their wares. \"If you go inside and run in their booth you have to run by their rules,\" tuts Paul Hess, a dairy farmer from New York state who got into pins when his wife worked at the Atlanta 1996 Games and has been trading ever since.</p> <p>Coca-Cola have made 182 pin badges for London 2012 \u2013 red phone boxes that flip open to read \"Welcome to the Olympics\" in 12 languages, London monuments made of Coke bottles, opening and closing ceremony pins, bulldogs in union flag wellies \u2013 for which it is charging between \u00a38 and \u00a320. Inside the store, as some sought to make frantic trades, other Olympic ticket holders wandered around bemused at the curious pastime. \"Bit odd, isn't it?\" laughed one woman, who had popped in with her husband to take a look. \"We've never heard of anything like it.\"</p> <p>For those for whom this is the most serious sport of the Games, there are clear rules. Don't wear a pin you don't want to trade, or wear it separately. If you make a bad trade and get an unofficial pin, discard it rather than trade it on. And ideally \u2013 though quite how this works on a large scale is never fully explained \u2013 don't buy pins, just trade or accept them as gifts.</p> <p>The badges do, undoubtedly, have some monetary value \u2013 there were rumours among workers last week that a BBC pin was changing hands for \u00a3100 \u2013 but the market moves quickly and can be transitory. In any case, the serious collectors agree, where would be the fun if you just bought them all?</p> <p>Sid Marantz from Los Angeles, who has been trading since Montreal in 1976, says he has exchanged pins with Prince Albert of Monaco and Usain Bolt. \"And I just traded with two kids of seven or eight years old. I took their pins that were not valuable, but it was worth it to see the excitement of them starting out as collectors.\"</p> <p>For Marantz, who estimates that up to 4,000 different pins will be produced for each Games, the holy grail is to bag every one produced by each of the competing Olympic committee at the London Games. \"From 200 or so countries, you could have maybe 600 to 700 pins, and I would try to get all of them. At every Games I have ever been to I have tried, and I'm one of the best. But nobody ever does.\"</p>",

Crowded, late and plagued with chewing gum-abandoning teens, they are rarely the subject of mirth. However, David Cerny's \"London Booster\" sculpture \u2013 a 1957 Routemaster which does push-ups while groaning \u2013 has raised a big, transport-related smile from the capital's commuters during the Olympics.</p> <p>Situated outside the Czech HQ in Islington, the wheezing, working-out vehicle is one of many tongue-in-cheek installations from the Prague-born artist. A rebellious mix of Antony Gormley and Damien Hirst, the enfant terrible is as controversial as he is amusing. In 2009, he was supposed to collaborate with 26 artists on a piece promoting the EU. Instead, he faked the names of the other sculptors and made the giant collage himself, perpetuating crude stereotypes of its member states: Bulgaria was shown as a squat toilet; Italy was a football pitch of masturbating footballers.</p> <p>Subtlety might not be his strong point, but his larger-than-life social comment pieces are certainly intriguing. Many of his most famous creations lurk tantalisingly in Prague's historic crevices, providing a refreshing and quirky way to explore the capital's centre.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-394505615\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/pictures/2012/8/10/1344590180531/Horse-statue-by-David-Cer-008.jpg\" alt=\"Horse statue by David Cerny in Prague\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Horse statue by David Cerny in Lucerna Pasaz.

Here, you will find 'Horse' \u2013 a dark, bastardised version of the imposing kingly statue situated in the square behind you. Hanging, Damocles-like, from a lime-tiled dome ceiling sits Wenceslas, astride his now dead, upside-down steed. Though Cerny never comments publicly on his work, the piece is seen to be a damning attack on current Czech President, V\u00e1clav Klaus \u2013 a frequent subject for Cerny derision.</p> <p>Next, head down Spalena towards Old Town Square. When you reach <a href=\"http://www.umedvidku.cz/\" title=\"\">U Medvidku beer hall</a> on Na Perstyne, look up. In the distance, a diminutive, Colonel Sanders-esque figure dangles suicidally from a rooftop. This tiny, bearded figure of \"Hanging Out\" is, in fact, Sigmund Freud, casually swinging from a beam with his hand in his pocket. Created in 1997, it is Cerny's ambiguous response to the question of what role the intellectual would play in the new millennium; an absorbing sight regularly missed by tourists watching their footing on the cobbles.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-394505616\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/pictures/2012/8/10/1344590321732/The-Piss-Sculpture-by-Dav-008.jpg\" alt=\"The Piss Sculpture by David Cerny, Prague\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Piss Sculpture in front of the Franz Kafka museum.

This post-Velvet Revolution sculpture, a fibreglass Trabant car on four, giant tree-trunk legs, is a tribute to the 4,000 East German asylum seekers who, in 1989, stationed themselves here until they were granted political asylum back into West Germany. Many left their Trabants behind, hence Cerny's choice of motor.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-394505617\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/pictures/2012/8/10/1344590228960/David-Cerny-crawling-baby-008.jpg\" alt=\"David Cerny crawling baby on the \u008ei\u009ekov Television Tower in Prague\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Crawling baby on the Zizkov TV Tower.

Weave through the underground vaults to the tiny garden at the back to find it \u2013 two giant pairs of legs bent over and moulded into the wall. Viewers are invited to climb up the ladders and stare into the fibreglass anus. Inside, a video of Cerny's old adversary President Klaus is shown, in which he and the Head of the National Gallery are spoon-feeding each other slop to the sound of Queen's \"We Are The Champions\". Crude, unsubtle, comical, it is yet another example of Cerny's displeasure with post-revolution democracy; the fates of the Czech people, he feels, rest uneasily in the dictatorial, money-grabbing hands of inept politicians.</p> <p>A fitting, relaxing, antidote to the day's walking would be to catch a band at Cerny's very own club, <a href=\"http://meetfactory.cz/\" title=\"\">Meet Factory</a> (Ke sklarne 15). Part music venue, part gallery, it is a converted glass warehouse in the Smichov district, with two melted red cars nonchalantly hanging on pegs outside (\"Meat\"). The club regularly hosts electro and indie, and you can regularly find the floppy-haired man in question, David Cerny, beer in hand, enjoying the bands.</p> <p><em>\u2022 EasyJet (<a href=\"http://www.easyjet.co.uk\">easyjet.co.uk</a>) flies to Prague from London Gatwick from \u00a352 return</em></p>",
  "<h2>Barnsley </h2> <p><strong>Story of the summer </strong>Jacob Butterfield departed Oakwell for the lure of Premier League football. Another notable departure was that of veteran striker Andy Gray. Jay McEveley, Alastair Taylor, David Cotterill, David Preece and Nathan Doyle all left the club after a season on the fringes of the squad last time out. Reds manager Keith Hill loves his broken toys. Polish midfielder Tomasz Cywka finds himself under his wing now. He was described by his former manager Nigel Clough as \"an inexperienced and not very bright footballer\" \u2013 it's time for Hill to work his Vaz Te magic again. Returning to the club is Jacob Mellis on a two-year contract. Goalkeeper Ben Alnwick has joined on a free transfer. Fans will have to wait until November to see \"marquee signing\" Mido make his first competitive start for Barnsley, after he suffered a serious hamstring rupture in pre-season. Fans are already questioning his fitness to compete in the Championship this season.</p> <p><strong>What the fans want </strong>An inspired billionaire to become club benefactor. To be rid of the tag of being perennial strugglers. To have a squad that is competing and demonstrating a capacity to develop even further in the Championship.</p> <p><strong>What they'll actually get </strong>Proper skintage. Periods of abject misery, punctuated by thrills, spills and derby victories. A paltry 30 seconds worth of coverage on the Football League Show each weekend. More players sold for a fiver and a bag of wine gums. But, maximum effort and honesty from Keith Hill throughout.</p> <p><strong>One to watch </strong>Paul Digby, another product of our academy, will start to establish himself this season in midfield.</p> <p><strong>We'll finish </strong>Top half of the bottom half, somewhere between 13th and 18th.</p> <p><strong>Ian Wilkinson, </strong><a href=\"http://www.onthepontyend.com/\" title=\"\"><strong>On The Ponty End</strong></a><strong> (</strong><a href=\"http://twitter.com/#!/OnThePontyEnd\" title=\"\"><strong>@onthepontyend</strong></a><strong>) </strong></p> <h2>Birmingham City </h2> <p><strong>Story of the summer </strong>It's been a summer of change; a new management team and changes at board level have contributed to lots of talk about what will happen next. However, the transfer embargo has now been lifted and things appear to be returning to something approaching normality at St Andrews. Personnel-wise whilst a few have left the club they were in the main fringe players and as such the spine of the team remains the same. A couple more loan deals and Blues will have a team that really could compete in the top reaches of the Championship.</p> <p><strong>What the fans want </strong>A continuation of some of the exciting football of last year will satisfy many, although I think now that the expectation to go one step further and get promotion this season is also on the menu.</p> <p><strong>What they'll actually get</strong> Judging by what I've seen in pre-season there is a good chance that they will get what they want. Lee Clark seems to have understood that the team played well last year and the strong points within the team are still there \u2013 so he's not changed much, just added to it.</p> <p><strong>One to watch</strong> Obvious I know, but third-choice England and first-choice Team GB keeper Jack Butland has the No1 shirt and everyone expects him to be the bright new thing this year. However, my personal tip is young American defender/midfielder Will Packwood who has had an impressive pre-season.</p> <p><strong>We'll finish \u2026</strong> I'm loathe to jinx this so I'm going to be deliberately vague; provided we keep the squad we have together, we keep injuries and suspensions to a workable level and the effects from Carson Yeung's impending trial etc don't affect us too much then we'll be there or thereabouts come May.</p> <p><strong>almajir, </strong><a href=\"http://www.oftenpartisan.co.uk/\" title=\"\"><strong>oftenpartisan.co.uk</strong></a><strong> (</strong><a href=\"http://twitter.com/#!/often_partisan\" title=\"\"><strong>@often_partisan</strong></a><strong>) </strong></p> <h2>Blackburn Rovers </h2> <p><strong>Story of the summer</strong> It's actually been, shock of all horrors, quite a productive summer at Blackburn Rovers after suffering relegation last time out. In have come Danny Murphy, Leon Best (injured already), Nuno Gomes, F\u00e1bio Nunes, Edinho Junior and Paulo Jorge, with Dickson Etuhu looking likely to follow. Out have gone Yakubu and Junior Hoilett \u2013 no Mr Kean, he's not signing a new deal in 48 hours, join the rest of us in the real world. On the whole this is probably about as much as we could have realistically asked for given the previous penny pinching behaviour of the owners Venky's and it does give us a shot at a swift return to the promised land of the Premier League.</p> <p><strong>What the fans want </strong>Ideally first and foremost promotion coupled with the complete turning around of a proverbial ship that has been sinking for the best part of 18 months. For fans to unite instead of bickering constantly, for the owners to actually talk to the fans and if we're being picky \u2026 a new manager please.</p> <p><strong>What they'll actually get</strong> An underachievement on what is actually possible given the potential of a very strong squad in relative Championship terms. We'll be good at times, we'll concede goals for fun at times and you know who (manager, Scottish, likes excuses) will spend all season trying to find things other than himself and the owners to blame for defeats.</p> <p><strong>One to watch </strong>Look out for new signing F\u00e1bio Nunes who raised a merited \"WHO?\" upon being signed this summer but has looked like a star in the making out on the wing in pre-season, Also a quick glance towards youth academy prospect Adam Henley wouldn't hurt the eyes.</p> <p><strong>We'll finish \u2026 </strong>I shall say fifth and in a play-off spot. Contrary to the doom merchants predictions I can't see Salesman Steve lasting this season if he gets off to a less than stellar start. The playing staff will be too strong for the division at times so I expect bare minimum a top-six finish.</p> <p><strong>Mike Delap </strong><a href=\"http://www.thewildblackburnrover.com/\" title=\"\">The Wild Blackburn Rover </a></p> <h2>Blackpool </h2> <p><strong>Story of the summer</strong> It's been a quiet summer with only four players coming in up to now. No doubt there will be a few more players to come in before the deadline, probably forwards. On the way out are Bloomfield Road legends Brett Ormerod and Keith Southern leaving memories that will stay with the faithful for a lifetime. The former moving in to the end of his career with Wrexham, whilst the latter has sealed a move to Huddersfield which makes sense for all parties. From a playing perspective the side had started to evolve a little towards the end of last season and that should continue in terms of team shape whilst the style will remain as attacking as ever. Unless something changes in the next few weeks, the defence will remain a relative weakness.</p> <p><strong>What the fans want </strong>The greatest optimists would love to see the chairman lose his crushing rationality and sanction a whole host of big money signings to embellish the team that finished last season strongly. Before going on to emulate Reading's achievements last season and winning the title with games to spare.</p> <p><strong>What they'll actually get </strong>Most rational fans would love a repeat of last season, but the Championship is a very different beast this year. Lots of money and changes at other clubs means that the league is as wide open as ever. 'Pool will start slowly, picking up momentum as loan signings boost the playing squad injecting vigour during the stagnant winter months.</p> <p><strong>One to watch </strong>At the end of last season Angel Martinez broke through, this time around his Iberian team mate Tiago Gomes may well steal the headlines with his attacking talent.</p> <p><strong>We'll finish \u2026</strong> fifth.</p> <p><strong>John Kane, </strong><a href=\"http://www.tangerinedreaming.com\" title=\"\"><strong>Tangerine Dreaming</strong></a><strong> (</strong><a href=\"http://twitter.com/#!/tanger_dreaming\" title=\"\"><strong>@Tanger_Dreaming</strong></a><strong>)</strong></p> <h2>Bolton Wanderers </h2> <p><strong>Story of the summer </strong>We've kept much of the previous squad together and nobody's broken a leg this time around so we're relatively happy. Ivan Klasnic and Jussi Jaaskelainen have moved on, but they'd become bench warmers so Gretar Steinsson and Nigel Reo-Coker are the only regulars to depart. Andy Lonergan looks good as Jussi's replacement with Matt Mills and Keith Andrews looking decent and experienced signings to help fill the gaps left behind (though midfield also needs a Fabrice Muamba-style battler signing up). They're hardly glamorous signings but should add backbone to a team that was all-too-often spineless last season. Benik Afobe also arrives on loan as the latest Arsenal youngster for Coyle's 'finishing school'. He didn't score many on loan at Huddersfield but got rave reviews so we're hopeful he'll be good competition up front. Returns for Lee Chung-yong , Stuart Holden and Tyrone Mears will also be like new signings (as the clich\u00e9 goes).</p> <p><strong>What the fans want </strong>Some fans fancy we'll walk it this year, perhaps hoping the time has finally come for the many 'Championship-level' signings we seem to have made in recent years. If all goes as well as we might hope Marvin Sordell will finish as the division's leading goal scorer, we'll win shedloads of games and be champions by April.</p> <p><strong>What they'll actually get </strong>Nothing like such a walk in the park unfortunately. We'll probably get some stuttering performances along the way and a real fight to prove our worth and to earn back a place in the Premiership, a league we've called home for 11 years running.</p> <p><strong>One to watch</strong> Young Josh Vela stepped up from our academy not long ago and could make a real impact this season. Having had a brief taste of Premier League football the busy midfielder is sure to be giving his all in a bid to earn a return.</p> <p><strong>We'll finish \u2026 </strong>We might have said top four, but after the omnishambles of our pre-season perhaps top six. We'd love to think we're bang on for automatic promotion but we have to accept that play-offs are a distinct possibility, and with them many a racing pulse.</p> <p><strong>Geoff and Chris</strong>, <a href=\"http://www.themeninwhite.com/\" title=\"\">The Men in White </a> (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/themeninwhite\">@themeninwhite</a>)</p> <h2>Brighton &amp; Hove Albion </h2> <p><strong>Story of the summer </strong>How times have changed at Brighton. Tellingly, this summer's first three signings came from Manchester United, Manchester City and Valencia. The club has rarely, if ever, held such lofty ambitions. More quality was needed at fullback, where Gus Poyet has brought in Wayne Bridge, and Bruno Saltor (59 appearances in three years at Valencia). Tomasz Kuszczak has arrived to improve the options in goal and Welsh international Andrew Crofts returns after a two-year spell at Norwich, reinforcing the midfield. Most importantly, the club have managed to keep creative hub Vicente \u2013 now they just have to keep him fit.</p> <p><strong>What the fans want </strong>An improvement on last season's 10th place. Only nine teams scored fewer goals in last season's Championship, so the key is finding a way to coax more goals from Ashley Barnes and Craig Mackail-Smith, or to dip into the transfer market again.</p> <p><strong>What they'll actually get </strong>The club's aspirations are clear and the summer's transfer activity shows that the financial clout is there to realise them. Last season was our highest league finish in over 20 years, but all the signs (on and off the pitch) suggest that it's not unrealistic to expect further improvement.</p> <p><strong>One to watch </strong>20-year-old Brighton-born Lewis Dunk. A strong, swift and stylish central defender whose classy performances earned him a call-up to the England U21s last year.</p> <p><strong>We'll finish \u2026</strong> In the top eight, if we can score 10-15 more goals than last year.</p> <p><strong>Andrew West (</strong><a href=\"http://twitter.com/#!/thegreatwesty\" title=\"\"><strong>@thegreatwesty</strong></a><strong>)</strong></p> <h2>Bristol City </h2> <p><strong>Story of the summer </strong>This was the summer when Financial Fair Play hit Bristol with a vengeance. Bad, injury-prone or swiftly declining players on disproportionately lucrative deals all found the exit door open, to be replaced with younger, more versatile (and yes, cheaper) players. The exception is Jody Morris, back for a final crack at the English game after developing into Derek McInnes' on-field lieutenant at St. Johnstone. With a signing or two more still expected, McInnes appears to be creating a fast, attack-minded side that can assume a number of tactical guises depending on the opponents. After season upon season of stagnation, such an approach will be more than welcome in BS3.</p> <p><strong>What the fans want </strong>Let's start with not losing 3-0 at home quite as often and work from there. More goals, more fight and more attractive football would all be good. A team to enjoy watching, with youth (ideally home-grown) to the fore. Far fewer journeymen, far fewer capitulations. This correspondent would kill for a cup run, too, but let's not run before we can walk.</p> <p><strong>What they'll actually get </strong>A work in progress, one would imagine. McInnes hasn't been able to make long-standing contracts go away, and we're still lumbered with a lot of expensive dead wood. Until we know whether a new stadium is in our future, we'll be working on a tight budget so success in a division full of parachute payments will be limited. But we can expect a genuine sense of purpose, something that's been missing since Gary Johnson ran out of steam in his third season at this level.</p> <p><strong>One to watch </strong>Cole Skuse. He's been with the club forever, playing over 250 times, but at 26 this technically-adept midfielder could finally make an impact on the division. With a strong range of passing, good head for the game and perhaps even the odd goal or two, Cole may well become one of the Championship's best midfielders.</p> <p><strong>We'll finish \u2026</strong> I hate writing \"mid-table\" as that often means \"I think we might go down but can't say it\". But I really do expect us to finish in that moderate-becoming-poor 12th-18th space. McInnes' record last season was strong enough that we can expect something more than another grim relegation battle, but in a tough, tough division I can't see us finishing above more than 10 teams or so this time round.</p> <p><strong>Will Jones, </strong><a href=\"http://totheleftofross.blogspot.co.uk/\" title=\"\"><strong>To The Left of Ross </strong></a><strong>(</strong><a href=\"https://twitter.com/#!/will_totheleft\" title=\"\"><strong>@will_totheleft</strong></a><strong>)</strong></p> <h2>Burnley </h2> <p><strong>Story of the summer </strong>Better than last year. Most of our budget went on Jason Shackell and he's taken the armband too. He should add stability to the back four. Other additions are mostly to add depth to the squad with the likes of Sam Vokes arriving, although young winger George Porter and left-back Joseph Mills sound exciting. We've not been able to bring in the midfielder(s) we need yet, but haven't lost anyone important apart from Jay Rodriguez, who joined Southampton early in the summer for \u00a37 million.</p> <p><strong>What the fans want </strong>Not to have our season derailed by selling star players in August/January for a change would be nice, a promotion challenge with a faster tempo on the pitch would be even better. A homegrown star in the side to replace Rodriguez. To beat Blackburn Rovers and Owen Coyle's Bolton Wanderers.</p> <p><strong>What they'll actually get </strong>Another inconsistent campaign unless we sign a midfielder. Not enough quality in there at the moment. Brian Stock has been linked and he'd be a good addition. Perhaps a good run in one of the cups. Charlie Austin scoring a hatful of goals. Two defeats against Rovers, even if Sir Steve of Kean is still in charge.</p> <p><strong>One to watch </strong>George Porter is being played down by Eddie Howe, but I'm hoping he'll have an impact this season. He adds pace and skill from the bench, hopefully a game-changing talent.</p> <p><strong>We'll finish \u2026</strong> I can't see us being close to either end of the table. As long as we're nearer the top six than the bottom six, most fans will be happy enough.</p> <p><strong>Jamie Smith, </strong><a href=\"http://nonaynever.net/\" title=\"\"><strong>NoNayNever.net</strong></a><strong> (</strong><a href=\"http://twitter.com/#!/nonaynevernet/\" title=\"\"><strong>@nonaynevernet</strong></a><strong>)</strong></p> <h2>Cardiff City </h2> <p><strong>Story of the summer </strong>Well where do we begin? The club has turned from blue to red! Players coming, players going... it's been one of the most crazy and bizarre pre-seasons we've known. I will say for the record that I am fully behind the rebrand but purely because of the longevity it brings the club. After all, we're already seeing the benefits of the investment with the quality of signings such as Jordon Mutch, Kim Bo-kyung and, imminently, Craig Bellamy.</p> <p><strong>What the fans want </strong>The same as normal: promotion. Last season was seen as Malky Mackay's honeymoon period but after such a great first season coupled with the quality of players we've brought in, the famous Cardiff City pressure is bound to be out in spades.</p> <p><strong>What they'll actually get</strong> Probably a loss in the play-offs \u2026 for a change (sad but true). It's such a tough season to call but we have a superb squad for a change and we have for me the best manager in the league so I'd like to think we'll clinch promotion.</p> <p><strong>One to watch </strong>I think we're all really interested to see what Kim Bo-kyung is capable of. From what we've seen at the Olympics with South Korea, he looks a superb asset. Another prospect is young Kadeem Harris who looks to have some very raw potential.</p> <p><strong>We'll finish </strong>There are some big hitters in the Championship this season and although I'd love to say we'll finish top two, I believe that third or fourth is more than likely.</p> <p><strong>Steve Davies-Evans, Cardiff City fan</strong></p> <h2>Charlton Athletic </h2> <p><strong>Story of the summer </strong>Lawrie Wilson from Stevenage, Jordan Cook from Sunderland have signed with Paul Hayes and Leon Clarke being made available for transfer. Back-up keeper, John Sullivan, is available for a long term loan and if he does move, the club will need to bring in a deputy for Ben Hamer. Central defender, Dorian Dervite, is currently on trial while rumours persist that the Addicks want to sign Sam Baldock. Player Of The Year, Chris Solly, is atracting interest from Premier League clubs. The Addicks still have business to do.</p> <p><strong>What the fans want </strong>A major signing or two and a campaign similar to the ones mounted by Norwich and Southanpton \u2014 the sides relegated with Charlton on 2009 \u2014 in the last two seasons would be nice. If Chris Powell is able to continue his rebuilding job and the club continues to progress, the fans will be happy.</p> <p><strong>What they'll actually get </strong>There have been rumours of problems behind the scenes during the summer. Consolidation, a mid-table finish without any flirtation with relegation would be a realistic aim. If the odd quality signing can be made, the play-offs could be a possibility.</p> <p><strong>One to watch </strong>With seven subs again being allowed in the Football League this season, former Darlington striker, Michael Smith, may get a chance to shine from the bench.</p> <p><strong>We'll finish </strong>Mid-table.</p> <p><strong>Ketts, </strong><a href=\"http://www.doctorkish.com\" title=\"\"><strong>Doctor Kish </strong></a></p> <h2>Crystal Palace </h2> <p><strong>Story of the summer </strong>Yawn. It's not been a terribly exciting summer. For once. The most exciting change so far has been the new kit, designed by a Palace fan with a Barcelona style yellow trim. It looks well sexy. Player-wise, we've lost Nathaniel Clyne, Darren Ambrose, Sean Scannell and a few others but signed just three (Joel Ward and Aaron Wilbraham with Aaron Martin coming in on loan from Southampton) with more expected. There was, though, this ageing chap called Dougie Freedman who had a cameo against Dulwich Hamlet and looked decent. Anyone know his contract status?</p> <p><strong>What the fans want </strong>A shot at the play-offs, or at the very least a top 10 finish. That or another decent cup run \u2013 last season's trip to Cardiff for the semi-finals (as well as the quarter-final win at Old Trafford) left Eagles fans wanting more scalps. The money helps too.</p> <p><strong>What they'll actually get </strong>Probably a league finish of about 15th, maybe top half at a push. Which wouldn't be terrible and would still signal (slow) progress under Freedman. A cup run again would be nice, maybe we could beat Brighton in the quarter-final this time, please?</p> <p><strong>One to watch </strong>How much space am I allowed? The academy is brimming with talent at the moment; but expect young Kyle de Silva \u2013 a tricky left-winger \u2014 to make the break through this season. Especially as we currently have no other left wingers.</p> <p><strong>We'll finish </strong>15th, having taken one big scalp in the cup, and having beaten all of our local rivals (Brighton, Charlton and Millwall) at least once each.</p> <p><strong>James Daly, </strong><a href=\"http://www.fiveyearplanfanzine.co.uk/\" title=\"\"><strong>Five Year Plan</strong></a><strong> (</strong><a href=\"http://twitter.com/#!/FYPFanzine\" title=\"\"><strong>@FYPFanzine</strong></a><strong>)</strong></p> <h2>Derby County </h2> <p><strong>Story of the summer</strong> The big story was the sale of Jason Shackell to Burnley for seemingly little profit. Thirty season ticket holders even asked about getting their money back after that! We've spent most of the money on his replacement Richard Keogh and the fans seemed to have calmed down with the addition of a few younger players who will strengthen us. At the time of writing, we still haven't signed a new striker, highlighted as a priority by Clough. Last season's top scorer, Steve Davies, is on the transfer list after declining a new contract and could leave imminently.</p> <p><strong>What the fans want </strong>The Rams to play high-tempo, attacking football, keep it tight at the back and score plenty of goals. For the team to learn from the mistakes of last season so that a play-off place is well within our reach.</p> <p><strong>What they'll actually get </strong>The Rams will play high-tempo, attacking football, leak loads of soft goals and miss loads of chances. We will fail to convert tight games into victories and will have a frustratingly average mid-table finish.</p> <p><strong>One to watch</strong> Will Hughes is a brilliant young midfielder who will be around the first team squad this season, along with Mason Bennett who made his debut last season aged 15 but has now left school!</p> <p><strong>We'll finish \u2026 </strong>in the top 10.</p> <p><strong>Stewart Smith, </strong><a href=\"http://ramspaceuk.wordpress.com/\" title=\"\"><strong>Ramspace</strong></a><strong> (</strong><a href=\"http://twitter.com/#!/cspaceram\" title=\"\"><strong>@cspaceram</strong></a><strong>)</strong></p> <h2>Huddersfield Town </h2> <p><strong>Story of the summer </strong>So far this summer, Huddersfield Town have done some very tidy business. Although none of the signings are box office, they are young, talented and arrive from other clubs with very favourable reviews. Out if the signings so far, young midfielders Oliver Norwood and Adam Clayton look like they will offer the dynamism and passing ability we have so often lacked in midfield, but there hasn't been a disappointing buy so far. There have been no unexpected departures, although despite offering to drive them to new clubs myself, we've still not been able to dispose of Antony Kay and John McCombe.</p> <p><strong>What the fans want </strong>I suppose the true optimist would hope we can follow Southampton and Norwich into the Premier League the year after promotion from League One. The more cautious optimist will hope that Jordan Rhodes stays and that we compete week in week out.</p> <p><strong>What they'll actually get </strong>I expect us to have an early wake-up call where we look a bit shellshocked, before we find our feet in the league. It is unrealistic to expect that we'll compete in the upper echelons of the league, but if the team can gel then we will surprise a few people and probably finish mid-table.</p> <p><strong>One to watch </strong>After his play-off heroics, I'd like to think Alex Smithies can overcome his injury woes and have a strong season. He's got every attribute a good goalkeeper needs, he just needs to put all the pieces together and show what he's capable of.</p> <p><strong>We'll finish \u2026 </strong>I'm thinking about 14th which I would be absolutely delighted with. We currently do not have the infrastructure or fan base to make any appearance in the top flight anything more than a brief flirtation. After an 11-year exile from this division if we finish above the relegation places we should be delighted. This is a season that should be enjoyed and relished.</p> <p><strong>Charlie Johnson, </strong><a href=\"http://footballcharlie.footballunited.com/\" title=\"\"><strong>FootballCharlie</strong></a><strong> </strong>(<a href=\"http://twitter.com/#!/footballcharlie\" title=\"\">@FootballCharlie</a>)</p> <h2>Hull City </h2> <p><strong>Story of the summer </strong>Nick Barmby's sacking, and the nature of it, appalled many. Unhappiness at the owners was widespread, both for their actions and the style of them. Brusquely dispensing with a local legend was never going to be popular. Since then, the mood has improved greatly. An experienced manager in Steve Bruce was recruited, a better appointment than we really anticipated. He's been given money to spend, and his summer signings of Ben Amos, Eldin Jakupovic, Nick Proschwitz, Abdoulaye Faye, Alex Bruce and Sone Aluko should add both goals and experience to what was already an exciting young squad. Providing our existing stars are retained, chiefly James Chester and Robert Koren, the future looks suddenly bright.</p> <p><strong>What the fans want </strong>Goals. Despite finishing eighth last season and spending much of it in the top six with a beautiful style of play, a chronic lack of goals undid City at the death. That deficiency is being addressed by Steve Bruce, and if done so successfully, it should only take a small improvement to turn \"nearly\" into \"there\". The top six is definitely on the agenda, though some are peering even higher \u2026</p> <p><strong>What they'll actually get </strong>City are strong candidates for the play-offs. The squad is coming together nicely and the manager has experience of taking teams up, so it'd be a disappointment not to still be in with a chance come April. The top two doesn't quite feel achievable, but we ought to win more than we lose.</p> <p><strong>One to watch </strong>James Chester's already broken through and is among the division's best defenders \u2013 what we want to watch is whether he can retain those high standards. If so, he's Premier League-bound \u2013 hopefully with City\u2026</p> <p><strong>We'll finish </strong>Between fifth and eighth.</p> <p><strong>Andy Dalton, </strong><a href=\"http://ambernectar.org/\" title=\"\"><strong>Amber Nectar</strong></a><strong> (</strong><a href=\"http://twitter.com/#!/Amber__Nectar\" title=\"\"><strong>@Amber__Nectar</strong></a><strong>)</strong></p> <h2>Ipswich Town </h2> <p><strong>Story of the summer </strong>The exits of former captain Grant Leadbitter and Lee Bowyer at the end of last season weren't universally mourned, while more fans were sad to see Ibrahima Sonko on his way and wouldn't mind Celtic loanee Daryl Murphy returning on a permanent basis. With the process of recruitment still very much ongoing, so far we've added former Forest centre-half Luke Chambers, promising ex-Macclesfield right-back Elliott Hewitt, keeper Scott Loach, a boyhood Town fan, from Watford and on-loan Tottenham man Massimo Luongo. Pre-season has seen us lose to Luton and Southend and beat West Ham within the same week. No one knows quite what to think yet.</p> <p><strong>What the fans want </strong>Even the most optimistic supporters accept that the squad is lacking in depth and not really up to a challenge for the automatic places. In or around the play-offs is the extent of hopes at present.</p> <p><strong>What they'll actually get </strong>That's probably not too far off if we add a few players to be the squad between now and the end of the month and if key players avoid injuries. At the same time, if things don't go entirely to plan, it could be yet another season spent in the lower reaches of mid-table.</p> <p><strong>One to watch </strong>On the basis of pre-season, Luongo looks likely to make a big impact, but in terms of players who are actually ours, 16-year-old Byron Lawrence made his debut on the final day of last season and is likely to be involved more during this campaign. The diminutive midfielder, who Paul Jewell has described as a \"Jack Wilshere-type player\", needs to get used to the physical aspects of the Championship but is tipped for big things.</p> <p><strong>We'll finish \u2026</strong> It's tempting to say 15th as we always seem to be 15th these days but I'll go for a more glass-half-full sixth-to-ninth, which would constitute progress in the right direction after several seasons of stagnation.</p> <p><strong>Phil Ham, </strong><a href=\"http://www.twtd.co.uk\" title=\"\"><strong>twtd.co.uk</strong></a><strong> (</strong><a href=\"http://twitter.com/#!/twtduk\" title=\"\"><strong>@twtduk</strong></a><strong>)</strong></p> <h2>Leeds United </h2> <p><strong>Story of the summer</strong> Neil Warnock promised huge changes this summer and despite a pending takeover making things difficult for the Leeds United manager, there has been plenty of comings and goings at Elland Road. The biggest loss is Robert Snodgrass which was a huge blow to Warnock's preparations, it's impossible to overstate how much he'll be missed. There are some positives however, most notably the defence where the likes of Adam Drury, Jason Pearce and Paddy Kenny have been added, which will hopefully provide a desperately needed improvement on last seasons defensive record.</p> <p><strong>What the fans want</strong> We want promotion. Not just the fans, but the manager and players too. Neil Warnock was brought in for that very reason and anything less than promotion back to the Premier League would be considered a failure by the majority.</p> <p><strong>What they'll actually get</strong> It's difficult to say. The squad looks solid enough from a defensive perspective, but it lacks game-changing individuals like Robert Snodgrass that are so often the difference between one and three points. We're a couple of signings short of being serious contenders in my opinion.</p> <p><strong>One to watch</strong> Fresh off the seemingly endless conveyor belt of talent that is Leeds United's Thorp Arch Academy, Sam Byram has made a huge impression on fans in pre-season and looks to have an exciting future ahead \u2013 which means he'll probably be a Norwich player by the end of January.</p> <p><strong>We'll finish</strong> The most important thing this summer was to improve the defence, and in that respect, it looks to have been a success. Unfortunately, we don't appear to have enough quality depth elsewhere or the attacking options to sustain a promotion challenge. I remain hopeful that something will change in the next week or so, but as things stand, I predict a 12th placed finish for The Whites. </p> <p><strong>David Wilkinson, </strong><a href=\"http://www.thescratchingshed.com\" title=\"\"><strong>The Scratching Shed</strong></a><strong> (</strong><a href=\"http://twitter.com/#!/ScratchingShed1\" title=\"\"><strong>@TSSLUFC</strong></a><strong>)</strong></p> <h2>Leicester City </h2> <p><strong>Story of the summer</strong> Nigel Pearson's clear-out has continued. At the back the excitable Sol Bamba, the inconsistent Matt Mills and the almost ever-present but unfancied Lee Peltier have all gone. In their place arrive players looking to establish themselves in the shape of Ritchie de Laet and Zak Whitbread. Up front Jamie Vardy's outrageous goalscoring record in non-league football has earned him a record breaking \u00a31m move three divisions up the league ladder. He'll be competing for a place alongside David Nugent with Jermaine Beckford who, to the surprise of some, remains in the camp. Sven thought experienced heads would do the job last term. It looks like Pearson is doubling down on youth and hunger.</p> <p><strong>What the fans want</strong> Promotion. This is Leicester's ninth season outside the top flight and you have to go back to the 1920's to find a City side away from English football's top table for so long. Please let this be the year.</p> <p><strong>What they'll actually get </strong>Matches to die for, followed by maddening inconsistency. Pearson will be done over tactically at least a few times this season (he always is). But what matters is if he's rediscovered the formula that saw Leicester win more games by a single goal (14) than any other Championship side in 2009-10.</p> <p><strong>One to watch </strong>Undeterred by the Yann Kermogant affair, Pearson has dipped into Ligue 2 again and signed France Under-20 winger Anthony Knockaert. Apparently Newcastle were interested in him.</p> <p><strong>We'll finish \u2026</strong> Annoyingly close to automatic promotion, perform heroically in the playoff semi-final until the match goes to penalties and Knockaert attempts a Panenka \u2026 probably.</p> <p><strong>Mike McCarthy, </strong><a href=\"http://foxblogger.wordpress.com\" title=\"\"><strong>Foxblogger</strong></a><strong> (</strong><a href=\"http://twitter.com/#!/foxblogger\" title=\"\"><strong>@foxblogger</strong></a><strong>)</strong></p> <h2>Middlesbrough </h2> <p><strong>Story of the summer </strong>Compared to recent years there's been a veritable feast of new signings this summer, Grant Leadbitter, Mustapha Carayol, George Friend, Emanuel Jorge Ledesma and old boy Stuart Parnaby have all been added to our ranks. In the opposite direction goes Barry Robson plus three of our home grown stars in Jonathan Franks, Jonathan Grounds and Tony McMahon. The loss of those academy products seems to suggest Mowbray won't be swayed by sentimentality during his rebuilding process. In addition to those bits of business we all gave a collective shrug and said \"meh\" to the inconsequential loss of Malaury Martin, Bart Ogbeche, Danny Coyne and Adam Hammill. But for all these comings and goings the 'story of the summer' has undoubtedly been the capture of Jonathan Woodgate. I can't help feeling that \"as long as he can stay fit\" will become a slightly overused phrase over the next few months. With club captain Matthew Bates already a long term absentee, Woodgate is certainly a gamble but one most other Championship clubs would have jumped at given half the chance.</p> <p><strong>What the fans want </strong>A full season out of Woodgate is an absolute must. It would be nice to see the goals shared around with less of a reliance on Marvin Emnes. If the new boys can complement our crop of emerging youngsters then we should see a more balanced team and one that plays with a bit more width, freedom and expression. People have been waiting patiently to see a team with the Mowbray stamp on it and this could well be it. A return to some +20,000 crowds at the Riverside would also be a welcome addition, but I'd settle for getting Kevin Thomson off the wage bill as a close second.</p> <p><strong>What they'll actually get </strong>A huge chorus of \"you see, what did I tell you\" as Woodgate breaks down on the opening day. Seriously though, its difficult not to be positive about the coming season. I don't think we'll walk the league or even go up as champions but I do believe we could be in for some very entertaining football over the next few months.</p> <p><strong>One to watch </strong>Cameron Park and Adam Reach have both been promising to break through for a while now, Reach in particular has really impressed during pre-season. That said, if Curtis Main continues where he left off last season he could well be the name on everyone's lips.</p> <p><strong>We'll finish \u2026 </strong>Last season my prediction was just one place out, so buoyed by that unnerving accuracy I'm going stick my neck out and say we will finish fourth this time round.</p> <p><strong>Steve Welsh, </strong><a href=\"http://miniboro.com\" title=\"\"><strong>MiniBoro</strong></a><strong> (</strong><a href=\"http://twitter.com/#!/miniboro_dotcom\" title=\"\"><strong>@miniboro_dotcom</strong></a><strong>)</strong></p> <h2>Millwall </h2> <p><strong>Story of the summer</strong> Undoubtedly influenced by last season's slow start, we've been quick to address some of the squad's weaknesses in signing Bournemouth wing back Scott Malone and winger Chris Taylor from Oldham. Karleigh Osborne was also brought in to augment the defensive options on offer after turning down a new contract with Brentford, and veteran goalkeeper Maik Taylor joined permanently following a successful loan spell from Leeds. In terms of the departures, Hamer Bouazza left for AC Omonia, defender Tony Craig signed with Brentford for an undisclosed fee, and Josh McQuoid returned to his former club Bournemouth as part of the deal to bring in Malone.</p> <p><strong>What the fans want </strong>The conclusion of last season indicated that this side could have probably done better than spending much of the campaign flirting with relegation. More than anything, I think most of us are hoping that it doesn't take until March for the players to show what they're truly capable of.</p> <p><strong>What they'll actually get </strong>Producing the kind of form we took into April for months on end seems more than a little unlikely, but I don't see why we can't improve upon our overall consistency. While it might not end in glory, this season should hopefully be less arduous than the previous one.</p> <p><strong>One to watch </strong>Forward Shaun Batt, who's been injured for the best part of two years, will almost be like a new signing for us. I'm really interested to see how he gets on.</p> <p><strong>We'll finish\u2026</strong> I think we have enough to avoid the drop, but don't see us properly competing with the pacesetters. A top-half finish is probably the best we can hope for, though mid-table seems more realistic.</p> <p><strong>Charlie Mahoney, Millwall fan (</strong><a href=\"https://twitter.com/#!/THRIIIIKER\" title=\"\"><strong>@THRIIIIKER</strong></a><strong>)</strong></p> <h2>Nottingham Forest </h2> <p><strong>Story of the summer</strong> It was all about the takeover for us \u2013 the Al Hasawi family were long linked with a move to acquire Forest from the estate of Nigel Doughty, eventually this happened and the new owners have proven popular with fans. Not least for meeting Steve Cotterill and sacking him hours later. After much speculation they sprung a surprise by placing Sean O'Driscoll in charge (who was, weeks before the takeover, a Forest employee of course). It's come at the cost of disrupting our preseason, we've lost a few players and signed some \u2014 but not quite enough yet to have a comfortable size of squad.</p> <p><strong>What the fans want </strong>Most seem content with our approach of rebuilding sensibly and shrewdly with a manager who promises to deliver the kind of football we want to see. Some want to see the new owners spunk money left, right and centre despite the kind of warning signs we have seen recently at the two blue cities of Cardiff and Leicester (although Cardiff are red now aren't they?).</p> <p><strong>What they'll actually get </strong>I think we'll have a season of consolidation \u2013 new signings will need time to bed in and gel, and the manager needs time to get his message across. Mid-table. And you know what? I'd be happy with that.</p> <p><strong>One to watch </strong>I'm hoping that this will be the season that Jamaal Lascelles will be promoted to the first team squad \u2013 maybe not always a first choice, but I'd like to see him get some first team game time to kick on and develop his game.</p> <p><strong>We'll finish \u2026</strong> I'm expecting mid-table mediocrity \u2013 a slow start, and a better middle and finish with possibly half a sniff of being the late surgers into the play-offs (if I'm being quite wildly optimistic).</p> <p><strong>Ryan Brice, </strong><a href=\"http://nffcblog.com/\" title=\"\"><strong>NFFC Blog</strong></a><strong> (</strong><a href=\"https://twitter.com/#!/nffcblog\" title=\"\"><strong>@NFFCblog</strong></a><strong>)</strong></p> <h2>Peterborough United </h2> <p><strong>Story of the summer</strong> Posh have been fairly busy this summer bringing in: Bobby Olejnik (Torquay), Nathaniel Knight-Percieval (Wrexham), Danny Swanson (Dundee United), Michael Bostwick (Stevenage), Nathaniel Mendez-Laing (Wolves) and Johnson Clarke-Harris (Coventry). The signings show that the management team are sticking with the club's policy that has got them this far: bringing in young talent from the lower leagues. Of the new signings Swanson and Bostwick are the two that have created the most excitement around London Road. Swanson has had a lot of injury problems during his career so far, but has already caught the eye north of the border with his talent on the ball. Bostwick, on the other hand, is the exact sort of player Posh were missing last season. A physical presence, that never stops running, he has earned a reputation as one of the best midfielders in the lower divisions and Darren Ferguson will be hoping that he makes the step-up to the Championship with ease. Things have been quieter in terms of players going out. The very much divisive goalkeeping debate has been ended with both the club's first-team keepers from last season \u2013 Joe Lewis and Paul Jones \u2013 heading elsewhere, the former to Cardiff and the latter to Crawley. However, despite Posh having placed some talented players in the transfer list \u2013 including George Boyd, Paul Taylor and Grant McCann \u2013 there has been relatively little interest in the trio and all three still remain at the club.</p> <p><strong>What the fans want </strong>Expectations haven't increased too much since last season. I think everybody would like to see the club simply consolidate in the division again. We managed to reach 50 points last season, bang on the initial target set by Ferguson. He and Darragh MacAnthony have constantly talked of moving the club forward slowly at this level so I expect that they are hoping to achieve around 60 points this campaign and most fans, too, would like to see some positive progress.</p> <p><strong>What they'll actually get </strong>Unfortunately the Championship looks a stronger division this year. With Doncaster out of the division, we are the smallest club in the Championship by a greater margin and picking out three teams that, on paper, appear worse than us is a bit of a struggle. The key will be in how well the new signings settle in, but if we manage to stay in the division this season it will be a greater achievement than last campaign.</p> <p><strong>One to watch </strong>Joe Newell has come through the youth system at the club and looks an exciting talent. He was in and around the first-team squad last season and managed to score his first goal for the club against Leeds, towards the back end of the campaign. MacAnthony has said that he will play around 30 games this year, so there is a large amount of expectation on the 19-year-old's shoulders.</p> <p><strong>We'll finish \u2026 </strong>I think we'll finish just above the relegation zone again. This season looks set to be a struggle, but the squad has increased in quality in certain areas and we should just about have enough to see us safe.</p> <p><strong>John Verrall, </strong><a href=\"http://posh.footballblog.co.uk/\" title=\"\"><strong>Peterborough United Football Blog</strong></a><strong> (</strong><a href=\"http://twitter.com/#!/johnverrall\" title=\"\"><strong>@JohnVerrall</strong></a><strong>)</strong></p> <h2>Sheffield Wednesday </h2> <p><strong>Story of the summer </strong>A strong summer where fringe players have been shown the door and Championship pedigree players have been welcomed. The signing of Chris Kirkland boosts Wednesday's already strong competition for the No1 shirt, which can only mean good things. The blow of not being able to sign promising youngster Danny Batth permanently was cushioned by the signing of experienced centre back Anthony Gardener. The long pursuit of Michail Antonio also finally came to an end too, with the pacey winger signing a four year deal. That's been a massive boost to players and fans alike.</p> <p><strong>What the fans want </strong>Whispers of the Owls doing a Norwich or a Southampton will always echo throughout the message boards and the pubs of Sheffield. Wednesday would be in a better position to hit back-to-back promotions than Charlton or Huddersfield, but sadly I think that would be a step too far at the minute.</p> <p><strong>What they'll actually get </strong>Everyone would happily take a mid-table finish, with the aim to build for next season and then push for the play-offs. The glut of good teams such as Bolton and Wolves who have come down from the Premier League and teams like Birmingham still lingering will mean a tricky season for all involved.</p> <p><strong>One to watch </strong>If he starts most matches and manages to form a successful partnership with Gary Madine, I believe Chris Maguire will have a storming season for the Owls. He's a player that really has it all.</p> <p><strong>We'll finish </strong>I'm going to plump for 11th with a massive 58 points.</p> <p><strong>James Edwards, Sheffield Wednesday fan </strong></p> <h2>Watford </h2> <p><strong>Story of the summer</strong> [Takes a deep breath] So. Our previous, somewhat worrying and unfathomable owner has sold the club to the Pozzo family, who also own Udinese (Italy) and Granada (Spain). Within minutes of their expensive Italian shoes hitting the tarmac in England, they had sacked Sean Dyche \u2013 his P45 the reward for steering us to our highest finish in years. His replacement is the unmistakable Gianfranco Zola, one of the greatest footballers the world has ever seen. Hornets fans are hoping we are yet to see his best as a manager. Since the takeover we've seen no fewer than seven new additions to the playing squad, with more almost certainly on the way. Oh, and last year's leading striker was jailed for 10 months, whilst cult hero Lloyd Doyley celebrated his testimonial year with a game against Spurs. Just an average close season in WD18 really.</p> <p><strong>What the fans want </strong>After several seasons of setting survival (both on the pitch and of it) as the only goal, Watford supporters could be forgiven for using the arrival of the Pozzo family as justification for training their sights on the top half of the division for a change. Outside of Watford, some media outlets are starting to talk of Watford and their illustrious backers as promotion contenders, but I think most regular watchers would settle for a season in which we play some of the decent football Zola has promised, whilst remaining comfortably clear of the drop zone.</p> <p><strong>What they'll actually get </strong>Even the most grounded of Hornets will accept that the Pozzo family haven't got involved at Vicarage Road with a view to adding a mediocre Championship club to their stable. They want success and the stated target is the Premier League. They've made a success of Udinese and Granada, quickly in the case of the latter, but the second tier is a cruel mistress and will be tough to conquer. With a manager who lacks experience at this level and a host of new additions, creating a side that will challenge this time round looks tough. I think if the Hornets finish comfortable mid table, perhaps after flirting with the play-offs, no one will be too surprised.</p> <p><strong>One to watch </strong>After an incredible end to last season, the cat is out of the bag with regards to Sean Murray, but I believe he'll shine again. Piero Mingoia, an Italian midfielder who has been at the club since he's 13, is one readers may not know much about. Not dissimilar in appearance to the new gaffer, this year may be his year. Also worth keeping an eye on the wonderfully named Britt Assombalonga, who last season was the 50th graduate from the Watford Academy to make a first team appearance.</p> <p><strong>We'll finish </strong>Hopefully with the same manager and owners. The club is craving stability. In terms of a league finish, I'm going to go for one better than last year. Tenth for the new look golden boys..</p> <p><strong>Mike Parkin, </strong><a href=\"http://www.fromtherookeryend.com\" title=\"\"><strong>From the Rookery End</strong></a><strong> (</strong><a href=\"http://twitter.com/#!/rookerymike\" title=\"\"><strong>@RookeryMike</strong></a><strong>)</strong></p> <h2><strong>Wolves </strong></h2> <p><strong>Story of the summer </strong>As I write this the vultures are beginning to circle over our top talents. Steven Fletcher and Matt Jarvis are both likely to join Michael Kightly in leaving before the transfer window shuts and that will leave a gaping hole to fill. We've signed two strikers: Frank Nouble, a freebie from West Ham, and Bjorn Sigurdarson for a few million from Norway. Midfielder Tongo Doumbia has also arrived on a season long loan. It's really anyone's guess as to how the jigsaw will look when all the pieces are shifted around and put together again.</p> <p><strong>What the fans want </strong>An immediate return to the Premier League (automatically please) playing attractive football and re-energising the club after an horrific year both on and off the field. New manager Stale Solbakken seems to have a very clear idea how he wants us to play and if it comes off, there's no reason we shouldn't achieve our ultimate goal.</p> <p><strong>What they'll actually get </strong>A lot of faith is being placed in the manager's ability to build a team out of the wreckage. Lots of players are being moved on and those coming in seem like gambles. That said, it looks like Solbakken will be backed financially throughout the season, so there's no reason we shouldn't be around the top six as an absolute minimum.</p> <p><strong>One to watch </strong>At lot is expected of Sigurdarson and he arrives with a decent reputation. Of our home grown talents, winger Zeli Ismael has been widely touted for a good while now. Hopefully this is his time.</p> <p><strong>We'll finish \u2026 </strong>Top six is the minimum and I think that's about where we'll end up. I'd like to think we'd be in the automatic shake-up, but it could be the lottery of the play-offs. Fourth or fifth.</p> <p><strong>Thomas Baugh</strong>, <a href=\"http://www.wolvesblog.com/\" title=\"\"><strong>Wolves Blog</strong></a></p>",

Should Alan Pardew stick with the 4-3-3 formation he used late last season or switch to a 4-3-1-2 diamond that would allow Demba Ba to play more centrally? Would signing Andy Carroll represent a regressive step or may he turn into the new Zlatan Ibrahimovic? Why does owner Mike Ashley not compromise and meet Lille's fee for the France right-back Mathieu Debuchy? Will Europa League involvement prove a blessing or a curse?</p> <p>They are all intriguing queries; not to mention very different from the questions the same supporters were pondering this time last year. Back then people wondered if they were about to watch the unfolding of a relegation battle and looked extremely doubtful if it was suggested that signings such as Ba, Yohan Cabaye and Davide Santon would prove a success.</p> <p>No one dreamed that the team would finish fifth in the Premier League or that Pardew would morph into \"Pardiola\", let alone envisaged Ba rattling in 16 goals in record time before being joined by a similarly prolific Senegalese compatriot striker in Papiss Ciss\u00e9 during the January transfer window.</p> <p>A clever tactician and astute man manager \u2013 how many other coaches have coaxed smiles out of Hatem Ben Arfa? \u2013 Pardew thoroughly deserved his manager of the year award but now the bar has been raised and he must confront a set of fresh challenges.</p> <p>Providing Newcastle survive their Europa League qualifier they will then fall into the draining Thursday night/Sunday afternoon playing routine demanded by the competition's group stage.</p> <p>While a return to Europe is eagerly anticipated by fans, Pardew will need to devise a fairly radical squad rotation policy. Either that or several of his best players could be burnt out by Christmas by which time their challenge for a Champions League place may have bitten the dust.</p> <p>After recovering from a nasty knee injury Sammy Ameobi \u2013 Shola's little brother and a skilful creator \u2013 has impressed in pre-season and will almost certainly be offered games in Europe and the Premier League. So, too, should the gifted attacking midfielder Haris Vuckic. The 19-year-old Slovenia international could do with putting some appalling bad luck with injuries behind him in what really needs to be a breakthrough season.</p> <p>So far new signings have been youthful, low key and targeted at a radically overhauled development squad. Even so Gael Bigirimana, recruited from Coventry, has caught the eye in midfield this summer while medium-term hopes are similarly high for both Romain Amalfitano, another midfielder acquired from Reims, and the Australian centre-half Curtis Good.</p> <p>It would help Pardew's cause if long-mooted moves for Debuchy \u2013 who shone for France during Euro 2012 \u2013 FC Twente's Brazilian centre half Douglas and the Ajax defensive midfielder or left-back Vurnon Anita are completed by the end of August.</p> <p>Anita, especially, appears an important target as he promises to be an ideal replacement were Cheik Tiot\u00e9 to be injured or, worse, subject to a last-minute bid from a Chelsea or Manchester United.</p> <p>Pardew, who remains optimistic he can retain \"stars\" such as Tiot\u00e9, Cabaye and Ciss\u00e9 this summer, reports that Tiot\u00e9 is \"10 times better\" than last summer when the Ivorian was detained in West Africa for a chunk of pre-season while he negotiated the red tape involved in renewing his visa.</p> <p>Like Ba, Ciss\u00e9 and Ben Arfa, Tiot\u00e9 is a Muslim but, this season, that quartet will not have to cope with problems of daylight fasting during the early weeks of the campaign as Ramadan ends, conveniently, on 18 August.</p> <p>By then they should be joined in the first-team squad by the centre- half Steven Taylor, Pardew's best defensive header of a ball, and the winger Sylvain Marveaux. While Taylor missed the second half of the last campaign with a ruptured achilles, a groin operation meant Marveaux's career on Tyneside has still to get going.</p> <p>Ba was widely expected to be swiftly out of the starting blocks en route for lucrative pastures new this summer. Everyone knew that the Senegal striker's contract contained a clause enabling him to depart for \u00a37m before 31 July but despite some interest from Galatasaray, Fenerbahce and Rubin Kazan, Ba's long-term, if well managed, knee condition \u2013 something Pardew describes as \"a deficiency\" \u2013 evidently deterred suitors.</p> <p>Newcastle have declined to re-negotiate Ba's partially pay-as-you-play contract until next summer but Pardew has promised that he will occupy a central attacking role \"90% of the time\" rather than operate in the wide left position in which he ended last season.</p> <p>Come January, Ba, Ciss\u00e9 and Tiot\u00e9 will almost certainly be bound for the Africa Cup of Nations in South Africa, which explains why Pardew is so keen on signing Anita and a striker.</p> <p>While Shola Ameobi \u2013 aka the Fenham Eus\u00e9bio and/or the Mackem Slayer \u2013 enjoyed some excellent moments in attack last season and should not be underestimated, he can be injury prone. Moreover his erstwhile co-forwards Leon Best and Peter Lovenkrands have, along with the underrated midfielder Danny Guthrie, left Tyneside this summer.</p> <p>Such exits explain why Pardew was disappointed to lose out to Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach in the race for FC Twente's promising young striker Luuk de Jong before trying to persuade Liverpool to loan him back the centre-forward he sold them for \u00a335m in January 2011.</p> <p>Carroll's mooted return looks a non-starter \u2013 (although Ashley's ability to hold his nerve in a game of brinkmanship with Liverpool suggests that could yet alter by 1 September) \u2013 and there are those who feel that may be no bad thing.</p> <p>This, after all, is a season that Newcastle are looking forward to with optimism rather than drawing solace from past glories. With the outstanding Tim Krul in goal, the fabulous captain Fabricio Coloccini at centre-half, Tiot\u00e9 enforcing in central midfield and Pardew coaching meticulously the team are in their best shape for ages.</p> <p>As long as Ciss\u00e9 and Ba are around goals should not be in short supply but, if the days when a crisis constantly loomed around every corner at St James' Park have been consigned to the past, the team's enduring success depends on certain variables.</p> <p>Foremost among them is the relationship between Ashley and Pardew staying healthy. Then there is the question of whether the manager can not only keep Ben Arfa onside but extract the No10's true creative brilliance on a consistent level. Luck with injuries will also play a part as will the maintenance of an extraordinary spirit among an increasingly French-speaking squad.</p> <p>There are those in football who, rather unfairly, regard Pardew as rather too full of himself and believe he and Newcastle could be poised to fall flat on their faces. Granted, the road ahead promises to be tricky in places but both manager and club have learned from past mistakes and the suspicion is that their critics may be disappointed.</p>",

But it is known that a number of the Galaxy Tab tablets were returned by customers, following a <a href=\"http://news.cnet.com/8301-13579_3-57487895-37/malfunction-not-ipad-played-greater-role-in-galaxy-returns/\">study by Samsung which was entered into evidence</a> earlier this week which studied why customers at Best Buy had returned their purchases.</p> <p>Apple, by contrast, has struggled to fulfill customer demand, suggesting that sell-through of shipments to end users is essentially 100%.</p> <p>The spreadsheets show, in great detail, how Samsung's business has fared in the US, and the slim margins that retailers and carriers take on the tablets and phones.</p> <p>Because the figures show the revenues that Samsung collects from the purchases by carriers and retailers, they indicate the gap between the wholesale and retail prices. </p> <p>For the Galaxy Tab, the average wholesale price (AWP) was $448 (\u00a3287), on a device which retailed for $499 upwards.
