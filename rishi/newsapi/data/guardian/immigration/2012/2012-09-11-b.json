  "<p>American influence on the world stage is being sapped by widespread distrust of US intentions, not just in the Middle East and south Asia but also among traditional European allies, according to a survey of global opinions.</p> <p>Suspicion of America outweighed faith in its good intentions by large margins in the Arab world and Pakistan, and even its heavyweight European ally Germany was more sceptical than trusting, a YouGov survey found. British and French opinion was more positive but still deeply divided.</p> <p>Negative Arab and Pakistani perceptions of America as overweening and untrustworthy clearly pose a daunting foreign policy challenge for the Obama administration. The fact that 78% of Pakistanis questioned by YouGov said they did not trust America to act responsibly underlines Washington's serious lack of soft power in the region as it attempts to extricate itself from Afghanistan.</p> <p>Attitudes towards the US in the Arab world were nearly as negative. Those respondents in the Middle East and north Africa who said they trusted America were outnumbered by more than two to one by those who said they did not, and 39% said they did not trust America at all.</p> <p>The results suggest that Arab antipathy arising from the Iraq invasion and US support for Israel has not been softened by Obama's military withdrawal from Iraq, US support for the Arab spring and the relatively low-profile US role in the Libyan and Syrian conflicts.</p> <p>Perhaps just as worrying for Washington is the lukewarm support among western European allies. More Germans questioned in the YouGov survey voiced misgivings than trust in the US. Perhaps surprisingly, in view of past wariness, French opinion was somewhat warmer: just over half of the French poll respondents trusted America, against 40% who did not.</p> <p>The so-called special relationship between the US and Britain emerged from the survey as distinctly lopsided. There was widespread American affection for its close ally, but the sentiment was only partly requited, reflecting deep British ambivalence about America's powerful role in world affairs.</p> <p>Two-thirds of Americans questioned by YouGov said they trusted Britain to act responsibly, with 15% dissenting. The leading traits Americans attributed to the UK were a respect for human rights and \"a sensible voice in the world\". More Americans than Britons thought the UK was \"a force for good\" on the world stage.</p> <p>British perceptions seem to reflect the resentment of a junior partner in the relationship. Far more Britons than Americans saw the UK as a nation in decline, arguably showing a persistent deficit in national confidence even after the Olympics.</p> <p>When asked to select a word they associated with America, a striking 40% of the British respondents chose \"bullying\", a greater proportion than in any other country or region covered by the survey. Only 12% thought the US was defined by its respect for human rights. Half of British respondents said they trusted America, and 41% said they did not.</p> <p>There was a plurality in all the countries surveyed that foreign military intervention in Syria would make the situation there worse or have no impact. Opposition to such a move was most pronounced in Pakistan, and it was also prevalent in the Middle East and north Africa, where 40% of respondents said intervention would make matters worse, compared with 33% who said it would make things better. Six per cent said it would make no difference.</p> <p>Among western countries, opposition to armed intervention was most entrenched in Britain, where the balance was 37% in favour and 21% against, with 12% saying it would have no impact. In the US, those for and against were more or less even (20% and 22%), but outnumbered by the 47% who said they simply did not know.</p> <h2>Sex, work and morality</h2> <p>French attitudes towards women who prioritise their careers over starting a family are a touch kinder than those in the Middle East, but a touch harsher than those in Pakistan, according to the polling.</p> <p>Britons defended it as \"a morally acceptable choice\" by a 72%-6% margin, and Germans and Americans were also emphatic, but France was far more evenly divided: 30% deemed it acceptable to postpone parenthood in these circumstances, as against 27% who thought the reverse.</p> <p>In Pakistan, by contrast, the support was by a more decisive 42%-27% margin.&#xa0;Only in the Middle East and north Africa did the suggestion run into more opposition than in France, with respondents rejecting it by a margin of 49% to 22%.</p> <p>Elsewhere in the survey on questions of gender and sexual morality, opinion breaks down in more predictable ways, with liberalism prevailing in irreligious Europe, conservatism exerting more of a grip in the Muslim world, and the partially devout US occupying an intermediate position. On contraception, pornography and gay marriage the same pattern is found, as indeed it is on abortion, where France was by far the most pro-choice.</p> <p>In one other respect, France was an outlier. A minority of the French said it was always wrong for a married man (49%) or indeed woman (44%) to have an affair, whereas the majority everywhere else that YouGov surveyed said it was always immoral.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396011717\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/maps_and_graphs/2012/9/11/1347382845154/YouGov-polls-001.png\" alt=\"YouGov polls\" width=\"460\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">YouGov polls Photograph: Graphic</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Graphic</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Democracy v economy</h2> <p>The case for democracy is coming perilously close to being lost around the world, the poll reveals. In Pakistan and to a lesser extent across the Middle East and north Africa, respondents told YouGov that they thought a strong economy was more important than a system of government based on democracy. In Pakistan, the prioritising of growth over democracy was emphatic, by 71% to 22%. In a cross-border Middle Eastern sample of the online population \u2013 including Egypt, Tunisia and Libya \u2013 economic strength trumped democratic governance by 44% to 41%.</p> <p>Perhaps more surprising is the nonchalant attitude towards democracy shown in some of the states that have enjoyed it for longest. Both France and the US were split down the middle on whether the economy or democracy should come first, with a 41%-41% divide in both nations. Britain's enthusiasm for its democracy was a little more emphatic: it was seen as the priority by 46%, against 38% who would put the economy first.&#xa0;</p> <p>Only Germany was resolute in prioritising the political system. By 52% to 35%, German voters told YouGov that democracy had to come first.</p> <p>\u2022 YouGov questioned 12,693 adults across the US, Britain, Europe, the Middle East and north Africa, Pakistan and China between 10-25 August 2012. Data was weighted to be nationally representative of adult populations in Britain, US, France, Germany and the US; elsewhere it was representative of the online population.</p>",
  "<h2>The winner: the weather</h2> <p>Sunny weather in September is always a particular challenge for cinemas, as audiences tend to consider that this may be the last chance of the year to enjoy the sun, and are not going to pass it up. Arriving at the end of a summer that's had more than its fair share of rainfall, the sunshine proved an irresistible attraction for most of us, with any cinema plans put on hold until another, greyer day. Despite the arrival of some significant cinematic attractions, box-office fell 42% from the previous weekend, and overall the frame was the third worst of the past year.</p> <p>Emerging the winner of a thin field with \u00a31.05m, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/149147/dredd\" title=\"Dredd on theguardian.com/film\">Dredd</a> was able to claim bragging rights, the first 18-certificate film to top the chart since 2010. But the gross was the lowest for a number-one film since the climax of Euro 2012 football, when successive weeks of virtually no major releases culminated with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/148325/ice-age-4\" title=\"on theguardian.com/film\">Ice Age 4: Continental Drift </a>grabbing the top spot from its early rollout in Scotland, Ireland and Northern Ireland only.</p> <p>Although Dredd is the first 18-certificate chart-topper since <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/137860/saw-3d\" title=\"on theguardian.com/film\">Saw 3D</a> in October 2010, that achievement needs to be put in context. The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/131882/girl-with-the-dragon-tattoo\" title=\"on theguardian.com/film\">Girl with the Dragon Tattoo</a>, also 18 certificate, opened in the runner-up spot at the end of 2011 with \u00a34.33m including \u00a32.76m in previews. Even stripping out those significant preview takings, it achieved \u00a31.57m over the three-day weekend, and one of those days was New Year's Eve, which is not a good day for cinema attendance.</p> <h2>The losers: everything else</h2> <p>Be they a new entrant or an existing title, all films wilted in the sun. The gentlest decline for a wide release was experienced by <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0431021/\" title=\"on IMDb\">The Possession</a>, down 45%. Everything else fell more than 50% from the previous weekend, and several top titles (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/146821/brave\" title=\"on theguardian.com/film\">Brave</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/147726/bourne-legacy\" title=\"on theguardian.com/film\">The Bourne Legacy</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/148845/expendables-2\" title=\"at theguardian.com/film\">The Expendables 2</a>) fell 60% or more, in certain cases compounded by a steep drop in screen count. <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2147365/\" title=\"on IMDb\">Keith Lemon: The Film</a> plunged 79%, following a 69% drop the previous weekend.</p> <p>Landing in second place, moonshine-distilling western <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/146652/lawless\" title=\"on theguardian.com/film\">Lawless</a> kicked off its run with \u00a3973,000 including \u00a382,000 in previews. With a cast including Tom Hardy, Shia LaBeouf, Gary Oldman, Jessica Chastain, Mia Wasikowska and Guy Pearce, that's a disappointing number. John Hillcoat's previous film <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/131971/road\" title=\"at theguardian.com/film\">The Road </a>debuted with \u00a3627,000 back in January 2010, but that was from just 157 screens, as against 410 for Lawless. An 18 certificate \"for strong bloody violence and strong language\" might be considered a handicap, but you'd think Lawless's tale of heroic bootleggers resisting corrupt law enforcement, plus a side order of romance, would have broad appeal.</p> <p>With \u00a3876,000, Working Title's latest literary adaptation <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/149093/anna-karenina\" title=\"at theguardian.com/film\">Anna Karenina</a> likewise disappointed in third place. This is the company's third picture with director Joe Wright, following<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/107877/pride.and.prejudice\" title=\"at theguardian.com\"> Pride and Prejudice</a> (debut of \u00a32.53m including \u00a3270,000 in previews) and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/119568/atonement\" title=\"at theguardian.com/film\">Atonement</a> (\u00a31.63m). Reteaming the director with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/keiraknightley?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"the actor at theguardian.com/film\">Keira Knightley</a> and a period classic previously proved a winning formula, but audiences have so far not flocked to their collaboration on the Leo Tolstoy doorstopper. Critical responses to the adventurous theatrical presentation have tended towards praise for trying something new, tempered by some reservations about the outcome. At Rotten Tomatoes, scores from all critics (65% fresh), top critics (67% fresh) and site users (64% like it) are untypically similar. Midweek grosses are traditionally healthy for older-skewing upscale fare, so it's by no means all over for this one.</p> <p>Adam Sandler's latest, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/146343/that-s-my-boy\" title=\"at theguardian.com/film\">That's My Boy</a>, landed disastrously outside the top 10, with just \u00a3255,000. His last effort, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/145608/jack-and-jill\" title=\"at theguardian.com/film\">Jack and Jill</a>, debuted with \u00a3849,000 in February.</p> <p>Although all films experienced a rough weekend, Universal will take comfort that its <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/148370/ted\" title=\"the acerbic bear at theguardian.com/film\">Ted</a> (down 52%), with \u00a329.19m, is now in sniffing distance of Ice Age 4 (\u00a329.24m), the third biggest hit so far in 2012. (In fact, reports reach us that last night, Monday, Ted overtook Ice Age 4.) And Disney will be pleased that Brave, with \u00a319.34m, will soon be the 11th film to cross the \u00a320m barrier this year. Many successful animated films have run out of puff around this box office level, so if Brave can push a little harder, it will overtake <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/125070/kung.fu.panda\" title=\"at theguardian.com/film\">Kung Fu Panda</a> (\u00a320.3m), <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/140039/tangled\" title=\"at theguardian.com/film\">Tangled</a> (\u00a320.5m), <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/144411/arthur-christmas\" title=\"at theguardian.com/film\">Arthur Christmas</a> (\u00a320.8m) and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/129059/monsters-vs.-aliens\" title=\"at theguardian.com/film\">Monsters Vs Aliens</a> (\u00a321.4m).</p> <h2>The event</h2> <p>Although sunshine was the predictable enemy for all regular releases, it proved otherwise for Future Cinema's presentation of Grease, attracting more than 9,000 punters to London's Barnes Common for what it billed as \"the ultimate Grease experience\". The creators of the more famous brand Secret Cinema will take heart from such a success under the Future Cinema banner, indicating that it's the participatory themed experience, rather than the surprise element, that is key to appeal. A gross of \u00a3290,000 would have been enough to earn Grease tenth place in the box-office chart, had it been tracked by the official data gatherer \u2013 and this from a single venue.</p> <p>The distributor of concert film <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/video/2012/aug/31/lcd-soundsystem-exclusive-clip\" title=\"at theguardian.com\">Shut Up and Play the Hits</a>, which captures the last ever performance of LCD Soundsystem, also sparked audience interest through building a one-off event. The lion's share of its \u00a369,500 opening comes from last Tuesday's premiere at the Hackney Picturehouse, including a live Q+A with frontman James Murphy and other band members, which was relayed to 59 other sites nationwide. (See \"Other openers\" below for the breakdown.)</p> <h2>The arthouse market</h2> <p>Unless you count Anna Karenina, playing wide on nearly 500 screens, there are no arthouse titles in the top 15, with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/145816/imposter\" title=\"at theguardian.com/film\">The Imposter</a>, in 17th place, flying the flag for the sector. Grosses fell significantly, presumably due to the double whammy of period-drama Keira and the sunshine, but joint distributors Revolver and Picturehouse will take comfort from The Imposter's gross to date of \u00a3889,000. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/145818/shadow-dancer\" title=\"at theguardian.com/film\">Shadow Dancer</a>, which is performing better in Ireland than elsewhere, also fell hard, and is now at \u00a3674,000. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/148212/berberian-sound-studio\" title=\"at theguardian.com/film\">Berberian Sound Studio</a> dropped a gentler 57%, and has achieved \u00a397,000 after 10 days. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/143130/samsara\" title=\"at theguardian.com/film\">Samsara</a> is right behind it, with \u00a395,000, also after 10 days.</p> <h2>The future</h2> <p>With the market down 29% on the equivalent frame from 2011, and 44% down on average weekend takings for the past year, cinemas are crying out for strong fresh product, and preferably some more conducive weather for cinema going. Arriving Wednesday is Nick Love's take on 70s TV cop classic <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/146754/sweeney\" title=\"at theguardian.com/film\">The Sweeney</a>, starring Ray Winstone and Ben Drew. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/148983/hope-springs\" title=\"at theguardian.com/film\">Hope Springs</a>, with Meryl Streep and Tommy Lee Jones rekindling their stale marriage, is aiming for the currently buoyant older audience.

  "<p>\"If not us, then who?\" Anne Marie Carrie is fond of asking when talking about the decision of Barnardo's to provide welfare and social care services at Cedars, the \"pre-departure accommodation centre\" (PDA) that opened a year ago. The centre holds failed asylum-seeking families before they are deported.</p> <p>The decision \u2013 the charity's most controversial since Carrie took over as chief executive in January 2011 \u2013 provoked fury from anti-child detention campaigners, who <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2011/oct/17/child-detention-government-broken-promise\" title=\"\">accused</a> Barnardo's of allowing a rebranded version of child detention to continue when the coalition government had promised to end it. Carrie is noticeably uncomfortable and increasingly defensive discussing the issue.</p> <p>\"Do I wish the PDA didn't need to exist? Absolutely,\" she says. But the only alternative, she believes, would be separating children from their parents in their final hours in the country and having them looked after by foster carers. \"All the evidence I'd looked at says to rip children from their parents at one of the most vulnerable times of their lives ... I&#xa0;don't know if that's a best-interest decision,\" she explains.</p> <p>The security of Cedars is managed by G4S for the UK Border Agency (UKBA). When it opened, Barnardo's set out a series of \"red lines\" and Carrie insisted the charity would speak out if it saw any signs of failure to safeguard the \"welfare, dignity and respect of families\", ultimately withdrawing its services if necessary.</p> <p>A year since the first family arrived, have the lines been crossed? No, says Carrie, although the examples she gives are piecemeal. She says she wrote to the immigration minister when a family was at Cedars for 15 minutes longer than the initial 72-hour limit without the necessary ministerial approval.</p> <p>Carrie says she raised concerns about children being picked up from Cedars at 6am for lunchtime flights out of Heathrow, asking whether such an early start is necessary. Similarly, she says she has acted when she has felt families have not been treated with respect by non-Barnardo's staff.</p> <p>\"I said we would speak out about what's happening [if red lines are crossed] and I have,\" she insists.</p> <p>G4S now has better practice on transporting families thanks to the charity's influence, she claims \u2013 though campaigning organisations such as Medical Justice allege that dawn raids and excessive force still feature.</p> <p>Asked about another issue that campaigners think she should use her influence over \u2013 the provision of malaria drugs and bed nets for returning families \u2013 Carrie replies: \"We're responsible for the&#xa0;social welfare and care of those families in Cedars ... I am not the UKBA, and I&#xa0;am not G4S.\" She raps on the table&#xa0;at each name. \"If there are issues about G4S and UKBA, they [campaigners] should rightly take them up with that authority.\"</p> <p><strong>Resilience</strong></p> <p>Raised on Glasgow's Easterhouse estate, the daughter of a cleaner and a&#xa0;window cleaner, Carrie won a place at drama college, but after a fortnight was told there had been a mistake in the admissions process and she would have to leave. She enrolled on a course that taught her how to repair televisions and radios instead, and was good at it. But she left a year later to return to drama college, the first of 27 cousins to reach higher education. \"It taught me a lot about resilience,\" she says.</p> <p>After teaching drama, Carrie moved into education and then family and children's services in local government, ending up as deputy chief executive of Kensington and Chelsea council. She hadn't considered the third sector until&#xa0;she was headhunted by Barnardo's,&#xa0;where she took over as chief executive from Martin Narey. She loves seeing the&#xa0;charity's work on the ground, and has found she is good at asking people for money. But what she doesn't like, she readily admits, is \"the public profile bit\".</p> <p>Carrie will, however, speak up when she feels the government is getting it wrong. \"They have an aspiration to be the most family-friendly government, and on the ground it doesn't feel that way,\" she says.</p> <p>Three areas she feels particularly strongly about are the abolition of education maintenance allowance (a&#xa0;Barnardo's <a href=\"http://www.barnardos.org.uk/news_and_events/current_news.htm?ref=77218\" title=\"\">report</a> earlier this year found its \"disastrous\" replacement, the&#xa0;bursary fund, meant many more disadvantaged young people were being left with minimal or no funding); the proposed scrapping of housing benefit for under-25s; and plans to charge parents if the child support agency has to get involved in their child maintenance claims.</p> <p>She gives credit where she believes it is due, applauding the coalition's moves on foster care and adoption, and calling its focus on early intervention and the early years foundation \"absolutely spot on\". But she says local authority spending cuts have fallen disproportionately on crucial family intervention projects and work. \"We're just storing up problems and it's so short-sighted,\" she says.</p> <p>So-called \"troubled families\" are a&#xa0;mainstay of the work of Barnardo's. Carrie says the original criteria for defining them invented a correlation between poor families and antisocial ones. \"In&#xa0;Barnardo's we don't judge, so I&#xa0;would talk about troubled and troublesome,\" she says.</p> <p>But isn't troublesome a label too? Some families are troublesome in their communities, and it is about support and challenge, she replies. Families have told her they like Barnardo's staff because they \"don't take any crap\". \"That's when I know it's about saying: 'Your behaviour and the behaviour of your kids is causing problems for your neighbours',\" Carrie says. \"I don't think that's&#xa0;labelling.\"</p> <p><strong>'Workfare' scheme</strong></p> <p>Barnardo's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/feb/29/workfare-nobody-loves-it-like-ministers\" title=\"\">is, controversially</a>, involved in the government's \"Workfare\" scheme. When public outrage came to a head in February, Barnardo's, along with other employers, forced the government into a U-turn, saying it could not accept the 3,000 vulnerable young people it trains each year having a fortnight's unemployment benefit docked if they failed to complete an unpaid eight-week compulsory work experience placement.</p> <p>It did not withdraw from the scheme, however, and <a href=\"http://www.thirdforcenews.org.uk/2012/04/if-you-exploit-us-we-will-shut-you-down/\" title=\"\">still faces the ire of campaigners</a>.

  "<p>The extraordinary saga of a huge regeneration scheme - the <a href=\"http://www.myearlscourt.com/\">Earls Court project</a> - backed by two prestige Conservative councils which would see the Earls Court exhibition centre and 760 nearby homes demolished to make way for a high-rise, high-cost \"new urban quarter\" on 77 acres of prime inner west London real estate continues to astonish and amaze.</p> <p>Earlier this month the cabinet of Hammersmith and Fulham council, which David Cameron has described as his favourite and communities secretary Eric Pickles as \"the apple of my eye,\" voted to sell the land on which two neighbouring housing estates \u2013 the West Kensington and the Gibbs Green \u2013 stand to a subsidiary of property developer Capco for \u00a3105m, condemning the flats and houses there to demolition. <br> This is despite the council's own <a href=\"http://democracy.lbhf.gov.uk/documents/s18032/Appendix%205%20-%20Initial%20statistical%20analysis%20of%20feedback%20from%20consultation.pdf\">assessment of the outcome of its consultation of the estates' residents (pdf)</a> showing that respondents <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2012/mar/22/london-council-tenants-earls-court\">opposed to losing their flats and houses</a> outnumber those favouring it, perhaps persuaded by the council's pledge to provide replacement homes nearby, by a margin of more than three to one. </p> <p>On Wednesday Hammersmith and Fulham's planning committee looks certain to approve the latest versions of the two main planning applications for the scheme, but will do so in the knowledge that a dossier documenting alleged possible misconduct in public office, a criminal offence, and a possible breach of the Housing Act 1996 has been handed to the police. </p> <p>The dossier claims that some residents have been promised priority allocation to new homes to be built in the development area in return for their support for the Earls Court scheme, and quotes from what it says are of accounts by around 20 residents of such offers being made. However, in internal correspondence senior council officers have strongly denied that any so-called \"VIP list\" of residents has been compiled \u2013 the council's press office has reiterated this - or that any improper behaviour has occurred.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the <a href=\"http://www.aeo.org.uk/\">Association of Event Organisers</a> is arguing passionately that <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/davehillblog/2012/aug/01/boris-johnson-olympic-ealrs-court-demolition\">the loss of the famous exhibition centre</a>, which hosted the volleyball competition during the Olympics, would damage both the local economy and London's as a whole. This seems to have cut little ice as yet with either Hammersmith and Fulham or its Tory neighbour Royal Kensington and Chelsea, in which the eastern side of the development area lies and which includes the older of the two Earls Court centre buildings. </p> <p>Strong objections to the project have also been expressed by a panel of urban design experts invited by the two boroughs to comment on the scheme, whose masterplan was drawn up by Sir Terry Farrell. The panel's final report (available via <a href=\"http://www.rbkc.gov.uk/planningandconservation/planningapplications/earlscourtapplication.aspx\">here</a>) says that it \"remains to be convinced that the Applicants proposals are an acceptable scale and desirable form of development for this strategically important London site.\" It urges the various planning authorities involved to \"resist pressure to approve the current applications in their present form.\" </p> <p>This seems highly unlikely to occur. The Earls Court project has been pursued with passion by Hammersmith and Fulham in the teeth of all and any opposition. While it admits that \"a majority\" of West Kensington and Gibbs Green estate residents who took part in the council's consultation are opposed to its plans, it seems reluctant to recognise the size of that majority, preferring to say that \"a large number\" did not take part. </p> <p>However, an unusually large number for this type of exercise did: 805 responses from 515 of the 760 households. The two estates' anti-demolition campaign claims that council officers <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/davehillblog/2012/jun/19/greenhalgh-hammersm-fulham-earls-court-consultation\">omitted or miscategorised</a> a significant number of responses, and that the true ratio of objectors to supporters was actually in the region of four to one.</p> <p>The council seems keener on the responses from residents in the surrounding area, which it says showed support for the scheme by a ratio of more than four to one. However, the response rate in this case was a tiny 2% - just 448 replies to the 29,240 consultation packs distributed. </p> <p>This is an odd position for a council whose slogan is \"putting residents first\" to end up in. It pledges that, \"all homes on the estates would be replaced within the [full] redevelopment area,\" and be offered to the existing residents (I'll be examining the detail of this offer another time). It also claims that the land sale agreement will \"pave the way,\" for the Earls Court project as a whole to eventually provide \"more than \u00a31 billion worth of community benefits in the local area,\" creating 9,500 permanent new jobs and a total of 8,000 new homes. </p> <p>Council leader Nick Botterill asserts that the residents of the estates would be \"the major beneficiaries of this investment,\" though we might wonder if they would gain more than Capco, which puts the potential value of the Earls Court project at \u00a38 billion. Residents first or property developers first?</p> <p>The entire saga brings the dilemmas and paradoxes of localism into fascinating focus. The council's case that the Earls Court locality's interest would be served by going ahead with the entire scheme inherently entails going against the wishes of a large number of local people, many of them elderly, and their interest as they define it in not having their present homes knocked down.</p> <p>It isn't only Tory Hammersmith and Fulham where this type of argument is going on. Something similar on a smaller scale is rumbling on at <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2012/jun/13/london-2012-legacy-battle-newham\">the edge of the Olympic Park</a> in Labour Newham. But there is a particular trust problem with Hammersmith and Fulham. </p> <p>Most of the 760 homes on the two estates are rented at social rent levels from the council or housing associations and it hasn't gone unnoticed that Botterill's predecessor Stephen Greenhalgh, who <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2012/feb/07/stephen-greenhalgh-interview\">told the Guardian in February</a> that the Earls Court scheme represents \"the best deal in the history of redevelopment in London,\" co-authored a <a href=\"http://www.localis.org.uk/article/82/Principles-for-Social-Housing-Reform.htm\">pamphlet for the local government think tank Localis</a>, which advocated selling off all such housing (except for a tiny number of very dependent people) in order to release the value of the land they stood on and end what was characterised as a socially harmful cycle of dependency. </p> <p>This expression of a fundamental philosophical \u2013 indeed, moral - dislike for social housing is held by critics of Greenhalgh and his regime to be the true motivating factor behind his inclusion of the estates in the Earls Court project, along with a covert desire to make the political complexion of the area bluer by bringing more wealthy people into it \u2013 a charge that Greenhalgh and the council have always strongly denied.</p> <p>After Botterill and his cabinet approved the land sale to Capco, the anti-demolition campaigners vowed that <a href=\"http://westkengibbsgreen.wordpress.com/2012/09/04/we-shall-never-surrender/\">it will never surrender</a>. It is already <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/davehillblog/2012/jun/21/nick-botterill-earls-court-project-legal-challenge\">taking legal action</a> through the High Court, claiming that the council has failed to follow proper procedures, and argues that the conduct of David Cameron's favourite council <a href=\"http://westkengibbsgreen.wordpress.com/2012/08/23/prime-minister-faces-final-big-society-test-will-he-let-his-favourite-council-bulldoze-our-community/\">flies directly in the face of his Big Society idea</a>, which envisages local people taking responsibility for their own lives \u2013 the campaigners want to own and run the estates themselves.</p> <p>There is one other prominent Conservative politician who could stop the Earls Court project in its tracks \u2013 Boris Johnson. As London's mayor he has powers to block, demand amendments to or even determine for himself large developments in the capital. He has already exercised this power in relation to the Earls Court project. Last December, Greater London Authority planning officers rejected Capco's initial applications for the main part of the scheme after Hammersmith and Fulham had approved them because they were deemed <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/davehillblog/2011/dec/09/regeneration-housing\">at odds with 44 policies</a> in the mayor's London Plan \u2013 the capital's master planning document - including under-provision of affordable housing. </p> <p>The <a href=\"http://democracy.lbhf.gov.uk/documents/s22021/PAC%20report%2004_9_12%20FINAL2.pdf\">officer report (pdf)</a> provided the council's planning committee in advance of Wednesday's meeting argues in some detail that the revised applications conform to the London Plan's requirements. Time will tell if the GLA's officers agree, but it would be quite a surprise if Johnson doesn't give the project a green light in the end. He has recently appointed Greenhalgh, its prime evangelist, head of his new office for policing and crime. When Johnson was questioned about the scheme by the London Assembly in 2010 he described Greenhalgh as \"the great man.\" And as his <a href=\"http://snipelondon.com/scoop/boris-gives-95000-job-to-former-evening-standard-editor\">recent appointment</a> of former Boris-loving Evening Standard editor Veronica Wadley as an advisor underlines, Mayor Jolly Goodfun knows how to look after his chums.</p>",

  "<p>The justice and security bill is the direct result of evidence that emerged in court supporting allegations that MI5 and MI6 knew about the torture or inhuman and degrading treatment meted out by the CIA to terror suspects, including British citizens and residents, notably <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/binyam-mohamed\" title=\"\">Binyam Mohamed</a>.</p> <p>The high court, later backed by senior judges in the court of appeal, ruled that information the CIA had passed to MI5 and MI6 should be disclosed. Washington was furious. The British government, and in particular David Miliband, the foreign secretary at the time, was deeply embarrassed.</p> <p>There was a danger of further incriminating evidence emerging in court as UK citizens and residents who were held at Guant\u00e1namo Bay demanded compensation. To avoid disclosing what MI5 and MI6 may have known about the secret transfer of the detainees to the US military prison on Cuba and about their treatment, the government offered them expensive out-of-court settlements.</p> <p>Under pressure from the security and intelligence agencies \u2013 and the US \u2013 the coalition government decided to introduce a statute designed to prevent any intelligence information from being disclosed in civil court hearings ever again.</p> <p>The government argues that the bill would allow more intelligence information to be heard in court than hitherto, even though it would be heard in secret. A judge would decide whether the information should be kept secret. The bill's critics say that the way it is drafted means it would be extremely difficult for a judge to challenge any minister's claim that information should be kept secret on grounds of national security. The fact that a hearing would be held in secret could itself be kept secret.</p> <p>Critics say the bill represents a creeping move towards more and more secret courts, based on the model of the special immigration appeals commission, where any evidence can be withheld from a defendant and his or her lawyers. Evidence of British collusion in the abuse and rendition of terror suspects to places where they risked being tortured \u2013 including evidence of MI6's role in the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jun/28/libyan-dissidents-action-government-rendition\" title=\"Libyan dissidents launch action against UK government over rendition\">rendition in 2004 of two Libyan dissidents</a> into the hands of Muammar Gaddafi's secret police in Tripoli \u2013 might never have seen the light of day had the bill been in place.</p> <p>The government has tried to assuage opponents by keeping the role of steering the bill through parliament in the hands of the relatively liberal former justice secretary Ken Clarke, rather than his successor, Chris Grayling. Liberal Democrat ministers have sought credit for excluding inquests from the bill, an element of the original draft that had provoked strong opposition from armed forces families and the British Legion.</p> <p>But senior Liberal Democrats have not all been persuaded and will express their concern about the bill at their conference in Brighton this month. A motion says the bill's proposals for \"closed material procedures\", as they are called, form no part either of the Liberal Democrat or Conservative manifestos in 2010, or the coalition agreement.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Violence begets violence</strong></p> <p>In the numb days between the Twin Towers attack and the US-led retaliation on Afghanistan, it felt like we hung in balance. Would the US love its enemy, turn the other cheek, engage in dialogue? Or would it smite and bomb?</p> <p>If we are looking for a source for increased far-right violence (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/08/wade-michael-page-violent-far-right\" title=\"\">The terror within, 24 August</a>), we must look to the role-modelling provided by the governments of the US, UK, Germany, Norway, Canada, Australia and New Zealand that responded to violence with violence. While our leaders' fear and anger leads us to war and retribution, why should we expect more of our frightened, angry young white men? The article says \"\u2026 for some within this scene, strength is measured as the ability and willingness to engage in violent action against 'enemies'...\" The same deluded perception drove the US-led response to the Twin Towers attack and continues to drive much of western foreign policy today.</p> <p>The piece concludes that to guard against violent extremists, \"we must first start taking violence from the far right more seriously.\" Wrong. We need to start taking violence more seriously, period.<br><strong>Kath Dewar </strong><br>Piha, Aotearoa, New Zealand</p> <p><strong>Time to walk the talk</strong></p> <p>Tor Larsen in his letter (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global/2012/aug/28/guardian-weekly-letters-political\" title=\"\">Our wild vacillation, 31 August</a>) fears we are all kidding ourselves. Despite our good intentions and righteous views on the state of the world we continue to over-consume and thus prop up greedy empires.</p> <p>New Zealand also is busily engaged in legislating policies that promote the transfer of wealth to the \"haves\", largely ignoring climate issues, and cutting taxes and spending so that essential programmes are being reduced or eliminated.</p> <p>How can we oppose this apart from by using our vote? Many of us already know what needs to be done in our socially, environmentally, financially threatened societies, but we have to do more than argue the case, we have to walk the talk.</p> <p>And that is what I am doing (admittedly I have the luxury of living now a semi-retired, single and child-free life). I have renounced my car, computer, my landline phone, though kept my cellphone and (free) television.</p> <p>My lifestyle is minimalist. I eat carefully, I conserve resources, I walk or take public transport. I use the public library \u2013 an excellent communal resource in most centres \u2013 for computer use and internet access, and I borrow their DVDs, CDs and books. I help others (especially family) whatever way I can and nurture friendships. And I smile a lot.</p> <p>I want to be living proof that we can have a good enough life in our over-developed societies even if going without many \"essentials\"; we are nevertheless still very much better off materially than half the world. This is more than a \"should\", it is a \"must\". (And in terms of climate change I believe it is already too late.)<br><strong>Barbara Darragh </strong><br>Auckland, New Zealand</p> <p><strong>Energy's useless ends</strong></p> <p>I clearly remember the days of Fukushima: I was working in Frankfurt and it was the same week that video advertising units went up at the<em> </em>main train station. Indeed, video advertising is appearing everywhere with ever-larger screens bombarding us with attractive deals.</p> <p>So I wonder about the \"German energy balancing act\" (31 August). Is it a choice between nuclear, fossil and renewables? That's definitely a hard one. But when we insist on using that precious energy (wherever it comes from) to power advertisements for the latest deodorants in our toilets, I really do groan with despair.</p> <p>Friends of mine spent many weekends demonstrating at the power stations pictured in your article. They held demos, built tree-houses and generally tried to raise awareness of madness of burning lignite (\"brown-coal\"), which is only marginally more efficient than burning peat. But they didn't get much coverage.</p> <p>I do support my friends' action at these power stations but often wonder whether it would make more sense to demonstrate in those places where we are burning energy to serve absolutely useless needs? For example, some of these hi-tech toilets and other public spaces where we are bombarded with intrusive advertising fed by electricity from the most damaging sources.<br><strong>Alan Mitcham </strong><br>Cologne, Germany</p> <p><strong>No going back for Arctic</strong></p> <p>When Arctic sea-ice levels finally hit the anticipated record low recently (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/aug/27/arctic-sea-ice-shrinks-lowest-extent\" title=\"\">31 August</a>), I felt a mixture of fear and panic. Trend lines on graphs of sea-ice extent show the Arctic could be ice-free as early as September 2015 and almost certainly by 2020. With more exposed ocean absorbing more radiation and less ice to reflect it, a positive feedback mechanism has been set in train.</p> <p>There are already reports of extensive methane releases from collapsing subsea permafrost on the East Siberian Arctic Shelf. Methane is, of course, a potent greenhouse gas. Now a study published in the journal Nature reveals that a less studied form of permafrost, Yedoma, along the 7,000km coast of northern Siberia, is releasing 10 times more carbon into the Arctic Ocean than previously thought. Not only is the Yedoma permafrost thawing in the higher temperatures, it is also subject to enhanced wave and wind erosion brought on by the longer ice-free season, causing it to collapse and release even more methane.</p> <p>Regrettably, President Obama has now given permission to Shell to drill for oil off the northern Alaskan coast in protected habitat critical to the survival of polar bears. This, even before a vital oil-spill containment vessel received its certification. The decision puts wildlife in terrible danger as any oil spill will be almost impossible to clean up.</p> <p>As the Centre for Biological Diversity says: \"Once the Arctic is ruined, there's no going back. Unique animals like polar bears, yellow-billed loons, eiders, walruses, whales and ice seals that have evolved over millions of years to survive in this frozen wilderness \u2013 and nowhere else \u2013 will be condemned to extinction.\"<br><strong>Jenny Goldie </strong><br>Michelago, NSW, Australia</p> <p><strong>Ration NHS for the elderly</strong></p> <p>It is high time that NHS rationing was introduced (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/aug/31/nhs-rationing-risking-lives-doctors-leader\" title=\"\">7 September</a>) but not in the way that the UK government is attempting \u2013 simply cutting the budget and leaving it to doctors to cut their costs without proper direction.

  "<p>Beauty is famously in the eye of the beholder, and for some of the beholders in <a href=\"http://www.northumberland-coast.co.uk/alnmouth.php\">Alnmouth</a>, the concept doesn't include a sky-blue ice cream van decorated with beige-yellow cones.</p> <p>The beautiful port, selected by the <em>Guardian Northerner</em> as the place to <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/the-northerner/2012/aug/21/uk-cheapest-flat-alnwick-alnmouth-northumberland\">start a new life</a>, Reggie Perrin-style, should that ever be necessary, rose up earlier this year to try to get the 'mobile eyesore' moved on.</p> <p>Or some of it did, to be accurate. Another 300 people signed a petition saying that Helen Smith and her cornets, choc bars and lollies should be allowed to stay.</p> <p>Their view and Mrs Smith have now prevailed after quite a complicated exercise in local democracy which has gone on since May. That was when the van's street-trading licence, granted in 2010 for a site at the corner of Riverside Road, came up for renewal and <a href=\"http://www.apc.alnmouth.org.uk/\">Alnmouth parish council </a>objected on grounds including the damage to the view.</p> <p>The little port and estuary of the river Aln is part of an area of outstanding natural beauty on the Northumberland coast, and the <a href=\"http://www.northumberland.gov.uk/\">county council </a>accepted the parish's view, as those closest to the van. But Mrs Smith, who has a ten-year-old daughter and a mortgage on her home in Lesbury, decided to put up a fight.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396019207\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2009/12/2/1259771893250/Alnmouth-Northumbria-005.jpg\" alt=\"Alnmouth, Northumbria\" width=\"140\" height=\"130\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Alnmouth.

Suggestions that the appeal of the van also constituted a threat to children and other pedestrians were also a matter of hard evidence, or lack of it, rather than a subjective view of what constitutes or damages a beautiful view.</p> <p>So although she shut up shop and missed the summer \u2013 not a bonanza one for ice creams in spite of the hardiness of seaside holidaymakers in the UK \u2013 she appealed and has won her case. The county council's licensing sub-committee paid a site visit and councillors also went through the traffic statistics \u2013 no accidents \u2013 and considered the amount of trade in the village in summer, when the population swells considerably and visitors abound.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396019208\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/online/2012/7/9/1341841180318/An-ice-cream-van-stands-o-001.jpg\" alt=\"An ice cream van stands on a foggy beach in Whitby\" width=\"120\" height=\"90\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">All alone.

  "<p>Dry ice billows across the stage, shrouding it in almost impenetrable fog. With each flash of the strobe lights, black-clad figures are briefly illuminated, no more distinct than silhouettes. The reticence of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/the-xx\" title=\"\">the xx</a> is absolute: it makes them <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2012/sep/06/the-xx-coexist-review\" title=\"\">undemonstrative on record</a>, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2012/sep/02/the-xx-interview-tom-lamont\" title=\"\">tongue-tied in interview</a>, and shadows in the midst of their own live show.</p> <p>Just as they surely intend, this absence has the effect of bringing their music into sharper focus. Every note played is as bright and precisely chiselled as a cut diamond, no matter how subdued the song in which it's set. Romy Madley Croft's guitar lines are simple but glitter like pools of water in moonlight, trickling across <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/jamie-xx\" title=\"\">Jamie Smith</a>'s crisp electronic drum patterns, chiming steel pans and plangent keyboards reminiscent of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/artist/f22942a1-6f70-4f48-866e-238cb2308fbd\" title=\"\">Aphex Twin</a> at his least confrontational. Oliver Sim's bass fills the spaces between so unobtrusively, you notice it most when he's not playing at all.</p> <p>It's contradictions like these that make the xx so enticing. On their first album, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2009/aug/14/the-xx-cd-review\" title=\"\">2009's xx</a>, they exposed the intensely private, articulated the fillips of the heart that are hardest to voice, and communicated carnality, but ever so innocently. Their second album, Coexist, released on 5 September, does all that again, in a way that is more direct and yet more obfuscatory. Croft's softly crooned declaration of love in <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/musicblog/2012/jul/16/new-music-xx-angels\" title=\"\">Angels</a>, their opening song tonight, could hardly be more plain, but nor could her seemingly vague reference to \"a silent devotion\", words she murmurs in a voice husky with desire, adding: \"I know you know what I mean.\" Skin tingles and muscles flinch with involuntary memories of knowing exactly what she means.</p> <p>For all its complexity, love is a narrow field; their sonic range is limited, too. What holds your attention is the subtlety of the modulations. Midway through the set, songs begin to tumble into each other, Sunset melting into <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtxwvhNYqtg\" title=\"\">Night Time</a>, which tangles with <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32z9VtDHh6w\" title=\"\">Swept Away</a>, which pours into <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3EBzperd_c\" title=\"\">Shelter</a>, as though the music itself were deliquescing in coitus. The xx are not given to showiness, yet there is showmanship here in the sudden rumble of dub bass in <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZhxGCYbyBw\" title=\"\">Fantasy</a> that makes the balconies vibrate and unleashes a shower of silver confetti, or in the crash of percussion emphasised by a blinding glare of light that punctuates <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WT6qbT7xd0\" title=\"\">Infinity</a>. At the end, a huge letter X hovers over the stage, lit within with tiny specks, and for all its severity, it looks like a kiss.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-audio\" data-canonical-url=\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\"> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?button_hashtag=GdnReview\"class=\"twitter-hashtag-button\">Tweet #GdnReview</a> <script>!function(d,s,id){ varjs,fjs=d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];if(!d.getElementById(id)){js=d.createElement(s);js.id=id;js.src=\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\";fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js,fjs);}}(document,\"script\",\"twitter-wjs\");</script> </figure>  <p>What have you been to see lately?

Shell petroleum are responsible for drilling in the Arctic sea. They are drilling in a new area. This must stop, Shell must be held to account. This is an unprecedented disaster we are trying to minimise.\"</p> <p>Another protester said: \"People from different backgrounds have got together. Sea ice is melting and Shell is partly responsible for that.\"</p> <p>The group placed the blocks of ice, each weighing 27kg and transported by a rented refrigerated van, outside Shell's headquarters on London's Southbank. Many of the protesters have previously been involved in similar environmental protests such as the Camp for Climate Action against Kingsnorth coal power station and the third runway at Heathrow.</p> <p>A Shell spokesman said: \"Shell recognises that certain organisations are opposed to our Arctic exploration programme and respect the right of individuals and organisations to engage in a free and frank exchange of views about our operations. We only ask that they do so with their safety and the safety of others, including Shell personnel and customers in mind.\"</p> <p>Shell also added: \"Shell has support from a multitude of stakeholders for our plans to execute a safe and environmentally responsible drilling programme in Alaska's Beaufort and Chukchi Seas. Shell's distinguished offshore record in Alaska, including our prior drilling activities, validates that we are well positioned to work in the Arctic.\"</p> <p>Meanwhile, this week ice scientists are expected to announce a record low for the Arctic sea ice minimum, following <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/aug/27/arctic-sea-ice-shrinks-lowest-extent\" title=\"\">unprecedented melting rates in the region this summer</a>.</p>",

Downsizing, a dwindling sense of personal achievement and continuous criticism from ministers, advisers and select committees may all be factors in recent departures of high profile senior civil servants, he suggests:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Downsizing at this scale and pace inevitably takes a toll on the capacity, energy and emotions of managers and senior leaders. The requirements of consultation, selection for redundancy, matching remaining staff to the remaining posts create a huge management burden on line managers. Overstretched HR functions are left with little capacity to do anything else. It is draining to run comprehensive downsizing programmes.<br>Civil Service managers and their much abused HR colleagues deserve credit for managing big reductions in staff \u2013 up to 30% in little more than 15 months. With the support of the better trade unions this has generally been done as fairly and humanely as you could expect given the pace of reductions.<br>Some who saw this phase through have already seized their voluntary redundancy or even resigned with a sense of relief and sometimes glee \u2013 depending on their age, their ability to get another job, or the respective sizes of their redundancy package, savings and pension.</p> </blockquote> <p>On the public leaders network Kevin Lloyd explains <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/public-leaders-network/2012/sep/11/civil-service-whitehall-voluntary-redundancy\" title=\"\">why he left the civil service</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I don't regret leaving. What I observe about further change in Whitehall suggests that much of it would not have been positive from my perspective. What, for instance, are the consequences of the well-publicised suggestion that ministers should have a say in annual appraisals and the emergence of ministers on departmental boards that will be considering a whole range of organisational arrangements?<br>It is probably not too fanciful to see the odd sign that being a civil servant, certainly at very senior levels, is now viewed by some less as a vocation and a career and more as a philanthropic gesture once the hard yards have been done in business or finance.</p> </blockquote> <p><br>Lloyd will be on the panel for a public leaders discussion on Thursday about <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/public-leaders-network/2012/sep/06/civil-service-talent-getting-out\" title=\"\">whether the civil service is failing its talent</a></p> <p>\u2022 Defining <strong>social enterprise</strong>. Following the news that computing specialist Salesforce.com has given up an effort to trademark the term \"social enterprise,\" David Floyd on his Beanbags and Bullsh!t blog admits he is <a href=\"http://beanbagsandbullsh1t.com/2012/09/09/may-salesforce-be-with-you/\" title=\"\">sceptical about the idea that we need a definition of social enterprise</a>. </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Frankly, I couldn't care less if, at various points in the past, woolly definition of social enterprise has led to private sector businesses receiving some free business planning training or a free Business Link mouse-mat. It's more of an issue when there's important services and serious cash involved.<br>There's also the Public Services (Social Value) Act 2012, which will come in force next year. While being a social enterprise is no guarantee of providing additional social value, and not being a social enterprise is no guarantee of not providing additional social value, it seems likely that the fact that an organisation is a social enterprise may be a factor in commissioners' considerations under the act.<br>The growth of the social investment market \u2013 however skeptical some of us might be about the way it's currently developing \u2013 is another good reason for 'a social enterprise' to be defined for tax purposes.<br>I think the time has come for clear, inclusive legal definition that enables organisations to register as 'a social enterprise' and be regulated accordingly. </p> </blockquote> <p><br>\u2022 An interesting piece on <strong>mental health and the internet</strong> by Vanessa Bartlett for Mind's blog.

Although I had reached a point where I was ready to start externalising some of my experiences, telling close family and friends how I was really feeling was still too daunting. So I told the internet instead.<br>Two years after starting my blog, I am completing a research qualification where I am considering the value of using online writing to help with mental health issues. During my studies, I have found plenty of evidence to suggest that confiding in a computer can be just as intimate as talking to a therapist.</p> </blockquote> <p><br>(thanks to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SpenceratUKCP\" title=\"\">Spencer Gasson</a> for the link)</p> <h2>Other news</h2> <p>\u2022 BBC: <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-19548597\" title=\"\">UK schools 'most socially segregated'</a><br>\u2022 Children &amp; Young People Now: <a href=\"http://www.cypnow.co.uk/cyp/news/1074587/parental-alcohol-misuse-more-damaging-drugs-warns-childrens-commissioner\" title=\"\">Parental alcohol misuse 'more damaging than drugs', warns children's commissioner</a><br>\u2022 CivilSociety: <a href=\"http://www.civilsociety.co.uk/governance/news/content/13346/boris_johnson_appoints_former_evening_standard_editor_as_volunteering_adviser\" title=\"\">Boris Johnson appoints former Evening Standard editor as volunteering adviser</a><br>\u2022 Community Care: <a href=\"http://www.communitycare.co.uk/blogs/social-work-blog/2012/09/why-social-work-students-shoul.html\" title=\"\">Why social work students should read newspapers</a><br>\u2022 Independent: <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/how-cleggs-growth-fund-makes-jobs--at-200000-a-time-8122411.html\" title=\"\">How Clegg's growth fund makes jobs \u2013 at \u00a3200,000 a time</a><br>\u2022 Inside Housing: <a href=\"http://www.InsideHousing.co.uk/development/%E2%80%98radical-tax-reform%E2%80%99-needed-to-fix-housing-market/6523669.article\" title=\"\">'Radical tax reform' needed to fix housing market</a><br>\u2022 LocalGov.co.uk: <a href=\"http://www.localgov.co.uk/index.cfm?method=news.detail&amp;id=106873\" title=\"\">LEPs need more private sector help to succeed</a><br>\u2022 Public Finance: <a href=\"http://www.publicfinance.co.uk/news/2012/09/nhs-unions-must-be-creative-and-brave-to-keep-national-pay/\" title=\"\">NHS unions must be 'creative and brave' to keep national pay</a><br>\u2022 Telegraph: <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/crime/9534107/Check-your-sons-bedrooms-for-knives-says-father-of-boy-stabbed-at-Facebook-party.html\" title=\"\">Check your sons' bedrooms for knives, says father of boy stabbed at Facebook party</a><br>\u2022 Third Sector: <a href=\"http://www.thirdsector.co.uk/Fundraising/article/1149098/remember-charity-launches-plaques-recognise-projects-made-possible-legacy-giving/\" title=\"\">Remember A Charity launches plaques to recognise projects made possible by legacy giving</a></p> <h2>SocietyGuardian blogs</h2> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/patrick-butler-cuts-blog\" title=\"\">Patrick Butler's cuts blog</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/sarah-boseley-global-health\" title=\"\">Sarah Boseley's global health blog</a></p> <h2>SocietyGuardian on social media</h2> <p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/SocietyGuardian\" title=\"\">Follow SocietyGuardian on Twitter</a><br><a href=\"http://twitter.com/patrickjbutler\" title=\"\">Follow Patrick Butler on Twitter</a><br><a href=\"http://twitter.com/#!/clare_horton\" title=\"Follow Clare Horton on Twitter\">Follow Clare Horton on Twitter</a><br><a href=\"http://twitter.com/#!/AlisonBenjamin1\" title=\"Follow Alison Benjamin on Twitter\">Follow Alison Benjamin on Twitter</a><br><a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/societyguardian\" title=\"Facebook page\">SocietyGuardian's Facebook page</a></p> <h2>SocietyGuardian weekly section</h2> <p>SocietyGuardian editor: <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/alisonbenjamin\" title=\"Alison Benjamin\">Alison Benjamin</a><br>Email the SocietyGuardian editor: <a href=\"mailto:society@guardian.co.uk\" title=\"\">society@guardian.co.uk</a></p>",
  "<p>Eskimo is said \u2013 incorrectly \u2013 to have a dozen words for snow but cryologists have a vast lexicon of terms for different types of ice. Strangely, many are associated with food and cooking.</p> <p>According to the Mariners' Handbook, the bible of British Admiralty publications, the first new sea ice of the season is known as shuga ice which, depending on the temperature, salinity and snowfall, may coalesce to become frazil ice, grease ice or even slush ice.</p> <p>As temperatures drop, and the sea ice becomes older and takes on different shapes from the wind and the currents, it acquires a host of other names. Ice formed in the first season is called young, or first year ice, and includes rind ice and nilas ice \u2013 which looks like long thin glass sheets \u2013 as well as pancake ice and cake ice.</p> <p>Sea ice is either fast ice \u2013 which does not move around \u2013 or drift ice which does. But as we've seen this week, there's also brash ice, multi-year ice, heavily ridged ice and pack ice, open, close and very close ice, as well as grey, grounded, hostile, hummocked, rotten and consolidated ice. Not forgetting ice bergs and ice floes. Different ice forms may contain polynyas, sastrugi, rams and rimes and you can have bergy bits, finger-rafting, growlers, breccia and ice blinks. All have different properties, shapes, sizes and formations.</p> <p>It's specialised stuff. Sea ice experts might regularly say things like: \"Do you know there is a polynya in the Laptek sea?\" But permafrost folk who know land-based ice would not understand. Instead, one might respond: \"Do you mean a pingo?\"</p> <p>Cambridge sea ice scientist Nick Toberg adds two Russian terms which he says are not in the British vocabulary but are widely used. One is stamukha, sea ice that has run ashore, and the other is ropak, a vertical slab.</p> <p>So <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/blog/2012/sep/06/history-sea-greenpeace-arctic-sunrise\" title=\"\">here on the Arctic journey I embarked on last week aboard Greenpeace's Arctic Sunrise vessel</a>, you really do need a pilot who understands his ice to navigate. We have Arne Sorensen, a Dane who has spent 30 years captaining ice-breaking ships with the Australian Navy, Greenpeace and others way up north of Greenland.</p> <p>He's seen the northern polar ice rapidly change in the summer months.</p> <blockquote> \"The line marked on many maps as 'permanent ice' is really just a line of averages, as far as it normally recedes. In the past when it had receded to that line it was roughly half old ice and half first-year ice. Now, no more than one-third or a quarter, is old ice. I would say roughly half the ice by area and possibly 75% by volume has now gone.\" </blockquote> <p>When you travel through sea ice, he says, you first judge its thickness by seeing how much sticks out of the water, like with an iceberg when they say that 90% is below the water line. The higher it is out of the water, the thicker it is. And the older it is, the harder it usually is because the salts drain out and it compacts. But, he says, it's not necessarily old just because it's thick, and vice versa.</p> <blockquote> \"Then, he says you judge the colour. If its blueish, its probably older ice. Young ice is full of sharp angles. Older ice is more rounded because of the melt. Young ice can still be thick because of the pressure ridges which form where the ice is compressed together. Older ice is smoothed at the edges by the wind and the waves. <br> \"The further into the ice you go, the quieter it gets. We are looking for stable ice - old ice at least two metres thick [for the scientists and Greenpeace to work on].\" </blockquote> <p>It helps if the ice pilot knows his ship, too. Sorensen knows the Arctic Sunrise better than most. He has captained it many times and was partly responsible for Greenpeace buying it in 1997 and converting it from a sealing ship.</p> <p>He's confident of it in most ice conditions. \"It can break ice that is at least 50cm thick and keep going. It's best at making a path through substantial floes,\" he says.</p> <p>Which is just what we've been doing for the last 24 hours.</p>",
  "<p>Britain's trade position improved in July after a sharp rise in exports to countries outside the European Union.</p> <p>Exports to non-EU countries increased by \u00a31.3bn to \u00a313.2bn and imports fell almost \u00a31bn to \u00a316.1bn, helping the UK's overall trade deficit ease to \u00a31.5bn from June's \u00a34.3bn.</p> <p>The Office for National Statistics said the UK's deficit in trade in goods narrowed to \u00a37.1bn in July, down from \u00a310.1bn in June.</p> <p>However, experts cautioned that depressed demand for imports from beleaguered UK consumers played a large part in the better-than-expected figures along with a jump in exports to the EU that is unlikely to be sustained.</p> <p>Jason Conibear, trading director at the foreign exchange dealer Cambridge Mercantile, said: \"The improving trade deficit cannot be attributed solely to a tubthumping boost in British exports.</p> <p>\"Anaemic demand at home and a modest uptick in demand for British goods across the Channel are not enough to set the corks popping on the English sparkling wine just yet.\"</p> <p>Chris Williamson, chief economist at financial data provider Markit, was also gloomy about the prospects for a sustained improvement in the balance of trade. He said: \"Looking through the strong volatility in the numbers over recent months, the data also highlights the underlying weakness of demand both at home and in the UK's main export markets. Any improvement will wane in the fourth quarter unless economic conditions pick up at home and abroad soon.\"</p> <p>Ministers are understood to remain concerned that UK exports have failed to move into surplus after the 25% cut in the value of the pound that followed the financial crash in 2008. The deteriorating position of the eurozone nations has hit UK exports, but unlike Germany, the UK has so far failed to break into far eastern markets and emerging countries in South America to increase sales.</p> <p>The positive balance of trade in services, which has for decades offset the large deficit in goods, slipped in July to \u00a35.6bn from \u00a35.5bn in June and remains well below the \u00a36.4bn it contributed last July.</p> <p>But the government will be cheered by the boost to non-EU exports after running a high profile export drive across several countries including Brazil and Mexico to improve UK exports. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/sep/25/henry-porter-cameron-british-identity\" title=\"\">The Great campaign</a>, which has enlisted the support of Prince Harry and ministers from several departments, is an attempt to showcase the quality of British goods and services in countries where the UK has only a toe-hold of sales.</p>",

  "<p>The UK has four of the top six universities in the latest edition of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/table/2012/sep/11/top-200-qs-world-university-rankings-2012\" title=\"\">QS World University Rankings</a>, but the <a href=\"http://www.topuniversities.com/institution/massachusetts-institute-technology-mit\" title=\"\">Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)</a> has taken over from Cambridge in first place.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.topuniversities.com/institution/university-cambridge\" title=\"\">Cambridge</a> has dropped to second place after two years heading the rankings, but remains ahead of <a href=\"http://www.topuniversities.com/institution/harvard-university\" title=\"\">Harvard</a>, the only other university to have led the table in its nine years of publication. The other UK universities in the top six are <a href=\"http://www.topuniversities.com/institution/ucl-university-college-london\" title=\"\">University College London</a>, <a href=\"http://www.topuniversities.com/institution/university-oxford\" title=\"\">Oxford</a> and <a href=\"http://www.topuniversities.com/institution/imperial-college-london\" title=\"\">Imperial College London</a>.</p> <p>Perhaps the biggest revelation in the rankings, however, concerns the increasingly international character of the leading universities. Despite consistent growth in the number of international students over the past decade, the new rankings show the top 100 universities raising recruitment by almost 10% in a single year.</p> <p>The figures suggest that students looking for an overseas education are becoming more choosy about where they go. And they confirm growing competition for international students \u2013 and reliance on their fees - in leading universities all over the world, not just in the traditional host countries.</p> <p>Even some universities in the top 100, like Cambridge, that have registered modest increases in overseas student numbers, have been overtaken on this measure. The top 500 universities in the QS rankings have added no fewer than 120,000 international students in the latest edition.</p> <p>The figures demonstrate why universities of all types were so concerned at the UK government's tightening of visa regulations, culminating in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/blog/2012/aug/30/lmu-student-recruitment-teaching-learning\" title=\"\">the suspension of London Metropolitan University's licence to sponsor students from outside the EU</a>. University College London, which has overtaken Oxford to move into fourth place, has almost 10,000 international students.</p> <p>It is growth in international faculty that accounts for MIT's move to the top of the rankings for the first time, however. The university has overtaken both Cambridge and neighbouring Harvard to take first place, having led 11 of the 29 subject rankings published by QS in June.</p> <p>MIT is one of a number of universities specialising in science and technology to improve their positions this year. Nine of the top ten technological universities have moved further up the rankings, with the <a href=\"http://www.topuniversities.com/institution/kaist-korea-advanced-institute-science-technology\" title=\"\">Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology</a> enjoying the biggest rise in the top 100.</p> <p>Scores in the QS rankings comprise an equal balance of expert opinion and data on staffing levels, research citations and international students and faculty. More than 46,000 academics and 25,000 employers have contributed their views in the most extensive polling ever undertaken on global universities.</p> <p>American universities dominate the QS rankings, as they have every year since they were first published in 2004. US institutions occupy six of the top ten places, 13 of the top 20 and 31 of the top 100 \u2013 the same numbers as last year.</p> <p>Harvard, in third place, remains the favourite of both academics and employers. It also tops four of the five broad faculty rankings <a href=\"http://www.topuniversities.com\" title=\"\">published with the institutional ranking</a>.</p> <p>The UK is again the next most successful country, although it has lost one university from the top 20, one from the top 100 and one from the top 200. Its four universities in the top ten and 18 in the top 100 show a system continuing to punch well above its weight.</p> <p>The strong performance of UK universities will surprise some observers but, with research funding protected in cash terms and revenue from international students rising, the leading institutions have not experienced the level of cuts suffered by some of their competitors. Even the wealthy US Ivy League institutions have reined back spending as they tried to repair the damage done to their endowments during the recession.</p> <p>Academics and employers continue to rate UK universities highly and the leading institutions have begun to make significant progress on the key measure of research quality \u2013 the number of citations per academic. All but three of the top 20 UK universities achieved higher citation rates than last year, although they still have ground to make up on their American counterparts.</p> <p>The results will give little encouragement to those predicting a wave of UK student emigration to the universities of Continental Europe, where fees are much lower than in England. The nine leading French universities have all dropped down the ranking, while there are no German or Dutch universities in the top 50. <a href=\"http://www.topuniversities.com/institution/eth-zurich-swiss-federal-institute-technology\" title=\"\">ETH Zurich</a> is by far the highest-placed Continental university, at 13th.</p> <p>Canada has two universities in the top 20 for the first time, with <a href=\"http://www.topuniversities.com/institution/university-toronto\" title=\"\">Toronto</a> joining Montreal's <a href=\"http://www.topuniversities.com/institution/mcgill-university\" title=\"\">McGill University</a> among the elite. But Australia again has more universities in the top 100 than any country outside the US and UK.</p> <p>Asian universities continue to make progress up the rankings and to attract more international students, rather than simply being the favoured recruiting ground of Western institutions. <a href=\"http://www.topuniversities.com/institution/university-hong-kong\" title=\"\">Hong Kong University</a>, the <a href=\"http://www.topuniversities.com/institution/national-university-singapore-nus\" title=\"\">National University of Singapore</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.topuniversities.com/institution/university-tokyo\" title=\"\">University of Tokyo</a> all appear in the top 30.</p> <p>A record 72 countries are represented among the 700 universities that will feature in the full ranking. The six leading universities in the Middle East have all improved their positions and there has been a big increase in the number of Latin American universities ranked globally.</p> <p>Overall, the institutional ranking is more stable than it has ever been. There is only one new entrant to the top 20 and the average movement in the top 100 is 4.6 places, while in the top 200 the average is 9.1.</p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by </strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/guardian-professional\" title=\"\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

This is what he's going to say a about the subject at a reception tonight.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Continued trouble in the economy gives the bigots a stick to beat us with, as they demand we \u201cpostpone\u201d the equalities agenda in order to deal with \u201cthe things people really care about\u201d. As if pursuing greater equality and fixing the economy simply cannot happen at once.</p> <p>So I want you to hear it straight from me tonight: the idea that the two are mutually exclusive is utter rubbish. A nonsense this Coalition government will never bow to.</p> <p>For starters \u2013 we had 228,000 responses to our consultation on equal marriage. That\u2019s more than any other we\u2019ve found in the records. The next biggest was high speed rail, at just 50,000. Not everyone in those 228,000 will be pro, that\u2019s for sure. But you certainly can\u2019t dispute the strong feeling on both sides.</p> <p>And, even more importantly, whether equal marriage is being discussed around your kitchen table or not, it matters because it cuts to the heart of who we are.</p> <p>We have spent the summer witnessing Britain at it\u2019s best. The Olympics and Paralympics were wonderful not just because of the Team GB medal haul, but because \u2013 after decades of agonising over our national identity \u2013 they brought it into focus. We saw the forces of openness and tolerance reclaim the Union Jack. We showcased ourselves not as big and imperial and imposing, a nation constantly harking back to some bygone age. But as a nation that revels in its warmth; that is intelligent; diverse, generous and joyous; a nation able to own the future and lead the world because we have the right spirit, the right values, the right ideas.</p> <p>And of all those ideas, none can be more fundamental than the belief that people should be able to love whomever they choose; that we should let one another be, free from discrimination and able to enjoy the full equality that is each of our right.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-09-11T14:48:32.436Z\">at 3.48pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-504f4db1c0e312b4deaa481b\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-09-11T14:43:43.155Z\">3.43pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>It must be junior appointments day because Grant Shapps, the Conservative chairman, has just announced some vice chairmen jobs.

The TUC is also expected to back a motion to explore the \u201cpracticalities\u201d of staging a general strike. Echoing comments by Ed Miliband at a TUC dinner on Monday night, Balls told delegates that walkouts would be unpopular with the rank and file as well as the public. \u201cI am sure that the last thing the vast majority of trade union members want, at a time of such uncertainty, is strikes over the coming months.

Giving evidence to the home affairs committee, he said that G4S delivers 80% of pound notes used by shoppers and that it reads 80% of meters. It also runs hospitals and prisons, he says. Asked if he would resign, he said there was an internal inquiry into what went wrong and he would discuss his future with the board when that was completed.</p> <p><strong>\u2022 Ofqual has confirmed that it forced Edexcel, an exam board, to toughen its GCSE English grade boundaries.</strong> Ofqual executives were giving evidence to the Commons education committee as the Times Educational Supplement published leaked correspondence between Ofqual and Edexcel.

These hearings are supposed to perform an investigatory function, allowing MPs to find out what happened and why, but this morning Glenys Stacey, the Ofqual chief regulator, splatted the committee with gobbledygook. I certainly found it hard to follow what she was saying and, although it's quite possible that I was being dim, I did get the impression that members of the committee did not have a forensic understanding of what she was saying either.&#xa0;</p> <p>But it was not entirely hopeless. You always learn something during these hearings and today was no exception. Here are the main points.</p> <p><strong>\u2022 Ofqual has admitted that it contacted two exam boards, Edexcel and WJEC, because it thought their English results were too high.</strong> Stacey said there was a particular problem with Edexcel.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Edexcel - the preliminary results were high. If the provisional results had been left to stand I think we were looking at 6% or 7% inflation and I suspect there would have been a different outcry had that been the outcome. They were certainly out of line with the other awarding body results.</p> </blockquote> <p>She said that Edexcel accepted Ofqual's demand for it to raise its grade boundaries. If Edexcel had refused, Ofqual could have forced it to comply she said.</p> <p><strong>\u2022 Ofqual has said that it was surprised that schools had such high expectations for their GCSE English results this year.</strong> The point was made by Amanda Spielman, the Ofqual chair.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>You might have thought that this year, in the first year of a completely different exam, schools would be a bit more cautious about their predictions and have brought them down a bit. I\u2019m not saying it is the schools\u2019 fault, I\u2019m saying school expectations were in a very different place. We would have expected in the face of a new specification to see schools being more cautious and what we actually saw was that school expectations for Cs went up by 2%.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>\u2022 Ofqual has said that further education colleges were hit particularly hard by the decision to toughen grade boundaries in GCSE English.</strong></p> <p><strong>\u2022 Ofqual's chair has said that t<a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/education/education-news/gcses-will-be-regraded-for-pupils-in-wales--but-ofqual-refuses-to-reassess-the-grades-in-england-8122408.html\">he Welsh government decided to regrade its English papers</a> for political reasons.</strong> It was embarrassing for them to accept poor results, Spielman said.</p> <p><strong>\u2022 Ofqual has said that it is wiling to release details of all its correspondence and calls with the Department for Education, including Michael Gove and his advisers.</strong> There was no political interference in its decision to toughen grade boundaries, Stacey said.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-09-11T11:46:34.334Z\">at 12.46pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-504f1bd858f94f441baa7a3e\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-09-11T11:09:14.076Z\">12.09pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The Times Educational Supplement has now published in full<a href=\"http://www.tes.co.uk/tesassets/images/resources/Ofqual_Edexcel_Documents_2012.pdf\"> the leaked letters (pdf)</a> that formed the basis of <a href=\"http://www.tes.co.uk/article.aspx?storyCode=6289695\">its story saying Ofqual ordered Edexcel to raise its grade boundaries.</a></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-504f1addc0e312b4deaa4803\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-09-11T11:05:02.140Z\">12.05pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Ofqual submitted written evidence to the education committee before this morning's hearing.

And for some schools the results are a far cry from their expectations.\" <br>The report says it is important to note that \"there has been no political interference\". <br>And it insists that the regulator played its \"proper role, regulating standards\". <br>\"Awarding in January and before was generous, but neither exam boards nor the regulators could have seen it at the time. <br>\"All the evidence at the time was that awarding decisions were if anything harsh.\"</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-504f19d7c0e312b4deaa4802\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-09-11T11:00:41.034Z\">12.00pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The hearing is over.

I hear indiscriminate arguments against a freeze on all public sector pay and in defence of all pension deals.</p> <p>I am wary of using personal anecdotes but while I was at the Edinburgh Festival I bumped into old friends in their early fifties with public sector pensions so generous that I cannot compete with their lifestyles. They were between foreign holidays, recommended lavish restaurants, enjoyed the theatres and good wine. One told me that she had been offered a pension only a few pounds lower than her monthly salary. It was too good to refuse. The drinks were on her, but I won\u2019t support strikes so that there will be many more drinks on people like her.</p> <p>Similarly, some in the public sector earn wages they do not deserve, with responsibilities so ill-defined they are lucky to get away with a pay freeze. They \u201cwork\u201d side by side with those who are appallingly paid and who work very hard. But the sweeping calls for a strike over \u201ccuts\u201d or a \u201cfreeze\u201d are impossible to sustain in the current climate or, frankly, in any climate.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/conservative/9533475/Why-Conservative-radicals-are-uniting-for-victory.html\">\u2022 Don Porter, a former chairman of the National Conservative Convention, in the Daily Telegraph explains what the new group, Conservative Voice, will seek to achieve.</a></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We intend to provide practical help to radical Conservative candidates fighting in local, regional, national and European elections. This is not about replacing Lord Ashcroft\u2019s previous support to candidates in winnable seats. It is about supporting those same candidates with advice and counsel from seasoned campaigners about everything from harnessing social media and local media relations to how to build great campaign teams.</p> <p>Any political party needs to continue to adapt and learn. The Conservative campaigning operation has always been a force to be reckoned with, but we cannot \u2013 and must not \u2013 stand still. So we also want to help the party to develop new campaigning techniques and to learn from around the world. I believe this practical aid \u2013 on the ground \u2013 will ensure more Tory candidates win seats across the board.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/opinion/columnists/rachelsylvester/article3534123.ece\">\u2022 Rachel Sylvester in the Times (paywall) says that \u201cBrand Boris\u201d is stronger than ever, but that it is also flawed.</a></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There is a flaw in the brand. It\u2019s based on authenticity when there is something phoney about the Mayor. Mr Johnson is a super-smart, hard-working and ultra-ambitious politician pretending to be an upper-class buffoon. He is Niccolo Machiavelli, if you like, masquerading as <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gussie_Fink-Nottle\">Gussie Fink-Nottle.</a> His is also a reputation untested by the competing demands and multifarious pressures of national office.

I have not read the full text yet, but according to extracts released overnight, he is going to propose a crackdown on bogus self-employment - workers being falsely categorised as self-employed. This allows employers to avoid tax, but it also means workers lose benefits like sick pay and holiday pay. It is a particular problem in the construction industry and is said to cost the Exchequer \u00a3350m a year.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>On the issue of bogus self-employment, in the construction sector and more widely, I am determined that we look at this issue again.</p> <p>There is a careful balance to be struck. I do not want in any way to undermine genuine self-employment. But nor should contractual arrangements be distorted and misrepresented to avoid tax and undermine terms and conditions. It\u2019s not fair to taxpayers. And it\u2019s not fair to your members either.</p> <p>So I have asked the Shadow Chief Secretary, Rachel Reeves, to look again at the then Treasury's 2009 proposals for reform \u2013 abandoned by this government \u2013 and to consult employers, UCATT and the wider TUC to see if there is a better and fairer way forward.</p> </blockquote> <p>But the full speech seems more wide-ranging.

He should heed calls for an independent inquiry, and take urgent action to address this blatant unfairness.</p> </blockquote> <p>Last month Twigg was just asking for a parliamentary inquiry.

Tomorrow the committee will take evidence from Michael Gove, the education secretary, and this morning it is taking evidence from Ofqual, the exams regulator. To coincide with the hearing, <a href=\"http://www.tes.co.uk/article.aspx?storyCode=6289695\">the Times Educational Supplement has published an exclusive story saying that Ofqual ordered an exam board to raise its grade boundaries for English GCSE.</a> Here\u2019s an extract.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>England\u2019s qualifications watchdog forced an exam board to make significant changes to GCSE English grades examiners had insisted were \u201cfair\u201d just two weeks before the publication of this summer\u2019s controversial results, TES has learned.</p> <p>Ofqual\u2019s intervention - which contradicts a key finding from its inquiry into the marking crisis - has prompted calls from a former Ofqual board member for chief regulator Glenys Stacey to resign, describing her position as \u201cuntenable\u201d.</p> <p>June\u2019s grade boundaries were correct and set by examiners \u201cusing their best professional judgement, taking into account all of the evidence available to them,\u201d Ms Stacey concluded when publishing Ofqual\u2019s inquiry report ten days ago. But letters between Ofqual and exam board Edexcel, seen by TES, reveal that examiners\u2019 professional judgement was actually overruled by the regulator.</p> <p>Ofqual ordered Edexcel to dramatically toughen up its English GCSE grade boundary despite strong protests from the board that its original decision was \u201cfair\u201d and backed by \u201ccompelling evidence\u201d. The last minute changes will have led to many pupils missing out on crucial C grades.</p> </blockquote> <p>I\u2019ll be covering the Ofqual hearing in detail.</p> <p>But there\u2019s lots of other politics around today too.

As Nicholas Watt reports, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2012/sep/11/tory-group-cameron-detoxifying-values\">it will tell David Cameron to spend less time on modernising and detoxifying the Conservative brand and focus more attention on core Tory values if the party is to win the next election.</a></p> <p><em>10am</em>: Ed Balls, the shadow chancellor, gives a speech to the TUC conference.</p> <p><em>10.15am:</em> Glenys Stacey, the Ofqual chief regulator, and other Ofqual executives give evidence to the Commons education committee about the GCSE grading row.</p> <p><em>10.15am:</em> Bernard Hogan-Howe, the Metropolitan police commissioner, gives evidence to the Commons home affairs committee about Olympics security. The committee is also hearing from Paul Deighton, Locog\u2019s chief executive, and Lord Coe, its chair, at 11am; from Charles Farr, director of the office for security and counter-terrorism at the Home Office at 11.45am: and from Nick Buckles, the G4S chief executive, at 12.30pm.</p> <p><em>12.30pm:</em> David Cameron and Owen Paterson, the new environment secretary, host an event marking 70 companies signing up to provide training and work placements for young people in the food industry.</p> <p><em>1pm:</em> Vince Cable, the business secretary, gives a speech setting out his industrial strategy. As Patrick Wintour reports,<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2012/sep/10/cable-business-bank-industrial-strategy\"> he will say that the government will set up a British business bank.</a></p> <p><em>1.30pm:</em> Theresa May, the home secretary, gives a speech to the police superintendents\u2019 annual conference.</p> <p><em>2.30pm:</em> George Osborne, the chancellor, takes questions in the Commons.</p> <p>As usual, I'll be covering all the breaking political news, as well as looking at the papers and bringing you the best politics from the web.
