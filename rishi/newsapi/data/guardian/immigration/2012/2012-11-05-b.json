  "<p>There was no answer even after the third ring but the canvassers did not budge from the door. There was a waft of cooking and muffled sound of children. \"Patience is a science, like baking,\" said Cheryl Lawrence, a pastry cook-turned political activist. \"Get it right and the cake doesn't collapse.\"</p> <p>Eventually the door opened. Zelalem Woldetadik, an Ethiopian-American identified as a likely Obama voter, said yes, she would vote for the president. \"And your husband, Dinkos?\" asked Lawrence, consulting her printed database. \"Him too,\" replied Woldetadik.</p> <p>Lawrence made sure the woman knew the polling centre location and left a clutch of leaflets. \"We'll be back here again until we know she's voted. Just to make sure.\"</p> <p>Barack Obama won Nevada by a whopping 12.5 points in 2008 but it has since endured one of the country's highest unemployment and foreclosure rates, giving Republicans a chance to wrest the state's six electoral college votes.</p> <p>Mitt Romney's strategy, backed by field offices and a Super PAC advertising blitz, is to mobilise rural and Mormon Republicans in huge numbers, sway a majority of voters in swing Washoe county and dent Obama's lead in populous Clark county, which includes Las Vegas.</p> <p>The Democrats and their union allies have responded by registering 90,000 more voters than Republicans, mostly in Clark county, and prodding them into early voting. They were boosted by a fast growing Latino population which shudders at Romney's stance on immigration.</p> <p>Their extensive ground game \u2013 reflected in the likes of Lawrence visiting and revisiting households until they vote \u2013 appears to be paying off. Democrats have a 48,000 lead in the 700,000 people who voted by last week.</p> <p>With only about 300,000 more votes expected to be cast (for a total of around 1m), Obama will probably win, reckoned Jon Ralston, the dean of Nevada political analysts and an electoral sage.</p> <p>\"[Republicans] need everything to break right \u2013 President Obama haemorrhages Democrats and independents vote in huge numbers for Romney, two things I do not see happening.\" No matter how good the Republican turnout on Tuesday, <a href=\"http://www.ralstonflash.com/blog/obama-will-win-state-heller-will-barely-squeak-horsford-takes-cd4-and-gop-will-take-state\" title=\"\">Obama will hold the state 50% to Romney's 46%</a>, Ralston predicted.</p> <p>Obama has visited Nevada 10 times this year, including a rally in Las Vegas last week. Romney has visited eight times since April, and his running mate Paul Ryan five times, including a visit to Reno on Monday.</p> <p>\"Nevada we are counting on you,\" Ryan told a cheering crowd inside an aviation hanger. \"We know you can do this. We can do this together. Lets run through the tape. Lets leave it all on the field.\"</p> <p>Romney also dispatched his Spanish-speaking son Craig to tour the state and woo Latino voters, hammering the message that the economy will recover faster under his father.</p> <p>Texas governor Rick Perry, who lost to Romney in the Republican primaries, campaigned for him in Las Vegas in recent days and insisted the GOP was on course for victory.</p> <p>\"Our voters historically vote on election day,\" he told reporters. \"<a href=\"http://politics.blogs.foxnews.com/2012/11/05/team-romney-battles-nevada-amid-obamas-advantage-numbers-early-voting\" title=\"\">Their voters vote during early periods</a>, so these early votes don't cause me great consternation.\"</p>",
  "<p>\u2022 They knew him for his presence and his sharp suits; thus many noted the contrast between the ebullient figure of old and the forlorn figure seen ambling into the Commons yesterday. Dressed down, thoughtful, hopefully rueful, Denis MacShane keeps his Commons pass until the authorities receive notice from the Treasury that he is no longer an MP. That's a tad delayed because George Osborne is in Mexico. Until then, nothing to do but clear the office, mourn, regret.</p> <p>\u2022 But don't count him out. Nothing is impossible. He was famously <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-20189599\" title=\"\">sacked by the BBC</a> in 1977 for using a pseudonym to call the programme he worked on and accuse the Conservative politician Reginald Maudling of being a crook. Colleagues at the World Service, where he pitched up next, remember that he bounced back quickly. One recalls seeing a flyer bearing his photograph with the word \"victim\" in bold print beneath it. From then on, they styled him Victim MacShane.</p> <p>\u2022 After his broadside against windfarms, the word is out on the energy minster <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/nov/01/john-hayes-energy-wind-renewables\" title=\"\">John Hayes</a>. Big Dave must \"decide if Hayes has a future in the energy department\", demands Caroline Lucas, sage on all things green. But the minister isn't daft. Perhaps he speaks in the knowledge that \"dark forces\" stand ready to defend him. From the court circular, we learn that shortly after blowing his smoke about windfarms, Hayes was to be found at Clarence House with that other scourge of windfarms and backstage string-puller extraordinaire Prince Charles. Good friend to have. No wonder Hayes isn't scared of the Greens or Big Dave.</p> <p>\u2022 Life's tough today. Tomorrow tougher.

How things have unravelled for the go-to guy of the good and great. He bought into the half-baked official Newsnight explanation for dropping the inquiry into the doings of Jimmy Savile, thus damaging his own credibility. And what does he do on quieter days? Well one part of his portfolio is to sit on the advisory board of his old school, St Benedict's in Ealing, whose former headmaster, Dom David Pearce, was jailed for five years in 2009 for sexual abuse offences. Three years have passed, but the issue never goes away. And how can it, given the involvement of that other troubled clergyman <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2011/nov/09/monks-schoool-abuse-st-benedict-ealing\" title=\"\">Laurence Soper</a>, wanted in connection with alleged sexual offences committed at St Benedict's? Soper did a runner. Where he is now? Nobody knows.</p> <p>\u2022 Of course he is innocent until proven guilty, but doing a flit has done nothing very good for his reputation and not much for those around him. Two weeks have passed since we pointed out that he is still on the list of honorary fellows at St Mary's University College in Twickenham; but the web listing endures, despite, we are told, the continuing unease and protests of both staff and students. Somebody seems to be watching over him, wherever he is.</p> <p>\u2022 First the death, then the shock. After the shock, the re-evaluation. Eric Hobsbawm is gone but his work lives on and amid the grief, the re-evaluation is ongoing. \"Hobsbawm has, in my view, done more damage to young people than Jimmy Savile,\" <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/8ca0891c-2349-11e2-a46b-00144feabdc0.html\" title=\"\">declared</a> the writer AN Wilson in the FT. Hyperbole apart, Savile will be the future yardstick for all manner of loathsome things.</p> <p>\u2022 Finally, it's hooray for Boris part 836. Yesterday he was named the <a href=\"http://www.standard.co.uk/news/london/the-influentials-boris-rides-on-the-olympic-wave-8282021.html\" title=\"\">most influential person in London</a> by the Evening Standard for the third year running.

Tell us about your favourite Sunday in London was the theme. \"I'd take my family to the Savoy for breakfast,\" he said, but with one look at his ashen-faced press officer he realised his mistake. \"Can we do that again,\" he said, halting the recording.

  "<p>Kevin Blair is the sort of voter Obama and Romney want most \u2013 an undecided in the swing state of Colorado. Trouble is he doesn't want either of them. \"It sucks that we're stuck with these two schmucks.\"</p> <p>Despite the candidates claiming to represent radically different visions for America, the 28-year-old international affairs student sees depressing similarities in their economic and foreign policies.</p> <p>\"Our drone strikes are killing civilians, it's appalling.\" Blair is leaning more towards Obama but is not sure he will have the stomach to vote for him.</p> <p>Such undecided voters are a small, dwindling band in Colorado but they are enough to drive a frantic last minute push by both campaigns. The state has just nine electoral college votes but is perhaps the most finely balanced of all the races, a statistical tie which both sides believe could be decided by just a few thousand votes.</p> <p>That's why Obama, Joe Biden, Romney and Paul Ryan have collectively made eight trips here in the past four days, holding rallies in different places to squeeze every last drop of support.</p> <p>The president made his last appearance here at Aurora on Sunday night, giving 20,000 supporters who braved plunging temperatures a similar version of the barnstorming speech he gave 35 miles away in Boulder on Thursday.</p> <p>Romney made his final appearance at the Comfort Dental Amphitheatre on Saturday, packing in 17,000 supporters, and left Ryan to shore things up with a raucous rally at Castle Rock on Sunday and a final event at Johnson's Corner on Monday.</p> <p>Colorado is a big square but most people live \"on the line\", a north to south strip of towns and cities in the middle sandwiched between mountain and desert, providing a relatively easy population corridor for the campaigns.</p> <p>The state is divided between liberal bastions like Boulder, a university town, and conservative citadels like Colorado Springs and Pueblo, rife with religious and military sentiment. The challenge for each campaign is to mobilise their bases in such towns and fight for the elusive swing and independent voters of the Denver suburbs.</p> <p>Obama won the state by nine points in 2008. Latest polls peg him and Romney within the margin of error. Of 1.6m early votes, 38,000 more Republicans than Democrats have cast ballots, evidence of a fired up Republican ground game. More than a quarter of those who already cast ballots were registered as independent. Another 1m are expected to vote by Tuesday.</p> <p>Obama's hopes rest on women and Latinos. Women are receptive to the so-called \"Bennet strategy\" \u2013 a focus on issues like abortion and contraception \u2013 which the Democrat Michael Bennet successfully used in a 2010 senate race.</p> <p>Obama is sweeping Latinos, a fifth of the population, after outspending Romney 2 to 1 in Spanish language advertising, hammering his rival over immigration and making time to call the popular Denver-based KBNO radio show, La Voz del Pueblo, to banter with the host, Fernando Sergio.</p> <p>Romney, way ahead with white voters, is counting on supporters' palpable enthusiasm, (even if it is more about banishing Obama than anointing Romney), the tendency of Latinos to not turn out in great numbers and a sophisticated data management programme to identify and prod \"soft\" Romney supporters to the polls. Analysts disagree over which candidate may benefit more from a ballot on legalising cannabis, and the quixotic presidential candidacy of libertarian Gary Johnson.</p> <p>Linda Killian, author of The swing vote: the untapped power of independents, said higher turnout among independents would favour the incumbent. \"The issue in Colorado is not whether they'll vote for Mitt Romney, it's whether they'll vote. Because if they do, they'll vote for Obama.\" She could have been talking about Kevin Blair.</p>",
  "<p>You might be fooled into thinking that election day only features the presidential race. Nothing could be further from the truth. Americans will be voting on a whole host of local and statewide elections that will have a great effect both on their local communities and the national landscape.</p> <p>I'm not going to try to cover the House of Representatives: if you're interested in coverage of those, you can check the <a href=\"http://cookpolitical.com/\">Cook Political</a> or <a href=\"http://rothenbergpoliticalreport.com/\">Rothenberg Political</a> report. My own estimation, as it has been throughout this entire campaign, is that the Republicans will retain control of the House with room to spare.</p> <p>I will, however, run down some Senate races here. At the beginning of the year, Republicans looked primed to take the four seats necessary to win an outright majority in the United States Senate. That's when moderate Republican Olympia Snowe of Maine decided to retire, <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/11/05/angus-king_n_2075691.html?utm_hp_ref=elections-2012\">leaving the seat open</a> for Democratic-leaning Independent former Governor Angus King. It's been all downhill since then for Republicans: poor Republican candidates who have made gaffe after gaffe, and good Democratic ones have left the GOP Senate effort staggering.</p> <p>Republicans and Democrats look to split fairly equally the ten Senate seats discussed in detail in this article. All told, it looks like Democrats will maintain control of the Senate with 53 seats +/-2 (out of 100).</p> <p>To get more of an idea of how the Senate races will breakdown, including what times polls close, the polling averages and key swing counties, see below. I start with the earliest poll closing times. Keep in mind that swing counties are more difficult to pinpoint in Senate than presidential races, since swings can change from midterm (when these seats were last up for election) to presidential year and depending on whether an incumbent is running or not.</p> <p><strong>Group 1: poll closing at 7pm ET (Indiana's eastern counties close at 6pm ET)</strong></p> <h2>Indiana (incumbent Republican Richard Lugar defeated in primary)</h2> <p><em>HuffPollster aggregate:</em> Joe Donnelly (Democrat) +3.7 points</p> <p><em>Swing counties with 50k+ population (in every case, percentage points more Democratic than state in 2008 presidential election):</em> Allen (-5.4), Madison (+5.6), Vanderburgh (+1.5)</p> <p><strong>Strongholds</strong></p> <p><em>Democrats:</em> Lake County on the Northwest Illinois Border, Marion Country (Indianapolis) in the center of the state, Monroe County (Bloomington home to Indiana University) in the southwest</p> <p><em>Republicans:</em> Indianapolis suburbs such as Hamilton, Hendricks, and Johnson County, rural areas that dominate the state outside the major population centers, and the South Bend (home to Notre Dame) suburb of Elkhart County</p> <p><strong>Background</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398884345\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/11/5/1352152746697/mourdockt.jpg\" alt=\"richard mourdock\" width=\"140\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Richard Mourdock (R-IN) Photograph: richardmourdock.com</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Public domain</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Republicans had this seat locked with long-time GOP Senator Richard Lugar.

It turned in Donnelly's favor after Mourdock made an ill-advised remark on the subject of rape and God in a recent debate.

Allen, known for wearing cowboy boots and cowboy hats, is a former governor and senator who lost his re-election bid to the senate in 2006 after <a href=\"http://tpmdc.talkingpointsmemo.com/2011/06/george-allen-im-really-sorry-about-that-whole-1.php\">making comments towards an Indian American that were viewed as racist</a>.</p> <p>Kaine is the type of politician who would follow King Solomon's advice and divide the baby if he could. This triangulating \"middle-ground\" stance came across awkwardly during a debate earlier this year when <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/09/20/tim-kaine-47-percent-income-tax_n_1900567.html\">he said he would be open to federally taxing all Americans</a>, which would include the poor and elderly. He won the governor's mansion in 2005 on the strength of the new population growth in the north. He recently served as head of the Democratic National Committee.</p> <p>This race is very tight and either candidate could win. Kaine seems to be running a little ahead of Obama in the state. Still, there aren't many split tickets to be had in the Old Dominion. I would think whichever party wins the presidential election here is likely to win the Senate election as well.</p> <p><strong>Group 2: poll closing at 8pm ET</strong></p> <h2>Connecticut (independent Democratic incumbent Joseph Lieberman retiring)</h2> <p><em>HuffPollster aggregate:</em> Chris Murphy (Democrat) +6.2pt</p> <p><em>Swing counties with 50k+ population:</em> Middlesex, (+0.6), New London (-1.6), Windham (+0.6)</p> <p><strong>Strongholds</strong></p> <p><em>Democrats:</em> they do well in all the cities that dot the landscape, such as Bridgeport in Fairfield County.

McMahon is conservative on fiscal issues and a moderate on social issues (ie she's pro-choice and has an unclear position on gay rights).</p> <p>Murphy is currently a congressman from Connecticut's 5th district. In comparison to McMahon's unique background, he's a relatively boring politician. Murphy's a lawyer who's both socially and fiscally liberal. You might say he is the type of candidate you'd expect to win in a blue state such as Connecticut.</p> <p>McMahon was able to keep this race close through advertising. She hit the relatively unknown Murphy on past financial problems and a poor congressional attendance record. But like her race against the better known, current Senator Dick Blumenthal in 2010, McMahon looks to fall victim to Connecticut's blue tint. Obama won't win the state in a blowout, yet it should be enough to carry Murphy across the finish line.</p> <h2>Massachusetts (Republican incumbent Scott Brown running for re-election)</h2> <p><em>HuffPollster aggregate:</em> Elizabeth Warren (Democrat) +4.5pt</p> <p><em>Swing counties with 50k+ population:</em> Bristol (-2.6), Hampden (-0.5), Middlesex, (+4.3)</p> <p><strong>Strongholds</strong></p> <p><em>Democrats:</em> Berkshire, Franklin and Hampshire County in the west, along with Suffolk (Boston) in the east </p> <p><em>Republicans:</em> Barnstable and Plymouth in the south-east, along with Worcester in the center of the state</p> <p><strong>Background</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398884348\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/11/5/1352154090928/Elizabeth-Warren.jpg\" alt=\"elizabeth warren\" width=\"140\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) Photograph: elizabethwarren.com</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Public domain</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I'm not sure there has been a more fascinating race to watch unfold than this highly-financed affair.

Brown did so by combining a favorable national environment with moderate positions and seriously impressive retail campaign skills</p> <p>Democrat Liz Warren isn't exactly a moderate: she's an old-school liberal who isn't afraid to voice her position on the need for the rich to pay a fairer share of taxes. Warren's bid to become director of the Consumer Protection Bureau <a href=\"http://www.thenation.com/blog/160900/house-gop-escalates-attack-elizabeth-warren-consumer-bureau\">failed when Republicans stalled her nomination</a>. Republicans may very well regret helping redirect this Harvard law professor's energies to winning one of their Senate seats.</p> <p>Brown and Warren bounced back and forth in the polls all year. Brown took a lead late in the summer because of questions surrounding Warren's American Indian background and how it impacted her being hired at Harvard. Warren regained the edge after being featured at the Democratic National Convention. She's held onto the lead in most polls, and is now the favorite.</p> <h2>Missouri (Democratic incumbent Claire McCaskill running for re-election)</h2> <p><em>HuffPollster aggregate:</em> Claire McCaskill +7.5pt</p> <p><em>Swing counties with 50k+ population:</em> Clay (-0.5), Jefferson (+2.7)</p> <p><strong>Strongholds</strong></p> <p><em>Democrats:</em> Boone County (home to the University of Missouri in the center), Jackson (Kansas City) in the west and St Louis City and County in the east </p> <p><em>Republicans:</em> pretty much everywhere else, including Greene (Springfield) and the St Louis suburb of St Charles County</p> <p><strong>Background</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398884349\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/11/5/1352154282707/Todd_Akin.jpg\" alt=\"todd akin\" width=\"140\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Todd Akin (R-MO) Photograph: Wikipedia</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Public domain</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This was a gimme for the Republicans.

She also faced an electorate that has become increasing Republican over the years. McCaskill's approvals had been in the toilet, and then she saw her opening.</p> <p>Republicans had a competitive primary, and the Democrat McCaskill decided to spend money pumping up Republican Congressman Todd Akin. It worked, spectacularly.</p> <p>Akin won the primary and immediately repaid the favor: in a television interview, Akin spoke of \"<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/aug/20/todd-akin-legitimate-rape-romney\">legitimate rape</a>\" and about the ability of the body to prevent pregnancy from rape.

Painting Flake as an extremist, Carmona has turned his small deficit in the polls into a tie, or even slight edge.</p> <p>Flake, aided by National Republicans, fired back.

Montana isn't one of them. Democratic incumbent Jon Tester and Congressman at-large Denny Rehberg (meaning he represents the entire state in the House of Representatives) have been locked in a tight contest since the beginning of the year.</p> <p>Tester won during the Democratic wave of 2006, thanks to a localized campaign that can only be described as brilliant. His flat-top haircut and farming background made voters feel like he was one of the boys, even though his political stances are slightly more liberal than the state's bent.</p> <p>Rehberg has taken pains to appear as a moderate voice in a state that may not be liberal, but isn't all that conservative either. Rehberg won't be out-done, either, on being a native Montanan. While Tester is a third-generation farmer, Rehberg is a fifth-generation rancher. Rehberg has had some issues <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/blogs/on-congress/2012/10/report-on-rehberg-boat-crash-released-147927.html\">involving statements</a> made to a court regarding the role alcohol played when a friend crashed a boat in 2009.</p> <p>Tester looks to have neutralized any advantage Rehberg might have had because of Romney's expected strong showing in the state.

North Dakota is an example of when candidates truly matter, though they may not be enough. Democrat and former state Attorney General Heidi Heitkamp has run a campaign for the ages. Pointing to her North Dakota roots and playing on the fact that North Dakota is actually a fairly moderate state in non-presidential politics, Heitkamp has turned an expected easy Republican victory into a heart-stopper.</p> <p>Republican at-large Congressman Rick Berg isn't a disaster of a candidate. He just isn't a very good one. While Heitkamp has tried her best to localize the race and focus on issues such as farming in a state that has many agrarians, Berg has tried to nationalize the race: Super Pacs have spent millions tying Heitkamp to national Democratic positions \u2013 and that seems to have had some effect.</p> <p>Berg has open the smallest of leads in this open Senate race, according to insider information. If that's right, it just goes to show that the fundamentals do matter. One has to think that if Berg wins on Tuesday, it will hold out an example of what might have been for other red-state Republicans involved in tight races this season, such as Richard Mourdock \u2013 if they had only kept their mouths shut.</p> <h2>Nevada (Republican incumbent Dean Heller running for re-election)</h2> <p><em>HuffPollster aggregate:</em> Dean Heller +3.8pt</p> <p><em>Swing counties with 50k+ population:</em> Washoe (+0.1)</p> <p><strong>Strongholds</strong></p> <p><em>Democrats:</em> Clark County (Las Vegas)</p> <p><em>Republicans:</em> pretty much everywhere outside Las Vegas and Reno (Washoe), including the Churchill in the west and Elko County in the north-east</p> <p><strong>Background</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398884354\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/11/5/1352155155283/Heller.jpg\" alt=\"dean heller\" width=\"140\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dean Heller (R-NV) Photograph: Twitter</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Public domain</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Republican Dean Heller was appointed to this seat in 2011. Heller is neither a well-known brand nor a political titan. He benefits from having done little to offend and from fitting in well enough with the state's middle-of-the-road political profile. Put another way, Heller hasn't done anything to make the normal swing voter want to throw him out of office.</p> <p>Democratic Congresswoman Shelley Berkley is also moderate, but does not have the benefit of a squeaky clean profile. She's been <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2012/07/09/politics/house-ethics-berkley/index.html\">subject to attacks</a> over whether she used her leverage in the House of Representatives to keep her husband's kidney transplant center open, despite Medicare officials wanting to shut it down.</p> <p>Heller would likely win this race if everything else were equal. The issue is that Berkley is going to benefit from strong Democratic turnout backing President Obama in Berkley's Las Vegas congressional district. Berkley will also be helped out by Democratic Senate majority leader Harry Reid's \"get out the vote\" machine, which helped him defy the pre-election polls in the 2010 midterms. Heller will be relying on a good rural turnout, including a large Mormon vote coming out to support Mitt Romney.</p> <p>Either candidate could win, but polls show a slight lean towards Heller.</p>",
  "<p>Is Labour now the most vocal voice of the right? This might seem a strange hypothesis in the week that the party outlined plans to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/nov/03/miliband-living-wage\" title=\"\">beef up the living wage</a>, but an economic policy more firmly rooted in Keynesianism is not necessarily incompatible with a more protectionist, insular foreign policy and an authoritarian approach to criminal justice. Tack to the left on matters of money and to the right on pretty much everything else: in this combination Labour strategists may think they have a winning ticket.</p> <p>For all the professions to the contrary, last week's decision to join Tory rebels in the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/oct/31/cameron-commons-defeat-eu-budget?INTCMP=ILCNETTXT3487\" title=\"\">vote on the EU budget</a> was pure opportunism. But it was opportunism with a purpose. That it was praised by Tim Montgomerie, editor of the influential website ConservativeHome and high priest of the rightwing blogosphere, speaks volumes. It would have delighted many of those around Ed Miliband.</p> <p>Several other recent decisions have been designed to steal the Tories' thunder. A couple of days earlier, Labour had voted in a parliamentary committee against government plans to increase UK funding for the IMF. In this instance, the opposition could not muster the majority to throw out the plans, but the point was made \u2013 we plucky Brits don't approve of throwing money at those Johnny foreigners. Watch out for Labour joining forces with recalcitrant Tories angry at David Cameron's insistence on maintaining levels of international development money. Such a prospect would now not be far-fetched.</p> <p>A similar message is being given on crime and punishment. Instead of embracing the prime minister's recent endorsement of rehabilitation projects for prisoners, the shadow justice secretary, <a href=\"http://www.politics.co.uk/news/2012/10/22/pm-pushes-retribution-over-rehab-in-prisons-relaunch\" title=\"\">Sadiq Khan</a>, chose to attack it. One might have thought a centre-left party would embrace notions such as education and skills for people in jail. Similarly, Labour has moved to the right on asylum and immigration, while failing to oppose Theresa May's insistence on a \"<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/jun/14/snoopers-charte-proposal-tory-row\" title=\"\">snoopers' charter</a>\" to hold everyone's online communications.</p> <p>Labour has a long tradition of talking and acting rightwing in areas of liberty. Its brief embrace of human rights, internationalism, pluralism and tolerance reached a high point in the early Blair years, epitomised by the late Robin Cook, Mo Mowlam and others. Then, in a desperate attempt to ingratiate itself with the Daily Mail, the Sun and others, the party reverted to type, through a succession of hard-nut home secretaries \u2013 David Blunkett and John Reid being the most extreme. The events of 9/11 merely reinforced a trend. The brief and sad tenure of Gordon Brown at No 10 strengthened these hard-headed, tribal tendencies, playing to a caricature of what they believed the \"man at the Dog and Duck\" would want to hear.</p> <p>On taking over, Miliband seemed to suggest he was ready to recalibrate, to ease his party away from its thuggishness. But, with Ed Balls and Yvette Cooper at the helm, Labour is back in its comfort zone. Its strategists believe all this will be electorally successful. I have my doubts. I get the sense that voters who like their meat rare will always opt for the Tories. In tactical terms, Miliband may score a few points on 24-hour news, particularly as he identifies policy after policy that drive a wedge between Cameron and the Liberal Democrats.</p> <p>Successful or not, this is a far cry from what those on the liberal left would expect from Labour, particularly while in opposition. The race to the bottom is on. Labour and the Tories are vying for the lowest common denominator, for the title of defender of Little England. Good luck to them both. Although I might wish otherwise, they are both conforming to an introspective miserabilist view of Britain. In the interests of transparency, the least Miliband should do is wear his new mantle with pride.</p>",
  "<p>Here's a remarkable thing. Neither Mitt Romney nor Barack Obama \u2013 with the exception of one throwaway line each \u2013 have mentioned climate change in the wake of hurricane Sandy.</p> <p>They are struck dumb. During a Romney rally in Virginia on Thursday, a protester held up a banner and shouted \"What about climate? That's what caused this monster storm\". The candidate stood grinning and nodding as the crowd drowned out the heckler by chanting \"USA! USA!\". Romney paused, then resumed his speech as if nothing had happened. The poster the man held up? It said \"End climate silence\".</p> <p>While other Democrats expound the urgent need to act, the man they support will not take up the call. Barack Obama, responding to his endorsement by the mayor of New York, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/nov/01/bloomberg-endorses-obama-climate-change\" title=\"\">mentioned climate change last week</a> as \"a threat to our children's future\". Otherwise, I have been able to find nothing; nor have the many people I have asked on Twitter. Something has gone horribly wrong.</p> <p>There are several ways in which the impact of hurricane Sandy is likely to have been exacerbated by climate breakdown. Warmer oceans make hurricanes more likely and more severe. A warmer atmosphere holds more moisture, increasing the maximum rainfall. Higher sea levels aggravate storm surges. Sandy might not have hit the United States at all, had it not been for a blocking ridge of high pressure over Greenland, which diverted the storm westwards. The blocking high \u2013 rare there at this time of year \u2013 could be the result of the record ice melt in the Arctic this autumn.</p> <p>This might sound like the wisdom of hindsight. But in February the journal <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/nclimate/journal/v2/n6/abs/nclimate1389.html\" title=\"\">Nature Climate Change</a> published an article warning that global warming is likely to \"increase the surge risk for New York City\". As storms intensify and the sea level rises, it predicted that storm surges previously described as 100-year events would become between five and 30 times as frequent.</p> <p>Four years ago, <a href=\"http://change.gov/newsroom/entry/president_elect_barack_obama_to_deliver_taped_greeting_to_bi_partisan_gover/\" title=\"\">Obama pledged that</a> \"my presidency will mark a new chapter in America's leadership on climate change\". He promised a federal cap and trade system and \"strong annual targets\" to reduce carbon pollution. But he ran into a ridge of high pressure. His cap and trade bill was killed in the Senate in 2010.</p> <p>At a meeting in the White House in 2009, his strategists decided that climate change was a banned topic: it caused too much trouble. From then onwards, Obama would talk about clean energy and green jobs and improvements in fuel economy, but would seldom explain why these shifts were necessary. The problem with this approach is that you cannot engineer a sustained reduction of greenhouse gas emissions only by getting into clean energy: you also have to get out of dirty energy. And that requires statesmanship: active and persuasive engagement with the public.</p> <p>In April, Obama <a href=\"http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/ready-for-the-fight-rolling-stone-interview-with-barack-obama-20120425\" title=\"\">said that global warming</a> \"will become part of the campaign\" and that he would be \"very clear\" about how he would deal with it. It hasn't happened. There were a couple of noncommittal paragraphs in his speech to the national convention, during which he also boasted that \"we've opened millions of new acres for oil and gas exploration in the last three years, and we'll open more.\" There was more of the same in the Democratic platform (the party's manifesto). Otherwise, this remains the issue that dare not speak its name. For the first time since 1984, climate change wasn't mentioned in any of the presidential debates.</p> <p>This, remember, is after a year of climate disasters: the droughts and wildfires that devastated much of the continental interior of the United States, the Arctic meltdown, the superstorm that ripped through the Caribbean before piercing the financial and spiritual heart of the nation. You wonder what it takes.</p> <p>As for Romney, his contribution has been confined to mockery. Even as hurricane Isaac cut short the Republican national convention, <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/08/31/mitt-romney-obama-climate-change_n_1846440.html\" title=\"\">he ridiculed Obama</a>, to the delight of the delegates, for wanting to stop the sea level from rising. It was a revolting spectacle, which, in the aftermath of Sandy, would have become a major liability, had climate change not been taboo.</p> <p>In the Republican party platform, \"climate change\" \u2013 yes, in quotes \u2013 is mentioned only once, to <a href=\"http://www.gop.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/2012GOPPlatform.pdf\" title=\"\">attack Obama for taking it seriously</a>. The platform commits the party to blocking all effective measures to curb it, and to developing new coal (which Romney now professes to \"love\"), the Keystone XL tar sands pipeline and oil drilling on the outer continental shelf and in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. Planetary ruin, for the Republicans, seems no longer to be an unfortunate side-effect of development: now it looks almost like a desirable end in itself; a test of manhood and corporate muscle.</p> <p>Successive polls show that an effective response to climate breakdown will not lose votes. Votes are not the problem: the problem is money and traction. Anyone who tries to address this subject encounters a storm surge of attack ads, obstruction and manufactured fury.</p> <p>During the crucial year \u2013 2009 \u2013 in which the cap and trade bill was struggling through Congress and governments were preparing for the summit in Copenhagen, environmental groups threw everything they had at climate change. After massive fundraising efforts, a coalition of green NGOs managed to find $22m for federal lobbying. But Exxon alone outspent them with a casual flick of the wallet. The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2010/feb/01/exxonmobil-oil-profits-slump\" title=\"\">$27m it dropped into the counter-campaign</a> represented half of a day's profits. The other fossil fuel companies <a href=\"http://www.opensecrets.org/news/2010/08/pro-environment-groups-were-outmatc.html\" title=\"\">threw in a further $150m</a>. Without a major reform of both lobbying and campaign finance, the big money will keep winning. Protecting the planet and its people is impossible in a plutocracy.</p> <p>The Republicans in Congress have no choice but to keep obstructing or filibustering every means of addressing our foremost global crisis, for to alter their position would be to jeopardise their political funding. As David Roberts of <a href=\"http://grist.org/climate-energy/the-futility-of-climatespotting-no-matter-what-he-says-obama-cant-make-big-moves-on-climate/\" title=\"\">grist.org</a> points out, Obama has little incentive to talk about climate change when he knows that any promise he makes will be thwarted. All he can do is to \"fight for gridlock because gridlock is better than the alternative\".</p> <p>So the two candidates remain struck dumb. Speech fails them, action is abominable, they will not even raise their hands in self-defence. The world's most pressing crisis, now breaking down the doors of the world's most powerful nation, cannot be discussed.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 6 November 2012, to say that for the first time since 1984, climate change wasn't mentioned in any of the presidential debates.

  "<p>George Osborne, the chancellor, has joined forces with the German finance minister, Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, to announce an international crackdown on tax avoidance by multinational companies.</p> <p>The intervention comes came as the business secretary, Vince Cable, weighed into the Starbucks tax affair by berating corporate behemoths for \"taking from the British economy and putting very little back\". According to a Reuters report last month, Starbucks has not paid tax in the UK for three years.</p> <p>Cable told the Guardian: \"At times of hardship, when tens of thousands of British companies are paying their basic tax, to discover that leading multinationals are getting away with it is not acceptable.\"</p> <p>Osborne said he and Sch\u00e4uble, meeting at the G20 finance ministers' summit in Mexico, had called for \"concerted international co-operation to strengthen international tax standards that at the minute may mean international companies can pay less tax than they would otherwise owe\".</p> <p>Neither was he eager to identity individual corporate culprits</p> <p>government sources said the spread of e-commerce, and the ponderous nature of international corporate tax rules had left governments trailing as multinationals shift profits around the globe.</p> <p>Osborne and Sch\u00e4uble said they would back work by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development to identify possible gaps in tax laws.</p> <p>Trying to balance his defence of low tax rates with the need to act against firms that repeatedly pay virtually no tax, Osborne said: \"We want competitive taxes that say Britain is open for business and that attract global companies to invest in and bring jobs to our country, but we also want global companies to pay those taxes. The best way to achieve that is through international action that ensures strong standards, without pricing ourselves out of the global market.\"</p> <p>The joint statement by the two countries, a rare example of Anglo-German co-operation, admits, that \"international tax standards have had difficulty keeping up with changes in global business practices, such as the development of e-commerce in commercial activities.\"</p> <p>The two countries add: \"As a result, some multi-national businesses are able to shift the taxation of their profits away from the jurisdictions where they are being generated, thus minimising their tax payments compared to smaller, less international companies.\"</p> <p>In the statement, Britain and Germany say they expect the first report from the OECD at the next G20 meeting in Russia in February 2013. The two men agreed their joint approach when the chancellor visited Berlin on Thursday last week.</p> <p>The co-operation comes ahead of a meeting between David Cameron and Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, on Wednesday.</p> <p>Starbucks has paid only \u00a38.6m income tax since 1998 on \u00a33.1bn sales, thanks to reporting consistent losses. Cable said: \"It is worrying and frankly a bit of a disgrace that Starbucks is a tip of the iceberg.\"</p> <p>Pointing to similar arrangements among other multinationals with UK operations, he added: \"They are taking a lot of value out of the British economy and British consumers, and putting little in.\"</p> <p>He added: \"There appears to be a loophole in American legislation which encourages them to put their money through tax havens. And that is unacceptable from a UK point of view because they are taking from the British economy and putting very little back.\"</p> <p>Starbucks reiterated its claim that it has paid more than \u00a3160m in taxes over the past three years, including national insurance and business rates.</p> <p>Google said it complied with all UK tax rules. \"We make a substantial contribution to the UK economy through local, payroll and corporate taxes,\" said a Google spokesperson. Amazon did not return calls seeking comment.</p> <p>Britain has the lowest rate of corporation tax in the G7, and has cut its rate by more than any other G20 country over the past two years (from 28% in 2010 to 22% by 2014).</p> <p>Last year, around half of the \u00a3136bn taxes paid in the UK by the biggest businesses came from foreign-owned companies; while inward investment created or safeguarded more than 100,000 jobs.</p> <p>The HMRC has raised more than \u00a31.5bn since March 2010 through increased efforts to tackle transfer pricing. This aims to ensure multinationals pay the right amount of tax by determining the taxable profits of each company as if it were an independent entity trading at arm's length from other members of the same group.</p>",
  "<p>Last November, 70 Harvard economics students walked out of a lecture by their faculty head, <a href=\"http://hpronline.org/harvard/an-open-letter-to-greg-mankiw/\" title=\"\">Greg Mankiw</a>. Angry at the conservative nature of Harvard's economics course, they were suspicious of their lecturers' failure to predict the ongoing financial crisis, and their unerring faith in the theories that led to the crisis in the first place. So up stood the students, and out they went to join a march organised by Occupy Boston instead.</p> <p>It's this kind of campus reaction that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/kalle-lasn\" title=\"\">Kalle Lasn</a> wants to inspire with his latest book, Meme Wars \u2013 the Creative Destruction of Neo-Classical Economics. \"I want to light a fire under the economic students around the world,\" he says. \"I&#xa0;can imagine a few of them asking: how come we are still being taught the old economics? Why did not even one in a hundred of you professors see the meltdown coming? It's an invitation to&#xa0;the students who get wind of the book to create a bit of a ruckus within the university.\"</p> <p>Lasn is the founder and editor of <a href=\"http://www.adbusters.org/\" title=\"\">Adbusters</a>, the very leftwing, very well-designed magazine that has railed&#xa0;against consumerism since 1989. Among&#xa0;other successful stunts, Adbusters has popularised TV Turnoff Week \u2013 where, as you would expect, millions try to avoid television for seven days. Then there's the annual Buy Nothing Day, which is again fairly self-explanatory. Both campaigns go hand in hand with what Adbusters is&#xa0;most famous for: culture-jamming, or&#xa0;subvertising, which sees the magazine's team create spoof versions of well-known adverts. It's also the organ that&#xa0;invented the concept of <a href=\"http://www.adbusters.org/campaigns/occupywallstreet\" title=\"\">Occupy Wall Street</a>, and Lasn is the&#xa0;man who first registered the movement's <a href=\"http://\" title=\"\">website</a>.</p> <p>Like anyone involved in Occupy, Lasn doesn't want to be identified as its figurehead or posterboy. He is proud of the movement's horizontal structure, and has been running from the authoritarian left since he was a child. Born in&#xa0;Tallinn in 1942, his family fled the Russian invasion two years later. For the next half-decade, he lived in a German refugee camp, before spending the next two decades in Australia and Japan. Lasn made it to Canada in 1970, where he now lives on a small farm outside Vancouver, <a href=\"http://www.vancouverobserver.com/politics/commentary/2011/10/12/adbusters-kalle-lasn-brilliant-flawed-genius-behind-occupy-wall\" title=\"\">apparently padding to work in wellington boots</a>. Before founding Adbusters, he made TV documentaries that critiqued capitalism. Yet he defines himself against consumerism, rather than with the old-school left.</p> <p>\"For the past 15 to 20 years, we at Adbusters have been saying we have to jump over the dead body of the old left,\" he says. \"I'm not all that interested in the political left, unless it's this new&#xa0;horizontal left that's coming out of&#xa0;Occupy.\"</p> <p>But Meme Wars is not, he stresses, a&#xa0;manifesto for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/occupy-movement\" title=\"\">Occupy</a>, a movement often criticised for its lack of direction. It is nevertheless an attempt to do what Occupy couldn't: it's a radical economics textbook that Lasn hopes will spread the spirit of Occupy from the town square to the university campus. \"It was of the things that the Occupy movement didn't quite achieve, unlike in 1968 \u2013 the great moment in my life, when I became politicised,\" he says. \"For some weird reason, when almost the same thing [as 1968] happened in Zuccotti Park, and then spread around the world like it did in '68, it didn't really happen in the universities.\"</p> <p>The book is billed as an alternative textbook, and it certainly looks it. Adbusters pastiches adverts to satirise consumerism \u2013 and Meme Wars does something similar for economics primers. \"Darling!\" reads a subverted image of two 50s lovers. \"Let's get deeply into debt.\" Elsewhere, graphs that chart economic growth over the past half-century are overlayed with ones that show a simultaneous rise in depression and pollution. While the text's content is pretty dense, visually it has the look and feel of a messy scrapbook or graphic novel. There aren't even any page numbers: a rejection of what Lasn sees as the faux-rationalism of mainstream economics. \"That's deliberate. We don't like page numbers. It's one of the left-cortex things that you don't actually need if you want to understand something such as economics.\"</p> <p>Lasn sees three problems with conventional economics teaching. First: orthodox or neo-classical economics has brought the world to the brink of financial ruin. Second: by fostering a consumer culture, it has turned humanity into a selfish, anxious race. Third: <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/oct/15/economics-the-no-growth-future\" title=\"\">it fetishises economic growth</a> \u2013 even though this growth is ultimately destructive, since it both makes us unhappy and wreaks unsustainable havoc on the planet's natural resources. \"This is one of the most fatal flaws in neo-classical economics,\" says Lasn, in a delicate Estonian lilt that belies the passion of his argument. \"We cannot keep on selling off our natural capital and calling it income. It's the most <em>stupid</em> mistake of all \u2026 When they measure growth, they don't measure real progress.\"</p> <p>The \"they\" to which he refers is the economics establishment. People such as Harvard's Greg Mankiw, whose textbook, <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Principles-Economics-N-Gregory-Mankiw/dp/0538453052\" title=\"\">Principles of Economics</a>, is taught in many universities, and which \u2013 Lasn argues \u2013 helps entrench the values of orthodox economics in the minds of each successive generation of economists, who then use their influence to maintain the status quo inside governments.</p> <p>Lasn's modest hope is therefore to inspire the next generation to grab Mankiw and his brethren \"by the scruff of their neck and throw them out of power. In a sense, I am calling for a scientific revolution: a revolution where the new guard \u2013 the heterodox, maverick people who have been sniping for a long time \u2013 rise to the top and finally create a new kind of economics.\" Once that happens, Lasn argues, a new crop of economists will emerge \u2013 \"and they'll become economic advisers to the people running governments all around the world, and bit by bit the whole practice of economics can begin to <em>heave</em>.\"</p> <p>As Lasn himself acknowledges, his hopes are not new. In fact, Meme Wars is structured around the thoughts of leftwing economists who have been making these arguments for years. The book features interviews with <a href=\"http://www.vanityfair.com/society/features/2011/05/top-one-percent-201105\" title=\"\">Joseph Stiglitz</a>, and essays by, among others, <a href=\"http://steadystate.org/eight-fallacies-about-growth/\" title=\"\">Herman Daly</a> and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Akerlof\" title=\"\">George Akerlof</a>. \"We,\" says Lasn of his colleagues at Adbusters, who helped him edit the book, \"took all these people who we had fallen in love with over the years, and we put together a jigsaw puzzle of them.\"</p> <p>Meme Wars takes those existing radical arguments and uses them to flesh out what Lasn sees as a new(ish) brand of radical economics. Something that is humbler than the orthodox schools \u2013 that doesn't hubristically see itself as an exact, rational science, but a social one. Lasn suggests the concept of \"psychonomics\" \u2013 economics that takes into account human behaviour \u2013 or \"bionomics\", which bears in mind the cost of environment damage. \"There has been a maverick tradition out there that has been snapping at the heels of the dominant paradigm for a long time,\" he argues. \"But they haven't quite zeroed in on exactly what [the alternative] could be. And I thought of those two words.\"</p> <p>There is no faulting Lasn's ambition. \"At the risk of sounding a bit grandiose,\" he says, Meme Wars \"is an attempt to do something that actually could put humanity on a new path.\" Of course, it probably isn't quite as revolutionary as all that. Behavioural and no-growth economics already exist as concepts. Tim Jackson's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/jan/23/properity-without-growth-tim-jackson\" title=\"\">Prosperity Beyond Growth</a> and Ha-Joon Chang's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/aug/29/ha-joon-chang-23-things\" title=\"\">23 Things They Don't Tell You About Capitalism</a> are just two recent books that also contradict traditional economic ideas. But Meme Wars \u2013 with its unusual visuals and collation of today's main radical thinkers \u2013 is nevertheless a welcome addition to the fray. And if its unique graphics can turn a few more heads than its predecessors on campus, then&#xa0;so much the better.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.penguin.co.uk/nf/Book/BookDisplay/0,,9781846146985,00.html#\" title=\"\"><em>Meme Wars: the the Creative Destruction of Neo-Classical Economics</em></a><em>, by Kalle Lasn/Adbusters, is published in the UK by Penguin \u00a319.99, and in the US by Seven Stories Press.</em></p>",
  "<p>Until a few months ago, 10-year-old Zhao Ai went hungry from dawn to dusk, despite <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/oct/03/china-rural-poor-left-stranded\" title=\"\">the two-hour trek between his mountain home and school</a>. Now he enjoys a free lunch with classmates.</p> <p>Like tens of millions of households in China, his family are farmers who live on meagre profits from the crops they can spare and wages sent back by relatives working in cities hundreds of miles away. In a land now dotted with skyscrapers and designer stores, they are scraping by in one of the poorest areas, a remote part of south-western Guizhou province. As others prosper, they fall further behind. Yet in the past decade, a string of measures have offered some relief: the abolition of agricultural tax and tuition fees, the rolling out of medical insurance that reimburses most of their bills, a 55-yuan monthly (\u00a35.50) pension for Zhao's grandfather, and now the school lunches.</p> <p>\"Compared to rich people, our life is not that good \u2013 but it is much better than before,\" said Zhao's grandmother, Xu Zuxian.</p> <p>As China prepares for its leadership transition, state media hail a \"golden decade\" under the incumbents. Critics call it a lost decade, rife with wasted opportunities for the economic, social and political reforms the country needs. They say Hu Jintao and Wen Jiabao have maintained high growth \u2013 not an insignificant achievement, given the wider global economic woes \u2013 but failed to tackle the problems now accumulating thanks to that model.</p> <p>Yet others believe that for all the disappointments, the administration is leaving behind what could yet prove a significant political legacy: building the skeleton of a welfare state and attempting to put a shelf below those at the bottom of society.</p> <p>\"The government invested a lot of money in ordinary people's living standards \u2026 China is starting to enter the 'welfare China' stage, although it is still at quite a low level,\" noted Beijing-based scholar Deng Yuwen, in many ways an outspoken critic of the authorities' record.</p> <p>Wang Dewen, social protection economist with the World Bank in Beijing, added: \"The government has done a great job.\" At the beginning, the social insurance programme targeted urban workers, but it gradually extended to migrant workers and introduced rural medical insurance and pension programmes. \"They have set up ambitious objectives \u2026 They have mobilised resources from the whole society to achieve them.\"</p> <p>A decade ago, 147 million urban employees and 55 million rural residents had pension coverage. Now 229 million urban employees are covered, and 449 million rural and urban residents; 124 million are already receiving payments. A few years ago, barely 20% of rural dwellers had medical insurance; now 96% of the population are covered.</p> <p>While inequality has soared over the past decade \u2013 the gap between town and country has expanded, with rural dwellers enjoying less than a third of average urban incomes on official measures and perhaps as little as a fifth according to experts \u2013 research by Tony Saich of Harvard University found that satisfaction with the government had actually gone up between 2003 and 2011.</p> <p>Strikingly, significant increases were seen among the poorest and the wealthiest. \"When we started, those in the poorest categories were least satisfied with the local government,\" Saich said. \"That's where I think things like the <em>dibao</em> [a subsidy for the poorest] and some kind of medical insurance have improved their view.\"</p> <p>How much credit Hu and Wen deserve is a matter of opinion; their predecessors began some programmes and other leaders would presumably have sought to address the problems that emerged with China's development. \"But you also have to look at the individuals,\" said Saich. \"Hu has not spent most of his career in the glitziest parts of Shanghai and Beijing; he's been in quite poor areas \u2026 [I once heard] Wen say: 'I can't guarantee that I've been to every county in China, but I can guarantee that I've been to every poor county.'\"</p> <p>The significance of their legacy will depend on how their successors build upon it. \"There's been a foundation, but there is a long way to go,\" said Dorothy Solinger of the University of California Irvine. As an expert on the dibao, she points out: \"The whole programme remains miserable and very, very stingy.\" The urban expansion of the dibao was made under the previous leaders, she notes, and the urban poverty line \u2013 which is set in each city \u2013 worked out nationally at 15% of urban average disposable income last year, down from the high 20s a decade ago.</p> <p>Even at existing payment levels, there are obvious funding problems. The pensions of current retirees are being paid by new workers, for instance, said David Kelly, research director of Beijing-based consultancy China Policy \u2013 and the demographics are working against the system. China is ageing rapidly and its workforce is shrinking. In 2000, there were <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/mar/20/china-next-generation-ageing-population\" title=\"\">six workers for every person over 60</a>. By 2030, there will be barely two.</p> <p>Authorities must also address broader issues. Corruption and incompetence need to be tackled to ensure funds reach their intended beneficiaries: \"There are already cases of fraud and fingers in the till,\" warned Kelly.</p> <p>Many also believe that creating a proper welfare state will require a long-awaited overhaul of the <em>hukou</em>, the household registration system that defines people as urban or rural and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/mar/15/china-migrant-workers-children-education\" title=\"\">allocates their rights to services such as education</a> accordingly. At present migrants \u2013 and their children, who inherit their parents' status \u2013 in effect become second-class citizens in cities.</p> <p>\"It's the hardest thing to touch because it involves popular sentiment. City dwellers don't want a wave of people coming to share the same benefits as them,\" warned Kelly.</p> <p>Developing a welfare state in China will require the support not just of China's new leaders \u2013 but of its citizens, too.</p>",
  "<p><strong> </strong></p> <p>An escalating row between solar panel makers stepped up a gear on Monday when China complained to the World Trade Organisation that Italy and Greece had unfairly favoured domestic suppliers.</p> <p>China, the world's largest solar panel maker, accused the European Union of breaching world trade rules only days after saying it would consider blocking imports of solar technology from Europe.</p> <p>It said the crux of its complaint centred on offers by Rome and Athens of higher electricity prices to solar power producers that use mainly locally sourced components.</p> <p>Concerns that the financial crisis would bring simmering protectionist disputes to the surface proved misplaced until this year. During 2012 the WTO received 25 complaints compared to eight in 2011. Analysts blame the downturn in global growth this year for sparking a series of disputes that range from the US and Mexico complaining about Argentinian import restrictions on meat and fruit to objections from Brazil over South African anti-dumping duties on Brazilian frozen meat.</p> <p>The biggest disputes involve the four major trading blocs \u2013 the US, China, Japan and the EU. Solar panels have become a flashpoint after Chinese panel makers maintained production despite a sharp slowdown in demand.</p> <p>Washington has come under intense pressure to raise tariffs on Chinese goods after firms objected to panels being dumped in the US market.</p> <p>Congress recently sanctioned sweeping restrictions on goods it says are dumped by China under rules allowing \"the application of countervailing measures to non-market economy countries\".</p> <p>China has responded with a series of complaints to the WTO, one of which appears to be the same complaint that the EU and Japan have brought against Canada for protecting its solar panel industry.</p> <p>\"The Chinese government has the right and the responsibility to fight for a fair international trade environment for China's solar industry,\" Chinese Ministry of Commerce spokesman Shen Danyang said in a statement.</p> <p>Shen said all countries should strengthen industry cooperation and reject short-term \"protectionist\" measures.</p> <p>By lodging its complaint, China triggers the formal process for a WTO dispute and, if talks with the EU fail to resolve the issue, after 60 days it could ask the global trade body to adjudicate.</p> <p>While Germany has built a strong domestic solar industry, much of it in the former communist region around Leipzig, Italy and Greece have struggled against local corruption and a reluctance among investors to build solar farms to replicate the same manufacturing base.</p> <p>However, the EU is the world's largest market for solar products and is a particular target for Chinese manufacturers.</p> <p>Tensions rose earlier this year after Chinese firms dropped their prices 30% after a long period of over-supply. EU countries accused the Chinese authorities of dumping artificially low cost panels that undermined domestic businesses.</p> <p>About 60% of China's exports of solar panels and components went to the EU in 2011, generating \u20ac21bn (\u00a317bn) and accounting for 7% of all Chinese exports to the region, according to Bloomberg.</p> <p>A group of 25 European companies, led by Germany's SolarWorld, filed a complaint with the European Commission in September, claiming Chinese rivals were unfairly benefiting from illegal subsidies.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 6 November 2012. The original referred to the former communist region around Liepzig rather than Leipzig. This has been corrected.</p>",
  "<p>The Texas 25th US congressional district is not what it used to be. Once a solid Democratic constituency built around Austin, the state's liberal capital, it is now an elongated hodgepodge of urban dwellers, farmers and military families extending 180 miles north to the edge of Fort Worth. And it's about to elect a Republican.</p> <p>That is by design.</p> <p>After months of legal battles reaching to the supreme court, Texas is holding elections for the US Congress and state legislature in November based on constituency maps a federal court has described as planned by Republican lawmakers with \"discriminatory intent\".</p> <p>Democrats and civil rights groups say the intent is to neutralise a rapid expansion of the Latino vote and rig individual elections in favour of Republican candidates, strengthening the party's hand in the US Congress and helping it maintain a hold on the Texas legislature.</p> <p>\"It's a power grab,\" said Elaine Henderson, the Democratic candidate for Congress in the newly drawn 25th district. \"The Republicans are trying to stave off the inevitable. The Hispanic vote is coming, and it's with us, not them.\"</p> <p>Republicans acknowledge that they have carved up districts to dilute the impact of the swelling Latino vote, which leans strong toward the Democrats. But they balk at accusations of racism, saying it's just Texas politics as usual. But civil rights activists say that even if the intent is political, the outcome is racist.</p> <p>Democrats have told federal courts that the maps \"grossly misrepresent the demographics\" of Texas and are part of a wider attempt by conservatives in several states to turn back the gains of the civil rights era.</p> <p>According to the 2010 census, Texas's population grew by 4.2m over the previous decade \u2013 a 20% rise. That earned Texas four more seats in Congress at the expense of states in the midwest and north-east.</p> <p>But the census also showed that the bulk of that increase \u2013 63% \u2013 was Latino. That, combined with a significant rise in the number of African Americans and Asians, has for the first time made Texas a \"minority-majority\" state with a little more than half the population Hispanic, black or Asian.</p> <p>The increase in the number of white people in Texas was so small that on its own it would not be enough to qualify for a single new seat in Congress. Yet civil rights lawyers say Republican legislators have redrawn electoral maps so that not a single additional Latino or African American will be elected to Congress in Texas, while the Republican party will probably pick up two and possibly three of the new districts. Something similar is happening in elections to the state legislature.</p> <p>\"You cannot responsibly morally or legally respond to the census with the maps the Republicans drew which arguably produce zero new minority seats,\" said Harold Cook, a Democratic political strategist <a href=\"http://www.lettersfromtexas.com/\">who in 2003 organised a mass departure</a> of his party's state Senators into neighbouring New Mexico in order to prevent a quorum and block an earlier bid at gerrymandering.</p> <p>\"What the Republicans have been doing is drawing seats so that minorities cannot win them and Republicans are protected from the growing Latino vote. It's not only redistricting. There are voter ID laws, more stringent regulations on registering to vote. It's all about trying to hold off this tide of minority voters that are going to swamp the Republicans in this state. But in the end they won't be able to stop it.\"</p> <p>One of the most brazen cases of gerrymandering is the 27th congressional district on the east Texas coast. For 26 years it was held by a Latino and Democrat, Solomon Ortiz.</p> <p>In 2010, a Tea Party Republican, Blake Farenthold, took the district by just 800 votes as part of the nationwide backlash against Barack Obama that saw rightwing Republicans mobilised while much of the Latino vote stayed at home. Farenthold was almost certain to lose the seat in November, but then the Republican map designers stepped in.</p> <p>They lopped off a chunk of the south end of the constituency packed with Latino voters, including the border city of Brownsville, and then added a clutch of counties to the north and west around Corpus Christi with a sizeable chunk of white voters. </p> <p>In doing so, the 27th district went from 70% Latino to less than 50%. The result is that Farenthold is now considered a safe bet for re-election.</p> <p>Ryan Downton, a Republican lawyer who played a leading role in redrawing the congressional electoral map, admitted that was the intent at a court hearing in January. \"We drew Farenthold a more Republican district,\" he said.</p> <p>Downton conceded the same intent in manipulating the boundaries of the 23rd district, which runs from San Antonio to El Paso, to favour a Republican incumbent, Francisco Canseco \u2013 the party's only Latino congressman from Texas.</p> <p>A Republican official, who does not wish to be named because of the continuing legal action, acknowledged that boundaries were redrawn for partisan advantage.</p> <p>\"It's a political draw,\" he said. \"I certainly don't think it's undemocratic. There's an element of human nature that says to the victor goes the spoils.\"</p> <p>Texas will have 36 seats in the next US Congress. But the number of Latino representatives from the state is likely to remain static at five, the same as in the present 32-seat Texas delegation.</p> <p>Republicans say that is because Democratic primary voters have chosen white, not Latino, candidates even in districts with a substantial number of Hispanic voters. But Luis Roberto Vera, chief counsel for League of United Latin American Citizens, has argued before the supreme court that it is a result of the way Latino voters have been parcelled out to diminish their impact.</p> <p>\"How do they do it? We call it cracking and packing,\" he said.</p> <p>Cracking breaks concentrations of Latino and other minority voters and distributes them among mostly white conservative-leaning districts so they are overwhelmed by Republican voters. But that is not always possible, in which case as many minority voters as possible are packed in to a single district so the impact of their ballots is diminished.</p> <p>\"They draw districts that are packed with minorities \u2013 80 or 90% when all we need to win is 55% \u2013 or they spread us out thinly. They crack us up to divide the vote or pack us all together. Whatever they need to do to suppress the Latino vote,\" said Vera.</p> <p>For instance, in Austin \u2013 a city with a nearly 60% increase in Latinos over the past decade \u2013 voters who once lived in one of two congressional districts are now carved up between six, greatly diluting their impact because they have mostly been parcelled off to Republican constituencies where they are overwhelmed by conservative voters. Almost every other US city of similar size, such as Detroit, Memphis and San Francisco, is divided between two congressional districts.</p> <p>The breaking up of the vote in Austin appears in part to have been aimed at levering a sitting Democrat from office.</p> <p>The 25th district used to be a safe seat for a Democratic congressman, Lloyd Doggett. But it has virtually been drawn out of existence by the Republican legislature \u2013 nine years after a similar move against him was blocked by the courts. Doggett went in search of a more viable seat and fought his way through a primary to contest a district east of Austin, where he is expected to be elected. </p> <p>Henderson is now struggling against the odds in what was Doggett's old district in name if not geography. She regards the redrawing of the 25th's boundaries as a blatant Republican move to get rid of Doggett because he was popular with Latino voters and influential in Washington.</p> <p>\"I saw the redistricting as a way to divide Austin up enough that even Lloyd wouldn't have his seat anymore. They thought they could redistrict Lloyd out of a seat, the Democrat from the area,\" she said. \"This district is totally new. I don't think it's ever been like this. I think they thought they were making a nice safe district for a Republican out of this.\" </p> <p>A Republican official intimately involved in drawing the new electoral maps, who does not wish to be named because of the continuing legal action, acknowledged as much when Henderson's allegation was put to him.</p> <p>\"There are ways to draw maps that could have assured [Doggett's] election,\" he said.</p> <p>So does that mean the map was drawn to try and remove Doggett?</p> <p>\"You could certainly draw that inference,\" he said. \"It's not a stretch to believe that.\"</p> <p>The Republican official said that while the courts will strike down maps drawn to discriminate against minority voters, they will let stand politically partisan boundaries. He said the accusations of racism are unjustified and that Texas legislatures have a long history of redrawing election boundaries for partisan advantage.</p> <p>\"Nobody likes being called a racist,\" he said. \"We don't have people over there [in the legislature] who are old-school racist.\"</p> <p>The new boundaries were also drawn to move facilities such as medical centres and sports grounds to districts under Republican control, and so that some black Democratic members of Congress found their district offices were no longer in their districts. </p> <p>The Republicans have not had it all their own way. They wanted to take two mostly African American districts in Dallas and merge them into one but were prevented from doing so by a provision of the Voting Rights Act, a piece of civil rights era legislation.</p> <p>But on the whole the Republicans have got what they wanted after a series of court battles which saw federal judges substantially redraw the state legislature map earlier this year only for the supreme court to order the lower court to redraw it again based on the Texas legislature's original design. However, a federal court has ordered that the map again be revisited after next month's election. </p> <p>It is a similar picture in the state legislature. Redistricting is expected to give Republicans seven of the nine new seats there, again in the face of demographic changes that suggest movement should be in the other direction. That will help the party retain its majority and continue to gerrymander elections. </p> <p>The anonymous Republican official involved with drawing up the new maps said they are not discriminatory.</p> <p>\"If you look back at the senate map of 31 seats, when we started Latinos had seven seats. When we finished they had seven seats,\" he said.</p> <p>But Vera said that does not take account of the rapid rise in the number of Latinos living in Texas. </p> <p>Vera acknowledges that part of the reason Republicans can get away with it is the relatively low turnout of Latino voters. Of more than 4 million Hispanic Americans of voting age living in Texas, just 1 million voted in the 2010 elections, whereas much higher proportions of white and African American voters turned out.</p> <p>\"I hate these people that discriminate and they way they do it. But at the same time I realise that it's also our fault. We don't vote. The Republican party knows that when push comes to shove the Latino community votes less than anyone,\" said Vera. </p> <p>\"As long as we're not voting, that's what gives them the power to do what they do. Redistrictings are done by the groups in power. Every report shows that if the Latino community came our and voted their numbers we could easily control every election in Texas. We'd be the swing vote, the winning vote.\"</p>",

  "<p>A portrait of Benjamin Franklin hangs in his office overlooking downtown Denver, but to critics Scott Gessler is no friend of the republic's founding principles.</p> <p>Colorado's secretary of state stands accused of purging the electoral roll in a bid to intimidate voters and boost Mitt Romney's chances of winning the swing state on Tuesday.</p> <p>Gessler, a staunch Republican, has sent thousands of letters to voters demanding proof they are citizens, or their removal from the register, in a controversial campaign against voter fraud which has alarmed immigrant and civil rights groups.</p> <p>\"There is tension out there. This has resonated in the immigration community,\" said Denise Maes, public policy director at the <a href=\"http://aclu-co.org/news/citizen-voters-frantic-after-receiving-gessler-challenge-letter\">American Civil Liberties Union of Colorado</a>. \"We don't know how many voters may be challenged on voting day.\"</p> <p>Some Democrats go further and accuse Gessler of disenfranchising ethnic minorities. \"I think it's disgusting that when the chips are down the Republicans try to keep people from voting,\" said Paul Lopez, a Denver city councilman.</p> <p>With polls showing Romney and Barack Obama tied in Colorado, a few thousand or even just a few hundred votes could tip the state's nine electoral college votes and catapult Gessler to the sort of fame, or infamy, of Katherine Harris, the secretary of state who helped tip Florida for George Bush in 2000.</p> <p>In a combative interview at his office this week Gessler rejected the accusations as smears and said the real threat to a clean vote was \"hear no evil, see no evil\" liberals who tolerated electoral fraud.</p> <p>\"What happens is they have voter registration drives and they don't care if [those who register] are citizens or not. We've seen it groups like Acorn,\" he said, referring to the non-governmental organisation which shut in 2010 after a successful conservative sting operation. </p> <p>\"Elections are how we award power in democracy. And some people are tempted to do bad things to get it. We have to take preventive measures to stop that from happening.\"</p> <p>Gessler grew up in Chicago, a city famous for political chicanery, but said his passion for cleaning voter rolls stemmed from his adopted state's razor-thin margins in local elections. \"We have a history of close races in Colorado.\"</p> <p>He showed the Guardian copies of letters from immigrants who had written to state officials reporting they had been placed on the electoral roll despite not being citizens. \"We know there's a problem.\"</p> <p>He rejected claims from the ACLU and other groups of negligible evidence of voter fraud. \"There are 10 to 12 million illegal immigrants in the US. What's the evidence they're not voting? There is no evidence either way. The absence of evidence of something doesn't prove it doesn't exist.\"</p> <p>Soon after election to his post last year, Gessler, a lawyer by training, launched a wide-ranging review of the electoral register and fought an ultimately successful battle to obtain data from the Department of Homeland Security.</p> <p>In August his office sent letters to 3,900 registered voters identified as potential non-citizens. His office said 141 were found to be non-citizens, of whom 35 had voted in previous elections. Last month letters were sent to 300 other suspected non-citizens.</p> <p>Maes, of the ACLU, said Gessler's investment of time and money to the issue was disproportionate. \"It's a solution in search of a problem.\" The letters had stirred unease among immigrants, she said. \"We're trying to soothe these concerns.\"</p> <p>Alan Kaplan, originally from Bielorussia, received one of the most recent letters despite the fact he has been a citizen since 2001. \"The letter was phrased in a very intimidating way. It seems to question your right to vote. It's had a chilling effect on immigrant communities. I think the timing, right before an election, is very suspect.\"</p> <p>Olivia Mendoza, executive director of <a href=\"http://www.cllaro.org/\">Claro</a>, a public policy group for Colorado Latinos, said Gessler was chasing a \"phantom fear\" and sowing confusion among legitimate voters. \"It's impacting the Latino community immensely, especially among what we call low-information voters.\"</p> <p>In some cases the letters were triggering a backlash, said Mendoza. \"It's almost like a call to arms, as if their ability to vote has been called into question.\"</p> <p>The secretary of state rebuffed such claims. \"There is no evidence, zero, that it's impacting Hispanics. Critics will play the race and the voter intimidation card at a moment's notice.\"</p> <p>Gessler, who has been embroiled in a separate row over <a href=\"http://www.denverpost.com/opinion/ci_21830383/editorial-gessler-needs-repay-taxpayers\">attending partisan political events on the public dime</a>, denied he was following the \"Florida playbook\" \u2013 a reference to that state's Republican-led voter roll \"cleansing\".</p> <p>He said his office had spent $1.1m registering Colorado voters, an initiative which netted more Democrats than Republicans, and that the state's electoral roll was cleaner than ever. He compared his campaign to installing fire alarms. \"Even if a building has no history of fires, it's something you do.\"</p>",
  "<p>In July, <a href=\"http://www.rollcall.com/issues/58_1/John-Boehner-Voters-Need-Not-Love-Mitt-Romney-215934-1.html\">a woman in West Virginia asked</a> Republican House speaker John Boehner \"Can you make me love Mitt Romney?\" Boehner said: \"No. Listen, we're just politicians. I wasn't elected to play God. The American people probably aren't going to fall in love with Mitt Romney.\"</p> <p>But that didn't stop <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/aug/28/republican-task-animating-romney\">Romney's handlers trying</a>. They employed his wife Ann to soften him, invoked his Mormon religion to humanise him, and even called upon Clint Eastwood to vouch for him. But in the end, Boehner was right. The American people were never going to fall in love with him. Indeed, he could <a href=\"http://www.thedailyshow.com/watch/mon-april-2-2012/indecision-2012---endless-suffrage-2012---jump-on-the-bandwagon-edition\">barely</a> get his own party to fall in love with him. Even his running mate, Paul Ryan, waited until the primaries were nearly over and his nomination inevitable, to endorse him with this warm embrace: \"I think we're entering a phase where it could become counterproductive if this drags on much longer, so that's why I think we have to coalesce as conservatives around Mitt Romney.\"</p> <p>Luckily for Romney, they didn't have to love him. In the six years he's been running for president, he's been reintroduced to the public several times to no avail. But when it came down to it, the public needed just 90 minutes during the<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/oct/04/presidential-debate-romney-winner\"> first debate </a>to change their minds. It is telling that while almost everyone concedes he won the night almost nobody can remember a single thing he said. His victory was, in no small part, a reflection of Obama's hapless, hopeless defeat. But it was more than that. He may not have been loveable. But he was plausible \u2013 as a candidate, a human being and a potential president. And that was all he needed to be. Thanks to Obama's weaknesses the bar had been set incredibly low. He didn't even have to skip over it. Just a sure-footed step in the right direction sufficed.</p> <p>From then on, as his poll numbers rose and his confidence grew, the stench of possible victory attached itself to him, overpowering concerns about his likeability and authenticity. That was the smell that permeated the amphitheatre in suburban Denver on Saturday night as several thousand gathered in high spirits to hear the Republican standard-bearer. Unlike most Republican rallies earlier this year, including the convention, they were not going through the motions. They wanted to be there. Spontaneous chants of \"three more days\" rang out among a crowd in boisterous and belligerent mood. Every time Obama's name was mentioned, a man in front shouted, to general approval: \"He's a bum\". While most have clearly warmed to Romney, most there seemed more motivated by their fervent opposition to Obama. Nonetheless, the tone of disappointment rather than anger the Romney campaign had adopted clearly resonated with some. \"Obama's a great man,\" the man behind me whispered to his partner. \"He's just a terrible leader.\"</p> <p>Polls show a narrow majority of Americans believe Obama will win. At least one bookie is already paying out on an Obama victory. But the overwhelming majority of Republicans (71%) believe <a href=\"http://www.gallup.com/poll/158444/americans-give-obama-better-odds-win-election.aspx?utm_source=alert&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=syndication&amp;utm_content=morelink&amp;utm_term=All%20Gallup%20Headlines\">Romney will be the victor</a>. They may be right.</p> <p>Romney is, in many ways, an inadequate conduit for all of this excitement. More comfortable with a PowerPoint presentation than a podium, his arrival on stage marks the end of expectation and the beginning of a more pedestrian affair. He appears without trace and delivers a checklist of Obama's failures and his own plans. It's a workmanlike strategy, which satisfied but hardly roused the Denver audience. The high point of the night came not with a searing indictment of Obama or a soaring projection of a Romney presidency, but with the <a href=\"http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/11/03/a-character-in-a-romney-campaign-anecdote-appears-on-the-trail/\">introduction of a scoutmaster</a> with the American flag that survived the explosion of the Challenger space shuttle in 1986. \"That is a great flag representing the greatest nation in the history of the earth,\" Mr Romney concluded. A touching story, no doubt. But not one that will get laggards to the polls.</p> <p>But a crowd that comes with the express intention of being inspired is difficult to disappoint. He gave them what they wanted and they went home happy.</p> <p>\"Change can't be measured in speeches,\" he said. \"It is measured in achievements \u2026&#xa0;I won't just represent one party. I'll represent one nation.\"</p> <p>This, it turns out, is where the Etch-a-Sketch image has settled \u2013 one-nation Republicanism. No longer the severe conservative ideologue, but the uniter and doer. The turnaround man who can fix the country like he fixed the Olympics, and work with Democrats in Congress like he did in Massachusetts. The fact that it would be voiced to great cheers here, in Colorado, where he suffered a shock defeat to arch-conservative Rick Santorum during the primaries, is illuminating.</p> <p>For in the <a href=\" http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0912/81280.html \">pre-mortems</a> of Romney's candidacy, when it was widely assumed that he was going to lose, the accusation was always that his personality and his campaign were his main liabilities. There were indeed issues with both.</p> <p>Democrats had used the summer to <a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2012/feb/29/mitt-romney-republican-nomination-win-michigan \">frame him</a> as effete and heartless corporate raider \u2013 a theme that had taken hold during the <a href=\"http://www.thenation.com/article/166810/romney-and-santorum-two-faces-gop-capitalism\">primaries</a>. Newt Gingrich branded him a \"vulture capitalist\" for his work at Bain Capital. Back in 2008, his opponent, Mike Huckabee, said: \"[Romney] looks like the guy who fires you, not the guy who hires you.\"</p> <p>By the time the Democrats got to him, the ground had been prepared. Throughout, Romney duly obliged by making $10,000 bets during debates, casually referring to his wife's couple of Cadillacs, and being caught on video disparaging almost half the country.</p> <p>\"I get the feel he's more for big business,\" one supporter in Lansing, Michigan, told me at a Santorum rally. \"I love Nascar, but he has friends who own Nascar teams, and it's difficult to relate to that.\" He emerged from the primary battles damaged and deeply scarred.</p> <p>But a far bigger problem for Romney was the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/sep/23/romney-us-presidential-elections-republicans \">party he sought to represent</a>. To run for the Republican nomination he had to run away from his record as a governor and a senatorial candidate. His support for abortion rights, gun control and healthcare reform and his bipartisan record all had to be denied or distorted for his nomination to stand a chance. On issues like contraception, immigration and taxation, to make sense within the Republican party was to make no sense outside it.</p> <p>Party elders watched in horror as debate crowds cheered Texas governor Rick Perry when he was introduced as a man who'd overseen 234 executions. Rudy Giuliani said that the candidates' statements on some social issues \"make the party look like it isn't a modern party.\" Jeb Bush worried that the candidates were \"appealing to people's fears and emotion,\" and wondered if he could still count himself among them. \"I used to be a conservative,\" he said. To win, Romney had to scare away Latinos and women \u2013 and many remain scared.</p> <p>Even Romney insisted he had his limits. In February he said: \"It's very easy to excite the base with incendiary comments \u2026 I'm not willing to light my hair on fire to try and get support. I am who I am.\" By July, Sarah Palin was insisting that if he couldn't blow himself up the very least he could do was light her candle. (\"Well, light our hair on fire, then!\" she told Fox News).</p> <p>The first debate marked the beginning of his revival because it signalled the moment he started running away from the his primary stances and back towards his record \u2013 or at least part of it. He posed as the moderate who could reach across the aisle and get things done in Massachusetts. If this has made him viable, it has left him no less vulnerable. For every position he takes, there is at least one <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPgfzknYd20\">youtube clip</a> of taking a contrary position elsewhere.</p> <p>His Republican base do not seem to mind that, so long as they think it is a winning strategy. When they selected him, albeit grudgingly, they traded authenticity for viability. They preferred someone who could beat Obama to someone who was right. Now it's Romney's turn to fulfil his part of the deal. With just one day to go, the polls are so tight and close they can almost smell it.</p>",
  "<p>Barring a complete and systematic failure of pretty much every single polling organization in America, Barack Obama will be re-elected president of the United States Tuesday night.</p> <p>Still, no matter what happens on Tuesday \u2013 and even if Mitt Romney pulls off the most extraordinary political surprise in the history of American presidential campaigns \u2013 the more than 18-month slog for the White House provides us with rather clear outlines on the changing nature of the US electorate and the ideological positioning of the two parties. While it would be incomplete and, indeed, probably incorrect to call this a realignment election, there are a number of crucial takeaways from campaign 2012 \u2013 and they augur much brighter days ahead for Democrats than for Republicans.</p> <h2>The Republican party's continued descent into madness</h2> <p>The single most defining element of American politics over the last four years is that the Republican party has fallen out of the crazy tree and hit every branch on the way down. It is no longer even appropriate to say the Republican party is dominated by its conservative wing; but rather, that the GOP is controlled by its extreme, radical wing.</p> <p>The shift of the Republican to the far, far right is not a recent development. Instead, it is reflective of a four-decade shift in ideological orientation in the GOP: from a party once torn between distinct conservative and moderate wings, to one in which moderates have gone the way of dinosaurs and VCRs. But there is no question that in the past four years, the extremism of the GOP has increased dramatically \u2013 so much so that their most recent president, George W Bush, is persona non grata in the party because he is viewed as <em>too moderate</em> and not sufficiently conservative. Imagine that.</p> <p>For years, the national Republican party emboldened this wing of the GOP and made it the vanguard of its efforts to maintain national power. That group now holds ideological sway in the Republican party. In the naked pursuit of short-term partisan gain, the Republican party has unleashed forces that it can no longer fully control.</p> <p>The result is a set of policies that not only are radical, but also are out of step with the mainstream of American politics. This includes everything from efforts to privatize Medicare, eviscerating social security, rejecting any role for fiscal policy other than cutting taxes, and taking the position that illegal immigrants should not receive amnesty but rather \"self-deport\". This is not to mention the GOP's growing extremism on abortion rights and reproductive health in general.</p> <p>Republicans once aspired to, and briefly held, the mantle of a party of ideas. Today, the GOP in its deference to the ideological rigidity of its radical wing has reached a position where Republicans have no serious ideas for reforming healthcare, creating jobs, stimulating the economy, or fixing the nation's crumbling infrastructure. They also have no proposals for achieving energy independence and certainly no thought as to how to save the planet \u2013 particularly since they reject almost unanimously the science underpinning global warming. (Well, I take that back: Republicans have one policy for all these issues \u2013 cut taxes and trim regulation.)</p> <p>This has forced their party standard-bearer, a technocratic moderate from Massachusetts, to become a caricature of a modern conservative. In the process, Romney has adopted a host of toxic policy positions and rhetoric (<a href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2012/09/watch-full-secret-video-private-romney-fundraiser\">remember the 47%</a>) that has dramatically undermined his candidacy. It's always difficult to beat an incumbent president; it's even more difficult when you're not a very good politician. But when your own party hangs around your neck policy positions that narrow, rather than increase, your chances of being elected, it becomes a herculean task. </p> <p>To be sure, one of the most important drivers of the Republican's rightward turn has been the unceasing obstructionism toward President Obama's agenda. From early on, the GOP decided that, for political reasons, it must oppose everything he wanted to do. It was an approach that kept the economy under-performing but did help return Republicans to power in the House of Representatives in 2010. Blanket opposition to Obama's policies and, in particular, economic stimulus is pretty much the only reason this election is even close.</p> <p>If Obama is to win on 6 November, it's possible that Republicans will, at least in the near term, narrow their steadfast hostility to him. Indeed, even against their better judgment, they may find themselves compromising with the White House on the Bush tax cuts and sequestration, just as they compromised on the payroll tax cut in 2012, over the 2011 budget showdown and even on the debt limit.</p> <p>Providing Obama with the stimulus he has so desperately sought, for the past four years, might even suddenly seem acceptable, particularly if a boost in the economy helps incumbent congressional Republicans keep their constituents happy \u2013 and their jobs in place, at the next midterm elections in 2014. Of course, that doesn't mean anyone should get their hopes up: Republicans will still continue to oppose any use of government power and resources to ameliorate social inequalities. And as we get closer to midterm elections in 2014, as well as the next presidential race, it's quite possible, even likely, that GOP obstructionism and obstinacy will get worse.</p> <p>If Romney wins, congressional Republicans might be even less inclined to compromise, but it won't matter much. No one expects them to take back control of the Senate, which means the Republicans' far-right agenda will go no further than the House of Representatives (at least for the first two years of a Romney presidency). If Republicans were to take back the Senate in 2014 (<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate_elections,_2014\">a possibility that can't be completely discounted</a>), this would be a very different story. One could expect them to make a desperate push to enact some variation of the Ryan budget \u2013 and probably succeed.</p> <p>Still, one of the great ironies of this election \u2013 and the capture of the GOP by its extreme wing \u2013 is that if Romney were to emerge victorious, he would be protected from having to enact a more radically conservative agenda \u2026 by Harry Reid. In fact, if Romney were to win, he might even end up being a fairly popular and successful president.</p> <h2>Demographics are destiny</h2> <p>The problem for Republicans, however, is what happens if he loses. In no area of American politics are Republicans more vulnerable and Democrats in better position to capitalize than when it comes to the country's changing demographic make-up. </p> <p>Consider, for a moment, this paradox. On Tuesday night, Barack Obama could potentially lose white voters by 20 points. He's going to get crushed among white men \u2013 and he's still likely to be re-elected, maybe even comfortably.</p> <p>The reason for this is clear: among non-whites, Obama enjoys an extraordinary advantage. Aside from winning practically the entire African-American vote, Obama is likely to prevail among Hispanic voters by considerably more than 30 points. The latest <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/blogs/burns-haberman/\">Latino Decisions poll has him up nearly 50 points</a>.</p> <p>Among younger voters, he is likely to dominate as well. In short, among the demographic groups that represent the future of the American electorate, Democrats enjoy an enormous edge \u2013 and one that will only become more pronounced.</p> <p>It's not hard to understand why this has happened. Young people who came of age in the Bush years naturally gravitated toward Obama. Moreover, these voters tend to be aligned on social issues with Democrats. On the flip side, GOP positions on immigration have alienated Hispanics and moved them toward the Democrats. Beyond young people and minorities, women voters have increasingly turned their back on the GOP because of its uncompromising stances on abortion and reproductive health, as well as the party's attitude toward poverty programs and maintaining the social safety net.</p> <p>Republicans have, for decades, relied on the support of whites, religious and cultural voters, and on rural residents. If Obama were to win Tuesday, it would provide conclusive evidence that this is no longer a 50.1% coalition \u2013 and that for Republicans to win back the presidency, they must broaden their share of the electorate.</p> <p>But here's the rub: there is no easy way for them to do it. Even if Republicans could find a way to work with Obama on an issue like immigration reform (an unlikely scenario considering the die-hard opposition of the Tea Party), a legislative victory for the president would only serve to strengthen his support in the Hispanic community. If Republicans oppose reform, however, they will only dig their hole deeper with the fastest growing demographic group in the country. In fact, if Obama were smart, he would make the Dream Act and comprehensive immigration reform one of his first legislative priorities in 2013.</p> <p>On abortion and reproductive health, it's virtually impossible to imagine any sort of compromise coming from the GOP. And so long as the party has Senate candidates talking about \"legitimate rape\" and children born as a result of rape being gifts from God, things are likely to get worse for the Republican party, before they get better. The same goes for gay marriage and other social issues.</p> <h2>A bluer map</h2> <p>The Democrats' evolving political coalition has also shifted the electoral map in a bluer direction. In states like <a href=\"http://fivethirtyeight.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/11/01/in-nevada-obama-ryan-and-signs-of-a-new-democratic-leaning-normal/\">Nevada</a> and New Mexico, Democrats enjoy a huge advantage because of those states' large Hispanic population. Similar trends can be seen in Colorado, Florida and even Iowa. It is not hard to imagine that Democratic dominance among Hispanic voters will soon put Arizona and even, potentially, Texas in play.</p> <p>In places like Ohio, <a href=\"http://fivethirtyeight.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/11/04/in-virginia-its-tradition-versus-change/\">Virginia</a> and North Carolina, the Democrats' overwhelming advantage among minority voters and, increasingly, among college-educated whites \u2013 another key element of the emerging Democratic coalition \u2013&#xa0;has put these states into play and even leaning blue.</p> <p>Flip the map for a second to look at it from a Republican perspective and things get ugly quickly. Look, for example, at the <a href=\"http://electoralmap.net/PastElections/past_elections.php?year=2000\">2000 electoral map</a>. Of the states won by Al Gore that year, only Iowa and perhaps Wisconsin are even in play this cycle. Conversely, seven states that Bush won that year are swing states or leaning Democratic. From a starting point of 271 electoral votes (one more than the bare minimum needed to win a national election), Republicans have seen their electoral map narrow rather than widen.</p> <h2>A recovering economy</h2> <p>There is one final consideration. As the economy has steadily improved, so, too, have President Obama's approval ratings. All economic indicators indicate that this will be a continuing trend, which means that if Obama were to win Tuesday, he would see his political standing rise as unemployment continues to fall. (Of course, if Romney were to win, he would be the beneficiary of this improving economy.) Throw in the fact that as Obamacare becomes the law of the land and provides a new entitlement for middle-class Americans, the Democrat's long-term policy advantage could be strengthened even further.</p> <p>None of this is meant to suggest that Republicans won't continue to be a competitive national party. The problem, however, is similar to that faced by Democrats 20-30 years ago: when your base is shrinking, how do you appeal to a broader cross-section of the electorate?</p> <p>The fact is, there is no easy way for Republicans do it. The GOP needs desperately to reform itself, to cast aside its most radical and extreme wing, and to moderate its policies to appeal to an electorate that is dramatically changing. Democrats simply need to continue the policies \u2013 and political approach \u2013 that has given them a political advantage going into election day.</p> <p>What this means is that, should Romney lose tomorrow and Obama emerge victorious, we may be on the cusp of a dramatic shift in national politics.</p>",

  "<p>George Osborne has joined forces with the German finance minister, Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, to announce an international crackdown on tax avoidance by big multinationals, such as eBay and Amazon.</p> <p>Osborne said he and Sch\u00e4uble, meeting at the G20 finance ministers's summit in Mexico, had called for \"concerted international co-operation to strengthen international tax standards that at the minute may mean international companies can pay less tax than they would otherwise owe\".</p> <p>Neither man was eager to identity individual corporate culprits, but government sources said the spread of e-commerce and the ponderous nature of international corporate tax rules have left governments trailing behind multinationals as they shift profits around the globe.</p> <p>The two men, determined to give the issue a political push, said they would back the OECD's current work on identifying possible gaps in the standards, as a first step in promoting a better way of dealing with profit shifting and base erosion of corporate tax at the global level. The OECD is viewed as the guardian of global tax standards.</p> <p>Trying to show a balance between his defence of low tax rates and the need to act against firms that repeatedly pay virtually no tax, Osborne said: \"We want competitive taxes that say Britain is open for business and that attract global companies to invest in and bring jobs to our country, but we also want global companies to pay those taxes. The best way to achieve that is through international action that ensures strong standards, without pricing ourselves out of the global market.\"</p> <p>The joint statement by the two countries \u2013 a rare example of Anglo-German co-operation \u2013 said: \"International tax standards have had difficulty keeping up with changes in global business practices, such as the development of e-commerce in commercial activities.\"</p> <p>It adds: \"As a result, some multinational businesses are able to shift the taxation of their profits away from the jurisdictions where they are being generated, thus minimising their tax payments compared to smaller, less international companies.\"</p> <p>In the statement, Britain and Germany said they expect the first report from the OECD at the next G20 meeting in Russia in February 2013.</p> <p>The two men agreed their joint approach when the chancellor visited Berlin on Thursday. The co-operation comes ahead of a meeting between David Cameron and Angela Merkel on Wednesday.</p> <p>Government sources said there was growing international political support for a crackdown on some of these multinationals that were in some cases either paying next to no tax or funelling profits to low corporation tax regimes such as the Cayman Islands, the Netherlands or Ireland. The sources added there was equal determination to act in the US, even though many of the companies under the microscope are US-based.</p> <p>Changes to the international standards have to be agreed at the international level. But the British government believes there have been time lags in updates to technical tax standards that may be creating unintentional gaps in them. The OECD will present the next stage of its proposals to its committee of fiscal affairs (CFA) on 16 November in Paris.</p> <p>Britain has the lowest rate of corporation tax in the G7, and has cut its rate by more than any other G20 country over the past two years (from 28% in 2010 to 22% by 2014). In the last year, around half of the \u00a3136bn of taxes paid in the UK by the biggest businesses, came from foreign-owned businesses; while inward investment created or safeguarded more than 100,000 jobs.</p> <p>THe HMRC has raised more than \u00a31.5bn since March 2010 through increased efforts in tackling transfer pricing. The transfer pricing rules aim to ensure that multinationals pay the right amount of tax by determining the taxable profits of each company as if it were an independent entity trading on arm's length terms with other members of the same group.</p>",

A serve out wide followed by a drive volleyball, deuce. A fourth breakpoint follows -- and finally Muray breaks when Berdych sends a forehand long.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/toady/status/265471509714329600\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>@<a href=\"https://twitter.com/seaningle\">seaningle</a>caption comp: \"injury lawyers 4U?

We loved salsa! We were Marxists! We were Leninists!\" said salsa musician Felix Codo, 60, jokily thrusting a fist into the air at a bar. In cities across Guinea, Mali and Senegal, dancefloors buzzed with similar rhythms as those countries pioneered the golden age of African salsa.</p> <p>When the country ended its troubled romance with Marxism in 1991 and thousands of Cubans quit Benin, Codo found there was still a hankering for both the dance and the music. He responded by setting up the country's first formal salsa dancing club.</p> <p>\"I'd guess 80% of kids today still like salsa. There are local bands singing salsa at a quality that approaches what is coming out of the US and Latin America,\" said Codo, who launched a national \"Queen of Salsa\" dancing competition three years ago. Benin's ministry of culture is in talks with him about holding the first international salsa festival in Africa.</p> <p>Anays Feliu stayed in Benin after many of her Cuban compatriots left. One day, a local businessman approached her, desperate to learn the dance. She now runs four packed weekly classes.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/J2tupmHwZEU?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"283\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/J2tupmHwZEU\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>\"Salsa has become more popular every year,\" said Feliu, after spending the afternoon tracking down an <a href=\"http://www.muzu.tv/search/?mySearch=Alberto+Barros&amp;login-bt.x=0&amp;login-bt.y=0\" title=\"\">Alberto Barros</a> disc in the market. When the Colombian music began playing, the gathered dancers loudly sang along, although no one spoke Spanish.</p> <p>Part of salsa's lasting appeal may be that at least some of its roots can be traced to here. The millions shipped from the Slave Coast, which included Benin, carried their music to the Americas, where it mixed with Spanish guitars to create \"son\", the precursor to modern salsa and Congolese rumba among others.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/tsIXzRtqyiA?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"283\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/tsIXzRtqyiA\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>\"The source of salsa is Benin.

Vodoun gave birth to the bells used in salsa. Salsa is partly a modernisation of the sounds of vodoun.\"</p> <p>In the open air bar, he and his drinking buddies demonstrated by bursting into song, accompanied by tapping on the table tops.</p> <p>Across the street, a group of children started dancing a hybrid of salsa steps and a local dance. \"You see? Even the kids like it,\" Ahehehinnou said with a triumphant cackle.</p>",

Welcome to Middle East Live. Here is a round-up of the latest developments.</p> <h2>Syria</h2> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/nov/04/syria-opposition-united-qatar-conference\"><strong>Sharp disagreements have emerged at a Syrian opposition conference in Qatar meant to forge a more cohesive leadership.</strong></a> The Syrian National Council has balked at a plan backed by western powers that would dilute the SNC's influence. But with international pressure mounting, it also suggested it was willing to negotiate a compromise that would give it more influence in a new leadership team. The SNC is due to decide on Wednesday whether to accept a plan proposed by a prominent dissident, Riad Seif, to set up a new leadership group of about 50 members. The SNC would get about 15 seats, while military commanders and local leaders in rebel-held areas would win wider representation. SNC chief Abdelbaset Sieda said he and others in the group no longer trusted promises of international support linked to restructuring of the opposition. He said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We faced this situation before, when we formed the SNC. There were promises like that, but the international community in fact did not give us the support needed for the SNC to do its job.</p> </blockquote> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2012/11/201211552650353858.html\"><strong>The UN-Arab League envoy to Syria, Lakhdar Brahimi, has called for a new UN security council resolution to formalise an declaration adopted in Geneva in June, which called for a transitional administration but did not specify what role, if any, Assad would take.</strong></a> The initiative came after Brahimi met the Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrovin Cairo yesterday. Brahimi said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It is important that the Geneva Declaration be turned into a resolution from the security council to gain the power to enable it to become an applicable political project.</p> </blockquote> <p>Al-Jazeera reported that Lavrov dismissed the need for a resolution, saying \u201csome countries which participated in Geneva don't speak with the government but only with the opposition and encourage them to fight till victory and this has very negative implications\u201d.</p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/sns-rt-us-syria-damascus-bombardmentbre8a409w-20121104,0,3187029.story\"><strong>The Syrian army has bombarded rebel strongholds in southern Damascus on Monday with artillery and from the air, hours after opposition fighters attacked militia loyal to President Bashar al-Assad, opposition activists told Reuters.</strong></a> Warplanes fired rockets and tanks and artillery pounded the neighbourhoods of Sbeineh, Yalda, Bibla, al-Tadamun and Hajar a-Aswad, they said. The working-class Sunni Muslim neighbourhoods have been at the forefront of the 19-month-old revolt against Assad</p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/A/AS_JAPAN_SYRIA?SECTION=HOME&amp;SITE=AP&amp;TEMPLATE=DEFAULT\"><strong>Japan is to host international talks in late November aimed at widening sanctions against Syria, it said today.</strong></a>Existing sanctions include freezing assets of the Syrian president and military leaders and an embargo on oil and arms trade with Syria.</p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/nov/04/syria-rebels-capture-oilfield\"><strong>Syrian rebels captured an oilfield in the east of the country on Sunday after three days of fierce fighting with government troops protecting the facility, activists said</strong></a>. The head of the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, Rami Abdul-Rahman, said rebels overran the al-Ward oilfield in the province of Deir el-Zour near the border with Iraq. About 40 soldiers were guarding the facility that the rebels had been pounding for the past three days, he said, adding that opposition fighters also captured several regime troops.</p> <h2>Kuwait</h2> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/nov/04/teargas-protesters-kuwait-city\"><strong>Kuwaiti security forces have fired teargas to disperse a banned demonstration by about 2,000 opposition supporters against new voting rules for parliamentary elections due on 1 December.</strong></a> The emir announced changes to the electoral law last month which some opposition politicians say are an attempt to give pro-government candidates an advantage in the polls.</p> <h2>Libya</h2> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/nov/04/libya-militia-fire-central-tripoli\"><strong>Rival Libyan militias fired guns and rocket-propelled grenades at each other in Tripoli on Sunday and set fire to a former intelligence building in one of the worst breakdowns in security in the capital since the fall of Muammar Gaddafi</strong></a>. At least five people were wounded and a stray bullet entered a hospital in the city centre, where residents rushed to arm themselves, saying calls to police had gone unheeded. After more than 12 hours, the army moved in.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-11-05T11:29:30.705Z\">at 11.29am GMT</time></p>  </div>",

  "<p>The announcement by chocolate manufacturer Hershey in October that it would source all of its cocoa from certified sources by 2020 is further evidence that certification is not a niche market activity.</p> <p>Mars, Incorporated made a similar commitment in April, 2009, while Mondeleez (Kraft's new name for its confectionery business), and Unilever (owners of the Magnum ice-cream brand) are all buying certified cocoa for their chocolate. The Rainforest Alliance system alone has 60,000 certified cocoa farms in its programme.</p> <p>Certification awards a certificate to a producer or group of producers to confirm compliance with a set of practices detailed in a standard. Well-known certification bodies differ mainly because of the differing standards on which they are based. In Rainforest Alliance's case, <a href=\"http://www.sanstandards.org\" title=\"\">the sustainable agriculture standard</a> deals with how the farmer manages the land and how people working on it are treated, including the farmer and any workers \u2013 and are subject to continuous improvement and local interpretation as our knowledge and understanding evolves..</p> <p>The cocoa industry embraced certification much later than the coffee industry, with the major growth only happening in the last few years. We have seen a steady growth in chocolate products bearing certification seals. But this is not the main driver of the expansion of certification in the cocoa industry. Most of the work is unseen by the consumer, as the industry addresses a crucial supply issue: cocoa markets are growing strongly, but cocoa farmers have generally low productivity and low incomes. With land a finite resource, and young people wanting to live better than their parents, the issue is where cocoa in the following decades is going to come from.</p> <p>Certification is part of a major push by cocoa and chocolate companies to modernise the industry. Nobody wins if cocoa farmers are so poor that their children abandon the farm and move to the city, or if the soil is so exhausted and the trees so old that they don't produce a decent harvest. No company wants illegal child labour in its supply chain and nor do the governments of the major producing countries in West Africa. It's unacceptable in today's market.</p> <p>The unseen work that is happening to address this significant supply chain risk involves training farmers in improved and sustainable management techniques, increasing their access to business and financial services, strengthening their organisations, developing more productive planting material and the nurseries to grow them, research into soil management and many other aspects affecting a farm's productivity.</p> <p>This work was included in the <a href=\"http://www.iied.org/new-business-models-for-sustainable-trade\" title=\"\">new business models for sustainable trade project</a>, for which we partnered with the <a href=\"http://www.sustainablefoodlab.org/\" title=\"\">Sustainable Food Laboratory</a>, <a href=\"http://crs.org/\" title=\"\">Catholic Relief Services</a>, the <a href=\"http://www.iied.org/\" title=\"\">International Institute for Environment and Development</a> (IIED) and <a href=\"http://www.ciat.cgiar.org/Paginas/index.aspx\" title=\"\">The International Centre for Tropical Agriculture</a>.</p> <p>This project \u2013 on which <a href=\"http://pubs.iied.org/pdfs/16034IIED.pdf\" title=\"\">a new report is published by the IIED</a> \u2013 has deepened our institutional knowledge about how market systems can be coupled with critical on-the-ground services which farmers need to advance toward stability, profitability and long term sustainable practices.</p> <p>It is not just the companies with leading high street brands that are involved. Companies supplying cocoa beans and processing them into chocolate ingredients are working directly with the farmers to upgrade their skills and knowledge. It is they, alongside the Rainforest Alliance, that has trained the 60,000 certified farmers. That is how certification has grown so quickly as part of an effort to make sure there is enough cocoa produced under good environmental and ethical conditions without needing to clear forests and damaging fragile ecosystems for new planting.</p> <p>Much is made of the premium prices associated with certified products. Farmers expect to be paid more for certified products because of the effort they have made to achieve the certification. But the real gain is not in the market but on the farm. <a href=\"http://www.rainforest-alliance.org/sites/default/files/publication/pdf/ra-certification-cocoa-cote-divoire-cosa_0.pdf\" title=\"\">An independent survey published in 2012</a> found that Rainforest Alliance certified farms in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire registered as much as 70% more productivity than a control group of non-certified farms. The improved earnings of the farmer do not depend on a niche market; they come directly from the farm management.</p> <p>Sustaining and further increasing these achievements will secure the cocoa supply that the world needs and provide a competitive livelihood for the next generation of cocoa farmers. Brands will continue to use certification seals but the bigger focus is, and must remain, on the farmer and the farm, which is where certification bodies started out.</p> <p><em>Edward Millard is director of sustainable landscapes for the </em><a href=\"http://www.rainforest-alliance.org.uk/\" title=\"\"><em>Rainforest Alliance</em></a></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by </strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/guardian-professional\" title=\"\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

  "<p>One response to the development impasse caused by modernisation and dependency theories <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2012/oct/30/neoliberalism-approach-development-ignored-past-lessons\" title=\"\">was \"can do\" neoliberalism</a>; another involved reflection on the very purpose of development. This took shape across \"alternative\" approaches including environment, gender and sustainability. All these approaches grew up alongside the neoliberal right, but most were drowned out, for a time at least, by its noisiness.</p> <p>Perhaps the most distinctive new approach, however \u2013 one set on meeting the new right's noisiness with a strategic and all-encompassing silence \u2013 was the post-development thinking embodied by the work of Colombian scholar Arturo Escobar.</p> <p>Escobar's ideas are best summed up in his 1995 book <a href=\"http://books.google.co.uk/books/about/Encountering_Development.html?id=Y35aclb012YC\" title=\"\">Encountering Development</a>, which offered much more than an analysis of mainstream development economics or the sprawling array of development actors and institutions it spawned. It was a critique of the whole rotten edifice of western ideas that supported development, which Escobar regarded as a contradiction in terms and a sham. For Escobar, development amounted to little more than the west's convenient \"discovery\" of poverty in the third world for the purposes of reasserting its moral and cultural superiority in supposedly post-colonial times.</p> <p>Escobar felt development was, unavoidably, both an ideological export (something Walt Rostow would willingly have admitted) and a simultaneous act of cultural imperialism. With its highly technocratic language and forthright deployment of norms and value judgements, it was also a form of cultural imperialism that poor countries had little means of declining politely. \"Perhaps no other idea has been so insidious, no other idea gone so unchallenged,\" Escobar sneered.</p> <p>But what exactly did he mean? Surely some planning is better than outright anarchy? Surely, whatever one's political views, when confronted by a world as unequal as our own, it is important to try to do something?</p> <p>As a glance at his intellectual influences suggests, Escobar's argument was a good deal more sophisticated than such questions allow. The first of these influences was the French philosopher Michel Foucault and his idea that power is not simply something that (rich, powerful) people hold over others, but is produced in and through all the things we do \u2013 even things like helping others. Through Foucault, Escobar came to the conclusion that development planning was not only a problem to the extent that it failed; it was a problem even when it succeeded, because it so strongly set the terms for how people in poor countries could live. Told how to behave, poor people were made subjects of development as much as they were subjects of their own government.</p> <p>Escobar also sought to channel the insights of the Palestinian literary theorist <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/2003/sep/26/guardianobituaries.highereducation\" title=\"\">Edward Said</a> and his analysis of what he termed \"Orientalism\". Said had shown how western constructions of the Orient as exotic and enticing, yet also dangerous, were not merely passive descriptions of other people and places, they were central to the imaginative production of those places. And they were usually constructed either as sites of excess (sexuality, say) or conversely as lacking in some fundamental value (civilisation, say). In either case, those abnormalities needed bringing into line. Development was just a modern way of doing this: a re-enactment of Orientalist tropes in technocratic guise. Hence it was ultimately a way for the west to manage the rest for their own gain, only ever allowing poor people a future that the rich could imagine for them.</p> <p>Coming at a time when western universities were in the grip of the postmodern challenge to systems of knowledge, Escobar's post-development critique sparked considerable debate. Coming at a time when mainstream development was beginning to incorporate a softer, more human approach alongside the market-driven solutions of the 1980s, Escobar found ever more evidence to support his ideas. As he saw it, the more the development industry claimed to be improving on past practice \u2013 as it tramped from anti-poverty to pro-poor to <a href=\"http://www.un.org/esa/policy/wess/wess2010workshop/wess2010_emmerij.pdf\" title=\"\">basic human needs approaches</a> \u2013 the more it continued to fall into the serious trap of imposing a western agenda on others.</p> <p>But if the first finger that people lift to help is on a hand destined to meddle, what are those who wish to see a fairer world to do? While some anti-development writers have encouraged a back-to-the-soil populism in response, Escobar's answer is again a good deal more sophisticated. For him the answer lies in creating space \u2013 intellectual first and foremost \u2013 for \"local agency\" to assert itself. In practice this means one of two things:</p> <p>First, it means encouraging local communities and traditions rooted in local identities to address their own problems. Not buying into the western development agenda does not mean denying that some societies lack both resources and power relative to others. This was an argument that Escobar developed in dialogue with feminist scholars like Vandana Shiva, and it can be found today in such initiatives as the <a href=\"http://www.palgrave-journals.com/development/journal/v54/n4/full/dev201186a.html\" title=\"\">Buen Vivir</a> moment in Latin America.</p> <p>Second, and related to this first, it means criticising any existing distortions \u2013 economic or political \u2013 that limit peoples' ability to develop. Escobar has therefore been highly critical of <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/8208254.stm\" title=\"\">free trade zones</a>, such as the <a href=\"http://www.udel.edu/leipzig/texts2/vox128.htm\" title=\"\"><em><i>maquiladoras</i></em></a> in Mexico, or what is happening on a vaster scale in parts of China. Instead, he points to a politics of \"degrowth\" as a way of addressing some of these distortions.</p> <p>But can local always be the answer to the problems of globalisation? As many have argued, and as Escobar would doubtless acknowledge, when there are material differences in life chances (not to mention life expectancy) between different places, an excessive localism may end up as no less essentialising than an all-out universalism: little more than a romanticism of the poor.</p> <p>But these are lessons that development has in large measure learned (which isn't to say it doesn't repeat many others). And if it has indeed failed to the extent that great poverty still exists, it has nonetheless helped bring about remarkable gains in life chances and opportunities. It has done this, moreover, despite as much as because of the unequalising effects of global capitalism.</p>",
  "<p><a href=\"http://www.roh.org.uk/news/liam-scarlett-appointed-royal-ballet-artist-in-residence\" title=\"\">Liam Scarlett's appointment</a> as the Royal Ballet's new artist in residence comes at an ideal point in his career. With a creative space guaranteed within the company, this precociously talented 25-year-old now has the freedom to take risks, even to chance failure.</p> <p>Not that Scarlett comes close to failing in Viscera, a work first commissioned by Miami City Ballet and now entering the Royal's repertory. It is set to <a href=\"http://www.lowellliebermann.com/\" title=\"\">Lowell Liebermann</a>'s Piano Concerto No 1, a dark, fast thriller of a score that has the piano skittering through blaring shards of brass and strings. And Scarlett harnesses his music in a language of equal ferocity: pirouettes slick as mercury; lifts that soar and drop with heart-skipping abruptness; rhythmic counterpoint as sharp as whiplash.</p> <p>Even in the context of this purely abstract work, Scarlett is a natural storyteller. The pas de deux at the centre of the ballet may be a showcase of inventively unfolding partnerwork, yet it feels fraught with emotional secrets: opening on a long, questioning stillness and closing on a half-finished answer, as the two dancers separate almost mid-phrase.</p> <p>We're lucky to be here at the start of Scarlett's career. Even luckier that Scarlett is not the only in-house choreographer: the progamme's <a href=\"http://www.randomdance.org/wayne_mcgregor\" title=\"\">Wayne McGregor</a> and <a href=\"http://www.roh.org.uk/about/the-royal-ballet/christopher-wheeldon\" title=\"\">Christopher Wheeldon</a> have equally strong ties with the company. The centrepiece is a revival of McGregor's Infra, which looks better with every viewing. Perhaps it is because the extremes of McGregor's language \u2013 its startling dislocations and eerie fluency \u2013 have become secondnature to the dancers. Certainly Infra's narrative subtext, with its sad, angry, anxious vignettes of urban life, reads with a haunting legibility.</p> <p>The programme ends with Christopher Wheeldon's Fool's Paradise, a work first created with his own ensemble, Morphoses. On the surface it looks unfeasibly exquisite, its perfectly sculpted images bathed in golden light and washed by the gentle harmonies of <a href=\"http://jobytalbot.com/#/home\" title=\"\">Joby Talbot</a>'s score. But there is a bracing undertow of danger. When the couples dance together along tightrope-fine lines, they appear to be skating on thin ice. If there is beauty here, it is always precarious.</p> <p>Anyone who queries ballet's viability as a 21st-century art form would find their answer in this programme \u2013 and not only in the quality of the choreography and music. This is work that elicits fabulously alert dancing at every level, from principal all the way to junior level.</p>",
  "<p>The Financial Times has thrown its weight behind a second term in the White House for Barack Obama, <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/f11742fa-2501-11e2-8924-00144feabdc0.html#axzz2BHaUclbb\" title=\"\">endorsing the incumbent</a> as \"the better choice\" for a country still struggling to recover from the economic crisis.</p> <p>While bemoaning a lacklustre campaign in which both candidates displayed \"a poverty of ambition\", the British newspaper on Monday cited the president's handling of the recent east coast storm as an illustration of why he, rather than Mitt Romney, deserved Americans' votes.</p> <p>\"As in his response to hurricane Sandy, Mr Obama has shown that purposeful government can be part of the solution rather than the problem,\" it remarked. \"Four years on from the financial crisis, with extreme inequality an affront to the American dream, there remains a need for intelligent, reformist governance. Mr Obama, his presidency defined by the economic crisis, looks the better choice.\"</p> <p>But the endorsement, which comes soon after similar backing from the London-based current affairs magazine the Economist, was far from ringing. While documenting some of the high points of Obama's first term \u2013 including healthcare reform, for instance, and a $787bn (\u00a3490bn) stimulus package \"that saved the country from another Great Depression\" \u2013 the FT also detailed several weaknesses, such as his \"notably cool\" stance on business. \"The self-proclaimed agent of change,\" it said, \"has at crucial points failed to exercise leadership.\"</p> <p>But the FT shows little ambivalence towards Obama's opponent. While commenting that Romney appears \"a man comfortable with exercising executive power\", it noted a \"needlessly belligerent\" foreign policy and, more importantly, it said, an economic strategy that raised as many questions as it answered.</p> <p>\"[Romney] \u2026 has gone through so many contortions to win his party's nomination that it is hard to see how he would govern in practice. His wishlist includes an aspiration to raise Pentagon spending by a fifth while cutting everyone's taxes and still somehow balancing the books. Such fiscal alchemy is an exercise in evasion, not a recipe for sustainable economic recovery.\"</p> <h2>What the papers say</h2> <p><strong>The Economist (for Obama)</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.economist.com/news/leaders/21565623-america-could-do-better-barack-obama-sadly-mitt-romney-does-not-fit-bill-which-one\" title=\"\">\"A man who once personified hope and centrism</a> set a new low by unleashing attacks on Mitt Romney even before the first Republican primary.

And can America really trust the ever-changing Mitt Romney to do a better job? On that basis, the Democrat narrowly deserves to be re-elected \u2026 For all his businesslike intentions, Mr Romney has an economic plan that works only if you don't believe most of what he says. That is not a convincing pitch for a chief executive. And for all his shortcomings, Mr Obama has dragged America's economy back from the brink of disaster, and has made a decent fist of foreign policy. So this newspaper would stick with the devil it knows, and re-elect him.\"</p> <p><strong>The New York Times (for Obama)</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/28/opinion/sunday/barack-obama-for-president.html?pagewanted=1&amp;_r=1&amp;ref=opinion\" title=\"\">\"President Obama has shown a firm commitment</a> to using government to help foster growth.

Mitt Romney, the former governor of Massachusetts, has gotten this far with a guile that allows him to say whatever he thinks an audience wants to hear. But he has tied himself to the ultraconservative forces that control the Republican party and embraced their policies, including reckless budget cuts and 30-year-old, discredited trickle-down ideas. Voters may still be confused about Mr Romney's true identity, but they know the Republican party, and a Romney administration would reflect its agenda.

His modulating positions on his own tax plan, healthcare reform, financial regulation, Medicare, immigration and the national safety net add to the impression that the only thing he really stands for is his own election. Voters face a momentous choice in November between two candidates offering sharply different prescriptions for what ails the country. Obama's recalls the successful formula of the 1990s, when the government raised taxes and slowed spending to close the deficit. The alternative offered by Romney would neglect the country's infrastructure and human resources for the sake of yet another tax cut and a larger defence budget than even the Pentagon is seeking.

Which candidate could forge the compromises in Congress to achieve these goals? When the question is framed in those terms, Mitt Romney emerges the stronger candidate \u2026 Barack Obama rocketed to the presidency from relative obscurity with a theme of hope and change. A different reality has marked his presidency. His record on the economy in the past four years does not suggest he would lead in the direction the nation must go in the next four years.

Starting in September 1940, when an opportunistic Mussolini sent 80,000 troops in an attempt to carve out an African empire, the conflict lasted for over two years, as British and Axis forces swept back and forth across the desert. Hitler sent in General Rommel and the Afrika Corps with orders to push the British out of Egypt, while Churchill became fanatical about saving the Middle East. Dimbleby pops up around the region to narrate a punchy history. <em>Martin Skegg</em></p> <h2>Border Wars: Stacey Dooley In The USA<br>9pm, BBC3</h2> <p>The last of Stacey Dooley's reports from her American visit finds her at the US/Mexico border, facing firsthand the desperation that drives people to make the perilous and expensive journey towards what they hope will be a better life north of the border. Dooley's chirpy manner and cherubic face ensure people instantly open up to her, even in the dangerous, cartel-run border town of Altar, south of Tucson. She charms migrants and US border patrol officers alike, so it's almost physically impossible to dislike her, despite the journalistic shortcomings. <em>BA</em></p> <h2>Nigel Slater: Life Is Sweets<br>9pm, BBC4</h2> <p>Sweets, says Nigel Slater, are like \"a roadmap through my life\". It's the starting point for a documentary that in other hands could easily be a dull exercise in Chopper-bikes-and-Grange-Hill-yay! reportage. Instead, the food writer, while delighting in retro packaging and adverts, movingly uses his nostalgia for confectionary past as a way to explore the relationship between taste and memory. Followed by Toast, a welcome re-run for the dramatisation of Slater's acclaimed memoir. <em>Jonathan Wright</em></p> <h2>Girls<br>10pm, Sky Atlantic</h2> <p>Hannah finally decides to dump Adam, the simian succubus she can't seem to stop emotionally investing in even though he treats her like a home-delivery pizza. Shoshanna desperately tries to ditch her virginity but finds it more of a stigma than even she had realised. And Jessa misplaces the children she is looking after, calling for some quick dad-mollifying, which isn't a problem if you look like Jessa. If you can get past the fact they're all being excruciating, just like you were/are in your 20s, this is superbly well-written, horrifically honest and seriously funny.<em> Julia Raeside</em></p> <p></p> <h2>Tuesday</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398816729\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/11/2/1351870872551/Zawe-Ashton-as-Vod-in-Fre-010.jpg\" alt=\"Zawe Ashton as Vod in Fresh Meat.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Zawe Ashton as Vod in Fresh Meat (Channel 4).

He obviously has a scientific brain, as demonstrated in his previous show, School Of Hard Sums, which was a batty mix of comic banter and puzzle solving. With this new series, he has a team of scientists to help him tackle a different subject each week (sex, Einstein and brain chemistry, to name a few), with in-depth discussion, exploratory reports and, worryingly, a lively studio audience. <em>MS</em></p> <h2>Heston's Fantastical Food<br>9pm, Channel 4</h2> <p>When Jamie Oliver sought to change the eating habits of British schoolchildren, it resulted in motions being passed through Parliament. In this new series opener, Heston says he wants to remind us that breakfast is more important than a lie-in \u2013 although he's unlikely to get the Commons debating gigantic boiled eggs, supersized Shreddies, and general George's Marvellous Medicine-style tomfoolery. Fantastical Food is best consumed at face value: a fun CBeebies-style romp \"to make us feel like kids again\", presented by a bloke who looks like Brains from the Weetabix gang. <em>Ali Catterall</em></p> <h2>Fresh Meat<br>10pm, Channel 4</h2> <p>Josie coaxes Heather into a boozy girls' night out just before their first practical exam, and the resulting carnage results in the house getting burgled. Most things are replaceable, except JP's dad's ashes. There's worse to come for Josie whose hungover, shaking hands cause a horrific dentistry mishap. Elsewhere, Vod has designs on handyman Al, who comes to fix the locks and ends up becoming JP's \"local\" friend \u2013 and a suspect in Howard's investigation into the burglary. <em>HV</em></p> <h2>Britain On Film: A Woman's Place<br>8.30pm, BBC4</h2> <p>Between 1959 and 1969, the Special Features Division of Rank produced short documentaries to serve as curtain-raisers for the main feature at their cinemas. They were called the Look At Life series and, taken as a whole, now amount to an invaluably guileless contemporary record of Britain in the 60s. This episode focuses on the depictions of women in the films which, given the period chronicled, were equal parts the early stirrings of feminism, and the strictures and stereotypes the movement sought to overturn. <em>Andrew Mueller</em></p> <h2>Some Girls<br>10pm, BBC3</h2> <p>\"Just because we live on an estate, doesn't mean we're all single mums with drug problems ... I mean, obviously some of us are,\" says Viva, pointing at her friend Mel. Amber is the dizzy one. Holly is violent and Saz is sarcastic. They all play for the same school football team and banter for England. It's that brand of jaunty depravity made popular by Shameless but Febrezed thoroughly and nicely delivered by the young cast. Plus Dolly Wells is brilliant as their sadistic New Zealand PE teacher. In this opening episode Viva storms out when her dad and his new girlfriend make an announcement. <em>JNR</em></p> <h2>Romanzo Criminale<br>10pm, Sky Arts 1</h2> <p>The conclusion to the second series, and you can be assured that there will not be a third. A shame for those who have acquired the nicotine-like habit of this drama about a band of impetuous gangsters who made a good fist of trying to extort the entire city of Rome. It's 1989 \u2013 Buffoni and Scrocchiazeppi are out of prison, while Dandi is now the slicked-back top dog who has fared the best, but at whose expense? Scores are settled in an elegantly grim endgame set against the context of the Berlin Wall's collapse and a cheesy Euro-soundtrack. <em>David Stubbs</em></p> <p></p> <h2>Wednesday</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398816730\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/11/2/1351871019428/Brazil-with-Michael-Palin-010.jpg\" alt=\"Brazil with Michael Palin\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Brazil with Michael Palin (BBC1) Photograph: Basil Pao/BBC/Prominent Productions/Basil</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Basil Pao/BBC/Prominent Productions/Basil</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Great British Property Scandal: Every Empty Counts<br>8pm, Channel 4</h2> <p>George Clarke is back, crusading to get Britain's empty homes back into use. After he started his campaign last year, thousands have reported vacant properties and even more have signed his online petition, but there are still one million homes lying empty. George isn't happy \u2013 you can tell by the fact that his whole script seems to be written in an angry upper case. There is good news, though, as the government has coughed up money to help, and war veterans are renovating empties in Mansfield. <em>MS</em></p> <h2>Brazil With Michael Palin<br>9pm, BBC1</h2> <p>Third instalment of Palin's yomp around the titular South American nation. He's certainly got his jaunt in early; as hosts of both the next World Cup and Olympics, Brazil will become the most over-analysed country on earth during the next four years. It merits the scrutiny \u2013 Brazil's emergence is one of the more under-discussed phenomena of this century. Tonight, Palin visits the Brazilian city everyone knows something about: Rio. Among the questions asked: why are Brazilians such consistently superior footballers? <em>AM</em></p> <h2>Secret State<br>10pm, Channel 4</h2> <p>At the start of this four-part series, we arrive in the afterrmath of an explosion at a US-owned chemical plant in north-east England. Nineteen people are dead, the community is in uproar, and the deputy prime minister (Gabriel Byrne) isn't having much luck pouring oil, so to speak, on troubled waters. When a helpful investigative journalist (Gina McKee) directs him to a confidential report on the company, it highlights the first steps on a murky trail of cover-ups. A well-cast, well-played conspiracy drama which, somewhat inevitably, goes \"right to the very top\". <em>John Robinson</em></p> <h2>Breakfast, Lunch And Dinner<br>9pm, BBC4</h2> <p>Clarissa Dickson Wright is one of the few TV naturals, someone whose charisma suggests a person briefly contained by the medium rather than gearing their whole life towards appearing in it. In this enjoyable new series, she considers our three main meals and discovers the social, technological and health histories behind them. First, the most important meal of the day, breakfast, and to a bikers' caf\u00e9 where a \"full English\" may be ordered alongside a pint of lager on a Friday night. A far cry from the middle ages, where bacon and eggs came to be combined on \"Collop Monday\" \u2013 when they would be used up before Lent. <em>JR</em></p> <h2>The Comic Strip Presents: Five Go To Rehab<br>9pm, GOLD</h2> <p>Marking 30 years since inaugural Strip offering Five Go Mad in Dorset, Peter Richardson reunites the team in cosy Middle England. Original cast members Jennifer Saunders, Adrian Edmondson and Dawn French (and canine Timmy) star again as the Five, back together after 30 years apart, a spell that has forced four-fifths of the quintet to confront the grim reality of modern life. Following last year's weak Hunt For Tony Blair, this is a pleasing return to form \u2013 funny, thrilling and a little touching. <em>Mark Jones</em></p> <p></p> <h2>Thursday</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398816731\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/11/2/1351871185062/Great-Continental-Railway-010.jpg\" alt=\"Great Continental Railway Journeys\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Michael Portillo presents Great Continental Railway Journeys.

The choice of year is, of course, not accidental, as the politician-turned-journo (whose fondness for pale blues and pinks at times calls to mind a walking Liquorice Allsort) hunts for evidence of a world about to be swept away by the first world war. Portillo begins with a journey through France in search of La Belle \u00c9poque, a trip that takes in Montmartre, absinthe, and the Monte Carlo casino. <em>JW</em></p> <h2>Hatfields &amp; McCoys<br>9pm, Channel 5</h2> <p>The fightin' and a-feudin' moves up a notch or two tonight as the town is visited by bounty hunters looking to spill Hatfield blood. But strangers are no match for the local family who know the region too well, so the only blood these gunmen end up spilling is their own. It becomes clear to the McCoys that they're going to have to find help closer to home in the shape of the well-named Bad Frank \u2013 who has thus far been observing and even laughing at all the carnage. There's also a Hatfield/McCoy wedding that fails to bring the families closer. Quite the opposite, in fact. <em>Phelim O'Neill</em></p> <h2>Hebburn<br>10pm, BBC2</h2> <p>Jack's off for an interview at the Barnsley Gazette and his sister Vicki, who gets all the best lines, has a new car so she can give him a lift. \"I feel like when Cheryl drove that tank in Afghanistan,\" she muses, stroking her new steering wheel. Her enthusiasm soon subsides when she and Granny Dot get lost and risk missing their appointment at the Wax Hatch. Back at home, Joe (with Vic Reeves in his surprisingly normal dad role) lends Sarah his special fork to clean the hairs out of the plughole. Later, Jack and Sarah break some big news. <em>HV</em></p> <h2>How Tech Works<br>7pm, Discovery Science</h2> <p>Science as imagined by the lads' mag reader, How Tech Works is a Clarksonesque mixture of the fatuous and fairly interesting. In the former camp this week, a German man who has become a YouTube sensation via his innovative slingshot designs (he fires iPhones! And machetes!). Then a piece about Cotswold Airport, where Jumbo jets go to die. Or rather, be salvaged: a moribund Boeing 747 is worth $10m, but individually, the windows, the engines, even the seats ($10,000 each) are worth so much, the stripped plane can net $20m in spare parts. Interesting for the entrepreneur, terrifying for the nervous flier. <em>JR</em></p> <h2>The Year the Town Hall Shrank<br>9pm, BBC4</h2> <p>The series focused on spending cuts in Stoke-on-Trent continues with the run-up to the May 2011 local elections. It's a campaign we see, in great part, from the perspective of the British National party, which had previously made inroads in the area. Contrasting with the idiocy of far-right politics, cameras also follow something important: the closure of an old people's home. Staff worry that moving elderly residents will lead to premature deaths but can't do much except offer care and compassion: \"It's lovely where you're going \u2026 D'ya need a cuddle?\" <em>JW</em></p> <h2>Red Dwarf<br>9pm, Dave</h2> <p>Time to bid a fond farewell to the Red Dwarf crew again as their well-received comeback concludes. It doesn't quite end with a bang but it does have several big explosions as the boredom of deep space gets the gang into trouble with the deadly Simulants. It's up to Rimmer to save the day. A holographic message from his overbearing father gives him newfound inner strength in a very unexpected way as the shameful truth about his lineage is finally revealed. <em>PO'N </em></p> <p></p> <h2>Friday</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398816732\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/11/2/1351871329771/Attenboroughs-Ark---A-Nat-010.jpg\" alt=\"Attenborough's Ark - A Natural World Special\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Attenborough's Ark - A Natural World Special (BBC2).

The costs are monstrous: 90 million Indonesians smoke, and 200,000 of them die of tobacco-related illnesses every year. The case studies here are even more grim, from a six-year-old who has been smoking for four years to the children who are barely paid to pick the stuff. If you were already baffled as to how tobacco execs sleep nights, this will do little to ameliorate your puzzlement. <em>AM</em></p> <h2>Wild Things with Dominic Monaghan<br>8pm, Channel 5</h2> <p>Ex-Hobbit and apparent wildlife nut Dominic Monaghan presents Wild Things, an indulgence of a programme, the first episode of which takes him to the jungles outside the Venezuelan capital of Caracas to hunt a venomous centipede called the scolopendra. However venomous it might be, and it is pretty venomous, it's an underwhelming creature to kick things off with. The search for the insect is paired with sub-Palin travel footage punctuated by Monaghan's annoying mid-Atlantic accent. <em>BA</em></p> <h2>Attenborough's Ark: Natural World Special<br>9pm, BBC2</h2> <p>We wouldn't want many more species to go the way of the Dodo. So how about appointing David Attenborough as our television Noah, and asking which 10 species on Earth he would insure against future extinction? Cue a return to the warm, knowledgeable presenting that his safari-suited younger self specialized in in the 1970s. What follows is cute interaction, and an examination of the painstaking conservation projects that will help creatures such as the Sumatran rhino to survive. <em>JR</em></p> <h2>Full Metal Jousting<br>9pm, History</h2> <p>It's the $100k final of the show where beefy men with a preference for pony tails and dodgy facial hair bash the hell out of each other with poles. With testosterone oozing through the screen, there's plenty of trash talk from the contenders \u2013 knightly chivalry is thin on the ground here. Each jousting pass only lasts five seconds, so there's a lot of filler and more replay angles than the Premier League, while the riders often miss each other completely. But in downturn America, it's probably not a bad way for a tough guy to earn a living. <em>MS</em></p> <h2>Vegas Police<br>9pm, Really</h2> <p>In a twist on the age-old adage, what happens in Vegas is broadcast on UKTV. You'd think that in a city as sinful as Sin City there would be some eye-popping criminal action, but if Vegas Police is to be in any way believed, the level of misdemeanour is on a par with Norwich city centre on a Tuesday evening. One man is arrested for doing jazzercise while seemingly high, while another is busted for buying baking powder on the strip. Then two chump-witted fratboys get shaken down for being drunk. For a city this glitzy, the crime is dull as dishwater. <em>BA</em></p> <h2>Songs of Sandy Denny at the Barbican<br>10.05pm, BBC4</h2> <p>Back in 2010, the Barbican hosted a tribute to Nick Drake. One of the performers, Green Gartside, is back there again tonight for this concert showcasing the music of another fallen folk legend, Sandy Denny, that most powerful of singers (and songwriters). Gartside tackles Denny's North Star Grassman And The Ravens and is joined by luminaries such as Maddy Prior, PP Arnold and Dave Swarbrick (as Thea Gilmore says by way of introduction, \"There are fiddle players \u2013 and then there's this guy\"). Really lovely. <em>AJC</em></p>",
  "<p>It is very rare for anyone in Mexico to be arrested for murdering a journalist, let alone appear before a court.

  "<h2>WINNING TIP: Llanthony Priory, nr Abergavenny</h2> <p>My perfect autumn walk begins at the romantic ruins of this priory, pictured, in the Ewyas Valley. From here it's a steep climb up the wooded hillside until you get views, shared with sheep and wild ponies, of the Black Mountains. You finally reach Offa's Dyke where the neat rolling landscape of Herefordshire is revealed. The icing on the cake is back in the valley at a tiny pub hidden in the vaults of the priory (<a href=\"http://www.llanthonyprioryhotel.co.uk/firstpage.html\" title=\"\">llanthonypriory hotel.co.uk</a>), where you can warm up. Bliss.<br><strong>bertie03</strong></p> <p><strong>Seven Sisters, Eastbourne, East Sussex</strong><br>A spectacular walk along chalky roller coaster cliffs. I like to start as early as possible with a reviving coffee in one of the cafes of genteel Eastbourne before tackling the first (of many) steep inclines of the day up to Beachy Head. The cliff edge is bleak and there are no fences protecting the vertiginous drop, and in the early autumnal mist it's a great place to contemplate the meaning of life and wonder of nature. After that, it's up and down, up and down along the grassy cliffs to Birling Gap with its stunning beach and Cuckmere Haven, where the river meanders down to the sea.

It was a fun end to a hilly walk, which had started at Ilam Hall across Lindale to the Dove, sunlight bouncing off the pyramid-shaped Thorpe Cloud hill. A circular route back led us over fields, past the Izaak Walton Hotel (<a href=\"http://www.izaakwaltonhotel.com/\" title=\"\">izaakwaltonhotel.com</a>), named for the author of The Compleat Angler, back to Ilam Hall (<a href=\"http://peakdistrict.nationaltrust.org.uk/ilam-hall\" title=\"\">peakdistrict.nationaltrust.org.uk/ilam-hall</a>).<br><strong>cathos</strong></p> <p><strong>Walking over Wansfell Pike to Troutbeck, Ambleside, Cumbria</strong><br>This is a walk with a bit of everything: woodland, waterfalls, open fells fantastic views.

To return directly to Ambleside turn right \u2013 but if you want refreshment turn left and walk along the road to The Mortal Man (<a href=\"http://www.themortalman.co.uk/\" title=\"\">themortalman.co.uk</a>).

The return walk from Wythburn car park is perfectly suitable for families and can be accomplished in less than four hours.

The east side is my favourite with many snack bars and coffee hubs where you can sit and watch the Hackney posse rock about. Better yet are the charming houseboats that are docked up, especially towards trendy Broadway Market, which have taken to selling goods and sometimes even put on live music. The best place to start is the opening near Angel tube, and head east all the way to Victoria Park.<br><strong>aleshaoner17</strong></p> <p><strong>Lea Valley walk from Limehouse to Ponders End, London</strong><br>This is a lovely stroll at any time of the year, but in autumn the combination of trees, leaves and water is particularly lovely. For an 11ish-mile walk, I recommend heading north from Limehouse to finish up at Ponders End, where you can catch the train back to Liverpool Street station. For a shorter stretch start or stop at Markfield Park, about half a mile from Seven Sisters and Tottenham Hale tube/train stations.

  "<h2>Israel and the Palestinians</h2> <p>Two weeks ago, Randi Mellman Oze, 54, printed off her absentee ballot paper, marked a cross next to Mitt Romney's name, sealed the envelope and took it to the post office to send it back to the US.</p> <p>A lifelong Democrat voter until she came to live in Israel five years ago, changing her political stance had been \"a very big deal\" to her.</p> <p>\"I was always a Democrat, and my family are all Democrats. But I don't feel Obama has Israel's best interests at heart,\" she said. \"Instead of concentrating on sanctions against Iran in the first two years of his presidency, he made nice to them and he put pressure on Israel. If he hadn't followed this policy, we would not now be on the brink of war with Iran.\"</p> <p>She is among up to 250,000 American-Israelis entitled to vote in Tuesday's US presidential election, the majority of whom are believed to be backing the Republican candidate.</p> <p>Polls of all Israelis, not just immigrants from the US, have shown a majority in favour of ousting Obama and installing Romney in the White House.</p> <p>The Israeli prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, is widely perceived to be rooting for a Romney victory, against all protocol. Many commentators have accused him of interfering in internal US politics in his eagerness to see an ideological soulmate in the White House.</p> <p>Relations between Obama and Netanyahu have been severely strained by the Israeli leader's insistence on a tougher US stance on the Iranian nuclear programme, which the US has resisted. Romney is seen as more hawkish on this issue. But he is also even less inclined to push Israel towards allowing the Palestinians an independent state \u2013 another factor endearing him to Netanyahu.</p> <p>The opposition leader, Shaul Mofaz, publicly accused the prime minister of trying to influence the outcome of the election. \"Israeli meddling in internal US affairs and turning the US administration from an ally to an enemy has caused us severe damage,\" he told the Israeli parliament.</p> <p>Some commentators have warned that a re-elected Obama could seek a payback for what is regarded as Netanyahu's transparent support for his opponent. Netanyahu rejected accusations of interference, saying they were \"completely groundless\".</p> <p>Israel has figured strongly in the candidates' own campaigns. According to Eytan Gilboa, a specialist in US-Israel elections at Bar-Ilan University, \"never in the history of US presidential elections has Israel occupied such a prominent place\".</p> <p>This, he said, had been largely driven by Republicans, who \"thought if they can move a few percent [of Jewish voters] into their camp it could have a positive result in a very close election\".</p> <p>He added: \"Some in Israel are happy that the candidates are competing over who is the biggest supporter of Israel. But this is a negative development. It would be much better for Israel to enjoy bi-partisan high level support.\"</p> <p>Palestinians are watching the election campaign with cynicism. Many feel badly let down by Obama's failure to force progress towards a Palestinian state, but they also know that Romney is unlikely to be a friend to their cause.</p> <p>\"Obama is not a saviour, and Romney will not be a devil,\" said Hanan Ashrawi, a member of the Palestinian Liberation Organisation executive committee. \"Neither one is a free agent; there is a US policy of bias and support for Israel.\" said Hanan Ashrawi, a member of the Palestinian Liberation Organisation executive committee.</p> <p>Those who expected a re-elected Obama to \"suddenly develop a backbone and stand up to pressure\" were likely to be disappointed, she said. <br><strong>Harriet Sherwood, Jerusalem</strong></p> <h2>Africa</h2> <p>Obama's election provoked euphoria in his ancestral village in Kenya, as well as among African governments who scented a chance to move up the US's list of priorities.</p> <p>Four years later, there is largely a sense of deflation and, judging by column inches in the press, somewhat less enthusiasm for this year's presidential race. Sub-Saharan Africa has barely been mentioned in the campaign and the feeling of apathy is mostly mutual.</p> <p>Yet residual loyalty to Obama remains deep and, if Africa's billion citizens got to vote, it seems likely he would win by a landslide.</p> <p>\"Four years ago there was so much hope in this country,\" said Boniface Mwangi, a photographer and political activist whose office in Nairobi, Kenya, is decorated with Obama's image in life-size cardboard replica. \"Now we're no longer that hopeful and asking where did we go wrong. I thought Barack Obama would do well for Africa but I'm ashamed to say that George Bush did more. Obama has done nothing for us. People are very mad, especially in Kogelo, his family village: they're still expecting some kind of handout from [him]. I hope his second term plans will include Africa; otherwise he's a hoax.\"</p> <p>Kenya is preoccupied with its own elections. Yet despite everything, Mwangi, who took out a bank loan to be in America for Obama's historic 2008 win, hopes that he will repeat the feat. \"He's more progressive than Romney in every way. Romney will be bad for America and the world. He's shallow and slimy, like a car salesman selling junk.\"</p> <p>Obama, who once hailed the \"blood of Africa within me\", has spent only 20 hours on sub-Saharan African soil since becoming president (it was a stopover in Ghana in between summits elsewhere).</p> <p>By contrast, the president of China, Hu Jintao, has made seven trips to Africa, five as head of state, and visited at least 17 countries, according to the Brookings Institution.</p> <p>But the Democrat remains way ahead of Romney in terms of brand recognition. Shehu Sani, an author and human rights activist in Nigeria, said: \"Not many people in Africa know who Romney is and what he stands for and what he is capable of doing.</p> <p>\"Almost everyone knows who Obama is for the very fact that he is partly an African and there is still hope he will do something for Africa as far as peace, stability and economic development is concerned. There is a saying, 'better the devil you know'. If we haven't seen the actions, we have seen the intentions, so we give him the benefit of the doubt. We hope the second term will be better.\"</p> <p>Commentators note that Obama's principal African focus has been security, for example in combating Islamist militancy in Somalia, with pragmatism based on American self interest.</p> <p>Ousseynou Bissichi, a guide at the African Renaissance Monument, in Dakar, Senegal, who points out to tourists that his workplace is taller than the Statue of Liberty, said: \"A lot of people in Africa thought Obama would be the president of Africa. Go to any centre in Africa four years ago and people were celebrating.</p> <p>\"Later we realised he's an American president, not an African president. Even George Bush did more for Africa and he's a white man. Bill Clinton did, too.\"</p> <p>Yet Bissichi also remains loyal to Obama. \"In Africa, we like the Democrats more than the Republicans. We think they have more humanity than the Republicans. Mitt Romney is a very rich guy. Even in America, people think he knows nothing about poverty and misery.\"</p> <p>Some admit that Africa's hopes for the president were impossibly high. Asked if he had lived up to expectations, Michael Amankwa, an entrepreneur in Accra, Ghana, said: \"I think he has to a large extent, even though some might have been a bit disappointed. He came in with too much star power, which raised the bar very high for him. Some also understand that he inherited a bad situation with the economy and so on.\"</p> <p>South Africa, the continent's \"superpower\", has hosted the US's first lady, Michelle Obama, but still awaits the photo opportunity of America's first black president meeting Nelson Mandela.</p> <p>Karabo Kgoleng, a radio presenter in Johannesburg, said: \"I think it is disingenuous for Africans to expect anything from any American president. He is not African. He is American and his most important priority is the American people not the Africans.</p> <p>\"I think Africans rejoicing at his making it to office came from the need for a psychological boost as well as an indication of Africans buying into the American dream \u2013 that one's roots can be African and one can succeed in life, with those roots. Africans need to hold their own leaders to account before pinning their hopes on anyone else. Obama owes Africa nothing.\" <br><strong>David Smith, Africa correspondent</strong></p> <h2>Europe</h2> <p>The Obama-mania that swept Europe four years ago has faded fast amid transatlantic rows over the euro crisis, the administration's failure to deliver on its promise to close down Guant\u00e1namo Bay, and the waning attention paid to Europe by the US.</p> <p>But despite the fact that the centre-right remains in the ascendancy across most of Europe, disaffection with Barack Obama is not translating into support for Mitt Romney.</p> <p>Quite the opposite. There is strikingly little support for the Republican contender whose gaffe-prone visit to Europe in July won him few friends and who regularly turns European welfarism and \"entitlement societies\" into points of mockery in his campaign speeches.</p> <p>According to the New York Times, European diplomats in Washington have been discreetly lodging complaints with the Romney camp about the candidate's criticism.</p> <p>An opinion poll last month showed widespread dislike of Romney, and residual, if no longer starry-eyed, support for Obama among Europeans.</p> <p>Just 5% of those polled in France, Germany, and Britain had a good opinion of Romney. Only 4% of Germans polled said a President Romney would make them better-disposed towards the US, while 12 times that figure took the opposite view. Two in five French people said a Romney victory would turn them more against the US, while only 5% said they would be happier with him in the White House.</p> <p>By contrast 87% of Germans said they would vote for Obama, while in France 67% described him as their president of choice.</p> <p>The ongoing German love affair with Obama started in July 2008 when the would-be president was famously denied the chance to speak at Berlin's Brandenburg gate by the chancellor, Angela Merkel, and opted instead for the roundabout at the Victory column where thousands gathered to hear him speak, cementing his celebrity status in Berlin at least.</p> <p>Exploring why Obama's popularity had endured despite certain disappointments, Friedrich Mielke, said the president was viewed by Germans as a \"dove of peace\".</p> <p>The publicist and American expert said: \"We love him because we can project our own hopes and desires on to him,\" he said. Most people here see him as a leader of the free world, who combines intelligence and strength of character with charm and rhetorical lustre.\"</p> <p>Romney, by contrast, was viewed as a \"locust capitalist\", he said, who \"spreads social frigidity and egoism\".</p> <p>It appears that Europeans see Romney as a return to the days of George W Bush who was hugely unpopular on this side of the Atlantic.</p> <p>Romney has hardly sought to endear himself with Europeans, holding the EU up as a failed model and implicitly accusing Obama of being a closet \"European\" \u2013 big government, social welfare, and \"entitlement\" culture. <br><strong>Ian Traynor, Europe editor, and Kate Connolly in Berlin</strong></p> <h2>China</h2> <p>China's elite would normally be watching the election more closely. But with its own once-a-decade leadership transition beginning days after the US votes, it has other matters on its mind.</p> <p>For many in China, the election is of relatively limited interest. Some will follow results avidly, but others are only concerned about the impact on China.</p> <p>\"I like Obama's style. He is a very charming guy \u2026 Romney seems quite aggressive,\" said Beijing-based marketing researcher Ming Ming, adding: \"I'm more concerned about who will have better policy towards China.\"</p> <p>Zheng Jihua, an entrepreneur, said: \"I don't think it makes much difference whether it's Obama or Romney.\"</p> <p>Despite the tough-talking on tackling China during debates, he said: \"The economic connections [between the countries] matters more than political things. If they become president they will be more realistic.\"</p> <p>China is used to playing its part in US presidential races. \"It's an old story, China becoming a political card to play in US elections. This year, Romney and Obama seem to be playing it more heavily,\" an editorial in the populist state-run Global Times said last month.</p> <p>But Shi Yinhong, an expert on Sino-US relations at Renmin University, said most people were more concerned by issues such as tensions with Japan over disputed islands.</p> <p>\"For those who are paying attention, I guess they may feel both sides are not so nice towards China,\" he said. \"I think maybe in government and the foreign policy elites they feel the lesser evil is still Barack Obama because they're familiar with him.</p> <p>\"If you look at the campaign statements, Romney has been much more combative in terms of US economic rivalry.\"</p> <p>Shen Dingli, director of the Centre for American Studies at Fudan University, disagreed. He argued that while China did not officially have a preference - due to the country's doctrine of non-interference in other nations' domestic affairs - in reality it leant to Republicans.</p> <p>\"The Republicans are pro-development, pro-foreign trade, pro-efficiency, pro-capitalism,\" he said, and were unlikely to push hard for cuts to China's carbon emissions, while Democrats \"are pro-American poor people and want to protect jobs\".</p> <p>Shen added: \"People claim if Romney is in power, the next day he will tackle China for manipulating the currency. It's a joke. Romney will be China's best friend because he will not honour his threats.\"</p> <p>Experts say tough talk from US candidates is rarely matched by their action once in office. Even so, Shi warned that in general \"Sino-American rivalries have become more profound and sometimes more tense.\"<br><strong> Tania Branigan, Beijing</strong></p> <h2>Iran</h2> <p>\"Which one is better for Iran, Obama or Romney?\" asked Ebrahim Asgharzadeh, a political activist and leader behind the US embassy hostage-taking after the 1979 Islamic revolution.</p> <p>\"The answer is not very difficult,\" he said, during the television debate. He was insinuating that Iran should be worried about the prospect of Romney winning.</p> <p>Asgharzadeh, who is now sympathetic to reformists, suggested Iran should play a role in helping Obama stay in office. \"We influenced American elections back at the time of Reagan [with negotiations over hostage crisis] and we can do it now. Iran can influence with a surprise.\"</p> <p>Iranians are closely following the election. There is concern that a Romney victory will significantly increase the possibility of an Israeli military strike against the regime's nuclear facilities, and weaken the prospect of a possible breakthrough in negotiations between Tehran and the west. The Obama administration, by contrast, is keen to give sanctions more time to bite.</p> <p>\"The US election results can potentially change the fate of my country,\" said an Iranian journalist based in Tehran. \"Many activists and those with access to internet or [illegal] satellite dishes are watching it closely.\"</p> <p>Iranian state agencies are reporting the developments of Obama-Romney campaigns but with little commentary. Iranian officials, however, say that the outcome is immaterial to Iran.</p> <p>Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, Iran's president, while speaking among to reporters in New York during a visit to the UN general assembly last month, refused to show support to either candidate.</p> <p>Ali Larijani, Iran's speaker in parliament, said a Romney win would not be a threat. In his view, the governor's support for Israel's possible attack amounted to little more than campaign rhetoric. <br><strong>Saeed Kamali Dehghan</strong></p> <h2>Russia</h2> <p>With anti-Americanism creeping back to the forefront of political rhetoric in Moscow, many in Russia slyly smiled when Romney this year called Russia \"our No 1 geopolitical foe\".</p> <p>Vladimir Putin, Russia's president, said the remark showed Romney was \"open and sincere\". He added: \"That Romney considers us enemy No 1 and apparently has bad feelings about Russia is a minus, but, considering that he expresses himself bluntly, openly and clearly, [this] means he is an open and sincere man, which is a plus</p> <p>\"We will be oriented toward pluses, not minuses. And I am actually very grateful to him for formulating his position in a straightforward manner.\"</p> <p>The statement harked back to Soviet times, when Russia's leaders preferred dealing with Republicans \u2013 who were seen as straight-talking, if tough \u2013 to Democrats, seen here as masking their anti-Russian stance behind talk of human and civil rights, viewed with suspicion inside Russia.</p> <p>Maria Lipman, an expert at the Moscow Carnegie Centre, said: \"Particularly after the expulsion of the USAid, Washington's international aid agency, the Kremlin is now too committed to a path of using its old cold war foe as a bogeyman to consolidate wavering domestic support. Anti-American rhetoric in Russia has gone too far to shift easily now.\"</p> <p>Nor has there been much effort from the US presidential candidates to address policy towards Russia except for cheap point scoring, she added, and the next occupant of the White House was unlikely to seek to introduce any significant changes.</p> <p>Romney even appears in private to be backpedalling on his \"number one geopolitical foe\" comment. He used his son, Matt Romney, to pass a placatory message to Putin last month during a business trip to Moscow, according to a recent report in the New York Times.</p> <p>Many Russians have little interest in the race going on in the US, remaining sceptical that it can influence their lives.</p> <p>In a suburban train heading into Moscow on Friday evening, there was widespread indifference. \"Honestly, I don't care,\" said Sergei Chernenko, a 23-year old barman, adding that the election's outcome was irrelevant.</p> <p>Irina Kaidina, an accountant, concurred. Her son lived in New York, she said, but she couldn't remember the name of Barack Obama's challenger.</p> <p>Assistant engineer Nikolai Kuprianov, 32, however, said he had been following the presidential campaign. \"Obama would, of course, be a better choice in terms of attitudes towards Russia but Americans have never loved Russia and they only want us for our natural resources,\" he said.</p> <p>Obama had made the \"reset\" in relations with Russia an early foreign policy priority, but with recent disagreements over Syria, plus Moscow's accusation that the US stands behind opposition protests against Putin, what was once hailed as a success is now seen as dead.</p> <p>Russia's foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, said as much in an interview published this week: \"If we talk about the 'reset', it is clear that, using computer terminology, it cannot last forever. Otherwise it would not be a 'reset' but a program failure\".</p> <p>Among Russia's chief concerns are energy policy \u2013 Putin's ability to govern rests on a high oil price, analysts say \u2013 and US plans for missile defence in Europe, which it opposes but both candidates support. <br><strong>Miriam Elder and Howard Amos</strong></p> <h2>Pakistan</h2> <p>The US elections have serious implications for Pakistan and policy making, but that is not reflected in popular debate or discussion.</p> <p>While government officials complain that there is little chance of key issues, such as efforts to draw the Taliban into a political process, being dealt with before the the election, public interest in the contest is virtually nil.</p> <p>Perhaps that is not surprising with anti-Americanism appearing to be at an all-time high in Pakistan.</p> <p>There has been little media interest in the campaign, with some of the most recent reports about the US president concerning the burning of effigies of him to protest against a blasphemous anti-Islam film posted on YouTube.</p> <p>There is certainly none of the enthusiasm Obama mustered in the Muslim world in 2008, said Munawar Hasan, president of the conservative Islamic party Jamaat-e-Islami.</p> <p>\"After the last four years people now know that Americans are Americans and George Bush and Barack Obama are two sides of the same coin,\" he said, damning US policy on the region, including the sharp increase in drone strikes and the troop surge in Afghanistan. No one is interested in this election because, whoever wins, US foreign policy is not going to change.\"</p> <p>Some suspect the country's military establishment may harbour a stronger desire to see the back of Obama as his administration, in sharp contrast to that of George Bush (and Republican governments in general), was not afraid of playing rough with Pakistan, even at the expense of humiliating its armed forces.</p> <p>The May 2011 raid to kill Osama bin Laden within Pakistani territory still haunts the army and the country has struggled to cope with the massive increase in US drone attacks on its tribal areas.</p> <p>Even worse was the accidental US airstrike on the Afghan border last year which killed 24 troops and prompted months of acrimony between Islamabad and Washington. <br><strong>Jon Boone, Islamabad</strong></p> <h2>Latin America</h2> <p>The US election has been watched with no little self-interest in Latin America, where many politicians and commentators partly define themselves by their admiration or rejection of US values.</p> <p>While most national leaders have remained diplomatically quiet about their preferences, the Venezuelan president, Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, who recently won re-election, has bucked the trend by stating his preference for Obama.</p> <p>\"I hope this doesn't harm Obama, but if I was from the US, I'd vote for Obama,\" Chavez said on state TV and indicated that he felt the admiration was mutual. \"Obama is a good guy \u2026 I think that if Obama was from Barlovento or some Caracas neighborhood, he'd vote for Chavez.\"</p> <p>The US president is likely to pick up more Hispanic votes from the endorsement of the Mexican band Man\u00e1, who played a set at an Obama rally in Las Vegas this month. \"We have the conviction that Obama is the best candidate for all Latinos,\" said Man\u00e1 frontman Fher Olvera. \"Vote for the president who has cared most for Latinos and minorities.\"</p> <p>In Brazil, which is in the midst of a municipal election campaign, the president, Dilma Rousseff, does not appear to see any political advantage in allying herself to either US candidate, partly because of differences in foreign policy.</p> <p>Regarding Obama's speech on the handling of the crisis in Syria at the UN late last month, Rousseff said: \"He has his position, I have mine.\"</p> <p>Brazilian media commentators have been underwhelmed by the performance of the two US candidates.</p> <p>\"The speech in which US president Barack Obama, formally accepted the nomination of the Democratic Party to run for a new mandate caused an anticlimax, even for his most excited voters,\" noted Folha de S. Paulo in one of the few Brazilian editorials on the US election. <br><strong>Jonathan Watts, Rio de Janeiro</strong></p> <h2>Arab world</h2> <p>Arabs watching the US presidential race are mainly interested in how the next administration will deal with the Arab spring \u2013 as well as the perennial question of the unresolved Palestinian issue.</p> <p>Barack Obama has, in significant ways, failed to live up to the expectations he created in his long-awaited Cairo speech in June 2009. Many in the region say they see little difference between him and Romney, but Obama is probably still the preferred candidate.</p> <p>Obama was criticised initially for reacting slowly to the revolution in Egypt but has been measured since the Muslim Brotherhood's Mohamed Mursi became president and hopes to encourage a shift toward pragmatism and moderation.</p> <p>Following the murder of the US ambassador to Libya, Washington also signalled continued support for the new government in Tripoli.</p> <p>Syrian and Arab opponents of Bashar al-Assad hope that in a second term Obama would be more openly supportive than he has been so far.</p> <p>Romney's policies reflect a more conservative world view that appeals to Saudis and their Gulf allies, who believe Obama has been too soft on Iran. Saudis hope that a Romney administration, with a neoconservative element, might be more aggressive on Syria. The Republican has expressed \"disappointment\" at the rise of Islamists. </p> <p>He is also likely to give greater weight to Israel's regional views, for example as they pertain to policy towards Egypt. Both candidates would likely remain muted in response to the ongoing protests and crackdown in Bahrain, a key US ally in the Gulf. </p> <p>The novelty for the next president will be that public opinion is now a more significant factor in the Arab world than it was when Obama entered the White House. It did not inspire confidence when Romney referred to the shooting at a Sikh temple in Wisconsin as taking place at a \"sheikh\" temple. <br><strong>Ian Black, Middle East editor</strong></p> <h2>Afghanistan</h2> <p>For a place where US troops are still dying in their hundreds and for which billions of dollars are spent each year, Afghanistan has garnered very little attention over the election.</p> <p>With a strange kind of symmetry Afghanistan might be dependent on US cash to keep its government afloat, and the US military to keep the Taliban at bay, but there is very little focus on the presidential race on the streets or in the TV studios of Kabul.</p> <p>This lack of interest is in large part because most people in Kabul feel the broad outlines of US policy have already been set. The timeline for the departure of US and other foreign forces will not alter, regardless of who wins.</p> <p>\"The Afghan people are not paying a lot of attention to the US election, because as we heard during the campaign, both candidates are agreed about taking their troops home from Afghanistan,\" said Najibullah Hosseini, a 32-year-old 32, a professor at a private university.</p> <p>Newspapers and television channels are running stories about the election, but there is little debate on popular chat shows or in the opinion pages.</p> <p>In one report, the popular newspaper 8am underlined that the US had already made a long-term commitment to supporting Afghanistan.</p> <p>\"Both candidates said there should be no worries about US and international aid to the country,\" the report said, before adding that it was in Washington's interest to ensure the country did not become a haven for terrorists, regardless of who was in the White House.</p> <p>Diplomats are similarly sanguine about the election results. The winner will have to decide exactly how fast they want to bring the rest of US forces home, but neither Romney nor Obama is likely to deviate from a 2014 deadline agreed with Nato allies and the Afghan government.</p> <p>\"A review of policy will take place any way, irrespective of who wins, and the overall mood in the US is very much focused on the honourable exit,\" said one senior diplomat in Kabul. \"If Romney wins, there may be more of a deep dive. He may be more critical in assessing what is under the surface of the positive narrative \u2026 but overall I don't think the election result will have a major impact here.\"</p> <p>Some Afghans, however, are still hopeful the election will bring change, with aspirations not far different from those of US voters weary with the steady flow of young men and women returning home in coffins, and the steep cost of a war amid a struggling economy.</p> <p>\"I want to ask the US voters to select a man who will talk with the Taliban to end the war. We don't want any more people to be killed, we want the economy to be fixed,\" said 50-year-old Shah Agha Nazari, head of a local council in Kabul's Neka Khana area. <br><strong>Emma Graham-Harrison and Mokhtar Amiri</strong></p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 6 November 2012.

  "<p>One of BP's longest-running energy concessions is threatening to become a high-profile victim of tensions between the United Arab Emirates and Britain over criticism of the Middle East state's crackdown on Islamist extremist groups.</p> <p>BP was first given a stake in a vast onshore oil field in Abu Dhabi back in 1939, but the concession comes up for renewal in 2014 and BP has been excluded from the bidding list.</p> <p>The UAE is one of the top five oil exporters in the world and Abu Dhabi is the headquarters for BP's entire exploration and production operation across the Middle East \u2013 the birth place a century ago of the business as the Anglo-Persian Oil Company.</p> <p>BP said \"discussions are still continuing\" with the UAE authorities but its exclusion from the bid is a major blow. The company is already in the middle of a row with Azerbaijan over falling output there, and has been hit by a series of serious problems in recent years, most notably the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico.</p> <p>The oil major is privately said to be still hopeful the British government can sweet-talk the UAE into changing its mind at a time when its chief rivals, Royal Dutch Shell, ExxonMobil and others have been accepted as prequalified to bid.</p> <p>UAE officials have also accepted privately that BP's failure to make the list of bidders is a problem associated with the UK government rather than the company. Oil analysts in London, who preferred not to be named, said it was generally accepted that BP was the victim of a wider political row.</p> <p>The UAE has indicated that it is still to make a final decision on the issue, giving it leverage to encourage the UK government to dissuade political commentators in Britain from giving what it perceives as support to Islamist groups such as al-Islah.</p> <p>According to Human Rights Watch, the group \u2013 whose name translates as Reform and Social Guidance \u2013 is a \"non-violent political assocation advocating greater adherence to Islamic precepts\".</p> <p>BP holds a 9.5% holding in the 1.4m barrels-a-day concession alongside four western oil majors and the local state-owned group Abu Dhabi National Oil Company.</p> <p>The loss of its interests would deprive the company of 125,000 barrels a day, which is around 3.5% of its total global production.</p> <p>This is a significant amount given that BP is struggling to keep its volumes from falling, especially at a time when it is in the middle of selling its 50% stake in TNK-BP, its highly productive Russian operation.</p> <p>The financial loss from Abu Dhabi, however, would be less pronounced as the company is only paid around $1 for each barrel produced under the terms of the concession, which is structured as a \"contractor fee\".</p> <p>Abu Dhabi is one of the few Gulf states that allow western companies to explore for oil, and BP's exit would be a blow to the company's image as a blue-chip operator in demand all over the world. BP does not have any business in other major Middle East producers such as Saudi Arabia, but it does have oil interests in Iraq. It also has gas production in Oman and is developing gas fields in Sharjah.</p>"
