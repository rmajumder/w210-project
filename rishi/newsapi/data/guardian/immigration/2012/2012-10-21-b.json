  "<p>Nearly one million overseas visitors to the UK watched a professional football match during their stay last year, according to new figures.</p> <p>Big promotions by the national tourist agency <a href=\"http://www.visitbritain.com/en/GB/\" title=\"\">VisitBritain</a> involving the <a href=\"http://www.premierleague.com/en-gb.html\" title=\"\">English Premier League</a> helped keep visitor numbers up during the depths of winter. The greatest proportion of inbound tourists going to see a top team play visited during January to March, even if actual numbers were higher later in the year.</p> <p>Manchester United and Liverpool encouraged visitors out of London, with Old Trafford and Anfield accounting for nearly 20% of the total.</p> <p>Figures based on responses to questions in the <a href=\"http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/surveys/respondents/household/international-passenger-survey/index.html\" title=\"\">Office for National Statistics</a> (ONS) international passenger survey for 2011 suggest that 1.3 million visitors (about 4% of all foreign visitors) went to a live sports event, and 900,000 of those watched football.</p> <p>The sports fans spent an average of \u00a3850 on their UK stays, far more than the overall average of \u00a3570, largely because they stayed longer. Players such as the Brazilian midfielder Sandro at Tottenham Hotspur, the American goalkeeper Tim Howard at Everton and Fulham's Norwegian defender, Brede Hangeland, have all helped promote UK tourism.</p> <p>The largest number of football visitors were from the Irish Republic, totalling 174,000, or 7% of all visitors from across the Irish Sea. The 80,000 Norwegians who went to a match made up an estimated 12% of all trips to the UK from their country. Next came 61,000 US fans, 54,000 from Spain and 48,000 from Germany. Mexico, Sweden and Iceland also accounted for healthy totals.</p> <p>There were high numbers of spectators for golf from the US, for rugby from Ireland and for cricket from Australia. The next largest group of cricket-watchers came over from France, but many were probably Brits living abroad.</p> <p>This month the ONS suggested the Olympics and Paralympics may have caused a 5% dip in tourist numbers compared with August 2011, but those who did visit this summer spent 9% more than foreign visitors the previous year.</p>",
  "<p>The view from Sir Nicolas Bratza's vast, curving windows takes in the skyline of Strasbourg, the European parliament building and, far below, the river Ill flooding east to join the Rhine.</p> <p>Along the riverbank, at the judicial heart of the continent, there is a scattering of single-person tents \u2013 temporary homes for desperate petitioners to the European court of human rights (ECHR). A protest by Turks and Kurds parades outside the court's entrance to denounce Turkey for promoting an alleged torturer to a senior security post in Istanbul, thereby flouting ECHR rulings.</p> <p>For more than 800 million people, the steel and glass building designed by the British architect Richard Rogers is the ultimate focus of their aspiration for justice. After 14 years as the UK's sole judge and a year as president of the court, Bratza is stepping down at the end of this month. His departure is tinged with disappointment.</p> <p>The ECHR's judicial powers extend across 47 member states, stretching from the Caspian Sea to the Straits of Gibraltar and as far north as Iceland. As a signatory to the original European convention of human rights, which was drafted to prevent the recurrence of another Holocaust and safeguard individuals from totalitarian misrule, the UK was a founder of the project.</p> <p>Stirred up by tabloid denunciations and Eurosceptic politicians, British popular sentiment has become increasingly critical of the court. The UK remains one of the most diligent enforcers of convention rights, but it appears to have soured into one of the least appreciative national constituencies.</p> <p>For some, disenchantment began with the 1995 judgment that the UK had violated the right to life of three IRA members shot dead by the SAS in Gibraltar. It has escalated over the standoff on prisoners' voting rights and rows over the protracted legal processes for extraditing terror suspects such as Abu Hamza and Abu Qatada.</p> <p>Bratza, 67, was a successful advocate and a crown court recorder before being elected in 1998 as the UK's judge on the ECHR. He is also a high court judge. He became president of the ECHR in 2011.</p> <p>\"The UK complies very well,\" he said. \"Where we find a violation, they correct it. I remain personally hopeful that some solution to this problem [of prisoners' voting rights] that will satisfy the UK parliament and the [ECHR] will be found.\"</p> <p>Italy is one of the worst serial offenders in violating the convention, because of the inordinately long periods it takes to complete trials.</p> <p>On the ECHR's backlog of 138,000 cases, he said: \"The problem is processing them. The court's registry is very hard-working. We have cases coming in from [more than] 40 legal systems. We have to have people from [each] legal system who understand the language.\"</p> <p>Of around 650 staff, 44 are from the UK. Case notes are colour-coded by the year they arrive. Lime green (2012), orange (2011) and yellow (2009) files were visible, piled up on desks and floors in offices along one corridor.</p> <p>Appealing to member states for extra funds to tackle the backlog has not generated much income. \"The UK has not contributed,\" Bratza said. \"The results have been disappointing. Certain newspapers said we were putting out a begging bowl. It's not that. It was to assist the court.\"</p> <p>This year the UK completed its six-month, rotating chairmanship of the Council of Europe, the body that oversees the ECHR. It culminated in the Brighton declaration, a reform programme that refined the concepts of \"subsidiarity\" and the \"margin of appreciation\" \u2013 the leeway given to nation states in their interpretation of convention rights.</p> <p>The ECHR, Bratza ssaid, should be subsidiary to national courts. \"In order for us to accept our subsidiary role, [member states] have to be the primary protectors of convention rights. The problem is that it's a two-sided coin. National states must carry out their functions.</p> <p>\"The UK has an admirable record on compliance and enforcement [of convention rights]. Provided states do their job, our job becomes much easier. We are a safety net.\"</p> <p>The reforms enshrined in the Brighton declaration were steered through by Ken Clarke before he was removed from his job as justice secretary in the recent reshuffle. Does Chris Grayling's appointment mark a sharp handbrake turn?</p> <p>\"I like the UK to play a whole-hearted role in matters European,\" Bratza said. \"I was pleased to hear [the attorney general] Dominic Grieve say in parliament this week that there was no question of leaving the ECHR. The UK leaving would be very damaging.\"</p> <p>The economic crisis may not help relations between London and Strasbourg, he said. \"Where there's a more general economic problem, it inevitably has an impact on protecting human rights. There's risk that human rights become [seen as] a sort of luxury, that we don't need to bother so much, [that] \u2026 we should be more resistant to immigration or other matters which might be a further burden on the economy. There's a risk always with an economic crisis that a society closes in on itself and becomes less open to the idea of human rights. Human rights are not a luxury, they should be fundamental.</p> <p>\"I met Mr Grayling at the chancellor's breakfast this year and urged him to come to Strasbourg to speak to the president of the court. Unfortunately it won't be within my time in office. I think an early discussion would be valuable to him and the court.\"</p> <p>Bratza's greatest frustration is with sections of the British press. \"Whatever we do, some adverse spin is put on news coming out of the court. It's very depressing to see. When I was first elected as president of the ECHR, I would have thought there might be some pleasure on the part of British newspapers. For too long it had been said that ECHR judges didn't know British law.</p> <p>\"But papers focused on the fact that my father was born in Serbia, giving the impression that he was a balalaika player from the streets of Belgrade.\" His father, Milan Bratza, was a distinguished concert violinist.</p> <p>\"They ignored the fact that he was naturalised in 1928 and that I was born and educated in the UK. On my mother's side, there are generations of law lords.</p> <p>\"We feel some of the language used to criticise the court is beyond the pale.\"</p> <p>Asked about his achievements, he listed the ECHR's successes. \"The court has had enormous achievements under every article of the convention: the importance of an effective investigation where there's been a killing, our opposition to the death penalty is a huge feather in the court's cap, protecting private sexual relations, the development of environmental rights, protection of private life from intrusion of the press, protection of press freedom, stopping journalists from being imprisoned for libel \u2026 It is a long list.\"</p> <p>Would he apply for one of the three vacancies for justices advertised this week by the UK's supreme court? \"I have been out of the UK as a judge for 14 years,\" he said. \"So the idea of going back where I would have a maximum of two and a half years [on the bench before retirement] to pick up the threads in the UK \u2026 would not really be advisable. I have made my judicial career here and that's probably where it will end. I have adored it. It's been a wonderful job.\"</p>",
  "<p>Mark Hughes insisted that it remains only a matter of time before QPR begin to pull away from the foot of the Premier League table but the pressure on the Rangers manager shows no sign of abating. The Hoops remain anchored to the bottom after Everton extended the west Londoners' winless start to the season to eight games. A J\u00falio C\u00e9sar own-goal cancelled out Junior Hoilett's early strike and, although the visitors were reduced to 10 men for the final half-hour, Rangers could not find a winner.</p> <p>For Hughes's side this was only a third point of the season but, with almost a quarter of the campaign gone he remains convinced it is just a blip. \"We know we can compete in this league and we've shown it against the top sides,\" he said. \"We're having a frustrating period but every club has one. We're having ours now and once we're through it that'll be the end of it.\"</p> <p>His opposite number concurred that time would prove a healer. \"They've got good players,\" said the Everton manager, David Moyes. \"After staying up they've brought in an awful lot of new players and they needed the turnaround to make sure they were all right. It just takes a bit of time.\"</p> <p>More importantly Hughes again received backing from his chairman, Tony Fernandes, who took to Twitter to tell those making negative comments after the game that they were \"wasting time and energy\" and that the club needs \"time and stability\".</p> <p>With Everton fourth, Hughes could point to the fact that his side have been handed an unenviable opening fixture list, with injuries, another mitigating factor, again forcing a defensive rejig. The frustration is compounded by the fact that they are not always playing badly. In the second half in particular they forced Everton back and the visitors were grateful for some fine goalkeeping from Tim Howard and equally adept defending from Phil Jagielka.</p> <p>In the main, though, it was a scrappy affair. Adel Taarabt, predictably, was in gloves but he might have been better off with a cagoule. The watery conditions had plenty of players struggling to stay vertical and at times it seemed as if this was a game being played on an ice rink for which only Esteban Granero, the most technically accomplished in midfield by a distance, had remembered to bring his skates.</p> <p>Nevertheless the afternoon could hardly have got off to a better start for Hughes and his team. Little over a minute was on the clock when Jos\u00e9 Bosingwa hooked a Leighton Baines corner narrowly wide of his own goal. From the resultant set-piece C\u00e9sar punched clear and Hoilett outmuscled Phil Neville to win the loose ball inside his own half. From there the Canada international raced forward with defenders backpedalling and, having seemingly held on to the ball for a second too long, watched as his shot clipped the heels of Baines and flew past the stranded Tim Howard. Only 118 seconds had elapsed.</p> <p>C\u00e9sar's only other important action in the opening half-hour was to push away Nikica Jelavic's curling low free-kick, while at the other end Ryan Nelsen might have doubled the advantage from close range. The QPR keeper, though, could do little about Everton's equaliser even if he will be credited with it. Steven Pienaar's free-kick was headed thunderously against the inside of a post by Sylvain Distin and the ball bobbled back over the line courtesy of a rebound off the Brazilian's back.</p> <p>That sparked 60 seconds of madness to match those in the opening exchanges. Jelavic tumbled in the box under St\u00e9phane Mbia's challenge to bring Moyes to the edge of his technical area screaming for a penalty. The referee, Jon Moss, turned those appeals down but, from the corner that followed the attack, Jagielka planted a header against the bar.</p> <p>The odds were tipped in the home side's favour on the hour when Pienaar was sent off after two yellow cards in the space of 10 minutes, the first after the South African hammered into Hoilett, the second issued, rather more dubiously, for a trip on Bosingwa. Certainly the contact was far less substantial than that of Seamus Coleman's boot on Hoilett in the Everton penalty area with 10 minutes to go.</p> <p>They were decisions to enrage both managers. \"It was very, very harsh to give someone a red card for that,\" said Moyes. \"Incredible.\" Hughes was equally unimpressed with the failure of Moss to award a potentially game-winning spot-kick. \"It was a stonewall penalty,\" he said. The referee is only four metres away \u2013 why he didn't given I don't know.\"</p> <p>Either side of the red card both Howard and C\u00e9sar had made fine stops, with the QPR keeper first denying Jagielka from point-blank range. His counterpart at the other end produced two excellent saves to keep out Hoilett efforts from the edge of the box and, at the death, Jagielka was on hand once more to deny Park Ji-sung.</p> <p><strong>Man of the match</strong> Phil Jagielka (Everton)</p>",
  "<p>There's an old saying in politics that being leader&#xa0;of the opposition is the worst job in the world. But there are times when it must seem&#xa0;a complete delight; and this is one. The coalition government staggers from one moment of low farce to the next, while on the streets those most hurt by austerity are loud and proud.</p> <p>Had Ed Miliband been allowed to write the narrative for David Cameron's last few weeks, he could hardly have come up with a more damaging series of events. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/oct/19/andrew-mitchell-resigns-police-pleb\" title=\"\">Andrew Mitchell</a> goes \u2013 albeit two days later than I'd predicted he would \u2013 but Cameron looks weak and dithery, pushed into accepting a resignation not by the press or the Police Federation, but by his own backbenchers.</p> <p>Then we have <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/oct/19/george-osborne-inspector-train-ticket\" title=\"\">George Osborne</a> and the rail ticket spat, admittedly small stuff but beautifully playing into the first-class toff and standard class nation story. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/oct/20/norman-tebbit-dog-coalition-government\" title=\"\">Lord Tebbit</a> weighs in too, criticising Cameron's incompetence.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/oct/21/alex-salmond-snp-conference\" title=\"\">Alex Salmond</a>, fresh from signing his referendum deal, calls Cameron Lord Snooty. A shift in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2012/oct/18/david-cameron-energy-bill-tariff-plan\" title=\"\">energy policy</a>, made on the hoof as a populist headline-grabber is immediately exposed as incoherent and becomes a PR disaster. I expect the same thing when Cameron's latest \"<a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2220757/David-Cameron-PM-promises-seek-retribution-law-breakers-new-anti-crime-crackdown.html\" title=\"\">Mug a Hoodie</a>\" anti-crime crackdown sees the light of day this week.</p> <p>For the first time political editors of pro-Tory papers are reporting that Conservative MPs going well beyond the usual suspects now regard Cameron as a political liability, a potential loser. Yet the cries of \"Boris, Boris\" are in vain. Sir Mophead is stuck in his London castle, unable to reach Westminster in time. How much worse can it get? Short of Cameron being caught on camera stealing puppies from orphans and shooting them for fun, it's hard to see.</p> <p>Meanwhile the biggest under-reported story of the weekend was surely the London, Glasgow and Belfast <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/20/trade-unions-march-against-cuts\" title=\"\">marches and rallies against the cuts</a>, which saw nurses, teachers, doctors, community groups, pensioners and others coming onto the streets in big numbers \u2013 at least 100,000 in London.</p> <p>True, Ed Miliband was booed when he said there would be further austerity under Labour \u2013 but this was useful for him, rather than the reverse. He went, he told the truth, he didn't just say what people wanted him to hear; but he also felt and listened to a few of the vast numbers of ordinary Britons who are hurting and who are too rarely heard in the introverted Westminster and media bubble. This is presumably why Miliband came into politics; this is what Labour is for; and it must have been a rejuvenating moment.</p> <p>And yet this autumn is probably the point of maximum danger for Labour. It's exactly the time not to relax. For all is not as it seems. What matters most for Cameron and Osborne is the economy. And there are indeed the first small shoots of recovery, if the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/oct/17/uk-unemployment-falls-lowest-ons\" title=\"\">unemployment</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/oct/16/uk-inflation-lowest-since-november-2009\" title=\"\">inflation figures</a> are anything to go by. We have to be cautious. Labour always has to remind us that any recovery is later and smaller than it would have been had the coalition made better economic judgments. But Labour cannot now assume that the country will feel despairing in 2015.</p> <p>Cameron has proved a far less capable prime minister than he seemed during his first year in office. He doesn't appear to have a firm grip. Perhaps those jibes about his laziness are right. He has a Blair-like weakness for instant policy announcements to buy time. He has been stubborn about the wrong things \u2013 Andy Coulson, Mitchell \u2013 and indecisive over things that matter to the Tory heartland, notably Europe. Coalition governments are inevitably fuzzier than single party ones, but Cameron seems to have taken on that fuzziness personally, leaving others, such as Michael Gove and Boris Johnson, to represent clear Conservative values.</p> <p>Yet Cameron won the Tory leadership and became prime minister for good reasons. He is supremely self-confident and enjoys a fight. He loves power and will do almost anything to keep it. And if the economy is beginning to improve, he will have the bones of a case to make. Between now and the general election, there are two massive political events that could play in his favour.</p> <p>First, there is the continuing unwinding of the eurozone, now complicated by the deteriorating relationship between <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/17/francois-hollande-angela-merkel-austerity\" title=\"\">Merkel and Hollande</a>, laid bare in last week's Guardian interview. Some major rethinking of powers is now inevitable and that will give Cameron and William Hague their chance. As a pro-European party, Labour will have to be deft and clever not to be caught on the unpopular side of a national argument, or rejecting the people's right to choose.</p> <p>Second, there is the Scottish referendum of 2014. If the Scots vote against independence, many English and Welsh voters will be hostile to further inducements and powers going to Edinburgh as a reward. The only obvious quid pro quo will be fewer Scottish seats still at Westminster, which is bad for Labour. If the Scots vote for independence, of course, it will be harder to upend Tory domination south of the border.</p> <p>Tough times and hard decisions are coming. In politics, this has been a surprising and entertaining few weeks. But nothing revelatory has happened. Nothing fundamental has shifted. What the chief whip really said to a copper, and which ticket the chancellor bought, will soon be relegated to questions in the Christmas quiz pages.</p> <p><a href=\"https://jp.twitter.com/JackieAshley\" title=\"\"><em>Twitter: @jackieashley</em></a></p>",

  "<p>Peter Hitchens likes to present himself as the Millwall FC of punditry; no one likes him, and he doesn't care. He knows his new book about drugs will go down badly among metropolitan liberals, and says he has \"absolutely no chance whatsoever of influencing anything\". Fleet Street's patron saint of lost causes, he writes: \"Almost certainly the battle to halt the spread of mind-altering drugs is lost.\" And yet for someone confronting futility and derision, he appears remarkably cheerful. \"Well, it's what I've always dreamed of \u2013 of being the kind of person who gets written about. I dreamed of being part of the exciting people who were in the arguments.\"</p> <p>For the guileless pathos of that statement alone, I could forgive Hitchens almost anything. You might say there is much to forgive. Every week in the Mail on Sunday he delivers a thunderous sermon against the moral degradation of all things modern, and his latest book, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2012/oct/14/narcomania-review-war-never-fought\" title=\"\">The War We Never Fought</a>, makes some jaw-dropping claims. He conflates the scourge of drugs with everything from lottery winners to Oxbridge graduates who haven't heard of <a href=\"http://oald8.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/dictionary/mr-micawber\" title=\"\">Mr Micawber</a>, and has a hilarious gift for the waspish afterthought, as in: \"Teachers are no longer really teachers. If they acted as if they are, they would probably be prosecuted\", or police officers no longer patrol the streets, because they're too busy \"suing each other for racial or sexual harassment\". I can think of no other contemporary writer who, when describing a member of the dreaded liberal elite, would add this detail in parenthesis: \"She and her second husband (she is divorced).\"</p> <p>We disagree about almost everything, but I find him impossible to dislike. In person he is polite and engaged, and in print always a contrarian but never a controversialist, sincere in beliefs that are almost as unfashionable on the right as they are anathema to the left. He champions civil liberties but abhors libertarianism, would like to bring back hanging and see off pre-marital sex, and is in a perpetual state of lament for the passing of Christian values, which he dates back to the first world war. \"If anybody else tells me that I think the 1950s were a golden age, I'll strangle them. I remember the 1950s \u2013 chilblains, Wall's ice cream, everybody smoked. I&#xa0;didn't like the 1950s.\" Hitchens's golden age was the late Victorian/early Edwardian era, a period of \"How shall&#xa0;I&#xa0;say? Increasing self-imposed moral conduct.\"</p> <p>The War We Never Fought makes a characteristically counter-intuitive argument. It is nonsense to say the war on drugs has failed, Hitchens contends, when in actual fact we have never even tried to wage it. Drug-taking was, in effect, decriminalised by the <a href=\"http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1971/38/contents\" title=\"\">Misuse of Drugs Act 1971</a>, ever since when the authorities have deployed the rhetoric of toughness to conceal the truth that we are free to take drugs with impunity, knowing our crime will probably be ignored, or at worst not punished but \"treated\". It suits the liberal elite to pretend the draconian rhetoric is true, because it justifies their claim that the law is unjustly repressive and should be abolished altogether. The solution to the alleged failure of the war is not to give up and give in, but to start fighting it.</p> <p>The author's great merit is his honesty. \"Drug-taking,\" Hitchens writes, \"is the purest form of self-indulgence,\" for it severs the link between hard work&#xa0;and reward, making \"deferred gratification appear a waste of time and a foolish rejection of readily available delight\". He regards all forms of self-stupefecation as morally wrong, and unlike others who make the case against drugs on legal or medical grounds is quite candid: this is ultimately, he says, a moral argument. The downside is that once he has stated this position, there is not much more to say. It would barely sustain a column, let alone a book; you either agree with him, or you do not. So he is drawn into making all sorts of arguments based on health, science and judicial statistics, none of which stands up.</p> <p>Hitchens thinks the legal drug classification system, under which cannabis is considered less dangerous than heroin or crack, is \"scientifically meaningless\". Has he ever seen someone trying to give up heroin? \"No, I can't claim to know what it looks like, no.\" Has he ever seen anyone trying to give up cannabis? \"No.\" Does he think the two are equivalent? \"Well, since I haven't seen either of them, I don't know. But as I don't believe in addiction, it's of no interest to me.\"</p> <p>Hitchens thinks there is no such thing as addiction? \"No, it's just laughable. I believe in free will. People take drugs because they enjoy it.\" I agree that many people take drugs such as cannabis because they like it \u2013 but doesn't he wonder why those same people would never dream of touching heroin? Happy, successful, stable people seldom inject smack, whereas most junkies suffered catastrophic childhoods, often in care and often abused. Doesn't that tell us something critically important about the difference between drugs?</p> <p>\"Yeah, but ultimately, so what? All these people would be helped by a properly enforced law which punished them for doing it, because then fewer would do it, and they'd be rescued from it.\" If the horror of heroin addiction is insufficient to deter someone from shooting up, the prospect of being arrested is unlikely to put them off. But&#xa0;Hitchens places unfathomable faith in the power of the law to control&#xa0;human behaviour.</p> <p>He also places great importance on&#xa0;the function of the law to express society's disapproval. How can we expect parents to stop their children taking cannabis, he argues, when the drug's status as \"soft\" \u2013 and by implication therefore harmless \u2013 is enshrined in law? But society disapproves of lots of things, without making them illegal; he isn't calling for marital infidelity to be outlawed, say, so why drugs? \"It's a&#xa0;question of practicality. How would you enforce such a law?\" That's precisely the argument made against drug prohibition. \"But who says it's unenforceable? No one has tried. Possession of drugs is an objective act, possible to prove in a court of law.\" But so is extra-marital sex, when it results in pregnancy; with DNA testing, every adulterous parent could be brought bang to rights. \"Well, I suppose so, but I'm not in favour of that. I don't think that it's a sensible or proper use of policing.\" Which is exactly what people say about the law against cannabis.</p> <p>In an ideal world, Hitchens would outlaw alcohol and tobacco too, but as it is he takes the eminently pragmatic view that both drugs are too entrenched in our culture to be banned. He applauds our laws controlling their sale for achieving valuable harm reduction \u2013 yet when the same principle of harm reduction is applied to other drugs, he is incensed. \"Have you looked at the <a href=\"http://www.talktofrank.com/\" title=\"\">Talk to Frank website</a>? Have you looked at the thing? Financed by you and me!\"</p> <p>Although he does drink, he hasn't been drunk since he was 15. On the other hand, he needs a strong caffeine hit every morning before he can start writing, and drinks coffee while we talk. If a stimulant that \"severs the link between hard work and reward\" is immoral, why is that OK? \"Caffeine? Come on. It's just not a serious point. I&#xa0;mean, come on. Caffeine!\" But that's exactly what people say about cannabis. \"Well, it may be what they would say about it, but it wouldn't be true. There is no case of anybody taking all their clothes off and swimming naked in an English river after drinking coffee.\"</p> <p>If his argument is fundamentally about morals, and he believes all drugs are by definition as bad as each other, their impact on a user's behaviour is logically neither here nor there. But Hitchens cites swimming in a freezing cold river because this was one of the things a friend's son did while in the grip of a psychosis triggered, Hitchens believes, by smoking cannabis. Hitchens is not faking his anguish at the boy's fate; his eyes well with tears as he talks about him. But it's here that his whole argument becomes increasingly inconsistent.</p> <p>Hitchens doesn't believe in addiction, because it cannot be objectively proven by any scientific test. For the same reason, he refuses to recognise other \"modern\" medical conditions such as ADHD or dyslexia, which he dismisses as \"disreputable, unscientific rubbish\". But no objective test exists for schizophrenia and psychosis either, their diagnoses depending upon definitions so subjective that they change according to the whim of whichever doctors are put in charge of making them up. And yet, time and again, Hitchens cites their grave risk as the reason why cannabis should be illegal.</p> <p>\"To say that I can't give you an objective description is not axiomatically to say that they don't exist,\" he protests \u2013 and he may well be right. But that's what people say about dyslexia. \"Well, it may be, but they are wrong.\"</p> <p>Hitchens quotes with approval <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/toby-young\" title=\"\">Toby Young's claim</a> that cannabis did him far more harm than cocaine \u2013 but then dismisses as delusional Young's insistence that cocaine did him no harm. If I were to tell him that I'd taken lots of drugs in my youth, and suffered irreparable mental damage, what would he say? \"I would say: 'What a pity.'\" And if I told him they had done me no harm at all? \"I would say: 'How can you know?'\" Leaving aside the self-evident bias in these responses, by his own logic I might have been much less happy, successful or intelligent had I never taken drugs. \"I accept the possibility,\" he concedes reluctantly. \"But it's bull.\"</p> <p>\"Those who do not wish to&#xa0;listen to the informed and cogent warnings of leading scientists,\" he writes, \"will find excuses not to do so.\" But isn't that exactly what he does, whenever any leading scientist \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/david-nutt\" title=\"\">Professor David Nutt</a>, say \u2013 presents data he doesn't like? \"I do not think that Professor Nutt's statements on the dangers of drugs are cogent,\" Hitchens retorts testily, rather proving the point. He accuses Nutt of \"mixing the subjective with the objective\", but I think a psychologist would probably call this projection. Where is the reputable scientific justification for his insistence that cannabis sends people mad, and is \"one of the most dangerous drugs known to man\"?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398056887\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2012/10/19/1350660295324/Peter-and-Christopher-Hit-010.jpg\" alt=\"Peter and Christopher Hitchens, 1999\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Peter Hitchens and his older brother Christopher (left) deep in discussion in 1999. Photograph: Sam Pearce/Camera Press</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sam Pearce/Camera Press</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\"I'm a propagandist,\" he shrugs.</p> <p>Round and round we go, not getting very far. Hitchens maintains that it's practically impossible to get locked up for possession, and that even dealers are unlucky to wind up in jail. That might come as a surprise to 16% of the prison population. Between 1998 and 2006, the number of people sent to prison for drug offences increased by 91%, whereas the increase for other offenders was just 53%, according to Alex Stevens, professor of criminal justice and author of <a href=\"http://www.routledge.com/books/details/9780415491044/\" title=\"\">Drugs, Crime and Public Health</a>. Doesn't that sound like a war being waged on drugs?</p> <p>\"Criminal statistics are easy to misread,\" cautions Hitchens, and he is right. But in the absence of any definitive factual consensus, his argument looks more like an article of faith than an empirical thesis.</p> <p>The war on drugs is a lot like abortion, both debates being framed in legal and medical terms, but really motivated by something much more primitive. Hitchens invokes morality, and deserves credit for coming closer to the truth than most, but ultimately I think it boils down not to morals so much as emotions. His position is just as inconsistent, subjective and contradictory as everyone else's, but makes perfect sense as an expression of how he feels about the world.</p> <p>It was Hitchens's defining misfortune, almost 61 years ago, to be born the younger brother of the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/christopher-hitchens\" title=\"\">more famous writer Christopher</a>. \"When you're a small child, and you have a brother, you want to catch up with them. I just wanted to be as big as, be as strong as, all the things a younger brother feels.\" Hitchens owed his first job \u2013 in 1973, on the Socialist Worker \u2013 to Christopher's connections, and was a loyal young apprentice to his brother's revolutionary leftwing politics. But he could never compete with his mercurial sibling's legendary charisma, leaving a rightward march back towards their parents' parochial, blimpish politics as the only available alternative. In 1977, he joined the Daily Express, where he toiled away as a worthy if unglamorous reporter until Richard Desmond's arrival propelled him \u2013 a conscientious objector to pornography \u2013 into the arms of the Mail on Sunday and a weekly column where he could be as unlike his&#xa0;brother as humanly possible.</p> <p>If Christopher was louche, hedonistic and iconoclastic, Hitchens would be fastidious, puritanical and Christian. Why else would his latest book condemn rock music as tantamount to a narcotic, \"sometimes a stimulant and sometimes a depressant, but always influential over the moods of its listeners,\" when he must know the same could be said of opera or Elgar? Only his heart, not his head, could write that Toby Young was \"lucky\" not to wind up in a locked psychiatric ward after smoking cannabis, for even the most alarmist interpretation of the medical data does not declare psychosis the most likely consequence. For Hitchens, drugs are really a metaphor for what he calls the \"cultural revolution\" of the 60s, which swept aside what was left of the England he now longs for.</p> <p>Christopher died of cancer last year, after a lifetime of heavy drinking and smoking, but even in death his memory still tends to eclipse his younger brother's presence. \"This is an amazing and unique experience to have an interview in which nobody has brought up my brother until <em>I</em> do it!\" he says, but his laughter sounds more peevish than amused. Christopher had published his memoir only a year before his death. \"One of the problems of having Christopher as a brother is that you felt that the writing about our family was writing about <em>his</em> family. He forgot he was also writing about mine.\" Hitchens would much rather the world did not know that their father drank to excess.</p> <p>The two brothers were never close in adulthood, for along with their politics, their lifestyles also parted company; unlike the twice-married, atheist Christopher, Hitchens is a devout church-going Anglican and lives with his wife and three children in Oxford. But his politics today share something important with the communism of his old revolutionary self. Just as Marxism only makes sense if you believe basic human impulses can be eradicated in the interest of a greater good, the same is true of Hitchens's faith in the power of the law to defeat a basic human instinct for intoxification. \"I'm not a utopian! I'm not a perfectionist!\" he protests, but perhaps a touch too much. As with most of his political positions, his argument for a drugs prohibition makes sense \u2013 as long as you have never met an actual human being.</p> <p>I ask him if he has ever broken the law himself. \"Oh yes,\" he replies, as quick as a flash, he often broke it during revolutionary protests in his youth. Why didn't the threat of penalty deter him? He thinks for a moment. \"When I was in my law-breaking phase I was the kind of person who should have been locked up. I was the kind of person who should be locked up, and possibly strung up. It would have been the only language I&#xa0;understood.\"</p> <p>I ask why he thinks people always say he is humourless, when it seems to me that while he is certainly irony-free, he can be very funny. \"Hmm, probably unintentionally,\" he murmurs. \"I have no sense of humour. You know that.\"</p> <p>I don't think he believes that for a minute. \"Oh, I'm a horrible, brutal, sexist, racist, homophobic monster.\" That's not a self-appraisal but a self-defence mechanism, isn't it?</p> <p>\"Well, there you are then. Alternatively, none of that is true.\"</p>",
  "<p>Europe's most senior judge has warned that the government is in danger of undermining human rights legislation and thrown back accusations that the Strasbourg court is responsible for lengthy delays in extradition cases.</p> <p>In an interview with the Guardian before stepping down as president of the European court of human rights (ECHR) at the end of the month, Sir Nicolas Bratza also says that the government's reluctance to grant prisoners voting rights is \"damaging\".</p> <p>His comments are a robust response to criticism directed at Strasbourg and the ECHR by the home secretary, Theresa May, and the lord chief justice, Lord Judge.</p> <p>In the wake of protracted appeals involving the terror suspects Abu Hamza and Abu Qatada, as well as the alleged computer hacker Gary McKinnon, concern has mounted about cases lasting as long as eight or 10 years.</p> <p>In the Commons last week, May said: \"We will work closely with the European court of human rights on a programme to reduce the wholly unacceptable delays that have occurred there.\"</p> <p>Last month, Judge said legal holdups were \"a source of real fury to me\" and in reference to Hamza added: \"I do not think \u2026 you will discover that the delays in that particular case, or in many like it, are actually to be levelled at the doors of the courts here.\"</p> <p>Speaking in Strasbourg, Bratza said: \"I have read what the lord chief justice has to say about it, where he exonerates his own courts and talks about 'the courts here', and the implication is that perhaps the Strasbourg court is to blame. I don't think that's fair if that's the implication.</p> <p>\"These were cases of considerable complexity. There was great co-operation between the parties. Never once did the UK complain that we were dragging our feet or taking too long. On the contrary, the UK, because of the need to find extensive evidence about supermax prisons, asked for a considerable extension of time to submit information.</p> <p>\"We acceded to that because it was important, but to blame the court for granting an extension that's been requested by the government \u2026 would be unfair. I don't accept for one moment that we were guilty of the substantial delay with which we seem to have been saddled.</p> <p>\"The returning of people to another country whether by deportation or extradition is very difficult.\"</p> <p>The case of Abu Qatada, which is before the UK's special immigration appeals commission (Siac), might return to Strasbourg, he said.</p> <p>The ECHR has accelerated its processing of cases, Bratza said, significantly reducing the notorious backlog. A victim of its own success, the court at one stage had 161,000 cases waiting to be dealt with. \"That figure is declining now and we are making great progress. Now it's down to 138,000.\"</p> <p>By using a single judge system and filtering out inadmissible cases \"this year we have already achieved something like 70,000 cases. That's a phenomenal number of cases resolved. We were always accused of inefficiency. I think the figures disprove that.\" It is estimated that the backlog will be cleared completely by 2015.</p> <p>Bratza also questioned why the coalition had <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/law/2011/feb/16/bill-of-rights-review-imminent-david-cameron\" title=\"\">launched a bill of rights commission</a> to review the UK's obligations under the European convention on human rights. The commission is due to report by the end of the year. Eurosceptics hope it will dilute the Human Rights Act, while civil liberties groups are satisfied with the status quo.</p> <p>\"My problem is understanding why it's desirable to introduce a new bill of rights into law,\" said Bratza. \"The [existing] Human Rights Act is an extremely skilful piece of legislation which does strike exactly the right balance.</p> <p>\"The [UK] courts faced with it are able to draw upon 50 or 60 years of established jurisprudence [at Strasbourg]. If you start introducing a new bill of rights and possibly new definitions and new provisions which have slightly changed the rights that are already covered by the convention, there's a risk of incoherence creeping in \u2013 particularly if it's going to stand side by side with the convention, which will still bind the UK nationally.</p> <p>\"Until [we] see what [a new bill] adds or takes away, it's difficult to form an assessment but I don't see the need. It's said it would make it more British and will build in the right to a jury trial \u2026 Do you need to build it in as a separate right? I'm doubtful.\"</p> <p>Bratza also warned that the UK's reluctance to give prisoners voting rights \u2013 in defiance of repeated rulings by the ECHR \u2013 risked damaging the convention system. The final deadline for the UK to comply with the Strasbourg ruling is next month. In the meantime Strasbourg has accumulated several thousand related claims on voting rights from prisoners.</p> <p>\"The fact that there's been non-compliance with prisoners' rights has had an effect,\" Bratza said.</p> <p>\"For a country as important as the UK to be seen not to be implementing the judgment has had an impact. It's not led to any greater determination of other states to be defiant, but I do think that it's seen as damaging that a country as important as the UK has not complied with a court judgment yet.\"</p>"
