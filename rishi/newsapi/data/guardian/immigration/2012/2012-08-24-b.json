  "<p>\u2712If you get your eye in, this is rather a comical administration. They do for the government what that amateur art restorer in Spain did for the Ecce Homo. Or J. Cheever Loophole for the practice of law.</p> <p>Just at the time we need to be delicate with Latin America, they talk openly about storming the Ecuadorean embassy. (Shouldn't we just ignore Assange? It's the single thing he couldn't bear.) In the afterglow of the Olympics they reveal they've been misleading us about the sale of school playing fields.</p> <p>Theresa May won't make it easier for Chinese people to come here \"for security reasons\" \u2013 no doubt terrified by the hundreds of Chinese jihadists now storming round Europe \u2013 so they spend their millions in France and Germany instead.</p> <p>And George Osborne produces a new British miracle: austerity combined with massive increases in public borrowing.</p> <p>I was reminded of the Keystone Cops, rushing hither and thither to no apparent purpose, creating mayhem wherever they went. But at least they gave the impression that someone, somewhere was actually directing.</p> <p>\u2712Phyllis Diller, who died this week, always made me laugh, though she harks back to an earlier age in comedy when the only women who got work were those who were prepared to mock themselves and women generally.</p> <p>You rarely get that now. I never saw her live, but in the course of research into America's tackiest tourist attractions, I once visited Frederick's of Hollywood bra museum. Along with bras from Madonna and the Supremes, there was one owned by Phyllis Diller, marked \"this side up\".</p> <p>\u2712\"Sir\" Richard Branson may be the Julian Assange of British business, in that both believe the world revolves around them. Hence Branson's decision to set up an air service between Manchester and London, above the route of the train line that's been taken from him. (To be fair to Branson, his Pendolinos do the journey, city centre to city centre, in just over two hours \u2013 much quicker than the plane, unless you are transferring at Heathrow.)</p> <p>But my new hate-line is the recently nationalised east coast. Going to Edinburgh the other day our loco broke down, and we limped into Grantham where the management in effect hijacked a Leeds train and made it go to Edinburgh, thus making everyone on a hideously crowded train very late. Coming back they had cancelled the train before ours which, consequently, was jammed with people standing. They wouldn't even bring the trolley down, \"for safety reasons\". They apologised endlessly, but nobody offered a reason for the chaos. And have you noticed the creeping growth of railway talk? It's no longer a train, with engine and carriages, but a \"set\". Trains are at a \"stand\" rather than a stop. We \"arrive into Darlington\" instead of \"at Darlington\". I don't blame them though for the unstoppable \"train station\", an American phrase that distinguishes it from the more common bus station. The British term, when needed, is \"railway station\", but we lost that years ago.</p> <p>\u2712I mentioned last week that we had been to see Tristan und Isolde sung at the Usher Hall in Edinburgh. What I didn't mention was that Isolde was sung by Jennifer Wilson, the magnificent diva who comes from suburban Washington DC. She is a big woman, over 6ft tall and broad to match. Her bosom was simply majestic. All she lacked was a horned helmet.</p> <p>The Americans have a popular if slightly puzzling phrase, usually applied to sports, \"the opera ain't over till the fat lady sings\". When the Baltimore Orioles lost something like their first 20 baseball games one year, they put posters round the city showing a vast soprano in a helmet, with the legend, \"She ain't sung yet!\" They went on to have a much better season.</p> <p>Tristan was played by the Canadian Ben Heppner, and he has a belly quite as superb as the diva's own embonpoint. Luckily they weren't staging it because at the point where the opera is over, the directions say, \"she throws herself on Tristan's dead body\". It would have been like a bouncy castle for several minutes.</p> <p>Her Liebestod was out-of-this-world electric, thrilling, and when she walked \u2013 no, sailed \u2013 into the hotel lounge where we were all having a restorative drink, everyone stood up and applauded. She was extremely gracious.</p> <p>\u2712To lunch at The Oldie magazine, another celebration of its 20th birthday and to mark 75 glorious years of its editor, Richard Ingrams. There is a panache and self-confidence about these occasions which I like.</p> <p>Edward Enfield said he had been invited to a party at Hatchard's book shop, and had consulted his son Harry about what he should say when he met all these famous writers.</p> <p>\"Just keep saying 'marvellous!'\" Harry advised. One of those he encountered was Laurie Lee, by then more or less blind and deaf.</p> <p>\"Your book is marvellous, marvellous!\" he said. Lee peered at him. \"Is this praise?\" he asked. \"In that case I'll turn my hearing aid up.\"</p> <p>Maureen Lipman recalled how her late husband Jack Rosenthal had been working on a play in Los Angeles where he was accompanied by a young female researcher. \"Crossing the hotel lobby he saw an old, saggy man with a gorgeous girl one-third his age. He thought, 'do you have any idea how ridiculous you look?' then realised he was walking towards a mirror.\"</p> <p>And Barry Cryer, one of the magazine's best-loved favourites, said: \"we've got to the age when the candles cost more than the cake&#xa0;\u2026 I can remember when Tony Blair was white. Now he's the only person I know who's a Roman Catholic and an Orange man at the same time.\"</p> <p>\u2712More pointless labels: Nick Fisher was delighted to learn that his bag of Sainsbury's ice cubes were \"freezer-safe\". Iain Kelman was equally pleased to be told that his bottle of Asda own-brand water was \"good for hydration\" (\"as opposed to washing the car?\" he asks.) And driving from Northern Ireland \u2013 where they drive on the left \u2013 into the Republic, John Cartledge saw a helpful sign telling him to drive on the left.</p>",
  "<p>Two US embassy employees were shot at and wounded by Mexican police on Friday after they were caught up in a police chase on the outskirts of the capital, Mexican naval officials said.</p> <p>The US embassy vehicle was attacked just south of Mexico City, according to a government statement. A confused gun battle began around 8am after the embassy car, on its way to a naval installation with two US officials and a captain from the Mexican navy, was approached by car containing armed men.</p> <p>\"The driver of the diplomatic car manoeuvred to avoid the aggressors and get back onto the main road, at which point the crew of the aggressor vehicle opened fire,\" the statement said. \"Moments later three other vehicles joined the chase and shot at the US embassy vehicle.\"</p> <p>Speaking anonymously, a Mexican government security official said federal police had thought the vehicle belonged to a group of suspected kidnappers they were pursuing, and had opened fire on it. \"This was all because of a mix-up,\" the official said.</p> <p>The government statement was not clear about the point at which the federal police got involved, or whether any bullets fired from their weapons wounded the US government workers.</p> <p>It said the US employees were recovering in hospital from \"non-life threatening\" injuries, and that the naval captain was unharmed.</p> <p>The Associated Press quoted an unnamed law enforcement official saying one of the wounded men had been shot in the leg and the other in the stomach and hand. The official did not identify their jobs, but he did rule out that either belonged to Drug Enforcement Administration, the DEA, or the FBI.</p> <p>The incident took place on a highway on the southern outskirts of Mexico City close to the city of Cuernavaca, which has been ravaged by criminal gangs during the government's conflict with drug cartels.</p> <p>A number of different organised criminal groups, most famously the remnants of the Beltran Leyva drug cartel, are known to have a presence in the mountainous area just beyond the Mexican capital in the state of Morelos.</p> <p>Morelos has suffered from periodic bouts of intense violence during the drug wars that have killed over 55,000 people since President Felipe Calder\u00f3n launched a military-led offensive against the country's drug cartels in December 2006.</p> <p>Although attacks on diplomatic personnel are not common, there have been several in recent years including one last year in northern Mexico which killed a US immigration and customs enforcement agent.</p> <p>The incident is, at the very least, highly embarrassing for the highly resourced Federal Police which Calder\u00f3n set up a few years ago with significant US support, and has repeatedly sought to promote as the biggest achievement of his efforts to modernise the country's law enforcement capabilities.</p> <p>The force is still recovering from the damage to its image down by an incident in the food court of Mexico City's international airport in June in which three federal agents were shot dead by colleagues also in uniform who, according to the official version of events, were on the point of arresting them in connection with drug smuggling investigations.</p>",
  "<p>Plans to seize Julian Assange \"under all circumstances\" the moment he leaves the Ecuadorean embassy in London have accidentally been revealed by a police officer displaying restricted documents outside the embassy.</p> <p>The document, pictured under the officer's arm by a Press Association photographer, appears to advocate arresting the WikiLeaks founder whether he leaves the building in a diplomatic bag or in a diplomatic car.</p> <p>The handwritten plan was recorded at a police briefing and only partially covered by the officer's arm as he arrived at the embassy in Knightsbridge on Friday.</p> <p>The brief begins: \"BRIEF \u2013 EQ. Embassy brief \u2013 Summary of current position Re Assange. Action required \u2013 Assange to be arrested under all circumstances.\" It then makes reference to a \"dip bag\" and a \"dip vehicle\".</p> <p>A Scotland Yard spokesman said: \"The document is one officer's notes from a briefing. Our objective is to arrest Julian Assange for breach of bail. Under no circumstances would any arrest be made which was in breach of diplomatic immunity.\"</p> <p>Assange, who has been in the building for two months, is wanted for questioning in Sweden over claims of sexual assault.</p> <p>He is refusing to travel to Scandinavia amid fears he will be extradited to the United States over his controversial website. Ecuador granted the Australian political asylum last week.</p> <p>The UK government has made it clear Assange, who denies the allegations, will be arrested if he steps outside the embassy after jumping bail.</p> <p>Speculation has been rife about possible escape routes, and Assange's legal team and the Ecuadorean government have talked about the possibility of safe passage to Ecuador.</p> <p>Ambassadors from several South American countries went to the embassy on Friday to show their solidarity with Ecuador.</p> <p>The British government has threatened, under a 1987 Act, to enter the embassy and arrest the 41-year-old, but foreign secretary William Hague has said there is no intention to \"storm\" the building.</p> <p>Ecuador's president has said the diplomatic row \"could be ended tomorrow\" if Britain gave the activist safe passage to South America. <strong> </strong></p>",
  "<p>Climb behind the wheel, hit the \"power\" button and a host of lights on the dashboard leap into life. The car's range in electric mode, you immediately learn, is 50 miles, plus a further 310 in petrol-powered reserve. You shift the automatic lever into drive, and it moves silently out into the traffic. The lack of any engine noise apart, this car goes like any other executive car \u2013 albeit with a slightly smaller interior than most. Welcome to the Vauxhall Ampera, hailed by its fans as the first \"e-car\" that, crucially, has the range to take you any place you care to go.</p> <p>This week Guardian Money examines the host of super-green cars to hit UK showrooms in the past few months and assesses whether they are now a serious alternative to conventional cars or remain rich people's toys.</p> <p>The petrol savings are eye-watering. Charging an Ampera to go 50 miles will set you back around \u00a32.50\u2013\u00a33, or nothing at all if you can access council-installed charging posts. Unlike other electric cars, this one has a petrol engine that will keep the wheels turning after the charge runs out. There's no vehicle tax or congestion charge to pay. But the purchase cost is very high; \u00a330,000 after the government's \u00a35,000 grant still makes it twice the price of the cheapest Ford Focus or \u00a310,000 more than a standard Ford Mondeo. The hours spent recharging will also put many people off. Overall, our analysis suggests that while the Ampera can, for some drivers, deliver financial gains, most average motorists will find that a Toyota Yaris hybrid, at under \u00a315,000, is a more realistic option.</p> <p>The Ampera \u2013 voted UK Car of the Year 2012 \u2013 was launched in the United States as the Chevvy Volt, and sales initially tanked, delighting right-wing commentators who derided it as the \"Obama-car\". But more recently, especially in California, sales have begun rising, although sales of other electric cars, such as the Nissan Leaf have been miserable.</p> <p>Will e-cars catch on in the UK? Money did the number-crunching and found that someone currently driving a 35mpg petrol car 80 miles every working day (around 20,000 miles a year) should save around \u00a33,000 a year in petrol by switching to an Ampera \u2013 but, crucially, they will need somewhere to charge the car at work and at home.</p> <p>Anyone living in a flat, or even a terraced house without a drive, will find it impractical to charge up the car unless they live in areas such as Brighton, Birmingham and large parts of London, where free charging posts are now relatively common (they are even popping up at motorway service stations). Run the car for a decade, though you will easily make enough savings on petrol to justify the initial price tag.</p> <p>The alternative is to buy a hybrid (petrol/electric) car, available for less than \u00a315,000 \u2013 not much more than it costs to buy a new standard diesel model.</p> <p>\"Range anxiety\" has long been the issue (after price) that deters buyers. The all-electric Nissan Leaf can only cover 90 miles before a recharge, and then it's not like filling up at a petrol station \u2013 it will take four hours or more. This is Ampera's trump card, as it can be driven on as an electric-only car \u2013 for the cost of just a few pounds in electricity \u2013 and still be taken on a 300-mile trip with the help of its petrol back-up.</p> <p>If you're wondering why the Ampera qualifies as an electric car rather than a hybrid it's because the Ampera is always powered electrically. Its 1.4-litre petrol engine only comes life when the battery becomes depleted, feeding enough power back to the battery to keep the car going.</p> <p>Crucially, it's the electric engine only that drives the car. In a hybrid, the petrol engine drives the car above certain low speeds.</p> <p>Vehicle renting company Zipcar, one of the first major buyers of the Ampera, offered us a test drive, and we were genuinely impressed. What strikes you first is that, unlike some other electric cars, the American-built Ampera has an executive, well put-together feel, and its relaxed drive is well suited to urban motoring.</p> <p>Put the car in \"normal\" driving mode, and it does the rest. On a four-hour, high-power, charge \u2013 or six hours plugged to a household socket \u2013 it will go almost 50 miles of normal driving in electric mode before the petrol engine helps out.</p> <p>Officially, the Ampera offers 235.4mpg, but in theory, if you drive 40 miles to work, give it a full charge, then drive home, you won't use a drop of petrol. Meanwhile, every time you brake, the energy is recycled to recharge the battery.</p> <p>Inside the four-door car the battery takes up some room. As a result the interior is smaller than you might expect \u2013 similar to a compact exec car. There are two rear seats which would be OK for children, but accommodating two Olympic hammer throwers would be struggle. The rear visibility isn't great, but there is a reversing camera in the dash, along with a very swish satnav. The hatchback boot space is small for a car of this size, but not absurdly so.</p> <p>Contrary to what many people think about electric cars, the acceleration is great. Vauxhall says 0-60mph is achieved in nine seconds and the car will go up to a top speed of 100mph. Running in petrol-generating mode the car appears to return around 40mpg, until it can be recharged.</p> <p>The Ampera is backed by a \"lifetime/100,000 mile new vehicle warranty\", while the battery system has an eight-year/100,000 mile warranty, transferable to subsequent owners. Servicing is annual, at one of the 24 dealers supplying this car in the UK. Insurance is likely to be the same or a little higher than comparable-sized conventional cars. Reliability and battery life remain the big unknowns, as are likely resale values (though Zipcar says early signs are encouraging). The 100,000- mile warranty should ease some buyers' fears, but to pay out \u00a330,000 on such a car is still something of a leap of faith.</p> <p>Ultimately, the price tag is likely to put off all but the most committed of buyers. However, if you drive to work and have access to recharging points, it's worth trying an Ampera and seeing if the sums work for you, particularly if you pay company car tax. A stress-free option could be to lease one. Contracts can be had from around \u00a3400 a month, which sounds a lot until you realise your fuel bills could be a fraction of what they are now.</p> <h2>The Mini E \u2013 is this the future of eco-friendly driving?</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395139922\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Money/Pix/pictures/2012/8/23/1345735115151/Mark-King-relaxes-on-the--008.jpg\" alt=\"Mark King relaxes on the bonnet of a BMW Mini E \" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Whoosh: Mark King and the BMW Mini E. Photograph: Katia King</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Katia King</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p> I've never turned heads driving a 10-year-old Volkswagen Golf, but pootling along the residential streets near my Sussex home in a prototype Mini E seemed to attract admiring stares from pedestrians. Perhaps they were as fascinated as I was by the eerie Star Trek whooshing noise the car makes.</p> <p>BMW has taken an existing Mini shell and retro-fitted it with battery power to create the Mini E, a fully electric vehicle. When it arrived on my doorstep \u2013 a loan from EDF Energy \u2013 one major drawback was immediately obvious: it requires so many batteries to power it that there is no back seat. For a family of three this makes the Mini E somewhat impractical; it's for one driver and a single passenger.</p> <p>At least as it gave me a chance to see how the car handles \u2013 and boy, does it handle well. With instant acceleration, there's no delay between touching the pedal and moving forward. Touch it too hard and you're thrown back in your seat. It's fast. Really fast.</p> <p>The speedometer indicated the car might be able to reach speeds of up to 160mph, though I was told BMW had capped my vehicle at 95mph. When I ventured on to the A23 near Brighton, I (safely) floored it and discovered the car had no problems reaching a legal 70mph. It kicks myths about electric cars being like milk floats firmly into touch.</p> <p>But a feature known as \"regenerative braking\" was hard to get used to. In order to put juice back into the battery, and prolong the range of the car, it brakes of its own accord the second you lift your foot off the accelerator. When approaching junctions this can be useful, but if you're used to gently easing off the accelerator and cruising slowly to a natural stop it's disconcerting at best and irritating at worst.</p> <p>Speed-freaks might be frustrated too. The faster you go, the more charge you use up, and there are far fewer charging points than petrol stations. In some ways this makes it safer for other road users and pedestrians because it encourages slower, responsible driving, although the car's near-silence means you might worry that pedestrians can't hear you approaching.</p> <p>Clearly, it's that all-important range that is the big question. The Mini E I tested was locked to accept only a 12-volt charge, which meant it took eight hours to fully charge the battery (a 30-volt charge would halve this time). And for your eight hours you get about 100 to 110 miles, making it only really practical for someone who can charge it at home \u2013 but this requires a piece of kit costing around \u00a3800 to ensure your mains electricity is safe. Without home-charging, you'll quickly develop \"range anxiety\" \u2013 constantly worrying about how much juice you have left.</p> <p>There are plenty of electric car charging points in Brighton and I had no trouble finding one; most are free to use at the moment. While I knew I wouldn't be giving it a full charge (I didn't fancy hanging around for eight hours), I had to laugh when I looked up at the sign that read: \"Max stay three hours\" \u2013 that wouldn't get me half-charged let alone fully topped up. To be fair, that's an issue for the local council rather than BMW or Mini, but it does make you wonder how councils will cope if electric vehicles do take off. Will all public charging spaces become ridiculously busy? Will councils introduce fees for using them? Will they build more to cope with demand?</p> <p>The estimated 3p a mile running cost would more than halve my current expenditure, but the range of the car and the tiny interior makes it impractical for my family, and if you do wish to drive far, you'd have to make repeated stops to boost your battery.</p> <p>If you're single, in a couple or run a city-based business, it'll be much more appealing, but even then a fully electric car will be no good if you live in an block of flats or do not have a garage, driveway or parking spot near your property. <strong>Mark King</strong></p>",
  "<p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/shirley-maclaine\" title=\"\">Shirley MacLaine</a> comes to the door in slippers and a tracksuit, clutching a fistful of hair and looking, at 78, like an only slightly older version of those famous 1960s roles of hers: gleeful, sharp-eyed, almost confrontationally scatty. We're at her pied-\u00e0-terre in Malibu \u2013 she lives most of the time on a ranch in New Mexico \u2013 a bungalow overlooking the ocean in a secure development popular with celebrities, she says, because of the anonymity; although, when she calls me a cab at the end of the interview, she says blithely down the phone, \"Hello, it's Shirley MacLaine\", then stands in the driveway, eating a cracker and waving at the driver as he turns in the drive.</p> <p>This autumn, MacLaine appears opposite <a href=\"http://film.guardian.co.uk/Player/Player_Page/0,,506355,00.html\" title=\"\">Maggie Smith</a> in <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/tv-and-radio/downton-abbey\" title=\"\">Downton Abbey</a>, the kind of shark versus bear pairing TV execs only dream about and that, for incongruity, is right up there with the time Liz Taylor appeared in a Miss Marple. <a href=\"http://www.itv.com/downtonabbey/news/shirley-maclaine-cast/\" title=\"\">MacLaine will play Martha Levinson, Lady Cora's mother, sweeping in from New York to upset the household</a>. Or, as MacLaine puts it as we sit down in her living room, \"My character is not crass, but more emotionally democratic than the English. She goes over there to say, 'Rethink your attitudes about tradition!'\" She has known Dame Maggie for almost 40 years and what a delight it is, she says, to sit around on set all day, \"two senior citizens\", gossiping. There was one particular scene, a wedding in a church\u2026 hang on, who gets married?!</p> <p>\"Oh, I forget now.\" (MacLaine has the actor's habit of total amnesia concerning scenes she's not&#xa0;central to.)</p> <p>\"But Maggie and I are there in the scene. And we don't like to get up from our chairs; we just sit. And we must have sat for seven hours in this church. Just talking, talking.\"</p> <p>What about?</p> <p>\"Men. Health.

How old is this person?</p> <p>\"A hundred and twenty. And we both wondered how this was possible. We're both divorced, so we talked about that. We talked about if we want a man in our lives again.\"</p> <p>And?</p> <p>\"I don't want to share that.\" She thinks for a moment. \"Put it this way: if a good-looking, elderly man had walked in just then... we would have still stayed there talking.\" MacLaine explodes with dirty laughter.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395053958\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/22/1345649551800/Shirley-MacLaine-film-com-008.jpg\" alt=\"Shirley MacLaine film composite\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">From right: with Michael Caine in Gambit (1966); in John Goldfarb, Please Come Home (1965); with \u00adPeter Sellers in Woman Seven Times (1967); with Jack Lemmon in The Apartment (1960).

She is very smart, of course, and inclined to pick up on stupid questions. She talks about celebrity in a way other celebrities do not \u2013 the insecurity, the neediness of her peers, the fact you cannot, in most cases, be an A-list actor without being at some level a nutcase. It amuses her to test people. For example, in among the clutter on her coffee table is a joke coffee cup with fake liquid spilling out of it that looks very real. MacLaine once put it on a chair and invited an estate agent who was trying to win business from&#xa0;her to sit down.</p> <p>\"She saw it and sat,\" says MacLaine. \"Didn't say&#xa0;anything.\"</p> <p>What, because you're famous and she didn't want to upset the talent?</p> <p>\"Exactly. That's how full of shit she was.\"</p> <p>She is the first to mock her own reputation. \"People think I'm nuts,\" is a common MacLaine refrain, which they certainly do, although the fact&#xa0;she acknowledges it softens the impression,&#xa0;so that all that business \u2013 the reincarnation, the crystals, the aliens \u2013 plays out more like an eccentric hobby than full on insanity.</p> <p>Above all, one is warned of her waspishness. Early on in our encounter, MacLaine says something mildly interesting about Downton \u2013 how the English cast members were too afraid to ask her any questions about Hollywood, although they obviously wanted to \u2013 news I receive, as one does in interviews, as if it is the most fascinating thing I have ever heard, putting my hand in front of my mouth in stark amazement. MacLaine drops the story and stares coldly at me.</p> <p>\"Poor dear,\" she says. \"You're suffering.</p> <p>\"No, I was just\u2026\"</p> <p>\"Hmm-mm.\" She is not interested in tolerating a rival performance.</p> <p>To this end, the thing she values most in life, she says, is honesty, for pragmatic as well as for moral reasons: the only way to be famous and not go mad, says MacLaine, is to hide in plain sight; to undermine the illusion of celebrity before anyone else can. This is both an honest approach and a contrivance to give the impression of honesty. MacLaine has been doing this a very long time.</p> <p>So anyway, Downton. \"They were gobsmacked,\" she says of the English cast. (MacLaine has picked up some British vernacular. To wit: \"They don't understand what a frigging hit they are!\")</p> <p>In one scene, they all sat around the table between takes stealing glances at her. \"They wanted to hear about Frank [Sinatra] and they wanted to hear about all my love affairs and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billy_Wilder\" title=\"\">Billy Wilder</a> and all of that. But they never asked.\"</p> <p>They were shy.</p> <p>\"No,\" she says firmly. \"It's a question of etiquette. It's a question of don't pry. A lot of people have that reaction to me. Until they meet&#xa0;me and then they see, shit, I'll talk about&#xa0;anything.\"</p> <p>I would quite like to keep her off Frank Sinatra and Dean Martin and the Rolodex of old lag stories rolled out every time she is written about. Has it ever occurred to her that if she was British, she'd be Dame Shirley by now? MacLaine hoots with laughter. \"I was thinking about that! Do I&#xa0;have to be British?\"</p> <p>I think so; Canadian at a pinch. (MacLaine's mother was Canadian). I don't think you can be knighted if you're American.</p> <p>\"No, Elton John is knighted!\"</p> <p>He's British.</p> <p>\"Oh, of course he is. Well, that's too bad.\"</p> <p>It came as a great surprise to MacLaine's parents that out of their regular household in Arlington, Virginia \u2013 mother a drama teacher, father a professor \u2013 they produced two top-flight movie stars. \"It's startling to me!\" she says. \"I mean, where did this come from? I don't have an answer.\" She can't speak for her brother <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000886/\" title=\"\">Warren Beatty</a> (and for periods has not spoken to Warren; she found his womanising distasteful), but thinks the two of them were put in the position of \"fulfilling our parents unrealised dreams\". She says, \"Warren would probably have a different way of saying it. But that's what I feel.\"</p> <p>Her father had a degree in philosophy and psychology from <a href=\"http://www.jhu.edu/\" title=\"\">Johns Hopkins University</a>, but harboured dreams of \"running away to join the circus\". Her mother was, well, \"my mother was Canadian, so you never knew what she was thinking. Why is she bumping into the furniture and apologising to it?\" It was a repressed household, which MacLaine was eager to get away from, and did, early, to train as a dancer.</p> <p>Thank god for her dance training, she says. Billy&#xa0;Wilder yelling at her on the set of <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0053604/\" title=\"\">The Apartment</a> was nothing compared with the hell a&#xa0;choreographer puts a young dancer through. Dancers are ambitious but not competitive with others, MacLaine says.</p> <p>Oh, come off it, I say. Her airy I-don't-compete attitude is not, in a movie star of her longevity, terribly credible, and she laughs and admits her own friends pick her up on it.</p> <p>\"When I said I've never been competitive to <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000870/\" title=\"\">Kathy Bates</a>, she hooted with laughter and said&#xa0;are you out of your fucking mind, of course you are!\"</p> <p>Anyway, the point is, says MacLaine, even in her mid-20s - her superstar period - she was not&#xa0;not in a death match with other actors for roles. For a while, the roles came to her; she won&#xa0;an Oscar nomination for her role in The Apartment, opposite Jack Lemmon, and again for&#xa0;her role opposite Sinatra in <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0052218/\" title=\"\">Some Came Running</a>, as the hopelessly endearing Ginnie Moorehead. This was the decade in which she knocked around with Sinatra and Dean Martin, taking her cabaret act to Vegas, where the front few tables were always taken up by mobsters. (They thought she&#xa0;was cute, MacLaine says, because she was the&#xa0;only person who had the cheek to talk back to&#xa0;them.)</p> <p>The celebrity world has moved on since then. She is nostalgic for the days when stars knew how&#xa0;to wear their celebrity lightly. \"Those guys joked around with their power. And their celebrity. It was all a joke. It was a time before paparazzi. You&#xa0;know when you eat too many sweets and get&#xa0;diabetes? Paparazzi are the diabetes of materialistic culture.\"</p> <p>She looks delighted with this.</p> <p>\"That's a good line!\"</p> <p>She was having lunch with <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/jennifer-aniston\" title=\"\">Jennifer Aniston</a> and <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0857620/\" title=\"\">Justin Theroux</a> the other day, she says, and by the time they finished, there were paparazzi outside the restaurant. \"I felt so bad. I think the restaurant called them.\"</p> <p>She will have a tough time drumming up much sympathy here. From the civilian point of view, someone such as Aniston is assumed to be complicit in her own exploitation.</p> <p>\"I think Diana did. And there are people who get a kick out of manipulating and moulding and sculpting their public image. But I do not think that people like Jennifer and Justin do.\"</p> <p>What about someone like <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/lindsay-lohan\" title=\"\">Lindsay Lohan</a>? She and MacLaine were slated to do a movie together but it didn't come together. They had a few meetings, though.</p> <p>\"And, you know, her conversation was 90% about her upbringing. Her parents. Now, she's also a master manipulator, and it's not hard to figure out I'm interested in all that stuff, so she was maybe using it. I don't know. I can't advise any of the young ones, because I don't know what their background was, but I would suggest that anyone who wants to be famous more than anything \u2013 there's a problem.\"</p> <p>Even if it coincides with real talent?</p> <p>\"Well, that's her. But...\" MacLaine sighs. \"Too&#xa0;much damage as a child.\"</p> <p>MacLaine talks a lot and with frankness in this kind of vein, about the people she has worked with and the damage the system has visited on them. I tell her I was reading her memoir the previous day.</p> <p>\"Which one?\" she asks sharply.</p> <p>My Lucky Stars.</p> <p>Aside from the chapter on what a nightmare it&#xa0;was working with Debra Winger on <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0086425/\" title=\"\">Terms Of Endearment</a> (there's an extraordinary scene in the book in which MacLaine recounts how, between takes and to throw her off, Winger jumps&#xa0;on MacLaine and pretends to perform oral sex on her), the book purported to be franker than it actually was. \"There is a lot I've never told,\" she says, \"but that'll be for some of my friends after I'm gone.\"</p> <p>You have an unpublished manuscript in a safe somewhere?</p> <p>\"Yep.\"</p> <p>Really?</p> <p>\"Yes.\"</p> <p>With instructions?</p> <p>\"No. I'm not <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2012/jun/27/nora-ephron\" title=\"\">Nora Ephron</a>.\"</p> <p>And these things you've withheld?</p> <p>\"Are to protect other people. Not myself.\"</p> <p>What you take away from the book is a thorough analysis of the role played by insecurity in her line of work. \"You have to be talentedly insecure in order to be a good actress,\" she says. \"And then it's the director's job to make you more miserable and get a good take.\" MacLaine does not strike me as being terribly insecure. When I&#xa0;ask if she ever wonders if she's worth it, the money and the fame, she says, \"That never occurred to me. I said it when I won the Oscar: I&#xa0;deserve this. I really meant it.\"</p> <p>Which, paradoxically, isn't the best mentality for someone in her business. She says, \"I'm one of the ones who is still around and kind of unabashedly real about everything. But maybe I&#xa0;would have been a lot better actor if I had allowed myself not to understand who I am.\"</p> <p>You killed the mystery?</p> <p>\"Maybe.\"</p> <p>Like writers who say they won't go into therapy?</p> <p>\"Yes. Norman Mailer and I used to have this argument all the time. He said neurosis is absolutely necessary to being a good writer. And I&#xa0;said, no: I think you're more talented if you know who you are.\" She thinks for a moment. \"But I can't say that knowing who you are makes you less neurotic.\" The thing she would never do, she says, is \"invade my own vulnerable privacy. It's kind of a rip-off when you go to work and the director wants you to cry. I've had a don't-step-across-that-border thing about me. That's why I'm the sane one. I've never experienced these Hollywood stories.\" (She was never in rehab. When MacLaine was knocking around in the 1960s with all those big drinkers and drug-takers, she would excuse herself from the room. \"I'd say, I'll see you when you get done. That could be my dad's influence. His disciplinarian mentality.\")</p> <p>What would she do, then, if a director tried to manipulate her like that?</p> <p>\"They don't do that. They're afraid of me. They're afraid of my honesty. In case I go too far.\"</p> <p>From all this glib dismissiveness, you would think she had never had a problem in her life. But when MacLaine was in her 40s, she was broke, unemployed, going through a divorce with Steve Parker, the husband with whom she has a grown-up daughter and who, she has said in the past, transferred a great deal of money from her account to his. I can't imagine her zen attitude surviving this intact, and she does allow that during the fallow period \u2013 \"Those years when the phone doesn't ring and you have no jobs\" \u2013 she went through a certain amount of existential unhappiness. But really, the only thing that upsets her in life is unfairness, she says. What, such as her husband taking her money?</p> <p>MacLaine looks weary. \"A lot of the money was intended for good investments. And with the divorce, I said to his lawyer, he can have anything he wants. And he took nothing: $100,000. And $10,000 a year.\"</p> <p>But he'd taken your money already!</p> <p>\"Yes. But by the way, I was leading a very open life with many men, so he took some of that money and gave it to the woman he was mostly involved with.\"</p> <p>It was your money!</p> <p>\"I know. But without him I wouldn't have been protected enough to be sane. He was my guardian,&#xa0;my manager, my companion, my helpmate. He never said anything about all my relationships. It was an interesting open marriage.\"</p> <p>She has never remarried. Her daughter, Sachiko, grew up mainly with her ex-husband, then living in Japan, which was probably a good thing, MacLaine says. It kept her out of the Hollywood rat race. Although, rather brutally, she&#xa0;says, \"I think she's always secretly wanted to&#xa0;be in showbusiness. I don't know what that's like. I don't know what it's like not to have what I&#xa0;want.\" MacLaine shrugs. \"But then, I don't want&#xa0;very much.\"</p> <p>Actually there was something she wanted recently and didn't get, which was to be cast in the movie version of the hit Broadway play, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/August:_Osage_County\" title=\"\">August: Osage County</a>. MacLaine campaigned for it, but it went to Meryl Streep. \"You get the routine, 'Well, we're not sure we can finance it...' They couldn't have financed it with me! They can&#xa0;with Meryl.\"</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395053959\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/22/1345649736293/Shirley-Maclaine-in-Downt-008.jpg\" alt=\"Shirley Maclaine in Downton Abbey TV series\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">As Martha Levinson, Lady Cora\u2019s mother, in the new series of Downton Abbey.

She has four potential movies in the works at the moment. She would like to do another series, if she could figure out a way to take the dog. We talk about class, again, and what happens when celebrities marry civilians, like Lady Sybil running off with the chauffeur.</p> <p>\"Which one's she again?\"</p> <p>The youngest one, with brown hair \u2013 don't worry about it.</p> <p>\"One of my best love affairs was with my driver,\" MacLaine says.</p> <p>Really?</p> <p>\"He was Canadian. We had the best time.\"</p> <p>Was your celebrity in the room with you?</p> <p>\"Sure. It was hard on him.\" She sighs. \"They want to be in it. They want to be you. There are two businesses in the world, Emma, two businesses: showbusiness and everybody else's business.\"</p> <p>If everyone wants to be famous, when you're famous, what do you want to be?</p> <p>\"First off, come and fucking stay on a movie set&#xa0;for a couple of days and see whether you like&#xa0;it. The question is why this needs to be acknowledged. There's a wrongness to it. Everybody wants to be famous, and it's because there's a spiritual vacancy. They try to find it with&#xa0;money, sex, religion. How are they going to&#xa0;fill that vacancy? And they try to do it with dreams of&#xa0;fame.\"</p> <p>The Scientologists have tried to recruit MacLaine many times, \"because they know I&#xa0;believe in reincarnation\". She bats them away. \"I'm not sure what they really believe. Much of it is secret.\"</p> <p>Anyway, so why didn't it work out with the&#xa0;driver?</p> <p>\"He was too intimidated by my fame. I don't know how any guy could have put up with me, really. Honestly.\" This in spite of the fact she says she is very undemanding. Every assistant she has had, MacLaine says, has told her she is the most low-maintenance person they have worked with.</p> <p>So what was there to put up with?</p> <p>\"Where?\"</p> <p>In your relationships? What drives them away?</p> <p>\"Oh, that. That I don't need 'em.\"</p> <p>It's a couple of years off yet, but for her 80th birthday MacLaine would like to fly a bunch of friends to New Mexico for dinner. This will separate the wheat from the chaff, she says. When you live out there, you really find out who&#xa0;your friends are. At a recent <a href=\"http://www.afi.com/\" title=\"\">American Film Institute</a> event in her honour, she sat next to Meryl Streep, who she considers a great friend, (\"She really looked after me. She would turn around to people who were bothering me and say, 'She's eating, do you mind?'\"), and her other great friend, Julia Roberts.</p> <p>She gives the impression of knowing everyone. Tom Cruise? \"He's a darling guy. I think he's embraced, for him, other realities that work.\" Bill&#xa0;Clinton? \"Sure. He reminded me of a long walk we took on the beach when I was campaigning for <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_McGovern\" title=\"\">McGovern</a>.\" She smiles. \"He has complete command of being loved.\"</p> <p>She is loyal to her friends, she says; her agent is&#xa0;80 years old and has been with her since her 20s. He knows where \"all the money\" for the independent movies is, which is useful at her age,&#xa0;since she hasn't much hope of a blockbuster. She lives a relatively simple life, going to bed at 2am and up at 9am. \"I'm on Vegas time. I've been on Vegas time most of my life.\"</p> <p>We go into the kitchen and MacLaine opens a&#xa0;jar of peanut butter and starts spreading it on crackers. She butters a cracker for herself, and one for me; one for her, one for me. Then two for&#xa0;her and one for me. She will not relinquish the&#xa0;jar.</p> <p>She describes a scene in Downton, which she came up with herself and which <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0271501/\" title=\"\">Julian Fellowes</a> allowed her to keep in. It is her favourite scene in the series; MacLaine's character decides to serenade Maggie's with a rendition of <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgvDariuAN0\" title=\"\">Let Me Call You Sweetheart</a>. When the scene was explained to Maggie, the actress said to her American co-star, \"You know what I'm going to do, dear, I'm going to fall off the chair when you start singing.'\" MacLaine rolls her eyes. \"I said OK, whatever. Then Maggie said, 'No, I think I'll fall asleep.' But actually, what she did when I started singing was to go all cuddly and coy. And then I kiss her hand.\" Between these two old war horses, it was, says MacLaine, the sweetest moment in the world.</p> <p><strong>\u2022 </strong>Downton Abbey returns to ITV1 next month.<strong> </strong></p>",
  "<p>The heading on a national newspaper advert from a claims management company (CMC) \u2013 \"Mis-sold solar water heating?\" \u2013 is the latest move by an industry of more than 3,000 claims handling firms looking for the next new thing after hoovering up huge profits from payment protection insurance (PPI) mis-selling.</p> <p>The ad, from Cheshire-based Consumer Reclaim, continues: \"If you think you've been sold a Solar Hot Water Heating System by the exaggeration of its benefits, you could be entitled to claim back the full cost.\"</p> <p>Readers will remember that many high-selling-pressure firms were named and shamed here four or so years back for claiming far higher benefits from hot-water panels on a roof than were justified. And they charged consumers, who wanted to be \"green\", up to three times the fair cost of around \u00a34,500 per installation.</p> <p>Consumer Reclaim states it is \"currently handling claims\" against a number of companies, including Smart Energy (UK), Ultimate Energy, Simplee Solar, Solar Direct UK, Solar Home Energy, Solsave and Solarsol UK. They all sold systems, and have now gone bust.</p> <p>Guardian Money asked Consumer Reclaim, which is \"regulated by the Ministry of Justice in respect of claims management activities\" (registration number CRM23523), how anyone could sue a company that was dissolved or in liquidation and so has no funds, however good a case there might be for a payback for inappropriate selling.</p> <p>It has not responded to our inquries. But taking the \"30-second claim test\" on its website \u2013 it actually takes five seconds \u2013 showed that potential claimants need to have paid via a loan, probably with a credit card. Those who paid cash are told they have no case. Consumer Reclaim believes it can take action, on a \"no-win, no-fee\" basis, against banks and other lenders under Section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act, the legal framework for compensation if a holiday or other firm goes bust and you lose \u00a3100 or more.</p> <p>The large credit card companies we contacted say they have so far not seen or heard of any claims, although they concede that some in the credit industry may have. But they say Section 75 is more about a failure to deliver rather than over-pricing. One bank that did not wish to be quoted said: \"If we paid for all exaggerated prices, we would probably end up giving nearly everyone who ever had a home improvement their money back.\"</p> <p>The Ministry of Justice says claims handlers are generally regulated either for personal injury or financial product mis-selling work. There is no suggestion that credit card and other loan companies mis-sold solar panel products.</p> <p>The MoJ says firms can use their registration on adverts even if the activity promoted is not one covered by the registration.</p> <p>Consumer Reclaim is part of Consumer Reclaim Ltd, whose sole director is 51-year-old Roger Anthony Pritchard. According to Companies House records, Consumer Reclaim Ltd has failed to send in annual returns due on 12 May and is subject to a \"proposal to strike off\". This could cause difficulties for anyone who has a contract with them.</p> <p>Guardian Money found one other company offering redress for solar panel purchasers \u2013 Assist Reclaim \u2013 with a similar website. It has one director, again a Roger Anthony Pritchard, of Hale, Cheshire. In October 2006, the Financial Services Authority issued a notice against Stockport-based First Legal Services, where Pritchard was also a director. The watchdog cancelled its permission to deal in FSA-regulated activities. It said: \"The FSA is not satisfied that you are a fit and proper person, having regard to all the circumstances, including the need to ensure that your business is conducted soundly and properly.\" First Legal Services went into compulsory liquidation in 2009 after the Official Receiver intervened.</p> <p>Although there are 3,000 claims companies, a freedom of information request shows the MoJ has just 58 staff to manage claims companies, mainly agency or contract workers, an average of one person for each 52 firms.</p> <p>In the year to 31 March, 409 claims companies \u2013 about one in eight \u2013 were warned, suspended or had their registration cancelled, according to the MoJ annual report this month .</p> <p>Head of claims management regulation Kevin Rousell said: \"The mass mis-selling of payment protection insurance has seen a surge in the number of companies operating in the financial claims management sector. Poor practice is rife among some claims management companies, which are falling over each other to get claimants' business. To help tackle this we have set up a specialist team to root out the poor practices used by some companies presenting claims for mis-sold PPI. Our investigators are using effective enforcement to stop bad practice and improve the industry once and for all.\"</p> <p>He added: \"Other on-going tasks include working with regulators and industry bodies to clamp down on unsolicited text messaging, identifying businesses that take upfront fees and misleading marketing.\"</p> <p>Unsolicited texts sent to me include \"We have been trying to contact you regarding your accident, we now have details of how much you are due.\" Although the firm is unidentified, there was no attempt to contact me \u2013 and I have had no accident (other than bashing my thumb with a hammer). Another said: \"There is \u00a32,351.23 waiting in your name for the mis-selling of PPI on your loans and credit cards. To get this ASAP, reply PPi [sic] to this message NOW.\" As someone who campaigned against PPI in these pages, I can confidently say I have never taken it out.</p> <p>Hertfordshire-based independent financial adviser (IFA) Alan Lakey of Highclere Financial Services is glad to hear that the MoJ is getting tougher with PPI claims, but wishes the new zeal was extended to other financial claims.</p> <p>\"I don't want people to be mis-sold \u2013 the bad reputation affects IFAs who are innocent,\" he says. \"But in common with many other small advice firms, I've had nonsense letters from claims managers on behalf of clients who do not even know they are complaining. Some have been hoodwinked into giving a claims manager details of their IFA. The CMC then lists everything including the kitchen sink against me. I've been accused of mis-selling an Isa when it was a pension, and vice versa. I write back \u2013 this costs time and money \u2013 to say they can't accuse me of mis-selling or not advising properly or not discussing relative risk because they don't know.</p> <p>\"They then escalate it to the Financial Ombudsman Service, which currently costs me \u00a3500 a case after the first three a year (due to go up to 25 soon) but nothing for them, even though they can collect up to 30% of any compensation. I also have more expenses in dealing with the case in detail. I know of firms including big life companies would rather pay up \u00a31,000 to \u00a33,000 just to get rid of the aggravation; in some cases their professional liability insurers tell them to do this as it's cheaper. It's true. These phoney claims cost me around \u00a32,500 on average if you count my own time.\"</p> <p>The ombudsman service says it has seen some inquiries about solar panels but has yet to give a formal ruling.</p> <p>It adds: \"Consumers can come to the ombudsman if they are unhappy with the results of a failed section 75 claim in relation to this subject. As we discussed, it's not black and white (it rarely is) but that's where we step in anyway.</p> <p>\"Consumers don't need to use claims managers to bring a complaint about section 75 \u2013 or any financial product. We will ask the consumer to explain what has gone wrong in their own words. You don't need to be a financial expert to use the service.\"</p>",

  "<p>Lilly MacGlashan is two years, seven months old. Her parents count the months as others might not, because each is precious additional time, bought at high cost. She was diagnosed soon after birth with neuroblastoma, the cancer that causes more children's deaths than anything other than tragic accidents.</p> <p>Her father, John, has nothing but praise for the early treatment she had from the NHS. She had chemotherapy to shrink the large tumour in her abdomen on her adrenal gland, followed by surgery to remove it. Addenbrooke's hospital in Cambridge gave her the all-clear in June 2010. Then, unusually in such a young child, she had a sudden and violent relapse the following month.</p> <p>\"She was covered with tumours \u2013 all over her brain and spine,\" he said. \"We had a fabulous oncologist at the time. She attacked it aggressively with high-dose chemotherapy and stem cells taken and put back into her body. She had that and reacted fabulously.</p> <p>\"Then they took us into a room and said that's all we can do. It will come back within two months to two years. Take her home and take some pictures and enjoy her while you can.\"</p> <p>The MacGlashans are not the only parents to have had that devastating advice. Neuroblastoma, a relatively rare cancer that develops from nerve tissue in about 100 small children a year, is usually not found until it has spread. In those children with advanced cancers, deemed the high-risk group, only 30% survive for five years after diagnosis.</p> <p>The treatment these children have on the NHS is good, but for those who relapse the only option is a clinical trial for which not all are eligible. Neuroblastoma sits on the faultline of what the NHS is able to do and is willing to pay for \u2013 but the debate is much more difficult, because unlike other terminal cancers, the lives it shortens and takes are those of young children.</p> <p>The MacGlashans, from Dunstable, Bedfordshire, reacted as most parents do. They were not prepared to accept the verdict that nothing more could be done and started raising money to pay for treatment abroad. With the help of their NHS oncologist, the couple found the only place in the world offering treatment for children whose neuroblastoma has relapsed and spread across the blood/brain barrier. They took Lilly to the celebrated <a href=\"http://www.mskcc.org/\" title=\"\">Memorial Sloan-Kettering</a> cancer centre in New York.</p> <p>Lilly has had pioneering immunotherapy there \u2013 given antibodies that attach to the neuroblastoma cells and activate the child's immune system to attack and kill the tumour. The results have so far been remarkable. There is no sign of the cancer, although dark patches on brain scans caused by past haemorrhages may hide cells. It had invaded her eye, but her sight is back to normal. The only sign of Lilly's illness is that radiotherapy has left her smaller than her healthy twin sister, Molly.</p> <p>The strain on the family has been enormous. Lilly has just gone back to New York for another set of the regular scans she must have, which cost $59,000 (\u00a337,000), before flights and other costs. So far, her treatment has cost \u00a3610,000, raised from family, friends and public appeals.</p> <p>\"It's just part of my life now,\" said John MacGlashan, an electrician who took a year's unpaid leave while his wife, Dawn, stopped work as a hairdresser to raise money and take Lilly to New York. \"All I think about is getting the money to get her over to America to get the next set of scans, which they won't do in the UK. New York is one of the most expensive places I have ever lived in \u2013 it costs up to $5 for a loaf of bread. We spent nine months there last year and three months so far this year.\"</p> <p>So far they have raised \u00a3250,000 and he is touched by the events people have organised to help. \"Such generosity,\" he said. \"People knock the British public but they are amazing.\" But worrying every day about money, he says, is \"a massive strain, it's awful\".</p> <p>Lilly has done fantastically well so far, he says. He was heartened by meeting children who had survived for nine and even 11 years, on a fundraising walk in Central Park. \"Some kids are surviving who can't get it out of their body but the drugs are keeping them going and they go to school and have full lives. The worst thing in this country is that they will not accept that. I'm not knocking the NHS. They have the best chemotherapy for neuroblastoma and they get the kids to a terrific position. But I'm disgusted with the way they won't help [after relapse]. They could give money to the primary care trusts and funding for children to go abroad.\"</p> <p>At Sloan-Kettering, he says, there are children from Greece, Italy, France, Spain and Norway who are fully funded by their governments.</p> <p>Immunotherapy is promising. Britain is participating in the European <a href=\"https://www.siopen-r-net.org/\" title=\"\">Siopen trial</a>, which some relapsed children are eligible to join. It compares a combination of a monoclonal antibody called Ch14.18 and a cytokine (molecules that stimulate the immune system) against antibody alone.</p> <p>But the <a href=\"http://www.childrenscancer.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Neuroblastoma Alliance</a>, which supports families such as the MacGlashans to raise money for treatment abroad, points out that a trial in the US, <a href=\"http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa0911123\" title=\"\">published by the eminent New England Journal of Medicine</a>, has already shown that using the antibody together with two other cytokines cuts deaths by 25%. US children now receive all three drugs. \"Parents say if there is published research that says three drugs work, I want my child to have three \u2013 not just one,\" said its chief executive, Alison Moy.</p> <p>The parents of one child who was enrolled in the trial and was then randomly assigned just one drug took the extreme step of going to court. Last year, the high court judge Mr Justice Ryder ruled that it would be in the best interests of the girl to have both drugs. When their NHS trust still refused to guarantee to provide both drugs, the family went to the US.</p> <p>The MacGlashans' MP, Andrew Selous, last month in the Commons questioned the ethics of the European trial for not ensuring all the children taking part get at least the best existing treatment. \"At the moment, there are too few options available for high-risk neuroblastoma children who fail to achieve a lasting remission after frontline treatment,\" he said in a Commons question to the health minister, Paul Burstow.</p> <p>\"In the UK, parents see a system that gives up on their children too soon while there should still be hope. Much higher numbers of children are surviving for much longer with the American treatment, and some are achieving permanent remission following treatment at the Memorial Sloan-Kettering cancer centre in New York. We need to make sure that level of expertise is available here in the United Kingdom.\"</p> <p>But the government's cancer director, Prof Sir Mike Richards, says he is still not confident the US treatment, with two extra cytokines, is of benefit and not harmful. The European clinical trial was intended to help answer that question. That, he said, is \"why, frankly, we can't recommend patients to go abroad\". The drug combination had not been licensed in the US, he said. \"No authority would want to be denying children a treatment unless they had good reason.\"</p> <p>Other families are led into desperate measures, heading with their children for clinics abroad offering treatments for which there is far less evidence.</p> <p>In June, seven-year-old Olivia Downie from Fraserburgh, Aberdeenshire, travelled to a clinic in Tijuana, Mexico. She was gravely ill and her mother, Lauren, says she hoped only to relieve her pain which even morphine could not control. But the treatment \u2013 sono-photodynamic therapy \u2013 did nothing to help her. She got much worse and an ambulance was called. Olivia was put on a life-support machine and transferred to a private Mexican hospital. Her parents were forced to appeal for money to fly her home in an air ambulance. Their pleas for her to be brought home to die touched many people and more than \u00a3150,000 was donated. Olivia died within 48 hours of her return.</p> <p>Lauren said the NHS did all it could for Olivia but the options ran out. She feels too little money is going to research into a devastating disease. \"People are having to make random stabs in the dark to try to prolong their children's life or quality of life,\" she said. She now deeply regrets travelling to Mexico.</p> <p>David Longman understands why parents go to extreme lengths. He did it in 2004, when his daughter Louise, 19, had a vascular tumour. The NHS said the only answer was amputation of her arm or radiation which would render it useless. Longman took Louise to a Russian clinic for what was advertised as photodynamic therapy \u2013 the use of a drug which, when activated by light, would kill cancer cells.</p> <p>\"She went to Russia for treatment. It had no effect whatsoever. If anything, the tumour grew,\" said Longman. \"I couldn't afford the \u00a330,000 so did a deal with ITN. We went on TV and said it was a miracle. The trouble is that if someone wears a white coat and says they are going to do their best for us, we believe them, even if they fail.</p> <p>\"The sadness is that there are properly regulated, organised clinics outside the UK, but if you find them advertising on the web offering to do miraculous things that nobody else in the UK believes are possible, you have to question it.</p> <p>\"We're not talking about Sloan-Kettering in the US. I have yet to hear of anybody who has come back from Mexico who is fixed and yet to find anybody who has been to China and who has said I have got rid of my tumour \u2013 it has gone. There may be the odd one who comes back fixed but there is no guarantee that it was the treatment that fixed them.\"</p> <p>PDT \u2013 photodynamic therapy \u2013 in fact was the answer for Louise, but not in Russia. Longman tracked down the leading experts in Britain and persuaded one of them to treat Louise. PDT is approved by the <a href=\"http://www.nice.org.uk/\" title=\"\">National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (Nice)</a> for use in some cancers, such as skin and lung cancer, where it is possible to get light from a laser to within 1cm of the tumour.</p> <p>While the Russian doctor had merely shone light on the skin, doctors pioneering the treatment in Britain were able to put optical fibres into the arm to activate the light-sensitive drug. Louise was cured and Longman started a charity called <a href=\"http://www.killingcancer.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Killing Cancer</a> to campaign for more recognition and funding for PDT in recognised centres in Britain.</p> <p>Neuroblastoma is not susceptible to PDT, because the cancer cells hide and invade parts of the body that light cannot reach. Clinics in Mexico and China are offering what they claim is an advance \u2013 sono-photodynamic therapy, or SPDT. They sell it as a natural, non-invasive therapy, using non-toxic light-sensitive substances such as chlorophyll which \"explode\" with oxygen, killing the cancer cells when activated not only by light but also by ultrasound waves which, they say, can reach every part of the body.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.yorkshirelasercentre.org/\" title=\"\">Prof Keyvan Moghissi</a>, one of the UK's foremost experts on PDT, says there is no good evidence for SPDT. \"In my opinion, SPDT is not a clinical reality,\" said Moghissi, a heart and lung surgeon who was involved in the earliest clinical trials of PDT and edits the leading journal in the field.</p> <p>Moghissi, who founded the Yorkshire Laser Centre which provides PDT for the NHS, says some basic research has been done on SPDT, but \"for doing it in humans, I believe there is no place for it. I believe there is a lot of laboratory work to be done.\"</p> <p>Mohgissi says nobody should be prevented from getting the treatment they want \u2013 \"thank God we live in a country where there is a choice,\" he says. But good information is key.</p> <p>\"Before spending money, before going abroad, people should have consultations with people in this country. Their GP should send them to people who are knowledgeable.\" Sometimes hospital consultants are also not as helpful to families as they could be in telling them there is no more that they can do for a child, he added. \"They should say, let me help you, understanding that when you have a child suffering you are very vulnerable.\"</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.dundee.ac.uk/dermatology/photo/staff/HM.html\" title=\"\">Prof Harry Moseley of Dundee University</a>, who runs a unit offering PDT at Ninewells Hospital &amp; Medical School, co-wrote a <a href=\"http://ict.sagepub.com/content/9/4/317.full.pdf+html\" title=\"\">etter to the journal Integrative Cancer Therapies</a>, which published accounts of three patients with advanced breast cancer who were given SPDT. He questioned the conduct and ethics of the trial, which is cited by clinics offering SPDT as evidence that it works. \"We could not find sufficient grounds to support the use of this technique for treatment of cancer,\" he said.</p> <p>A Hunstanton charity has supported families who want to try SPDT in Mexico, including the Downies. It was also involved subsequently in the appeal for money to bring her home. \"There is evidence that it works,\" says Linza Corp, who runs Families Against Neuroblastoma (FAN). \"It is a very inexpensive, non-invasive therapy. Unfortunately not many people have gone through it, so we have got little evidence. But there are a couple of children we are supporting and although they are still very, very poorly, they are still here.\"</p> <p>She cites the case of Connah Broom, an 11-year-old boy with neuroblastoma who went to Mexico for PDT and whose secondary tumours \u2013 but not the original one in his abdomen \u2013 are said to have gone. His GP, Dr Eamonn Jessup from Prestatyn Central Surgery, has said that although there has been remarkable improvement, he cannot be sure what caused it. \"Whether it is the health regime they are following for Connah, whether it is the treatments they are following, I don't know,\" <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-north-east-wales-15974631\" title=\"\">he told the BBC</a> last December. \"It is right that as scientists, which is what doctors are, we have to be sceptical about new treatments.\"</p> <p>The downside to the publicity that resulted in funds to bring Olivia Downie home, Corp said, \"is that people are going to think perhaps it doesn't work. The reality of that is that Olivia was dying before she ever set foot on the plane. We knew that.\"</p> <p>It would have taken a miracle for Olivia to get better, she said, but added that \"there was hope\" because the Mexican clinic was willing to accept her for treatment. \"We are not a medical panel. We are a charity that facilitates a parent's choice.\"</p> <p>Corp's own son, Max, died from neuroblastoma while she was trying to organise treatment for him in New York. \"When a child is dying in your arms you will do everything to try and save them,\" she said.</p> <p>She took him for a brain scan while he was in a coma because she needed to have him certified fit to fly. \"The result of that MRI scan showed he had something like 22 tumours within his brain and spinal cord and that there was no way in the world now that he could be saved and I must have spent half an hour shouting \"just sign the fucking form\", because I thought it doesn't matter to you \u2013 just let me do this. I'm his mum - I want to do this.\"</p> <p>Corp also cites Bobby Wright as a survivor of neuroblastoma, supposedly as a result of an organic diet and supplements (following conventional treatment). FAN's website recommends a consultation with the organisation set up by Bobby's father, Kevin Wright, called Kids Integrated Cancer Therapy, \"as early in treatment as possible\". Wright, however, has been charged with nine counts of fraud and 11 of theft, mostly relating to donations for his son's treatment, and will appear at Nottingham crown court in the autumn.</p> <p>David Longman, of Killing Cancer, says the government should be helping parents navigate their way around the claims made by clinics abroad. \"What I find completely odious is that the Department of Health will give us no guidance whatsoever,\" he said. The Foreign Office gives advice to travellers about potential hazards abroad, so why shouldn't the Department of Health do something similar? he asks.</p> <p>Cancer Research UK does attempt to give general advice. \"Treatment in hospitals in the UK is evidence based. We would recommend that people are extremely cautious about accepting any treatment that has not been through rigorous clinical trials that demonstrate its safety and effectiveness,\" said Martin Ledwick, the organistation's head information nurse</p>",

  "<p>As a child I was riveted by other people's mothers: their air of being possessed \u2013 perhaps even imprisoned \u2013 by their lives constituted a kind of two-way mirror through which I could see them without, it seemed, being seen myself. I lacked this facility with my own mother: not only could I not truly see her, or see her whole, but she seemed to know things about me that I was not aware of having made public. At home the struggle to establish and defend the boundary of self was interior, whereas with other people's mothers everything was accomplished by a mutual reading of surfaces which, if occasionally awkward, offered much more in the way of entertainment. One could lie, for instance, without appearing to be found out; but most of all one could view in safety the maternal persona itself, which more than any other was exposed by the forms it took, so that it seemed there was nothing you couldn't find out about someone else's mother simply by looking. She expressed herself in everything, from the food on the table to the washing on the line, was intimately revealed in every room of the house, a creature entirely given over to outward impressions both sensory and actual \u2013 a person, in fact, with no privacy. While staying at a schoolfriend's house I was taken as a matter of course to view the marital bed, and was solemnly shown, as well as the items on her mother's dressing table and the contents of her underwear drawer, a tennis ball attached to a length of rope which lay beneath her mother's pillow. She wore it, it was explained to me, around her neck at night, in order to prevent her from disturbing her husband by lying on her back and snoring.</p> <p>If there are two distinct kinds of mother \u2013 other people's and one's own \u2013 then this is a distinction reflected at the core of human nature, between ourselves as objective and subjective beings. Objectivity is the goal of civilisation, an aspiration rooted in the struggle to be objective about oneself. Psychoanalysis might be seen as the attempt to abridge this process, but for most people it is by the slow and iterative business of living that they approach a more dispassionate standpoint. A woman stuck at home with small children might for the first time be able to see that fierce deity, her mother, as a woman stuck at home with small children; but she is still some way from transposing a difficult mother into something that doesn't define or threaten the parameters of her own conduct. One can be a difficult mother and have a difficult mother, both at the same time: certain artists have the gift of clear sightedness in that particular hall of mirrors, but generally it's a question of trying not to repeat what was done to you while never quite knowing what it is you're meant to be&#xa0;doing.</p> <p>Retrospect is no guide, despite the soft-psychoanalytic suggestion that one can become a better person by understanding the ways in which one was wronged. And as Terri Apter demonstrates in <em>Difficult Mothers</em>, the impulse to attain greater objectivity about formative experience can simply result in more entrenched subjectivity. In her introduction, Apter mentions a female friend and colleague who warned her against writing her book for precisely this reason. Mothers are blamed for everything, the friend says, and thus their perspective is dispensed with. Once a difficult mother becomes \"difficult mothers\" \u2013 once the particular problem is permitted to become generic \u2013 the two-way mirror is shattered and the battle for a more objective glimpse of our genesis is lost.</p> <p>\"It comes without warning. I turn my gaze out my office window, anticipating one of those exquisitely private moments when memories and long-term musings sweep away the deliberations of the day. Instead, I suddenly chill to memories of my mother's angry breath and feel its rhythm in my own heartbeat.\" These are Apter's opening lines: with their telling reliance on uncorroborated thought-scapes and physical symptoms, they demonstrate the reverse procedure of subjective \"truth\", whereby the personal does not become the universal but rather its opposite, forced to retreat to within its own strict boundary, the body.</p> <p>Nonetheless, I left <em>Difficult Mothers</em> lying around the house, in case my children should be interested. It assigns mothers into categories \u2013 controlling, narcissistic, envious, unavailable \u2013 from which one feels somewhat forced to choose, though presumably as in the ice-cream parlour there's no law against having more than one kind at once. Afterwards one is invited to ask the question \"Am I a difficult mother?\", so perhaps it's best not to over-indulge. I found my thoughts straying to Oedipus, who was far from rehabilitated by such lines of enquiry. Indeed, it might be that in discovering one's parents to be mere humans, and one's sufferings, ambitions and darkest drives to have been generated by people not wicked but just hapless or hopeless \u2013 themselves the children of Larkin's fools in old style hats and coats \u2013 one loses something in the way of self-importance and belief and becomes, like Oedipus, someone of no fixed purpose or abode. The great <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alice_Miller_%28psychologist%29\" title=\"\">Alice Miller</a> took a hard line on such circular thinking: don't start feeling sorry for the grown-ups, she said. After Freud and Winnicott and Klein, she recognised that in the great mapping out of childhood reality there had to be a boundary somewhere.</p> <p>Apter is one of many writers drawn to that new country, busily extracting and disseminating simplified versions of its precepts. She herself may not be ignorant, but she presumes ignorance in her readers, and is occasionally guilty of claiming that she has charted virgin psychoanalytic territory. \"Instead of 'good' versus 'bad' mother,\" she writes as an instance, \"I use the term 'good-enough' mother\"; not exactly taking credit for <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Winnicott\" title=\"\">Winnicott</a>'s famous phrase, but not attributing it to its author either. One might define a difficult mother as one who substitutes personal for actual truth, who interposes her own reality in a way that blocks or interferes with the child's view of \"reality\" itself. With her personalising of what were intended to be universal tools of self-knowledge, Apter oddly exhibits a version of such characteristics. In a writer such strategies are not exactly bad, but they're probably not good enough.</p> <p>\u2022 Rachel Cusk's <em>Aftermath</em> is published by Faber.</p>",
  "<p>Summers and childhood are&#xa0;inextricably linked, and&#xa0;yet children, compared with their grandparents, or&#xa0;anyone much over 60, feel&#xa0;only a slight sense of loss at the season's end. Children's fiction always made a great deal of it, of course: the putting away of the shrimping net (\"Till&#xa0;next year, Susan\") and the catching of the steam train home (\"Bye-bye seaside, thought Johnny\") prompted speech bubbles at their most forlorn. But perhaps because I lived permanently by the sea, and yet never owned a shrimping net, their impact was less than it should have been.</p> <p>Searching for a memory that does justice to a child's sense of a summer's ending, I think of a late-August evening in the 1950s. I am standing at the rail of&#xa0;a&#xa0;Clyde steamer next to two men who&#xa0;are scanning the river for its shipping interest. The days are noticeably shortening. Far across the&#xa0;firth, a ship like our own detaches itself from a pier and heads into a setting&#xa0;sun. \"That'll be the Talisman making her last run of the day,\" says one&#xa0;of the men at the rail beside me,&#xa0;and&#xa0;somehow the scene and the&#xa0;statement combine to form an atmosphere of melancholy conclusion.</p> <p>But loss? That might be the wrong word. These were scenes that would come round again next year and every other year, supposing you wanted to spend your holidays in this part of the&#xa0;world and nowhere else, and you could persuade your parents to take you&#xa0;again to your Greenock aunt's. The&#xa0;sadness came from the imminent return to school rather than any foreboding about leaf fall, dwindling light and increasing cold, all of which a&#xa0;12-year-old barely noticed.</p> <p>The 20-year-old self barely noticed them either, or the 30-year-old, the 40-year-old or the 50-year-old. Rather like the man in the old insurance ad, blithe about his job's lack of a pension aged 25 and anguished by it aged 55, until a certain age the progression of the seasons meant little outside a change of clothes and lighting-up times. This was especially true of city dwellers. There were even some of us, anxious to be back to work with our children in school, who thanked God that summer was over.</p> <p>What fools we must have been, to have seen the four seasons as nothing more than a piece by Vivaldi or a kind of&#xa0;pizza when what their passing marks is the milestones to our own. Then comes the moment of realisation. Life is&#xa0;short: <em>timor mortis conturbat me</em> (fear of death disturbs me) and so forth. Or&#xa0;if&#xa0;not that fear put so starkly, then some&#xa0;dilute version of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2007/sep/12/greatinterviews\" title=\"\">Dennis Potter delighting in \"the blossomest blossom</a>\" in the last days of his life, or the 90-year-old Diana Athill debating the chances of her living to see the garden plant that she has just planted flourish and grow. A dilute version because you aren't 90 or, touch wood, in the final stages of a terminal disease; but the inkling is there and swelling in your consciousness. Commonplaces that went previously unregarded \u2014 birdsong, kindness, sunshine \u2013 become vivid, as&#xa0;though you were on a kind of drug. \"What sort of bird is that? What tree? I&#xa0;hope that David Mitchell is as nice as he looks.\"</p> <p>As for the seasons, tumbling on, can there be any doubt about the most pleasurable and looked forward to? Not everywhere \u2013 a north Indian winter is much preferable to its summer \u2013 but in Britain everything points to the months between May and September. Hopes of&#xa0;fine weather are regularly dashed, especially in western Scotland, from where I now write, but even under cloud&#xa0;the sea has a silver radiance and&#xa0;nightfall in June comes after the 10&#xa0;O'Clock News.</p> <p>There are moments of beauty: how else to call them? The other day, in a sunny interval between showers, my wife called me downstairs to have a&#xa0;look&#xa0;through a back door we rarely open in a basement room we rarely use. She was doing the ironing to the sound of John McCormack singing Plaisir d'Amour, having found an old tape of the Irish tenor and inserted it into an abandoned cassette player. Outside, white hydrangeas, lilac fuchsia and red montbretia \u2013 all profuse in the west's warmish damp \u2013 dripped and shone. Beyond the garden in the gap between the houses on the shore road, a stretch of the Clyde rippled blue. There was something undeniably sentimental about all this \u2013 McCormack's voice as captured in a 1920s recording studio would add plangency to an earthquake \u2013 but it hadn't been contrived. It was memorable \u2013 one more thing to remember this summer by.</p> <p>Returning to the same place every year means that our activities take on the aspect of rituals that have to be ticked off as they occur. Have we been swimming in the sea? Yes, three times so far, the last on a lovely evening when&#xa0;the water was like glass and warm&#xa0;enough to keep you in for half an&#xa0;hour. Have we had a beach fire? Yes,&#xa0;but only once and with square sausage in place of&#xa0;hamburger. Did we go to the Highland Games? Certainly, and saw a man slip and hurt himself tossing the caber. Have we cycled? Often. Have we been out in the boat? Not often enough.</p> <p>Only a few rituals remain. The boat needs to be stored for the winter, the&#xa0;fuchsia show wants visiting, a&#xa0;neighbour must be asked to tea. But&#xa0;before these minor perennials comes a&#xa0;major one. Early this afternoon,&#xa0;all being well, we will sail on&#xa0;the paddle steamer Waverley to another island in the firth, Cumbrae, and there hire bikes&#xa0;and pedal round the&#xa0;coast road until we get back to where we started, visiting on&#xa0;the way a&#xa0;fine old aquarium and a&#xa0;dreadful cafe where they won't give you a glass of&#xa0;tapwater unless you order lunch (a&#xa0;doughnut won't do). Then, back again&#xa0;at Millport pier, we'll watch the Waverley return from Arran. This is its last call of the season.</p> <p>A piper or even a pipe band may salute the ship's departure; there&#xa0;will be hooting on the steam whistle and some cheering. Older people will remember when such&#xa0;sights were everyday: steamers coming and going, crowds on the pier, families spread out across the beach or&#xa0;huddling with their ice-creams under&#xa0;plastic macs. In this part of the&#xa0;world, it gives summer's ending an&#xa0;extra elegiac quality: summer may be&#xa0;ending now climatically, but as a glorious holiday time it ended nearly 50&#xa0;years ago.</p> <p>Sailing home again, we'll have a&#xa0;drink&#xa0;from the bar and perhaps raise a&#xa0;toast. To next summer, to us! To the&#xa0;blossomest blossom and the fuchsiest fuchsia and the steamiest steamer; to all good things now ebbing&#xa0;away.</p>",
  "<p>Dozens of families are clashing with the NHS over its refusal to fund treatments for a devastating children's cancer that are not available in Britain.</p> <p>At least 45 families with a child suffering from neuroblastoma, the biggest child killer after accidents, have public fundraising appeals under way. Many want to go to the United States, where a three-drug treatment is available that was shown in a trial published in a leading medical journal to cut deaths by 25%. But European regulators are still assessing the efficacy of the drugs.</p> <p>The government's cancer tsar, Prof Sir Mike Richards, said it would be wrong for the NHS to recommend that patients travel abroad to receive the treatment. He acknowledged the considerable concern from very well-informed parents as well as from charities, an MP and a high court judge. But he added: \"I have to go with the advice from experts that I am given unless I think they have got it wrong.\"</p> <p>In Britain, some children with the disease, but not all, can join a European trial that will give them the key drug in the combination, a monoclonal antibody, either on its own or with one of the others.</p> <p>John Rogers, a physicist whose four-year-old daughter, Stella, is now in remission with no sign of cancer after treatment costing \u00a3210,000 in Philadelphia, said: \"None of the children are getting the treatment [in Britain] that is the best available treatment. They are using them as lab rats.\"</p> <p>Joining the trial is the only way children in Britain who have relapsed can get treatment on the NHS because the drugs are still experimental. Nice, the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence, often described as the NHS's rationing body, is not involved because it can only appraise and recommend proven, licensed drugs.</p> <p>Some families have been quietly advised by their NHS doctors to go to the US, Rogers claims. \"The doctors are in such a bad position from what's happened that they have shut the door and said if you can, you should go to the US. That's a terrible position for a doctor to be in,\" he said.</p> <p>Richards is advised by the country's leading experts involved in the European trial, including Dr Penelope Brock, the senior British expert who leads the collaboration running it.</p> <p>Richards said neuroblastoma was complex. While everyone was agreed that the <a href=\"http://www.nih.gov/news/health/sep2010/nci-29.htm\" title=\"\">antibody, known as Ch14.18</a>, was of benefit, it was uncertain whether the other drugs, called cytokines, were needed, given that they have side-effects.</p> <p>British doctors believe they are doing their best for the entire population of children with neuroblastoma by running a trial with strict criteria for entry designed to answer specific questions about the effectiveness and safety of giving an antibody and a cytokine to these children.</p> <p>But parents of children who are offered nothing are devastated when told there is nothing more that can be done.</p> <p>Others, who are offered a trial place, reason that their child has only one chance and want the full drug treatment that has been shown to work in the US. All of them know children in the UK who have died \u2013 it is a relatively small community where families share each others' harrowing experiences of trying and often failing to fight the cancer.</p> <p>Rogers is backed by the charity <a href=\"http://www.childrenscancer.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Neuroblastoma Alliance</a>, which helps parents to raise funds.</p> <p>Questions about the European trial were raised in parliament last month by <a href=\"http://www.andrewselous.org.uk/\" title=\"\">the Tory MP Andrew Selous</a>. The parents of one child assigned randomly in the trial to receive just the single drug in the UK went to the high court, where a judge ruled it was in her best interests to receive both drugs.</p> <p>Other parents, in desperation at coming to the end of their options in the UK, have travelled to Mexico, where clinics offer unproven treatments using sound waves to activate oxygen-releasing drugs.</p> <p>The Downie family from Aberdeenshire raised money to take their daughter Olivia to Tijuana, where she became so ill she had to be transferred to a medical hospital and put on a life-support machine. They were then forced to appeal again for money to bring her home in an air ambulance. She died 48 hours later.</p> <p>The government believes the NHS is doing all it should for the 100 children a year diagnosed with neuroblastoma. Richards cited the decision to send children for proton beam radiation therapy to the US at NHS expense: \"Where we have good evidence that treatments abroad which can't be delivered in this country would benefit children, we do pay.\"</p> <p>A second trial starting will allow children who are not currently eligible to be able to have antibody treatment without going abroad, but Richards said: \"There will still be the question of 'antibody plus' which is what the trial is designed to test. We are still in a state of equipoise amongst the clinical community about the benefits, which is why we believe the clinical trial is the best approach and why, frankly, we can't recommend patients to go abroad to get that treatment because we do not know that it is going to be of benefit to them and that the benefit will outweigh the harms.\"</p> <p>He added: \"As yet, I have heard no compelling case that tells me they have got this wrong. I'm always prepared to relook at the situation and that may be what we need to do but, at the same time, I have not been given the evidence that would make me think this is something we should be doing when the clinical experts are not saying that to me.\"</p> <p>He accepted that more could be done to try to explain the government's view to parents.</p> <p>and said he would be happy to meet the charity and the clinical experts.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 29 August 2012.

  "<p>As the diplomatic crisis over Julian Assange intensifies with mudslinging on both sides of the debate, Lisa Longstaff of Women Against Rape, which surprised many when it opposed the extradition of Assange this week, talks to playwright and author Bonnie Greer, who admits her exasperation with the WikiLeaks head. Oliver Laughland chairs.</p> <p><strong>Lisa Longstaff:</strong> We spend our lives trying to get men prosecuted for rape. We are driven by women who come to us who haven't got justice. The reaction we've gauged from people in our network is that Assange has been treated in a totally different way from every other accused rapist we've ever come across. It is very stark how Pinochet was treated in comparison to Assange. There was a similar request for extradition under [broader] accusations of mass torture, murder and rape, but he was given safety by Thatcher [see footnote]. We are aware of the context in which these particular accusations of sexual offences are being handled and we feel there are political motives behind the amount of resources that have been put into chasing down Assange. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/aug/23/women-against-rape-julian-assange\" title=\"\">For us it's not a contradiction [to object to his extradition]. </a></p> <p><strong>Bonnie Greer:</strong> Your organisation fights for bringing people who commit sexual violence to book and I support you 1000% because we are still in an age \u2013 and this is disgusting especially with our brothers on the left \u2013 where men question whether women have been raped at all. Aside from anything to do with Assange, it's that these women are being questioned at all. I grew up in a neighbourhood where rape was common, I've had it in my family, I know men and women who've been raped. I've gone with people to police stations where the cops were looking at them and thinking: \"Right so you went home with him didn't you, that's not rape, is it?\". I'm surprised that men I respect have suggested these women set Assange up. What it did for me as a woman was throw this centuries-old chasm between us and them again.</p> <p><strong>LL:</strong> Awful comments about rape are not a thing confined to the left. We come across people who are dismissive of rape all the time. The ones who really upset us are the ones who work in the law, the government \u2013 like Todd Akin [the republican candidate for the US senate seat of Missouri who <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/20/todd-akin-legitimate-rape-romney\" title=\"\">referred to \"legitimate rape\" earlier this week</a>]. We hear comments like George Galloway's all the time but I'm not going to defend people who are full of shit about rape, they are out of their box. Dinosaurs. But it doesn't alter my position that there are awful things going on in this case. I'm not in a&#xa0;position to know [if the allegations are true]. I haven't met [the accusers] \u2013 but I&#xa0;do know that people get set up for rape. There's a long history of it. I've seen rape used to undermine movements in many suspicious circumstances, it's an issue that gets thrown around. It's an issue that's close to people's hearts and it's so mishandled by the authorities. Assange should be questioned here. He hasn't even been charged yet.</p> <p><strong>BG:</strong> For me the law is the most important thing. Assange has exhausted every legal&#xa0;remedy that he has in this country, from top to bottom. People say there's something suspicious but I'm still looking for evidence.</p> <p><strong>LL:</strong> There is evidence. [Look at] the rendition of these two men, Ahmed Agisa and Mohamed Alziri [Egyptian asylum seekers who were deported from Sweden back to Egypt under the alleged influence of the US for terror allegations] back in 2001.</p> <p><strong>BG:</strong> I think he should go. Sweden exists under the rule of law, why would we just assume he's going to be hurt there?</p> <p><strong>LL:</strong> Because he's an enemy of the state of the most powerful government in the world, that's why.</p> <p><strong>BG:</strong> With the greatest of respect, I've read&#xa0;everybody who wants Assange to&#xa0;stay here, and every argument veers off into this \"it's alleged\" or \"apparently\". I'm the first person to stand up here and say the US is capable of anything and has done it too. But to hold up those two unfortunate men in comparison [is wrong]. The more Assange hangs out in that embassy and keeps this rolling on the more it becomes the Julian Assange roadshow. What we&#xa0;need to be focused on is WikiLeaks the organisation, and that young man [Bradley Manning] in the US who is going through hell. I want Assange to go back and clear this up, and then get back to work. This thing has become a&#xa0;circus; it's become gross and it's become overplayed.</p> <p><strong>LL:</strong> I don't see how you can extract Assange from that political pressure.</p> <p><strong>Oliver Laughland:</strong> Where do you think&#xa0;this supposed decline in popular support for Assange comes from?</p> <p><strong>LL:</strong> I think a lot of the circus and the media witch-hunt against Assange has been driven by journalists embedded with the US and British state. I think the media should take a step back. They should not just jump onto the issue without thinking about it. Our organisation is constantly trying to get the media to engage in supporting women's attempts to get justice, in tracking down rapists, in getting them imprisoned. But, they're not interested. What they are interested in is these salacious and sensationalist arguments. The most base instincts in people have been brought out.</p> <p><strong>BG:</strong> WikiLeaks has now become secondary to the saga that's swirling around. If it was my organsation for the sake of [Manning] and all the other people influenced by his work, I'd go [to Sweden] to take the light off me and let&#xa0;my organisation live. I'm still a upporter of WikiLeaks, but one of the things I was so excited about at the beginning was that kind of buccaneer, this incredibly smart guy, who went in the face of the biggest power on earth and just did a document dump of all the stuff we didn't know about. As a child of the 60s and the Vietnam war, I'm the first person to stand up and say: \"This is what we need.\" WikiLeaks and its work is bigger than the person.</p> <p><strong>LL:</strong> But the person is not dispensable. Assange did a great service to all of us to get that information out there, to really uncover some of the dirty secrets the US was hiding behind. It's such a double standard now. The debate has polarised. You think I'm just giving stock answers, but I think you're sitting on the fence.</p> <p><strong>BG:</strong> I don't think that the people who support Assange are wrong. I don't think it's about wrong or right. People feel very deeply about the situation now. I've yet to see people like Tariq Ali, who I have enormous respect for, give me an answer other than the stock one. I need more. We're at a turning point in history and if we don't get another answer \u2013 it's just not enough any more.</p> <p>\u2022 This footnote was appended on 27 August 2012. Lisa Longstaff has asked us to make clear that it was under Tony Blair's government, not Thatcher's, that Britain decided not to extradite Augusto Pinochet</p>",
  "<p>Humans used to have tails, but all that's left is a vestigial coccyx. American political conventions used to choose presidential candidates, but now they are televised coronations.</p> <p>The vestigial tail of the American political convention is the compilation and approval of the party's platform, a long document listing a rag-bag of policies that excite the party activists and is swiftly forgotten.</p> <p>Since platforms are not binding on party candidates, they are merely symbolic. They do however offer a window into a party's soul, a combination of wishlist, base stroking and vote-grabbing.</p> <p>For the Republican party, the 2012 platform debate isn't so much a vestigial tail as an appendix \u2013 not notes at the end of a book but a vermiform appendix, a dead-end tube. Like party platforms, the appendix's role is a mystery to most people: it may be a useful harbour for bacteria but can also rupture, causing pain and misery.</p> <p>For the Republicans compiling the party's 2012 platform, all was going well until the eruption caused by Missouri Senate candidate Todd Akin's remarks about \"legitimate rape\" magically avoiding the need for abortions. That put the spotlight on the party's platform on abortion, which boldly commits the party to backing a constitutional amendment granting full rights to an unborn child, outlawing abortion in all circumstances.</p> <p>The Romney campaign's position is more mild. Mitt Romney favours banning abortion other than a few exceptions, such as threatening the mother's health and for pregnancies resulting from rape.</p> <p>But that is nothing new, despite denunciations of the Republican platform being the most right-wing in the party's history. Go back to the 2004 platform for the convention that renominated George Bush, and you'll find almost identical language:</p> <blockquote> <p>[T]he unborn child has a fundamental individual right to life which cannot be infringed. We support a human life amendment to the Constitution and we endorse legislation to make it clear that the Fourteenth Amendment's protections apply to unborn children. Our purpose is to have legislative and judicial protection of that right against those who perform abortions.</p> </blockquote> <p>Compare that to the language being proposed for the Tampa convention next week:</p> <blockquote> <p>[W]e assert the sanctity of human life and affirm that the unborn child has a fundamental individual right to life which cannot be infringed. We support a human life amendment to the Constitution and endorse legislation to make clear that the Fourteenth Amendment's protections apply to unborn children.</p> </blockquote> <p>The difference this year is that the timing and profile of Akin's remarks drew attention to the implications of the platform clause. It moved senator Scott Brown, facing a tough battle in moderate Massachusetts, to complain to the RNC chairman: \"I believe this is a mistake because it fails to recognise the views of pro-choice Republicans like myself.\"</p> <p>The platform's language also includes a \"salute\" \u2013 tacit support and recognition \u2013 to states that impose additional restrictions on abortion, as well as backing the appointment of judges opposed to abortion.</p> <p>But there are several other provisions of the latest Republican platform being drafted that go beyond previous efforts.</p> <p>On immigration, despite a nod at a guest-worker programme, the GOP's stance is harsher than ever. Led by Kansas hardliner Kris Kobach, the platform is stuffed full of immigration fantasy: the construction of a giant wall along the US border with Mexico, mandatory use of electronic verification by private employers, no support for a path to citizenship, the blocking of funds to universities offering in-state tuition fees to the undocumented, and an end to federal lawsuits against controversial anti-immigrant legislation such as Arizona's SB1070 \u2013 a law in fact drafted by Kobach.</p> <p>And in a reminder of Mitt Romney's most bizarre immigration proposal during the primary season, the platform also backs \"self-deportation\" as a policy goal.</p> <p>The platform's role as a safe place to store bacteria can be seen in its likely adoption of a call to have annual audits of the Federal Reserve and the establishment of a \"gold commission,\" both sops to the Ron Paul \"goldbug\" faction within the party who harbour great hostility towards the Fed and dream of a return by the US dollar to the gold standard abandoned by Richard Nixon in 1972.</p> <p>On gay rights, there's a coded critique of the Obama administration's end of the \"don't ask, don't tell\" policy barring homosexuals from serving openly in the US military, calling for an end to \"the use of military as a platform for social experimentation\". Traditional GOP demands for support for the Defense of Marriage Act are included as well.</p> <p>At the end of all the posturing there was at least one policy detail that may be significant. That was the dropping of language supporting the tax deduction for home mortgage interest. The move was supported by the Romney campaign \u2013 which is keeping a close eye on the platform for danger signs \u2013 and so suggests that Romney himself may back abolishing the tax break.</p>",
  "<p>Under a blood-red sky in gentle Lancashire, a band of eager victims have come to experience Horror Camp Live, a gore-tastic camping night incongruously pitched at a working dairy farm near Blackburn, home of Mrs Dowson's Ice Cream. I have arrived late.</p> <p>A cocktail of medicines with which I am treating a stomach bug start to take haphazard effect on my body. \"I think I'm a bit high,\" I whisper to my companion, Emily.</p> <p>This does go some way to stilling the riptide of anxiety I've been feeling since reading the event's website, in particular the small print. \"You may be forcibly handled, bound, hooded, chained and subjected to simulated torture,\" it says. In addition to \"strong verbal and graphic visual sexual content\", I'm told to expect the use of \"total darkness, water spray and splash, crouch spaces and latex\".</p> <p>It sounds like 50 Shades of Guant\u00e1namo Bay. The website also has a convoluted back story about a cannibal neurosurgeon called Lockjaw which I don't understand at all, but it doesn't seem to have much bearing on the experience anyway.&#xa0;</p> <p>On arrival we find the Horror Camp team have helpfully pitched the guest tents around a huge campfire in the farm's large parkland. Beyond us in every direction roll the beautiful fields of Clayton-le-Dale. We briefly introduce ourselves, before moving into a dim shed for burgers and (very) local ice cream at 9pm. We also watch a horror film, Scarezone, which feels unnecessary \u2013 everyone really wants to get on with being terrorised by strangers in makeup.</p> <p>Scarezone's teen-American spunkiness is also ill-suited to the very British camp-ness of the night, which manifests itself in jokey transvestism and saucy innuendo, traded relentlessly by our grown-up scout guides Davey and Dawny.</p> <p>\"Are we in Skegness?\" Emily asks me early on. Eventually, however, as the night draws in, man-eating Lockjaw wrests control of our night from the adults in shorts, and the games begin.</p> <p>Far from the solitary nightmare I was expecting, the evening is a rambunctious, group-bonding jolly. Among the 30 horror fans here are a paranormal investigator and a couple celebrating their wedding anniversary. The female-weighted group immediately gets into the spirit.</p> <p>I had anticipated running scared through the woods, but we spend most of the night in the screening shed, where a virtual Lockjaw growls at us via a projector. He seems fixated less on sweet flesh than on setting up his own misguided Duke of Edinburgh scheme: we're sent striding around the farm with maps, and conga-lining through grimy tunnels.</p> <p>After each mission he rewards us with DVDs and Toffifee sweets. Proceedings veer close to a comedy night in a working men's club thanks to the quick wit and foul mouth of Dybuk, an \"old fortune-telling Irish Gypsy\" who harangues each team at length between their 20-minute excursions. I wince slightly at the \"Gypsy\" description, but leave political correctness at the door; she's a far more rounded and charming character than the other guides and ghouls.</p> <p>Emily, whom I have tricked into coming, is dressed inappropriately, tramping through cowpats in hotpants and ballet flats. She's quite angry with me, but I'm starting to really enjoy myself. There's a creepily beguiling doll who silently beckons us on masked dates. We visit a twisted surgeon in an outhouse who sounds like he has throat cancer. We're kidnapped, bundled into vans and driven to seances and Satanic masses, all the while singing The Farmer Wants A Wife. We happily eat insects. Around us, the cows low non-judgmentally. It's like a Halloween hen night, though for safety reasons the beers are restricted to two per person, and running is not allowed.</p> <p>Scare attractions are a growing trend in UK entertainment. Atmosfear, the entertainment group behind tonight's fun, will run a larger Halloween \"scream park\", a sort of Crystal Maze of terror, on the farm in October and November, with a larger cast of scare-actors and more zones of political incorrectness to navigate \u2013 Inbreeds Impound, Gaunt Hill Asylum \u2026</p> <p>The Horror Camp is a more intimate thrill, though sensation junkies might find insufficient threat here (aside from Dybuk's deliciously close-to-the-knuckle verbal abuse). Blindfolded in the back of a van, I listen with bemusement to the plaint of a female camper beside me: \"I was told I'd be hooded and bound. I'm not bound!\"</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395157235\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/pictures/2012/8/23/1345732911903/Face-to-face-with-canniba-008.jpg\" alt=\"Face-to-face with cannibal neurosurgeon Lockjaw\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Face-to-face with cannibal neurosurgeon Lockjaw</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The schlocky shenanigans \"end\" around 2.30am, and we retire to our canvas sanctuaries.

If that sounds like your bag, you know where to come.</p> <p>As I've failed to organise our travel with any degree of sense, bespattered Emily and I are ferried back to town the next morning by Mr Dowson, a farmer definitely not in want of a wife \u2013 her name adorns the signs around us.</p> <p>After all the monsters, it's nice to put a human face to Hawkshaw Farm. We talk about how falling milk prices impose a harsh choice on UK dairy farmers: branch out or shut up shop.</p> <p>\"For most, diversifying means getting a yoghurt counter,\" he says. \"We've tried to be a bit more creative.\"</p> <p>I listen to his gruesome ideas for how Horror Camp can go much, much further.

  "<p>The darkest chapter in Norway's recent history came to a close, as judges delivered a sentence that is likely to see Anders Behring Breivik spend the rest of his life in prison, before they read out harrowing accounts of the gun and bomb attacks he perpetrated last year.</p> <p>An Oslo court found that Breivik, whose twin assaults killed 77 people, was sane \u2013 the verdict that he and most Norwegians had wanted.</p> <p>The conclusion of Norway's most high-profile judicial case for decades provoked immediate calls for the country to engage in a more rounded and open debate on multiculturalism.</p> <p>Survivors and relatives welcomed the court's decision, saying they were now able to move on with their lives, 13 months after Breivik detonated a bomb in Oslo and embarked on a shooting rampage on Ut\u00f8ya island. More than half of those shot were teenagers.</p> <p>The 33-year-old, who had earlier admitted the attacks that traumatised the peaceful country, smirked as the court's verdict was delivered. He was given the maximum sentence of 21 years, but with a \"preventive detention\" clause that means his time in jail can be extended as long as he is deemed a threat to society. It is unlikely he will ever be released.</p> <p>In a final parting shot, clearly designed to offend, Breivik used his chance to address the court by apologising to \"militant nationalists\" across Europe, apparently for not killing more people during his two attacks.</p> <p>More than 60 relatives and survivors of the attacks nodded silently in the Oslo courtroom as the verdict was delivered by Judge Wenche Elisabeth Arntzen. Later they could be seen embracing one another. Most of the Norwegian public had hoped for a \"sanity\" verdict, eager that the killer should be made accountable for what they viewed as a political crime. Breivik sought the same outcome, believing it would legitimise the ideology that inspired his attacks.</p> <p>Away from the courthouse, a feeling of closure was soon evident throughout the nation. Bj\u00f8rn Kasper Ilaug, a rescue worker at Ut\u00f8ya, said: \"The verdict is positive toward a situation where we can start moving forward. That is very important. This has been a heavy burden for many people for 13 months.\"</p> <p>Breivik had targeted a summer camp of the youth wing of the country's ruling Labour party, which was taking place on the island. Another Ut\u00f8ya survivor, Frida Holm Skoglund, 20, said: \"I'm going to fully live the first day of the rest of my life.\" Skoglund had remained so shaken by her ordeal that, in May, she requested that Breivik leave the courtroom before she could deliver her witness testimony.</p> <p>Others described a sense of instant calm. Per Balch S\u00f8rensen, whose daughter was killed on Ut\u00f8ya, said: \"Now we can have peace and quiet. He doesn't mean anything to me. He is just air.\"</p> <p>Within moments of the verdict, lawyers for the victims were being inundated with celebratory emails. Mette Yvonne Larsen, who represented some of those affected, said: \"This is what we hoped for. I have already received many messages from clients telling me this is justice served and they are happy it's over and will never have to see him [Breivik] again.\"</p> <p>The killings induced a period of introspection for a nation of 5 million which had prided itself as a safe and stable society, and also raised questions about the prevalence of far-right views in a country where oil wealth has encouraged one of the fastest immigration rates in Europe.</p> <p>Many Norwegians believe their country must use the verdict as a platform to instigate an examination of the virtues or otherwise of mass immigration for its society.</p> <p>Breivik said that he had deliberately targeted those he felt encouraged multiculturalism, and that he wanted to overcome an \"invasion of Muslims\". Jo Stigen, professor at the department for public and international law at the University of Oslo, said: \"It was a political attack. Now we can focus on how to avoid this in the future.\"</p> <p>Mads Anden\u00e6s, a lawyer and professor at the university, who lost a student during Breivik's killing spree, said: \"Everybody is happy with this as the end of the process. Discussion about immigration and racism and how [Breivik's] attitude was possible to develop can now start.\"</p> <p>Chief among the issues to be explored will be how Breivik could emerge in a society with one of the lowest homicide rates in the world. Ut\u00f8ya survivor Eivind Rindal was among those who warned that Breivik's ideological, far-right discourse was far from unique. \"There are many who shared his extreme views in our society,\" she said. The judges agreed, noting that Breivik's anti-immigration views were shared by a nexus of like-minded individuals and disparate groups.</p> <p>However, they found no evidence that the Knights Templar, the modern-day crusader network that Breivik claimed to belong to, exists. The killer appeared to blush each time the organisation was mentioned during the court hearing.</p> <p>One aspect of the judgment was seemingly to make sure Breivik's actions were not forgotten, with the judges delivering a harrowing reminder of his attacks as they documented, over several hours, each of the gunshot and bomb-blast injuries suffered by those killed and the 242 wounded. The court heard some women were shot up to eight times, many cold-bloodedly with bullets to the head. As the details were described, Breivik could sometimes be seen frantically writing notes; at other times, he looked flustered.</p> <p>Legal experts said the detailing of his crimes was intended to provide a final, graphic reminder of his actions, should he ever appeal to be released.</p> <p>One of the judges, Arne Lyng, revealed that the 950kg fertiliser bomb Breivik detonated outside the government headquarters could have been significantly more devastating. \"It was pure luck that not many more were killed,\" he said.</p> <p>The killer refused to express remorse, arguing that his victims were brainwashed \"cultural Marxists\" whose political activism would adulterate pure Norwegian blood, and stating that he would commit his attacks again.</p> <p>The court's verdict signalled closure for Norway in another way: its finding of sanity means that Breivik will not appeal against his jail term. Geir Lippestad, his lawyer, was unequivocal: \"He told me he will accept this verdict.\"</p> <p>As the hearing continued, some felt the mood of the proceedings tangibly lift as it sank home that it might be Breivik's last public appearance.</p> <p>Ali Esbati, Swedish survivor on Ut\u00f8ya remarked that the courtoom did not feel as \"oppressive\" as it usually had throughout the 10-week trial.</p> <p>\"Many must feel that today marks a certain end to the process,\" he said.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 28 August 2012. The original referred to <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arne_Lyng\">Arne Lyng</a> and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ali_Esbati\">Ali Esbati</a> as \"she\" rather than \"he\".

  "<p>Greenpeace has signalled its determination to try to halt the Kremlin's march into the Arctic with activists led by its executive director boarding an oil platform belonging to state-owned Gazprom.</p> <p>It is the first time that the green group has taken \"direct action\" against the Russian drilling and comes amid alarming new evidence about the speed with which Arctic sea ice is melting.</p> <p>Six environmentalists in inflatable boats launched from Greenpeace's Arctic Sunrise ship approached the Prirazlomnaya rig 600 miles east of Murmansk and used mooring lines to climb the rig and attach a \"portaledge\" to the side of it.</p> <p>Kumi Naidoo, the executive director of the green group, unfurled a banner in Russian reading \"Save the Arctic!\" before the crew of the Russian platform attacked them with water hoses.</p> <p>\"Like Shell's reckless plans to drill in Alaska, it's not a question of if an oil spill will happen, but when. The only way to prevent a catastrophic oil spill happening in this unique environment is to permanently ban all drilling now,\" said Naidoo.</p> <p>Gazprom Neft Shelf, the Gazprom subsidiary that holds the licence for the field, said the Greenpeace activists were invited to come on board for a \"constructive dialogue\" but they declined. The campaigners later called off the protest.</p> <p>Russia has long had ambitions to produce lots of oil and gas from the Arctic and has recently signed Arctic agreements with western firms such as ExxonMobil to kickstart the campaign. The Prirazlomnaya \u2013 a steel structure, part of which was used previously to produce oil on the Hutton field in the UK North Sea \u2013 is an all-Russian pioneering venture that hopes to start producing hydrocarbons from next summer.</p> <p>Some of the estimated 526million barrels of oil in the field would be loaded on to tankers in the Arctic and carried back to Murmansk or perhaps direct to petroleum centres such as Rotterdam.</p> <p>Greenpeace, which has confronted other Arctic drillers such as Cairn Energy off Greenland and is trying to stop Shell working off Alaska, has put the far north at the centre of its current campaigning.</p> <p>It recently claimed that Gazprom's oil spill response plan for the platform had expired and says any drilling without a new plan in place would be illegal.</p> <p>But the Kremlin has recently announced plans to crack down on \"foreign\" non-governmental organisations and the court sentences against Pussy Riot female punk and protest band indicate Russia is in no mood for internal or outside criticism.</p>",
  "<p>With Syria's second city, Aleppo, consumed by violence, war has returned with a vengeance to its capital. But in Damascus, the regime, rather than rebel groups, is on the attack. The summer offensive that rebel leaders envisaged is, so far, not going to plan.</p> <p>Nationwide, the intensity of violence and number of dead and wounded is now at its highest level since the uprising began more than 18 months ago. Western officials, activists and rights groups estimate that close to 5,000 people have died during the past month alone. \"It was a good Ramadan for the regime,\" said one western official. \"If you can call 5,000 dead people good.\"</p> <p>In Aleppo, savage fighting along several front lines is claiming around 30-60 victims per day, including government soldiers. The city looks and feels abandoned. Most citizens who live in the rebel-held eastern half have either left, or have bunkered down in their homes, where few supplies are reaching them from regime-held areas to the south.</p> <p>Siege is crippling the opposition areas of the city. And a well-chronicled withering rain of shells from tanks and jets is wearing down both fighters and the few residents who have remained.</p> <p>As Aleppo has been burning, however, Damascus has also re-ignited, but with much less attention.</p> <p>The rebel insurrection in the capital, which struck fear into the heart of the regime from 18 July, with the killing of three security chiefs, was put down by loyalist forces around 10 days later, and does not at present appear to have lived up to expectations.</p> <p>The assault on the capital had led to large numbers of desertions and defections and sharply bolstered rebel morale in other areas of the country, especially in Aleppo where the charge was led by forces who had rapidly ousted loyalists from security bases in the hinterland.</p> <p>For the first time since the start of the uprising, the regime had appeared rattled. Its inner sanctum, watertight for four decades, started to creak and the number of defectors or deserters from Syria's 300,000-strong army is believed by Turkish and western observers to have topped 50,000.</p> <p>Since then attacks on rebel strongholds in Damascus have intensified and the opposition's capacity to counter them seems to have tapered off.</p> <p>\"We don't know what's going on in Damascus,\" said one rebel leader in Aleppo this week. \"All we know is that there's a big fight happening here.\"</p> <p>While rebel forces have shown more of an ability to co-ordinate operations \u2013 the summer offensive on the two leading cities is a case in point \u2013 they remain unable to make effective use of the officers who held command and control positions in the regime army and who have since sided with them.</p> <p>\"These officers cross the border into Turkey and then we don't see them again,\" said Sheikh Tawfiq Abu Sleiman, who commands a Free Syria Army unit in northern Aleppo. \"They never come back to the battlefield to join us. And even if they did, many people here would not accept them.\"</p> <p>Neither are defecting soldiers on the Aleppo battlefield being used as reinforcements. \"They go to Turkey,\" said Radwan Surmeidi, a rebel who had just received three regime defectors last weekend. \"They don't join us straight away. And maybe never.\"</p> <p>The rebel forces' inability to receive reinforcements is not helping them against a standing military that continues to outman and outgun them. Nor are new weapons coming their way, after the flush of guns and bombs taken in raids on regime depots abandoned by fleeing forces in late-July.</p> <p>A trickle of assault weapons and ammunition comes over the border from Turkey, with the help of Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Turkish intelligence officials. However, the heavy weapons that rebel leaders have been calling for, especially anti-aircraft guns, have not arrived.</p> <p>The few anti-aircraft guns that opposition forces do have in Aleppo are strapped to the back of utility trucks. And there has to be a good reason to fire them. On Monday, as a Syrian air force helicopter lumbered into range over the suburb of Saif al-Dawli, one such gun truck was driven out from under a shed into the middle of an intersection.</p> <p>The gunner strapped to a seat let fire with a short burst, and the truck then retreated. \"We don't have the ammunition to fire any more,\" he said. The helicopter banked to the east and flew away.</p> <p>In Damascus, the lack of weapons to combat tanks and jets is also seriously limiting the rebel campaign. Even more troubling for opposition supporters, though, is the intensity of the regime assault on areas that had not long ago been considered rebel strongholds.</p> <p>\"Everyone is being arrested, or killed,\" a resident of the Damascus suburb of Midan told the Guardian. \"There was a time when the regime made a distinction between residents and gunmen. Now they treat everyone as one and the same.\"</p> <p>At least three areas of Damascus endured their 10th consecutive day of heavy shelling on Friday. The town of Zabadani to the west of the city was pounded by artillery and tanks for a 12th straight day. Rights groups reported several dozen bodies on Damascus streets on Friday, all of which seemed to be the product of executions.</p> <p>\"Assad wants a battle in Damascus now,\" said Wissam Tarif from the global campaigning group, <a href=\"http://www.avaaz.org/en/\" title=\"\">Avaaz</a>. \"They know that the FSA has been storing weapons in Damascus. The level of provocation is intensive. It has been non-stop for the past nine days day and night. They are killing people at checkpoints. They want the FSA to overstretch themselves. They want to test their resolve. The borders from Lebanon are completely locked down now so all the reinforcements need to come from the north.</p> <p>\"They have opened two battles and they think they have the FSA's measure.\"</p> <p>With fighting also continuing to rage in Syria's other cities of Homs, Hama, Idlib and Deir Azzor, the Syrian army too would appear to be at risk of overstretch.</p> <p>However, Aleppo and Damascus remain the key battlegrounds for both sides.</p> <p>\"When we win Aleppo we will go to Damascus,\" claimed the rebel leader Sheikh Tawfiq. \"And if they lose Damascus they can't send anyone else to fight us here.\"</p>",
  "<p>As director of the communications consultancy <a href=\"http://www.brunswickgroup.com/contact/contact/brunswick-arts.aspx\" title=\"\">Brunswick Arts</a>, Helen Scott Lidgett, who has died aged 63 of ovarian cancer, was involved in such projects as launching the Baltic contemporary art centre in Gateshead, the <a href=\"http://www.vam.ac.uk/page/b/british-galleries/\" title=\"\">British Galleries</a> at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London, numerous British Council pavilions at the Venice Biennale and the French government's <a href=\"http://www.ambafrance-uk.org/Paris-Calling-Participating.html\" title=\"Paris Calling on the French Embassy website\">Paris Calling</a> initiative. For work on promoting French art in Britain under this scheme, in 2008 she was made a Chevalier de L'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres, and pinned the medal up on her bedroom wall, alongside her Brunswick card and pictures of her children.</p> <p>Helen was born in Golders Green, north London, to Bernard Finch, a doctor, and Patricia, a sculptor. Her parents, unconventional, non-practising Jews, sent her to the progressive King Alfred's school, but finding it too un-academic for the already studious Helen, soon moved her to Henrietta Barnett school.</p> <p>At St Martin's School of Art, she met her first husband, Duncan Scott Lidgett. They became stallholders in Camden Market, selling secondhand clothes and dresses designed and made by Helen using antique fabrics and lace she had collected \u2013 all her life she was an epic collector of fine things throughout her life). Focusing on the lace, They went on to open a successful wedding dress shop, Scott's, supplying Liberty and Selfridges.</p> <p>Endlessly energetic, in 1974 Helen was appointed head of art at Camden school for girls. The music-video director Sophie Muller and I were pupils there, and became lifelong friends of hers. In 1982, Helen and Scott divorced, but she continued to run the shop on her own, while working as a critic and arts writer for the London listings magazine Time Out, running an art gallery, The Boat House, on a vessel in Camden Lock, and bringing up two children.</p> <p>Eventually Helen sold Scott's, and in 1990 went to the art publishers Thames &amp; Hudson as head of publicity. At the firm's 50th anniversary party in 1999, Helen met a new face on the arts PR scene, Sarah Macaulay. The pair formed an enduring friendship, and Helen eventually joined Sarah's firm, Hobsbawm Macaulay. In 2001 Sarah, by then married to Gordon Brown, the Labour chancellor, retired from the business. But before doing so she and Helen set up an arts subsidiary at Brunswick. Alan Parker, its chief executive, recalled how \"the power of Helen's infectious enthusiasm combined with her special talent to see how things could fit together, the potential in everything\".</p> <p>In the runup to the 2010 general election, Helen took a sabbatical from Brunswick to advise Brown on his culture strategy. As an adamant supporter of the importance of arts education in schools and of free entry to museums and galleries, she was a natural fit. Obviously her \"special adviser to the PM\" card went up on the wall, too.</p> <p>Helen was irreverent while always well informed, relaxed yet authoritative, exacting yet never judgmental. She believed passionately that anyone could succeed if they got the right encouragement, and she made it her life's work to ensure that all those with whom she came into contact did. Generous-spirited and a fantastic laugh, Helen was my mentor, my confidante, the person with whom I felt most at ease \u2013 who else would have danced on Scott's shop counter with me to Get Down on It by Kool and the Gang?</p> <p>She is survived by her second husband, Johnny White, whom she married in 2002, and their son; and by the daughter and son from her first marriage.</p> <p>\u2022 Helen Scott Lidgett, public relations executive, born 26 November 1948; died 31 July 2012</p>",
  "<p>Having spent an intense nine days in the company of 14 European social entrepreneurs, I have seen at first hand the potential of young people to change the world.</p> <p>I was one of the judges for Ben &amp; Jerry's <a href=\"http://www.joinourcore.com/\" title=\"\">Join Our Core</a> competition, which included accompanying all the shortlisted candidates to Uganda to spend a week living with local farmers who supply the ice-cream maker with Fairtrade vanilla.</p> <p>The easiest option in business is to take the path of least resistance, which in our current culture is to maximise profits and remain blinkered to the consequences of our actions.</p> <p>It therefore takes determination and self-awareness to be able to create an enterprise that integrates doing good with doing well, or \u2013 on a deeper level \u2013 merging heart and mind.</p> <p>What we now see is that our past dualistic thinking has not served us well. Charity workers have tended to accuse business executives of being greedy and uncaring, while in turn, companies dismiss NGOs as do-gooders who are not prepared to face up to the real world.</p> <p>However, the sustainability challenges of our age demand we find new solutions, and this can come only from moving beyond judgements and name calling. Social entrepreneurs are showing us that a different future is possible.</p> <p>It would be wrong to try to put all social enterprises in the same box, as the competition judges soon found out, because each one sits in a different position along the spectrum between a charity and a traditional business.</p> <p>Catriona Maclay, who runs London's <a href=\"http://www.hackneypirates.org/\" title=\"\">Hackney Pirates</a>, gives disadvantaged children intensive one-to-one support in a playful environment. While she brings in some income from publications and renting out space, the enterprise relies largely on donations and volunteers.</p> <p>So too does Jakob Lund, the creator of <a href=\"http://play31.org/\" title=\"\">Play31</a>, who won the Danish category for his work in using the unifying power of football for promoting peace in Sierra Leone.</p> <p>Towards the other end of the spectrum is the irrepressible 23-year-old Fraser Doherty, creator of the <a href=\"http://shop.superjam.co.uk/\" title=\"\">SuperJam</a> brand in the UK, who outsources production to a major manufacturer and sells his products to large retailers. The social element is that he invests some of the profits in running hundreds of free tea parties for elderly people who live alone or in care homes.</p> <p>Doherty's latest venture, Super Honey, is much closer to most people's idea of a social enterprise, involving prison inmates making hives that are then managed by community beekeeping groups, who in turn involve local schoolchildren. This also gives a much needed boost to the declining bee population.</p> <p>Then there are those who are seeking to have an impact on millions, while others are focusing on transforming the lives of only a few.</p> <p>Through his organisation, <a href=\"http://www.mattecentrum.se/\" title=\"\">Mattecentrum</a>, Swedish winner Johan Wendt tutors free of charge around 70,000 young people in maths every month, and is now planning to expand to the UK.</p> <p>Veronica D'Souza moved to Kenya to promote <a href=\"http://www.ruby-cup.com/\" title=\"\">Ruby Cup</a>, a silicone menstrual cup that replaces the need for sanitary pads, which most girls in Africa cannot afford and as a result often drop out of school.</p> <p>Not only is she seeking to stop millions of women from using alternatives such as newspaper, cloth or mud, D'Souza also wants to raise awareness about menstrual hygiene and generate income for local entrepreneurs who sell the product.</p> <p>At the other end of the scale is Dutch award winner Peter den Hond, who has created <a href=\"http://www.fairmail.info/\" title=\"\">FairMail</a>, which allows marginalised teenagers in Peru and India to create greetings cards using their own photographs, with half the profit going to pay for their education plus support for their families. While he could spread the profits more thinly, he wants to radically change the lives of a few, and over the past four years, 33 teenagers and their families have benefited from \u20ac225,000.</p> <p>All the candidates express the desire to be of service and to make a real difference in the lives of others, but each one has their own story to tell. Some like Doherty and Jenny Dawson, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sustainable-business/tackling-food-waste-social-enterprise-model?intcmp=122\" title=\"\">founder of chutney and jam company Rubies in the Rubble</a>, have taken childhood passions and transformed them into profitable ventures.</p> <p>Others have taken traditional business models and given them an innovative twist. Wouter Durville from the Netherlands sells products and services such as water bottles and green energy on a buy one, give one basis. For example, if you buy health insurance, you also automatically insure an orphan in Tanzania.</p> <p>Like other businesses, these social enterprises have challenges they need to overcome. Ruby Cup still has to prove it is hygienic when used in areas where there is a lack of clean water, while ONEforONE needs to convince NGOs of the moral case for giving insurance to orphans, when it is the job of the state to provide healthcare.</p> <p>Many of them also need support in scaling up, which is why part of the prize is six months' free consulting from the social enterprise network Ashoka.</p> <p>Of course, while it's great to see European-based social enterprises flourishing, where innovation is desperately needed is in the developing world. Spending time in Uganda, the finalists saw first-hand the fine line between life and death and the disastrous consequences of economic, social and environmental failure.</p> <p>Africa is a classic case where traditional charity has largely failed to lift people out of grinding poverty and in many cases has led to a culture of dependency. On the other side of the equation, business is often rightly accused of exploiting the poor by buying agricultural products and raw materials on the cheap and then making huge profits from processing and branding them.</p> <p>Thankfully, the idea behind social enterprise is starting to gain a foothold, with NGOs and progressive businesses recognising they need to work together to create sustainable livelihoods.</p> <p>What all the finalists of the competition demonstrate is the importance of courage and leadership in addressing the inequalities and social injustice in our world. We have learned from experience that the answers are not going to come by waiting idly and hoping governments or institutions are going to come up with the answers.</p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by </strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/guardian-professional\" title=\"Guardian Professional\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

  "<p>Libyan militia members who fought to oust Muammar Gaddafi last year have been accused of murdering three sub-Saharan migrants at a camp they were guarding.</p> <p>The men allegedly shot the migrants dead at the camp in Homs, east of Tripoli, on Thursday while suppressing a protest over conditions there, according to Father Moses Zerai, an Eritrean Roman Catholic priest who runs a Rome agency assisting asylum seekers.</p> <p>\"On Thursday the women started a hunger strike over conditions and in reaction the soldiers beat and shot dead an Eritrean man, aged around 20,\" Zerai told the Guardian.</p> <p>\"The women started to yell, the guards then fired at their cells, at which point the men started shouting and the guards beat them and shot two,\" he said, adding that he had spoken to two people inside the camp and a third source in Tripoli.</p> <p>Another Eritrean man who was interned in Homs and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/23/asylum-seekers-libya?CMP=twt_fd\" title=\"\">described the plight of migrants to the Guardian</a>, had recently escaped from the camp and was now in Tripoli, Zerai said.</p> <p>Sub-Saharan migrants interned in Libya are often seeking to sail to Europe to request asylum.

  "<p><strong>(updated below - Update II [Sat.] - Update II [Sun.])</strong></p> <p>The New Statesman owes its readers a correction for a clear and crucial falsehood contained in <a href=\"http://www.newstatesman.com/blogs/david-allen-green/2012/08/five-legal-myths-about-assange-extradition\">this much-cited argument</a> by its legal correspondent, David Allen Green. As I <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/aug/22/julian-assange-media-contempt\">noted on Wednesday</a>, Green purported to debunk what he called \"common misconceptions\" and \"myths\" being spread by supporters of Ecuador's asylum decision in the Assange case, but in doing so, he propagated his own myth on <em>the key question</em> in this matter. By doing so, he misled large numbers of readers not only at the New Statesman but in many other venues which cited his claims. Regardless of one's views on the asylum matter, nobody should want clear errors on the central issues to be left standing in major media outlets.</p> <p>The falsehood here is clear and straightforward. One of the \"myths\" Green purported to debunk was that \"Sweden should guarantee that there be no extradition to USA.\" Assange's lawyers, along with Ecuadorean officials, have repeatedly told Sweden and Britain that Assange would immediately travel to Stockholm to face these allegations if some type of satisfactory assurance against extradition to the US could be given. This is the paramount issue because it shows that it is not Assange and Ecuadorean officials \u2013 but rather the Swedish and British governments \u2013 who are preventing the sex assault allegations from being fairly and legally resolved as they should be. </p> <p>But Green claimed that \"[i]t would not be legally possible for Swedish government to give any guarantee about a future extradition, and nor would it have any binding effect on the Swedish legal system in the event of a future extradition request.\" He said that this is so in part because \"any final word on an extradition would (quite properly) be with an independent Swedish court, and not the government giving the purported 'guarantee'.\" He then cited a British lawyer (notably, not a Swedish one) who <a href=\"http://www.firmmagazine.com/features/1179/Assange_-_what%27s_going_on%3F.html\">made the same claim</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"[I]t appears that if the extradition is contested as it would be in Assange's case then it is a matter for the court not the government to decide if he is extradited.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>This is completely and unquestionably false. It is simply untrue that it is Swedish courts, rather than the Swedish government, who are the final decision-makers in extradition requests. It is equally untrue that the Swedish government has no final decision-making power regarding extradition requests that are legally sanctioned by the Swedish judiciary. These are not matters for reasonable debate. The law is clear. Green's claim is false.</p> <p>Last night, international law professor <a href=\"http://www.law.unimelb.edu.au/melbourne-law-school/community/our-staff/staff-profile/username/Kevin%20Jon%20Heller\">Kevin Jon Heller at Melbourne Law School</a> emailed me and wrote:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"[I]t is incorrect to say that the final decision to extradite Assange from Sweden to the US would be made by the courts.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>He directed me to <a href=\"http://klamberg.blogspot.se/2012/08/extradition-of-assange-to-us-via-sweden.html\">this analysis</a> from Mark Klamberg \u2013 a professor of international law at the University of Stockholm \u2013 who dissects Sweden's extradition law and makes Green's error as clear as it can be [my emphasis]:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"How does procedure work if somebody is to extradited from Sweden? \u2026 [I]f the person referred to in the request has not consented to being extradited, the case shall be tried by the supreme court. Section 20(1) provides that if the supreme court has considered that there is a legal obstacle to extradition the request may not be granted.</p> <p><em>\"Even if the supreme court has found that there are no obstacles, the government can refuse extradition.</em> This is because section 1(1) provides that if certain conditions are fulfilled, a person 'may' not 'shall' be extradited. In other words, even if the prosecutor-general and the supreme court finds that all conditions for extradition are fulfilled<em> the government may veto such extradition.</em> It does not work in the reverse way, the government can not grant extradition if the supreme court has found that any of the required conditions are lacking.\" </p> </blockquote> <p>Let's repeat that: \"Even if the supreme court has found that there are no obstacles, the government can refuse extradition.\" And: \"Even if the prosecutor-general and the supreme court finds that all conditions for extradition are fulfilled the government may veto such extradition.\" In other words, under clear Swedish law, the Swedish government has exactly the final decision-making authority over extradition that Green told his readers it lacks. </p> <p>Professor Klamberg is far from alone in making this clear. As I noted on Wednesday, <a href=\"http://ibnkafkasobiterdicta.wordpress.com/2012/08/19/the-julian-assange-circus-why-is-carl-bildt-lying/\">this Swedish-Moroccon lawyer analyzed</a> Swedish extradition law in rigorous detail to make the same point:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"Swedish extradition law clearly states that the Swedish government is the body deciding on any extradition request.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Moreover:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"No provision gives any court the right to decide on an extraditions request.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>The court's role in extradition requests is limited to this situation:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"The government may not extradite someone for whom the supreme court has found that an extradition would not be in conformity with the law.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>As I noted on Wednesday, his analysis of the law (exactly like Professor Klamberg's) shows there are two possible outcomes once the contested extradition request goes to the Swedish court: first, the court rules the extradition request is not cognizable under relevant law, in which case the Swedish government is barred from extraditing; or second, the court rules the extradition request is cognizable under relevant law, <em>in which case the Swedish government has the option not to extradite</em>. As he put it:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"The deciding body is thus the government, with an input by the prosecutor general.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Swedish extradition law is written to ensure that if an extradition is to occur, Swedish government officials, not its courts, are the final decision-makers on whether that should take place.</p> <p>More clear evidence of Green's error, first noted by <a href=\"http://pastehtml.com/view/c91yw7wjy.html\">this superb debunking of Green</a>, comes from <a href=\"http://www.dfat.gov.au/foi/downloads/dfat-foi-1112-F264.pdf\">documents sent by the Australian diplomatic mission in Sweden</a> to its home government on the Assange/extradition matter (they were declassified and released to the public by the Australian government). In response to questions from Canberra about what an extradition request to Sweden would entail, the Australian diplomatic mission explained:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"The process require[s] a request from another state, a decision by Sweden's supreme court on whether extradition was possible, and <em>finally a decision by government to go forward with the extradition.</em>\" [my emphasis; p61]</p> </blockquote> <p>The internal communications in the Australian government go on to note:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"The Swedish government could deny an extradition or temporary surrender that the supreme court had approved, but if the supreme court denied an extradition or temporary surrender application, then the matter ended there; ie, the government could not approve a process that the supreme court had rejected.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Again: the Swedish courts simply decide whether extradition is legally possible, but the final decision as to whether to extradite is vested in the Swedish government.</p> <p>This is not some sort of strange or exotic feature of Swedish law. As Professor Heller wrote when explaining that the Swedish government possesses exactly the final decision-making authority Green denied it has:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"Nor is that unusual; I don't know of any states that give the final decision to courts instead of to the executive.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>In light of this abundant evidence, I trust that even the most hardened Assange critic will acknowledge that Green was radically wrong on this key point. It should be noted that those sources I just cited are not Assange supporters, but rather are the opposite: they are all, to varying degrees, hostile to his fight against extradition to Sweden. Professor Klamberg (<a href=\"http://opiniojuris.org/2012/08/22/klamberg-on-extraditing-assange-from-sweden-to-the-u-s/\">along with Professor Heller</a>) is highly skeptical that Sweden would extradite Assange to the US. The Swedish-Moroccon lawyer I cited began his analysis by declaring:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"First, let me state that I am as adamantly in favour of Julian Assange being extradited to Sweden as I am opposed to him being extradited to the USA for any WikiLeaks-related offense.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>And the Australian government has been infamously unsupportive of the rights of its citizen. But they nonetheless all make crystal clear that Green's statement about the Swedish government lacking the power to decide extradition is factually false. </p> <p>It is inconceivable that the New Statesman would allow such a flagrant error on this key issue to remain unretracted, particularly since it was offered under the guise of Green's legal expertise. Indeed, when replying to Green on Wednesday, I myself assumed that there must be some reasonable basis to his claim about the lack of authority on the part of the Swedish government over extradition requests, and thus too readily vested his claim with credibility: a mistake I immediately corrected with updates upon learning that his claim was false. The New Statesman has the absolute journalistic obligation to prominently correct this error.</p> <p>It may be true that there are <em>other independent reasons</em> to argue that Sweden should not offer Assange the assurance against extradition that he seeks. One may contend, for instance, that Sweden should, or even must, wait until it receives an extradition request and its courts rule on its legality before it can make a determination as to whether it will comply. That is an argument Green makes. Professor Klamberg notes there \"is nothing in the extradition of criminal offences act that deals with this scenario, but it would depart from established practice.\"</p> <p>I happen not to find that objection valid. At the very least, one can imagine all sorts of ways that Sweden, Ecuador and Assange's lawyers could negotiate a resolution that provides Assange with meaningful protections against his fear of extradition to the US while following standard procedure on extraditions. Swedish authorities could, for instance, publicly state that they view espionage charges for the \"crime\" of reporting on government secrets to be a \"political crime\" not subject to extradition, but still reserve the right to formally decide upon any extradition request if and when they receive one. In the last four paragraphs of his analysis, <a href=\"http://ibnkafkasobiterdicta.wordpress.com/2012/08/19/the-julian-assange-circus-why-is-carl-bildt-lying/\">this lawyer</a> <strong><em>[link fixed]</em></strong> lays out exactly how such a deal could be reached consistent with Swedish law. If there were any real desire to find a resolution, one could be found. It is Sweden's steadfast refusal even to negotiate these matters that led the Ecuadoreans to be suspicious of their motives and to conclude that asylum was necessary here to protect Assange from political prosecution.</p> <p>But all of that is a completely separate issue from the glaring error in Green's post about whether it is the Swedish government or its courts that have final decision-making authority. The fact that Green made other arguments in support of his ultimate conclusion does not remotely mitigate his false claim that \"any final word on an extradition would (quite properly) be with an independent Swedish court, and not the government giving the purported 'guarantee'.\" Nor does it relieve the New Statesman of the obligation to prominently correct this error.</p> <p>I'm certainly not accusing Green of bad faith \u2013 ie, of knowingly making false claims. It is difficult to discern Swedish extradition law without being a Swedish legal expert or relying on them, which is why it's a good idea for people like Green not to do it, especially in a periodical. But motives aside, what he told his readers under the guise of legal expertise is unquestionably false, and it had serious consequences for how this whole debate has been perceived.</p> <p>This is why this is so crucial: if Sweden (and/or Britain) would provide some meaningful assurance that Assange would not be extradited to the US to face espionage charges for WikiLeaks' journalism, then the vast majority of asylum supporters (including me) would loudly demand that he immediately travel to Stockholm to confront those allegations; Assange himself has said he would do so. That gives the lie to the ugly slander that those who have expressed support for Ecuador's asylum decision are dismissive of the sex assault claims or do not care about seeing them resolved.</p> <p>Speaking for myself, I have always said the same thing about those allegations in Sweden from the moment they emerged: they are serious and deserve legal resolution. It is not Assange or his supporters preventing that resolution, but the Swedish and British governments, which are strangely refusing even to negotiate as to how Assange's rights against <a href=\"http://www.smh.com.au/national/us-intends-to-chase-assange-cables-show-20120817-24e1l.html\">unjust extradition and political persecution</a> can be safeguarded along with the rights of the complainants to have their allegations addressed. Green's false claim that the Swedish government is unable to act because it has no final authority over extradition has seriously distorted this issue, and it is why it should be promptly and prominently corrected by the New Statesman.</p> <p>* * * * *</p> <p><strong><em>UPDATE</em></strong>: On Twitter today, one of the four legal sources cited here, Mark Klamberg, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Klamberg/status/239028648424898560\">claimed</a> that I \"distorted\" his argument by omitting certain claims he made.

  "<p>The Republicans roll into Tampa next week \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/22/tropical-storm-isaac-republicans-tampa?CMP=twt_gu\">hurricanes permitting</a> \u2013 for their <a href=\"http://www.gopconvention2012.com/\">national convention</a> where Mitt Romney will be officially confirmed as the party's candidate for president.</p> <p>The build-up to the convention has been overshadowed by the highly controversial \"<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/23/todd-akin-10-points-behind?newsfeed=true\">legitimate rape</a>\" remarks made by Todd Atkin, a congressman from Missouri, and his subsequent refusal to quit his bid for re-election despite pressure from the party's leadership.</p> <p>But while the US media has largely focused on this unedifying internal battle, Mitt Romney has laid out his all-important <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/08/23/us-usa-campaign-romney-idUSBRE87J0P020120823\">energy plans</a> for the country. The headline is that, if elected as president, he will make the US \"energy independent\" by 2020 and, by doing so, create three million jobs.</p> <p>To eliminate the nation's reliance on imported oil and gas, Romney says he will lift many offshore drilling restrictions and free up states to use federal lands for energy production. By contrast, there was little focus in his plan on renewables, such as wind and solar. In essence, he has merged George W Bush's \"<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2006/feb/01/usa.julianborger\">we're addicted to oil</a>\" remarks with Sarah Palin's \"<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2009/jul/14/sarah-palin-energy-obama\">drill, baby, drill</a>\". (It's possibly not a coincidence that his plan was announced just hours after he had raised <a href=\"http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5gBxsTI0Jw7k51L44lxPxezIoiC4w?docId=CNG.dfed6bdcd8930778f0ca53ccf91435e1.71\">$7m from oil industry executives</a> at an election fundraiser in Texas.)</p> <p>But Obama hasn't exactly moved heaven and earth to differentiate himself from Romney on energy. Yes, he certainly talks up renewables more \u2013 his <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xsZ45Weng0\">latest campaign ad</a> shows him next to solar panels \u2013 but at his own fundraiser on Wednesday, <a href=\"http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2012/08/23/romney-rolling-out-domestic-energy-plan/\">he said</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>Oil production is up. Natural gas is up. But we're also doubling the energy that we get from wind and solar. That is clean, it's renewable, it's homegrown, it's creating jobs all across America.</p> </blockquote> <p>Nowhere amid all this talk of energy independence was any explicit reference to the climate implications of increased exploitation of \"homegrown\" fossil fuels. While the subject remains utterly toxic for Republicans, even Obama rarely raises the topic these days. This week, an <a href=\"http://thehill.com/blogs/e2-wire/e2-wire/245011-obama-spox-hints-climate-will-stay-in-campaign-background\">Obama spokesman indicated</a> that climate change would not be a major campaigning issue for Democrats:</p> <blockquote> <p>Clearly [climate change] is something that is important to the administration, but right now we are obviously going to be focusing on jobs and the economy and talking about what our contrast is.</p> </blockquote> <p>Signalling the intense frustration of environmental groups on this matter, the League of Conservation Voters has even <a href=\"http://thehill.com/blogs/e2-wire/e2-wire/244813-enviros-want-climate-question-at-obama-romney-debate\">launched an online petition</a> urging PBS's Jim Lehrer, who will moderate the first presidential TV debate on 3 October, to ask a climate-related question.</p> <p>Even more revealing, a document will be released next week at the Republican convention that will likely shine a light on just how far down the political radar climate change has fallen over the past few years in the US since the heady days when Obama routinely mentioned it during his previous election campaign.</p> <p>At each convention, the political parties publish their \"<a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/wp/2012/08/23/do-party-platforms-really-matter/\">platform</a>\" document. In essence, it is a manifesto that has been discussed and signed-off by a committee of party representatives from across all the states. During previous presidential election, the platform has been a largely symbolic and bureaucratic exercise. But the <a href=\"http://articles.boston.com/2012-08-23/politics/33322780_1_platform-committee-gay-marriage-human-life-amendment\">US media is signalling</a> this year that the platform documents will be more intensely scrutinised than before, in part due to the internal wrangles triggered by Todd Atkins.</p> <p>On Monday and Tuesday, the Republican platform committee <a href=\"http://www.c-span.org/Events/Platform-Cmte-Sends-Platform-to-GOP-Convention-Delegates/10737433193-6/\">met in Tampa</a> in advance of the convention to finalise the document. Very little has been leaked to the press \u2013 <a href=\"http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2012/08/23/full-gop-platform-statement-on-abortion/\">bar the section on abortion</a> \u2013 but one member of the platform committee from West Virginia has given a teaser. Conrad Lucas, the state's Republican chairman, said in a report in the <a href=\"http://dailymail.com/News/election12/201208220233\">Charleston Daily Mail</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"Once the platform is released, I think the voters in West Virginia are going to be very interested because of the pro-coal and natural gas positions that are in it\"\u2026<br>Lucas also offered an amendment during committee meetings this week to include a formal statement opposing Obama's cap-and-trade energy policy. <br>\"I was happy that we got opposition to cap-and-trade reinserted in the platform, which it wasn't in 2008,\" he said. \"It was unanimously approved, which I was excited about.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>West Virginia is well known as \"coal country\", but further south in Texas, where the oil industry dominates, the state's Republican platform document has been released online (<a href=\"http://www.tfn.org/site/DocServer/20...pdf?docID=3201\">pdf</a>). It provides an eye-popping insight into Republican thinking in that part of the country. It will certainly be interesting to see how much of it feeds into the national platform document, when it is finally published next week.</p> <p>It would be easy to be distracted by the extraordinary sections on homosexuality (\"contrary to the fundamental, unchanging truths that have been ordained by God\") and the teaching of \"controversial subjects\" in schools (\"we believe theories such as life origins and environmental change should be taught as challengeable scientific theories subject to change as new data is produced\"), but let's stick to those tightly focused on energy and the environment...</p> <blockquote> <p>Protection from Extreme Environmentalists \u2013 We strongly oppose all efforts of the extreme environmental groups that stymie legitimate business interests. We strongly oppose those efforts that attempt to use the environmental causes to purposefully disrupt and stop those interests within the oil and gas industry. We strongly support the immediate repeal of the Endangered Species Act. We strongly oppose the listing of the dune sage brush lizard either as a threatened or an endangered species. We believe the Environmental Protection Agency should be abolished...</p> <p>Energy Strategy \u2013 We encourage a comprehensive energy policy that allows more development of domestic energy sources and reduces our need for foreign energy. Energy policy should be cooperative, economically viable without taxpayer funded subsidies, and environmentally safe, but not restricted by overzealous environmental activism. <br>Alternative Energy Sources \u2013 We encourage economically viable use of wind, coal-fired plants, solar, and nuclear power, and bio-sources without government subsidies. <br>Government Restrictions \u2013 We support immediate removal of government barriers to free market solutions to production and distribution of energy including restrictions on: drilling and production operations on public and private lands and waters refineries electric power generation and distribution federal gas mileage standards (CAF\u00c9 standards) and fuel blends.</p> <p>Cap and Trade \u2013 We oppose Cap and Trade (\"Cap and Tax\"). <br>U.S. Department of Energy \u2013 We support the elimination of the Department of Energy. <br>Incandescent Light Bulbs - We support the freedom to continue to use and manufacture incandescent light bulbs. <br>Keystone XL Pipeline \u2013 We support the immediate approval and construction of the Keystone XL and other pipelines that will reduce our reliance on imported oil and natural gas from unstable or unfriendly countries. <br>Deep Water Drilling \u2013 We support immediate resumption of deep water drilling and production in the Gulf of Mexico. <br>Land Drilling \u2013 We support land drilling and production operations including hydraulic fracturing. <br>Ethanol \u2013 We support the repeal of legislation mandating ethanol as fuel additives and/or primary fuel. <br>Natural Gas - Alternative Fuel - We urge the use of natural gas as an alternative transportation fuel and as complimentary fuel to gasoline and diesel. <br>We support the manufacture of vehicles that utilize natural gas as an alternative fuel and/or a complimentary fuel. <br>We support and encourage the conversion of existing private fleets to natural gas as a dual use fuel. <br>We support the use of natural gas in electric power generation and other industrial uses...</p> <p>United Nations \u2013 We support the withdrawal of the United States from the United Nations and the removal of U.N. headquarters from U.S. soil. <br>United Nations Agenda 21 -The Republican Party of Texas should expose all United Nations Agenda 21 treaty policies and its supporting organizations, agreements and contracts. We oppose implementation of the UN Agenda 21 Program which was adopted at the Earth Summit Conference in 1992 purporting to promote a comprehensive program of sustainable development projects, nationally, regionally and locally. We oppose the influence, promotion and implementation of nongovernmental organizations, metropolitan and/or regional planning organizations, Councils of Government, and International Council for Local Environmental initiatives and the use of American (Texas) citizen's taxes to promote these programs.</p> </blockquote> <p>Remember that these are the official policy positions of the Republican party in one of the US's most populous and influential states. It remains to be seen next week how much of this <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/tea-party-movement\">Tea Party</a>-type of thinking filters through into the Republican's national platform document, but the statements above certainly provide a somewhat unpalatable <em>hors d'oeuvre</em>.</p>",
  "<p><em>I'm a bit of a gaming addict and was perfectly happy with my seven-year-old Xbox 360 until I saw Battlefield 3 running on a friend's gaming PC. It blew me away. I have been patiently waiting for the next gen consoles to come out but can wait no more: I need a decent gaming PC to satisfy my cravings. As I am normally a console gamer, I would play games through my HD TV, so I can lounge on my couch with a wireless keyboard and mouse rather than be cramped on an office chair. I'd also love to use it as a media centre, so I could record Freeview channels. I have a budget of about \u00a31,000, and would like it to be as quiet as possible. Can you help?</em><br><strong>Alex</strong></p> <p>I expect that if you asked a thousand gamers this question, you'd get at least a thousand different answers. There are so many different parts that the number of combinations is impossibly large. The answer also requires a balancing act, because your \u00a31,000 budget will not enable you buy the top-rated components in many categories without making sacrifices elsewhere.</p> <p>Fortunately, there is a wonderful website called <a href=\"http://pcpartpicker.com/uk/\">PC Part Picker</a>. This allows you to build a system and buy the parts. It aims to restrict your choices to parts that are compatible with one another. It also provides user ratings and benchmark results so that you can check the effects of changing particular components. You can check the system I specced on your behalf at <a href=\"http://pcpartpicker.com/uk/p/ft9r\"> http://pcpartpicker.com/uk/p/ft9r</a>. Click the Edit button to change the parts for ones you prefer.</p> <p>I've taken a somewhat conservative approach. In general, I've gone for well known parts rather than obscure ones, so you can check up on them by reading reviews. I've also tried to allow for upgrades.</p> <p>I don't think there will be too much argument about the best processor: a 3.4GHz quad-core Intel Core i5-3570K (\u00a3174.94). This is the Ivy Bridge equivalent of the Sandy Bridge i5-2500K, which is the chip in my main PC. You can overclock it to 4GHz and possibly more if you install a better cooler, such as the Cooler Master Hyper 212 EVO (\u00a326.65).</p> <p>Choice of motherboard is tricky, as you need something that supports Ivy Bridge, USB 3.0 and so on. The Gigabyte GA-Z77-D3H ATX LGA1155 seems good value at \u00a377.72: it's around \u00a3100 less than an Asus Sabertooth Z77.</p> <p>The GA-Z77-D3H has four memory slots and supports up to 32GB of memory. However, 8GB is enough for most gaming, so start with two 4GB sticks of Corsair Vengeance DDR3-1600 low-profile memory (\u00a337.99). You can always fill the two empty slots later, if you really need 16GB or more.</p> <p>The price of solid state disks (SSDs) has fallen to the point where any new gaming PC should have one. The 128GB Samsung 830 is another economical choice at \u00a379.98, and while it isn't the fastest, it seems to be pretty reliable. It has enough space for 64-bit Windows Home Premium (\u00a371.05) and your main games. A 128GB Crucial M4 (\u00a378.95) would be an alternative.</p> <p>For a second drive, I've picked the 1TB Western Digital Caviar Black (\u00a379.76), to store your movies, photos and other applications. It's nippy at 7200RPM. I've had years of good experience with Caviar drives, but some people prefer other brands. A 1TB Samsung Spinpoint HD103SJ (\u00a366.22) or Seagate would be a good alternative. If you need 2TB, you can get a bigger, slower 5400RPM drive such as the Samsung Spinpoint HD204UI (\u00a375.84) or WD Caviar Green (\u00a380.00) for slightly more money.</p> <p>For an optical drive, I've chucked in a Sony DVD/CD Writer because the price is so low (\u00a312.88) that you may as well have one. Of course, you could step up to a Lite-On iHOS104-06 (\u00a341.52) for a Blu-ray drive.</p> <p>You will obviously need a power supply and an ATX case in which to fit all the parts. The Cooler Master HAF 922 (\u00a386.38) is a popular case but the design is somewhat racy by normal (boring) standards. Perhaps the <a href=\"http://www.coolermaster.com/product.php?product_id=6841\">Cooler Master Silencio 550</a> (\u00a364.12) would be a better choice as it includes foam mats and air vents designed to reduce noise. </p> <p>For a power supply, I've picked the Corsair 650W (\u00a383.58), which should be big enough. Since it's not built into the case, you can easily upgrade it if you want to run some high-end graphics cards.</p> <p>The graphics card is usually the most expensive part of a games PC, and often the most contentious. The 920MHz Sapphire Radeon HD 7850 is a good all-rounder with 2GB of video memory, at a very reasonable \u00a3177.98. The same chipset is used in other cards such as the Gigabyte GV-R785OC-2GD (\u00a3168.94) and the Asus HD7850-DC2-2GD5 (\u00a3187.98), so you could equally well choose one of these, and the Gigabyte card would go with the Gigabyte motherboard. </p> <p>All this brings the total to \u00a3906.68, excluding a Freeview tuner.</p> <p>Should you want to upgrade in the future, you could add a second Radeon HD 7850 card using ATI's <a href=\"http://www.directron.com/whatiscf.html\">CrossFireX</a> system. This doesn't work with Nvidia cards, which are the preferred choice for Adobe CS software. The Gigabyte motherboard supports CrossFireX but not <a href=\"http://www.nvidia.co.uk/object/sli_technology_overview_uk.html\">Nvidia's SLI</a> system, so if you want to take that route, choose a different motherboard, such as the Asus Sabertooth Z77.</p> <p>If you mostly want to run Battlefield 3 (which I have not played), then web discussions suggest it would be worth going for a graphics card with an Nvidia GeForce GTX 570 chipset instead. Examples include the Asus ENGTX570 (\u00a3239.48), EVGA 012-P3-1573-KR (\u00a3198.68) and Zotac ZT-50203-10M (\u00a3281.98). Going for the EVGA card would not change the price significantly, but would give you much better scores on graphics benchmarks such as 3DMark and Cinebench and, one hopes, real games. If your mate's PC has a similar GeForce card, that could swing it. Ideally, buy a better one!</p> <p>As for PC gaming on a TV set, I'm not wholly convinced. Gamers tend to use high-resolution monitors with much higher pixel densities, but if you sit far enough away, it shouldn't be noticeable. If you can get drivers that will display higher resolutions, all the better. Also, TV sets tend to suffer from \"input lag\" or \"display lag\". This may be caused by the TV doing some clever post processing to improve the picture quality. If there is a noticeable lag between you pressing a button and the screen responding, then you are not going to last long in online multiplayer games.</p> <p>See if your TV has been benchmarked at <a href=\"http://www.hdtvtest.co.uk/\">HDTVTest.co.uk</a> or a similar site that measures input lag. Also check to see if your TV has a game or PC setting that avoids the problem.</p> <p>You can certainly use your new PC as a media centre, either using Microsoft's Media Center software or by installing the open source <a href=\"http://www.mythtv.org/wiki/Xbox_Frontend#Running_XBMC_with_native_MythTV_Support\">XBMC with native MythTV Support</a> for Windows. You might also want to check out the <a href=\"http://plugins.tvcatchup.com/~xbmc/\">TVCatchup plugin for XBMC</a>. (What started as Xbox Media Center has no connection with Microsoft.)</p> <p>You will also need to install a DVB-T2 (Freeview) tuner card, such as Kubik's high-definition dual-tuner TBS6220 or TBS6280. The former is within your budget.</p> <p>Whether the PC will be quiet enough remains to be seen. Or heard. PCs designed for TV use tend to have slow processors and slow hard drives, no graphics cards, very small power supplies, and no fans. As a result, they can be almost silent. Your games PC won't need to use the graphics card to play movies, but the rest of it is likely to make some noise. There's no way round that, at the price. However, a <a href=\"http://www.watercoolinguk.co.uk/cat/Water-Cooling-Kits_40.html\">water cooling system</a> could reduce fan noise, and you get loads of bragging points for installing one of these.<br></p>",
  "<p>After her fourth failed attempt to swim from Cuba to Florida, Diana Nyad said the 103-mile crossing was probably impossible. Proliferation of venomous jellyfish create an obstacle more insurmountable than hypothermia, severe weather, sharks, fatigue, and expensive logistics. The 63-year-old endurance swimmer <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/21/diana-nyad-swim-cuba-florida\" title=\"\">pulled out of her most recent attempt after 42 hours in the water</a>, her face and hands swollen with the painful stings of the box jellies. Afterwards, she waxed poetic about valuing the journey more than the destination. She admitted the jellyfish were too much for her.</p> <p>She didn't, however, say anything about giving up.</p> <p>\"It's not in my nature to admit that no matter how much will you summon, no matter how much courage you express, no matter how much intelligent and complex planning you do, no matter the excruciating long hours of training, no matter the dedicated and expert individuals you choose to help you, sometimes you just don't arrive at your destination,\" <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/diana-nyad/the-cuba-swim_b_1823393.html\" title=\"\">she wrote in the Huffington Post</a>.</p> <p>Nyad has given up on her dream before. In her first attempt in 1978, aged 28, she fought raging seas until the current pushed her too far into the Gulf of Mexico, out of reach from land. The following year, she set a distance record from the Bahamas, and then hung up her goggles for 30 years. Half a lifetime happened in the interim before the yearning returned. She trained vigorously and made two attempts from Cuba in 2011 \u2013 the first felled by an asthma attack, and the second by the vicious jellyfish. Any future attempts meant raising another $300,000 through speeches and sponsorships, summoning more than 50 people to serve as a support team, securing visas and equipment, hiring shark wranglers, and figuring out how to beat the jellyfish. It was impossible.</p> <p>\"I think I'm going to my grave without swimming from Cuba to Florida,\" she told CNN last year.</p> <p>And yet, on 19 August, she tried again. She was armed with head-to-toe protective materials, duct tape around her ankles, wrist and nostrils, and a doctor to treat the stings. She was still stung nine times, and was struggling with the systemic effects of chills and tremors when a dangerous storm moved in. The combination of the two convinced her team that she shouldn't continue.</p> <p>Critics accuse Nyad of tilting at windmills. What can chasing an impossible dream accomplish, they ask, besides burning through vast sums of money, putting her support team at risk and causing Nyad unfathomable amounts of suffering? What is this swim about, they want to know. Is it obsession? Ego? The mania of an athlete who may simply want to recreate the glory days of her youth?</p> <p>And yet, Nyad's swim has inspired thousands. Some credit her for influencing them in their triathlon training, or showing them how it's possible to overcome fear, or proving that age shouldn't hold you back. Nyad is a relatable figure \u2013 a near-senior-citizen who quit swimming and backed out of the spotlight for decades, and who presumably woke up one day and said, \"I bet I still have it in me to swim 100 miles across shark-infested waters. Why not?\"</p> <p>And why not? The original conquistadors of the useless \u2013 early mountaineers and polar explorers \u2013 also knew that nothing of value awaited them at the pinnacles of the most forbidding places on Earth. Like Nyad, their pursuits required large sums of money and armies of helpers; the risks were great and the rewards ultimately intangible. But few would deny the historical impact of Robert Scott and Roald Amundsen's race to the South Pole, or question whether the world would be a better place if <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Mallory\" title=\"\">George Mallory</a> never obsessed about \u2013 and ultimately died for \u2013 the summit of Mount Everest, simply \"because it was there.\"</p> <p>The world still needs people such as Diana Nyad, people who demonstrate the strength of will by taking the impossible and making it possible. Nyad's straits of Florida are a metaphorical stand-in for any number of challenges that people believe they'll never overcome. Her refusal to quit inspires others to press forward. In an era where few mountain summits remained unclimbed, we still need impossible pursuits to reaffirm the indomitability of the human spirit.</p>",
  "<p>So who's got the easiest run in then? Possibly table-topping<strong> San Jose</strong>, who have a home game heavy schedule, with an emphasis on teams with not a great deal to play for in their conference. This weekend they'll be facing a <strong>Colorado Rapids</strong> side who've had a truly underwhelming attempt to transform themselves this season. Behind San Jose, <strong>Sporting KC</strong> and <strong>New York Red Bulls</strong> start the first of three games of mutually assured destruction this weekend, at Livestrong Park. We'll be covering that one live, as it's a sequence that may have a big say on not just the destiny of the East, but that of the Supporters Shield too.</p> <p>Also in the mix - <strong>Real Salt Lake</strong>, though they've lost two straight MLS games. They'll try to regroup at <strong>Philadelphia</strong> on Friday night, trying to at least enjoy a day's space from the teams on their shoulder in the West. Of those teams <strong>Vancouver</strong> go to <strong>Portland</strong> for another Cascadia derby, while the other regional rivals <strong>Seattle</strong> face a trip to <strong>Chivas</strong> on Saturday night. Busy weekend at the Home Depot Center, as the other tenants, <strong>Los Angeles Galaxy</strong>, face <strong>FC Dallas</strong> on Sunday evening - in what suddenly looks like an intriguing tie between two resurgent sides.</p> <p>Meanwhile in the East, <strong>Montreal Impact</strong> put their four-game winning streak on the line against a <strong>DC United</strong> side <a href=\"http://www.mlssoccer.com/matchcenter/2012-08-22-dc-v-chi/highlights\">who dismantled Chicago in eye-catching fashion in midweek</a>. In the other midweek game, <strong>Columbus Crew</strong> <a href=\"http://www.mlssoccer.com/matchcenter/2012-08-22-clb-v-tor/highlights\">completed their rescheduled fixture with Toronto FC with a victory</a>, and now host a <strong>New England Revolution</strong> side whose season has come off the rails. <strong>Toronto</strong> meanwhile, have to lick their wounds and head to <strong>Houston</strong>, where they actually <a href=\"http://www.mlssoccer.com/matchcenter/2012-06-20-hou-v-tor/highlights\">gave Houston an almighty scare earlier this season</a>. Can they repeat or surpass that feat?</p> <p>Not daring to go anywhere such thorny questions unassisted, the Guardian has rounded up some of our gang of fan reps, bloggers, podcasters and beat writers to get their reaction to how the local sides have been doing and what they expect from this weekend's games. </p> <p>See what they have to say, leave your comments below, and join us for <strong>Sporting KC vs New York Red Bulls on Sunday at 9pm</strong>.

Geiger waved off two D.C. United goals, one correctly, one dubiously. The Union simply couldn't handle the numbers United threw at them once Andy Najar shifted to right back in the second half and United sacrificed defense for offense. D.C. effectively contained playmaker Michael Farfan and cut off the runs that strikers Jack McInerney and Antoine Hoppenot have made a living off in recent weeks. This was the third time in two months the teams had played, and D.C. clearly learned a thing or two.</p> <p>On Friday, the Union host Real Salt Lake. They'll be without right back Sheanon Williams, who was sent off Sunday with two very disputable yellow cards. Rookie Raymon Gaddis will deputize, but all eyes will be on Zac MacMath. The rookie goalkeeper remains a talented shot-stopper but has looked shaky since suffering a concussion in the spring. If not for a Freddy Adu goalline clearance and Geiger's aforementioned calls, MacMath could have surrendered four goals Sunday. Speaking of Adu, the Union need him and newly acquired Danny Cruz to offer more options on the wings, because teams are keying on Farfan and McInerney. RSL deploys a much better back line than United, so it could be a struggle for the young Union, even at home.</p> <p><strong>Denzel Eslinger</strong>, <a href=\"http://www.rslsoapbox.com/\">RSL Soapbox</a>:</p> <p>For Real Salt Lake playing a fairly solid match on Saturday only to fall victim to a couple of counter attacks by FC Dallas that results in a 2-1 loss at home was painful, but bouncing back on Tuesday and picking up a 2-0 win in Champions League action over Tauro FC may have been just the medicine the team needed as they quickly packed up and headed east to take on the Philadelphia Union on Friday night. This will mark the first RSL match that will be on National TV this year as NBC Sports will broadcast the match, and for RSL they hope that keep their momentum from Tuesday alive. RSL will be looking to capitalize on the Union's struggles at home where they are just 5-5-1, RSL will most likely still be without Jamison Olave and Chris Schuler but will get Nat Borchers who was suspended on Tuesday in CCL back. Be on the lookout for Paulo Jr. who has been mighty good the last couple of matches and could play a major role for RSL again. Hard to pick a win on the road but I have to go with my gut and that is a 2-1 RSL win.</p> <h2>Montreal Impact vs D.C. United, Sat 4pm (TSN 2, RDS)</h2> <p><strong>Sofiane Benzaza</strong>, <a href=\"http://www.mountroyalsoccer.com\">Mount Royal Soccer</a>, Montreal:</p> <p>Did anyone predict 3 red cards, 2 penalty kicks and another Goal of the Week nominee before the Montreal Impact faced the San Jose Earthquakes? Not me. But no one is surprised by the quality of soccer that was displayed against the MLS leaders. Camara's and Lenhart's sendoff leveled the playing field but the Impact was still down 1-0 from a Wondolowski PK goal.<br> This is where the character and determination of the team mixed with Jesse Marsch's (and his staff) full confidence in his squad came through. As much as Marsch is a rookie head coach, there is nothing rookie about his MLS experience and feel for his players. With 4 wins in a row, the Montreal Impact will now host D.C United at Stade Saputo, in another 3-6-9-12 point game. No help from the midweek games in the East as both the Columbus Crew and D.C. United won their midweek games. Still, D.C United is still coming off a shaky stretch even after beating the Chicago Fire. A depleted Impact defense (injuries and suspensions) will look to step it up against what used to be a potent attack. I don't expect any ties at Stade Saputo and will take the biased route with a 1-0 win for Montreal. With a hot Marco Di Vaio, I don't see how a D.C. United defense could stop him for 90 minutes.</p> <p><strong>Martin Shatzer</strong>, <a href=\"http://www.blackandredunited.com/\">Black and Red United</a>, DC:</p> <p>D.C. United is in the middle of its most important stretch of the season. After hardly playing at all in June and July, the team suddenly faces a run of five matches in just 14 days. Two of those matches are in the books now already, as United was able to capture four points at home earlier this week with an infuriating draw against the Philadelphia Union and an impressive win over the Chicago Fire. The Union match featured a heaping portion of questionable calls from the referee that resulted in two potential winning goals for D.C. being taken off the board. United didn't dwell on the lost points though. They came back just four days later and extinguished the previously red hot Fire with a 4-2 result.</p> <p>United can now boast that they haven't lost a game at home since March 10th. Unfortunately the team hasn't fared as well on the road though. United is in prime position to make the MLS playoffs for the first time since 2007, but in order to go deep in the playoffs, they'll need to learn to win outside of RFK Stadium. They'll get the chance to do just that on Saturday night against a Montreal Impact side that is also far better on their home grounds than when traveling.</p> <h2>Columbus Crew vs New England Revolution, Sat 7.30pm</h2> <p><strong>Ben Hoelzel</strong>, <a href=\"http://crewunion.com\">Crew Union</a>, Columbus Crew:</p> <p>The Crew are in the middle of a tough stretch of seven games in twenty-one days. It is a great test of fitness and team depth. At Houston on Sunday the Massive Canaries blew a lead late in the game to sneak out of Houston with a draw. On Wednesday they went up two goals early only to let in another easy goal late and spent the final 20 minutes on their heels absorbing pressure from a less than stellar Toronto attack. Luckily, the Crew held on for all three points this time. On paper one would think the talk around Columbus would be a defense susceptible to giving up goals late in games, but it's not. All the talk is about Federico Higuain (Real Mardid's Gonzalo Huguain's brother).</p> <p>The Crew's newest Designated Player and highest paid player in club history already seems well worth the investment. He made his debut as a substitute on Sunday and started Wednesday amassing two assists and a goal in just 120 minutes of play. He has already established a fantastic on field rapport with the Crew's other Summer signing, Jairo Arrieta. And just like that, the Crew's attack seems formidable. There is a buzz and excitement not seen in this city in a couple years. The Crew are fun to watch again.</p> <p>This weekend New England comes to town. In their last seven games the Revs have lost five and drawn two. They are struggling to say the least. The Crew's new look offense gets another easy game to gel some more, but a few new faces may be in the line-up to keep legs fresh. Crew roll to an easy 3-1 victory as the Argentine talisman, Higuain, continues to impress.</p> <p><strong>Julie Kumor</strong>, <a href=\"http://www.midnightriders.com/\">Midnight Riders</a>:</p> <p>I don't even know where to start anymore, different week same frustration. Jay Heaps decided to change things up this week with his starting line-up, and shock is the word I would describe as how most of us felt when we heard Benny Feilhaber wasn't starting. Sure he hadn't been electric this season, but last couple games he had actually played decent. So was the benching for the new line-up or sending him a message about his attitude? Also, if he knew Lee Nguyen was injured pre-game why start him and risk further injury? This game started bad, 4 minutes in and a penalty was called, relieved it didn't come with a suspension. Most of us gathered at the bar in Cambridge for the viewing, agreed the PK was a fair call. There was a brief moment we were back in the game when it was tied up on a goal that I described as all the fluster of the game winning goal against Mexico earlier in the week and none of the class. When Chicago scored the second goal off a thrown in, I think most of us gave up on the game, and continued on with our beers.</p> <p>Against Columbus away, no shot: 3-0 Columbus. Then Wednesday the Revs welcome back Shalrie Joseph for a home game against Chivas. Mid-week game means even lower attendance so Shalrie will not get the proper send-off he earned with his many years in New England. Sorry Shalrie, hey you could be Steve Ralston or Taylor Twellman, they got less from the organization, and by less, I mean nothing. Chivas: 1- 0</p> <h2>Houston Dynamo vs Toronto FC, Sat 8.30pm (TSN 2)</h2> <p><strong>Zach Woosley</strong>, <a href=\"http://www.dynamotheory.com/\">Dynamo Theory</a>, Houston:</p> <p>Meh. I mean, the Dynamo didn't lose but a 2-2 draw against the Crew left me unfulfilled. I think the annoyance comes from the fact that the Crew really did outplay the Dynamo. Even though Columbus is vastly improved thanks to their summer signings, I expected the Dynamo to come out stronger after the loss to NY. Still it's a point and I'll take it. </p> <p>Considering the Dynamo had a mid-week CCL match in El Salvador, my expectations were low. Then Houston won that without having to play several key starters and my hopes are now buoyed. Toronto played in the midweek as well using their normal lineup, so this actually might end up being a bit of an advantage for Houston. Let's be honest though, despite winning in Toronto a few weeks ago, we will owe TFC some payback from almost embarrassing us at home in June. Look for the Dynamo to get back to their winning ways on Saturday.</p> <p><strong>Boris Aguilar</strong>, Executive, <a href=\"http://www.redpatchboys.ca/\">Red Patch Boys</a>:</p> <p>Toronto FC has been struggling as of late. Over the weekend they fell 1-0 at homy to Sporting Kansas. Toronto played again on Wednesday night in Columbus and battled hard, but fell short and lost 2-1. Sadly, Toronto (5-15-5, 20 points) has fallen to 0-4-1 in the past five games. Lack of depth and an increased number of games has added to our struggles as of late. There are a number of injuries that are still keeping the bench thin. Our defense has been stretched thin and our strikers cannot find the back of the net. All of these variables together create a formula for disaster (which has been the theme for the season).</p> <p>Toronto is back on the road on Saturday travelling to Houston. In our last meeting at home Toronto fell short. The meeting before that, Toronto and Houston battled to a draw. One can hope that the team can find their winning way but with the recent amount of injuries and overall mount of games that they played, I don't see Toronto coming out on top. I see the side putting an a heck of an effort, and playing for the badge but I don't see a result. I predict a 2-1 Houston win.</p> <h2>San Jose Earthquakes vs Colorado Rapids, Sat 10.30pm</h2> <p><strong>\"Nerdy Gales\"</strong>, <a href=\"http://www.centerlinesoccer.com/\">Center Line Soccer</a>, San Jose:</p> <p>Stade Saputo has been the cauldron for the Montreal Impact's hot streak of home victories, the latest of which came last week against the San Jose Earthquakes. For the Quakes, it was more of a house of cards: a 21st-minute altercation between San Jose's Steven Lenhart and Montreal's Hassoun Camara saw both players red carded; the resulting spot kick was converted by Chris Wondolowski for his league-leading 18th goal of the season. The Quakes lead lasted a fleeting two minutes before Di Vaio's equalizer, and Neagle's go ahead goal for the Impact, forced San Jose to push forward. The inevitable break away - Di Vaio's dash for goal - could only be nixed by last defender Jason Hernandez; a second red card and another Goonie was a goner. Bernier scored from the resulting penalty, sealing the game 3-1 in favor of the French-Canadian team. </p> <p>San Jose remains five points clear in the West as they return home to face the Colorado Rapids on Saturday. Quakes defender Victor Bernardez fell afoul of the MLS Disciplinary Committee on Tuesday and the absence of Bernardez, Hernandez and Lenhart might be compounded by the tweaked hamstring of speedy midfielder Shea Salinas. Defenders Ramiro Corrales and Ike Opara are likely to return to the back four with regulars Beitashour and Morrow. Up front, Alan Gordon (himself coming off of a two-game suspension) is likely to replace Lenhart as the target man up front with Wondo. This will be the week that Quakes fans find out whether our roster is as deep as we hope. Our own home streak remains unbroken this season, and even with the Rapids struggling in 8th place, they might prove the Quakes toughest home test to date. </p> <p><strong>Richard Bamber</strong>, COO, <a href=\"http://www.bulldogsupporters.com\">Bulldog Supporters Group</a>, Colorado Rapids:</p> <p>It's a familiar story in Rapidsland with the team taking the lead through a Brian Mullan goal against Chivas USA in a game that both sides desperately wanted to win. However we then let the 3 points slip through our fingers when a defensive mistake allowed Juan Pablo Angel to equalize in the 83rd minute.<br> It's not all bad as the capture of Honduran defensive midfielder &amp; national captain Hendry Thomas has genuinely excited the faithful. Thomas comes from Wigan Athletic, where he spent 3 years playing Premier League football against world class players week in, week out. Naturally a debate has arisen over whether his signing shuts the door on a potential return for Pablo Mastroeni, who is still out with concussion related symptoms, and even the future of fellow deep lying midfielder Jeff Larentowicz. Hendry, by his own admission is only about 70% match fit &amp; the Rapids have yet to receive the necessary transfer paperwork at time of writing, so we'll wait with interest to see his debut in the next couple of weeks. As for this weekend it's pretty simple really:<br>We are playing the league leaders.<br>At their place.<br>And we have lost our last 6 matches on the road. <br> <br>We'll pray for an upset but saying we'd be happy with a draw really is an understatement...</p> <h2>Portland Timbers vs Vancouver Whitecaps, Sat 10.30pm</h2> <p><strong>Michael Pearson</strong>, <a href=\"http://www.timbersarmy.org\">Timbers Army</a>, Portland:</p> <p>30 minutes of entertaining, exciting and visually appealing soccer wasn't enough to secure another road point in New York and stretched Portland's winless streak to 8 games. Once again, the Timbers abandoned their more defensively resolute shape, playing a free-wheeling 4-3-3 - the gamble worked; for a time. The team found acres of space in the middle Zizzo's two assists and complete dominance led to Hans Backe pulling abused leftback Roy Miller in just the 36th minute, and replacing him with former Timber Kenny Cooper.</p> <p>From there, the match tightened up. The second half featured several 1v1 chances that the Timbers blew, which led to the seemingly inevitable New York winner at the death. So much of the Timbers season rolled up into one single match. There are positives to take away. Allowing the young guys to focus on getting forward and contributing offensively has seemed to spark the offense, and Zizzo, Songo'o and Nagbe all seem to be much more involved. But changes will have to be made, either to force the team to maintain its shape, or for major upgrades across the backline, for this new style to flourish in MLS in the coming years.</p> <p>Up next is playoff bound Vancouver in another Cascadia Cup show-down. This one is so hard to read, given the uneven play out of the Timbers recently - and the frankly stronger backline and forward corps of Vancouver gives me pause. Us losing Diego Chara hurts more than Vancouver missing Koffie (both to suspension), and the addition of Robson seems to weight the midfield towards the Whitecaps. Regardless, Jeld-Wen will be rocking, and if Timbers can keep up their new found goal scoring verve, a classic may be in store for those watching.</p> <p><strong>Brenton Walters</strong>, Communications Director, <a href=\"http://vancouversouthsiders.ca/\">Vancouver Southsiders</a>:</p> <p>The Whitecaps are coming off two tough losses: a horrible defeat at home to a resurgent Dallas, then a toothless effort against play-off and Cascadia rivals Seattle. In both games we had slightly disjointed line-ups, and in the second were missing both our starting CBs. The loss to Seattle leaves us at the bottom of the Cascadia Cup race and just 5 points up on Dallas for the fifth and final play-off spot. No one played well against Dallas, a truly disappointing game to watch. At least against Seattle we played well for a portion of the game, though playing well didn't translate into creating chances, and not for the first time this season we went an entire game without registering a shot on net.</p> <p>On Saturday we face an improving Portland side that is finally finding its scoring touch, though their defence can't seem to get it together to match their attack. They've maintained a decent home form, while our away form is merely middling. The return from suspension of Barry Robson and Jay DeMerit from injury should give us hope, though we'll be missing midfielder Gershon Koffie, a young player who has shown very high quality and potential this season.</p> <p>Portland look dangerous on the counter lately, something Seattle used very well against us. Our fullbacks will need to be cautious and alert, especially if our CBs aren't fully in sync. Look for Mattocks and Richard to trouble the shaky Portland backline with their speed, especially if Portland press for the opening goal. With Robson, Thorrington and Davidson in the centre of our 4-3-3, we should dominate a weakened Portland midfield, and if Miller can find his scoring touch we could come away with 3 points. More likely is a hard-fought (and ultimately disappointing) draw.</p> <h2>Chivas USA vs Seattle Sounders, Sat 10.30pm</h2> <p><strong>Alicia Ratterree</strong>, <a href=\"http://www.thegoatparade.com/\">The Goat Parade</a>, Chivas USA:</p> <p>Last week, Chivas USA traveled to the Rocky Mountains to take on the Colorado Rapids, and try and jumpstart their push for the postseason. The ultimate result was mixed, however, as Chivas tied the Rapids 1-1. While Chivas desperately needed a win and three points against the inconsistent Rapids, they started the game very badly, and it appeared they would lose outright. Colorado midfielder Brian Mullan easily stripped the ball from new Goat Shalrie Joseph at the edge of Chivas' box, and put Colorado up 1-0 in the 19th minute. From there, it appeared that Chivas had no chance, but two second half subs, forwards Tristan Bowen and Juan Pablo Angel, linked up for an equalizer in the 83rd minute, and Chivas salvaged a point, somehow.</p> <p>This week, Chivas host the Seattle Sounders at the Home Depot Center. While the Sounders have had some ups and downs this season, they have been playing well lately in the league and will be a very dangerous opponent. For their part, Chivas must find a way to play good two-way soccer for 90 minutes, or else their hopes of moving up the standings will increasingly recede in 2012. Really, at this point, the Goats need to be picking up as many wins as possible, and fans are certainly hoping they can get the job done Saturday.</p> <p><strong>Sam Chesneau</strong>, <a href=\"http://www.gorillafc.com/\">Gorilla FC</a>, Seattle:</p> <p>Its hard to ask for much more than a 2-0 shutout against the Whitecaps. Seattle controlled the flow of the game, played lock down defense by not allowing a single shot on target, and both forwards Fredy Montero &amp; Eddie Johnson each connected with the back of the net. It moved the Sounders back into the Supporters Shield race after former Sounder Lamar Neagle did us a solid and helped Montreal defeat league leading San Jose. </p> <p>This week the rave green face another familiar face in James Riley, as they travel to Carson to battle Chivas USA. Riley may no longer play for us, but his impact on the community is still felt to this day, as he's holding a 7 on 7 tournament this Sunday to benefit the local Boys &amp; Girls club in a city that he no longer lives in. We still love you, James - once a Sounder, always a Sounder. On to this matchup, I will say Chivas has made some interesting changes, and while its been difficult to gauge how new acquisition Shalrie Joseph is acclimating himself with their team, its hard to deny the improvements this franchise has made throughout the year. The only question is which Chivas will show up? Either way, it would be a bit of a let down if the Sounders didn't take 3 points on the road from this team, but it will be difficult getting balls past their keeper Kennedy, as I believe him to be one of the best keepers in MLS. I predict a 1-0 victory, and our keeper Gspurning to continue the dominant display between the sticks.</p> <h2>LA Galaxy vs FC Dallas, Sun 7pm (NBCSN, RDS2)</h2> <p><strong>Josh Guesman</strong>, founder, <a href=\"www.thesection108.com\">The Section 108</a> blog, co-host of <a href=\"http://nasn.tv/category/corner-of-the-galaxy/\">Corner of the Galaxy</a> podcast, LA:</p> <p>In a short week that saw the Galaxy trounce Chivas USA 4-0 on a Sunday, and then make a long trip to Columbus for a midweek clash with the Crew on a Wednesday, the 1-1 draw was both deserved and disappointing. A Goal by Robbie Keane in the second half of play leveled the score, but it was the constant pressure inside the Columbus half that should have resulted in a game-winner. But without Landon Donovan (US Men's National Team Duty) and David Beckham (Olympics) a 1 point result is palatable, especially against an emotional Columbus team playing their first game since the sudden passing of Kirk Urso.</p> <p>With the short break in league play, the Galaxy will now be able to set their focus on the start of the CONCACAF Champions League (CCL) on Thursday night against Isidro Metapan, before facing off in a Sunday matinee against a resurgent FC Dallas.&#xa0;Dallas has won their last two game on the road defeating both Vancouver and Real Salt Lake. And while FC Dallas looks to move into a playoff position it will be up to the Galaxy, currently in 4th place, to solidify their hold on their playoff hopes and put some distance between those scuffling to get into the picture.&#xa0;</p> <p>All three LA Galaxy designated players should be available for the upcoming matches, as well as the Championship back four of Dunivant, Gonzalez, DeLaGarza and Franklin. If Juninho can continue his improvements and the Galaxy find goals from Landon Donovan and Robbie Keane, look for the Galaxy to make a statement in both the CCL and League matches this week. Anything short of 3 points from Dallas would be a setback for the Galaxy.</p> <p><strong>Gina Zippilli</strong>, <a href=\"http://the-inferno.net\">The Inferno</a>, Dallas:</p> <p>The last game went well - any time you get 3 points at Rio Tinto you can't say many bad things. We scored a very late winner and the team just looked confident throughout - these two road wins are pretty huge given what's happened this season so far. I read a practice report from training the other day that said for the first time this season that nobody's rehabbing, so the team are getting their fitness back, but also their discipline too - the stupid cards have generally gone. I've been out of the country for a few weeks and when I left Brek Shea was in the doghouse - I get back and he's starring against Mexico and committing for Dallas. What caused the general turnaround? I hate to pin it on one player, but I think it really helps that David Ferreira is back. He's creating chances and making people around him raise their game.</p> <p>This weekend we're at LA - which is never an easy place to go. But we're coming off a win at Rio Tinto - something I've never been able to say before. And historically we've got results in Carson. There's no reason we can't get a draw in a very big game, given its play-off implications.</p> <h2>Sporting KC vs New York Red Bulls, Sun 9pm (ESPN2, ESPND, GOL TV Canada, RDS2)</h2> <p><strong>Guardian live game</strong></p> <p><strong>Malena Barajas</strong>, co-founder, <a href=\"http://womenunitedfc.com/\">Women United FC</a>, Sporting Kansas City:</p> <p>Sporting KC is coming off a 1-0 road win against Toronto FC - a win that put the team at the top of the Eastern Conference and two points ahead of this week's opponent, the New York Red Bulls. This is the first of three matches SKC and NYRB will play over the last three months of the season. The Eastern Conference is heating up, and no doubt, this match will be hard-fought for both teams.</p> <p>Against Toronto, the lone goal came from SKC's leading scorer, Kei Kamara. Expect Kamara to be a threat against NYRB as he and Teal Bunbury continue to work well with one another. That being said, an appearance by CJ Sapong as a substitute could very well produce the game winner. Last week, NYRB goal keeper Bill Gaudette came up strong for NYRB with some great saves in a 3-2 comeback at home against the Portland Timbers. Still, Gaudette will need help to shut down SKC's attack. SKC's strongest back line - Chance Myers, Matt Besler, Aurelien Collin and Seth Sinovic - will likely start and will work to stop NYRB Kenny Cooper's hunt for goals. Cooper is four goals behind the MLS leading scorer Chris Wondolowski of San Jose.</p> <p>Myers and Collin are each a yellow card away from a one-match suspension, but don't count on these guys being shy. SKC will play aggressively, fueled by the Livestrong Sporting Park atmosphere created by the very passionate Cauldron - something it will be without in its upcoming bouts against NYRB, to be played at Red Bull Arena.</p> <p><strong>Ian Thomson</strong>, <a href=\"http://thesoccerobserver.com\">The Soccer Observer</a>, New York:</p> <p>New York Red Bulls visit Kansas City Sunday after collecting just two points from their past six away games \u2013 a stretch including blowout losses in Chicago, New England, Montreal and Houston. Nine home wins have kept Hans Backe's extravagant $16 million squad in contention for the Supporters' Shield, though it remains unclear whether the Swedish head coach knows his strongest line-up. Top scorer Kenny Cooper sat on the sidelines again last weekend, displaced by Sebastien Le Toux, as Portland Timbers raced into a 2-0 lead at Red Bull Arena. Fortunately Backe has shed his aversion to the substitutes' bench this year. Cooper's first-half introduction saw him haul New York back into the game before whistle-happy referee Jasen Anno aided the comeback.</p> <p>Recent back-to-back clashes with Houston will have prepared New York for Sporting's 4-3-3 system. Peter Vermes' side has recovered from a mid-season slump, and Backe must find a way to combat Sporting's numerical superiority in central midfield \u2013 an issue he failed to address in Texas on Aug. 3. Backe's wide players must stay alert to the foraging runs of full-backs Seth Sinovic and Chance Myers. His defense, the fifth worst in the league, cannot be pulled out of shape by the criss-crossing runs of Kei Kamara, Teal Bunbury and Graham Zusi.</p> <p>Previous road performances suggest that this challenge could be beyond the Red Bulls.</p>",
  "<p>This week I helped launch the <a href=\"http://cfor.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Conservative Friends of Russia</a>, a group for those with an interest in Russian politics, history, business and culture. Our aim is to improve relations between the two countries, provide a forum for open debate and help to inform decision making in business and politics.</p> <p>The \"Friends of \u2026\" model is familiar within British political parties \u2013 there are many such groups including those dedicated to America, Israel, India, Poland and Azerbaijan \u2013 but there has never been one for Russia, which is unusual given the size of its economy and its importance on the international stage.</p> <p>Whether we like it or not, Russia is an influential and essential part of the international community and its importance will only grow over time. We need to stop making decisions based on misconceptions that are decades old, and deal with reality.</p> <p>Britain is in a difficult economic state and should be looking to remove barriers to trade and employment, particularly with a country bursting with natural resources. Currently, many businesses are struggling to trade because of visa complications that could be easily resolved by politicians, but few are prepared to sit down and listen to businessmen trading with Russia. We provide a forum to enable that engagement and to amplify the voices of the unheard.</p> <p>There are many areas of potential co-operation between the UK and Russia. Energy is an obvious one. With prices rising rapidly in Britain, why ignore the one country with an overwhelming amount of natural resources? Science and technology is another, with the two countries investigating co-operation in space.</p> <p>Increasingly in need of the finances brought by foreign students, UK universities welcome about 20,000 Russians each year. Surely we owe them a warm welcome and a positive learning environment rather than assuming they are all spies?</p> <p>We must remember, however, that being a Friend of Russia is not the same as being a Friend of the Russian government. By that reckoning, our Conservative members were not friends of Britain between 1997 and 2010 and we can assume that the entire British public colluded in the \"dodgy dossier\" and the expenses scandal. It is simply small-minded prejudice to discount a friendship group on the basis of the actions of the few. I've seen some astonishing examples of this in the past week.</p> <p>It's certainly not the easiest of times for a group with an interest in Russian politics. Some recent decisions have been alien to our way of thinking, given our now largely secular society and long history of democracy. Russia, on the other hand, is an extremely religious country and democracy there is only just approaching its 21st birthday. Rather than immediately denouncing everything we see, why not listen to the full arguments from a variety of sources and form an opinion based on facts and information rather than ignorance and emotive reflex?</p> <p>There will always be differences of opinion in politics and this is true between all nations. Each has to deal with its own unique circumstances and there is no one-size-fits-all solution. What is important is having a forum within which different opinions can be heard, exchanged and discussed, and this is the purpose of CFoR.</p> <p>We absolutely understood that we were embarking on a controversial project that many would try to strangle at birth. However, in contrast to the comments of armchair critics on Twitter who have not attended our events, my inbox is bursting with positive messages of support from attendees of all backgrounds \u2013 students, businesses, MPs, charities and cultural organisations. Many media outlets have praised our bravery in tackling a thorny but necessary subject. Certainly, our membership has expanded rapidly in the past few days. I like to live by the adage that fortune favours the bold, and I believe that beyond the initial hysteria, CFoR will have an extremely promising and positive future.</p>",
  "<p>The <a href=\"http://thesullivanfoundation.org/\" title=\"\">Leon H Sullivan Foundation</a>, founded on the legacy of the late civil rights leader and anti-apartheid pioneer Reverend Sullivan, is <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/aug/22/equatorial-guinea-human-rights\" title=\"\">holding its ninth biennial Sullivan summit in Equatorial Guinea this week</a>. In doing so, it is disregarding a global standard of principles created by its namesake and championed by the organisation.</p> <p>The summit, whose theme is \"Africa rising\", is being billed, in part, as a human rights conference. The organisation's choice of host, Equatorial Guinea, has provoked an outcry from many African and international human rights groups over concerns that the summit will be used to polish the <a href=\"http://www.amnesty.org/en/region/equatorial-guinea\" title=\"\">tarnished human rights record</a> of Equatorial Guinea's President Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo. The Obiang regime, in power for 33 years, has been widely criticised for rights abuses, repression, and corruption.</p> <p>In response to critics, the foundation appears to have embarked on a public relations campaign for the Obiang regime. In <a href=\"http://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;ved=0CCMQFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Flhsfound.accountsupport.com%2Fwp-content%2Fthemes%2Fgreen-apples%2Fimages%2FPress%2520Release%2520may%252010%5B4%5D.pdf&amp;ei=lVk3UIPFB8i-0QX3_YCIDg&amp;usg=AFQjCNGw0riO1mDHDUX5QRqP7IUGiAutTg\" title=\"\">a May press release</a> (pdf), the foundation claimed that the Sullivan summit \"will showcase to the international community the advancement Equatorial Guinea has made in human development and the human rights arena\", and alleged that President Obiang is \"clearly misunderstood by western countries and human rights organisations\".</p> <p>On 6 August, the foundation's CEO, Hope Masters, challenged critics, referring to reports of abuse and corruption in Equatorial Guinea as \"outrageous\", \"tawdry\" and \"outdated\". She has accused her critics of failing to check facts or verify \"simple truths\".</p> <p>So we checked the facts and measured them against the <a href=\"http://thesullivanfoundation.org/about/global-sullivan-principles\" title=\"\">global Sullivan principles</a>, a corporate code of conduct initiated by Sullivan that remains a leading standard of corporate social responsibility championed by the Sullivan Foundation. If the principles were applied to the regime of President Obiang, would it pass the test? We tweaked the principles to make them applicable to a government instead of a corporation.</p> <h2>The global Sullivan principles of social responsibility</h2> <blockquote> <p>As a <strong>government </strong>which endorses the global Sullivan principles we will respect the law, and as a responsible member of society we will apply these principles with integrity consistent with the legitimate role of governing.

The government <a href=\"http://www.egjustice.org/post/liberty-denied-equatorial-guinea\" title=\"\">has thwarted</a> several recent attempts to hold peaceful protests.

It said public funding of the education sector was insufficient and \"well below the expenditure of countries in the region\". Consequently, only one in two students completes primary education. In 2011, the <a href=\"http://hdrstats.undp.org/en/countries/profiles/GNQ.html\" title=\"\">government spent just 0.7% of GDP on education</a>, far below the average 3.9% spent by other sub-Saharan African countries. In addition, a majority of the population <a href=\"http://www.hrw.org/news/2012/07/16/equatorial-guinea-unesco-s-shameful-award\" title=\"\">still lacks adequate access</a> to basic services such as electricity and running water.</p> <p><strong>Principle No 5: </strong>Provide a safe and healthy place to live; protect human health and the environment; and promote sustainable development.</p> <p><strong>Regime's record: </strong>According to <a href=\"http://www.childinfo.org/files/Child_Mortality_Report_2011.pdf\" title=\"\">the UN</a>, nearly one in eight children die before age five in Equatorial Guinea. The World Bank said in its 2010 report that, unlike most countries of sub-Saharan Africa, Equatorial Guinea has the financial means to improve the health of its population, but that \"insufficient resources [are] allocated to the health sector, as evidenced by the general deterioration of facilities, the breakdown of medical equipment, and the inability of the budget to cover remuneration of personnel.\"</p> <p><strong>Principle No 6: </strong>Promote good governance including respect for intellectual and other property rights, and not offer, pay or accept bribes.</p> <p><strong>Regime's record: </strong>Government corruption is widespread.

That is freedom of extortion and blackmail,\" he said in response to concerns about recent crackdowns on private news organisations.</p> <p>Days before the Ecuadorean government granted asylum to the WikiLeaks founder and promoted itself as a guardian of freedom of expression, riot police in Quito raided the offices of one of the country's leading magazines, Vanguardia. They confiscated journalists' computers and prevented publication for a week, ostensibly as a punishment for labour law violations.</p> <p>It was the second time in less than two years that Vanguardia had been raided. Its journalists are also getting death threats after being denounced by the president during his weekly TV show, and the magazine's editorial director was recently sued by Correa for $10m in \"moral damages\" for suggesting the president knew his brother was making millions of dollars from state contracts.</p> <p>After a public outcry, the president withdrew one suit and issued a pardon in the other, but he defended his right to take such action: \"Do we have an unwritten law that we can't sue a journalist? Since when? So nobody should sue Murdoch and his partners in crime in Britain?\"</p> <p>The editorial director of Vanguardia, Juan Carlos Calder\u00f3n, had earlier told the Guardian he was being targeted for criticising the administration, and accused Correa of double standards. \"The government said it has granted asylum to Assange because he is politically persecuted for defending freedom of expression. But the same thing happens to us,\" he said. \"This is not a country with the free press described by Correa.\"</p> <p>He is not alone. The domestic press watchdog Fundamedios describes the situation in Ecuador as a low-intensity war on journalists that appears to be escalating. Last year, it recorded 151 cases of physical aggression against reporters, up from 101 in 2009. It says this increase is largely the result of the constant abuse directed at journalists by Correa during his weekly TV broadcast, which is carried by almost every channel.</p> <p>It also notes that 17 radio stations have been shut down this year for transgressing regulations and that the government has recently issued new rules that will oblige internet service providers to provide the IP addresses of their users to the authorities, even without a court order.</p> <p>\"There is a huge gap between what Correa says about press freedom and reality,\" said C\u00e9sar Ricaurte, head of Fundamedios. \"If Assange were Ecuadorean, I dare say he would already be in jail.\" International free press campaigners, including the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) and Reporters Without Borders, have also accused Correa of trying to discredit and intimidate critics.</p> <p>Correa said such judgments were misguided. \"The Ecuadorean and Latin American press is not like the European or North American press, which has some professional ethics. They are used to being above the law, to blackmail, to extort. I am sorry about good people on an international level who defend this kind of press.\"</p> <p>He denied that radio station closures were politically motivated, saying some were simply music channels that failed to conform to broadcasting rules. This will open up space for more public channels.</p> <p>An insight into Correa's strategy was given by his chief communications adviser, Fernando Alvarado who described the media as \"weeds that need to be cleaned\" and replaced by flowers (public and community media outlets) in a recent interview with the Mexican publication Gatopardo.Since Correa \u2013 a US-educated economist who describes himself as a moderate leftist \u2013 came to power in 2007, there has been a wider range of state and private ownership of newspapers and TV stations. There is more scope for critical non-governmental organisations and greater access to senior officials. The interviews given by Correa on Thursday were carefully staged in terms of lighting and camera work, but unscripted.</p> <p>Media watchers said Correa's approach -\u2013 particularly in his weekly live broadcasts \u2013 was as confrontational as that adopted by Hugo Ch\u00e1vez in Venezuela, but less destructive. \"In some regards, it is like Ch\u00e1vez. But Ch\u00e1vez went too far. Though there is confrontation here, no TV stations have been closed, which was the case in Venezuela,\" said Maurice Cerbino, a professor at Andina Simon Bolivar University. The confrontation, he said, was understandable given the previous situation in Ecuador in which the private media colluded with the government.</p> <p>Correa's supporters say the administration is carrying out an overdue rebalancing of the media, which was previously skewed too heavily towards private ownership by a handful of families. When Correa came to power in 2007, there was only one public media organisation, Radio Nacional.</p> <p>Those who work in public media say this has created a far healthier media environment because advertisers have less influence. \"The reports by the Committee to Protect Journalists and Amnesty are not false, but a lot of them are exaggerated,\" said Orlando P\u00e9rez, the editorial director of El Tel\u00e9grafo.</p> <p>\"Ecuador is going through a golden age for media freedom. Citizens now have so much space for expression, through social networks, public media, community media as well as blogs and websites.\" To demonstrate his editorial independence, he pointed to a front-page story in his public newspaper exposing a corruption in the state-owned oil company PetroEcuador.</p> <p>P\u00e9rez claims to have set the stage for Assange's first interview with Correa, which later lead to asylum. He denies that this has anything to do with a government strategy. \"We didn't choose Assange. Assange chose us,\" he said.</p> <p>Correa said he was trying to support an individual threatened by a powerful state. \"I don't agree with everything Mr Assange did. I never said that. But I believe he is entitled to a just legal process,\" the president said. \"Assange never stole the information. It was handed to him by Bradley Manning. He just distributed it. So why didn't the newspapers that published it also get sanctioned? That is an international double standard. The answer is that the newspapers have power, whereas Mr Assange is just a citizen. That is why certain countries want to crush him with all their weight.\"</p> <p>His motives are widely disputed. Some accept the president's idealistic claims. Cynics say he is trying to distract attention from the criticism of his heavy handling of the domestic media. Another theory is that he is a political opportunist who understands the benefits of picking high-profile fights, in this case, with the UK. Having gone further than any other Latin American leader outside of Argentina in criticising Britain over the Falklands earlier this year, he has now found a new cause. William Hague's threat to remove the diplomatic status of the Ecuadorean embassy simply played into his hands.</p> <p>\"The UK foreign minister has given him the perfect excuse to unite the left in a confrontation with imperialists,\" Calder\u00f3n observes. \"People on the left have an anti-imperialist gland. All you have to do it touch it to secrete anthems (of solidarity).\"</p> <p>But the decision to grant asylum has made waves inside Ecuador's government. Career bureaucrats are uneasy at a decision made by political appointees. Some feel it is of dubious legality and could backfire in terms of trade with the European Union. On the streets, however, the move appears to have widespread public backing. There were demonstrations of support in Quito this week. Women's groups have even seconded Correa's claim that the accusations against Assange would not constitute felonies in Latin America.</p> <p>\"I totally agree with the decision to grant asylum to Assange,\" said Virginia G\u00f3mez, former director of the Attention and Help Centre for Women. \"The allegations against Assange would not be crimes here. Women are empowered, but not to the point that if a condom breaks it is a sex crime. That is beyond our imagination.\"</p> <p>Quito is no place for the politically half-hearted. Local people are proud of their radicalism and burn effigies of politicians \u2013 including the current president \u2013 at raucous New Year's Eve parades. Many feel it is their duty to kick out poorly performing leaders, something they have done with remarkable regularity.</p> <p>After just five years in power, Correa is the longest-serving president in a century. US embassy cables leaked by WikiLeaks described him as the most popular president the country had ever had. Without exception, everyone interviewed for this story said Correa had been good for Ecuador. Even the fiercest critics of his media policies praised the president's work on health and education. As his cavalcade drove up to the interview venue, girls leaned out of the window and screamed as if they had seen a rock star.</p> <p>The question now is whether the Assange case will consolidate or erode this popularity if it drags on until the presidential elections next February. Correa was unwilling to speculate. \"I am an economist, not an astrologer. I can't say how long it will take. It could be solved tomorrow. It depends on the UK. Or it could take a long time. What is the next step? Keep talking. We have never closed the door to conversation. From the beginning, we have been talking to Britain, Sweden and even the USA to solve this situation. But we will never lower our principles or risk the life or rights of Assange.\"</p>",
  "<p>This month <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/aug/23/arctic-sea-ice-record-low\" title=\"\">we are expecting to see a record ice melt in the Arctic</a>. But this is not a world record we can celebrate. This is a wake-up call from planet Earth.</p> <p>Just 30 years ago, the Arctic Ocean ice cap covered an area roughly the size of Australia. Within a few decades, it will almost certainly disappear completely for the summer months. This will be the first time a seasonally ice-free Arctic Ocean has existed for many thousands of years. The Earth without the white area at the top of the world will look radically different from <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earthrise\" title=\"\">those first photographs we took of our home planet from space</a> just four decades ago. Those first pictures of the tiny, vulnerable, yet beautiful Earth led in part to the environmental movement. And now this movement has to dramatically change gear in response to what is happening.</p> <p>The Arctic is home to millions of people, including Inuit whose ancestors first settled thousands of years ago. It is also a unique ecosystem, home to some of the most extraordinary species on Earth, from the narwhal to the walrus to the polar bear. For hundreds of other migratory species, including humpback whales and Canada geese, it is a vital summer feeding ground.</p> <p>The amazing Arctic also plays a critical role in regulating our climate. The Arctic sea ice is like a giant mirror that reflects much of the sun's energy, helping to keep our planet cool. The formation of Arctic sea ice produces dense salt water which sinks, helping drive the deep ocean currents. Without the ice, this delicate balance will be upset and could cause profound regional and global climatic changes.</p> <p>We all rely on the Arctic for our survival. And now we are in danger of losing one of the world's great ecosystems and an important life support system leaving all species facing an increasingly insecure and uncertain future.</p> <p>But paradoxically, right now, no species will profit from it as much as the one causing it: humans.</p> <p>Oil companies do not like to talk about this. But at this moment, energy companies like Shell are preparing to invade areas of the Arctic Ocean that were once protected by the ice. They're desperate to claim the oil that lies beneath the seabed, so they can make more money, by burning more fuel, and melting more ice. It's a vicious circle driven by greed.</p> <p>But we know that, sooner or later, we are going to have to move on to some other source of energy that isn't oil. This is inevitable.</p> <p>The oil that flows from beneath the Arctic Ocean is destined to run out. It only holds three years' worth of global supply. If there was an oil spill, similar to the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/apr/22/oil-spill-arctic-analysis\" title=\"\">Exxon Valdez</a> or <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/interactive/2010/jul/08/bp-oil-spill-timeline-interactive\" title=\"\">Deepwater Horizon</a>, it could be catastrophic for Arctic marine life.</p> <p>We should now declare the destruction of such a unique place as an act of vandalism on an unprecedented scale and take action to stop it. And we must also invest in new, greener sources of energy and energy efficiency.</p> <p>There must be a global sanctuary declared in the High Arctic and the Arctic Ocean made off limits to the oil industry and unsustainable, high impact, industrial fishing. We have developed a plan that can make this a reality if millions of people join us.</p> <p>This is perhaps the environment movement's biggest challenge ever. But we've done it before. Just over 20 years ago, Antarctica was at risk from industrialisation and militarisation. Greenpeace led the campaign to protect it. We won that campaign.</p> <p>And now we're determined to save the Arctic. We know this is a different fight, at a different time; not least because the Arctic is home to millions of people who have a critical say in the future of their region; and because the threat is not just from industrial development, but from the global crisis of climate change. But one critical factor remains the same: the united voice of millions of ordinary citizens can still be an irresistible agent of political change.</p> <p>This is <a href=\"http://www.savethearctic.org/\" title=\"\">a hugely ambitious campaign</a>. That's why we need people and organisations around the world to help save the Arctic. Everyone has to grab this historic moment and reclaim the earth that belongs to us all.</p>",
  "<p>Ken Nottage this month stepped down as Gloucester's managing director, ending an association with rugby union that started when the game turned professional in 1995.</p> <p>Nottage, a former England basketball international who was born in Canada and raised in London, worked with two of the most influential men in the club game following the switch from amateurism, Sir John Hall at Newcastle and the late Tom Walkinshaw at Gloucester.</p> <p>When he started work in the north-east in 1995, it was as the basketball director of Hall's Newcastle Sporting Club, which also took in rugby union, ice hockey and football. He had only just started work when he was summoned to meet Sir John, his son, Douglas, and Freddie Shepherd, all directors of Newcastle United.</p> <p>\"I went there expecting the worst having been told to arrive bang on 9am \u2013 don't be late,\" said Nottage. \"I was told they needed to have a discussion with me, but I did not have a clue what about. It turned out that they had had second thoughts about the person they had appointed as the chief executive of Newcastle Sporting Club and released him from his contract.</p> <p>\"I was offered the job and found myself in the deep end. The sporting club only dealt with elements of football. Rugby had only just turned professional and Rob Andrew had been appointed as director. It was not a sport I knew much about and he had to field numerous questions.</p> <p>\"He was very good with me, very supportive and helpful, no matter how stupid my inquiry might have been. I have always had a lot of time for him. He has taken a lot of stick recently in his role with the Rugby Football Union, but what I would say is that since he has been at Twickenham, the relationship between the Premiership clubs and the Union has developed considerably. Disputes used to occur on almost a weekly basis, but they are now rare. Rob deserves credit for that.\"</p> <p>Many of the early disputes were at Sir John Hall's instigation. He at one point challenged the right of the RFU and the International Rugby Board to impose their regulations on clubs. It culminated with the English clubs pulling out of Europe, but the boycott lasted one season and Hall then lost interest in rugby.</p> <p>\"Sir John had a clear vision,\" said Nottage, who will still be involved at Gloucester as a non-executive director. \"He was the driving force behind the professional club game and was prepared to fight battles. After four years, he decided he wanted to concentrate on football and he got out of rugby.\"</p> <p>As Nottage contemplated life without Hall, he received a call from Tom Walkinshaw, the Gloucester owner. \"He said he wanted to talk to me about coming to Kingsholm and, if I was interested, he would like to meet me.</p> <p>\"I found myself on a train from Newcastle to London and then standing outside Twickenham at a spot designated by Tom. I was looking out for his car when all of a sudden there was a noise and, as I looked behind me, a helicopter landed in the car park.</p> <p>\"Out stepped Tom and he said: 'I would like you to come to Gloucester. What do you earn?' I told him and he replied: 'I will pay you this. Let me know what you want to do.' And with that he was back in his helicopter and off. The meeting had lasted no more than three minutes. I made up my mind to accept on the train back to Newcastle.</p> <p>\"Tom was a tough negotiator and a very creative man. When I arrived at Gloucester, our average attendance was some 4,400 and the club was losing some \u00a31.5m a year. We are now in profit and nearly always generate a five-figure gate. His attitude was that if you got it right on the pitch, the rest would follow and as the recruitment of Philippe Saint-Andr\u00e9 proved successful, so we started to take off commercially.</p> <p>\"Philippe oozed charisma and was on his own as a recruiter. You just knew that he would coach France one day. I still speak to him and it was a thoroughly enjoyable time working with him. I remember going to Tom's villa in the early days: he was talking about players and suddenly decided he was going to make an approach to Jonah Lomu. He was on the case immediately.</p> <p>\"That was Tom. When he was in Australia, you could expect a phone call from him in the middle of the night. He would never apologise for the lateness but would ask what had been going on. He was enthusiastic about Gloucester and rugby and I suppose his death at the end of 2010 was a watershed for me. I have been at Gloucester for 13 terrific years and it is time to move on.\"</p> <p>Nottage has left Gloucester in strong shape off the field, one of the few Premiership clubs who are in profit, but on it they faded at the end of last season and now have a largely new coaching team, headed by Nigel Davies, the former Wales international who joined in the close season from Scarlets.</p> <p>\"A strength of Gloucester is the passion the supporters have from the club,\" said Nottage. \"It is a rugby city and the club matters to people. The ingredients for success are there and I am sure it will not be long in coming.\"</p> <p>This week has seen Premiership Rugby threaten to set up an Anglo-French tournament in protest at the way the Heineken Cup is run, a return to the skirmishes that used to bedevil the game in England.</p> <p>\"The clubs have concerns but I am sure a solution will be found,\" said Nottage. \"We found in the early years that the fighting between the RFU and the clubs could be detrimental to the game. All the owners want to run their clubs as proper businesses, but we should never forget that clubs are big boys' train sets: they all want the biggest and best. They put their money in: Tom's personal investment in Gloucester would have been some \u00a38m; not surprisingly, he wanted to make the decisions.\"</p> <p>Nottage starts work next month as the chief executive of the Three Counties Agricultural Society in Malvern. \"I will be doing something completely different,\" he said, \"but I will be on Gloucester's board for another year and will be on hand if needed. The club is very much a part of me.\"</p> <p><strong><em>\u2022 </em></strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/signup/thebreakdown\" title=\"\"><strong><em>This is an extract from the Breakdown, our free weekly take on the world of rugby.

  "<p>When Anders Behring Breivik announced in the spring of 2011 that he was moving out of Oslo to become a farmer, his friends were pleased.</p> <p>After five years dossing about unemployed at his mum's flat, including 12 months playing video games day and night, Breivik finally appeared to have found some direction.</p> <p>In April 2011, just before he left the capital, the then 32-year-old hosted a barbecue for six friends. He was upping sticks to a farm near Rena, a town two hours north-east of Oslo, to grow sugar beet, he said. It was a bit of a curveball, but not totally out of character.</p> <p>Breivik, after all, was a man whose professional life had already taken some unusual twists, including an unsuccessful trip to Liberia to buy blood diamonds and a business selling fake degree certificates.</p> <p>\"I thought it was good that he moved out of his mother's house,\" one of his friends, a fireman, told Oslo central court. Breivik appeared to have regained his \"spark\" and his friends were relieved. They had worried about his increasingly erratic behaviour.</p> <p>At a party earlier in the year, he had announced he was not drinking as he was taking anabolic steroids and he had been banging on about Muslims \"seizing power\" in Norway. Then there was the book he had been writing about the Islamification of Europe, plus the mysterious nose job, undergone, apparently, after someone accused him of having an \"Arab nose\". One friend said he had never been the same after being jilted by a Belarusian girl he had met online.</p> <p>Others thought he was struggling with his sexuality after he started wearing makeup.</p> <p>In June last year, another friend, a lawyer, remembered meeting him in a cafe, where Breivik talked about the government subsidies available for farmers. \"I thought perhaps he had now emerged from his depression,\" said the lawyer.</p> <p>Little did they know that what Breivik was cultivating on the isolated farmyard was not sugar beet but a lethal bomb, which would kill eight people and injure more than 200 others.</p> <p>Curious about his rural life, they kept trying to visit but Breivik fobbed them off.</p> <p>\"For natural reasons I had to do everything I could to avoid this from happening,\" Breivik told the court. \"Gradually there was more pressure; they would say 'Why do you not want us to come up there?'</p> <p>On a couple of occasions they tried to drive up and a couple of times I had to turn off my mobile to avert visits \u2026 Only thing that went in my favour was there was no street address for the farm so they didn't find out where it was.\"</p> <p>Had the friends found the farm, they would have discovered Breivik in a chemical warfare suit, grinding up ammonium nitrate pills using four kitchen blenders \u2013 a technique he said he had copied from Andreas Baader of the Red Army Faction, the German terror group also known as the Baader Meinhof gang. Or perhaps strapping himself up with rucksacks, one front and one back, each containing 30kg of rocks, ready to go out training to build up his strength for what he anticipated would be a physically strenuous \"mission\".</p> <p>If they had arrived one afternoon during a storm they might have found him a mile away from the farm, waiting for a thunder clap so he could detonate a test charge.</p> <p>Breivik had thought of everything, each tiny detail that ensured his plan could be executed with dreadful accuracy. There was the \"sorry: sewage works\" sign he put in the window of the rented van he loaded with explosives and parked in Oslo city centre the day before the attacks (\"I was very concerned about passersby. These are chemicals that have a very strong smell.\"); the parking ticket he remembered to buy for the Fiat Doplo he used as a getaway car; the precise calculation on how many acres of farmland he would need to rent to justify the quantities of fertiliser he would be ordering.</p> <p>But perhaps the worst manifestation of Breivik's scrupulous attention to detail was the police uniform he bought on the internet and then wore to sail to the island of Ut\u00f8ya, having called ahead and convinced one of the adults running the annual summer camp of the ruling Labour Party's youth wing that he had been sent to reassure the teenagers in the aftermath of the Oslo bombings. They sent over a ferry to pick him up. An hour and 20 minutes later he had shot dead 67 of those people he claimed he had been sent to protect; one 17-year-old fell off a cliff and died trying to dodge Breivik's bullets. Another, also 17, drowned trying to escape.</p> <p>He'd had enough time to mull things over. By his own account, his twin attacks that left 77 dead had been five years in the making. The prosecution could find evidence of two years of determined planning: membership of an Oslo shooting club, jaunts around Europe buying guns and ammunition, internet transactions for fertiliser, military uniforms and other equipment.</p> <p>Breivik claimed he started plotting the attacks in earnest in 2006. After winding up his business ventures, he moved out of a shared flat and back in with his mother, Wenche Behring, who was single again after the breakup of her third marriage; her second,<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/apr/13/anders-behring-breivik-norway\" title=\"\"> to Breivik's father, Jens</a>, had gone sour when Breivik was just one.</p> <p>In the summer of that year, Breivik announced he was going to take a sabbatical to play the role-playing computer game World of Warcraft full-time. He deserved a break, he said, after four years working \"12\u201314 hour days\". Since dropping out of school, when not working in a call centre, he had cooked up various entrepreneurial schemes, including the lucrative fake diploma scam and a number of less successful companies selling telephone marketing services and outdoor advertising space.</p> <p>\"Some people take a year off playing golf. I wanted to take a year off to play World of Warcraft,\" he told the court. \"Especially bearing in mind the upcoming so-called suicide action \u2026 I wanted to have no remorse as to what I had missed out on.\"</p> <p>It was all part of his desensitisation plan, he insisted, of removing himself from normal life so that he could transform himself into a cold-blooded killer. \"In many ways it is a protection mechanism,\" he said. \"If you are going to be capable of executing such a bloody and horrendous operation, you need to work on your mind, your psyche, for years. We have seen from military traditions you cannot send an unprepared person into war.\"</p> <p>His family and friends fell for his cover story, he said. \"I played on the idea that 'Ooh, I've become addicted to games'.\" His sister, who lived in Los Angeles, thought he was in \"deep trouble, a games addict\", said Breivik. His mother was aghast, which was, he said, \"a fairly normal, healthy reaction. It would have been quite abnormal if she had just said, 'Oh, that's great, go ahead'. I couldn't tell her I was taking a sabbatical because I was going to blow myself up in five years' time.\"</p> <p>Under cross examination, Breivik admitted his mother was his \"achilles heel\" and \"the only one who can make me emotionally unstable\". He told the court he would urge his mother, a solitary woman, to find a hobby, but she would tell him, \"You're my hobby\".</p> <p>Wenche Behring had been called as a witness for the prosecution but did not attend court after being signed off by a doctor. She told psychiatrists assessing her son's mental health that he acted strangely after moving back in with her, sometimes sitting on top of her on the sofa or attempting to kiss her face. In a statement to police read out in court, she said: \"I felt like I was in prison with him. He was uncomfortably intense. He started saying I was a Marxist and a feminist. From 2010 he became really strange.\" The court heard how she had been frightened of him as a small boy. When he was just four, she called in social workers who wanted to remove the disturbed boy and put him in a foster home to prevent any further psychological disintegration.</p> <p>Breivik always claimed that while he operated as a \"one-man cell\" in order not to be \"flagged\" by the security services, he was a member of a shadowy cadre of anti-Islamists called the Knights Templar (KT).</p> <p>When he finally called police to surrender on Ut\u00f8ya, he introduced himself to the telephone operator as \"Commander of the Knights Templar Europe \u2013 we are organised in the anti-communistic and Norwegian resistance movement against the Islamisation of Europe and Norway.\"</p> <p>He claimed to have been at the group's inaugural meeting in London in April 2002, a pow-wow the prosecution do not believe ever happened, even though Border Agency data showed he was in the UK at that time. Investigators believe KT \"does not exist\", at least not in the way Breivik describes it.</p> <p>In police and psychiatric interviews, as well as in court, he has refused to reveal any details of the group's other members, including a British man whom he calls Richard the Lionheart in the 1,801-page compendium he compiled before the attacks to explain his motives.</p> <p>Breivik's travels in 2002 were one of the most disputed parts of his trial. Evidence from his passport proved that he had indeed gone to Liberia and then London via the Ivory Coast that spring, but what exactly he was doing there remains unclear.</p> <p>The prosecution believes he had fallen victim to a Nigerian internet scam and was hoping to get rich quick in the war-torn country by trading in so-called blood diamonds. But Breivik insisted the diamonds were a smoke screen, another cover story. Yes, he had bought diamond-cutting paraphernalia in Oslo and had gathered some Unicef brochures to take in his hand luggage in case he needed to pretend he was an aid worker, he said. But his true purpose was to meet a \"<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/apr/18/anders-behring-breivik-serb-nationalists\" title=\"\">Serbian warlord</a>\" who, he said, was going to school him in the methods of \"militant nationalism\" .</p> <p>It was the Nato invasion of Serbia in 1999 that prompted the foundation of the KT, he said: \"That was the straw which broke the camel's back for many brothers who chose to go militant.\"</p> <p>But there were also personal experiences on the streets of Oslo that Breivik said contributed to his radicalisation. Though his friends disputed it in evidence, he claimed to have been involved \"in around 20 confrontations with Muslims in Norway\", including one which left him with a broken nose (hence the rhinoplasty). He had tried to fight against immigration using legitimate means, he said. He joined the Norwegian Progress party, he became a mason, he wrote letters to newspapers that were never printed and was an enthusiastic commenter on internet articles. Until 2006 he had no intention of taking up arms, he insisted, but instead chose to contribute financially to the fight against Islam (hence his money-making schemes).</p> <p>But in 2006, fed up at being ignored and disgusted by those he described as \"keyboard warriors\", he resolved to carry out what he called a \"mission\". With no job to take up his time, he spent months on the internet, practising his shooting on video games and reading voraciously about other terror attacks. He read the English-language media and schooled himself in al-Qaida's terror tactics by using Google Translate to understand terror manuals he found on the internet.</p> <p>He was particularly interested in the specifics of attacks. He noted that after Timothy McVeigh killed 168 people in the 1995 Oklahoma City bombings, the security services had banned the sale of fertiliser containing 98% ammonium nitrate. \"Following that attack, the EU and US governments decided to dilute ammonium nitrate \u2026 to 85%,\" he said, \"and there was an understanding among everyone that it would not detonate.\"</p> <p>With noticeable pride, he told the court he set himself a challenge to try to make a bomb out of this diluted chemical. Unfortunately, he succeeded.</p> <p>He was alert to mainstream politics just as much as the fringes, noting that \"Sarkozy, Merkel and Cameron have all said that multiculturalism has failed.\" He had studied recent history and was disgusted to see what happens \"any time the nationalist parties take over power\". He cited as examples the partial EU boycott after J\u00f6rg Haider's far-right Freedom party entered Austria's government in 2000, and the threats being made to the current <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jan/06/hungary-viktor-orban-faces-protest\" title=\"\">rightwing coalition in Hungary</a>, which he claimed, was under pressure to \"change their mind by being called intolerant nationalist Nazis\".</p> <p>Breivik insisted he was not alone in fighting against \"mass immigration\". He singled out the National Socialist Underground, the neo-Nazi terror cell revealed last year as being responsible for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/nov/18/how-german-neo-nazis-evaded-police\" title=\"\">killing nine immigrants and one policewoman in Germany</a>, and Peter Mangs, the man found guilty last month of carrying out <a href=\"http://www.thelocal.se/42202/20120724/\" title=\"\"> killings over seven years in the Swedish city of Malm\u00f6</a>. It is important, he said, that these \"heroic young people\" should be \"celebrated\" for \"sacrificing\" their lives for the \"conservative revolution\".</p> <p>The deadly plan he settled on for 22 July was a compromise, he told the court. Originally he had wanted to hit three targets. As well as the government headquarters where he planted the fertiliser bomb, he wanted to hit the Labour party building in central Oslo, as well as a third target \u2013 perhaps the royal palace, a well-known squat called the Blitzhuset, the offices of the Aftenposten newspaper or NRK, the Norwegian state-owned broadcaster.</p> <p>But he had to scale down his plans after making a bomb proved more difficult than he expected. He was having problems synthesising picric acid, a chemical compound used as an explosive. He thought it would take three to four weeks to make three bombs; in the event, it took him three timesas long to make one. Plus he was running out of money, having reached the maximum on 10 of his 11 credit cards.</p> <p>The time delay meant he missed two other possible targets: the annual conference of Norwegian journalists and the main Labour party congress. He settled on Ut\u00f8ya only reluctantly, he said, knowing that many other militant nationalists would not agree with him killing children. He originally planned his attack to coincide with a visit to the island from Gro Harlem Brundtland, a former Norwegian prime minister. He wanted to decapitate her and film the execution, he said.</p> <p>But he wasn't ready on time and she was gone when he arrived.</p> <p>In the end he compromised, hoping merely to wipe out the next generation of liberal politicians on the island that day. \"The objective was not to kill 69 people at Ut\u00f8ya. The objective was to kill all of them,\" he said, adding that he planned to fire shots, scaring the campers into the water where he anticipated they would drown. \"The main goal was to use the water as a mass-destruction method. Basically, I assumed most people would drown,\" he said, adding, that it's \"hard to swim if you have death anxiety\".</p> <p>He didn't succeed on that point. But another of his goals has been achieved. He received the public trial he craved. \"Your arrest will mark the initiation of the propaganda phase,\" he wrote in the manifesto he posted online before his killing spree. \"Your trial offers you a stage to the world.\"</p>",
  "<p>A granite pink-footed goose egg glinting on lava rock is what you first encounter when entering the timely George Wyllie exhibition in the garden of the Scottish parliament. How Wyllie would have smiled. </p> <p>He was all for the birds, especially since the promise of Sigurdur Gudmundson's sculpture celebrates one which winters in Scotland but summers in Iceland. </p> <p>One of his most famous scul?tures (with the Wyllie question mark firmly in the centre) was that absurd Berlin Burd, keeking over that far absurder Berlin Wall. The original burd is still there, alongside a fragment of what the German Democratic Republic called its anti-fascist protection rampart, though a fledgling version now stands guarding the parliament's garden ramparts.</p> <p>This <a href=\" http://www.whysman.co.uk/scottish-parliament-exhibition.html\">timely exhibition</a> was initiated by Joan McAlpine MSP, on a suggestion from the artist's daughter Louise and the journalist Jan Patience. I was backed into the limelight to chair the accompanying <a href=\"http://www.festivalofpolitics.org.uk/37.htm\">Festival of Politics</a>, Art in Focus event at the Parliament. </p> <p>This was a real pleasure because George, who <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/artanddesign/2012/may/22/george-wyllie\">died this year</a> at 90, was a great artist and a close friend. My late wife Barbara, who for years chaired the Scottish Sculpture Trust, was a champion of George's work and produced A Day Down a Goldmine with Bill Paterson. </p> <p>This surrealist play on the falsehoods of monetarism is remembered now as an eerie forecast on the vanity and greed of bankers. In equal draughts of pleasure and exasperation Bill convulsed the parliament audience in laughter as he recalled his time down that goldmine. </p> <p>Although admiring George's unrelenting quizzing, his barrage of astute comments and his continual challenging of theatrical norms, it was his heavy metal props hurled across the stage that kept him on his toes. </p> <p>David Harding, who founded the <a href=\"http://www.gsa.ac.uk/study/undergraduate-degrees/sculpture-environmental-art/\">environmental art course</a> at the Glasgow School of Art explained the effect George had when he was invited to address his first year students. They included Douglas Gordon, Christine Borland, Roddy Buchanan and many others, who have since made their international reputations as conceptual artists. George taught the students how to think big, said Roddy Buchanan.</p> <blockquote> <p>It was George who fired our imaginations; for him public art is an art that public can't fail to notice.</p> </blockquote> <p>In turn George's inspiration came from <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/artanddesign/beuys\">Joseph Beuys</a> \u2013 the cultural commando who landed with his Dusseldorf platoon of artists at the invitation of Richard Demarco for the 1970 Edinburgh Festival. <a href=\"http://www.richarddemarco.org/documents/strategy_get_arts.html\">Strategy Get Arts</a>, with its catchy palindromic title, made an overwhelming impression on George, although the Art Establishment only realized its significance years later. </p> <p>In the following years George worked with Beuys on the dismantling of the broken doors of the Edinburgh Poor House which are now in the M\u00f6nchengladbach Museum in Germany. Above all Beuys inspired George to think of the environment. His series of hand-made spires, slender tripods pivoting their counter weighted central arms in the landscape, would be a homage to Beuys, who spoke of the urgent need for balance in our relationship with nature.</p> <p>In 1992 George inveigled me into filming a tiny part of his ambitious project called 32 Spires for Hibernia, his contribution to the unification of Ireland. When we met in Galway he had been to every one of Ireland's 32 counties, both south and north, gathering appropriately shaped branches and stones. </p> <p>When the set was complete George linked the spires to straddle a Border stream near a concrete roadblock on an unauthorized road outside Derry. </p> <p>Their spindly branches nodded on their gimbals in the wind like a Flintstones' radar combing the sky for invaders. Soon a helicopter was fluttering overhead. Within weeks that roadblock, which had lasted for almost 70 years, crumbled \u2013 just like the Berlin Wall. Ars Omnia Vincit.</p> <p>When Barbara Grigor invited George Rickey, the west of Scotland-educated American artist, to mount his kinetic sculptures along Glasgow's Broomielaw in 1982, she introduced the two Georges to each other. This enabled the master of Gourock to create work at the Rickey Foundation in East Chattam, New York State. </p> <p>The nearby Shaker Museum inspired him to create a series of wry sculptures in homage to their pared-down designs. Tom Freudenheim, the American art writer, still delights in his economical Wyllie Shaker stove, a metal clamp around a single log with a spindly chimney meandering above. It warms his heart, if not his hearth.</p> <p>After Liz Lochhead read her wry and witty poem 'A Wee Multitude of Questions for George Wyllie' last Friday it triggered quite a heated debate why the work of George Wyllie wasn't celebrated in the national collections. </p> <p>Lochhead's poem illuminates Wyllie's work and life by asking a series of questions, and most particularly this: </p> <blockquote> <p>Who is the man <br>whose name belies his nature?<br>(for 'wily' he is not; there is <br>craft in it, and art, but no guile. He is true<br>and straight, his strategy is honesty, and to ask --<br>in all innocence<br>in all experience --<br>the simplest, starkest, startling<br>questions.)</p> <p>Who makes biting satire out of mild steel?</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://www.learner.org/courses/globalart/consultants.html\">Tom Freudenheim</a> was appalled that a recent BBC programme on the Glasgow Conceptualists failed to mention George's influence. To help spread the word from the USA, where Tom has compared the meaningless $35 million steam engine proposed by Jeff Koons with George's Straw Loco, he is willing to donate a Wyllie scul?ture to Scotland.</p>",
  "<p>Perched on the end of the bed in L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Krasznahorkai's hotel room, I realise that I'm in the clutches of a formal dilemma. The Hungarian writer is sitting in the armchair by the window, the morning after bewitching an Edinburgh festival audience with an electrifying reading from his novel <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/fiction/9781848877641/satantango\" title=\"\">S\u00e1t\u00e1ntango</a>. He's discussing his disenchantment with the paragraph break and the full stop, expounding why the prose of his novels surges across the page in what his translator George Szirtes calls a \"slow lava flow of narrative, a vast black river of type\". Slowly, patiently, with unstoppable momentum, he explains in his ramshackle English that the full stop is all very well for other writers, but it is not for him.</p> <p>\"\u2026 the short sentence is artificial \u2013 we use almost never short sentences, we make pause, or we hold on a part of a sentence end \u2026\" he reaches for it with his left hand as it passes \"\u2026 but this characteristic, very classical, short sentence \u2013 at the end with a dot \u2013 this is artificial, this is only a custom, this is perhaps helpful for the reader, but for only one reason, that the readers in the last few thousand years have learned that a short sentence is easier to understand, this is also a custom, but if you think, you almost never use short sentences, if you listen \u2026\"</p> <p>This is not only when writing, when thinking, he continues, but \"\u2026 in daily life \u2013 if you are in a bar, and if you drink with somebody \u2013 your friend, your acquaintance, an unknown person who speaks, who tells you something \u2013 he wants or she wants to tell this something very, very much, because we all have only one sentence, and we are looking for this sentence where we have some power to say something, for one sentence, in one life we have only one sentence and everybody in a bar or in a school or in a university or everywhere, in the street are looking for their own sentence, and this man or this woman doesn't look for a pause, for this artificial, very easily understandable kind of sentence, no, he or she always uses always very, very long, fluent word combinations \u2013 this is very fragile, but fluent, you can't cut it \u2026\"</p> <p>Some authors talk in easily understandable sentences, with full stops, but not Krasznahorkai. Speaking with quiet intensity in a language not his own, he always uses very, very long, flowing word combinations. If an interview is intended not only to convey something of a writers' work, of his inspiration, but also of his manner, then how do you deal with the fragile whorls and eddies of Krasznahorkai's discourse?</p> <p>He's speaking about how he began writing S\u00e1t\u00e1ntango, a bleak portrait of life in the Hungarian countryside which is set in motion by the imminent arrival of a renegade member of the secret police called Irimi\u00e1s; a conman, a prankster, or perhaps the saviour of the village. A sensation when it was published in communist Hungary in 1985, it was made into <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8vRfiMejoM\" title=\"\">a seven and a half hour long black-and-white epic</a> in 1994 by his friend the film-maker B\u00e9la Tarr. Now the novel has finally been published in English.</p> <p>Krasznahorkai never wanted to be a writer, he says, \"\u2026 not because I couldn't admire writers in Hungary or in world literature. I was a big fan for the greatest personalities in world literature, that's normal, but I couldn't imagine me in this circle \u2026\" After reading Rilke's sonnet <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2010/nov/15/apollos-archaic-torso-sarah-stutt\" title=\"\">\"Arch\u00e4ischer Torso Apollos\"</a> aged 18 and responding to final line's urgent message (\"You have to change your life\") he headed for the \"downstairs of society, to the cellar \u2026\". A string of short-term jobs left him on a farm, working as a nightwatchman; one morning after a night in the cowshed he went to his bed \"\u2026 and the people there said, 'Please don't go to sleep, because someone is coming to castrate the piglets.' We waited for this man \u2013 he was absolutely unknown to me \u2013 he had a very bad atmosphere, the news was very bad about him, but nobody was really sure why. He arrived. He was tall, he had a big nose, he was almost without words, he was wearing a very long coat. The people there invited him for a cup of <a href=\"http://goeasteurope.about.com/od/hungary/a/Hungarian-Palinka.htm\" title=\"\">p\u00e1link</a>a, that was absolutely an obligation there, and after that, this tall man sat down and we had to hold the piglets. That was so terrible, in the early morning before the sun had risen, and the piglets suffered so much, squealing and wriggling, and I had to press them down. The man was totally without sensitivity, without soul, without emotion, and he did this cutting and was ready for the next \u2026\" Krasznahorkai opens his arms to release the mutilated piglet \"\u2026 without a word. After that he got two more cups of p\u00e1linka, some money and he was away. His name was Irimi\u00e1s. I suffered very much because of the suffering of the piglets \u2026\"</p> <p>This waking nightmare was the source of S\u00e1t\u00e1ntango, he continues, not this scene, but its atmosphere, its essence \"\u2026 I thought then, I have to write something about the world, not about communist Hungary, not about Hungary, not about this landscape with the very poor people and their circumstances, but really about the world at a deeper level \u2026\"</p> <p>He began composing sentences in his head, or watching the beginnings of sentences which kept \"coming and coming and coming, like a screen, like a very sensitive screen on your laptop with the words coming through and some words, some combinations or a part of a sentence sounds a little bit better so I stay there and I try to repeat this part of a sentence, and if it works, then I add some more words to this sentence \u2026\" He kept thinking that it would be finished with the next sentence, but \"\u2026 people came into my brain. Irimi\u00e1s, or some other characters in this novel, they are not types from my fictional, imaginary world, they lived somewhere, they came into my brain and they shouted damn and they wanted to be there in relation to the other people \u2026\"</p> <p>The brutal lives of the drunken villagers, the malevolent chutzpah of the freelance secret-service agent and Krasznahorkai's sinuous, compelling prose made the novel a hit in Hungary \"\u2026 a secret bestseller of course, because it's totally different from something the Communist party loved \u2026\" He still doesn't know how it was published, but says that in a country where people had no idea their world was about to be overturned, a country where \"\u2026 we didn't think it was worth writing a novel against the system, because there was no chance of change, people wanted only small dreams \u2013 instead of a <a href=\"http://www.time.com/time/specials/2007/article/0,28804,1658545_1658533_1658030,00.html\" title=\"\">Trabant</a>, a Volvo \u2026\", it wasn't dangerous because \"\u2026 the whole system was really lazy \u2013 people didn't want to do their jobs, everybody was bored \u2026\"</p> <p>He still didn't think of himself as a writer, didn't want to write another book, but after a while submitted. He constructed 1989's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/fiction/9780704380097/the-melancholy-of-resistance\" title=\"\">The Melancholy of Resistance</a> in the same way as S\u00e1t\u00e1ntango, using his photographic memory, twisting his way phrase by phrase through a story of a circus with a dead whale which comes to a small Hungarian town and sparks an outbreak of violence. But reading it again <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cJuIeDwHyo\" title=\"\">to turn it into a screenplay for Tarr</a>, he discovered that \"\u2026 Melancholy of Resistance is actually a good book, but only almost. And that is always the process, because I can imagine a good book, but couldn't write it. This is my life, after every book a disappointment, and after that, let me try again, let me try again \u2013 a Beckettian cage in which I live \u2026\"</p> <p>The fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 also left him disappointed \"because the world in Hungary was absolutely abnormal and unbearable, and after 1989 it was normal and unbearable \u2026\" Travels to China and Japan, where he lived before settling in Berlin, gave him an appreciation of \"\u2026 direct beauty which means that between daily life and your exceptional time there is no border \u2026\" and inspired novels such as From the North by Hill, From the South by Lake, From the West by Roads, From the East by River, but it hasn't changed his writing \"\u2026 I can never lose, unfortunately, this earth of Hungary \u2013 it doesn't matter where I am \u2026\"</p> <p>Returning to S\u00e1t\u00e1ntango more than 30 years after he first began working on it, Krasznahorkai is sad to see that \"\u2026 this novel can work also today without big changes, because the essence hasn't changed \u2013 the world and the social system and human life basically haven't changed \u2026\" According to Krasznahorkai, the deepest loss is the loss of a culture of poverty \u2013 the ability to \"sing wonderful songs when we are poor\". Now, he says, \"\u2026 we only have people who don't have money \u2026 everybody wants to be rich, everybody has only one dream, but people, do we really have one dream \u2013 I ask \u2013 is this the only aim in this shit, to have much more money?\"</p> <p>There's nowhere left beyond the reach of the market, he continues, \"\u2026 no empty spaces with possibilities, only stupid spaces, spaces in which you can't do anything other than wait to return from this space \u2026\" There are perhaps theorists who could explain why this has happened, he adds, but after these explanations \"\u2026 everything goes on \u2013 why? I see you, and I ask you \u2013 why?\"</p> <p>He gestures to the computer sitting on the table at his elbow. \"This is the result of 10,000 years? Really? We have microphone, laptop, this technical society \u2013 that's all? This is sad, and very disappointing. After so many geniuses in the human story from Leonardo to Einstein, from the Buddha to Endre Szemer\u00e9di, these are fantastic figures, and their work is unbelievably important and we cannot do anything with it \u2013 why?\"</p>",

Instead, Friday's verdict was about determining whether he was psychotic at the time.</p> <p>An initial psychiatric assessment left little doubt, declaring Breivik a paranoid schizophrenic, meaning he would be sent to a mental asylum.</p> <p>But the conclusions were leaked, prompting furore in Norway and, in a highly unusual move, the court ordered a second assessment. This time, psychiatrists deemed Breivik sane enough to be considered criminally responsible and sentenced to prison.</p> <p>The findings changed the dynamic of the trial. But they also delighted Breivik. The mass killer was desperate to be found sane.</p> <p>Breivik's entire rationale was entwined with the notion that he was a warrior in a very real war \u2013 a conflict against Islamification. His acts, he told the court, were \"cruel but necessary\" to protect Norway from the multiculturalism his victims had embraced.</p> <p>He believed a sane verdict would deliver his beliefs legitimacy, rendering him a Nordic hero who stood up to protect society from a foreign threat.</p> <p>His defence lawyers argued that he was a political militant motivated by an extreme rightwing discourse that is far from unique. The temptation to dismiss Breivik as a crazed, lone wolf should be cast aside, they argued, in favour of a closer examination of the counter-jihadist and far-right network that influenced the killer.</p> <p>In a reversal of their usual roles, it was the prosecution rather than the defence that called for Breivik to be confined to a psychiatric unit instead of prison.</p> <p>Another unusual twist is that most Norwegians appear to want the same verdict as the man who committed the country's worst peacetime massacre.</p> <p>The majority hoped that Breivik would be judged sane and sent to jail, accountable for committing a crime against those he described as \"cultural Marxists\".</p> <p>Many also feared that if deemed insane, Breivik would appeal the decision, raising the spectre of a fresh trial and making closure impossible.</p>"
