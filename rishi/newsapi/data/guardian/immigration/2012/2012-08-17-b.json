  "<h2><a href=\"http://uncivilisation.co.uk\" title=\"\">Uncivilisation Festival</a>, East Meon</h2> <p>Green-themed festivals are ten-a-penny, it seems, but none are like Uncivilisation, which centres around the idea that only by coming up with new stories can we find a way to make sense of how the world is changing (or falling apart), and how to adapt to it. Two days of discussions, debates and storytelling form around this core, with campfire tales and walks in the surrounding Hampshire countryside fuelling inspired thoughts. Then there's dozens of workshops and family-friendly activities \u2013 from writing to woodworking \u2013 and entertainment in the form of music from the likes of Get Cape Wear Cape Fly.</p> <p><strong><em>Sustainability Centre, Nr Petersfield, Sat, Sun</em></strong></p> <p><em>Katrina Dixon</em></p> <h2><a href=\"http://garlic-festival.co.uk\" title=\"\">The Garlic Festival</a>, Isle Of Wight</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-394838266\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/16/1345135212422/Garlic-Festival-004.jpg\" alt=\"Garlic Festival\" width=\"220\" height=\"132\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Garlic Festival.

Massive marquees stunk out with all kinds of wild garlic-inspired food are just the start of it.

Then, after some garlic fudge, bread or ice cream and seeing the Garlic Queen and her procession, it'll be time for the garlic games, before a grand finale of the Wight Wizards dog display team.

  "<p>Before I saw it, I was starting to feel sorry for <strong>The Watch</strong>. Seemed like the poor movie just couldn't catch a break. Despite reuniting Ben Stiller and Vince Vaughn, their first vehicle since my beloved <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUpzAw5Kw7M\">Dodgeball</a>, 20th Century Fox had to pull the film's teaser trailers \u2013 which featured a Neighbourhood Watch sign pockmarked with bullet-holes \u2013 from cinemas in Florida after the psychotically overzealous wannabe-cop George Zimmerman brought Observe And Report to bloody life by killing the unarmed Trayvon Martin. Even then the trailers made people think, wait a minute, doesn't this rip off Attack The Block? (Unfair, since The Watch's script dates back to 2008). There was talk of a postponement of the release date, but 27 July looked so wide-open, with The Watch rolling out opposite Step Up: Revolution and a dozen no-threat indies, it was never seriously considered.</p> <p>So \u2026 ker-ching! Clean-up time, right? Well, no \u2013 27 July turned out to fall exactly one week after the opening night massacre at The Dark Knight Rises in Aurora, Colorado, as jittery ticket-buyers were telling pollsters they'd feel uncomfortable at the flicks for a while yet. To make matters worse, the Olympics kicked off that very day \u2013 the one factor the studio was ready for. And all this in the middle of a stifling nationwide heatwave that by rights should be packing cinemas with people in search of cheap air conditioning (you have no idea how many shit movies I've sat through lately for this very reason). Then Fox lost one of its major cinema chains when they failed to agree terms, slashing the studio's number of screens two days before release-day. Net takings: $12m on opening weekend, $32m to date. Beaten by Ice Age 3, in its third week, and Batman in its second. No champagne corks popped at Fox that Monday.</p> <p>And then I saw it. It's not terrible \u2013 the 16% rating from <a href=\"http://RottenTomatoes.com\">RottenTomatoes.com</a> pitched things a little low, and the 30 or so satisfying belly laughs I chalked up suggested something more in the mid-range, C-plus or B-minus even, though my shameful weakness for infantile gross-out sci-fi comedies with graphic violence should be factored in. But this is not the Vince Vaughn-Ben Stiller comedy that was so ardently hungered after. Here, Stiller lacks the weirdness of Derek Zoolander or even Roger Greenberg, and the movie thus, fatally, has two straight men up front, with most of the nuttiness displaced on to Jonah Hill and Richard Ayoade, with the quartet never really gelling as a unit.</p> <p>It'll be interesting to see how <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7yC0iiK7a4\">The Campaign</a>, starring Stiller's comedy-rival Will Ferrell, will fare in comparison, having arrived precisely when Americans have become sickened by the presidential race altogether. Stiller's movies are almost as predictable as Ferrell's now \u2013 you have to wonder if they've both reached some sort of sell-by date. Either way, the clock is ticking on the both of them \u2026</p>",
  "<p>It all seems so long ago. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/barack-obama\" title=\"\">Barack Obama</a> was a&#xa0;senator from Illinois running for the White House. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/sven-goran-eriksson\" title=\"\">Sven-G\u00f6ran Eriksson</a> was the manager of mid-table Manchester City. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2007/jul/28/booksforchildrenandteenagers.jkjoannekathleenrowling\" title=\"\">Harry Potter And The Deathly Hallows</a>, the seventh and last in the series, was published. That was the world in the summer of 2007 as the UK entered a <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/financial-crisis\" title=\"\">financial and economic crisis</a> from which it has yet to recover.</p> <p>Famine has followed feast. In the years leading up to the crash, the banks took bigger and bigger bets and consumers borrowed against the rising value of their homes. Growth averaged 3% a&#xa0;year&#xa0;between 2001 and 2007 \u2013 a time of leveraged buyouts, of private equity deals, and of an anything-goes culture in the City.</p> <p>The years since have seen the biggest fall in output since the second world war, a short-lived and modest recovery, and a relapse. The double-dip recession Britain has been enduring since last autumn is only the second since modern records began and, unless things improve, it will take until 2014 or 2015 for the economy to get back to where it was before the recession started in early 2008.</p> <p>There is little expectation that they will. Britain's economic weaknesses \u2013 too much reliance on debt-driven growth, too big a&#xa0;financial sector, too narrow an industrial base \u2013 were papered over during the good years but have subsequently been exposed as banks have turned&#xa0;off the credit tap and consumers have been either unwilling or unable to borrow.</p> <p>The worst of the crisis came in the 19-month period between the run on Northern Rock in September 2007 and the G20 summit held in London in April 2009. Gordon Brown's Labour government part-nationalised Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds, and allowed public borrowing to rise in the hope that tax cuts and spending on the infrastructure would put a floor under the economy. The Bank of England cut interest rates to 0.5%, the lowest in its history, and cranked up the electronic printing presses.</p> <p>To little real effect. In 2009, the economy contracted and by the time the coalition government came to power in May 2010, the budget deficit had risen to the highest it had ever&#xa0;been in peacetime. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/georgeosborne\" title=\"\">George Osborne</a>, the new&#xa0;chancellor, said it was time for the government to do what businesses and consumers had been doing: tighten its belt.</p> <p>Osborne's plan was that the economy would become less dependent on consumer spending and the state for its growth. Instead, low interest rates, a weak pound and action to tackle the deficit would encourage companies to invest and export. Things have not gone according to plan. Consumers, hurt by high inflation, have been reluctant to spend and Whitehall cutbacks have started to bite. But the debt crisis in the eurozone, coupled with a sluggish global economy, have made exporting difficult, while businesses have mothballed investment projects until growth starts to recover. All four of the elements that make up growth \u2013 consumer spending, government spending, investment and exports \u2013 are struggling, which is why the economy is going nowhere fast. George Osborne has been insistent that there is no plan B. But should there be? And if so, what should it look like? Here, seven leading economists give him their ideas. <strong><em>Larry Elliott</em></strong></p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/josephstiglitz\" title=\"\">Joseph Stiglitz</a><br></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-394788508\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/16/1345103194892/Joseph-Stiglitz-001.jpg\" alt=\"Joseph Stiglitz\" width=\"120\" height=\"90\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Joseph Stiglitz Photograph: Murdo MacLeod</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Murdo MacLeod</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong><em>Dear George</em></strong><br> The good news is, you're not part of the euro. So my first piece of advice would be, don't join! And second, call off the mad austerity. No large economy has ever recovered from a downturn as a result of austerity. It is a&#xa0;certain recipe for exacerbating the recession and inflicting unnecessary pain on the economy.</p> <p>Any additional spending should address the longer term problems \u2013 inequality and industrial restructuring \u2013 and target the most needy in society who, because of the downturn, are suffering the most. A more progressive tax structure \u2013 higher taxes at the top, lower taxes at the bottom \u2013 would stimulate the economy. Taxing the excessive speculation that goes on in the financial sector would also be a good thing.</p> <p>There's a basic economic principle called the&#xa0;balance budget multiplier. If the government simultaneously raises taxes and raises spending, by the same amount, it stimulates the economy and creates jobs. Instead, both the US and the UK have embarked on a&#xa0;policy of austerity, but at least Obama realised he needed a larger stimulus and has been pushing for it. The Conservatives have taken the other stance, and it hasn't worked out.</p> <p><em>Joseph Stiglitz is Professor of Economics at Columbia University and author of </em><a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9781846146930\" title=\"\"><em>The Price Of Inequality</em></a><em> (Allen Lane).</em></p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/paul-krugman\" title=\"\">Paul Krugman</a></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-394788509\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/16/1345102732979/Paul-Krugman-001.jpg\" alt=\"Paul Krugman\" width=\"120\" height=\"90\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Paul Krugman.London.By David Levene.29/5/12 Photograph: David Levene</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Levene</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong><em>Dear George</em></strong><br> The answer is: start over. The UK is basically the same as the US. You've got a private sector that got too far into debt, everyone's trying to pay it down at the same time, and the government needs to be going in the other direction, not adding to that. Undo that austerity. You can currently borrow at real rates that are essentially zero, so this is a good time to be increasing public investment.</p> <p>The UK is fairly unique, it having gratuitously chosen to pursue austerity. The eurozone countries have little alternative, but Cameron really didn't have to do this. So my message to you is: do the opposite of what you've been doing for the last two years. The credit ratings don't matter at all, so this argument about austerity keeping Britain's triple A rating doesn't make sense. This is a&#xa0;time for the UK government to be borrowing and spending. Boost the economy and give the private sector time to de-leverage. By all means lock in austerity for the medium to long run, but not now. If everyone tries to slash spending at the same time, that's a&#xa0;recipe for what you've got: a depressed economy.</p> <p><em>Paul Krugman is</em><strong><em> </em></strong><em>Professor of Economics at Princeton University and author of </em><a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9780393088779\" title=\"\"><em>End This Depression Now!</em></a><em> (WW Norton).</em></p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/vicky-pryce\" title=\"\">Vicky Pryce</a><br></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-394788510\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/16/1345102775950/Vicky-Pryce-001.jpg\" alt=\"Vicky Pryce\" width=\"120\" height=\"90\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Economist Vicky Pryce for the Saturday Interview. .Photo by Linda Nylind. 29/9/2011.

Tax and spending incentives must be aligned with a constant eye to the long-term competitiveness of the British economy, but also what might work in the short term \u2013 for example, capital allowances, some temporary tax cuts, extra help to small- and medium-sized firms.

Instead of taking a&#xa0;year to recover, as after a typical recession, full recovery after a financial crisis can easily take another decade or more. There is no shortage of polemicists who argue that the UK should run even larger deficits in view of today's extraordinarily low short-term interest rates. This is classic short-term thinking.</p> <p>All the advanced countries, including the UK, could probably benefit from having higher inflation for a few years. This would help facilitate downward adjustment in the real (inflation adjusted) value of wages and houses, and also achieve a modest deleveraging of public- and private-sector debt. But the best way to deal with a long-term problem is through long-term growth-enhancing structural reforms. For example, revitalising Britain's infrastructure. Along with improving primary and secondary education, the UK would do well to ask what bottlenecks might be preventing faster growth in technology and biotech firms surrounding the&#xa0;UK's world-class university systems. Most&#xa0;British banks are currently forced to pay a premium for funds, which is in turn affecting lending rates to businesses, so more aggressive recapitalisation of the banking system to promote&#xa0;greater competition might help ease lending conditions, and promote investment.</p> <p>There is no quick <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keynesian_economics\" title=\"\">Keynesian</a> fix.

As&#xa0;if&#xa0;the lack of recovery wasn't bad enough, the lack of growth also scuppers your deficit-reduction goals \u2013 the very reason for austerity in the first place. Like&#xa0;throwing away the engine to trim a car, you have offset the lack of revenue recovery by slashing capital spending. The results are already&#xa0;being seen in the forecasts: there will&#xa0;be no spurt of growth to regain the losses&#xa0;of&#xa0;the&#xa0;recession.

This is because, just as an individual can finance his spending either from his income or via his credit card, a nation spends from either its income or the increase in its debt level. Rising debt reduces unemployment, while falling debt increases it \u2013 but of course this is a fool's path to prosperity, because debt can't forever rise faster than income.</p> <p>You have inherited an economy that has followed that fool's path, and is now deleveraging \u2013 and may do so for decades. In this environment, reducing public debt by running a government surplus accelerates the downturn. But the contrary policy \u2013 of simply running government deficits \u2013 isn't ideal either. You also need to reduce the private debt directly, by what is best described as \"Quantitative Easing for the Public\". This would give money to the public via their bank accounts, on the condition that those in debt must pay it down, while those without debt&#xa0;would get a cash injection. Debt would be directly reduced, benefiting everyone \u2013 except the banks, whose incomes would fall. That surely&#xa0;sounds like radical advice, but without a&#xa0;direct reduction in private debt, Britain faces as&#xa0;many lost decades as Japan has already endured \u2013 and without its export surplus to cushion the blow.</p> <p><em>Steve Keen is Professor of Economics and Finance at the University of Western Sydney, and author of&#xa0;</em><a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9781848139923\" title=\"\"><em>Debunking Economics</em></a><em> (Zed Books).</em></p> <p>\u2022 Inset images: Murdo Macleod; David Levene; Linda Nylind; Getty Images (2); James Croucher</p>",
  "<p>When Nick Grimshaw was called in to see the controller of Radio 1 one Tuesday morning at the start of July, he genuinely believed something was wrong. \"I've never really had a meeting with Ben Cooper before,\" he says, \"so I thought I must be in trouble.\"</p> <p>If it seems a little strange that the station's boss has never had a meeting with one of its best-known \"turns\", well, perhaps it shouldn't. Grimshaw isn't a controversial DJ, the kind who criticises the BBC on-air or makes remarks that get the complaints flooding in and Ofcom issuing reprimands. Besides, his show was tucked away at night-time, in the 10pm\u2013midnight slot once occupied by <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/johnpeel\" title=\"\">John Peel</a>. They seem to just leave him to get on with providing what the Radio 1 website insists on referring to, a little dispiritingly, as \"late night music and LOLs\". But he'd been doing a bit of holiday cover for daytime DJs, and he has a tendency to, as he puts it, \"ramble on\": he recently treated the nation to a nine-minute oration on the shortcomings of Madonna's gig at Hyde Park.</p> <p>Instead of telling him off, Cooper offered him the biggest job on the station: the breakfast show, currently the home of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/chris-moyles\" title=\"\">Chris Moyles</a>. It wasn't just Grimshaw who was surprised. The papers&#xa0;had suggested his name was entered in a three-horse race, but most people assumed it would go to either <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fearne_Cotton\" title=\"\">Fearne Cotton</a>, who's better-known, or <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2012/apr/29/radio-1-greg-james-breakfast\" title=\"\">Greg James</a>, the drivetime DJ who'd been open about his ambitions in the press. Grimshaw hadn't said anything but, he smiles, it's the job he's wanted \"since I was 10 or 11\u2026 It was never, 'I&#xa0;want to work in radio', it was always, 'I want to do the Radio 1 breakfast show.' I remember my mum and dad being like, 'Um, that's quite precise, is there nothing else?' But when I was little, I always thought that it sounded like the free-est and funniest that radio can be.\"</p> <p>Nevertheless, he admits to a degree of trepidation. Even in an internet world, the Radio 1 breakfast show is still incontrovertibly a Big Deal:&#xa0;at the height of Moyles' success, nearly eight million people listened to it every day. To&#xa0;compound matters, Moyles has lost a million listeners since then and too many of the ones that&#xa0;hung around are over 30, much to the chagrin of the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/bbc-trust\" title=\"\">BBC Trust</a>, which wants Radio 1 to&#xa0;concentrate on 15-29-year-olds. A lot rests on the skinny shoulders of the 28-year-old currently sitting in an east London photo studio, worrying aloud if the cold sore on his nose \u2013 the result of a course of powerful antibiotics \u2013 makes him look as if he's been sniffing poppers. \"Some days I'm like, they wouldn't have asked if they didn't think&#xa0;I could do it. I've been doing radio for years and it's just a&#xa0;different time of day.\" He nods. \"And then some days I have absolute prang-outs of fear where I'm like, Oh. My. God. What am I&#xa0;going to talk about?\"</p> <p>He was stressed by the level of media attention that followed the announcement. Moyles took him out for a drink, told him to get used to it, then invited him on the show the next morning as a guest and abandoned him live on air, walking out of the studio with his entourage. When Grimshaw went on holiday to Ibiza shortly afterwards, he found himself sleeping for 20 hours a night: \"All my friends were like, great, thanks for coming.\" He chuckles.</p> <p>It is, he concedes, not a job without its drawbacks. There are the hours you have to keep, which aren't really commensurate with the lifestyle of someone who enjoys an evening out. \"I'll have to get up at half-five, which isn't that crazy, is it?\" he asks, wincing slightly. \"I mean, there are people who work all day and get up and go to the gym at that time. I've definitely seen people running in the park at 6am,\" he adds. \"When I'm going home.\"</p> <p>Furthermore, ever since <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2010/may/28/tony-blackburn\" title=\"\">Tony Blackburn</a> kicked off proceedings in 1967, the Radio 1 breakfast show has garnered a reputation for sending its&#xa0;DJs barmy. Listeners of an age sufficient to preclude you from presenting the breakfast show \u2013 among the reasons given for Moyles' departure was that he's 38, too old for Radio 1's youthful demographic \u2013 should remember the increasingly unlistenable megalomania of Chris Evans in the&#xa0;mid-90s. Listeners of a more mature vintage still may recall Blackburn, so haunted by losing the breakfast show and the collapse of his marriage that he kept playing Chicago's <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TNSNyvkqd4\" title=\"\">If You Leave Me Now</a> over and over again on air; or <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2011/jun/11/frankie-hollywood-banned-bbc\" title=\"\">Mike&#xa0;Read, with his moral crusade</a> against Frankie Goes To&#xa0;Hollywood and peculiar attitude to celebrity,&#xa0;characterised by the late John Peel as&#xa0;\"complaining that he couldn't go anywhere without being recognised, when he'd go everywhere in a tartan suit carrying a guitar, so&#xa0;he&#xa0;would have attracted attention in a lunatic asylum\". Grimshaw saw a&#xa0;documentary about former breakfast show hosts once, he says: \"They went and visited them, and they were all mad. I&#xa0;bet it does that to you, the sleep deprivation. I&#xa0;saw <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisa_Snowdon\" title=\"\">Lisa Snowdon</a> recently, who does Capital's breakfast show. I said, are you tired all day? She said, yeah. I said, are you irritable? She said, all the time. I was like, oh&#xa0;no, what have I done?\"</p> <p>Luckily, sage advice on his new job was to hand, albeit from an unlikely source. \"When I&#xa0;got the job, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/kate-moss\" title=\"\">Kate Moss</a> said to me\" \u2013 he drops into a&#xa0;London accent \u2013 \"'What you wanna do, darling, is do what I do. Sometimes I go to work. Sometimes I go to work hungover. Sometimes I&#xa0;don't turn up at all. People love that. They don't know what to expect.'\" He snorts with laughter. \"I said, 'Kate, that's what <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/chris-evans\" title=\"\">Chris Evans</a> did.' 'Exactly, darling, everybody loved Chris Evans.' I&#xa0;said, 'Kate, <em>they&#xa0;sacked him</em>.'\"</p> <p>This, you could argue, is a typical Grimshaw anecdote. It's drily funny, a little self-deprecating, told in a slightly camp Oldham accent, and it features one of his seemingly fathomless array of celebrity friends. They sometimes turn up on his radio show, having apparently just dropped in for a chat: <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/fashion/alexa-chung\" title=\"\">Alexa Chung</a> or <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/fashion/2012/feb/26/agyness-deyn-supermodel-stage\" title=\"\">Agyness Deyn</a> or even <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Direction#Harry_Styles\" title=\"\">Harry Styles</a>, teenage vocalist with boyband <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/shortcuts/2012/jul/22/pass-notes-one-direction\" title=\"\">One Direction</a> and connoisseur of the more mature lady, with whom Grimshaw apparently enjoys \"lads' shopping trips\". (\"To <a href=\"http://www.liberty.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Liberty</a>.\" He laughs. \"It's really very laddy in Liberty, Alexis.\") But initially at least today, I get the feeling he's making a concerted effort not to appear as if he's&#xa0;dropping names. He mentions going to Ibiza&#xa0;with a friend of his \"who's really anti-dance music and hates Ibiza\", who later turns out to be&#xa0;<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixie_Geldof\" title=\"\">Pixie Geldof</a>. He says he worries that people think he's got on because of who he&#xa0;knows, rather than his talents, that he's better&#xa0;known as a certain kind of&#xa0;starlet's gay bff than as a broadcaster. \"It's probably been a hindrance because people just think you're an idiot who goes out. That's people's perception of you. They're making an idea of you before actually listening to you on the radio.\"</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-394750131\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/15/1345039532128/Nick-Grimshaw-composite-001.jpg\" alt=\"Nick Grimshaw composite\" width=\"460\" height=\"480\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Clockwise from top left: Grimshaw with Kelly Osborne; Sara\u00a0Cox and Annie Mac at the Brit awards; Queens of Noize DJ Tabitha Denholm; dressed as Lily Allen, off to Mark Ronson\u2019s birthday party; at Amy Winehouse\u2019s funeral; with\u00a0Henry Holland; Pixie Geldof and Alexa Chung at the NME awards afterparty; predecessor Chris Moyles.

Even before that, his career seemed to be progressing at quite an astonishing pace. After what one TV executive called \"the easiest recruitment of a presenter we've ever had\", he's spent five years dominating <a href=\"http://www.channel4.com/t4/nick-grimshaw\" title=\"\">Channel 4's yoof TV</a> output, fronting the kind of shows that require him to interview rapper <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/nicki-minaj\" title=\"\">Nicki Minaj</a> while dressed as her \u2013 \"Nicki Grimaj,\" he laughs \u2013 or go fishing for crabs with singer <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2011/oct/06/jason-derulo-future-history-review\" title=\"\">Jason Der\u00fclo</a>. On the other, you see what he means. On air, he's funny and engaging and enthusiastic, with the casual air of the natural broadcaster: with the best will in the world, it seems unlikely that Radio 1 would gift him the biggest job on the station on the grounds that he knows Pixie Geldof. Neverthless, when he got the breakfast show job, one tabloid printed a feature headlined <a href=\"http://www.mirror.co.uk/lifestyle/going-out/music/who-is-nick-grimshaw-all-you-need-1139558\" title=\"\">Who Is Nick Grimshaw?</a>, answering the question by printing a selection of paparazzi photos of him with different celebrities: fashion designer <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/henry-holland\" title=\"\">Henry Holland</a>, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/florence-and-the-machine\" title=\"\">Florence</a> of + The Machine fame, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/lilyallen\" title=\"\">Lily Allen</a>, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/kelly-osbourne\" title=\"\">Kelly Osbourne</a>, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/sadie-frost\" title=\"\">Sadie Frost</a>, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/noel-fielding\" title=\"\">Noel Fielding</a>. \"They said I got a first at university as well, though,\" he says, hopefully.</p> <p>It was a world into which he was unexpectedly catapulted while he was still a student in Liverpool. He'd gone to university to do business and media studies, the former a sop to his father, who wasn't terribly enamoured of his son's ambitions in the music business. \"My dad's quite old school, he didn't have me until he was 43. He was born and bred in Manchester, and for that generation, there weren't that many jobs, I guess, in media in Manchester. So me saying, I want to go and work in radio or music was like saying I want to go and be a stripper on Mars. He was like, if you do media studies, I'm not paying for it. So we compromised on business and media studies. I got a first in the communications and media side, and I literally couldn't pass the business studies side. Macro-economics I sat seven times. I still don't know what it means. On my sixth resit I got 20%. I was like, Oh. My. God. I'm actually getting worse at it.\"</p> <p>He had a show on student radio: at one point, he and a friend hounded and pestered until they were allowed to present the breakfast show, before realising they'd talked their way into the worst job on the station \"because literally no students are up in the morning\". He laughs. \"I remember once having a record listenership of seven.\" One day, his guests were an indie DJ duo called <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queens_of_Noize\" title=\"\">Queens Of Noize</a>, with whom he struck up a friendship. \"I&#xa0;ended up going out with them that night, having a full-on bonding night out with them, came home with a haircut and a bill for someone's window that I broke. I just loved them.\"</p> <p>As it turned out, Queens Of Noize were enormously well-connected. \"After that, whenever they came to Liverpool, we'd always hang out. They'd come and pick me up at uni and have <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/graham-coxon\" title=\"\">Graham Coxon</a> from Blur or <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/petedoherty\" title=\"\">Pete Doherty</a> with them.\" That sounds quite intimidating to me, but Grimshaw says not: the only times he can think of when he got starstruck was when he first met Kate Moss (\"Because she looks like Kate Moss, you know, with the fag and the drink, wearing a fur\") and when he recently went to a&#xa0;party in a Hackney pub and discovered <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/jayz\" title=\"\">Jay-Z</a> and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/beyonce\" title=\"\">Beyonc\u00e9</a> were there, the latter, a little improbably, dancing and \"drinking pints of cider. Well, not pints, but Bulmers, you know, bottles of cider. She was definitely having cider with ice in it. I&#xa0;was trying not to stare at her. I was like, no way.\"</p> <p>After university, he got a job at a radio plugging company in Manchester, but one of the Queens Of Noize, Mairead, told him to leave, come to London, live in her flat and help run their club. \"I don't know if it was glamorous, because it was quite a dingy club in Camden, but they did know everybody,\" he says. \"Florence was like our friend who got on the kitchen worktops and sang annoyingly loudly at every party we went to, and now she sings at the Grammys. Henry was making little T-shirts and now he does fashion shows with <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/rihanna\" title=\"\">Rihanna</a>. It was never like, I'm going to latch on to these and I'll make friends with them. I've had the same group of friends since I moved to London, people that went to the Queens Of Noize's club night, because that's where I made my friends. I didn't know anyone in London apart from them.\"</p> <p>Perhaps people concentrate on his famous friends because so little is known about Grimshaw himself. For someone who's never off the TV and radio, he cuts a rather enigmatic figure, rarely giving interviews: \"I don't guard my privacy, but I&#xa0;don't really see the point in doing press if there's nothing to talk about. You don't want to be in the paper for the sake of it.\" His personal life seems slightly mysterious, largely because it appears to be nonexistent. One page of a fan website is given to trying to decipher whether or not he's gay \u2013 \"the truth is that no one really knows because he's not directly answered that question,\" it puzzles, before adding hastily, \"we all love 'Grimmy' either way!\" \u2013 today, at least, he seems happy to acknowledge that he is. But he's never really had a relationship, he says. \"I've just not met anyone that I thought oh, I really like you that much. I work so much, when I do go out, I'd rather go out with my friends. I rather do that than, like, go out on the prowl. I literally can't think of anything worse.\"</p> <p>It just seems a bit of a waste, I say, given that&#xa0;he's young and handsome and famous. \"It&#xa0;does, doesn't it?\" He thinks for a minute, before suggesting he'd \"really like to go out with <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Ocean#Personal_life\" title=\"\">Frank Ocean</a>\", the R&amp;B singer who outed himself as bisexual earlier this year. He thinks again. \"I think he might be whiny, though. Like, why have you not called me? He might be a bit wet. I think I'm just forcing that Frank thing.\" He laughs. \"You see, as soon as I decide, I talk myself out of it.\"</p> <p>In contrast to the press that suggested Radio 1 was desperate for a radical change first thing in the morning, Grimshaw says he thinks he might have got the breakfast job because \"I'm not too far away from Moyles. I think we both can waffle and both are obviously northern, and I think we're both quite warm and can talk about anything. I thought all the papers were quite negative about him and I think he's amazing.\"</p> <p>But, quite aside from the fact that he's a gay man taking over from a DJ with an unfortunate habit of using the word \"gay\" as an insult, there's no doubt that Grimshaw is a DJ of a rather different stripe from his predecessor. For one thing, he's exceptionally charming, which even the most vociferous Moyles fan might be forced to concede was not chief among the self-styled Saviour Of Radio 1's attributes. For another, while Moyles often gives the impression that the records on his show are a mere hindrance, getting in the way of the more important sound of his voice, Grimshaw is a genuine music fan, always out at gigs, willing to risk the wrath of his night-time audience by playing Rihanna tracks \"because they're sick \u2013 just because little girls like them, it doesn't mean it's not good music\".</p> <p>Before he takes over the breakfast show, he's going to head up to Edinburgh to present a week of programmes from the festival. \"I wanted to get my mate Scottee on the show, he's a performance artist,\" he says, handing me his iPhone. It is showing a <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2dKyara_QM\" title=\"\">YouTube video of Scottee</a>. He is a&#xa0;large man in a floral dress and what looks like a&#xa0;pregnancy bump, lip-synching to I Just Want To Make Love To You. He strips off the top half of the dress, gives birth to a two-litre bottle of cola, which he then pretends to fellate, before sticking Mentos in his mouth and trying to drink the cola with predictable results. For some reason, Radio 1 weren't keen on having Scottee on the programme. \"They said he's too weird.\" Grimshaw laughs. Then he heads off to arrange his 28th birthday party, from which Kate Moss will emerge in the early hours, into a wall of paparazzi, looking noticeably the worse for wear.</p> <p>\u2022 Nick Grimshaw's <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/newsbeat/19149071\" title=\"\">Radio 1 breakfast show</a> starts on 24 September.

You know the one I mean. Mists and mellow fruitfulness. Winter seemed to end only about three weeks ago, so I am not in any more of a hurry to say goodbye to this summer than you are. But in fashion, there is no point pretending that summer's trends are anything but old news.</p> <p>Let's call it the new season. Essentially, it starts on the day after&#xa0;you get back from your big summer holiday, or last summer festival/wedding/jaunt, and dust yourself down and give yourself a&#xa0;back-to-business talking to. Silly season is over.</p> <p>For any new season you can start with the colours, or the silhouette. The new silhouette is more of a&#xa0;game changer, but it is also more of a commitment. It means turning your back on the blowsiness of summer \u2013&#xa0;and no one wants that just yet.</p> <p>Let's ease our way into the new season with purple. Purple was anointed the de facto colour of the season once <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ktv59CmfjtA\" title=\"\">Christopher Kane</a> and <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEqXWwPFusI\" title=\"\">Prada</a> had both shown purple clothes, on purple-carpeted catwalks. Specifically, a shade that will be instantly summoned to mind for readers of a certain age by the name <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silk_Cut\" title=\"\">Silk Cut Purple</a>.</p> <p>The catwalk mood for this autumn can be summarised as Pretty Gothic. It is an unfleshy season, and slightly sombre. It is also quite grown up, the conversational kitten prints and jokey neons of last winter having been replaced by elegant florals and dark tones. So it makes sense that we are to graduate out of the school-uniform colours that have dominated most recent autumn/winter seasons \u2013 navy and grey, particularly \u2013 into purple, which as everyone knows is the official shade of the sixth form common room. Purple is a transitional shade, not childish, but not sophisticated.</p> <p>The perfect colour, then, to tide us over until the new season truly kicks in, while holding on to the spirit of summer. Match your trousers to your Ribena ice lolly, and don't mention the A word.</p> <p><em>\u2022 </em>Jess wears <strong>trousers</strong>, \u00a3199, by <a href=\"http://www.paulsmith.co.uk/shop/home/\" title=\"\">Paul Smith</a>. <strong>Blouse</strong>, \u00a3149, by Pyrus, from <a href=\"http://fenwick.co.uk\" title=\"\">Fenwick</a>. <strong>Shoes</strong>, \u00a365, by <a href=\"http://stevemadden.com\" title=\"\">Steve Madden</a>.</p> <p>Photograph: David Newby for the Guardian.

  "<h2>Big mess trifle</h2> <p>Splicing Eton mess with a classic trifle produces one shameless tumble of a dessert. This is a pud that tastes good whether it's all homemade from scratch or cobbled together from supermarket sponge and meringues.</p> <p><strong>1 small jam-filled swiss roll (see following recipe), cut into slices</strong><br><strong>Sweet sherry</strong><br><strong>2 small punnets ripe strawberries</strong><br><strong>1 packet strawberry jelly (optional)</strong><br><strong>Thick, rich custard (see final recipe) </strong><br><strong>6-8 medium-sized meringues</strong><br><strong>250ml double cream, plus a little ice-cold milk</strong><br><strong>Toasted almonds</strong></p> <p>Line the base of a deep glass bowl with slices of the sponge, then douse it liberally with sweet sherry. Hull one punnet's-worth of strawberries, quarter the fruit and scatter over the sponge. Make the jelly, if you're using it, let it cool until almost set, then pour over the sponge, leave to set, then spoon the custard over.</p> <p>Meanwhile, break the meringues into smallish, bite-sized pieces. Hull and quarter the remaining strawberries. Lightly whip the cream&#xa0;with a tablespoon or two of milk, so that it's thick but with a&#xa0;soft, light texture. Spoon alternate dollops of strawberries, cream and meringue on to the custard, swirl the top gently, chill until needed and serve topped with a sprinkling of flaked almonds.</p> <h2>A simple swiss roll</h2> <p>Mum always added a little baking powder to her swiss roll for the added safety of ensuring it rose. I&#xa0;find it also dries the crumb of the sponge, which is not usually a good thing, but here it helps the sponge soak up even more sherry, which is. Use a baking tray with a 1cm lip (or more) around the edge, just in case the dough spreads a little too easily.</p> <p><strong>3 medium eggs, separated</strong><br><strong>100g caster sugar</strong><br><strong>100g plain flour</strong><br><strong>1 tsp baking powder</strong><br><strong>Strawberry or raspberry jam</strong></p> <p>Line a baking tray with a sheet of nonstick paper, and heat the oven to 180C (160C fan-assisted)/350F/gas mark 4. Using an electric whisk (I&#xa0;find a hand-held one works best here), beat the egg whites in a clean bowl until they form soft peaks. Still whisking, gradually add half the sugar and continue whisking until glossy and stiff. In a separate clean bowl, and with a clean whisk, beat the yolks until they turn pale and creamy. Very gently fold yolks through whites, then sift in the flour and baking powder, and, with the lightest effort, fold through gently.</p> <p>Carefully spread the mixture over the baking paper and bake for 12-15 minutes, until barely set. Remove, leave to cool slightly, then upturn on to a damp tea towel lightly dredged in caster sugar. Peel off the paper, spread with warm thinned jam, then roll up and leave to cool.</p> <h2>Extra rich thick custard</h2> <p>This is essentially a basic cr\u00e8me anglaise or thin pouring custard, but one in which the milk is switched for double cream and corn flour, added for a little holding power. You need confidence to cook it, because you have to take the custard perilously close to the boil without scrambling the egg; and if you don't cook it enough, it stays liquid. So it needs a little precision but, with care, you can do it.</p> <p><strong>500ml double cream</strong><br><strong>Seeds from 1 vanilla pod</strong><br><strong>50g caster sugar</strong><br><strong>8 egg yolks</strong><br><strong>2 tsp corn flour</strong></p> <p>Heat the cream until boiling. Meanwhile put the vanilla in a bowl with the caster sugar, egg yolks and corn flour, and whisk until smooth but not really frothy. Pour the boiling cream into the bowl, stir, then return everything to the pan and cook until almost boiling and very thick. Immediately pour the custard out of the pan and back into the bowl, cover and leave to cool. Once cool, stir in more sugar if you prefer a sweeter custard.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.danlepard.com/guardian\" title=\"\">danlepard.com/guardian</a></p>",
  "<p>I adore recipes that make use&#xa0;of one cut of meat or a whole animal to create a&#xa0;complex dish, loaded with flavour. In many cases,&#xa0;that's achieved by cleverly using the braising stock to cook a&#xa0;grain and then serving everything \u2013 meat, starch and a few quick and easy to make (or buy) condiments \u2013 in perfect harmony. I recently came across some traditional Palestinian dishes, such as mansaf or kidreh, that do just that with lamb, rice and&#xa0;saffron.</p> <p>Hainanese chicken rice is a Malaysian/Singaporean classic that I have been admiring for years, not only for its thrift and crafty cooking technique, but also for the way in which just a few subtle and simple flavours \u2013 namely ginger and spring onion \u2013 create so immense and compelling an impact. And that is even before you douse everything with those intensely delicious chilli and soy condiments. Make it once and it is likely to turn into a habit.</p> <h2>Hainanese chicken rice</h2> <p>For the chilli sauce, try to find relatively mild chillies, or just use fewer of them. Failing that, you can&#xa0;also use a ready-made sauce \u2013 I&#xa0;like <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sriracha_sauce_(Huy_Fong_Foods)\" title=\"\">the Sriracha brand</a>; just make&#xa0;sure it's a savoury variety, not a sweet one. The acar recipe that follows is another condiment that you can quite happily serve alongside the chicken. Serves four.</p> <p><strong>100g ginger, peeled and thinly sliced (net weight), plus an extra 15g,&#xa0;finely chopped, for the rice</strong><br><strong>100g spring onion, sliced into 2cm pieces, plus 1 more whole spring onion for garnish</strong><br><strong>1 free-range chicken weighing about&#xa0;1.5kg</strong><br><strong>1 large cucumber, peeled</strong><br><strong>75ml dark soy sauce</strong><br><strong>25ml light soy sauce</strong><br><strong>1 tbsp toasted sesame oil</strong><br><strong>35g unsalted butter</strong><br><strong>3 cloves garlic, peeled and finely&#xa0;chopped</strong><br><strong>420g jasmine rice</strong><br><strong>Salt</strong><br><strong>3 tbsp shop-bought fried shallots (optional)</strong><br><strong>10g picked coriander leaves</strong></p> <p>For the chilli sauce<br><strong>About 10 mild to medium-heat red chillies, deseeded and roughly chopped (80g net weight)</strong><br><strong>20g ginger, peeled and roughly chopped</strong><br><strong>4 cloves garlic, peeled and roughly&#xa0;chopped</strong><br><strong>2 tsp caster sugar</strong><br><strong>2 tbsp groundnut oil</strong><br><strong>1 tbsp lime juice</strong><br><strong>\u00bd tsp fish sauce</strong></p> <p><em>For the chicken and the broth</em><br>Fill a large pot with cold water and add the sliced ginger and spring onion. Bring to a boil and put in the chicken (for extra flavour, stuff the chicken with more crushed fresh ginger and whole spring onions, if you like). Make sure the chicken is completely submerged in the water. Put a lid on the pot and bring back to a rapid boil. Simmer for 10 minutes, then remove the pot from the heat and leave to one side, covered, for 50-60 minutes.</p> <p>Once the time's up, check the bird is cooked by inserting a small, sharp knife into the thickest part of the thigh by the bone \u2013 the juices should run clear. Lift the chicken from the stock and slice off each breast, skin included, in one piece. Put the breasts in a bowl with a little stock to keep them moist. Return the remaining chicken to the stock pot, bring back to a boil and simmer, uncovered, for five minutes more. Remove the pot from the heat and set aside to cool down a little.</p> <p><em>For the condiments</em><br>Make the condiments while the chicken is cooking. For the chilli sauce, put all the ingredients in a&#xa0;small food processor bowl, adding half a teaspoon of salt, and work for a couple of minutes until you have a uniform sauce. Top and tail the cucumber, cut it in two lengthways, then slice each half on an angle into 0.5cm-thick slices. Slice the whole spring onion on a sharp angle into long, thin slices and put these in a bowl in the fridge with some ice water. Whisk together the two soy sauces and the sesame oil.</p> <p><em>For the rice</em><br>Start preparing the rice about 30 minutes before serving. Melt the butter in a medium saucepan. Add the 15g of chopped ginger and the garlic, and saut\u00e9 on medium heat for three minutes, until light golden. Add the rice and a teaspoon of salt, and saut\u00e9, stirring, for four minutes; add a bit of stock if it starts sticking to the bottom of the pot.</p> <p>Take 750ml of the chicken stock, including any fat that has collected on the surface, and add to the rice pot. Bring to a rapid boil, cover with a tight lid, reduce the heat to the absolute minimum, leave to cook for 20 minutes, then remove from the heat but keep covered.</p> <p><em>To serve </em><br>When you are ready to serve, return the chicken breast to the hot stock to heat it up a little; it needs to be just warm. Meanwhile, chop the rest of the chicken \u2013 thighs, drumsticks and wings \u2013 into pieces of whatever size you prefer. Place these pieces on a large platter and top with the breasts, each cut neatly into three pieces widthways with the skin left on; you want to see the breast meat, not the messy, bony pieces of chicken underneath.</p> <p>Arrange a few cucumber slices alongside the chicken and place the rest on a small plate to serve separately. Spoon some of the soy and sesame sauce over the chicken and put the rest in a small bowl. Put the chilli sauce in a similar bowl. Put&#xa0;some rice in a medium-size, deep bowl and press down to mould it. Turn over briskly on to the platter&#xa0;and sprinkle with fried shallots, if using. Heat up the stock (reduce it a bit for extra flavour, if you like), season with salt to taste, sprinkle with coriander and ladle into individual bowls \u2013 the stock is eaten as a soup served at the same time as the chicken. Finally, drain and dry the spring onion slices from&#xa0;the fridge, sprinkle over the chicken and serve.</p> <h2>Penang acar</h2> <p>This Malaysian vegetable relish is best at room temperature as a condiment for rice, seafood, chicken or tofu.

  "<p>When you read a biography of Trotsky, you may feel you have encountered the ultimate in tragic revolutionary lives. Not so: Victor Serge's life is worse. Starting from an immensely deprived childhood, it proceeds to a brief heyday of optimistic identification with the Russian revolution and work in the Comintern, followed by decades of persecution, first in the Soviet Union, as an Oppositionist in Leningrad, and then a deportee in Orenburg, and finally outside it. Even the Trotskyites made him an outcast, although Serge retained an admiration for the Old Man, and died, like him (though not by an assassin's hand), in exile in Mexico.</p> <p>This is a republication of the 1963 Oxford University Press edition prepared and translated by Peter Sedgwick from Serge's original French text, and the new edition retains Sedgwick's introduction, along with a post-Soviet essay on Serge by Adam Hochschild, a usefully expanded glossary of short biographies, and a number of charming and accomplished pencil sketches of Serge and his friends by his artist son, Vladimir. Vlady, who survived the travails of Europe and ended up with his father in Mexico, also contributes a moving paragraph on Serge's death (by heart attack in Mexico City in 1947 at the age of 57).</p> <p>Serge's story is often remembered for the vivid portraits of contemporaries dotted throughout the text \u2013 revolutionary leaders such as Lenin, Trotsky and Zinoviev, all of whom he knew well, Comintern figures such as Angelica Balabanova and Georg Luk\u00e1cs, the American anarchists Emma Goldman and Alexander Berkman, French writers such as Andr\u00e9 Gide and Romain Rolland, and a host of others. Independent non-conformist though he was, Serge knew everyone who was anyone on the European revolutionary and left-intellectual scene in the 1920s. Even awaiting rescue in Spain with other French refugees in 1941, he found himself in the company of Walter Benjamin and shared a villa with Varian Fry (anti-Nazi journalist and director of the American Relief Committee) and the surrealist writer Andr\u00e9 Breton.</p> <p>A child of itinerant and impoverished Russian revolutionaries, Serge was born in Belgium in 1890 and spent his adolescence in Paris, doing various manual jobs and consorting with other angry and despairing youths in a \"world without possible escape\", as Serge characterises Europe on the eve of the first world war. Interned as a foreign revolutionary during the war, Serge was plucked from a French concentration camp in 1919 and sent to Russia \u2013 where he had never been \u2013 under an exchange negotiated by the new Soviet regime. Though inclined to anarchism and independent judgment, Serge joined the Bolsheviks, becoming close to a number of the leaders, as well as the writer Maxim Gorky, and stayed in the party despite his anguish at the suppression of the Kronstadt rising at the end of 1920. Stalin was never one of Serge's intimates, though he makes a brief early appearance \"trying to catch Zinoviev's attention\" at a Comintern meeting \u2013 \"frightening and banal, like a Caucasian dagger\", in Serge's memorable phrase.</p> <p>Inevitably, Serge found himself in Trotsky's Left Opposition faction after Lenin's death, though he was never a true disciple of Trotsky or of any other Opposition leader. Persistence in the use of terror and lack of respect for individual freedom were Serge's basic objections to the Soviet regime, and he did not exempt Trotsky, Zinoviev or Lenin from that criticism. Under Stalin, he experienced Bolshevik terror at first hand, along with other Oppositionists, until an international campaign mounted by influential French literary friends in the mid-1930s rescued him from internal exile and enabled him to leave the Soviet Union.</p> <p>For all his criticisms, Serge deeply admired the first generation of Bolshevik leaders. This is clearer in the new edition than it was in the old one, which failed to include several such statements. This, no doubt, was largely the result of pressure on Sedgwick from the publisher to reduce his text by an eighth, which he generally did at the expense of redundancy, digression or internal contradiction. The trouble is that Serge's praise for the Bolsheviks is often embedded in a digression or implicitly contradicts other statements: it was an issue on which he was obviously in two minds. Thus, one of Sedgwick's omissions (restored in the new edition, though the editors unfortunately do not flag these passages) is Serge's expression of perplexity about a question that he seems to have answered quite confidently elsewhere in the manuscript as a product of intolerance, mistrust of democracy, and a willingness to solve problems by administrative force: \"I still ask myself, having closely observed the probity and intelligence of [the party's] leaders, why it didn't [respect individual liberties]. What psychoses of fear and power prevented it?\" Similarly, Serge's clear analysis of the Bolshevik \"mistakes\" of the civil war period turns out to have been partially subverted in the original text by a ringing assertion of loyalty: \"I would support the Bolsheviks because they were doing what was necessary tenaciously, doggedly, with magnificent ardour and a calculated passion; I would be with them because they alone were carrying this out, taking all responsibilities on themselves, all the initiatives, and were demonstrating an astonishing strength of spirit.\"</p> <p>When I first read these memoirs, as a young would-be Soviet historian at the time of their first publication in English, the paragraph that struck me most poignantly and remained imprinted was Serge's confession that \"the feeling of having so many dead men at my back, many of them my betters in energy, talent, and historical character, has often overwhelmed me, and that this feeling has been for me the source of a certain courage, if that is the right word for it.\" This remains one of the great lines in the annals of revolutionary memoir. On rereading, however, I found myself equally moved by Serge's rueful meditations on the uses of human reason. \"Many times,\" he writes, \"I have felt myself on the brink of a pessimistic conclusion as to the function of thinking, of intelligence, in society\", even to the point of wondering whether \"the role of critical intelligence\", which he had exercised so often and at such costs to himself, might not be \"dangerous, and very nearly useless\". He banishes such thoughts rather lamely with the remark that societies need critical thinking and \"better times will come\" \u2013 but then adds, with more conviction, that in any case, the use of the critical faculty is \"a source of immense satisfactions\" to the thinker. Perhaps, after all, we can regard the life of Victor Serge, perennial critic and dissenter, as, in a certain sense, a happy one.</p> <p><em>Tear Off the Masks!

  "<p>Our historic towns are a precious cultural treasure. I've been exploring them for decades, extracting secrets about the ways people built, lived, toiled and took their pleasures through the generations.</p> <p>A particular joy is the great diversity in the building materials and methods with which towns were built. Within a few miles the very nature of the settlements can change, depending on available materials. So you find brick in much of south-east England, timber in Herefordshire and Worcestershire, limestone in Somerset and the Cotswolds, sandstone in Cumberland, and granite in much of Cornwall and Scotland. Architectural and building styles also change, evolve and survive in a most charming way, to give each town its own vernacular character.</p> <p>The most beautiful and best- preserved of our historic towns are well-known, and rightly so, but one of the wonders of these islands is that many fascinating places are taken for granted or overlooked. <strong>Ludlow</strong> in Shropshire is a perfect example: rising on a plateau above the river Teme on the border of England and Wales, it was a frontier town and fortified with wall, gates and a mighty castle.</p> <p>It was also a market town, so it has a long wide market square and a \"shambles\" of alleys once home to victuallers and butchers. But best of all is its glorious mix of building materials and styles. You find 16th- and early-17th-century timber-framed structures with late Gothic or Renaissance details \u2013 such as the <a href=\"http://www.feathersatludlow.co.uk\" title=\"\">Feathers Inn</a> \u2013 jostling with sedate brick-built Georgian houses. A stroll through the city gate and up Broad Street \u2013 lined with the mansions of long-forgotten rural grandees \u2013 is a great urban experience.</p> <p><strong>Frome</strong>, in Somerset, is very different. It is primarily a limestone town, its houses built of square ashlar blocks or coursed rubble rendered with lime. Its golden age was in the 17th and 18th centuries, when it flourished as a market and coaching town and a centre for the wool industry. The old weavers' quarter, called the Trinity, dates from the late 17th century and incorporates charming and pioneering industrial housing. It was almost swept away in the 1970s but, at the 11th hour, enough was saved to remind us of what had been, and give extra character to this most rewarding town.</p> <p>As with all the best towns, the pleasure of a walk through Frome is far more than the sum of its parts. The spaces, the sustained streets, the sinuous forms, the vistas framed and enclosed, the surprise as corners are turned and amazing buildings or compositions emerge, offer great aesthetic thrills. There is Cheap Street \u2013 lined with early buildings, steep, paved and with a central gutter or \"canal\", once a common feature in our towns and cities \u2013 the steep and cobbled Catherine Hill, Stony Street and Gentle Street with their generous Georgian houses, and the astonishing temple-like early 18th-century Rook Street Chapel.</p> <p>For urban brick at its best, explore <strong>Blandford Forum</strong> in Dorset. Here the town centre, destroyed by fire in 1731, was soon rebuilt in a splendid English baroque manner by equally splendidly named local builders the Bastard brothers. The bricks are of superb quality and colour, and the way they are laid and detailed displays superlative craftsmanship and deep sensibility. Add to this the Bastards' eye for baroque styling, particularly fashionable in the West Country: facades articulated with pilasters and dressed with details inspired by the work of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/artanddesign/2011/feb/05/borromini-book-kerry-downes-architecture\" title=\"\">Borromini</a> in Rome.</p> <p>It's all amazing, and organised around a splendid baroque parish church, also designed by the Bastards. This heady combination of grand church and swaggering houses gives this little town the architectural sophistication and, at moments, the presence of a great city.</p> <p>For yet greater 18th-century architectural and metropolitan sophistication in a smallish town, visit <strong>Stamford</strong> in Lincolnshire. Here all is stone-built \u2013 to the highest quality \u2013 and baroque in spirit. The building types \u2013 theatre, assembly room and elegant shops as well as large terraced houses \u2013 act as reminders that provincial towns were once the centres of their own world, places of culture, sophistication, fashion and local pride.</p> <p>A walk through the streets of Stamford today offers striking contrasts. There is wonderful 18th-century architecture \u2013 the memorable George Hotel on St Martin's offers a vivid vignette of the glorious age of coach travel \u2013 and there are the more commercial streets, now too often strewn with litter and lined with bland shopfronts and chain stores.</p> <p>In Wales the coastal town of <strong>Tenby</strong>,<strong> </strong>with its nearly complete late-13th-century walls, was created as a fortified redoubt of English and Flemish settlers and merchants within Wales. Much survives of this period, but there is also evidence of the town's brief time as a resort for the early-19th-century novelty of therapeutic sea-bathing. So elegant walks look onto splendid beaches that were once part of the town's medieval defences and by the Regency period were picturesque attributes of a fashionable pleasure.</p> <p>Among defensible towns, little can compete with <strong>Berwick-upon-Tweed</strong>, the long-disputed border town between Scotland and England. It has Britain's only complete set of 16th-century town defences, and within these the town is mostly Georgian, including a sprawling early-18th-century barracks designed in bold and masculine baroque manner by Sir John Vanbrugh's <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_of_Works\" title=\"\">Office of Works</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-394834452\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/pictures/2012/8/17/1345196844665/The-Roman-Catholic-cathed-008.jpg\" alt=\"The Roman Catholic cathedral in Armagh.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Roman Catholic cathedral in Armagh. Photograph: Alamy</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>One of my favourite towns, and one often overlooked, is <strong>Armagh</strong> in Northern Ireland. Its two cathedrals, both dedicated to St Patrick \u2013 one medieval and Protestant, the other mid-19th-century and Catholic \u2013 eye each other from high ground at either end of Armagh. Because of the cathedrals and its administrative importance, Armagh was made a city in 1994, one of the UK's smallest. Both cathedrals are remarkable \u2013 the Protestant one largely because of its glorious monuments, the Catholic one because of its astonishingly ornate and colourful Gothic Revival architecture.</p> <p>But for me the great glory of Armagh is its domestic and civic architecture, much of it Georgian and the legacy of an enlightened late-18th-century Protestant cleric, Archbishop Richard Robinson. He gave the town a number of buildings of fine design that express admirable and civilised virtues, including a handsome neo-classical public library, built in 1771, and an observatory, built in 1790.</p> <p>More visually thrilling are the streets: the park-like Mall, lined on one side with splendid late-Georgian houses, and, best of all, the terrace on Vicars Hill, by the Protestant cathedral. The house facades have no ostentatious detail: the doors are simply marked with blocks of stone, the windows no more than holes punched in the rendered wall. But what holes! In their proportions and relationships they reflect classical design stretching back to the Renaissance, Rome and beyond. In their humility and self-effacing beauty, they are emblematic of all that is best about UK architecture.</p> <p>\u2022 <em>Dan Cruickshank presents BBC2's The Country House Revealed, and Brick by Brick: Rebuilding Our Past</em></p>",

Like much of the north-west coast, the area is crammed with Viking names, including <strong>Tranmere</strong> \u2013 the only football team in England with a Norwegian Viking name \u2013 and now host to four spanking new road signs commemorating the site of its former Viking assembly at Thingwall. Must-sees are the magnificent Viking hogback tombstone at the church of <strong>St Bridgets </strong>(<a href=\"http://www.stbridgetschurch.org.uk/\" title=\"\">stbridgetschurch.org.uk</a>) at <strong>West Kirby </strong>and the reconstructed Irish-Norse cross, showing not pillaging but a Viking couple embracing.</p> <p>Vikings fans can then pop on the ferry from Liverpool and visit the <strong>Isle of Man</strong>, which, like the Wirral was once a Norse colony, with its Assembly at Tynwald Hill, in the village of St John's. Stand there and imagine you were the Viking law-speaker 1,000 years ago, then visit the superb <strong>Braaid Viking farmstead</strong> (<a href=\"http://www.iomguide.com/braaid.php\" title=\"\">iomguide.com/braaid.php</a>, free) and the reconstructed longship at the <strong>Manx Museum </strong>(<a href=\"http://www.gov.im/mnh/heritage/museums/manxmuseum.xml\" title=\"\">gov.im/mnh/heritage/museums/manxmuseum.xml, free</a>). Then you could hop back over the Irish Sea to the <strong>Largs Viking Festival</strong> in <strong>Ayrshire</strong> (<a href=\"http://www.largsvikingfestival.com\" title=\"\">largsvikingfestival.com</a>, most events free) before heading to more former Viking colonies in the <strong>Shetlands</strong> and <strong>Orkneys</strong>.

After a moment he asked, \"Is it a proper castle, or just a load of old ruins?\" Two castles that pass the \"proper castle\" test are <strong>Castle Rising</strong> in <strong>Norfolk</strong> (<a href=\"http://www.castlerising.co.uk/\" title=\"\">castlerising.co.uk</a>, \u00a34/\u00a32.50) and <strong>Middleham Castle</strong> in <strong>North Yorkshire</strong> (<a href=\"http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/daysout/properties/middleham-castle/\" title=\"\">english-heritage.org.uk/daysout/properties/middleham-castle</a>, \u00a34.40/\u00a32.60).</p> <p>Castle Rising, built in the 12th century, was home to Queen Isabella after the murder of her husband, Edward II. The well-preserved keep is surrounded by massive earthworks, and I can recommend the child-friendly audio guide. Middleham was the childhood home of Richard III, and no modern child could fail to be impressed by the grandeur of the castle or its setting in Wensleydale, best admired from the viewing platform.</p> <p>As 2015, the 800th anniversary of the granting of Magna Carta, nears, I also have to mention <strong>Runnymede </strong>in <strong>Surrey</strong> (<a href=\"http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/runnymede/\" title=\"\">nationaltrust.org.uk/runnymede</a>, free), surely one of the most famous locations in medieval history. In 2015 the British Library will celebrate with a large exhibition, but it's also worth visiting the watermeadow by the Thames where King John made peace with rebellious barons in 1215. Walk by the river, visit the memorial and try to imagine the scene when John agreed the terms of what would become one of the most famous documents in the world.<br>\u2022<em> Claire Breay is lead curator, medieval and earlier manuscripts, at the British Library, London</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395037374\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/pictures/2012/8/17/1345199402854/Sutton-House-London-001.jpg\" alt=\"Sutton House, London\" width=\"460\" height=\"290\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sutton House, London.

Its castle dominates the town, and just outside are the remains of a great medieval priory (<a href=\"http://www.lewespriory.org.uk/\" title=\"\">lewespriory.org.uk</a>, free). Founded in the 11th century, it was one of the richest monastic houses in England, with a church the size of a cathedral. In 1537 the priory was granted to Thomas Cromwell, the architect of the dissolution. Always a man in a hurry, he brought in an Italian engineer to blow up the buildings he didn't want, and built a house called Lord's Place for his son Gregory. The Victorians almost completed the destruction by putting a railway line through, but the beautiful South Downs setting survives, and it's a lovely place for a walk.</p> <p>Just a moment from the priory ruins is <strong>Anne of Cleves House</strong> (<a href=\"http://sussexpast.co.uk/properties-to-discover/anne-of-cleves-house\" title=\"\">sussexpast.co.uk/properties-to-discover/anne-of-cleves-house</a>, \u00a34.70/ \u00a32.40) on Southover High Street. It's doubtful Henry VIII's unwanted fourth wife ever saw this pretty timbered manor, but it was part of her divorce settlement. Its furnished rooms include a splendid bedchamber and a kitchen. The museum displays melancholy stone carvings from the priory, and there is a gallery bristling with weaponry and ironmongery. A house on this scale, unpretentious and domestic, gives a better idea of Tudor life than many more celebrated sites, and there's a calm and pretty garden.</p> <p><strong>Michelham Priory</strong>, near Hailsham in<strong> East Sussex</strong> (<a href=\"http://sussexpast.co.uk/properties-to-discover/michelham-priory\" title=\"\">sussexpast.co.uk/properties-to-discover/michelham-priory</a>, \u00a37.30/\u00a33.90), was another Cromwell property. But this one was treated more gently, so the moated ruins are extensive and atmospheric. Set among orchards and vineyards, it was a small house, with just eight canons in residence in 1537. It's mellow and family-friendly, with a working watermill, a herb garden and a splendid Elizabethan barn.</p> <p><strong>Farleigh Hungerford Castle</strong> (<a href=\"http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/daysout/properties/farleigh-hungerford-castle/\" title=\"\">english-heritage.org.uk</a>, \u00a34/\u00a32.40) in a green valley on the <strong>Somerset-Wiltshire</strong> border, was built in the late 14th century and owned by the Hungerford family for 300 years. It's a ruin, though there is an intact chapel where knights and ladies lie on their tombs. The atmosphere is especially serene, though it's hard to imagine why, because the Hungerfords were a villainous crew. A 16th-century Hungerford had her husband strangled and his remains stuffed in the kitchen furnace. Another tried to starve his poor wife to death, but Henry VIII's headsman put an end to his activities. A 17th-century Hungerford gambled away the manor in a game of bowls. English Heritage has restored the site in an intelligent and sympathetic way.</p> <p>Just where you don't expect a Tudor house, on Homerton High Street in gritty Hackney, east <strong>London</strong> stands <strong>Sutton House </strong>(<a href=\"http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/sutton-house/\" title=\"\">nationaltrust.org.uk/sutton-house</a>, \u00a33/\u00a31). It was called Bricke Place in 1535, when it was new and gleaming and built amid fields. The National Trust shows off dark panelled rooms that have survived many owners, but it's close to my heart because its builder was one of my favourite Tudors. Trained by Thomas Cromwell, Ralph Sadler attained high favour with Henry VIII, and built Bricke Place for his bride. Ralph was an ambitious young courtier and she was a widow, a servant; it was a love match; the curators will tell you about the bizarre turn that events took when Lady Sadler's first husband rose from the dead. Ralph Sadler was still working at the age of 85, in harness at the trial of Mary Queen of Scots. He outlived all his generation, and died the richest commoner in England. <br><em>\u2022 Hilary Mantel's novel about the life of Thomas Cromwell, Wolf Hall (Fourth Estate \u00a39.99), won the Man Booker Prize in 2009.

It's perched on a hilltop near Junction 29a south of Sheffield, and you can't help but stare as you pass. It looks like a fairytale castle, with dinky battlements and turrets. Although it appears older, it is a Gothic, chivalric, romantic recreation of a medieval castle begun in the 1610s. It incorporates up-to-the-minute details from Italy, such as naked classical gods and goddesses having an orgy, and \"lascivious beasts\" decorating the fountain of Venus in its garden.</p> <p>The<strong> Banqueting House </strong>in Whitehall, <strong>London</strong> (<a href=\"http://www.hrp.org.uk/banquetinghouse/\" title=\"\">hrp.org.uk</a>, \u00a35/free), designed by Inigo Jones, represents the future of British architecture. Built in the 1620s, and the only surviving bit of the great, lost palace of Whitehall, the Banqueting House prefigures all those later, classical, Georgian museums and terraces and government buildings. It's easy to miss it as you walk along Whitehall, because it looks so familiar, but it really was the first of its kind. Inside, Rubens painted ceilings immortalising the Stuart dynasty. This is why, in a moment of delicious irony, the Parliamentarians chose to execute King Charles I directly outside.</p> <p>Go to <strong>Ham House</strong> (<a href=\"http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/ham-house/\" title=\"\">nationaltrust.org.uk/ham-house</a>, \u00a39.90/\u00a35.50)<strong> </strong>in <strong>Richmond</strong>, west London, for life after the Restoration, including tiny, richly decorated 17th-century closets used as repositories for jewels, secrets and silence. Charles II, his dissolute courtier buddies and his merry mistresses enjoyed themselves in interiors like these. Nearly a century from where we started, <strong>Hampton Court Palace </strong>(<a href=\"http://www.hrp.org.uk/hamptoncourtpalace/\" title=\"\">hrp.org.uk</a>, \u00a316.95/\u00a38.50) heralds the arrival of the baroque and the influence of France rather than Italy. Built from 1689 by William and Mary, after they deposed the despotic and Catholic James II, this is a palace for a pair of constitutional monarchs. It's the British version of Versailles: Louis XIV was an absolute monarch, and his grandiloquent palace reflects his absolute power. William and Mary had given some royal power away to Parliament, so their palace is a cut-price version: beautiful, yet also warm and friendly, with cheap red brick as well as expensive white stone. <br><em>\u2022 Dr Lucy Worsley is the chief curator of Historic Royal Palaces and a TV presenter</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395037377\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/pictures/2012/8/17/1345199066224/Stourhead-House-Wiltshire-001.jpg\" alt=\"Stourhead House, Wiltshire\" width=\"460\" height=\"277\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Stourhead House, Wiltshire.

The interior, filled with treasures amassed by the Hoare family, is no less engaging than the Arcadian dreamland outside. With its grotto, temples and water features, it illustrates how an 18th-century gentleman envisioned an earthly paradise \u2013 albeit through the eyes of Poussin and Claude Lorrain.</p> <p>The history of the Georgian era isn't just about country houses and Jane Austen heroines. The <strong>Foundling Museum</strong> (<a href=\"http://www.foundlingmuseum.org.uk\" title=\"\">foundlingmuseum.org.uk</a>, \u00a37.50/free) in <strong>London</strong> does an excellent job of offering an insight into the struggles of the poor, telling the story of London's abandoned children and the philanthropists, including George Frideric Handel and William Hogarth, who helped create the capital's first Foundling Hospital.</p> <p>Equally breathtaking is the <strong>Essex</strong> and <strong>Suffolk</strong> scenery that formed the background to John Constable's childhood. <strong>Dedham Vale </strong>and <strong>Flatford Mill</strong>, along the Stour river, are the subjects of some of his most famous images.

  "<p>The decision of Rafael Correa, Ecuador's charismatic and often hot-tempered leader, to grant political asylum to Julian Assange has gone down well with his supporters, who see their small country taking the moral high ground. But for his critics, the move is typically provocative and damaging to the country's international standing.</p> <p>Rosana Alvarado, a national assembly representative of Correa's Alianza Pais party, was at the forefront of 50-strong crowd of protesters who gathered near the office block housing the British embassy in Quito.</p> <p>Alvarado said Ecuadoreans were people who had learned to survive and assert their sovereignty in an \"upright and decent way\". She said Ecuador wanted to protect Julian Assange, who had \"taken on the big powers, the huge empires and economic interests to defend freedom of speech\".</p> <p>\"We don't defend impunity,\" she added but stressed that Swedish officials turned down the opportunity to interview Assange at the Ecuadorean embassy in London.</p> <p>\"The coincidences are very strange,\" she said of the allegations of sexual assault faced by Assange in Sweden. \"I don't believe it could be an accident that a scandal of this kind surged when he was taking on the big powers for having revealed sensitive information.\"</p> <p>It was a small but noisy protest. Chants ranged from \"colonialism go home\" to stronger expressions such as \"England: colonial son of a bitch\", which rhymes in Spanish.</p> <p>\"This set-up trial [in Sweden] is just a farce so they can deliver Julian Assange to the United States and apply the death penalty,\" said Rosario San Roman, a journalist.</p> <p>Despite his support for Assange's whistleblowing, Correa has had a troubled relationship with the Ecuadorean press. In February, Carlos P\u00e9rez, editor of the main opposition newspaper, El Universo, was granted 14 days asylum in Panama's embassy in Quito after the country's high court upheld a conviction of criminal defamation against him and other senior editors following a highly critical editorial column. Correa later pardoned them and waived a $42m damages award.</p> <p>\"There was no safe passage for P\u00e9rez when he sought asylum in the Panamanian embassy,\" said Ramiro Crespo, director of Analytica, a Quito-based thinktank. \"There's a contradiction between the way [Correa] has treated Assange and his lack of respect for journalists and the political opposition at home. It would be nice if he didn't insult them and accuse them of corruption every Saturday.\" President Correa has a weekly programme on the state-owned channel.</p> <p>Crespo described the asylum move as a \"distraction\" to draw attention away from Correa's domestic problems including legal security, the centralisation of executive power and freedom of expression. \"Right now Ecuador is not a real democratic republic where there is a proper separation of powers.\"</p> <p>He added that, in granting asylum to Assange, Correa had reinforced his \"anti-Americanism and assertion of Ecuador's sovereignty\" which went down well domestically, although it would probably have little impact on his already high popularity. Opinion polls show Correa has a 70% approval rating, largely due to his huge social spending in the poor nation of 14 million people. General elections are set for January 2013 and Correa is expected to win.</p>",
  "<p>Ecuador is still willing to negotiate with the British government over the fate of Julian Assange, despite the Foreign Office's \"threat\" to arrest the WikiLeaks founder inside its embassy and the \"intimidating\" police presence in and around the building, according to a senior Ecuadorean diplomatic source.</p> <p>The South American country's decision to grant political asylum to the 41-year-old Australian, who faces allegations of sexual assault in Sweden, has provoked a bitter political row between Quito and London.</p> <p>The source complained that the UK government's written warning that it could use the <a href=\"http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1987/46/section/1\" title=\"Section 1 wording\">Diplomatic and Consular Premises Act 1987</a> to arrest Assange inside the embassy had been accompanied by a large increase in the number of police officers at the Knightsbridge building.</p> <p>The police presence, it added, had risen from two or three to around 50, with officers on the embassy's fire escape and at every window. This was described as \"an absolutely intimidating and unprecedented use of police\" designed to show the British government's desire to \"go in with a strong hand\".</p> <p>However, the source said that Quito had been encouraged by a phone call made by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office to the Ecuadorean ambassador on Thursday. \"The FCO called the ambassador yesterday to confirm that it still had the will to talk and negotiate, so we'll keep talking,\" it added.</p> <p>\"The fact that they called the ambassador makes us think that the letter with the threat of using domestic legislation to make an incursion into the embassy and arrest somebody inside was a mistake \u2013 as was the intimidating increase in the number of police surrounding the embassy on the same day the letter was delivered.\"</p> <p>It stressed that Ecuador was willing to co-operate with the British and Swedish authorities over the matter of Assange's extradition to Sweden. \"In the negotiations with the FCO, Ecuador has been proposing that we would be prepared to accept an undertaking from the UK and Sweden that, once Julian Assange has faced the Swedish investigation, he will not be extradited to a third country: specifically the US. That might be a way out of it and Ecuador has always said it does not want to interfere with the Swedish judicial process; we could facilitate it.\"</p> <p>The source said the Ecuadorean government had been bolstered by the support it had received since deciding to grant asylum to Assange, adding: \"We are moved by the overwhelming level of solidarity that Ecuador now has in the [Latin American] region.\"</p> <p>Asked how Assange was coping with the pressure of life in the small embassy, where he has been living for 55 days, the source said: \"He's fine. He's not stressed out. Given the fact that he has been under pressure for so long and that his legal fight has gone through so many different levels, I think that for his safety he always had a last resort.\"</p> <p>Scotland Yard declined to comment on the policing operation at the embassy, while an FCO source said the letter sent to the Ecuadorean authorities on Wednesday was not menacing and that the rights of the country's officials would continue to be respected by the government.</p> <p>\"The letter was not a threat,\" said the source. \"There had already been many meetings with the Ecuador government. It was just that it was quite clear that they were close to making a decision and we wanted them to know the law. It was merely signposting the fact.\"</p> <p>The foreign secretary, William Hague, was informed about diplomatic developments on the Assange case, although a spokeswoman declined to divulge further details, saying: \"We are not providing a running commentary.\"</p> <p>At a press conference on Wednesday, Ecuador's foreign minister, Ricardo Pati\u00f1o, released details of the contentious letter, which he said was delivered through a British embassy official in Quito.</p> <p>The letter said: \"You need to be aware that there is a legal base in the UK, the Diplomatic and Consular Premises Act 1987, that would allow us to take actions in order to arrest Mr Assange in the current premises of the embassy.\" It added: \"We need to reiterate that we consider the continued use of the diplomatic premises in this way incompatible with the Vienna convention and unsustainable and we have made clear the serious implications that this has for our diplomatic relations.\"</p> <p>Pati\u00f1o said that Ecuador rejected the \"explicit threat\" made in the letter, adding: \"This is unbecoming of a democratic, civilised and law-abiding state. If this conduct persists, Ecuador will take appropriate responses in accordance with international law. If the measures announced in the British official communication materialise they will be interpreted by Ecuador as a hostile and intolerable act and also as an attack on our sovereignty, which would require us to respond with greater diplomatic force.\"</p> <p>Hague has denied suggestions that the FCO was threatening \"to storm an embassy\", saying: \"We are talking about an act of parliament in this country which stresses that it must be used in full conformity with international law.\"</p> <p>He has also said that Assange will not be allowed safe passage out of the UK despite the asylum decision, and that diplomatic immunity should not be used to harbour alleged criminals.</p> <p>It is unclear whether Assange will address his supporters at the embassy on Sunday, as has been reported. He has described the granting of political asylum by Ecuador as a \"significant and historic victory\".</p>",
  "<p>On Thursday afternoon, the atmosphere outside the Ecuadorean embassy was vibrant. Inside was Julian Assange, granted asylum by President Rafael Correa, presumably doing whatever it is he's been doing since he sought refuge there in June.</p> <p>An anonymous supporter said: \"He's got his computer, so he's bound to be all right.\" For the embassy staff, it must be like having a teenage stepson, the price of a much desired union but maybe a bit of a pain in the neck. But the critical question now is not how to live with him, but how to arrange it so they can go back to living without him.</p> <p>Assange cannot stay indefinitely in the embassy, and can't be bundled into a car, but he could, said Farhan, 42, \"be put into a crate, and taken to an airport. You can't open diplomatic luggage\". Farhan had come as a \"legal watcher\", so that, if the British government does intend to breach article 31 of the Vienna Convention (which states that a host country can't enter consular premises), at least people will be watching.</p> <p>Phil, 29, another legal watcher, said: \"What's the health and safety angle on that? You could give him airholes, I suppose.\" Alex Cole, a bystander, said: \"It's like Schr\u00f6dinger's cat, he only exists for as long as you're not allowed to check he's in there.\"</p> <p>Kris, a friend of Farhan's, was arguing with Sophie Harman, 31, a doctor of international politics, with a variety of fields of expertise, including feminist political economy; at one point, he left and returned with some Starbursts.</p> <p>On social media, the Assange case has become a cantankerous troll-fest, with one side vaunting that anybody with any anxiety at all about the possibility that Assange will be extradited from Sweden to the US must therefore be pro-rape, while the other side maintains the alleged rape victims must be lying, because the US is evil.</p> <p>People who can be bothered to turn up outside an embassy have a different approach, one in which they talk to each rather than try to shut each other down.</p> <p>Shaun, 47, believes Assange would be in \"very grave danger\" if he went willingly to Sweden, but Harman counters: \"I don't know why Sweden would unilaterally try to build this relationship with the US.\" She continued: \"The way that sexual violence is treated in international relations is despicable. In DRC [Democratic Republic of Congo], rape is an act of war. Here, it's a conspiracy against Assange.</p> <p>\"With Dominique Strauss-Kahn, he was just a bit iffy. It's always the case with rape charges that the women are dismissed.\"</p> <p>There were supporters of Assange who wouldn't talk to the Guardian, because of the paper's poor relationship with the WikiLeaks founder. \"It's written by toads\", one woman told me. \"Not you,\" she amended politely. \"I don't know what you write about.\"</p> <p>In general, it was discursive, heated, friendly, and alive. The police were 50-50, some cheerful, some issuing instructions with that insufferable jobsworthy passive sentence structure: \"I need you to be making it safe for others to use the pavement.\" It's possible they were playing good cop/bad cop.</p> <p>On Friday morning, the standoff continued but the crowds had dissipated: or rather, the crowds of media, who'd always made up the majority, were still there, all in their professional semi-circles round a neat, groomed presenter, occasionally scowled at by a shopper in difficult shoes trying to get to Harrods.</p> <p>Telesur and TeleAmazonas led the interest but the Beeb was there as well. Two drunks and someone (who wanted to be nameless) from Occupy were the only others, by mid-morning. He said: \"I think there's a massive protest outside the Russian embassy about Pussy Riot. So everyone's gone there.\"</p> <p>He smiled, as if to say: \"What are we waiting for?\" Certainly, anyone waiting for Assange's case to go one way or the other could be here for some time.</p>",
  "<p>Sir Alex Ferguson has warned Rio Ferdinand to be careful when tweeting in future after the defender was fined \u00a345,000 by the Football Association for his reference to the term \"choc ice\" on the social forum. Ferdinand was found guilty of improper conduct in a case where Lord Ouseley, the chairman of Kick It Out, gave evidence in the case.</p> <p>Ferguson said: \"Although Rio is mature he has still got to remember that one word can make a difference on these things, you can't [take] it back.\" The manager questioned why Ferdinand had been charged by the FA and why the case was heard in secret. \"The only thing that surprises me is players have tweeted for years and it's not been challenged by the FA, he said. His status in the game has caused that, who he plays for could be another issue.</p> <p>\"I don't understand Twitter, I don't know why anyone should get involved with it. We have given instructions to the players that nobody should tweet about Manchester United.\" Ferdinand received the charge for making comments two days after Ashley <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/ashley-cole\" title=\"\">Cole</a> gave key evidence on behalf of his Chelsea team-mate John Terry during the latter's trial at Westminster magistrates court in July.</p> <p>Terry was acquitted of racially abusing Anton Ferdinand, Rio's younger brother, when Chelsea played at QPR last October, and the United player had been responding to another Twitter user describing Cole as a \"choc ice\", meaning black on the outside and white on the inside.</p> <p>Ferdinand responded: \"I hear you fella! Choc ice is classic. Hahahahahaha!!\" He later deleted the tweet and claimed on Twitter that it was slang for someone being \"fake\", but the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/fa\" title=\"\">FA</a> charged him with making improper comments that included a reference to ethnic origin and/or colour and/or race.</p> <p>After his case was heard in Manchester this week, a statement from the FA on Friday confirmed: \"Manchester United's Rio Ferdinand has been fined \u00a345,000 after an Independent Regulatory Commission found proven a charge of improper conduct in relation to a comment posted on Twitter.</p> <p>\"The Commission decided that the comment was improper and brought the game into disrepute. In addition, the Commission found that the breach included a reference to ethnic origin, colour or race. Ferdinand was fined \u00a345,000 and warned as to his future conduct.\"</p> <p>In its written reasons for the case, the Commission stated that: \"Ouseley's evidence was that 'choc ice' is an offensive and insulting term such as coconut or bounty, used to question a person's identity based on the notion that they have a dark outer skin but inside they act as a white person. Lord Ouseley accepted in cross-examination that there are other interpretations of the words. Mr Ferdinand stated that the words 'choc ice' ... was a reference to race, has the same meaning as coconut or bounty, but it means the person is fake\". <strong> </strong></p>",

  "<!-- Block 1 --> <p>10am: Welcome to the county cricket live blog for the latest round of Championship action. Our writers will be here with all the day's play shortly. Richard Rae will be at Yorkshire v Derbyshire at Headingley and Scott Oliver is at Trent Bridge for Nottinghamshire v Durham.</p> <p>In the meantime catch up on the reports of yeaterday's play: <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/aug/16/graham-onions-nine-wickets-durham\">read Scott's report of Graham Onions's stunning day on T here</a>, and read Richard's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/aug/17/anthony-mcgrath-yorkshire-derbyshire\">report from Headingley here</a>.</p> <p>And here's Paul Weaver's piece on Jiang Shuyao, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2012/aug/17/jiang-shuyao-cleethorpes-cricket-china\">the Chinese cricketer crossing boundaries in Cleethorpes</a>.</p> <!-- Block 2 --> <p>11.26am: Remarkably, given last night's appalling forecast, <em>Richard Rae</em> has just watched the covers being removed at Headingley. Even more amazingly, the Yorkshire players are warming-up. It's still grey and damp, of course, but such is the improved drainage at the ground, any sort of dry spell will lead to play starting within half an hour or so \u2013 so an 11am start, or reasonably soon thereafter, is on the cards. The updated forecast is for heavy rain starting around 2pm, but given how much it has already changed, who knows:not the Met Office, apparently.</p> <p>If we do start the Yorkshire bowlers will have their tails up after Tim Bresnan, having been released by England - it sounds so much nicer than dropped or left out \u2013 dismissed Derbyshire captain Wayne Madsen leg before with the last ball of the yesterday's play. As Yorkshire proved in reaching 400-5, however, the wicket is playing pretty well, despite the fact Anthony McGrath, who scored a century, reckons it has more grass on it than any wicket he's seen at Headingley for years. It appears to be the sort of track on which once you've got the measure of it, there are runs to be made \u2013 but if you're not careful, wickets can fall in bundles. As Yorkshire proved in losing their last five wickets for nine runs in 15 balls. They were slogging, and slogging badly, but even so.</p> <p>One thing seems certain \u2013 Derbyshire, clear at the top of Division Two, will surely have no interest whatsoever in setting up a game. Yorkshire will have to bowl them out twice to win this match. A potentially fascinating session lies ahead of us - weather permitting.</p> <!-- Block 3 --> <p>11.28am: Good morning from Trent Bridge where, despite the presence of leaden skies and much morning drizzle, the busy presence of the ground staff suggests that there will be a prompt resumption, writes <em>Scott Oliver</em>. Lovers of pathetic fallacy* (yer TS Eliots, yer Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquezes) will no doubt suggest that the foreboding autumnal skies are apt to capture the day that Nottinghamshire's season came to an end at the hands of Graham Onions.</p> <p>Those burrowing around in the bottom of Pandora 's Box, meanwhile, will suggest that the Cricketing Gods are providing a last-chance saloon session for Notts to prevent ther Championship campaign from flatlining once and for all. If Durham make north of 200, you would suspect that there is no way back. Messrs Phillips, Fletcher, Carter and Franks - it is over to you.</p> <p>* One may be pathetic, one may be prone to fallacy, but that doesn't mean you are fond of their combination</p> <!-- Block 4 --> <p>12.44pm: Aside from a three-over burst of anger and frustration (and all the other emotions Brian from Spaced used to depict in his work) from gesticulating Notts fielders, the cricket at Trent Bridge this morning has progressed fairly serenely, which suits only one side. Stoneman has again looked impressive and has 74 out of Durham's 115 for 1, <em>writes Scott Oliver</em>.<br> The source of Notts' ire was a couple of loud, consecutive appeals against Keaton Jennings that were rejected by umpire Steve Gale, who the fielding team clearly feel owes them a couple, maybe three, from yesterday. Mullaney got a stinker (height), Franks had a rough'un (pitched outside leg), Hales's might also have been going down. I asked Mr Onions last night whether he felt they were all out and, pre-empting an answer, qualified it with \"\u2026even though it will say so in tomorrow's paper\", failing to realise that I could have in fact written that they were dubious. \"Well, there you go\", he answered, unable to prevent the hint of a grin appearing. Walking round from pavilion to press box when the grousing on the field and grumbling in the stands were at its brief zenith, Mick Newell had a spectator (a real one, not Nev) say: \"Need some new umpires aaht there, Mick\". Newell deadpanned: \"Well, there's enough in the crowd\".</p> <!-- Block 5 --> <p>1.08pm: In response to reader demand, click <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/cricket/13629853\">here</a> to find a list of links to today's county commentaries on the BBC</p> <!-- Block 6 --> <p>1.49pm: It's been Yorkshire, Ryan Sidebottom and Andrew Hodd's morning at Headingley, <em>reports Richard Rae</em>. </p> <p>In his first innings as Yorkshire wicketkeeper, Hodd took three outstanding catches off Sidebottom's bowling. The first required him to dive to his right and take the ball low and one-handed off Usman Khawaja for 3: the other two to his left, two handed in front of first slip to dismiss Matt Lineker for 14 and Dan Redfern for 3. </p> <p>That left Derbyshire on 42-4, but since then Wes Durston and Ross Whiteley have put on 50, with Durston fastening on to a series of loose deliveries from Steven Patterson. Durston hit eight boundaries in reaching his 50 in the over before lunch, off 66 balls. Derbyshire 98-4 at the break.</p> <!-- Block 7 --> <p>3.26pm: It was nice to finally get some food in the belly \u2013 fish, chips and mushy peas, if it's of any interest \u2013 as your correspondent has felt a little bleary-eyed today after burning the candle at both ends in a couple of Nottingham's hostelries these last two nights, <em>writes Scott Oliver</em>.<br> On Wednesday I partook of a Big Lebowski quiz, annexing myself to a team comprising four members of a band called Awesome Sex (\"a sort of \u2013 ugh \u2013 techno-pop\", I presume, but didn't ask) which has recently splintered from Hot Japanese Girl. Nice to see new fourpieces using SEO when choosing their names these days... Anyway, there were many White Russians imbibed, although mixed with a little too much ice for Awesome Sex's taste ('Jackie' did not make \"a helluva Caucasian\"). It was just a pity that Rob Smyth wasn't in town, for <a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/aug/15/the-spin-england-west-indies-1991\">his Spin </a>this week contained, as an epigraph, one of the more gratuitous Lebowski references you'll ever see. In the spirit of such gratuitousness, then, if anyone happens to be an aficionado of the movie and has some free time when it starts raining shortly (gloom here that Scyld would be contractually obliged to describe as \"Stygian\"), I once posed the question: <a href=\"http://reversesweeper.blogspot.co.uk/2011/03/what-can-big-lebowski-teach-us-about_4519.html \">What can The Big Lebowski teach us about cricket?</a> It's <em>just a game</em>, man.<br> Last night, I popped in to see An Audience with Carl Froch, the Nottingham-born \"three-time world super-middleweight champion\" interviewed by 5Live's Darren Fletcher, before posing kerchingingly for photos with his fans (they cost \u00a310 each). Overall impression was of an articulate, magnanimous, down-to-earth figure who spoke with good humour about his life in and out of the ring and the three-fight plan he has to bring his career to a close, culminating in an open-air affair at Forest's City Ground, \"my Vegas, my Madison Square Garden\". One thing he has never done is duck an opponent (not literally, of course), unlike a couple of the British \"silver-spoon jobs\" who went soft with multi-fight TV contracts behind them, and he said that if he were forced to fight any of the Benn-Eubank-Collins 'Golden Era' triumvirate, he would probably chose the former, as \"he probably would have walked on to me shots\".  In the time it has taken me to type out that paragraph, the players have been forced off by a steady drizzle.</p> <!-- Block 8 --> <p>3.28pm: And the long forecast rain has finally arrived at Headingley, where <em>Richard Rae </em>is joining the players - figuratively speaking - in taking an early tea. </p> <p>The groundstaff are busy covering the entire square, suggesting they think that might it for the day - and they're almost certainly right. In the 58 overs played thus far, Derbyshire have moved on to 163-5, with the only wicket falling after lunch that of Wesley Durston for a splendid 84 made from 115 balls: he pushed forward at an Azeem Rafiq delivery that squeezed through bat and pad and on to the stumps. </p> <p>Rafiq has bowled well, certainly better than all the other Yorkshire bowlers with the exception of Ryan Sidebottom, who swung the ball at a decent lick from the Rugby Stand End this morning. 'Sid' was well backed up by the catching of Andrew Hodd, who took three fine catches behind the stumps. Tim Bresnan has been particularly disappointing, not making the batsmen play enough. Watched by England selector James Whittaker, he looked like he was trying to bowl too fast. </p> <p>I can't help feeling Yorkshire have let a real opportunity slip by here. Two or three more wickets and they could have come back tomorrow with a real chance of enforcing an innings victory.</p> <!-- Block 9 --> <p>5.46pm: Down in Nottingham doing twelfth man duties for Durham for the first two-and-a-half days was Michael Richardson, the reserve wicket-keeper and son of former South African Test gloveman Dave, now the ICC's CEO, <em>writes Scott Oliver</em>.<br> Richardson <em>fils</em> knows the city very well, having studied Finance, Accounting and Management for three years at the University of Nottingham, during which time he played two seasons a mile or so along the river, south-west of Trent Bridge, for the wonderfully named Notts Unity Casuals CC \u2013 the place at which Notts' director of cricket, Mick Newell, played all his club cricket, from the junior ranks right up until he finished in 2002. <br> \"I was told that if I had any ambition to play for Nottinghamshire, I should go and play for them,\" Richardson recalls, possibly victim of one of the oldest sales lines in English league cricket. Newell claims never to have seen Richardson bat at Unity (\"busy\", he reckons) but did once share a beer down there with Richardson Snr. Mind you, the presence of his father used to make Michael \"a little nervous, for some reason\". Also at Unity for Richardson's first season was adopted Son of Notts, Darren Bicknell \u2013 Surrey-born, of course, but still up here playing for Caythorpe in the Nottinghamshire Premier League as well as Cambridgeshire in the Minor Counties Championship, and still scoring runs in that slow-motion-yet-never-rushed manner of his. Richardson says that he learned much from \"Denzil\", a batsman who fell just 69 shy of 20,000 first-class runs: \"He always used to have a quick strike-rate, but not really liking for shots. Because he was such a good timer of the ball, he didn't really look to manufacture anything. He just batted within his means and made the bowlers come to him\". There in the second season was livewire Pakistani Test keeper Adnan Akmal, \"a lovely chap, actually, who took the gloves from me\", just as he later would his own brother, Kamran. Richardson now spends his winters working for Durham's main shirt sponsor, Brewin Dolphin, the year-round residency helping him in his quest to gain a UK passport (at present, he plays as an EU passport holder, courtesy of his half-German mother, that he cannot pass on). The work also ties in with his degree as he keeps half an eye on his post-cricketing life, where he may also follow his father's footsteps. But for now, aged 25, he wants to develop his game further and add to his nine first-class appearances. Standing in his way is the redoubtable 'Colonel' Mustard: \"It would be a lie if I said I didn't [look at the county cricket wicket-keeping merry-go-round] but I've got a few opportunities with the seconds and I'd like to break in to the first team as a batsman\". If he does, he'll be secretly hoping his Dad isn't there to watch.</p>",
  "<p>Thus far, much of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/aug/17/julian-assange-ecuador-asylum-row\">coverage of Julian Assange's successful political asylum application to Ecuador</a> has focused on the international legal and diplomatic aspects and implications of the case. In fact, domestic Ecuadorian politics have played a vital role in the decision-making process for the administration of Ecuadorian President Rafael Correa.</p> <p>The backdrop to the Assange case has been the upcoming presidential election in Ecuador, slated to be held just six months from now in February 2013. President Correa, who was first elected in 2007, will be seeking a second term under Ecuador's 2008 constitution.</p> <p>Opinion polls published in the Ecuadorian media in 2012 have shown Correa with a commanding lead over his prospective opponents, largely because there is no consensus challenger. <a href=\"http://www.eltelegrafo.com.ec/index.php?option=com_zoo&amp;task=item&amp;item_id=39858&amp;Itemid=2\">Polling from CMS in March showed</a> Correa with just under 49% of the vote, more than 40 points ahead of the five included challengers, who polled between 1% and 9% each. Thiry percent of voters, however, said that they had not chosen a candidate to support. <a href=\"http://www.larepublica.ec/blog/politica/2012/07/24/lasso-ya-encabeza-el-peloton-de-candidaturas-opuestas-a-correa/\">More recent polling has shown</a> the emergence of Guillermo Lasso as the closest prospective candidate with 17% of the vote, while undecided voters fell to 17%. Correa held fast with 50% of the vote.</p> <p>With a split field, Correa is practically guaranteed a win. Ecuadorian electoral law does not require the winning candidate to garner a majority of the popular vote; if a candidate receives at least 40% of the vote and is at least 10 points ahead of the next finisher, he or she wins in the first round.</p> <p>Election observers, including the Correa campaign, view Guillermo Lasso as the candidate most capable of forcing a runoff and, indeed, possibly winning the election. Despite being the former head of a major bank (the Bank of Guayaquil) and an economic adviser to former President Lucio Gutierrez, Lasso began the campaign unknown to most voters (he pulled just 4.6% in the March 2012 poll). However, Lasso and his team have launched aggressive efforts to <a href=\"http://www.telegrafo.com.ec/index.php?option=com_zoo&amp;task=item&amp;item_id=43322&amp;Itemid=2\">promote him in television and print media</a>. Thus far, with a focus on domestic issues and image cultivation, Lasso in particular has been able to start to close the gap with Correa, hoping to push out the other prospective opposition candidates and turn the contest into a two-horse race.</p> <p>This brings us back to the Julian Assange case, which has been used to great political effect by President Correa to redirect the nation's focus from the presidential campaign to a riveting legal and diplomatic affair of international significance. Each day that Assange and the asylum case dominates the airwaves is one fewer day for Lasso to introduce himself to voters and work to find a consensus platform for the opposition.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/17/world/americas/ecuador-to-let-assange-stay-in-its-embassy.html\">forceful anti-imperialist and anti-colonial rhetoric of Correa and Foreign Minister Pati\u00f1o</a> in the context of the UK's threat to remove diplomatic protections from the Ecuador Embassy in London have been couched in nationalistic terms for the Ecuadorian population. Essentially, Correa has wrapped himself in the flag \u2013 in a such a way that his conservative opponents are not able to criticize him effectively, lest they seem unpatriotic.</p> <p>This is a familiar approach for Correa. He used similar tactics back in 2010 when he declared that the police riot and strike represented an attempted coup d'etat. Stirring nationalist and populist furor, he <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/oct/01/ecuador-revolt-coup-rafael-correa\">shut down both a brewing internal rebellion among leftists within his party and efforts from the opposition on the right</a> to slow down his left-leaning reform agenda.</p> <p>Though the six months until February's vote is a long time in electoral politics, Ecuador's new elections law make the current period particularly important. According to the reforms passed in January, political speech in the media, such as campaign advertising, is <a href=\"http://cpj.org/2012/01/in-ecuador-reforms-restrict-election-coverage-for.php\">severely restricted for the final 90 days before election day</a>. In effect, it means that Guillermo Lasso and the opposition have only until November to make a serious dent in Correa's lead by way of campaign advertising.</p> <p>Therefore, the longer and more dramatic the Assange case is, and the longer Ecuador's diplomatic dispute with the UK and Sweden continues, the more the Ecuadorian election campaign will dwell on international affairs \u2013 a sphere the incumbent Correa dominates in relation to his opponents. With far fewer risks than the major electoral benefits it delivers, the diplomatic spat is clearly in Correa's political favor.</p>",
  "<p>Success stories are thin on the ground in Spain these days but Inditex, the retail clothing giant that includes Zara, appears immune to the slings and arrows of misfortune. Last week its founder, Amancio Ortega, was named by Bloomberg as the <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-08-07/ortega-passes-buffett-as-world-s-third-richest-person-video-.html\" title=\"\">third richest man</a> in the world, with a personal fortune of \u20ac37.5bn (\u00a329.4bn). The company, the world's biggest clothing retailer, has tripled its stock market value over the past three years with profits up 30% on 2011 for the first quarter of this year.</p> <p>Even in Spain, where consumer spending has nosedived as a result of spending cuts and mass unemployment, Inditex has increased sales by a modest 1%, while competitors such as Mango saw profits fall by 38.5% in 2011, despite increased worldwide sales.</p> <p>The extraordinary thing about Inditex being a global leader is not just that it's Spanish, but that it's a success story that began and remains headquartered in Galicia in Spain's wild, windswept north-west. It is one of Spain's poorest regions and has always had high emigration. At election time politicians have to go on the stump in Buenos Aires and Mexico City, because expats account for as much as 30% of the vote in some Galician constituencies. In short, Galicia is not a place you establish a global empire, but that's what Ortega has done.</p> <p>Galicians are famously enigmatic and, although he was raised in Le\u00f3n and moved to Galicia as a teenager, Ortega is an enigma, the personification of the reclusive billionaire. He never gives interviews and is rarely photographed. Pablo Isla, the chief executive appointed mid-crisis in 2011 when Ortega stepped down, doesn't give interviews either.</p> <p>The key to business success in Spain, where many of the most successful companies are family concerns, is often to be <em>de buena familia</em> but Ortega's origins are of the humblest. His mother was a maid and his father worked on the railways. He started work as a delivery boy in a textile firm and learnt the business from the ground up. He got the idea that good quality clothes should be made affordable to ordinary people and this led to him founding Zara in 1975 with his first wife.</p> <p>\"Ortega has been in the right place several times,\" says Jos\u00e9 Luis Nueno of IESE Business School. \"When he started out he was competing against small players with poor distribution in a country that was just discovering fashion.\"</p> <p>Now Zara has 1,659 branches worldwide and accounts for nearly 70% of Inditex's income. Ortega retained a 59% stake when Inditex went public in 2001. Few people would class Ortega as being in the same groundbreaking mould as Sergei Brin or Mark Zuckerberg, but his company has revolutionised the fashion business every bit much as Google and Facebook have revolutionised communications.</p> <p>\"Other companies copy the fast fashion model but only for 10% or 20% of their operation,\" says Nueno. \"For the rest, they stick to the old seasonal collection model. For Inditex it's a combination of design, logistics and store management that makes it possible to do it on the scale they do.\"</p> <p>Zara can get a new design made up and distributed in a week, and it launches about 12,000 new designs every year. To get this in perspective, when Marks &amp; Spencer hit the skids at the beginning of this century, its turnaround time for a new design was close to a year. At Zara, there is no warehousing and reorders are rare, which is one reason the company never advertises: by the time you get to the shop the garment in the ad will have sold out.</p> <p>Secondly, the customer is king. Imaginative use of IT and turning its shop assistants into market researchers means Zara has real-time information about what is selling and where. If customers say they like it in blue but would prefer it in purple, within a week it will be there in purple. This rapid response is made possible partly by keeping most of its production in Europe, largely in Spain, unlike others who have put all their eggs in the Chinese basket.</p> <p>\"Proximity has become very affordable,\" said Nueno. Labour in China is becoming more expensive, as is transport. Inditex is developing integrated operations in Turkey, north Africa and Portugal, areas where the textile industry had been wiped out by competition from China.</p> <p>But the company isn't just alert to its customers' fashion whims. It uses renewable energy sources at its main plant in Arteixo in Galicia and when it discovered a supplier in Brazil was sub-contracting to sweat shops, its response was as firm as it was quick.</p> <p>Then there's the Armancio Ortega Foundation, managed by Marta, daughter of his second wife and heir to the family fortune.</p> <p>While Spain's Galician prime minister, Mariano Rajoy, has slashed spending on schools, Ortega's foundation has just dished out \u20ac11m to create 750 nursery school places in Galicia. Jobs, social responsibility and huge profits \u2013 what's not to like?</p>",
  "<p>Stoke are arguably the most successful promoted side of recent years. Since joining the Premier League in 2008 the Potters have never been in a relegation battle, and Tony Pulis is keen to ensure this season is no different. \"Gradually we're putting things into place that this football club could never have dreamed of and we mustn't get too greedy. Staying in the Premier League is our target,\" he said. Newly promoted Reading will be looking to emulate their opponents' top-flight staying power, but manager Brian McDermott may find himself with a tough task on his hands.

  "<h2>WE'RE NOT GONNA' WIN THE LEAGUE, WE'RE NOT GONNA' WIN THE LEAGUE, AND NOW YOU'RE GONNA' BELIEVE US \u2026</h2> <p>The Fiver has had enough, just about enough, of the new season. Even before a ball has been kicked, it is already too much to take. You see the Fiver is tired, oh so tired, after Mr Roy's European adventure and the Big Games. There has been no summer holiday, no trip to sunny Lincolnshire, no drunken abandon on the Costa Brava, not this year.</p> <p>And now, after just coming round to the prospect of nine more relentless months of it all, Roberto Mancini has delivered the fatal blow. \"[Robin] Van Persie was the best striker last year. I was serious last week when I said Manchester United were the favourites,\" scoffed the Manchester City manager. Oh the pain. The Fiver was so disconsolate after hearing this that it spent hours pacing around Guardian Towers, overcome with a mixture of rage and sadness, before embarking on a cantankerous stomp up the motorway to Carrington, muttering imprecations and purchasing a bag of tungsten-tipped screws to prod Mancini with moderate-to-firm force.</p> <p>Yes, we must now face the prospect of such tedium emanating from each manager who actually believes his side has a chance of challenging for the title. \"No, you have the better players;\" they all insist; \"no we aren't very good at all,\" they say, \"no we don't even want to win the league,\" they roar. The Fiver harks back to days of yore when press conferences didn't consist of disingenuous codswallop, if ever such a time existed.</p> <p>Mancini was referring to United's purchase of Robin van Persie, who signed a four-year contract today about which Lord Ferg had this to say: \"The boy wanted to come to us and that's important. He turned down various clubs to join us because he wants the challenge of coming to the biggest club in the world. I think that's fantastic.\"</p> <p>Maybe United are the favourites this season, maybe Chelsea are, maybe Southampton are; to be honest The Fiver is long past caring. It's been too busy marching up the hard shoulder of the M1, contemplating which part of Mancini to attack, before sulky teenager Andre Villas-Boas forced a swift turn of the heels to hot-foot it back to London. \"It's different for us this year. It's a new start under a new management team, but we want to build on last year,\" mused the silky-toned AVB. Ah the classic \"we need to build\" line, the oldest of chestnuts in the managerial textbook. Well, AVB, as long as you don't position yourself at the top of the table, end up in court and spectacularly capitulate before getting the boot, then you will have achieved that grand aim.</p> <p>The Fiver had barely made it back into the capital before Roberto Di Matteo decided to get in on the act. \"I still believe Man City is the favourite,\" countered the Chelsea manager with a late king-maker. \"They haven't lost any key players, but Van Persie is a good signing for United. We have to try and catch up with the Manchester teams. The gap last season was big so our aim is to catch them up \u2026 all the players are looking forward to finally starting. Our aspiration is to do better than last season in the Premier League.\" Hold on to your hats, the Big Cup champions want to finish higher than sixth.</p> <p>If all that doesn't leave you licking your lips in anticipation, then I don't know what will.</p> <h2>QUOTE OF THE DAY 1</h2> <p>\"It is an offer that you cannot refuse.

If Robin Van Persie cost Manchester United the reported \u00a320m and they are paying him the reported \u00a3200,000 per week then over 4 years he will cost the club \u00a360m. RVP's average number of goals over the last four seasons is 22.25 and if he keeps that up over the next four years that equates to about \u00a3675,000 per goal \u2013 see I told you it would be an interesting fact \u2026 Oh.\" \u2013 Ian Thomas.</p> <p>\"'You thought we could be decent men in an indecent time.

  "<p>The Daily Telegraph <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/9481240/Tory-class-of-2005-will-be-promoted-in-Government-reshuffle-next-month.html\" title=\"\">has revealed</a> that in the Cabinet reshuffle expected next month, David Cameron will focus his attention on the 2005 intake of MPs over the 2010 contingent. Disappointed at the willingness of the 2010 intake to rebel \u2013 as was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/jul/10/house-of-lords-reform-halted\" title=\"\">threatened by so many on the issue of Lords reform</a> \u2013 the PM is instead said to be looking to reward loyalty among the group of parliamentarians who won seats under Michael Howard's campaign.</p> <p>Back when New Labour was telling us we had seen the end of boom and bust economics, the Tories ran their campaign on the argument that Britain was headed in the wrong direction. The campaign centred around greater numbers of police, cleaner hospitals, lower taxes, school discipline and controlled immigration. The head of policy co-ordination in the campaign was David Cameron. This intake of MPs asked the country if they were ready to say goodbye to Tony, and if voters were thinking what these MPs were thinking. Michael Howard won 33 seats in 2005, increasing the number of Conservatives in parliament to 168 \u2013 but in the age of coalition politics, career prospects for many seemed imperilled by the \"big, bold, and generous\" offer to the Liberal Democrats.</p> <p>Loyalty may finally reward <a href=\"http://www.stephenhammondmp.com/\" title=\"\">Stephen Hammond</a>, the MP for Wimbledon who is currently parliamentary private secretary to Eric Pickles. Formerly in the City, he is in favour of cutting business taxes to promote inward investment and a big believer in expanding home ownership. Hammond made no claims under the second homes allowance, has not rebelled, and is scandal-free. This reshuffle will show whether rebelling against the coalition has hindered the prospects of MPs like the member for Broadland <a href=\"http://www.keithsimpson.com/\" title=\"\">Keith Simpson</a>, the grammar-school-educated former shadow foreign affairs minister who didn't make it into the coalition cabinet.</p> <p>The closest <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/person/5897/david-burrowes\" title=\"\">David Burrowes </a>\u2013 the MP who took Enfield Southgate back for the Tories after Portillo lost it \u2013 has got to scandal was inviting Facebook users to supply their suggestions for his child's names. Burrowes has never rebelled. Neither have <a href=\"http://www.marksimmonds.org/text.aspx?id=1\" title=\"\">Mark Simmonds</a>, <a href=\"http://www.andrewmurrison.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Andrew Murrison</a>, <a href=\"http://www.tobiasellwood.com/\" title=\"\">Tobias Ellwood</a>, <a href=\"http://www.lancaster4mk.com/\" title=\"\">Mark Lancaster</a>, <a href=\"http://www.benwallacemp.com/\" title=\"\">Ben Wallace</a>, or <a href=\"http://www.andrewselous.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Andrew Selous</a>, some of the other names being floated by the Telegraph and the influential <a href=\"http://conservativehome.blogs.com/\" title=\"\">Conservative Home website</a>. If there's a reason that those names are unfamiliar, it's because these MPs aren't frequenting chatshow green rooms, GQ photoshoots, or popping up on TV to cause trouble for the party. Other than their gender, what these MPs have in common is an aversion to controversy. Like many of the older school, these Tories are concerned with policies which matter to individuals. They're interested in jobs, rail networks, cutting regulation, and improving our police services.</p> <p>Expect the reshuffle to reward the quiet loyalty of the functional, and not the outspoken. Cameron knows that many in his party want him to move the political focus away from awkward issues such as gay marriage or constitutional change, and towards building a manifesto for post-coalition government. Many of these people are members of the <a href=\"http://conservativehome.blogs.com/parliament/2012/04/what-is-the-2020-group-matthew-barrett-profiles-the-tory-mps-trying-to-renew-the-cameron-project.html\" title=\"\">Conservative 2020 group</a>, an organisation that is broadly supportive of the Cameron approach. This reshuffle will be used to bring in the right of the party, but also to overlook the outspoken and the rebellious. If the names coming out from Downing Street are indicative of who's going to get the nod, any MP looking for promotion off the backbenches should avoid the limelight.</p>",
  "<p>The Chinese may be coming, but it's a moot point as to whether they'll be coming to Britain. Hence the culture secretary's Jeremy Hunt's efforts this week to reassure Britain's frustrated tourism and aviation leaders who have long urged the government to simplify the costly visa regime that deters these potential visitors.</p> <p>Although the figures are disputed, about 25-50% more Chinese tourists are believed to visit France than Britain; some indicators suggest there are up to eight times as many visits. A UK visitor visa requires lengthy forms with original supporting documents and costs \u00a378, compared with the \u20ac60 (\u00a347.60) that buys access to the whole European Schengen zone. The UK visa also requires biometric data, which involves applications in person, although Europe will follow suit next year.</p> <p>Hunt's latest promise to the tourism industry that he would work hard to boost the Chinese market was marred by news that the home secretary, Theresa May, strongly opposed any relaxation of the rules.</p> <p>One airline director said that the Home Office still views China as more a source of asylum seekers and economic migrants than consumers. Companies are also concerned about the Chinese business visitor market, with potential trading partners facing difficulties in securing UK visas.</p> <p>Adam Marshall, of the British Chambers of Commerce, said: \"China is a fast-growing trading partner for Britain, so we need to do our utmost to welcome both tourists and business visitors from the world's largest country. Unfortunately, businesses trading with Chinese firms report that the process of securing UK visas is both expensive and cumbersome.</p> <p>\"If individual tourists and Chinese companies can secure more flexible Schengen visas at a lower cost, the sad reality is that many companies here in Britain could lose substantial business.</p> <p>\"Ministers say they want Britain to be open for business. They need to ensure that the visa regime doesn't undermine the goal of increased exports, tourism, and trade.\"</p> <p>Willie Walsh, the boss of International Airlines Group, parent company of British Airways, has been vocal in his condemnation of the regime as bad for business, after being told repeatedly on a trade mission to China by businessmen how hard it was to get a visa.</p> <p>An IAG spokeswoman said: \"The Olympics should give us a huge boost. But are we going to squander that springboard for growth and jobs? Chinese tourists are shunning the UK.</p> <p>\"And Chinese businesses are locating in other parts of Europe. Our visa regime is like swimming the 100 metres through treacle. We want a simpler system or we will continue to lose business.\"</p> <p>Patricia Taylor, director of strategy at VisitBritain, the national tourism agency, said: \"Because we're an island we have to work even harder. With Schengen you get 25 countries on one visa, and most Chinese tourists want to do a tour of Europe. We want to balance the economic growth opportunities with the obvious desire to keep our borders safe.\" VisitBritain and others have proposed shorter, guaranteed times for visa processing, allowing applications in Mandarin, creating more centres in China where people can apply in person, and lowering the barriers for those who already possess a Schengen visa.</p> <p>Hunt said he would be \"looking at improvements to the visa system\".</p> <p>According to the UN World Tourism Organisation's latest annual figures, 109,000 Chinese tourists visited Britain in 2010, a figure dwarfed by the 907,000 visiting France and 511,000 going to Germany.</p> <p>However, these figures have been called into question by Sebastian Wood, Britain's ambassador to China, who wrote to the home secretary in May complaining: \"It is hard to frame debate when there are so many competing sets of statistics in circulation.\" He said that numbers of visitor visas issued by Schengen countries in 2010 totalled 609,000, 159,000 from France, compared with 151,000 from the UK \u2013 a figure rising to 193,000 in 2011.</p>",
  "<p>The Chinese are on the verge of leapfrogging the Germans and Americans to become the nation whose tourists spend the most money overseas, as the idea of foreign travel captures the imagination of millions of newly affluent citizens in the world's most populous country.</p> <p>The World Tourism Organisation predicts that the number of overseas trips made by Chinese people will surge from 70m last year to 100m by the end of the decade, from just 5m 15 years ago.</p> <p>Though they spend on average less than their western counterparts, the number of travellers means the total is high \u2013 and rising. China's travellers overseas <a href=\"http://mkt.unwto.org/sites/all/files/docpdf/unwtohighlights12enlr_1.pdf\" title=\"\">spent $54bn (\u00a335bn) in 2010 and $72bn last year</a>, compared with $84bn ($78bn in 2010) for Germans and $79bn ($75bn in 2010) for the US. Officials say the first five months of 2012 saw a 20% increase in Chinese tourists leaving the country.</p> <p>The vast majority of Chinese citizens still holiday at home, if they are lucky enough to afford a trip at all. For those who venture further afield, the top destinations are Hong Kong and Macau \u2013 both part of China, but ruled under separate systems. Many of those journeys are little more than day trips to shops or casinos.</p> <p>But thanks to the expanding middle class, a surge of Chinese tourists has helped to fill hotel beds and cash tills from South Africa to Italy. The luxury stores of Paris are well-staffed with Mandarin speakers, while hotels in London are learning to offer congee (rice porridge) as well as croissants for breakfast and quilts instead of blankets. Selfridges and Harrods started taking China's Union Pay bank card last year.</p> <p>The popular destinations are becoming more varied. Jiang Yiyi, a researcher at the Chinese tourism academy, says people are increasingly keen to take beach or activity holidays rather than simply traipsing round tourist sites.</p> <p>\"In the past, travel packages like 11 European countries in 13 days were very popular, because Chinese tourists cared a lot about the number of countries they could visit,\" said Wang Yali, marketing manager at China Travel Service (CTS). \"Nowadays, they pay more attention to comfort and additional activities. They hope they have enough time to enjoy the sites. They tend to choose 10 days in Greece, or in the UK, France and Switzerland.\"</p> <p>While Chinese tourists do more shopping than others \u2013 partly because of the sky-high luxury taxes at home \u2013 scenery and culture are bigger draws, Wang said.</p> <p>There are also peculiarly Chinese must-sees. Montargis, a small town around 60 miles south of Paris, is a popular stop because key leaders such as Deng Xiaoping lived there in the 1920s. In Cambridge, tourists flock to King's College not for its celebrated chapel but to see a willow by the river, immortalised in one of the best-known modern Chinese poems, Xu Zhimo's On Leaving Cambridge.</p> <p>Overall, Asian, Australian and European destinations still top the list; officially, the UK is more popular than France and Germany, though figures are skewed because while Schengen European visas allow people to visit several countries within Europe (but not the UK) on a single visa, they will only be registered at their point of arrival.</p> <p>But these days, Israel, Tahiti and the Maldives are appearing on itineraries too. CTS has begun chartering flights to the Seychelles for the first time.</p> <p>Destinations are keen to woo Chinese travellers. While official statistics suggest the average Chinese tourist spends $1,000 a trip \u2013 reflecting the fact that many are taking short hops to Hong Kong or Macau \u2013 Jiang said that research for the China tourism academy showed that some spend 100,000 yuan (\u00a310,000) on shopping alone. According to Global Blue, a shopping tourism company, 20% of all tax-free shopping is by Chinese customers.</p> <p>\"Most of our readers aren't travelling to take photos or go to tourist sites, but to experience a different lifestyle. For them, the destination is not the most important thing; the question is how to travel,\" said Li Ying, a senior associate editor at National Geographic Traveller. \"When I wrote a travel feature about London, I advised them on how to live like a Londoner, go to local pubs and experience the local culture.\"</p> <p>China's economic development has not only allowed people to travel, it has also encouraged them to do so, as priorities have changed. For a small but growing number of young people, personal satisfaction and exploration are becoming as important as wealth and security.</p> <p>\"The most important thing is being happy,\" said a Beijing-based IT worker, Bao Chao, who said he and his wife had not looked back since giving up high-flying careers. Last year they took the unusual step of blowing most of the family savings on a three-month, 12,000-mile trip across China with their baby daughter.</p> <p>The 29-year-old's account of the journey caused a stir online, with thousands of users praising him as an inspiration \u2013 or castigating his irresponsibility in spending their nest egg on travel, taking such a long break and touring with such a small child.</p> <p>\"We just wanted to have a family trip and spend time together. I am sure many rich Chinese families could have had an even better holiday, but they do not have time to do it. We made time,\" he said. \"When we have enough money, we'd like to go on a road trip in the US or Europe.\"</p> <p><em>Additional research by Cecily Huang</em></p>",

If you've attended any strangely located concerts, let us know in the thread below.</p> <h2>Bringing Woodstock to Warwick</h2> <p>It must have been in the late summer of 1969 when Warwick's own<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/artist/c7b4135b-d12b-429b-b7ff-2584177536f6\"> Edgar Broughton Band</a> responded to the local council's obdurate refusal to let them organise a second Woodstock in <a href=\"http://www.stnicholaspark.co.uk/\">St Nicholas Park</a> \u2013 it seemed a perfectly reasonable idea at the time \u2013 by driving a mobile gig on the back of a Bedford lorry through Warwick on market day. </p> <p>The refreshing strains of <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ce-v2EyG52Y\">Out Demons Out</a> and a motley audience of hippies, greasers (the nearest Warwick could get to Hells Angels), students and the dispossessed surprised the Saturday crowds and the traders.</p> <p>Revolution was in the air \u2013 it was the nearest Warwick ever came to it \u2013 but, sadly, it was never quite delivered.

It was almost impossible to hold the cold beer cans in the freezing chill down there.</p> <p>If you went up onto the top deck, you could put your ear to any hole and hear his amazing voice piped from below like it belong to a trapped ghost.</p> <p>It was one of the strangest, most beautiful and unforgettable gigs I've ever been to.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-audio\" data-canonical-url=\"http://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/v=2/album=547504233/size=venti/bgcol=FFFFFF/linkcol=4285BB/\"> <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"100\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; width: 400px; height: 100px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/v=2/album=547504233/size=venti/bgcol=FFFFFF/linkcol=4285BB/\" allowtransparency=\"true\" frameborder=\"0\"><a href=\"http://darrenhayman.bandcamp.com/album/the-ships-piano\">The Ship's Piano by Darren Hayman</a></iframe> </figure>  <p><a href=\"http://darrenhayman.bandcamp.com/album/the-ships-piano\">Reading on mobile?

This was sometime in the early 90s, when the Disobey club was making a name for itself with a string of interesting one-off events. </p> <p>The only way of finding out the location for this one was to call a recorded information line. That done, I made my way to the car park and waited what seemed like an age for the gig to start. It consisted of someone driving <a href=\"http://kulchermulcher.wordpress.com/2012/05/09/sonic-warfare/\">Jimmy Cauty's armoured vehicle</a> (it may even have been Cauty himself, we were never told) round and round in circles while the Finnish electronic trio <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pan_Sonic\">Panasonic</a> (as they were then called, prior to a lawsuit from the electronics giant) issued wave after wave of pulverizing noise from speakers attached to the vehicle.</p> <p>Indeed, we never found out whether Panasonic themselves were in the armoured vehicle either. It hardly seemed to matter.</p> <p><em>Richard Rees Jones</em></p> <h2>An 'obscure centre of extreme unhappiness'</h2> <p>Leonard Cohen in 1970 and his band doing a warm-up gig for their Isle of Wight festival appearance.</p> <p>Not a small club, as one might have expected, but in the shabby hall of an old-school asylum outside London.</p> <p>I'd been a huge fan of Cohen since the first album and, while on a personal journey to investigate madness, worked as a student nurse in the asylum.</p> <p>The news that he was to play a concert in this obscure centre of extreme unhappiness, where I was working, was frankly unbelievable to me.<br>When I'd recovered from the shock, I did fear that the author of the undeniably bleak vision of those first two albums might not be a perfect fit for the environment he was to play in.</p> <p>I need not have worried.</p> <p>Cohen was not \"me big star, you listen and shut up\" \u2013 he took one look at the unpromising distracted audience, none of whom had a clue of his status and launched into an impromptu hoe-down style of set with himself as the caller.</p> <p>I can't say that he took all of the 200 or so attendees out of their mental prisons but a significant number got into in it in a big way. He brought some joy into a place of intense misery. I was profoundly moved by his willingness to subsume his ego and his courage in choosing to play such a difficult gig.</p> <p><em><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/17696719\">Heliconius</a></em></p>",

Psychologist Dr Jaye Derrick calls this effect \"social surrogacy\", likening our old TV pals to a virtual friends and family. In experiments involving essay writing and word association, people found it easier to maintain their self-control and concentration if they had also been asked to describe a favourite television show. Others kept diaries to find out how entering \"familiar fictional worlds\" improved their mood. \"[TV] can have unexpected psychological benefits,\" writes Derrick, \"[and] fulfil needs that people are reluctant to fulfil through other means.\"</p> <p>Which is fine, unless you happen to be reacquainting yourself with the devastating final episodes of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/tv-and-radio/2011/apr/01/next-box-set-six-feet-under\" title=\"\">Six Feet Under</a>, M*A*S*H or The Wonder Years.

The team crushed the LA Galaxy on Sunday and then merely held their own, but ultimately lost in both the Open Cup Final against Kansas City and a regular season match against the Earthquakes. Both games were on the road, both were on short rest, both were noble. Both were losses. The loss to Sporting KC cost Seattle their second shot at a major trophy (Santos Laguna eliminated Seattle from the CONCACAF Champions League) and the loss to San Jose likely cost the Sounders a chance at the Supporters' Shield. Both matches were close. There is no reason for despair, but still any chance at a trophy lost is a large negative moment.</p> <p>Coming into the Sounders game against the Whitecaps the team needs to declare dominance. They will be challenged by one of the better defensive teams in the league, but they will have the support of more than 55,000 people. New addition Christian Tiffert will offer more ball control, while a healthy Michael Gspurning commands his backline with his international experience. Young Olympian Mario Martinez is only expected to be available as a sub at most, but Seattle's offense doesn't need help at this time. Both Montero and Johnson are on form at this point and should score a goal or goals. It's time for the Sounders to declare themselves. There is no space left for another poor run. Crunch time and Cascadia in front of crowd that will fit two MLS crowds, that's what everyone wants.</p> <p><strong>Benjamin Massey</strong>, Editor, <a href=\"http://www.eightysixforever.com\">Eighty Six Forever</a>, Vancouver:</p> <p>The good news for the Vancouver Whitecaps is that lately they've been looking great against good teams. Recent victories over Salt Lake and San Jose and credible draws are enough to wash out the stink of Wednesday's game, when the half-strength Whitecaps lost to a half-strength FC Dallas 2-0 in the ugliest match since they gave up the WM formation. What can you draw from a loss when half of Vancouver's starting lineup was injured, suspended, or on international duty? Not much.</p> <p>Not that it gets that much better against Seattle on Saturday. Jay DeMerit is concussed, Martin Bonjour is suspended, and given the way David Ferreira effortlessly handled Vancouver's central defense on Wednesday it's easy to picture Fredy Montero pulling the same tricks. Seattle is excellent, even compared to the best Whitecaps starters, and tough to play at the Clink. Yet, if we treat Wednesday as a one-off aberration, Vancouver's form suggests it should be a heck of a game.</p> <h2>Toronto FC vs Sporting KC, 4:30pm Sat</h2> <p><strong>Sonja Missio</strong>, <a href=\"http://www.90minutesofhopp.com\">90 Minutes of Hopp</a>, Toronto:</p> <p>Toronto FC's Wednesday night hosting of Portland was fairly indicative of its entire season: in front of an excited crowd full of optimism, the match (1) dragged into a slow start, (2) had an early away lead, (3) exploded after the half with hope, a drawing goal, and a chance for the win, and (4) ended with an away equalizer in the 83rd minute. Scripted perfectly like a predictable soap opera, you have to give them this: TFC will never let you down, as long as if you know what to look for. </p> <p>Despite missing quite a bit of the squad due to international call-ups (including newly signed Irishman Darren O'Dea), there were a few notable points fans could take home happy: recent signee Eric Hassli scored his first home goal for Toronto and Milo\u0161 Koci\u0107 was on top form for a couple of great saves. Yes, TFC gave up its three points due to the same problem they always had (namely, their Achilles' heel of a backline), especially in regard to Portland's first goal. And yes, TFC is now back to being in the league's last place. Still, the Hassli goal stands to remind fans good things are still to come. Eventually. Maybe even in this season. </p> <p>That said, from playing the last-placed team in the Western Conference to playing the first-placed in the Eastern on Saturday, Toronto looks ahead to reclaiming those three points at home against Sporting Kansas. With their new signing and the inevitable post game pep talk the team received from Paul Mariner, Saturday may become an example of those \"good things still to come.\" Just, hopefully, Mariner gets his voice back by then.</p> <p><strong>Mike Kuhn</strong>, Editor, <a href=\"http://www.downthebyline.com/\">Down the Byline</a>, Sporting Kansas City:</p> <p>There was no Open Cup hangover for Sporting KC last weekend against DC. After 120 minutes and penalty kicks against Seattle, KC came out and got a big league win against DC that was desperately needed after KC's poor run of form lately at home outside of the Open Cup (0 wins in 4 in league play before the game against DC). And it wasn't as close as the 2-1 score line showed as KC hit the bar a couple times and controlled the game. </p> <p>For the first time in 8 weeks, KC actually didn't have a midweek game ahead of their trip to BMO Field on Saturday. With league, Open Cup, and friendlies, KC played 17 games in 56 days since they last played Toronto on June 16th. Sporting finally get a few extra days of rest and training ahead of the trip, although 3 potential starters are away with their national team. The extra rest for Sporting will be a nice break for the team after the busy schedule and maybe give players a few extra days to heal some of those minor knocks. KC hasn't won at BMO since the very first game there in 2007, since then, KC has 2 loses and 3 draws and haven't scored a single goal. KC has a good chance of ending both of those streaks this coming weekend against a struggling TFC side.</p> <h2>Montreal Impact vs San Jose Earthquakes, 7:30pm Sat</h2> <p><strong>Sofiane Benzaza</strong>, <a href=\"http://www.mountroyalsoccer.com\">Mount Royal Soccer</a>, Montreal:</p> <p>3 wins in a row!!! 3 wins in a row !!!</p> <p>The Montreal Impact continued its winning streak as it defeated another patriotic-themed team. After the Philadelphia Union, the New England Revolution fell to the Impact 1-0. With its 2nd road win this season, Montreal is making a run for the playoffs even if the team has 2-5 more games played than its competition. You know what? Let those teams play and win those games in hand if they wish: the only thing is that these teams will face each other. Another Montreal Impact goal is up for MLS Goal of The Week with Sanna Nyassi's Maradonesque run and cannon shot to give the win.</p> <p>Back at home, Montreal will host the Creme de la Creme in the San Jose Earthquakes and Chris Wondolowski at Stade Saputo on the weekend. It's another must-win situation for the Impact as they face the best team in the league, who have a potent attack, clutch player and very active outside backs. Troy Perkins experience against the Western beast (from his time with the Timbers) will help a lot as the newly acquired goalkeeper registered a shut-out for his new team. Stade Saputo is a fortress and usually no adversaries are spared from taking the heat from the Impact: will Montreal be efficient in front of the net?</p> <p><strong>Lisa Erickson</strong>, <a href=\"\" http: www.centerlinesoccer.com \"\">Center Line Soccer</a>, San Jose:</p> <p>Seattle had a rough week and the Quakes decided to twist the knife a little bit more by winning the game in the 3rd minute of stoppage time. The match was a defensive battle much of the game, with Fredy Montero slotted home an equalizer in the 92nd. But the Quakes didn't worry - they looked at each other, sped down the pitch and got the winner. Shea Salinas floated the ball into the box with 10 seconds left in the match and found the curly blonde head of Steven Lenhart, who headed the ball past Gspurning and into the back of the net.</p> <p>Now allons-y \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al... &#xa0;this will be the first and only time this year that the first place Quakes (14 - 5 - 5) will face the Impact (10 - 13 - 3), who are currently sixth in the East. L'Impact are coming off of a 3 game winning streak and have not lost at home since July 4th. Montr\u00e9al has upgraded their goalkeeper, grabbed a few more Italian stars, and moved into their natural grassy home at Saputo. Their midfield pair of Bernier and Felipe have scored 10 goals and 14 assists between them and will keep the San Jose defense on their toes. The Quakes will have five players coming off of international duty (Wondolowski, Beitashour, Gordon, Bernardez, and Chavez) and will be missing Gordon and Salinas due to red card suspension and hamstring injury respectively. It will be a tough game but I still feel that the Quakes will pull out the win with a score of 3 - 1.</p> <h2>Chicago Fire vs New England Revolution, 8:30pm Sat</h2> <p><strong>Dan Martin</strong>, <a href=\"http://www.section8chicago.com/\">Section 8</a>, Chicago:</p> <p>The 4-goal performance from the Fire in the Union's house was great to see (yes, I'm counting the own goal). Points against teams lower down the standings are crucial right now, so when Philly lined up a less-than-first-choice defense everyone knew the new-look Fire offense could take advantage. Chris Rolfe fans were singing of his romantic prowess as he looked like his old self, scoring almost at will while also setting up chances for his team-mates, and Arne Friedrich's game-winning goal nicely accents his strong defensive form of late. Forward Sherjill MacDonald put himself in good spaces to score and assisted on Rolfe's first goal, but will need to hone his finishing touch. Meanwhile, Captain Logan Pause was injured in a collison but played for almost 20 more minutes with two broken ribs and a collapsed lung before being subbed off. Overall, it was a fantastic result for a Fire side that is starting to show a bit of swagger at both ends of the field and the depth to back it up.</p> <p>It's always a must-see game when New England comes to town. Matches against the Fire's playoff rivals of seasons past never fail to bring a chippy, combative style of play. Pause's absence in the midfield means that Frank Klopas will have adjustments to make, whether he brings in Daniel Paladini or Mike Vidiera to take the captain's spot or takes a chance by starting a lone defensive mid. There have also been rumblings that Fire homegrown player Victor Pineda could see the gameday lineup. I expect the Fire to come out attacking and play for the win, continuing their streak against Eastern Conference clubs and solidifying their spot in the playoff standings.</p> <p><strong>Christopher Camille</strong>, <a href=\"http://www.midnightriders.com/\">Midnight Riders</a>, author of NE tactics blog <a href=\"http://soccertheory.wordpress.com/\">Soccer Theory</a>:</p> <p>Last week the Revs turned in another dire performance in a match that they absolutely needed. After a fast start, Heaps is looking every bit the rookie coach this season. Tactically, the team has taken a midfield shape that is far too narrow when one considers the attacking limitations of their full backs. </p> <p>Heaps really needs to keep it simple as the team goes forward this season. His knack for tinkering has undone the squad on too many occasions. They need to go back to basics and hopefully a basic 4-4-2 is employed against Chicago this Saturday. It would be nice to see how Saer Sene gets on with Jerry Bengston up front. There likely isn't much to be salvaged from the 2012 season for the Revs, but a result in Chicago against a rival would be a great start.</p> <h2>Real Salt Lake vs FC Dallas, 9pm Sat</h2> <p><strong>Matt Montgomery</strong>, <a href=\"http://underthecrossbar.com/\">Under the Crossbar</a>, Real Salt Lake:</p> <p>A dour streak of matches, culminating in a 2-1 road loss to Vancouver, has plagued Real Salt Lake in recent weeks. An unlucky bounce and a brilliant strike condemned the club to fourth straight road loss, but top-to-down, things have just seemed a bit off. Injuries, of course, have taken a toll as well \u2014 particularly as Jamison Olave has been ruled out of contention for some weeks and Javier Morales's body continues to fight against his continued return. Factor in 90 minutes of international duty for Kyle Beckerman (USA), Alvaro Saborio (Costa Rica), and Will Johnson (Canada), and changes are likely on Saturday.</p> <p>It is in this context which this Saturday's home duel against FC Dallas will be looking to turn things around. Rotation, especially with a must-win CONCACAF Champions League match on Tuesday coming quickly, seems rather inevitable. Though fatigue and injuries will play into coach Jason Kreis's squad selection, a recognition that the Supporters Shield is still an attainable if distant goal should mean a strong selection. Youngsters and newcomers like Sebastian Velasquez, Justin Braun, and Kenny Mansally will be hunting for minutes, while some \u2014 Kwame Watson-Siriboe and Luis Gil, particularly \u2014 are practically assured starting spots on Saturday. Should a valuable win materialize on the weekend, Real Salt Lake could be in pole position to challenge San Jose as the season reaches its apex.</p> <p><strong>Parrish Glover</strong>, <a href=\"http://the-inferno.net\">The Inferno</a>, Dallas:</p> <p>Brek Shea is back. His darting run at the defense to set up the winning goal in Azteca shows that the 2011 form and daring are still there. Getting a call-up despite poor recent form and finding productive time almost felt like a subtle jab from Jurgen Klinsmann to Schellas Hyndman saying, \"Play him on the left. Let him run.\"<br> Meanwhile, FC Dallas now finds itself 8 points out of the final playoff spot with 8 games left to play. It's a hard uphill road, but we will be playing meaningful games for a few more weeks. We'll need to continue to put together the types of results that have put us in this position, though. This past weekend saw the team's second come-from-behind victory over Colorado in a month. Wednesday night featured a physical 2-0 win over Vancouver, with goals coming from Fabian Castillo and Jonathan Top. Fans are definitely loving the play from the youngsters, as Castillo (20) and Top (19) combined are about the same age as Kevin Hartman (38). This weekend brings yet another match against a conference foe ahead of us in the playoff race, and therefore another opportunity to claw our way up the ladder. Trips to Salt Lake have often ended poorly for FCD in recent years, but then again the United States had never won in Mexico until Brek Shea showed up.</p> <h2>Colorado Rapids vs Chivas USA, 9pm Sat</h2> <p><strong>Todd Haggerty</strong>, <a href=\"http://www.pidarmy.com\">Pid Army</a>:</p> <p>Last match was typical: the Rapids lost. At least when the Rapids play there is very little chance of a draw, they have only one on the season. Up next, Chivas USA. The hype machine is at full tilt whenever these teams play each other and this has all of the ingredients of a classic... At this point in the season and with the team in complete disarray one can only joke. The squad that will take the field Saturday is increasingly becoming more unrecognizable to the one that rode lady luck and won the title two years ago. Conor Casey is perpetually injured or disinterested, Omar Cummings is apparently the butt of jokes to OP and Tim Hinchey and a whole cast of extras show up to play fullback every week. Looming over all of these challenges is the loss of Pablo Mastroeni; it is hard to imagine the Rapids having their current run of form with him in the squad. Back to the clash of MLS giants, I expect the Rapids to earn their second draw of the season in front of a packed house in Commerce City. </p> <p><strong>Julio Ramos</strong>, \"Chivas Mayor\", <a href=\"http://unionultras.com/\">Union Ultras</a>, Chivas: </p> <p>Last week against the Galaxy was a game that most of the fans will want to forget. To lose was one thing, but they just showed such all round weakness - they allowed the Galaxy to make fun of our supporters and did nothing. It just showed weakness all through the team , and if it wasn't for Dan kennedy it could have been 7-0 not 4-0. No Passion, no guts, no heart.</p> <p>We want the team to be more aggressive. Fight for the ball, show they want it and that they want to be a winning team. To me though, the lack of consistency in the line up and formation is a real problem. The coach is cautious and changes his side round to try and match up to the opposition and their players and system - that's a mistake. We need our own style. Against Colorado we need a win. All the games are crucial now. We have 4 games in hand and we're 11 points out - there's no more room for mistakes and we need to go on a run in those games. </p> <h2>D.C. United vs Philadelphia, 5pm Sun (NBCSN, TSN 2, RDS2)</h2> <p><strong>Kim Kolb</strong>, <a href=\"http://screaming-eagles.com/\">Screaming Eagles</a>:</p> <p>United traveled to Kansas City for an important conference match up, but they did so short handed. Not making the trip due to injury were Dwayne DeRosario, Robbie Russell, Maicon Santos, and Daniel Woolard; four players who were in the starting XI when things were going well for United. Though United did get some backline reinforcement in a midweek trade bringing Mike Chabala. Kansas City is a potent foe as it is, and taking them on missing so much character and talent proved to be too much. United tried to absorb pressure and stay with KC, but fell 2-1.</p> <p>This week, Philadelphia makes the trek down to RFK. The teams swapped players on Thursday, with United sending fan favorite Danny Cruz in exchange for Lionard Pajoy. Cruz won a lot of fans with his work ethic and commitment on and off the field, but with tremendous depth in the wide midfield positions (Pontius, Najar, DeLeon, and Lewis) it was difficult to get playing time, and trading him to somewhere where he will play is a fair thing to do. It looks as though DeRosario will return to the lineup, can Pajoy gell with new teammates in 72 hours? United needs the points, and needs to build momentum heading into the Fall.</p> <p><strong>Corey Furlan</strong>, <a href=\"http://beta.sonsofben.com/\">Sons of Ben</a>, Philadelphia Union:</p> <p>Last week was worst performance of the year to be honest. Looked like we were really disheveled and disorganized. Best I can say is that it might be a tribute to how good Valdes is usually, bot as Hackworth said afterwards, it was unacceptable. Soumare showed a little promise but he's not where he needs to be physically coming off an injury. He's going to be a great addition for the team, but this time he played out of necessity and it showed.</p> <p>The game this weekend at DC? This is it, this is the season. If we don't win this weekend we can forget the season. The Union dug themselves a pretty big hole this year. Can we best DC? It depends on what team shows up - the team that beat Sporting KC 4-1 or the team that lost to the Fire 3-1. I'm interested to see Cruz play after the trade for Pajoy. I think DC got the better end of the deal maybe, but you can't finish 2 out of 10 chances and expect to keep leading the forward line.</p> <h2>New York Red Bulls vs Portland Timbers, 7pm Sun(Galavision)</h2> <p><strong>Dan Dickinson</strong>, <a href=\"http://gothamist.com\">Gothamist</a>, New York:</p> <p>What a difference a week can make. The Red Bulls looked hungry in their third and final match against Houston for 2012, and took away a well earned 3 points. Was it Dax McCarty returning from his suspension? Was it Tim Cahill starting to get into form? Was it perhaps just that Mac Kandji couldn't get one into the net? Any way you slice it, it's always difficult to figure out what the right equation is for what makes NY dominate one match and not show up another.</p> <p>Up next, the Timbers. Last year, both teams were battling to the very end for the final playoff spots. This year, no such drama: RBNY has almost double the points and goals scored. The difference in form could not be more stark: the Red Bulls remain undefeated at home and lead the East in scoring, while the Timbers have not won on the road yet in 2012 (although they did break their four month long road scoreless streak against Toronto on Wednesday). Some may want to scream \"trap game\", but that would require Portland having shown signs of a pulse sometime this year. This should be an easy and convincing win for the Red Bulls.</p> <p><strong>Roger Anthony</strong>, <a href=\"http://www.timbersarmy.org\">Timbers Army</a>, Portland:</p> <p>The Timbers stretched their unbeaten streak to two games \u2013 and their winless streak to seven \u2013 with a ragged-but-entertaining draw in Toronto. Once again, Interim Coach Gavin Wilkinson went with a lineup that had striker Kris Boyd soloing on top. Variously labeled as a 4-2-3-1 or 4-3-3, it's been most successful when it morphs into a 4-1-4-1.</p> <p>That process may have been abetted by the absence of wings Kalif Alhassan (leg) and Franck Songo'o (yellow cards). Without them looking to beat people off the dribble, the ball moved quickly and unpredictably during the first half, giving Portland a rare possession advantage. The game-tying goal in the 82nd minute was produce by three quick touches that culminated with MF Eric Alexander sending LB Steven Smith in alone on Toronto keeper Milos Kocic. When Kocic came out, Smith chipped a perfectly weighted mini-cross to MF Darlington Nagbe, whose header gave the club a very stylish draw and their first road point since April.</p> <p>So now, off to New York and a few interesting questions: Will NY forward Kenny Cooper feast on his former team? Can Boyd rise to the challenge that Cooper presents? Can CB David Horst continue to wreak havoc on corner kicks? For this week at least, the Timbers will count themselves as one of the big winners in the Sebastian LeToux/Dane Richards deal between Vancouver and the Soda Pops. Richards ran wild against Portland last year, and after seeing Ashton Morgan completely befuddle RB Kosuke Kimura in the second half of the Toronto match, Portland is thrilled not to face Richards for another week.</p> <h2>Houston Dynamo vs Columbus Crew, 9pm Sun</h2> <p><strong>Zach Woosley</strong>, <a href=\"http://www.dynamotheory.com/\">Dynamo Theory</a>, Houston:</p> <p>Last game? What game? I know not of this \"game\" you speak of. Since I doubt that will work, I suppose I have to address the Dynamo's 2-0 defeat in New York. It pretty much stunk, but the scoreline was a bit unfair since the second goal was ridiculously offside. Either way, the Dynamo didn't play well and were beaten by an inspired Red Bulls side that needed to bounce back. It's not the end of the world and you can't win every game, especially in MLS, but considering Houston had there chances and couldn't finish them, it's disappointing.</p> <p>Back home to to friendly and oh so orange confines of BBVA Compass Stadium. This time, the Columbus Crew visit, fresh off a midweek game against the LA Galaxy. No offense to the Crew but if the Dynamo don't win this one, I might be tempted to hit the panic button. Even in a parity-ridden league like MLS where the best team can lose to the worst at any moment, this is a game the Dynamo need to win to get some momentum back. I expect to see the Dynamo win and do it in style with a clean sheet, anything less would be uncivilized...or unacceptable...or both.</p> <p><strong>Ian Fraser</strong>, <a href=\"http://crewunion.com\">Crew Union</a>, Columbus Crew:</p> <p>Thanks to Toronto FC and MLS HQ, the Crew were able to spend last Saturday saying goodbye to a teammate and friend instead of playing a trivial game. It didn't take long to get that first game out of the way as the Galaxy rolled into Columbus on Wednesday night. In an evening&#xa0;spent honoring the life of Kirk Urso, the team could've come out with a determined focus or a heavy hearted performance. As it was, Columbus survived a couple Robbie Keane forays early and started to take command but all the chances they created were just off the mark and instead of going into the break with a cozy lead, they were tied at 0. For all the good chances they failed to convert in the 1st half, Jairo Arrieta scored an unlikely goal right away in the second, but Columbus' attacking prowess waned and Robbie Keane was able to sneak in an equalizer to allow the Galaxy to steal a draw. Not the win the team desperately wanted, but they put in a great performance under the circumstances. This game was about something more than a result. RIP Kirk Urso - Forever Massive.<br>&#xa0;<br>This Sunday,&#xa0;Columbus travel to the most recent 'new stadium fortress' in MLS - Houston.&#xa0;This trip is always difficult with the extreme heat and humidity and the Dynamo have been even harder to beat in their new home. Columbus' lineup is really starting to come together and they have been playing well recently, but I wouldn't be shocked if all the events of the last 2 weeks catch up to them in this game. The emotional first game has passed and now they have to turn right around and get ready&#xa0;for this trip. I hate to say it, but I think Columbus will look like a team that has gone through an ordeal in this one&#xa0;and come home with a loss.</p>",

The motorist filed his complaint at the prosecutor's office on Thursday. Depardieu is yet to comment.</p> <p>The star, known internationally for his role in Green Card, his Oscar-nominated turn in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/37086/cyrano-de-bergerac\" title=\"\">Cyrano de Bergerac</a> and a long-term stint as greedy Gaul Obelix in the Asterix movies, made headlines last year over reports that he was ejected from a flight for urinating in the aisle. Depardieu's Asterix co-star, \u00c9douard Baer \u2013 who was on the flight \u2013 said that Depardieu had been barred from going to the toilet shortly before take-off. \"He couldn't wait, so I found this solution,\" Baer told Europe 1 radio. \"I had a little Evian bottle with me, only it was too small so it overflowed. He wanted to clear it up, but the hostess wouldn't let him.\" Depardieu and Baer later made light of the incident by filming a spoof video, which shows Depardieu on a plane in character as Obelix, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/sep/05/gerard-depardieu-wee-asterix-video\" title=\"\">unable to resist his urge to eat wild boar</a>.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Depardieu's bumpy international film career seems to have taken an upward turn.

  "<p>Compared with what's going on in other people's courts, Britain's domestic judicial problems, our ghoulish fascination with the 50-year-old <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2012/aug/17/moors-murderer-ian-brady-arrest\" title=\"\">Moors murders</a> and even <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2012/aug/16/julian-assange-asylum-uk-ecuador\" title=\"\">Julian Assange's extradition fight</a>, are relatively small beer. Across the former Soviet bloc and into nominally communist China we are witnessing dramatic battles to separate justice from politics.</p> <p>That fight is never over as disparate supporters of the WikiLeaks founder and countless other self-styled politicals have insisted down the years, sometimes rightly. Tony Blair felt persecuted by the Metropolitan police even in Downing Street, and this month Standard Chartered bank felt ill-used by what it sees as quasi-political regulatory threats in New York.</p> <p>But the principle that judges should be independent \u2013 \"as long as they behave themselves\" \u2013 was entrenched in English statute law as long ago as 1702. \"Be ye ever so mighty, the law is above you\", as someone put it a few years later. That precept should protect Assange from the wrath of the White House, though it has mostly failed over Guant\u00e1namo Bay.</p> <p>The rules are not so secure in China or Russia; shaky, too, in not-so-different cases which mingle politics and the courtroom in Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria and Ukraine \u2013 all former Soviet satellites and neighbours, three of them EU members, all struggling to establish proper boundaries or (it depends who's talking) to undermine them.</p> <p>They command fewer headlines than Gu Kailai, confessed <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/aug/09/gu-kailai-murder-trial-neil-heywood\" title=\"\">murderer</a> of Neil Heywood in a Chinese hotel room, or <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2012/aug/16/pussy-riot-putin-russia-court-verdict\" title=\"\">Moscow's punk band trio</a>, but are hugely important to their citizens, who question whether we can rely on the law to protect us from the powerful?</p> <p>Is it a gloomy no-win situation? Of course not. Greater transparency is always painful and can mislead people into thinking things are getting worse, because crimes or scandals are being exposed when previously they were covered up.</p> <p>So the glamorous Pussy Riot defenders are surely wrong historically when they say their trial for anti-Putin \"hooliganism\" in a cathedral is a Stalinist show trial. Under Stalin most such trials took place in secrecy, unbeknown to foreign correspondents working a few streets away, imperious to criticism or rebuttal.</p> <p>Pussy Riot are on much stronger ground when they assert that \u2013 despite today's inevitable guilty verdict \u2013 they have beaten the politically manipulated judicial machine by the force of their arguments and their personalities.</p> <p>\"Now the whole world sees that the criminal case against us has been fabricated,\" they asserted in court. It has all happened in public \u2013 too hard to hide in the wired world of today \u2013 and a host of global rock royalty whom Vladimir Putin cannot harm is on their side. It might be prudent for Madonna and Macca to check their tea for polonium, all the same, because Russia seems to be slipping back into lawless ways which will do it no good.</p> <p>Is China inching slowly in the opposite direction? Whatever has been going on in the closed-but-not-quite-secret Hefei intermediate people's court in China these past few weeks \u2013 the trial of disgraced politician Bo Xilai's wife for murder \u2013 it is all but impossible to establish at this time and distance what the real story is. In terms of the facts of the case and its wider meaning for the political direction of China there is only speculation. The <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/aug/17/gu-kailai-verdict-monday\" title=\"\">official verdict</a> is expected next week.</p> <p>Was the Harrow-educated expat and middleman facilitator, Heywood, a greedy blackmailer, who threatened Gu's only son (he had earlier helped get him into Harrow) when a lucrative business deal went wrong, as the official narrative states. Or was he someone disposed of because he threatened to expose high-level corruption? Would the case have come to court at all \u2013 the British embassy did not over-exert itself after Heywood was found dead of a \"heart attack\" \u2013 had not Wang Lijun, the local police chief, taken Assange-style refuge in a US consulate, claiming his life was at risk as a whistleblower?</p> <p>And is the decision to prosecute Gu in this high-profile way simply a byproduct of high politics and the urgent need to kill off the challenge to the Beijing leadership of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bo_Xilai\" title=\"\">Mr Gu, aka Bo Xilai</a>, the ambitious mega-city boss in Chongqing and Mao-era revivalist, who had been using populist policies (curbing mafia gangs and promoting equality) to advance his claims for promotion to the politburo's standing committee?</p> <p>Bo's name has not been mentioned in court, but it is corruption charges he faces, not promotion, if it suits the party to press home its advantage. A handful of Maoist supporters are reported to have been demonstrating outside the court (do they have public school leftists in China now?), which may tell us more about the authorities' wish to have their notoriously opaque legal system look \" normal\" to outsiders than anything else. British diplomats, but no reporters, have been allowed in.</p> <p>So the Chinese trial is more akin to the running dramas in Ukraine \u2013 where jailed former prime minister, Yulia Tymoshenko, faces fresh charges of corruption and even complicity in murder \u2013 and in Romania's standoff between the conservative president, ex-oil-tanker captain, Traian Basescu, and the young (39) prime minister, Victor Ponta, a Blair-ish moderniser in a country where that label is not a stigma.</p> <p>As in Hungary, where the reforming prime minister, Viktor Orb\u00e1n, has frightened a lot of voters with his sweeping constitutional reforms (Paul Krugman calls it an \"<a href=\"http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/12/19/hungarys-constitutional-revolution/\" title=\"\">authoritarian slide</a>\" in the New York Times) since 2010, and neighbouring Bulgaria, where there is a crisis of authority in the court system, the EU has leverage here because all three are members, though not of the single currency zone.</p> <p>Each case is different. Orb\u00e1n's Fidesz party won a 68% mandate from voters in 2010 and used to make what were widely seen as extreme changes to the system, most notably by rigging the constitutional court, packing its membership, making it harder to bring cases and excluding a host of legislation from its remit. When we consider that reform of the eurozone will stand or fall on the ruling \u2013 is it legal? \u2013 of the German constitutional court the comparison is painful. Media control and rigged elections are also on the Hungarian menu.</p> <p>In Bulgaria a judge was dismissed for <a href=\"http://www.novinite.com/view_news.php?id=141237\" title=\"\">unreasonable delays in court proceedings</a>, though actually for criticising the supreme court and the interior minister, critics say. The EU is on the case here too. But all this takes place at a time when the credit-fuelled boom years are over (sounds familiar?) and the former eastern bloc states are under pressure \u2013 also from the EU \u2013 to retrench economically and get their budgets under control.</p> <p>Times are hard and feelings run high. So in Romania, still under the shadow of the brutal and stupid Ceausescu regime, which ended in a hail of bullets in 1989, the standoff between Basescu and Ponta is also about a pro-austerity president whose party lost power after cuts in 2009 and a pro-growth social democrat who says the president should be politically neutral.</p> <p>The EU has been pressing for reform on Romania's notoriously corrupt politics since long before the country was allowed to join Nato in 2004 and the EU in 2007. A <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/jul/29/romanians-unlikely-impeach-president-traian-basescu\" title=\"\">referendum to depose Basescu</a> was overwhelmingly carried by austerity-weary voters in July, but the supreme court has to rule on 31 August whether the necessary 50% of the electorate took part to validate it.</p> <p>Basescu's supporters say he is a genuine reformer who has backed the national anti-corruption department, which is why so many of the political elite want him out. The former prime minister Adrian Nastase, Ponta's mentor, has been jailed for corruption. In London this week <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/aug/14/victor-ponta-romania-president-impeachment\" title=\"\">Ponta told the Guardian's Julian Borger</a> the worst was over and the pair might yet \"cohabit\" if Basescu behaves.</p> <p>Tricky, isn't it? In countries which for the most part lack settled traditions of respect for courts and constitutions, both sides stand accused of manipulating the system for political gain. It is a huge distraction from urgent economic tasks and threatens to deepen voter disillusion. Even in seemingly all-powerful Beijing, party bosses know ordinary Chinese are angry with elite corruption and the frailty of its justice.</p> <p>But the outside world knows more about these proceedings than we would have done in past times. That's progress. Our legal battles nearer home show there is no room to be smug \u2013 but also that we are luckier than we sometimes remember to remember. The rule of law is the anchor for most of what we have.</p>",
  "<p>\"Let's blow trumpets and squeakers and enjoy the party as much as we can,\" says Elyot in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2011/mar/08/private-lives-review\" title=\"\">Private Lives</a>, written in 1930. \"I'm tired of the noise you make with your shrill, boastful trumpeting,\" a character witheringly observes of the local Don Juan in this previously unproduced No\u00ebl Coward play from 1956. What is striking, despite the odd verbal echo, is how Coward, in the quarter-century that separates the two plays, turned from an apostle of bohemian freedom into a sour sexual <a href=\"http://www.historyguide.org/intellect/savonarola.html\" title=\"\">Savonarola</a>.</p> <p>Volcano could be described as lukewarm <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/2009/sep/19/secret-lives-somerset-maugham-hastings\" title=\"\">Somerset Maugham</a>: set on the fictional South Pacific island of Samolo, it deals with carnality among the colonial set. The pivotal, though hazily defined, figure is Guy Littleton, a philanderer allegedly based on <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/ian-fleming\" title=\"\">Ian Fleming</a>. Even though a plantation-owning widow, Adela, resists his seductive charm, others prove more susceptible: his victims include Adela's house guest, Ellen, whose husband also apparently once fell&nbsp;under Guy's spell. The play flirts intriguingly with bisexuality and has one or two flicks of wit: told that the Samolan natives positively worship the local volcano, Guy's visiting wife tartly says: \"I'm finding it difficult to like it.\" But, in general, the play is flabbily written and displays an ageing writer's disdain for the kind of sexual pleasures he once joyously advocated.</p> <p>The piece is well staged by Roy Marsden and persuasively acted. <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0780485/\" title=\"\">Jenny Seagrove</a> has a nice ice-maiden appeal as Adela, and <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0244321/\" title=\"\">Jason Durr</a> as Guy is all languorous, white-tuxedoed charm, as if&nbsp;auditioning for the role of 007. Robin Sebastian as an uxorious plantation owner and Finty Williams as his wife pleasantly embody marital fidelity. But, written from the vantage point of a brooding tax exile, the play puts a case for sexual solitude few would wish to endorse; and when someone cries \"Welcome to our island,\" Coward's insensitivity to a rapidly changing world&nbsp;becomes all too apparent.</p>",
  "<h2>Of tickets and tweets</h2> <p>Twitter has been a game-changer in Edinburgh \u2013 not replacing word-of-mouth but certainly supplementing it. Perhaps more than anything, it allows companies to make contact with each other, find shared areas of interest and to invite each other to each other's shows in the hope of generating positive feedback that can have a real effect on the box office. It doesn't replace flyering (not everyone is on Twitter) but it can certainly be a help. </p> <p>It's a challenge this year to sell seats. As we reported last week, the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/stage/theatreblog/2012/aug/15/edinburgh-festival-2012-fringe\">Olympics were being blamed for a lack of fringe ticket sales</a> during the first week of the festival, and there are further reports that even now at the end of week two some of the <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/comedy/news/did-you-hear-the-one-about-the--comedians-who-cant-fill-a-venue-8054027.html\">big comics are playing not just to empty seats but to entirely empty rows</a>. I've certainly been in plenty of full theatre shows, but I've also noticed that there are few of the queues that you normally see at this stage in the festival. My impression is that people are booking fewer shows and being more selective.</p> <p>Which probably means that brilliant reviews are more important than ever. With increasing numbers of critics on Twitter, it also provides a direct conduit to them. I've found it very useful to be given a little twnudge by companies about their shows and when time is tight I'm much more likely to take a quick look at the link to a production than to download an email about it (you can find me<a href=\"https://twitter.com/lyngardner\"> @lyngardner</a>). Mind you, it's clear that some companies still need a few tips about how best to entice reviewers to their shows. A couple of companies have so bombarded me with tweets about their productions that, I'm afraid, their efforts to get me to their show have had quite the opposite effect. Think about it like this: you wouldn't sit outside someone's house posting the same letter through their letter box again and again, so why do it on Twitter?</p> <h2>What I've heard about the world in Edinburgh</h2> <p>You only have until Sunday to catch Third Angel and Mala Voadora's What I Heard About the World at <a href=\"http://www.northernstage.co.uk \">Northern Stage at St Stephens</a>, a wonderfully quirky consideration of how knowledge is accumulated, how we see the world and how we might change it (though drinking a litre of seawater, one of the suggestions aired in the show, is unlikely solve the problem of rising sea levels). Is it really possible to sum up the world in a series of anecdotes? Maybe not, but Third Angel's collected gems offer as informative take on the world as any government statistics. Although I'm not entirely sure I believe the one about the donkey in Gaza zoo which has been painted with stripes to look like a zebra.</p> <p>Nonetheless, in homage, here are five things I heard about the world while I've been seeing shows in Edinburgh:</p> <p>\u2022 In North Korea there are only five state sanctioned haircuts (courtesy of What I Heard about the World)</p> <p>\u2022 If you live to be 80, you're likely to have spent 23.3 years asleep (courtesy of Beulah at C Nova)</p> <p>\u2022 Soldiers returning to their families from Afghanistan for what is termed rest and recreation call it rowing and reproduction (courtesy of Soldiers' Wives at Assembly Roxy)</p> <p>\u2022 The Chinese city of Shenzhen produces 50% of all the electronic goods in the world, and has a factory with 450,000 workers \u2013 about the population of Edinburgh (courtesy of The Agony and Ecstasy of Steve Jobs at Gilded Balloon)</p> <p>\u2022 Bodybuilders make their veins pop by dehydrating for a couple of days before competition (courtesy of Strong Arm at Gilded Balloon)</p> <p>Let me know what you have learned about the world this Edinburgh.</p> <h2>What to see</h2> <p>This is the quietest theatrical week of the year outside Edinburgh, but the fringe continues to blaze and the <a href=\"http://www.eif.co.uk\">Edinburgh international festival</a> openings keep on coming. Silviu Purc\u0103rete's Gulliver's Travels opens at the King's theatre tonight, Chilean company Teatro Playa explore the legacy of the Pinochet regime in Villa + Discurso, which opens at the Hub on Monday and the RSC has the brilliant Irish singer Camille O'Sullivan offering a musical rendition of The Rape of Lucrece at the Royal Lyceum from Wednesday. The real whopper, of course, is Theatre du Soleil and Ariane Mnouchkine's Les Naufrag\u00e9s du Fol Espoir at the Lowland Hall.</p> <p>I've been hard at the coalface, but have still barely managed to scratch the surface of the <a href=\"http:// www.edfringe.com\">fringe</a>. The hot shows remain much as they were last week, albeit with a few additions: Mies Julie and Knee Deep at <a href=\"http://www.assemblyfestival.com\">Assembly</a> are both astonishing. Not in the same league, but entertaining, are the slapstick piece, Nothing is Really Difficult, and the early years show, Paperbelle, at the Botanic Gardens. Monkey Bars and Beats join the rosta of great <a href=\"http://www.traverse.co.uk\">Traverse</a> shows, which include The Curious Incident of Josephine Bean, Bullet Catch, the Ballad of Pondlife McGurk and Blink. Remor is 11 minutes of astonishment at <a href=\"http://www.Cthefestival.com\">C Nova</a>, where I can also recommend Some Small Love Story, returning from last year, and Beulah. The Economist is worth a look too. There are lots of terrific things at Northern Stage at St Stephen's including Oh, the Humanity and Other Good Intentions, What I Heard About the World, Ugly Sisters, The Price of Everything and best in the World. A Thousand Shards of Glass opens this week and should be worth a look. At <a href=\"http:// www.summerhall.co.uk \">Summerhall</a> I'd go for the extraordinary Caesarean Section, The Shit, Flaneurs and Red, Like Our Room Used to Be. I'll be trying to catch up this week with Amusements, Big Mouth and Songs of Lear, which all look promising. </p> <p>I Heart Peterborough is heartbreaking at the <a href=\"http://www.pleasance.co.uk\">Pleasance</a>, where I'll be catching up with Dirty Great Love Story tomorrow \u2013 about which I hear great things. At <a href=\"http://www.bedlamfringe.co.uk\">Bedlam</a>, both Grit and Strange Wild Song are very promising work from young companies, and I hear good things about Dug Out's Inheritance Blues, which I'll catch up with this week. <a href=\"http://www.underbelly.co.uk\">Underbelly</a> boasts the Old Vic, New Voices programme with Strong Arm, One Hour Only and Bitch Boxer all strong. The Fantasist is also worth checking out. The Agony and Ecstasy of Steve Jobs is definitely a must at the <a href=\"http://www.gildedballoon.co.uk\">Gilded Balloon</a>.</p> <p>Theatre beyond Edinburgh has not quite stopped, but it has certainly slowed down. The end of the week sees Robert Wilson in his own production of Beckett's Krapp's Last Tape as part of the <a href=\"http://www.ardhowentheatre.com\">Enniskillen international Beckett festival</a> . Before that he will be found orchestrating <a href=\"http://www.nnfestival.org.uk \">Walking</a>, an ambulatory performance and installation experience which begins at Holkham on the Norfolk coastline on Monday. </p> <p>Northern treats include the street arts festival <a href=\"http://www.lakesalive.org\">Masquepony</a> at the Lakeland village of Cartmel this weekend. The 60s jukebox musical, Uncle Eric's Hard Day's Night, is new at the <a href=\"http://www.newvictheatre.org.uk\">New Vic</a> in Newcastle-under-Lyme. City of Light at <a href=\"http://www.hulltruck.co.uk\">Hull Truck</a> sounds more promising, an epic community play celebrating the city which begins next Friday. There is just over a week left to catch the <a href=\"http://www.yorkmysteryplays2012.com \">York Mystery Plays</a>.</p> <p>Maria Alberg's iconoclastic King John comes back into the repertoire at the <a href=\"http://www.rsc.org.uk\">RSC</a> in Stratford, and at <a href=\"http://www.oxfordplayhouse.com\">Oxford Playhouse</a> the wonderful Druid company from Ireland revive three Tom Murphy plays: Conversations on a Homecoming, A Whistle in the Dark and Famine.</p> <p>Heading south, <a href=\"http://www.originaltheatre.com\">Three Men in a Boat</a> stops off at the Tobacco Factory in Bristol and Adrian Noble directs Tim Pigott-Smith in The Tempest at the <a href=\"http://www.theatreroyal.org.uk \">Theatre Royal</a> in Bath. <a href=\"http://www.roguetheatre.co.uk\">Rogue Theatre's</a> King Arthur, the Wild Hunt is an immersive theatre adventure in Tehidy Woods near Porttreath in Cornwall. It's almost your last chance for <a href=\"http://www.kneehigh.co.uk\">Kneehigh's </a> Steptoe and Son at the Asylum near Chiverton Cross in Cornwall. </p> <p>In London the show you should really want to see is London Road at the <a href=\"http://www.nationaltheatre.org.uk\">NT</a>. Kieran Lynn's An Incident at the Border moves from the <a href=\"http://www.finboroughtheatre.co.uk\">Finborough</a> into Trafalgar Studios. Meanwhile in SW10, a new play about the Big Society, Barrow Hill, joins JB Priestley's Cornelius in the repertoire. Jason Robert Brown directs his own musical 13 for the National Youth Music Theatre at the <a href=\"http://www.nimaxtheatres.com\">Apollo</a> from Wednesday. Tony Kushner's The Illusion opens at <a href=\"http://www.southwarkplayhouse.co.uk\">Southwark Playhouse</a>.

  "<p>The WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange spent a comfortable night in the Ecuadorean embassy in London after the South American country's decision <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/aug/16/julian-assange-asylum-uk-ecuador\" title=\"\">to offer him asylum</a>, and is said to be \"doing all right\", according to a diplomatic source.</p> <p>More than a dozen Metropolitan police officers stood guard outside the redbrick Knightsbridge mansion block on Friday morning, accompanied by a handful of his supporters who are understood to be planning a show of solidarity and direct action tonight in protest at the British government's treatment of Assange.</p> <p>A strong international media presence remained behind barriers outside, where gutters were full of beer cans and coffee cups.</p> <p>One supporter, Tristan Woodwards, said he had spent the night camped out opposite the embassy to show sympathy. \"I'm here to support Julian Assange and WikiLeaks and to show my disgust at the British government's threat to a sovereign nation's embassy,\" he said. \"It's completely wrong. People talk about the [assault] allegations, but [the UK government's reaction] seems over the top for someone who's supposed to have committed a crime.\"</p> <p>Another supporter, Tammy Samede, said she had decided to keep watch on the embassy to make sure the government acted in accordance with international law. \"To be honest, I'm not a fan of the British government for a lot reasons,\" she said. \"But they're using the need to question him to get him out of here and get him to Sweden, who will extradite him to the US, who will probably imprison him forever or execute him.\"</p> <p>Samede said that while the women who had made the assault allegations had every right to due process, the case should be dealt with \"in the proper manner and not in the political manner\". She said Assange had offered to answer questions by videolink, but British authorities seemed unwilling to let him.</p> <p>Asked how long she would keep vigil, she said: \"It's not the most comfortable place, but standing up for what's right is never comfortable. That's why [Assange] is stuck in a room without a window in the embassy.\"</p>",

He said Assange would be arrested if he leaves the embassy in London where he has lived for nearly two months.</p> <p>Ecuador's decision has also angered the Swedish authorities, who wish to question Assange and the two women who claim he assaulted them during a trip to the country in 2010. Assange denies the assault claims and says he fears being sent on to the United States where he could face political persecution for releasing thousands of secret US cables.</p> <p>The standoff will escalate tensions between the two countries over the fate of Assange, who has skipped bail while awaiting removal from the UK. It follows allegations from Ecuador that the British government has threatened to storm the embassy to seize Assange. Diplomatic posts are often considered the territory of the foreign nation.</p> <p>After a day of dramatic developments and protests, Assange watched the asylum decision from a room in the embassy in Knightsbridge, central London, via a live link to a press conference from the Ecuadorean capital, Quito.</p> <p>Hague responded by saying Assange would not be allowed safe passage out of the UK, and that it was a \"matter of regret\" that the Ecuadorean government decided to grant the WikiLeaks founder political asylum. But Hague said that did not change the fundamentals of the case.</p> <p>Speaking at the Foreign Office, he added the case could go on for a considerable time. \"We will not allow Mr Assange safe passage out of the United Kingdom, nor is there any legal basis for us to do so.\"</p> <p>On Wednesday, British government officials sent a letter to Ecuadorean officials in Quito outlining the powers of the Diplomatic and Consular Premises Act 1987, which allows revocation of a building's diplomatic status if the foreign power occupying it \"ceases to use land for the purposes of its mission or exclusively for the purposes of a consular post\".</p> <p>Hague dismissed Ecuadorean claims that the letter was a threat to \"attack\" their embassy.</p> <p>\"There is no threat here to storm an embassy. We are talking about an act of parliament in this country which stresses that it must be used in full conformity with international law,\" he said. Officials said use of the act has not been ruled out.</p> <p>Hague also denied claims by Assange and his supporters that there was a deal that would see him extradited to the US.</p> <p>The country's foreign affairs minister, Ricardo Pati\u00f1o, said Assange was clear that he is being persecuted for political reasons because of the disclosure of documents by WikiLeaks. \"Ecuador is sure that there is a real threat of him being extradited to a third country, without any guarantees. He would be subject to cruel treatment,\" Patino said in his press conference in Quito.</p> <p>The Ecuadorean government has conducted lengthy diplomatic talks with the UK, Swedish and US governments, Pati\u00f1o said.</p> <p>He said that the UK's reaction amounted to a strong threat: \"It is basically saying, 'We are going to beat you savagely if you don't behave \u2026 but if you behave, we may not beat you savagely.\"</p> <p>An official said Ecuador had acted within international and diplomatic law ever since Assange took refuge inside the building.</p> <p>The Swedish foreign ministry said it had summoned Ecuador's ambassador over the Latin American country's \"unacceptable\" decision to grant asylum.</p> <p>Assange will give a statement outside the embassy on Sunday afternoon, according to tweets posted on the WikiLeaks Twitter feed, prompting speculation that he could be arrested because the property might be outside the embassy.</p> <p>The lawyer of two Swedish women who made allegations of sexual assault against Assange denounced Ecuador's move as \"absurd\". Claes Borgstrom told reporters that the move was an abuse of the asylum instrument, the purpose of which is to protect people from persecution and torture if sent back to one's country of origin. \"He doesn't risk being handed over to the United States for torture or the death penalty. He should be brought to justice in Sweden,\" she said.</p> <p>The Union of South American Nations (UNASUR) has convened an \"extraordinary meeting\" in Ecuador on Sunday to discuss the situation at the embassy.</p> <p>A statement released on the website of the foreign ministry of Peru, which currently holds the rotating presidency of the intergovernmental union, said: \"The Foreign Ministry of Peru lets public opinion know that, in concordance with the statutory responsibilities of the temporary presidency of UNASUR, at the behest of the Republic of Ecuador and after consulting member states, an extraordinary meeting of the Counsel of Foreign Ministers of the Union has been convened on Sunday August 19 in the city of Guayaquil, Ecuador.</p> <p>\"The meeting has been requested with the intention of considering the situation raised at the embassy of Ecuador in the United Kingdom.\"</p>",
  "<h2>Monday</h2> <p>Driving up from Boston, Massachusetts to Montreal in Canada to visit family, we stopped for an ice-cream break in Montpelier, Vermont. Montpelier is unique in that it is the only state capital without a McDonald's. Let's not get too excited; with one main street and a population of under 8,000 there's quite a lot it doesn't have.</p> <p>What it does have is the state capitol building, <a href=\"http://www.vtstatehouse.org/\">Vermont State House</a>, with its impressive gold leaf dome backdropped by the wooded hills of <a href=\"http://www.montpelier-vt.org/group/246.html\">Hubbard Park</a>. Drawing the eye to the building is a rather fine border of salvias and pennisetum. I know it's deeply uncool but I do like these extravagant bedding displays, especially in public parks.</p> <h2>Tuesday</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-394807445\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Lifeandhealth/Pix/pictures/2012/8/16/1345132779632/Tom-Hoblyns-North-America-008.jpg\" alt=\"Tom Hoblyn's North American gardens\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tom Hoblyn's North American gardens. Photograph: Tom Hoblyn</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tom Hoblyn</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Staying with my sister-in-law in Beaconsfield, Montreal. The growing season is pretty tight up here (<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardiness_zone#USDA_Hardiness_Zones\">hardiness zone four</a>) so I figured the planting palette would be minimal, but I was wrong: between lounging in the pool (it's a muggy 40C) and retreating to the icy air conditioning, I found time to take peek at a neighbour's garden. It had the most diverse display of phlox paniculata, baptisia australis, echinacea 'Art's Pride', in filled with miscanthus sinensis (possibly sarabande). Any gaps were plugged with pompom dahlias and a backbone of shrubs such as hydrangea paniculata and clethra alnifolia. The prairie-like palette feels so appropriate in the setting of a colonial-style house in Quebec. </p> <h2>Wednesday</h2> <p>We had lunch with a maple syrup farmer friend south of Montreal where, many years ago, I spent my gap year. Back then we had to collect the sap from prone-to-spill-and-soak buckets hanging from the trees, often wading through thigh-deep snow. Coming up to full moon, the buckets would often need emptying twice in 24 hours.</p> <p>Now the bush is a massed network of blue pipes with strategically placed pumps. The trees look like particularly generous blood donors with their taps leading to yards of tubing and on to vast storage vats. It takes 200 litres of sap to make one litre of syrup. Growing wild on the fringes of the bush (maple woods, acer saccharum) I find my favourite ever perennial, verbena hastata, but in a deep violet blue form. </p> <h2>Thursday and Friday</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-394807446\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Lifeandhealth/Pix/pictures/2012/8/16/1345132852537/Tom-Hoblyns-North-America-008.jpg\" alt=\"Tom Hoblyn's North American gardens\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tom Hoblyn's North American gardens. Photograph: Tom Hoblyn</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tom Hoblyn</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Another family visit took us to the pretty colonial village of Georgeville \u2013 the sort of place you'd expect to see on a tea towel. The village sits on the equally picturesque <a href=\"http://magogquebec.homestead.com/files/home_english.htm\">Lake Memphremagog</a>: 36 miles long, one mile wide and 396ft at its deepest. Most of the time is spent swimming in the lake (it has dropped to 34C) and eating freshly picked <em>mais sucre</em> (sweetcorn). </p> <p>The trip down to the lake takes us past a very \"designed\" garden. Again, lots of prairie plants: helianthemum, phlox, echinacea and a fantastic hydrangea paniculata surrounding the colonial-style house. All very setting-appropriate but totally wrongfooted by an expensive-looking water rill plonked in the middle, with perfect sheets of water cascading over the steel-edged side. Very odd indeed and not up to tea-towel standard.</p> <h2>Saturday</h2> <p>The drive back down to Boston takes us through the scenic <a href=\"http://www.visitwhitemountains.com/\">White Mountains</a>. We savour the stunning Vermont countryside while above us turkey vultures ride the thermals in true cowboy film style. </p> <h2>Sunday</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-394807447\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Lifeandhealth/Pix/pictures/2012/8/16/1345132658438/Boston-public-garden-001.jpg\" alt=\"Boston public garden\" width=\"220\" height=\"310\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Boston public garden Photograph: Tom Hoblyn</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tom Hoblyn</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Our evening flight gives us ample time for some sightseeing around the city. Boston is an amazing place with lots of history (much of it anti-British, what with the Tea Party, revolution and all that). While the family have a rest in the <a href=\"http://www.cityofboston.gov/parks/emerald/public_garden.asp\">public garden</a> (it's back up to 40C with a whopping thunderstorm on the way), I inspect the sumptuous bedding displays. </p> <p>The find of the week \u2013 possibly the entire summer - was hibiscus moscheutos. I suspect it to be the appropriately named 'Disco Belle' \u2013 a definite must-have in my garden for next year. A whole bed of them blossomed under the watchful eye of George Washington.</p> <h2>Monday</h2> <p>Our flight was cancelled and we spent an extra day in Boston. The <a href=\"http://www.gardnermuseum.org/home/\">Isabella Stewart Gardner museum</a> has the best Venetian courtyard garden I have seen.</p> <p><em>\u2022 Thomas Hoblyn is a landscape and garden designer.

  "<p>China, the world's most populous country, might be described as cricket's greatest untapped resource. And now Cleethorpes Cricket Club are doing something about it.</p> <p>Perched on the estuary of the Humber, in northern Lincolnshire, Cleethorpes CC could already claim, with some justification, to know a thing or two about east Asia.</p> <p>Now they know a little more, for they have engaged the services of the first cricketer from mainland China to play in an overseas league. That player is Jiang Shuyao, 24, whose vivid, blood-red batting gloves, the ones he wears when representing China, focus the minds of potentially dismissive opponents.</p> <p>\"Shu\", as he is popularly known throughout the club, has scored 196 runs for Cleethorpes' second team, in the Lincolnshire League, for an average of 24.5 and with a top score of 50, in the middle order. For the academy side, opening or going in first wicket down, he has scored 362 at 51.7, with five fifties and a top score of 98.</p> <p>\"When I wait to bat I want team-mates to get out so I can go in,\" he says, with a mischievous grin and what sounds dangerously like KP-ish solipsism.</p> <p>Meeting him in the pavilion, however, is to realise that he is immensely well-liked in the dressing room. As he watched an under-13 game between Cleethorpes and Doncaster, calls of \"Hello Shu\" or \"Hi Jonty\" \u2013 a reference to Jonty Rhodes, the great South Africa fielder, for Jiang is prodigious in the area of point \u2013 came at regular intervals. Someone bought him a drink. Another player, who lives locally, has given him a room, lent him his bicycle and taken him shopping.</p> <p>The young man from Shenyang, in the north-east of China, is getting to know Lincolnshire, that sprawl of a county that borders Nottinghamshire and Leicestershire to the west while somehow appearing to rub shoulders with the North Sea. When he arrived, in May, he spoke hardly any English, making him impervious to sledging, though early mastery of the words \"yes\" and \"no\" prevented the mayhem in running between the wickets which has been the downfall of so many.</p> <p>He bowls very little, though he has tried leg-spin, and is frequently and understandably asked whether he is a purveyor of \"the chinaman\", the delivery bowled by a slow left-arm wrist-spinner. \"He doesn't bowl it,\" says his friend Matt Smith, \"but while in China I saw a man who did, and it made me fall about with laughter.\"</p> <p>Smith, 41, who played for Cleethorpes for 10 years and now lives in Shenyang, where he is an English teacher at the local Aerospace University, is the man responsible for introducing Jiang to club cricket in England. \"Two years ago I saw him play a really good knock and I thought he was one of the very few players in the country who really was a cricketer. He just had that little bit of understanding of when to play and when to leave it, and how to build an innings.</p> <p>\"The remarkable thing is that he's been playing for only four years. He had a trial for Shenyang Sports University, to get credit for his PE degree, and within a month the national coach was asking him to play for China in an international tournament in Thailand.</p> <p>\"I set up a cricket team at my university, and because we played regular matches against Shu's university I watched his development. When I came back to Cleethorpes one day I said I was involved with cricket in China and they said: 'Yeah, right, when are you going to send some Chinese kids over here?' We had a joke about it. Now I've done it. Last year I was convinced that he was ready to come.\"</p> <p>Smith paid Jiang's travel costs \u2013 though he has been promised a refund by the Asian Cricket Council (ACC), of which China is a member. The player's parents have covered his costs since he arrived at the start of the season, though he eats at the club three or four times a week.</p> <p>\"He's on a special visa which entitles him to stay for six months,\" says Smith. \"He is allowed to take part in a sporting event and the league season for the Lincolnshire League is deemed a sporting event. We weren't sure we'd get the visa. He is good enough for Cleethorpes' first team.\"</p> <p>At the moment, though, Jiang cannot appear for the first team, who play in the Yorkshire League, because their overseas player must have played first-class cricket.</p> <p>The world's governing body, the ICC, to which China \u2013 coached by the former Pakistan Test player Rashid Khan \u2013 is affiliated through the ACC, has taken a great deal of interest in the game in that country, even though most of the clubs there are made up of British expats. Because of its population of almost 1.4bn and its huge marketing potential, China is at the forefront of the ICC's global development programme. It has sent a working party out there and the MCC sent a team under the captaincy of Mike Gatting.</p> <p>\"They are struggling to create the right environment,\" says Smith. \"We grow up with the game here. And there are so many other sports there. But progress is being made and one of Shu's team-mates will be going to Sydney this winter to play for Western Suburbs.\"</p> <p>Wind and rain drove the Cleethorpes and Doncaster youngsters from the field. But Jiang was still smiling, happy to be involved in cricket in this environment. \"When I started, I thought you bowl from just one end, because that's how it is in China, with a mat on top of concrete. There is only one proper cricket ground in China.\"</p> <p>He does not see himself becoming a professional cricketer. \"I'm too old. But after just four years I cannot do without cricket in my life. I hope I can coach, or umpire.\"</p> <p>Meanwhile, he is happier with the more gentle training schedule at Cleethorpes CC, where Darren Pattinson \u2013 memorably once an England cricketer \u2013 played. \"I like training for one or two hours here. In China we train for four hours, have some rice and then train for another four. And here you can say 'hello' to another player in training. If you do that in China you must run 10 laps of the pitch.\"</p> <p>Cricketers are at last emerging from China; the cricket culture will take a little longer to establish itself.</p>"
