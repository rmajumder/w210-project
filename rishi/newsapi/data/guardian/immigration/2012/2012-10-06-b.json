  "<p>It seems to be the fate of Conservative prime ministers to be stalked by flamboyantly ambitious blonds with connections to Henley, wild hair and untamed rhetoric. In the case of Margaret Thatcher, it was Michael Heseltine, her nemesis but not her successor. For David Cameron, the predator is Boris Johnson, who pulsates with the urge to be both.</p> <p>At this week's Conservative conference in Birmingham, the official target will be <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/oct/02/ed-miliband-one-nation-speech1\" title=\"\">Ed Miliband</a> and the audacious land grab that he launched in Manchester for the title of \"One Nation\" party. The real enemy, the person whose name most makes the prime minister's people twitch, will be Boris Johnson. As our poll today underscores, he leads overwhelmingly on what was once considered to be David Cameron's greatest gift: being able to attract voters who might not normally support the Conservative party.</p> <p>The prime minister's aides insist that relations between the two old Etonians are fine, though if they were really that tickety-boo they would not have needed to stage a \"reconciliation\" meeting before the conference. Mr Cameron's friends also say that he and they are entirely relaxed about Boris basking in the conference sun. Sure they are: as relaxed as they were about the mayor comprehensively upstaging the prime minister during the Olympics, as relaxed as a cat on a hot tin roof.</p> <p>Those of them who do admit that Boris is a problem say that at least: \"There are worse rivals you could have.\" There's some truth in that. The mayor is not a member of the cabinet. Being detached from the government, and all the unpopular and misconceived decisions that it has made, is part of the explanation for why he is much the most popular Tory politician. To be prime minister, however, it is usually thought essential to be a member of cabinet. He is not even a member of the Commons, though if he decided to seek a seat through a byelection, with the Heathrow issue as a ready-made cause/excuse, there is more than one Conservative MP ready to step down for him. But for Mr Cameron's allies to find consolation from the mayor being in no current position to strike is to miss an essential point. The threat is not of a leadership challenge any time soon. The mayor casts a shadow over the prime minister because he allows the Conservative party to imagine how things could be different with someone else in charge. The dream might well be a delusion, but it is nevertheless a seductive fantasy for a growing number of Tories. Boris is a walking, wisecracking reminder to them and to David Cameron of what the Tory leader has lost since he moved into Number 10.</p> <p>One is an ability to excite the Tory party. It is important to note that this has only a little bit to do with any policy differences between them. Boris has used Europe as a dividing line with the man he would replace. While the prime minister havers about whether to promise a referendum on Europe and feels obliged to advocate the salvation of the euro, the mayor, unburdened by any responsibility to think too deeply about the consequences, demands a plebiscite and wishes death to the euro, a position naturally more popular with Europhobic Tories. Other than Europe, you really have to look very hard to locate meaningful differences between two Tories of similar age whose formative political years were dominated by Margaret Thatcher. The budget cut in the top rate of tax, the biggest strategic error in terms of how the public views the Tories and one that Labour returned to over and again at their conference, had been demanded in advance by the mayor. Indeed, he had argued for going even further and abolishing the top rate altogether.</p> <p>Boris is as much, if not more so, a liberal on social issues as his rival in Number 10. He has spoken up for being generous about immigration and wore a <a href=\"http://www.google.co.uk/imgres?hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;biw=1173&amp;bih=685&amp;tbm=isch&amp;prmd=imvns&amp;tbnid=rxuYn5oWR_HrYM:&amp;imgrefurl=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/in_pictures/7491542.stm&amp;docid=C-p89gxNvmLEMM&amp;imgurl=http://newsimg.bbc.co.uk/media/images/44808000/jpg/_44808211_boris466getty.jpg&amp;w=466&amp;h=300&amp;ei=_DdwUL2cIKmi0QXX-YDQDg&amp;zoom=1&amp;iact=hc&amp;vpx=495&amp;vpy=158&amp;dur=130&amp;hovh=180&amp;hovw=280&amp;tx=124&amp;ty=136&amp;sig=114777381097095362232&amp;page=1&amp;tbnh=137&amp;tbnw=195&amp;start=0&amp;ndsp=18&amp;ved=1t:429,r:2,s:0,i:77\" title=\"\">pink stetson</a> at a gay pride march, which makes his popularity among some of the unreconstructed right of the Tory party rather bewildering. But, then, it is a mistake to think of the Boris phenomenon in rational terms. His appeal is not founded on policy, but on his ability to stimulate the erogenous zones of Tories. One of the easiest predictions that we can make about this conference is that Boris will attract larger crowds and receive from them a more fervent reception than any member of the cabinet. We will see the evidence of that at a rally for him on Monday night staged by <a href=\"http://conservativehome.blogs.com/\" title=\"\">ConservativeHome </a>and entitled \"Boris's 2012: Re-elected and Olympotastic\". Says one of his friends: \"That will be where you see Boris unleashed.\" Since he is never exactly leashed at any time that should be interesting.</p> <p>The following morning, he will address the conference itself, a glorious opportunity for Borisovian grandstanding and an event that the prime minister will feel painfully obliged to attend. The compliment will not be returned: the mayor will have left Birmingham before Mr Cameron addresses the party. Cabinet ministers have to clear their conference speeches through Number 10. The prime minister's people would very much like to see what Mr Johnson has in store for the conference. One Number 10 aide says: \"He's talked to us about where his speech is going.\" In other words, they don't really have a clue. If it is comedy Boris, he will make the rest of the cabinet look even more cardboard and grey. If it is serious Boris, the would-be prime minister in waiting, that will be really alarming for Number 10.</p> <p>The most important thing that Boris has which the prime minister lacks is popularity. No Tory needs reminding that David Cameron failed to achieve a clean victory at the supposedly unlosable election of 2010 and growing numbers of the nervous and fractious blue clan are expressing fears that their party will do no better, and could well do much worse, in 2015. By contrast, Boris is the only Tory to have won a major election since 1992, and he has done so twice in London, a naturally non-Tory city.</p> <p>Put simply, Dave looks like a loser, Boris looks like a winner. The Tory tribe is drawn to risk-takers, characters and winners, especially winners \u2013 and Boris is all three. He is the only politician in the land known by his first name; during the Olympics, he had a crowd of 60,000 chanting it. \"Boris! Boris! Boris!\" they cried. Can anyone recall any other Tory \u2013 or indeed any politician of any party \u2013 who can draw that response from a non-partisan audience?</p> <p>He has a talent for cheering up people, a very useful quality in the middle of a double-dip recession. Owning optimism is always a hugely valuable asset for politicians and even more so when times are tough. Nick Clegg tried for it in Brighton when he sought to persuade his party that things would come right for them in the end. Ed Miliband strove for it in Manchester with his projection of himself as the man who could bring Britain back together. David Cameron used to own optimism when he was leader of the opposition and will try to recapture it in his conference speech. Boris already has it.</p> <p>Allied with that is the feeling that he is \"authentic\" in a way other politicians are not. To adapt Oscar Wilde, authenticity is everything in politics \u2013 once you can fake that, you are made. It is also important to note that being regarded as authentic should not be confused with being truthful. Boris has had a very on-off relationship with the truth over the years. It is striking that those who know him best often trust him least and his career is littered with incident, political and personal, which would have felled most other politicians long ago. His ability to be unscathed by scandal is another thing that he has and which his rival at Number 10 used to possess, but has now lost: a Teflon quality that means nothing ever really sticks.</p> <p>All this may change. For Cameron loyalists, Boris is a firework that will soon splutter out as Olympic euphoria fades and people start to ask serious questions about his fitness for the highest office. They have a point. There is a vast difference between being mayor of London, a glorified transport and police commissioner, and having your finger hovering over the nuclear button. Borismania may prove to be a passing spasm, which evaporates just as Cleggmania did.</p> <p>He is currently hailed by rightwingers as being a truer Tory than David Cameron while also being more popular among non-Tories, a contradiction that will be hard to sustain forever. Between City Hall and Number 10, there are a huge number of high hurdles to leap. Being the front runner for a leadership succession has historically proved to be a long-term disadvantage. In a contest for the Tory crown, the darker sides of Boris would come under a lot more scrutiny than they do now, not least because his rivals will be sure to get them out there.</p> <p>Will Boris make an overt move to supplant David Cameron? That I doubt at the moment. He does not have to be actively plotting to undermine the prime minister. To hurt David Cameron, Boris just has to be Boris. And at that, as we know, he is terribly good.</p>",
  "<p>No other city has celebrated its spangly car crashes of bright-burning characters quite like New York. Dorothy Parker, pretending her tears were just gin spilt in the middle of a new joke; Andy Warhol, who wanted to get as far from himself as everyone else wanted to get closer; journalist Pete Hamill and his cohort hard-drinking their way towards death in a celebration of life. And, sitting in front of me, moving within minutes from a bravura \"I really resent sometimes living in this time period; there's no decadence any more\" to a tearful collapse over her tiny chicken salad \u2013 \"I'm always lonely. I've never been in love\" \u2013 is this town's latest burning star.</p> <p>It's not as though no one has ever taken drugs in this city before and written about it. It's not as if no writer has ever flounced out of their job. But it's unprecedented that such a double act should merit not only multiple magazine profiles but a very public letter of resignation to the city, via the <em>New York Post</em>. Cat Marnell is probably right that this isn't a decadent town any more \u2013 not since Rudy Giuliani took office as mayor in 1994. But that's not the only reason Marnell sparks such adoring and condemnatory interest: she is also the first high-profile burn-up of the Twitter years, these years where storming from the office with a warm quart of gin and a zinging aphorism is a quaint archaism of a gesture. Instead self-immolation takes place in electronic nanoseconds, online, where it's magnified by myriad reposts and retweets.</p> <p>And so, last July, Marnell sent an email to the <em>New York Post</em>. Why, she scoffed, spend \"another summer meeting deadlines behind a computer at night when I could be on the rooftop of Le Bain looking for shooting stars and smoking angel dust with my friends\"?</p> <p>The job she was leaving was as beauty editor at women's website xojane, where she had become celebrated for reviews that were as much about her enjoyment of drugs as they were about cosmetics. Finally her drug use had become so heavy that Jane Pratt, the website's founding editor, had to let her friend go. Marnell was hired almost immediately by <em>Vice</em>, the youth culture media conglomerate that delights in controversy. As its self-styled \"pills and narcissism\" correspondent, she began a column called Amphetamine Logic, and her writing became even harder to quit.</p> <p>Marnell recounts parties and drugs and sex in writing that mirrors the experience of being on drugs \u2013 sometimes fizzing (\"You know what speed is like? It shrieks you up through the sky\u2026 explodes over and over again with durrr ideas, fluorescent-rainbow nothings like fireworks that scatter sparks and ash\") and, just as often, cold and blunt and brutal (\"I start scrolling through my phone for someone to fuck. Then I stop caring about that, too, and decide to just go home\").</p> <p>This was how she introduced herself to her <em>Vice</em> audience: \"I'm the one\u2026 dressed like a sort of slutty Commedia dell'Arte Zanni, in white rags, a Dior slap bracelet, a Winston \u2013 I know, inexplicably \u2013 tucked behind my ear, a nameplate necklace that says 'methadone' in cursive (indeed, roll your eyes; please), filthy white Topshop flats, three plastic rosaries in pastel colours that are all chewed up.\"</p> <p>But the reason Marnell resonates, and could do so for years, is that she's more than a poor little rich girl with a hard drug habit; she is clever and, crucially, she refuses to conform to the sanctioned narratives of either desperate victim or contrite, recovering addict.</p> <p>\"The reality is so many people are using drugs,\" she says. \"I know hardly anybody who isn't. But people aren't used to people writing about drugs.\"</p> <p>Sanctimony certainly isn't a charge you can levy at <em>Vice</em>, where her popularity confirms that losing one job due to her addiction has in fact been an excellent career move. It also, however, means that her own disintegration, physical and psychological, has now become her \"brand\". Her job now, as a recent <em>New York Magazine</em> profile put it, is \"to be fucked up\". But is it our job to spectate?</p> <p>As I wait FOR HER in an East Village caf\u00e9 I&#xa0;start to feel foolish for thinking she'll turn up at all. Then there's a ripple and I&#xa0;look the way of the turned heads. They're appraising the small, tanned, very blonde figure who is crossing the road, half-striding, half-hobbling, in ferociously heeled pastel stilettos. Perhaps they're staring because she's hard not to stare at, or perhaps they're staring because Marnell's notoriety has now transcended the comment boards and made her famous in the offline world, too.</p> <p>She's wearing a torn white clingy vest of a dress and clutching a graffitied handbag that looks as though it's been kicked around countless nightclub corners. Breathless non-explanations tumble out \u2013 she ended up \"at some guy's apartment\", there was \"way too much coke\". Making haphazard gestures towards her face, she adds: \"I'm, like, caked in make-up with my false eyelashes falling off.\" She seems to be performing her own chaos. This, it seems, is the character she's made for herself, or maybe one the internet has helped make.</p> <p>Marnell is 30, but her snub-nosed, round-eyed bratty beauty (she is made even more doll-like by those in fact perfectly intact false eyelashes) and her very petite frame (a side effect of amphetamines) make her look a decade younger. She calls herself an adult child. \"It's very Peter Pan. A girl can be a lost boy, too.\" She boasts about her own helplessness. \"I don't know how to do anything. I don't know how to drive; I don't know how to pay taxes; I don't know how to keep a house; I don't own any dishes.\"</p> <p>Marnell is the middle daughter of psychologist parents with whom she has next to no contact. Her older sister is a publicist and she claims not to know what her younger brother does. It was a privileged upbringing: \"I was raised with everything \u2013 this huge house with a guest house and tennis courts and everything, but I was so unhappy.\"</p> <p>She tells of her ultra-Republican father tearing up a Riot Grrrl 'zine she made and forbidding her to use the word \"feminism\" in his house. As for her mother, she was \"like an ice cube: she literally wouldn't talk to us. She was just completely unable to connect with us. I was raised by nannies. I left home at 15 for prep school and never went back.\"</p> <p>This was when her father put her on Ritalin to improve her grades: \"I was top of my class for years because I did everything better than everybody else because I was on so much speed.\" She has been on amphetamines ever since. \"The <em>New York Times</em> is still publishing articles like: 'Oh, college kids are using Adderall' and I'm like: 'Yo \u2013 is this, like, 1997?' What people aren't talking about is how these Ritalin kids are turning into Adderall adults. You think I'm the only one taking Adderall?\"</p> <p>Before xojane, Marnell was a beauty editor at Cond\u00e9 Nast magazine <em>Lucky</em>, where her drug use quickly became a problem. \"I was disgusting. I was 90lb and green and coming in with nosebleeds and hiding in the beauty closet. I was hanging out with some really bad people doing heroin.\"</p> <p>She left <em>Lucky</em> for $1,000- a-day rehab clinic Silver Hill Hospital, a choice governed partly by the fact that her beloved Edie Sedgwick had gone there. She paid for it herself, she says, while her employers put her on disability pay. She loved it there: \"Eating meals at a table with people and being in a house with people was really fun for me. It felt like family.\"</p> <p>But a few months after leaving she fell apart: \"I did the thing when you take all the pills and then you call someone and you're locked in your apartment. I was taken out on a gurney and all of that. But that was, you know, the height of the drama for me. It's not really representative of who I am and the problems I have. My recreational drug use is not a problem. Nobody would be using drugs if there weren't tons of upsides. I love stimulants, I love being wired and I love, as New Yorkers say, just coming out of my face. I <em>love </em>it. I'm definitely not going to die \u2013 I'm very conscientious about what I mix and what I don't.\"</p> <p>That morning she'd tweeted: \"I hate my career I just want a boyfriend\". The sorry statement made sorrier still by all the blithe retweets and \"favourites\" it generated from her thousands of followers.</p> <p>\"I hate men,\" she tells me, then corrects herself. \"It's not that I hate men: I hate myself around men. If I'm rejected, the shame is too much \u2013 it's devastating. A lot of addicts can't handle that. Because we already hate ourselves, to have that validated by some man not wanting you is... too much.\"</p> <p>The thing that seems to be keeping her going is her book, a memoir, although she admits that her agent is \"mad at her\" for still not having written the proposal. The agent is Byrd Leavell, who pioneered the blog- to-book trend with Tucker Max, a frat boy named one of the \"douchebags of the decade\" by Gawker for his chronicling of his own immoderate drinking and sleeping around.</p> <p>When I speak to Leavell I mention the boyfriend tweet and ask whether he worries about exploitation. He doesn't seem to understand my question. Does it bother him, I persist, that she's now effectively dependent on this identity and reality as an addict? And that the internet both exposes and encourages that vulnerability? Isn't this a problem?</p> <p>\"You're right in many ways,\" he says. \"It always strikes me what thick skin you have to have. Because commenters are\u2026 merciless. When you choose to write about yourself online, there's kind of no half-measures. But if she did a whole book as good as her best pieces\u2026 I mean, <em>imagine</em>. Imagine the validation \u2013 and the copies that would sell.\"</p> <p>I think it's naive to hope that he \u2013 and everyone else \u2013 might prioritise the former.</p> <p>\"I'm the first to say my life is glamorous,\" Marnell declares. \"The people I hang out with are fabulous. And that's really what I'm about. Drug addicts \u2013 and drug use \u2013 are boring; it's what lives they're living that creates a story.\"</p> <p>But notes of fabulousness do not, ultimately, make that story any less bleak, or the exploitation \u2013 hers and ours \u2013 any less problematic. I like the story of the nonchalant writer-heroine doing whatever she wants, shamelessly, messily, so much more than the story of the desperately sad addict. Unfortunately, both are true.</p> <p>\"At the core of addiction,\" Marnell continues, \"is a depression that feels unbearable. In July I spent 11 days in my apartment and I did not go outside. It's hard to write this stuff, but it's also boring. Who wants to read about what it's like to be in bed for days?\"</p> <p>But the thing is, lots of people do: the abject dejection of her comedowns, self-loathing and lovelessness are just as compelling as the descriptions of downtown glamour.</p> <p>Her most recent <em>Vice</em> column ran three weeks ago and looked as though it could be one of the last. \"I am better,\" she announced, \"and I will continue to get better, and it doesn't matter to me that you don't want to believe this, or don't understand what it means.\"</p> <p>But she also wrote: \"I'll be 30 years old in four days, and here's the big revelation: it's OK to be a freak show. It makes you special and strange and valuable to the universe.\"</p>",
  "<p><strong>Did you know much about the beat generation, Jack Kerouac and his novel <em>On the Road</em> before you made this film?</strong></p> <p>Yes. I was 17 when I read the book. I was such a literature freak, I was doing world literature, creative writing and photojournalism at the time. I fantasised about F Scott Fitzgerald's <em>The Great Gatsby</em> \u2013 I loved it, and then I read everything JD Salinger had to offer. Then I was turned on to Kerouac, and his spontaneous prose, his stream of consciousness way of writing. I admired him so much, and I romanticised so much about the 40s and 50s.</p> <p><strong>So you weren't always going to be an actor?</strong></p> <p>No. My first manager said: \"If you don't get a film by 18, it's too late.\" I was so much into writing that I said: \"All right, if I don't get a film by 18, I'll try to be a novelist by 19.\" But I did get a film at 18, and then I was off to London, Malta and Mexico with Brad Pitt on <em>Troy</em>. I'd spend most of my days with people like Peter O'Toole, Brian Cox and Sean Bean, and I would be writing the whole time. Not about the people \u2013 I felt that was unfair. I felt that the only way to write was out of the imagination, because it was cheating to write out of experience. [Laughs] Later, I found out that it's&#xa0;much easier to write out of experience, because things are so much more interesting when you're in motion. And that's what I found with <em>On the Road</em>.</p> <p><strong>Of all Kerouac's books, were you inspired by <em>On the Road</em> in particular?</strong></p> <p>For me, yes. Y'know, other people are, like, \"Man \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9780141198255\" title=\"\" rel=\"nofollow\"><em>Big Sur</em></a>! I love that.\" But I was just inspired by the adventure, and when you're a kid living under your mother's roof in Minnesota, and you have curfew and you have school in the morning, all you want is to be as free as these guys and how they lived. You just couldn't wait until you graduated, to get out!</p> <p><strong>You're playing a character who's based on a real person. How much research did you do, and how close did you get to Neal Cassady, the real Dean&#xa0;Moriarty?</strong></p> <p>I was cast in 2007, so that gave me plenty of time. I said to Walter [Salles] that I wouldn't do another&#xa0;movie until we made this one. And I didn't for two years, until basically I almost had to go back to my mom and ask her for rent money. Because the film couldn't get made. Oddly enough, no American production company would produce it! Anyway, I tried to read as much of Kerouac as I could from that time, but it was more important to read Neal's stuff. He wrote a book called <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/fiction/9780872860056/the-first-third\" title=\"\"><em>The First Third</em></a>, which was mostly about his childhood and growing up, so I got to know him that way. Then I went on to the letters he had written at the end of his life; they were so honest and vibrant, they gave you such a sense of his&#xa0;personality.</p> <p><strong>Did you meet the people who knew him?</strong></p> <p>I got to hang with John Cassady, Neal's son, and sit down with him. I had a notepad of questions about his father; we just sat there, having wine, me, him and Walter, for five or six hours. Sitting in front of the spitting image of Neal \u2013 the seed, the result. Then we went up to Berkeley to sit down with a beat writer named <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_McClure\" title=\"\" rel=\"nofollow\">Michael McClure</a>, and had cheese and wine. And then Gerry Nicosia, who wrote <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/books/97/09/07/home/kerouac-nicosia.html\" title=\"\" rel=\"nofollow\"><em>Memory Babe</em></a>, a huge biography of Jack Kerouac, came to our \"bootcamp\" and played us tapes of LuAnne Henderson, who's Marylou in the novel, talking about her love for&#xa0;Neal and also Jack. We got such a sense of him&#xa0;from a perspective other than the way Kerouac portrayed him, as an iconic, energetic, flying cowboy.</p> <p><strong>The film does seem to take more of an angle on Neal's irresponsibility than the book.</strong></p> <p>In the book it can just seem to be thoughtless, some of the things he does, and without regret. That's why reading his material was the most important thing for me, and meeting his family. Because that material expressed who he was in his own mind, and his family got to express who he was as a father. John Cassady loved his father. He couldn't wait for him to come home from work. Neal would put John and his two sisters, Jami and Cathy, on his arm and raise them up on his bicep and try to lift them as high as he could. He was a wonderful father to them, and that's what they wanted to share with me. They said: \"Don't represent him as an ass all the time, because he wasn't.\" That was just a way for Kerouac to structure the book. So we wanted to show that he did have a heart, and I hope there are beautiful moments in the film where people can see that.</p> <p><strong>The film is also very open about the characters' sex lives and drug use. Was that important?</strong></p> <p>Yeah. It's a nonjudgmental view on being open to experience, and there's an appreciation of the knowledge and wisdom that comes with that. You're much stronger for it, in their eyes. Which I believe as well. I mean, you know the old line, \"Everything in moderation\"? Then there's another line that goes, \"Don't mortgage your health for pleasure.\" In my mind, I'm like, \"Fuck that.\" [Laughs] I'm no druggie or anything like that but I'm open to adventure, is what I'm saying. I know that if I let loose, I've got a lot of things&#xa0;to&#xa0;lose.</p> <p><strong>Why's that?</strong></p> <p>Because I'm so passionate about acting and finding the next role after this that I can be dedicated to. But within those two lines, there's so&#xa0;much conservatism. And those lines represent&#xa0;the conservativeness of that time. Especially in terms of censorship. See, the <em>On the Road</em> that came out in 1957 was censored. A lot of the honesty of it, the bitter honesty, is in the original scroll version that came out in 2007 on the 50-year anniversary. Back then, there was so much post-second world war fear that was imposed on everybody \u2013 \"You must live life this way\" \u2013 and these guys were <em>bored</em>. There's a great&#xa0;quote from Einstein. He said: \"Great spirits&#xa0;have always encountered violent opposition from mediocre minds\" \u2013 because they&#xa0;won't thoughtlessly conform to the latter. These guys lived to the beat of their own drum, always trying to discover&#xa0;new things. But, as writers, also&#xa0;trying to&#xa0;capture them, so they didn't go to&#xa0;waste.</p> <p><strong>Have you done your own <em>On the Road</em> trip?</strong></p> <p>I've done it on my own, multiple times. Just getting full of angst at two o'clock on a Tuesday, jumping in the car, showing up in Salt Lake City 12 hours later, or driving 19 hours straight to Bismarck, North Dakota. [For the film] Walter and I did a 4,500-mile trip in a 1949 Hudson from New York to Los Angeles, and we were able to film a lot of the countryside that we weren't able to film within the production dates. There were five of us \u2013 the cinematographer, focus-puller, the sound guy, me, Walter and somebody driving a minivan with all of our luggage. We had no deadline, we broke down nine times across the states, and we tried to follow as good as we could the journey these guys had taken. But we couldn't. We had to follow the backroads.</p> <p><strong>Why?</strong></p> <p>The freeways were all billboards and telephone lines. That's how boring today's roads are. But when you follow the backroads you remember what beauty's like. Having grown up on a farm, I&#xa0;was able to look at these places and say, \"Wow!\" I used to be <em>sick</em> of the backroads of Minnesota. I&#xa0;had to drive 30 miles to get home every day, take the schoolbus for two hours. But to drive through America and see the backroads, from Nashville to Memphis, Lovick to New Mexico, was incredible. It was probably the greatest trip of my life.</p>",
  "<p>Walter Salles first picked up a copy of <em>On the Road</em> as a student in Brazil in the 1970s. The country was under a military dictatorship at the time, torture and censorship were rife, and the dog-eared book was passed furtively from hand to hand, a window to a kind of freedom he and his fellow students could only dream about. It affected him profoundly: \"The way they lived was the way in which we wanted to live, so the book had a very resonant quality for my generation. The idea of movement as an instrument to better understand who you are and who you could eventually be wasn't allowed to us because the roads were blocked. Literally. We were denied a future and here were characters fighting to redefine their own future.\"</p> <p>So when Francis Ford Coppola asked him to direct the movie of <em>On the Road</em> in 2004 \u2013 after seeing Salles's <a href=\"http://film.theguardian.com/News_Story/Critic_Review/Guardian_Film_of_the_week/0,,1291408,00.html\" title=\"\"><em>The</em> <em>Motorcycle Diaries</em></a> at the Sundance film festival \u2013 it was a responsibility he took seriously. Not only was the book a cult classic of American literature, but the preceding 50 years were littered with the wrecks of failed attempts to turn it into a film. Jack Kerouac first mooted the idea of an adaptation in 1957 when he wrote to Marlon Brando suggesting that he could play Dean Moriarty (Kerouac would play Sal Paradise). Brando never replied. In 1979, Coppola bought the film rights and there followed several doomed attempts involving heavyweight directors such as Gus Van Sant and Jean-Luc Godard and an ever\u2011changing lineup of leading men, from Brad Pitt to Sean Penn.</p> <p>A documentary-maker by background, Salles agreed to take on the film on the condition that he could first make a non-fiction account of his \"search for <em>On the Road</em>\". There followed an intense five-year research period, with Salles crisscrossing America in search of every last surviving beat writer, artist and expert, meeting the surviving characters who inspired the fictional alter egos and faithfully retracing the route taken by Kerouac and his band of adventurers \"in search of <em>it</em>\".</p> <p>It was on one of these research trips, to Kerouac's childhood home in Lowell, Massachusetts, that Salles was shown \"the scroll\" \u2013 the 120ft-long roll of paper on which the author had famously typed the original stream-of-consciousness manuscript in 1951. This proved to be a turning point for Salles and provided the answer to the question: how do you film the&#xa0;unfilmable?</p> <p>A far more visceral piece of writing than the heavily edited version that was eventually published by Penguin in 1957, the scroll opens with the death of Sal's father and, for Salles, this represented the key to the film's thematic core: \"The search for the father leitmotif was so much more present in this version than in the 1957 edition, that we immediately altered the beginning of the screenplay and Jose Rivera, our writer, started to use the scroll as the text he was adapting,\" Salles explains.</p> <p>Realising that it would be futile to make the book adhere to the traditional Hollywood three-act format, Salles and Rivera decided to remain true to the book's collection of disjointed journeys rather than trying to condense it neatly into one epic trip. Instead, they took their narrative arc from the developing friendship between Dean and Sal, and their transition from youth into&#xa0;adulthood.</p> <p>During his travels, it became apparent to Salles that the diversity of landscapes the characters travel through in the book no longer existed in 21st-century America: \"You can drive 2,000 miles and you will encounter the same Walmarts, fast-food chains and homogenised architecture that you saw two days before.\" The search for authenticity took them 60,000 miles in total, from Argentina to Canada, chasing the snows of Patagonia and the blistering heat of Mexico.</p> <p>True to the spirit of the book, where living vicariously is not an option, Salles wanted his cast to feel the changing seasons, \"to experience the rain on the windshield, the dust, to feel the humidity of Louisiana, or when you are in the midst of the Arizona desert, to feel the solitude\". This commitment to experiencing everything first-hand led the director and Garrett Hedlund, who plays Dean Moriarty, to take their own road trip once the main shoot had finished, to capture some of the book's spontaneity and a sense of the changing landscapes.</p> <p>\"We took the old Hudson and did the journey from the east coast to the west. Garrett was driving and whenever we saw a back road that looked interesting we took it,\" says Salles. \"It was conceived with the same kind of freedom that you find in the book and we didn't know where we were going to sleep. We got to meet really extraordinary characters on the way\u2026 we were listening to jazz all the time\u2026 it was a unique journey.\" Much of the footage captured on this trip made it into the final cut of the film.</p> <p>A similarly rigorous approach was taken when it came to preparing the cast for their roles. Salles gathered them together in Montreal for a \"beatnik bootcamp\" \u2013 a month-long immersion and bonding session with visits and talks from beat survivors and experts. They were preaching to the converted. For most of the actors and crew this was a passion project, inspired by a love of the book. Kristen Stewart, for example, first read <em>On the Road</em> aged 14 and was intrigued by the Marylou character, the child-bride who rejects the traditional roles on offer for women of that era and goes on the road with Dean and Sal, blazing a trail for sexual liberation. She was one of the first actors to be cast, back in 2007 before the <em>Twilight</em> phenomenon, and her sudden rise to fame was instrumental in helping the project to finally secure its elusive financing.</p> <p>Hedlund was similarly committed to the cause, turning down other parts during the long and tortuous development period so that he could be available for the part of Dean Moriarty when the film finally got the green light. Producer Rebecca Yeldham, who had previously worked with Salles on <em>The</em> <em>Motorcycle Diaries</em>, explains that they were well aware that Kerouac fans would be coming&#xa0;to the film with their own expectations about how the characters of Dean and Sal should look and act, and did not want to add another layer of expectation to that by casting an established actor.</p> <p>\"We wanted the audience to discover Sal and Dean through a fresh lens,\" she says. \"So even though we had many name actors jostling for those two parts, Walter really loved the idea of discovering two actors for those roles. In the UK, Sam Riley [who plays Sal] is better known than he is in other parts of the world, but he's still fresh, he doesn't bring expectations. Garrett had been in a range of movies but was still relatively unknown. Walter met Garrett in 2007 and the minute Garrett walked into the room and began to read\u2026 Walter didn't want to make the movie with anyone else.\"</p> <p>Kerouac's book is famously influenced by the free-flow style and energy of the jazz scene that was burgeoning in the clubs of Harlem in the late 1940s. Salles tried to inject a little of that spirit into the shoot by encouraging his cast to improvise where possible: \"The actors were so immersed in that world that at some point they started to be able to improvise in the logic of their characters. It's a little bit like jazz. Once you know the structure of the piece you are allowed to bifurcate from it because you know you will find your way back,\" he says. Some of the movie's more memorable scenes \u2013 notably where a hitchhiker (played by musician Jake La Botz) starts to sing an a cappella song in the back of the car, and during an unsettling stopover at the Louisiana home of junkie William Burroughs (a memorable cameo by Viggo Mortensen) \u2013 were the result of such&#xa0;improvisation.</p> <p>Salles admits that there were times during the film's protracted genesis when he doubted that it would ever get made. But for him, the journey was worthwhile. This is his fourth road-trip movie and comparisons will inevitably be drawn with <em>The Motorcycle Diaries</em>, a similar tale of friendship between two men on a journey of discovery.</p> <p>\"The narrative is very similar to <em>Motorcycle Diaries</em> in the sense that it is constructed layer by layer and [gradually] you reach a point where you realise that the characters are not the same ones you've been following since the beginning of the journey. The journey is very complex because it entails moments of exhilaration but also moments of extraordinary pain. Loss is included in the idea of movement.\"</p> <p>A complex and rewarding genre the road-trip movie may be, but Salles admits he wouldn't mind tackling something less epic and more contained for his next project: \"My next film is going to be set in a phone booth.\"</p>",
  "<p>To most ordinary people, it feels as though the British political class inhabit a grand yacht drifting farther and farther from mainland view. They're not like real people. They don't understand who average Britons are or how they live.</p> <p>A depressing number of the electorate feel that nothing ever really changes. The rich get richer, cheats cheat the system and politicians make promises they can't keep. C'est la vie!</p> <p>The fallout from the expenses scandal and other similar disappointments, such as the Liberal Democrat tuition fees U-turn, have created this mood of cynicism and disillusionment. Add economic uncertainty, the perceived threats of globalisation, immigration and suchlike, and, hey presto, you have a volatile electorate minded to punish the established political guard.</p> <p>The only approach for the modern politician is to be straight with people, because they will be able to tell if you are not being so. This may sound naive, the idealism of someone who has never even been a minister. But I believe the age of spin, of the manufactured, \"professional\" politician, with his cliched photographic opportunities and soundbites, has passed. We have entered a political era in which authenticity matters, based upon honesty, integrity and being true to ourselves.</p> <p>A politician's authenticity is not just about who they claim to be, but also how that contextualises what they put forward to the people. Political packaging like David Cameron's \"big society\" orEd Miliband's \"One Nation\", mean nothing to voters who only want the tangible product inside the box.</p> <p>Clever phraseology, changing conference backdrop colours and the patronising tendency to position a representative of each gender and ethnic group behind the leader are techniques laughed at by the majority.</p> <p>After 2010 the rules of the game changed. When the game changes a new set of players is needed, on and off the pitch. All parties should be more frank. We may not agree on policy, but let's be brave enough to discuss the facts with candour.</p> <p>Appearing authentic to a majority with whom you have little in common is tough, though. Dave and Ed cannot realistically be described as mainstream, however hard they try to be so. Much of modern Britain is far removed from the hills of Notting and Primrose. But, by definition, authenticity requires them only to be themselves. The public doesn't care where their leaders live or where they go on holiday. Nor do they care about what their wives wear at conference or which school they attended. They're more interested in knowing about their values and intentions.</p> <p>So why do politicians fret about being honest? Unless politicians are honest about who they are, how can they expect votes? It is not as if the electorate seeks perfection in its leaders. The popularity of Boris Johnson is more about his self-deprecating style and self-evident intellect. His well-documented personal flaws are secondary. Indeed, they contribute positively to the belief that with Johnson you get the real man, warts and all.</p> <p>Strong leadership delivering real, measurable change is the antidote to the public's crisis of confidence. There are no quick fixes. The instant gratification of choosing a colourful character to lighten dark days would soon wear thin. Politicians should remember that they are elected to lead, not follow. A leader of historic note should now be appealing to the undecided many, not the dependent or privileged few.</p> <p>They need to persuade people used to generous state benefits that those times have passed. He or she needs to convince the able young that it's worth staying here and nervous foreign investors that Britain is a good place to do business.</p> <p>Such policies can be introduced only by a prime minister and government that has secured a genuine mandate for change. The ever-growing army of floating voters will opt for such a vision only if it is led by a person they believe in, someone who is authentic.</p> <p>Telling the truth has become good politics, while challenging the lazy cynicism about the value of government has become imperative. Securing the trust of the electorate will be absolutely necessary. Such trust can only be earned by authentic politicians.</p> <p><em>Dr Phillip Lee is Conservative MP for Bracknell</em></p>",
  "<p>In architecture, says Alexander Brodsky, \"you want on the one hand to build something that lasts for ever. But then you can have the problem of building something that disturbs you for the rest of your life. It's not good enough, but it stays.\"</p> <p>It's refreshing to hear an architect admit that he might make mistakes and also question the value of permanence, but then Brodsky is not a normal architect. He didn't design his first building until 2000, more than two decades after he left architecture school. He is now 57, and his practice is still small, mostly designing interiors and private houses around Moscow.</p> <p>When I meet him he is visiting London to install his first British exhibition, called White Room/Black Room, at the <a href=\"http://www.calvert22.org/e/exhibition-programme/\" title=\"\">Calvert 22 gallery</a> in Shoreditch. He's sleeping in the gallery, and he says he has to limit his travelling because his staff \"are always angry when I leave\". He confesses to a degree of computer illiteracy and doesn't have a website, but despite lacking the trappings of a major modern practice he nonetheless gets called Russia's greatest living architect.</p> <p>The main basis of his fame isn't built work but imaginary projects and sculptures and installations that might be called architectural art. An artist was what he wanted to be as a child, and when he graduated as an architect during the Brezhnev era he wasn't interested in working for \"one of the big state institutions\" which were the only likely sources of employment. So he started dreaming up \"paper architecture\", imaginary projects, in collaboration with the artist Ilya Utkin.</p> <p>\"I was very lucky\", he says. \"Somehow I could do what I wanted to do and even survive doing these things.\" It was \"quite illegal to sell art during Soviet times, but in the 80s we won some international conceptual competitions\". The prize money from these helped him to eat. Even after the fall of communism he continued to make art rather than buildings.</p> <p>Brodsky's work includes <em>Coma</em>, a model of a city partly submerged in crude oil, and other musings on endangered grandeur. Piranesi's imaginary drawings and views of ruins are influences, and he likes to use hollowed-out classical forms such as rotundas and porticos.</p> <p>He likes to create powerful spatial experiences, and in the Calvert 22 show he has created a very bright room next to a very dark, shrine-like space whose combined effect is in the contrast. There is also a large model of an imagined factory with a base carpeted with debris. \"I love old factories,\" says Brodsky, by way of explanation, and he once lived in one in New York. This one could be American or Russian, and it has the crumbling, abandoned look you might find in either country, but it's not a portrait of any one building. It is rather a fiction or an archetype, something that stands for all the mid-century industrial semi-wrecks you might have seen.</p> <p>The model's material is unfired clay, \"which is a favourite of mine. It is very fragile, and fragility is an important quality for me. It may become dust at&#xa0;any moment, but if you don't touch&#xa0;it it stays for ever.\" Here Brodsky's suspicion of permanence resurfaces; it also expresses itself in a bar made of ice on a lake. If he dislikes bad buildings that outstay their welcome, he is attracted to the idea that something \"is good enough, but you can let it go\".</p> <p>It's possible, though he doesn't especially encourage this line of speculation, that his interest in the fragile and short-lived has something to do with his home city of Moscow, where successive regimes have thrown up monuments that outlive their creators. They then become symbols of the city \u2013 Stalin's skyscrapers, for example, mean something to \"young people who hardly know who Stalin was\". These monuments are subject to erasure \u2013 the communists removed churches and monasteries, and now historic works that are inconvenient to&#xa0;developers are disappearing. Whatever seems solid and eternal is apt to disappear.</p> <p>In general, Brodsky resists attempts to see his work as critical commentaries on the extreme political climates through which he has lived. In Soviet times, \"everything was somehow connected to politics, but I tried to avoid these things. Of course I didn't like what was going on, but in my art I never touched it. I just followed my fantasies.\" Later he adds: \"the most important thing for me is independence.\"</p> <p>According to Clementine Cecil, now director of Save Britain's Heritage, but also an enthusiast for Russian architecture, Brodsky is a \"romantic\". He is \"heartfelt, direct, not pretentious\" and someone who \"brings out the best in people\". The writer and architect Beatrice Galilee has said that Brodsky has \"no notion of building according to conventions\", and his unusual career path gives him a freedom from stylistic allegiance that conventional architects find difficult. There is a whiff of postmodernism about his work, but really it belongs to no movement. He is able to pick up and play with any material \u2013 plastic bags, ice, oil \u2013 that comes to hand. One of his most charming works, to judge by the images of it, was a small vodka bar made of wooden frames taken from abandoned warehouses.</p> <p>Described in words, Brodsky's works can sound naive, but their physical realisation makes them interesting. He likes working with his hands. \"I was always drawing,\" he says. \"Drawing is the really important part of architecture, but a lot of architects never take the pencil and draw. It's a very personal thing \u2013 it is the entrance for me to some kind of world of the imagination.\" He used to love the process of making etchings \u2013 \"a miracle thing that gives space and depth on a flat piece of paper; after you press the copper plate you get really deep space and a lot of strange mysteries, things you cannot predict\".</p> <p>The physical, the tactile, the bodily, the material, also memory and dream: these are things you don't see much of in the globalised, computerised, abstracted architecture now marching through most major cities of the world. Moscow especially. Brodsky is a reminder of alternative values.</p>",
  "<p>\"I am going to take you to my friend's studio. It's quite unusual. I think you'll like it,\" says Ewa, my unofficial guide to Krak\u00f3w, in one of the biggest understatements of the trip. Leaving the city far below, she leads me up a hillside to an old military bunker tucked away in the leafy suburbs. It&#xa0;looks abandoned at first glance, but then we are greeted by a man who, with his grey beard and sheepskin waistcoat, has the look of an ageing rocker. Hans, a sculptor, has turned this forgotten lookout point into his year-round home. There is no electricity; the inside is lit only by candles. Outside there's an 8ft-high carved totem pole and the remains of a bonfire from his last all-night party.</p> <p>What follows is one of those surreal travel experiences, where one new friend introduces you to another and another. Before long we've set off through Krak\u00f3w's artistic underground. As a CouchSurfer, I am used to finding golden opportunities through strangers, but the unusual thing about this connection is that it came about after I&#xa0;tried to resurrect a 20-year-old tourism project that was, in many ways, the precursor to&#xa0;modern social networking.</p> <p>Back in the late 1980s, US-born Jim&#xa0;Haynes, a former bookshop owner and renowned supporter of counter-culture arts, had an idea. Convinced that the best travel experiences come from the people you meet, he set himself a goal: he would match inquisitive travellers with gracious hosts by creating an alternative guidebook. Commercial gain was not a priority, so he started in a&#xa0;country with no travel industry that was still fighting communist rule. <em>Poland: People to People</em> finally hit bookshelves in 1991, the year of the first completely free elections in the country since the 1920s.</p> <p>Peer-to-peer websites are 10 a penny nowadays, but turning the idea into a book back then was quite a challenge. Jim sent out a typewritten letter through his already extensive network of friends and got it printed it in various Polish publications. The resulting volume looked like a personal address book, with each contact filed under the town they lived in, starting in August\u00f3w and ending in Znakowo. The cover price of \u00a36 bought you the contact details of 1,000 strangers.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397286408\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/pictures/2012/10/3/1349278909389/Poland-People-to-People-001.jpg\" alt=\"Poland: People to People\" width=\"460\" height=\"277\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Photograph: Dave Depares/Brave Spark Media</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Jim gave me an out-of-print edition at one of the open-house dinners he runs every Sunday at his Paris home. It was like opening a little time capsule. Intrigued by the idea of&#xa0;taking modern networking back to its roots, I wondered whether, 20&#xa0;years later, Jim's hosts would still be willing to greet an unknown visitor from overseas?</p> <p>But first I would have to track them down. Details were sparse. There were no photos, just contact details, date of birth and a very short profile. \"I live in Krak\u00f3w and I am a man of Krak\u00f3w,\" read one rather unhelpful entry. I had to remind myself that this generation was not used to writing pithy bios, as we do nowadays, from Twitter to dating sites.</p> <p>At first I planned to communicate only by post and sent several letters before realising I lacked the patience. Feeling a little guilty, I&#xa0;opted for the 21st-century solution: Googling names at random. Many were dead ends; some seemed to be the Polish equivalent of John Smith; others simply never responded. But gradually people came out of the woodwork and I received various slightly stunned replies. Before long I had meetings arranged in Krak\u00f3w and Gdansk.</p> <p>It is my first time in Poland, and Krak\u00f3w is undeniably impressive. The picture-perfect main square \u2013 Rynek G\u0142\u00f3wny, one of the biggest in Europe \u2013&#xa0;is lined with Renaissance buildings, lively street caf\u00e9s and golf carts waiting to take tourists around town. I skip the organised tours, though, and head off to meet Wladek,&#xa0;a 50-year-old academic whom I have tracked down via his university. We meet in a 19th-century bohemian caf\u00e9, Jama Michalika (Florianska 45, <a href=\"http://jamamichalika.pl/\" title=\"\">jamamichalika.pl</a>), which is all stained-glass windows and theatrical velvet drapes.</p> <p>\"During the communist times, it was notorious for having the worst possible service,\" he tells me, laughing as an ultra-polite waitress sets down our ice cream sundaes.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397286409\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/pictures/2012/10/3/1349278701313/Wladek-and-son-Wojtek-15--001.jpg\" alt=\"Wladek and son Wojtek, 15, who took Vicky to a communist-era cafeteria\" width=\"460\" height=\"277\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Wladek and son Wojtek, 15, who took Vicky to a communist-era cafeteria.

He shows me old photos and speaks of how life has changed. His 15-year-old son Wojtek, who joins us after school, seems slightly bemused by the whole idea but is happy to accompany us to an old milk bar, U Stasi (Miko\u0142ajska 16), one of the few no-frills cafeterias that has survived the years of change. Naturally we order pierogi \u2013 the famous Polish dumplings \u2013 and are served a plateful that should keep any tourist going for days.</p> <p>The next morning I have my impromptu bunker adventure with Ewa, an artist I found after contacting various local galleries. She invites me for dinner at her home with her family and we spend the evening looking through her canvases. She even finds the original typewritten letter Jim sent in 1989 to introduce the project.</p> <p>I'm charmed by Krak\u00f3w and reluctant to leave, but I already have my next meeting arranged a 10-hour train ride away. Gdansk, with its immaculately renovated buildings and tourist-filled streets lined with little boutiques, is clearly a world away from the city it was in the 1980s. I have arranged to meet Krystyna in Brovarnia (Szafarnia 9, <a href=\"http://www.brovarnia.pl\" title=\"\">brovarnia.pl</a>), a stylish waterfront restaurant in a&#xa0;converted granary.</p> <p>\"History is coming back to me,\" she says as she flicks through the book. In the 1980s she was a freelance interpreter, working with major media to cover the shipyard strikes that led to the fall of the iron curtain.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397286410\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/pictures/2012/10/3/1349278870574/Krystyna-who-tried-to-tel-001.jpg\" alt=\"Krystyna, who tried to tell the real story of the 1980s shipyard strikes\" width=\"460\" height=\"277\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Krystyna, who tried to tell the real story of the 1980s shipyard strikes.

Mariusz made himself easier to trace after dropping a key clue on his original profile: \"I just made my own sailboard.\"</p> <p>Was he, I wondered, the silver-haired man I find in various online windsurfing action shots?

But I'm wrong: one last email lands in my inbox.</p> <p>\"It's me, Agnieszka,\" it begins. \"The girl who lives in my old apartment in Gdansk sent your letter on to me in Sweden.\"</p> <p>I get a little buzz of excitement from knowing that one of the few letters I posted made it to its intended recipient.

  "<p>There's a great moment when the dust-caked heroes of <em>On the Road</em> reach Ozona, Texas, on the way to El Paso. Dean Moriarty decides they should loosen up a bit. \"Disemburden yourselves of all that clothes!\" he advises. \"What's the <em>sense</em> of clothes?\"</p> <p>His obliging wife, Marylou, gets her kit off, and his friend Sal Paradise does the same. They're in one of those broad-beamed old cars with a bench for a front seat, heading west into the setting sun. \"Every now and then a big truck zoomed by; the driver in the high cab caught a glimpse of a golden beauty sitting naked with two naked men. You could see them swerve a moment&#xa0;as they vanished in our rear\u2011view&#xa0;window.\"</p> <p>We never quite managed this scene but we came close to a few others. Thirty years after Jack Kerouac's fabled odyssey, my girlfriend Annie and I had just left college and were hitchhiking across America. <em>On the Road</em> was still wildly romantic in the late 70s: if you wanted reckless adventure you bought a copy and simply followed the instructions. We knew it wasn't fiction but a series of real journeys the author had taken between 1947 and 1950, the names changed to protect the guilty, and that made it all the more thrilling. Beneath bruised purple dusks and swirling grey dawns, he had hitched, hopped trains and buses, and torn across what he called the Promised Land in a succession of beat-up cars, \"balling the jack\" in sleep-deprived pursuit of some kind of self-discovery. Around him was a rogues' gallery of extraordinary characters \u2013 snake-hipped jazzers, smoke-stained prophets, blue-eyed beautiful girls, artists, poets, pool sharks, Buddhists, hookers eating doughnuts, gamblers, rustlers, car thieves, thin-stemmed waifs in a Benzedrine haze and hobos flooring bottles of \"rotgut\" and 35-cent quarts of Californian port.</p> <p>To be fair, most of this sounded a bit frightening. Kerouac (in the guise of Sal Paradise) saw himself as the nerve-centre of a control experiment mapping the outer limits of human experience, at one point enthusiastically entering a hustlers' bar on Eighth Avenue full of \"wild negro queers, sullen guys with guns, shiv-packing seamen, thin noncommittal junkies and an occasional well-dressed middle-aged detective posing as a bookie\". We wanted a walk on the wild side, too, but with some art galleries thrown in, and maybe a trip to Disneyland. We'd be sending the odd postcard home.</p> <p>At various magical moments our route crossed the hallowed tracks traversed in <em>On the Road</em>. We hitched through Des Moines, whose tedious sprawl wasn't quite the funky suburb of gonzo legend. We saw the fizzing blues bars of Chicago's Madison Street. We swung by the \"little fishing village of Sausalito\" \u2013 which by 1977 was a bohemian art commune full of barge-dwelling hippies. We caught a ride to New Orleans and saw the creaky old jazz bands in Preservation Hall. We even lived for a while on Kerouac's legendary diet of apple pie and ice-cream and, just as he'd observed, the portions got bigger and the ice-cream richer the farther south you travelled.</p> <p>Part of the rhythm of this deathless memoir was its manic urge to expose every nerve-ending to the elements, a mission rendered impossible by the air-conditioned transport of the modern world. Kerouac marinaded his readers in all the scented flavours of his vast and exotic homeland \u2013 sights such as the thunderheads over Bear Mountain and \"the sun the colour of pressed grapes\", the sound of its jukejoints and rattling boxcars, the soft fragrance of wood smoke and chilli beans as he neared the Mexican border. At one memorable moment he watched the Mississippi river \"with its big rank smell that smells like the raw body of America&#xa0;itself\".</p> <p>When eventually published in 1957, <em>On the Road</em> was both roundly slated and praised to the rafters. It's not hard to see why it caused such a commotion. \"Somewhere along the line I knew there'd be girls, visions, everything,\" Kerouac famously observes at the start. \"Somewhere along the line the pearl would be handed to me.\" But to its admirers the book was a mind-loosening catapult through the doors of perception to wring every last drop of experience from some galaxy waiting to be discovered. The <em>New York Times</em> called it \"the most beautifully executed, the clearest and the most important utterance yet made by the generation Kerouac himself named years ago as 'Beat' and whose principal avatar he is\".</p> <p>In a perfect piece of self-mythology, its author claimed he'd typed it on to one continuous 120ft taped-together roll of teleprinter paper in a manic three-week writing jag in the spring of 1951, sustained by pea soup, coffee and \"bennies\" (indeed he <em>did</em> originally and the hallowed scroll still exists and is <a href=\"http://www.bl.uk/whatson/exhibitions/kerouac/index.html\" title=\"\" rel=\"nofollow\">currently on display in the British Library</a>). But an old girlfriend, Joyce Johnson, recently told the <em>Observer</em> he'd actually spent <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/sep/16/jack-kerouac-ex-girlfriend\" title=\"\">years revising the work</a>, carefully crafting each paragraph \"like a poem\".</p> <p>Whatever, the style was extraordinary, hugely influenced by the prose explosions of his hero James Joyce's <em>Ulysses</em> and, rhythmically, by the arrival of bebop. Someone once pointed out that the book was born at the moment jazz was evolving from Charlie Parker to Miles Davis, and it's true: you can hear both Parker's frantic locomotion and the elegiac overtones of Davis in this sparkling moment when Sal and Dean enter a dive bar in San Francisco's Folsom Street: \"Boom, kick, that drummer was kicking his drums down the cellar and rolling the beats upstairs with his murderous sticks, rattlety-boom! A big fat man was jumping on the platform making it sag and creak \u2013 'Yoo!' The tenorman was drawing his breath for another blast \u2013 Chinese chords, shuddering the piano in every timber, chink and wire \u2013 boing!\" It still crackles today; you can practically smell the tobacco smoke and taste the iced bourbon and tap water.</p> <p>But the book's real influence was something else entirely. The network of interstate highways was in place in the late 40s but used mostly for commercial traffic. No one had explored its real potential. Kerouac's adrenalised bursts from coast to coast in a blizzard of speeding tickets somehow made the country seem smaller. You could drive from New York to LA on six tanks of cheap fuel! The endless big-sky landscapes were a metaphor for the limitless possibilities of mental and physical adventure, and your classless ragtag band of fellow travellers were the portals to a brave new liberated world.</p> <p>Would the Stones have ever covered Route 66 if they hadn't read <em>On the Road</em>? Would Chuck Berry have written Promised Land (\"I left my home in Norfolk Virginia, California on my mind/ Straddled that Greyhound, rode him past Raleigh and on across Caroline\")? Would anyone have filmed <em>Easy Rider</em> or <em>Paris, Texas</em> or even <em>Thelma and Louise</em>? Could <em>Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas</em> have happened without it? Would Paul Simon have taken four days to hitchhike from Saginaw in his quest \"to look for America\"? Kris Kristofferson's Me and Bobby McGee virtually is <em>On the Road</em>. The windblown visions of 70s rock bands such as the Eagles and the Grateful Dead seem unimaginable without it, as does the warm tarmac of Bruce Springsteen's open-road fantasy. Nirvana and U2 both collaborated with William Burroughs (the morphine-addicted Old Bull Lee in the book) and the Clash with Allen Ginsberg (who's Carlo Marx). Tom Waits wrote a song called Jack and Neal (Neal, of course, being Neal Cassady, the real-life Dean Moriarty and the lunatic driver of Ken Kesey's bus chronicled in Tom Wolfe's <em>The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test</em>). Kerouac turns up in lyrics by Belle &amp; Sebastian, 10,000 Maniacs, the&#xa0;Go-Betweens, Morphine and Beastie Boys. Even the pulsing electronic soundscapes of Brian Eno or Moby seem to have echoes in the book's endless space and sense of&#xa0;adventure.</p> <p>But the key torch-bearer is Bob Dylan. \"<em>On the Road</em> had been like a bible for me,\" he said in his memoir <em>Chronicles: Volume One</em>. \"I loved the breathless, dynamic bop poetry phrases that flowed from Jack's pen,\" and the way the author was magnetically drawn to \"the mad people \u2013 the ones who were mad to live, mad to talk, mad to be saved, desirous of everything at the same time, the ones who never yawn. And I felt like I fit right into that bunch.\" The cast of grotesques in Dylan's Desolation Row is all the verve and lunacy of <em>On the Road</em> compressed into 11 minutes 21&#xa0;seconds.</p> <p>Sadly, the people who seemed to benefit least from the book were its two leading lights themselves. Neal Cassady's chequered life would have given even Jerry Lee Lewis a run for his money \u2013 in and out of reform school, he'd married a 15-year-old girl, been tossed into San Quentin and died of an accidental barbiturate overdose on a Mexican railway track at the age of 42. But Jack Kerouac's fate seemed somehow worse. Unable to handle his celebrity, he eventually succumbed to booze-related liver failure at the age of 47.</p> <p>The latest extension of his legend is now finally with us, the movie that's taken 55 years to emerge, despite Kerouac's letter to Marlon Brando in 1957 urging him to buy the film rights&#xa0;and play the role of Moriarty \u2013 \"you play Dean and I'll play Sal and I'll&#xa0;show you how Dean acts in real life\". I can picture them now in that scene where the two of them slide off from the grape harvest in Bakersfield to lie under stars, Kerouac expressing all the drive and optimism of his early years, the pearl being handed him on a plate.</p> <p>\"Ah it was a fine night, a warm night, a wine-drinking night, a moony night, and a night to hug your girl and talk and spit and be heavengoing,\" he declares. \"And this we did.\"</p>",
  "<p>Have people finished denouncing <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/oct/05/april-jones-kay-burley\" title=\"\">Kay Burley</a>? Have they calmed down about her live interview on Sky News during the April Jones case, in which she told searchers that it was now a murder investigation and that the five-year-old was not expected to be found alive? Has Twitter, that great, self-appointed moral arbiter of our times, stopped pursing its sanctimonious cat bum mouth about how \"cruel\" she is? If the tirade against Burley has abated, it might be time to ask a question: whatever you think of Burley, is it fair to castigate her, or any other on-air reporter, for the act of rolling with rolling news?</p> <p>This is no apologia for Burley, though it hasn't escaped my notice how regularly she gets billed as the Wicked News Queen of the West. Watching the clip of the offending interview, here are some other things to notice. The searcher that Burley starts interviewing is already aware of the development and has agreed to be interviewed; a second searcher joins the interview, wanting to know what has happened. Burley apologises for breaking the news and eventually leaves them to \"compose themselves\". When I say \"eventually\", the entire sequence takes about 90 seconds.</p> <p>Yes, it's uncomfortable viewing and rather insensitively done. But then, what do people expect from a news medium that, by definition, rolls?</p> <p>Surely we all know by now that this is the nature of rolling news \u2013 it gathers up new information and then pelts you with it. Hard. Subtlety and nuance are not the point as fresh news breaks. The new information is the point. Do people seriously believe that non-TV journalists don't also move swiftly with changing agendas? Is it presumed that, even now, they're only talking to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/oct/05/april-jones-machynlleth-residents-hope\" title=\"\">Machynlleth </a>locals about things that happened five days ago, because they don't want to alarm them with updates? All branches of news media aim to move stories on \u2013 that's the job. The fact that someone is actually filmed in the process of doing so doesn't single out their behaviour as \"cruel\".</p> <p>Worse than this is the stench of hypocrisy. Rolling news only exists because of public demand. In high-profile cases such as April Jones, people want news instantly. We have scant patience for the aforementioned subtlety and nuance, just a voracious appetite for fresh information. No one turns on Sky or BBC News, wanting to see \"Breaking news: reporters would find out more, but they don't want to appear insensitive\".</p> <p>At other points, there <em>is</em> time for subtlety and nuance: endless hours of it, because there's no fresh news. Ironically, this is when viewers get most irritated with the rolling news format. It's just the same information, runs the line; it's just repeating what they said before, nothing's changed. In some cases, maybe these are the same people who then piously complain when fresh information is handled in a less than august manner, when the process of rolling news becomes accidentally clumsy, verging on brutal.</p> <p>Indeed, there seems to be a disconnect with what consumers demand from rolling news and our discomfort regarding the process \u2013 how much occasional on-air messiness we will deign to accept? Which is a bit like saying: \"I demand bacon for breakfast\" and then getting all high and mighty about the butcher killing a pig. People who turn to rolling news because all they want is information can't then complain when that's all they get.</p> <p>The fact is, there was no cruelty. At worst, Burley made an insensitive blunder. In rolling news, it's always going to happen. If you don't want to see it happening, switch off. Whatever the channel, or reporter, it would seem that the price of getting television news instantly is that sometimes we're going to get it messily. Tarring and feathering the likes of Kay Burley isn't going to change that.</p> <h2>All this fuss about one mild heckle speaks volumes</h2> <p>Why all the fuss about <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/oct/05/ed-miliband-labour-heckler-schoolgirl\" title=\"\">Joan al-Assam</a>, the 15-year-old whose speech about the chances she'd been given by her academy school was interrupted at the Labour conference in Manchester. Ms al\u2013Assam came to this country as a refugee, had a tale to tell and deserved a fair hearing. But, frankly, she got one. Is it really such a disgrace that someone in the audience shouted that some comprehensives teach well, too?</p> <p>This wasn't a profanity or an insult; it was merely a differing opinion. Not airing it might even have been deemed patronising to a young speaker who clearly wanted to be taken seriously. It's not as if she were a three-year-old stumbling through Incy Wincy Spider. Indeed, the righteous condemnation in the aftermath said rather less about the heckler than it did about the increasing sanitisation of conferences.</p> <p>Sure, there's an element of pick your targets wisely and perhaps <em>not</em> schoolgirl guest speakers. However, people should be allowed to air their views. Better that than a political conference that's akin to a rundown Oscars, with everyone just sitting there, glassy eyed, blandly applauding, lest they be carted off by some \"One-Nation\" Stasi.</p> <p>Joan al-Assam looked more than strong enough to take a bit of audience banter. A political conference should be able to take it too.</p> <h2>Rod, really. We need a firmer attitude</h2> <p>Could it be that <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-2213130/Rod-Stewart-confesses--Women-threw-I-just-got-tired-sex.html\" title=\"\">Rod Stewart </a>wasn't the feral sex monkey of legend? Stewart has revealed that, while in the Faces, he and Ronnie Wood grew tired of having wild sex with zillions of women, and wanted to feel \"something special\" for a female. Well, how incredibly touching \u2013 if you're in Keane or Coldplay. The public just doesn't expect this kind of soppiness from Rod Stewart.</p> <p>This is the man whose one-time look (Spandex onesie, teamed with tartan tam o'shanter, and football scarf) encapsulated a classic brand of rock stardom. Some might say \"classic\" as in from the Neolithic period, but others saw the value in it.</p> <p>With Brand Rod, there was no confusing horsing about with Hare Krishna or rainforests. No messing about in big white beds with conceptual Japanese artists who split your band up. Stewart was a guy who stuck to his rock'n'roll principles: leggy blondes, fast cars, big hair, and tight trousers. And then, hey, why not, a few more leggy blondes. I'm not saying that Rod had a one-track mind, but he was the kind of rock star one could easily imagine taking a microphone stand out on a date if mischievous roadies had put the right wig on it back in the late 1970s.</p> <p>The thought of a young Rod and Ronnie, barely into their twenties, sitting around, next to a guitar-shaped swimming pool, moping and whinging to each other that \"birding\" had become a chore, and all they wanted was a deep and meaningful relationship, is enough to send shockwaves through a music industry that still has many (many!) \"Best of \" compilations to shift. Please Rod; stop this foolish talk of feelings and depth. Think of your brand.</p> <p>Comments will be turned on later this morning</p>",
  "<p>\"I wish I could be half as sure of anything as some people are of everything,\" said the American humorist Gerald Barzan, which neatly summarises the motivation for this uneven but stimulating book. <a href=\"http://www.dylan.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Dylan Evans</a> thinks \u2013 rightly \u2013 that most of us are bad at thinking about, let alone managing, risk. The way he puts it is that different people display different degrees of \"risk intelligence\", defined as \"the ability to estimate probabilities accurately\". At the heart of risk intelligence is the ability to gauge the limits of one's own knowledge \u2013 \"to be cautious when you don't know much, and to be confident when, by contrast, you know a lot\". And to have a rational strategy for obtaining relevant knowledge when you don't know much.</p> <p>Most of us aren't good at this. Consider an everyday scenario: you're buying a big flat-screen TV. The salesperson asks if you are interested in purchasing a three-year extended warranty. Most of us hum and haw and wonder what commission the salesperson is getting, whereas in fact we should be considering the price of the TV, the cost of the warranty and the probability that the TV will fail within four years \u2013 all data available to anyone prepared to do a spot of Googling. It's possible that the extended warranty is actually a good deal but most of those who buy it will do so mainly on the basis of a vague hunch that it makes sense.</p> <p>And it's not just lay people who are bad at assessing probabilities. Medical students aren't too hot at it either. Evans cites a question he's posed to hundreds of them. Suppose you are tested for HIV and the test comes back positive. What is the chance that you have the condition? Most people think they must be pretty high. Only a few reply, correctly, that you need more information to work out a sensible answer. You need to know how good the test is, and how many people like you have the condition in question. And you need to know about Bayes's theorem, which calculates how much stronger (or weaker) beliefs should become when new information is taken into account. (Evans's answer to the question is 4%, by the way.)</p> <p>Many years ago the psychologist Howard Gardner attacked the absurdity of measuring human intelligence on a single dimension. He identified <em>eight</em> different kinds of intelligence. Later, another psychologist, <a href=\"http://danielgoleman.info/\" title=\"\">Daniel Goleman</a>, added a ninth: emotional intelligence. Evans argues that we should now add a 10th: risk intelligence.</p> <p>Low risk intelligence is an endemic problem in most societies. Signs of it are everywhere: in the \"paranoid parenting\" that prevents us from allowing our children to live normal lives; in the irrational fear of crime that blights the lives of <em>Daily Mail</em> readers; in the inability of our media to communicate accurately about uncertainty, which they interpret as \"increased certainty that things are going to get worse\"; in the worst-case scenarios that lead to the security theatre on display at airports; and in the general need for \"closure\" about troubling events that leads us to think any answer is preferable to none.</p> <p>What's worse is that our society is irredeemably favourable to low risk intelligence. People who are confident and articulate tend to be admired while those who are more probabilistically informed are devalued. And this matters because our inability to handle risk leads to hysterical debates and makes rational policy-making on nuclear power, policing, immigration, terrorism or GM crops impossible. In relation to risk, stupidity seems to be humanity's default option.</p>",
  "<p>Modern communication devices have a lot to answer for. Not only do they communicate but, being modern, they do it instantly and effectively.</p> <p>If Roy Hodgson felt like banging his head against a brick wall the day he woke up to discover his charming but wildly naive tube excursion was all over the newspapers, complete with eerily unsettling photographs of the England manager smiling into the cameras of telephones that would shortly be contacting national newsdesks, it was nothing to the sinking feeling that Roberto Di Matteo encountered on being informed mid-press conference that Ashley Cole had just tweeted his verdict on the Football Association.</p> <p>The Chelsea full-back apologised for his petulant reaction, as did Hodgson for his rather less forgivable public discussion of Rio Ferdinand's international future, but in both cases the damage had already been done. That's life these days. Instant judgment, instant dissemination. You can try to go back and cover the traces but people know what they choose to remember.</p> <p>Hodgson will not go down in English football folklore as a jolly man of the people who freely chats to fellow commuters on the way to work, any more than Christian Gross did at Spurs. He has just earned himself a reputation as a silly old duffer who did not realise that what used to be private conversations are now saleable commodities.</p> <p>Cole has already gone down in English football folklore as a man of few words but some pithy and highly printable opinions, and thanks to Twitter the world can now share his latest intemperate outbursts long after he has thought better of them.</p> <p>In his defence, at least Cole did not sit on the fence. The FA's commission effectively called him a liar \u2013 the section of their report detailing his evidence refers to the \"evolution\" of his statement \u2013 and if he objected to that most people would back his right to say so in the most forthright of terms. Many might go even further and argue that having delivered his pronouncement Cole should have stuck to his guns, even though it seems to have occurred to the player on the way home from the Chelsea treatment room \u2013 where he \"saw the captions on the TV screens and tweeted my feelings in the heat of the moment\" \u2013 that such a confrontational stance might not be the wisest course of action for an England international on 98 caps.</p> <p>The FA seem positively eager to accept Cole's apology, perhaps recognising that <em>mea culpas</em> from the direction of Chelsea are almost collectable rarities, perhaps acknowledging that any major sanction such as curtailing his England career would be a farcical overreaction. Cole is a perfectly good left-back and the country would invite even more ridicule on itself were it to lose a third member of a once settled back line over events that either did or did not take place on the Queens Park Rangers pitch 12 months ago.</p> <p>To recap what scarcely needs recapping, this sorry saga has already cost England the services of Fabio Capello, John Terry and Rio Ferdinand, and adding Cole to the list would not only make the FA a laughing stock it would force Hodgson to consider his position, giving the story fresh legs which it might well use to run off in the direction of Harry Redknapp.</p> <p>Cole will probably have to be fined \u2013 because Rio Ferdinand was fined \u00a345,000 for his \"choc-ice\" tweet and it is important to appear even-handed \u2013 but after that the FA should just take the hit to try to draw a line under this apparently endless business. Likewise Terry should take the hint, forego his right to appeal, and get on with serving a suspension that now appears incongruously lenient.</p> <p>While Cole's language might have been uncalled for, few could pretend that this entire matter has been handled well by English football. It has taken up a whole year, for a start, proving a major distraction to England's preparations for Euro 2012, and despite the FA's protestations that was not just because the police decided to get involved and take the matter out of their hands. The police investigation was not helpful, and neither was the convenient ease with which Chelsea managed to get the court proceedings shifted back until after the European Championship, but as the FA were ultimately to ignore the fact that Terry had been found not guilty in a court of law it is hard to understand why they spent the first nine months dithering. Especially when their eventual punishment of a four-match suspension amounted to little more than a wrist-slap in the context of the three-match bans routinely handed out for merely physical transgressions. Even at this late stage the FA are still sending out mixed messages, and it is incomprehensible to most people why they continue to publicise the fact that they do not consider Terry a racist.</p> <p>Had they intervened and investigated at the earliest possible stage, there may even have been no need for police proceedings and unedifying courtroom revelations. The police only acted once a complaint had been received. It was none of their business until then, and it could be the case that the anonymous caller \u2013 or callers, though it is not thought there were many \u2013 may not have set the process in motion had the football authorities been seen to be dealing with it.</p> <p>Sepp Blatter drew widespread condemnation a year ago when he suggested incidents of racist abuse on the pitch should be settled by a handshake at the end of the game, and though it was fair to draw the conclusion that the Fifa president was speaking from his usual Swiss mountain top with only a distant view of real life taking place at ground level, he had a point in maintaining that speed is of the essence in these matters. A handshake at the end of the game would not have patched up the Anton Ferdinand-John Terry quarrel, nor the Luis Su\u00e1rez-Patrice Evra disagreement for that matter, but swift and business-like direction from the football authorities at the first sign of trouble might have prevented much of the unpleasantness that followed.</p> <p>What the game must not do again is sit back and let the clubs take charge, because that is how you end up with Liverpool's now notorious T-shirt gesture at Wigan last season, Su\u00e1rez declining to shake Evra's hand at Old Trafford, and Chelsea prolonging everyone's agony by getting Terry's court case put back until the end of the season. Meanwhile the two players worked on statements that would end up being dismissed as implausible.</p> <p>Wounds that are not treated immediately tend to fester, and before the Ferdinand-Terry case we hardly knew what festering meant. Considering the QPR player never heard the alleged insult at the time it is astonishing how the matter has dragged on, and who it has dragged down. Drawing a line in the sand is not easy when the sand has the consistency of mud and keeps shifting beneath the feet, but let us hope that between them the FA commission's report and Cole's reaction mean the end of this tiresome business is somewhere in sight.</p> <p>What we have all learned in the past 12 months is that racism in football needs to be taken seriously. What the game needs to do next is find a way to deal with it instantly. Follow the example of Hodgson's fellow commuters and Cole's instinctive recourse to Twitter, even when upset. Get it out there. Don't wait, act. There is nothing to be gained from hanging about.</p>",

  "<p>Once a Republican citadel which welcomed presidential candidates from Goldwater to Bush, the southern Californian city of Santa Ana is no longer a bastion of conservatism. Street vendors hawking soccer T-shirts in their native Spanish outside packed taquerias and panaderias show the diverse face of the city and the size of the challenge to California's declining Republican Party in the heart of its ideological cradle, Orange County.</p> <p>Santa Ana is a flashpoint for <a href=\"http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/06/0669000.html\">America's changing demographics</a>. The city's Republican party is locked in a struggle with the statewide California Republican group, over how it can win back a burgeoning Latino population that has turned the state bright blue.</p> <p>The city has shifted from having been the domain of fiery Republican Congressman \"B-1\" Bob Dornan to being represented by <a href=\"http://lorettasanchez.house.gov/\">Democrat Loretta Sanchez</a>. Santa Ana is one of the few cities in the county where Democratic registration is much higher than that of the Republicans. In the 2008 presidential election, Barack Obama defeated John McCain in the city by a landslide \u2013 65% to 32%.</p> <p>\"The Latino vote is going to make a big difference,\" said Tamar Jacoby, a self-described conservative who is president of <a href=\"http://www.immigrationworksusa.org/\">ImmigrationWorks USA</a>, a federation of state-based pro-immigration business coalitions. \"That's where the divide is in the Republican Party \u2013 people who get it and those for whom it doesn't matter.\"</p> <p>Jacoby's organization, while non-partisan, has close ties to Republican forces favoring immigration reform and is among a small but growing group of conservatives who recognize that the party faces becoming irrelevant at state level. It can no longer elect a Republican to statewide office and it is on the verge of dropping below a one-third share of the state legislature. If the party wants to remain viable, it must recruit Latinos \u2013 and they are increasingly hostile to the party.</p> <p>\"Latinos don't agree with Democrats on many social issues, but they don't trust the Republican Party either,\" <a href=\"http://www.foxandhoundsdaily.com/2011/03/8810-why-the-sky-is-falling-california-republican-party/\">said California GOP political strategist Allan Hoffenblum</a>. Hispanics fear, Hoffenblum said, that the GOP's hard-line immigration policy \"singles them out\" for harassment and discrimination.</p> <p>The Lincoln Club of Orange County has long been a haven for relatively moderate Republicans. It recently broke the ice on the Republican immigration issue and departed from the conservative consensus. </p> <p>\"Republicans and a vast majority of Latinos agree that border security must be the first order of business. It's how Republicans propose to deal (or not deal) with the illegal immigrants who are already here that will either correct or exacerbate the perception that Republicans are racist,\" wrote Lincoln Club Executive Director Clare Venegas on Red County, a widely-read conservative website. \"Core Republican values such as the belief in free markets, strong national security and family values are a natural starting point for potential immigration reforms that could appeal to Latinos without compromising conservative principles.\"</p> <p>The Lincoln Club's <a href=\"http://www.lincolnclub.org/aboutus/immigration-statement/\">three-point plan</a> calls for increased border security and the creation of a guest-worker program that would allow foreign workers and illegal immigrants already in the US to apply for temporary work permits if they met requirements such as proof of employment and passed a criminal background check.</p> <p>The proposal echoes much of the reform that was called for by George W Bush during his first term as president. It was Bush, not the Democrats, who put comprehensive immigration reform back on the national agenda, via his 2004 State of the Union speech. But any notion of immigration liberalization has since been erased from the Republican establishment agenda.</p> <p>Jacoby argues that Bush's call to reform could serve as a model for whoever is elected president in 2012. </p> <p>\"Bush totally got the issue and was incredibly courageous on it,\" said Jacoby. \"I can't praise his understanding enough \u2013 he was truly Nixon goes to China. A lot of people understand we need scientists, but he realized we also need agricultural workers and we need a legal way for them to come. It's also about dignity and family, and not making them crawl around in the shadows.\"</p> <p>In the intervening years, however, the Republican Party abandoned calls for reform. In 2008 the presidential candidate John McCain, who a few years earlier had co-authored the most liberal of immigration reform measures with the Democrat Ted Kennedy, had moved back to a hardline position.</p> <p>It is no surprise that some of the more advanced Republican proposals on immigration are coming from California, and, more precisely, Orange County.</p> <p>California Republicans held power until in 1994 the then-GOP governor Pete Wilson, a moderate, <a href=\"http://migration.ucdavis.edu/mn/more.php?id=492_0_2_0\">lined up behind Proposition 187</a>. It was to prove a fateful decision. </p> <p>The proposition aimed to set up a citizenship-screening system that would cut off public services, including healthcare and education, from undocumented immigrants. It was slammed as unconstitutional and anti-immigrant. Wilson was re-elected on the crest of white support for the proposition, which was approved by a wide 59%-41% margin, but the courts blocked Proposition 187 and a backlash tidal wave of Latino registration and voting subsequently capsized the Republicans in California. </p> <p>With the exception of the former governor Arnold Schwarzenegger, Republicans have not been able to elect a single statewide office holder for more than a decade.</p> <p>\"It's not what you say \u2013 it's how you say it. Harsh rhetoric against Latinos is endemic throughout the Republican Party,\" said Hoffenblum. \"I'm Jewish and a lot of people would say to me, 'How come there aren't very many Jews in the Republican Party?' Well, if events back then were held at a country club where Jews weren't welcomed, people see that as anti-Semitic.\"</p> <p>Some of the party's most influential Republicans are urging the GOP's 2012 presidential nominee, Mitt Romney, to reconsider his tone on the issue of immigration.</p> <p>\"Don't just talk about Hispanics and say immediately we must have controlled borders. Change the tone would be the first thing. Second, on immigration, I think we need to have a broader approach,\" said <a href=\"http://latino.foxnews.com/latino/news/2012/06/13/jeb-bush-urges-romney-change-tone-on-immigration/\">the former Florida Governor Jeb Bush in June</a>.</p> <p>Despite the dilemma the GOP faces, for many Republicans the issue of immigration is rooted in principles \u2013 in particular, fiscal responsibility.</p> <p>\"It's a difficult challenge to the degree that demographics is destiny and to the extent that segments of society increasingly look to government for free stuff,\" said former Orange County State Assemblyman Chuck DeVore, now a senior visiting scholar at the <a href=\"http://www.texaspolicy.com/\">Texas Public Policy Foundation</a>, giving voice to the prevailing party position on the issue. \"Unless Republicans want to join Democrats in advocating for more government, it's doubtful whether they can win over this demographic unless they first convince them that less government is a better way to get good jobs.\"</p> <p>Many prominent Republicans reject the notion that the GOP's support for Proposition 187 was a game-changing mistake. Instead, they say the issue remains one of exaggerated entitlement and that ultimately voters, including Latinos, will need to accept free-market principles more openly.</p> <p>Recent election results have shown Santa Ana and Orange County Latinos voting in small majorities alongside Republicans on conservative social issues but remaining overwhelmingly Democratic on economic and tax issues and in presidential polling.</p> <p>\"Mitt Romney is a national businessman,\" said Jacoby. \"I think he has to see and would see, as president, the economic benefits that immigrants bring. It's not a new debate \u2013 in some ways the sharpness of the debate within the party comes and goes.\"</p> <p>Many Republicans recognize the need for some type of reform but are reluctant to reward anyone who entered the US illegally.</p> <p>\"We must remember that there are hundreds of thousands of legal immigrants in Orange County who waited their turn,\" said Shawn Steel, the Republican National Committeeman from California who is a former chairman of the state party. \"That includes my wife, an immigrant from Korea.\"</p> <h2>Pueblo factbox</h2> <p>(All demographic data comes from the 2010 US census.

  "<p>Serving tea, coffee and cake at the Hot Gossip cafe in the centre of Henley-on-Thames, Lorraine Hillier says local people are all of one mind. \"We all want him back,\" says the former deputy mayor, who is a Tory councillor, when asked about Boris.</p> <p>\"Do I think the current MP would stand aside for him? I think he may recognise that, yes. We have a very good MP in John Howell, but he always knew Boris was a hard act to follow.\"</p> <p>Rumours that mayor of London Boris Johnson, MP for Henley from 2001 to 2008, could be looking for a dramatic return to parliament via a reunion with his old seat have been circulating for months.</p> <p>Other parliamentary berths which could be vacated for Johnson are also being gossiped about. In Croydon South there is talk of a deal after the MP, Richard Ottaway, refused to say if he might retire and hand over to Boris. \"All these matters will be resolved\", Ottaway said.</p> <p>But it is Henley where Johnson's heart, and second home, lies. In the town there is little hostility to David Cameron, but there is little affection for him either. It is different with Boris. In the market everyone has an anecdote about the first time they saw his shock of dishevelled blond hair. They all tell stories, fondly, of his frayed shirts, terrible timekeeping and bumbling manner.</p> <p>\"At every event he went to, garden party or whatever, he would always somehow miss the reception party at the front by coming round the back. It was uncanny,\" said one.</p> <p>\"I remember when he was shopping in Silvers men's store for a jacket for the Henley regatta. He picked this one thing up and the attendant just said, 'erm, I think that's too hairy for Henley, Boris',\" said another.</p> <p>But while he is the object of ribbing, his ex-constituents respect him and think he could be prime minister. He gets things done, said Hillier, 56. \"He was very active in the town, he was great for fundraising, and if he said he would do something, he would do it.\" David Silvester, a fellow Henley councillor, said: \"I think he would probably be better for the country than the present prime minister; rather him than this bumbling along.\"</p> <p>If Henley awaits the return of Boris with excitement, so do Conservative delegates gathering on Saturday for the party's conference in Birmingham. With Cameron's leadership in the spotlight, Boris \u2013 after his re-election as mayor in May and the triumph of the Olympics \u2013 is the golden boy. In Downing Street they know Boris will almost certainly outshine Cameron. And there is nothing they can do to stop him. </p> <p>On Monday evening, in front of 800 people, Johnson will speak for 10 minutes (followed by 25 minutes of questions and answers) at a ConservativeHome fringe-cum-victory-rally, entitled Boris Johnson's 2012: Re-elected and Olympotastic. It will be \"Boris unleashed\" \u2013 a \"tub-thumping\" performance, say friends. </p> <p>But aides have no idea what he will say. \"He always writes it at the last minute,\" said one. Boris will then go to a London Conservatives' meeting to hail the Olympic success again. On Tuesday he will address the full conference. Then after lunch he will be out of town, leaving Cameron to do his thing.</p> <p>David Cameron is a good conference performer and will no doubt put on a strong show. But he will need to, because Boris is far from his only problem. After months of policy U-turns, there are signs of a government losing its grip. </p> <p>The Tories are still reeling from two more own goals: the chaotic handling of the franchise decision on the west coast main line, and the row over chief whip Andrew Mitchell allegedly calling Downing Street police \"plebs\". Mitchell has decided not to turn up to conference because he will be a distraction. On Saturday Jeremy Hunt, the new health secretary, exploded another bomb by saying he backed a reduction in the time limit for women to have abortions from 24 to 12 weeks. Even the Tory right thought it an unwise move.</p> <p>Then there is the challenge from newly confident Labour, which emerged from its conference last week more optimistic and united than at any time since the May 2010 general election. Ed Miliband's 70-minute speech, launching \"One Nation Labour\", swept away many of the doubts about his leadership.</p> <p>Sunday's Opinium/<em>Observer</em> poll shows Labour has enjoyed only a small post-conference bounce, up two points to 41%, an 11% lead over the Tories, who are up 1%. But Miliband's personal ratings have improved impressively with his net approval rating of -10% being the best so far recorded by Opinium. Miliband is now well ahead of Cameron on -21% and Nick Clegg on -48%. Thirty per cent of voters approve of the way Cameron is doing his job (against 51% who disapprove) while 28% approve of Miliband's performance (with 38% disapproving).Cameron's lead is being eroded at a rate that will alarm his party.</p> <p>A couple of weeks ago, the Tories had wanted to paint Miliband as weak. They have been forced to finesse that message now. Instead they will begrudgingly accept that he can perform, but will tear into him for failing to address the biggest issue of the day: how to cut the deficit.</p> <p>\"The joke in the party is that it is quite an achievement to speak for 70 minutes without notes, but even more of an achievement to ... say absolutely nothing,\" said a senior strategist. \"The message from conference will be 'now it is time for the grown-ups'\".</p> <p>Cameron and chancellor George Osborne will paint themselves as hard men, capable of taking tough decisions on spending, education, welfare and pensions. \"Labour isn't learning\" will be another conference message.</p> <p>But grassroots Tories will not be content with Ed-bashing. Large numbers of MPs and activists are deeply unhappy, not just with life in coalition, but with what they see as the themeless leadership of Cameron. Many detest the idea of gay marriage, cannot comprehend why Cameron wants to pour billions more into overseas aid, and want a firm promise of a referendum on Britain's membership of the EU, which will almost certainly not be forthcoming.</p> <p>Writing in the <em>Observer</em> , the Tory MP Phillip Lee takes a potshot at all party leaders, including his own. \"Political packaging like David Cameron's 'big society' or, more recently, Ed Miliband's 'One Nation', mean nothing to voters who only want the tangible product inside the box.\" By contrast, he says Boris seems real.</p> <p>With over two years to go of this coalition, Tory voters will be crying out for evidence that the party still stands for Conservative values \u2013 on crime, immigration, Europe and on marriage. They won't want to hear that Miliband lacks authenticity and substance, anything like as much as they will want reassurance that their own leader possesses those qualities.</p> <p>Back in Henley, Charlotte Snowden, 39, a professional photographer selling her pictures on a market stall, says the first time she met Johnson he changed her life. \"I was sitting next to him at a lunch. I had young children and I knew he had five. I said, 'Boris, you've got children, I'm spending all night getting up to deal with them, how do you cope with it?' He lifted his head and just said, 'Don't get up'. And from then on I didn't and everything has been great.\"</p> <p>If Cameron made such a joke now he would be panned. But for the time being at least, Boris is a law unto himself.</p>",
  "<p>Insurgents in eastern Afghanistan killed two US soldiers on Saturday, hours after defence secretary Leon Panetta had criticised President Hamid Karzai for failing to recognise the sacrifice of Nato forces.</p> <p>The soldiers, who were members of a special-operations team, died in a fire-fight in Wardak province, south-west of Kabul. Their deaths bring the number of international troops killed in Afghanistan this year to 296, including at least 257 Americans.</p> <p>The development came amid a spat between Washington and Kabul over what is seen as failing US commitment to tackling terrorism in Pakistan.</p> <p>At a press conference on Thursday, Karzai criticised the the White House for concentrating on going after insurgents in his country, rather than militants based across the border. He accused the US of playing a \"double game\".</p> <p>Karzai also said Nato was not providing enough weapons for home-grown Afghan forces, suggesting that he might have to appeal to other countries, such as China and Russia, to get them.</p> <p>The comments drew an uncharacteristically angry response from Panetta. Speaking in Peru on Friday, the defence secretary said the Afghan president should be thanking allied troops rather than criticising them.</p> <p>\"We have made progress in Afghanistan because there are men and women in uniform who have been willing to fight and die for Afghanistan's sovereignty,\" he told reporters.</p> <p>\"Those lives were lost fighting the right enemy not the wrong enemy and I think it would be helpful if the president, every once in a while, expressed his thanks for the sacrifices that have been made by those who have fought and died for Afghanistan, rather than criticising them.\"</p> <p>More than 2,000 Americans have been killed in Afghanistan since the conflict began in October 2001. Tensions between the two countries have worsened amid a spate of so-called \"green on blue\" attacks, in which members of Nato forces have been killed by insurgents posing as Afghan police or members of the home-trained security force.</p> <p>Panetta has indicated that this increase in insider attacks will not alter plans for US withdrawal from Afghanistan. American troops are due to be pulled out by the end of 2014, handing the responsibility for security to Afghan forces. However, it is thought that as many as 20,000 US personnel could remain past that date, to assist in training and counterterrorism efforts.</p>",
  "<p>The hunt for missing five-year-old April Jones has intensified as police charge a former lifeguard, Mark Bridger, with her abduction and murder.</p> <p>Ten specialist police teams were conducting a \"systematic and methodical search\" in and around the Welsh market town of Machynlleth, where April was abducted on Monday evening as she was seen willingly to get into what is believed to have been a Land Rover Discovery.</p> <p>At a press conference in Aberystwyth, the Dyfed-Powys chief constable, Jackie Roberts, said it had been \"one of the most complex and fast-moving inquiries\" the force had faced. She said officers would \"exhaust all options\" in the bid to find April.</p> <p>Bridger, a local man known to the girl's family, was arrested on suspicion of abduction on Tuesday afternoon and rearrested on Friday on suspicion of murder. The charges against Bridger, which include perverting the course of justice, came an hour shy of the maximum 96 hours for which police were allowed to question him. Bridger will appear at Aberystwyth magistrates' court on Sunday.</p> <p>Superintendent Ian John promised that the \"momentum\" of the search would remain unaffected by the development and that they remained \"totally focused\" on finding April. \"We will be keeping April's family fully updated on progress of this investigation,\" he said.</p> <p>Many of the local community said they had clung to the possibility that April, who suffers from cerebral palsy, might still be found safe and well.</p> <p>The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) in Wales said that they had decided the police had gathered \"sufficient evidence\" to bring charges.</p> <p>Friends of April had told officers they saw her get into the vehicle at around 7.30pm on Monday.</p> <p>Since then, the town's surrounding area has been the focus of a huge search operation that continued to intensify with hundreds of mountain rescue personnel, potholers and police officers appearing to narrow their focus on the River Dyfi, particularly on a stretch upstream of Machynlleth to the home of Bridger.</p> <p>Bridger's property, called Mount Pleasant and sited in the hamlet of Ceinws, north of Machynlleth, was also the subject of further searches by forensic teams in white boiler suits.</p> <p>Meanwhile, mountain rescue reinforcements arrived in mid-Wales from the Pennines and Peak District as police revealed they had decided to increase the number of separate police search teams from eight to ten.</p> <p>April has not been seen since she climbed into the vehicle six days ago despite a search that has been described by police as \"unprecedented\" in scale.</p> <p>At daybreak a steady stream of volunteers arrived at Machynlleth leisure centre, the ad hoc headquarters for the missing persons inquiry carrying provisions to feed \"April's Army\", the local term for the hundreds involved in the escalating search operation to find the child.</p> <p>By 9am, long before the morning mist had risen, vans from Newport, Bristol, Swansea, London and Landudno had arrived with food parcels.</p> <p>Roberts said that the family of April had been \"overwhelmed\" by the reaction of the community in attempting to find the missing child.</p> <p>Close to 300 mountain rescue, cavers, dogs and their handlers were understood to be scouring the river system and steep sided valleys around Machynlleth along with an unidentified quarry. Simon Woodhead, a spokesman for Mountain Rescue England and Wales, said: \"We'll search for as long as there is something to search for.\"</p> <p>Among the Machynlleth community, a shared refusal to believe April might be dead was evident among many of those who had gathered at the leisure centre before lunch. Reverend Kathleen Rogers of the town's St Peter's church said until there is definitive proof, hope the child might be found alive will prevail.</p> <p>\"This little child is one of us, she belongs to this community. Unless anybody tells us different we will have this hope that she will be brought back safe.\" A \"book of hope\" in the church contains hundreds of messages. Pink ribbons, symbolising the optimism April might be found alive, flutter from trees and hedges across the valley.</p> <p>Right reverend Andrew John, the Bishop of Bangor, who will lead a prayer service on Sunday at St Peter's, admitted the community found it difficult to accept April might be dead. He believes that many had chosen not to countenance the worst-case scenario in order to keep focused on the search operation. He said: \"People don't want to touch it [the fact April might have been murdered].</p> <p>One of the many arriving with food at Machynlleth's Bro Ddyfi leisure centre was mother Laura Garrett, 24, from Tredegar, south Wales, who had brought eight huge vats of soup. Their sell by date she said pointedly was October 22, encapsulating the mood that few involved are prepared to surrender hope until they know April's fate for sure.</p> <p>Elsewhere, locals wandered around the small Welsh market town handing out pink ribbons. Student Kirsty Jones, 16, said: \"I don't think anyone will give up 100 percent hope until we know something.\"</p> <p>Carl Jones, volunteer co-ordinator for the search, is another who publicly refuses to believe the child has been murdered, batting away suggestions that April's body may have been washed out to sea. But the 47-year-old admits he is exasperated her whereabouts remain a mystery.</p> <p>\"We've looked everywhere. But we've got to keep believing,\" he said, saying the search might have to be extended further afield at some point.</p> <p>However, Woodhead, 38, explained that the science behind a search entailed that even if a particular location has already been examined it doesn't mean the search has concluded. He said repeat inspections might be necessary to \"reduce the likelihood of someone being in there.\"</p> <p>Certainly, the hunt for April is blessed with some of the best tools available. Among them, three-year-old border collie Isla who last year was judged the most gifted canine in the UK for tracking missing people.</p> <p>Isla, brought down from Wearside by owner Tony High, 40, is able to track \"human air scent\" from a dead or alive person from a quarter of a mile away. \"She's outstanding at picking up a trail of skin cells,\" he said.</p> <p>But even as the search grows, concerns are already evident over the sustainability of the operation. Although Dyfed Powys police have insisted the huge efforts would continue until at least Wednesday, the strain among many is evident, particularly the mountain rescue teams who are not paid and receive no expenses.</p> <p>Roberts said: \"Now that Mark Bridger has been charged with this horrific crime it is time to let the judicial process take its course and time to let the family come to terms with what has happened over the last week.\"</p>",
  "<!-- Block 1 --> <p><strong>Pre-match ponderings:</strong> Hello! And welcome to a gloriously sunny autumnal Saturday afternoon, packed with the kind of unbelievably exciting fixtures which make the Premier League the best league in the entire world, better in oh so many ways than all the other countries' leagues, such as Swansea v Reading, and West Brom v QPR.</p> <p>Oh.</p> <p>As it happens, this afternoon's four top-flight fixtures feature every single member of the current Premier League bottom three, and just 30% of the current Premier League top 10. But we won't let that bother us, and will instead put all our energy into getting excited about third-placed <strong>Everton</strong>, who are at <strong>Wigan</strong>, sixth-placed <strong>West Brom</strong> against Mark Hughes' bottom-of-the-pile Rangers, and table-topping <strong>Chelsea</strong>. The latter will be proving that the old \"most competitive league in the world\" canard isn't quite all it's cracked up to be by slamming a bootful of beauties past hapless <strong>Norwich</strong> (disclaimer: some assumptions were made in the preparation of this sentence), who shipped five at home to previously winless Liverpool last time out. All eyes on John Terry and Ashley Cole, if selected (and their Twitter accounts if not).</p> <p>But we're not only interested in the top flight, even if we are denied the chance to follow the fortunes of the new leaders of the Championship because Cardiff's visit to hopelessly-out-of-sorts Ipswich is today's televised late kick-off. They could find themselves second by then, if <strong>Leicester</strong> extend their four-game run of wins at home to <strong>Bristol City</strong> (and to be more accurate, they could find themselves fifth if they get seriously unlucky). Also interesting: <strong>Blackburn</strong> hosting fellow Maytime Premier League relegationees <strong>Wolves</strong>; third-place <strong>Brighton</strong> taking the division's best away record to <strong>Derby</strong>; and rock-bottom <strong>Peterborough</strong>, who lost their first seven league games but have won their last two \u2013 away from home and everything \u2013 hosting 17th-place <strong>Nottingham Forest</strong> knowing that a third win on the spin would see them overtake their opponents and (probably) saunter merrily clear of the bottom three.</p> <p>In <strong>League One</strong>, unbeaten table-toppers <strong>Tranmere</strong> \u2013 \"If we play like we did in the second half at Scunthorpe, I don't think there's anyone in this league who can live with us,\" says Ronnie Moore \u2013 visit a <strong>Notts County</strong> side still in fourth but smarting after a nasty midweek defeat to second-placed Stevenage. \"What you don't do after a defeat is get off the bus,\" said Keith Curle, and I for one have absolutely no idea what he means.</p> <p>And in <strong>League Two</strong> there'll be a bit of a mini-league involving four of the top five, with second-placed <strong>Port Vale</strong> visiting fourth-placed <strong>Exeter</strong>, and fifth-placed <strong>Cheltenham</strong> hosting third-placed <strong>Fleetwood</strong>. <strong>Gillingham</strong>, already five points clear, will gleefully watch them all take points off each other while they seek to extend their 100% away record at mid-table <strong>Oxford United</strong>.</p> <p>So, that's what I'm excited about today \u2013 well, that and my own team's inevitable victory over whichever hapless bunch of unfortunates are unlucky enough to be ordered into their fearsome arena. What have I missed?</p> <!-- Block 2 --> <p>2.21pm: This Blackburn-related news is just in from the Press Association: </p> <blockquote> <p>\"Alan Shearer has admitted he is open to the possibility of taking up the vacant manager's role at Blackburn.

Nothing now to distract us from those 3pm kick-offs.</p> <!-- Block 8 --> <p>2.53pm: Sky's Soccer Saturday panel are discussing unpopular managers. I'm mildly surprised to hear that the one manager who Matt Le Tissier played under but didn't like, was Glenn Hoddle.</p> <!-- Block 9 --> <p>2.56pm: Players are strolling onto pitches across the nation. We're moments from matchtime.</p> <!-- Block 10 --> <p>3.00pm: Let's play football!</p> <!-- Block 11 --> <p>3.03pm: Fernando Torres just broke the Norwich offside trap, with three minutes played, but delayed his shot, was forced wide, then had to check back and give the ball away. He should just have smacked it into the back of the net.</p> <!-- Block 12 --> <p>3.06pm: <strong>GOAL! West Brom 1 QPR 0!</strong> Lovely cross from Shane Long on the right wing, who pegged it past his full-back as if on a jet pack, and then curled the ball onto the head of James Morrison, who headed back across goal and in. Simple, and excellent.</p> <!-- Block 13 --> <p>3.07pm: \"Ashley Cole, he tweets what he wants,\" sing the Chelsea fans.</p> <!-- Block 14 --> <p>3.11pm: <strong>GOALS! First, Chelsea 0 Norwich 1!</strong> A superbly controlled low volley from Holt from 15 yards out, from some other fella's knock-down.</p> <!-- Block 15 --> <p>3.12pm: <strong>Another goal! Wigan 1 Everton 0!</strong> This time it's a cross from the left which Arouna Kon\u00e9 nods in from two yards out. Was he offside? It certainly looked that way!</p> <!-- Block 16 --> <p>3.14pm: <strong>And another goal! Wigan 1 Everton 1!</strong> Another header from no distance out! Everton bring the ball towards the edge of Wigan's area but the player who attempts a curler to the far post falls over while he's doing it, and the ball is miscued onto the head of Jelavic, two yards beyond the far post, who nodded in.</p> <!-- Block 17 --> <p>3.16pm: <strong>And yet another goal! Chelsea 1 Norwich 1!</strong> And that's the goal of the day so far. Mata gets the ball on the right wing, towards the byline. He backheels to Ivanovic, whose excellent first-time cross is headed into the far corner by Fernando Torres.</p> <!-- Block 18 --> <p>3.23pm: <strong>GOAL! Chelsea 2 Norwich 1!</strong> Torres attempts to overhead kick a bouncing ball in the Norwich penalty area, and indeed succeeds in completing the overhead kick. But instead of flying into the back of the net the ball scoots away from goal, straight to the onrushing Frank Lampard, who lashes it in from 18 yards.</p> <!-- Block 19 --> <p>3.25pm: <strong>GOAL! West Brom 2 (Zoltan Gera 22) QPR 0!</strong> Must admit I totally missed that one, but Matt Le Tissier tells me it was a nasty miskicked clearance from Anton Ferdinand that Gera simply slotted in.</p> <!-- Block 20 --> <p>3.26pm: <strong>Another goal! Wigan 2 Everton 1! </strong>This time Kon\u00e9 is the provider, running down the right wing, cutting into the penalty area and then rolling the ball, alarmingly slowly, just about into the path of Franco Di Santo, who slams it into the roof of the net from 12 yards.</p> <!-- Block 21 --> <p>3.30pm: Bradley Johnson just injured two Chelsea players in the space of about a second, bashing into Mikel and then slashing away at Lu\u00edz, as if engaged in some kind of human skittles. Both the boys in blue roll around for a while, looking quite put out, before getting on with the game. No booking for Johnson, which seems like a stroke of luck for the lad.</p> <!-- Block 22 --> <p>3.32pm: <strong>GOAL! Chelsea 3 Norwich 1!</strong> Mata carries the ball 40 yards and then slices the Norwich defence entirely and convincingly apart with a delicious killer pass, and Eden Hazard passes it into the corner of the net. That was very nice. They could score 50 here.</p> <!-- Block 23 --> <p>3.34pm: <strong>GOAL! Swansea 0 Reading 1!</strong> Swansea pass the ball around their defence, as they do. Pok, pok, pok, pok, pok. It ends up with Vorm, and Reading closing him down, so he puts his foot through it. Big mistake. Ten seconds later, and without touching the ball again, the home side are behind, Pogrebnyak eventually poking it under the keeper and into the net.</p> <!-- Block 24 --> <p>3.35pm: <strong>GOAL! West Brom 2 QPR 1!</strong> That's a super goal! Granero hits the ball over the West Brom defence \u2013 or three of them, the left back being 10 yards further back \u2013 and Taarabt chests it down and volleys it emphatically into the net. Nicely done.</p> <!-- Block 25 --> <p>3.37pm: Crikey! So many Premier League goals, it really is the best league in the world.</p> <!-- Block 26 --> <p>3.40pm: Another chance for Chelsea. Oscar collects the ball a couple of yards outside the penalty area, and with a small army of Norwich defenders blocking his path. He casually skips his way through them, but his side-footed finish is equally casual and Ruddy saves.</p> <!-- Block 27 --> <p>3.44pm: Another chance at Stamford Bridge, but this one falls to Norwich. Not much to it, really \u2013 a looping cross from the left wing, Grant Holt unmarked in the middle, and his header bounces a yard wide.</p> <!-- Block 28 --> <p>3.46pm: And a chance at the Hawthorns, where Morrison (I think) is played clean through, but Julio Cesar saves!</p> <!-- Block 29 --> <p>3.47pm: <strong>GOAL! Swansea 0 Reading 2! </strong>A Reading player has a shot blocked, but the ball falls to another Reading player, whose shot is also blocked, but the ball falls to a third Reading player, whose shot is also blocked, and this time the ball loops to Noel Hunt who volleys home from eight yards.</p> <!-- Block 30 --> <p>3.53pm: Fun and games at Vicarage Road, where Matej Vydra was sent off just before half-time \u2013 but nobody knows why. Chris Kamara on Soccer Saturday had no idea, and Watford's official Twitter feed is reporting that the \"crowd, journos and players [are] equally confused\". They're 1-1 with Middlesbrough at the break.</p> <!-- Block 31 --> <p>3.57pm: \"Greetings from Cairo,\" writes Simon Frank. \"With Chelsea handing out a pounding today, are we to expect a 'Ruddy Hell' headline tomorrow?\" Quite possibly, Simon \u2013 but <a href=\"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/sport/football/4337807/England-Euro-2012-news-John-Ruddy-out-of-Euros-with-broken-finger.html\">it wouldn't be the first time we'd have seen it</a>, I'm afraid.</p> <!-- Block 32 --> <p>4.01pm: Let's play football!</p> <!-- Block 33 --> <p>4.04pm: At Stamford Bridge, the first chance of the second half falls to Norwich, with Grant Holt again beating Terry in the air, but heading wide.</p> <!-- Block 34 --> <p>4.07pm: \"Simon, why on earth are the Norwich crowd booing Cole?\" asks Barry Praag. \"Are they FA stooges!\" There are any number of things that convince fans to boo an opposing player, some of them bizarrely trivial, but being Ashley Cole has got to be among the most compelling (for all that he's been a brilliant full-back).</p> <!-- Block 35 --> <p>4.09pm: Chelsea should have had a penalty there, as Barnett fairly cynically sticks out a leg to bring down Juan Mata, but the referee's not impressed.</p> <!-- Block 36 --> <p>4.11pm: More on the ghost red card at Vicarage Road. \"Saw footage at HT with Chris Kamara, here at #watfordfc for Sky Sports,\" writes whoever writes Watford's official Twitter feed. \"Kamara in absolutely no doubt that there was nothing in it at all.\"</p> <!-- Block 37 --> <p>4.13pm: Swansea hit the post! That was a not-very-good header that Alex McCarthy darn nearly flapped into the back of the net. In the end he merely flapped it onto the post, which was a stroke of luck. Having said that, I've just seen someone else on Twitter say the header was \"brilliantly turned onto the post\", so I could be being a tad harsh.</p> <!-- Block 38 --> <p>4.19pm: I may be making a bit of a big deal of this red card at Vicarage Road, which Kamara has now said on Sky Sports was \"completely wrong\", but a glance at <a href=\"http://www.soccerbase.com/referees/referee.sd?referee_id=1055\">the referee's stats for the season</a> are illuminating \u2013 it's his eighth red card in 10 league games. Last season he produced six in 34 \u2013 what happened to him this summer?</p> <!-- Block 39 --> <p>4.30pm: Ryan Dunne points out that Norwich fans might have been convinced to boo Ashley Cole not just by yesterday's Anti-FA Twitter outburst, but by the section of Cheryl Cole's forthcoming autobiography serialised in today's Sun. This details his extramarital indiscretions \u2013 \"Over the next few days I heard two more girls had come forward to say they'd had sex with Ashley. I didn't read the stories, but I knew one was saying it happened when Ashley and I were courting, and another said she slept with him a few months after our wedding.\" \u2013 and includes her yelling at her footballing then-husband: \"I hope she was worth it. It's the end of your marriage. It's f***ed!\"</p> <p>Incidentally, courting? Courting? Are you living in the 1950s, Cheryl?</p> <!-- Block 40 --> <p>4.31pm: <strong>GOAL! Swansea 1 Reading 2! </strong>Routledge's cross from just outside the right corner of the penalty area clips a defender's arse and skews to the far post, where Machu Pichu scores with a diving header. About time we had a Premier League goal, I must say.</p> <!-- Block 41 --> <p>4.34pm: <strong>GOAL! Chelsea 4 Norwich 1!</strong> Hazard's cross, Mata's hugely unconvincing attempt to control, Ivanovic's emphatic volley. Ruddy got both hands to it, but couldn't keep it out.</p> <!-- Block 42 --> <p>4.36pm: <strong>GOAL! Swansea 2 Reading 2! </strong>Reading give the ball away, Routledge plays a one-two, bursts into the penalty area, and scores at the near post with the outside of his right foot to complete Swansea's comeback.</p> <!-- Block 43 --> <p>4.39pm: Talking of comebacks, Crystal Palace were 2-0 down at home to Burnley after 40 minutes. They just made it 4-2. Nice.</p> <!-- Block 44 --> <p>4.41pm: Bakary Sako has put Wolves 1-0 up against Blackburn at Ewood Park. Quite a tasty strike, by all accounts.</p> <!-- Block 45 --> <p>4.43pm: <strong>GOAL! West Brom 3 QPR 1!</strong> Mulumbu passes the ball to Morrison on the edge of the area and then continues his run. Morrison plays a one-two with, um, someone else, gets into the box, and pulls the ball back for Mulumbu to score.</p> <!-- Block 46 --> <p>4.45pm: <strong>GOAL! Wigan 2 Everton 2!</strong> Everton's fifth penalty appeal is the first that the referee's agreed with. Leighton Baines, against his former club, makes no mistake from the spot, sending the ball flying into the top right corner of the goal (as he was looking at it).</p> <!-- Block 47 --> <p>4.49pm: Peeeeep! The final whistle has gone at Stamford Bridge, where Chelsea have beaten Norwich 4-1. And Reading have hit the bar at Swansea.</p> <!-- Block 48 --> <p>4.51pm: <strong>GOAL! West Brom 3 QPR 2!</strong> Another lovely goal, a decent spell of pressure ending with Esteban Granero receiving the ball from Park Ji-Sung, beating a couple of men with his turn and then chipping the ball into the near top corner of the net from just outside the penalty area.</p> <!-- Block 49 --> <p>4.54pm: Peeeep! West Brom have beaten QPR, though only just \u2013 the visitors' last chance coming from Granero's corner, which ended in a decent shooting chance being sent over the bar with the last kick of the game. Final score: 3-2.</p> <!-- Block 50 --> <p>4.56pm: Peeeep peeeep! All the Premier League matches are now over, with Swansea and Reading and Wigan and Everton all drawing 2-2.</p> <!-- Block 51 --> <p>5.00pm: In the Championship, Leicester go top, at least briefly, after beating Bristol City 2-0. Elsewhere Wolves won 1-0 at Blackburn, and Crystal Palace came back from 2-0 down to beat Burnley 4-3. In League One, leaders Tranmere have won 1-0 at Notts County, but League Two leaders Gillingham could only draw 0-0 at Oxford. At the other end, Barnet twice took the lead at Southend but still couldn't hold on, and drew 2-2. Meanwhile in the Scottish Third Division, Stirling Albion have beaten Rangers 1-0.</p> <!-- Block 52 --> <p>5.03pm: Meanwhile, the teams are in for the late kick-off at Arsenal.

  "<p>In the economically ravaged rustbelt city of Reading, Pennsylvania, ranked as the poorest metropolitan area in America, the majority Latino population is suffering from the double blow of vanishing jobs and poor education. Almost half of the 87,000 residents \u2013 58% of whom are Latino \u2013 are living below the federal poverty line.</p> <p>\"Reading is the face of America,\" said community leader and former city councilman Angel Figueroa, the first Latino elected to the council. \"And if we can fix Reading as a mid-sized city we can fix many mid-sized cities in the country.\"</p> <p>In an election year, Reading could easily be the proving grounds for Democrats or Republicans seeking to sell bold ideas for turning around the economy. But neither major party has invested much energy on the town's Hispanic community.</p> <p>Two decades before the current economic crash, Latinos from New York and other north-eastern cities came to Reading, lured by a steady job market. Reading's history is infused with the stories of Latino immigrants from Mexico, Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic who, since the early twentieth century, have moved into the city to work the mushroom fields and manufacturing jobs.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-audio\" data-canonical-url=\"http://player.vimeo.com/video/45206488\"> <iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/45206488\" width=\"460\" height=\"283\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowFullScreen></iframe> <p><a href=\"http://vimeo.com/45206488\">Luis Garriga, 51</a> from <a href=\"http://vimeo.com/jacobchung\">Jacob Chung</a> on <a href=\"http://vimeo.com\">Vimeo</a>.</p> </figure>  <p>\"We came here for a better life for our kids,\" <a href=\"http://vimeo.com/45206488\">Luis Garriga, a recent Puerto Rican implant from New York said</a>.</p> <p>Many Latinos who made Reading their home, came for the same reasons as Garriga. But as manufacturing plants have withered and closed across the rust belt, thousands of jobs have vanished. Work once abundant in the mushroom fields, steel mills, textile plants and auto parts factories and, more recently, hi-tech and even chocolate factories, is now hard to find.</p> <p>Garriga, who lost his home and ended up on the streets, knows personally how devastating Reading's recession has been. \"Had I known it was going to be this bad here, I would've taken my chances in New York,\" he said.</p> <p>In 2011 more than 3,000 jobs were lost as companies such as Hershey, Agere Technology and Dana Systems left the city, <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/2011/09/29/140932809/census-reading-pa-has-highest-poverty-rate\">former mayor Thomas McMahon said</a>.</p> <p>Even before the exodus of large manufacturing plants in 2011, <a href=\"http://www.readingpa.gov/documents/cornelius_speech111209_act_47.pdf\">the city was facing financial hardships</a>. Facing a continuing deficit, the city looked to be on \"life support.\"</p> <p>Since 2009 <a href=\"http://www.readingpa.gov/documents/act_47_recovery_plan.pdf\">Reading has been complying with Act 47</a>, a recovery plan that restructures the financial transactions of the city under the supervision of Pennsylvania's department of community and economic development and provides state assistance in planning, loans, grants and special measures to generate income via new taxes. But Act 47 means lowering salaries, outsourcing work and freezing new hires in the city at a time when jobs are desperately needed.</p> <p>Latino-owned businesses are the fastest-growing group in the city and now account for more than a quarter of the 4,568 businesses, Reading's <a href=\"http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/42/4263624.html\">community development director Lenin Agudo said</a>.</p> <p>\"We are the backbone of this city,\" Figueroa said. \"Latinos are the ones sustaining local businesses and big businesses. They are the workers of this county.\"</p> <p>Despite small signs of economic improvement, Latino leaders in Reading say they expected more from the Obama administration and hoped for more direct involvement from the White House in mapping out the city's recovery.</p> <p>President Obama last visited here during the 2008 presidential primary and <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=18DHM5sAMdU\">delivered a rousing campaign speech at Reading high school</a>, promising jobs. \"I will spend every day in the White House thinking about you, thinking about your hopes and dreams,\" he said. \"I need you to put me in there. I promise I'll be working for eight years to make your life better.\"</p> <p>But Obama has never returned. His visits to this strategic swing state have concentrated on the voter-rich cities of Pittsburgh and Philadelphia, each about an hour away. Democrats have a field office in the city but have not reached out in an organized effort to Latino leaders. To many Latinos in Reading, Obama's promises of putting the middle class back to work is now a faint memory.</p> <p>\"I wouldn't have used two years tackling healthcare reform,\" Figueroa said. Instead he should have focused more on the economy and education, he said.</p> <p>Hispanic leaders in the town also complain that Mitt Romney has failed to push his economic recovery policy of lowering taxes and reducing government regulations within the community in Reading. \"The Latino community is very independent. They're open minded,\" said <a href=\"http://www.centrohispano.org/\">Michael Toledo of Centro Hispano Daniel Torres</a>, a non-partisan group that provides services for Latinos and non-English speakers in the city.</p> <p>\"They want to hear about platforms that resonate with them. We want the economy to get better, we want to see job growth, we want to see more in terms of education and educating our youth.\"</p> <p>Neither Republicans nor Democrats have made an effort to connect with the Latinos in the city, according to the Reading council president Francis Acosta. Though a local Democratic party field office is less than a mile away from city hall, no effort has been made to mobilize Latino leader for the campaign.</p> <p>\"I was there when they opened the office,\" Acosta said. \"They'll usually start calling a week or two before the election.\"</p> <p>Despite the frustration at the apparent lack of political engagement, he still intends to side with the Democratic ticket in November. \"Could [Democrats] be better? Yes,\" said Agudo. But given another term in the White House, he believes, Obama could still turn things round.</p> <p>\"I'm prepared to give him my vote,\" he said.</p> <h2>Pueblo factbox</h2> <p>(All demographic data comes from the 2010 US census.

  "<p>Two of David Cameron's most senior cabinet colleagues are backing a rival vision to the prime minister's \"flawed\" detoxification of the Conservative party.</p> <p>Michael Gove and Iain Duncan Smith have thrown their support behind a group campaigning for a major overhaul of their leader's strategy.</p> <p>The education secretary and work and pensions secretary have raised funds for the <a href=\"http://conservativehome.blogs.com/\" title=\"\">ConservativeHome website</a> to turn itself into a political group formed on the principle that the Tory party modernisation programme has so far been \"badly flawed\".</p> <p>The onus will be on urging the prime minister to ditch the softening of the party's image on crime and immigration in favour of a political message that takes into account the plight of the poor and vulnerable. The development will be seen as a sign of a serious splintering in the cabinet over strategy, with Duncan Smith and Gove backing an approach that contradicts Cameron's famed attempt to soften his image on crime with his \"hug a hoodie\" message.</p> <p>A source said: \"The new group believes that the modernisation programme launched in 2005 is badly flawed. The real Tory problem is not that it is seen as too old-fashioned or too right-wing but too libertarian and too indifferent to the needy and blue-collar Britain.\"</p> <p>However, while criticising the 2005 vision of modernisation, the new group is also dismissive of the ideas being proposed from the right of the party, including by the former defence secretary Liam Fox.</p> <p>Tim Montgomerie, the editor of ConservativeHome and a former aide to Duncan Smith, would not comment on Gove and Duncan Smith's involvement but said the party needed to look to <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2012/04/04/john-major-20th-anniversary-election_n_1402921.html\" title=\"\">John Major's success in 1992</a> as its role model and not hark back to a mythical version of Conservative thought.</p> <p>He said: \"We are particularly keen to challenge the distorted view that the Conservative party has had of itself since Margaret Thatcher. She was our greatest peacetime leader but Tory history didn't start in 1979 and didn't end in 1990. We need to recognise other Tory heroes. Shaftesbury, for example, and his battle for social reform. Butler for education and social mobility. Macmillan for property ownership.</p> <p>\"Not only do we focus too much on Margaret Thatcher, but her most ardent disciples also forget her pragmatic side and exaggerate her libertarianism. Tories could more fruitfully study why the John Major of 1992 won a record-breaking 14m votes by combining a tax-cutting message with a vision for a classless society.</p> <p>\"We are proposing a challenge to the traditional right and to the liberal modernisers. Both have to learn that the Tory message has to be balanced. We need a strong message of wealth creation and a strong commitment to Britain's social contract. Most people know that Conservatives are the party of business but floating voters need to know we will use tomorrow's prosperity to enhance social mobility and enhance public services.\"</p> <p>In six month's time ConservativeHome will produce a paper on the Tory get-out-the-vote machine.</p> <p>In one year a new Little Blue Book will be published advocating an ideal Tory message at future elections and in the spring of 2014 it will offer an alternative Tory manifesto.</p> <p>The ConservativeHome website is supported by Lord Ashcroft but more than half a million pounds has been raised from other donors to fund this new initiative focused on winning the first Tory majority since 1992.</p> <p>ConservativeHome was founded in 2005 by Montgomerie. Although he stands on the Eurosceptic, tax-cutting wing of the Conservatives he has also advocated deep modernisation of the party's social message.

  "<p>Juli\u00e0n Castro, the mayor of San Antonio who burst on to the national political stage when he made the keynote address at the Democratic national convention in September, is selling his vision of the future to the city's top moneymakers. He pictures a Manhattan-like metropolitan core, with walkable streets and arts and culture worthy of America's seventh-largest city.</p> <p>Castro calls this vision \"San Antonio 2020\". In a city where <a href=\"http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/48/4865000.html\">two-thirds of the 1.3 million residents are of Latino heritage</a>, it is tempting to call it \"veinte veinte\".</p> <p>In fact, Castro hardly speaks any Spanish. But that is part of what makes his vision so powerful. In the fastest-growing major city in the country, a well-heeled and mostly white audience at the Witte Museum listens to the new-generation Hispanic leader, who is aged only 38, share his plans. In doing so, he is advancing a slow-motion political takeover of Texas.</p> <p>\"San Antonio is a peek at the Texas of tomorrow and the America of tomorrow,\" Castro says. \"We've called it the new face of the American dream.\"</p> <p>2020 is, by coincidence, the projected date by which, if current trends continue, the state will come full circle. Texas, which was once part of Mexico, <a href=\"http://www.window.state.tx.us/specialrpt/tif/population.html\"> will return to being majority Hispanic</a>.</p> <p>Texas is already a state with a majority-minority population \u2013 Hispanics account for about 38% of the population but other ethnic groups push the non-white proportion to 52%. This trend has enormous potential consequences for both main political parties.</p> <p>For Republicans, such demographic change spells a possible end to their long reign in the state. The Democrats have failed to seize their opportunity \u2013 on average, <a href=\"http://www.newstaco.com/2011/05/17/how-the-latino-vote-matters-in-2012/ \">Hispanics vote 3-1 for Democrats </a> \u2013 but the state GOP has nonetheless been swerving rightward, straight into a demographic brick wall.</p> <p>Despite the fact that Texas has not voted for a Democratic presidential candidate since Jimmy Carter in 1976, the Republicans may see their political Alamo in San Antonio. </p> <p>\"You get California, Texas and New York,\" says Choco Meza, a former Bexar County Democratic Chair, tracing the states' geographical positions in the air, \"and that little 'v' is for 'victory'.\"</p> <p>However, Texas Democrats have yet to match action to such enthusiasm when it comes to bringing out the Hispanic vote. Unlike in California or New Mexico, Hispanics in Texas have been fighting well below their political weight. Hispanic turnout rates are poor \u2013 almost half that of white or black voters in the state. <a href=\"http://www.census.gov/hhes/www/socdemo/voting/publications/p20/2008/Table%2004a.xls\">In 2008 only 38% of eligible Hispanics cast ballots in the presidential election</a>.</p> <p>San Antonio incubated such landmark political Hispanic groups as the League of United Latin American Citizens and the Southwestern Voter Registration Education Project. These and other movements began in the city's Westside, the heart of its Hispanic community. There lie both the symptoms and the solutions to the political woes of Texas' Hispanics.</p> <p>This barrio region begins a few blocks away from San Antonio's bustling downtown, where tourists flock to The Alamo and the Riverwalk. In the Westside, cheap, wood-framed houses are painted salmon pink or lime green; many have clothes drying on a line. Ernest Bromley, who walked Westside's tree-lined avenues in the 1970s as a political canvasser, sees the community's symbolic divide in the appearance of such houses.</p> <p>\"There are homes that take care of themselves; a lot of home pride and flowers that are well-kept,\" Bromley says, \"and others that are just trashed. You can be poor and have a nice-looking place.\"</p> <p>Bromley, a Democrat, and his Republican business partner, Lionel Sosa, are legends in the Hispanic community, having created the first advertising firm that reached an Hispanic audience. Sosa is a master of the emotional political ad who has advised dozens of Republican campaigns \u2013 including George W Bush's 2004 run that won 49% of the Texas Hispanic vote. The tagline for that campaign was <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHghAjADiXc\">\"Nos conocemos\" \u2013 \"we know each other\"</a>.</p> <p>For years, the Hispanic population in Westside was not politically engaged. As late as the 1960s, much of the area had dirt roads and a patchwork electrical service. Yearly storms created pop-up rivers that destroyed property and stranded residents. Disenchantment with the system kept turnout low, allowing such problems to fester. </p> <p>There has been some progress. From 1996 to 2008, Hispanic turnout increased by nearly 10 points and reached an all-time high for Hispanics. But the 38% turnout in the 2008 election was still <a href=\"http://www.census.gov/hhes/www/socdemo/voting/publications/p20/2008/Table%2004a.xls\">well below the 57% turnout among California's Hispanic population</a>.</p> <p>Castro, however, hints at something that could begin to galvanize Hispanic voters in San Antonio and beyond. \"It may come in the form of some great candidate or candidates that decide they're going to run [for governor],\" he says. \"And that's what lights up the Hispanic community.\"</p> <p>Castro swears he is not speaking of himself, though his political star is undoubtedly rising. Instead, he uses the example of his idol, Henry Cisneros. <a href=\"http://www.texasmonthly.com/preview/2001-07-01/reporter \">San Antonio's Hispanic vote doubled in 1981</a> when the striking, 6ft 3in, third-generation Mexican-American became its mayor.</p> <p>Cisneros, however, has a cautionary tale to tell. The nation's first Hispanic mayor of a major city had a rapid ascent to the national stage as part of Bill Clinton's administration, before he became embroiled in a scandal involving payoffs to a former mistress that ended his political career.</p> <p>Now a housing-policy consultant, Cisneros still lives on the Westside \u2013 in a community that he tried to modernize which is, in many ways, still stuck in the past. In the Westside, stagnation can take many forms. </p> <p>Crystal Cox, 26, returned home after earning her bachelor's degree, and found that little had changed. \"My best friend from elementary school lives across the street and she has a couple of kids,\" she says. \"It's weird to come back home and see people that I knew and they ended up just having kids and stopped with their education.\"</p> <p>Her friend follows an all too familiar and growing trend among Hispanics in Texas: <a href=\"http://hobbycenter.rice.edu/workarea/downloadasset.aspx?id=2147484251\">it is thought that by 2040, more than half will not graduate high school</a>.</p> <p>In 2011, <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/2011/12/22/144079041/texas-schools-grapple-with-big-budget-cuts\">the Republican legislature in Texas cut $4bn from public schools</a>. Party leaders argued that the state's budget had been in crisis, that cuts needed to be made, and that education spending was the largest piece of the pie.</p> <p>In <a href=\"http://www.texastribune.org/library/data/schools/\">a school system that is almost 50% Hispanic</a>, this was another harsh blow to the poorer districts \u2013 as well as to any Republican hopes of winning Hispanic converts.</p> <p>Even in a city as diverse as San Antonio, divides in class and race run deep. Henry Flores, dean of the Graduate School at St Mary's University and a consultant on many Democratic races, doesn't need to search too far to find remnants of a \"members only\" mindset.</p> <p>\"Take a look at the girls in that back party,\" he says, pointing to a stream of young women, dressed in their Texas best, heading to a restaurant's private room. \"You're not going to find any Latinas there.\"</p> <p>The political culture in Texas has capitalized on such small moments of division. Last year, two incendiary pieces of legislation alienated many Hispanics \u2013 one a voter ID law and the other a new district layout.</p> <p>Both have ended up in court. <a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052702304373804577525072239849392.html\">The voter ID law required Texans to show valid state ID at the polling place</a>. The Obama administration challenged it as a violation of the Voting Rights Act, claiming that it targeted poor Hispanics without driver's licenses.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/29/us/final-texas-redistricting-maps-approved.html\">The new district lines contained no new electoral regions that were majority Hispanic</a>. This too went through the legal system, to arrive at a compromise of two new Hispanic and two new Anglo districts. This was a disappointment to Hispanics, considering that they have driven 65% of the state's population growth in the past decade.</p> <p>Texas was different when the Republican businessman Sosa helped George W Bush win nearly half the Hispanic vote in 2004, with a message of strong family values and a welcoming atmosphere. Now, he says he can hardly recognize the party that plays on fear of Hispanic immigration and calls, in Mitt Romney's case during the Republican primaries, for \"self-deportation\".</p> <p>\"If you look at Reagan's position on immigration and amnesty, he did it,\" Sosa says. \"It was somewhat controversial, but no big deal.\"</p> <p>But as much reason as Democrat-inclined Hispanics have to vote, there has not been a momentous shift towards the ballot box. Voter-registration groups estimate that it would take a huge \u2013 and expensive \u2013 outreach effort to register the million Hispanics who could help to turn Texas blue.</p> <p>Big-party money goes toward swing-state campaigns, rather than a more distant investment like Texas \u2013 even one that could have such a high return.</p> <p>\"Democrat voters, even in Texas, send all their money to the swing states,\" says Lydia Camarillo of the Southwestern Voter Registration Education Project. \"Trying to build up the Hispanic voter base here just isn't the way they think. If it was and they did Texas would be purple in five years.\"</p> <p>Even the most optimistic Texas Democrats have a hard time looking at the years of unfulfilled expectations without showing their frustration. The numbers are there, the future is evident, and yet the moment remains just out of reach.</p> <p>\"I've been waiting for the Hispanic sleeping giant to wake up in the 70s, the 80s, the 90s and now [the] 2000s and I've seen it in Time magazine every decade,\" Flores said. </p> <p>When will the giant wake?</p> <p>\"The answer to that question is: 'I don't know.'\"</p> <h2>Pueblo factbox</h2> <p>(All demographic data comes from the 2010 US census.

  "<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prohibition_in_the_United_States\">Prohibition in the US was a huge, miserable failure</a>. During its 13-year run, beginning in 1920, Prohibition caused a massive rise in organized crime and actually increased alcohol consumption instead of curtail it. </p> <p>After Prohibition's repeal in 1933, kids didn't start drinking in record numbers. Society didn't collapse. Today, bathtub gin dealers don't run amok on playgrounds; microbreweries don't protect their turf with automatic weapons. Instead, a safe environment to drink was created when the government began regulating and taxing alcohol. </p> <p>And yet, here we are in 2012, giving Prohibition another shot. For lack of a better word, that's just stupid. </p> <p>Today, instead of alcohol prohibition, we've got the government's harmful attempt to prohibit marijuana use. With record federal deficits and states teetering on the edge of bankruptcy, why do we insist on dumping billions of tax dollars into another failed prohibition that is accomplishing nothing other than making criminals out of millions of regular citizens and fueling drug cartels that threaten our security?</p> <p>Last year, 800,000 people were arrested in the United States for crimes associated with marijuana \u2013 and marijuana alone. It's insane to arrest people for choosing to use a natural substance that is, by any objective standard, less harmful than alcohol, a drug that is advertised at every major sporting event. Think of the strain and costs to our law enforcement, court system and prisons. And for what? Is marijuana use decreasing? No. Are cartels any less powerful and violent? I'm afraid not. Is pot difficult for minors to obtain? Nope. In fact, when polled, kids say it's easier to get marijuana than it is to get alcohol. Why? It's simple. Black market dealers don't ID. </p> <p>And yet we go around and around \u2026 trying the same methods and always getting the same terrible results. Isn't it time to try something different?</p> <p>In 1999, when I was governor of New Mexico, I began advocating for marijuana legalization. At the time, there were precious few high-ranking elected officials willing to stick out their necks for this issue. It was considered political suicide.</p> <p>Today, polls in the US show that at least 50% of Americans are now open to the idea or fully supportive of legalizing marijuana. My experience is that, the more people look at the drug issue, the more they recognize that the \"war on drugs\" is a dismal and expensive failure. It's costing more than an absurd sum of money; it's costing people their future. </p> <p>In the US, 100 million people have themselves violated our drug laws at some time or another. In fact, President Obama has readily admitted his own youthful drug use. Had he been caught and arrested, would he be president today? How many promising young people's lives and ambitions are being derailed by senseless drug laws?</p> <p>This November, voters in several states will have the opportunity to vote on marijuana legalization and medical marijuana laws. I hope the citizens of these states will carefully consider these initiatives. Once they do, I'm confident they'll give them their full support. They just make too much sense. And as more states begin to align their laws with common sense and reality, it is inevitable that the federal government will eventually follow.</p> <p>I strongly believe the tide is turning on this issue, and it's because of education and thoughtful discussion. The more we learn about marijuana and our federal government's futile and ill-advised attempt to prohibit it, the more the solution becomes clear. America will be better-off when marijuana is managed like alcohol and tobacco. Our border with Mexico will be safer, and addiction will at last be treated as the health concern it is, rather than as a criminal justice issue. </p> <p>It's truly unfortunate that President Obama doesn't see what's coming. Not only does he refuse to acknowledge the support this issue is gaining, more shockingly, he has blatantly gone back on his promise to allow states to administer their own marijuana laws. The Obama administration has shut down hundreds of state-legal medical marijuana dispensaries and is currently threatening to shut down many more.</p> <p>It's odd: when it comes to marriage rights, President Obama is quick to cede the federal government's power to the states. But when it comes to states deciding for themselves how best to tackle the marijuana issue, Obama steps right in and insists that the federal government knows best. </p> <p>I am confident American voters this November will send a signal that the time is long past that we stop putting people behind bars and forever labeling them as criminals for behavior that is personal, private, and no more \"criminal\" than drinking alcohol or taking legal pain medicine.&#xa0;</p> <p>When that signal is sent, perhaps we can put an end to modern-day Prohibition, just as we did nearly 80 years ago.</p>"
