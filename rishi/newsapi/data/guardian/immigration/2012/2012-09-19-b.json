  "<p>It seems fitting that a day after BP confirms <a href=\"www.guardian.co.uk/business/2012/sep/19/bp-close-sale-texas-city-refinery\" title=\"\">it is on the verge of selling its Texas City oil refinery</a>, British MPs call for an Arctic drilling moratorium.</p> <p>The connection is that the Texan refinery was the scene of a terrible accident and the Arctic review might never have happened without another nasty BP accident: the Deepwater Horizon.</p> <p>The House of Commons environmental audit committee is right to call for a much tighter cross-Arctic safety regime and for at least some part of the region to be cordoned off from drilling too.</p> <p>This latter initiative would bring the Arctic closer into line with Antarctica: but huge problems stand in the way of it becoming a reality.</p> <p>Firstly the Arctic is in the hands of sovereign states such as Greenland (still partly controlled by Denmark) and Russia, which do not want outside interference in their \"national\" affairs.</p> <p>Closer to home, we have a government that has observer status on the (purely advisory) Arctic Council and has no wish to rock any political boats. In fact it has been a cheerleader of local companies such as Cairn Energy trying its luck drilling in these clear waters.</p> <p>So the UK government and others will try to push the EAC report \u2013 entitled \"Protecting the Arctic\" \u2013 under the carpet, if not the melting ice cap.</p> <p>But the expert testimonies, the findings and the recommendations, stand. They will be used by those who believe this region \u2013 which contains unique species, is experiencing climate change faster than anywhere else in the world, and could hold the key to human survival \u2013 is not treated as just another drill zone.</p>",
  "<p>British MPs are calling on Shell and others to halt \"reckless\" oil and gas drilling in the Arctic until stronger safety measures are put in place.</p> <p>Politicians also want to impose \"unlimited\" financial liability on operators and the creation of a \"no-drill zone\" in a new environmental sanctuary.</p> <p>The uncompromising demands have angered the energy industry but come just days after alarming new evidence has emerged about <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/sep/14/arctic-sea-ice-smallest-extent\" title=\"\">Arctic sea ice melting at record levels</a>. They also come on the day that an environment committee of MEPs in Brussels called for tougher financial guarantees from oil companies to ensure they could pay for spills in European waters.</p> <p>The British initiatives are contained in<a href=\"http://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/commons-select/environmental-audit-committee/news/announcement-of-report-publication1/\"> a report published on Thursday from the cross-party environmental audit committee (EAC)</a> of the House of Commons, which warns that the vulnerable Arctic region is being endangered by a misguided search for hydrocarbons.</p> <p>\"The shocking speed at which the Arctic sea ice is melting should be a wake-up call to the world that we need to phase out fossil fuels fast,\" said the committee chair, Joan Walley MP. \"Instead we are witnessing a reckless gold rush in this pristine wilderness as big companies and governments make a grab for the world's last untapped oil and gas reserves.\"</p> <p>She <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/today/hi/today/newsid_9753000/9753217.stm\">told Radio 4's Today programme on Thursday</a>: \"I think the particular problem is that when you are talking about offshore drilling and you are talking about drilling in such harsh circumstances as the Arctic, we have to have proven techniques in place first of all, and we're not convinced that that is currently the case. It is for that reason that we want to see all drilling halted until we've got the highest available environmental standards in place.\"</p> <p>The EAC said it had heard \"compelling evidence\" from experts during several months of hearings that if a blowout occurred just before the dark Arctic winter returned it would not be possible to cap any oil spill until the following summer.</p> <p>Shell is currently in the middle of an exploration attempt in the Chukchi Sea, Alaska, but has had to call off immediate drilling due to dangers from ice and a faulty safety dome, which would be used for capping wells in the event of a blowout. The Anglo-Dutch group has already been heavily criticised for allegedly failing to properly test a new dome.</p> <p>ExxonMobil, Gazprom and others are either already working or preparing to operate in the Arctic region off Russia, Greenland or Alaska.</p> <p>The first report by MPs into the new rush for resources, entitled \"Protecting the Arctic\", says there should be a drilling moratorium until \"the highest available\" environmental standards can be imposed right across the far north.</p> <p>The committee believes that a \"preferably unlimited\" financial liability regime should be imposed for all oil and gas operations in the area. And it says the petroleum industry should set up a special group to peer-review and publicly report on all safety-related operating practices.</p> <p>The British government has no legal rights to limit drilling around the waters of the far north but is an observer on the Arctic Council. However the committee believes that the UK should be pushing for a special zone to be created that would be off limits for all drilling \u2013 as in Antarctica: \"We see the development of such a sanctuary as a prerequisite for further development of the Arctic's natural resources.\"</p> <p>But the committee also expresses deeper concerns about the British government's support for UK companies drilling worldwide at a time when it is trying to reduce carbon emissions at home.</p> <p>The energy industry argues that new oil reserves must be found to meet growing demands worldwide and says it can operate safely, having learned lessons from BP's catastrophic accident with the Deepwater Horizon rig in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010.</p> <p>\"Our record throughout 50 years' experience of operating in Arctic and sub-Arctic regions demonstrates that we have the technical expertise to explore for and produce oil and gas safely and responsibly,\" said a Shell spokesman.</p> <p>Cairn Energy, which has been at the forefront of drilling off Greenland, said British MPs should not interfere. \"Cairn believes that governments and their people have the right to explore for natural resources in their sovereign territory, with the potential to strengthen both their energy security and economy,\" it added.</p> <p>But the Green party MP Caroline Lucas, another member of the EAC who has campaigned hard on the issue for many years, believes otherwise.</p> <p>She said: \"The UK government now has a responsibility to respond to this EAC report and show vital leadership on the issue by doing all it can to urgently secure a moratorium on Arctic drilling \u2013 starting with companies registered in this country.\"</p>",
  "<p>\u2022 The Conservative drift to the right won't mean that much, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/sep/18/tory-party-drifted-right-ken-clarke\" title=\"\">Ken Clarke said on Tuesday</a>. But most think it will, and nowhere more than in the matter of immigration. Out goes Damian Green \u2013 tough, but not tough enough. In comes an even tougher cookie, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/jul/06/mark-harper-faces-tricky-week\" title=\"\">Mark Harper</a>. He's no-nonsense. But he's not stupid. So when he arrived at his new post and came across the case of Crescent Tours, he was smart enough to deal with their immigration problem commendably quickly. Crescent's hopes of sponsoring overseas employees were dashed by the UK Border Agency. And there it might have rested, were it not for representations on the firm's behalf from the local MP Theresa May, aka the home secretary. Within five days of taking office, Harper wrote back apologising for the delay, blaming the firm for completing the relevant forms incorrectly but nevertheless offering them guidance for a future application and reimbursement of the \u00a3500 application fee. \"I apologise again for the delay in replying,\" scribbled Harper at the bottom of the letter to his colleague and superior, adding the name of an official who will sort out any future problems. Will all immigration matters get this sort of attention? You bet!</p> <p>\u2022 So a solid start for the new director general <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/george-entwistle\" title=\"\">George Entwistle</a>, and what a swell party at Broadcasting House for Mark Thompson, the DG just gone. Big names and big egos, fuelled by wine and canapes. The slickly made tribute film, featured Sir Terry Wogan who bemoaned the fact that Thompson had by his example encouraged other BBC execs to grow beards and \"look scruffy\": Cut straight to the bearded, perennially casual Alan Yentob whose words could not be heard above guffaws from mocking contemporaries. Poor Botney, most undeserved.</p> <p>\u2022 BBC execs earn less than they did, but for years they justified huge salaries by pointing to their true value in the commercial world. A fine example was deputy director general <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/organgrinder/2011/may/30/bbc-director-general-mark-byford\" title=\"\">Mark Byford</a> who left the corporation over a year ago with a reputed pay-off close to \u00a31m and a pension pot not far short of \u00a34m. He too was at Thommo's farewell with that distinctive bird's nest hairdo. Plainly wealth does not automatically yield a better barber. And after 16 months, has the commercial world lifted him into that private-sector post befitting of his former status? Er, not yet.</p> <p>\u2022 One absentee at the great goodbye was Kevin Marsh who led the corporation into mine-filled territory with the now famous Andrew Gilligan 2003 broadcast on the Blair government's \"<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2003/jul/09/Iraqandthemedia.bbc\" title=\"\">sexing up\" of the September 2002 dossier on Iraq and WMD</a>. The infamous row with Alastair Campbell followed, Hutton reported, the BBC was decapitated. Marsh now has his book Stumbling Over Truth to promote and as the BH party swung, he was doing just that. His book may make uncomfortable reading for both Campbell and Gilligan, and one wonders whether either will show up to ask the odd question when the publicity bandwagon stops at Westminster University on Monday? It could all could kick off quite quickly. In less than 45 minutes, apparently.</p> <p>\u2022 Finally gloves off between the troublesome Ukipian Godfrey Bloom, MEP for Yorkshire and North Lincolnshire, and the Trades Union Congress. He's hopping mad. The TUC is immovable. At issue, one man's reputation. During a radio debate, the TUC equality officer <a href=\"http://www.tuc.org.uk/the_tuc/about_sveale.cfm\" title=\"\">Sarah Veale</a> cast Godfrey as the man who said women should not work but should stay at home and clean behind the fridge. That's a lie, said Godfrey. Withdraw it. I won't, you said it on Women's Hour, said Veale. Hard to know who's right because we didn't hear the discussion. But from what we do know, the situation is this. Godders has never quite said women should not go out to work. What he has said, with varying degrees of seriousness, is that \"no self-respecting small businessman with a brain in the right place would ever employ a lady of childbearing age.\" That women don't \"clean behind the fridge enough\". And that he was sent to Brussels \"<a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/breakfast/3912385.stm\" title=\"\">to represent Yorkshire women who always have dinner on the table</a>\". The notion of Godfrey Bloom as even a teeny bit sexist is really pretty outrageous, isn't it?</p> <p><em> Twitter: </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/hugh_muir\" title=\"\"><em>@hugh_muir</em></a></p>",
  "<p>The US justice department's inspector general has cleared the attorney general, Eric Holder, of Republican accusations he had prior knowledge of a botched operation that shipped hundreds of weapons to Mexican drug cartels that were later used in killings.</p> <p>But a senior official resigned and another took retirement after they and others were strongly criticised in inspector general Michael Horowitz's <a href=\"http://www.justice.gov/oig/reports/2012/s1209.pdf\">report which lays out</a> a \"pattern of serious failures\" over the operation, called Fast and Furious. Agents lost about 2,000 guns, mostly AK-47s, in a failed attempt to track their route to drug cartels. </p> <p>The report, published on Wednesday, recommended disciplinary action against 14 officials, including the head of the justice department's criminal division, Assistant Attorney General Lanny Breuer \u00ba an Obama administration appointee.</p> <p>The secretive \"gun walking\" operation, run by the bureau of alcohol, tobacco and firearms (ATF) and US attorney's office in Arizona, drew attention in Washington when two of the weapons were linked to the killing of a US border patrol agent, Brian Terry, in a gun fight with drug traffickers two years ago. Hundreds of the guns also turned up at Mexican crime scenes.</p> <p>Republican in Congress have attempted to use criticism of Fast and Furious to unseat Holder on the grounds he has covered up his knowledge of the operation. The House of Representatives found him in contempt of Congress in June for failing to hand over documents &#xa0;to lengthy and often testy committee hearings \u2013 a first for a sitting member of a president's cabinet.</p> <p>The operation is also at the heart of conspiracy theories among some gun rights advocates of a plot to curb weapons sales. The National Rifle Association called Fast and Furious another \"Watergate\" and alleged that the Obama administration let the guns be shipped to Mexico in order to boost statistics on illegal weapons smuggling and introduce tighter gun control.</p> <p>But the 470-page justice department internal probe, which was partly redacted for public release, concluded that the \"gun walking\" operation was more incompetence than conspiracy, and dismissed Republican accusations that Holder knew of it beforehand.</p> <p>Holder greeted the report by saying it cleared his name and pointing the finger at his critics in Congress.</p> <p>\"It is unfortunate that some were so quick to make baseless accusations before they possessed the facts about these operations \u2013 accusations that turned out to be without foundation and that have caused a great deal of unnecessary harm and confusion,\" he said. \"I hope today's report acts as a reminder of the dangers of adopting as fact unsubstantiated conclusions before an investigation of the circumstances is completed.\"</p> <p>But Republican congressman Darrel Issa, who has led an increasingly bitter campaign against Holder with hearings in Congress, said Holder should take responsibility for the criticisms of the justice department over Fast and Furious.</p> <p>\"Contrary to the denials of the attorney general and his political defenders in Congress, the investigation found that information in wiretap applications approved by senior justice department officials in Washington did contain red flags showing reckless tactics and faults attorney general Eric Holder's inner circle for their conduct,\" he said. \"It's time for President Obama to step in and provide accountability for officials at both the department of justice and ATF who failed to do their jobs.|\"</p> <p>The inspector general was, however, sharply critical of the conduct of the operation and an earlier one, Wide Receiver, during George W Bush's presidency which involved about 400 guns.</p> <p>The report said that Fast and Furious began as an \"important and promising investigation\" of the flow of weapons from American gun shops <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/dec/08/us-guns-mexico-drug-cartels \">across the border to Mexican cartels</a> but quickly got out of hand resulting in the \"extraordinary\" situation of the US authorities spending more than a year watching gun smugglers buy nearly 2,000 firearms for $1.5m while doing nothing about it.</p> <p>\"There were&#xa0;no arrests or indictments in the case until it was learned that two weapons&#xa0;found at the scene of customs and border protection agent Brian Terry's December 14, 2010, murder had been purchased by an Operation Fast and Furious subject who agents had identified in November 2009, and who had bought the two guns found at scene in January 2010,\" the report said. </p> <p>\"We concluded that the individuals at ATF and the US attorney's office responsible for Operation Fast and Furious failed to conduct the investigation with the urgency, oversight, and attention to public safety that was required by an investigation that involved such extraordinary and consequential firearms trafficking activity.\"</p> <p>The report identified a number of problems including lack of sufficient oversight and inadequate attention to the dangers to the public which amounted to \"a disregard for the safety of individuals in the United States and Mexico\"; the inappropriate use of informants, some of whom were being tracked by another US agency because they were drug smuggling; and failure to take on board the international consequences of permitting guns to be smuggled to Mexico where they were used to murder people.</p> <p>The report recommends disciplinary action against several people in part because Fast and Furious was permitted to go ahead even though there had been deep concerns about a similar operation under the Bush administration, Wide Receiver.</p> <p>It criticises Breuer and one of his aides, Jason Weinstein, for failing to notify Holder and other senior justice department officials about the existence of Wide Receiver when Fast and Furious came under question.</p> <p>The report said Weinstein should have recognised that Fast and Furious replicated Wide Receiver and put a stop to it. Weinstein told Fox News that he resigned so as not to \"distract\" from the justice department's work but he disputed the report's finding, calling them deeply flawed.</p> <p>Breuer raised questions about Wide Receiver at the time but said he had no knowledge of Fast and Furious until it was already under way. He acknowledged that he should have done more to ensure that the earlier \"gun walking\" operation was not repeated.</p> <p>The report is also strongly critical of the head of the ATF, Kenneth Melson, who resigned last year over the investigation and moved to another justice department post. He retired on Wednesday, as the report was released. &#xa0;</p>",
  "<p>Picture it: US federal prosecutors and agents, deeply frustrated over an inability to stem violence related to the drug trade and Mexican cartels, decide to pursue a bold strategy to go after arms trafficking on the US-Mexican border.</p> <p>Under the plan, agents of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives will permit known gun traffickers to make \"straw purchases\" \u2013 legal purchases of firearms in significant quantities to be resold to criminals on the other side of the border. This sort of purchase-monitoring had been used before, but the existing law enforcement policy was to intercept the arms shipments shortly after purchase or transfer. Under the new approach, the guns will \"walk\" \u2013 into the hands of the cartel buyers, allowing investigators to identify how the firearms were being paid for and transported to Mexico \u2013 and set up major prosecutions of the cartels in the future.</p> <p>But the more significant busts never come. Instead, more than 2,000 firearms \u2013 mostly AK-47 style rifles and FN Herstal 5.7mm caliber pistols \u2013 flow across the border into the hands of the cartels. No arrests or indictments are made. The agents on the ground start complaining. The guns start showing up at crime scenes in Mexico. </p> <p>Only when gunman use the weapons to murder a federal law enforcement agent, US Customs and Border Protection Agent Brian Terry, does the program get shut down and arrests of the \"little fish\" suspects occur.</p> <p>If you read this scenario in a thriller novel, you would probably toss the book away halfway through, dismissing the agents' and prosecutors' foolishness on a grand scale as too implausible. But that is indeed what occurred in \"Operation Fast and Furious\", a deadly scandal of egregiously reckless judgment in federal law enforcement that has received far too little attention from the media in the United States.</p> <p>Since the story broke in early 2011, most of the parties involved, including US Attorney General Eric Holder and other department of justice (DOJ) officials, have reserved comment or offered few details, citing an ongoing investigation by the DOJ's office of inspector general (OIG). After 19 months, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/19/operation-fast-and-furious-report\">OIG completed and released its report</a>, recommended that the justice department take disciplinary action against 14 current and former officials from the department and ATF.</p> <p>The initial headlines <a href=\"http://openchannel.nbcnews.com/_news/2012/09/19/13966068-investigation-finds-no-evidence-ag-eric-holder-knew-of-fast-and-furious-gun-running-sting\">shouted that the IG report had exonerated Holder</a>. That's one interpretation. But the portrait the report paints of Holder's management is deeply disturbing. Time and again, information and warnings about the operation's enormous risks flow from Arizona to Washington \u2026 and suddenly, mysteriously, stop just short of Holder.</p> <p>The inspector general's report concludes that they can find no evidence Holder knew about Fast and Furious until well after Terry's death, but \u2026 well, the circumstances of Holder being so out of the loop, so in the dark about a major operation certainly appear unusual, perhaps to the point of straining credulity. The report states: </p> <blockquote> <p>\"We found it troubling that a case of this magnitude and that affected Mexico so significantly was not directly briefed to the Attorney General. We would usually expect such information to come to the Attorney General through the Office of the Deputy Attorney General \u2026 [Holder] was not told in December 2010 about the connection between the firearms found at the scene of the shooting and Operation Fast and Furious. Both Acting Deputy Attorney General Grindler and Counsel to the Attorney General and Deputy Chief of Staff Wilkinson were aware of this significant and troubling information by December 17, 2010, but did not believe the information was sufficiently important to alert the Attorney General about it or to make any further inquiry regarding this development.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Not \"sufficiently important\"? Baffling. Maddening. Some might even say, \"implausible\".</p> <p>Repeatedly, everyone under Holder seems to do everything possible to make sure he isn't informed about an operation that, in the words of the IG report, failed \"to adequately consider the risk to public safety in the United States and Mexico\". In fact, information about the program went all the way to Holder's office \u2013 but somehow, the memos, emails and other communications never reached the man himself. It's as if he wasn't there. From the IOG report, again:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"As we describe below, we identified information regarding Operation Fast and Furious that reached the Office of the Attorney General in 2010 but not Attorney General Holder himself.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Well. If you're wondering if this is covered by some sort of obscure procedure or rules, it isn't:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"[Holder] should have been informed by no later than December 17, 2010, that two firearms recovered at the Terry murder scene were linked to an ATF firearms trafficking investigation \u2026 We found that although [Holder's then deputy-chief-of-staff Monty] Wilkinson forwarded to Holder during the afternoon of December 15 three emails from the US Attorney's Office providing further details about the shooting and law enforcement efforts to find and arrest the suspects, he did not notify the Attorney General of the revelation that two weapons found at the murder scene were linked to a suspect in an ATF firearms trafficking investigation.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>A suspicious mind could look at this strange pattern of underling, after deputy, after staffer <em>not</em> mentioning critical information, and information getting all the way to Holder's office but not being seen by the AG himself, and conclude Holder's staffers were keeping him in the dark. Would that be to preserve his \"plausible deniability\"? Another conclusion might be that someone just wasn't honest with the inspector general.</p> <p>We now know that the best that can be said about Holder is that he was oblivious to a major, exceptionally dangerous operation going on within his organization. And the most generous interpretation of that is that he had staffed his office with professionals who had epically flawed judgment in deciding what the nation's top law-enforcement officer needed to know.</p> <p>There are still some big questions that remain \u2013 including whether this should stand as the final investigation of the subject; and whether it is appropriate for a government official assigned to sniff out mismanagement, corruption, and cover-ups to be reporting to the exact officials he's investigating.</p> <p>A serious question for partisans of the left is whether they would accept a Bush or Romney administration's justice department investigating itself \u2013 particularly <em>after</em> the president chose to assert executive privilege over documents that Congress believes relate to the operation. Senator Jon Cornyn (Republican, Texas) asked:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"Today's report contains page after page of redacted information and does not reflect well on an administration that pledged to be the most transparent in US history. I ask the attorney general to set aside his political allegiances and answer this simple question: don't you think the Terry family and the American people deserves answers?\"</p> </blockquote>",
  "<p>The UK Independence party could poach enough Tory donors disgruntled with David Cameron's leadership to help it win the 2014 European elections, according to the Ukip leader.</p> <p>Nigel Farage described former supporters of Cameron in the City as \"pretty bloody angry\" with coalition policy, saying his party was close to securing funding to help it gain a lead in the European elections.</p> <p>In an interview with the Guardian before this week's party conference in Birmingham, Farage, the 48-year-old former commodities dealer who has been Ukip leader twice since 2006, said: \"We are doing OK, but we haven't got the money to compete with the big boys properly. We are that far from raising real money. We are not there yet, but we are very, very close to putting Ukip on to a different level of funding.</p> <p>\"Since David Cameron became leader in 2005, 60% of the money his party has raised came from the City. He has now betrayed the City when in November 2010 his government transferred authority from the City to three new [European] regulatory authorities. The City is pretty bloody angry about it.\"</p> <p>He admits that Ukip's organisation was \"totally shambolic for years and years\" and that it still lacks the funds needed to end its \"country cousin\" status as just another minor party.</p> <p>But buoyed by a midsummer opinion poll that reported a 12% poll share for Ukip \u2013 ahead of the Liberal Democrats on 10% \u2014 Farage, who is an MEP, also hints that a low turnout could even help Ukip's candidate succeed Louise Mensch as MP for Corby in the 15 November byelection. He dismisses most Westminster politicians as mere careerists \u2013 voters don't respect them and they don't respect voters \u2013 but concedes an admiration for Michael Gove and Iain Duncan Smith, whom he regards as honest ministers trying to make a difference. Boris Johnson is \"good fun\". Perhaps he is the Tory leader with whom Ukip could realign the right after 2015, Farage hints.</p> <p>How does he square the success of Team GB at the Olympics with Ukip's hostility to multiculturalism? Easily, replies Farage. The Olympics were brilliant. \"Isn't it exciting, Mr Farage?\" one old lady told him in Kent.</p> <p>As far as Farage is concerned Mo Farah, for example, is British to the core. \"No one is more opposed to multiculturalism than Mo Farah. He's a uniculturalist who says: Listen mate, when I put on that GB shirt I'm proud, very proud.\" Ukip will be after Mo's vote when the time comes, Farage says.</p> <p>A self-styled libertarian and persistent smoker whose conversation is punctuated with boisterous laughter, Farage says: \"I'm very optimistic, I'm very bullish \u2013 always.\" Even after he was injured when his campaign's light aircraft crashed during his 2010 attempt to unseat the Commons Speaker, John Bercow, he bounced back. He resumed the leadership he had briefly passed on to the hapless Lord Pearson despite lingering back trouble.</p> <p>\"I have a clear view up to June 2014 \u2026 to win the [five-yearly] European elections in terms of both votes and seats,\" he says. In the 2009 campaign for the Strasbourg parliament Ukip came second with 2.5 million votes and a 16.5% voter share against Labour's 15.7% (both got 13 seats to the Tories' 26). But, as in previous general elections, Ukip's protest vote fell back sharply \u2013 to 3.1% of the vote against 2.3% in 2005 \u2013 when Cameron entered No 10 two years ago. Farage quit the Tory party after the signing of the Maastricht treaty under John Major in 1992, shortly before he was given the push by the French bank, Credit Lyonnaise, for what he calls unspecified \"insubordination\".</p> <p>He concedes that the British economic recovery, taxes (Ukip favours a flat 31% rate of income tax), red tape and immigration are far higher up voters' priorities than Europe. But gradually \"ordinary decent folk\" have come to realise how much Europe-made law affects their daily lives. That is why libertarians, disaffected shire Tories, \"classical Liberals\" and old Labour voters, frustrated small businessmen and big ones scared of Brussels regulation of the City, are coming across, he says.</p> <p>Farage left Dulwich College at 18 and went straight into the City, not to university. \"I wanted to be a yuppie,\" he recalls and feared he would be too old by 22. He laughs at his youthful excesses in the greedy 80s \u2013 \"totally irresponsible, but it was great fun\". Nowadays a more sombre Farage (he was made a freeman of the City of London in February) favours separating retail and investment banking to prevent another 2008-style crash, while stopping Brussels wrecking what the City still does best, such as insurance.</p> <p>Few party activists seem to dispute his ascendancy over Ukip. But it comes at a price, not just lost earnings (\"no one in British politics has sacrificed as much as I have\") but in widespread resentment in the ranks. When Farage recently floated the idea of dropping Ukip's \u00a3 sign logo he was again accused of high-handed conduct. It's being reviewed, no final decision has been taken, he says.</p> <p>As for accusations that, for all Ukip's attacks on the EU gravy train, the party's MEPs are a byword for wine, women and song, for laziness and supercharged expenses in Brussels and Strasbourg, they produce the only hint of quick temper in an otherwise affable interview. But he quickly admits that some people used Ukip's lax selection process to get to Brussels, then \"letting us down\".</p> <p>To raise the quality of candidates a rule change bans anyone who has been a member of a proscribed organisation such as the BNP (\"we don't want you\") and final candidate lists are drawn up by Ukip's national executive. Just like the major parties, in fact. \"Am I domineering personally, am I intolerant of others? No, I don't think I am.\"</p> <p>He is aware that Ukip is widely seen as a one-tune party and is trying to broaden its policies and appeal. Britain's windfarm policy transfers money from poor to rich, so the Earl of Glasgow gets \u00a3250,000 a year in rent alone, Farage says. \"We can't blame Europe for everything, we'd look obsessive otherwise,\" he adds with a chuckle.</p>",
  "<p>One in five people living in Germany now comes from an immigrant background, according to figures released on Thursday. They show that the minority community grew by more than 1.3% last year at a time when the overall population is falling.</p> <p>Figures from the German Federal Statistical Office show that the number of people with immigrant backgrounds living in Germany increased by 216,000 from 2010 to 2011. Multiculturalism has been a fiercely controversial topic in Germany in recent years, engendering vigorous debate over the integration of immigrants, many of whom moved to the country in the 1960s as guest workers from Turkey. There are now 16 million people with an immigrant background living in Germany \u2013 19.5% of the country's population.</p> <p>Although Germans have discovered a greater affinity with their minority communities thanks to the exploits of football stars such as Mesut \u00d6zil and Sami Khedira, there have been a growing number of voices challenging the value of multiculturalism. This week, the mayor of Berlin district Neuk\u00f6lln, Heinz Buschkowsky, argues in a new book that multiculturalism has failed.</p> <p>There is some evidence that the most recent rise in immigration has been caused by economic refugees from southern European countries as a result of the euro crisis. But the debate habitually falls back to the integration of the Turkish community, which represents the highest number of immigrants in Europe's biggest economy.</p> <p>\"Many politicians and policymakers see integration politics as a way to create a homogenised society rather than encouraging equal political and social participation for everyone in Germany \u2013 integration is well-intentioned but ill-implemented,\" said G\u00f6k\u00e7e Yurdakul, a social scientist specialising in diversity and social conflicts at Humboldt University in Berlin.</p> <p>The issue has driven a wedge between Germany and Turkey in recent years, most notably when Christian Wulff, the then German president, was told by his Turkish counterpart, Abdullah G\u00fcl, that Germany should be doing more to help Turks integrate into German culture. This followed claims by the German chancellor Angela Merkel that multiculturalism had failed.</p> <p>Some experts disagree, saying integration is already happening at a local level. \"You can see that integration is happening through local initiatives and civil society organisations putting efforts into living together in a diverse society,\" said Yurdakul. However, the efforts were not reflected on a national level and politicians still had a long way to go.</p> <p>\"[These] policies are trying to get people equal access to labour markets, politics, education and healthcare, but on the other hand it's ill-implemented because it's used to restrict immigration in Germany.\"</p> <p>Then there are those held up as successes of integration such as \u00d6zil, who is descended from Turkish immigrants and considered a national hero.</p> <p>Younger people are starting to make an effort to reach out to the Turkish communities to integrate themselves with their neighbours. Marlene Schliepach, 26, is studying to become a kindergarten teacher and started learning Turkish two years ago in an effort to be able to talk to the children she will be caring for.</p> <p>\"I'm learning Turkish because I want to convey to my Turkish students that I, as their teacher, and as a German, value their language,\" she said. \"Lots of teachers want to make them focus on only learning German. But integration has to go both ways.\"</p> <p>Some, such as Tim Panhorst, 27, are learning Turkish because of family connections to the culture, but think it is important for Germans to attempt to reach out. \"I wasn't really learning it from school, but from friends and relatives because my brother is married to a Turkish girl,\" he said.</p> <p>\"But when I meet Turkish people and speak to them in the language, my experience is that they are always glad someone German can. It's always a way of connecting, and in a positive way.\"</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 20th September 2012 to correct the figure of 1.3% relating to community growth in the first paragraph.

  "<p>God bless America. Or, if you are Mitt Romney, only half of it. Satan can have the other half, for in Mormon teaching he is the brother of Jesus. What else can explain this <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/sep/18/mitt-romney-47-unsuitable-president\" title=\"\">parasitic 47% of which Romney speaks</a>? The people who see themselves as victims for whom the government is responsible. The losers who believe \"they are entitled to healthcare, to food, to housing, to you name it\".</p> <p>Christ almighty! What in the richest country are these people thinking? They shouldn't even have a vote, say the rightwing outliers, reversing a founding American principle, \"No taxation without representation\".</p> <p>Romney is talking about federal income tax, and the non-partisan Tax Policy Centre showed that last year 46.6% of American households did not pay it. However \u2013 and this is a big however \u2013 two-thirds of them paid a combination of tax through their payroll, state, property and gas taxes. Tax breaks for the elderly, the working poor and an exemption for combat pay have been fairly uncontroversial.</p> <p>The driving down of wages has meant that tax is used, in the words of Iain Duncan Smith, to \"make work pay\". It also subsidises childbearing, which the Republicans insist keeps down immigration.</p> <p>Romney is a hopelessly rich, but oddly passive-aggressive politician. It is difficult for David Cameron's Tory government to align itself with this man, who has the charisma of a stained trouser press. Who wouldn't prefer the Obama Grooverama?</p> <p>But they are, indeed, politically much more aligned with Romney and the truth is out there. It's there in the need to shift all talk of public responsibility to private responsibility. It's there in the dismissal of their own privilege, their inherited wealth and private education. Romney, at the same dinner at which he spoke of the 47%, talked of how he would be more electable if he were Mexican.</p> <p>While he is obviously a dud, his core beliefs are significant in Britain because they are not far from how policy is being conceptualised. We too have the wealth-makers versus takers narrative. The takers \u2013 and this is always preceded with some guff about the truly vulnerable \u2013 are wasters and shirkers. They say they are poor, but blow their benefits on flat-screen TVs. The wealth-makers remain more mysterious. Are they bankers? Is it just Richard Branson? Or are they the small entrepreneurs who can only aspire to the greed of the Dragons in the ludicrous Dragons' Den? Does wealth creation mean purely profit? What of the third sector?</p> <p>Any political party worth its salt needs to disrupt this narrative and soon. If we are to be divided into makers and takers, Romney-style, then, of course, the benefit freeze of \"the takers\" \u2013 the cutting of the link between benefits and inflation \u2013 is just fine and dandy.</p> <p>But who exactly are the shirkers? Those who take without paying tax. Toddlers born into poverty. People who are very ill. Old people who can no longer work. Young people who cannot find employment. Yes, they are real people, but the Tories are using the recession to implement policies that are way closer to crazed Republican thinking than they would like spelled out. They are punitively and knowingly trying to refigure the relationship between voters and the state. Those on benefits are not considered Tory voters, but support for cuts to benefits comes when people feel they also have no relationship to welfare, that they never \"take\" while others do.</p> <p>This is why child benefit becomes totemic \u2013 the only \"benefit\" people feel they get. Don't mention the war, roads or hospitals. If the takers can be defined as \"other\", popular support for this agenda continues. Those who push through these changes (politicians) and those who discuss them (the media) live mostly in a world of private provision of schools and healthcare, where the view that the poor are leeches with no sense of responsibility becomes acceptable.</p> <p>The alternative to this \u2013 Miliband's vague musings on predatory capitalism was an attempt, I suppose \u2013 is to move the issue of responsibility into the heart of the debate. It is also to ask fundamentally what wealth is for. Even cheerleaders for business are talking about responsibility and relationships. They see in the crash the failings of crony capitalism and want something much more pro-market rather than pro-business, so an economist such as Luigi Zingales suggests structural reforms to break up these elites. The issue is that Romney represents these elites, as does our current cabinet.</p> <p>So wealth creation is spoken about with no model of innovation, just more fetishisation of the past. Suddenly we are back to O-levels. Are businesses asking for rote-learning and regurgitation? No, they are asking for literacy, science, data analysis, Mandarin and creativity. It already seems a long time since Danny Boyle reminded us that we are quite good at some things, that the relationship of the taxpayer to the state is not only represented by \"shirkers\" but by nurses.</p> <p>Talking of takers, the Tories have no mandate, and as voting turnout decreases, they are unlikely to get one. It's the same across the pond. As a Republican senator told the Washington Post: \"We are not generating enough angry white guys to stay in business for the long term.\" The Tories need to grasp this, for while they may gasp at Romney's \"gaffe\", they do so because they see it as a failure of strategy \u2013 not of morality.</p>",

According to Nsidc, the warming of Arctic areas is now increasing at around 10% a decade.</p> <p>Along with the extent of the sea ice, its thickness, or volume, has also significantly decreased in the last two decades. While this is harder to measure accurately, it is believed to have decreased around 40% since 1979.</p> <p>The collapse of the ice cap was last night interpreted by environment groups as a signal of long-term climate warming caused by man.</p> <p>\"I hope that future generations will mark this day as a turning point, when a new spirit of global cooperation emerged to tackle the huge challenges we face. We must work together to protect the Arctic from the effects of climate change and unchecked corporate greed. This is now the defining environmental battle of our era,\" said Kumi Naidoo, director of Greenpeace International.</p> <p>Other groups called on the UK government, and industries across the world to heed the warning signs from the Arctic and act \"with urgency and ambition\" to tackle climate change.</p> <p>Rod Downie, polar expert at WWF-UK said: \"With the speed of change we are now witnessing in the Arctic, the UK government must show national and global leadership in the urgent transition away from fossil fuels to a low carbon economy.</p> <p>\"This is further evidence that Shell's pursuit of hydrocarbons in the Arctic is reckless. It is completely irresponsible to drill for oil in such a fragile environment; there are simply too many unmanageable risks.\"</p> <p>Author and environmental campaigner Bill McKibben said: \"Our response [so far] has not been alarm, or panic, or a sense of emergency. It has been: 'Let's go up there and drill for oil'.

  "<p>Meeting my new class of year 5s last week, I was delighted to see that the <a href=\"http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/\">Guinness Book of Records</a> is as popular as ever. It's a few years now since my name was in there, but the children still love to look me up and talk about what I did, which gives me the perfect opportunity to excite them about their own memory skills. I'll show them a party trick or two, but what I really love is revealing the secrets, and showing the children how they can do some amazing things themselves.</p> <p>I was 16 when I first came across memory techniques; ancient skills and systems for making it easier to learn and remember. They'd been around for centuries and used by some of history's great thinkers and achievers, but for some reason no-one had ever told me about them. Approaching my GCSEs, I was being given plenty of information to learn, but no real strategies for doing so, until I stumbled on a few of my own, looking for a way to memorise playing cards and win a bet with some friends. I quickly realised that what I'd found was actually an approach to learning that worked for anything at all. Almost overnight it changed my whole experience of school.</p> <p>It was like getting superhero powers: I was Memo-Man. I could learn words, numbers, facts, lists, names, ideas, essays, skills. All because I knew a few simple tricks of the mind \u2013 and I was determined enough to put them into action. </p> <p>By the time I'd mastered cards, broken a world record (a sequence of 312 cards initially, six packs, but I would go on to memorise 40 packs of cards) and won my bet, I also had a set of skills that proved priceless throughout school, college and university. I could take a really strategic approach to everything I wanted to remember, saving myself time and energy, going into exams with new-found confidence, and pushing myself to discover, understand and remember more and more. </p> <p>The best memory techniques are simple but remarkably powerful. They use mental imagery to turn forgettable information into something that's much more likely to stick in your mind. You invent pictures to represent the things you want to know, funny, colourful, energetic images that catch hold in your memory, then connect them together into scenes and stories that are intrinsically memorable. You're using all the creative aspects of your thinking at the same time as your powers of logical organisation: wild imagination on one hand, but also controlled, solid structure on the other. Your whole brain comes to life in a learning experience that's fun and challenging \u2013 and it really works, from the first time you show a class how to memorise a list of random words.</p> <p>You have fun together coming up with a collection of objects, places, celebrities, TV shows. Then get them started on a vivid story that links all the items in a memorable way. Maybe the football bounces onto an ice-cream cone being held by Mickey Mouse, which splats onto the shoe of a passing astronaut whose helmet is actually a TV screen showing a programme about clowns. Suddenly they can all remember football, ice-cream, Mickey Mouse, shoe, astronaut, TV, clown and any list you give them. Words transformed into a story that links the first word to the second, the second to the third, through 20 words, 30, 50, forwards, backwards, inside out. I love seeing their excitement at doing something they thought would be impossible and enjoying doing it, thinking up their own funny imagery and challenging each other to remember more.</p> <p>You quickly show them how to learn useful lists: facts and ideas from across the curriculum, organised as memorable imagery in scenes and stories or even arranged around familiar buildings and journeys. It's how the Ancient Greeks used to learn, and it's an approach that still works brilliantly today. I've seen the impact of this energetic, whole-brain approach on children's overall attitude, focus, communication, imagination, organisation and it seems such an obvious skill to weave into every child's education. Get them into the right habits early and these memory methods could have a major influence on their future success.</p> <p>As teachers we can always be on the lookout for ways to use memorable images and connections. As well as showing the children actual pictures and films, why not help them to form their own personal images to represent the things they need to know; vocabulary, equations, dates, names, processes \u2013 even simple instructions? It's how memory works and how even very young children can make their memory work. </p> <p>Teach students practical memory methods. Encourage them to make their own connections and follow memory chains. Challenge them to invent their own systems for the things they really want to recall. Get them using the power of their imagination, utilising all their senses, putting themselves into unforgettable adventures and journeys of the mind \u2013 and seeing just how powerful their creative, controlled, confident memory can be. </p> <p><em>Jonathan Hancock was still at school when he broke his first Guinness world record \u2013 for memorising playing cards. He used the same memory skills to help him gain a first from Oxford University and become the inaugural World Student Memory Champion before achieving the title of World Memory Champion.

  "<p>This was taken in <a href=\"http://www.blueplanetbiomes.org/sonoran_desert.htm\" title=\"\">Mexico's Sonoran desert</a> in 1979. I was working on a series about the <a href=\"http://www.sil.org/mexico/seri/A003i-People-sei.htm\" title=\"\">Mexican Seri people</a> for the ethnographic archive of the <a href=\"http://www.cdi.gob.mx/\" title=\"\">National Indigenous Institute</a>. I was in&nbsp;Punta Chueca, near the border with Arizona, for a month and a half. At the time, there were only 500 people in the&nbsp;community, and since there were so few, I had to have their agreement when it came to taking portraits. It was difficult to start with, but we soon got to know each other.</p> <p>The Seris are former nomads. For me, this photograph represents the transition between their traditional way of&nbsp;life, and the way capitalism has&nbsp;changed it. For example, they&nbsp;were&nbsp;building their houses from bricks&nbsp;rather than sticks. I liked the fact&nbsp;that they were autonomous and hadn't lost&nbsp;their traditions, but had&nbsp;taken what they needed from American culture. They believed that money promoted inequalities and individualism, and did&nbsp;not want to&nbsp;become a divided society.</p> <p>On the day of this particular image, I&nbsp;went with a group to a cave where there are indigenous paintings. I took just one picture of this woman during the walk there. I call her Mujer \u00c1ngel [Angel Woman], because she looks&nbsp;as&nbsp;if&nbsp;she could fly off into&nbsp;the desert. She was carrying a tape&nbsp;recorder, which the Seris got from the Americans, in exchange for handicrafts such as baskets and carvings,&nbsp;so they could listen to Mexican music.</p> <p>When I got back&nbsp;from Punta&nbsp;Chueca, I&nbsp;developed my films and went through the contact sheets, but I didn't notice this photograph. Then my editor visited me and asked about it. I didn't remember taking it, which isn't something that normally happens to me: I always know what I have taken. That's what makes it my favourite photograph: a present from the desert that surprised me.</p> <p>I went back to Punta Chueca to put&nbsp;on <a href=\"http://www.rosegallery.net/index.php#mi=2&amp;pt=1&amp;pi=10000&amp;s=0&amp;p=0&amp;a=24&amp;at=2\" title=\"\">an exhibition of the series</a>. The Seris&nbsp;were not impressed because the photographs are black and white, and they were used to being photographed by Americans with Polaroids. But in the end they did take their own portraits home, so they must have liked them</p> <h2>CV</h2> <p><strong>Born: </strong>Mexico City, 1942.</p> <p><strong>Studied:</strong> National University of Mexico's Film School.</p> <p><strong>Influences: </strong><a href=\"http://www.magnumphotos.com/C.aspx?VP=XSpecific_MAG.PhotographerDetail_VPage&amp;l1=0&amp;pid=2K7O3R135R3G&amp;nm=Josef%20Koudelka\" title=\"\">Josef Koudelka</a>, <a href=\"http://suite101.com/article/lola-alvarez-bravo-a61479\" title=\"\">Lola \u00c1lvarez Bravo</a>, <a href=\"http://diane-arbus-photography.com/\" title=\"\">Diane Arbus</a>, <a href=\"http://www.stromholm.com/\" title=\"\">Christer Str\u00f6mholm</a>.</p> <p><strong>High point: </strong>\"Working every day and hoping to take better photographs.\"</p> <p><strong>Low point: </strong>\"There hasn't been one.

  "<p>A spate of speculation helped a nervous market end the day on a positive note, despite continuing worries about the eurozone crisis.</p> <p>Reheated takeover talk sent shares in British Gas owner <strong>Centrica</strong> higher with an unusually large volume of shares traded. Gazprom has been tipped in the past as a possible predator, and the Russian energy group's name was back in the frame again, although political considerations would surely play a role here. An alternative story concerned interest from Qatar. The country signed a liquefied natural gas deal last year, which prompted <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/marketforceslive/2011/may/11/centrica-up-on-vague-bid-talk?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">some analysts to suggest its sovereign wealth fund could end up taking a stake in Centrica to cement their links</a>.</p> <p>All that was enough to help push the group's shares up 1.8p to 335.5p with more than 40m shares traded, well above normal volumes.</p> <p>Meanwhile <strong>United Utilities</strong> continued to be buoyed by bid rumours ahead of a trading update on Thursday. There was some scepticism in the City, but analysts at Bank of America/Merrill Lynch took a less negative view on the tale, saying an offer at around 900p-950p was plausible:</p> <blockquote> We believe a bid from a consortium seems more feasible than a bid from a single fund due to United Utilities' large size, and the names mentioned look plausible to us given infrastructure appetite. <br>In our opinion, the low bond yield and high inflation environment remains a key support for regulated inflation-linked assets like UK water.  We also expect M&amp;A momentum could support <strong>Severn Trent </strong>and <strong>Pennon </strong>although we believe Pennon is a less likely M&amp;A candidate due to its non-regulated waste activities. <br> </blockquote> <p>United closed 19.5p higher at 727p, Severn added 4p to \u00a317.12 while Pennon put on 5.5p to 745p.</p> <p>Overall the <strong>FTSE 100</strong> finished 20.32 points higher at 5888.48 after two days of falls, as Japan became the latest central bank to introduce stimulus measures. But there was still nervousness around Greece, which has yet to agree budget cuts demanded under the terms of its latest bailout, and Spain, where it is still unclear whether the government will ask for financial help.</p> <p><strong>Aviva</strong>, downgraded on Tuesday by Deutsche Bank and Bank of America/Merrill Lynch, fell another 11.5p to 333.4p as its shares went ex-dividend.</p> <p>Among the banks <strong>Barclays</strong> lost 0.25p to 225.15p after the Financial Services Authority released memos relating to the appointment of Bob Diamond as chief executive. But <strong>HSBC</strong> was 9.9p higher at 587.8p after a recommendation from analysts at, yes, Barclays.</p> <p><strong>BP</strong> rose 4.8p to 443.75p after reports it has been in talks to sell its Texas City refinery to Marathon Petroleum. The sale could fetch up to $2.5bn, and is part of BP's disposal programme to help cover the costs of the Gulf of Mexico disaster.</p> <p><strong>AstraZeneca</strong> added 54.5p to \u00a329.59 as Exane BNP Paribas moved from underperform to neutral in the wake of recent management changes. Analyst Nicolas Guyon-Gellin said:</p> <blockquote> We see an intensification of value-enhancing bolt-ons to replenish the research and development pipeline (up to $14bn with potential targets like Amarin, Biomarin, Forest or Actelion) and to leverage untapped emerging market opportunities (expansion outside China). We view any larger deal (Shire or AbbVie) as unlikely and doubt a \"run for cash\" scenario. <br> After having been the worst large cap performer over 12 months ( down 9% relative) and in view of new management we see a turning point; the usual valuation metrics (30% PE discount and 7% dividend yield) should provide clear support. Yet much needs to be done (R&amp;D productivity, emerging markets) to fix long term growth uncertainties before we can turn more positive - we are still 3%-9% below long term consensus earnings per share. </blockquote> <p><strong>Sage</strong> rose 2.1p to 318.3p on talk the accountancy software group could be looking to sell its US operations. The company has recently been the subject of takeover speculation.</p> <p><strong>Smiths Group</strong>, the technology business whose products range from bomb detectors to medical equipment, ended up 12p at \u00a310.54, after a 7% rise in full year profits.</p> <p><strong>Ashmore</strong>, the emerging markets fund management group, had been under pressure recently after a dip in full year profits, and is set to leave the FTSE 100 at the end of this week. But Morgan Stanley began coverage of the company with an overweight rating and 390p price target, helped push its shares up 3.5p to 338.5p. The bank said:</p> <blockquote> Concerns over fund performance, pressures on margins, equity and multi strategy are priced in. With our earnings 5% ahead of consensus we believe Ashmore offers attractive risk/reward with size of opportunity still underappreciated. We expect acceleration in growth to drive 18% earnings per share compound annual growth rate and re-rating. </blockquote> <p>Among the mid-caps, recruitment group <strong>Michael Page International</strong> slipped 1p to 389p after a sell note from Seymour Pierce, which pointed to a downbeat statement from Swiss rival Adecco. Analyst Kevin Lapwood said:</p> <blockquote> The Adecco trading update ahead of today's investor day indicates that there has been little improvement in European staffing markets. This is consistent with data from other sources and leads us to reiterate our negative stance. We note that Michael Page has enjoyed a good bounce in recent weeks which we believe is premature. France accounts for 17% of net fee income at Michael Page. The shares are expensive, trading on a prospective PE of 24.5 times compared with a staffing peer group average of 16.5 times. </blockquote> <p>Lower down the market <strong>Hibu</strong>, the ridiculous new name for Yellow Pages group Yell, dropped 35% to 0.44p after it warned again on profits and repeated that its restructuring discussions could lead to an outcome where its ordinary shares had no value.</p> <p>In a similar boat were shareholders in <strong>AEA Technology</strong>, down 33% to 0.06p. The environmental advisor said it was in talks with a number of parties, but that none of these were likely to lead to an offer for the company, meaning there will be little or no value for shareholders. It suffered a shareholder rebellion at its annual meeting over its remuneration report, surely too little too late as a protest?</p>",
  "<p>When Kanye West tweeted a couple of weeks ago about<a href=\"https://twitter.com/kanyewest/status/242315487554453504\" title=\"\"> the use of the word \"bitch\" </a>in hip-hop, he joined a debate almost as old as the genre itself. \"I usually never tweet questions but I struggle with this so here goes,\" he asked. \"Is the word BITCH acceptable?\"</p> <p>For most, the answer was simply \"no\" \u2013 and yet his tweet highlighted hip-hop's use of the word.

On songs such as<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=To5bUpOEHcw\" title=\"\"> A Bitch Iz a Bitch</a> (NWA),<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QczzKqzuHfw\" title=\"\"> Sophisticated Bitch</a> (Public Enemy) and <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEhRM-JmXSk\" title=\"\">Bitches 2</a> (Ice T), women were portrayed as \"hoes and tricks\"; gossipy, money obsessed and fake.</p> <p>Its meaning later broadened with Jay-Z perhaps defining it by everything it was not. On 2002's Bitches &amp; Sisters (which samples NWA), he contrasts hard-working, supportive \"sisters\" with their uptight, game-playing counterparts who \"only fuck with actors\". While on 1996's <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgvMpm9z0TI\" title=\"\">Wonda Why They Call U Bitch</a>, 2Pac lays out the reasons for for using that term to describe a woman (trading her dreams for one-night stands) \u2013 but there is no condoning those who use theword.</p> <p>The term is often used by the likes of Eminem and Odd Future, who are happy to play along with the image of rap as violent, deplorable and prejudiced, and yet are equally attached to its comical, persona-playing elements. So much so that their use of the word can be interpreted as an uneasy parody of the sharper end of the genre. Still, it's a dangerous game these artists are playing. Ironic or not, they are just reiterating the acceptability of the word.</p> <p>Around the same time, female MCs were making strides towards reappropriating the word. At the height of their success, Lil Kim described herself and Missy Elliott as \"real motherfuckin' bitches\" (on <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74J9viVHy3M\" title=\"\">Checkin' for You</a> on 1999's Da Real World), while a year later she proclaimed herself <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mx6G2zfWDHc\" title=\"\">Queen Bitch</a>. Missy Elliott wrote <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opkRF3UZSJw\" title=\"\">She's a Bitch</a> after working with Whitney Houston, whose take-charge attitude inspired the song and saw the word being spun into a term of empowerment.</p> <p>In 2010, Nicki Minaj's scene-stealing turn on <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UF-tpezd8x4\" title=\"\">Monster</a>, from My Beautiful Twisted Dark Fantasy, saw her taking the spotlight from Kanye and Jay-Z in a verse that had her proclaiming herself as a \"bad bitch that came from Sri Lanka\", while last year Azealia Banks's all conquering <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdiggyoQhoc\" title=\"\">212</a> saw her cockily label herself as a \"rude bitch\". In this context, the word denotes female rappers demonstrating their dominance in a male world.</p> <p>If the use of \"bitch\" has changed in hip-hop, maybe the genre is ready to completely reassess its use of the word. Is \"bitch\" actually necessary or just a lazy signifier? If Kanye wanted to bring real change he would have stopped using the word, but Big Sean's verse on his new single <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOrLNHbEzMg\" title=\"\">Clique</a> suggests we'll have to wait a bit longer for that to happen. Perhaps it's more realistic to hope his questioning tweet will make others think before they flow.</p>",
  "<p>It has been a summer full of reports of extreme weather, of unparalleled scope and severity. Among the highlights: <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jul/09/heatwave-easing-us-temperatures-normal\" title=\"\">one of the warmest years on record in the US</a>, record-high temperatures in central and eastern Europe, the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/aug/30/rain-chaos-summer-wettest-years?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">wettest summer in the UK</a>, the heaviest rainfalls in northern India and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2012/aug/07/manila-severe-flooding-torrential-flooding\" title=\"\">the Philippines</a> and the most <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/jul/13/drought-declaration-natural-disaster-states\" title=\"\">severe droughts in the US</a> and east Africa.</p> <p>In short, climate change and weather extremes are not about a distant future. Formerly one-off extreme weather episodes seem to be <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2012/aug/08/extreme-weather-video\" title=\"\">becoming the new normal</a>. Weather extremes are not that extreme any more. Heatwaves, floods, droughts and wildfires are the new reality of an ever warming world.</p> <p>And this should not come as a surprise. Scientists have been warning for years that as the planet heats up, we will have to deal with more severe, more changeable, more unpredictable weather. The evidence is mounting that human-caused warming is pushing normal warming effects to extremes. Heatwaves have increased in duration and frequency. Some parts of Europe are now gripped by severe water shortages while other parts have suffered extreme precipitations causing floods and increased crop losses.</p> <p>And although not every extreme weather event can be attributed to climate change, scientists are now much more confident about linking individual weather events to climate change. Take <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2011/dec/30/2011-second-warmest-year-december?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">2011's record warm November</a> in the UK, the second hottest on record. Researchers say that it was at least 60 times more likely to happen because of climate change than because of natural variations in the earth's weather systems.</p> <p>This summer continued the pattern. The retreat of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/sep/14/arctic-sea-ice-smallest-extent?intcmp=239\" title=\"\">sea ice in the Arctic smashed the previous record</a>, with just half the ice present compared to when satellite measurement began in 1979. Or take another example: <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/jul/24/greenland-ice-sheet-thaw-nasa\" title=\"\">Greenland's July thaw</a>, where satellite data showed that about 97% of the massive ice sheet surface covering the island was melting. \"Was this real or was it due to a data error?\" a Nasa scientist questioned. Unfortunately, the data was correct.</p> <p>All this record-breaking news reveals that global climate breakdown is occurring more rapidly than most climate scientists had expected. Climate change is happening, and it exacerbates a whole range of other global problems, adding further instability in an already unstable world.</p> <p>But isn't it too costly to invest in a low-carbon world, some may ask? Well, yes it costs. But so does business-as-usual. It would be wrong to believe that to continue business-as-usual is the cheap option. It is not. On the contrary, it is very expensive. Just one example: the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2012/aug/30/world-bank-global-hunger-warning-drought\" title=\"\">World Bank issued a global hunger warning</a> recently after severe droughts in the US, Russia and the Ukraine sent food prices to a record high. According to the World Bank, prices for maize and sorghum increased by 113% and 200% respectively in some markets in Mozambique and in Sudan. This is the kind of cost that often gets ignored.</p> <p>Businesses don't need to be told about the financial losses caused by weather extremes. This summer's drought in the US devastated the multibillion-dollar corn and soybean crops. Insurers in the US may face as much as $20bn&#xa0;losses this year, their biggest ever loss in agriculture. This is not exactly helping fight the economic crisis.</p> <p>It is simply incredible what big risks some people are prepared to take on behalf of future generations. Despite the facts and evidence in front of us, there are still many interests advocating doing nothing or continuing with business-as-usual. Or just forgetting the climate crisis until we have solved the economic crisis.</p> <p>And whereas some see the current financial turmoil as a bitter setback for international climate protection, I see intelligent climate action as a driver of new opportunities for jobs in Europe, for investments in energy efficiency technologies, for boosting innovation and competitiveness, for lowering energy bills.</p> <p>To me, tackling the climate crisis helps, not damages, our economic security and prosperity. Both crises are interlinked and must be tackled together.</p>",
  "<p>Of the <a href=\"http://www.mlssoccer.com/players\">543 players currently active in Major League Soccer</a>, just under half (48.8%) were born in the United States of America. Given that there are three MLS teams north of the border, you may have thought that Canada might be the second-most represented nationality. However, just 3.9% of MLS players are Canadian. Second place actually belongs to Colombia, with almost one in every twenty MLS players (4.7%).</p> <p>So what has motivated so many Colombians to venture north? The Portland Timbers midfielder Diego Char\u00e1 believes he knows: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\"I think it's because Colombian players are able to adapt to various styles of play very well. I have had Colombian players ask me about MLS. They ask about the level of play, and some tell me that they love the speed of play. I tell them it's a very different game than Colombia. It is a lot faster and a lot more physical. I tell them it is a good league.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Alongside good salary packages, the appeal of MLS to Colombians is clear \u2013 in some instances, just being paid on time is enough. In the early 1950s <a href=\"http://www.worldsoccer.com/blogs/colombia-once-had-a-claim-to-be-the-best-league-in-the-world\">Colombia's domestic league was considered one of the best in the world</a>, earning it the nickname \"El Dorado\" (\"The golden one\"). Today's situation is a stark contrast. The domestic game in Colombia is struggling financially \u2013 <a href=\"http://colombiareports.com/colombia-news/sports/22775-colombian-soccer-suffers-from-legacy-of-drug-cartel-involvement.html\">a consequence of attempts to cleanse itself of ill-gotten money</a>.</p> <p>Few clubs illustrate the problem more than Am\u00e9rica De Cali, which has debts of nearly $2m. The club's problems date back to the mid-90s, when it was placed on the infamous <a href=\"http://colombialawbiz.com/2010/04/29/who-is-on-the-\" clinton-list\"-and-can-they-get-removed \">Clinton List</a>). This meant that the club's assets and bank accounts on US soil were frozen, due to suspected links to illegal activities. In a bid to clear to the club's name, <a href=\"http://southamericanfootball.co.uk/news/features/item/269-am%25C3%25A9rica-de-cali-from-curses-copas-and-cocaine-to-clinton-crisis-and-collapse.html\">the Am\u00e9rica de Cali hierarchy recently held discussions over changing the team's name and management</a>.</p> <p>Such financial insecurity has bred uncertainty amongst Colombian players \u2013 as Gavin Wilkinson, the former technical director and now interim head coach of the Portland Timbers, explains: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\"When Jorge Perlaza first arrived at the club he came to see me around a month in because he hadn't received a paycheck yet. I explained to him the money should already be in his account. At the time I was still using an interpreter. We actually ended up going to the bank across the street to check it was definitely in there.\" </p> </blockquote> <p>Perlaza's worries were understandable. In Colombia, players have been known to go unpaid for months. The Timbers defender Hanyer Mosquera, who played for Deportes Quind\u00edo and La Equidad in Colombia, has first-hand experience of this. </p> <p>\"It was an unfortunate experience in that they weren't punctual in their payments at times,\" he said. \"It is very important for me to be able to provide for my family the way they deserve.\" </p> <p>When comparing life as a soccer player in the US and in Colombia, Mosquera's assessment is simple: \"I am happy in both places, but I miss my family obviously. The soccer is the same here and there, so there is not much change. One of my dreams was to be successful in a high-level league outside my country. [MLS] is a league that is well-known, and games are broadcast everywhere.\" </p> <p>Char\u00e1, like Mosquera, is keen to stress that for Colombians it is the play, not the pay, that provides motivation: \"More than [clubs] just paying in full, it's more about a change of culture for me, and learning this style of play.</p> <p>\"For the most part I was treated fairly in Colombia, but going unpaid does happen. The players that want to come over here appreciate knowing they will have financial stability.\"</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396483807\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2012/9/19/1348068020687/Fredy-Montero-of-the-Seat-004.jpg\" alt=\"Fredy Montero of the Seattle Sounders\" width=\"140\" height=\"130\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Fredy Montero of the Seattle Sounders. Photograph: George Holland/ZUMA Press/Corbis</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: George Holland/  George Holland/ZUMA Press/Corbis</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>When speaking to Colombians about MLS, the speed of play is often mentioned. Fredy Montero of the Seattle Sounders also admires the opportunity for growth. </p> <p>\"I like how fast the game is here,\" he said. \"The level is good here. The MLS is building a really strong league to develop the young players and the future stars of soccer.\" </p> <p>Wilkinson says of MLS clubs's interest in Colombian players: \"For us, South America has been a good market. We've needed to get players that can maintain their value. With the salary cap system in MLS, if a player is earning $100,000 they need to be a $100-$150,000 player.\" </p> <p>Given that such value for money is a key component of any transfer deal, Real Salt Lake's J\u00e1mison Olave perhaps provides the best example of Colombian value. The former Deportivo Cali man was named MLS defender of the year in 2010. <a href=\"http://www.mlsplayers.org/files/august_12_2010_salary_information__by_club.pdf\">His cost to RSL? A mere $240,000</a>.</p> <p>Now that clubs such as Portland are established in the Colombian marketplace, players like Char\u00e1 are used to provide character references for potential new recruits \u2013 such as Mosquera.</p> <p>\"I knew Diego Char\u00e1 beforehand and I talked to him about joining the Timbers,\" said Mosquera. \"He told me about what a great opportunity the team provides, both professionally and personally. I saw fellow countrymen who were successful here, and that interested me a lot. MLS is an attractive league. There's always talk about the American dream and the peace of mind people have here. It goes beyond the soccer aspect to quality of life, too.\"</p> <p>Wilkinson is keen to stress just how much research was involved prior to his decision to look for players in Colombia. </p> <p>\"Normally I get a good sense of the player and his club, why he's at where he's at,\" he said. \"I think it also helps to know the clubs transaction history: whether the club need the money or not and how that will affect the player's price. I'm not going to say the price on Diego Char\u00e1 was driven up, but Deportes Tolima has a reputation for not being the easiest club to work with, because they don't need the money. With Hanyer Mosquera we knew the club were coming into financial trouble that heated up the pursuit of him and we were able to get him.\" </p> <p>The Timbers also secured loan deals for Sebasti\u00e1n Rinc\u00f3n and Jos\u00e9 Adolfo Valencia, despite the latter having a knee injury that would rule him out for six to 12 months. </p> <p>\"He's only 20,\" Wilkinson said of Valencia. \"We believe he has the ability, the talent and the athleticism to make a full recovery and be an impact player for the Portland Timbers.\" </p> <p>Wilkinson says the deal was a chance for the Timbers to show how they operated. </p> <p>\"Yes we could have sent him back and washed our hands of it but I think that sends the wrong message to every other player we're trying to bring into this organization and every player already here. One of the things we'd like to be recognized for is how we treat our players and how professional we are on and off the field. I think Jos\u00e9 is an indication of how we value players in general.\"</p> <p>The work doesn't end when the player arrives at the club. For the Timbers, that's when Beto Angulo enters the fold. </p> <p>\"Beto is a tremendous person,\" Wilkinson said. \"He's a full-time player-relations manager. Beto speaks fluent Spanish and is someone that's helped every Colombian on board. I don't think it's wise to invest money in a player and expect them to play well \u2013 they need to acclimatize be happy at home with their family and feel comfortable.\" </p> <p>Angulo is given a similar endorsement by Char\u00e1 and Mosquera, both of whom have not gone unnoticed by rival clubs since their arrival in Portland. Wilkinson says that any further sale would have to benefit the club as well as the player. </p> <p>\"If we can continue to upgrade the squad by selling player X to bring in Y and Z then we will,\" he said. \"We've had offers from both within the continent and in Europe, but it hasn't made sense. If it makes sense from all angles then we'll consider it more.\"</p> <p>However, despite more Colombians looking to move to MLS, Wilkinson says that the Timbers are not looking to invest in more of Char\u00e1 or Valencia's compatriots. </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\"We still think you need quality American players to succeed. It's important that when we bring the Colombians in they learn the American culture, I think if you start to get eight or nine Colombians then the locker room becomes a concern, not because they are bad people but because the Colombians no longer have to learn English. The dynamic of a locker room changes, which can be a hard cycle to break. There's very many reasons why we won't continue to add Colombians right now, and if maybe one was good enough, they may replace one we currently have on board.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>It seems fair to suggest, however, that the influx of Colombians to MLS has not reached its peak \u2013 and Wilkinson agrees: \"If you can offer personal growth [and] consistency with pay, its often easier to get a Colombian that has had trouble with their club. So Colombia will be a viable market for MLS clubs for years to come.\" </p> <p>You can bet that the Timbers' MLS rivals will be more than happy to draw from such a deep well of talent.</p>",

  "<p>BP says it is in \"advanced talks\" with potential purchasers for its Texas City refinery \u2013 one of its most troubled assets \u2013 and is expecting to sell it before the end of the year.</p> <p>Shares in BP were up 2.2p to 441.2p by mid-afternoon on Wednesday amid speculation that US company Marathon Petroleum was poised to take over America's third largest refinery for around $2.5bn (\u00a31.5bn).</p> <p>Neither Marathon nor BP would comment on the identity of any possible purchaser but the UK-based company admitted it was close to the disposal of the refinery where 15 people were killed and 170 injured in an explosion seven years ago.</p> <p>\"We are in advanced discussions regarding potential sale. We have engaged a number of interested, qualified industry participants. We remain on track to announce a transaction before year end,\" said BP in a statement.</p> <p>The sale has been triggered by BP's desire to raise $38bn of cash to pay for liabilities and possible fines related to another disaster: the 2010 Deepwater Horizon spill in the Gulf of Mexico.</p> <p>BP has also been happy to scale down its refining operations, where profit margins have been thin for many years.</p> <p>The energy group recently disposed of the Carson refinery in California to Tesoro for $2.25bn but said it planned to hang on to three core US sites: Whiting in Indiana, Cherry Point in Washington and Toledo in Ohio.</p> <p>Earlier this month BP sold off oil and gas fields in the Gulf of Mexico to Plains Exploration for $5.5bn and revealed it had asked a Louisiana court to approve a multibillion-dollar settlement over the Deepwater Horizon incident with hundreds of private claimants.</p> <p>But that filing provoked a fierce response from the US department of justice, which said it still expected to find the company guilty of gross negligence in a court case which restarts in January. There had been hopes that the department and BP were close to some kind of out-of-court settlement.</p> <p>The sale of Texas City would bring to an end a sorry chapter in BP's history: safety authorities found the company guilty of over 300 violations after the fire and slapped a record fine on it.</p>",
  "<p>More routine use should be made of a controversial \"child-friendly\" detention centre for families facing removal from Britain, according to a new Home Office watchdog.</p> <p>The independent family returns panel says that the child welfare charity Barnardo's, which provides welfare services at the G4S-run Cedars \"pre-departure centre\", should drop its \"red line\" that it should only be used as a last resort and that no more than 10% of the families facing removal should be held there.</p> <p>The first annual report from the panel, which is chaired by a former social services director, says that immigration and private security staff should be given the right to use force to restrain teenage children who aggressively try to resist the removal of themselves and their families.</p> <p>Chris Spencer, the panel's chair, said: \"Returning families to their country of origin against their wishes is a sobering endeavour but UK Border Agency can do more. It has both the skills and facilities to make the returns process even easier for families.\"</p> <p>Barnardo's immediately rejected the panel's call to review its \"red line\", saying: \"Families should only be referred to Cedars as a matter of exception, not routine, which is why we will be sticking by our red line that Cedars should be used in no more than 10% of total family returns.\" The charity set out its seven \"red lines\" in response to criticism when the centre opened that its involvement carried the risk of \"legitimising family detention\".</p> <p>The panel's report discloses that 109 of the 665 families who \"entered the returns process\" between March 2011 and March 2012 returned home. Nearly half of those who were sent home \u2013 53 families \u2013 were held at the Cedars at Pease Pottage, near Gatwick airport, as part of an \"ensured return\" process. Families are held initially up to 72 hours at the centre and can be detained for up to a week with ministerial authorisation.</p> <p>The Cedars was opened as part of the implementation of the coalition government's pledge to end the detention of children for immigration purposes. The panel says that although it has been operating at \"well below capacity\" it has proved \"an exceptionally effective facility for helping to secure a successful return for families\" since it opened in August 2011. It can hold up to nine families at a time, but has so far not had more than three at any one time.</p> <p>The panel says that more families would benefit from a short stay at Cedars, especially where parents have not prepared children for their return and therefore left them confused about what is happening. \"Barnardo's should review the 10% 'red line' and consider whether it supports the best interests of children and their families,\" says the panel.</p> <p>Barnardo's chief executive, Anne Marie Carrie, said: \"When we agreed to be involved in Cedars it was on the explicit understanding that the facility would only be used with a small number of families, for a short time and as a last resort.</p> <p>\"Families should only be referred to Cedars as a matter of exception, not routine.\"</p> <p>The charity has already protested to the UK Border Agency over one family being held longer than a week and another case in which the Reliance private security guards used \"inappropriate force\" when taking an individual away.</p>",
  "<p>Yesterday I casually tweeted how nice it was to go to London's Gate theatre to see the excellent Sunset Baby and find my ticket being torn by the artistic director, <a href=\"http://www.thestage.co.uk/news/newsstory.php/35271/christopher-haydon-announces-first-season-at\">Christopher Haydon</a>. In fact I think having the AD tearing the tickets is something of a Gate tradition, possibly something started by<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/stephen-daldry\"> Stephen Daldry </a>when he ran <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/stage/theatreblog+culture/stephen-daldry\">the tiny Notting Hill theatre</a>.</p> <p>I was surprised by the strong response the tweet elicited, with people reporting back from around the country how much they appreciated it when those who actually run our theatres, or make theatre, engage face-to-face with audiences on the way in or out. </p> <p>Several people fondly recalled the strong front-of-house presence of Giles Havergal and his team when they were at the Citizens in Glasgow, and I've always liked the fact that at both BAC and the Young Vic in London, the artistic directors are very much in evidence in the public parts of the building on a daily basis. @deldridgewriter described the Young Vic's <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/davidlan\">David Lan</a> \"<a href=\"https://twitter.com/deldridgewriter/status/247959600194805760\">like a shop-keeper padding around the pavement in the Cut</a>\", and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ClareMBrennan/status/247990621644656641\">@ClaremBrennan</a> reminded that Northern Broadsides' Barrie Rutter always makes a point of greeting audiences. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/danielbye/status/247969988881838080\">@danielbye recalled having his ticket torn in Paris</a> by the great <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/2012/aug/10/ariane-mnouchkine-life-in-theatre\">Ariane Mnouchkine</a>. </p> <p>It was David Eldridge too who pointed out that it is <a href=\"https://twitter.com/deldridgewriter\">box office staff and ushers who are the playwright's best friend</a> because they are a direct conduit between those buying the tickets and those making the work.</p> <p>Theatres often spend large amounts of money on tracking customer feedback but perhaps what is really needed is for Greg Doran and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/nicholashytner?INTCMP=SRCH\">Nicholas Hytner </a>to usher a few of the shows in their theatres so they get a real sense of what audiences feel, not just about individual plays but the whole customer experience. It's something that fringe theatres are often good at: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/benmonks/status/247962477667692545\">@benmonks singled out Tara Arts for friendliness</a>, and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MissSionedJones/status/247967665367437312\">@MissSionedJones praised Sasha Regan at the Union</a> who pretty well does everything from directing to serving behind the bar.</p> <p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/DandDUK/status/248002516653076480\">@DandDUK pointed Twitter</a> towards a fascinating Devoted and Disgruntled Roadshow report that came out at the Edinburgh D&amp;D, in which a session was called to discuss the <a href=\"http://www.devotedanddisgruntled.com/events/dd-roadshow-edinburgh/reports/ushers-shush-what-are-they-good-for/\">crucial importance of ushers in the theatre</a>, and how they can make or break a performance both for audiences and companies.</p> <p>The exchanges got me thinking just how important the front of house experience is for theatregoers. After all, even if the food is good, we wouldn't go back to a restaurant where the maitre d' was rude to us, but we might feel very inclined to return if, after the meal, the chef came out to ask us what we really thought of the meal she had served.</p> <p>We may like to think that the show's the thing, but with rising ticket prices the investment that people make in a night out is quite considerable, and it can be the little things \u2013 a well-run bar, clean toilets (with soap, the absence of which is one of my bugbears) friendly staff and a warm welcome \u2013 that can make all the difference between feeling that you've had an OK night out or a really good one. Even the quality and price of the ice-cream can be a dealbreaker. </p> <p>What makes a difference to you when you go to the theatre? Share the things that irritate you, and tell us about the welcomes that have ensured you return to a venue again and again.</p>",
  "<p>As if his week needed to become any more challenging, Mitt Romney will appear in Miami on Wednesday to face some tough questions from a key group of voters crucial to his hopes of winning the White House \u2013 Florida's Hispanics.</p> <p>The Republican presidential candidate, already in trouble for his \"it would be helpful to be a Latino\" comment recorded at a Florida fundraising dinner, goes into an interview with the Spanish-language TV station Univision seeking to explain and defend his controversial policies on immigration and healthcare.</p> <p>Barack Obama, meanwhile, follows Romney to south Florida for his own appearance before the same cameras on Thursday. And while Obama enjoys a margin of popularity among Florida's 2.1 million Hispanic electors, 51% to 37%, according to the latest polls, analysts say the vote could yet tip either way.</p> <p>\"It's hard to win the presidency and not win in Florida, and it's hard to win in Florida without winning the Hispanic vote,\" said Casey Klofstad, associate professor of political science at the University of Miami and an analyst for the polling group Latino Decisions.</p> <p>\"The campaign is more about turnout than changing hearts and minds. The candidates need to court their base and go to where the votes are. The Latino vote is especially critical, and any candidate that comes through here needs to pay attention to it.\" </p> <p>To treat the Hispanic community as a single entity, however, is a mistake neither candidate is willing to make as they pursue Florida's 29 electoral college votes. Aside from common concerns over jobs and the economy, each subgroup has its own issues and idiosyncrasies that the nominees will be attempting to address.</p> <p>Both Romney and Obama are spending a disproportionate amount of time and resources here to get their positions across, and by Thursday night each will have visited Florida nine times since June 1, more than any other state during the campaign to date.</p> <p>Republicans and Democrats are also lavishing more cash in Florida than anywhere else. According to Kantar Media, the Republicans spent $7.5m on advertising from July 1 to September 10, $1.5m more than the Democrats. Many of those TV commercials on both sides have been in Spanish, and have featured voters of Cuban or Puerto Rican origin or those of other Hispanic nationalities.</p> <p>\"This is a diverse and sophisticated electorate,\" Gabriela Domenzain, Obama's director of Hispanic press, told the Huffington Post.</p> <p>\"You can't just put out one message and think that speaks to 50 million people. We get that and we try to respect it.\"</p> <p>Unsurprisingly, Romney is polling ahead of his rival among Cuban Americans in Miami, where exiles have traditionally supported successive Republican candidates for their hardline stance against the communist regime of Fidel Castro and his brother Ra\u00fal.</p> <p>That is unlikely to change by November, but the demographic of Cuban Americans is undoubtedly shifting, as older, more conservative Cubans who fled the island in the 1950s and 60s die and the community increasingly consists of those born in the US.</p> <p>Obama, therefore, has high hopes of a better showing among Cuban Americans, who make up a third of the Hispanic voting bloc and who were 63.9% in favour of Republican opponent John McCain in 2008.</p> <p>\"There has been a change in the thinking processes of many in the Cuban American community, and a realisation that what happens in Cuba is sometimes beyond the reach of what the American government can do,\" said Manrique Iriarte, a Cuban-born doctor who works at Miami's Mount Sinai medical centre.</p> <p>\"For five decades we've been hearing messages from both parties regarding the regime in Cuba. Politicians have been coming here for 50 years drinking coffee in Caf\u00e9 Versailles and Cuba Libres on Calle Ocho \u2013&#xa0;and it's not working any more. We're looking for broader messages for our lives as Americans.</p> <p>\"Most of the Cuban American vote will always be Republican no matter what happens or who runs for the White House, but the Democrats won 25% of the vote in 2000 and 35% in 2008. The goal is 40% this time, and that seems possible.\"</p> <h2>A different story for Puerto Ricans</h2> <p>Further north, Puerto Ricans are the fastest growing community in Florida and, to some observers at least, could have more of a say in deciding the eventual winner, largely because the group has no traditional party affiliation.</p> <p>There are almost 900,000 Puerto Ricans in the state, double that of a decade ago, with migration promoted by a poor economy in their homeland and the fact that Puerto Rico's status as an unincorporated territory of the US grants them citizenship and freedom of movement.</p> <p>Puerto Ricans now account for 28.4% of Florida's Hispanic electorate, according to Pew Research Center figures, and are on course to become the largest group by the 2016 election. About 350,000 live along the so-called I-4 corridor from Tampa to Daytona Beach, where voters could determine the contest one way or the other if the rest of the state stays loyal to the Republicans in the north and the Democrats in the south.</p> <p>It also explains why a raft of senior Democrats including the Obamas and Bill Clinton, and several politicians from Puerto Rico, have been regular visitors. The president even stopped by a Puerto Rican caf\u00e9 in Orlando last month for a photo op with a plate of pulled pork, rice and beans.</p> <p>\"For us, like others, the economy and healthcare are the big issues, and I would say the majority are Democrats,\" said Maria Luyanda, head of her own Orlando-based insurance company and president of the Puerto Rican chamber of commerce of central Florida.</p> <p>\"The main reason is which party tends to protect the middle class and which party protects rich people. Many of us are small business owners and we look to who will look after us.\"</p> <p>Romney's stated policies on immigration, experts say, remain an obstacle to his building support among other Hispanic voters, notably the smaller yet significant communities from Mexico (8.9%) and the Dominican Republic (4.5%). Romney has said he would veto the proposed Dream Act, which offers a path to citizenship for children of undocumented immigrants, and that he supports self-deportation and stiff penalties to those who entered the US illegally or outstayed visas.</p> <p>Obama, by contrast, announced in June he was suspending the deportation of hundreds of thousands of undocumented immigrants between 16 and 30 and would instead give them work permits, something Romney now says he supports.</p> <p>\"It would be better for Romney to peel away from immigration and pivot to the economy,\" said Klofstad, the professor at the University of Miami where Romney's Univision interview is taking place.</p> <p>\"He needs to say that most important is job creation and the economy, it's something we can all agree on, and here's what I'm going to do.\"</p> <p>Then there's Romney's claim in a secretly filmed video at a dinner for donors in Boca Raton, Florida, that if his Mexican-born father had native parents instead of American expatriates: \"I'd have a better shot of winning this.\"</p> <p>The comment infuriated many, and it remains to be seen how much of Florida's Hispanic vote it will cost him in November.</p> <p>For now \"there's no doubt the Romney campaign has been hit hard,\" Klofstad said.</p>",

  "<p>Companies are in a bind. The pressure is on them to become sustainable, but they know they can't do it alone. Sure, they can cut energy use, reduce waste, limit water consumption and generally create a spick-and-span, eco-tastic chain of production. But they need consumers on board too. Why? Because a chunk of their environmental impacts occur when their products get into our mitts. And therein lies the bind. We, the consumer, do what we like. We're free to choose. Not that we're beyond being influenced. Make sustainability easy, normal and fun, and we should buy into it. That's the idea, at least.</p> <p>In the third in a series of discussions supported by Unilever, Guardian Sustainable Business gathered together experts to discuss how companies can help make sustainability \"just living\". The panel included Cheryl Hicks, team leader for sustainable lifestyles at UNEP/Wuppertal Institute Collaborating Centre on Sustainable Production and Consumption (CSCP); Freya Williams, group planning director at OgilvyEarth; David Jones, global CEO at Havas and co-founder of One Young World; Fergus Lowe, professor in psychology at Bangor University; Mark Earls, author of Herd; Stefano Giolito, director, sustainability at Unilever; Dr Mark Cobain, global new business director at Unilever.</p> <h2>Moving with the tide</h2> <p>Changing habits isn't easy. That said, the trends augur well for a shift to sustainable living. We, the people, are broadly in favour. Lifestyles with less wastage and lower environmental impacts strike us as, well, not unreasonable. Cheryl Hicks, a sustainable consumption expert, pointed to \"mounting evidence\" of more sustainable ways of living in Europe. The watchwords for future lifestyles are \"efficient\" (ie wasting less), \"different\" (\"a shift in preferences from quantity and ownership to access and quality\") and \"sufficient\" (\"conscious efforts to consume less\").</p> <p>David Jones, chief executive of media group Havas, echoed that optimistic note. Today's youth hold the key, he reckoned. Their desire to change the world and their social media savviness mean they have the desire and, more importantly, the ability to reward sustainable companies. Indeed, it could be said that we're on the verge of a \"generational shift\", where irresponsible become viewed as \"socially unacceptable\". At least, so thinks Freya Williams, director of strategy at OgilvyEarth. Look at NikeFuel. All of a sudden, good living is \"fun, cool and visible\", she observed.</p> <h2>Dos and don'ts</h2> <p>Unilever's Mark Cobain emphasised ease over entertainment. Making sustainability fun is fine; making it easy is essential. Anything that takes undue time or requires extra thought turns online shoppers off, he argued. In other words, the simpler, the better. Similarly, he advocated easing people into new behaviours. Shock doctrine and sustainable living don't mix. It's unrealistic to expect a season car driver to swap their gas-guzzler for a pedal bike. But buy a hybrid or join a car-sharing club \u2013 now that borders on the possible.</p> <p>However, just because the zeitgeist is green, doesn't mean the future will be, too. Some tips on how not to mess it up. First, don't preach. Boring facts about healthy eating have never stopped a child scoffing down a doughnut, suggested Fergus Lowe, professor in psychology at Bangor University. Far better is a systematic approach based on fun, rewards and peer influence, such as the the Food Dudes programme. Secondly, don't price eco-products too high. Making sustainability the expensive option is a ticket to failure, argued Williams. Normalise the price, she insisted. Thirdly, package eco offerings as regular fare. Consumers, by and large, like the mainstream. Niche, we're not so sure about. So best to ditch the \"green\" labels.</p> <h2>Big up brand power</h2> <p>Of course, none of us are really entirely free to choose. We're targeted by messages day in, day out. Like it or not, many of those come from big brands. For individuals to adopt sustainable lifestyles, our good intentions need to be translated into practical actions, says Unilever's Stefano Giolito. Brands embody values and aspirations, so they should do what they do best: make great (and preferably sustainable) products, and then use their brand power to get people using them. The success of such a strategy will be born from marketing simplicity, added Hicks. \"Brand strategists hold the unique skills to distil complex issues and ideas down to something that people will understand, remember, and act upon.\"</p> <h2>Legislating for change </h2> <p>There is another option of course. Regarding the car to bike idea mentioned earlier, legislators could simply issue a blanket ban on the combustion engine, although that's unlikely to happen any time soon. Even so, a case can be made for law-making as the \"fastest and most effective\" towards changing behaviour. David Jones argued exactly that. Consider smoking: \"Who would have though just a decade ago that it would be now illegal to smoke in most bars and restaurants in the major capitals?\" he asked. So too with CFCs and car emissions. \"If you legislate, it works\". But does it? Bangor University's Lowe wondered how you would legislate for a child to like broccoli. Laws are good at stopping us from certain actions, but weak at initiating us in others. Mark Earls, author of the book Herd, points to the example of a tax on fizzy drinks in New York. Such a measure may eventually skew the market towards healthier beverages, \"but it will not work for everyone, nor will its impact be equal in all locations or amongst all demographics\".</p> <p>Other, less blunt tools are needed. Unilever's Mark Cobain had a suggestion. He'd like to see the creation of supportive environments, where sustainable living is easy (easier than unsustainable living, that is). Hicks agreed. She gave the example of sustainable cities. Legislators are important, of course. They set planning rules and CO2 targets. But we need the engineers, designers and architects to put these into effect. Once a sustainable infrastructure is in place, options like public transport or off-peak electricity use become straightforward for Joe Public.</p> <h2>Pulling the celeb card</h2> <p>Like everything else these days, if the sensible stuff (see above) doesn't work, then you can call in a celebrity. Take Matt Damon's work on water conservation. Celebs, like brands, have a massive opportunity to be a positive force of change, said Unilever's Giolito. But fame without feelings may no longer be quite good enough. As Havas's Jones concluded: \"Authenticity is becoming way more important than image\". Proof, indeed, that change is thankfully possible.</p> <p><strong>This article forms part of </strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/series/letstalksustainableliving\" title=\"\"><strong>Let's talk sustainable living</strong></a><strong>, a series of thought provoking conversations around the big challenges facing companies in making </strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/sustainable-living\" title=\"\"><strong>sustainable living</strong></a><strong> mainstream.

  "<p>Food is one of society's key sensitivities to climate. A year of not enough or too much rainfall, a hot spell or cold snap at the wrong time, or extremes, like flooding and storms, can have a significant effect on local crop yields and livestock production. While modern farming technologies and techniques have helped to reduce this vulnerability and boost production, the impact of recent droughts in the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/jul/25/drought-higher-food-prices\">USA</a>, <a href=\"http://www.fao.org/docrep/013/al975e/al975e00.pdf\">China</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2010/aug/09/russian-drought-wheat-prices\">Russia</a> on global cereal production highlight a glaring potential future vulnerability. </p> <p>There is some evidence that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/dec/21/what-is-climate-change\">climate change</a> is already having a measurable affect on the quality and quantity of food produced globally. But this is small when compared with the significant increase in global food production that has been achieved over the past few decades. Isolating the influence of climatic change from all the other trends is difficult, but one recent <a href=\"http://iis-db.stanford.edu/pubs/23214/policy_brief_trends11.pdf\">Stanford University study</a> found that increases in global production of maize and wheat since 1980 would have been about 5% higher were it not for climate change. </p> <p>All else being equal, rising carbon dioxide concentrations \u2013 the main driver of climate change \u2013 could increase production of some crops, such as rice, soybean and wheat. However, the changing climate would affect the length and quality of the growing season and farmers could experience increasing damage to their crops, caused by a rising intensity of droughts, flooding or fires. </p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar4/wg2/ar4-wg2-chapter5.pdf\">latest IPCC report</a> predicted improving conditions for food production in the mid to high latitudes over the next few decades, including in the northern USA, Canada, northern Europe and Russia. Conversely, parts of the subtropics, such as the Mediterranean region and parts of Australia, and the low latitudes, could experience declining conditions. For example, across Africa, yields from rain-fed agriculture could decline by as much as 50% by 2020. Beyond this, if global temperatures rise by more than about 1\u20133\u00b0C, declining conditions could be experienced over a much larger area. </p> <p>The future course of global food production will depend on how well societies can adapt to such climatic changes, as well as the influence of other pressures, such as the competition for land from biofuel production. The IPCC <a href=\"http://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar4/wg2/ar4-wg2-chapter5.pdf\">concluded</a> that in the poorer, low-latitude countries, climate change could seriously challenge the capacity to adapt for a warming of more than 3\u00b0C. The richer, higher latitude countries are likely to have a greater capacity to adapt and exploit changing climatic conditions.</p> <p>But we can't ignore the potential for \"surprises\" down the line. There are many uncertainties in such predictions. The world has not seen such changes in climate for millennia, and so it is impossible to know how our agricultural systems will react in the real world. For example, the complex interlinkages with the impacts of climate change on pests, diseases and pollinators, like bees, are largely unknown. Also, climate models have difficulty in accurately predicting the detailed local environmental changes that are important for food production, particularly weather extremes.</p> <p>A looming vulnerability is the world's <a href=\"http://www.fao.org/fishery/topic/13789/en\">fisheries</a>, which provide an important source of protein for at least half the world's population. Fisheries are already stressed by overexploitation and pollution. Warming surface waters in the oceans, rivers and lakes, as well as sea level rise and melting ice, will adversely affect many fish species. Some marine fish species are already adapting by migrating to the high latitudes, but others, such as Arctic and freshwater species, have nowhere to go. The absorption of carbon dioxide emissions by the oceans also has a direct impact on marine ecosystems through ocean acidification. </p> <p>But what does this mean for food security \u2013 the price and availability of food for the world's seven billion people? A <a href=\"http://www.bis.gov.uk/assets/foresight/docs/food-and-farming/11-546-future-of-food-and-farming-report.pdf\">2011 Foresight report</a> concluded that climate change is a relatively small factor here, at least in the short term, when compared with the rapid increases in global food demand expected in the next decade. On <a href=\"http://esa.un.org/wpp/Other-Information/Press_Release_WPP2010.pdf\">current projections</a>, by 2050 there will be between one and three billion additional mouths to feed. As people become wealthier, they also demand more food and disproportionally more meat, which requires far more land and water resources per calorie consumed. When these factors are combined, it points toward a future of increasing and more volatile food prices. </p> <p>As was seen during the 2007\u201308 food price spikes, the poorest countries and communities will be hit first and hardest. The <a href=\"http://www.bis.gov.uk/assets/foresight/docs/food-and-farming/11-546-future-of-food-and-farming-report.pdf\">Foresight report</a> concluded that international policy has an important role to play here \u2013 today, despite plentiful supplies of food globally, almost one billion people are undernourished. </p> <p>Finally, food production itself is a significant emitter of greenhouse gases, as well as a cause of environmental degradation in many parts of the world. Agriculture contributes <a href=\"http://www.wri.org/sites/default/themes/wri2009/favicon.ico\">about 15% of all emissions</a>, on a par with transport. When land conversion and the wider food system are taken into account the total contribution of food may be as high as 30%. This means that to limit the long-run impacts of climate change, food production must become not only more resilient to climate but also more sustainable and low-carbon itself.</p> <p><em>\u2022 This article was written by Nicola Ranger of the <a href=\"http://www2.lse.ac.uk/GranthamInstitute\">Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment</a> at LSE in collaboration with the Guardian</em></p> <h2>The ultimate climate change FAQ</h2> <p>\u2022 This answer last updated: 10.07.12<br>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/blog/2010/nov/05/ultimate-climate-change-faq\">Read about the project and suggest a question</a><br>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/dec/09/climate-faq-report-error\">Report an error in this answer</a></p> <p><strong>Related questions</strong><br>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/feb/16/economic-impact-climate-change\">What is the economic cost of climate change?</a><br>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/feb/15/stern-review\">What is the Stern review?</a><br>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/apr/21/countries-responsible-climate-change\"> Which nations are most responsible for climate change? </a></p> <h2>This editorial is free to reproduce under Creative Commons</h2> <p><br>This post by <a xmlns:cc=\"http://creativecommons.org/ns#\" href=\"http://theguardian.com\" property=\"cc:attributionName\" rel=\"cc:attributionURL\">The Guardian</a> is licensed under a <a rel=\"license\" href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/2.0/uk/\">Creative Commons Attribution-No Derivative Works 2.0 UK: England &amp; Wales License</a>.<br>Based on a work at <a xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\" href=\"http://theguardian.com\" rel=\"dc:source\">theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>An Australian senator has resigned from the opposition's frontbench team after he provoked outrage by <a href=\"http://www.abc.net.au/news/2012-09-19/bernardi-under-fire-over-bestiality-comments/4269740\" title=\"\">comparing gay marriage to bestiality</a>.</p> <p>Cory Bernardi also warned that allowing same-sex unions could lead to calls to legalise polygamy, during a debate in the senate on Tuesday.</p> <p>\"The next step, quite frankly, is having three people or four people that love each other being able to enter into a permanent union endorsed by society \u2013 or any other type of relationship,\" he said.</p> <p>\"There are even some creepy people out there \u2026 [who] say it is OK to have consensual sexual relations between humans and animals.</p> <p>\"Will that be a future step?

We have focused on schemes with a plastic loyalty card; cards which are redeemed when enough stamps have been accrued are not included.</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.nectar.com/NectarHome.nectar\" title=\"\">Nectar</a> </h2> <p><strong>Where can they be collected? </strong>At Sainsbury's, Homebase, Ford, BP, Vision Express, PruHealth, Expedia and British Gas, and when you shop at more than 500 online stores if you do so via the Nectar website.</p> <p><strong>How many points per pound? </strong>Typically two on everyday shopping, although on fuel points are accrued at a rate of one point per litre. At specialist retailers there are all kinds of deals: for example, Expedia offers a flat rate of 200 points on flights.</p> <p><strong>Can I earn extra points? </strong>Yes. Nectar sends out regular bonus points vouchers for cardholders to use when shopping, and individual retailers often offer their own. Retailers list deals <a href=\"http://www.nectar.com/collect.points\" title=\"\">on the Nectar website</a>: currently, for example, British Gas gives 800 points for each account you switch to direct debit.</p> <p><strong>How much are they worth? </strong>Half a penny, although there are opportunities to double their value, at attractions that are members of the Tussauds Group, for example.</p> <p><strong>How can I maximise the points' value? </strong>Look for offers which allow you to double the points.</p> <p><strong>Where I can spend them?</strong> In Sainsbury's and Argos, online with Expedia and a range of other partners.</p> <p><strong>How can I spend them?</strong> In Sainsbury's and Argos you just hand over the card and ask for the points to be taken off. You can order products online or or on the phone (0844 811 0811).</p> <p><strong>Are they time limited? </strong>No. Nectar points remain valid for as long as you remain active in the scheme, although any accounts that are inactive for 12 months will be closed and those points lost.</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.tesco.com/clubcard/clubcard/\" title=\"\">Tesco Clubcard</a></h2> <p><strong>Where can points be collected? </strong>In Tesco stores and when shopping for groceries online, and on the other services it offers such as Tesco Mobile, Broadband and Homephone and the home improvements services such as Tesco Kitchens. Clubcard points are available for users of Tesco's credit card. Points are also available through E.ON.</p> <p><strong>How many points per pound?</strong> The standard rate is one; on fuel it is half a point per pound; while on technology services, such as broadband and mobile, it is three points per pound (until the end of 2012).</p> <p>The rate for non-Tesco purchases made on a Tesco credit card is 0.25 points per pound. The rate through E.ON is half a point per pound.</p> <p><strong>Can I earn extra points? </strong>Yes. Tesco offers \"Green Clubcard points\" if you reuse carrier bags (except in Wales where it is a legal requirement), or recycle aluminium cans. You get one point per bag and 0.5 points per can. It also sends out vouchers to use in-store to collect bonus points.</p> <p><strong>How much are they worth?</strong> A point is worth 1p off standard grocery products. However they can be converted, using <a href=\"http://www.tesco.com/clubcard/deals/\" title=\"\">Clubcard Rewards</a>, into money off at other companies where they are often worth more. For instance, \u00a310 of Clubcard vouchers convert into \u00a340 of vouchers in high street restaurants such as Cafe Rouge and Pizza Express.</p> <p><strong>How can I maximise the points' value?</strong> By using Clubcard Rewards. The typical conversion rate of four reward points for every standard point maximises their value, although it is necessary to have \u00a35 of vouchers to take advantage of this.</p> <p><strong>Where can I spend them? </strong>In a Tesco store or at other outlets through the Rewards scheme.</p> <p><strong>How can I spend them?</strong> Vouchers are sent out in regular Clubcard statements, provided you have collected at least 150 points. You can take these into a store and spend them on groceries. To take advantage of Clubcard reward deals you need to go online and use the voucher code to order vouchers for your chosen deal.</p> <p><strong>Are they time limited?</strong> Yes. Vouchers are valid for two years from the date of issue. It is only possible to collect 30,000 points within one collection period.</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.boots.com/en/Advantage-Card/\" title=\"\">Boots Advantage Card</a></h2> <p><strong>Where can points be collected? </strong>On purchases from Boots, either in a store or online, or on purchases made through the <a href=\"http://www.treatstreet.boots.com/ref/pghome_c\" title=\"\">Boots shopping portal</a>.</p> <p><strong>How many points per pound? </strong>The standard rate is four.</p> <p><strong>Can I earn extra points? </strong>Yes. Boots often run bonus points promotions, particularly in the run-up to Christmas. Members of the <a href=\"http://www.boots.com/en/Mother-Baby/Parenting-Club/\" title=\"\">Boots Parenting Club</a> earn 10 points per pound on relevant purchases, while over 60s can sign up to More Treats and get 10 points per pound on Boots-branded products. In-store machines offer vouchers for extra points, as do regular mail-outs to cardholders. Your first purchase through Boots' shopping portal will earn you an extra \u00a32.50 of points.</p> <p><strong>How much are they worth? </strong>Each point is worth 1p.</p> <p><strong>How can I maximise the points' value? </strong>It isn't possible to increase the value.</p> <p><strong>Where can I spend them? </strong>Advantage Card points are only redeemable in Boots stores or online.</p> <p><strong>How can I spend them? </strong>You can spend the points by having your Advantage Card scanned in store, or by selecting the option to pay with your points on the Boots website. You must have enough to cover your entire purchase \u2013 you can't, for example, put \u00a310 of points towards a \u00a320 purchase.</p> <p><strong>Are they time limited?</strong> The is no limit on when you can use Boots Advantage Card points.</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.superdrug.com/beautycard/introducing-the-superdrug-beautycard-your-new-shopping-essential/page/beautycard/\" title=\"\">Superdrug Beautycard</a></h2> <p><strong>Where can points be collected? </strong>In Superdrug branches or online.</p> <p><strong>How many points per pound? </strong>One.</p> <p><strong>Can I earn extra points? </strong>Superdrug run various promotions in store and have further promotions for those who sign up for e-mails, which rotate so it is worth checking their website or in store.</p> <p><strong>How much are they worth? </strong>Each point is worth 1p.</p> <p><strong>How can I maximise the points' value? </strong>The points all have the same value.</p> <p><strong>Where can I spend them? </strong>Only in Superdrug stores \u2013 the scheme has not yet been rolled out to the website. You can use points as part-payment for an item and pay the difference in cash or by card.</p> <p><strong>Are they time limited? </strong>The points are valid for two years, unless the account is inactive for a year when they will also become invalid.</p> <h2><a href=\"https://www.costa.co.uk/coffee-club/\" title=\"\">Costa Coffee Club</a></h2> <p><strong>Where can points be collected? </strong>In participating Costa stores, although some outlets within other businesses, such as Esso garages, opting out.</p> <p><strong>How many points per pound? </strong>Five.</p> <p><strong>Can I earn extra points? </strong>You get an extra 100 points as an initial incentive to register the card. You will also receive regular emails offering bonus points promotions.</p> <p><strong>How much are they worth? </strong>Each point is worth 1p.</p> <p><strong>How can I maximise the points' value? </strong>You can't.</p> <p><strong>Where can I spend them? </strong>Only in Costa Coffee.</p> <p><strong>Are they time limited?</strong> The points don't have a limit, unless the card is inactive for a year or more.</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.waitrose.com/content/waitrose/en/home/mywaitrose/splash_page1.html\" title=\"\">myWaitrose</a></h2> <p>This is less a traditional loyalty card than a membership scheme, which provides customers with exclusive offers tailored to their particular interests.</p> <p>In addition it holds monthly competitions which give the opportunity for one cardholder to win back the value of their entire month's shopping.</p>",
  "<p><strong>BP</strong> has moved higher after reports it has been in talks to sell its Texas City refinery to Marathon Petroleum.</p> <p>The sale could fetch up to $2.5bn, and is part of BP's disposal programme to help cover the costs of the Gulf of Mexico disaster.</p> <p>BP is up 3.65p at 442.6p, with little impact from news that Saudi Arabia might be considering an increase in oil production to help offset some of the recent crude price rises.

The Bank of England seems to have almost run out of ammunition, although the slight fall in inflation yesterday might get them warming the printing presses again before too long, especially since their counterparts have commenced some bolder measures than previously; they won't want to be seen to be doing nothing.  Then there's the People's Bank of China, who have been monitoring the slow decline of their booming economy and won't want to be left out when everyone else seems to be enjoying the party. </blockquote> <p>Investors are also nervous about Spain, and the prospect of the country asking for a bailout.

So much was already known \u2013 a longer, larger (yet not wider) screen, thinner body, a new connector offering instant obsolescence for hundreds of accessories \u2013 that its Tom Daley-like lack of splash was declared, in this Olympic year, to lack enough of the technology motto citius, grandior, vilius (faster, bigger, cheaper) \u2013 even if it is the first two.</p> <p>Like statisticians poring over Olympic outcomes, they declared too that it didn't break any records \u2013 not the biggest screen, not the world's thinnest phone, not packing the most features. But as anyone who watched the Games would tell you, it's not the record-breaking that matters; it's the experience.</p> <p>That starts when you hold it: raw specifications (18% thinner than last year's 4S, 20% lighter, 12% less volume) don't explain how it seems to float in the hand, and how typing or swiping feels like touching the very pixels. (New processes have removed one layer of glass from the touchscreen.) The tactile pleasure is second only to Nokia's beguilingly curved (and largely overlooked) Lumia 800. And while the 4in screen is longer, but not wider (enough for six rows of icons rather than five), you can still swipe across it with your thumb, unlike giants such as Samsung's whopping 4.8in Galaxy S3. </p> <h2>Software and services, not just specs</h2> <p>In truth, it's the software that makes this phone amazing. In a world dominated by \"specifications\" \u2013 how fast, how far, how many, many commentators think the Olympics of smartphones is measured, like a race, by how fast you do things. Does this phone run at 1.6 GHz and that one at 1.61GHz? Award the medal! </p> <p>What photos and specifications can't tell you is what it's like to hold in your hand. While Apple can show you endless photos and promo videos (and critics can endlessly snort at how feeble its measurements are compared with bigger rivals), it's only by picking it up do you understand what Sir Jonathan Ive is on about. He speaks in his quietly rapturous tones about \"chamfered edges\" and \"unique object\" \u2013 and \"seamlessly\". (And \"aluminium\", correctly.)</p> <p>The first surprise is that it's really light, making the year-old iPhone 4S feel like a paperweight. There's also a subtle friction to the edges and the metal back that makes it far less likely to slip from your grasp (a complaint often made of the iPhone 4 and 4S). </p> <p>Next, although the screen is longer (4in diagonally rather than the 4S's 3.5in; 1136x640 pixels, compared with the 4S's 960x640, both at 326ppi), fitting in six rows of icons instead of five, you can still operate it by sweeping one thumb across the screen, from home button at the bottom to power switch at the top. </p> <p>Among smartphones, bigger screens abound, but most are compromised because as they grow, they need two hands to operate. Somehow Apple has evaded this pitfall. The HTC Titan, for example, with a 4.7in screen, is unusable because (like the iPhone) its power button is on the top; you can't hold a phone in your palm and still reach all the way across the top. (In contrast the Samsung Galaxy S3 \u2013 hereafter the SGS3 \u2013 has its power button near the top of the right-hand side, so you can work it.)</p> <p>Another element you can't see from the pictures: when you start typing, or swiping between apps, it feels as though you're touching the pixels; the production process has eliminated a layer of glass in the touchscreen. It's spooky at first; after only a short while other phones feel thick.</p> <h2>Down from the iCloud</h2> <p>For existing iPhone owners who have an iCloud account to which they have backed up their phone, there's a nice welcome that didn't exist last year. If you activate a new iPhone with that iCloud account, you can set it up with everything \u2013 including photos, apps, settings and passwords for email and calendars and Wi-Fi, and even details such as your alarm times. </p> <p>Everything is as it was on the old one, seamlessly. That's better than either Android or Windows Phone, the two principal contenders, which will download your apps but leave you to fill in the settings and recreate your alarms and app settings. </p> <p>Sure, you might not set up an iPhone more than once every couple of years \u2013 but having it work like this (new since last year, because iCloud backups were only introduced with the 4S) is a definite plus.</p> <h2>4G/LTE, battery life and signal level</h2> <p>In the UK, only Everything Everywhere (Orange/T-Mobile) will have <strong>4G connectivity</strong> at least until 2013, when 3 will have some of its 1800MHz spectrum. I couldn't test this as I was using an O2-enabled model (and couldn't just swap in my own Orange/T-Mobile SIM, because the iPhone 5 uses the new nano-SIM). The expectation is that it will offer connectivity of up to 100Mbps over long distances; if it does, it will transform the whole experience of using this phone and others like it, as you'll see.</p> <p>I couldn't directly compare <strong>signal reception</strong> of the 4S and 5 because the two models I was comparing were on different networks (Orange and O2), rendering any comparison moot.</p> <p><strong>Battery life</strong> on the iPhone 5 seemed better, though it wasn't possible in the time available to make a precise comparison. Apple is certainly promising more \u2013 225 hours' standby time on the iPhone 5 against 200 on the iPhone 4S, though that's still less than the 300 hours originally offered for the iPhone 4. But it's promising more 3G browsing and talk time (8 hours v 6 hours), plus 8 hours of LTE use \u2013 which is colossal, given that early versions of LTE chewed through battery life. By biding its time and not offering it last year, Apple may have given itself the best chance to benefit from 4G. But the proof of the pudding will be in the eating.</p> <p>The flipside \u2013 how quickly it charges, rather than discharges \u2013 is positive: the iPhone 5 is a power sponge, charging even more quickly than the 4S, which was no slouch itself.</p> <h2>Panoramic camera</h2> <p>The \"Panorama\" camera functionality is truly remarkable. Start moving the camera, take a picture, and it will keep going until you have a 28MP scene. Yes, other cameras have had panorama systems \u2013 including, yes, Samsung. Those limit you to staying in one place and moving the camera around. This is different: you can move yourself, you can move around or up and down and object, or whirl completely around \u2013 360 degrees of freedom. Then once you're done, the software stitches it together, with no fisheye distortion and no stitching. I tried circumnavigating a colleague's head, and whirling the phone around in a field: the results are really interesting. </p> <p>I anticipate devices to which you can strap a panorama-capturing iPhone that will keep steady, or macro pictures showing things in huge details. One <a href=\"https://twitter.com/counternotions/status/246113055463854080\">sardonic tweet</a> after the iPhone 5's introduction, looking at the billion-dollar valuation put on photo-sharing service Instagram by Facebook, said \"Don't call yourself an entrepreneur if you haven't yet formed your next startup, Panoramagram\". You laugh now. All I can say is: just wait. And if you make picture frames, expect some orders.</p> <h2>Maps and mapping</h2> <p>The news in May that <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2012/may/11/apple-maps-io6-google\">Google was sidelined as the provider of maps for the iPhone</a> (in any phone that runs iOS 6, to be released later on Wednesday 19 September) caused a fair amount of hand-wringing and worry. Would it be as good? Or would it just use some in-between rubbish?</p> <p>Don't worry \u2013 it's very good. Here we need to distinguish between the maps themselves, and the maps app. The maps don't have all the highlighting of Google's, but the amount of detail such as road names seems to me greater. The 3D view (which you can yaw by sliding two fingers up or down on either end of the screen) is entertaining \u2013 more so if you turn on the satellite imagery \u2013 and you can also rotate the maps with two fingers, or bring them back to true north by tapping a compass. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396376924\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Technology/Pix/pictures/2012/9/18/1348005686940/maps-guardian-view.png\" alt=\"Guardian viewed on iPhone 5\" width=\"460\" height=\"817\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Guardian offices in London viewed on the new iOS 6 software on the iPhone 5</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: guardian.co.uk</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>That all brings feature parity with Android \u2013 as does the introduction of turn-by-turn voice navigation, so that your satnav can now play music and make or receive phone calls.</p> <h2>Hello, Siri</h2> <p>What really catapults the iPhone 5 past its rivals is the combination of features and services. In particular Siri, the voice-driven \"assistant\", is transformed in the UK from something quite useful for sending texts or emails, or making phone calls without unlocking the phone, into a real virtual assistant. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396376925\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Technology/Pix/pictures/2012/9/18/1348005839328/siri_on_football.png\" alt=\"Siri does football on iOS6\" width=\"460\" height=\"817\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Siri knows football scores on iOS6 running on the iPhone 5</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: guardian.co.uk</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In its new incarnation, Siri can find and book restaurants (or subvariants \u2013 you want Thai restaurants, it will find them) near you, tell you football scores, offer turn-by-turn navigation to anywhere, open apps (handy if your phone has so many you can't find them), post comments to Twitter or Facebook, and find film times and reviews. (It does other stuff too including weather forecasts and stock prices.)</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396376926\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Technology/Pix/pictures/2012/9/18/1348006060594/siri_on_cricket.png\" alt=\"Siri can't do cricket\" width=\"230\" height=\"162\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Siri can't do everything: cricket flummoxes it still</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: guardian.co.uk</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I've been using an iPhone for the past few months, after about a year only using Android phones, and found the earlier incarnation of Siri increasingly useful. For example on Monday I had to make a number of calls and send texts while driving. Sure, anyone can make voice-dialled calls with a Bluetooth headset. But write texts? From a locked screen? With a headphone/mic combination, I could. You dictate, Siri translates, reads it back, and will then send when you say \"send it\". </p> <p>But the new one is dramatically better. Here's why. Until this month, if you wanted to find a nearby restaurant, you'd have to unlock your phone, go to the browser, type in \"restaurants\", and hope that you'd get some related results in your search. Or you might have had an app like TopTable, where you'd still have to type in some details and wait for a response.</p> <p>With Siri now, you simply say \"Find Thai restaurants near here\". It thinks for a bit and comes back with a list. I tried this even in my rural location \u2013 and it offered six, five of which I didn't know existed. (Sadly, a Siri-driven restaurant reservation system is only available in the US, Canada and Mexico. Ay caramba!)</p> <p>Or you need to get directions to a location: you tell Siri \"give me directions to\u2026\" and, after some ruminating, it will transform into a satnav. So now you've got a satnav that can play music and make and take phone calls \u2013 it will interrupt those with directions as needed. (As a security note, it might be a good idea to use a different name for your home than \"Home\", just to avoid opportunist thieves navigating back to your house.)</p> <p>Siri is voice control done right, because you don't need to think about the context of what you're asking; you simply give the command and it works it out. True, it doesn't transcribe everything perfectly, but then typing on a keyboard isn't perfect either. It will do football results (and it doesn't think that's American football), so \"what are the football results from this weekend\" gives you the Premier League results. Or you can be specific \u2013 \"did Tottenham Hotspur win?\" (But nothing's perfect: \"did Spurs win\" gives you details of some American football team, and for now, at least, rugby and cricket fans are out of luck.)</p> <h2>Video</h2> <p>The iPhone 5 gets a rear camera capable of 1080p video recording, during which you can also shoot stills. (Some Android phones, including the SGS3, have had this for a while.) The front-facing camera gets 720p recording, and FaceTime \u2013 Apple's video call protocol \u2013 works on both Wi-Fi and mobile, if your carrier allows it.</p> <h2>Do Not Disturb, and other messages</h2> <p>iOS6 introduces the idea of Do Not Disturb \u2013 times between which you don't want phone calls or notifications such as texts to bother you, although you can elect to let those numbers picked as \"Favourites\" through at once, and determined callers on the second call.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396376927\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Technology/Pix/pictures/2012/9/18/1348006226427/reject_call_ios.png\" alt=\"Rejecting a call on iOS6\" width=\"460\" height=\"817\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rejecting an incoming call on iOS6 on the iPhone 5: sliding up the \"reject\" icon on the right offers three pre-written messages, or you can send a custom one</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: guardian.co.uk</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Similarly, when someone calls and you can't respond, you get a choice of rejecting the call, or sending a pre-prepared text message from a selection, or creating one on the spot \u2013 all from the lock screen if needed. Yes, HTC and Samsung have offered this already. This is an elegant implementation, though. </p> <h2>Let them Passbook</h2> <p>The growing number of QR-style tickets and other items that accrue in one's email inbox can seem alarming. Apart from anything, they're difficult to find and organise (we've all had the moment running a server search on our email for that ticket at the airport or rail check-in, surely?). The answer that some companies are trying to push is NFC, or near-field communications. Apple's answer however is not NFC but Passbook, an app which collects special versions of those tickets (they're not just email attachments). </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396376928\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Technology/Pix/pictures/2012/9/18/1348008141611/passbook-_vouchers_lots.png\" alt=\"Passbook on iOS 6: lots of vouchers\" width=\"300\" height=\"533\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Passbook on iOS6 on the iPhone 5 pulls together vouchers and tickets from different companies and locations</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: guardian.co.uk</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The \"passes\" can be location-sensitive, and show in your lock screen (convenient). It wasn't possible to test this (developers have yet to write many apps, though it will only be a matter of time) but the interaction is very smooth. Certainly, not having to dig through emails will be a bonus.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396376929\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Technology/Pix/pictures/2012/9/18/1348008379934/passbook-_voucher.png\" alt=\"Passbook voucher on iOS 6\" width=\"300\" height=\"533\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Passbook voucher on iOS6 on iPhone 5</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: guardian.co.uk</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Almost all shall have updates</h2> <p>If you bought an iPhone 4S last year, most of the improvements in software from the iPhone 5 are available to you too. From Wednesday, the new iOS software is available for any of the iPhones released since 2009 (3GS, 4, 4S), as well as the second-generation iPad and iPad 3. </p> <p>That brings many of the software features to those older handsets free of charge (though not all; Siri and Panorama are only for the iPhone 5 and 4S, for example) \u2013 and it will all happen at once. While Android users who have the newest phones can certainly boast that they have had better software than Apple (particularly on the mapping side, where turn-by-turn has been standard for two years), many are stuck waiting for their operator, or handset maker, or both, to update their handsets to newer software. (Google's own statistics show that <a href=\"http://developer.android.com/about/dashboards/index.html\">57% of Android phones that connect to its Google Play service use Android 2.3</a>, released late in 2010.) </p> <p>Now, Siri in particular is dramatically better than anything on offer on Android \u2013 and shows that Apple is sliding, ever so subtly, to a world where the screen plays second fiddle to other functions. </p> <h2>Only connect</h2> <p>Oh, that new connector. By dumping the 30-pin analogue connector it had been using since 2003 (introduced to connect either to FireWire or USB 2.0 sockets, as iPods did) for its 9-pin digital \"Lightning\" Apple has caused gigantic upheaval in the accessories market. Though a 9-digital-to-30-analogue adaptor does exist, it will <a href=\"http://store.apple.com/uk/product/MD823ZM/A/lightning-to-30-pin-adapter?fnode=48\">cost \u00a325</a>, so you'll probably not want many. But Apple seems to be directing accessories companies towards wireless connections such as its AirPlay system \u2013 and accessory makers meanwhile have decided that 30-pin is dead: they've already switching almost their whole production (save 20% or so) over to the 9-pin connector.</p> <p>Happily, the 9-pin can be plugged in either way, halving your chances of frustration while plugging in the USB lead. Obsolescence is ugly \u2013 no other word for it \u2013 but Apple is never one to be tied to the past.</p> <h2>Conclusions</h2> <p>It's worth recalling that a smartphone isn't a package of specifications. It's that, plus features (the software that drives the onboard camera, say) and services (such as the software that runs Siri or the maps). Those who were quick to dismiss the iPhone 5 based on its specifications \u2013 but no experience with its features or services \u2013 made the mistake of thinking that a phone is just components. But it's the gestalt that makes it a pleasant experience \u2013 or otherwise. For those who insist on NFC, or direct access to the phone's file system, or the option of opening web pages in multiple different browsers, the iPhone and iOS will never be satisfactory. </p> <p>But Apple doesn't care. Steve Jobs <a href=\"http://www.zdnet.com/news/new-os-x-headlines-jobs-keynote/104976\">once said</a> that interfaces which spawned a lot of windows meant that \"you get to be the janitor\" \u2013 a post he didn't relish. Android lets you be the janitor, air-conditioning chief and managing director; the iPhone lets you be the user. It's a key difference in philosophy. You can't do as much on the iPhone \u2013 but sometimes fewer choices mean faster decisions. Siri in particular is a revelation; expect to hear much more of its C#-listening-to-G#-acting pings around you.</p> <p>As for the iPhone 5, it's a lovely piece of equipment. Boring? Lacking wow? With its market value now crossing $700bn and iPhone 5 pre-orders through the roof, Apple might disagree.</p>",

  "<p>The official definition of domestic violence is to be changed from March to ensure that thousands of teenage victims who are abused while in a relationship get the help and support they need, ministers are to announce today. It is also to be widened to explicitly include \"coercive control\", which is defined as complex patterns of abuse by one partner using power and psychological control over another, such as financial, verbal abuse or enforced social isolation.</p> <p>The current single definition of domestic violence as \"any incident of threatening behaviour, or abuse between adults who are or have been intimate partners or family members, regardless of gender or sexuality\" was introduced in 2004. It is not a statutory definition but it is used by government departments, crown prosecutors, the police and immigration authorities to identify domestic violence cases and ensure they get access to help for them to escape an abusive relationship. The definition covers so-called \"honour violence\", female genital mutilation and forced marriage but teenagers aged 16 to 18 are currently excluded.</p> <p>However, the British Crime Survey has recently found that young people are more likely to suffer partner abuse than any other age group, with 12.7% of women and 6.2% of men aged 16-19 having experienced some kind of domestic abuse in the last year.</p> <p>The Home Office says that anecdotal evidence shows there are worrying high levels of acceptance of abuse in teenage relationships: \"At present, domestic violence committed against a person under 18 would be considered child abuse by most services. Whilst this may be appropriate for children experiencing parental or family-based violence, there is the suggestion that the nature of teenage relationships is often more similar to relationships between adults and as such could be considered an extension of adult domestic violence.\"</p> <p>It adds that recent research shows that more fluid, less narrow labels are needed to describe teenage relationships, in which a \"date\" can take many forms and non-cohabiting couples are far more likely than in adult relationships.</p> <p>A survey of teenagers in 2009 by the children's charity NSPCC found that 75% of girls experienced some form of emotional abuse, 33% of girls experienced some form of sexual abuse and 25% some form of physical abuse. Three-quarters of the girls surveyed who had a partner at least two years older than themselves said they had experienced some form of physical violence.</p> <p>A Home Office impact assessment has estimated that as many as 5,280 high-risk teenage girls could be referred to multi-agency panels involving the police, domestic violence advisers, children's services, health and housing professionals, as a result of the move to improve their safety.</p> <p>Nick Clegg, the deputy prime minister, said the true face of domestic violence was much more complex and more widespread than people often realised. \"Suffering at the hands of people who are meant to care for you is horrific at any age. But it can be especially damaging for young people \u2013 the scars can last for a lifetime.\" He said that frontline campaigners, the police and councils had called for the new definition so they could provide victims with the right support.</p> <p>Clegg added that the message was \"even if you are young, even if what you experience isn't one single act of violence, you do not have to put up with abuse. There is help out there for you.</p> <p>\"And to the perpetrators the message is equally simple: what you're doing is wrong and won't be tolerated.\"</p>",

If nobody leaves, because they make contact with them, nobody will get paid.\"</p> <p>In July, immigration inspectors disclosed for the first time <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/jul/05/migrants-denied-uk-stay-missing\" title=\"\">the existence of a backlog of tens of thousands of cases</a> involving people who have been refused permission to stay in Britain but whose whereabouts are unknown to the authorities.</p> <p>The chief inspector of borders and immigration, John Vine, said at the time that he had discovered the existence of the UK Border Agency's national \"migration refusal pool\" during his first inspection of a local immigration team.</p> <p>After his inspection of the Hampshire and Isle of Wight immigration team, Vine said staff reported it being impossible to know whether more than 150,000 migrants who had been refused permission to stay were still in Britain or had left voluntarily.</p> <p>Officials at the UKBA admitted about 40% of those in the \"refusal pool\" had not even been formally served with the documents informing them that they had to leave Britain within 28 days.</p> <p>The shadow immigration minister, Chris Bryant, called on the home secretary to provide more details of the contract awarded to Capita, saying: \"The whole point of a payment by results contract is that you define success for it before it starts. UK Border Agency has revealed that Capita will get \u00a340m from the taxpayer if meets its targets, but UKBA doesn't seem to have any idea of what would constitute a success.</p> <p>\"In a time of austerity, the UKBA and the home secretary should be able to demonstrate that they are providing value of money to the taxpayer.\"</p>"
