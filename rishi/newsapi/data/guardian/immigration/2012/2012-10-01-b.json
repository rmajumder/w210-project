  "<p>The club was founded on 1 January 1991 under the name Farum Boldklub, a merger of Farum Idraetsklub and Stavnsholt FC, and began life in the seventh tier of Danish football. They became FC Nordsjaelland in 2003 after a local businessman, Allan Pedersen, took the club over from the former owner Peter Brixtofte.</p> <p>The Danish champions boast a Laudrup in their ranks \u2013 Andreas Laudrup, Michael's youngest son. The 21-year-old is an attacking midfielder who joined Nordsjaelland in 2009.</p> <p>Nordsjaelland's match against Chelsea will take place at Parken Stadium, the home of FC Copenhagen. The venue holds 38,000 people, which is 18,000 more than the entire population of Farum, the town where the club are based.</p> <p>Long-standing immigration has made Farum a diverse town; over 50 different languages are spoken there, with the majority of the immigrant population being Turkish.</p> <p>Nordsjaelland's nickname is the \"Wild Tigers\" and to help maintain the theme the club's principal colours are red and orange.</p>",
  "<p>The number of eligible Latino voters has reached a historic high, with almost 24 million able to participate in November's presidential election, an increase of 4 million over the previous ballot in 2008.</p> <p>The new figures, <a href=\"http://www.pewhispanic.org/2012/10/01/trends-in-latino-voter-registration/\">released by the Pew Hispanic Center</a>, underline the seismic demographic shift that is transforming the electoral landscape of the US. Over the past 20 years the number of Latinos eligible to vote has grown steadily and steeply, from 8.3 million in 1992 to 14.5 million in 2002 and 23.7 million in 2012 \u2013 some 11% of the current electorate.</p> <p>That is in turn a reflection of the growing numeric presence of Hispanics, who now stand as America's largest minority. Last year Latinos accounted for almost 17% of the population \u2013 some 52 million people.</p> <p>But Pew's research also underscores the unfulfilled nature of Latino political power. In 2008, only half those entitled to vote actually cast their ballots \u2013 a participation rate well beneath that of African Americans (65%) and whites (66%).</p> <p>The turnout of Hispanics in November could be even lower, as Census Bureau data suggests that the number of Latinos who are registered to vote actually declined by 600,000 between 2008 and 2010. Pew suggests the slump could be explained by a tailing off of political interest following the exceptional enthusiasm engendered by Obama's first run for the White House four years ago.</p> <p>It could also have something to do with the economic downturn. Many Hispanic families have been forced to move home because of foreclosures since the collapse of 2008, which in turn would have caused many of them to lose their electoral registration.</p> <p>Looked another way, though, and the statistics spell enormous potential rewards for any politician or political party who manages to release the Latino genie from the bottle. If Hispanic Americans can be persuaded that it is worth their while to turn up on election day, then there is room for a massive mobilisation of new voters.</p> <p>That is particularly the case in three vital swing states \u2013 Florida, which has more than 2 million eligible Hispanic voters, or 16% of the total; Colorado, with almost 500,000 (14%); and Nevada with 270,000 (15%). President Obama has been actively courting the Hispanic vote this year, with the introduction of a procedural change that allows young undocumented Latinos to apply for a two-year postponement of the threat of deportation.</p> <p>On the other hand, there is a further weakening of Hispanic political power because families are concentrated in states that are not significant battlegrounds this election cycle. More than half of all potential Latino voters live in three states that are not in play this November \u2013 firmly Democratic California and New York, and firmly Republican Texas.</p>",
  "<!-- Block 1 --> <p><strong>Preamble:</strong> Mark Hughes hasn't enjoyed the best of times since taking the reins at Loftus Road. QPR were perhaps fortunate to escape the drop last season and have yet to win a league game this term. Bottom of the table and in desperate need of a positive result this evening, QPR host West Ham who make the trip to Loftus Road from east to west London. Hughes has brought a number of new faces into his squad but the influx of players has been reflected in fragmented performances. Can they turn the corner tonight?</p> <!-- Block 2 --> <p>Andy Carroll is on the bench for West Ham while Rangers start with Djibril Cisse and Bobby Zamora up front.</p> <!-- Block 3 --> <p><strong>QPR:</strong> Julio Cesar, Hill, Nelsen, Mbia, Onuoha, Wright-Phillips, Granero, Faurlin, Park, Zamora, Cisse. <strong>Subs:</strong> Green, Diakite, Taarabt, Mackie, Ephraim, Hoilett, Ehmer.</p> <!-- Block 4 --> <p><strong>West Ham:</strong> Jaaskelainen, Demel, Reid, Collins, O'Brien, Noble, Diame, Vaz Te, Nolan, Jarvis, Cole. <strong>Subs:</strong> Henderson, McCartney, Tomkins, Carroll, Maiga, Benayoun, O'Neil.</p> <!-- Block 5 --> <p>The referee tonight is <strong>Mark Clattenburg</strong>.</p> <!-- Block 6 --> <p>Hughes has spoken of cutting out the lapses in concentration that have dogged QPR's campaign so far. Reading capitalised on that in the last game at Loftus Road in the League Cup, coming from behind in dramatic style to nick a 3-2 victory. In the league, Hughes's side have drawn here 0-0 against Chelsea and were hammered 5-0 by Swansea on the opening day.</p> <!-- Block 7 --> <p>\"Fans at West Ham are interested in the passion of the player and the commitment of the player, rather than all that pretty football stuff,\" Sam Allardyce <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2012/sep/30/sam-allardyce-west-ham\">told the Guardian in this interview</a>. If the results keep coming, he may have a point, but Allardyce's side were jeered following their 4-1 defeat to Wigan in the League Cup and if the defeats keep coming, then the manager's style will always be the first issue that springs to the forefront of unhappy fans' minds. Since their excellent performance against Fulham at the beginning of September, West Ham have drawn twice and lost once. Carroll inspired them on that occasion, will he get another chance this evening?</p> <!-- Block 8 -->  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396996303\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2010/04/08/email.gif\" alt=\"Live blog: email\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong>Matt Dony:</strong> <em>\"Hughes' problem is simply that he hasn't bought enough players. A few new faces, and those lapses in concentration will clear right up.\"</em></p> <p>Very good, Matt.</p> <!-- Block 9 --> <p>I've always thought Park was a peculiar choice for the QPR captaincy. Can't imagine him inspiring or motivating in the dressing room.</p> <!-- Block 10 --> <p>I also think Jaaskelainen and Collins have been liabilities for the Hammers so far this season. Although Vaz-Te has looked a shining light.</p> <!-- Block 11 --> <p><strong>The teams are out from the tunnel and we are just a few minutes away from kick-off...</strong></p> <!-- Block 12 --> <p><strong>The game kicks-off</strong></p> <!-- Block 13 --> <p><strong>1 min:</strong> We're off! Let's see who settles first here. West Ham pressing down their left inn the opening minute. Will QPR's makeshift defence have enough to keep them at bay this evening?</p> <!-- Block 14 --> <p><strong>2 min:</strong> Vaz-Te and Demel looking to combine down the right flank for the Hammers, but Clint Hill does well to deal with the danger. A swift counter for Rangers is on the cards and Cisse looks to stretch his legs out wide right, he's checked and the home side have a free-kick that Granero stands over. He whips it forward but Cole is there on the edge of the area to clear under little pressure.</p> <!-- Block 15 --> <p><strong>GOAL! QPR 0-1 West Ham (Jarvis, 3)</strong></p> <!-- Block 16 --> <p>Oh dear, that is woeful defending from QPR. Nolan shanked his shot from inside the area but it looped to the far post, and there was Jarvis to nod home his first goal for the club. Where was the marking? Simply awful from QPR.</p> <!-- Block 17 --> <p><strong>6 min:</strong> Credit to Vaz Te for some persistent work in the build-up to that goal, but can QPR respond? Onuoha looks to make some ground down the right but the home side look bereft of confidence and composure at the moment.</p> <!-- Block 18 --> <p><strong>8 min:</strong> Nolan is at the heart of every West Ham move, just as he has been all season. An opportunity for QPR now, Wright-Phillips surging down the right flank and curling a delicious low cross into the area. Cisse looks to latch onto it ... but it's too far in front of the Frenchman and behind for a corner, which is headed away.</p> <!-- Block 19 --> <p><strong>9 min:</strong> Carlton Cole is penalised for a shove on Clint Hill, but Sam Allardyce won't mind that the big striker is putting his weight about. The camera pans to Andy Carroll on the bench, such good news for West Ham fans that he is recovered in less than a month from that injury sustained against Fulham.</p> <!-- Block 20 --> <p><strong>11 min:</strong> Diame breaks free of his marker in midfield, getting goalside of Wright-Phillips, he pulls the trigger from 25 yards ... it takes a deflection off Ryan Nelsen and behind for a corner. For a moment it looked to be looping over Cesar and into the net.</p> <!-- Block 21 --> <p><strong>12 min:</strong> Good tracking back from the energetic Mark Noble, going shoulder to shoulder with Cisse down on the touchline. QPR have seen most of the ball since that opening goal, but look vulnerable at the back whenever the Hammers swarm forward.</p> <!-- Block 22 --> <p><strong>13 min:</strong> Nice play from Esteban Granero, who starts a move in the West Ham half, spraying the ball wide for Wright-Phillips, before receiving it back on the edge of the area and hitting a first-time half-volley from just inside the area that flew over. That's more like it from the Hoops, and the move warranted a better finish.</p> <!-- Block 23 --> <p><strong>15 min:</strong> It's very tight and congested in the middle of the park, with little room to manoeuvre. Cisse attempts a low shot from the edge of the area on the right-hand side, saved and held low down by Jaaskelainen. Will we see another of Jussi's howlers this evening I wonder?</p> <!-- Block 24 --> <p><strong>16 min:</strong> QPR have yet to score a home goal in the Premier League this season but there have been encouraging signs so far. Cisse has been relatively lively, although to be fair, Zamora has hardly touched the ball.</p> <!-- Block 25 --> <p><strong>18 min:</strong> Just as I say that, Zamora gets on the ball, but he's in the centre of midfield and not up front \u2013 what on earth is he doing so deep? Mark Noble is penalised for a foul on the striker, but that has never been an infringement in a million years. Excellent, dogged tracking from the West Ham midfielder.</p> <!-- Block 26 --> <p><strong>19 min:</strong> Joey O'Brien hacks down Wright-Phillips just outside his own area. That's a definite free-kick, and the left-back is lucky not to go into the book there.</p> <!-- Block 27 --> <p><strong>20 min:</strong> Granero whips the ball into the area and after a scramble on the line, it's hacked away! Let-off for West Ham that and the game is stopped as Winston Reid is out cold following a nasty collision with the goalkeeper Jaaskelainen...</p> <!-- Block 28 --> <p><strong>22 min:</strong> Reid hasn't moved for a while, but he is talking and seems OK. He isn't going to continue, though, and the medics are preparing a neck brace I think. James Tomkins to come on.</p> <!-- Block 29 -->  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396996302\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2010/04/09/substitution.gif\" alt=\"Live blog: substitution\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong>West Ham sub: Reid off, Tomkins on</strong></p> <!-- Block 30 --> <p><strong>25 min:</strong> So Tomkins drops in alongside Collins at centre-half. That should encourage QPR and they immediately try to capitalise on the change, Wright-Phillips clipping a neat ball over the top, but Jaaskelainen is out quickly to claim low down. Andy Carroll is warming up down on the touchline.</p> <!-- Block 31 --> <p><strong>26 min:</strong> Excellent move from West Ham as Demel slips in Nolan with a disguised pass, the captain checks back and chips a cross into the centre where Diame leaps ... headed away! It almost falls to Carlton Cole but QPR desperately manage to clear.</p> <!-- Block 32 --> <p><strong>27 min:</strong> Cisse has a shot in anger from 25 yards out. It flies well over the bar and never in danger of troubling Jaaskelainen. That sums up QPR's frustration at the moment. Loftus Road is pretty flat.</p> <!-- Block 33 --> <p><strong>29 min:</strong> Sky reporting that Winston Reid is completely fine in the away dressing room. He was out cold for a few seconds after that collision with his goalkeeper, but won't need to go to hospital for further assessment.</p> <!-- Block 34 --> <p><strong>30 min:</strong> O'Brien scrapping and fighting for possession and territory down the left flank, he does well to advance past Wright-Phillips and into an attacking position but following a lay-off from Cole, runs the ball out for a goal-kick.</p> <!-- Block 35 --> <p><strong>32 min:</strong> Cole is in a wee bit of pain following a tussle with Nelsen. It looks like he has take one in the ribs and might be winded. No foul given by referee Clattenburg, who incidentally recently paid \u00a310,000 for a hair transplant.</p> <!-- Block 36 --> <p><strong>33 min:</strong> West Ham are the side in the ascendancy right now. O'Brien launches a long throw into the area and although Cole is off balance, he gets the foot on the ball only for it to evade a fellow claret and blue shirt.</p> <!-- Block 37 --> <p><strong>34 min:</strong> Granero is penalised for a foul on Nolan, and Clattenburg isn't happy with his show of dissent. Still no cards though and Noble stands over the free-kick. It looks as though West Ham are going to make another enforced defensive change here, with George McCartney stripped and ready.</p> <!-- Block 38 -->  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396996301\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2010/04/09/substitution.gif\" alt=\"Live blog: substitution\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong>West Ham sub:</strong> McCartney on, O'Brien off.</p> <!-- Block 39 --> <p><strong>GOAL! QPR 0-2 West Ham (Vaz-Te, 35)</strong></p> <!-- Block 40 --> <p>Vaz-Te doubles West Ham's lead but again it is terrible defending from the home side. After an almighty scramble in the six-yard box Tomkins lifted the ball into the far post and there was Vaz-Te to prod home past Cesar at his near post. Appalling defending, and worse goalkeeping!</p> <!-- Block 41 --> <p><strong>37 min:</strong> Collins is let off the hook after missing an interception just six yards from his own goal, Demel getting in with a crucial challenge to deny Cisse!</p> <!-- Block 42 --> <p><strong>39 min:</strong> The first player into the book is West Ham's <strong>Mohamed Diame</strong>, yellow-carded for a cynical tug on the breaking Shaun Wright-Phillips.</p> <!-- Block 43 --> <p><strong>40 min:</strong> Fine save Jaaskelainen to deny Cisse! From the resulting free-kick the ball fell to the French striker on the edge of the opposition area, he tries an acrobatic half-volley that was flying into the roof of the net, only for the keeper to tip over!</p> <!-- Block 44 --> <p><strong>42 min:</strong> West Ham are just looking to shut-up shop and get into the interval with a two-goal advantage. QPR have been abysmal at the back and immediately after the second goal, the camera cut to Rob Green on the bench. To be fair, I don't think he would have done any better than Cesar with Vaz-Te's effort.</p> <!-- Block 45 --> <p><strong>43 min:</strong> Zamora gets a firm head on the ball from the edge of the area, but he sends it well over Jaaskelainen's bar. Playing against his former club, the big man has hardly been involved so far. Decent cross in from the right though.</p> <!-- Block 46 --> <p><strong>44 min:</strong> Noble lines up a shot from 30 yards ... it deflects off Nelsen and flies narrowly over!</p> <!-- Block 47 --> <p><strong>45 min:</strong> Five added minutes to be played at the end of the first-half following that earlier injury to Reid.</p> <!-- Block 48 --> <p><strong>45+1 min:</strong> Cisse feeds in Zamora, that's the first time those two have linked up so far I think, and big Bobby opens up his body only to see his shot deflected well over. Corner.</p> <!-- Block 49 --> <p><strong>45+3 min:</strong> The corner is an abject effort that drifts over everyone's head and West Ham have a bit of respite now.</p> <!-- Block 50 --> <p><strong>45+5 min:</strong> Terrible challenge from Mark Noble on Granero earns him a yellow card. That was high and reckless. Chance for QPR to have a pop here...</p> <!-- Block 51 --> <p><strong>45+6 min:</strong> Granero lifts it to the far post where Mbia nods it across goal, but the flag goes up for offside. Very poor.</p> <!-- Block 52 --> <p><strong>The whistle goes for half-time. West Ham are 2-0 up at the interval and look good value for their lead.</strong></p> <!-- Block 53 -->  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396996300\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2010/04/08/email.gif\" alt=\"Live blog: email\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong>Simon McMahon:</strong> \"<em>Evening James.

Noble trots over to take it and hangs it up to the far post, but Tomkins can't win the header. Still, a second corner for the Hammers.</p> <!-- Block 58 --> <p><strong>47 min:</strong> Again the ball is aimed at Tomkins on the edge of the six-yard box but he jumps to early and completely misses it. QPR need to get a foothold in this game and fast.</p> <!-- Block 59 --> <p><strong>48 min:</strong> Excellent work from Jarvis who cuts into the area down the left, drifts a lovely ball across which eventually falls to Diame to hit viciously on the half-volley ... palmed away by Cesar! Good period of pressure this from West Ham and they could be out of sight.</p> <!-- Block 60 --> <p><strong>50 min:</strong> Granero and Faurlin are fine technical players but they have simply been outfought in the middle of the park tonight. Noble has been terrific, and Diame alongside him has thundered into every challenge.</p> <!-- Block 61 --> <p><strong>51 min:</strong> QPR have hardly seen the ball in this second half. Zamora and Cisse are on different wavelengths and the home full-backs are being peppered with balls down the channels. Still, there is always the potential for a cock up by Collins or Jaaskelainen...</p> <!-- Block 62 --> <p><strong>53 min:</strong> Mbia adjudged to have been eased out of the way illegally by Carlton Cole in the QPR area. A bit harsh, that, but Clattenburg was never going to let that slide given the possible implications.</p> <!-- Block 63 --> <p><strong>54 min:</strong> Adel Taarabt, just back from injury, is warming up on the touchline and could be introduced pretty soon. At the moment QPR are devoid of creativity or any potency in the final third.</p> <!-- Block 64 --> <p><strong>55 min:</strong> Double change coming up for Rangers...</p> <!-- Block 65 -->  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396996297\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2010/04/09/substitution.gif\" alt=\"Live blog: substitution\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong>QPR subs:</strong> Taarabt and Diakite on, Park and Wright-Phillips off.</p> <!-- Block 66 --> <p><strong>GOAL! QPR 1-2 West Ham (Taarabt, 57)</strong></p> <!-- Block 67 --> <p>It's an immediate impact for the substitute Taarabt! Wonderful goal from him, cutting inside off the left flank, beating his man and making half a yard before curling a fine shot from 25 yards past the static Jaaskelainen. He is booked for his celebration.</p> <!-- Block 68 --> <p><strong>58 min:</strong> Well that will certainly make the last half an hour a bit more interesting. <strong>Diakite</strong> also goes into the book for a late challenge as West Ham were piling forward.</p> <!-- Block 69 --> <p><strong>60 min:</strong> It was a goal out of nothing but QPR now look resurgent. They've got plenty of time to turn this one around but are still vulnerable at the back.</p> <!-- Block 70 --> <p><strong>61 min:</strong> Last-gasp defending from Mbia and Nelsen to prevent Cole prodding home at the near post. Andy Carroll jogs up the touchline once again, I reckon he'll be thrown into the mix soon.</p> <!-- Block 71 --> <p><strong>63 min:</strong> Another booking, and this time <strong>George McCartney</strong> goes into the book for tugging back Diakite. This one might begin to turn a little scrappy.</p> <!-- Block 72 --> <p><strong>64 min:</strong> Half-hearted penalty shouts for QPR as Cisse goes down in the box following a tussle with Demel. Fantastic flick on from Taarabt there to give Cisse the opportunity. The Moroccan has been at his pulsating best since his introduction.</p> <!-- Block 73 --> <p><strong>65 min:</strong> Noble squanders possession and QPR can break from midfield. Taarabt looks to slide Zamora through and he's onside ... but the pass is just overhit and through to Jaaskelainen. Close shave for the Hammers.</p> <!-- Block 74 --> <p><strong>65 min:</strong> Jaaskelainen denies Granero with a strong one-handed save. Cisse found Granero on the edge of the area with a pinpoint pass, he shifted the ball out of his feet and unleashed a shot that seemed to be flying into the net ... clawed away by the keeper.</p> <!-- Block 75 --> <p><strong>66 min:</strong> <strong>Jaaskelainen</strong> is booked for time-wasting after dithering from a goal-kick.</p> <!-- Block 76 --> <p><strong>68 min:</strong> Oh Carlton Cole that is a horrendous miss. Nolan capitalised on a slip from Mbia, sliding in the striker who was one-on-one with Cesar, but he shanks his left-foot effort woefully wide. Pathetic attempt.</p> <!-- Block 77 --> <p><strong>69 min:</strong> A flurry of yellow cards for West Ham and I'm not really sure for what. First <strong>Cole</strong> goes into the book before <strong>Nolan</strong>, having a word with Clattenburg, joins him for dissent!</p> <!-- Block 78 --> <p><strong>70 min:</strong> Noble lifts a free-kick into the opposition penalty area, it's aimed at Cole but he can't make decisive contact on it. That could be the striker's last act, with Andy Carroll about to be introduced.</p> <!-- Block 79 --> <p><strong>71 min:</strong> Cisse is fed into the area down the left and he pulls the trigger ... saved low by Jaaskelainen! You would have expected the keeper to stop that, and he duly obliged by knocking the ball out for a corner with his feet.</p> <!-- Block 80 -->  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396996296\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2010/04/09/substitution.gif\" alt=\"Live blog: substitution\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong>West Ham sub:</strong> Carroll on, Cole off</p> <!-- Block 81 --> <p><strong>73 min:</strong> Good, strong punch from Cesar to clear a Noble corner. Still no first touch for Carroll but with Roy Hodgson watching in the stands, he will be keen to impress.</p> <!-- Block 82 --> <p><strong>75 min:</strong> QPR are down to 10 men! <strong>Samba Diakite is shown a second yellow card after mis-timing his slide on Demel. </strong>Well that could nip Rangers' comeback in the bud.</p> <!-- Block 83 --> <p><strong>76 min:</strong> Suddenly West Ham have the momentum once again and with Matt Jarvis persistently whipping in crosses for the fresh Andy Carroll, you get the feeling that if we are to see another goal tonight, it will be for the away side.</p> <!-- Block 84 --> <p><strong>78 min:</strong> A seventh West Ham player goes into the book! <strong>James Collins</strong> kicks the ball away and that means the east London club face an FA fine. Terrific play from Matt Jarvis, hanging up a delightful cross to the far post, right under the bar, which Clint Hill heads behind.</p> <!-- Block 85 --> <p><strong>79 min:</strong> Fine save from Cesar to tip Vaz Te's half-volley onto the bar and behind for a corner! West Ham turning the screw now.</p> <!-- Block 86 --> <p><strong>82 min:</strong> Adel Taarabt is coming deep to inject some urgency for QPR. He finds Clint Hill down the left and the full-back whips a fantastic ball to the far post, the defenders all miss it but Zamora is caught on his heels, the white orb ricocheting off his legs in cumbersome fashion and the danger evaporates.</p> <!-- Block 87 --> <p><strong>83 min:</strong> Jarvis whips in another fine cross but Carroll and Vaz-Te had both misread his intention, running to the near post when the back stick would have been the better option. Nolan then fires it low across goal ... but it flashes past the claret and blue shirts.</p> <!-- Block 88 -->  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396996295\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2010/04/09/substitution.gif\" alt=\"Live blog: substitution\" width=\"40\" height=\"40\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong>QPR sub:</strong> Hoilett on, Onuoha off</p> <!-- Block 89 --> <p><strong>85 min:</strong> Kevin Nolan is penalised for a foul but surely he got a solid foot on the ball there? Allardyce is rightly unhappy and Taarabt stands over this free-kick. Can he replicate his earlier wondrous strike ... in a word, no. He curls it well over.</p> <!-- Block 90 --> <p><strong>87 min:</strong> Ricardo Vaz-Te goes to ground clutching his foot, trying to eek out a few seconds, much to the displeasure of Clint Hill and Julio Cesar. Hill and Vaz-Te are exchanging heated words, but nothing comes of it.</p> <!-- Block 91 --> <p><strong>88 min:</strong> Carroll clears with a defensive header \u2013 he's playing the holding role out there! Zamora touches it to Cisse on the edge of the D, he has a crack ... it's deflected and Jaaskelainen palms away!</p> <!-- Block 92 --> <p><strong>90 min:</strong> I have to say I think Mark Clattenburg has had a miserable game this evening. QPR looking to put some late pressure on at the death...</p> <!-- Block 93 --> <p><strong>Six minutes of injury time to be played!</strong> Where's that come from?!</p> <!-- Block 94 --> <p><strong>90+2 min:</strong> Faurlin draws another fine save from Jaaskelainen! I'm sorry for criticising you earlier Jussi, you have been magnificent this evening! He palms that away after a 25-yard piledriver from Faurlin.</p> <!-- Block 95 --> <p><strong>90+3 min:</strong> Another West Ham booking, their eighth of the match! <strong>James Tomkins</strong> yellow carded for time-wasting.</p> <!-- Block 96 --> <p><strong>90+4 min:</strong> West Ham have a goal-kick and are in no hurry to take it. I still don't understand where six minute have come from.</p> <!-- Block 97 --> <p><strong>90+5 min:</strong> Sharp turn from Carroll and he is brought down by Nelsen.

  "<p>In debating whether a pass rate of 60% on the controversial phonics test for six-year-olds is good enough, and whether the test truly measures reading ability or merely the capacity to decode phonetically sensible sounds (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2012/sep/27/phonics-test\" title=\"\">Phonics test identifies pupils needing support</a>, 28&#xa0;September), we are rather missing the point. As is too often the case in education, the influence of genes has not been taken into account.</p> <p>We are a group of researchers who study genetic and environmental influences on academic and cognitive abilities, including reading. Genetic research has shown convincingly that the ability to decode sounds is heritable, more so than many aspects of behaviour and health. No one would claim that it is a complete measure of reading ability but it is an essential skill and one that is strongly predictive of children's later reading achievement. Therefore a phonics test can be a good thing which can genuinely help teachers to identify children who, largely for genetic reasons, may struggle with reading as they go through school.</p> <p>However, using it as a high-stakes test rather than a teacher's tool is a bad thing. It leads to teaching to the test, which wastes everybody's time because the most influential experiences are unique to individuals, not shared by all children in a year 1 classroom (<a href=\"http://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-reading-development-and-etiology-of-reading-difficulty-in-children/abstract/54\" title=\"\">Harlaar, Dale and Plomin, 2005</a>).</p> <p>Evidence from behavioural genetics suggests a more fruitful debate is needed, a debate about how to use schools to enhance opportunities for children who struggle \u2013 in many instances children identified by this test \u2013 rather than the current debates about how many children should be able to jump through the hoop, and whether the hoop has been well-chosen. The plan for a light-touch phonics assessment is a good one, but the government will need to remember to keep the touch light if it is to be used to help all children become good readers rather than to demonise schools and teachers.<br><strong>Dr Kathryn Asbury </strong><em>Centre for Psychology in Education, University of York, </em><strong>Professor Philip Dale </strong><em>Department of Speech and Hearing Sciences, University of New Mexico, </em><strong>Dr Nicole Harlaar </strong><em>University of Colorado Boulder, </em><strong>Dr Yulia Kovas </strong><em>Goldsmiths, University of London, </em><strong>Professor Robert Plomin </strong><em>SGDP Centre, King's College London</em></p>",
  "<p>Oxfam customers in Glasgow may soon be able to buy a new kind of tartan, woven from red, green and gold thread. The cloth, registered earlier this summer, is the most vivid expression of a support and advocacy group set up by a group of female refugees from Africa with the evocative&#xa0;name of Karibu Scotland.</p> <p>Founder Henriette Koubakouenda was 50 years old when she arrived in the UK from her native Democratic Republic of the Congo in the summer of 2001, to join an existing community of African women in Scotland. Using her knowledge of English and her experience of working with women in community development (she had worked with the United Nations Development Programme back in Kinshasa), Koubakouenda would help&#xa0;her fellow asylum-seekers with their phone calls and letter-writing. \"Many of the women didn't speak English and it was really difficult for them to access mainstream services,\" she tells me from her flat in Glasgow. \"And I thought maybe if we can organise ourselves, this could be more formal and people will see us. The&#xa0;mainstream&#xa0;services will know our&#xa0;need and respond to it.</p> <p>\"I called that first meeting on the 31 August 2003, and around 15 to 20 women came into my flat,\" says Koubakouenda. Karibu Scotland was born \u2013 as a group for refugees and asylum seekers arriving in Glasgow.</p> <p>As well as support and campaigning, for Koubakouenda, it was also about keeping isolation at bay. \"When you come to a new country, you don't know the people and you don't speak the language. Can you imagine how hard that is? Getting together is also a&#xa0;way of breaking the isolation. Karibu helps these women to have a new bond of family.\"</p> <p>The women who use Karibu also come for services such as ESOL English classes and IT lessons. The organisation also has a&#xa0;social enterprise arm: hence the sewing group that registered the tartan in the Karibu colours and the catering enterprise <a href=\"https://sites.google.com/a/karibuscotland.org.uk/home/home/about\" title=\"\">Taste of Africa</a> (they cater events around Glasgow).</p> <p>They are planning a Karibu Scotland cafe. \"We are hoping to have the cafe before the Commonwealth Games. Many people will be coming from Africa, and if they can find a place where they can eat African food, it would be great,\" says Koubakouenda. \"We just need to secure the funding.\" Laurentine Zibi, chair and former volunteer, says: \"All the feedback we've had on our services and events has always been so positive.\" She adds: \"We did not choose to be here but now that we are \u2013 this is our home, this is our country and our voice should be heard through our projects, events and&#xa0;skills.\"</p>",
  "<h2>TEAM EUROPE</h2> <p><strong>Nicolas Colsaerts</strong></p> <p>The Ryder Cup looked like getting away from Europe early doors, with the Americans battering their visitors in three of the four opening-day fourballs. Only Nicolas Colsaerts showed any resistance, and he had to battle against Tiger Woods, Steve Stricker and Lee Westwood. Without the point he somehow salvaged by raking in a series of ludicrous putts and clacking a number of approaches tight to the pin, Europe would have been jiggered from the get-go. The woefully misfiring Westwood had the good grace to spend most of the round loudly guffawing at his partner's escapology with a look of incredulity and glee writ large across his otherwise flustered coupon. The score at the end of the first day: USA 5-3 Belgium (and Europe).</p> <p><strong>Rating:</strong> 10</p> <p><strong>Luke Donald</strong></p> <p>If one decision won the Ryder Cup for Europe, it was surely Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Olaz\u00e1bal opting to send out Donald in the opening singles match. Pretty much everyone assumed the show would open with part two of Bubba/Poulter \u2013 surely a shoo-in for a future Peter Morgan play \u2013 but Ollie second-guessed Davis Love III, perhaps surmising that Poults the Entertainer would have got caught up in a sideshow to the detriment of Poults the Scrapper. Instead Donald came out, clipped the gregarious Bubba with ruthless efficiency \u2013 forget those two short putts he missed to close out the match, he was five under through 17 \u2013 and silenced the crowd eventually but silenced them early enough to send a signal all the way down the leaderboard, while allowing Poulter to go about his business in relative obscurity elsewhere.</p> <p><strong>Rating:</strong> 10</p> <p><strong>Sergio Garc\u00eda</strong></p> <p>This is the Ryder Cup. He's Sergio Garc\u00eda. Next.</p> <p><strong>Rating:</strong> 10</p> <p><strong>Peter Hanson</strong></p> <p>According to the rumour mill, the big man had a full and frank exchange of views with his captain regarding his non-selection after a piss-poor showing in the Friday fourballs. How important must their row have been? It would have showed to Ollie that every single member of his team wanted it, and wanted it bad, and given the captain extra succour, which he in turn was then able to transmit back to his players for that tearful call to arms on Saturday night. So that's how important their row must have been. Hanson also kept pestering the in-form Jason Dufner, enough to send a wee bit more nervous energy pinging around Medinah. No points but his contribution was important in a way that can't be measured. In a way that actually was not measured, admittedly, but we're all adult enough to catch the drift of these elaborate concepts.</p> <p><strong>Rating:</strong> 10</p> <p><strong>Martin Kaymer</strong></p> <p>A player with absolutely no confidence whatsoever in his form or in himself. A shy chap who suddenly found himself in the eye of a storm \u2013 having surely never believed it would come down to his match \u2013 with the whole world waiting for him to fail. A German who, like his legendary compatriot Bernhard Langer, faced a putt for the Ryder Cup with a pitchmark on his line. A man who swallowed hard, decided he'd be damned if he was going to introduce himself to Langer's demons any time soon and hit his ball decisively into the cup.</p> <p><strong>Rating:</strong> 10</p> <p><strong>Paul Lawrie</strong></p> <p>Lawrie's Open win of 1999 at Carnoustie is still, outrageously and disgracefully, put down to Jean van de Velde's collapse. No matter that the Aberdonian shot a final-day 67 when the rest of the field were moaning and grizzling like bairns about the long grass. No matter that his four iron into the 18th during the subsequent play-off was one of the great <em>carpe diem</em> moments in the history of all golf. So how lovely for him to rout the in-form Brandt Snedeker 5&amp;3 in the singles. He should have been picked more often, too: he was four under with his own ball in the Friday fourballs. Few will have the brazen cheek to question his ability now.</p> <p><strong>Rating:</strong> 10</p> <p><strong>Graeme McDowell</strong></p> <p>G-Mac sunk the winning putt at Celtic Manor in 2010 and in a funny way he did the same thing here, only at the other end of proceedings. He put away a missable putt to win his foursomes with Wee-Mac on Friday morning, having let a three-hole lead slip. If that had not gone in, Europe would not have had their first point on the board and we wouldn't be here now. Also, he should get credit for wandering around in a manner which suggested he clearly wasn't having any truck with defeat. Poulter minus the shouting and the sensational putting but hey, you can't have everything.</p> <p><strong>Rating:</strong> 10</p> <p><strong>Rory McIlroy</strong></p> <p>The only man to take to the Ryder Cup tee while still eating his breakfast.</p> <p><strong>Rating:</strong> 10</p> <p><strong>Francesco Molinari</strong></p> <p>Molinari has shown an occasional tendency to wobble when the heat is turned up \u2013 witness his spurning of the Scottish Open title earlier this year \u2013 but when the pressure was on in the singles, he repelled a charge from the greatest player of our age not once but thrice. The final fightback was breathtaking: having thinned a chip on the 17th, then driven into a bunker on the 18th, the old problems looked to have resurfaced. But he desperately steadied himself and clipped a gorgeous iron into the green, where this time it would be Tiger who would suffer from temperature issues. It was the shot that won the Ryder Cup for Europe. Tendency to wobble? Oh, I don't think so.</p> <p><strong>Rating:</strong> 10</p> <p><strong>Ian Poulter</strong></p> <p>Poulter could have lost his singles match 10&amp;8 and still deserved the man-of-the-tournament award. Turning round a Saturday afternoon fourball with five birdies in a row would be the high-water mark for any normal player, especially as he appeared to squeeze most of the jelly out of his eyeballs when screaming in delight on 16. But it's his antics back on the 1st tee, taking on the crowd and Bubba amid pantomime scenes, that will live longest in the memory and must have made the Americans wonder exactly what the hell they were dealing with. \"Don't get scared, Poulter!\" shouted some wag down the 18th on Saturday morning. Oh, Poulter didn't get scared.</p> <p><strong>Rating: </strong>10</p> <p><strong>Justin Rose</strong></p> <p>Up to the Sunday singles the only European player to have ever been spotted as a young man purchasing foodstuffs from late-night Basingstoke kebab emporium Chick-Mex had enjoyed a solid Ryder Cup, if not a great one. After 16 brave and battling holes in the singles against the legendary Phil Mickelson, it was still a case of nearly-but-not-quite. But then he raked in a monster on the 17th to level the match, jigged around like a penguin who had been taking unwise choreographic advice from Peter Crouch and stroked in a putt he had no right to make on the 18th to steal the game. This was against one of the greatest players to have lived. Kids of Europe, if you get enough of those large doners down your neck, our long-term future in this event is assured.</p> <p><strong>Rating: </strong>10</p> <p><strong>Lee Westwood</strong></p> <p>Westwood was a shambles for two and a half days. Even the two holes he won on the front nine of his singles match were as a result of tiddlers missed by Matt Kuchar. (Naturally he gave one of them back with a lame short prod of his own). But with the scoreboard turning blue, Westwood realised the importance of getting his act together and so he finally stopped messing about. His 25-footer on the 15th, effectively to seal the match after a rare hot streak with the flat stick, was as good a putt as was sunk all week. Kuchar made him tap in from one and a half feet to seal the win, an outrageous insult under most circumstances, but Westwood took it in good humour, perhaps aware that, if he had been playing against himself, he'd have demanded to see it too. A gent who stepped up for Europe when it really mattered and not for the first time either.</p> <p><strong>Rating: </strong>10</p> <p><strong>Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Olaz\u00e1bal </strong>(non-playing captain)</p> <p>OK, so maybe he should not have kept picking Westwood during the first two days. But perhaps he knew exactly how things were going to pan out and that Westwood would require three and a half rounds to get going, before putting in a crucial shift. Otherwise Ollie was pretty much bang on, setting the tone from the opening speeches to his emotional valediction on Sunday evening. You would need a heart of stone not to have been in floods when, during an interview with Sky, he absent-mindedly began talking to Seve \u2013 \"This is for you \u2026\" \u2013 before realising he was on camera and correcting himself. \"This was for him \u2026\" was all he managed by way of continuation, before burying his face in his cap for a wholly deserved sob. It was heartbreaking and life-affirming at the same time, as all the best sporting moments should be. And those are the ghosts of Brookline vanished, too.</p> <p><strong>Rating: </strong>10</p> <p><strong>Seve Ballesteros</strong> (vibes)</p> <p>Well, y'know. And is there anything more fitting than Europe having won like this on a course set up so players can drive like madmen and then fashion ludicrous escapes?</p> <p><strong>Rating: </strong>10</p> <h2>TEAM USA</h2> <p><strong>Keegan Bradley</strong></p> <p>America's player of the tournament. Bubba got all the credit for whipping the crowd up but really most of the early palaver was down to the 2011 US PGA champion, who set about sinking a preposterous number of putts on the opening day and running around like Marco Tardelli in the 1982 World Cup final. Had by far and away the most haunted thousand-yard stare of the entire US team in the closing ceremony. He really did care quite a lot. He'll be winning a few majors down the years.</p> <p><strong>Rating: </strong>10</p> <p><strong>Jason Dufner</strong></p> <p>Spent the entire week wandering around like a man wondering if he had left the gas on but deciding that it will be OK either way because he's got a pretty good insurance policy. Three points from four, the last won when he flicked away Peter Hanson, who had been coming back at him in determined fashion, by raising an eyebrow. Took to the stage in what could best be described as a carefree mooch, both hands in pockets, like a gentleman popping down the road to see if he could grab a pint at the local before lasties, but no worries if he doesn't make the bell, he might have a couple of cans back at home in the fridge. Scruffy and slightly overweight, give or take a splash of genius, he is each and every one of us. Only he's jumped the rope.</p> <p><strong>Rating: </strong>10</p> <p><strong>Jim Furyk</strong></p> <p>Showed his usual fighting spirit from beginning to end, even though it didn't quite work out for him. Unlucky to lose to the Macs on the opening day, he made damn sure it did not happen again with birdie on the opening hole against the pair on Saturday. He never relinquished that lead. And what could he do in the singles, up against both Sergio and Seve? He was a dimple away from going dormie two on the 16th, celebrating a putt which was dropping but then outrageously decided to pop back out again, then saw his attempt at a long-range up and down from the back of the 18th miss by a coat of paint. You know who was keeping those balls out? Yep. Despite it all, he was gentlemanliness personified. Apart from during the closing ceremony, that is, where he was a picture of seething malevolence as a Scottish folk band jigged gleefully in front of him, heidrum-hodruming right up in the poor guy's grille.</p> <p><strong>Rating: </strong>10</p> <p><strong>Dustin Johnson</strong></p> <p>The Ryder Cup is perhaps the perfect arena for Big Dustin, who is arguably the most talented player on the entire circuit but certainly the most inconsistent. In matchplay conditions, though, he can have his thundering meltdowns and move on without having suffered too much pain. Having needlessly shed a two-hole lead to Colsaerts in the singles, missing short putts and toying with water, he hit a towering long iron into the 14th to set up birdie, the first of three holes in a row to close out a match in the brisk manner of a hunter twisting a rabbit's neck. Three wins from three, without making any fuss, a gentle giant.</p> <p><strong>Rating: </strong>10</p> <p><strong>Zach Johnson</strong></p> <p>A tenacious wee irritant, a scrapper of the highest quality. Denied a four-from-four record only by Ian Poulter's frankly silly putting display at the tail end of the Saturday fourballs. During the closing ceremony was by some distance the American to appear most personally affronted by defeat. The look on his face! The narrowing of the eyes! Now there's a man who understands how important the Ryder Cup is.</p> <p><strong>Rating: </strong>10</p> <p><strong>Matt Kuchar</strong></p> <p>The incredible smiling man. He even managed a thin-lipped version during the closing ceremony, despite his putter having cooled on him \u2013 and Westwood's having turned inexplicably molten \u2013 at exactly the wrong time. Otherwise a consistent thorn in Europe's side, winning both of his fourballs.</p> <p><strong>Rating: </strong>10</p> <p><strong>Phil Mickelson</strong></p> <p>Lefty has never been the greatest at the Ryder Cup but this looked like finally being his year. He formed a majestic pairing with the rookie Keegan Bradley, the two dovetailing perfectly, the old boy taking up the slack when the young pup ran out of steam. The perfect Ryder Cup was in the making \u2013 until Rose raked in that astonishing birdie monster on the 17th in the singles. When the Englishman completed his smash and grab on the final green with a granite pressure putt, it was a hammer blow to Mickelson, and the Americans, who had now lost all five of their opening matches. Mickelson's reaction to having his pocket picked? A warm smile and generous congratulations. What a sport. If Seve really is pulling the strings somewhere, perhaps he could set up some sort of pulley mechanism that'd finally deliver a US Open to one of the game's gents. Seve?</p> <p><strong>Rating: </strong>10</p> <p><strong>Webb Simpson</strong></p> <p>Came roaring out of the blocks in the singles and would have had a three-hole lead after four had Poulter not chipped in outrageously at the 1st. Was denied by Poulter and Rose scrapping like madmen in the Saturday morning foursomes but otherwise delivered two easy victories over the first two days. It is always nice to see a relatively unheralded major winner prove he has what it takes to stay at the very top and Simpson gave notice of his intention not to be a one-hit wonder.</p> <p><strong>Rating: </strong>10</p> <p><strong>Brandt Snedeker</strong></p> <p>He was beaten by the Macs, he beat the Macs, and he was smoked by Paul Lawrie. A mixed bag but the guy's just won $10m at the FedEx and must still be spinning. Plus, like his team-mate Dufner, Snedeker exudes the carefree manner of a punter who's just taken a gamble to jump the rope and see how long he can get away with it \u2013 albeit jump the rope more athletically.</p> <p><strong>Rating: </strong>10</p> <p><strong>Steve Stricker</strong></p> <p>His putter wasn't as hot as it usually is, and the poor man ended the tournament as the Bizarro Poulter, with a 0-4 record, and no points to show for his troubles. But consider his matches for a minute: he lost 2&amp;1 in his opening foursomes and his other three games by one hole. And if his putt at the 18th on Saturday afternoon hadn't ridden the wall of death round the back of the cup and squirmed out, he would have denied Garcia and Donald the point at 10-4 which started Europe's revival. The thin lines between success and failure can be measured by the width of a dimple. He also had to deal with the preposterous opening-day putting of Colsaerts, accepting blow after blow with a dignified stoicism.</p> <p><strong>Rating: </strong>10</p> <p><strong>Bubba Watson</strong></p> <p>It would get very odd if people carried on like this every week but the Ryder Cup calls for a sprinkling of showmanship and Bubba has it coming out of his ears like hair pokes from under his visor. It takes a special kind of star to engineer a brouhaha with the express intention of teeing off amid the tumult, then run down the fairway high-fiving half the gallery. And it takes a special kind of golfer to deliver two huge fourball victories and make the usually ice-cool Donald flustered enough to miss a couple of short match-clinching putts.</p> <p><strong>Rating: </strong>10</p> <p><strong>Tiger Woods</strong></p> <p>As anybody who witnessed the great man's meltdown on the 16th tee at the Masters this year will know \u2013 he missed the green by 40 yards with a wedge, then hoofed the club along the ground as his soul departed for a voyage in the funk mothership \u2013 when Tiger struggles, he really struggles. Which is what he did on the front nine at Medinah, flaying drive after drive into the trees and misjudging his short irons woefully. And yet coming home he was every inch the 14-time major winner, fighting and scrapping to the end in every match. OK, so he ended up with little to show for it. But you have to wonder if his concession to Francisco Molinari at the last on Sunday will, in time, be seen as an act of sportsmanship right up there with Jack Nicklaus's to Tony Jacklin at Birkdale in 1969. Having missed his short putt to win the match, Tiger seemed instinctively to realise that Europe's comeback deserved outright victory, that the Seve Factor was a story that needed a positive conclusion and that \u2013 to paraphrase Big Jack \u2013 he did not think Molinari would miss that but he didn't want to give him the chance. Tiger might not have the greatest Ryder Cup record, not by a long chalk, but this concession alone is some legacy to leave the competition. One of the great sporting gestures.</p> <p><strong>Rating: </strong>10</p> <p><strong>Davis Love III </strong>(non-playing captain)</p> <p>Having built a 10-6 lead going into the singles, the American captain can hardly be said to have got much wrong during the week. Within minutes of suffering the most painful defeat of any US captain in Ryder Cup history he was in front of the cameras, warmly congratulating his opposite number, Olaz\u00e1bal, evoking the Spirit of Seve \u2013 \"He was obviously here for that one point they needed!\" \u2013 and insisting that any heat should be directed at him and not his proud players. \"I hope they put it all on me, because these guys put a lot into this. They played very, very well. We're going to be bitterly disappointed but it was a good Ryder Cup and it was good for golf. It wasn't good for us but it was good for golf.\" Europe wouldn't have had a Homeric singles odyssey to embark on had they not been facing the strongest US team since 1981, when America travelled to Walton Heath and gave the home side a frightful smack in the mouth. Captain Love, for his efforts, should be applauded. Without his excellence, we'd be talking about a very average Ryder Cup right now.</p> <p><strong>Rating: </strong>10</p>",

  "<p>Barack Obama has lost the first round in the run-up to the presidential debate in Denver on Wednesday, with a poll showing his campaign team failed in the contest to play down expectations. </p> <p>Both the Obama and Mitt Romney campaign teams for the last fortnight have been trying to lower expectations about their respective candidates and talking up their opponents.</p> <p>In spite of this, an ABC/Washington Post poll showed that registered voters by a two to one margin expect Obama to win the crucial debate. </p> <p>The figures can be read as a vote of confidence in Obama, an expectation that he is a better performer than Romney, often portrayed as \"wooden\" as a speaker. But there is a big downside for Obama going into a debate as favourite in a debate estimated to attract a viewing audience of between 50-60 million. </p> <p>If the debate is judged to be a draw or even a win for Obama, that outcome would be largely discounted because he fulfilled expectations. By contrast, with expectations of Romney low, even a modest performance could be potrayed by his team as win.</p> <p>Obama is ensconced in a resort on the outskirts of Las Vegas, preparing for the debate while Romney has opted to base himself in Denver.</p> <p>Obama, in his final rally in Las Vegas on Sunday night before retreating into purdah, made a last attempt to lower expectations. </p> <p>\"I know folks in the media are speculating already on who's going to have the best zingers,\" he said. The crowd shouted: \"You are.\"</p> <p>Obama replied: \"I don't know about that. Governor Romney, he's a good debater.\"</p> <p>Romney badly needs a good showing to reverse the growing perception that he is a loser, after setback after setback, from his overseas trip in the summer to an uninspired convention. He was not helped by the 47% secret video a fortnight ago, or recent polls in swing states putting Obama ahead.</p> <h2>Republican strategy emerges</h2> <p>In a preview of what lines of attack he might pursue on Wednesday, the Republican party put out a lengthy press release listing issues on which it claimed Obama had abused trust, including immigration, the deficit and renewable energy.</p> <p>Romney's campaign team is divided over strategy for the remaining five weeks, particularly over how hard to pursue the shifting White House version of events of the Libyan killings.</p> <p>Some of his advisers want to keep the focus almost exclusively on the economy, seeing that as the key to eventual victory on November 6. Others argue that the unrest in Libya and elsewhere in the Middle East offers a badly-needed opportunity to shake up the election race.</p> <p>There will, in theory, be little opportunity to make the Wednesday debate about foreign policy, having agreed in advance to devote it to domestic issues and leave foreign policy to the third and final debate.</p> <p>Romney, in an article in the Wall Street Journal published Monday, reiterated his argument that Obama had failed in the Middle East by not staying close enough to Israel, by being too weak in the showdown with Iran and by failing to make the most of the Arab Spring. </p> <p>Referring to the killing of US ambassador Chris Stevens and three other Americans at the consulate in Benghazi, Libya, he wrote: \"We needed a strategy for success, but the president offered none. And now he seeks to downplay the significance of the calamities of the past few weeks.\"</p> <p>The White House, the state department and the US mission at the UN <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/30/white-house-defends-un-ambassador-benghazi\">have veered between</a> ascribing the Benghazi attack to militia spontaneously taking advantage of a riot over anti-Muslim film to a pre-planned assault by a group linked to al-Qaida.</p> <p>The ABC-Washington Post poll, in line with others over the last fortnight, show Obama ahead. Sixty-three percent of registered voters said they expect he will win re-election and 56% to 29% expect him to win the Denver debate.<br>Although Obama is ahead nationally, it is only by 49% to 47%, a small enough margin for Romney to mount a comeback. </p> <p>A poll in Iowa, for the Des Moines Register, which has a good record of accuracy, shows Obama ahead 49% to 45%, good news for him but a small enough margin for Romney to turn around one of the swing states.</p> <p>In a new line of attack, the Democrats are sending out squads of legislators and officials from Massachusetts to swing states to talk about their experience of Romney when he was governor of the state.</p>",
  "<p>\u2022\u2009Sharp but blunt union boss, Len McCluskey of Unite, gave the conference a rip-roaring denunciation of banks, coalitions and \"the siren voices\" of neo-liberalism. But the big three unions' other general secretaries, Paul Kenny of the GMB and Unison's Dave Prentis, have been telling comrades in the bar that Len himself proved susceptible to the neo-liberal siren voice of Rupert Murdoch ahead of the conference. McCluskey's Sunday Times interview was hyped into a predictable \"unions to seize control of world\" page one headline \u2013 as Kenny and Prentis guessed it would be. Both men turned the paper down.</p> <p>Tony Blair's former press chief Alastair Campbell is \"thinking about\" standing for election at the next general election, he revealed yesterday. Asked on LBC radio whether he had ambitions to become an MP, he said: \"All I'll say to you is I get a lot of people asking me, particularly when I'm up here, and I do think about it and I am thinking about it and I don't think there's a fantastic rush. We sort of know when the next election is.\"</p> <p>\u2022\u2009Manchester's smart Opus One restaurant has been doing recession-proof business just outside Labour's conference, its lobster-led menu easily costing \u00a360 a head for a decent three-courser. Who could resist its locally inspired dessert, a combination of warm eccles cake, clotted cream and what is described as a Manchester smoothie? It comes together as an Iced Vimto Parfait.</p> <p>\u2022\u2009The unmentionable Blair was always slightly suspicious of New Labour's polling guru, the late Philip Gould, so Alastair Campbell admitted at the launch of essays in his memory. Why? Because his focus groups always seemed to say what Gould thought. Gould used to warm up such groups with matey questions like: \" Your name is Jane? My first girlfriend was called Jane. She went on to commit suicide.\" Just the remark to thaw the ice.</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Good day:</strong> Jim Murphy. The shadow defence secretary introduced a platoon of military (Veterans for Labour) speakers after making a capable speech himself without notes. Murphy even remembered to praise the armed forces (unlike Mitt Romney, who forgot).</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Bad day:</strong> Ad agency M&amp;C Saatchi. It produced the poster being driven around Manchester on a truck, depicting the two Eds, Miliband and Balls as gormless schoolboys. The accompanying slogan \"Labour Isn't Learning\" echoes the Saatchis' glory days in 1979. But Tory moneybags Lord Ashcroft has denounced it as a juvenile waste of cash. Ouch!</p>",
  "<p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2012/oct/01/ed-balls-speech-labour-conference-video\" title=\"\">Ed Balls spoke to the Labour party conference</a> on Monday shortly after Chuka Umunna. So that was two leaders-in-waiting within an hour. The shadow chancellor's intention was clear: to tell the conference everything they wanted to hear, while slipping in plenty they didn't want to hear. Impossible? Not if you're a skilled politician. You can&#xa0;even get a standing ovation, and he&#xa0;did.</p> <p>Ed Miliband was watching closely from the platform. When Balls was announced, he applauded carefully, with both hands held unnaturally high so we could see them flapping together. It was like an American movie: \"Step out of the car, sir, and clap with your hands up \u2013 I said up!\"</p> <p>We needed to see how Balls coped without David Cameron to razz. In parliament, he keeps up a running commentary, both with words and hand gestures, up to the point where the prime minister goes brick red and says something silly.</p> <p>Would Balls sound like a crazed football fan screaming abuse at the ref in a empty stadium? Not quite, though the hall feels deserted even when it's full. They may not be as morose as the Lib Dems last week, but they still resemble a resigned tour party being told about another five-hour delay to their flight.</p> <p>He began with a tribute to the other Ed. This was essential, because there have been reports about the two men not getting on. \"Let us pay tribute to my friend, our leader, Britain's next prime minister, Ed Miliband!\" he said, with a brilliant semblance of sincerity.</p> <p>I was reminded of WC Fields's famous quote: \"Start each day with a smile, and get it over with.\"</p> <p>Having got it over with, he launched into an attack \u2013 somewhat baffling at times \u2013 on Cameron.</p> <p>Balls scoffed at Cameron for sacking three women from the cabinet and demoting another two, and mocked him for a previous attack on the Labour leader: last month, the prime minister said sarcastically that Miliband treating Balls to coffee was not a very \"butch\" thing to do. This was puzzling, because these days the word \"butch\" is almost invariably applied to the more masculine half of a gay partnership, male or female. \"Butch? Butch? Whatever did he mean?\" he asked. \"And if David Cameron is butch, where does that leave George Osborne?\"</p> <p>This got a big laugh, because the name George Osborne always does. You could say something completely meaningless about George Osborne at a Labour conference and it would still get a big laugh. \"George? George Osborne? More George than Osborne if you ask me!\" you could say, and they would collapse in merriment. Or at least stir, like a dog having a nice dream.</p> <p>I would like to put a team of French deconstructionists on to Balls's gag. Did he mean that Osborne was more tough and rugged than Cameron? Or, by contrast, a bit effeminate? Should Osborne be outraged, or mildly flattered? And does it matter?</p> <p>Earlier, Umunna had delivered a speech so bland, so smooth, that it could have offended no one. The shadow business secretary reminds me of those Mr Whippy ice-cream vans. The stuff is extruded in an endless, glossy, air-fluffed stream. It has no nutritional value, but the customers seem to like it.</p>",

A great deal has changed in the Virginia town of Roanoke \u2013 a swing area in a swing state \u2013 since I spent three weeks there <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2008/sep/29/younge.america.roanoke.virginia\">during the last presidential election</a>. Back then <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/video/2008/sep/30/roanoke\">I asked a black woman</a> if she thought Virginia would elect a black man to the presidency. She paused for five seconds. \"If they really know how things are now they would \u2026 They should,\" she said desperately trying to convince herself.</p> <p>They did. But back then Obama supporters dared not believe it even as they worked night and day to achieve it. The Obama campaign office <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/video/2008/oct/06/uselections2008.barackobama\">fizzed with excitement</a>, reviving the energy of those who had previously been disaffected with politics and drawing in new blood from people who had never been interested. People travelled hundreds of miles from all over the country to volunteer in the town.</p> <p>There were a range of reasons for this, not least that he would be the first black president and that his election signalled a departure from the war and the oligarchic impulses of the previous eight years.</p> <p>But the celebrations <a href=\"http://www.thenation.com/article/what-obama-means-world\">went way beyond the Blue Ridge Mountains</a> in which Roanoke nestles. Throughout the Caribbean radios blared Mighty Sparrow's calypso hit Barack the Magnificent; firecrackers went off in El Salvador; Liberians danced in the street. In Ghana the late John Atta Mills ran for the presidency with posters of himself standing next to a life-size cutout of Obama and won. In Brazil, at least eight black candidates took advantage of a quirk in electoral laws so they could stand as \"Barack Obama\" in elections in October.</p> <p>This global outpouring was more than just a response against Bush (it's difficult to believe there would have been such an outpouring if John Kerry had won in 2004). At a time when electoral turnout was declining across most of the western world and disaffection with political classes was at its height, the energy invested in him in Roanoke and projected onto him from afar marked resurrection of the fundamental notion that elections could change things and, in so doing, reconnect popular will to political power through electoral politics.</p> <p>\"People have been excited by Obama's candidacy but also by working together,\" <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2008/nov/10/barack-obama-supporters-campaign\">said Brian Corr</a>, who'd been volunteering between 10 and 15 hours a day from his home in Boston for more than 18 months. \"Organised people are more powerful than organised money \u2026 we need to make sure that all that hope that we have talked about and seen is channelled in a progressive way.\"</p> <p>Given the glaring flaws in American democracy, notably the influence of money and lobbyists, one can debate whether that sense of empowerment was well placed. Obama was not the head of a movement but a well co-ordinated campaign. Those involved had no ownership of it. When the election was over the offices in Roanoke closed and the staffers left, never to return again. But there was no doubt that people did feel empowered.</p> <p>***</p> <p>The most marked political change in the last four years is the degree to which those who were once politically engaged no longer have that sense of possibility. Every Obama supporter I met in 2008 was less involved now than they were then. Most were not involved at all. Many had their reasons, primarily work and children. All of them thought he was certain to win, which may have been a factor. And it would be difficult to replicate the excitement of that election. In the words of Sade: \"It's never as good as the first time.\"</p> <p>But underpinning it all was a general sense of ennui not with him in particular \u2013 they all still loved him \u2013 but with politics in general: a sense that there was little point in investing energy in a political class or much faith in the electoral process that produces them. \"I never thought things could become more divided, and there be more fighting,\" says Ann Trinkel, echoing the frustrations of many. \"But oh my gosh it's just \u2026 gridlock. And I guess that's what sort of lessened the hopefulness for me, and made me a bit more cynical, is all the money.\"</p> <p>It's not difficult to see why. The day I arrived in Roanoke in 2008 Congress voted against the bailout. It felt as though you could look out of your hotel window and see the nation's economy implode. Wachovia bank, the area's fourth largest employer whose name was emblazoned on top of the town's only skyscraper <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2008/oct/06/usa.useconomy\">had been laid low by bad debts</a> and was the subject of an emergency rescue. In 2008 one in eight families in Roanoke lived below the poverty line and the town's median income was three-quarters the national average. </p> <p>Today one in five live in poverty and income is 70% of the national average. In the year before Obama was inaugurated <a href=\"http://www.roanoke.com/news/breaking/wb/197663\">unemployment there leapt</a> from 3.6% to 6.5%. <a href=\"http://www.roanoke.com/news/breaking/wb/197663\">Today it is 6.4%</a>. The haemorrhaging has stopped but for many a slow death continues. True, it could be worse. But that was not the rally cry four years ago. Some of those who bought into the promise of change could be forgiven for demanding a refund.</p> <p>***</p> <p>Nationally, the overwhelming majority of Americans still believe the country is on the wrong track and <a href=\"http://thehill.com/conventions-2012/dem-convention-charlotte/247263-hill-poll-voters-think-second-term-undeserved\">a narrow majority believe Obama does not deserve a second term</a>. In the four years between when he first declared his candidacy and the mid-terms in 2010 the median American family <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/fed-americans-wealth-dropped-40-percent/2012/06/11/gJQAlIsCVV_story.html\">lost a generation of wealth</a>. Wages are stagnant, unemployment high, social mobility slowing, poor white women are <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/21/us/life-expectancy-for-less-educated-whites-in-us-is-shrinking.html\">dying earlier than their mothers did</a> and the gap between black and white is growing. <a href=\"http://www.nationaljournal.com/magazine/winning-has-become-not-losing-20120927\">A recent poll revealed</a> that a slim majority of Americans define success as 'not falling behind'. </p> <p>\"They talk about the rich and the middle class \u2026 they never talk about poverty. We're living in total poverty. We have nothing right now,\" said Robin Barbour four years ago in Roanoke. Back then she was living with her partner Fred Crews in his mother's basement and volunteering for the Obama campaign. Since Obama's been president <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/video/2008/jan/23/america.poverty\">poverty has increased around 14%</a> but he's not delivered a single speech on poverty and mentioned the word just three times in all his state of the union speeches.</p> <p>Few, even among his own supporters, believe Obama re-election will actually reverse these trends. They just think Romney will accelerate and exacerbate them. He is winning at present not because most people think he has done a great job (though many Obama supporters do) but because they think he's done <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/sep/17/barack-obama-election-gary-younge\">the best job he could under the circumstances</a>. The trouble is it is precisely those circumstances \u2013 gridlock, big money, polarisation \u2013 that are turning them off and with the Republicans set to retake the House and possibly the Senate those circumstances are going to get worse.</p> <p>That's not to say that nothing has changed or that it makes no difference who wins. In Roanoke, Chelsea's son, Harrison, was born with two heart defects. Prior to Obama's healthcare reforms that could have meant a life of penury in which he could either be denied health insurance because of a pre-existing condition, had to pay exorbitant rates or faced a lifetime cap on the amount his insurance provider would pay to cover him. Such changes, along with his executive order to halt the deportation of thousands of young undocumented immigrants or the Lily Ledbetter Act, protecting equal pay for equal work, or the repeal of don't ask don't tell for gays in the military makes a crucial difference to many people's lives.</p> <p>So while one may argue that Obama's impact has been too incremental or insufficient, it is untenable to claim that he has made no impact and no difference. Both parties have framed the coming five weeks as a choice between two different visions of the country. There is some truth to that. But beyond the vague notion of 'more fairness' or 'less government' few could tell you what those visions are. The problem is that neither choice actually answers the central and enduring problems the country is facing. Like Seinfeld, this election campaigns have become a show about nothing.</p> <p>Meanwhile the electoral industrial complex keeps churning out polls and analysis as though on a split screen, making the contest not about who or what will or could change but just who will win, where and by how much. The horse race is <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2008/sep/01/uselections2008.usa \">seductive and not entirely avoidable</a>. </p> <p>But my aim is to report from the other screen: where people live, love, survive and \u2013 all too rarely at present \u2013 thrive. To move beyond and between the narrow lens of two parties, fuelled by gaffes and donors, to gauge what people thought would change, think of what has changed and what they would like to change. To see to what extent they think this election will make a difference to their lives and what, if anything, that tells them about the state of the country they live in.</p>",

The song is an appeal across the generational divide for some understanding and sympathy, contrasting strongly with the raw anger of Ohio, released the previous June.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>At this stage of my life and his career it has to be Old Man.

The decision he makes is ultimately fatal, and Young is devastating in his directness: \"Then I saw black, and my face splashed in the sky\".</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Powderfinger shows how much feeling and story you can get into one song.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/treefrogdemon/status/250932022942507008\">Jocelyn Rose</a></p> <h2>5) <a href=\"http://youtu.be/BoA5cqDSasM\">Down By the River</a></h2> <p>Both the Pixies and Nirvana have cited Young and Crazy Horse as an influence, and on this track from Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere it's easy to see why \u2013 the relationship between laid-back verses and the violence of the chorus and solos here is a dynamic you'll find all over Nevermind and Doolittle.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Down By the River \u2013 love, murder, pathos, nine minutes of swirling build up, sexytime!

  "<p>Hundreds of failed asylum seekers are living in Scotland on less than the UN's global poverty target of 77 pence ($1.25) a day.</p> <p>Pregnant women, children and people with disabilities are among those who have been left destitute on Scotland's streets, according to a <a href=\"http://www.stopdestitution.org.uk/files/Trapped%20destitution%20and%20asylum%20final.pdf\" title=\"\">report by the Scottish Poverty Information Unit (pdf)</a> which is based at Glasgow Caledonian University. The UN benchmark is aimed primarily at raising incomes in developing countries.</p> <p>The report's author, Morag Gillespie of SPIU, said the levels of poverty she found were \"dreadful\" and that many interviewees were literally penniless with no legitimate means of income.</p> <p>She said: \"I am an experienced researcher in the field of poverty but I was shocked at the scale of the problem and the accounts I heard: people literally trying to work out where the next meal would come from; a person forced to sleep in a church cupboard. This is a hidden crisis. I was upset at what I found and as a UK citizen I am affronted that the government allows this to happen.\"</p> <p>The report states that 1,849 destitute people were given emergency grants from a charity called the Refugee Survival Trust from 2009 to 2012.</p> <p>The recipients were mostly male (76%) but included 128 families with children, 21 pregnant women and 25 new mothers.</p> <p>Almost half (49%) were homeless, including families with children, 26 people with mental health issues, four disabled people and five pregnant women and two new mothers. The asylum seekers came from 67 countries, most often Iran, Iraq and Eritrea. Some interviewees had been in the asylum system for more than a decade.</p> <p>The independent study was commissioned by the British Red Cross, Refugee Survival Trust and the Scottish Refugee Council.</p> <p>SPIU recommends urgent changes to the asylum system, including support for pregnant women and measures to help the homeless and organisations supporting them.</p> <p>The report says the United Kingdom Border Agency (UKBA) should allow asylum claims to be submitted in Scotland and that \"end-to-end support\" \u2013 including accommodation and a system of cash payments \u2013 should be given to people through all stages of the asylum system until they are either granted status or leave the UK. The report also called for asylum seekers to be given the right to work if they remain in the UK for six months or more.</p> <p>Gary Christie, of the Scottish Refugee Council, said: \"Every day our case workers deal with people who are in desperate situations. We see people who have been tortured in Iran yet have been refused protection; others fleeing for their lives from the violence of war in Somalia but who don't meet the terms of the refugee convention or pregnant women whose cases have been turned down and don't qualify for any support until they reach 32 weeks. While families are supposed to receive support until they leave or are granted status, our research shows that, terrifyingly, some are falling through the gaps. The system is complex, difficult to understand and is not working.\"</p> <p>A UK Border Agency spokesperson said: \"Failed asylum seekers need not face destitution if they simply comply with the law and the decisions of our courts and go home. There are routes of return home for all the nationalities once their asylum claims have been refused and the courts have confirmed that they have no need for protection and no legal right to stay in the UK.</p> <p>\"Assisted Return schemes exist to help failed asylum seekers return home with support to help them re-integrate. Further help and advice on Return programmes can be readily obtained from the charity Refugee Action, [&#xa0;\u2026which] work[s] in partnership with the UK Border Agency to help such individuals return home.\"</p> <h2>Case study: Michael</h2> <p>A businessman from Zimbabwe, Michael had his own successful import/export business. His cousin was the chairman of the local Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) branch, at the time, the only political party in opposition to Mugabe's government. While in the UK on business Michael received a phonecall from his secretary. The office had been ransacked and his life was under threat. She told him he could never come back. His claim for asylum in the UK, however, was refused and he has been destitute for almost two years.</p> <p>After his case was refused, Michael stayed with friends \u2013 sleeping on people's sofas. Over the last few months, however, Michael has been unable to stay at his friend's any longer and has been sleeping on the floor of a church hall, which operates as an emergency night shelter.</p> <p>\"It is difficult to sleep there. There are no showers, and the food is not always good.\"</p> <p>He worries about the fact that it is what supermarkets are throwing away \u2013 often food that has gone off. He gets his clothes from charity shops but is always looking out for things people are finished with. He tries to look good to maintain his self respect and to keep his esteem up.</p>",
  "<p>Things seemed grim, last fall, for John Brandoli, a US citizen in Massachusetts, and his Trinidadian husband, Michael. Though their marriage was recognized by the state, it did not come with the benefit they most urgently needed. Because of the federal <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defense_of_Marriage_Act\">Defense of Marriage Act (Doma)</a>, John could not sponsor Michael for a green card.</p> <p>As a result, Michael was facing deportation to Trinidad, one of the most dangerous places in the hemisphere for gay people. Michael's American husband and mother-in-law were very anxious when they called my organization, Immigration Equality, for help. Our team \u2013 which talks to lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender immigrants every day \u2013 mounted a media and advocacy campaign to stop Michael's deportation. Thanks to his determined family, and the support of Senator John Kerry, he won.</p> <p>In August 2011, the Obama administration had announced that couples like Michael and John shouldn't have to pull out all the stops to stay together. The administration pledged to review pending deportation cases and grant \"prosecutorial discretion\" to those who had committed no crime and could show equities like ties to an American family. When the administration described the plan on phone calls with press, advocacy groups, and congressional staffers, <a href=\"http://usnews.nbcnews.com/_news/2012/09/28/14140024-us-immigration-chief-same-sex-ties-are-family-ties?lite\">they stated clearly</a>: \"We consider LGBT families to be families in this context.\"<br>This was a watershed. The American immigration system had <em>never</em> considered LGBT families like John and Michael to be families in any context. Until 1990, LGBT foreigners could be barred from entering the US entirely. America's immigration system is based on family unification, but gay families don't count.</p> <p>Bitterly, many gay immigrants feared even revealing their relationship with a US citizen. If they did, it could be used against them by immigration officials as evidence they planned to overstay a visa. (Ironically, a genuine commitment is precisely what a straight couple needs to show to be granted a green card based on their relationship.) If an LGBT immigrant does overstay, they fall into a netherworld in which getting a paycheck or opening a bank account becomes impossible. An undocumented person is at risk of being arrested, even if her only crime is staying with the person she loves.</p> <p>After years of hiding, how would someone who qualified for prosecutorial discretion know they <em>should</em> tell the government about their family? How would they prove their relationship if living in one of the 44 US states that forbids gay couples to marry, or one of the 31 that doesn't even offer domestic partnership?</p> <p>Immigration Equality's lawyers heard these questions from all over the country. We heard from couples whose lawyers didn't know to say they were gay. We heard from others who asked for discretion, only to be told by officials that no gay-inclusive policy existed. John and Michael's initial request for discretion was denied, even though Michael met all the criteria.</p> <p>So, we pressed the administration to put its promise in writing.</p> <p>A month after the initial announcement, House minority leader Nancy Pelosi, Congressman Jerry Nadler of New York, and 67 other members of Congress wrote to department of homeland security (DHS) secretary Janet Napolitano to ask for written guidelines, on the grounds that:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"Without specific guidance, it is unlikely that [those] making decisions about individual cases will be aware that LGBT family ties are a factor for consideration.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>When DHS issued written guidance, it did not mention LGBT families, and Napolitano's written response to the members' letter was vague. This summer an even larger group of lawmakers wrote to Napolitano again, saying:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"It would be beyond senseless to see LGBT persons with family ties here in the United States deported simply because the affected persons, their attorneys, and/or ICE officials were unaware of DHS's verbal policy.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>On Thursday, Napolitano replied:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"I have directed <a href=\"http://www.ice.gov/\">ICE</a> to disseminate written guidance to the field that \u2026 'family relationships' includes long-term, same-sex partners.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Her move is an immediate help to LGBT people who are undocumented. It is the first time the immigration system will categorically recognize an American citizen's relationship with an immigrant as a positive factor in an immigration case.</p> <p>However, we are still a long way from equal access to green cards and other immigration benefits. There are several solutions to this problem, including repeal of Doma and passage of pending legislation that would equalize US immigration law.</p> <p>In the meanwhile, the administration could stop denying green card applications from married gay and lesbian couples, and instead, just put them on hold until the pending lawsuits that challenge Doma are decided by the US supreme court, likely by June. Until then, LGBT couples now have some protection because of Napolitano's directive. It's an important first step.</p>",
  "<p>The Titanic, and its striking imagery of the cross-section of Edwardian life, is vividly ingrained on our imaginations. Upstairs: the luxury, the opulence, champagne and chandeliers. Below deck: Irish migrants, Italian waiters, the toil and trouble of a committed crew. Exactly 100 years later, the luxury is no longer so exclusive and the lowest-tier workers certainly aren't European \u2013 but not all that much has changed.</p> <p>Dispatches' investigation <a href=\"http://www.channel4.com/programmes/dispatches/episode-guide/series-111/episode-4\" title=\"\">Cruises Undercover: The Truth Below Deck</a>, which airs tonight on Channel 4 and for which I spent five weeks undercover as an assistant waiter, reveals some of the harsh realities below deck for the multinational workforce who grind to provide once-in-a-lifetime holidays for almost 2 million British cruisers a year. But how is it that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/travel/2002/sep/08/travelnews.uknews.theobserver\" title=\"\">these cruises</a>, as explained in this report from 2002, have been able to get away with providing working conditions well below the legal minimum in the UK for so long, even when operating out of British ports?</p> <p>On 4 August, I set sail from Southampton on the Celebrity Eclipse, an impressive Royal Caribbean-owned cruise liner accommodating just over 4,000 passengers and crew. I was to sign a six-month contract stipulating I'd work straight through without a single day off, living in a small shared cabin. My typical working schedule was 70 hours a week, not including the intensive training schedule I would have to attend in my spare time between shifts. My basic salary was a mere \u00a331 a month, leaving me almost entirely reliant on tips to earn a living. I was assured by the company I'd get a minimum guaranteed wage of \u00a3466 a month, equivalent to \u00a31.54 per hour. If I failed to reach this total in tips, the company would make the difference up to me.</p> <p>I soon met colleagues <a href=\"http://www.channel4.com/programmes/dispatches/articles/cruises-undercover-reporters-blog?gjkg\" title=\"\">much worse off than me</a>. I had joined several rungs up the ladder in the caste-like division of labour on the ship; the lowest-ranked workers behind the scenes \u2013 plucked primarily from India, the Philippines, Indonesia, Latin America and Jamaica \u2013 work eight-month contracts without a single day off (sometimes extended to 10 months or more), earning a fixed wage of around \u00a31.24 an hour, with no tips to top this up. They work a 70 hours per week, and often do extra jobs on top of this, such as cutting hair, cleaning staff cabins and laundry, in order to supplement their income.</p> <p>Furthermore, these lower-ranked workers often spend anything up to \u00a32,165 in agency, visa, medical, uniform and flight costs before even starting work, finding themselves trapped in a situation of modern indentured labour in which they spend much of their first contract simply paying off the debts they incurred joining the ship. Once on the ship and heavily indebted, their bargaining power is severely weakened.</p> <p>Equally odious are the strategies that keep staff performing impeccably despite exhausting conditions. Staff in customer-facing positions are paid a negligible wage, so are almost entirely reliant on tips from passengers to make up their salary. Any off-days, and they simply won't make their tips. For those not in tipping positions, the system is far harsher. If they drop the ball they might receive a warning, which means no promotion for a whole year.</p> <p>Such working conditions are certainly <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/apr/29/cruise-firm-performance-bonuses-tips\" title=\"\">not unique to Celebrity ships</a>. So how is it that ships full of British passengers setting sail from Southampton do not have to comply with British employment laws? The \"flag of convenience\" is an agreement that allows ships to be flagged in another country, thus avoiding labour regulations and taxation in their country of origin. Despite being headquartered in the US, Celebrity Cruises is registered in Liberia, with the ship I worked on flagged in Malta.</p> <p>This opens the door for cruise companies to seek out a labour force from around the world that would accept conditions that British workers never would (I was the only Englishman on the whole ship doing my job). A race to the bottom ensues, in which labour becomes racialised dependant simply on what conditions workers will accept. Certain nationalities (Filipinos, Indonesians, Indians, Jamaicans) tend to be the only ones prepared to take the lowest jobs, so they usually have to start at the bottom and work their way up. Eastern European and Turks don't need to accept such low pay and long contracts, so start off, like me, several steps up the ladder, and go on to occupy most supervisory roles. Lower-tier workers often keep coming back to the ship, as the company dangles them a carrot in the form of far-off promotions and eventually a better salary. Indeed, for many workers who do stick it out, the ship provides them with a valuable income-stream that enables them to support families back home, and for this they remain grateful despite the toil. But with families to feed, and a lack of jobs at home, this idea of choice often remains an illusion.</p> <p>The ship is a poignant metaphor for wider global divisions; above deck, British passengers who have grown accustomed to affordable luxury, while below deck, an international workforce that has grown equally accustomed to providing the service to make this possible. The cruise ship acts as a floating embodiment of free-market capitalism, shrewdly avoiding international regulations so that maximum profit can be extracted. This convenient tactic should be stopped, so that ships are bound to laws of the country out of which they operate. That way, a cruise may become a good place to work as well as unforgettable trip for passengers.</p>",
  "<h2>The Battle of Brookline</h2> <p>Until yesterday's \"Miracle of Medinah\", no final day of the Ryder Cup could match USA's comeback at the \"Battle of Brookline\" in 1999. The day began with Mark James's Europeans enjoying a seemingly unassailable 10-6 lead. Europe required only four points to retain the trophy, but USA captain Ben Crenshaw never gave up: \"I'm going to leave y'all with one thought: I'm a big believer in fate and I have a good feeling about this match.\"</p> <p>Crenshaw invited the Texas governor at the time, George W Bush, into his locker-room before the final day's play. He read an address from the Battle of the Alamo and the speech was so captivating that David Duval stormed out of the room shouting: \"Let's go out and kill them!\"</p> <p>Buoyed by a favourable draw and a boisterous home crowd, USA won the first six matches of the day. Padraig Harrington pulled back a point for the visitors, but the home team moved to within a half-point of victory when Jim Furyk defeated Sergio Garcia. </p> <p>When Justin Leonard holed a 40ft birdie on the 17th, he looked to have sealed the comeback. Leonard ran around punching the air and was swamped by caddies, team-mates and wives. His opponent, Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Olaz\u00e1bal, who could still halve the hole with a birdie putt of his own, was left waiting on the green while the Americans celebrated their presumed victory. When the commotion died down, Olaz\u00e1bal struck his putt wide of the hole and the Americans continued their celebrations. Europe had thrown it away.</p> <h2>The footage</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/hpmRmDLQdrk?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"369\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/hpmRmDLQdrk\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <h2>The report</h2> <p>Here is how Mike Selvey reported the incident for the Guardian at the time:</p> <p><strong>Ryder Cup: Joy of victory brings out the ugly American</strong></p> <p>Well what did we expect? What did we really expect? All week, in the lead-up to the matches, the talk had been of respect and courtesy, of etiquette and fairness, not only from the players but from the crowds.</p> <p>And when, in the late afternoon sun, the glittering gold trophy was presented to the US captain Ben Crenshaw, it would have been hard indeed not to detect amid the pomp, platitudes and smiles as he wittered on in his Texas twang about the spirit of the Ryder Cup, and Mark James paid his deadpan Yorkie tributes, that golf truly had been the winner.</p> <p>But barely an hour earlier, as a last day that had been stoked and whipped to a froth from the outset approached its climax, things had finally got out of hand. Jingoism and triumphalism, of a kind that had been creeping insiduously and steadily into not just the Ryder Cup but golf in general, particularly in the United States ever since the War on the Shore at Kiawah Island, is alive and kicking.</p> <p>And there, at the centre of it, was Crenshaw, a fellow whose taut face and strained features spoke of someone on the brink. If Gentle Ben was not to become Mental Ben, it seemed, his team had to win and do so at the cost of sportsmanship.</p> <p>All day, as the Europeans began the slide, a crowd that had been exhorted to support and shout did so with increasing gusto, egged further on with each bareknuckle uppercut as another putt sank, or each attempt at orchestration when it did not. Respect, at times, was shown neither to opponent nor the traditions of the game.</p> <p>So when Crenshaw, an earnest historian of the game, looks back on the scenes on the 17th green, scenes that caused such an equable and respected character as Sam Torrance to express his disgust, he might, when the emotion has died down, ponder what he has done and whether it is too late to stop it.</p> <p>Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Olaz\u00e1bal deserved better than the numbskulls in the crowd who would not give him the courtesy of silence as he went about a crucial approach shot. And although it would be an insensitive soul who would deny Justin Leonard his expression of joy as he sank the putt that clinched the match, the charge across the green, not just of US golfers but assorted wives, some of them across the line of Olaz\u00e1bal's putt, was an insult.</p> <p>\"I would hope my players would not have reacted like that,\" said James. \"It was an ugly picture,\" said Olaz\u00e1bal.</p> <p>Spare a thought too for Colin Montgomerie, who may be an oversensitive soul at times but has endured jibes and derision beyond the pale this week. And for Jarmo Sandelin and Andrew Coltart as well.</p> <p>Sandelin has not endeared himself in the past to players such as Phil Mickelson and Mark O'Meara. But he was treated mercilessly by the crowd yesterday as Mickelson dissected him.</p> <p>\"We have had our differences,\" said Mickelson, \"but he acted impeccably yesterday and I commend him for it.\"</p> <p>Coltart too might not have tamed the Tiger under any circumstances, but with a huge crowd lining the 9th fairway it is disgraceful that he was allowed to spend five minutes on a fruitless search deep in the woods for his ball when all the while it was nestling in the semi-rough only a few feet from the fairway.</p> <h2>The team reaction</h2> <p>The Europeans were unimpressed by the behaviour of their hosts. Sam Torrance, Europe's vice-captain, said: \"Those were the most disgusting scenes I've ever seen on a golf course.\" </p> <p>Miguel Angel Jimenez considered retiring from the competition: \"They were like professional ice hockey players or footballers, not professional golfers. The tradition of the Ryder Cup is very important and if it has to be like this then I don't want to play in any more Ryder Cups. Everybody saw what happened. I never spoke to the American players about it but to me they are not the winners.\"</p> <p>Davis Love III claimed the Europeans were sore losers: \"We didn't cry when we lost two in a row.\" He insisted the partisanship was no worse than at Valderrama in 1997 or the Belfry in 1993. \"They were poking umbrellas through the ropes trying to trip people going from tee to green. And how long have they been calling our wives 'flight attendants' and 'bimbos'? They act like we're the only ones who do it.\"</p> <h2>The press reaction</h2> <p>Love defended his team, but not all of the press were so forgiving. Mark Whicker of the Washington Post summed up the disappointment felt at the behaviour of the American players: \"It seems an American team can't get through an international competition without acting like jackasses at some point, and Steve Pate and Tom Lehman led a ridiculous charge to mob Leonard. Olazabal was 20 feet away and could have halved the hole. Distracted and delayed, the world's greatest putter missed. Had he made it, done that, the match would have been tied and Europe could have kept the Cup. So it was not just a spasm of well- intentioned enthusiasm. It deserved a severe celebration penalty.\"</p> <p>J A Adande of the San Francisco Examiner saw things differently: \"It's ironic that the most spontaneous display of team spirit drew so much criticism. Olazabal had to wait for the Americans to calm down and return to the ropes. The Europeans were galled by this poor sportsmanship. Bad form, and all that. Tough. They shouldn't try and make it the story of the day. Colin Montgomerie was the one who said to me on Saturday night: 'You know we've won, don't you?' It's just as tasteless for a competitor to say that as it was for the Americans to do their end-zone celebration on the 17th green.\"</p> <h2>The aftermath</h2> <p>Whichever way you view the behaviour of the Americans on the 17th green, there is no disputing that the day ranks high in Ryder Cup history. Here is Scott Murray's reminiscences from a <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/blog/2008/sep/18/rydercup.thejoyofsix\">Joy of Six on the best Ryder Cup moments</a>:</p> <p><strong>Leonard's 40-footer in 1999</strong></p> <blockquote> <p>\"I have a good feeling about tomorrow, that's all I'm saying,\" the US captain Ben Crenshaw predicted on the Saturday night at Brookline in 1999. It was some statement to be making: his team in tatters, Europe were going into the final day four points ahead, needing only another four from a possible 12 to secure the draw which would retain the trophy. But Crenshaw would be proved right. Europe capitulated feebly, risibly, pathetically: they lost the opening six singles matches of the day 3&amp;2, 4&amp;2, 4&amp;3, 6&amp;5, 3&amp;2 and 5&amp;4. Let's just read that again: 3&amp;2, 4&amp;2, 4&amp;3, 6&amp;5, 3&amp;2 and 5&amp;4. Hats off to the Americans, but Jesus H Christ on an electric kart.</p> <p>The die was pretty much cast there and then, but to put the tin lid on a painfully disastrous day, Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Olaz\u00e1bal \u2013 essentially requiring a win against Justin Leonard to keep the Cup in Europe \u2013 threw away a seemingly unassailable lead. Four up with seven to play, Ollie lost four of the next five holes. Then, on the 17th, Leonard drained that snaking 40-foot birdie putt and all hell broke loose. Of course Olaz\u00e1bal could still technically keep his hopes of a win alive by sinking his own 20-footer, but everyone knew it was time to pack up and go home.</p> <p>Be honest: after as good as completing the mother of all comebacks, can you blame the Americans for stampeding across Olaz\u00e1bal's line? Can you really? Ollie missed his putt, like he was always going to do, and all the subsequent huff, puff and bluster let an awful lot of Europeans off the hook \u2013 and obscured an amazing American performance, for which they have never been given proper credit this side of the ocean.</p> </blockquote> <h2>Share your memories of the incident in the comments section</h2>",
  "<p>My very first week writing regularly at the Guardian generated intense conflict with numerous members of the British media because that happened to be the week when Ecuador granted asylum to Julian Assange (a decision I defended), and - for reasons that warrant sustained study by several academic fields of discipline - <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/aug/22/julian-assange-media-contempt\">very few people generate intense contempt among the British commentariat</a> like Assange does. One of the prime arguments I <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/jun/20/julian-assange-right-asylum\">have always made</a> about the Assange asylum case is that his particular fear of being extradited to Sweden is grounded in that country's very unusual and quite oppressive pre-trial detention powers: ones that permit the state to act with an <a href=\"http://ggdrafts.blogspot.com.br/2012/06/swedish-justice.html\">extreme degree of secrecy</a> and which can even prohibit the accused from any communication with the outside world. </p> <p>That is what has always led Assange to fear going to Sweden: that those detention procedures could be used to transfer him to the US without any public scrutiny (only the most willfully irrational, <a href=\"http://www.smh.com.au/national/us-intends-to-chase-assange-cables-show-20120817-24e1l.html\">given evidence like this</a>, would deny that this is a real threat). And that is the argument on behalf of Assange that has produced the greatest amount of anger: in part because some self-loving westerners find the suggestion inconceivable and offensive that a nice western nation (as opposed to some Muslim or Latin American country) could possibly be oppressive in any real way.</p> <p>But now we have a case that confirms exactly those claims about Sweden's justice system, and since it has nothing to do with the WikiLeaks founder, one hopes these issues can be viewed more rationally. Gottfrid Svartholm is the founder of the file-sharing Pirate Bay website who has been prosecuted by the Swedish government for enabling copyright infringements. At the behest of Sweden, he was <a href=\"http://torrentfreak.com/pirate-bay-founder-arrested-in-cambodia-120901/\">recently arrested</a> in Cambodia and then <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/09/04/gottfrid-svartholm-warg-deportation-cambodia_n_1853403.html\">deported to Stockholm</a>, where he has now also been accused (though not charged) with participating in the hacking of a Swedish company.</p> <p>Svartholm is <a href=\"https://torrentfreak.com/pirate-bay-founder-remains-locked-up-without-charges-120930/\">now being held under exactly the pretrial conditions</a> that I've long argued (based on condemnations from human rights groups) prevail in Sweden:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"Gottfrid Svartholm will be kept in detention for at least two more weeks on suspicion of hacking into a Swedish IT company connected to the country's tax authorities. According to Prosecutor Henry Olin the extended detention is needed <em>'to prevent him from having contact with other people.' The Pirate Bay co-founder is not allowed to have visitors and is even being denied access to newspapers and television</em>. . . . </p> <p>\"Since he hasn't been charged officially in the Logica case the Pirate Bay co-founder could only be detained for a few days.</p> <p>\"But, after a request from Prosecutor Henry Olin this term was extended for another two weeks mid-September, and last Friday the District Court decided that Gottfrid could be detained for another two weeks.</p> <p>\"To prevent Gottfrid from interfering with the investigation the Prosecutor believes it's justified to detain him for <em>more than a month without being charged</em>. The Pirate Bay co-founder is not allowed to have visitors and is being refused access to newspapers and television. . . . The Prosecutor hasn't ruled out a request for another extension of Gottfrid's detainment in two weeks, if the investigation is still ongoing.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>The claim that produced the most vitriol was that Sweden vests remarkable power in prosecutors and courts to keep accused suspects completely hidden from public view, with no communication or other contact with the outside world, and that this power is exercised with some frequency. Now we have confirmation of that claim from, of all people, the Swedish prosecutor in this case, Henrik Olin, who <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/2010802/pirate-bay-founders-detained-for-tax-hack-investigation.html\">said in an interview outside the courtroom</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"'According to the Swedish system, when the preliminary investigation is finished, I as prosecutor will decide whether to prosecute him. . . . In the Swedish system it is <em>quite usual for people to be detained on this legal ground, and it gives me the possibility to prevent him from having contact with other people</em>.'\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Unlike in the British system, in which all proceedings, including extradition proceedings, relating to Assange would be publicly scrutinized and almost certainly conducted in open court, the unusual secrecy of Sweden's pre-trial judicial process, particularly the ability to hold the accused incommunicado, poses a real danger that whatever happened to Assange could be effectuated without any public notice. That has always been, and remains, the prime fear for his being extradited to Sweden: a fear that could be, and should be, redressed by negotiations between Ecuador, Sweden and the UK to assure that he can go to Sweden while having his rights protected.</p>",
  "<p>Close followers of African politics would be forgiven for experiencing deja vu upon hearing of the <a href=\"http://allafrica.com/stories/201210010123.html\" title=\"\">peace agreement</a> between Sudan and South Sudan.</p> <p>Aimed at providing a comprehensive solution to the full range of disputes that has repeatedly put the newly divorced countries at risk of war, the final treaty makes the same mistake as its unfortunately named predecessor \u2013 the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comprehensive_Peace_Agreement\" title=\"\">Comprehensive Peace Agreement</a> of 2005. Until all the outstanding issues from these two agreements are resolved, the people of both countries can expect more of the same \u2013 ongoing conflict, ethnic cleansing and humanitarian disaster.</p> <p>Since the agreement was signed last Thursday international leaders \u2013 from President Obama to Lady Ashton of the EU \u2013 have been tripping over themselves to praise it. Human rights groups, peace activists and non-government figures in Sudan and South Sudan have been left asking why.</p> <p>Despite being hailed as \"a giant step forward for both countries\" by African Union mediator Thabo Mbeki, the only significant result is that the two countries have agreed to solve the oil issue. Production of oil in South Sudan and its transportation to the only available port in its northern neighbour will resume. But this is simply a case of mutual economic self-interest being satisfied.</p> <p>Although the two presidents agreed on a demilitarised zone and principles of border demarcation which in itself is good news, little real progress has been made to address the problems of disputed border areas such as Abyei. The fate of Blue Nile and Southern Kordofan \u2013 two regions left in the north that are waging an insurgency against Khartoum \u2013 was also not addressed.</p> <p>The CPA previously left these crucial issues unresolved \u2013 and the people of both countries have been suffering the consequences ever since the south declared independence last July.</p> <p>Border uncertainty has allowed Sudan to continue pursuing ethnic cleansing in the Blue Nile and Southern Kordofan regions, in pursuit of a racially pure Arab state. Hundreds of thousands of civilians have been forced from their homes and killed.</p> <p>These actions have led to an unfolding humanitarian refugee crisis in South Sudan as civilians flee what has been described as the worst war crimes since Darfur. As if this situation was not bad enough, only last week the UN confirmed sighting of a plane coming from Sudan that was dropping arms to rebels in South Sudan.</p> <p>The result of failing to address these issues has been clear for over a year now. Seven years on from the CPA and it seems little has been learnt. With both sides avoiding resolving the so-called \"security file\", history will simply repeat itself. Unarmed civilians, rather than leaders and politicians, will as ever pay the price.</p> <p>A truly comprehensive peace settlement is well overdue. Rather than praising a clearly inadequate agreement it is time the international community put pressure on both sides to resolve their differences \u2013 from finalising the border between the two countries to holding the long delayed referendum in Abyei on whether its residents wish to be part of the north or south.</p> <p>A no-fly zone should also be implemented \u2013 only then will Khartoum be unable to keep bombing civilians \u2013 and fomenting instability \u2013 in its own country and across the border.</p> <p>As a matter of urgency, the international community must pressure the Khartoum regime to fulfil its promise to allow international agencies to deliver aid to those facing starvation in the Nuba mountains. Until these issues are addressed, any assistance the international community provides \u2013 from aid to debt relief \u2013 must be dependent on progress.</p> <p>If the Sudanese regime's track record is anything to go by \u2013 with dozens of agreements reneged upon \u2013 progress will not be easy to achieve. Even as Sudan's President Omar al-Bashir was meeting with his South Sudan counterpart Salva Kiir, in Ethiopia for these peace talks, his regime was bombing a busy marketplace in his own country, killing one civilian and injuring six more.</p> <p>For the people of Sudan and Sorth Sudan, this new peace will look awfully and horrifically like business as usual.</p>",

  "<p>A year or so back I was scandalised by a keynote presentation at a higher education conference in which the speaker asserted that entertainment had no part in university teaching and learning. I broke a tacit rule of ultra-politeness at such events, rising to my feet to upbraid this stuff as nonsense. To me it seems obvious that some entertainment, appropriate humour and relevant (inter)activity can only aid retention of information. Detail alone just won't cut it over one or two hours with students - or anyone for that matter.</p> <p>I can still remember being on the receiving end of a bravura performance from the late (great) agricultural economics <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituary-professor-gerald-wibberley-1505254.html\" title=\"\">professor Gerald Wibberley</a>. I was lucky enough to be taught by 'Wibb' at London University's Wye College in the 1980s. He practised what seem like eternal virtues when it comes to inspiring students to learn, remember and be infected with interest in a subject. Wibberley was enthusiastic, well-informed and salted his sessions with examples drawn from direct experience, academic or otherwise.</p> <p>On one occasion he lectured about rural poverty with a childhood story of waking up in his Welsh farmstead home to find frost covering the inside of the window and his bedspread. You could tell that he was a practical academic too, who made a real difference to people's lives: his research was rigorous but accessible, drawn in equal measure from academic publications and practice. In the words of his <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituary-professor-gerald-wibberley-1505254.html\" title=\"\">obituary</a> his \"gift for public speaking was memorable; even his economics lectures gained the rapt attention of his students\".</p> <p>Surely our job as lecturers is to light the fire of curiosity and aspiration in our students, reminding ourselves of why we are here in the process. <a href=\"http://www.becominggreen.co.uk/Dr-Morgan-Phillips\" title=\"\">Morgan Phillips</a> of Becoming Green, a website about communicating sustainability, believes that inspirational teaching in higher education should nudge both students and staff towards \"fulfilling and meaningful lives, characterised by generosity, intelligence, community spirit, stable levels of self-esteem and maturity\". But as Ron Cooke, former vice-chancellor of York University, commented, the most crucial components of teaching are the most difficult to measure.</p> <p>This issue assumes heightened urgency when English universities are charging students up to \u00a39,000 per year tuition fees. A 2009 petition, signed by 600 students at the University of Bristol, noted how revenue per student from tuition fees has increased: \"<a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/universityeducation/5304524/Students-stage-rebellion-over-quality-of-teaching-after-tuition-fee-rise.html\" title=\"\">we simply ask that the quality of our education be improved accordingly</a>\".</p> <p>So what are the components of inspirational teaching? I recently undertook a small, informal piece of research at my own institution, the <a href=\"http://www.glos.ac.uk/Pages/default.aspx\" title=\"\">University of Gloucestershire</a>, asking this question of undergraduates studying sociology, history and criminology. The top three characteristics in rank order were that inspirational teaching is motivating; second, that it was felt to be encouraging; and third, that such teaching flowed from teachers passionate about their subject. Characteristics in close contention were that it should be entertaining (I rest my case with the keynote speaker), memorable, energetic, enthusing, fun, captivating and exciting.</p> <p>In 1997, authors Laura Cohen and Josef Jurkovic suggested various practical techniques to inspire student learning. These included shaking up accepted sequences to allow people to see the teaching process in a new light; breaking the rhythm (for example putting conclusions at the start and working back to an introduction); and finally so-called \"toying with success\". They write that \"toys have a liberating effect \u2026 a disarming way to break the ice, but they are also a deceptively powerful way to break down the barriers of rigid adult thinking\".</p> <p>More recently, David Kahane, a professor at Alberta University, argued that students are \"energized and inspired by highly participatory, contemplative courses. The methods and subject matters \u2026 speak to students' search for meaning in their lives and educations\". For more on this approach to pedagogy, see the research and activities of ACMHE (the Association for Contemplative Mind in Higher Education).</p> <p>It is of course worth acknowledging that such ideas about inspirational teaching are not new. Wilson \u2013 a teacher in 1918 \u2013 commented on the \"response awakened in the group and the individuals of the group through the teacher\". She described the class atmosphere as \"charged\u2026with a certain electric spark; there is colour, vigor, character, which the casual observer catches at once, but which is so difficult to define\".</p> <p>Think back to your most memorable teachers and be motivated. Let's aspire to inspire - both our students and ourselves.</p> <p><em>James Derounian is principal lecturer in community development and local governance at the </em><a href=\"http://www.glos.ac.uk/Pages/default.aspx\" title=\"\"><em>University of Gloucestershire</em></a></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by </strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/guardian-professional\" title=\"\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

  "<p>Environmental activists in the United States and Russia have come together to push for unprecedented protection for the polar bear, hoping to stave off the decline of its already dwindling population.</p> <p>With Arctic Sea ice at record low because of climate change, polar bears have been deprived of a key habitat and feeding ground. Legal trade in polar bears, mainly in the form of trophy skins and furs, remains legal under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (Cites), leading to the death of hundreds more each year.</p> <p>Activists from the International Fund for Animal Welfare (IFAW) and the Human Society International (HSI) are hoping to change that by supporting government initiatives to upgrade the polar bear's status from appendix two to one within the convention, thus banning all international commercial trade.</p> <p>\"The real opportunity to ban the trade is around the corner,\" said Jeffrey Flocken, head of IFAW's Washington DC office. Activists have been lobbying officials in the US to table the so-called \"uplist\" proposal by 4 October, ahead of a global Cites conference early next year, but fear US reluctance after a similar proposal did not pass a vote at the convention's last meeting in Doha in 2010.</p> <p>IFAW activists have also received written assurances from the Russian ministry of natural resources that it will support an initiative tabled by the US, according to a copy of the letter obtained by the Guardian. Activists hope that joint Russian-US support will help the motion receive the two-thirds vote it needs to pass inside the 176-country body.</p> <p>They warned of increasing urgency, following recent reports by the National Snow and Ice Data Centre in Boulder, Colorado that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/sep/19/arctic-ice-shrinks?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">Arctic Sea ice had declined to record lows</a>. At the same time, prices for polar bear skins have soared, prompting increased hunting and poaching.</p> <p>\"Polar bears are becoming more and more scarce, and that scarcity is driving up demand,\" said Teresa Telecky of HSI. \"It's helping drive the species towards extinction,\" she said.</p> <p>At a recent auction in Canada, two polar bear pelts fetched a record \u00a310,200 each \u2013 about double the price at auctions five years ago. Canada is the only country to allow its polar bears to be killed and sold on international markets, something its indigenous population argue is key to its survival and livelihood.</p> <p>In one Moscow shop, a large polar bear hide was going for 1.6m roubles (\u00a331,760). The luxury items are most popular among buyers in Russia and China.</p> <p>Russian websites have popped up to sell Cites certificates that indicate a legal kill under Canada's quota, something used by many of the poachers who kill an average 200 polar bears in Russia per year, activists said. Nearly 6,000 polar bears are believed to have been killed between 2001 and 2010, with that number increasing in the past two years, according to IFAW and HSI.</p> <p>The world's polar bear population is now estimated at around 20,000, activists said. The US Geological Survey warned in 2007 that diminishing sea ice could result in the loss of two-thirds of the world's polar bear population within 50 years.</p>",
  "<p>Lessons learned from deaths in police and prison custody are being repeatedly ignored or lost because there is no official body to enforce them, according to a charity that supports bereaved families at inquests.</p> <p>Many coroners' rule 43 reports, designed to prevent accidents and save lives, have negligible impact because there is no authority charged with ensuring compliance, the organisation Inquest has warned.</p> <p>Its report is launched as deaths in English and Welsh prisons are on an upward trend \u2013 having dipped to 155 in 2006, the annual number of fatalities climbed to 189 last year.</p> <p>Coincidentally, the ancient office of coroner, which dates to the Norman conquest, is undergoing an overhaul with the appointment this summer of the first chief coroner, Judge Peter Thornton QC.</p> <p>Thornton, who presided over the inquest last year into the death of Ian Tomlinson during the G20 protests in 2009, has suggested developing \"cadres\" of investigators specialising in military and custody fatalities. He attended the launch of Inquest's report.</p> <p>The study, Learning from Death in Custody Inquests, is backed by the former chief inspector of prisons Lord Ramsbotham who told the Guardian: \"For years, large numbers of people have been frustrated and worried by the fact that nothing which has been learned, either good or bad, appears to have been used to prevent further [deaths]. I would have hoped the government would be leading this from the top down [but it appears to be] bubbling up from practitioners.\"</p> <p>Ramsbotham is chairing an independent inquiry into the use of restraint techniques in relation to the death of the asylum seeker <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/jimmy-mubenga\" title=\"\">Jimmy Mubenga</a>, who was being deported by G4s guards at Heathrow airport in 2010. The report is due this autumn.</p> <p>The peer has pointed out that previous warnings about the dangers of restraint methods leading to so-called positional asphyxia were not adopted sufficiently. He called for the wider \"dissemination of lessons learnt from restraint deaths\".</p> <p>The charity Inquest has been monitoring deaths in custody for 30 years. \"One of the striking features of this work,\" the report says, \"has been our repeated experience of attending inquest after inquest where the same issues are identified as possibly contributing to a death.</p> <p>\"The more effective use of narrative verdicts [explaining precisely what occurred] and coroners' rule 43 reports is overwhelmingly likely to assist in the saving of lives. [But] the existing system is flawed.</p> <p>\"The lessons to be learned from the contents of these of these verdicts and reports are far too frequently lost: they are analysed poorly or ignored; misunderstood or misconstrued; dissipated or dismissed.\"</p> <p>There is no official body charged with enforcing compliance with recommendations made in rule 43 reports, according to the charity. It said: \"Once an inquest is over there is nothing to make sure those failings are addressed and acted upon by the relevant authority. The Prisons and Probation Ombudsman's recent annual report noted the 'deeply troubling' rise in the number of deaths in custody in the past year, the highest since 2004.\"</p> <p>Deborah Coles, co-director of Inquest and co-author of the report, said: \"The same systemic failings repeat themselves with depressing regularity at inquests into deaths in custody.</p> <p>\"With the incorporation of deaths in custody into the Corporate Manslaughter Act [2007] there is the need for a statutory mechanism to be put in place that ensures proper monitoring and analysis of narrative verdicts and rule 43 reports to see whether action has been taken to rectify dangerous practices and systems identified during an inquest. This is an important instrument for accountability.\"</p> <p>The Inquest report mentions Styal prison and young offender institution in Cheshire, which houses female inmates. \"Six women died there in the 12 months between August 2002 and August 2003,\" it says.</p> <p>\"At the conclusion of an inquest into a previous death in Styal prison in 2001, the coroner made a rule 43 report about the need to set up a detoxification regime for women withdrawing from drugs. This was not implemented until after the sixth death had occurred, which was over two years after his report was issued.\"</p>",
  "<p>The UK economy might be in the doldrums, but it's not for the want of trying by shoppers to drag Britain out of recession: we spent \u00a37.1bn on 120m purchases using credit cards in August. Admittedly we also paid off \u00a37.4bn, according to the British Bankers Association, but once interest was added the amount owed by shoppers was up by \u00a3100m over the month.</p> <p>There are plenty of reasons to use a credit card even if you don't want to borrow money: protection against shoddy goods or not receiving goods at all, provided by section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act for purchases costing more than \u00a3100; not having to carry wodges of mugger-attracting cash around on your person; and building a credit rating.</p> <p>But you should make sure you have the best option to suit the way you are using credit and to minimise the amount you may have to pay in interest. We have analysed what deals are available to help you make the most of your money.</p> <h2>I want a card for shopping but will pay off the balance in full</h2> <p>If you intend to clear your balance every month, you can concentrate on choosing a card which offers a loyalty scheme or cash back. Your decision really depends on which rewards you are most likely to use. Vouchers for shopping at Tesco? Opt for the Tesco Clubcard credit card. Free flights? The Virgin Atlantic credit card enables holders to convert flying club miles into Virgin Atlantic flights, upgrades, companion fares, spa days and more.</p> <p>Alternatively, opt for cashback. Sainsbury's pays 5% cashback on Sainsbury's shopping for the first three months, capped at \u00a350 a month, plus \u00a35 cashback each month when you spend at least \u00a3500, including at least \u00a3250 on Sainsbury's shopping.</p> <h2>I want to pay down my balance and pay as little interest as possible</h2> <p>Barclaycard Platinum offers the longest 0% balance transfer period \u2013 23 months \u2013 with a fee of 2.8%. The interest rate reverts to a representative 17.9% APR after 23 months. If you already have a Barclaycard and need to transfer your existing balance to a new deal, the next longest, at 22 months, is offered by Tesco Clubcard credit card for balance transfers (2.9% transfer fee) and Halifax (3.5% transfer fee).</p> <h2>I need a card to use on trips abroad</h2> <p>There has to be a plus side to hitting your 50th birthday, and the Saga Platinum credit card is probably it. The card charges 0% on purchases and balance transfers for nine months, and has a 0% foreign currency fee. The exchange rate applied to your purchases is set by Visa. Saga has a low \"go to\" rate of 11.9% APR after nine months, but cash withdrawals cost 19.6% APR.</p> <p>For younger shoppers, product comparison website <a href=\"http://www.moneysupermarket.com/\" title=\"MoneySupermarket website\">MoneySupermarket</a> has an exclusive deal on the Halifax Online Clarity credit card, which allows holders to use it anywhere worldwide without fees.</p> <h2>I want to make some big purchases and pay the bill gradually</h2> <p>The Tesco Clubcard credit card for purchases charges 0% for 16 months and on balance transfers for nine months, reverting to 16.9% APR at the end of these periods. It also doubles as a loyalty card, earning Clubcard points at a rate of one point for every \u00a34 spent on non-Tesco shopping and one point for every \u00a31 spent in Tesco.</p> <h2>I need a card, but my credit record is poor</h2> <p>You'd think banks would see logic in giving the cheapest deals to those struggling with debt. But the best, low interest deals are often closed to them because their credit records are less than sparkling.</p> <p>Capital One's Balance Card Visa has bucked the trend by offering a 0% balance transfer deal to those with an \"average\" credit history: this does not include those who have never borrowed credit in the UK before, have been declared bankrupt, had a county court judgment (CCJ) or been declared in default within the past 12 months.</p> <p>But if you incurred a CCJ more than 12 months ago, have paid your bills on time since and are on the electoral roll, you stand a chance of qualifying for seven months at 0%, with a balance transfer fee of 3%. Try to pay the balance off in that time; after that, the interest rate reverts to 34.9% APR.</p> <p>For those who want to rebuild their credit record, Capital One also offers the Secured Card, which has a \u00a3200 credit limit. The applicant has to pay a \"security\" sum of between \u00a349 and \u00a3200 in advance, refunded in full when you close the account. Again the interest rate is 34.9% APR, so only to be used as proof you can borrow and repay responsibly, not as a source of long-term credit.</p> <p>The Aqua Reward card pays cashback equivalent to 3% of purchase costs up to \u00a3100 a year, and has been designed for people with a poor credit record. This includes the self-employed who are unable to prove a regular income, full-time carers, people who are new to the UK, those who are not on the electoral roll, never had credit before or who have had previous CCJs or defaults. The card has an initial credit limit of \u00a3250-\u00a31,600 and again an interest rate of 34.9% APR.</p> <p>\u25a0 <a href=\"http://www.moneysupermarket.com/partners/guardian/cards/\" title=\"The best credit cards available at moneysupermarket.com\">Compare and apply for credit cards through Guardian Money Deals</a></p>",

The scene at Nasa was a tense one, similar to that of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/across-the-universe/2012/aug/06/curiosity-mars-rover-peanuts\">Curiosity's landing</a> back in August. Ground controllers held their collective breath as Mariner 9 approached Mars. If everything went to plan, the spacecraft would make history by being the first manmade object to go into orbit around Earth's neighbouring planet. </p> <p>Mariner 9 was an octagonal spacecraft just less than a metre and a half across, with four cross-like solar panels sticking out another two metres from its body. Its mission was to map Mars. At the appointed time, the retrorockets fired and Mars' gravity took hold of the spacecraft.</p> <p>Soon afterwards, data began to flow back to Earth from the cameras. Images built up on the monitor screens line by line but the scientists stared in mounting disappointment. Nothing was visible. The whole planet was engulfed in a dust storm. All the exquisite geology that the spacecraft was meant to see lay buried under a blanket of suspended particles.</p> <p>All the personnel could do was wait for the dust to settle, and pray that the spacecraft would wait too. Even today spacecraft can be fickle things. Back then, they were positively cranky. They could fail at any time, for any of a thousand different unanticipated reasons. Mariner 8, for example, had been destroyed during its launch. </p> <p>Time was of the essence as the dust storm raged. Days turned to weeks until the Martian skies finally began to clear in January. As it did, one titanic mountainous peak after another broke through the murk. These were the extinct volcanoes of the <a href=\"http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/gallery/atlas/tharsis-montes.html\">Tharsis region</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396946130\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/30/1349000603006/NirgalVallisOnMars.png\" alt=\"Nirgal Vallis, a dry river channel on Mars.\" width=\"220\" height=\"165\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">In 1972, Mariner 9 returned the first images of dry rivers on Mars. This is Nirgal Vallis in the Red Planet's southern hemisphere. Photograph: NASA/JPL-Caltech.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: NASA/JPL-Caltech</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As the dust dropped out of the atmosphere, so the geology of Mars revealed itself: canyons and valleys, craters and plateaux. The <a href=\"http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/gallery/atlas/valles-marineris.html\">Mariner rift valley</a> was named after this spacecraft. And then there were the meandering channels. These were the real prize. Unmistakable to geologists, they were dried-up rivers. Water had once flowed on Mars.</p> <p>It is now 40 years since that first observational proof was beamed back to Earth. Every Mars mission since has corroborated the finding and yet new evidence for rivers or lakes still excites us more than anything else. The only news that could trump it would be the discovery of life on Mars.</p> <p>Friday's announcement that Nasa's Curiosity rover was driving across a <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2012/sep/28/curiosity-finds-ancient-riverbed-mars?intcmp=239\">dry river bed</a> allows us to imagine a time in the past when there was another blue planet in the solar system.</p> <p>The finding itself is not a surprise. From orbit, the landing region displayed an 'alluvial fan', which is similar to a river delta, where river-borne sediments are deposited. Instead, the excitement is because Curiosity can deliver the ground truth. According to Nasa, the sizes and shapes of stones offer clues to the speed and distance of a <a href=\"http://www.jpl.Nasa.gov/news/news.php?release=2012-305&amp;cid=release_2012-305\">long-ago stream's flow</a>. This is information that is impossible to estimate with any accuracy from orbital pictures.</p> <p>So Curiosity continues the grand tradition begun by Mariner 9 of detailing the evidence for Mars' past water. As its mission continues it may also see something else that Mariner 9 did: a dust storm. </p> <p>Martian dust storms are most likely to take place when the planet approaches the Sun. This will happen next in January 2013. At that time, the planet will receive almost 50% more energy from the Sun than when it is at its furthest point. Even now, the warmth and light are building.</p> <p>This extra heating melts the carbon dioxide ice from the polar caps to create a thicker, higher pressure atmosphere. As the gas tears around the planet, it can lift dust into the atmosphere and blanket the globe.</p> <p>Early results from Curiosity's 'weather station' instruments suggest that the pressure in the Martian atmosphere could already be rising <a href=\"http://www.alphagalileo.org/ViewItem.aspx?ItemId=124442&amp;CultureCode=en\">faster than expected</a>. The trouble is that no one understands the Martian atmosphere well enough to know whether this makes a storm more or less likely.</p> <p>If one does blow up, Curiosity is guaranteed a good view. Unlike Mariner 9, however, Nasa's latest Martian explorer will not be looking down from orbit, it will be right in the thick of it.</p> <p><em><a href=\"http://www.stuartclark.com\">Stuart Clark</a> is the author of <a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9781846972157\">The Sky's Dark Labyrinth</a> trilogy (Polygon).</em></p>",
  "<p>It is time to talk about how we live our lives in rich countries. As an international development agency, Oxfam has always sought to put poor people in the spotlight: to amplify their voices, to explain their struggles, to support their causes. This work will and must continue. But alongside it, we must now also confront the crisis of consumption within developed countries.</p> <p>Our work on climate change, along with all our partners and allies, has helped to show the human face of an environmental crisis. From Bangladesh to Johannesburg, we have supported climate tribunals in which those on the front lines of the climate crisis have explained their experiences of a changing climate, and voiced their anger \u2013 about shifting seasons which have cost them crops, and rising sea levels which have ruined their land.</p> <p>Along with our partners, supporters and allies, we showed that climate change is not only a question of arctic ice and polar bears but one of people. Not an issue evolving to affect the distant future but a current crisis already demanding urgent action today.</p> <p>We have always been clear that at the heart of climate change is a deep injustice: that those with least responsibility for causing the problem are the hardest hit by its impacts. We demanded that those who caused the problem by emitting excess greenhouse gases in the process of industrialisation, must take the lead in cutting emissions and delivering new finance to help poor countries to adapt to climate change and embark on low carbon development.</p> <p>But so far we haven't seen a concerted shift in the politics of rich countries to embrace a low-carbon future with the urgency that the climate crisis demands. Emission reduction targets have been set in most countries, but there is still insufficient political space almost everywhere to embrace the scale of change we need.</p> <p>The hard truth is that our lifestyles in rich countries are not compatible with our efforts to confront climate change. Our over-consumption of resources comes at the cost of the life chances of those who are denied their fair share of access to water, energy and food. But until we grasp this fact, our politicians will dodge the hard decisions.</p> <p>We will not achieve a quite radical transformation to a low carbon economy without a popular politics of fairness and thriving. One thing we feel must change at Oxfam in our campaigning on climate change, is to engage our supporters not only in thinking about the lives of poor people affected by climate change, but also about their own lives and lifestyles.</p> <p>Perhaps the time will come when instead of asking supporters to campaign with us on biofuels, we will urge them to give up their car. After all, when the people lead, the leaders will follow.</p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"http://policy-practice.oxfam.org.uk/our-people/senior-management/barbara-stocking\" title=\"\">Barbara Stocking</a> is the chief executive of Oxfam</p>"
