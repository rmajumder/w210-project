  "<p>A decade ago Libya was at the centre of dramatic stories alleging cloak-and-dagger diplomacy between then-BP boss Lord Browne, Colonel Gaddafi and MI6 agents. And barely 12 months ago British warplanes were in action over Tripoli \u2013 this time fighting to topple the North African dictator former prime minister Tony Blair had previously decided to embrace.</p> <p>But if these two events were seen by critics as the UK manoeuvring for an \"oil boom\" that would benefit both countries and an energy-hungry Blighty economy, it must be deemed a bit of a failure.</p> <p>Libya is indeed once again pumping out 1.5m barrels a day of very high-quality crude, a small amount of which is no doubt coming to UK refineries, but neither BP nor Shell is playing any role in that output.</p> <p>In fact it is American, Italian and even German companies that have been brought in by the new government in Tripoli to help it get back to business in double-quick time.</p> <p>Libya has an estimated 47bn barrels of proven oil reserves and while that looks small compared with, say, Saudi Arabia's 265bn, it is a lot more than Britain can lay claim to (less than 3bn).</p> <p>The light \"sweet\" crude from Libya is not only very high quality, it can also easily be extracted from shallow wells in desert areas at a cost that some put as low as $2 a barrel \u2013 not bad if you can sell for $114 on the global market.</p> <p>Five years ago, BP finally signed a Libyan deal worth $900m \u2013 its first in the country since Gaddafi nationalised all petroleum operations and threw out western businesses in 1974.</p> <p>But the exploration explosion by BP, Shell and others who subsequently re-entered the country never properly got under way: the Arab spring brought operations in Libya to a chaotic standstill 18 months ago.</p> <p>BP had 40 expatriate staffers in Libya before the civil war and as yet none has returned full-time. The 100 staff that had been taken on pre-2011 were kept on the payroll, even when they were unable, due to the unrest, to enter their offices.</p> <p>Now the odd BP expat is back making visits to Libya and there are hopes that exploration efforts in the Libyan desert and offshore in the Sirte Basin can restart. While the company says it is optimistic about general prospects, its attitude towards Libya is much less urgent than to the Gulf of Mexico or even Egypt.</p> <p>Shell signed a similar exploration deal in 2008, with a commitment to upgrade and modernise the Marsa al-Brega liquefied natural gas terminal south of Benghazi. But last May it suspended drilling and abandoned exploration in two blocks, citing disappointing results. Shell insists it is keeping an office in Libya and will continue to consider other opportunities but its retreat went down badly with the country's National Oil Corporation.</p> <p>ConocoPhillips of the US, Eni of Italy and Wintershall of Germany are all still plugging away with Libyan oil producers, and energy consultancy Wood Mackenzie believes prospects are good \u2013 for oil, but also for much cleaner gas.</p> <p>The oil business is a fickle one, with Kurdistan and the Arctic current flavours of the month for the oil giants. Despite Libya's credentials as a proven petroleum \"province\" close to European markets, in the absence of a major new discovery this oil-rich desert country remains out in the cold.</p>",
  "<p>What is most annoying about <a href=\"http://robertwilson.com/\" title=\"\">Robert Wilson</a>'s <strong>Walking</strong>? The adamantine amiability? The aura of sacredness? The meagre number of installations? Or the torturingly slow rate at which you're required to walk, as if wading through treacle? Usain Bolt would not be able to keep up the pace.</p> <p>At the end of this not-very-short day what matters \u2013 or irritates \u2013 most is that an imaginative idea should be so deficient in content. Wilson, the experimental American director best known for his collaboration with <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/philip-glass\" title=\"\">Philip Glass</a> on <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/2012/apr/23/how-we-made-einstein-on-the-beach\" title=\"\"><em>Einstein on the Beach</em></a>, has joined with two Dutch artists, Theun Mosk and Boukje Schweigman \u2013 first in the&nbsp;Netherlands, and now in Norfolk \u2013 to devise an installation-punctuated walk across a region of surpassing beauty and almost terrifying variety: three miles contains dunes, beach, woods, farmland. He describes himself as \"the chief architect\"; the Dutch artists \"fill in the spaces\". The audience's job is to \"interface with the landscape\". This means that you experience but don't think.</p> <p>Stripped of watch and phone, you set off singly at evenly spaced intervals across a field, towards a wooden box. \"The way will show itself,\" your guide whispers as she warns that you will spend some minutes in the pitch black. The way shows itself when someone opens a door. On the other side is an arena like a <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/artanddesign/rothko\" title=\"\">Rothko</a> painting: white sand, a conical, cinder-like hole in the centre, walls made of russet-coloured willow. Placed by your murmuring guide at a particular spot, you find yourself in a circle with your fellow walkers: all unmoving, all trapped in tacit agreement that they should not speak or look directly at each other. Bagsy the first to start a Mexican wave.</p> <p>Few events can have combined such fuzziness \u2013 \"every visitor gets space to create his or her own story\" \u2013 with such regimentation. You find your way by following white stones, as if you were a babe in the wood. If you stray off the path a jean-clad dryad yells you back on the right course. It's a dogged trudge from one installation to the next: from a wood-chip corridor to a clearing scattered with spongey seats, where you're obliged to have a rest \u2013 apples and bottles of water are lined up with military precision \u2013 and allowed to have a wee. Then onwards to a clay cone like a clown's hat, with an electronic whine inside it. Was the dead water rat on the path an accident or a tribute to <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/artanddesign/damienhirst\" title=\"\">Damien Hirst</a>?</p> <p>There are glimpses of the wonder and close examination of surroundings that such an excursion could provoke. From a wooden corridor plonked in the middle of rolling farmland you see framed a slice of landscape and skyscape \u2013 billowing clouds, intense green pasture. From a hillock you watch walkers winding trance-like, as if creating a crop circle. Struck by sunlight, a wooden box looks as if it's been irradiated from within. And in the last strange moment, spectators are turned both into human sacrifices and scanners of the skies. That could not have happened without Wilson's intervention. Almost everything else you could have got to on a day out. Without paying.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.wildworks.biz/\" title=\"\">Wildworks</a> proves you can be experimental and yet humane and shows that theatre which sails out of buildings and away from texts does not always abandon stories. <strong>Ark-ive</strong>, an interactive installation that explores the relationships humans have with animals, looks set to soar.</p> <p>Just outside the National, a grey clinker-built boat has been beached: constructed from recycled scenery and riverside salvage, it's about 17 metres long and has a 10 metre-high mast. A pack of long-muzzled black dogs wait patiently by the entrance: they're made out of wellington boots.</p> <p>Processing through the vessel two by two, the audience come across anecdotes, idiosyncratic menageries, exploitation, awe, sentimentality, comic identification. A glass case is filled with animal snow domes: spindly flamingos gangle like anorexic models. Hanging from a ceiling are index cards on which people have written about their encounters with non-domestic animals: one giraffe who nuzzled a child unexpectedly got a slap in the chops for its brass neck. Animal roars issue from a keyboard that will simulate a Noah-style storm; the cast will also use some of its beast sounds as secret signals for coffee breaks. In one corner the human and the bestial are completely fused when spectators' faces are elided on a screen with the creature with whom they have most in common. Volunteering that I was talkative, walked quickly and was heavy on the mascara, this critic ended up as a snow leopard.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395363157\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Observer/Pix/pictures/2012/8/24/1345831725640/ark-ive-national-theatre-010.jpg\" alt=\"ark-ive national theatre\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Wildworks\u2019 beautifully beastly Ark-ive installation outside the National Theatre, London: \u2018experimental and yet humane\u2019.  </span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Public Domain</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This is the start of a larger project and the beginning for a talented new designer. Naomi Kuyck-Cohen, a first-year student of theatre design, has beautifully added to <em>Ark-ive</em>, snipping filigree herds and individual creatures from card indexes and populating a map of the British Isles with tiny scissored-out beasts. I'm looking forward to the time when the theatre is populated by her designs.</p> <p>For another part of the National's exhilarating pop-up season, Bryony Lavery has written an apparently modest but actually surprising play about Shakespeare's children: the twins Judith and Hamnet and their elder sister Susanna. Written for young people and performed by students from London schools and youth theatres, <strong>Cesario</strong> runs for less than an hour but has a persistent non-heritage, unsaccharine attitude. Judith, taking her cue from all those cross-dressing Shakespeare twins, simply won't dress as a girl; her brother dies \u2013 as indeed he did. <em>Cesario</em> is sometimes indistinct but has an extraordinarily assured performance from 13-year-old Lola Turner and is beautifully spread out by Anthony Banks on the roof of the theatre, with wattle and daub and bright flowerbeds and a breezy atmosphere. In front of me, an incisive five-(and \u00be)-year-old was gripped and made \"quite\" sad by it. She did, though, have a query, one that speaks to the heart of a critic. Why, if Hamnet was dead, didn't he get off the stage?</p>",
  "<p>On Saturday, 17 January 1920, the <em>Manchester Guardian</em> reported with mild incredulity on one of the most extraordinary experiments in modern democratic history. \"One minute after midnight tonight,\" the story began, \"America will become an entirely arid desert as far as alcoholics are concerned, any drinkable containing more than half of 1 per cent alcohol being forbidden.\" In fact, the Volstead Act \u2013 which prohibited the sale of \"intoxicating liquors\" \u2013 had come into operation at midnight the day before. But the authorities had granted drinkers one last day, one last session at the bar, before the iron shutters of Prohibition came down.</p> <p>Across the United States, many bars and restaurants marked the demise of the demon drink by handing out free glasses of wine, brandy and whisky. Others saw one last opportunity to make a killing, charging an eye-watering \"20 to 30 dollars for a bottle of champagne, or a dollar to two dollars for a drink of whisky\". In some establishments, mournful dirges played while coffins were carried through the crowds of drinkers; in others, the walls were hung with black crepe. And in the most prestigious establishments, the <em>Guardian</em> noted, placards carried the ominous words: \"Exit booze. Doors close on Saturday.\"</p> <p>In an age when individual freedom is all, it comes as something of a shock to reflect that in the world's most prosperous and dynamic country the prohibition of alcohol lasted for almost 14 years. Today we often think of Prohibition as a deluded experiment, instinctively associating it with images of Al&#xa0;Capone, the mafia and the Valentine's Day Massacre. In fact, the campaign to prohibit alcohol had been deeply rooted in Anglo-American society for some two centuries. The American Society for the Promotion of Temperance, for example, was founded in 1826, and by the following decade as many as a million Americans belonged to an anti-alcohol group of some kind.</p> <p>Far from being repressive authoritarians, Prohibition's largely Protestant champions \u2013 a large proportion of whom were high-minded middle-class women \u2013 were the do-gooders of the day. Often deeply religious, they saw Prohibition as a kind of social reform, a crusade to clean up the American city and restore the founding virtues of the godly republic. Many were involved in other progressive campaigns, too, notably the anti-slavery movement of the 1850s. And as American cities boomed after the civil war, swollen with immigrants from southern and eastern Europe, the campaigners' hatred of alcohol became steadily more ferocious. They looked in horror on the new saloons of the expanding cities, with their card games and fist fights, their bad boys and good-time girls. In particular, they became convinced that alcohol was a deadly threat to the health and virtue of American womanhood \u2013 not, perhaps, entirely erroneously, since papers of the time were full of stories of battered wives and broken&#xa0;marriages.</p> <p>The first state to outlaw alcohol entirely was, not surprisingly, a Protestant stronghold, the New England state of Maine, which introduced Prohibition in 1851. (Few people now realise that, thanks to the influence of the Lancashire temperance movement, Maine Road, the street where Manchester City's famous old stadium was based, was named in honour of the state that pioneered Prohibition. It had been formerly known as Dog Kennel Lane, which would probably have been an unfortunate name for a football ground.) At the national level, though, Prohibition took a long time to get off the ground, and the Maine law was repealed only five years later. Many activists felt they had no choice but to take the law into their own hands: a good example was the ferocious evangelical Christian Carrie Nation, who stood almost 6ft tall. As Mrs Nation readily accepted, she had a daunting appearance: she once compared herself to a \"bulldog running along at the feet of Jesus, barking at what he doesn't like\". Her activities ranged from serenading the patrons of Kansas saloons to smashing up bars with rocks and hatchets, often accompanied by dozens of hymn-singing women. Arrested more than 30 times before her death in 1911, she found the money for her fines from the sale of souvenir hatchets.</p> <p>By the time of Carrie Nation's death, though, the campaign for Prohibition was gathering momentum. This was the heyday of progressive reform: to a generation of Protestant reformers, using the power of the state to regulate the anarchy of the industrial city and improve the lot of ordinary workers seemed only natural and reasonable. Outlawing alcohol, which they associated with disease and disorder, fitted nicely into this agenda. As early as 1916, some 26 out of 48 states were already dry, and once the United States entered the first world war, Prohibition became identified with patriotism \u2013 not least because German Americans, with their brewing traditions, were often against it. By December 1917, with the war in full swing, both houses of Congress had approved a constitutional amendment to ban alcohol. In January 1919, the Eighteenth Amendment had been ratified by 36 states, and that October, the Volstead Act \u2013 passed over President Woodrow Wilson's attempted veto \u2013 gave the federal authorities the power to stop the manufacture, sale or importation of \"intoxicating liquor\".</p> <p>Now prohibition was law. Unfortunately for its advocates, however, the federal government was never really equipped to enforce it. By the time the Volstead Act came into force, the heyday of progressive reform had already passed. The Republican presidents of the 1920s, Warren Harding and Calvin Coolidge, were both small-government conservatives, who shrank from high spending and federal intervention. Almost incredibly, only 1,500 federal agents were given the job of enforcing Prohibition \u2013 that is, about 30 for every state in the union. On top of that, the new regime never had unanimous public support, while neighbouring countries remained defiantly wet. Neither Mexico nor Canada had any intention of clamping down on breweries and distilleries near the American border; indeed, Britain's chancellor of the exchequer, Winston Churchill, thought that Prohibition was \"an affront to the whole history of mankind\".</p> <p>Above all, many Americans with a taste for liquor were determined to get hold of a drink one way or another. Illegal drinking dens had long flourished in big cities; indeed, the word \"speakeasy\" probably dates from the late 1880s. But now they bloomed as never before; historians estimate that by 1925, there were as many as 100,000 illegal bars in New York City alone, many of them tiny, spit-and-sawdust joints, others catering to the rich and well-connected. In Detroit, tantalisingly close to the Canadian border, smugglers used \"false floorboards in automobiles, second gas tanks, hidden compartments, even false-bottomed shopping baskets and suitcases, not to mention camouflaged flasks and hot water bottles\", as one account has it, to bring alcohol into the city. And somehow it speaks volumes that when the Michigan state police raided one Detroit bar, they found the local congressman, the local sheriff and the city's mayor all enjoying a drink.</p> <p>The big winners from Prohibition were, of course, the nation's gangsters. The law had only been in operation for an hour when the police recorded the first attempt to break it, with six armed men stealing some $100,000-worth of \"medicinal\" whisky from a train in Chicago. From the very beginning, criminals had recognised that Prohibition represented a marvellous business opportunity; in major cities, indeed, gangs had quietly been stockpiling booze supplies for weeks. Legend has it that the first gangster to grasp the real commercial potential of Prohibition, though, was racketeer Arnold Rothstein, whose agents had been responsible for rigging the baseball World Series in 1919. Establishing his&#xa0;\"office\" at Lindy's Restaurant in Midtown Manhattan, Rothstein brought alcohol across the Great Lakes and down the Hudson from Canada, and supplied it \u2013 at a handsome profit \u2013 to the city's gangsters.</p> <p>In 1928, Rothstein was murdered after a gambling dispute, but by then his fame was such that F Scott Fitzgerald used him as the model for Jay Gatsby's friend Meyer Wolfsheim in <em>The Great Gatsby</em>, a \"small, flatnosed Jew\" with cufflinks made from human teeth. Indeed, Gatsby himself \u2013 the quintessential self-made American hero \u2013 is alleged to have made his fortune from organised crime. \"He and this Wolfsheim bought up a lot of side-street drug stores here and in Chicago and sold grain alcohol over the counter,\" says Tom Buchanan. \"I picked him for a bootlegger the first time I saw him and I wasn't far wrong.\"</p> <p>By far the most celebrated gangster of the day, though, was Al Capone, a New York-born hoodlum who controlled much of the Chicago underworld in the mid-1920s. Living in splendour in the city's Lexington hotel, he was said to be raking in some $100m a year from casinos and speakeasies. To many people, he seemed a real-life Robin Hood, opening soup kitchens for the unemployed and giving large sums to charity. Unlike Sherwood Forest's finest, however, Capone had a pronounced taste for the good life, wearing smart suits and drinking expensive Templeton Rye whisky. \"I'm just a businessman,\" he used to say, \"giving the public what they want.\" But when, in 1929, Capone ordered the brutal machine-gunning of seven Chicago rivals in the Valentine's Day Massacre, public sympathy evaporated. That same year, Prohibition agent Eliot Ness began to investigate Capone's affairs, and in October 1931 \u2013 after Capone's efforts to nobble the jury had been defeated \u2013 he was sentenced to 11 years for tax evasion. He eventually died in prison of a heart attack; appropriately, perhaps, for the nation's most famous vice baron, his health had been eroded by syphilis.</p> <p>By the time Capone went down, support for Prohibition was already ebbing away. With newspapers alleging that as many as eight out of 10 congressmen drank on the quiet, it was obvious that the attempt to outlaw alcohol had failed. In March 1933, just weeks after he had been inaugurated, President Franklin D Roosevelt signed an amendment to the Volstead Act permitting the sale and consumption of beer with no more than 3.2% alcohol content. The Depression was in full swing, national morale was at rock bottom and, as Roosevelt put it, \"I think we could all do with a beer.\" And on 5 December 1933, Utah approved the Twenty-first Amendment, providing a majority for ratification and consigning national Prohibition to the history books.</p> <p>Yet although the age of Prohibition now feels very remote, the idea lives on. Alcohol is not, after all, the only drug to have been prohibited by law; many people who regard Prohibition as bizarre and misguided think nothing of outlawing, say, heroin or cocaine. We often forget, too, that many states chose to remain dry after 1933. Mississippi, the last entirely dry state, only repealed Prohibition in 1966. Even today, more than 500 municipalities across the United States are dry, often in strongly evangelical states. In a famously delicious irony, they include Moore County, Tennessee, the home of the Jack Daniel's distillery, although visitors are allowed to buy a \"commemorative\" bottle.</p> <p>The truth is that in many corners of the United States, opposition to alcohol dies hard. When Barack Obama was photographed with a very weak beer in hand at a Washington Wizards game, the phone-in lines smouldered with anger. \"The president is the president 24 hours a day,\" one caller said. \"I don't think he should drink on the job.\"</p>",
  "<p>When I was a teenager, my mother overheard me telling my peers that I was Jamaican, a clearly absurd statement from a half-Ghanaian, half-English girl whose first name is one of the most common in a major African language.</p> <p>My mother, born and raised in Ghana, was mortified. Although in part I was living out the now well-documented struggle of mixed race youngsters to grasp their identity, mainly I was just embarrassed. It wasn't cool to be African in those days and in my ignorant teenage way, I was acting out a much bigger crisis of confidence, one that had been swallowing Africans and spitting them out as permanent economic migrants in Europe and America ever since the end of colonialism.</p> <p>My family left Ghana in 1962, and in those days, leaving was permanent. Flights were few and expensive and spare cash was instead sent back home, establishing a remittance economy that exists to this day. Life abroad, in London in the case of my mother's family, meant access to a stable income, reliable healthcare, plentiful food and a credible education. Meanwhile, many African states began falling apart.</p> <p>The 90s, when I was so quick to deny any association with Africa, was the decade when wars from Sierra Leone to Rwanda formed one of the most lethal periods in African history since the end of the slave trade. It culminated in the <a href=\"http://www.economist.com/node/333429\" title=\"\"><em>Economist</em></a> dedicating a notorious cover in 2000 to what it described as \"the hopeless continent\", claiming that across Africa \"floods, famine\u2026 government-sponsored thuggery, and poverty and pestilence continue unabated\".</p> <p>Revolving door alternations between civilian and military rule continued in countries ranging from Nigeria to Burundi, Chad to Congo. The World Bank was offering financial bailouts, but with the condition that countries accepted the humiliating label of \"highly indebted poor country\". In Ghana <a href=\"http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/COUNTRIES/AFRICAEXT/0,,contentMDK:20236241~menuPK:488504~pagePK:146736~piPK:226340~theSitePK:258644,00.html\" title=\"\">HIPC</a>, as it was popularly known, became a term of derision and a symbol of battered pride.</p> <p>The sparkling literary talent <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/author/chimamanda-ngozi-adichie\" title=\"\">Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie</a> has said: \"If I had not grown up in Nigeria, if all I knew about Africa were from popular images, I, too, would think Africa was a place of beautiful landscape, beautiful animals and incomprehensible people fighting senseless wars, dying of poverty and Aids, unable to speak for themselves and waiting to be saved by a kind white foreigner.</p> <p>\"The consequence of the single story is this,\" Adichie continues. \"It robs people of dignity.\"</p> <p>For many Africans, the whole ideology that the western world was more sophisticated became internalised into a kind of inferiority complex. One of my uncles, when he returned to London after a period of schooling in Ghana, simply exclaimed: \"Back to civilisation.\" Anyone who could left and the subsequent brain drain only served to make matters worse.</p> <p>The flight of Africans from their own nations fuelled cartoon-like perceptions of the continent abroad, in which the <em>Economist</em> was far from alone. And this was the context in which I grew up. Pretending to be Jamaican seemed a sensible solution at the time.</p> <p>For my mother, that was the wake-up call she needed to organise our first trip to the west African land of her birth, an essential re-education in our roots. In 1995, we visited the Ghanaian capital, Accra, for the first time. I remember the usual things that people comment on when visiting equatorial African nations for the first time \u2013 the assault of hot air when stepping off the plane, which I confused with engine heat, the smell of spice and smoked fish on the air, and \u2013 most significantly for me \u2013 the fact that everyone was black. It sounds obvious but I had never really seen officials in uniform \u2013 immigration authorities, police, customs officers \u2013 with black skin. I don't think I had realised that there was a world in which black people could be in charge.</p> <p>That first trip shaped my future in ways I could never have imagined. In the almost two decades that followed, I have moulded all educational and professional decisions into the form of a road that would lead me back to Africa. I devoured African literature, studied African politics, wrote my thesis on African women and political power, worked in development, law and now journalism, all with a focus on Africa. A decade ago, a job with an international development foundation led me to Senegal, where I lived for two years. Then, in February, I moved to west Africa for the second time, now setting up shop in the city of my very first trip to the continent, Accra.</p> <p>Friends and relatives in the UK, even those who share my Ghanaian heritage, have repeatedly expressed astonishment at my desire to live in Africa. But the view from Ghana could not be more different. Far from being original, I find myself part of a narrative told with increasing fluency, as a steady stream of other European and American passport holders of African descent arrive at Ghana's Kotoka International airport, collect their worldly possessions from shipping containers at Tema port and search for homes in Accra's popular residential areas \u2013 Cantonments, East Legon and the Spintex Road.</p> <p>They pay up to two years' rent upfront in dollars, at London prices, and find jobs with the growing number of international companies and professional service providers in Ghana or, more commonly, start their own business. At some point, this ceased to be an individual journey and instead became a phenomenon with its own label \u2013 \"returnee\".</p> <p>There is a symmetry to the journey that returnees are making, which speaks volumes about the state of Africa today. Our parents left \u2013 exactly 50 years ago in my case \u2013 fleeing deteriorating economic conditions and limited opportunities at home. Now their children are forming an exodus from the crisis-ridden eurozone, four years of recession and the dogged perception of inequality and discrimination in the west. \"Who needs the glass ceiling when you could be running your own business in one of the world's fastest-growing economies, enjoying the warm weather and surrounded by your own people?\" one returnee to Ghana told me. \"There is no contest.\"</p> <p>The facts about Africa's change in fortunes are dazzling. Dubbed the \"next Asia\" for its rapid growth, the IMF forecasts that seven of the world's fastest-growing economies over the next five years will be in Africa; Ethiopia, Mozambique,&#xa0;Tanzania, Congo, Ghana, Zambia and Nigeria are expected to expand by more than 6% a year until 2015.</p> <p>The resource-rich continent has benefited from a boom in commodity prices, ranging from cocoa to gold, but has also increased manufacturing output, which has doubled over the past decade. Surveys by firms such as Ernst &amp; Young, Goldman Sachs and McKinsey all describe how the telecom, banking, retail, construction and oil and gas industries are booming, sending foreign direct investment to dramatic new highs, while themselves representing an eagerness among global firms to attract business in Africa.</p> <p>In Ghana, whose <a href=\"http://www.howwemadeitinafrica.com/ghana-and-nigeria-among-worlds-fastest-growing-economies-in-20122013/16062/\" title=\"\">economy is one of the strongest</a>, with current growth of around 9%, the City of London is arriving in force. Investment banks, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_Circle_(law)\" title=\"\">magic circle</a> law firms and international consultancies are permanent fixtures at Accra's plush hotels, where they are literally queuing up to tout for business.</p> <p>With the growth in GDP comes a burgeoning middle class. The number of households earning more than $3,000 per year is expected to reach 100 million by 2015, putting the continent on a par with India. A recent report by the <a href=\"http://www.afdb.org/en/\" title=\"\">African Development Bank</a> on Africa over the next 50 years predicts that \"most African countries will attain upper middle income status, and the extreme forms of poverty will have been eliminated\".</p> <p>It's hard to overstate the impact of mobile technology on this transformation. Mobile penetration in Africa is now around 50%, forming the fastest-growing mobile market in the world. There are 100 million in Nigeria alone, a country that 20 years ago had only 100,000 phone lines. Telecoms companies now compete fiercely for almost 700 million consumers, not just to make calls, but for mobile money transfers, banking or even tracking agricultural and commodities data for farmers.</p> <p>Seven per cent of Africans have access to broadband, but this is expected to reach 99% by 2060. New infrastructure such as the fibre-optic submarine cables now connecting south and east Africa, and due to connect west Africa this year, are playing a role in transforming productivity and making online technology realistic for African&#xa0;nations.</p> <p>There are comical collisions between new technology and old problems. In Ghana, whose impressive GDP growth has not been met with the requisite increase in national grid capacity, people are using Twitter to monitor the frequency of power outages. \"Lights off\", as it is colloquially, almost affectionately known, is endemic in many countries. Ghana's power failures pale in comparison to Nigeria, where Lagossians say that if they have four hours of continuous mains electricity, then it is a good day.</p> <p>These contradictions are the reality in most African countries. Economic growth is neither designed nor distributed evenly. And, in reality, it has not been matched by the kind of improvement in living conditions that many of my grandparents' generation expected when they witnessed independence from colonial rule.</p> <p>The reality is that many African governments still serve primarily as agencies for the distribution of foreign aid. As the Ugandan journalist Andrew Mwenda has said: \"Most of the rich countries are attracted to Africa's poverty rather than its wealth. And in the process they end up subsidising our failures, rather than rewarding our&#xa0;accomplishments.\"</p> <p>There is plenty of poverty to be attracted to. Average life expectancy is still only 56 years, child mortality remains high at 127 per 1,000 live births in 2010, and overall literacy rates are only 67%. Africa's economic growth is often described as \"jobless\" for its failure to create jobs, in particular for the 60% of Africans aged between 15 and 24 who are unemployed and who, a recent report found, have given up on finding work.</p> <p>With these seemingly incompatible realities existing side by side, there is increasingly a PR war for the image of Africa overseas. The <em>Economist</em>, still apologising for its <a href=\"http://www.economist.com/node/333429\" title=\"\">\"hopeless continent\" issue in 2000</a>, recently branded Africa \"<a href=\"http://www.economist.com/node/21541015\" title=\"\">hopeful</a>\" instead. Most international news outlets now have programmes or seasons specifically designed to champion positive news stories in Africa. The BBC runs <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-15340893\" title=\"\"><em>African Dream</em></a>, a series about successful African entrepreneurs, while CNN has <a href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/CNNI/Programs/africanvoices/index.html\" title=\"\"><em>African Voices</em></a>.</p> <p>But it is not the role of the media to sell a rebranded version of Africa, any more than it was right to paint it as the heart of darkness in the past. The problems remain and they are real. Since I moved to Ghana in February as west Africa correspondent for the Guardian and Observer, there have been two military coups. Everyone living in Ghana \u2013 rich and poor \u2013 is lumped together in a permanent jumble of terrible traffic, unreliable water and frequent power outages. Poverty is real here, there is hunger and disease, and there is no welfare state. Far from setting out policies that promise any real social change, many African governments are focused instead on administering foreign aid and directing showcase infrastructure projects that do little to benefit ordinary people.</p> <p>As a journalist, I navigate both these worlds, and it is not always easy. When I wrote an <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2012/jun/10/afua-hirsch-ghana-sex-attitudes\" title=\"\"><em>Observer</em> column</a> about attitudes towards sex in Ghana, I was bombarded with criticism from both ends of the spectrum. On one side, Ghanaians claimed I perpetuated outdated stereotypes by describing sex as taboo and often transactional in nature. On the other were NGO workers who complained that I had failed to mention female genital mutilation and maternal mortality, in their view central features of the African sexual experience.</p> <p>The battle for the image of Africa \u2013 helpless and underdeveloped versus rapidly emerging economic giant \u2013 often gets personal. Journalists frequently, and rightly, draw criticism for describing a continent of 54 nations and breathtaking diversity as one country. But some commentators are quick to employ a definition of what it means to be African that excludes returnees like me for being too fair-skinned, too British or too westernised.</p> <p>But being African is an increasingly complex identity. As someone who has been told she is too black to be British, and too British to be African, I am strongly against the notion that identity can be policed by some external standard. And I am not alone. The term \"Afropolitan\" is beginning to enter the mainstream; one definition describes it as: \"An African from the continent of dual nationality, an African born in the diaspora, or an African who identifies with their African and European heritage and mixed culture.</p> <p>\"It doesn't matter whether they are born abroad or not; the important thing is their global perspective on issues, as well as their mixed cultural identity.\"</p> <p>The enthusiasm with which people of African heritage around the world are embracing their roots has reached the level of a cultural resurgence. In stark contrast to my teenage Africa-denial, a significant number of international cultural icons are now African. The black British music scene is dominated by rappers with Ghanaian heritage \u2013 Tinchy Stryder, Dizzee Rascal and Sway. Azonto, a popular Ghanaian dance, has begun colonising clubs in London, a growing number of which now include Afrobeat on regular rotation.</p> <p>This is not to dismiss the inequalities that still exist between Africa's increasingly visible international, urban elite \u2013 a category many returnees fall into \u2013 and the vast majority of Africans.</p> <p>The reality is that, on so many levels, access to the west is still a fault line for determining privilege. For example, entrepreneurs in west Africa currently find that borrowing money for their businesses typically comes with interest rates of up to 30%, an unrealistic burden by any standard. Returnees, on the other hand, who have access to loans from foreign banks, can enjoy single-digit interest rates, effectively dominating local markets.</p> <p>Africa is entering its new dawn, like all societies, with these divisions and inequalities as part of the story. For me, there is a very literal sense with which the past meets the future. On the weekends, from my home in Accra, I often visit a town in the mountains behind the city \u2013 Aburi \u2013 where my ancestors lived. My grandmother tells me the story of how her grandmother used to roll palm oil in barrels down the hill and on to the coast. These days, I like to visit a restaurant there, set up by a British Ghanaian returnee, and eat Ghanaian food \u2013 or pizza, depending on my mood \u2013 alongside so many other fugitives from the polluted city, enjoying the cool mountain air.</p> <p>When she reached the ocean, my great-great grandmother would board a boat westwards along the coast to Takoradi, where she was from. These days, Takoradi is a hub of activity for barrels of a different kind of oil \u2013 crude \u2013 which have transformed Ghana's economy into one of the fastest growing in the world. I think she would be happy that her great-great granddaughter had returned to see that transformation for herself.</p>",
  "<h2><strong>1 HIPPO WATER ROLLER</strong></h2> <p><strong>Idea: </strong>The <a href=\"http://hipporoller.org/\" title=\"\">Hippo water roller</a> is a&#xa0;drum that can be rolled on the ground, making it easier for those without access to taps to haul larger amounts of water faster.</p> <p><strong>Problem: </strong>Two out of every five people in Africa have no nearby water facilities and are forced to walk long distances to reach water sources. Traditional methods of balancing heavy loads of water on the head limit the amount people can carry, and cause long-term spinal injuries. Women and children usually carry out these time-consuming tasks, missing out on educational and economic opportunities. In extreme cases, they can be at increased risks of assault or rape when travelling long distances.</p> <p><strong>Method: </strong>The Hippo roller can be filled with water which is then pushed or pulled using a handle. The weight of the water is spread evenly so a full drum carries almost five times more than traditional containers, but weighs in at half the usual 20kg, allowing it to be transported faster. A steel handle has been designed to allow two&#xa0;pushers for steeper hills. \"Essentially it alleviates the suffering people endure just to collect water and take it home. Boreholes or wells can dry out but people can still use the same roller [in other wells]. One roller will typically serve a household of seven for five to seven years,\" said project manager Grant Gibbs.</p> <p><strong>Verdict:</strong> Around 42,000 Hippo rollers have been sold in 21 African countries and demand exceeds supply. Costing $125 each, they are distributed through NGOs. A mobile manufacturing unit is set to begin making them in Tanzania. Nelson Mandela has made a \"personal appeal\" for supporting for the project, saying it \"will positively change the lives of millions of our fellow South&#xa0;Africans\". <strong>Monica Mark</strong></p> <p><strong> </strong></p> <h2><strong>2 THE iCOW APP </strong></h2> <p><strong>Idea: </strong>To harness the power of mobile phones to encourage best practice for dairy farmers and increase milk production.</p> <p><strong>Problem:</strong> Small-scale dairy farmers often living in remote areas don't have access to valuable information about latest prices of milk or cattle, and they may not keep accurate records of important details such as their cows' gestation periods or their livestock's lineage \u2013 often resulting in inbreeding and disease.</p> <p><strong>Method:</strong> Created by Kenyan farmer <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3wD8pzIcCJk\" title=\"\">Su&#xa0;Kahumbu</a>, <a href=\"http://www.icow.co.ke/\" title=\"\">iCow</a> is an app that works on the type of basic mobile phones farmers own. Each animal is registered with the service, which then sends SMS reminders to the farmer about milking schedules, immunisation dates and tips about nutrition and breeding or information about local vets or artificial insemination providers. UK-based foundation the <a href=\"http://indigotrust.wordpress.com/\" title=\"\">Indigo Trust</a> helped fund iCow's development. Its executive Loren Treisman says: \"It's exciting to see a technology-driven project targeting such an unexpected constituency. Farmers have been empowered to improve their own lives through accessing critical agricultural information as opposed to depending on aid. What particularly excited us is that as a social enterprise, the iCow team have a sustainable business model which will enable them to expand rapidly and maximise their reach and impact without dependence on ongoing&#xa0;funding.\"</p> <p><strong>Verdict:</strong> \"The wonderful thing with iCow is that by the time you have used the app and adhered to all the instructions, your cows end up healthier, bigger and stronger. They can easily fetch you more money in the marketplace. Every smart farmer will use iCow,\" a small-scale farmer based in the cental highlands of Kenya told <em>Forbes </em>magazine. <strong>Ian Tucker</strong></p> <h2><strong>3 FARMER MANAGED NATURAL REGENERATION </strong></h2> <p><strong>Idea:</strong> Farmer managed natural regeneration (FMNR), which restores existing trees on drought-stricken land, to improve Senegal's dwindling harvests.</p> <p><strong>Problem:</strong> Senegal is suffering its third drought of the decade, resulting in reduced crops and inflated food prices. The World Food Programme assisted more than 9 million people in the Sahel region of West Africa this year, including 800,000 in Senegal.</p> <p><strong>Method:</strong> Attempts to tackle the resulting problem of soil fertility have largely flopped so far. Trees planted as part of reforestation schemes have seen only a 5% success rate and fallowing is not an option, with 80% of African farmers owning under two hectares of land, which need to be utilised year in, year out. This puts the emphasis on reinvigorating the stumps of nitrogen-fixing trees, which were formerly cleared to maximise crop space. Farmers are thus encouraged to prune the stems and branches of trees like <em>Faidherbia albida</em>, giving new life to the vegetation already there.</p> <p><strong>Verdict:</strong> FMNR is an inexpensive way for farmers to make improvements with the resources they already have, increasing millet harvests from 430kg to 750kg a hectare, and saving money on fertilisers, with restored trees producing leaf litter (forming humus) and giving shade to livestock (for manure). It gives the ecosystem a holistic boost, encouraging wildlife like bush pigeons and rabbits to return, and providing welcome human benefits such as wood cuttings&#xa0;for cooking and new food sources such as tamarind. <strong>Mina Holland</strong></p> <h2><strong>4 PORTABLE WATER PUMPS </strong></h2> <p><strong>Idea:</strong> Portable irrigation technology helping sub-Saharan smallholder farmers grow crops out of season.</p> <p><strong>Problem:</strong> When it comes to food supply, Africa faces enormous instability due to unpredictable climate and poor resources. Only 6% of Africa's cultivated land is irrigated, limiting the volume of crops that can be grown out of season, but increased access to irrigation systems stands to increase food productivity by up to&#xa0;50%.</p> <p><strong>Method:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.kickstart.org/\" title=\"\">Kick Start</a>, a not-for-profit organisation that specialises in irrigation technology, is making portable water pumps accessible to farming communities across Africa \u2013 most significantly in Kenya, Tanzania and Mali. These cost anything from $35 to $95 but, putting the emphasis on entrepreneurship, Kick Start are selling the pumps to farmers rather than giving them away.</p> <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Kick Start told <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/\" title=\"\"><em>The Atlantic</em> </a>that, since 1991, their pumps have lifted 667,000 people out of poverty, helping to \"create an entrepreneurial middle class, starting with the family farm\". They have pumped new revenues equivalent to 0.6% of the GDP in Kenya&#xa0;alone. <strong>MH</strong></p> <h2><strong>5 THE CARDIOPAD </strong></h2> <p><strong>Idea: </strong>A computer tablet diagnoses heart disease in rural households with limited access to medical services.</p> <p><strong>Problem:</strong> Cardiovascular diseases kill some 17 million worldwide annually. In many African countries, those at risk often have to spend huge amounts of money and travel hundreds of miles to reach heart specialists concentrated in main urban centres. The Cameroon Heart Foundation has noted a \"sharp spike\" in heart disease among its 20 million-strong population, which is served by fewer than 40 heart&#xa0;specialists.</p> <p><strong>Method: </strong>A program on the Cardiopad, designed by 24-year-old Cameroonian engineer Arthur Zang, collects signals generated by the rhythmic contraction&#xa0;and expansion of a patient's heart. Electrodes are fixed near the patient's heart. Africa's first fully touch-screen medical tablet then produces a moving graphical depiction of the cardiac cycle, which is wirelessly&#xa0;transmitted over GSM networks to a cardiologist for interpretation and diagnosis. \"I&#xa0;designed the Cardiopad to resolve a&#xa0;pressing problem. If a cardiac exam is prescribed for a patient in Garoua in the north of the country, they are&#xa0;obliged to travel&#xa0;a distance&#xa0;of over 900km to Yaound\u00e9 or Douala,\" Zang says.</p> <p><strong>Verdict: </strong>At the Laquintinie, one of the country's biggest hospitals, cardiologist Dr Daniel Lemogoum said that, in a recent survey, three in every five persons who uses&#xa0;the Cardiopad has been&#xa0;diagnosed as hypertensive, or at risk of heart diseases. \"These are people who&#xa0;would not necessarily have been aware they are hypertensive. It means sudden&#xa0;deaths might be&#xa0;preventable.\" <strong>MM</strong></p> <h2><strong>6 NIGERIAN COMPUTER TABLET</strong></h2> <p><strong> </strong></p> <p> <strong>Idea: </strong><a href=\"http://enciphergroup.com/products/pre-order-inye-tablet/\" title=\"\">The Inye computer tablet</a> that can connect to the internet via a dongle surmounts the price and infrastructure barriers in one go.</p> <p><strong>Problem:</strong> Tech-savvy youths, who make up the bulk of the continent's population, face being left behind by a growing \"digital divide\". While much of Africa has skipped the desktop internet era and gone straight to mobile tech, big name brands retail in price ranges that remain out of reach for a majority in sub-Saharan Africa. Infrastructure is also straining under rapid population growth, and wireless and broadband technology is not yet widely available in many public places.</p> <p><strong>Method: </strong>Co-founders Saheed Adepoju and Anibe Agamah, aimed to plug a gap in affordable mobile devices with the Inye tablet in Nigeria. They say its strongest selling point is its price \u2013 currently around \u00a3200. Run on Android systems, it can be connected to the internet via widely used dongles rather than wirelessly. IT provider <a href=\"http://enciphergroup.com/\" title=\"\">Encipher</a> also offers add-on bundles from games to specifically tailored apps. Local developers are designing apps that address issues such as HIV, water and sanitation and education.</p> <p><strong>Verdict: </strong>The group is now retailing its <a href=\"http://enciphergroup.com/products/inye2/\" title=\"\">Inye 2 model</a> to popular demand. Long-term, there are plans to expand beyond Africa's most populous country. <strong>MM</strong></p> <h2><strong>7 ETHANOL COOKING OIL PLANT</strong></h2> <p><strong>Idea: </strong>Refining locally sourced cassava into ethanol fuel to provide cleaner cooking fuel.</p> <p><strong>Problem: </strong>Forests in Africa are being cut down at a rate of 4m hectares a year, more than twice the worldwide average rate. Some of this is fuelled by demand for wood and charcoal, which the UN estimates is still used in almost 80% of African homes as a cheaper option to gas. The smoke from cooking using these solid fuels also triggers respiratory problems that cause nearly 2 million deaths in the developing world each year.</p> <p><strong>Method: </strong><a href=\"http://www.cleanstarmozambique.com/\" title=\"\">CleanStar Mozambique</a>, a partnership between CleanStar and Danish industrial enzymes producer <a href=\"http://www.novozymes.com/en/Pages/default.aspx\" title=\"\">Novozymes</a>, has opened the world's first sustainable cooking-fuel plant in Mozambique. CleanStar has steered clear of monoculture crops in favour of sustainable farming methods. One-sixth of the final yield comes from locally harvested cassava, which requires farmers to plant in rotation with other edible crops to keep the soil fertile. A Sofala Province-based plant transforms the products into ethanol, which is sold on the local market along with adapted cooking stoves also produced by the company.</p> <p><strong>Verdict: </strong>\"City women are tired of watching charcoal prices rise, carrying dirty fuel, and waiting for the day that they can afford a safe gas stove and a reliable supply of imported cylinders,\" CleanStar marketing director Thelma Venichand said. \"They are ready to buy a modern cooking device that uses clean, locally made fuel, performs well and saves them time and money.\" The plant aims to produce 2m litres of fuel annually, and reach 120,000 households within three years. <strong>MM</strong></p> <h2><strong>8 REFUGEES UNITED</strong></h2> <p><strong>Idea: </strong>Danish brothers David and Christopher Mikkelsen founded <a href=\"http://www.refunite.org/\" title=\"\">Refugees United</a> in 2008 after they helped a young Afghan refugee in Copenhagen search for lost family members. Realising the futile paper trail that many refugees were faced with when looking for missing relatives, the brothers wanted to find an easier way that refugees could trace their families.</p> <p><strong>Problem:</strong> There are 43 million forcibly displaced people worldwide with hundreds of thousands of refugee families scattered across the globe. Before 2008 all family tracing was done by refugee agencies, which still rely on paper forms and postal systems to try to locate people. There was no online global data bank that could be accessed or used by refugees themselves.</p> <p><strong>Technique: </strong>Refugees United is an online search tool, where refugees can create a free profile and start their search for family via an online database using the internet or a mobile phone. It works through an open-source model, partnering with not-for-profit refugee organisations including the Red Cross and the <a href=\"http://www.unhcr.org.uk/\" title=\"\">UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR)</a> as well as corporate tech partners such as Erickson and Google.</p> <p><strong>Verdict: </strong>More than 100,000 people are registered on the Refugees United family tracing platform. It is available in dozens of different languages and contains searchable information on refugees from more than 82 countries. It is currently helping 15,000 people trace family in the Kakuma refugee camp, home to 80,000 refugees and asylum-seekers, in Kenya. The main challenge is actually reaching the refugees, often the poorest of the poor, who don't have ready access to computers or mobile phones. <strong>Annie Kelly</strong></p> <h2>9 <strong>DIY AID SUPPLIES</strong></h2> <p><strong>Idea:</strong> To make Africa self-sufficient in emergency relief supplies.</p> <p><strong>Problem:</strong> For a continent so in need of quick, affordable emergency relief, not to mention so riddled with unemployment, there's a cruel irony about the provenance of emergency supplies. Smaller African manufacturers have traditionally been unable to compete with Chinese prices, or to meet the vast demand for emergency goods within Africa. As a result, aid agencies such as <a href=\"http://www.unicef.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Unicef</a> have forged links with foreign producers better able to produce these supplies at the scale, cost and quality required. Yet this inevitably requires longer lead times and higher transportation costs than sourcing goods locally \u2013 and Africans lose out on the work.</p> <p><strong>Method:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.advanceaid.org/\" title=\"\">Advance Aid</a> is an organisation that wants to make aid destined for Africa available within Africa, from blankets and mosquito nets to basic cooking equipment and hygiene kits. The organisation acts as an intermediary between large aid agencies and African producers, putting together packages of aid supplies sourced locally. This has been very effective in Kenya, where <a href=\"http://www.advanceaid.org/\" title=\"\">Advance Aid</a> have supplied 5,000 locally sourced emergency kits to <a href=\"http://www.worldvision.org.uk/\" title=\"\">World Vision</a> and another 14,000 jerry cans to <a href=\"http://crs.org/africa/\" title=\"\">Catholic Relief Services</a>, who distributed them in Dadaab, the refugee camp near the Somalian border.</p> <p>Founder <a href=\"http://www.advanceaid.org/david-dickie/\" title=\"\">David Dickie</a> says: \"Aid is not working. I'm trying to turn the market on its head by creating jobs in Africa. Building this capacity in Africa will make a real difference to agencies, to the beneficiaries of the aid and to local businesses\u2026 [It] is a very efficient way of bringing together the development and humanitarian agendas.\"</p> <p><strong>Verdict:</strong> Advance Aid's work in Kenya in 2011 marks the first time that emergency relief goods produced in Africa have been provided for an African emergency, with 80% of goods sourced within the country. It put $1.5bn into the Kenyan economy and brought orders to 12 local manufacturers. <strong>MH</strong></p> <h2><strong>10 SICKLE CELL DISEASE RESEARCH</strong></h2> <p><strong>Idea:</strong> To carry out scientific research on sickle cell disease (SCD) and show that large-scale, cutting-edge genomic studies are possible in Africa.</p> <p><strong>Problem:</strong> Every year, 300,000 children worldwide are born with SCD, a genetic blood disorder that can result in severe anaemia. Seventy percent of these children, or 210,000, are born in Africa. Tanzania has one of the highest annual birth rates of SCD in the world and without treatment up to 90% of these children will die in early childhood. However, many of these deaths could be prevented by early diagnosis and treatment. A better understanding of the genetic and environmental mechanisms of the&#xa0;disease will lead to improved diagnosis and therapies.</p> <p><strong>Method:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.tropicalmedicine.ox.ac.uk/julie-makani\" title=\"\">Dr Julie Makani</a> from Muhimbili University in Tanzania is working with the <a href=\"http://www.wellcome.ac.uk/\" title=\"\">Wellcome Trust</a> to conduct a genome-wide association study (GWAS) in order to better understand the genetic and environmental factors affecting SCD. The Muhimbili Wellcome Programme originally aimed to follow 400 children but is now following 2,500, making it one of the largest, biomedical SCD resources in the world. Dr Makani says that the work \"provides validation that it is possible to conduct genomic research in Africa\".</p> <p><strong>Verdict:</strong> <a href=\"http://royalsociety.org/people/lorna-casselton/\" title=\"\">Professor Lorna Casselton</a> from the <a href=\"http://royalsociety.org/\" title=\"\">Royal Society</a> says: \"SCD has a severe toll on Africa, and high-quality research to lessen the burden is much needed. Dr Makani stands as a role model for other young African scientists wishing to make a difference.\" <strong>Olivia Honigsbaum</strong></p> <h2><strong>11 M-PEPEA</strong></h2> <p><strong>Idea:</strong> To offer emergency credit through mobile phones to people who don't have access to credit cards or bank loans.</p> <p><strong>Problem: </strong>Credit cards are still rarely available to Kenyans and bank loans are only authorised for large amounts of cash or as investments for buying homes or starting businesses. Often the only source of emergency cash is loan sharks, increasingly big business in Kenya, with borrowers signing ambiguous photocopied contracts and tying themselves into interest rates of 50% or more. <a href=\"http://raven.co.ke/mpepea%20services.html\" title=\"\">M-Pepea</a> was launched to try to bridge this gap.</p> <p><strong>Method: </strong>M-Pepea, set up in late 2010, provides its customers with emergency funds within a few hours. It partners with Kenyan businesses, with employees then able to use M-Pepea to get immediate loans of up to 20% of their monthly salary. The money is accessed through their mobile phones, with M-Pepea sending a special pin code to be used in cash machines. Money can also be collected at branches of <a href=\"https://www.safaricom.co.ke/\" title=\"\">Safaricom</a>, one of Kenya's largest mobile phone operators, and then deducted from the borrower's pay packet at&#xa0;the end of the month. M-Pepea charges around 10% interest rates on the loans, which are paid in full at the end of the&#xa0;month.</p> <p><strong>Verdict: </strong>M-Pepea has currently partnered with 20 businesses and has around 300 subscribers, and is hoping to have increased this to 20,000 by the end of 2013. Its partnership with Safaricom is encouraging but the company has run into problems with businesses defaulting. \"We're still in our initial phase, but we've seen how positively people have responded to the service,\" says David Munga, M-Pepea's 33-year-old founder. \"If, like&#xa0;many Kenyans, you've found yourself at the side of the road with a broken car, no credit card and no money in the bank, it's a way of getting yourself that money without having to get into trouble.\" <strong>AK</strong></p> <h2><strong>12 THE TUTU VAN </strong></h2> <p><strong>Idea:</strong> The brightly coloured <a href=\"http://www.desmondtutuhivcentre.org.za/page/prevention:%20tutu%20tester%20mobile%20unit/\" title=\"\">\"Tutu Tester\" van</a> is a mobile clinic that incorporates screening for tuberculosis (TB) and HIV into a general health check-up in order to overcome the stigma associated with these diseases.</p> <p><strong>Problem:</strong> South Africa is at the centre of an epidemic of TB/HIV co-infections. An estimated 5.7 million people are infected with HIV and, fuelled by HIV, the country's rate of TB has increased over the last 20 years to the point where it now has the third highest TB burden in the world. In the case of HIV, <a href=\"http://www.unaids.org/en/media/unaids/contentassets/dataimport/publications/irc-pub01/jc379-vct_en.pdf\" title=\"\">voluntary counselling and testing (VCT)</a> is vital for preventing and treating the disease. However, data from the <a href=\"http://www.desmondtutuhivcentre.org.za/\" title=\"\">Desmond Tutu HIV Foundation</a> conducted in communities most affected by HIV shows that VCT is often inaccessible or inadequately performed. This results in missed opportunities for prevention and increased morbidity and mortality \u2013 hence the need for new control strategies to keep the epidemic in check.</p> <p><strong>Method:</strong> The Tutu Tester is a mobile clinic that takes sophisticated testing equipment and trained staff (including a nurse, a counsellor and an educator) into areas without adequate health facilities. By framing TB and HIV screening within a battery of other healthy living tests, including pregnancy, diabetes and hypertension, people are encouraged to get tested for the diseases. Dr Linda-Gail Bekker, a leading scientist working with the foundation, says that data from these screens shows that \"the increase in TB has quite clearly tracked the increase in HIV&#xa0;rates\". Further, the introduction of <a href=\"http://www.who.int/hiv/topics/treatment/en/\" title=\"\">Antiretroviral therapy (ART)</a> for HIV has also led to a decline in the incidence of TB. This suggests that ART programs, if sufficiently implemented, may greatly assist in reducing TB mortality.</p> <p><strong>Verdict:</strong> There is still a stigma attached to HIV and TB. But as Liz Thebus, a healthcare worker at the Tutu Tester says: \"The outside world does not know whether someone wants to be screened for HIV or diabetes. They are in that respect much more&#xa0;anonymous.\" <strong>OH</strong></p> <h2><strong>13 ORANGE SWEET POTATO</strong></h2> <p><strong> </strong></p> <p><strong>Idea: </strong>Breeding sweet potatoes to contain betacarotene, to help in the fight against childhood blindness.</p> <p><strong>Problem:</strong> More than 3 million children in Africa suffer from blindness caused by vitamin A deficiency; in Uganda it is estimated that 28% of children are deficient. Currently aid agencies combat this problem by giving children vitamin A supplements, but addressing this issue with a locally grown food would be more sustainable.</p> <p><strong>Method:</strong> A new strain of sweet potato was conventionally bred which contains between four and six times as much betacarotene as a regular sweet potato \u2013 betacarotene is converted by the body into vitamin A. The <a href=\"http://www.harvestplus.org/content/orange-sweet-potato-makes-case-biofortification-works\" title=\"\">OSP (orange sweet potato)</a> was distributed to 10,000 farming households in Uganda; at the end of the two-year study vitamin A deficiency in non-breastfeeding children aged between 12 and 35 months fell from nearly 50% to 12%. Dr Christine Holz from the <a href=\"http://www.ifpri.org/\" title=\"\">International Food Policy Research Institute</a> who led the project said: \"Overall, these results add to the growing evidence base that OSP provides large amounts of vitamin&#xa0;A in the diet.\"</p> <p><strong>Verdict:</strong> Similar results were obtained from a sister project in Mozambique; now the scheme is being scaled up to reach 225,000 households by 2016. <strong>IT</strong></p> <h2><strong>14 SPEAKING BOOKS</strong></h2> <p><strong>Idea:</strong> A range of easy-to-use audio books designed to get potentially life-saving health messages out to millions of isolated people struggling with depression and mental health problems.</p> <p><strong>Problem: </strong>In 2003, Zane Wilson, the founder of the <a href=\"http://www.sadag.org/\" title=\"\">South African Depression &amp; Anxiety Group</a> (Sadag), the country's largest mental health initiative, was horrified at how suicide rates among young South Africans were spiking. Mental health carries a huge social stigma across Africa and information booklets designed to help people with depression or mental health problems simply weren't working, especially in remote communities with high illiteracy rates.&#xa0;People weren't getting the help they needed \u2013 a 2009 study showed that only a quarter of the 16.5% of South Africans suffering from&#xa0;mental health problems had received any kind of treatment.</p> <p><strong>Method: </strong>Speaking Books created a range of free books with simple audio buttons talking the user through each page. The first Speaking Book, voiced by South African actress and celebrity Lillian Dube, was called <em>Suicide Shouldn't Be a Secret</em> and focused on how depression is a real and treatable illness, encouraging people to get help when they need it.</p> <p><strong>Verdict: </strong>Speaking Books have now produced 48 titles in 24 different languages and are now used in 20 African countries across the continent. The books now tackle a number of critical healthcare issues outside of suicide prevention such as HIV and Aids, malaria, maternal health and clinical trials. Speaking Books has also expanded to China, India and South America. \"The situation we face in rural South Africa is the same in any other African country \u2013 low literacy compounded by lack of access to services and affordable healthcare,\" says Wilson. \"This means that patients are often not able to get help for many health problems. We believe that this interactive, durable, high-quality, hardcover book engages the user or patient, and allows them to build self-confidence and skills with a simple action plan\". <strong>AK</strong></p> <h2><strong>15 NARRATIVE EXPOSURE THERAPY</strong></h2> <p><strong> </strong></p> <p><strong>Idea:</strong> Narrative exposure therapy (NET) for Uganda's former child soldiers, encouraging storytelling to help&#xa0;come to terms with their experiences.</p> <p><strong>Problem: </strong>Abducted and forced into conscription by the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/mar/08/joseph-kony-lords-resistance-army\" title=\"\">Lord's Resistance Army</a> (LRA), over 25,000 Ugandan children were pushed into violent atrocities during a civil war that lasted 22 years, often killing their own families.

  "<p>American party conventions, for all their razzmatazz, lack the drama of their fictional depictions, including <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0057883/\" title=\"\"><em>The Best Man</em></a>, the 1964 film starring Henry Fonda and Cliff Robertson, a tale of skulduggery between two leading candidates for nomination that ends with both imploding.</p> <p>Sadly, there is no chance of similar drama in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/24/romney-speech-republican-national-convention?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">Tampa, Florida</a>, when the Grand Old Party meets tomorrow. A piece of choreographed theatre, its function is to anoint Mitt Romney as the candidate in front of the Republican party's panjandrums and their wealthy backers. Over five days, 50,000 party faithful and 15,000 media will go through the motions towards a foregone conclusion.</p> <p>If the beef in this story is not about who will be the candidate to fight Obama in the autumn, it is about a different issue of identity, perhaps even more critical. What will be pored over during the coming days is an issue even the candidate cannot ignore \u2013 the question of precisely what his party is and represents today.</p> <p>In past conventions, both Democratic and Republican candidates have been able to stand aside from damaging ideas promoted by their party activists. This time, Romney, not least because of his choice of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/22/mitt-romney-paul-ryan?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">Paul Ryan </a>as his running mate, will not have that luxury. A lacklustre candidate who has struggled to energise the base of a party that has, under the guidance of the Tea Party, lurched ever further right, Romney is caught on the horns of a dilemma. He cannot be seen to be disavowing his party's right wing too strongly, just as his political opponents will be earnestly studying the convention for fresh ammunition to discredit him.</p> <p>The reality is that the convention in Tampa will mark the end of a process that began in the last presidential election cycle with the rise of the Tea Party and the divisive figure of Sarah Palin, a movement whose strong influence within the party remains undiminished, despite questions, not least during the midterm elections two years ago, of how popular the movement was, and is, with the voters.</p> <p>Already there have been signs of the difficult course Romney will have to steer between electability and satisfying the Republican base. The recent repellent \u2013 and scientifically bizarre \u2013 remarks of Missouri's US Senate candidate <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/24/todd-akin-remain-missouri-senate-race?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">Todd Akin </a>about rape have framed his difficulties. For while the presidential candidate quickly called for Akin to withdraw from the race, he has had more difficulty extricating himself from the fact that his running mate Ryan has shared similar views to Akin on abortion.</p> <p>If that row has prefigured the convention, what will be discussed on the floor at Tampa is only likely to underline the damaging dynamics in the Republican party in an election year. The draft platform (usually something the candidate can quietly disregard) in circulation ahead of the meeting this year almost wilfully incorporates some of the most explosive potential issues in the coming weeks of the campaign. Described by the <em>New York Times </em>as a \"mean-spirited platform\" closer to the views of Paul Ryan than Romney, it is hostile to women's reproductive rights, immigration and gay marriage while embracing hardline Tea Party views on everything from national security to taxation.</p> <p>Controversially, a version of the draft acquired by CNN includes the commitment to an anti-abortion amendment to the constitution with no exemption for rape or incest, precisely Akin's position.</p> <p>And while its final shape has still to be determined it seems unlikely that Republican activists will \u2013 at the last moment \u2013 embrace a warmer and more centre right message.</p> <p>If content of the draft platform presents one risk to Romney, his own pitch, as it has been anticipated in the US media, is also a hazardous approach for a man who would defeat an incumbent to become president of the United States.</p> <p>It has been suggested that what Romney wants to emphasise is his record as a businessman, with the skills to turn the US economy around. This, in large part, is because his political history as governor of Massachusetts is littered with achievements, not least his version of state-mandated healthcare, that are anathema to a large part of his audience in Florida.</p> <p>The reality, as commentators such as Maureen Dowd in the <em>New York Times </em>have observed, is that the Republican core, despite the addition of Paul Ryan's fresh face, is \"ever more antediluvian, anti-women, anti-gay [and] conservative.\"</p> <p>Even on the issue of economic policy, the committee drafting the platform is looking thoroughly backward, appropriate perhaps for a party where members believe that dinosaurs and humans co-existed, to setting up a commission to consider linking the dollar to the gold standard.</p> <p>Which leaves Romney less room to manoeuvre than a candidate might like. While his tax plans and language on entitlement might cheer the base, he also needs to be attractive to a host of voting groups from single women to Democrat-leaning Hispanic voters currently put off by his party's language on immigration and older voters frightened over proposed changes to Medicare.</p> <p>The natural temptation for Romney should be to steer the party more closely to the safer central ground. But the evidence of the past few weeks, not least his selection of Ryan as running mate, suggests that is not on his mind. And if more evidence of which way Romney is leaning was required, it was provided last week in his off-the-cuff comments while visiting his native Michigan.</p> <p>Departing from script \u2013 his advisers say \u2013 he delivered <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/romney-jokes-about-his-birth-certificate-obama-campaign-accuses-him-of-embracing-birtherism/2012/08/24/bda35810-ee14-11e1-b0eb-dac6b50187ad_story.html\" title=\"\">a crude joke </a>that referenced the fallacious \"birther\" controversy that once fixated on the false notion that Obama was not born in Hawaii, but outside the US.</p> <p>That earned Romney a quick rebuke from the Obama campaign, accusing him of \"enlisting himself in the birther movement [that] should give pause to any rational voter across America\".</p> <p>In the final analysis, as the delegates begin to gather in Tampa, it is fair to say, as a general rule of politics, that parties get the candidates and the conferences they deserve. The capture of Republicanism by a base more interested in the narrow extremes of their own ideology rather than electability may cost them the election. Sadly, it also impoverishes the US political debate at a time when both sides should be looking for solutions to the country's pressing problems.</p>",
  "<p>Having inspected more than 2,000 physical education departments in secondary schools and evaluated the practice in primary schools and initial teacher training as one of Her Majesty's inspectors of schools, the recent coverage of the \"school sport\" issue has left feelings of deflation.</p> <p>The flood of recent comment reveals a low level of understanding. The debate is currently defined around \"competitive team games\" and \"Indian dance\" (or whatever) with no hint of any understanding of why these aspects are educationally \"good\" or \"less good\". Games and dance form only a part of the process needed to develop children's physical competence, or \"literacy\", a term that may assist non-specialists to get on the inside of the process.</p> <p>The superficiality of the debate has leant on thinking from the 19th century, focusing on the \"character-building\" nature of games, but dismisses dance as a pastime irrelevant to pupils' development. But in physical education, dance is a critical component; there is nothing else in the PE curriculum that develops pupils' ability to use the body to communicate moods, feelings and ideas \u2013 and these concepts merge into study of the arts. The chance fact that \"Indian dance\" was selected also shows a certain disdain for the movement patterns developed in other cultures; rather unfortunate to say the least.

No, actually, I'll say that again: sometimes Radio 4 dares you to imagine the impossible? It's not a question, actually, but the question mark is there to denote an example of HRT, or high rise terminal, the habit of ending one's sentences on a rising note, as if they're questions? You know? Like the Australians do?</p> <p>But not, heaven forbid, on Radio 4, Geoff Lindsey, a voice coach, told us on this week's <strong>Fry's English Delight</strong>. Idents (or adverts) on other radio stations, \"like Radio 5\", might indulge in such foreign, un-British fripperies. \"But not Radio 4,\" Fry quickly assured us. \"No,\" said Lindsey. \"Not Radio 4.\" Can you imagine, said Fry, and lapsed into American blockbusterese, \"Coming soon on Radio 4?\"</p> <p>Well, maybe it's good to sometimes have a little imagine. <em>Fry's English Delight</em>, a genial amble through some of the vagaries of the English language and how we speak it, was, this week, all about intonation. The importance of it. The way it lifts an otherwise unremarkable sentence. Not that you'd necessarily know this if you listen to Radio 4, where Charlotte Green's news reading and continuity announcing is enough to lull you into a persistent vegetative state.</p> <p>Radio 4 has lots of other voices these days, and yet <em>the</em> voice of Radio 4 is still located somewhere off the A3 in deepest Surrey, circa 1952, just before cocoa at bedtime. Where intonation always goes down at the end of the sentence, and nothing, not revolution in Syria, or Prince Harry's freshly revealed crown jewels, will overexcite its newsreaders.</p> <p>Though it could be worse. Ever wonder why Britain's supposedly finest actors sound like they're doing acting? <em>Fry's English Delight</em> revealed a small clue when we got to listen in on a group of students at the Royal Academy of Doing Acting, or Rada, as it's otherwise known, where we heard them being taught to speak like actors rather than&#xa0;people.</p> <p>The best bit of the programme, however, was a piece from the radio archive that had the person with the least intonation ever in conversation with someone with the most intonation ever, aka a Dalek chatting to a Welsh woman. It's fair to say the Welsh woman won.</p> <p>There were more Welsh voices on Fi Glover's <strong>The Listening Project</strong>, the Radio&#xa0;4 programme that records people who know each other asking each other the questions they've never asked each other before. It's a pity they don't do these as field recordings, as the interviewees sometimes sound like there's a studio manager listening in, which of course there is. Sarah Jane and Philip, though, a brother and sister from Wales, talked about Philip's time in prison, while their mother was recovering from breast cancer, and it was everything good radio should be: intimate, confidential, with intonation all over the place.</p> <p><em>The Listening Project</em> is modelled on an American show called <a href=\"http://storycorps.org/\" title=\"\"><em>StoryCorps</em></a>, and this week's programme carried an interview with David Islay, who devised it. <em>StoryCorps</em> has recorded more than 40,000 hours of conversations that are now in the national archive, but his favourite interviewees, he said, were some of the first.

He had the kind of authenticity that the students at the Royal Academy of Doing Acting can only dream of: \"She lights up my life,\" he said with a crack in his voice. \"When she says to me at night, 'Wouldn't you like a little ice-cream?', or, 'Would you please drink more water'. I mean, those aren't very romantic things to say, but they stir my heart. In my mind, in my heart, there has never been, there is not now, and never will be another Annie.\"</p>",
  "<p>Back in 1975, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/john-berger\" title=\"\">John Berger</a> and the Swiss photographer Jean Mohr produced an unusual book entitled <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/dec/18/seventh-man-john-berger-review\" title=\"\"><em>A Seventh Man</em></a> about the millions of rural migrants moving to western Europe to perform menial industrial labour. It fused poetic text, political analysis and striking images \u2013 one depicted a solitary figure on a horse and cart, having just left behind his ancestral land, slowly wending through sun-blazed dusty lanes in pursuit of a new life \u2013 in order to ask why those migrant workers are \"treated like replaceable parts of a machine? What compels them to leave their villages and accept this humiliation?\"</p> <p>The images in Taiwan-born, British-based journalist <a href=\"http://hsiaohung.squarespace.com/news/\" title=\"\">Hsiao-Hung Pai</a>'s <em>Scattered Sand</em> are descriptive rather than photographic, but in every other way her book is a worthy successor to <em>A Seventh Man</em>. It focuses on contemporary China, where the scale of rural migration \u2013 over 130 million men and women have left their home provinces in search of work \u2013 makes the demographic debates about modern-day Europe seem parochial and hysterical. It pays tribute to a class&#xa0;of people that, although exalted under Mao as a revolutionary vanguard, has constantly to face the threat of pauperisation. It amplifies sounds \u2013 plaintive chants, desperate petitions, exhausted prayers, sceptical curses \u2013 that are often drowned out by the stentorian boosterism of the state loudspeaker.</p> <p><em>Scattered Sand</em> (its name comes from a dismissive term given to unorganised rural migrants) can be seen as an anthology of ghost stories. Its subjects, compelled to move by stagnant local economies and corrupt officials flogging off land to corporations, are invisible to many Chinese urban dwellers who have no&#xa0;interest in learning about the crowded shacks or cheap hostels into which they squeeze. In Fujian province&#xa0;Pai learns of men who toil in unsafe mines for the equivalent of 18 pence a day, risking lung diseases for which they can't be compensated because they lack work contracts.</p> <p>And yet, what makes this book so important is that Pai rejects the all too common and deeply sinophobic assumption that China can only be described in quantum terms. It's commonly portrayed as too big, its recent transformations too vast to grasp, its population a muted and faceless army of drone labour. Pai, by contrast, treks to building sites few outsiders visit, wanders down side alleys to talk to the poor and the crooked, keeps in touch with her confidantes by letter and by phone over a number of years.</p> <p>From these intimacies she shows her subjects not as ghosts, but as decent, quietly heroic men and women who sacrifice blood, sweat and tears to support their families. Literally so: in the \"plasma economy\" of Henan, a province full of underground blood clinics, she meets a peasant who sells his blood up to three times a day, in part to pay off a fine for having more than one child.</p> <p>Injustices and indignities scream out of every page. Starting out in Moscow where around 50,000 migrants eke out livings in the face of skinhead violence, Pai moves across China \u2013 the brick kilns of the Yellow river region where child labourers are common, Sichuan where years after the 2008 earthquake millions live in temporary housing, the troubled region of Xinjiang in which anti-Muslim sentiment is rife \u2013 to present stories that run counter to the triumphalism of politicians, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starchitect\" title=\"\">starchitects</a> and speculators.</p> <p>The book shines an uncomfortable spotlight on Britain too. After all, it's our desire for cheap toys and clothes to which many Chinese factories cater. It's our fondness for the freedom and mobility promised by laptop computers that fuels the profits of companies such as Foxconn at whose factories <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/may/28/foxconn-plant-china-deaths-suicides\" title=\"\">nets have been installed</a> to stop workers jumping to their deaths. Are our labour laws perfect? A heartbreaking chapter in which Pai meets relatives of one of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2004/feb/06/china.uk?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">cockle pickers drowned at Morecambe Bay</a> in 2004 suggests not.</p> <p><em>Scattered Sand</em> does well to draw attention to the ways in which millions of Chinese people, in the face of physical threats and a censorious press, have gone on strikes and marches to protest against their conditions. Classic labour texts \u2013 <em>A Seventh Man</em>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/history/9780141188492/let-us-now-praise-famous-men\" title=\"\"><em>Let Us Now Praise Famous Men</em></a> \u2013 often privilege exploitation over resistance. Pai, diligent to the end, and writing out of love rather than hatred for China, holds on to the hope that resistance is fertile.</p>",

He attended university in the US, but explains that, although he is the son of a teacher, politician and public servant, it was the time spent in Tanzania's rural areas as a child that most influenced his development. \"The most rewarding experience was living with my grandmother. The daily routine was testing \u2013 I'd wake at 5am, walk 8km to school, come home at 3pm and go out to herd goats.\" This gave him, he feels, the \"empathy needed for good decision-making\".</p> <p>It was empathy that turned him into a politician when, in his gap year, he was manager of Mtabila refugee camp, overseeing 120,000 Burundi refugees. \"Witnessing that misery made me political.\" It made him \"philosophical\".

  "<p>If you thought Britain's cyclists did well at the Olympics, with eight golds and 12 medals in all, brace yourself for the home Paralympics. Roared on by a sell-out 6,000 home crowd at the velodrome it is possible the British Paralympians could even exceed their astonishing haul at the 2008 Games, where they pocketed 17 gold medals. The USA, next in the cycling medal table, got four.</p> <p>Comparisons between the two British squads are unfair for two reasons. Firstly, given the various disability classes there are significantly more Paralympic cycling titles on offer, 50 in all in 2012. But more important still, the GB Olympic and Paralympic cyclists are, to a great extent, the same team \u2013 training together with coaches who share offices and expertise. Success for one is success for the other.</p> <p>Chris Furber, head coach for the Paralympic cyclists, says he cannot think of a sport where the Olympic and Paralympic athletes are so integrated: \"We're quite a close-knit unit as coaches and we're always sharing ideas, and challenging each other. That peer review, from a coaching point of view, is very important and one of the reasons why we're so successful.\"</p> <p>Every afternoon at the Manchester velodrome, the base for British Cycling, between 2pm and 5pm is reserved as track time for \"podium-level athletes\", be they Olympians or Paralympians. Furber says: \"So we'll quite often have Sir Chris Hoy and Vicky Pendleton and Jason Kenny training on the same session as, say, my tandem lads or Jodie Cundy or Sarah Storey.\" Often they ride together in the opening motorbike-led warm-up session before breaking for individual drills.</p> <p>To Furber that means the extraordinary British cycling success at the Olympics, especially on the track where they won seven of the 10 titles on offer, is \"a relief\" rather than a burden. He said: \"We know our training is similar to theirs and we know that we're using the same equipment \u2013 we know that their preparation has worked and our preparation is very similar. You almost get this dry run. It was exactly the same in the run-up to Beijing. You see they're doing well and it gives you the confidence that what you're doing is the right thing and when you get there everything will come together. Seeing them do well lifts pressure off us.\"</p> <p>There is, however, a danger to this level of performance, he concedes: \"Sometimes somebody comes away with a silver or bronze and your expectation is so high that it almost disappoints you. But it isn't a disappointing performance. The standard is very, very high across the board now and to get any colour of medal is a fantastic achievement. But the expectation, from the public, I think, is so high.\"</p> <p>A dose of realism is needed in part because other nations are challenging the British riders ever harder, notably those from Australia and China. That said, at the most recent para-cycling track world championships, in Los Angeles in February, Britain still topped the medal table with eight titles.</p> <p>The country is taking a hugely experienced squad to London, including Sarah Storey, who won her first golds as a 14-year-old swimmer in 1992 before switching to cycling in 2008, and another swimmer-turned-cyclist, Jody Cundy, whose Paralympic career began in 1996.</p> <p>Among the newcomers is Jon-Allan Butterworth, a former RAF weapons technician who lost his left arm in a rocket attack in Iraq in 2007. Now a track world champion and world record holder, he exudes confidence: \"There are a number of events where I could potentially win gold. I'm in this position where even if I do a really bad race there's a very good chance I could walk away with a medal. It's not like I'm 10th in the world chasing first, I'm top two in the world.\"</p> <p>Another potential champion is Lora Turnham. The 24-year-old from Liverpool is visually impaired and rides on a tandem with an able-bodied \"pilot\", in her case a constable with Grampian police, Fiona Duncan. Turnham won a world championship medal just six weeks after taking up the sport at Birmingham University. She says she does feel the pressure: \"It's almost like it's expected of us to win medals. That's what we need to go and do. You just set your mentality that way \u2013 at least it gives you that focus.\"</p> <p>Neil Fachie, another newcomer to the tandem track cycling squad, and also a refugee from a different sport \u2013 he competed in the 100m and 200m sprints in Beijing \u2013 is more blunt still: \"There's a certain amount of pressure that comes with the success and the expectations. The level of funding British Cycling gets means we're by far the best-supported team. A lot of the research from the able-bodied team comes to us. So basically, it's gold or nothing. Winning a silver medal at the Paralympics is going to be a great achievement but we're all aiming for gold. The team did so well in Beijing that nothing else will do.\"</p>",

  "<p>With its Elizabethan walls and easy access to fine, white, sandy beaches and magnificent countryside, Berwick-upon-Tweed is much more tourist hotspot than football hotbed.</p> <p>It seemed somewhat extreme when Stranraer banned \"Borderers\" fans from \"sectarian tension-raising\" at Stair Park last season but some Berwick Rangers supporters caused upset by carrying club favours adorned with a St George's Cross or waving union flags.</p> <p>If fans of Glasgow's Rangers are unlikely to object to the latter symbol's presence at Shielfield Park on Sunday many still struggle to comprehend the reality that the first league match their side will play in England is taking place in the Scottish Third Division rather than the Premier League. Neutrals meanwhile may be curious to spot the many Berwick scarves decorated with the crosses of both St Andrew and St George before noting that home loyalists are divided between those who regard themselves as English patriots, Saltire-waving Scots or, simply, hybrid \"Berwickers\".</p> <p>When Ally McCoist's side travel two miles south of the border they will visit the club harbouring possibly Britain's biggest identity crisis. Nearer Edinburgh (57 miles north) than Newcastle (65 miles south) Berwick changed hands five times before England recaptured it from Scotland for a final time in 1482.</p> <p>Geographically, at least, it made more practical sense for the Borderers to join Scotland's football pyramid in 1955 rather than contemplate potential 1,000-mile round trips to Plymouth but, at times, Berwick sit uneasily in their tartan skin. Despite the team being overwhelmingly Scottish \u2013 the majority of Ian Little's semi-professionals are from the Edinburgh area with the only \"outsiders\" in his squad being two Newcastle-born players and a solitary South African, Devon Jacobs \u2013 Berwick are routinely jeered as \"English bastards\" on away trips.</p> <p>Tom Maxwell, an authority on his home-town club and author of <em>The Lone Rangers</em> understands the syndrome. \"It's the feeling of being rejected by both nations that causes the biggest frustration,\" he says.</p> <p>Ironically the home fans among Sunday's 4,140 sell-out at Shielfield \u2013 a ground more used to measuring crowds in hundreds and which is shared with Berwick Bandits speedway club \u2013 have expressed annoyance that Little has recently shifted the Borderers training base and youth development programme to Edinburgh.</p> <p>If that spells limited opportunities for local youngsters while also eroding community links, it makes it easier for players to marry part-time jobs with football and Little remains unapologetic. \"Most of our players are from Edinburgh and the central belt so it makes sense to train up there,\" he says. \"It does away with the travelling.\"</p> <p>One thing everyone agrees on is that this meeting with \"the other Rangers\" ranks as an historic occasion bound to evoke memories of 45 years ago and what surely ranks as the biggest upset in Scottish knockout football.</p> <p>On Saturday 28 January 1967, Berwick's record attendance \u2013 13,365 \u2013 watched Jock Wallace's side beat Rangers 1-0 in the Scottish Cup first round. <em>The Scotsman</em> captured the occasion's significance.</p> <p>\"It was Arnold Palmer missing asix-inch putt,\" reflected the newspaper. \"It was Arkle tripping over a matchstick. It was Walter McGowan knocking down Cassius Clay. It was the most ludicrous, the weirdest, the most astonishing result ever known in Scottish football.\"</p> <p>The late Wallace \u2013 a martinet manager infamous for training sessions in which his charges ran up and down sand dunes and also kept goal \u2013 subsequently took charge of Rangers to the north, leading the Glasgow club to two domestic trebles in three years.</p> <p>Despite retaining a playing registration, the 38-year-old Little shies away from parallels. \"Sunday's a big day for us, for the fans, the club and the town,\" he says.</p> <p>\"I don't think I'll have to gee people up but we are under no illusions as to how difficult it will be. We have to keep the ball and prevent them from dominating possession but Rangers are a big club and, by Third Division standards, they still have some relatively big names.\"</p> <p>Berwick's singular absence of stardust \u2013 although the new midfield signing Damian Gielty is the cousin of Manchester United's Darren Fletcher \u2013 may be acute but at least no one can rival their uniqueness.</p>",
  "<!-- Block 1 --> <p>Scott will be here shortly with the latest team news as it filters through.</p> <!-- Block 2 --> <p><strong>Hello. </strong>Only 38 more weeks to go. Or if you prefer, it's the second week of the new season. All eyes today will be on Old Trafford where Robin van Persie is expected to start against Fulham. The west London club have a horrible record at Man Utd. They have avoided defeat once in the last 49 years. They haven't scored in their last five trips up the M6. They've conceded sixteen in their last six visits. Anything other than a Man Utd victory will be a surprise. A thrashing looks a distinct possibility. For what it's worth, the Cottagers look a decent outside bet to go down. You can't not warm to Martin Jol, though.</p> <p>In the early kick-off Swansea are leading West Ham 2-0. The Swans new Spanish midfielder Miguel Michu is again among the goals. A super early-quite-probably-jumping-the-gun-because-what-will-he-be-like-on-a-rainy-night-at-Wigan contender for bargain of the season, as the cliche-mongers would have it. </p> <p>You can follow the second half with Scott Murray <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/aug/25/swansea-city-west-ham-live-mbm-report\">here</a>.</p> <!-- Block 3 --> <p><strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/aug/25/premierleague-sunderland\">SUNDERLAND v READING - MATCH POSTPONED</a></strong></p> <p>There's a very strong fixture list today, but Sunderland v Reading is no longer one of them.

  "<p>The last time Norwich City were managed by someone other than Paul Lambert at Carrow Road they were in League One and they lost 7-1 to Colchester United, so this was an improvement of sorts. However Chris Hughton's wait for a first win since replacing Lambert as Norwich's manager this summer goes on after a frustrating draw with an expensively assembled but distinctly underwhelming Queens Park Rangers&#xa0;side.</p> <p>Both sides were hammered 5-0 on the opening weekend but, while Norwich could perhaps be excused a few teething problems at Fulham, QPR's home thrashing at the hands of Swansea City, Rangers having spent extensively if questionably during the summer, was harder to explain. There is a sizeable hunger for success at Loftus Road but for the time being they are feeding on scraps. \"That's the first away point I've been able to accrue since joining QPR [in January], so that's a bonus,\" said Mark Hughes a tad&#xa0;unconvincingly.</p> <p>The origins of those 5-0 defeats were not difficult to spot. In F\u00e1bio da Silva, QPR had a player who started at right-back for Manchester United against Barcelona in the Champions League final last year, yet Anthony Pilkington often made him look more suited to the Championship.</p> <p>Pilkington did not take long to make an impact and, when he was found in acres of space by Robert Snodgrass after 11 minutes, his lovely cross was headed in from close range by Simeon Jackson. A simple goal, but one that was beautiful in its efficiency.</p> <p>QPR were all over the place and with their midfield offering little protection, their defence was as exposed as a prince in Las Vegas. Clint Hill, fortunate to escape a second yellow card after losing his wrestling match with Grant Holt, had to be removed for his own sake at the break.</p> <p>They might have been more solid if a deal to sign Michael Dawson from Spurs had not stalled on Friday. There is also talk of Real Madrid's Ricardo Carvalho and the Internazionale goalkeeper J\u00falio C\u00e9sar coming in and Hughes suggested he is working on several other targets.</p> <p>However, if QPR could not rely on their defence to keep them in the game, they could at least count on Norwich's to offer them a route back into it.</p> <p>Eight minutes after Jackson's opener, Junior Hoilett slid a pass into the Norwich area towards Djibril Ciss\u00e9, who was clumsily brought down by the debutant S\u00e9bastien Bassong. QPR's appeal was not loud; Norwich's protests were. \"Soft\" was Hughton's verdict on Mark Clattenburg's decision to award a penalty. Naturally Hughes saw contact.</p> <p>Hughton's irritation was extended by Clattenburg's failure to spot Bobby Zamora encroaching when Ciss\u00e9's penalty was brilliantly tipped on to the left post by John Ruddy. A head start gained on the Norwich defence, Zamora swept the rebound home.</p> <p>\"When the penalty is taken Bobby Zamora is three yards in the box and he's on the referee's side,\" Hughton said. \"That makes it difficult to take.\" Although given that Ciss\u00e9 missed the penalty, QPR would not have been too disappointed to be given another chance.</p> <p>The equaliser did not lead to an improvement in QPR's performance. Instead Norwich reacted strongly and Robert Green had to be alert to push a Snodgrass shot from 25 yards over the bar.</p> <p>There would have been nothing Green could have done, though, if Snodgrass had put his powerful header from Jonny Howson's delightful cross an inch lower with 20 minutes remaining. Green was similarly helpless 13 minutes later when Russell Martin's looping header clanged against the bar as Norwich turned the screw. It was that sort of afternoon for Norwich.</p> <p>\"I'm really disappointed,\" Hughton said. \"We played really well. We should have won. We had the better chances and we threatened more. It was a disappointment after scoring so early. We need to be more clinical.\"</p> <p>QPR need more than that. They need to be a team, not a collection of individuals. \"It's a start,\" Hughes said. \"We had a poor weekend last weekend and it was important we got something out of this game.</p> <p>\"At the end of the game, they were asking questions and throwing balls into our box which we had to deal with and that's what we were able to do. All in all, in terms of the performance we can get the ball down and play a little bit more. In terms of a result and where we are, we'll take it.\"</p> <p>QPR remain a work in progress. Simply throwing money at the problem may not be the answer.</p>",
  "<p>Doctor Who showrunner Steven Moffat has said the show has the capacity to be a moneyspinner for the BBC for generations to come.</p> <p>Moffat, the BBC1 show's executive producer and head writer, said the new series which returns on Saturday 3 September with Asylum of the Daleks, would be a season of \"blockbuster\" episodes.</p> <p>Asked about his budget for the Saturday teatime show, Moffat said: \"I\"m never going to say I've got enough. That's like asking would you like to be more happy, of course I'm going to say yes I want more money.</p> <p>\"They don't starve us, Doctor Who is incredibly well looked after by the BBC. I truly believe it could be a show that outlives everybody in this room, it doesn't just make money now it could make money forever,\" Moffat told the MediaGuardian Edinburgh International Television Festival on Saturday morning.</p> <p>He said the new series would be a \"blockbuster every single week, let's not have a cheap episode, let's make them all huge\".</p> <p>\"Last year we did an arc [storyline] next year we will do something else, every year we have to go in a particular direction. It shouldn't feel like good old cosy Doctor Who.\"</p> <p>On the long-mooted possibility of a film version of Doctor Who, Moffat said: \"There's often been talk about a movie, I'm sure we should do one. What I keep saying is it can't ever be allowed to interfere with the television show, that's the mothership, that's the thing that will go on forever.</p> <p>Moffat said changing viewing habits meant \"about half or just under\" watch Doctor Who when it first screens on BBC1. \"We no longer watch TV when schedulers tell us we should and that's right,\" he said. \"Your bookcase doesn't tell you when to read a book.\"</p> <p>Asked about his choice of writers on the show, Moffat said: \"If it's your first television show you have written you are going to screw up royally, I tend to favour highly experienced television writers for the sake of my sanity. We do go outside of the circle \u2026 it's a tough old job. No brand new TV writer should be tackling this one. It's hard.\"</p> <p>Moffat said he wanted to make the Daleks scary again in the new run. \"Kids are supposedly frightened of Daleks but they take them to bed. Is there a way we can make them scarier, get them back to being more monstery?</p> <p>\"I hope they will leave them outside their bedroom doors, was my response to that. There is a tremendous temptation to go kitch and sweet with the daleks. You shouldn't. They are insane tanks.\"</p> <p>Moffat asked the audience for a show of hands whether they would continue watching the show with a female Doctor, but appeared unconvinced by the prospect.</p> <p>\"It is a part of Time Lord lore, it can happen. I don't know, who knows? The more often it's talked about, the more likely it's going to happen.\"</p> <p>One audience member said he could \"take it for a couple of episodes\". Moffat joked: \"That wouldn't be very nice on the young lady involved.\"</p> <p><em>\u2022&#xa0;To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.

  "<p>On a jetty alongside the town beach a loud phone call disturbs the peace of a handful of Spetses residents lying in the sun before taking their daily swim \u2013 one free pleasure that is still available to all. A rich weekender from Athens booms ostentatiously into his mobile, directing a man behind the wheel of a sizeable speedboat. \"Just ignore the line of buoys,\" he says, \"and steer straight over to me so we can talk.\" The instruction provokes a furious reaction from locals, who yell out angrily that boats are never allowed to come so close to the swimmers. A nasty row flares up \u2013 a sign of growing social tensions on an island where poor locals live cheek-by-jowl with the holidaymaking rich.</p> <p>Antonis Samaras, the Greek prime minister, spent last week <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2012/aug/24/angela-merkel-rejects-greek-pleas-loan-extension\" title=\"\">pleading with European leaders for more time</a> to implement the severe austerity programme that is, ultimately, the condition for Greece remaining in the euro. Back home, and on islands such as Spetses, those well-off Greeks who remain financially cushioned from the effects of the deepening crisis, and from the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2012/aug/22/eurozone-crisis-greek-leniency-austerity\" title=\"\">fresh austerity measures</a> due to be imposed next month, are the targets of growing fury.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395223124\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/26/1345941828005/Location-of-Spetses-in-Gr-001.jpg\" alt=\"Location of Spetses in Greece\" width=\"220\" height=\"226\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Location of Spetses in Greece. Credit: Observer graphics</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Observer graphics</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Saronic isle, with its pretty horse buggies and flowery villas, has been chosen as the location for a new Greek tourism advert, designed to reassure international visitors that the beaches and the bobbing fishing boats are still waiting for them, despite the economic meltdown. Yet the place is also a microcosm of the country's troubles: 10 square miles that encompass unimaginably big gaps in income.</p> <p>While Athenians can enjoy browsing in the expensive deli that has replaced the <em>souvlaki</em> outlet in the square, the majority of Spetsiots can no longer afford to eat in local restaurants. The price of food in supermarkets and shops has soared.</p> <p>\"It is a theatre now,\" says Kostas, who is stockpiling food against a coming national emergency and has hunting guns positioned around his home. But as the son of an old Spetses family, he knows that appearances must be kept up to attract wealthy guests, no matter how difficult life becomes for residents. Leisure and pleasure are Spetses' only lifeline in the crisis, but might also put islanders in peril. Kostas is aware that communities on the mainland are envious of the apparently lavish lifestyle on the isle. There are fears that if the Greek economy really does melt down, Spetses could be targeted as a symbol of the feckless rich even as most of its year-round inhabitants struggle to get by.</p> <p>The glitzy reputation is not new. By custom elderly women, wrapped in black scarves and long dresses, would gather in the afternoon to share slices of watermelon as they sat in the shade. A scene from old Greece, sure enough, but this was never really a rustic island \u2013 not the kind with donkeys and quiet tavernas with broken chairs. Proximity to Athens ensured that it became a tycoons' playground as soon as international shipping began to make billionaires in the 1950s.</p> <p>And so it has continued. In 1962 Stavros Niarchos, second only to Aristotle Onassis in the magnate stakes, bought the tiny neighbouring private island of Spetsopoula where Charles and Diana later spent part of their honeymoon; and in the early 1980s when Duran Duran's Simon Le Bon wanted to celebrate a birthday, he did so under the flashing lights of a disco in Spetses' glamorous Old Harbour.</p> <p>Even as Greece staggers towards a possible exit from the euro, the glamorous facade is intact. Far from looking down-at-heel, or being daubed with angry graffiti, Spetses has never looked more affluent. The failed economy is the fearful topic of conversation everywhere, but the place is gleaming. Smart decking has replaced crumbling concrete around the cobbled maritime mosaics of the Dapia, the island's neat port, and alongside a new crop of sophisticated bars and clothes shops, two sparkling rival frozen yoghurt parlours vie for trade with an equally clinical-looking ice cream cafe.</p> <p>The imposing Edwardian Poseidonian Grand Hotel \u2013 so disliked by John Fowles when he set his 1966 novel <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/booksblog/2011/jul/31/summer-readings-the-magus-john-fowles\" title=\"\"><em>The Magus </em></a>here \u2013 is more stately than ever. But its linen-covered terrace tables are reserved for the owners of a succession of vast, state-of-the-art yachts moored at the marina on the promenade.</p> <p>Perhaps most tellingly of all, no restaurant here, no matter how traditional, seems to serve retsina, the national wine. \"Tastes have changed,\" say the waiters. Moneyed Athenians have largely switched to the European-style Greek wines that have started winning admirers.</p> <p>This opulence, tailored for the few, explains why little Spetses has come to be known as the Monaco of Greece. It is somewhere, along with a few other smart islands such as the neighbouring Hydra, where those Greeks who still have lots of money can spend it in splendid seclusion.</p> <p>There are no private cars on the island and so the locals travel on mopeds or quadbikes. Visitors, on the other hand, take horse buggies, traditional wooden fishing boats, or water taxis that charge \u20ac18 to cross the bay to the Old Harbour, while those who are really flush can be heard landing on the island's private helipads.</p> <p>Middle-class European tourists tend to come to the wider Saronic Gulf for its safe sailing. Although the sea can be affected by the unpredictable <em>meltemi</em> wind, it is a haven for amateurs in search of day trips and weekend excursions. Trade is just about surviving, says Melody McKay Burton, who runs the Aegean Sailing School from nearby Aegina. People are booking much later, but still booking. Her work, she adds, brings her in touch with all nationalities and so has emphasised Greece's key position at the meeting point of the Middle East and Europe. \"We have had Palestinians and Israelis, Greeks and Turks, all on the same skippered boat before, and they all seem to get on and to be interested in each other.\" Russians also now regularly hire out her yachts for lavish weekend parties.</p> <p>Back in the 1980s and 1990s the island of Spetses flirted with cheap package tours, but British firms pulled out in the recession, leaving in their wake an adventurous group of British women who had fallen in love with the island, and with some of its men, and stayed to raise families. Fortunes have ebbed and flowed since then, as mass tourism beat a slow retreat from Spetses' beaches. But behind the picture-postcard facade, the times have never been worse than now.</p> <p>The island, once described by Fowles as \"a place so beautiful, quiet and empty that it verged on the terrifying\" is full of worried people. Memories of the atrocities inflicted on Greeks by Greeks at the end of the second world war, and recounted in <em>The Magus</em>, are still vivid for many. They may have been distorted in the retelling, but they remain powerful enough to create fear and suspicion. After all, people were lynched on the Dapia and shot outside the Poseidonian.</p> <p>An old sense of vulnerability is returning to Spetses, behind the beach parasols and designer sunglasses.</p> <p>The words on the island's flag, which dates back nearly 200 years to the Greek war of independence, are \"Freedom or Death\". They no longer seem such a quaint remnant from a swashbuckling past.</p> <p>\u2022 This article has been amended to correct the size of Spetses</p>",
  "<p>On China's <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qixi_Festival\" title=\"\">Valentine's Day</a> (the seventh day of the seventh lunar month in the Chinese calendar, which fell on 23 August this year), 30 migrant workers were taken by surprise when they were invited to a business networking dinner by several college students in Shanghai who, during their summer internships, had happened to see the migrants' miserable working life on the city's construction sites. The move by the students, who wore T-shirts saying \"Invite a Migrant Worker to a Meal\" was televised as a primetime entertainment..</p> <p>This says much about the social attitudes towards migrant workers, who often come from the vast interior of the country. They make up half of China's urban workforce and account for half of the country's GDP. They are indispensable, and yet are the most socially marginalised group of workers in China.</p> <p>Yet rural migrants continue to suffer from deep-seated prejudice and discrimination. Not only are they denied access to public services in the cities due to the <em>hukou </em>(household registration) system, they are also subjected to day-to-day exclusion and abuse. You see them being talked to and shouted at like children in public places; you see them banned from hotel lobbies and posh restaurants. And as an angry blogger pointed out when observing open discrimination against rural migrants, he said that the \"No Dogs or Chinese\" signs put up by western colonialists in the 1920s and 1930s have been replaced by the \"No Dogs or Peasants\" signs at shopping malls in the cities. How have these become acceptable?</p> <p>Since Deng Xiaoping's reform and opening-up (<em>gaige kaifang</em>) era, the media has led the way in manufacturing images about rural migrants and reinforcing prejudice against them. The word \"peasant\" (<em>nongmin</em>) has always had negative connotations, either implying ignorance and lack of education or carrying a patronising tone, addressing passive masses receiving benevolence from the rulers. Since the 1980s and 1990s, the media began to widely use to the term \"blind flow\" (<em>mangliu</em>) to describe rural-to-urban migration, portraying an irrational, senseless and out-of-control migration of labour into the cities. This negative language has long shaped public views and sentiments towards rural migrants and further deepened the prejudice against them.</p> <p>Nongmin is a permanent social status that entails someone's inferior educational and cultural background as well as economic capabilities. As a segregated social class, nongmin carry the subordinated status with them wherever they migrate. I had a Chinese publisher questioning me about the dialogue I wrote for a rural migrant when he discussed politics. She said: \"How can a peasant speak like that? They aren't intelligent enough to analyse things that way.\" I also had a Chinese reporter saying to me: \"Don't trust what the peasants tell you; they would mislead you.\" Neither of them has had any experience working with anyone in the rural communities.</p> <p>This raises the question about the media's distance and lack of knowledge of the \"rural\" of which social imagery they have been shaping. Interestingly, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/owen-jones\" title=\"\">Owen Jones</a>, in his Chavs: The Demonisation of the Working Class, talked about a similar process where the media lacks contact with and knowledge of the class they are belittling. The media take on the role of demonising the working class, Jones says, and providing moral justification for the state to deny that class of entitlements.</p> <p>Similarly, the Chinese media manufacture \"inherent\" moral deficiency and characteristics of the nongmin in order to justify their lack of rights and entitlements. Thus the idea that nongmin are inherently much less intelligent and unable to make sense of their own reality; thus the idea that nongmin are \"a blind flow of labour crowding into the cities\" and they \"create social and economic problems\" for the urbanite. It is the equivalent of the Daily Mail in the UK \u2013 Jones quotes the Mail's remarks on the \"council-estate working class\": \"These are the people who are getting sentimental about a vicious killer; they have no values, no morality and are so thick that they are beyond redemption.\"</p> <p>And then see Chinese bloggers condemning migrant workers in Yunnan who held a protest with their children holding placards \"Hand over my parents' sweat and blood money!\" in order to claim back owed wages. One blogger sneered: \"What kind of parent would let their kids beg money for them?\"</p> <p>As China's rural migrants have had this class distinction stamped on them permanently, the only way their demands for social justice and equal rights can be justified is through the promotion of national economic interests and the greater good. One way to advance the rural migrants' case for better access to public services in the cities is to argue that they could power consumer spending growth in China. As China Daily <a href=\"http://europe.chinadaily.com.cn/business/2012-08/21/content_15693053.htm\" title=\"\">reports</a> this week, \"The 230 million-strong migrant workforce drives China's economy, but a lack of access to education, health and other services \u2026 forces massive saving, restraining Beijing's efforts to shift growth's focus to consumption from investment.\" No media are able to talk about migrant workers' basic rights.</p> <p>Social attitudes will take a long time to change in China, and the media is guilty of delaying that change. Rural migrants need to be treated as citizens, like everyone else, not as passive nongmin to be receiving occasional goodwill and charity. Much more needs to be done than taking migrants to a Chinese Valentine's dinner.</p>"
