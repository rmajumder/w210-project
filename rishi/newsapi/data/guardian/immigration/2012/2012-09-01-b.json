  "<p>An inquiry into a police shooting in which a man was shot at close range six times in a London street will this week see British intelligence officials questioned in public for the first time.</p> <p>Azelle Rodney, 24, was shot by an officer \u2013 identified in preceedings only as E7 \u2013 as he sat in the rear of a Volkswagen Golf in Edgware, north London in 2005. A public inquiry will open on Monday to establish the circumstances that led to his death and address questions from his mother, Susan Alexander, who says she still does not know why the officer considered her son such a risk as to shoot him dead.</p> <p>It is expected to lead to recommendations that could determine the future of police operations that are based on long-term surveillance and the use of intelligence resources.</p> <p>The police shooting of another man, Mark Duggan, 29, in north London triggered last year's riots. Inquest, a campaigning charity, also draws parallels to the death of Jean Charles de Menezes, 27, who was shot dead by police at Stockwell tube station in July 2005, also as the result of a pre\u2011planned police operation. The Rodney inquiry, expected to last eight weeks, will this week see two intelligence officers from HM Revenue and Customs and three from Scotland Yard cross-examined over the information that led to the car being intercepted by firearms officers. It is understood the customs intelligence officers were monitoring a gang importing cocaine when they picked up information about a planned armed robbery, which they passed to intelligence officials at Scotland Yard.</p> <p>The officers have agreed to be questioned in public on the quality of the intelligence, its content and reliability, and how it led to the operation. The only restriction is that they must not reveal how it was obtained. They will speak to the court behind a screen to protect their anonymity.</p> <p>Intelligence desk operatives rather than intelligence officers usually appear in court, and almost always in closed court \u2013 as is the case with the Special Immigration Appeals Commission (Siac), the most secret court within English law, which has the power to detain foreign terrorism suspects without trial. Siac's hearings and rulings are never fully revealed to the public because they involve testimony from members of the secret security services. The counsel to the inquiry, Ashley Underwood QC who has considerable experience of Siac hearings, told the <em>Observer</em>: \"This is the first time actual intelligence officers will appear in court.</p> <p>\"Normally you have second-hand evidence from a desk operative; here, the officers will be appearing in person to be cross-examined, the raw intelligence itself will be open to scrutiny.\" The officer fired eight shots of which a number struck Rodney in the head. Guns were subsequently found in the car and the two men in the front, Wesley Lovell and Frank Graham, were jailed in 2006 for possession of firearms and ammunition.</p> <p>Previous inquiries into the shooting include one by the Independent Police Complaints Commission, which found no evidence of misconduct and by the Crown Prosecution Service, which concluded that there was \"insufficient evidence\" to offer a realistic prospect of convicting any officer.</p>",
  "<p>Glencore boss Ivan Glasenberg is supposedly one of the world's shrewdest traders, so he'll be acutely aware of the choice facing him this week: either he performs a humiliating volte-face by increasing his bid for the mining group Xstrata, or he must risk never having complete control of an asset so coveted that he was prepared to put his notoriously secretive company through the irritation of a public listing to get it.</p> <p>We will know which trade-off he's plumped for by Friday, when Xstrata shareholders are due to vote on Glencore's plan to combine the pair into a \u00a353bn natural resources giant \u2013 although the latest opinion polls suggest the scheme is set for a comprehensive defeat.</p> <p>Still, there remains a chance that Glasenberg will sacrifice his reputation to land the prize (and save Xstrata's obedient board from the vengeance of their own shareholders). But should Glasenberg be considering a late increase to his bid, then he needs to be reminded of the perils of dawdling.</p> <p>As a young man, the commodity trader almost competed as a speed-walker in the 1984 Olympics. Apartheid meant that his native South Africa was barred from the games but, with his Jewish ancestry, he sought to go as an Israeli. Sadly, Glasenberg failed to complete his paperwork in time.</p> <h2>Rising quiche but falling sales at Morrisons</h2> <p>In one of his adverts for the supermarket chain Morrisons, England cricket hero Andrew \"Freddie\" Flintoff takes a bunch of young children on a shopping trip for a party. As they fill up the trolley with hearty favourites such as joints of British beef, hot cross buns and cupcakes, Freddie suddenly stops his group on the way to the checkout and asks: \"Did you get the quiche?\"</p> <p>It is hardly the worst gag you'll be subjected to in a supermarket commercial (that remains the most fiercely competitive field in the industry) but the supposed joke of a lad from Preston fancying such fare now seems to be on the retailer.</p> <p>The company unveils its interim results this week with City analysts expecting dire numbers, including falling like-for-like sales.</p> <p>Among the criticisms are the usual concerns about the chain's lack of online shopping and convenience stores, as well as the Bradford-based grocer suddenly appearing to have abandoned its core customer by trying to become too posh. Veg counters spewing out dry ice seem the most obvious irritant \u2013 meaning (to butcher another of the group's old ads) there are fewer reasons to shop at Morrisons.</p> <h2>How long have we got to save the euro now?</h2> <p>In January 2011, Hungary's prime minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n reckoned there was six months to \"save the euro\". By June, the schedule still held, as a meeting between Germany's chancellor Angela Merkel and France's then president, Nicolas Sarkozy, prompted headlines hinting there was just \"45 minutes\" to do the same. So we should perhaps be mildly sceptical in 2012 about suggestions that European Central Bank president Mario Draghi now has two weeks to try again.</p> <p>Still, having promised to do \"whatever it takes\" to save the currency in July, Draghi now faces an important fortnight in which he needs to justify bondholders' recent optimism that he's managed to unearth a plausible euro solution while on his summer holidays. The next two weeks potentially will see fresh ECB bond-buying measures, a Spanish plea for aid, plus clues about whether the market will raise its boot from Greece's throat and ease the terms of its bailout. Meanwhile, German judges and Dutch voters will also get a say on the currency's future (or otherwise).</p> <p>Amid all that, Draghi convenes the ECB's governing council on Thursday, with analysts daring to dream he'll utter the magic word \"unlimited\". That's as in ECB intervention, not supposed deadlines.</p> <h2>Making a marque</h2> <p>They used to say that Range Rovers had heated rear windscreens to keep their owners' hands warm as they pushed them home, but the marque's reputation has been transformed since then.</p> <p>Nowadays Jaguar Land Rover, which makes the beasts, is lauded as that highly unusual case of a British manufacturing success story (albeit one that, rather less unusually, is foreign owned).</p> <p>The company has recently hired an extra 1,000 workers at its Halewood plant in Merseyside to launch a three-shift, 24-hour operation - as the carmaker attempts to satisfy demand for its new Range Rover Evoque, which is very popular despite a tie-up with Victoria Beckham.</p> <p>This week will also see the manufacturer unveil its latest line, \"the all new Range Rover\", a model made in Solihull and which the company boasts \"has delivered significant enhancements in performance and agility\". That's more than can be said for British manufacturing, as yet another depressing purchasing managers' index is expected to show tomorrow.</p>",
  "<p>On Thursday, MPs Frank Field and Nicholas Soames will lead a parliamentary debate, prompted by an e-petition sponsored by the pressure group <a href=\"http://www.migrationwatchuk.org/\" title=\"\">Migration Watch</a>. It expresses deep concern that, despite very strong public opposition to \"mass immigration\", the population of the UK is expected to reach 70 million within 20 years, two-thirds of the increase due to migration. Undoubtedly, Thursday's \"No to 70 million\" debate will be marked by some clarity but also a great deal of confusion, contradiction and the employment of similar sets of statistics robustly interpreted to serve opposing sides of the argument.</p> <p>Immigration is an issue steeped in prejudice, traditionally too easily exploited by groups on both the right and left. At times, the toxic results have had a horrible impact on the lives of those who, over the decades, have otherwise successfully made the UK their home.</p> <p>A discussion is much needed on the many issues that arise from immigration. Its economic and cultural impact; its effect on the rationing of resources such as health and housing; and its impact on population, in particular on the level at which we feel the UK is deemed \"overcrowded\", given its requirement for a youthful influx to provide for an ageing society.</p> <p>However, that discussion is again and again sabotaged because immigration provides politicians with levers that are at times too carelessly pulled, particularly in the pre-party conference season. The result is often highly negative. The events at <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/aug/31/london-metropolitan-universities-educate-police?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">London Metropolitan University</a> over the past few days are a case in point.</p> <p>The university's right to take students from outside the EU has been revoked. In spite of a warning six months ago that its procedures had to be improved \u2013 for instance, on students' attendance, and on policing the requirement to speak adequate English \u2013 the UK Border Agency says a recent inspection showed continuing and systematic failures. Now, almost 3,000 students face deportation if they cannot find fresh support to continue their studies. Nigerian Francis Owobiyi is among them, well advanced in his dissertation for a masters degree in international law. \"I could have gone to the US, to Canada, but I chose London, I regret that now,\" he said on Thursday.</p> <p>Malcolm Gillies, LMU vice-chancellor, does not impress with his assertions that change was underway. However, this cruel detonation of the academic lives of hundreds of legitimate, hard-working students is quite unjustified. Higher education is one of Britain's largest and most rapidly growing sources of international revenue. In 2011-12, foreign students accounted for \u00a32.7bn of universities' \u00a323bn income. Now we have a large \"Not Welcome\" sign nailed to the UK's front door.</p> <p>In July, in a House of Lords debate, the Border Agency was lambasted for its many failings. The peers listed its \"disgraceful\" short-term holding facilities for children at Heathrow and the detention for years of migrants, including torture victims. However, in the case of London Metropolitan, it's not the Border Agency that is primarily to blame. The fault lies with the government.</p> <p>On Thursday, the Office for National Statistics announced that migration had fallen last year by almost 36,000 to 216,000, as the government tightened rules. However, margins of error mean very little change may have happened. This is in spite of the 2010 Conservative manifesto that promised to cut net migration from \"hundreds of thousands to tens of thousands\" by 2015.</p> <p>The challenge is that Britain's doors are legitimately open to 270m working-age citizens from the EU. In 2011, 589,000 people arrived in Britain. At the same time, fewer British were leaving to live abroad. So, the effort to reduce the numbers of workers from outside the EU, migrants claiming a place for family reasons and foreign students has become all the more urgent. But restrictions come at a price.</p> <p>The Institute for Public Policy Research says cutting foreign students by 50,000 annually could cost the economy \u00a32bn-\u00a33bn a year. Combine the loss from a reduction in foreign students with the cap on highly skilled workers, much needed by British business and industry, and, according to the National Institute of Economic and Social Research, the amount lost to the economy could reach \u00a34bn a year. However, there are other than purely economic calculations that need to be made.</p> <p>In July, Ed Miliband, the son of a refugee, apologised on behalf of his party for allowing net immigration to reach 3.2m under Labour without sufficiently addressing people's concerns about its impact on housing, schools, jobs and benefit entitlements and the pace of change in some communities. A person does not turn into a bigot for raising such matters, he affirmed. So, as a sense of cultural identity, shared values and a common notion of citizenship must also play a significant part in the equation, how is immigration best controlled and what size of population can Britain carry and prosper?</p> <p>Any reasonable response requires that we understand better the benefits and true costs of immigration and that means more credible research. A lack of trust in the government's effectiveness in controlling immigration and manning its borders also needs addressing. A decision on population growth \u2013 70m, 80m, 100m? \u2013 demands that priorities are agreed. As Oxford University's excellent Migration Observatory argues, a population policy designed to benefit the environment, for example, may be very different from one maximising economic growth.</p> <p>Sweden has opened its doors wide to immigrants but worked with trade unions to ensure that paying a pittance for an hour's labour is severely restrained: fairness is key. Fairness is needed here, too, for instance in the allocation of social housing, but also in helping integration by restoring access to free English courses, ravaged by cuts.</p> <p>At the very least, too, the government needs to exempt non-EU students from the visa cap and desist from ramping up the rhetoric. Immigration is a complex and ultimately visceral issue. Nevertheless, in the aftermath of the Olympics, Sunder Katwala from the think tank British Future reminded us that many of Britain's medal winners were third-generation immigrants.</p> <p>\"Beneath the sound and the fury is a lot of consensus on immigration policy,\" he says. \"We are better at integration than we think.\"</p> <p>We should remember those words when we resume our frequently anxious debate about immigration.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 3 September 2012. The original referred to the think tank Future Britain rather than British Future. This has been corrected.</p>",
  "<p>It has netted numerous awards and nearly 3 million viewers tuned in to the first episode of series five when it aired in the US in July, but until yesterday, box sets or piracy were your only options if you live in the UK and wanted to keep up with this underviewed gem of a show. Series four is now available on streaming service Netflix, bypassing traditional broadcasting entirely. This may be no bad thing. The first series was aired on FX, where it managed consolidated ratings of a mere 120,000 viewers, and was dropped. Series two was aired in a dead-of-night time-slot on 5USA over Christmas in 2009, and with no warning \u2013 they could not have buried it in a deeper hole. Series three and four have never been shown by a UK broadcaster. Here's why this is wrong.</p> <p><strong>ORIGINALITY</strong></p> <p>OK, a show in which the hero learns in the first episode that he has terminal lung cancer and becomes a crystal meth \"cook\" in an effort to leave a nest egg for his family, and which features energetic attempts to dissolve a body in a bath of acid in episode two, should probably be filed under \"not for all the family\". But at a time when antiheroes are 10 a penny, it certainly ups the ante. You have to marvel that it was ever made.</p> <p><strong>PERFORMANCES</strong></p> <p>Bryan Cranston plays Walt, the defeated chemistry teacher who finds a new life in his death sentence, and he does it with extraordinary subtlety. Walt's desperation keeps us rooting for him long after we've ceased to see him as a sympathetic character. Aaron Paul is terrific as luckless addict Jesse Pinkman, a dropout with few morals and even less intelligence. How he somehow becomes the conscience of the show is a revelation.</p> <p><strong>EXECUTION </strong></p> <p>The show is so perfectly conceived that you never see things coming, but they make perfect sense. Nobody acts out of character, despite ending up so far from where they started, and no show \u2013 not even <em>The Shield</em> \u2013 mastered the art of the cliff-hanger quite so well, which makes it perfect for binge-viewing on Netflix.</p> <p><strong>HUMOUR</strong></p> <p><em>Breaking Bad</em> is the perfect vehicle for pitch-black humour, whether it's irrepressible low-rent lawyer Saul Goodman (Bob Odenkirk) , who drives a white Cadillac with a licence plate that reads \"LWYR UP\" or the \"Odd Couple\" dynamic between Walt and his former student Jesse.</p> <p><strong>CINEMATOGRAPHY</strong></p> <p>Shot on 35mm film, each scene is artfully framed and beautifully lit. Stunning scenes of the vast deserts of New Mexico are set alongside drab fast-food restaurants, building a disquieting mood of suspense reminiscent of a Coen brothers thriller. It simply doesn't look like anything else on TV.</p>",
  "<h2>Sarah Greenwood, production designer</h2> <p>It may have been an ingenious creative and financial solution, but Joe Wright's big idea on <em>Anna Karenina</em> \u2013 to stage most of the film inside a Russian theatre \u2013 posed a herculean challenge for his long-time production designer. Rather than shooting the film on location in Russia and England as planned, \"We had to reconceive the whole thing and build this theatre from scratch in Shepperton with just 12 weeks to go till shooting and no extra budget.\"</p> <p>Luckily, this was not Sarah Greenwood's first collaboration with Wright. She had worked with him right at the start of his career, on his 2000 TV debut <em>Nature Boy</em>, and on his subsequent feature films (receiving Oscar nominations for her work on <em>Pride &amp; Prejudice</em> and <em>Atonement</em>), so she trusted his judgment and he trusted that she could pull it off.</p> <p>\"Framing it in this derelict theatre was a fantastic concept, given the theatricality of high society in St Petersburg and Moscow at the time,\" she says. It also allowed them to move between scenes \u2013 from restaurants to ice-rinks to racecourses \u2013 with dizzying fluidity: rarely has a production designer's work been so foregrounded in a film.</p> <p>Only Levin's story brought them outside the theatrical frame and into the \"real\" world, which meant shooting some wintry scenes on location in Russia. The famous scything scenes were filmed on Salisbury Plain, \"the closest we could get to massive open Russian plains here in the UK \u2013 Salisbury hasn't really been touched in 200 years because of the army base\".</p> <p>Was all the mayhem and hard graft worthwhile for Greenwood? \"With hindsight, it would've been dull had we just done a period drama,\" she says. \"This was much more exciting.\"</p> <h2>Jacqueline Durran, costume designer<br></h2> <p>Like many of the crew members on <em>Anna Karenina</em>, Jacqueline Durran has worked with Joe Wright several times in the past and with considerable success \u2013 she was Oscar-nominated for her costume design on <em>Pride and Prejudice</em> and <em>Atonement</em>. The closeness of Wright's team is liberating, she says, because people aren't afraid to speak their minds; it also helps that Wright is more fashion-conscious than most directors. \"His interest in costume comes from puppets \u2013 his parents had the Puppet Theatre at the Angel Theatre \u2013 so he has always been aware of the possibilities of costumes and how costumes move.\"</p> <p>For <em>Anna Karenina</em>, Wright wanted Durran to concentrate on silhouette rather than surface detail. \"He didn't want to end up with naturalistic 1870s costumes or to get constricted by the period. As the Russian aristocrats were obsessed with French culture in the 19th century, we came up with the idea of tweaking it a bit and using the heyday of couture from the 1950s to emphasise Anna's modern streak. That really helped Keira understand Anna.\"</p> <p>Historians and costume purists may quibble with the odd anachronism or cultural mash-up, but Durran is unapologetic: the film's theatrical framework meant that historical accuracy was low on their list of priorities. In the case of Levin and his peasants: \"We might have muddled up the regions, north and south,\" she says cheerfully. \"No money was spent on a Russian expert.\"</p> <p>Instead, she threw her energies into realising Wright's ultra-specific vision. \"Vronsky's uniform had to be absolutely white \u2013 but hardly any wool is made white; it's made cream or grey. That proved to be an absolute nightmare. But we got there in the end.\"</p> <h2>Seamus McGarvey, cinematographer<br></h2> <p>When Seamus McGarvey photographed <em>Atonement</em> for Joe Wright in 2006, they devised a moment at the centre of the film that became one of its major talking points: an extraordinary five-minute tracking shot through a military camp on the beach at Dunkirk that captures in sweeps and pirouettes the surreal horrors of war. There may be no single moment in <em>Anna Karenina</em> that compares to that shot for virtuosity; rather, the whole film is a virtuoso act by the acclaimed Northern Irish cinematographer, whose recent credits include <em>We Need to Talk About Kevin</em> and <em>Avengers Assemble</em>.</p> <p>McGarvey joined the film just before shooting began and had little time to get to grips with its unorthodox theatre setting and the fact that certain scenes were designed to change right before our eyes, without the camera cutting away, like a stage set being rearranged in the middle of a performance.</p> <p>\"One sequence goes from Oblonsky's office at closing time and takes you through the streets of St Petersburg, where you see Levin looking for a restaurant, and suddenly the camera swirls around into the restaurant and the scene begins \u2013 all in one shot, without leaving the room.\"</p> <p>It's rare that a cinematographer on a big digital-age production is asked to create effects in-camera rather than relying on computers to fill in the blanks in post-production, but on this movie McGarvey used mirrors, Georges M\u00e9li\u00e8s-style, to realise Anna's premonitions, and filmed with a stocking over the lens to imbue certain scenes with a particular glow.</p> <p>\"I relished it,\" he says. \"Working with Joe, you're always presented with difficult challenges; he really pushes every department to do their very best. He won't settle for average. The best work I've done has been on Joe's films as a result.\"</p>",
  "<p><strong>Heron Tower, 110 Bishopsgate, London EC2 (020 3640 7310). Meal for two, including wine and service, \u00a3110</strong></p> <p>Duck &amp; Waffle, on the 40th floor of the Heron Tower in the City of London, was begging me to hate it. There were the usual stupidities of booking \u2013 email address, please; you can only have the table for as long as we permit; give us your first name, the bank account number of your third cousin \u2013 and the less-common stupidities of there being no sign for the place at ground level. There was the self-satisfied glimmer of the meeters and greeters and the waiter who insisted on explaining the menu \u2013 if a menu needs explaining something has gone wrong. And yet\u2026 and yet\u2026 Duck &amp; Waffle is like that irritating bloke you see propping up the bar in his flash suit, with his \u00a31,000&#xa0;shoes and over-whitened teeth who seems horribly pleased with&#xa0;himself until you get talking to him and discover he's actually quite nice and has lots to say for himself.</p> <p>It sits above the latest outpost of a chain called Sushisamba which I&#xa0;do actually hate, and I&#xa0;haven't even eaten there. I&#xa0;don't need to. It's a fusion of Japanese, Brazilian and Peruvian food, which is the sort of thing that makes me want to punch people, regardless of the interplay of the various national groups over the centuries. Even the name is a culinary non sequitur. Sushi is all \"precise\" and \"delicate\", samba is all \"look at my arse\" and \"don't you want to do me\".</p> <p>I stood for a few minutes in the dining room. It's full of the sort of people who hate sushi and really want a grilled-chicken salad. It has an open terrace which will only be usable for four weeks of the year and which is surrounded by an easily leapable glass barrier \u2013 risky, given the way things have been in the City recently. Then again, a cull of bankers isn't such a bad idea.</p> <p>Anyway, don't go there. It only encourages them. Instead go upstairs to the quieter Duck &amp; Waffle with its bejewelled views over London like a shameless plunge of shiny moisturised cleavage and the menu of drunk's food. The title dish is two fluffy waffles with a hunk of crisp-skinned duck confit, a fried duck egg and a&#xa0;pitcher of spiced maple syrup. It's the sort of thing you'd only want to eat if you were so bladdered you felt the need to keep clicking your tongue against the roof of your mouth to see if your brain could register the&#xa0;movement. They also sell strips of crispy pig ear seasoned with sugar, salt and a&#xa0;few spices. It makes them taste like Frazzles, which is obviously genius. They come in brown paper bags. We ordered a second bag and only didn't order a third out of shame.</p> <p>There was a smoked haddock scotch egg with a curried mayonnaise which was a cute riff on kedgeree, and knobbly limbs of grilled octopus with bits of chorizo and caper. There was a bowl of mussels and clams in a broth to be spilt down your pink TM Lewin shirt and a vibrant, zippy tomato salad with the word \"heritage\" in the title, which I'll forgive because the ingredients were so bang on. Best of all was a tiny burger of Herdwick mutton, with that funky meat-on-the-turn flavour you get from big-bollocked animals who have lived on a&#xa0;windblown hillside. Desserts are cakey things with ice cream, which is more drunk food. Save for a&#xa0;whole roast chicken, lobster or sea bream, everything costs about a tenner, which amounts to value for the food and the view.</p> <p>Which makes the sharp knee-to\u2013the-groin of the wine list so shocking. As is traditional I&#xa0;ordered the second-cheapest wine on the list. It was an Albari\u00f1o at \u00a330. They'd run out. Big surprise given that most people would have to be on Bob Diamond's severance payment to afford the rest. I went for the cheapest at \u00a328. It tasted sordid. They intend to be open 24 hours a day so you can come to eat good-value food and be ripped off on the wine at any time, while watching London sleep. It's something every city needs.</p>",
  "<p>The maverick <a href=\"http://www.psychologistanywhereanytime.com/famous_psychologist_and_psychologists/psychologist_famous_r_d_lang.htm\" title=\"\">psychiatrist RD Laing</a> once described insanity as \"a perfectly rational response to an insane world\". In 1965, having served as a doctor in the British army and then trained in psychotherapy at the Tavistock Clinic in London, Laing formed the <a href=\"http://www.philadelphia-association.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Philadelphia Association</a> with a group of like-minded colleagues. Their aim was to bring about a revolution in the diagnosis and treatment of mental illness.</p> <p>\"We aim to change the way the 'facts' of 'mental health' and 'mental illness' are seen,\" a later report-come-manifesto explained. \"This is more than a new hypothesis inserted into an existing field of research and therapy; it is a proposal to change the model.\"</p> <p>From 1965 until 1970, as radical ideas and hippie ideals blossomed then died in cities across the globe, a former community centre in Powis Road in the East End of London became the unlikely setting for Laing's most radical experiment in what came to be known as anti-psychiatry. \"We have got Kingsley Hall and I have moved into it,\" Laing wrote to his colleague, Joe Berke, when he was granted an initial two-year lease. \"Others will be moving in in the next two or three weeks... I take it you will pass the word around to relevant people. THIS IS IT.\"</p> <p>The \"relevant people\" in question were other psychiatrists who shared Laing's radical vision and their patients, though even the terms \"psychiatrist\" and \"patient\" would be upturned in the next few years at Kingsley Hall. At Laing's insistence, the sprawling house became an asylum in the original Greek sense of the word: a refuge, a safe haven for the psychotic and the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/schizophrenia\" title=\"\">schizophrenic</a>, where there were no locks on the doors and no anti-psychotic drugs were administered. People were free to come and go as they pleased and there was a room, painted in eastern symbols, set aside for meditation. There were all-night therapy and role-reversal sessions, marathon Friday night dinners hosted by Laing and visits from mystics, academics and celebrities, including, famously, Sean Connery, a friend and admirer of Laing's. Play was encouraged as was regression through therapy to childhood. (Laing believed that all so-called madness began in the confines of the traditional family structure.)</p> <p>The first, and subsequently most famous, resident inmate, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/2001/jul/13/guardianobituaries.books\" title=\"\">Mary Barnes</a>, regressed to infancy for a time, smearing the walls with her faeces, squealing for attention and being fed with a bottle. She later became an renowned artist, poet and, in 1979, the subject of a play by <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/davidedgar\" title=\"\">David Edgar</a>. More controversially, several patients and workers were given high-grade LSD, which was still legal when Kingsley Hall opened, supposedly to release their inner demons or buried childhood traumas. At least two people jumped off the roof of the building. Its reputation, too, attracted drifters and dropouts and, at least once, the house was raided by the drug squad.</p> <p>\"It was a place that was very much of its time\", says the photographer <a href=\"http://www.dominicharris.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Dominic Harris</a>, who has tracked down several former colleagues of Laing's and their patients, all of whom shared the turbulent, exciting and sometimes tragic experiment in communal therapy. \"And it attracted maverick doctors, hippies, people running away from the draft, people trying to find themselves, as well as the seriously mentally ill. It was a time when everything was being challenged and people were allowed to be free in all kinds of ways. Kingsley Hall is seen as a very dangerous idea now by the medical establishment, but, back then, it was part of a greater social upheaval where definitions of authority, family, sexuality and illness were all being questioned.\"</p> <p>Harris first became aware of Kingsley Hall, which is just around the corner from his studio in Bow, when he read <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/jonronson\" title=\"\">Jon Ronson</a>'s book, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2011/may/27/psychopath-test-jon-ronson-review\" title=\"\"><em>The Psychopath Test: A Journey Through the Madness Industry</em></a>, in which Laing, who died in 1989, makes a fleeting appearance. Intrigued, Harris contacted Joe Berke, who put him in touch with a patient. Step by step, he tracked down other Kingsley Hall residents, visited them, photographed them and interviewed them. The result is a self-published photography book, <em>The Residents</em>, which includes Harris's intimate portraits, pictures of the surviving but now disused house, as well as personal testimonies of those who were there.</p> <p>\"A lot of people, particularly Laing's former colleagues, were initially a little bit suspicious of my motives,\" says Harris, \"but the patients were all very forthcoming. They haven't really had a chance to tell their stories before as most of what has been written about the place concentrates on the incredibly charismatic figure of RD Laing. Nobody else has really had a voice. That is what the book is about in a way, letting the overlooked have their say. Laing is the underlying figure in the project, but it's not about him. He's the dead presence, the long shadow.\"</p> <p>Over two years, Harris managed to track down and meet 13 of the reputed 130 people who passed though Kingsley House in the five-year period. Their memories of the place are often impressionistic and contradictory, yet vivid and moving. They are all, to varying degrees, survivors of a radical, some would say irresponsible, moment when everything \u2013 even the definition of insanity and, by extension, sanity \u2013 seemed up for redefinition.</p> <h2>Pamela Lee: resident, 1967-68 <br></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395648489\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pixies/2012/8/30/1346342124083/Kingsley-Hall-Pamela-Lee-002.jpg\" alt=\"Kingsley Hall: Pamela Lee\" width=\"220\" height=\"278\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I was given some LSD.

My sister had left for London. I didn't really have any family at all.</p> <p>I had such a chaotic time in that period in London: so many addresses \u2013 there were 30 places in one year. It wasn't my choice: I just used to get turned out of places. I went to a psychiatric hospital because I had a relationship with this guy I met, a medical student.</p> <p>He invited me back to his parents' and I think I was very, very nervous at the time \u2013 and shy. His parents thought I wasn't very healthy.</p> <p>I remember walking down the street when I was with him, and I felt on top of the world. I was imagining that all the people must be looking at me, thinking how wonderful and happy I was.</p> <p>But then it ended, and it was like the end of my life, it was so awful. I went to the doctor's and I said, \"Can you send me to a convalescent home, I just can't feed myself\", and they sent me to a mental hospital. It was very dictated to you what you could do: I was so disappointed.</p> <p>I had picked up this book years before \u2013 [Laing's] <em>The Divided Self</em> \u2013 and I realised that somebody really understood; it was amazing. So I phoned up and got an interview \u2013 I think it was in Harley Street \u2013 with Ronnie Laing, and he told me about this place [Kingsley Hall].</p> <p>And that's how I got there. It was like someone actually understood. Yes, I was really very impressed with Ronnie.</p> <p>I remember that the people around us [local residents] didn't actually like us very much. There was a very negative feeling towards us \u2013 not a very good community spirit. We were so isolated from the people around us, because if, they saw us, they would just ignore us. They really didn't like us at all.</p> <p>I was given some LSD when I was there. I used to smoke cannabis, but the acid I was a bit nervous about. I don't think I actually took it.</p> <p>I remember we used to eat together.

Afterwards he lived in various other community houses. He now lives in sheltered accommodation in Oxford</strong></p> <p>I was a compulsive overdoser. If you showed me a bottle of pills, I'd swallow them all. Part of the problem was \u2013 and I've been reflecting on it lately \u2013 I was too young. I had too much life to live, and it was going to be so difficult to live it. I saw the road ahead as very long and very difficult, and it was. I mean, now I'm nearly 65, I don't think that way because there isn't so long to go and a lot of the hard work's been done.</p> <p>At the time I was at Kingsley Hall, the view really was that, if you had schizophrenia, it was no good talking to you because you would never get any sense out of a schizophrenic \u2013 it's all nonsense that comes out of their mouths. And I pretty much subscribed to that view. Ronnie [Laing] said, \"Go mad, young man\", and I did. I took him at his word, and I went as mad as I possibly could, and at no time did he try and stop me.</p> <p>There were some very crazy people at Kingsley. There was one man who set up the dining table in the upstairs garden area, arranged it all for a dinner party and dressed up in white robes. I woke up one morning and there was the dinner table all laid in the garden and a man in a white robe gabbling to himself.</p> <p>But I don't think any of them were spotted by neighbours walking on the roof, as I was once. Yeah, [once] I leapt off the roof. I didn't go the full drop. I leapt into a junkyard, which was full of old washing machines and Hoovers and things people had thrown over the wall. I got a crash fracture in my spine that still causes me problems today.</p> <p>Ronnie used to keep acid in his fridge. It was pure stuff, Sandoz laboratory grade, the real McCoy, and he wasn't shy about sharing it around. He believed it was a kind of spiritual laxative, which I think is probably quite an accurate description of it. And I do remember him handing it to me: I thought, 'This is the apple from the tree of knowledge, and if I take this it's going to be a long road back from where I'm going', but I did take it. Ronnie did believe you would be able to flush demons away with it. I wouldn't disagree, I think it's an interesting thing.</p> <p>[Then there was] the DMT \u2013 Dimethyltryptamine or 'triptamine. It's refined from a plant in the Amazon jungle and we had it shipped in from California in a briefcase. I took it once, and it changed my life for ever. Just once really blew my mind, and I never really thought the same about anything again.</p> <p>A group of us at the Hall were interested in taking it. As soon as they injected it, we collapsed on to a bed; we couldn't stand up. We were in a small room. I had a vision of myself as a dead Jew being bulldozed into a mass burial pit at Auschwitz. It was an intensely strong experience. It was the end of life, the end of existence. I felt very dead at that point.</p> <p>[Another time], I remember meeting Sean Connery. He was at the height of his James Bond fame then. He came to a party with Ronnie, and the two of them started Indian wrestling while we stood around and drank. They went on and on wrestling each other in the games room. They decided to see which one was tougher \u2013 James Bond or Ronald Laing.</p> <p>So that was all a wild party, but the next day he turned up at teatime and sat down, had a cup of tea and made it quite clear to us that he had been young once and he hadn't had much himself and he could see himself in us and that kind of thing. He actually came back to thank us for having the party the night before. He was very humble and very nice.</p> <h2>Jutta Laing: resident, 1966-67<br></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395648491\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pixies/2012/8/30/1346342421406/Kingsley-Hall-Jutta-Laing-002.jpg\" alt=\"Kingsley Hall: Jutta Laing\" width=\"220\" height=\"278\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018It wasn\u2019t comfort, Kingsley Hall, that\u2019s for sure.

They had two sons and a daughter, but divorced in 1988. She now lives in north London where she teaches yoga </strong></p> <p>I came here because I wanted to get out of Germany. I had five names of people I might contact and I picked out RD Laing at random and called him. He invited me for lunch, and that's how we met. He had left his wife and his children, and, although some people like to believe I took him away from his family, that's not true at all because he had already had a liaison with someone else before me.</p> <p>I worked freelance \u2013 with Gallery Five cards and doing illustrations for <em>Harper's Bazaar</em> \u2013 and I did very well, but my life in Kingsley Hall and my life with Ronnie became predominant. It was a run-down place to live in, partly because there were quite a few very psychotic people living there who never washed or cleaned their rooms. Some people used it as a commune. A few hippies gravitated towards the place because it was very cheap to live there. Living there we had very little [free] time; we were always a group of people, maybe three, four, five people, looking after someone who had completely lost it, so they wouldn't harm themselves.</p> <p>For everyone who lived there, Kingsley Hall was an intense period, and my life with Ronnie was intense in the sense that a lot of people wanted to meet him. There were always visitors from all over the world. Ronnie was one of those people who you either loved or misunderstood. Some people thought he was crazy himself. Hid did drink a lot but he wasn't a drunk. He was exceptionally alive and very charismatic. [The anthropologist] Francis Huxley labelled him a shaman.</p> <p>It wasn't comfort, Kingsley Hall, that's for sure. But it was an extraordinary group of people. I live a quiet life now and have for quite a long time. I can't say I have found the peace I am looking for.</p> <h2>Dorothee (Dodo): resident, 1966-67 <br></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395648492\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pixies/2012/8/30/1346342271400/Kingsley-Hall-Dorothee-Do-001.jpg\" alt=\"Kingsley Hall: Dorothee (Dodo)\" width=\"220\" height=\"279\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Ronnie was a magician, a shaman.

Germany was very controlling always and I rebelled and I didn't want to rebel. I just wanted to live and to be myself. And that was an incredible liberation, that it happened, in a way, so dramatically, it was unexpected.</p> <p>This incredible freedom in England and then in Kingsley Hall was just mind-boggling. Germany was so backwards: psychology didn't exist or therapy, I mean that was something for loonies.</p> <p>[At Kingsley Hall] it was open doors and no medication. That was totally revolutionary, that was the whole idea and it was incredible. That was in the Sixties, the big revolution, and for me Ronnie Laing's skill was to hold up the mirror. He was a shaman, he had an incredible gift just to listen, to be in the present, to tune into the other person's world and experience, and I had never met that before.</p> <p>One memory: Mary Barnes had her room and one bathroom upstairs. When she was in the bath, it sounded like a whale, she had so much fun and made these incredible sounds and the bathwater came schlepping down the steps to her room. She had so much fun and screamed and yeah, it was like a whale and the water was coming down.</p> <p>It was always quite a special day when she had her baths.</p> <p>I was a helper: I cooked, I [helped] Jutta. But after a year I started to hear voices. It was hitting me. And then black magic came into the house, this dark energy. It just happened, and it wasn't discussed. It was like a hippopotamus trampling through the house. It was so spooky I can't tell you.</p> <p>Before Ronnie and Jutta broke up \u2013 which was a very, very dramatic time for the whole community \u2013 and Ronnie had his breakdown, when everything fell apart \u2013 Kingsley Hall had already sort of subsided. But there was usually a continuity of meetings, music, getting together, rebirthing and so on.</p> <p>[At one point] I came back from a trip to Germany and there was a meeting going on at the house among various members and it seemed to me like everything had broken loose. I mean, Ronnie was furious and roaring like a lion in pain. When Ronnie left that was when the disaster hit, because Ronnie [was] a magician, a shaman and an incredible being. It was a total downer.&nbsp;Ronnie was holding the place together. Such a place&nbsp;can't exist without such a key figure, it can't.</p> <p>I was introduced to Tibetan Buddhism and [went on to] travel with my Tibetan teacher to Tibet and India. I mean, I couldn't have gone on living in Kingsley Hall. It was 24 hours \u2013 it was non-stop and as I told you I was getting loopy.</p> <h2>James Greene: visitor 1966-68; resident 1968-69<br></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395648493\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pixies/2012/8/30/1346342515517/James-Greene-001.jpg\" alt=\"James Greene\" width=\"220\" height=\"278\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">'He didn't believe in the labels, patient versus helper; there was no demarcation'</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dominic Harris</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>James Greene, nephew of the author Graham Greene, was initially a patient of RD Laing. He then started training as a psychoanalyst. Greene informally oversaw the running of Kingsley Hall. He went on to become a translator of Russian poetry and a playwright.

It was totally unorthodox but he didn't believe in formal training for therapists \u2013 if he thought you were a suitable person to be a therapist, f*** the training. He didn't believe in the labels, patient versus helper; there was no demarcation. The best thing that one could say about him is that he was a kind of shaman. If he'd stuck to being a shaman, OK, but he was also working officially as a psychoanalyst. You can't really combine these two roles and he was full of contradictions. The people involved with him suffered as a result\u2026</p> <p>One patient had been in a mental hospital: John Woods, I think. His label in orthodox psychiatry was paranoid schizophrenic. He had some fantasy about some young woman and he couldn't write letters to her himself so he dictated them to me. When it turned out this woman wasn't interested, he assumed wrongly that I was preventing her from coming to visit him. He thought I was a black magician and was controlling her. Then living in there became quite scary. There was a chapel in the building, with a huge crucifix, and he burst into my room early one morning holding it. I thought he was going to attack me with it but he wanted to exorcise me. Eventually, I did something that was against the whole ideology of the place: I tried to have him sectioned.</p> <p><em>Book testimonies have been edited for this article.</em></p> <p>\u2022&nbsp;The Residents is available as a signed limited edition of 100, or as a \u00a35 digital version for iPhone and iPad, from <a href=\"http://www.dominicharris.co.uk\">dominicharris.co.uk</a>.

  "<p>OK, here's the statutory health warning: for a long, long time, people have been saying that the next US presidential election will be \"the internet election\". And thus far, all those predictions have turned out to be wrong, at least if one interprets them as claims that the outcome of the election is effectively determined by online activity.</p> <p>The inspiration for all this speculation about the political impact of the net is an older communications technology \u2013 television. In the 1950s, people speculated endlessly about that medium's impact on politics, but it was only in 1960, with the famous <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6Xn4ipHiwE\" title=\"\">televised debates</a> between John F Kennedy and Richard Nixon, that speculation hardened into certainty: TV was the key factor in presidential politics.</p> <p>And that was the conventional wisdom for the next three decades, until the web turned the internet into something that \"ordinary\" people began to use.</p> <p>For at least a decade since, people have been seeking an analogous tipping point for online media. Some argued that Barack Obama's mastery of social networking in 2008 was critical in ensuring his election. Sceptics countered with the view that the impact of online media paled into insignificance compared with the damage the Republicans inflicted on themselves by nominating Sarah Palin as John McCain's running mate and aspiring vice-president.</p> <p>So will the 2012 election provide the tipping point, the moment when the internet plays a decisive role in influencing how people vote? Given the penetration of the network into daily life, it's obviously implausible to maintain that it isn't having <em>some</em> impact on politics. The yawning gap that existed in the 1990s between cyberspace (where people do \"social networking\") and \"meatspace\" (where they go to polling stations and vote) has clearly shrunk. But by how much?</p> <p>Judging by current online activity, if the internet decided the outcome Obama would win by a mile. His <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/barackobama\" title=\"\">Facebook page</a>, for example, has more than 28m \"likes\" and had more than 1.7m people \"talking\" about it when I last checked. <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/mittromney\" title=\"\">Romney's page</a> has a mere 5.5m \"likes\" (but more than 2m people were \"talking\" about it). On Twitter, Obama is way ahead by all the <a href=\"http://2012twit.com/\" title=\"\">significant metrics</a>: followers (19m to Romney's 954,000); number of followers added in past 24 hours (46,000 v 13,000); mentions (59,000 v 29,000); retweets (25,000 v 6,600); retweeters (22,000 v 5,000). I could go on, but you get the picture.</p> <p>Last week also saw a revealing contrast between the two camps. Romney's crowd put everything into an intensively scripted, 1980s-style rebranding of their candidate, using all the tired old tricks of <em>Mad Men</em> and old media. Obama, in contrast, just turned up on Reddit.com and did an AMA (Ask Me Anything) <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/us-news-blog/2012/aug/29/barack-obama-ask-me-anything-reddit\" title=\"\">session</a>, which brought the site to its knees. If you don't know about Reddit then I suggest you take a look; then ask yourself how many contemporary British politicians you can think of who would dare to do an AMA session on it. (My answer: one \u2013 John Prescott.)</p> <p>The big question is whether Obama's online dominance will make much difference. My hunch is that it won't. This is not because the net isn't important, but because of the peculiar nature of this election. According to a <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/post/the-incredible-shrinking%E2%80%94and-increasingly-valuable%E2%80%94undecided-voter/2012/07/23/gJQAcRMH4W_blog.html\" title=\"\">recent poll</a>, most voters have already made up their minds and only about 6% remain undecided as to how they will vote in November. One analyst, <a href=\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/newsweek/2012/07/15/paul-begala-on-the-swing-voters-who-will-pick-the-president.html\" title=\"\">Paul Begala</a>, a former adviser to Bill Clinton, thinks that the election will be decided by just 4% of the voters, in six states \u2013 Virginia, Florida, Ohio, Iowa, New Mexico and Colorado. That's 916,643 people, or \"fewer than half the number of people who paid to get into a Houston Astros home game last year\".</p> <p>Most of these \"undecideds\" are not interested in politics. But they are almost certainly among the <a href=\"http://www.socialbakers.com/facebook-statistics/united-states\" title=\"\">164m Americans currently on Facebook</a>, which is why one commentator, <a href=\"http://www.technologyreview.com/news/428530/facebook-the-real-presidential-swing-state/\" title=\"\">David Talbot</a>, has dubbed it \"the real presidential swing state\". The thing about Facebook is that many users reveal fine-grained information about themselves \u2013 home town, age, education, preferences, friends. People who are uninterested in politics are unlikely to be swayed by overtly \"political\" messages, but they might be amenable to messages from their Facebook contacts. So, voters in swing states such as Ohio or Florida who have \"liked\" a Facebook page describing Romney as a \"vulture capitalist\" might suddenly find themselves getting messages from \"friends\" reminding them that they buy stationery from Staples, a successful company that Romney invested in.</p> <p>Even in a networked world, all politics will ultimately turn out to be local politics.</p>",

I've just come from his office, \u2013 in the David Lean building, no less \u2013 where he has filled me in on the background to this particular, peculiar production of Anna Karenina. \"It's a Joe Wright-ified version that's for sure,\" explained Webster, who also produced the director's award-winning period dramas <em>Pride and Prejudice</em> and <em>Atonement</em>. \"But the great thing about working with Joe is that he doesn't lie. You get bang for your buck because he knows he's got to share his vision with everyone and he's so aware of the team aspect of film-making.</p> <p>\"He believes if everyone's a part of it, they will give that bit more \u2013 that's very much the aspect of the theatrical showman about him. He loves to be MCing, front and centre. He does speeches and everything, and he's up before anyone else, at 4.30am, working out his shots, so by the time they all get on set at eight, he's been well into his day for hours. He's the most meticulously prepared person I've met.\"</p> <p>With 83 speaking parts and 100 different sets, this is an enormous movie, requiring a steady hand and clear head in charge, particularly, as I'm about to discover, as no one really knows how it's all going to turn out.</p> <p>Just 12 weeks ago, it wasn't going to be like this. Wright and his team were preparing to film Tom Stoppard's script of Tolstoy's novel in Russia. But wherever they went, scouting locations in St Petersburg, they kept hearing about previous films that had been shot there. The same applied to stately homes in England. \"I was looking for angles, thinking if I shoot from high, it'll look like Russia,\" explains Wright. \"But then the owners would say to me, 'Oh yes, we've had Keira Knightley here twice before', and I began to get this feeling of boredom and despair. I kept thinking there must be another way to make period drama interesting.</p> <p>\"On one despondent afternoon, I harked back to the halcyon days of my shoots on <em>Pride\u2026</em> in the Bennet house, or in the mansion in the first part of <em>Atonement</em>. I remembered how much I loved having everyone around, in one place, with no time wasted journeying. And I just thought, idly, if I could shoot this new one in any one place, where would it be?\"</p> <p>The \"big idea\" he came up with is that it's almost all set in a theatre. One huge, unfolding stage, part doll's house, part ballroom. Characters swoosh from one set to another, smoothly transitioning mood and atmosphere. \"I've always loved the films of Powell and Pressburger,\" Joe tells me. \"They were able to have this heightened sense of dream, yet the drama was always very urgent and real. I always thought Charlie Kaufman's <em>Synecdoche, New York</em> was genius, too, even though I'm not sure I fully understood it. That doesn't matter \u2013 it was a poem. It's OK if something doesn't quite make logical sense. That's what films can do. They're fantasy.\"</p> <p>Wright takes me on a quick tour. There are whole sets in separate rooms, waiting to be wheeled into position. I admit to being confused. I can't see it working. Wright seems impassioned, excited, frankly a bit mad. This could be a disaster, I think to myself, and half-wonder whether I should leave.</p> <p>\"The main theatre has been an ice rink, a horse race, a society ballroom, a train station, a cancan club,\" enthuses Wright. \"Over here's the Vronsky house and through here is the hotel where Anna goes a bit doolally.\"</p> <p>We dash through a door and up some scaffold steps to a set of plush, cobalt-blue rooms. Keira Knightley is deep in thought over a large Filofax-type binder book, her piles of hair tumbling over her white shoulders. Wright goes over to her and has a quiet word then peels off to stand behind a camera that his regular cinematographer, Seamus McGarvey, has been positioning, surrounded by his crew. I linger by a monitor to watch.</p> <p>Knightley takes up her position on a crumpled bed, languorous and dangerous. Anna comes alive, dashing out of the sheets, through some double doors and into an adjoining room. It's one fluid take. \"Bit of a wobbly finish,\" shouts Wright as the camera comes to rest. A chippie comes to batten down a floorboard, and they all go again.</p> <p>It looks good to me. Sure enough, it's in the bag and we move on. Six months later, I see that very same shot on the film's first trailer.</p> <p>I go for a wander, to try to get a feel for the ins and outs of this film. I visit Jacqueline Durran in her giant costume cupboard. The two-time Oscar nominee is surrounded by material and bulky, beaded costumes hang suspended high in the air like ghosts. Her obvious enthusiasm for working with Knightley is evident as she flicks me through the 1950s-couture-inspired sketches for Knightley's 1870s outfits. \"Since she was young, Keira has always understood the importance of costume as part of character,\" she says. \"This is rare in an actress, believe me. She's even got the gumption to turn the costume department's ideas down and comes up with sketches of her own.</p> <p>\"We've loved researching this together, but early on, Joe said he didn't want us constricted by the particular period. As the Russian aristocrats were obsessed with French culture in the 19th century, we just came up with the idea of tweaking it a bit and using the heyday of couture from the 1950s to emphasise Anna's modern streak. Some people will notice, others won't. But it really helped Keira understand Anna, just as 'that' green dress became a signature part of her in <em>Atonement</em>.\"</p> <p>I march past sumptuous soldier jackets and elegant ballgowns, rows of them, like I'm in some frenzied sample sale. Outside, production designer Sarah Greenwood is waiting. This is her seventh collaboration with Wright and she takes me through her designs for this all-encompassing theatre set, based on the Kirov and the Mariinsky in St Petersburg \u2013 and a bit on north London's Alexandra Palace, actually.</p> <p>Like Durran, Greenwood is an equal in the production, both of them integral to Wright's overall idea, both feeding into the whole with an effusive intelligence. She is preparing to go off to Russia, to the Unesco world heritage site of Kizhi island, where it is minus 30 degrees, to shoot some scenes with Domhnall Gleeson's character of Levin, whose protracted yet passionate love story with Kitty provides a thoughtful contrast to Anna's torrid emotional whirl. \"He's the Tolstoy alter ego in the story, really,\" she says. \"Joe sees him as the one true soul, so he gets to go off into reality, to leave the theatrical metaphor. He gets a proper house and fields and everything.\"</p> <p>Downstairs, by the costume department, I bump into Aaron Johnson in shirt and breeches. He looks very relaxed. \"Easy day for me,\" he grins. \"Just got one scene, and I'm asleep for most of it.\" Five minutes later, someone interrupts our chat because his scene is now.</p> <p>I follow him up to that inky set of rooms and take up my position in front of the monitor again. Wright and McGarvey have repositioned and the camera is ready to dolly in on Johnson as he's curled up like a depressed cat in an alcove. These are scenes from the later stages of Anna and Vronsky's affair, when exile has driven them to drugs and indolence. They are, literally, living in the wings of society.</p> <p>As the camera moves in, Johnson stirs, like a startled beast. \"Lovely,\" says Wright. \"One more for luck.\" And they go again, quickly, smoothly but the first one's the keeper. That's two shots in the can already.</p> <p>After I grab lunch with McGarvey on the top of an old double decker bus that stands for a canteen on the Shepperton lot, I knock on Wright's office deep in the studio maze. He's just tucking into a pie and salad and his assistant, Phoebe, brings us coffees. \"Keira's looking good,\" I say. \"She's proper grown-up now,\" smiles Wright. \"She's developed incredibly as an actress and human being and she's really strong now. When we started working on <em>Pride</em> she was 19, a kid. And nothing really bad had happened to her. She'd never really had to ask the bigger questions \u2013 but over the past eight years, she's had to go deep and been challenged and been hurt and all of that makes you stronger. And she's still here. It would have been so easy to bugger off to Hollywood where they're all nice to her. But she dug her heels in and worked really, really hard.\"</p> <p>Why does he enjoy working with her so much and so often? (In between films \u2013 and Wright has always managed to get the best performances out of Knightley \u2013 they've even done commercials for Chanel.) \"I think she's exquisite, I really do,\" he says. \"Lots of directors don't really talk to actors, they're too busy with cameras and stuff. But we did a lovely three weeks rehearsing. That's directing for me, that's what it's all about ultimately, and I'm sure it's what I took with me from having grown up in a puppet theatre.\"</p> <p>Wright's parents founded the Little Angel Theatre in Islington, north London. His mother still runs it and it's where Wright learned everything. Looking at <em>Anna Karenina</em>, one can see the shifting scenery of his childhood puppet world merging with the big-budget movie world more than in any other of his works.</p> <p>\"You could certainly say that,\" he says. \"At this point, I'm worried it might be all a bit camp. It could be the campest film made by a straight man, apart from Baz Luhrmann's films of course. But it is all about artifice and form and I just hope it works.\"</p> <p>That visit to Shepperton has been on my mind a long time. It was a happy set and a big set, though I'm not convinced that back then anyone quite knew how it was all going to come together.</p> <p>But I've seen it all finished now, and it works beautifully. The concept is elegant and exciting, a tragedy unfolding almost as a musical, the flow of images and intimate scenes matching the epic sweep of the novel, swapping literary conceits for theatrical ones, yet somehow remaining incredibly cinematic. Crucially, none of this sleight of hand gets in the way of the story.</p> <p>In fact, the smooth scene changes \u2013 see, I won't even say cuts \u2013 speed up the experience, so it never feels protracted. It is a great doorstop of a novel, distilled into a thrilling love story. And Knightley is superb.</p>",
  "<p>Romy Madley Croft doesn't leave proper fingerprints, and what whorls and ridges the 23-year-old has on the tips of her fingers are so fine they can't be detected by the special machines at US border control. It means that having landed at Los Angeles airport with Oliver Sim and Jamie Smith \u2013 this trio of Londoners forming a remarkable British band, the xx \u2013 Croft is pulled aside for a long and joyless conference with immigration officials. The three musicians, all 23, are groggy after a flight in from Sydney, but only Sim and Smith get to drive away to their hotel.</p> <p>Faint fingerprints. It's a weirdly appropriate impediment for Croft, guitarist and singer in a band such as this. The xx make electronic-edged music that's ghostly, low key, as spare and enigmatic as their curious name. The trio are notoriously reticent, hoping in their promotional commitments to make minimal personal impression; and in the three years between releasing a fine first album and putting out, this month, a second, they've done so impeccably. Tracks from their self-titled debut, winner of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2010/sep/08/the-xx-mercury-prize-2010\" title=\"\">2010 Mercury Prize</a>, are used all over, and their new album,<em> Coexist</em>, deserves to become another cultural fixture. You will definitely be aware of the xx's stuff. You might not be totally sure who they are, though, these cat burglars of British pop \u2013 here, there and everywhere without leaving identifying marks.</p> <p>In the courtyard of their hotel in Hollywood, the band go unnoticed. They are left alone to blink and wince their way into West Coast time. Beers and coffees are ordered; notes are compared on a wicked, composite jet lag that has built up over close-packed tour dates in Europe, Japan, Australia and now America.</p> <p>Oliver Sim, the band's bass player and co-vocalist, 6ft 2in with a backward whip of hair, is coming to terms with it being the mid-afternoon. At 10am on a Sunday the band's plane left Sydney, spent 13 hours in flight and landed in LA at 7am... still a Sunday. Sim wonders if the experience counts as time travel. Should he have written himself a note? Don't watch the in-flight Jennifer Aniston movie.</p> <p>Jamie Smith, multitasking percussionist and producer, is not so bothered by his extreme tiredness. Being not so bothered is Smith's default position on a great many things. His woolly brown hair shaped into a drooping quiff, he's been sitting poolside all morning, snatching sucks on cigarettes before the waiters can tell him no, and thinking about reworking some incidental music for the band's gig tomorrow. It will be at the <a href=\"http://www.fondatheatre.com/\" title=\"\">Fonda theatre in Hollywood</a>, the xx's first US show in over a year, and a sell-out.</p> <p>Croft, pale-skinned with a distinctive forward swoop of black hair, has by now been freed from the airport to join her bandmates. She had to wait for an hour to get her passport back, she tells me, listening all the while to another passenger being bullied by guards because he wasn't carrying the right form. \"I felt quite upset by it,\" she says. \"I guess \u2026 I guess unnecessariness gets to me.\"</p> <p><em>That</em> is it, the xx's ethos, if it had to be formalised. Unnecessariness gets to them. They don't seem comfortable taking praise, or giving interviews. (\"We're very private,\" Croft tells me. \"We like our personal space.\") They socialise sensibly: karaoke, ideally, and nothing much stronger than Newcastle Brown Ale. They're in their early 20s though are mistakable in manner for people much older, as long as you allow the odd generational giveaway, like Sim's reference to Pok\u00e9mon trading cards, or Croft's habit of making statements with the rising lilt of a question, or the fact that millennial popstar Daniel Bedingfield was a young hero of Smith's. The trio dress in black, always have, and it seems to me symbolic of their aversions. They don't like swank.</p> <p>It should all make their next 48 hours in Los Angeles interesting, because in this most unnecessary of cities, swank is close to a religion. Before the xx depart, Smith will find himself high on a stage in an open-air nightclub, being showered with confetti and enclosed by writhing go-go dancers. A local promoter will give them, of all things, a box of pornography. Croft and Sim will sing while standing on a giant chessboard.</p> <p>LA, acknowledges Sim, is the place that pulls the trio furthest from their comfort zone. Certainly it's a long way from where everything began. Putney.</p> <p><strong>Their first album might have sounded</strong> so spacious, so uncomplicated, because when the band first started writing it they hardly knew their instruments.</p> <p>Sim got a bass on his 14th birthday, by which time Croft was teaching herself the guitar. They'd been friends since before they could talk, near-identical looking toddlers first plonked down to play together in a sandpit. They grew close in that way early-introduced kids do, unquestioningly and by increment, day after day in each other's company. They went to the same primary school then the same secondary, Elliott school in Putney, south-west London.</p> <p>\"Romy knows everything there is to know about me,\" says Sim, but at 14 it took time for them to admit to each other they'd been fiddling with instruments; writing snatches of music; even (behind closed bedroom doors, Sim living with his mum in a Fulham council flat and Croft five minutes' drive away) <em>singing</em>. They decided they'd form a boy-girl duo, and their voices paired brilliantly, hers high and airy against his rich lower register. \"We learned to talk together,\" says Croft. \"I don't know why our voices fit so well, but maybe that's it.\"</p> <p>They performed their first gigs, aged about 16, to a CD drumtrack. Their school had for a while been an incubator of young British bands \u2013 electropop outfit Hot Chip formed there in 2000 \u2013 and pupils tended to be musical. A friend that Croft and Sim had made in the playground, Jamie Smith, started coming to their shows. He was tiny (Croft towered over him) but Smith had from a young age been DJing at local clubs, a great fan of the electronica-tinged hip-hop of RJD2. Sim and Croft asked Smith to improve their drumtrack, and later he joined the band. Inspired by RJD2, Smith decided he'd try to perform the electronic component of the music live, tapping away on a touch-panel MPC sequencer with clawed fingers, playing it like a compact, percussive piano.</p> <p>By 2006, Baria Qureshi, another schoolfriend, had joined as keyboard player and the band had a name, bashed out among a flurry of ideas on a home computer. Were those lower-case letters to represent kisses, chromosomes? Whatever: under the blinking cursor of a Microsoft Word document they liked the way \"the xx\" looked written down. When the quartet left school they were taken on by Caius Pawson, a young music impresario who'd founded a small label, Young Turks. He signed them up and became their manager.</p> <p>Pawson, today, winces at me. We are in a nightclub in north Hollywood where Smith is shortly to do an hour-long DJ set. It's a side project away from the band, billed under his stage name, Jamie xx. \"All the cool little gigs Jamie does for \u00a330,\" Pawson says, pained, \"and I bring the journalist to this one.\" It's an extraordinary occasion. The dancefloor has its own swimming pool. Tins of Stella, here repackaged as a luxury import, are selling for \u00a38. Smith will get his own dancers, and a bouncer. \"Just let me know who I should protect,\" the bouncer keeps saying, and he stars in an ideal moment of farce when Smith moves up to the DJ booth to perform.</p> <p>The set is about halfway through, a confetti bomb going off to mark a high point and the go-go dancers now sharing their podiums with punters brought to a frenzy by Smith's manipulation of Kanye West and Adele. Pawson goes to the bar to get his artist a drink. Don't let anybody into the booth, he instructs the bouncer, who nods. And when Pawson returns the bouncer won't let him in.</p> <p>The next day Smith gives a rare roar of laughter when I tell him this. We are now in a residential tower block, a few streets north, where the xx have been booked to play an afternoon warm-up gig: four quick tracks on a rooftop, their audience made up of competition winners. The block has hosted popstars before, and one of its apartments is today serving as a dressing room. It's here that a war-chest of pornographic DVDs has been left, also condoms, with a note inviting the band to dig in. There are dumbbell weights in the room, should they want to use them.</p> <p>\"Does somebody actually live here?\" asks Sim, staring at a wall-sized mural that says ROCK-A-HOLIC in the style of the Hollywood sign. The LA strangeness is mounting. This morning when the band went on a local radio show there was concern, expressed by the show's production staff, that it would be somehow insensitive to mention the date of their new album's US release, 11 September. (\"Early September\" was the eventual compromise.) Outside, on the tower block's roof, the band have just done a soundcheck and discovered they'll be performing in a part of the building normally reserved for residents' games. Pieces pushed to one side, the xx will gig on a giant chessboard for the first time in their careers.</p> <p>Croft is actually more concerned about a red velvet rope that has been strung between the audience and the performance space. Doesn't it look a bit starry? She and Sim have a muttered discussion, too, about whether they should wear sunglasses for the show. On the one hand, they don't want to look distant. On the other hand \u2013 it's pretty sunny.</p> <p>It makes me think of something Smith told me, another bouncer-related anecdote from the night before. The over-zealous minder had kept smacking off people's hands as they reached out to Smith in his booth. \"I didn't really want to shake their hands,\" conceded Smith. \"But I didn't want them to be knocked away either.\" It's the kind of contradiction the xx are faced with often, as they worry out the kinks and complications of growing renown. They don't like to let people close, but nor do they like being kept, showily, at a distance.</p> <p>Smith offers up another odd moment from last night. In the VIP area after his set he was approached by a figure he recognised. Daniel Bedingfield. \"He gave me a new track he'd made,\" says Smith. Any good, I ask? Smith grimaces, and shakes his head. Oh well: it's a measure of how esteemed he is, anyway, that old heroes seek him out as someone to impress. In the band's time off between records \u2013 most of 2011 \u2013 Smith remixed an Adele single and Gil Scott-Heron's <em>I'm New Here</em> album, both successes, and he's been courted to produce for others since. He mentions a collaboration with a US star which ought to be fascinating if released. The once-admired RJD2 even sent Smith a crate of new music not long ago, possibly looking to work together.</p> <p>Any good, I ask? Smith grimaces, and shakes his head. This is his way, gruff and honest. Should one of my questions misfire (and, boy, do they misfire under this kid's inscrutable stare), Smith stays silent, just letting it pass. In a moment of unusual personal candour, he tells me how he met his Italian girlfriend over drinks in a bar, and adds with a strange sort of pride that <em>he</em> didn't ask her for her phone number. Smith's instinct is for passivity, and perhaps this is what makes him such a fine producer. \"I work with talented people,\" he shrugs. \"I'm just their tool.\"</p> <p>Outside, the rooftop show under way, the xx play through a couple of numbers from their new album and a couple from the old. Afterwards there is an attempt at an onstage radio interview, and Sim hugs himself, embarassed, taking a hit for the team by answering questions on behalf of the others. At one point the interviewer pings a rogue inquiry at Smith, who's hiding among the big chess pieces at the back. Sim has to step in and translate his friend's silent answer, a vague upper-body twitch. \"That means yes,\" says Sim.</p> <p>Afterwards, backstage, the band seem relieved it's over and in a good mood. Tonight's gig at the Fonda theatre will be more demanding but the afternoon set with its small audience has reminded them happily of early gigging days, when they played in pubs and clubs to crowds of a couple of dozen. This was around 2008, when they were working up songs for a possible album and Pawson had installed them in a small rehearsal room in Putney. Womb-like, Sim once called it.</p> <p>They were still living at home at the time, Croft tells me, \"and when I think about it from a parent's perspective we could have been doing <em>anything</em>. You know: we're off to rehearse now, bye! Luckily we were doing something.\" They were perfecting their debut, <em>xx</em>, released in summer 2009 to kick-starting critical acclaim. The band began a tour, which gradually extended as their fanbase grew and eventually lasted about 18 months, on and off. A lot of jet lag and Jennifer Aniston films, plus some emotional times along the way.</p> <p>Difficulties had developed with the band's fourth member, Qureshi. \"She has a place here,\" Sim told the <em>NME</em> at the Mercury announcement ceremony in 2010. \"She's part of the album.\" But Qureshi was no longer part of the band, ejected in October 2009 after a particularly trying few days at a New York music festival. \"There were problems that came to light because we were at such close quarters,\" Sim tells me. Croft, at the time, likened the rift to a divorce.</p> <p>They had to grow up in a lot of ways during that first tour. Most of us go through the buffeting half-romances of early adulthood with a bedroom to retreat to, a duvet to crawl under, but the xx went through it all in minivans and departure lounges \u2013 with an entourage. Smith tells me about a DJ set he was doing, somewhere on the tour, when a girl in the crowd approached him with a folded-up note. He was young, and had no clue what to do with it, so he put it in his pocket. Only after much jokey persuasion from those around him did he finally open it, in the cab on the way back to the band's hotel. It might not be too late to follow it up... The note said: \"Why don't you play some decent music?\"</p> <p>For Croft and Sim there was a more brutal lesson. \"The first piece <em>Dazed</em> [<em>&amp; Confused</em> magazine] did on us,\" Croft once explained, \"they outed us in the first line.\" Ever since, the pair have not spoken with ease, if at all, about their sexuality. Softening, in 2010, Croft gave a short, intimate interview to the online magazine <em>Tourist</em> in which she and her girlfriend at the time, an art student based in London, talked about love. What does it feel like, they were asked, to be in a long-distance relationship? \"Like when you're eight,\" the rather beautiful answer, \"and you want it to be your birthday.\"</p> <p>Sim has kept consistently zipped. \"Is there anything you want to say to your gay fans?\" he was once asked by New Gay TV, and seeming to think about it, Sim replied: \"Hot Chip are amazing.\" The xx sing almost exclusively about matters of the heart (Missing, a track on <em>Coexist</em>, might be the most aching lament on romantic separation I've heard) but their love-lives away from the mic have never been very clearly outlined. I get the sense, speaking to Sim, that he quite enjoys the mystery he inspires. On stage he sways and leers, all eyes and attitude. Exactly as a good frontman should, he makes you \u2013 bloke in the crowd, neck craned \u2013 feel many degrees less masculine because you haven't got a guitar and a catalogue of tortured love songs to growl through. Offstage this persona vanishes and he is bouncier, camper, \"more smiley than people would think\". His speech is peppered with assertive, accented \"yeah\"s, almost used as punctuating stops. It's something I've noticed rappers do, a statement of sureness and muscularity. Sim, chatting to me after the rooftop set, does it with a flower tucked behind his ear.</p> <p>Does he thrive on the ambiguity that surrounds him? \"It's kind of a double thing,\" he says. \"I enjoy not knowing everything about a musician <em>I</em> like. At a time when you can find out a popstar's favourite animal, I think it's more exciting not to know.\" Part two, he says, is simpler: \"I just don't want to tell everyone everything. If you took anyone off the street and asked them to share as much as we get asked to share, they'd say no. I don't think that's abnormal.\" He finds it abnormal, actually, that other bands agree to share so much.</p> <p>Croft has come to be more open. She is in a long-term relationship with fashion designer Hannah Marshall, and this week has arranged for her girlfriend to join the band in LA. When I meet her, Marshall is a bright, quick-smiling 30-year-old with unusual sheared hair. While the band prepare to leave the tower block for the Fonda theatre, she makes herself useful, steaming the creases out of a top for Croft to wear, keeping everyone's spirits up with chat.</p> <p>Having somebody special along for a show, Croft tells me privately, \"makes it new\". Like the cheesy bit in a rock movie, I suggest, when the singer sees someone significant in the crowd and does it <em>just for them</em>. \"Yeah, always,\" she says, smiling. \"If someone's there that means something to me, it's all I can think about on stage \u2013 that person.\"</p> <p>We are talking, alone, on a balcony jutting off the tower. In front of us are the Hollywood hills, the iconic sign looking haggard and sad. Behind us is the freeway, the 101, enduring LA's frightening evening rush hour. Croft's voice is almost lost to the noise of traffic as she talks about her father, who died in early 2010 during the band's first tour. The xx were in Paris when they heard, and rushed back to London. After that, says Croft, \"everything kind of went on pause\". Gigs were cancelled. Everyone waited on Croft. \"And then there was a point where I was asked: 'What do you want to do?'\"</p> <p>What she tells me next surprises me, because I've skimmed through thousands of words on the xx by now, and I've read their back-stories many times. The band volunteer so little about themselves, though, there are inevitable gaps, and significant ones. Croft tells me she had lost a parent before. \"My mum died when I was 11,\" she says. \"And I felt quite sad about myself feeling this way, but [when my dad died] it wasn't a <em>new</em> feeling. It was something that I was familiar with.\"</p> <p>So Croft returned to work quicker than even she can believe, looking back. Within days of the bereavement the band were playing a planned show at the Shepherd's Bush Empire. \"My dad was always there, carrying my amps, driving me around, and I knew that he would have wanted us to carry on.\" After Shepherd's Bush, the xx recommenced their tour.</p> <p>Has she written about this stuff? \"A couple of songs,\" says Croft, \"but just for myself. My dad was such a fan of music, I'd love to write something in tribute to him.\" Thinking about it, she adds: \"Though maybe it's somewhere that would be quite difficult to go, every night on stage.\"</p> <p>Separately, both Croft and Sim speak about the depersonalising effect of having a calendar that maps out, day by day, show by show, a great chunk of the near future. It's another unsettling form of time travel, and \"an awful thing\", says Sim, \"to see on a screen in front of you\". It might be why they've tried to scatter this new tour with plans, targets. They'll soon play an arena in Antwerp, to test their intimate sound on a bigger stage. On his own, Sim has written a song, not right for the band, that he hopes Beyonc\u00e9 might consider if he can work up the courage to ask. Smith has plans to build a new instrument, like his beloved MPC sequencer but iPad-like and see-through, colourful graphics conjured with the same finger taps that make his music.</p> <p>Croft, I sense, simply aims for a less lurching tour than the last. \"Right now I can see what I'm doing until next year,\" she says (and from LA the band will fly to Seattle then through Canada and on to New York, eventually to the UK and Mexico and back to the US), \"and during that time there's no room for disasters, or life, or anything else like that to happen\".</p> <p>Awful, in a way. And in a way, I'm sure, a relief.</p> <p><strong>At the Fonda theatre, later,</strong> the band perform, and I try to look out for Croft looking out for her girlfriend. I want to glimpse the singer as she pares down a capacity crowd to one. But I'm a distance away, and there's a lot of stage smoke, and anyway the show's too absorbing to maintain professional scrutiny for long. Soon I'm listing and hollering with everyone else. Nodding, too \u2013 people do a lot of nodding at the xx gigs. Group confirmation: oh this <em>is</em> good.</p> <p>But an LA crowd will demand its swank, and bands playing the Fonda tend to put a little extra zing into their shows. When rapper Azealia Banks performed here, she did so dressed as a pink mermaid, finally lost to view under an industrial dump of balloons from the eaves. Before that, Kasabian in town, their frontman did muscle poses before strolling into the crowd.</p> <p>The xx don't do this, nor shower the Fonda with balloons. Yet the production of tonight's show is unprecedentedly ambitious. The trio perform in front of magnificent new laser lights, tinged pink and gold, that shoot out from the rear of the stage. They play most of the show backlit, and it's almost a shame the band can't see themselves as the audience do, framed by these powerful lights. I'm certain they'd approve, because Croft and Sim and Smith are left shadowy, indistinct, really only silhouettes.</p> <p><em>Coexist is out on 10 September. The xx play Bestival on 8 September </em></p>",
  "<p><em>SPOILER ALERT: This weekly blog is for those who have been watching <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/series/new-doctor-who\" title=\"\">the new series of Doctor Who</a>. Don\u2019t read ahead if you haven\u2019t seen episode one \u2013 Asylum of the Daleks</em></p> \n<h2>\u201cAt first there were the Daleks, and then there was a man who fought them. And then in time, he died. There are a few, of course, who believe this man survived, and that one day he will return.\u201d</h2> \n<p>The beginning of a new series demands a certain sense of occasion \u2013 and Asylum Of The Daleks certainly provided that. This was a brash and bruising riot of all of the show\u2019s best aspects that once more raises the bar for a Doctor Who opening episode.</p> \n<p>Truth is I\u2019d been a little nervous of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/gallery/2012/aug/30/doctor-who-posters-new-series\" title=\"\">all this talk of movie posters</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2012/aug/15/doctor-who-asylum-of-the-daleks\" title=\"\">\u201ccompressed storytelling\u201d</a>. But it looks as if the Doctor Who team knew what were doing. In fact, more happened in the opening episode than has been covered in most recent two-parters \u2013 and events were also dealt with in a lot more depth.</p> \n<p>Finally given the chance to write an epsisode with the Daleks in, Steven Moffat seems to have had a whale of a time, taking a break from the fear-of-the-normal tropes that have defined most of his scripts. In Asylum of the Daleks he delivered his most old-school Doctor Who story to date, a script packed with ace curveballs and zappy dialogue. Director Nick Hurran carried us along with a madcap visual flair and a sense of scale we don\u2019t often dare expect.</p> \n<p>The episode opened in a burned-out Skaro of all places, with the audience swiftly reminded that most of the universe believes the Doctor dead. And the Daleks\u2019 declaration that \u201cWe have grown stronger in fear of you\u201d suggested that he was right to take last year\u2019s drastic action.</p> \n<h2>\u201cI thought you\u2019d run out of ways to make me sick, but here we are again.\u201d</h2> \n<p>The promise of all the Daleks together proved to be largely just a fun stunt. That wasn\u2019t what the story was about \u2013 although bringing back the old models has niftily swerved the iDalek problem, and established the Daleks as a proper species of shapes and sizes.</p> \n<p>The Asylum gave them somewhere new to go while harking to the past; this episode had the knockabout feel of an old Jon Pertwee adventure combined with the horrific idea of a place where the Daleks keep the ones even they\u2019re afraid of. The Dalek concentration camp also restored the Nazi references of their inception, but wisely, the script wasn\u2019t too heavy handed with allegory \u2013 you just can\u2019t be with a creature who talks like that. But it did, however, expand the Dalek mythology. Apparently they don\u2019t all have slimy green Kaleds inside: some of them house butchered humans. Indeed, if that really is what happened to Oswin \u2026</p> \n<h2>\u201cA junior entertainments manager hiding out in a wrecked spaceship hacking the most advanced warrior race the universe has ever known.\u201d</h2> \n<p>Cor! If you managed to avoid spoilers, bravo. The surprise introduction of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2012/mar/21/jenna-louise-coleman-doctor-who\" title=\"\">Jenna-Louise Coleman</a> served to swerve your perceptions even further; her tearaway chatter about chins, bisexual phases and souffles going some way to justify Moffat\u2019s claims that Coleman can actually out-manic Matt Smith. And then came that final revelation \u2013 the new companion <em>is a Dalek</em>.</p> \n<p>Except, of course, it can\u2019t just be a repeat of the River Song story of the Doctor meeting her first at her death. For a start, it\u2019s been leaked (red herring?) that her name is Clara, and her next appearance at Christmas takes place in Victorian London. Saying that, nobody actually ever saw her face \u2026 could it even be that Coleman appears in every episode after all? (First person to comment: \u201cI wonder if she\u2019s Susan \u2026\u201d gets a jammie dodger. And then a slap.)</p> \n<h2>Pond Watch</h2> \n<p>It was Amy and Rory\u2019s split that upset me most. Won\u2019t somebody think of River? This looks like the theme of this run; that things happen when the Doctor isn\u2019t there. It\u2019s brave to show how the events of Demon\u2019s Run had lasting consequences. But the consequence of her resentment being that Amy is turned into a Dalek? Well, that is something new. This is where the \u201ccinematic\u201d tag really justifies itself: the showdown in which Amy calls Rory out on his claim that he loves her more, is Karen Gillan\u2019s finest piece of acting to date.</p> \n<h2>Fear Factor</h2> \n<p>The Daleks have lost menace over the years, so the burned flesh of the Starship Alaska crew were brought in to up the gruesomeness. But actually, one of Asylum\u2019s triumphs is that it also really does make the pepperpots scary again. The \u201cEggs \u2026\u201d sequence where the comatose Daleks awake to face Rory is really quite unpleasant.</p> \n<h2>Mysteries And Questions</h2> \n<p>But there is something else. As we know, silence will fall when the question is asked. We now know what that question is, because Dorium told us at the end of last year. And now the Daleks are asking the question. So was that just a nice little grace note, or are we headed for the Fields Of Tranzalor and the Fall Of The Eleventh, somewhat sooner than we expected?</p> \n<h2>Time-Space Debris</h2> \n<p>\u2022 The Nanogenes that threaten to Dalekise Amy made their debut in Moffat\u2019s debut Who story The Empty Child. Although their blueprint was rather different.</p> \n<p>\u2022 \u201cI\u2019m loving this. The nose and the chin \u2013 you two could fence.\u201d</p> \n<p>\u2022 Explodey-Wodey!</p> \n<p>\u2022 We only saw the snow planet scenes because, when filming episode three in Almeria, the team realised how close they were to the Sierra Nevada snow resort and extended the foreign shoot.</p> \n<p>\u2022 \u201cDon\u2019t be fair with the Daleks when they\u2019re firing me at a planet!\u201d</p> \n<h2>Next Week!</h2> \n<p>Queen Nefertiti teams up with Rory\u2019s Dad in Dinosaurs On A Spaceship. Yes, that actually happens.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"a6d7356c-35df-444b-aa63-782a4127441b\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div

  "<p>In Beijing, when Britain's Paralympians won an astonishing 17 cycling titles, it sometimes seemed they had only to clip a rider into the pedals for them to return with gold. The same holds true in London but with one significant caveat \u2013 if the rider happens to be called Storey.</p> <p>The first couple of the Paralympic velodrome \u2013 swimmer-turned cyclist Sarah, a medal machine for her country since her pool debut as a 14-year-old in Barcelona; and Barney, a triple gold medallist as tandem \"pilot\" to partially-sighted athletes \u2013 have now won three of GB's four cycling golds so far.</p> <p>Sarah Storey took her ninth Paralympic title and 20th medal in all in the 500m time trial for C4 and C5 classification riders, perhaps the weakest event of her four in London. The 34-year-old was the last of 14 riders to go out and she beat Jennifer Schuble of the USA into second by almost a second. Clearly thrilled and even surprised, she ripped off her racing helmet and rode an exultant lap of honour, stopping to embrace relatives on the front row.</p> <p>Storey, who has born with a partly-formed left hand, said: \"To come away with the gold medal at the end of my competition here at the velodrome and hear that roar again was just so proud, absolutely amazing.\"</p> <p>It came 48 hours after she won the C5 individual pursuit in almost absurdly convincing fashion. She now competes in the road race and road time trial. Success in those would take her equal to Tanni Grey-Thompson's mark of 11 Paralympic golds.</p> <p>Barney, 35, began Saturday's track session by piloting Neil Fachie, another refugee from a different sport \u2013 he was an athletics sprinter in 2008 \u2013 to gold in the men's tandem time trial, also setting a world record.</p> <p>Storey won two titles in Beijing with another British Paralympian, Anthony Kappes. In a paradoxical twist \u2013 and perhaps a sign that the couple are lucky as well as brilliant \u2013 Saturday's gold came after Kappes, the race favourite with the new pilot Craig McClean, were unable to race after their bike suffered technical problems on their two permitted starts.</p> <p>Barney said he was delighted to have bagged a gold before his wife claimed yet another: \"I had to try to do something to keep the male end up in the Storey household.\" He and Fachie go again on Sundayin the tandem sprint,</p> <p>Sarah was in the velodrome for their triumph. \"I was sat there watching just before I did my first warm-up and I was like, 'Wow, check that out. It's my turn. I've got to do him proud.'\"</p> <p>The couple met, not unexpectedly, through cycling in 2004 and married three years later, just in time to give the former Sarah Bailey a new name to go with her new sport after persistent ear troubles persuaded her to give up swimming. She took to cycling sufficiently well to just miss out on a place in the Olympic team pursuit line-up for London. Her husband has played a major role in this transformation, she said: \"Barney's at the centre of my world, obviously, but his expertise in cycling is just phenomenal. Before he was a tandem pilot he was an able-bodied solo sprinter, riding World Cup events, spring grands prix in Europe.</p> <p>\"Barney's got an immense knowledge and background in cycling. And when I came along, this big-shouldered, raw swimmer, he taught me everything I know.\"</p> <p>It must be presumed the family home in Disley, Cheshire, has a decent-sized display cabinet for medals, while the local post office is presumably hunting for more post boxes to paint gold.</p> <p>The family effort has lifted Britain to its customary place at the top of the cycling medals table, with four gold, five silver and two bronze. Saturday also featured a silver and a bronze, the former from Jon-Allan Butterworth, a 26-year-old former RAF technician who lost much of his left arm during a rocket attack on his base in Basra, his second such medals of the Games. Butterworth led for the first half of his 4km pursuit but was reeled in by Australia's Michael Gallagher, who eventually took gold by more than four seconds.</p> <p>The bronze was delivered by Jody Cundy a day after his controversial exit from the C4-C5 1km time trial, for which he was the clear favourite. He was apoplectic after officials denied him a re-run following a wheel spin he insisted was caused by a faulty start gate. He is significantly weaker in the pursuit and would most likely have struggled to reach the final even if it had not taken place a day after he went through one of the more public, vocal and sweary meltdowns seen recently in professional sport.</p> <p>As it was, the 33-year-old from Wisbech in Cambridgeshire, who had part of his left leg amputated in infancy and races with a union flag-embossed prosthesis in the C4 classification, missed out on the gold medal ride-off by half a second in yesterday morning's heats, an outcome he described as \"gutting\".</p> <p>Twenty-four hours of frustration was duly taken out on the unfortunate Diego Gomez, Cundy's opponent in the third-place race. Cheered on by a noisy and unashamedly partisan crowd Cundy caught the Colombian little more than a third of the way through the event's scheduled 4km length, which automatically ends a pursuit race.</p> <p>If anyone retrospectively doubted Cundy's ability to win the 1km time trial he answered this too. In the first 1,000m of his pursuit \u2013 a 4km event, remember \u2013 Cundy clocked 1:05.317 minutes, fast enough to win Friday's 1km event, known in cycling as the kilo.</p> <p>\"My coach just told me the kilo time was quicker than what everybody did last night so up yours to it,\" a combative Cundy said after the race. \"It's reassuring that my form's there. I was in good shape for the gold medal last night and kind of robbed, but there we go, I got a bronze tonight and I'll treat that as my gold.\"</p>",
  "<p>When Mitt Romney took to the stage in Tampa last week to cap three days of conventioneering his real audience was not the entire nation of America.

  "<p>Hopes that a Christian girl in Pakistan accused of blasphemy would be released on bail have been dashed, as the case, which has attracted worldwide condemnation, became bogged down in legal wrangling.</p> <p>A judge at an Islamabad court deferred the bail hearing of Rimsha Masih until Monday after it emerged that two separate sets of lawyers were attempting to defend her against charges of burning sacred Islamic texts \u2013 a crime in Pakistan that can be punished by death.</p> <p>The dispute allowed lawyers from the other side to challenge the authenticity of the bail application.</p> <p>In court for the short hearing was Rimsha's accuser, Malik Amad, who claims to have spotted her last month walking near her house in a slum area on the outskirts of Islamabad carrying ashes, which it is claimed included burned pages with verses from the Qu'ran.</p> <p>The desecration of the holy book is regarded as a particularly grave form of blasphemy and can easily spark violent public reactions in Pakistan.</p> <p>Also present was a local mullah, Hafiz Mohammed Khalid Chishti, who has called for the law to be followed to its conclusion, even if that means the girl is executed. As with other members of the Muslim community in the area, he has rejected claims that Rimsha has Down's syndrome or is mentally impaired.</p> <p>Central to the case is the age of Rimsha and whether her case should be heard by the more lenient juvenile justice system. In their bail application, the defence lawyers argue she is 13. A medical report prepared earlier in the week said she was 14 with a lower mental age, although the court has not yet decided to accept the report.</p> <p>Chishti has also been at the forefront of a dispute between the two communities, complaining that Christians in the area were holding noisy services in their churches. He welcomed the departure of nearly all the Christians from the Islamabad neighbourhood in the tense days after Rimsha's arrest, but about half of the families have now returned to the area.</p> <p>\"They have returned, but they are still living in fear,\" said Shamaun Alfred Gill, spokesman for the All Pakistan Minorities Alliance.</p> <p>With the plight of Rimsha attracting international condemnation the case has brought more attention to the treatment of Pakistan's minorities.</p> <p>Murderous attacks against members of the Shia sect are on the rise, particularly in the restive province of Baluchistan. On Saturday the death toll increased again, with seven people gunned down in two separate incidents near Quetta, the provincial capital.</p> <p>Complaints by Hindus have also been mounting in recent months, with families claiming their daughters have been forcibly kidnapped, converted to Islam and then married to their abductors. Parties of Hindu pilgrims were recently detained at the border with India after the government feared they intended to claim asylum and never return.</p> <p>Christians, as well as Muslims, have long suffered at the hands of the country's blasphemy laws. For years rights campaigners have demonstrated how the laws, which ultimately stem from British colonial rule, have been used by individuals to settle scores and economic disputes, often on the basis of flimsy evidence.</p> <p>Despite several ludicrous cases, including the jailing of people for allegedly touching a Qu'ran with dirty hands, public figures are loath to try to reform the system. Two politicians have been assassinated by religious hardliners for criticising the laws.</p> <p>Unusually, Rimsha has attracted support from some heavyweight Islamic clerics, many of them regarded as hardliners. A statement published earlier in the week by Rimsha's father, Misrek Masih, credited the support by the clerics to the amount of international attention the case was getting, which had also forced the attention of the president, Asif Ali Zardari.</p> <p>In an online petition, Masih urged supporters to \"keep up the global outcry on my daughter's case\". The uproar, however, has bemused Rao Abdur Raheem a lawyer for the prosecution, who said Muslims could \"take the law into their own hands\" if Rimsha was not convicted.</p> <p>On Saturday he blamed foreign powers for whipping up support. \"I don't understand the interest of the international community because there are so many innocent people in Pakistan being murdered,\" he said. \"A single drone attack and hundreds of people die. What is the difference between Rimsha and these innocent people?\"</p> <p>Another member of the prosecution team said that even if Rimsha was acquitted she would never be able to return with her family to her home. \"She would not stay in Pakistan,\" said Mohammad Izzat Khan. \"She would be in America within a week.\"</p>",
  "<h2><strong>Day three: 1 September</strong></h2> <p>The seven-a-side football tournament gets underway, with Great Britain up against Brazil (4.15pm). There's no doubting this will be a tough match, but Brazil racked up 6-0 and 4-0 defeats against Ukraine and Iran in Beijing, so GB will be hoping to start their Games with a win. The defending champions, Ukraine, kick off against the USA (2pm) and the 2008 silver medallists, Russia, face Argentina (9am). On the track, the Irish sprinter Jason Smyth, who trains with Tyson Gay, should make the T13 100m final (8pm) and could grab his first medal of the Games while Matt Skelhon targets gold in the 10m air rifle prone shooting event (qualification 1.15pm, finals 4pm).</p> <h2>Archery</h2> <p>10:00 Men's Individual Recurve -
