  "<p>The Guardian (<a href=\"http://www.guardiannews.com\">www.guardiannews.com</a>) is the recipient of the 2012 Online Journalism Award (ONA) in the \"explanatory reporting\" category for its May 8 interactive feature, \"<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/interactive/2012/may/08/gay-rights-united-states\">Gay rights in the US, state by state</a>.\" Finalists in the category included NYTimes.com, NPR.org and The Toronto Star. The announcement was made at the 2012 ONA Conference and Online Journalism Awards Banquet.</p> <p>The interactive, launched on the eve of President Obama's announcement in support of same-sex marriage, employs color wheels to demonstrate how the rights of gay, lesbian and transgender individuals vary across states and regions on marriage equality, adoption, anti-discrimination in housing and employment. The interactive also identifies whether definitions of hate crimes and school bullying extend to sexual orientation and gender identity.</p> <p>\"Our team is focused on creating timely, contextual and relevant interactives with staying power,\" said US interactive editor Gabriel Dance. \"Our goal was to create a shareable and personal interactive that informed and engaged readers, and pushed the boundaries of interactive storytelling,\" added Dance.</p> <p>The award comes just one year after the Guardian opened the digital newsroom in the US. Since it adopted a \"digital-first\" strategy in 2011, the Guardian's online readership has grown rapidly, becoming <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/gnm-press-office/8\">the world's third most read newspaper website in June 2012</a>. US traffic in August topped 10.7 million unique browsers and is slated for growth, according to industry analyst ComScore.</p> <p>Recent accomplishments include the launch of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/gnm-press-office/guardian-observer-digital-olympics\">unique digital initiatives</a> to enhance the Guardian's editorial coverage of the London 2012 Olympic Games, as well as the addition of renowned journalist <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/gnm-press-office/7\">Glenn Greenwald</a> to its list of impressive US voices, which also include political commentator Ana Marie Cox, social critic and political activist Naomi Wolf, and columnist Michael Wolff.</p> <p>In its first year, the Guardian has assembled a talented team of digital practitioners to help shape an open, interactive and collaborative newsroom. Interactive editor Gabriel Dance, formerly of the New York Times, and his team are joined by community engagement veteran Amanda Michel, formerly of ProPublica, as open editor to lead the Guardian's work on collaboration and crowdsourcing. Recent \"open\" features include \"<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jul/12/dreamers-dreams-young-immigrants-obama\">Dreamers' dreams</a>\", in which more than 60 young undocumented immigrants shared their stories with other Guardian readers, as well as hundreds of weekly call-outs for stories, insights and ideas.</p> <p>\"We're delighted by the recognition of the gay rights interactive, and grateful to our readers whose voices are integral to our success,\" said editor-in-chief Janine Gibson. \"We're committed to delivering news in unique and innovative ways as we approach the US election and beyond,\" added Gibson.</p> <p>In coming weeks, the Guardian's US team will be unveiling a range of interactive tools to enhance editorial coverage of the presidential debates and the November elections.</p> <p>-ends-</p> <p>NOTE TO EDITORS --</p> <p>About Guardian US: Guardian News &amp; Media (GNM) is the publisher of the US news website <a href=\"http://www.guardiannews.com\">www.guardiannews.com</a>.

  "<p>There are 60,000 fewer students in English and Welsh universities this year (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2012/sep/10/university-admissions-chaos-clearing-numbers-down\" title=\"\">University chiefs fear for the future after admissions chaos</a>, 10 September). This is a symptom of a process that is eradicating the egalitarian and educational ethos of higher education, and replacing it with the imperatives of individual and corporate calculation. Staff, students and applicants are to be driven by narrow, personal and pecuniary calculations in judging what to research and what to study.</p> <p>In an increasingly market-driven sector, institutions are being forced to \"rebrand\" to compete for market share, rather than co-operate as collegial, scholarly adventures. The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2012/sep/21/london-metropolitan-university-reprieve-student-visa?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">chaotic treatment of overseas students at London Metropolitan University</a> is the latest graphic evidence of this intent. Society as a whole is being damaged. Research output is being skewed, while independent learning and critical thought are being erased by a creeping culture of \"service provision\", turning students into customers. Some institutions risk bankruptcy and being sold in their entirety. Widespread hostility to these policies exists in universities, but since the student protests against fees in autumn 2010, no comparable opposition has arisen.</p> <p>We cannot let this continue. We invite all those opposed to these changes to join the TUC march for <a href=\"http://afuturethatworks.org/\" title=\"\">A Future That Works</a> on 20 October and to come together at a Convention in Defence of Higher Education in December. This will be an open convention of staff, students, parents and educationists \u2013 to determine what needs to be reversed in government policy and what action needs to be taken. <br><strong>Professor Terry Eagleton </strong><em>Lancaster University</em><br><strong>Professor John Holmwood </strong><em>University of Nottingham</em><br><strong>Professor Colin Green </strong><em>UCL</em><br><strong>Michael Rosen </strong><em>(author)</em><br><strong>Dr Jim Wolfreys </strong><em>King's College London</em><br><strong>Professor Jacqueline Rose </strong><em>QMUL</em><br><strong>Professor Tom Hickey </strong><em>University of Brighton</em><br><strong>Dr Kate Tunstall </strong><em>University of Oxford</em><br><strong>Dr Nina Power </strong><em>University of Roehampton</em><br><strong>Professor Jonathan Woodham </strong><em>University of Brighton</em><br><strong>Dr Priyamvada Gopal </strong><em>University of Cambridge</em><br><strong>Professor Bill Schwartz </strong><em>QMUL</em><br><strong>Professor Luke Martell </strong><em>University of Sussex</em><br><strong>Professor Julian Stallabrass </strong><em>The Courtauld Institute of Art</em><br><strong>Professor Raf Salkie </strong><em>University of Brighton</em><br><strong>Dr Stathis Kouvelakis </strong><em>King's College London</em><br></p> <p>\u2022 Nick Clegg keeps claiming the tuition fees pledge was unaffordable (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/sep/19/nick-clegg-apologies-tuition-fees-pledge?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">This is not easy but I am sorry</a>, 20 September), but fails to explain how his capitulation will benefit the public purse. The <a href=\"http://www.slc.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Student Loans Company</a> is a government-owned organisation and its revenue comes from taxpayers. Did Clegg bother to work out how many years/decades it will take for the supplementary 9% tax on future graduate salaries over \u00a321,000 to generate a significant repayment stream? In the meanwhile, taxpayers (graduate and non-graduate) will continue to cover the shortfall via loans to pay for the fees \u2013 paid directly to the universities. Bizarre attempts to disarm critics by pointing out that many graduates will never fully repay the loans indicate something amiss in the long-term projections. Before this ill-considered scheme deters more school leavers, the public must be shown the calculations on which the coalition is placing so much faith. <br><strong>Professor Clive Coen</strong><br><em>School of medicine, King's College London</em></p> <p>\u2022 I have been struck by two recent news items.

  "<p>It may be the luckiest lottery booth in the world. It's certainly one of the most popular. In the heart of Istanbul's historic Emin\u00f6n\u00fc district, the Nimet Abla lottery kiosk has become so renowned for producing regular winners that it has become a magnet for the punters.</p> <p>People travel for miles around \u2013 from well beyond the city limits \u2013 to snap up a ticket. Others will make proxy purchases, posting the slips to friends and relatives in other cities. Such is the kiosk's reputation that one in 10 lotto tickets in Turkey is sold here, and demand from all over the country as well as from abroad has been so high that the firm started online sales last year.</p> <p>Melek Nimet \u00d6zden founded the kiosk, lending it both her name and her luck. Nimet Abla (\"Big sister Nimet\") started selling lottery tickets in 1928, and after she won the big new year's lottery draw in 1931 her shop earned nationwide fame as the luckiest lottery booth in Turkey.</p> <p>Certainly tThe kiosk generates winners most weeks, though that now may be down to the sheer numbers of people who buy from it.</p> <p>Ayhan Karag\u00fcl has been working at the kiosk for six years and regularly plays the lotto \u2013 so far without any luck. \"Of course I am happy when our tickets win,\" he says. According to him, about 25 of the 32 monthly lottery draws generate at least a three-digit win for tickets bought at Nimet Abla, and almost every year since 1988 a share of the new year's jackpot goes to a ticket it sold. \"It's statistics.\"&#xa0;Karag\u00fcl says. \"We sell so many tickets that there is always at least one that wins something.\"</p> <p>Not everyone approves. Abdurrahman Yildiz, an ice-cream seller at a stand next door, does not condone the business of his famous neighbour: \"According to our religion, money has to be earned, not won.\"</p> <p>Although the ministry for religious affairs reminds Muslims every year that gambling is considered sinful in Islam, ticket sales continue to rise, and have increased by 14.3% in 2011 compared with 2010, securing more than 2bn lira (\u00a3680m) in revenue for the national lottery fund.</p> <p>Religious conservatives bemoan the Turks' relentless appetite for games of chance. But it is not all bad: in 10 years, profits from lottery tickets helped build 30 schools as well as student accommodation and rehabilitation centres all over the country.</p> <p>Bekir Varol, 30, from Siirt, who works as a private security guard in Istanbul, fills out a lottery ticket once a week, and always at Nimet Abla. \"I send lottery tickets to my father every year, and every time he is angry with me, because he thinks gambling is a sin. If he would win, he would not accept the money.\" His wife nods. \"I don't want my husband to gamble either, it's not right,\" she says. After a small pause she adds expectantly: \"But wouldn't it be great to win anyway?\"</p>",
  "<p>Captain Scott, Amundsen, Shackleton: their heroic exploits are well documented. But until now, who knew about Rory Sheridan's error-strewn 1914 voyage to Antarctica \u2013 undertaken to win the hand in marriage of the thermal clothing heiress Kate <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thinsulate\" title=\"\">Thinsulate</a>?</p> <p>That's the story former Perrier award winner <a href=\"http://www..davidodoherty.com/\" title=\"\">David O'Doherty</a> tells here, in a rare foray into the one-man comic play from a performer known for lovable keyboard noodling. It's got about as much substance as a snowflake, but it's amusing and distinctive, and makes a great introduction to this poky but stylish new King's Cross comedy space.</p> <p>The story begins as O'Doherty's alter ego Sheridan, replete with balaclava, embarks on a lecture tour to cover debts incurred by his disastrous polar mission. He never intended to lead the expedition, but captains to the good ship Pelmet <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBCSMjHJAvg\" title=\"\">are like drummers to Spinal Tap</a>, and duty soon summons Rory to (as he puts it) \"pull the sword of destiny from the rock of ... options\". In his case, that means inventing the pub quiz to maintain crew morale when stuck fast in an ice floe, controlling the vessel's burgeoning feline population, and protecting the biscuit tin on which can be found the only photo-realistic image of a woman on the whole ship.</p> <p>It's enjoyable and ridiculous \u2013 and would be much more besides, if O'Doherty varied the pitch and did more to punctuate the story's movements from hope to despair to salvation. And, indeed, to love \u2013 which the tale hinges on, but O'Doherty doesn't make us feel. Instead, Sheridan barks his whole story at us as if constantly pissed off \u2013 which you would be, I suppose, if the path to your heart's desire detoured via the South Pole, twice, in a figure of eight. This show marks a detour for O'Doherty, too, and it proves well worth taking.</p> <p>\u2022 What have you been to see lately?

  "<p>China's response to a wave of protests in Tibet this year, including restricting access to the Tibetan Himalayas, may have led to a higher number of casualties in the mountaineering disaster this weekend, expedition organisers have claimed.</p> <p>China rejected climbing permits for mountaineers wanting to climb in Tibet, meaning that more people than usual attempted to ascend the mountain in Nepal.</p> <p>About 25 climbers were preparing to leave their tents at a camp high on the mountain of Manaslu, the world's eight highest peak, at dawn on Sunday morning when debris from a falling ice cliff swept over them. Rescuers have so far brought down the bodies of eight victims \u00f3 four French, one each from Germany, Italy and Spain, and a Nepali guide.</p> <p>With several other climbers missing, the death toll is expected to rise, making the tragedy one of the worst in recent mountaineering history. Ten were successfully evacuated.</p> <p>Though veteran climbers and experts say that the numbers attempting an ascent of the mountain did not cause the disaster, many more mountaineers were present on the mountain than is usual after Chinese authorities cut down on permits for mountaineers hoping to climb in Tibet.</p> <p>About 30 teams registered to climb Manaslu, a 50 percent increase over last year, said Ang Tshering, who runs the popular Asian Trekking agency in Nepal.</p> <p>Local journalists reported that there were around 250 climbers on the mountain when disaster struck, almost flattening a camp at an altitude of 7,000m. Most were at base camp however and out of danger.</p> <p>Expeditions attempting the 8165 metre peak appear to have included two teams both aiming to complete the first ski descent of the mountain without the assistance of bottled oxygen. One team had been forced to switch to a Nepali peak at the last minute after being refused a visa by Chinese authorities.</p> <p>Tibet is a sensitive area for Chinese authorities which limit access for foreign tourists when tensions there rise. Permits to mountaineering expeditions were cut off altogether in 2008 while Chinese climbers took the Olympic torch to the top of Mount Everest before the Beijing Games.</p> <p>More than 50 Tibetans have died after setting light to themselves since March last year to bring attention to what they say is their suffering under China's repressive policies. In the most recent incident, two teenagers, a monk and a former monk, died near the Kirti monastery, a centre of protests in eastern parts of the historical area of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/tibet\" title=\"\">Tibet</a> , outside the current \"Tibetan Autonomous Region\".</p> <p>The protests have led to major security clampdowns.</p> <p>China says Tibet has always been part of its territory and calls <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/mar/26/what-drives-tibetan-self-immolate\" title=\"\">protesters who self-immolate</a> criminals or \"separatists\". Tibetans say the Himalayan region was virtually independent for centuries.</p> <p>Bikram Newpane of the Katmandu-based Himalayan Rescue Association said China's ban on permits for climbing the northern face of the Himalayas in Tibet could have added to the dangers.</p> <p>\"It is never 100 percent safe up on the mountains and the risks are always there. But there were more people on the mountains this year,\" Newpane said.</p> <p>Veteran Nepali climbers called the disaster \"natural\" and said it was wrong to say it was \"man made\".</p> <p>But overcrowding has been a constant concern on sought-after peaks because of limited space on popular routes and short \"weather windows\" when conditions allow climbers to reach the summit of mountains.</p> <p>Four people were killed on Mount Everest earlier this year when dozens of climbers clogged the same narrow trail to the summit, forcing many to stay too long at high altitudes and exhaust their oxygen supplies.</p> <p>One Nepalese official said the popularity of Manaslu, first climbed in 1956, was not a problem.</p> <p>\"Yes, base camp might have been a bit crowded but the route higher up was not. This is a natural disaster. Not man-made in any way,\" he told The Guardian shortly after news of the tragedy broke on Sunday.</p> <p>Authorities in poverty-stricken Nepal are sensitive to charges that too many permits for climbing mountains are sold to foreign expeditions. However, the permits generate much needed hard currency. A permit for Manaslu costs $5000.</p> <p>Ang Tsering Sherpa, former president of the Nepal Mountaineering Association who has climbed Manaslu several times, said there was \"no any exact reason for any one avalanche\" though climate change could have played a role.</p> <p>Climbers blame global warming for some of the recent tragedies on the Himalayan peaks, which have been hit by warmer temperatures which make sudden melting of otherwise stable frozen snow slopes more likely.<br></p>",

Nothing daunted, we put on our waterproofs, picked&#xa0;up our tools and set off to cut back overhanging foliage on the <a href=\"http://www.nationaltrail.co.uk/clevelandway/\">Cleveland Way</a> at Stoupe Beck.

The new board walk across the stream looks very good and the steps will too when they are all finished. I suggest that when all the work is done we should have a champagne opening of the new diversion. The reply comes: \"Mmm, if you provide the champagne...\"</p> <p>At the weekend we went to <a href=\"http://www.howshammill.ning.com\">Howsham Mill</a> for a willow-weaving workshop, one of several of sessions over the summer which showcasing both the work happening at the mill and the talents of local craftspeople. The mill itself is surrounded by scaffolding and work on its restoration is well under way. It will be a wonderful local resource, especially for showing off hydro power. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396701809\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/25/1348587825907/chicks.jpg\" alt=\"chickens\" width=\"460\" height=\"345\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Is it a bird?

Luckily three of them were able to go back to Monday's hosts and the last was also found a room for the night very quickly. What lovely people, who are prepared to offer shelter, often for night after night. I am happy to do the 'phoning, but don't know how easy I would find taking a stranger into my home. </p> <p>Once again <a href=\"http://www.pafras.org.uk\">PAFRAS</a> was the referring agency. Their counterparts at <a href=\"http://lassn.pir2.info \">Leeds Asylum Seekers' Support Network</a>&#xa0;are now involved in both Short Stop and a new project Long Stop. More asylum seekers are needing longer stays and this will give both them and hosts a greater degree of certainty.<br>&#xa0;<br>My asylum-seeking friend has had good and bad news this month. She passed her NVQ Level 2 in Health and Social care with flying colours, distinctions in all eight sections of the course, and has been offered a place to study for Level 3. However the Home Office, after many, many months has decided that she may not stay in this country. </p> <p>After everything she has been through and all her hard work over the last two years, not to mention what she is already bringing to our society and how much more she could bring, it is heartbreaking All her friends are desperately hoping that she will be able to appeal. Watch this space please, because we may need help. LASSN&#xa0;and <a href=\"http://www.solace-uk.org.uk/\">Solace</a>&#xa0;are amongst the organisations supporting her.<br>&#xa0;<br>After that bad news, I tried to put it all behind me and helped to clear a path in the shadow, literally, of the Boulby potash mine. Potash is in the news at present as plans for another mine near Whitby have just been announced. The sun was shining and the view in front of us was of a lovely woodland and a field of sheep. Behind us loomed the bulk of the mine buildings. It all seemed rather incongruous. </p> <p>New steps are put in and old ones cleaned up and repaired, but there is still much to do. I use an old fashioned sickle and rather blunt shears to clear a way through the mini-jungle that is now the path.</p> <p>The following day was stunningly beautiful and out Coasties job was clearing a section of the Cleveland Way just south of Scarborough. Long grass, nettles, briars and overhanging gorse and willow were all making this section of the National Trail too narrow. However, one of my tasks was rather dispiriting, clearing masses of rubbish from around a bench, including the mesh from several portable barbecues, you can imagine what they do to small mammals and birds which get their legs caught in them. The stupid people who used them obviously don't care at all, there are litter bins just a five minute walk away</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396701810\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/25/1348587902176/litter.jpg\" alt=\"litter\" width=\"460\" height=\"345\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Five minutes from a litter bin.

All the paths were clear, stiles and gates in excellent order, so I had a good walk and enjoyed the last of the sunshine. Lots of grouse and pheasant around and a few skylarks still singing high above. Then I came across my cannon - top picture - in a farmyard.</p> <p>I could have done with it the next day when I went to Leeds to see my asylum-seeking friend, she still hasn't heard anything about her new accommodation, which is supposed to be ready by this Friday. I spent ages on the phone to the UK Border Agency and G4S, both of them saying: 'Nothing to do with us; try the other one.' The UKBA have given the contract to house asylum seekers to G4S whose incompetence seems to stretch way beyond the Olympics. Thus my need for the cannon.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396701811\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/online/2011/12/13/1323787390730/Janice-Gwilliam-001.jpg\" alt=\"Janice Gwilliam\" width=\"140\" height=\"130\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Janice Gwilliam Photograph: Janice Gwilliam</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Janice Gwilliam</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><em>Janice is a retired London schoolteacher who blogs monthly for the Northerner about her voluntary work with asylum seekers and refugees in Lincoln Green, Leeds, and maintaining footpaths on the North York Moors<br></em>&#xa0;</p>",
  "<p>When the New Covent Garden theatre opened in 1808, following a disastrous fire the previous year that had razed the old theatre to the ground, the new theatre charged higher ticket prices. <a href=\"http://hotgates.stanford.edu/CrowdsWhiteSite/galleries/theatreriots/page2.htm\">The audience rioted</a>, demanding the reinstatement of \"old prices\". After 67 days of disturbances, prices were dropped back to pre-fire levels.</p> <p>In reality, the \"old price riots\" were rooted as much in the tensions of the period as in the price increase, but the idea of modern audiences feeling passionate enough about the theatre to protest against rising ticket prices is almost impossible to imagine. That's despite the increasing cost of tickets which, according to the Society of London Theatre's Box Office Data Report for 2011, <a href=\"http://www.thestage.co.uk/news/newsstory.php/36692/average-west-end-ticket-price-nears-47 \">have hit an average of \u00a346.40</a>. The report included West End theatres and the major subsidised houses. Earlier this year, the Stage reported that the average price for a <a href=\"http://www.thestage.co.uk/news/newsstory.php/35823/exclusive-top-priced-london-theatre-seats\">top-priced seat for a West End show</a> now averaged \u00a370. </p> <p>Of course, many people, myself included, only ever buy <a href=\"http://theatrethoughts.com/2012/08/04/16-ways-to-go-to-the-theatre-and-not-pay-full-price/\">discounted tickets</a>. On Saturday, I went to see a matinee of Top Hat at the Aldwych with tickets brought from <a href=\"http://www.tkts.co.uk/\">TKTS</a> in Leicester Square. I paid \u00a339.50, plus a \u00a33 booking fee for each, for tickets with a face value of \u00a365. It's still a considerable outlay of money, particularly for seats that were on the extreme side of the stalls, towards the back and in a draught, and for a production in which the dancing was occasionally pretty sloppy. It may just be another performance in a long-running show for the cast, but it could be a rare day out for the audience. For someone on an average full-time national salary, which <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/economics/8909797/Average-salary-falls-3pc-in-face-of-high-inflation.html\">in 2011 was \u00a326,200</a>, that trip for themselves and a partner to see Top Hat would represent around one fifth of their weekly income, after adding in a programme and interval drinks or ice-creams. It's got to be spot on at every performance.</p> <p>Earlier this year, Kevin Spacey said he was <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/theatre/theatre-news/9141602/Kevin-Spacey-Rising-theatre-ticket-prices-are-driving-young-people-away-from-West-End.html\">embarrassed that high ticket prices were excluding young people from going to the theatre</a> and turning it into an exclusive club for an ageing audience. The West End will always charge what the market will bear, and the truth is that there are plenty of older people with good incomes for whom it really doesn't matter if a theatre seat costs \u00a330 or \u00a350, or even \u00a370. </p> <p>But this has real implications for the rest of us, and for the future of theatre. As a teenager, I regularly went to the theatre with my family and on my own. It was a habit that wasn't out of reach for ordinary people. West End theatres are fast becoming a luxury beyond the reach of all except the affluent, and tourists who are prepared to splash out while on holiday. For many families, the discounts available during <a href=\"http://www.kidsweek.co.uk/\">Kids Week</a> offer the only opportunity for an affordable West End outing. </p> <p>Why does this matter? In <a href=\"http://blogs.thestage.co.uk/shenton/2012/09/the-price-is-right-1/\">a thoughtful piece on the subject,</a> Mark Shenton recently quoted Nick Hytner explaining his thinking behind the Travelex seasons at the National Theatre: \"I got obsessed by tickets at knock-down prices almost from the moment I was asked to do this job. We started to think how to do it almost a year before I started. It was mainly a feeling that ticket prices in real terms have gone up a hell of a lot since 1963 when the National was started and 1976 when we moved here. It didn't seem to be rocket science to attribute what felt to us like a narrowing of the audience base to increased ticket prices.\"</p> <p>In the brilliant <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2005/jun/05/biography.shakespeare\">1599: a Year in the Life of William Shakespeare</a>, James Shapiro estimates that at the turn of the 16th century, more than a third of London's population was seeing a play every single month. London's playhouses and their dramatists had an experienced and discerning audience from all walks of life who were hungry for new plays. It was that audience hunger which created an extraordinary, innovative and daring new play culture of remarkable breadth and depth. </p> <p>Despite the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/stage/2012/aug/02/london-arts-venues-mixed-fortunes-olympics\">dip during the Olympics</a>, the West End appears to be thriving. <br>But if its audience base is narrowing \u2013&nbsp;getting ever older, and not being replaced by younger theatregoers from a wide range of backgrounds \u2013 how long will that continue? Since the success of the subsidised and commercial sectors are intimately bound, it can't just be left to the subsidised theatre to take responsibility for building tomorrow's audiences, the West End has to play \u2013 and pay \u2013 its part too.</p>",

  "<p>The rusting green Mercedes truck could have been mistaken for a removal lorry. It was parked in a narrow street outside a luxurious villa a short distance from the Turkish border, and the arms and legs of chairs and tables protruded from the tarpaulin that covered the back. Beneath the furniture, however, was 450,000 rounds of ammunition and hundreds of rocket-propelled grenades destined for the Syrian rebels in Aleppo.</p> <p>Inside the villa two rebel commanders and a chubby civilian in jeans and T-shirt were exchanging pieces of paper, which the civilian signed. He issued a series of instructions to the men outside, who began transferring crates into the commanders' white Toyota pickup.</p> <p>\"All what I want from you is that you shoot a small video and put it on YouTube, stating your name and your unit, and saying we are part of the Aleppo military council,\" the civilian told one of the commanders, who fought with the Islamist Tawheed brigade. \"Then you can do whatever you want. I just need to show the Americans that units are joining the council.</p> <p>\"I met two Americans yesterday in Antakya (Turkey). They told me that no advanced weapons would come to us unless we were unified under the leadership of the local military councils. So shoot the video and let me handle the rest.\" Looking in the back, it was clear the ammunition was new. The RPG rounds were still wrapped in plastic.</p> <h2>An orange flash<br></h2> <p>It was past midnight in Aleppo when Captain Abu Mohamed and Captain Abu Hussein received a phone call informing them the ammunition from Turkey had arrived. Abu Mohamed, a portly 28-year-old member of Aleppo military council, perched unsteadily on a plastic chair in a garage on the edge of the Salah al-Din neighbourhood. He had a handsome face and a great round belly. He and Abu Hussein, a short man with a blond goatee, had been close friends since they were cadets in Aleppo military academy. Abu Mohamed had defected first. Abu Hussein followed him a couple of months later.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396659191\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/25/1348578912031/Syria-Damaged-buildings-i-002.jpg\" alt=\"Syria: Damaged buildings in the Salah al-Din neighbourhood\" width=\"140\" height=\"130\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Damaged buildings in Salah al-Din. Photograph: Joseph Eid/AFP/Getty</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Joseph Eid/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Abu Mohamed described where the weapons had come from. Different donors in Saudi Arabia were channelling money to a powerful Lebanese politician in Istanbul, he said. He in turn co-ordinated with the Turks \u2013 \"everything happens in co-ordination with Turkish intelligence\" \u2013 to arrange delivery through the military council of Aleppo, a group composed mostly of defected officers and secular and moderate civilians.</p> <p>Because of its virtual monopoly on ammunition supplies, the council has grown into a significant force in the Syrian civil war, rivalling existing powers like the Muslim Brotherhood and Islamist factions.</p> <p>Stirred into action by the phone call, the two captains raced an old pickup through the dark streets near the front line, under a steady rain of shells. A few rebels, taking cover behind the corners of buildings, shouted at them to switch off their headlights. The captains continued in darkness and a state of burning paranoia, conjuring a sniper behind every shutter and a government tank on every street corner.</p> <p>They parked the pickup at their rendezvous point in front of a school and waited for the cargo to arrive. An orange flash burst from a balcony in front of them, followed by a loud explosion and the jangle of shrapnel rattling the roof of the car. A shell had hit the building less than 50 metres away. It was enough for Abu Mohamed. \"Let's go find some food,\" he said, crunching the pickup into gear and speeding away.</p> <h2><strong>'We don't have the ammunition we were promised'</strong><br></h2> <p>The rebel plan for the assault on Aleppo had been simple, Abu Mohamed said. They were told by the leadership that if they took the fight to the heart of the city, the supply lines would flow. But three weeks after the rebels entered the town, the ammunition for a front stretching from the Saif al-Dawla boulevard in the north to the Salah al-Din neighbourhood in the south-west had dwindled to 600 bullets and six RPG rockets. The lines were close to collapse.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396659192\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/25/1348579331749/Aleppo-locator-map-006.jpg\" alt=\"Aleppo locator map\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Aleppo locator map. Image: guardian.co.uk</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: guardian.co.uk</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\"They told us to start the rebellion and then we would get support,\" Abu Mohamed said. \"The city was divided into three sectors and we split our forces and ammunition between the three fronts, but we didn't imagine that we would enter Aleppo so easily. We took 60% of the city in the first few days. We overstretched our units, while the regime had decided to concentrate all his power to fight in one sector, Salah al-Din.\"</p> <p>\"We started pulling resources from the two other sectors and concentrated them here. At the same time the support we were promised stopped. That led to all three sectors buckling at the same time. We don't have the ammunition we were promised. Every day the [Syrian] army is pushing forwards. So we expend the one thing we have, men. Men are dying.\"</p> <p>Over the following days, a small amount of ammunition trickled to the rebels. The two captains piled an old Lada high with crates of bullets and drove a dozen times along sniper-infested streets to resupply the fighters at the fronts in Salah al-Din and Saif al-Dawla, handing bullets and rockets to the different units, noting the names of the recipients and the numbers of rounds they had been given in a small ledger. It was one of the most perilous jobs in Aleppo.</p> <p>They raced through the desolate Saif al-Dawla neighbourhood one morning, ducking low in their seats as they crossed intersections to avoid the snipers. A crisp breeze carried the oppressive smell of death and festering garbage. Fresh black smoke was rising from the campus of the University of Science.</p> <p>Their first meeting that morning was with Haji Bilal, a tall, wiry young man who had been a farmer before the revolution, but who had been transformed over months of fighting into a commander of a group of a dozen of his cousins and clansmen.</p> <p>Bilal was holding an intersection in Saif al-Dawla, but with his new ammunition he wanted to push a couple of kilometres down the road towards Aleppo's huge sports stadium complex, which was being used by government forces as a base for troops, tanks and artillery. After a short discussion about tactics, the two captains moved on to their next meeting, with a group of foreign jihadis who were fighting to regain a frontline they had lost a few hours earlier near the university.</p> <h2>'They are <strong>rotten, </strong>playing with us'</h2> <p>That night the two captains grabbed what sleep they could in a commandeered apartment whose luxurious gold-painted chairs, pink plastic flip flops and school books spoke of a different, better era. The floor was strewn with the contents of their guerrilla existence: ammunition pouches, webbing and weapons, empty ration packets, spilled rice and plastic bottles. A golden fish was dying slowly in a glass tank filled with yellowish green water.</p> <p>The captains' uniforms stank and were caked with salt. \"I have been fighting for eight months non-stop,\" Abu Mohamed said, his head hanging wearily on his chest. \"Sometimes I feel not only pain and fatigue but also boredom.\"</p> <p>Later, Abu Hussein's brother arrived. He was a broad-shouldered major, the commander of a big rebel battalion that fought on the eastern side of Aleppo around the castle. \"I know you are not taking care of my brother,\" he barked at Abu Mohamed in a loud, cheerful voice. \"You are sending him to the front alone. I am going to stay for a few days to take care of him.\"</p> <p>The major had been in Turkey looking for funds, and had now decided to spend a few days with Abu Hussein before heading to his battalion. He described the difficulty of finding money and supplies across the border. \"I tell you it's rotten up there,\" he said. \"Everyone is willing to pay you just a little bit to buy you \u2013 the Muslim brotherhood, [the defected air force colonel] Riad al-Assad. They are rotten, playing with us. I sat for three weeks waiting there and nothing came.\"</p> <p>He had met the former head of the transitional national council, Burhan Ghalioun, in Turkey. \"He took me with him into a meeting in Istanbul. I love this man, we met a prince in the Qatari armed forces. We talked and explained everything and he had an idea of what was going on, but he said the good times were coming soon. We left with nothing.</p> <p>\"One of his men gave us some useful advice. He said if we all pointed our guns at a Mig fighter at once it would come down.\"</p> <p>The three officers burst out laughing.</p> <h2>'Human beings shouldn't see things like this'<br></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396659193\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/25/1348580976779/The-empty-streets-of-Sala-008.jpg\" alt=\"The empty streets of Salah al-Din\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The empty streets of Salah al-Din.

The shelling had continued all night, and at around 8am the Syrian troops added mortars to the bombardment.</p> <p>The captains set out to do their rounds, heading out to inspect the frontlines at the edge of Salah al-Din. There they found a collection of bodies.</p> <p>Two men lay next to each other in the middle of the street. One, wearing a clean maroon T-shirt and white trousers, was on his back, his arms and legs splayed out, his face swollen into deep blue and grey shades and his mouth open. His head rested on a pile of garbage \u2013 small, dried shrivelled fruit spilled from a small bag he was carrying.</p> <p>The corpse next to him lay on his face, a big pool of dried blood covered the space between him and a black bicycle. A thick layer of flies covered the heads of the two men and when Captain Abu Hussein went close by to look they flew up in humming clouds of disgust.</p> <p>A few metres down the road a yellow taxi stood in the middle of the road, the windshield riddled with 18 bullet holes. Inside, under a thick layer of flies, were the bodies of a man and a woman. From their positions it seemed that in their last movements the man had tried to shield her, and she had tried to hide beneath him. In the back seat lay a dead child.</p> <p>A short distance further up the street another body with a smashed face lay next to a garbage dump. All the bodies had swollen to become stout and plump, and the smell of death floated over the rancid stench of decomposing rubbish.</p> <p>A rebel sniper, walked with us to where the first two bodies lay. He was a hard looking man, short and solemn. He took us to the entrance of a building.</p> <p>\"I was standing here when this man was shot,\" he said indicating the man in the maroon T-shirt. \"He said he needed to get to his house. I shouted at him, telling him not to go. They shot him, but he wasn't dead. I tried to help but when I put out my head the sniper shot at me.\" He pointed at a neat line of five bullets on the edge of the wall next to us.</p> <p>\"He said 'I kiss your hands. Help me.'\" The rebel told the injured man to roll his body over towards him, but instead he had flipped over in the other direction. \"He stopped talking and I left him,\" the man said.</p> <p>Abu Mohamed stood next to the bodies holding his mouth and closing his eyes. He looked shattered. \"Human beings shouldn't see things like this,\" he said. \"How will we go back to our lives?\"</p> <p>\"Do we have lives?\" Abu Hussein said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396659194\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/25/1348579020399/A-Syrian-man-holds-his-ro-002.jpg\" alt=\"A Syrian man holds his robe while walking in the Salah al-Din neighbourhood\" width=\"140\" height=\"130\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Salah al-Din neighbourhood.

Fighters walked past without registering them. A small supply truck carrying food and drink for the fighters parked next to the taxi full of bodies and the flies buzzed between the rebels' water can and the dried patches of blood in the street.</p> <p>As the two captains left, driving their Lada up Saif al-Dawla boulevard to inspect the northern part of the frontline, two men arrived in a small truck to take the body that lay next to the bicycle. He was their brother.</p> <p>A skirmish was taking place in the middle of the boulevard. Bilal had led his small unit down a side street and was advancing towards the government base in the stadium complex. The thuds of artillery fire rocked the street and the crackle of machine guns echoed between the deserted buildings.</p> <p>A big man came running up, covered with dust and sweat. \"We advanced,\" he gasped. \"They started shelling us. There are injured. The haji is dead!\"</p> <p>Abu Hussein could not contain his agitation, wanting to join the fight, but in few minutes a group of men arrived in a small van carrying the body of young Haji Bilal. Abu Mohamed drove his small Lada to rescue the rest of the unit. They piled on top of it and he reversed, screeching, back into the main street.</p> <p>In front of the supply van another man, one of Bilal's cousins, opened his hands and lowered his head and began to scream, running around in a tight circle. Abu Hussein held him, but the man tried to wrestle himself free. He wailed, rocking himself forward and backward.</p> <p>They carried the body and laid it on the floor, his men gathered around him, touching him kissing his bloody face.</p> <p>Abu Hussein's brother, the major, had been in the skirmish with Bilal. We drove to a small cafe that had become a resting place for the fighters. The major gulped cold water. Abu Mohamed seemed to have reached breaking point. \"You meet a guy for a day or two in battle and you feel you have known him for a long time,\" he said. \"The trouble with simple people like Haji Bilal is they see an officer and think he knows everything. They put their trust in him.\"</p> <p><strong>'I am happy when fighting'</strong></p> <p>\"He asked me about the attack [near the stadium] and I gave him ammunition for it. I feel it's my fault. I am responsible.\"</p> <p>The major, by contrast, was elated. He told us how the Syrian army had fired mortars at them, killing Bilal and injuring another fighter. The major had then carried the injured fighter on his back as they retreated. \"I followed them because I didn't want the civilians to call me a defected military officer, a coward,\" he said.</p> <p>He turned to Abu Mohamed. \"You know when you are in the middle of battle and mortars start slamming the earth around you, you forget all your fears and there is a strange joy and happiness. I am so happy when I am fighting,\" he said, his eyes sparkling.</p> <p>The next day found Abu Hussein and Abu Mohamed hugging and weeping like children in the shadow of Aleppo's castle. The quirky and affectionate major lay dead next to them. A single sniper bullet had entered his neck. There was a splash of blood on his right cheek.</p> <p>The major was laid in a coffin and covered with laurel branches. Abu Hussein held his head between his hands and wept, repeating \"thanks be to God\" over and over.</p> <p>The captains returned to the apartment, where Abu Hussein collapsed on a sofa and buried his weeping face on his friend's chest.</p> <p><em>The names of captains Abu Hussein and Abu Mohamed have been changed to protect their identities</em></p>",

  "<p>So Nick Clegg wants to tax the rich? <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/aug/29/lib-dems-french-style-tax-wealthy-assets?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">(Clegg proposes French-style tax on wealth, 7 September)</a>. That sounds good and, yes, making cuts should not be the only solution proposed as those who can afford it should certainly pay a fair share.</p> <p>But who are Britain's rich? The vanguard of this most privileged club is made up of foreigners living in Britain in order to take advantage of beneficial taxation conditions. So if Britain is going to tax these people to pay for Britain's problems where did those people \"earn\" their money?</p> <p>Here there are several significant issues: if wealthy foreigners (or Britons) are holding their billions in Britain and are avoiding paying tax in the country where that wealth was generated or indeed are failing to pay adequately for workers or for resources in the country where products are extracted, grown or manufactured, then what right does Britain have to tax that wealth?</p> <p>By allowing rich foreigners to park&#xa0;their cash in the UK, Britain is aiding and abetting tax avoidance. And if, on top of this, that money is made by damaging the environment or by exploiting cheap labour then the injustice committed is double-edged. And if subsequently western consumers are benefiting from the supply of the resulting cheap products, then the injustice is even more multifaceted.</p> <p>So what to do? My suggestion would be that, before we move forward on the taxation of the rich, we should first clarify and rectify taxation and exploitation issues and production/pollution abuses as these factors are major contributors to the original accumulation of that wealth.</p> <p><strong>Alan Mitcham</strong></p> <p>Cologne, Germany</p> <p><strong>Get out the tumbrels</strong></p> <p>Royal tits and bums in Closer magazine resulted in St James's Palace issuing a \"red line has been crossed\" statement <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/sep/14/kate-middleton-topless-pictures-palace-lawyers?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">(News in brief, 21&#xa0;September)</a>.

So any legal challenge will certainly keep the subject on the boil longer than it would have been had publication of the photos simply been ignored.</p> <p>The royals, like all celebrities, love the media and publicity when it's favourable, but hate it when it's not. And William, of all people, should be aware of this. Unfortunately, sometimes it can get quite difficult to control \u2013 as happened recently when the royal couple were in Malaysia. What on earth, just by the way, were they doing in a country where detention without trial is commonplace and judicial caning has hit epidemic proportions, according to Amnesty International?</p> <p>Unless a tiny bit of self-titillation was involved, why would anyone parade around topless anywhere when they know there is always a high likelihood of peeping Toms lurking in the form of paparazzi, servants or even security officers?

  "<p>Formula One's CEO Bernie Ecclestone has revealed that the contract to host next year's inaugural Grand Prix of America in New Jersey has been torn up after the race organisers missed deadlines in their agreement.</p> <p>It follows months of speculation about the financial situation of the race and the resignation in August of its president Tom Cotter.</p> <p>The grand prix was due to take place in June 2013 on a 3.2-mile street circuit which snakes alongside the Hudson river opposite Manhattan's historic skyline. However, Ecclestone says that the organisers \"have not complied with the terms and conditions of the contract which is now gone anyway.</p> <p>\"They don't have a contract.\"</p> <p>It is a big blow to F1 since the total income lost from the race would be as much as \u00a3150m as the organisers had a 10-year contract and an annual fee estimated at \u00a315m. However, the slot could be filled with another new race and Ecclestone is known to be in discussion about a Mexican Grand Prix. \"After Mexico we want to go to South Africa,\" he has said.</p> <p>Construction on the New Jersey site has begun and this year the two-time F1 world champion Sebastian Vettel and the former driver David Coulthard had demonstration runs on the circuit.</p> <p>However, the race has been beset with problems since it was announced in October last year and Ecclestone expressed doubts as recently as May that the organisers would be ready. \"They are sorting things out internally with some of their funds,\" he added in June. \"If they are ready for 2013 we will have them.\"</p> <p>The promoter of the race is the US fund manager Leo Hindery and although it has been confirmed that public money would not have been used to support the project, its backers had not been named. A senior motorsport industry source said: \"Pricing for sponsorship etc is unrealistic and not obtainable in the current market \u2013 hence the malaise.\"</p> <p>The provisional 2013 F1 calendar was released last week and the New Jersey race was marked as subject to confirmation. The calendar will be finalised on 28 September by the World Motor Sport Council of F1's governing body the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de l'Automobile and Ecclestone said that if the organisers cannot get financial support by then, it will be impossible for the race to take place.</p> <p>\"We are pretty close to the final deadline,\" he added. \"We have got a world council meeting coming up. I think if somebody got behind them it could happen in 2013 because they have come a long way with the circuit.\"</p> <p>It is the second new F1 grand prix scheduled to take place in the US over the next 12 months. The first is the United States Grand Prix in Texas, which has also had a troubled development. However Ecclestone has confirmed that it is now on track and will be the penultimate race of this season, on 18 November.</p>",
  "<p>The UK government has spent millions of pounds on training military, police and security personnel from oppressive regimes that have arms embargoes in place, the Guardian has learned.</p> <p>In the last five years, Sudan and the Democratic Republic of the Congo have received from the UK government \u00a32.4m between them in training and support for military and defence personnel.</p> <p>Sudan is the only country in the world where the sitting president, Omar al-Bashir, has been indicted for genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity by the international criminal court, while in Congo extensive human rights abuses, including extra-judicial killings and torture, have been documented.</p> <p><a href=\"http://enoughproject.org/\" title=\"\">The Enough Project</a>, which works with the American actor George Clooney to expose human rights abuses in both Sudan and Congo, says the two countries are the scene of some of the world's most serious mass atrocities.</p> <p>In information revealed in a <a href=\"http://www.mod.uk/DefenceInternet/FreedomOfInformation/DisclosureLog/\" title=\"\">freedom of information response from the Ministry of Defence</a> a total of \u00a375,406 has been spent on providing 44-week courses at the elite Royal Military Academy Sandhurst for Sudanese and Congolese forces. Other support includes military logistics, advanced command and staff courses, strategic intelligence and evaluating challenges to state sovereignty.</p> <p>A total of \u00a3952,301 was spent on international peace support, which includes border security and stabilisation.</p> <p>Much of the current focus of concern about human rights abuses in Sudan centres on conflict in the border areas with the newly formed country of South Sudan, such as Blue Nile, Nuba Mountains and South Kordofan, and the ongoing conflict in Darfur, where documented genocide shows 300,000 Darfuris have been killed and up to 4 million displaced. The Sudanese government has refused humanitarian aid access to the border areas.</p> <p>In Congo many and varied human rights abuses have been documented, especially against opponents of the president, Joseph Kabila. A UN report earlier this year highlighted \"serious human rights violations, including killings, disappearances and arbitrary detentions\" during last November's presidential elections. At least 33 people were killed by government forces during the elections, and hundreds were arrested and said they had been tortured. A delegation of UK officials has been investigating claims of torture in Congo and is due to report back shortly.</p> <p>A leading Sudanese exile based in the UK, Dr Gebreil Fediel from Darfur, is challenging the legality of the UK government's relationship with Sudan in the high court next month.</p> <p>His legal team is bringing enforcement proceedings against the government for failing to provide him with protection under the refugee convention and travel documents to enable him to attend peace talks around the world. These talks aim to bring an end to the appalling human rights situation in Sudan. He is the leader of a major Sudanese opposition movement, the Justice and Equality Movement.</p> <p>The high court judge Mr Justice Wyn Williams described the government's approach to Fediel as \"unreasonably restrictive\" in January of this year.</p> <p>In a statement to the court Fediel accused the government of failing to provide him with protection because there was a deal between the two governments.</p> <p>\"I believe the government of Sudan is requesting the UK government to treat me like this for political reasons. Their decisions to exclude and restrict me are underpinned by political and intelligence considerations.\"</p> <p>He expressed concern about the military support and training provided by the UK: \"If it was and is the intention of the UK authorities to teach Sudan's police and security officers how to conduct these matters in a democratic manner, it has failed. The brutality and genocidal activities of government of Sudan state organs against its own citizens is widely documented.\"</p> <p>In July the Foreign Office minister Lord Howell admitted about Sudan: \"There is ample evidence that the military tactics being used raise concerns that the most serious crimes of concern to the international community may be being committed.\"</p> <p>Fediel said that as well as the UK's provision of military support to his government the UK had also been providing support and training to Sudanese police and security officials. He said that in May a group of senior police officers came to the UK for training.</p> <p>A letter from the former Foreign Office minister Ivan Lewis in 2010 stated: \"The UK has a large police support programme in Democratic Republic of the Congo.\"</p> <p>Aaron Hall, the associate director of research for the Enough Project, said: \"We would hope that any nation providing military and security support to these countries would have conditions attached to that support based on the adherence to international human rights laws and standards. If credible evidence exists that shows violation of those laws and standards whether within those countries borders or externally, we would urge those governments providing support to immediately suspend that support, and further to work with international and regional partners to hold those responsible for human rights abuses accountable for their actions.\"</p> <p>Jovanka Savic, Fediel's solicitor, said: \"There is an obligation under international law that requires states to bring to an end breaches of international law through legal means. This new evidence suggests that the UK is not helping to do this but is instead giving aid and assistance to the Sudanese government in a way that could be in breach of its international legal obligations. It is very concerning that support is being offered to DRC where many human rights abuses have been documented.\"</p> <p>She said the UK's actions against Fediel, in preventing or restricting him from attending peace talks around the world, was helping to prolong the human suffering and conflict in Sudan.</p> <p>\"They are making this man's life very difficult for political and arguably illegal reasons,\" she said.</p> <p>The government provided a response from four departments \u2013 the Home Office, the Ministry of Defence, the Foreign Office and the Department for International Development.</p> <p>A spokesman said: \"Strict criteria are applied to any training to ensure that it complies with overseas security and assistance human rights guidance. For each funding decision an assessment of the risk of human rights abuses is carried out. Her Majesty's government conducts continual assessment of its programmes and human rights compliance is a cardinal criterion of this.</p> <p>\"UK officials have contact with international criminal court indictees only when this is considered essential and on a case-by-case basis. No contact with President Bashir has come about as a result of these programmes.\"</p> <p>However, the spokesman confirmed that some meetings had taken place between the previous and present ambassador to Sudan and Bashir. \"The main occasions are when a British ambassador leaves or takes up their post in Khartoum.\"</p> <p>The spokesman said that international peace support was delivered to UN peacekeeping missions in Sudan and South Sudan and funding was provided for the African Union panel leading the talks aimed at ending the conflict.</p> <p>He confirmed that nine senior national police officers from Sudan visited London in May to learn about policing and human rights in the UK, two of whom held the rank of major general. \"The officers met the Sudanese ambassador at his London office as a protocol courtesy.\" He said that community policing initiatives had been set up following the officers' return to Sudan.</p> <h2>The reaction from Africa </h2> <p>Studies have shown that Congolese soldiers are responsible for at least 60% of reported rapes in the country. Last year the UN implicated them in the rape of at least 121 women over three days in the village of Nyakiele, in South Kivu province. This came after the gang-rape of at least 47 women by government troops in North Kivu.</p> <p>The UN's high commissioner for human rights has said: \"The Congolese army remains responsible for a significant number of human rights violations, including sexual violence.''</p> <p>The opposition Union for Democracy and Social Progress (UDPS) was at the sharp end of last year's election crackdown and claims soldiers were used to intimidate voters and interfere with ballot papers. It expressed concern at the use of British resources to train and support the military.</p> <p>Albert Moleka, the party's cabinet director and spokesman, said: \"Training is a normal part of the co-operation of our two countries but we might say it is the responsibility of the DRC to use those who have been trained properly. That can only be done by a legitimate political authority. Unfortunately we don't have a legitimate political authority. There is a huge gap of mistrust between the army and the population.\"</p> <p>He added: \"In our experience it is the elite troops with the best equipment who are used against the population. I think military co-operation should be attached with strict conditions that ensure force is never used against the people. That is difficult for outside countries to monitor.\"</p> <p>Moleka said there was a long tradition of Congo's military elite studying at academies in Britain and other foreign countries. \"But when they come back, what functions do they occupy? How can they help their country? They're not given the opportunity to bring what they learn to change the attitudes and behaviour of the army.\"</p> <p>The Congolese army, badly paid and fed, is still struggling to maintain discipline after the integration of a Tutsi rebel militia following a 2009 peace treaty. Yet the international community, including the world's biggest UN peacekeeping operation, has put faith in it to quell violence in the country's war-torn east.</p> <p>In May, Human Rights Watch reported that Sudanese government forces were carrying out indiscriminate bombings and abuses against civilians in southern Kordofan. It called on Sudan to investigate the discovery of a cluster bomb in the region. Witnesses interviewed in Blue Nile also described serious abuses by the armed forces. The onslaughts have <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/africa/new-arrivals-in-south-sudan-tell-of-worst-war-crimes-since-darfur-7965160.html\" title=\"\">created tens of thousands of refugees living in appalling conditions</a>.</p> <p>John Ashworth, a church adviser who has lived in Sudan and South Sudan for three decades, said: \"While one might argue that helping an army to maintain professional standards could improve their human rights record, this is clearly not the case with the Sudanese army, which continues to commit atrocities against civilians in Darfur, the Nuba Mountains and Blue Nile, and continues to threaten its new neighbour, South Sudan.\"</p> <p>Ishag Mekki, a Darfur refugee in Britain who campaigns for the region, said: \"It is shame that the UK government behaves irresponsibly and assists a war crime government. It is an ethical matter not to stand firmly with victims of both countries. I am annoyed seeing ministers and government officials visit the UK on a regular basis for various businesses, but to train them is shocking. It means the people of Darfur will have to wait very long to persuade this government to change their mind.\"</p> <p>Pascal Kambale, DRC country director of the Open Society Initiative for West Africa, said: \"I don't think this is appropriate at all. The Congolese army badly needs complete reform and western donors \u2013 including the UK \u2013 have completely failed on their promise to help the Congolese government's effort to reform its army. Throwing this kind of big money into training not only is not in line with security sector reform programmes. It is also counterproductive because it comforts the Congo government into its lack of interest in reforming its army.\"</p>",
  "<p>Around midnight on the morning of 14 October 2006, shots were fired in an Albanian/Kosovan club in Park Royal, north-west London. One man, Prel Marku, died from a fatal injury to his brain and two others were wounded. The shooting was the result of a feud between two gangs over who had the right to rob the parking meters of the West End.</p> <p>The man who fired the fatal shots was Herland Bilali, who worked as a disco doorman, had a reputation for violence and was part of one of the gangs. He is now serving life for murder.</p> <p>Accompanying him into the club was a young man, Timi Spahiu, who is also serving a life sentence. He claims that he had no idea what Bilali had in mind and that he himself never fired a shot. His <a href=\"http://www.jointenterprise.co/\" title=\"\">supporters</a> claim he is a victim of the controversial joint enterprise laws and his will be one of the cases highlighted by a protest in Bradford later this month to draw attention to what campaigners say are serious miscarriages of justice. Under the \"joint enterprise\" doctrine a person may be convicted of a murder or manslaughter even if they did not fire the fatal shot or strike the fatal blow but were part of a group, one of whose members carried out the killing.</p> <p>At the centre of the shooting was a turf war between rival Albanian and Kosovan gangs over the theft of cash from parking meters in central London, mainly in the borough of Westminster, which claimed to have lost \u00a31,243,000 in one year alone as a result of the thefts.</p> <p>Bilali had already been involved in a confrontation over the dispute.</p> <p>Spahiu, who is 38 and was born in Kosovo, is married with two children but separated from his wife. He came to the UK in 1998 and was given permission to stay as someone claiming asylum. He knew Bilali but says that he had thought that the visit to the club was to be an attempt to sort out the dispute peacefully with a discussion between the two rival groups.</p> <p>The club was for members of the Albanian/Kosovan community to meet, drink and play chess and cards and the two men were admitted after pressing the entrance door buzzer. According to witnesses, Bilali came in, shouted an obscenity in Albanian, pulled out a gun and started firing. Marku, the man shot dead, was an innocent bystander not involved in the parking meter dispute.</p> <p>Spahiu said the first knowledge he had that Bilali had a gun was when they went into the club. \"It was all over in a matter of seconds,\" he said later. \"I turned and ran down the stairs ... I'd never seen anything like this before. I felt shocked, really bad.\" He said he asked Bilali why he had done it and Bilali said \"They wanted to kill me, they had guns.\"</p> <p>Both men fled, Spahiu to Salford. After a month he was arrested and told police that they were \"100% wrong\" about his involvement.</p> <p>He then remained silent, he said, on the advice of his lawyer. Bilali escaped to Denmark so Spahiu stood trial at Snaresbrook crown court without him. He was convicted and jailed for life with a recommendation that he serve a minimum of 33 years. Bilali was eventually tracked down, extradited, tried and convicted and is also serving a life sentence, with a minimum tariff of 34 years.</p> <p>Deborah Madden, a friend of Spahiu, who has been campaigning on his behalf since his arrest believes that he is another victim of the joint enterprise law. \"How can a man that did nothing \u2014 and all the witnesses say did nothing \u2014 now be serving 33 years?\" she said.</p> <p>Lawyers are now re-examining his case with a view to an appeal.</p>",

The final word</strong></a></p> <p></p> <h2>1. The issue at a glance</h2> <p>The justice and security bill's most controversial element is the extension of secret courts, known as closed material procedures (CMPs), into the civil courts in England and Wales. Opponents believe the powers will enable ministers, rather than judges, to manipulate the way evidence is withheld or presented in the courts \u2013 depriving claimants of a fair trial. The government claims the reform will enable judges to hear a greater range of national security cases. The bill also alters parliamentary scrutiny of the intelligence services.</p> <p><a href=\"#veil\">\u2022 Back to the top</a></p> <p></p> <h2>2. The legal origins</h2> <p>In May 2010, the government was forced to <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/may/04/government-secret-evidence-guantanamo-torture1\" title=\"\">pay out millions of pounds in compensation to Binyam Mohamed</a> and other former Guant\u00e1namo Bay detainees. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-404886150\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/11/1347364677660/Binyam-Mohamed-005.jpg\" alt=\"Binyam Mohamed\" width=\"140\" height=\"84\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Binyam Mohamed, the UK resident secretly rendered to Guant\u00e1namo Bay, whose case sparked the row over intelligence disclosed in court. Photograph: Shaun Curry/AFP</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Shaun Curry/AFP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The settlement came after the court of appeal rejected requests by MI5 and MI6 that they be able to present security evidence in secret without disclosing it in full to the claimants. \"Trials should be conducted in public and the judgments should be given in public,\" the judges ruled. Rather than reveal \"sensitive\" intelligence, the government settled out of court claims for wrongful imprisonment and complicity in torture.</p> <p>The result, according to <a href=\"http://www.official-documents.gov.uk/document/cm81/8194/8194.pdf\" title=\"\">the former justice secretary Ken Clarke</a>, has been a \"UK justice system unable to pass judgment on these vital matters\". Claimants, he argues, are denied any judicial findings while the intelligence agencies cannot clear their names. The government says the justice and security bill is designed to ensure such a predicament never recurs by extending the use of secret courts while preserving intelligence-sharing with the US and other allies.</p> <p>Without transparent justice, critics counter, abuses of power will remain hidden.</p> <p><a href=\"#veil\">\u2022 Back to the top</a></p> <p></p> <h2>3. Why are secret trials in the news?</h2> <p>The legislation, introduced in the House of Lords, has provoked deep anxiety among civil liberties groups,<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/law/2012/mar/05/secrets-scrutiny-green-paper-justice\" title=\"\"> senior lawyers </a>and politicians who fear it is the thin end of a wedge, overturning long-established, common law precedents about fair and open justice. The Labour party supports some elements but <a href=\"http://www.politicshome.com/uk/article/54266/sadiq_khan_secret_hearings_undermine_credibility_of_our_entire_legal_system.html\" title=\"\">argues that the secret court developments are \"too widely drawn\" </a>and create \"damaging mistrust and a dangerous gulf between government and the citizens it is purporting to protect\".</p> <p>The bill is also sharpening <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/law/2012/sep/13/secret-courts-bill-liberal-democrats\" title=\"\">divisions between Liberal Democrats and Conservatives </a>within the coalition. The prime minister, David Cameron, justified secret hearings on the grounds that \"... it isn't currently possible to use intelligence information in a court of law without sometimes endangering national security\".</p> <p><a href=\"#veil\">\u2022 Back to the top</a></p> <p></p> <h2>4. A short history of secret hearings</h2> <p>Closed, or \"in camera\", hearings are not unprecedented. Cases in the family division of the high court relating to child custody and divorce issues are regularly held in private.</p> <p>Public interest immunity (PII) certificates date back to the mid-20th century and empower courts to make an order, usually at the request of the government, preventing disclosure of secrets if their release is deemed damaging to the public interest. Neither side in such cases can rely on the withheld information.</p> <p>So-called \"closed material procedures\" (CMPs) go one stage further, enabling authorities to introduce sensitive information in a trial that can only be seen by the judge and security-cleared \"special advocates\" who represent the interest of an individual claimant. The special advocate may not give his or her client precise details of the evidence and can only provide a \"gist\" or loose summary. The claimant may not therefore be aware of all the allegations being made. Critics say this results in parties to a legal dispute no longer being on an equal footing, tilting the advantage in the government's favour.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-404886151\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2011/11/10/1320941804650/Royal-British-Legion-Popp-003.jpg\" alt=\"Royal British Legion Poppy Appeal\" width=\"140\" height=\"84\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Royal British Legion and Nick Clegg pressured the government to exempt coroners' courts from the bill.

First, the judge can make a decision only if the secretary of state makes an application and has no other jurisdiction to consider it. Secondly, when the judge does come to consider it, it is not for him to weigh up the relative merits of PII or CMP, or to decide what the fairest way would be to decide the case.
