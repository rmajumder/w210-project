First off the blocks is The Orphan Of Zhao, the first Chinese play to be translated in the west and which is presented here in a version by James Fenton. With origins dating back to the fourth century, the piece (sometimes known as The Chinese Hamlet) tells of a young man who, in the wake of a violent coup, discovers the truth of his background and sets out to take his revenge.</p> <p><strong><em>The Swan, Royal Shakespeare Theatre, Tue to 26 Mar</em></strong></p> <p><em>LG</em></p> <h2>Nosferatu, London</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398407884\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/25/1351169259918/Noeferatu-008.jpg\" alt=\"Noeferatu\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Photograph: Marta Orlik-Gaillard</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Marta Orlik-Gaillard</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Halloween shivers are guaranteed at the Barbican, with one of the highlights of its 2012 programme the third visit of Poland's TR Warszawa company, this time with a production of Nosferatu, inspired by Bram Stoker's Dracula.

Golding had a close connection with Salisbury. He lived in the city and taught at Bishop Wordsworth's grammar school in the Cathedral Close. It also provided him with the inspiration for The Spire which tells the story of Dean Jocelin and the men who envisaged building a 400-foot spire on Salisbury Cathedral, in spite of the fact that no one had ever built that high, the cathedral had no foundations, and there was no money.

But with the current US president being a black man espousing liberal values, it would seem that a great deal has changed since Williams's depiction of small-town life in America's deep south in the 1940s. Or has it? Frankcom's production aims to hold up a mirror to the contemporary world and maybe even to the hate crimes of modern America. She tells the story of a young drifter who arrives in a small town with nothing but a guitar and who manages to form a relationship with Lady Torrance, an unhappy woman trapped in a loveless marriage.

Many of the seasonal horror festivals around the country feature previews of <strong>Excision</strong> (in which an unstable teen tests out her self-taught surgical skills) and <strong>American Mary</strong> (medical student finds gory sideline on the fetish circuit).

  "<p>Forget the perverted murders, the unwitting necrophilia and the demonic babies. The juiciest scene in American Horror Story's wacky first season was a deliciously acidic dialogue duel between Jessica Lange's maniacal matriarch and Zachary Quinto's gay ghost. Chastising him for planning to steal twin babies and raise them with his boyfriend (also a ghost), she piles on the fire and brimstone. He battles her homophobia with sardonic wit.</p> <p>\"Men shall not lie with men. It is an abomination,\" she spits.</p> <p>\"So is that hairdo,\" he lobs back, \"but I figure that's your business.\"</p> <p>After appearing in just four of that season's 12 episodes, Quinto has been promoted to co-lead, as a psychiatrist pitted directly against Lange, now playing a demonic nun, in season two. While many of the cast members are back, the world is entirely new. This time we're in 1964, in an asylum for the criminally insane, with the series promising to be darker, more chilling and more adult. The fresh start is, well, refreshing. Co-creator <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/tv-and-radio/2011/nov/05/a-good-week-for-ryan-murphy\" title=\"\">Ryan Murphy</a> says some big-name cinema actors, who wouldn't normally work in TV because of the time commitment, have been sniffing around, eager to get involved for a season, and the appeal is clear.</p> <p>\"Ryan came to me in the middle of last season and told me his plan,\" says Quinto, from his LA home. \"It got me so excited because that doesn't really happen on American television, where actors essentially become part of a repertory company and get to create different characters and entirely different worlds and tell different stories. One of the big challenges of television is, if it's a successful series that one finds themselves on, you can be stuck there, playing the same character for seven years, and that can be really limiting. This is the best formula to solve that.\"</p> <h2>'I think any American that is LGBT, or loves someone who is LGBT, or supports someone who is LGBT, has only one choice in this election'</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/mbDxr3NDZhc?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"369\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/mbDxr3NDZhc\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p><br><a href=\"http://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/mbDxr3NDZhc\">Reading this on mobile?

The show launched an actor, who \u2013 fictional superpowers aside \u2013 looks somehow tweaked, airbrushed, otherworldly, with eyes so powerfully transfixing they threaten to bore holes through your screen. While Heroes made him a TV star, JJ Abrams's <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/star-trek\" title=\"\">Star Trek</a>, which Quinto stole with a wonderfully warm take on the half-human Spock, made him a cinema star; his charismatic turn was very much the heart of the film.</p> <p>For some time, Quinto has been using his growing celebrity status to support social and political causes. He's hugely supportive of Obama and is currently on the campaign trail, he says, spending as much time as he can on the road. Two days before the Guardian speaks to him, he appears on an emotional <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEzSaQgbM6s\" title=\"\">YouTube video</a> for Obama Pride: LGBT Americans For Obama, in which he endorses the President for re-election. \"Having the president of the United States declare his belief that gay couples should be allowed to marry and to use the word marry \u2026 it was incredibly inspiring to watch that all unfold,\" says Quinto on the video.</p> <p>\"I was really proud to be a part of that,\" he says. \"I think any American that is LGBT, or loves someone who is LGBT, or supports someone who is LGBT, has only one choice in this election, because the differences between these two candidates on that issue alone are so diametrically opposed. Mitt Romney actively seeks to roll back progress that we have all made and fought so hard to make, and to me that's just not acceptable.\"</p> <p>Quinto came out, subtly and gracefully, in an interview with New York magazine a year ago. \"I had been thinking about it all the time for a while, just sort of peripherally,\" he says. \"I knew it was something I wanted to do and I knew I needed to make sure that the moment was right for me. So it was my voice, the way it happened was authentic.\"</p> <p>He's subsequently received \"an overwhelming wave of support,\" he says, and is naturally gratified when people give him personal accounts of how it's helped them and made a difference. He had already been pro-active with LGBT suicide-prevention organisation the <a href=\"http://www.thetrevorproject.org/\" title=\"\">Trevor Project</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.itgetsbetter.org/\" title=\"\">It Gets Better</a> initiative, among others, but it must be exciting for him to be able to lend his support with his cards on the table. \"Yeah, it's true actually,\" he says. \"I feel like being able to speak with a more authentic voice now gives me a stronger sense of purpose, and it's a big part of the reason why I made the decision to stand up and come out, to be able to make any kind of positive change in the world. The LGBT community means a great deal to me, and an even greater deal to me now.\"</p> <h2>'Ooh, slash fiction, I see, yes, yes.

Certainly, many of his acting projects fit snugly with his social views, if not overtly. The new season of American Horror Story may be a scare-fest set in an asylum, but the first episode alone tackles prejudice about same-sex couples and mixed marriages, while Star Trek creator Gene Roddenberry's mission was always to explore social issues and to push for progress. With or without the Spock ears, Quinto very much seems to be on the same page.</p> <p>Spock himself \u2013 or at least Spock v1, Leonard Nimoy, who memorably starred alongside Quinto in Abrams's film \u2013 had casting approval for the character, and the pair forged a close bond soon after they met in 2007. Quinto wanted to draw from Nimoy himself and a surrogate father-son relationship is evident in videos of them together. \"We're very close and we spend a fair amount of time together if we're both in town,\" says Quinto, clearly very fond of him. \"We keep in very close touch, I see him and his wife often. I take a lot of care to keep them involved in what's going on for me, and they do the same.\"</p> <p>Quinto is immensely proud to be a part of the Trek world, and speaks enthusiastically about the sequel <a href=\"http://www.empireonline.com/news/story.asp?NID=35405\" title=\"\">Star Trek Into Darkness</a>, which hits screens next May. \"It was a much bigger experience,\" he says. \"We shot it in 3D and in Imax. It's bolder. I'm excited to see it come together.\"</p> <p>He's not alone: Star Trek remains huge; today's fans are reassuringly rabid, and the day we speak is the opening day of the Destination Star Trek London convention (in which William Shatner, when asked on stage what addition he would like to have made to the captain's chair, suggested a toilet). I ask Quinto if he's heard the editing job a couple of fans did with his Star Trek audiobook, cutting his words into a slice of extremely <a href=\"http://io9.com/5430785/zachary-quinto-fulfills-your-trek-slash-fantasies\" title=\"\">filthy Spock/Kirk slash fiction</a>.</p> <p>\"Ooh, slash fiction, I see, yes, yes.\" He hasn't heard it. \"I myself am not very well-versed in the world of slash fiction,\" he says, marvelling at the time one would have had to spend to edit his perfectly innocent eight-hour recording into three minutes of steamy grot. \"That kind of time is a luxury that I don't have in any way.

It's as much a New Labour thing, the measurement and statistics, as anything. I think we've tragically conflated literacy and reading and there's already a whole generation that doesn't read, there are young teachers now who don't read.\"</p> <p>An Ofsted report on literacy published in March said: \"Many primary teachers \u2013 understandably, since most are not subject specialists \u2013 have a very limited understanding of the world of literature, including good-quality contemporary literature. Over half the teachers involved in the research could name only one, two or no poets at all.\"</p> <p>But while the government and Ofsted chief, Sir Michael Wilshaw, think the way to raise standards is more synthetic phonics \u2013 a method of teaching reading that involves learning the sounds of letters and groups of letters \u2013 Cottrell Boyce believes more emphasis should be put on reading for fun.</p> <p>\"That's what changed my life,\" he says. \"It wasn't anything measurable that we were doing. I really became aware of that during the Olympics because we were all of us in that room drawing on stuff that we'd read as children and none of it was stuff we were examined on. If you look at the ceremony and what was in it, it was a sense of wonderment in storytelling. We found that we had this common heritage \u2013 Mary Poppins and so on.\"</p> <p>The Olympics opening ceremony also featured JK Rowling reading from Peter Pan and a parade of villains including Cruella de Vil from The Hundred and One Dalmations.</p> <p>Michael Morpurgo, Michael Rosen and Philip Pullman are among other prominent children's writers to have criticised the government's focus on phonics.</p>",
  "<p>First the bad news. Children's savings accounts are, on the whole, dreadful. The big banks pay as little as 0.25% interest a year, hardly an incentive for children to learn the savings habit. But now for the good news. With a little bit of searching around you can find children's accounts paying 3% interest, and Junior Isas as much as 6%.</p> <p>The paltry rates paid to young savers by some institutions are quite shocking. HSBC, for example, calls its offering the \"High Interest Savings Account for Children\". The high interest? A miserable 0.5%.</p> <p>We looked at the interest paid on balances of \u00a3500 or more. NatWest's Young Saver pays a gross 0.8% and Nationwide's Smart account just 0.75%. But the award for meanest big bank goes to Barclays. Its Children's Saver pays a measly 0.25%.</p> <p>So if you're a parent, grandparent or guardian, and want to open an account for a child, what should you do?</p> <p>It's as easy as 1-2-3:</p> <h2>1. Decide which type is the most suitable</h2> <p>There are a wide variety of account types, from instant access to regular saver accounts and fixed rate bonds, where early access to the money may be restricted.</p> <p>Your choice will depend largely on whether you want the child to be able to use it (with your help) to deposit irregular and small amounts. If so, it is preferable to choose an account at a branch near home, with a passbook, so they can see their savings grow. Or one which you, and maybe other relatives, want to use to save on the child's behalf in order to build them a nest egg.</p> <h2>2. Avoid tax on your child's savings</h2> <p>A child is likely to be a non-taxpayer and therefore can earn gross interest on their account, without the automatic deduction of 20% tax. Children, like adults, have a personal allowance (\u00a38,105 for the tax year 2012-13) which is money they can receive tax-free.</p> <p>So as long as their annual income, including interest from savings, is below this amount, they can receive interest on savings without having tax deducted. To make sure savings interest is paid gross, parents or guardians need to fill in an R85 form, available from all banks and building societies or downloadable from <a href=\"http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/forms/r85.pdf\" title=\"\">hmrc.gov.uk</a>.</p> <p>But the tax authorities are worried that it would be too easy and tempting for adults to put all their savings in their children's accounts to avoid tax. So while you can invest as much as you like in an account on a child's behalf, if the money you give your child earns more than \u00a3100 a year, the whole lot will be taxed as if it were your own, and no interest will be paid gross. The \u00a3100 rule applies to young people until they reach 18 or marry, whichever comes first.</p> <p>The rule applies separately to each parent (or civil partner), so if both parents contribute equally the child can earn interest of up to \u00a3200 a year without tax. But the rule doesn't apply to grandparents, who are free to deposit as much as they like into a children's account.</p> <h2>3. Seek out the best-paying accounts</h2> <p><strong>Best for instant access</strong></p> <p>\u2022 The<strong> </strong>Little Rock instant access account from <strong>Virgin Money</strong>, pays 3%. It is a passbook account aimed at the under-16s, and can be opened with \u00a31.</p> <p>As the name suggests, you get instant access, with no limit on the number of withdrawals. The account can be operated at a branch, by post or by phone. An adult must be named on the account alongside the named child as a trustee.</p> <p> \u2022 The Young Savers branch-based instant access account from <strong>Lloyds TSB</strong>, also pays 3% on \u00a31-\u00a320,000 (0.5% on \u00a320,000+) but can only be opened by a child under 16 with a parent or guardian who already has a Lloyds TSB current account. It comes with a gift of a Stanley (the dog) money box and the controlling adult can boost the child's savings by registering for the bank's \"save the change\" incentive, so that every time they use their Lloyds TSB Visa debit card, the bank rounds up the amount spent to the nearest pound, and transfers the difference from their current account into the child's account. </p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Skipton</strong> building society's instant access Leap Issue 2 account, open to children up to 18, pays 2.75% on \u00a31 - \u00a350,000, but this variable rate includes an introductory bonus and drops by 0.50% after the first 12 months.</p> <p>If the child is under eight, an adult will need to open the passbook-based account and sign withdrawal slips. Children get stickers to collect, and cash in for children's books each time they save \u00a320 in their account. </p> <p>\u2022 The <strong>Halifax Young Saver </strong>instant access account for children aged 0-15 pays 2% on a minimum \u00a31 with no limit to the amount that can be saved or withdrawn. A cash card can be issued if the child is seven or older. The person opening the account must be over 18.</p> <p><strong>Best for regular saving</strong></p> <p>If you want to stash regular cash away on behalf of a child aged under 16, <strong>Halifax's </strong>one-year Kids Regular Saver pays a fixed rate of 6% on regular monthly savings of between \u00a310 and \u00a3100 a month by standing order only, with no withdrawals during the 12 months. You don't have to save the same amount each month. Interest is paid on maturity after 12 months on a maximum of \u00a31,200.</p> <p><strong>Best for locking the money away</strong></p> <p>If you are happy to do so for longer periods, look at <strong>Leeds</strong> building society's Young Investor 5-Year Fixed-Rate Bond (issue 5) paying 3.25% on \u00a3100 plus for 0-17-year-olds, maturing on 31 July 2017, which allows limited withdrawals and five-year bonds, all paying 3.20% from Clydesdale Bank (min. \u00a350), Yorkshire Bank (\u00a350) and Halifax (min. \u00a3500).</p> <p><strong>Best for going local </strong></p> <p>Higher-paying instant access accounts offered by smaller savings providers include <strong>Mansfield</strong> building society's Young Saver paying 2.5% on \u00a31-\u00a325,000, <strong>Stafford Railway </strong>building society's First Track paying 2.25% on \u00a31-\u00a325,000 and <strong>Earl Shilton</strong> building society's Foundation paying 2.25% on \u00a3250-\u00a310,000. <strong>Bath </strong>building society's Futurebuilder pays an impressive 5% gross on the first \u00a3500, above which the rate falls to 1.10%. But the account is only open to applicants living in Wiltshire, Somerset, Gloucestershire and Dorset.</p> <p><strong>Best 'first bank account' </strong></p> <p>Not strictly a savings account but, for older children who are ready for a current account that also earns them a competitive rate when in credit, consider <strong>Santander's</strong> 11-15 Current Account which pays 3% on balances up to \u00a3500, as long as they pay in some money in each month.</p> <p>The account comes with a debit card or cash card if preferred to access their money plus online and mobile banking facilities. There is no overdraft, so a child can't spend money they don't have.</p>",
  "<p>For the first eight months, I hid my pregnancy from my bosses, terrified it would spell the end of&#xa0;my career as a foreign correspondent. I simply didn't know any other women in the field with children. I flew to London for job interviews wearing loose-fitting clothes to hide my burgeoning bump. Being based in Malaysia for the BBC at the time made it a lot easier to keep secret from my employers, though I had to be careful about inhaling too much teargas in the weekly opposition street protests. Only when I was offered a role as a&#xa0;roving reporter in Europe did I&#xa0;come clean, since by then I was no longer legally allowed to fly.</p> <p>The reaction from colleagues was a little disturbing. One male journalist admitted he'd always assumed I couldn't have children because I'd left it so late (34 years). Female colleagues muttered in corridors, asking how I was going to&#xa0;manage such a demanding job and a child.</p> <p>I had indeed delayed getting pregnant because it seemed impossible to combine with foreign reporting, but a rebellious streak in me felt missing out on having children was too high a price to pay for an exciting career, and not fair on my husband.</p> <p>Two months after giving birth, I was posted as the BBC correspondent to Sri Lanka, which was in the midst of a vicious civil war. I'd seen my fair share of horror, poverty and bearded men with guns, but this time I found myself packing milk bottles and washable nappies as well as a&#xa0;flak jacket, helmet and first aid kit. It was the start of a&#xa0;double life as foreign correspondent and mother.</p> <p>We arrived in Sri Lanka in 2000, <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/980489.stm\" title=\"\">just after the BBC's local reporter in Jaffna had been killed in a&#xa0;grenade attack on his home</a> in a government-controlled town. It is a&#xa0;murder that remains unsolved, like many others in Sri Lanka over the decades. One of my first tasks was to work out what&#xa0;to do about his widow, still numb with shock,&#xa0;and her three young children. My baby grew into a toddler while my colleague's terrified family waited to escape abroad to start all over again on icy shores.</p> <p>Having just created life, it was strange to spend so much time dealing with death. As a mother, I&#xa0;found it harder to fathom the extraordinary cruelty otherwise gentle people are capable of in wars. At night in Sri Lanka, I would sit under the ceiling fan and rock my tiny baby to sleep in my arms, haunted by the stories I&#xa0;reported by day: tales of torture, mass graves and the agony of the missing fighters' mothers who never received a&#xa0;corpse to mourn. Both sides reeled out casualty statistics like cricket scores, forgetting the people they talked about were once someone's baby, loved and protected. It made it hard to get excited about the military hardware side of war \u2013 it didn't matter much if it was a T56 or AK-47 that did the killing. In&#xa0;the male-dominated world of foreign reporting I&#xa0;never admitted it, but motherhood did bring a&#xa0;new perspective to the story.</p> <p>The capital Colombo was full of soldiers and the talk on the streets was of suicide bombers, but it was an otherwise safe city where normal life continued in spite of the war in the distance. The violence was both random and targeted, but my baby was at home so unlikely to be caught up in a&#xa0;bombing on the streets \u2013 and in a targeted attack it would be me, not him, they'd be after.</p> <p>Because of my job, we had bomb film plastered over our windows lest someone lobbed a grenade over the walls. The BBC sent a retired MI6 officer to check my security arrangements. He placed video cameras on the gate and barbed wire around the perimeter, and hired round-the-clock guards. Only once did I feel worried for my son's safety, after strange people had been calling and lurking about the house at a tense time politically. To&#xa0;be on the safe side, my husband and I took him with us to a dinner that night, full of journalists and politicians. The media minister, who clearly thought me a&#xa0;pain, mellowed when he saw I was a mother.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398426920\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/24/1351083298584/Frances-Harrison-with-her-008.jpg\" alt=\"Frances Harrison with her son\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Frances and her son: 'Having just created life, it\u00a0was strange to spend so much time dealing with\u00a0death.' Photograph: Courtesy of Frances Harrison</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of Frances Harrison</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I set things up so my office was in the garden, and employed two nannies who took it in turns to be with my son for 24 hours at a time. It was a&#xa0;bizarre arrangement, but it gave them time to sort out their own lives and enabled me to be permanently on call. My bosses never discussed my unusual status as mother and correspondent. An obsession with equality made it impossible for them to know how to navigate such uncharted territory. Managers regularly asked me at very short notice to travel for weeks at a time; not once did it cross my mind to refuse, convinced that I'd never be asked again. I missed my son when I travelled, but the trips were exciting and I knew he was well looked after.</p> <p>When the rebels attacked the country's only international airport in 2001, I was on air almost solidly for three days. My child would cry when I&#xa0;dashed into the house to get something to eat, because I didn't have time to spend with him. But&#xa0;there were slack periods that compensated, and when I travelled abroad he would sweetly kiss the TV screen when he saw me on air.</p> <p>My husband was a roving correspondent for CNN then, often away, too, but we agreed one of us would always be with our child at night if the other was travelling, and we wouldn't take the same flight to war areas lest the plane be shot down. One parent was not ideal, but better than none.</p> <p>If my husband was already abroad and I was given an assignment, my son came with me. After 9/11, when he was one year old, I took him to India on an open-ended trip. When the call came from London, I'd just that day sacked the nanny. Somehow I found a replacement, got her a visa and left the next morning. In Delhi, the wives of colleagues generously invited my son to join their playgroup and kept an eye on the new nanny. The hotel filled our room with balloons and the chef made special meals that we mashed up in a small food processor, spreading a&#xa0;large sheet on the floor to protect the carpet. At one point my husband flew in from Iran, where he was reporting, just to babysit for a weekend so I could go off to Kashmir, which was not a place to take a child at that time. Three months of living in a hotel gave my son a&#xa0;lifelong fondness for room service; unable to talk, he learned to point at the telephone when hungry.</p> <p>Twice I took my child and nanny to Pakistan, where I worked for a month at a time. On the first trip, when he was 16 months old, we were put in a&#xa0;communal guesthouse the BBC had hired in Islamabad for the influx of reporters. Surprisingly, female colleagues seemed more uneasy than the men about the baby's presence. When a&#xa0;Pakistani reporter overheard women reporters and producers backbiting about how ridiculous it was that I travelled with my nanny and baby, he invited us to stay with his family instead.</p> <p>Occasionally, my husband and I did leave our son at home when big stories broke. In 2003, when an earthquake killed 30,000 people in Bam, southern Iran, we both ran out of the door to the airport, leaving the child in Sri Lanka with my stunned mother, who'd been visiting for Christmas.</p> <p>In 2004, when my son was four, I became the first female BBC bureau chief in Iran. He was very upset about leaving Colombo and in the month we spent in transit in London, refused to eat food that wasn't Sri Lankan. He felt he belonged there, and when strangers asked where he came from he&#xa0;would answer that his mum was English, his dad Iranian and he was Sri Lankan. We lured him to Tehran by promising skiing and snow \u2013 a thrill for any child brought up in the tropics.</p> <p>Being a woman reporter in Iran was difficult enough without being a mother. As a woman, you lived the discrimination every day. In the president's office, journalists were taken to the canteen for lunch while waiting for a press conference, but as the only woman I was escorted away to eat on my own on a different floor. The hardline Basij militia wouldn't allow me inside their bases. Lowly security officials at the Iranian foreign ministry delighted in ordering me to pull my headscarf tighter around my forehead.</p> <p>Some Iranian officials seemed to know childcare was my achilles heel. I had struggled to find any Iranian who'd work the hours I did, so eventually I brought our Sri Lankan nanny to Tehran, flying her home three times a year to keep her sane. After Ahmadinejad came to power, the Iranian immigration department abruptly decided not to renew her work permit. She was given a week to leave. The government said it would provide a&#xa0;nanny to live with us \u2013 or rather to spy on us. I&#xa0;made a huge fuss and somehow ensured her stay.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398426921\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/24/1351083541740/Frances-Harrison-with-her-008.jpg\" alt=\"Frances Harrison with her husband\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Frances Harrison with her husband.  Photograph: Mohsen Shandiz</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mohsen Shandiz</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The authorities in Tehran also refused to give my husband a press card to work as a journalist, even though he was originally Iranian. This put pressure on all of us. Children find it very hard to accept such unfairness. I told my worried son that the government didn't like Daddy because he told the truth. Then he quite logically asked why \"they\" didn't have a&#xa0;problem with me, too.</p> <p>There were of course people abroad \u2013 as well as in Iran \u2013 who didn't like the fact that the BBC had sent a woman to Tehran. A picture appeared on the internet of a woman with a noose round her neck that was supposed to be me. The accompanying article implied I was a traitor to Britain and claimed my husband routinely beat me up to make sure I&#xa0;reported stories favourable to the regime.</p> <p>I worried terribly about what would happen to my son if one of us was arrested. Being married to an Iranian, I had to work on an Iranian passport, which offered no consular protection. If I got into trouble, I wouldn't be deported; at the very least, I'd have my passport confiscated. One week, my son's swimming teacher told me the word on the grapevine was that I was in the notorious Evin jail after a particularly risqu\u00e9 story. On another occasion I was taken to a revolutionary court as the criminally accused in a libel case that had nothing to do with my reporting. I had sleepless nights imagining how my child would cope if I was found guilty and put in prison. In revolutionary Iran, any minor court case could quickly snowball out of control if it involved a foreigner. The judge wasn't reassuring; his first move was to ask me what religion I was. Later, after the disputed 2009 elections, it felt as if almost every journalist we'd ever interviewed ended up in prison or exile.</p> <p>In 2007, we returned to London, needing a dose of normal life. I looked for foreign postings that would work for my husband's career and our child. A BBC manager asked if I'd contemplated Kabul. When I said I needed a place with a good school for a seven-year-old, he told me I'd limited my options by having a family. So&#xa0;I&#xa0;left the corporation, did another degree and stumbled into <a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9781846274695\" title=\"\">writing books</a>.</p> <p>After me, a few more women correspondents have had children \u2013 one even as a single mother of two in Uzbekistan. But since the BBC appointed its first woman to the job in 1986, most have been unmarried and/or childless.</p> <p>Like any working mother, I feel perpetual guilt, always wondering if I have done my best for my child. Umpteen bedtime stories were abandoned as the phone rang with a breaking story. Quite a&#xa0;few holidays were cut short, and countless family lunches and outings cancelled because of a new development that London was getting excited about. Recently, a stream of refugee journalists from repressive regimes have eaten up my spare time, which my son sometimes feels should belong to him. When I explain their stories, he understands why I want to help them. These sacrifices are nothing compared with those of some people I've met through working.</p> <p>For me, what it means to be a good mother is defined by the women I interviewed for my book on the horrific end to the civil war in Sri Lanka. At the height of the fighting in 2009, hundreds of thousands of civilians were shelled and bombed while hiding in flimsy earthen ditches. Mothers used their bodies to protect children from the flying shards of deadly metal. Dying women gave their babies one last breastfeed, knowing they'd otherwise starve in a place where milk cost more than gold. And some discussed suicide together because they couldn't bear to be separated.</p> <p>One Tamil widow I met has a daughter the same age as my son. The child lost half her body weight in five months from starvation. Surviving against all odds, the mother crawled under barbed wire in the middle of the night with her children to escape an army detention camp, only to get lost in the jungle. She hid in different safe houses every night, dodged rebel informers and somehow reached the unlikely sanctuary of New Malden in south London, where she immediately settled down to prepare her eldest child for the 11-plus school entrance exam. By day it was verbal reasoning, but by night she would comfort her daughter when she woke up screaming because she feared she was back in the war zone. These brave, strong women put the trials of motherhood in perspective.</p> <p>\u2022 Frances Harrison's book, Still Counting The Dead: Survivors Of Sri Lanka's Hidden War, is published by Portobello Books at \u00a314.99.

  "<p>I sometimes wonder whether&#xa0;the creation story \u2013&#xa0;specifically the bit about forbidden fruit \u2013 has been handed down a bit wrong. Much as I love apples, which are undoubtedly the fruit I&#xa0;eat most often, it is their curvaceous cousin the pear \u2013 voluptuously shaped, scented and&#xa0;floral, dripping with ambrosial juices \u2013 that seems most completely to encapsulate the idea of fruity temptation. The pear is an utterly desirable thing: fragrant and complex in flavour, silky on the tongue, yet rich and bold enough to&#xa0;be blended with a whole bushel of different ingredients, sweet and savoury. Whether you're eating them straight from the fruit bowl or&#xa0;indulging in a little culinary experimentation, pears can be an&#xa0;absolute dream.</p> <p>They are not, however, straightforward. Pears are more tricky to grow successfully than apples \u2013 and even if they weren't, this year's terrible weather would have put even the most good-natured fruit tree into a sulk. Then, when you do get your hands on some of this shapely fruit, you have&#xa0;to watch it. Pears are almost always picked when under-ripe because, if&#xa0;left too long on the tree, they become woolly and tasteless. So it's the job of you, the pear consumer, to judge the point of perfect ripeness, at which your pear will yield beneath your teeth with just the right degree of barely-there resistance, releasing those honeyed juices upon your tongue. For an avid pear fan such as myself, this can mean a kind of fruit-bowl vigil, with almost hourly checks to see how the fruit respond to a gentle squeeze. Well, daily, certainly. Miss that window of opportunity, and your pear can very quickly let itself go, sinking into a mushy, vaguely musty-tasting over-ripeness. Hitting the pear jackpot is by no means certain.</p> <p>It's fortunate, then, that the slightly under-ripe pear is nevertheless an ingredient of great versatility \u2013 and even a slightly too&#xa0;soft one can be put to good use. Still-firm pears can be poached in wine with citrus zest, fried with butter and ginger, roasted with spices, even baked on a pizza (try&#xa0;them with kale, onions and blue cheese). Their texture is a positive boon in cooking, meaning they can&#xa0;spend a bit of time on the heat, absorbing other flavours, before they become too meltingly soft.</p> <p>The optimum pear for using raw in salads is, I would say, just a shade less ripe than the perfect pear for eating au naturel; a salad of pear, blue cheese and walnuts is a classic, but this aromatic fruit also blends beautifully with other cheeses, as&#xa0;well as with smoked fish, ham, bacon and other nuts. A pear that's too soft, meanwhile \u2013 so that you're a bit scared to pick it up for fear of a&#xa0;pear explosion \u2013 will be perfectly pur\u00e9e-able, and ideal for use in smoothies or as a sorbet base.</p> <p>The brown-flecked, elongated conference pear is by far the most familiar in the British Isles. It's relatively easy to grow, store and transport, which is partly why it outweighs all other pears in terms of&#xa0;what's available to buy. Growers also say this variety is simply what sells well: we seem to find conference a very approachable pear, and it has become so ubiquitous as to be almost a fruit category in its own right. There's nothing wrong with conference \u2013 it's a good, reliable fruit, whether you eat it raw or cook it \u2013 but there are other, more floral, fragrant and interesting pear delights to be had. Doyenne du comice is a voluptuous, fat-bottomed fruit with a lovely, complex flavour, best served raw, that can be found fairly widely; and the perfumed williams is also no stranger to the shop shelves; concorde (originally the lovechild of a conference and comice) is another delicious fruit. There are many other excellent pear varieties \u2013 such as the perfumed, silky beurre hardy, the sweet durondeau, and the aromatic, rosy-red Louise Bonne of Jersey - but it is hard to find them, certainly in supermarkets or on the high street. Seek out, if you can, a traditional orchard \u2013 many now bring their fruit to farmers' markets \u2013 and see what's on offer. You might even catch some other treats, such as quince or medlars or fresh walnuts, too. The orchard gazetteer at <a href=\"http://www.england-in-particular.info/\" title=\"\">england-in-particular.info</a> is a&#xa0;good place to start looking.</p> <p>When buying, you should expect a pear to be firm \u2013 although not rock hard, which may mean it was picked way too early and will never ripen properly. If the fruit gives just a little when gently pressed at the stalk end, that suggests it's approaching ripeness and should be good for raw consumption within a few days. But you don't want it to be soft or wrinkled around the stalk, even if the bulb is still firm, because this is often a sign of dehydration. At home, bring your pears on to tenderness by simply leaving them at cool room temperature, but to speed up the process, snuggle them next to a couple of ripe bananas, which produce lots of ethylene, a fruit-ripening gas. To slow them down, keep them in the fridge. Good luck with your vigil \u2013 and may you hit many pears at their peak this season.</p> <h2>Pear and frangipane tart</h2> <p>This rough-edged tart is incredibly easy to make. It also works well with apples. Serves eight to 10.</p> <p>For the pastry<br><strong>250g plain flour</strong><br><strong>125g cold unsalted butter, cut into&#xa0;small cubes</strong><br><strong>50g caster sugar</strong><br><strong>Pinch of salt</strong><br><strong>A pinch of ground cinnamon (optional)</strong></p> <p>For the pears<br><strong>4 barely-ripe pears </strong><br><strong>2 tablespoons soft brown sugar</strong><br><strong>50g butter</strong><br><strong>1 tbsp demerara sugar</strong><br><strong>1 tbsp flaked almonds</strong></p> <p>For the frangipane<br><strong>75g soft butter </strong><br><strong>75g caster sugar </strong><br><strong>1 large egg, lightly beaten</strong><br><strong>20g plain flour </strong><br><strong>75g ground almonds</strong><br><strong>A dash of vanilla extract</strong></p> <p>First make the pastry. Put the flour in a bowl, add the butter and rub in&#xa0;with your fingertips until the mixture resembles fine breadcrumbs (or do this in a food processor). Stir&#xa0;in the sugar, salt and cinnamon, if using, and add enough cold water to bring the mix together into a medium-firm dough that is not too sticky (you'll probably need 50ml or&#xa0;thereabouts). On a floured surface, shape the dough into a&#xa0;round, wrap in clingfilm and chill in&#xa0;the fridge for 30 minutes.</p> <p>Heat the oven to 200C/400F/gas mark 6 and grease a large baking tray or line it with baking parchment.</p> <p>Peel, quarter and core the pears, then cut each quarter into two. Heat&#xa0;the butter and sugar in a pan and, when bubbling, add the pears. Cook gently over a medium heat for&#xa0;a few minutes, until the pears are&#xa0;just tender and you have a&#xa0;bubbling toffee sauce. Drain the pears in a sieve, retaining all the sauce. Cool the sauce in the fridge for later.</p> <p>For the frangipane mixture, cream&#xa0;the butter and sugar together until fluffy. Add the egg, flour, almonds and vanilla, and beat well.</p> <p>Roll out the pastry to a large, rough-edged circle no thinner than 4mm and place on the tray. Spread the frangipane over the pastry, leaving a 2cm border clear around the edge. Arrange the cooked pears on top, then sprinkle with the demerara sugar and flaked almonds.</p> <p>Bake for 20 minutes, until the pastry is golden brown at the edges. Allow the tart to cool for 10-15 minutes, then serve trickled with a&#xa0;little of the reserved toffee sauce, with some cream or ice-cream.</p> <h2>Smoked mackerel and pear salad</h2> <p>I love pears in salads with salty cheeses: this is a slightly different but very delicious take on the sweet-salty-bitter idea. Serves two as a&#xa0;main course, four as a starter.</p> <p><strong>2 just-ripe pears</strong><br><strong>About 75g (2-3 good handfuls) bitter or peppery leaves such as chicory leaves and/or rocket</strong><br><strong>150g smoked mackerel fillets</strong><br><strong>Lemon juice</strong><br><strong>Sea salt and freshly ground black&#xa0;pepper</strong></p> <p>For the dressing<br><strong>1 heaped tsp grainy mustard</strong><br><strong>1 tsp clear honey</strong><br><strong>1 tbsp lemon juice</strong><br><strong>3 tbsp olive oil</strong></p> <p>Whisk together all the dressing ingredients with a little salt and pepper until emulsified. Put about half the dressing in a bowl. Peel, quarter and core the pears, then cut each quarter in half lengthways, so you end up with eight slender pieces from each pear. Toss these in the dressing bowl to prevent browning.</p> <p>Arrange the leaves over one large serving platter, or individual plates. Arrange the pieces of dressed pear over the top. Take the smoked mackerel off its skin, break the fish into large chunks with your fingers, and scatter over the pears. Trickle over some of the remaining dressing (you may not need every drop), give&#xa0;the whole salad another squeeze of&#xa0;lemon juice and a final grinding of&#xa0;black pepper, and it's ready to serve. Fresh brown bread is&#xa0;a&#xa0;lovely&#xa0;accompaniment.</p> <h2>Pears poached with cider and bay</h2> <p>This simple and elegant autumn dessert is a good one to make in advance. Serves four.</p> <p><strong>4 pears</strong><br><strong>75g caster sugar</strong><br><strong>2-3 strips lemon zest</strong><br><strong>4-5 bay leaves, torn in half</strong><br><strong>300ml dry cider</strong></p> <p>Peel the pears, but leave them intact. Put them in a saucepan into&#xa0;which they will fit fairly snugly in one layer. Add the sugar, lemon zest and bay leaves. Pour over the cider, then add enough water just to&#xa0;cover the pears. Bring to a simmer, cover and simmer until the pears are tender \u2013 the time this takes can vary greatly depending on the ripeness of the pears; it could be five minutes for ripe pears, or 25 for very firm ones, so keep checking them with the tip of a small, sharp knife.</p> <p>When the pears are done, remove them from the pan with a slotted spoon and place in a dish. Turn up the heat under the liquor in the pan. Boil it down until is reduced by at least half and tastes sweet and intense. Pour the reduced liquor over the pears in their dish, leave to cool completely, then chill.</p> <p>Before serving, spoon the juice in&#xa0;the dish back over the chilled pears. They're very good just as they&#xa0;come, but a spoonful of cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche is a&#xa0;lovely enrichment.</p> <h2>Pear and nut smoothie</h2> <p>The perfect use for a pear that's been left in the fruit bowl to the point where it's about to pass into over-ripeness. The spoonful of&#xa0;nut butter makes this a smoothie that will really set you up for the day. Serves one.</p> <p><strong>1 ripe pear</strong><br><strong>2-3 tbsp plain, wholemilk yogurt</strong><br><strong>1 tbsp smooth nut butter</strong><br><strong>Pinch of ground cinnamon (optional)</strong></p> <p>Peel, quarter and core the pear. Put it in a blender with the yoghurt and nut butter \u2013 and the cinnamon, if you fancy it \u2013 and blend until smooth. Serve straight away. <a href=\"http://www.rivercottage.net\" title=\"\">rivercottage.net</a></p>",
  "<p>The palate cleanser is an integral element of many haute cuisine experiences: a sorbet, fresh herbs or a simple glass of water are just a few methods of refreshing the mouth, enlivening the tastebuds and preparing the tongue for flavours to come.</p> <p>Unless, of course, you are Heston Blumenthal. In what may be the restless innovator's most extreme experiment yet, Blumenthal has taken to using a tampon to soak up the juices in his mouth.</p> <p>\"If you drain the moisture in your mouth you experience richness, creaminess and sweetness more intensely ... and there is really nothing much more absorbent than a tampon.\"</p> <p>But Blumenthal disciples may be disappointed to hear that yoghurt with tampons \u2013 the chef's current lunch of choice according to his food diary in today's Weekend magazine \u2013 will not be found on the menu of the Fat Duck, his restaurant in Bray, or Dinner, in central London, any time soon.</p> <p>\"There is no way I am thinking of serving tampons to people in a restaurant,\" he insisted, speaking from a field in north Wales where he is filming a new television series, Heston's Fantastical Food. \"It's about understanding more about how we perceive taste and flavour.\"</p> <p>Blumenthal is not taking credit for the innovation, which he was introduced to at a food research centre in Wageningen, the Netherlands, by oral physiologist Don Prince. \"Don is the equivalent of me in the physiology department: he's brilliant but barking mad and although I think he surpassed himself this time, it was not uncharacteristic.\"</p> <p>Before long the pair were \"playing around with different tampons\", he explained. \"You sit there and it grows and sucks the moisture out and just gets quite wet, swollen and woolly. Although it is quite funny sitting there with the little string coming out of your mouth.\"</p> <p>The impact on the tastebuds is immediate: \"If you have a spoonful of ice-cream then put a tampon on the tongue for a couple of minutes, when you eat the ice-cream again the taste will be richer. It's certainly not something I would do for culinary enjoyment purposes, but it's an interesting way to explore the taste receptors in our mouth.\"</p> <p>But is tampon tasting not a little outr\u00e9 even for a man who gave the world chicken curry ice-cream and snail porridge? \"I don't really look at it like that,\" he said. \"I can see why people might think it's a bit weird to put a tampon in your mouth, but if it's unused it is just a really absorbent material.\"</p>",
  "<h2><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/hestonblumenthal\" title=\"\">Heston Blumenthal</a></h2> <p>It can be quite difficult to control what you eat when your schedule is&#xa0;all over the place. I tend to make small allowances when I can \u2013 for instance, cutting down on carbs by taking one layer of bread off a&#xa0;sandwich. I also exercise every day, even if it's just a short run. I'm tasting and developing dishes all the&#xa0;time \u2013 we can have around 500 dishes in development at any one time between <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/the-fat-duck\" title=\"\">the Fat Duck</a>, <a href=\"http://www.dinnerbyheston.com/\" title=\"\">Dinner</a>, Waitrose and <a href=\"http://www.hindsheadbray.com/\" title=\"\">the two</a> <a href=\"http://www.thecrownatbray.com/\" title=\"\">pubs</a>, and that's not including the food for the TV work, so when I'm not filming, I'm kind of constantly eating/tasting. This has been an interesting exercise, though \u2013 I've never really analysed what I eat or drink. I guess I need to organise breakfast better, and I'm quite famous for drinking my body weight in Earl Grey tea, but&#xa0;the rest is just madness.</p> <p><strong>Sunday</strong></p> <p><strong>Breakfast </strong>Filming this morning, so&#xa0;just had a quick Earl Grey tea.</p> <p><strong>Lunch </strong>Tuna sandwich\u2026 from a&#xa0;shop&#xa0;somewhere.</p> <p><strong>Dinner</strong> Sunday lunch \u2013 well, kind of lunch/dinner by the time I got home. I think it was about 8.30pm, so that makes it officially Sunday dinner. A roast, of course! Dorset lamb this week. I always try to have a Sunday joint with all the trimmings \u2013 it's one of my favourite meals of the week.</p> <p><strong>Monday</strong></p> <p><strong>Breakfast </strong>Early morning phone interview with Australia and a cup&#xa0;of tea (Earl Grey with skimmed&#xa0;milk).</p> <p><strong>Lunch </strong>Lunch?

Had bacon butties to start the day off, cooked in the engine of a&#xa0;steam train \u2013 why&#xa0;not?</p> <p><strong>Lunch </strong>Lunch was a bigger affair, but&#xa0;at least had packed my lunchbox. Grabbed some veg from the catering van, too.</p> <p><strong>Dinner </strong>Popped into the amazing <a href=\"http://www.zumarestaurant.com/zuma-landing/london/en/welcome\" title=\"\">Zuma</a> with my youngest, Joy,&#xa0;for her birthday. We were too full for dessert, so they just sent a little something.</p> <p><strong>Wednesday</strong></p> <p><strong>Breakfast </strong>Waitrose tasting for new hot cross buns for next Easter \u2013 Earl Grey jasmine tea and orange-flower water versus ginger and acacia honey. May sound nice, but had to taste brussels sprout leaves&#xa0;cooked in different ways at the same time.</p> <p><strong>Lunch </strong>Lunch at the lab: yoghurt and tampons. We were testing the effect of certain foods and how they coat the palate for an interactive presentation. The tampon dries the saliva out between spoonfuls, so you can identify how the tongue perceives flavour. It did work, but I&#xa0;wonder how it will go down.&#xa0;</p> <p><strong>Snack </strong>Everything is getting bigger for the new programme. We supersize everything, and cook and eat it with different communities throughout the UK. Things like afternoon tea and old sweets. Not sure where the huge whisky gum came from, but I think I know someone at the lab who knows.</p> <p><strong>Tea </strong>We have a lab grade centrifuge, a&#xa0;distillator, a rotary evaporator, vacuum centrifuge, vac packs, water baths\u2026 But no bloody kettle. A very complex cup of tea.</p> <p><strong>Dinner </strong>After a full day in Bray and a&#xa0;brainstorm meeting that overran, ended up in the garden of <a href=\"http://www.thecrownatbray.com/\" title=\"\">the Crown</a> for fish and chips \u2013 took the opportunity as a rare warm evening.</p> <p><strong>Thursday</strong></p> <p><strong>Breakfast </strong>Book signing back in office \u2013 finally a decent cup of tea, ahhh, found teapot.</p> <p><strong>Lunch </strong>Spent most of the day at <a href=\"http://www.dinnerbyheston.com/\" title=\"\">Dinner</a>. Meeting with <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/2011/jan/23/heston-blumenthal-palmer-watts-interview\" title=\"\">Ash</a> to discuss a new project \u2013 a historic British food book \u2013 and trying to get a&#xa0;modern \"<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/2010/dec/02/heston-blumenthal-christmas-canapes-meat\" title=\"\">meat fruit</a>\" shot to contrast with the historic image. Lunch was a tasting of new dishes: new terrine, autumn tart and sambonade \u2013 a goat's cheese cheesecake with elderflower and a&#xa0;secret centre.</p> <p><strong>Dinner </strong>Stayed and had dinner with a&#xa0;couple of friends \u2013 obviously had a&#xa0;meat fruit. We're serving around 1,000 of them a week now!</p> <p><strong>Friday</strong></p> <p><strong>Breakfast </strong>None at home because I&#xa0;was running late, but I had tea and breakfast canap\u00e9s at the launch of a&#xa0;new <a href=\"http://www.visionexpress.com/news/0042//\" title=\"\">Vision Express</a> shop on Oxford Street \u2013 loads of bites, so breakfast in stages.</p> <p><strong>Lunch </strong>Vision Express sushi before cutting the ribbon for the official store opening. I met another great spectacle-wearing geek, <a href=\"http://gadgetshow.channel5.com/profiles/Jason_Bradbury\" title=\"\">Jason Bradbury</a>, there from The Gadget Show, so had a lot to talk about.</p> <p><strong>Dinner </strong>Roast chicken at a friend's \u2013 it's the biggest joy when someone asks you to their home and cooks for you, but my mates always joke that it's such a stress. I think it's the other way round when they come to mine \u2013 it's not as if I can just cook up a steak. People are expecting to eat the cutlery at the very least.</p> <p><strong>Saturday</strong></p> <p><strong>Breakfast </strong>A quick tea and pastry on the way&#xa0;to the lab \u2013 more Earl Grey.</p> <p><strong>Lunch </strong>Tasting two new dishes for the Duck. Nowhere near finished, but one will end up on the menu for Christmas as a kind of \"partridge in a pear tree\" \u2013 partridge cooked in butter at a low temperature to relax the meat, served on the breastbone with brandy butter, and chestnut and pine and mandarin (basically all the aromas and flavours we associate with Christmas). We're also looking at the leathering process from the 1800s for a turbot dish \u2013 tanning agents in early 1800s Britain were sumac, oak and mimosa bark, so we use all three. The drainage from the tanneries heated up the land, and we grew pineapples and melons on it, so we serve the fish with savoury melon and purple carrot. Oh, and frankincense and crystalised sea veg \u2013 we make our own leather from the fish skin, which you don't eat, but which will be part of the cutlery for the texture and smell. Easy, really, to balance all that?!</p> <p><strong>Dinner </strong>Working late in Bray after tasting, so had a beer and some of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/2012/sep/28/staff-meals-worlds-best-restaurants\" title=\"\">head chef Jonny Lake's</a> nachos with the boys after service.</p> <p><strong>\u2022 </strong>Heston's Fantastical Food starts on 6 November at 9pm on Channel 4.</p> <p></p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/nigellalawson\" title=\"\"><strong>Nigella Lawson</strong></a></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398955393\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/26/1351246121301/Nigella-Lawson-009.jpg\" alt=\"Nigella Lawson\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nigella Lawson.

Straight after breakfast, made batch of coffee ice-cream and chocolate nougat cookies to take to curry favour with various radio and TV interviews that I have lined up for day.</p> <p><strong>Lunch </strong>I am not good when I miss meals; being hungry makes me both murderous and suicidal. So didn't feel good that I didn't manage to get back for lunch until about 4.30pm and had to leave house for the next thingy at 5pm, so all I had time for was some rye toast with hummus and coriander on top, and a far too small portion at that.</p> <p><strong>Supper </strong>Roast chicken \u2013 I have all the bits with cartilage and skin, by choice, while pretending to make great sacrifices so that the children can eat the white meat \u2013 on escarole (my favourite lettuce) dressed just with Maldon, <a href=\"http://www.farrington-oils.co.uk/products/mellow-yellow/\" title=\"\">Mellow Yellow cold-pressed rapeseed oil</a>, lemon and lots of English mustard.</p> <p><strong>Tuesday</strong></p> <p><strong>Breakfast </strong>Made an egg and bacon sandwich for one of the children, but then ran too late to have breakfast myself. Not a good start to the day, made worse by the fact that I was going to a photographic shoot, which always makes me nervy.</p> <p><strong>Lunch </strong>Made up for lack of breakfast by eating huge amounts of rotisserie chicken, char-grilled corn and crinkly chips from <a href=\"http://www.chickenshop.com/\" title=\"\">Chicken Shop</a> in Kentish Town. Don't blame them for the poor display: I had a takeaway and didn't present the food (such was my quaking hunger) to its best advantage. From this point onwards, my life started looking up.</p> <p><strong>Supper </strong>By special request, made risi e bisi, a Venetian recipe (think a soupy pea risotto) that's a favourite in my home. I am always grateful when this is what I'm asked to cook, because it's quick and easy, and as comforting for the cook as the eater.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398955394\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/24/1351101106395/Food-diaries-Nigella-008.jpg\" alt=\"Food diaries Nigella\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nigella Lawson: 'I am not good when I miss meals; being hungry makes me both murderous and\u00a0suicidal.'

I feel a real traitor to&#xa0;my country choosing Vegemite over Marmite, but there it is.</p> <p><strong>Lunch </strong>Since this is a day of interviews, and the meagre toast with Vegemite is wearing off to the point of panic, I order a steak and chips. True, there are only four chips on the plate (though I must tell you they were much bigger and hunkier than they look), but they've been generous with the b\u00e9arnaise sauce, and I also have a tube of <a href=\"http://www.colmans.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Colman's</a> in&#xa0;my bag, so I manage to get through the afternoon.</p> <p><strong>Supper </strong>By request, again, I make another of my children's favourites \u2013 penne with ham, peas and cream.</p> <p><strong>Thursday </strong></p> <p><strong>Breakfast</strong> The usual rye toast and egg \u2013 and an awful lot of tea. In fact, I can never actually eat breakfast before I've had my two mugs of tea.</p> <p><strong>Lunch </strong>Have a meeting at home over lunch, so roast a butterflied leg of lamb, along with a tin of sliced pink fir apple potatoes, yellow courgettes, cherry tomatoes, leeks and black olives. There is no particular design to this vegetable mixture: I was just giving my fridge a bit of a going through, and bunged everything that needed to be used up into a roasting tin.</p> <p><strong>Supper </strong>Although I complied with children's wishes, making them burgers (not homemade, I must own up, but <a href=\"http://www.waitrose.com/shop/ProductView-10317-10001-134075-Heston+from+Waitrose+2+Ultimate+Beef+Burgers\" title=\"\">Heston's from Waitrose</a>) with plastic cheese, potatoes cut somewhere between wedges and chips, roasted with garlic cloves and pancetta cubes, and a rather 1970s-looking salad, I needed the simple salve of an avocado, eaten with nothing more than a spritz of lemon and a snowy throw of salt.</p> <p>I did succumb to some <a href=\"http://www.boojabooja.com/chocolate_truffles.asp\" title=\"\">Booja-Booja champagne truffles</a> later, but I never feel bad about that.</p> <p><strong>Friday</strong></p> <p><strong>Breakfast </strong>Smoked salmon, coarsely ground white pepper, lemon juice and lots of dill \u2013 for me, the best way to eat it. I am very fussy about the smoked salmon, though; it must be London-cure, which is so lusciously mild that it's more like eating wafer-thin sashimi than anything else. I&#xa0;get mine, as my grandmother did before me, from <a href=\"http://www.panzers.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Panzer's in St John's Wood</a>, despite the schlepp.</p> <p><strong>Lunch </strong>A frantic day, and much as I&#xa0;like having proper meals and not grabbed snacks, lunch today is a&#xa0;toasted sandwich. Still, it's a very good toastie, buttery-crisp on the outside, lined with ham as thin and tender and pink as a kitten's tongue, and gooey with jarlsberg.</p> <p><strong>Supper </strong>Going to see Michael McIntyre at the O2, so supper has to be a picnic on the way there. I&#xa0;have an old picnic box I bought on eBay, and make a few batches of rice noodle and prawn salad, with beansprouts, sugar snaps and a lot of ginger, chilli and soy to go inside it. Friends we're going with a supply of champagne and, given that I can get drunk on one glass, I am reeling by the time I get home. Fantastic night, though, topped off by a buttered, toasted bagel on my return, followed by crisps and chocolate.</p> <p><strong>Saturday</strong></p> <p><strong>Breakfast </strong>Get up too late for breakfast, but manage a good lunch-after-the-night-before (and pre-opening snoop) at <a href=\"http://www.colbertchelsea.com/\" title=\"\">Colbert</a> of fried eggs with black pudding and cr\u00eapes with lemon and sugar.</p> <p><strong>Supper </strong>I live very near <a href=\"http://www.thechelseafishmonger.com/\" title=\"\">the Chelsea Fishmonger</a> and generally throw myself at Rex, the fishmonger, and get myself comfortingly overstocked for the weekend. Tonight's supper is part of this catch: halibut, juicily roasted and plonked on top of some treviso leaves, with broccoli cooked with garlic oil, anchovies, chilli and dry white vermouth. This is what I use whenever I want white wine taste, but without having to open a bottle. I know it sounds odd, but unless we're having friends over, it never occurs to me to open a&#xa0;bottle of wine.</p> <p><strong>Sunday</strong></p> <p><strong>Breakfast </strong>Up too late for breakfast, but I do manage a supersized cappuccino in bed with the papers.</p> <p><strong>Lunch </strong>Tuna tartare with capers, lemon zest, spring onions and rocket: this takes about three minutes to make and is a virtuous reward for the lazy and greedy.</p> <p><strong>Supper </strong>Ever since the children have been teenagers, the ritual of Sunday lunch has been shunted on to Sunday supper. Tonight, we're having pork belly slices \u2013 think melting meat and triumphant, bronze crackling \u2013 with soy and cumin gravy, mashed potato and broccoli. I've been experimenting with some mini versions of my cappuccino pavlova and have some bases left, as well as some coffee ice-cream from Monday, so do a housekeeping job of getting rid of the two together (that's my excuse), anointed with a sticky, gleaming drizzle of Golden Syrup which, along with Maldon and Colman's, constitute the holy trinity of&#xa0;Great British Foodstuffs.</p> <p>\u2022 Nigella Lawson's new book, Nigellissima: Instant Italian Inspiration, is published by Chatto &amp; Windus at \u00a326.

Lunch is a big variable \u2013 weekdays, if I'm writing, I'll just grab a bowl of soup or knock up a salad, but more often than not I'll be recipe testing or out tasting for the businesses I&#xa0;consult for, so don't want a proper lunch. Suppers, too, have no real pattern \u2013 I'm generally out no more than twice a week, and at home it's usually based around what's about to go off in the fridge.</p> <p><strong>Saturday</strong></p> <p><strong>Breakfast </strong>Bacon and pineapple butties \u2013 must be a Saturday!</p> <p><strong>Lunch </strong>Friends over. Stunning bit of plaice, and probably the last time I&#xa0;do peas and lettuce this year \u2013 definitely a sunshine dish. And an emergency pud \u2013 vanilla sponge stolen from a friend with a quick plum compote and pistachios.</p> <p><strong>Dinner </strong>My sister and her kids came round for supper, so we had the first big beefy braise of the winter.</p> <p><strong>Sunday</strong></p> <p><strong>Breakfast </strong>Some days I have eggs, others muesli.

Didn't have a&#xa0;sit-down lunch because of that: shared a PPP \u2013 potato pesto pizza \u2013 with the girls for lunch, then more baking with raspberry jam tarts. Had a&#xa0;proper madeleine moment when I ate one later \u2013 hadn't had a&#xa0;jam tart for years and I&#xa0;came over a bit emotional.

  "<p>One of the functions of fiction is to serve as a kind of tourism, either showing us places, situations and people that we might not otherwise reach or scrolling through snapshots of events or sensations that we remember. Crime stories rarely serve the latter purpose \u2013 most admirers of homicide novels will, thankfully, never become or even know a murder victim \u2013 but are a perfect illustration of the former.</p> <p>Throughout its history, crime literature has operated as a sort of imaginative travel agency, taking customers across borders and introducing them to unknown cultures. The story commonly considered the birth of the whodunit \u2013 <a href=\"http://classiclit.about.com/library/bl-etexts/eapoe/bl-eapoe-murders.htm\" title=\"\">Edgar Allan Poe's \"The Murders in the Rue Morgue\" (1841)</a> \u2013 was written by an American and set in Paris. Since then, the genre has regularly been a ticket for a Grand Tour.</p> <p>Agatha Christie, an enthusiastic globe-trotter through her wealth and marriage to an archaeologist, sent <a href=\"http://www.poirot.us/poirot.php\" title=\"\">Hercule Poirot </a>on the Orient Express, Nile cruises and aeroplane journeys, depicting trips that the majority of her audience was unlikely ever to experience for real. Later in the 20th century, readers, listeners and viewers of detective tales learned about France from <a href=\"http://www.trussel.com/f_maig.htm\" title=\"\">Simenon's Maigret </a>and the Netherlands through <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/2003/jul/22/guardianobituaries.booksobituaries\" title=\"\">Nicolas Freeling's Commissaris Van der Valk</a>, who achieved the rare double of topping both the TV ratings lists (in the ITV series starring Barry Foster) and the pop charts, with the <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_ZSaxF63Gs\" title=\"\">Simon Park Orchestra's recording of the theme tune, \"Eye Level\"</a>.</p> <p>And, these days, Britons have a greater understanding of Scandinavian culture than ever before: not from exports such as Abba, Bjorn Borg, Volvo or Ikea, but through what was \u2013 at least until the recent apothesois of sado-masochistic soft porn \u2013 the biggest publishing phenomenon of the 21st century: the super-selling mystery stories of writers from Sweden (Stieg Larsson, Henning Mankell) and Norway (Jo Nesb\u00f8).</p> <p>Retracing these journeys, I have made a 15-part series for BBC Radio 4, <em>Foreign Bodies</em>, which uses celebrated fictional detectives \u2013 from Christie's Poirot to <a href=\"http://www.jonesbo.co.uk/meetharryhole.asp\" title=\"\">Nesb\u00f8's Harry Hole</a> \u2013 to explore the history of modern Europe. Cop novels are a useful tool for such a survey because the police procedural turns on detail. Novelists working in crime-free narratives have no need (and often no wish) to specify a character's job, clothes, income or family background. But because observation and evidence are crucial to the investigation of a crime \u2013 the motive for which will often rest on who someone was or what they possessed or desired \u2013 crime writers routinely provide a mass of social detail: menus, train timetables, fashion labels, shops, newspaper stories. As a result, good crime novels become a case-file of their times. The introduction of the welfare system and unemployment benefit, for example, can be traced through the comments of posh employers in Christie's mysteries. And reporters preparing to cover the impending referendum on Scottish independence would be well advised to read <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2012/jun/06/rebus-back-reveals-ian-rankin\" title=\"\">Ian Rankin's DCI Rebus</a> books, which systematically depict the country's re-examination of its identity over the last 25 years, with one book \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/data/book/crime/9780752883632/set-in-darkness\" title=\"\"><em>Set in Darkness </em>(2000)</a> \u2013 even involving the discovery of a corpse in the foundations of the Scottish parliament building.</p> <p>In the same way, future historians considering why Sweden holds the improbable distinction of being the only western democracy to have both its prime minister and foreign minister assassinated in modern times \u2013 or why a racist gunman killed 77 people in Norway in 2011 \u2013 will find clues to the forces behind those events in crime novels written at least a decade earlier.</p> <p>Crime fiction is a magnifying glass that frequently reveals the fingerprints of history before they become visible to politicans or journalists. And \u2013 as in a forensic investigation \u2013 separate pieces of evidence can begin to reveal patterns.</p> <p>On <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/crimewatch/\" title=\"\"><em>Crimewatch UK</em></a>, during the update section just after the news in which the detectives discuss calls that have come in from the public, lead investigators will often comment, with a note of satisfaction, that \"certain names have come up several times already\". Weight of recognition, cross-referencing of mentions, is frequently a crucial clue in detection. And, in a more benevolent sense, it was striking how, while following the trail of crime novels written from before the second world war to the present day, the same names \u2013 of influential authors and characters \u2013 kept cropping up.</p> <p>As keen readers in the field might guess, the undisputed godfathers of the genre remain Sir Arthur Conan Doyle (1859-1930) and Sherlock Holmes, who lived in print from 1887 to 1923, although he carries on immortally in all entertainment forms. So long and so strong is the shadow of Holmes that anyone subsequently creating a detective in any culture has had to make a deliberate gesture of homage or avoidance to the resident of 221B Baker Street.</p> <p>For example, it is my strong suspicion that the reason Hercule Poirot (print-dates 1920-75) is Belgian is that, if Christie (1890-1976) had made him English, the detective's characteristics \u2013 intuitive, aloof, fastidious about couture and cuisine \u2013 would have made him too transparently a Holmes clone. The most dramatised detective after Holmes and Poirot, Commissaire Jules Maigret (1931-72), is again distanced from the template by his Parisian location, but he too has certain Holmesian aspects (hyper-intelligence, a pipe) that feel like deliberate nods from his creator, the officially Belgian but temperamentally French Georges Simenon (1903-89).</p> <p>With remarkable consistency across generations and nations, Holmes is the genre's homepage.

However, because Conan Doyle is to some extent an invisible author \u2013 most of the Holmes stories employ the voice of Dr Watson and take the form of his report on the case \u2013 he is not the author with most influence on prose tone and structure. In that respect, my inquiries revealed, the biggest influence in European crime fiction is Simenon.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398921185\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Admin/BkFill/Default_image_group/2012/10/25/1351182813735/Inspector-Montalbano-008.jpg\" alt=\"Inspector Montalbano\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Andrea Camilleri's Inspector Montalbano (played by Luca Zingaretti in the TV series) questions what it means to be a good policeman.

In Berlin, one of the leading German crime-writers, Jakob Arjouni, also kept a complete Simenon close to his desk. PD James cites Simenon as a master as well, confirming a literary afterlife that perhaps validates the view of Andr\u00e9 Gide that the Belgian writer should have won the Nobel prize for literature.</p> <p>This strong sense of tradition and succession in crime fiction was underlined by the almost universal tendency of leading crime novelists to acknowledge predecessors as inspirations. For example, Mankell admitted that his <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2012/jul/23/wallander-cant-get-enough\" title=\"\">Kurt Wallander</a> \u2013 a melancholy Swedish policeman whose cases expose changes in Scandinavian society \u2013 could never have existed without the example of Martin Beck, a depressive, historically sensitive cop who featured in the novels of a married couple of former journalists, Maj Sj\u00f6wall and Per Wahl\u00f6\u00f6, whose 10 Beck books published between 1965 and 1975 are being dramatised by Radio 4 as part of this exploration of European crime fiction. Nesb\u00f8 argues that Beck is the source of the now dominant wave of Scandinavian crime stories: a Nordic Holmes.</p> <p>In describing the main remit of my inquiry as postwar crime fiction, I meant the second world war. And the conflict of 1939-45 has an understandably large presence in books written from the differing perspectives of Britain, France, Holland, Germany and Italy. More surprising, though, was the dawning realisation that even books set beyond the reach of that period seemed to have a significant relation with some other military standoff, as if postwar wounds were a natural driving force of the murder novel.</p> <p>The Vietnam war stalks the Martin Beck sequence: his creators met at a protest march against US involvement in south-east Asia. There are long echoes of that radicalising issue in Nesb\u00f8's novels as well. Meanwhile, through his books about the best man in the Prague Homicide Bureau, \u0160kvoreck\u00fd animates two key eastern European experiences of the cold war: occupation and exile. <em>The Mournful Demeanour of Lieutenant Boruvka</em>, written in 1966 in Prague under censorship from the Russian-backed puppet government, can only express dissidence through code and nudges. But, after the author gained asylum in Canada following the Soviet invasion of 1968, <em>The End of Lieutenant Boruvka</em> (1975) and <em>The Return of Lieutenant Boruvka</em> (1980) provide a compelling account of the moral horror and bureaucratic comedy of life under communism.</p> <p>In a similar way, <a href=\"http://www.fantasticfiction.co.uk/a/jakob-arjouni/\" title=\"\">Arjouni's</a> character of Kemal Kayankaya \u2013 a private eye born in Germany to a Turkish immigrant family \u2013 explores the consequences for Europe of the collapse of the Soviet empire, the wars in the former Yugoslavia and the reunification of Germany. From <em>Happy Birthday, Turk!</em> (1980) to <em>Brother Kemal</em> (to be published in English in 2013), in which Kayankaya is hired to protect a writer who has offended Islamist groups, Arjouni uses crimes to explore issues \u2013 of immigration, nationalism and religious sensitivity \u2013 that dominate contemporary European politics.</p> <p>In the work of Spain's foremost author in the form \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/2003/oct/21/guardianobituaries.booksobituaries1\" title=\"\">Manuel V\u00e1zquez Montalb\u00e1n</a> (1939-2003) \u2013 the conflict that underlies the writing is the Spanish civil war, or, at least, the dictatorship of General Franco that followed and the subsequent transition to a constitutional monarchy, with King Juan Carlos I as a rare example of a monarch as a post-revolutionary figure. Montalb\u00e1n (after whom Camilleri's Inspector Montalbano is named in homage) employs his Barcelona private eye, Pepe Carvalho, to interrogate this complex political situation. Montalb\u00e1n's work is an exemplar of how crime novels can be used to analyse shifts in society: <em>An Olympic Death</em>, published just after the 1992 Barcelona games, makes fascinating reading in a London also struggling with the cost and legacy of hosting the event.</p> <p>Inevitably, though, it is scar tissue from the great global battles of the 20th century that runs through European crime fiction. Both Maigret and Poirot are war veterans: David Suchet laments that the limp from the Belgian's wound is the only characteristic he has failed to incorporate in his ITV portrayal. In the Van der Valk stories, on both page and screen, it was common for the solution to lie in whether victims or suspects had been collaborators or resistance fighters during the Nazi occupation of Holland.</p> <p>And, even though Nesb\u00f8 was not born until 1960, his books fascinatingly illuminate a specifically Scandinavian experience of the second world war. This is partly because of the writer's own personal legacy \u2013 his mother was in the resistance, while his father was among the Norwegians who fought with the Germans \u2013 but also because Norway has a literal inheritance from the period. As Scandinavians embodied the physical ideal of Nazi eugenicists, citizens were enlisted, during the occupation, in a breeding programme involving German officers, whose descendants remain in the population today. This dark history is threaded through the Harry Hole novels, particularly <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/data/book/crime/9780099546764/the-devils-star\" title=\"\"><em>The Devil's Star</em></a> (2005). In retrospect, we can see that the books also chart the rise of modern Norwegian neo-Nazism, a psychopathic disciple of which, Anders Behring Breivik, murdered 77 people in Oslo and on Ut\u00f8ya island last year. While journalism explored these tensions after the event, Scandinavian crime fiction \u2013 as the genre often does \u2013 sensed the undercurrents before the massacre happened.</p> <p>Admittedly, there is one large and frustrating gap in the form's record of the causes and consequences of the second world war. Bernhard Schlink, who wrote a number of detective novels in the 1980s before becoming better known for literary fiction such as <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/data/book/fiction/9780297859321/the-reader\" title=\"\"><em>The Reader</em></a>, acknowledges that for decades German authors were reluctant to engage with their nation's past. My suspicion is that mystery stories were a particular victim of this self-censorship because the classic structure of the murder puzzle \u2013 in which the guilt of the past is exposed and secrets are revealed - was always likely to lead, in Germany, to the villains of the Hitler era. The continuing sensitivity of the subject was shown this year when Ferdinand von Schirach \u2013 whose grandfather was head of the Hitler Youth \u2013 achieved a bestseller but also triggered controversy with <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2012/sep/21/thrillers-roundup-reviews\" title=\"\"><em>The Collini Case</em></a>, a legal thriller that deals with the continuing taboo of the infiltration of the postwar German political and judicial systems by former Nazis.</p> <p>Because of the belated and apprehensive literary response to the war in the defeated aggressor, the greatest German-language crime stories of the 20th century were written by a non-German. <a href=\"http://www.portwashington.com/moveweb/Guidewrite/durrenmatt.html\" title=\"\">Friedrich D\u00fcrrenmatt</a> (1921-90) was a Swiss polymath who worked as a playwright (<em>The Visit</em>, <em>The Physicists</em>), artist and essayist, but also wrote brilliant cop novels that explore the postwar guilt of Germany and Switzerland, whose official stance of political neutrality D\u00fcrrenmatt regarded as a lie.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398921186\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Admin/BkFill/Default_image_group/2012/10/25/1351183056513/The-Pledge-008.jpg\" alt=\"The Pledge\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jack Nicholson as the compromised cop in <em>The Pledge</em>.

It is in the work of D\u00fcrrenmatt that the crime story most fulfils its potential as an instrument for moral exploration. In <em>The Pledge</em> (1958), provocatively subtitled \"Requiem for the Detective Novel\", a retired homicide detective shockingly uses a young girl as bait in the hope of catching a sex-killer who has eluded him. In an Americanised but still properly disturbing version, <em>The Pledge</em> was impresssively filmed by Sean Penn in 2001, with Jack Nicholson as the compromised cop.</p> <p>During months of interviews, one comment affected my thinking about the genre more than any other. The Spanish writer <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/reviews/the-summer-of-dead-toys-by-antonio-hill-7858672.html\" title=\"\">Antonio Hill </a>\u2013 who has just started a Barcelona-based series with <em>The Summer of Dead Toys</em> \u2013 told me that, on a recent trip to Mexico, his hosts had expressed astonishment at his profession. \"Why the hell,\" they asked, \"would you want to write books about policemen?\" Mexicans could not envisage a cop as a hero.</p> <p>The implication of this anecdote \u2013 that crime fiction depends on readers' respect for the investigator \u2013 poses a challenge to mainstream British crime fiction, in which there is an overwhelming assumption that justice will ultimately be done. With very rare exceptions \u2013 in one of PD James's novels, Dalgliesh is forced to accept that the real villain has evaded blame \u2013 the crime is correctly and satisfyingly solved. And yet, from the Birmingham Six to Hillsborough, via recent allegations of police complicity with tabloid journalists and earlier failures to investigate the paedophilia of Jimmy Savile, there are frequent worrying suggestions that the British police have been less reliably straight than their counterparts in fiction.</p> <p>Mexicans sceptical about this kind of literature, though, should note Italian crime fiction, which pointedly accommodates ambiguity about the possibility of resolution and the role of the investigator. Leonardo Sciascia (1921-89), identified as a past master by contemporary authors almost as often as Simenon, openly showed an Italian society in which the power of the Mafia is so great that the judicial system judges it unwise to identify the true culprits. In <em>Equal Danger</em> (1971), Inspector Rogas, a rural 'tec looking into murders in the legal profession, soon realises that his police and political bosses do not want him to uncover the truth. That novel, and <em>The Day of the Owl</em> (1961), were landmark books in making Cosa Nostra a legitimate subject for fiction.</p> <p>Andrea Camilleri \u2013 who, like Sciascia, comes from the Mafia heartland of Sicily \u2013 has continued his predecessor's project of dramatising the overlap between the political and gangster establishments. Inspector Montalbano directly addresses, in anguished inner monologue, the question of what it means to be a good policeman in a culture where it can be unwelcome \u2013 or even dangerous \u2013 to crack a case. The fine British writer <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2007/apr/04/culture.obituaries\" title=\"\">Michael Dibdin </a>(1947-2007), in his 11 books about the Venetian-born Inspector Zen, borrowed from Sciascia a very non-English scepticism about the good faith of police operations.</p> <p>The pressure to ignore the real perpetrator, or to pin the crime on a false suspect, is even greater for characters who serve as police officers in a police state. The Russian writer Boris Akunin addresses this dilemma \u2013 albeit through the distancing device of historical parallel \u2013 in his series about a 19th-century police officer, Erast Fandorin. But it was \u0160kvoreck\u00fd who, from his North American exile, most eloquently expressed the dilemma of the investigator encouraged to turn a blind eye. Inspector Boruvka's problem in Soviet-controlled Czechoslovakia, he wrote, was that \"the whole country was a crime scene\" in which mass murders were regularly carried out by the government. From his reading of Conan Doyle and others, \u0160kvoreck\u00fd understood that the classic homicide puzzle depends on violent death being an exceptional event. That is why the English genre \u2013 from Christie to James and Rendell \u2013 has often involved bodies being stumbled on in rural communities, guaranteeing a dissonance between order and disorder.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398921187\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Admin/BkFill/Default_image_group/2012/10/25/1351183485871/Shadow-Dancer-008.jpg\" alt=\"Shadow Dancer\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tom Bradby's <em>Shadow Dancer</em> with (left to right) Domhnall Gleeson, Andrea Riseborough and Brid Brennan.

Only now, after years of ceasefire and peace process, is Northern Irish crime fiction flourishing through such writers as <a href=\"http://www.culturenorthernireland.org/article/3473/stuart-neville-from-armagh-to-la\" title=\"\">Stuart Neville</a> and <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/film-news/9440801/Tom-Bradby-how-I-brought-Shadow-Dancer-to-the-screen.html\" title=\"\">Tom Bradby</a>. Jason Webster points out that Spain's equivalent of the IRA, the Basque separatist terrorists ETA, who agreed a ceasefire only very recently, has yet to make a significant appearance in Spanish crime fiction. The cop novel seems to require chaos recollected from relative stability.</p> <p>It's notable, though, that even in settings where a redemptive ending is unlikely, the central investigator is invariably on the side of right. However pressured or frightened Boruvka, Rogas, Montalbano or Zen may be, they at least attempt to do the right thing. Even at its most sophisticated, the genre seems to reflect a belief that order will be restored.</p> <p>Among Sherlock Holmes's many profound influences on the genre is his status as a dire warning to authors of the risks of killing off a sleuth beloved by the public. Conan Doyle's medically unrealistic and narratively ridiculous resurrection of Holmes after killing him at the Reichenbach Falls has become a cautionary tale for crime novelists in much the way that makers of popular television are haunted by two notorious series-weakening links that also, curiously, involved water: Bobby Ewing coming out of the shower alive a year after dying in <em>Dallas</em> (his wife had dreamed his death!) and the Fonz raising his surfboard over a killer fish in <em>Happy Days</em>, leading to \"jumping the shark\" becoming the expression for a show that jettisons credibility.</p> <p>True to his cussed literary sensitivity, Nicolas Freeling believed that he could jump the Reichenbach Falls. In <em>A Long Silence</em> (1972), Van der Valk goes for an evening stroll on a rainy Dutch street and is killed in a hit-and-run related to the case he is working on. A shocking passage even when read in the knowledge of its outcome, it is one of Freeling's best pieces of writing (the critic Grey Gowrie describes Freeling as one of the finest writers of atmospheric weather) but it had a calamitous effect on his career. His readership, like the crazed fan in Stephen King's <em>Misery</em>, rebelled and refused to warm to his replacement franchise: a series featuring a French investigator, Henri Castang. In an emergency manoeuvre, Freeling was persuaded to turn to his dead detective's widow, Arlette, as a central character in a new Van der Valk series, but the audience would not be appeased.</p> <p>Conan Doyle and Freeling have the effect of a siren blaring in the head of any crime writer who, bored with a hero, considers sending them to Switzerland either literally (the Reichenbach Falls) or metaphorically, now that Zurich is code for euthanasia. Although, strangely enough, it is a Swiss detective who dies most decisively and irretrievably: almost the first thing we learn about Inspector Barlach of the Bern Police is that he has terminal cancer, which is why there are only two books about him. Killing a cerebral investigator in a Swiss canton may be another of D\u00fcrrenmatt's dark jokes.</p> <p>In the modern publishing world, with marketing managers craving a new title in a bestselling series every Christmas for as many years as possible, authors have to make a formal decision about the longevity of their cops. PD James told me that she could not bear to kill off Dalgliesh, because it would feel like writing her own death, although she declared the end of the series with <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/data/book/crime/9780571242443/the-private-patient\" title=\"\"><em>The Private Patient</em></a> (2006). That same year, Rankin retired DCI John Rebus, but has brought him back to investigate a cold case (in line with realistic police procedure) in this autumn's <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/data/book/crime/9781409144717/standing-in-another-mans-grave\" title=\"\"><em>Standing in Another Man's Grave</em></a>, having admitted to missing him. Mankell gave Wallander Alzheimer's disease in a book published three years ago, which means the detective could theoretically return but not practically, thereby reducing Mankell's risk of suffering the misery of having his ankles broken by a furious enthusiast holding him hostage in a snowy cabin. Camilleri told me that a final Montalbano novel was written out of sequence and locked in a safe at his publishers (as Christie did with the Poirot coda, <em>Curtain</em>). Miming a waterfall with his hands, he joked that he has made it impossible for his detective to be resurrected.</p> <p>At the Crime Writing Festival in Harrogate this year, Jo Nesb\u00f8, currently the world's bestselling crime writer, admitted that he knows exactly how many Harry Hole novels there will be. The front row, containing staff from his publisher, leaned forward nervously, but Nesb\u00f8 refused to disclose the number. A keen crime-reader I know believes that it will be 10: the number of career cases investigated by the godfather of Scandinavian detective fiction, Martin Beck, and the number of books to which Stieg Larsson intended his Millennium sequence to stretch until his early death confined Lisbeth Salander to a trilogy.</p> <p>Another Stockholm phenomenon \u2013 the Swedish Academy, which awards the Nobel prize for literature \u2013 ignored Gide's suggestion that the honour should go to Simenon. And such is the continuing snobbery against the genre that the Belgian's employment of crime fiction may have been held against him, as it may also have hobbled D\u00fcrrenmatt and \u0160kvoreck\u00fd, equally worthy candidates for the range of their writing. But, though sniffed at by literary history, crime writing, from Christie to Nesb\u00f8, has an enviable record of capturing the history of our times.</p> <p><em>\u2022 Foreign Bodies</em> runs on weekdays until 2 November at 1.45pm on BBC Radio 4. <em>The Martin Beck Killings</em> begins on 27 October at 2.30pm on BBC Radio 4.</p>",
  "<p>I used to hate the transition from October into November: the freezing drizzle, the lengthening nights, the gathering momentum of darkness as autumn slides towards another interminable winter. The evenings are dark enough to be depressing, the summer feels a distant memory, and there are weeks and weeks to go until Christmas. But perhaps I felt that way because I grew up in the northern hemisphere, only a few hundred miles short of the Arctic Circle.</p> <p>I made my peace with this time of year at the other end of the planet, in Antarctica, where I once spent a year as the doctor on a remote research base. November in the south tells a different, and more inspirational story \u2013 one of enveloping light, returning life, when frozen seas as broad as the continent soften and thaw. At the southernmost limits of the Earth, where conditions are so harsh only penguins and humans survive year-round, this time of year is one of delight and celebration, corresponding to May in the north.

Spending my days flooded with so much light, I had the sense that I had crossed a frontier and entered a parallel, liminal world. The sense of living beyond a pale was real; the base was isolated from the outside world for 10 months of the year. Having no way of getting in or out, and only 14 healthy base-mates to look after, I had to cast about for other things to do.</p> <p>Medics in Antarctica have a long tradition of finding other roles: Scott's doctor, <a href=\"http://www.edwardawilson.com/\" title=\"\">Edward Wilson, was a zoologist </a>and part-time geologist; <a href=\"http://website.lineone.net/~polar.publishing/polarfriction.pdf\" title=\"\">Shackleton's doctor, Eric Marshall,</a> filled in as a cartographer and surveyor. <a href=\"http://www.south-pole.com/p0000101.htm\" title=\"\">Roald Amundsen</a>, the most successful if not the most popular of that era's Antarctic explorers, himself went to medical school. Inspired by the example of these men I asked around the base, trying to find out how I might be able to contribute. There wasn't a great deal I could do, I was told, but I did learn how to maintain diesel generators, drive a bulldozer and co-pilot a plane. I helped out with meteorological observations, assisted the atmospheric scientists, and became fascinated by the lives of the emperor penguins. When there was nothing else to do, I practised my cross-country skiing, spending hours orbiting the base. And when I had finished with all that, I went to the library.</p> <p>The base had been running for 50 years, and had accumulated a respectable collection of polar books. In the evenings, as the others chatted in the bar or watched DVDs, I researched and wrote up a book about the European Arctic (surely the first person to write a book about the Arctic while living in the Antarctic?). When that was finished I revisited all the classics of Antarctic exploration: <a href=\"http://books.google.co.uk/books/about/The_heart_of_the_Antarctic.html?id=VjQNAAAAIAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y\" title=\"\"><em>The Heart of the Antarctic</em></a>, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Worst_Journey_in_the_World\" title=\"\"><em>The Worst Journey in the World</em></a>, <a href=\"http://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/s/shackleton/ernest/s52s/\" title=\"\"><em>South</em></a>, and <a href=\"http://www.spri.cam.ac.uk/museum/diaries/scottslastexpedition/\" title=\"\"><em>Scott's Last Expedition</em></a>. As the continent warms up in November, so do its residents, and I found that many of the key events of those stories took place at this time of year.</p> <p>It was in November 1915 that Ernest Shackleton's ship Endurance was crushed and sunk by rafting floes, not too far from my base. And it was 13 years before that that Robert Scott, Edward Wilson and Shackleton (then a little-known officer in the Merchant Navy) hitched up their traces and walked south across the <a href=\"http://www.eoearth.org/article/Ross_Ice_Shelf\" title=\"\">Ross Ice Barrier</a>, scouting a route towards the South Pole. These were very literary expeditions: at night Shackleton recited Browning to his tent-mates, and they read to one another from Darwin's <em>Origin of Species</em>. Apsley Cherry-Garrard notes that for evening entertainment his group held debates, taking turns to argue for the merits of Tennyson over Browning, or the relative values of love, art and beauty.</p> <p>And it was 101 years ago, at this time of year, that Scott and Wilson, together with Bowers, Evans and Oates, set out on their <a href=\"http://www.rmg.co.uk/explore/sea-and-ships/in-depth/race-to-south-pole/the-race-to-the-south-pole\" title=\"\">doomed race against Amundsen for priority at the South Pole</a>. This year we've seen a series of events commemorating the centenary of their deaths. November might have been the deadliest month for Shackleton to be caught in the sea ice, but it was, and still is, the safest to consider making a long haul into the luminous world of the Antarctic interior.</p> <p>I recently spent a year or so reliving my time at that base, writing my book <em>Empire Antarctica</em> about the experience. I wrote most of it in a hut at the bottom of my garden in Scotland, and through the winter months found a use again for much of my polar gear. Shivering in the hut, in my thermal boots and rabbit fur hat, I recalled the arched immensity of the Antarctic sky, revisited in my mind the limitless expansiveness of its plains of ice. The memories of that place were a valuable antidote to the misery of a Scottish winter. There were two images of the seasons that returned to me most vividly: watching lightshows of auroras against the backdrop of the polar night, and the giddy, sun-burst joy at the return of warmth and life in November.</p> <p>I am glad to have two perspectives now on this time of year. As we in the north descend into winter, there is comfort that somewhere across the broad reach of our planet spring is unfurling. As our pavements get slippery, and we arrive and leave work in the darkness, it pleases me that in Antarctica the sea ice is melting, the penguins are nesting, and the sun spins day and night through the sky. Our planet is balanced, at least in that respect.</p> <p>So don't get depressed this year at the darkening skies, and the sleeting rain. At the other end of the planet a world of light is unfolding. Not all of us can live a life of eternal summers, but with the help of some good travel books and a little imagination, I like to think we can hold that balance in&#xa0;mind.</p> <p>\u2022 Gavin Francis's <em>Empire Antarctica: Ice, Silence &amp; Emperor Penguins </em>is published by Chatto &amp; Windus on&#xa0;1 November.</p>",
  "<p>Jonjo Shelvey commenced his second longest walk against Manchester United last month with a grievance and a sense of shame. Sent off under a global spotlight in a harsh defeat and Liverpool's first home game since the Hillsborough Independent Panel had revealed the truth, he had ended the first with a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/sep/23/liverpool-manchester-united-match-report\" title=\"\">furious tirade at Sir Alex Ferguson</a>. \"That walk felt like a mile,\" he says.</p> <p>The next trek was from players' lounge to car park after the game. A figure appeared before him in the narrow Anfield corridor. Ferguson. \"It was a bit&#xa0; \u2026\" Shelvey does not complete the sentence. He grimaces, raises his shoulders and laughs at the awkwardness of the encounter instead. As with Jonny Evans earlier, this was a challenge he could not pull out of.</p> <p>\"I'd seen him [Ferguson] in the fourth official's ear after I made the tackle so as I was walking off I said: 'It's your fault I got sent off.' I knew I was in the wrong and then afterwards, as I was walking down the tunnel with my mate and his girlfriend, Ferguson was walking towards me. I just pulled him and apologised for what I had done.</p> <p>\"I said I was wrong and frustrated, I'm a young boy and emotions had got the better of me. But I told him I wouldn't have pulled out of the tackle if it was there. He said it was fine, that it takes a man to apologise, it was an emotional game and there are no hard feelings.\"</p> <p>The initial instinct to berate Ferguson, the apology for it and the defence of the tackle on Evans that prompted the red card say a lot about the 20-year-old. Single-mindedness has been a feature of his rise from Romford to Liverpool regular under Brendan Rodgers and now, courtesy of a substitute's appearance against San&#xa0;Marino, England international. It was there in his decision to leave Arsenal as a nine-year-old, when he walked out of his boyhood favourites, West Ham United, and rejected a move to Chelsea in favour of first-team football with Charlton Athletic. It will be there in his approach to Sunday's Merseyside derby at Everton.</p> <p>\"My dad brought me up to respect people but if you have your opinion and feel you're in the right, not to be afraid to say it,\" he explains. \"I think that counts in all aspects of life. You have to fear no one \u2013 except for our manager here. Stevie [Gerrard] and Carra [Jamie Carragher] have that attitude as well.</p> <p>\"They are born with it. It is about wanting to be a winner and a lot of games can be won on who wants it the most. I still stand by my decision that I wasn't going to pull out of that tackle. If I had pulled out I would have hurt myself and the fans would have gone mental.\"</p> <p>Shelvey cost Liverpool \u00a31.7m from Charlton in 2010, his arrival coming days before the departure of Rafael Ben\u00edtez as manager and following a journey his Irish-traveller grandfather must have appreciated. \"I was at Arsenal but I didn't like the manager of the under-10s at the time so I went to West Ham where my brother played.</p> <p>\"My dad was a coach at West Ham and thought my brother was being treated unfairly so he pulled him away from it. He said he would support me if I wanted to stay at West Ham, it was my decision, but I stuck with my brother and left.</p> <p>\"I had a year out playing local football before I went to Charlton at 12. West Ham was the&#xa0;club I supported so it was a hard decision to leave. Glenn Roeder was manager and he tried to make me stay but I couldn't. I've been brought up to be very family-oriented. I showed loyalty to my&#xa0;brother.\"</p> <p>One afternoon at The Valley, Shelvey looked up at the directors' box and spotted Kenny Dalglish sat among the suits. His career choices and his talent had paid off. \"Rafa was Liverpool manager but Kenny had a big part in signing me,\" the midfielder says. \"Chelsea had been in and&#xa0;said if I joined I'd go into their development squad. I was enjoying my time at Charlton, I was playing first-team football with a good set of lads and, to me, it would have been a step backwards to join Chelsea even though they are a big&#xa0;club.</p> <p>\"From day one at Liverpool I have been involved in the first team. I remember coming up here the first time with my mum, my dad and my sister. We went to the training ground to meet Rafa. He took us into his office and started talking to my mum about Stoke and how they play the long ball. Mum was like: 'I don't really care about Stoke.' But it showed just how much Rafa loves football.\"</p> <p>Including Ben\u00edtez, though he would never play for him, Shelvey is on his fourth Liverpool manager in less than three years, a&#xa0;period that has also included a fruitful loan spell with Ian Holloway at &#xa0;Blackpool.</p> <p>\"Ian Holloway was first class and gave you the belief that you would always be playing, which is very important as a young lad,\" he says. \"We even had to wash our own kit. Well, my girlfriend did it.\"</p> <p>Roy Hodgson gave Shelvey his debut for Liverpool, and for England, and Dalglish increasingly exposed the midfielder to the demands and pressures of the first team. But he has truly impressed under Rodgers, making far greater impact in front of goal, in possession and in the tackle.</p> <p>\"Brendan has put his trust in me and I want to keep repaying him,\" he says. \"It has been a rollercoaster this season because of the sending-off against United but there have been more positives than negatives. I am enjoying life.</p> <p>\"It is magnificent to say I've played for England but I'm sure it helped me that Roy was manager at Liverpool before. He knew what I could do. But the whole setup made me feel very welcome. I was nervous going in there on the Monday morning. I didn't know what to expect and thought no one would talk to me. I'd gone very quickly from playing in a park with my mates to sitting next to Wayne Rooney at dinner. It was a bit weird.</p> <p>\"Danny Welbeck pulled me when I arrived and said: 'Leave my manager alone.' That broke the ice.\"</p>",
  "<p>It is one of the world's largest hedge funds, with $121bn under management, but its name is virtually unknown in financial circles. Braeburn Capital is not operated from the top floor of a Manhattan skyscraper or a plush Mayfair townhouse. It is located in a quiet suburb of Nevada's capital, Reno, and it belongs to Apple.</p> <p>In a nondescript building opposite an abandoned restaurant, a small number of advisers have been charged with investing the cash pile Apple has amassed thanks to the seemingly insatiable global appetite for its consumer electronics.</p> <p>That pile has grown from $9bn when Braeburn was established in 2006 to more than $120bn (\u00a375bn), according to Apple's financial results on Thursday. That is a shade less than the $130bn Bridgewater Associates, the largest hedge fund in America and probably the world, has under management.</p> <p>Much of Apple's money is trapped overseas, sheltered from the US taxman, who would demand a 35% cut were the money to be repatriated. But it can be invested at home. Apple's financial reports show it holds $21bn of US government debt \u2013 a vast sum for a single private investor. Foreign governments like investing in US securities, but Apple owns more than the $19bn held by Malaysia, and just $4bn less than Spain.</p> <p>Apple's largest investment category is corporate securities. It has $44.5bn in company shares, more than the entire $39bn managed by Man Group, the UK's largest hedge fund. It is also a big holder of other nations' debt, with $7bn invested in sovereign securities abroad.</p> <p>Little is known about which companies Apple invests in. It occasionally owns stakes large enough to be declared: Apple was a founding investor in British chip designer ARM, but has sold out, and owns 9% of Hertfordshire-based Imagination Technologies, which designs video and audio chips.</p> <p>Braeburn does not file a record with the American stock market regulator, or the Investment Adviser Public Disclosure register; it is not an independent adviser but a division of a private company.</p> <p>It is free to hold any assets \u2013 for all anyone knows they could be short positions on the shares of its major rivals such as Samsung and Google, or the sub-prime mortgages of American homeowners, lumped together and traded on the financial markets. Indeed, it declares ownership of nearly $9bn of mortgage and asset-backed securities, according to filings.</p> <p>The decision to locate Braeburn in Nevada rather than Apple's home state of California makes sense because Nevada does not collect corporation tax or capital gains tax. California, by contrast, has a corporate tax rate of 8.84%, a rate of contribution to the public coffers that has not been enough to prevent a school funding crisis in a state that houses some of the world's most valuable companies. Managing its money from Nevada also allows Apple to lower its tax bills in other states. Florida, New Jersey and New Mexico discount taxes when a company's financial management is in another jurisdiction.</p> <p>In 2006, Apple listed only cash and short term investments in its filings, but Braeburn's managers are expected to take the long view. Apple now holds nearly $90bn of its money in \"long-term marketable securities\".</p> <p>According to analysis by the New York Times, since founding Braeburn, Apple has earned more than $2.5bn in interest and dividend income on its cash reserves and investments around the globe.</p> <p>Apple declined to comment on Braeburn's activities, but in the year its investment arm was established, an Apple spokesman explained that it would function as a regional treasury office, on a par with existing offices at its Cupertino headquarters, in Singapore and in Cork, Ireland.</p> <p>The Nevada Annual Report, a register of companies located in the state, lists three Braeburn officers: Apple attorney Gene Levoff, Michael Shapiro and Gary Wipfler, who as Apple's treasurer is the person officially responsible for the management of the technology titan's billions.</p> <p>Various Braeburn employees have filled in pared down profiles on LinkedIn, the corporate networking site, including Steve Johnson, who claims to be chief investment officer, and Rhys Gray, a chartered financial accountant previously employed by investment management firm Payden &amp; Rygel.</p> <p>Ted Mulvaney describes himself as a portfolio manager at Braeburn, and is also linked to Magrathea Financial Services, a Reno based investment firm named after a Hitch-Hiker's guide to the Galaxy planet, known as one of the wealthiest in the universe due to its extraordinary trade \u2013 building customised planets to order.</p> <p>Braeburn's team may be modest, but its scope is galactic.</p>",
  "<p>The teacher's command of his class is total. \"Which one is the whole number?\" he asks crisply. \"Is it seven over three, or is it four?\"</p> <p>He zeroes in on a child who gives the right answer, then the next task: \"Seven over three divided by four over one? Hands, please \u2013 I'm looking for straight arms.\"</p> <p>The classes at Sci Academy, a charter school in New Orleans, feel like an assembly line; with each task stripped down to component parts, and the teacher orchestrating a brisk interaction that draws in students' bodies as well as their minds. They click fingers as a substitute for applause, or to show understanding, and sit poised to attention as the teacher moves around the room.</p> <p>New Orleans is a city that has been failed by government in the past, most tragically when Katrina struck. But one consequence of that disaster has been a root-and-branch transformation of its education system. </p> <p>The reforms had begun before Katrina, but the pace was accelerated after the disaster. It is now the only US city where a majority of public school pupils \u2013 around eight in ten \u2013 attend charter schools, which are non-unionised and enjoy a rare degree of operational independence from government.</p> <p>This academic year brings further change; under reforms brought in by Republican governor Bobby Jindal, poorer students attending poorly performing state schools can apply for vouchers to cover their fees at a private or religious school. Nearly 5,000 students in Louisiana have taken up the voucher programme, making it one of the most popular such initiatives nationally. Similar experiments are underway in several other states including Indiana and Ohio.</p> <p>The creation of a fully-fledged market in education is endorsed by Mitt Romney. If elected, the Republican candidate would provide $25bn in federal money to back school voucher systems.</p> <p>In education, as in health, vouchers are a dividing line between the parties. President Obama has embraced charter schools and increased accountability for teachers, but stops short of letting public money follow children to private schools.</p> <p>The pale blue corridors of Sci Academy, housed in a cluster of prefabricated blocks in New Orleans East, are lined with inspirational mottoes: \"Chase perfection, catch excellence,\" reads one. Another declares: \"We're never done, we're never finished\".</p> <p>The words are directed at students, but could apply just as well to the teachers, who are evaluated on each lesson. Staff here are regularly observed and receive constant feedback on their performance. Closer scrutiny of teachers \u2013 particularly the linking of evaluation to standardised test results \u2013 has been controversial nationally; it was one of the issues at stake in the Chicago teachers' strike.</p> <p>The goal in New Orleans is to reverse years of educational decline. Before Katrina, state schools here had become starkly segregated on race and class lines as white and middle class families removed their children.</p> <p>By 2004 one in three New Orleans students was at a private or religious school, compared with a national average of 11%. In high school exit exams that year, 96% of the city's public school students were below basic proficiency in English.</p> <p>In the years since Katrina, student performance in tests has improved, and fewer students now go to failing schools. Students have achieved a higher average score in the ACT test, which measures readiness for college.</p> <p><a href=\" http://www.coweninstitute.com/\">A study by the Cowen Institute</a> at Tulane University notes the improvement, but is cautious about the reasons why. Many claims have been put forward \"but few have been proven by the available data,\" it says.</p> <p>John White, Louisiana's state superintendent of education, argues that decentralisation has freed schools to act in children's best interests. Charter schools, state-funded but independently run by non-profit groups, are now the norm in New Orleans. In the past school year, 78% of public school students were enrolled in charters. The proportion will rise this year. Such schools enjoy great flexibility in managing their time and allocating resources.</p> <p>White said: \"A lot of this is about ensuring that parents don't leave. It's really not the state that is the best vehicle for keeping parents in our schools, it's the schools, and how do you do that? You create a policy environment where choice is the norm, where schools have the freedom to improve and retain parents. We have a choice and competition model, where schools are competing for the interest of parents.\"</p> <p>In the New Orleans school market, where parents are purchasers and schools tout for custom, the state's role is increasingly to act as a regulator rather than a provider of services.</p> <p>In an attempt to ensure that schools don't game the system, a unified system of enrolment has been introduced for the whole city, with places at oversubscribed schools decided by lottery rather than how close the family lives. Schools must abide by the same rules on exclusions. A network of school buses provides transport, enabling families to choose a school distant from their home.</p> <p>Parents are motivated by a range of inducements, not just a school's academic achievement. Ava Lee, director of the Samuel J Green charter school, says some are attracted to the extended school day, in which children are offered a range of sporting and cultural activities from flag football to African dance. Others appreciate the school's healthy eating ethos; it has an \"edible schoolyard\" growing aubergines, kale, chillies and strawberries. Learning how to cook and eat healthily is on the curriculum here.</p> <p>Lee said: \"Schools receive a report card now, parents are savvy \u2013 they research online and see how a school is performing. It's no longer the neighbourhood school; it's really parent choice.\"</p> <p>The most controversial aspect of the Louisiana reforms is the extension of school choice outside the public system. A pilot voucher programme has existed in New Orleans since 2008, but has been expanded statewide under measures signed into law by Governor Jindal in April. Unlike the pilot, the new programme is open to children from kindergarten to 12th grade. Places at private schools are assigned by lottery and the state voucher covers tuition fees.</p> <h2>The new programme</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398427478\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2012/10/26/1351259438636/Sci-Academy-in-New-Orlean-010.jpg\" alt=\"Sci Academy in New Orleans\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sci Academy in New Orleans. Photograph: Julie Dermansky for the Guardian</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Julie Dermansky/Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p></p> <p>Jack Loup, founder of the Coalition for Louisiana Public Education, argues that there is no evidence to support the view that private schools are better.</p> <p>\"They [private schools] have never taken any tests. I went to a parochial [church] school. I certainly have nothing against them. But they don't take any tests to prove they are doing better than other schools. All they have done is throw it out there, saying parents know what's best for their child \u2013 parents have no idea how well the school is teaching their child.\"</p> <p>The initiative has meant a significant boost to the enrolment of schools like the Life of Christ Christian Academy, a non-denominational religious school in New Orleans. The school, a neat brick cube in a neighbourhood of pastel-coloured shotgun houses, is now \"75% vouchers\", according to its principal and owner Cheryl Leufroy Frilot.</p> <p>She acknowledged that the religious setting is uncomfortable for some, but said her small class sizes and relaxed teaching style are attractive to many parents. The annual cost of tuition is around $6,000 for this academic year.</p> <p>Frilot said: \"It's a free place \u2013 they can come and be who they are. Its not robotic, not military-oriented.\"</p> <p>Many parents are drawn to the moral values she instils, Frilot said, as well as valuing her \"no-nonsense\" reputation. \"What they say is: if your child's having problems, take them to Miss Frilot.\"</p> <p>Religious education here takes the form of a Bible studies class rather than comparative faith, but science is never censored, Frilot said. \"We teach evolution, we teach reproduction. I'm not saying [religion] is the only way.\"</p> <p>Private schools that accept the vouchers must enter those students for the same standardised tests taken by public schools. If they fail to reach the bar set for state schools, they face removal from the programme.</p> <p>In Louisiana, the state sets clear limits on the marketplace. In the end, accountability to its testing regime trumps choice: the government will close a chronically underperforming public school even if parents continue to choose it.</p> <p>Neerav Kingsland, chief strategy officer of the not-for-profit group New Schools for New Orleans, likens it to licensing restaurants.</p> <p>\"If a restaurant is violating health codes, even if people want to go there, we're going to close the restaurant. If some schools are performing so bad on tests, even if parents want to got there it's a civic duty to close that option.\"</p> <p>Granting schools greater autonomy is regarded as vital to the health of the system. Freeing schools from central control \u2013 chiefly by setting up charters \u2013 has been a hallmark of education reform in the US, embraced by the leaders of both parties.</p> <p>With this freedom comes the latitude to tailor a bespoke approach to complex problems, White said.</p> <p>\"We have a school in the ninth ward where the principal has decided that he's going to serve breakfast, lunch and dinner to each child. He and I worked together in New York; we were joking about what would happen if we tried to do that in the New York City system.</p> <p>\"Not only would the teacher union say it was a violation of contract, but the food service would say: 'We don't do dinner'. Security would say: 'Yes, but we have to pay for the per diem', the electricity company would say: 'No, we shut school buildings down at this hour.' My point is that when you run systems on a basis where you have these monolithic contracts, they almost by their nature ignore the complexities of schools.\"</p> <p>In common with conservative education reforms across the US, New Orleans schools have come under increased competitive pressure while facing tight spending settlements.</p> <p>In particular, the Recovery School District \u2013 a group of underperforming Louisiana schools which have been taken over by the state government \u2013 is making \"significant cuts\" in expenditure, according to the Cowen Institute.</p> <p>Loup, of the Coalition for Louisiana Public Education, said: \"The money the state provides to our school system has not been increased in four years. That increase is what allows the school system to handle the increasing costs that we receive every year, for retirement, for healthcare, for the gas that goes on the bus. That's the biggest thing that's holding our school system back.</p> <p>\"Every time you take that money away, it's taking away programmes that help those who need it the most. It means the schools are not going to do well, they'll have lower scores, it makes us look like we're not doing our job.\"</p> <p>Even before Katrina, the quality of infrastructure in New Orleans was poor. Its roads, built on swampy ground and poorly maintained, are often bumpy and potholed. The officials behind its school reforms say one of their concerns is to deal with a gap the government can fix; the supply of skilled workers.</p> <p>Raising standards in schools means more jobs in sectors like oil and gas, a mainstay of the state's economy, can be filled by local people. Patrick Dobard, superintendent of the Recovery school district, said: \"As a state we have a number of chemical plants and what we're finding is that requirements in plant operators have changed dramatically over the last ten or 15 years, where you really need a couple of years of community college or two years of four-year college to perform at the level they need to have for workers, so there's a dire need in the industry to have higher performing workers.</p> <p>\"That's why we're trying to ensure we have strong technical education in our schools.\"</p> <p>The public school system in New Orleans remains skewed by race and income compared with the city it serves. In the academic year 2011-12, 90% of students in New Orleans public schools were African American and 85% were on free or reduced lunches, an indicator of poverty. The US census says 60% of the city population is black and 24% are classified as poor.</p> <h2>The US census says</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398427479\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2012/10/26/1351268827268/Clark-Prep-charter-school-008.jpg\" alt=\"Clark Prep charter school in New Orleans\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Clark Prep: formerly a 'school of last resort'. Photograph: Julie Dermansky for the Guardian</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Julie Dermansky/Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p></p> <p>Meanwhile, those at the forefront of change are often white, prompting accusations that this is a reform imposed by outsiders. Since the charter school programme was accelerated in the wake of Katrina, the profile of school staff has changed; it has become whiter and younger. White, the state superintendent, acknowledges the change \u2013 around half of school leaders are now white, he says. He said: \"Its not far from the demographic of the city itself which has also changed. It's over a third white.\"</p> <p>The concentration of African American children in New Orleans schools dates back to desegregation; white flight created entirely black schools in the inner city, and largely white ones in the suburbs. Joseph S Clark prepatory school \u2013 better known as Clark Prep \u2013 was, before desegregation, a highly performing black school.</p> <p>But when it was taken over by charter operator FirstLine Schools, it had become a \"school of last resort,\" according to co-principal Alex Hochron.</p> <p>He said: \"The year before FirstLine took over in 2010, Clark was the lowest-performing high school in the whole of Louisiana. When we walked in here, spray-painted up one of the banisters was the word 'graveyard'. [We said] did someone do this because we're taking over the school? The response was: that's been up there for months.</p> <p>\"There was very little authority. There were fires being set in the bathrooms. I'm not saying the adults weren't working, but there wasn't a sense of consistency and support.\"</p> <p>The change in two years is evident to the students, who come up unprompted to tell outsiders of their pride in the school. One student, Henrietta London, said: \"This school used to be a mess; children were learning nothing. My mum sent me here because they're rebuilding the school and changing the culture.\"</p> <p>The school ran a poster campaign this year aimed at recruiting new parents. One poster showed faces from the class of 2012, highlighting how many had been accepted into college. Another featured a star student in his basketball gear, asking: \"What will be your legacy?\"</p> <p>Jay Altman, chief executive of FirstLine Schools, dismisses the idea that the competition for students discourages schools from sharing knowledge.</p> <p>\"Even though hospitals in this country are competing with each other and patients have relative choice, medicine has some of the best knowledge sharing in the world,\" he pointed out. \"Those of us who are trying to close the [education] achievement gap nationally, we share practices all the time.\"</p> <p>The future in Louisiana is one in which the competitive pressures will only get more intense. The state estimates that 380,000 schoolchildren, out of 700,000 statewide, are eligible for the voucher scheme. Charter schools, introduced in many other cities as competition to traditional public schools, are themselves facing the prospect of pupils being poached.</p> <p>The language of the marketplace pervades the conversation about schools here. When the architects of school reform in Louisiana speak about the public school system, it is reminiscent of a private equity firm casting a hawkish eye over a mediocre business they have just bought.</p> <p>White is uncompromising about the virtues of choice, even if that means weak schools being driven to the wall. \"I think competition is always to some degree destabilising to those who can't compete,\" he said. \"I have no problem with a school that is failing parents and kids being essentially destabilised because parents aren't choosing it.\"'</p>",
  "<p>The death of John Connelly on Thursday occurred during a week in which the breed he once represented, the English winger, appeared to be hurtling towards a fresh oblivion. When even Sir Alex Ferguson sends a team out without a genuine wide man on either flank, as he did against Braga on Tuesday, change is in the football air.</p> <p>Connelly was a Manchester United winger \u2013 a predecessor of the legion who played for Ferguson, including Jesper Olsen, Andrei Kanchelskis, Ryan Giggs, David Beckham and Cristiano Ronaldo. He was bought by Sir Matt Busby in 1964 from Burnley, with whom he had won the title, and in his second season at Old Trafford he won it again. But he owes his place in the history of English football to his membership of the small group of wingers who played in the early matches of the 1966 World Cup finals before being definitively discarded when Sir Alf Ramsey unveiled his wingless 4-4-2 formation in the quarter-final victory over Argentina.</p> <p>Connelly played in the opening goalless draw against Uruguay, Terry Paine of Southampton took over for the 2-0 win over Mexico and Ian Callaghan of Liverpool appeared in the final group match against France, also a 2-0 success. After that their day was over and the stage was cleared for a different sort of show. Ramsey had found a system with no room for players who might switch off when not directly involved in the play.</p> <p>His decision did not, in itself, signal the end for the winger. Some of the greatest managers of the next generation incorporated specialist wide men into their 4-4-2 formations: Bill Nicholson with Cliff Jones and Jimmy Robertson, Don Revie with Peter Lorimer and Eddie Gray, Bertie Mee with George Armstrong, Bob Paisley with Steve Heighway and Brian Hall, Brian Clough with Alan Hinton at Derby County and John Robertson at Nottingham Forest. Terry Venables beat the Netherlands 4-1 during Euro 96 with an England team featuring Steve McManaman and Darren Anderton.</p> <p>Where are they now \u2013 not the figures of the past but their successors? One by one the Premier League's top sides have succumbed to a creeping desire to clip their own wings in pursuit of a new tactical ideal.</p> <p>At Chelsea, where Jos\u00e9 Mourinho once sent out Damien Duff and Arjen Robben to hug the touchlines and drive full-backs to distraction, the line of players behind the main striker now comprises three almost identical examples of the type once known as inside-forwards: Juan Mata, Eden Hazard and Oscar. Each is superlatively gifted, skilful and flexible enough to play across the entire width of a pitch but on occasion their manager may discover \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/oct/23/shakhtar-donetsk-chelsea-report-champions-league\" title=\"\">as he did in defeat in Donetsk</a> this week \u2013 that a dimension has been sacrificed. When Chelsea and Manchester United meet at Stamford Bridge on Sunday, in a match between two sides separated by four points at the top of the Premier League table, before confronting each other again on Wednesday at the same venue in the League Cup, it will be fascinating to see the approaches taken by Ferguson and Roberto Di Matteo.</p> <p>The Chelsea manager would appear to have fixed on his preferred formation for the season, going with the \u00a380m investment represented by his midfield trio and introducing Ramires in place of Oscar when a more physically robust style is required. The composition of Ferguson's team is a much less fixed affair and not only because his defensive line-up has been ravaged by incessant injuries. His wingers now fulfil greatly reduced roles as he gravitates towards the 4-2-3-1 formation that has become almost universal since the last World Cup.</p> <p>Age has modified the role of Giggs, his involvement now restricted to central midfield. But Nani seems to be reserved for emergencies, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/oct/23/manchester-united-braga-champions-league\" title=\"\">as he was during the match against Braga</a>, while Ashley Young has been spending time on the bench. Antonio Valencia, such a consistent source of danger down the right during the season following his move from Wigan, has failed to recapture a regular starting place since breaking his ankle in a Champions League match against Rangers two years ago and is as likely to be employed as a stop-gap right-back as in his old position.</p> <p>Elsewhere the thoroughbred English winger is languishing. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/oct/26/liverpool-anzhi-europa-league-report\" title=\"\">Stewart Downing scored a spectacular winner for Liverpool on Thursday night</a> but he had been moved to left-back after starting on the wing, where he has failed to thrive since his \u00a320m move to Anfield. Adam Johnson, another Middlesbrough product, moved on to Sunderland in the summer after making little impact with Manchester City. Aaron Lennon at Spurs struggles to pose a consistent threat.</p> <p>What happened? Ars\u00e8ne Wenger may have started the trend towards narrowing the attacking front with his regular employment of \"inside-out\" wingers, such as Marc Overmars and Robert Pires, cutting inside a full-back in order to shoot or pass with their stronger foot. An easier task for the average forward than going round the outside of a full-back and trying to get in a decent cross, it was much copied, to the point where, as part of the wholesale adoption of 4-2-3-1, it has turned into an orthodoxy.</p> <p>But even Wenger now seems to distrust the value of a specialist player on the flank. That is where he plays Theo Walcott and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, although neither thinks of himself in those terms and they are not helped by the lack of consistently effective strike forwards.</p> <p>The phenomenon of the inside-out winger was not invented at Highbury, or at the Camp Nou with Lionel Messi, and was not exactly new even when Wenger began to make such a success of it. Lob a ball at Chris Waddle 10 times in a row and, as he says, he will kick it with his left foot every time. But the winger preferred to play on the right flank while winning his 62 caps with England between 1985 and 1991, training hard to minimise the weakness on his right foot with the intention of ensuring that his opponent knew he was capable of going past on either side.</p> <p>Waddle is dismayed by what he sees as the loss of important skills to the current tactical evolution. \"We're still completely different from every other country,\" he says. \"Our football is not about keeping the ball and beating an opponent. It's more like basketball, up and down at high speed. But beating a player is the most dangerous thing you can do. You take an opponent out of the game and you create space.</p> <p>\"When I was at Marseille I was never expected to track back. In this country it's rare to find a coach telling a winger to stay upfield. But we've always seen wingers as luxury items and we're just not breeding players with that sort of flair. We don't have the dribblers any more.\"</p> <p>He identifies James Milner of Manchester City and England as an example of the problem. \"He's a good tidy player who puts a shift in, and he's very versatile. He can play in central midfield, out wide and probably at left-back and centre-forward, too. But if you're asking him to terrorise a full-back, then no. He hasn't got the flair or the tricks of a winger. But that's not the lad's fault.\"</p> <p>Waddle blames the academy system, with its concentration on getting players to transfer the ball as quickly as possible. \"Why are we so obsessed with two-touch football? In the final third you want to see something different \u2013 and we're coaching it out of them. When Samir Nasri was at Marseille, you can bet nobody tried to stop him beating a man. When Lionel Messi was 14 or 15, nobody at Barcelona was shouting at him to get rid of it. There's nothing more dangerous than going past a defender and getting a cross in. But what we've got is a world of bibs and cones.\"</p> <p>And a rather less colourful world, if the wizards of the chalkboard are denying themselves the option offered by the traditional touchline-hugger whose repertoire includes a devastating final ball. In the universe of football, however, any discarded idea is likely to reappear when the time is right. Although he may seem to have gone the way of short shorts and black boots, the winger will be back. But probably not tomorrow.</p>",
  "<p>So many stories of employers pressuring their workers to vote for Romney have come out that you might think workplace intimidation was invented just for this election.</p> <p>Romney certainly hasn't done much to dispel this perception. In a conference call to the National Federation of Independent Business, the GOP candidate was <a href=\"http://www.theatlanticwire.com/politics/2012/10/romney-told-employers-tell-employees-whom-vote/58076/\">recorded encouraging business owners</a> to:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"[M]ake it very clear to your employees what you believe is in the best interest of your enterprise and therefore their job and their future in the upcoming elections.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>A number of Romney backers took it upon themselves to spell out more clearly to their workers what \"the best interest for their job\" really means. David Siegel, CEO of Florida's Westgate Resorts, <a href=\"http://gawker.com/5950189/the-ceo-who-built-himself-americas-largest-house-just-threatened-to-fire-his-employees-if-obamas-elected\">emailed</a> his employees that a second term for Obama would likely give him \"no choice but to reduce the size of this company\". Republican donor-activists Charles and David Koch were no less subtle when they sent 45,000 employees of their Georgia Pacific paper company a list of whom to vote for, warning that workers \"<a href=\"http://www.inthesetimes.com/article/14017/koch_industries_sends_45000_employees_pro_romney_mailing\">may suffer the consequences</a>\" if Obama is re-elected.</p> <p>Florida-based ASG Software CEO Arthur Allen informed his employees that he was contemplating a merger that would eliminate \"<a href=\"http://tv.msnbc.com/2012/10/14/exclusive-ceo-suggests-employees-jobs-may-be-at-stake-if-romney-doesnt-win/\">60% of the salaries</a>\" of the company \u2013 should Romney lose. In Ohio, coal mine owner Robert Murray <a href=\"http://www.tnr.com/article/politics/108140/coal-miners-donor-mitt-romney-benefactor\">left employees in no doubt that they were expected to attend a Romney rally</a> \u2013 off the clock and without pay. In Cuba, at least they pay workers for show demonstrations.</p> <p>Democrats are apoplectic. But as Romney assured those who have the power to hire and fire thousands of people, there is \"nothing illegal about you talking to your employees about what you believe is best for the business\". He's right. Heavy-handed? Yes. An abuse of authority? Probably. Against the law? Not likely.</p> <p>News outlets, on the other hand, are merely confused.</p> <p>\"Can your boss really tell you who to vote for?\" <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2012/10/can-your-boss-threaten-to-fire-you-if-you-dont-vote-for-romney/263709/\">asked</a> the Atlantic incredulously, before concluding the answer is \"probably yes\". Should this be a surprise? Seeing that your boss can legally tell you to do nearly anything else, down to what you may wear, when you may eat and how often you may go to the bathroom (and, if he wishes, demand samples when you do), the question comes across as a little na\u00efve. So, too, is the <a href=\"http://www.marketplace.org/topics/elections/campaign-trail/you-can-get-fired-talking-politics-work\">corollary</a> \"Can you be fired for expressing political views at work?\" Again, the answer is probably yes, which should only be a shock to anyone who has never held a job in an American private-sector workplace.</p> <p>In truth, as an \"at-will\" (that is, non-union) employee, you can be fired for much less. In Arizona, you can be fired for <a href=\"http://www.ibtimes.com/ariz-birth-control-bill-lets-employers-fire-women-pill-based-religious-views-425530\">using birth control</a>. If you live in any one of 29 states, you can be fired for <a href=\"http://williamsinstitute.law.ucla.edu/press/5-people-who-were-fired-for-being-gay-and-the-29-states-where-that-is-still-legal/\">being gay</a>. You can be fired for <a href=\"http://www.buzzfeed.com/expresident/really-weird-reasons-for-getting-fired\">being a fan of the Green Bay Packers</a> if your boss roots for the Bears.</p> <p>Lest you think employer authority ends when you clock out, only four states \u2013 California, Colorado, New York and North Dakota \u2013 protect workers from being fired for legal activity <em>outside of work</em>. For the rest, workers can and <a href=\"http://crookedtimber.org/2012/07/01/let-it-bleed-libertarianism-and-the-workplace/\">have been fired for anything</a> from smoking to cross-dressing, all in the privacy of their homes. The growing practice of employers demanding job applicants to <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2122404/House-kills-plan-block-employers-demanding-Facebook-passwords-job-applicants.html\">hand over their Facebook passwords</a> underscores the blurring of the work-life divide in this information age.</p> <p>But free speech and voting rights are supposed to be more sacrosanct than the integrity of your Facebook account, so one would expect there to be greater political safeguards at work than there actually are. This is not to say they don't exist. Federal law makes it illegal to \"intimidate, threaten or coerce\" anyone against voting as they wish. But as Siegel, Allen and the Koch brothers have shown, the distinction between possible coercion or intimidation and \"worker education\" is rather fuzzy in the eyes of the law.</p> <p>Rather, the federal government largely punted questions of employee free speech to states, a legacy of federalism that <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Crow_laws\">hasn't had the best track record</a> when it comes to voting rights. In a state-by-state breakdown, UCLA law professor <a href=\"http://www.trolp.org/main_pgs/issues/v16n2/Volokh.pdf\">Eugene Volokh</a> finds such laws vary widely. About half of Americans live in states that provide some worker protection for political speech or from pressure to vote a certain way, such as threat of job loss. Florida is not one of them. Ohio bars employers from forcing workers to sign a petition, but not from <a href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/mojo/2012/08/ohio-miners-required-attend-romney-rally\">standing in front of cameras</a> next to a \"Coal Country Stands With Mitt\" banner.</p> <p>Of course, what's on the books is one matter; enforcement is another. Even if you are lucky enough to live in New Mexico and have a signed letter saying you were fired for your Obama tote bag, it typically takes litigation to get your job back. And many people don't have the time or money to go through a court battle, even if the law is on their side.</p> <p>If anything is happening on the legal end, things are getting worse. The 2010 US supreme court Citizens United case greatly expanded the parameters of what is considered \"employer free speech\". Most famously, the decision lifted restrictions on corporate campaign spending and gave rise to Super Pacs. But the broader implications are unclear. If Citizens United gives companies free rein to mobilize their resources politically as they wish, one former FEC official <a href=\"http://www.rollcall.com/issues/58_32/Workplace-Intimidation-Becomes-Murky-Post-Citizens-United-Era-218456-1.html\">suggests</a> that employees could be considered resources which companies may mobilize.</p> <p>This is why the recent political turn of employee intimidation isn't an anomaly. It's an election year manifestation \u2013 aided by the supreme court \u2013 of fundamental power imbalances that exist in most workplaces. Brooklyn College political scientist Corey Robin sees a historical pattern: </p> <blockquote> <p>\"During the McCarthy years, the state outsourced the most significant forms of coercion and repression to the workplace. Fewer than 200 people went to jail for their political beliefs, but two out of every five American workers was investigated or subject to surveillance. </p> <p>\"Today, we're seeing a similar process of outsourcing. Government can't tell you how to vote, but it allows CEOs to do so.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Robin concluded:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>When workers are forced to go to rallies in communist countries, we call that Stalinism. Here, we call it the free market.</p> </blockquote>",
  "<p>Former Conservative cabinet minister Jonathan Aitken was convicted in&#xa0;1999 of perjury and perverting the course of justice and served seven months in jail. Conrad Black, who once owned the Telegraph and has a seat in the House of Lords, was released from a US prison this year after serving time for fraud and obstruction of justice. This week they met to compare experiences. Susanna Rustin listened in.</p> <p><strong>Jonathan Aitken:</strong> Anyone who's been through the experience of incarceration as a high-profile prisoner faces special challenges. One way to succeed is to go with the flow and find a way of getting on with the guys you are in with.</p> <p><strong>Conrad Black:</strong> In the US system, 97% of prosecutions end in guilty pleas and 85% of cases that go to trial are convictions. There's huge resentment of such an over-mighty prosecution system and respect for anyone who fights it. Because mine was a famous case, and the prisoners saw my arrival on CNN, they thought here's somebody who fought the system. So I was sort of a good chap in advance.</p> <p><strong>JA:</strong> I pleaded guilty at the earliest opportunity. That's a much easier way to go through it. I found it harder coming out of prison than going in, because people's attitudes to you are so strange.</p> <p><strong>Susanna Rustin:</strong> How did you find getting out of jail?</p> <p><strong>CB:</strong> Extremely agreeable. Because I was not a US citizen, I was handed over to the immigration and customs enforcement agency and conducted to Miami airport where my wife [Barbara Amiel] was waiting for me. We had a charter and we went right to the front of the line and took off. It was a very happy trip. My wife normally takes a dim view of any form of drinking, particularly prior to noon, but she served me a very nice glass of white wine at about 10am.</p> <p><strong>SR:</strong> Do you remember your first night in prison?</p> <p><strong>JA:</strong> I do for one comic reason and one scary reason. The comic reason was that on the day I was sentenced I was the most notorious person in the country. When I got inside I was interviewed by a&#xa0;prison psychiatrist who was blissfully ignorant of who I was. When he asked, \"Does anyone other than your next of kin know you're in prison?\" and I said, \"Maybe by now 20 million people know,\" he scribbled on his pad and became rather kind and asked had I&#xa0;ever suffered from delusions. The sinister reason was that when I got into my cell the prisoners set up a chant, and the gist of it was that Aitken has arrived, tomorrow morning let's show him! I&#xa0;now know that's what happens every night in Belmarsh. But I&#xa0;thought they meant it, so I was scared.</p> <p><strong>SR:</strong> Were you scared by prison?</p> <p><strong>CB:</strong> My spirits weren't lowered too much. My wife accused me of pretending it was Camp New Moon [a children's summer camp in Canada]. But I was worried about getting on. My background, like Jonathan's, is different from most of the people we were with and I&#xa0;didn't want to be an outcast. But they couldn't have been nicer, and I soon recognised the politics of the place \u2013 there were heads of ethnic groups and factions. The first night I was there, a mafioso came over and said nobody would bother me.</p> <p><strong>JA: </strong>Some people said to me, once you're out you'll go back to being a big cheese and forget about us. And I haven't. I made one tremendous friend in prison, and until he died recently I saw him twice a&#xa0;week. At my wedding [to Elizabeth Harris in 2003] by some strange statistical quirk there was the same number of ex-cabinet members as ex-cons.</p> <p><strong>SR:</strong> Did prison change your views on criminal justice?</p> <p><strong>CB:</strong> I was always rather liberal on these matters in American terms. We have to make a special case for violent people, obviously the public has to have some protection from them. But I think prison for non-violent people is nonsense.</p> <p><strong>SR:</strong> What is the appropriate punishment for people convicted, as you were, of financial crimes?</p> <p><strong>CB:</strong> Working for free, or if they have no means of support, then living in shelters [hostels] under a basic regime, contributing their service to designated causes. If you get recidivism you have to imprison people, but most in my opinion would not be repeat offenders.</p> <p><strong>JA:</strong> I get called a prison reformer now, and in a sense that's true, but the reforms this country ought to focus on are not the prison system, which is quite decently run, but rehabilitation.</p> <p><strong>CB:</strong> In the US private prisons are always agitating for more criminal offences, longer sentences and a larger prison population. It's just like any other business, only more tawdry and corrupt.</p> <p><strong>SR:</strong> What does it feel like to fall from the pinnacle of the British establishment to public humiliation?</p> <p><strong>CB:</strong> I was so contemptuous of the process by which I was sent to prison that I was determined not to let it diminish me. It was a novelty. I&#xa0;had never been in a milieu like this before, so I was naturally curious. I was relieved it wasn't more difficult. It was tedious and it was unjust that I was there at all. But I didn't find it humiliating.</p> <p><strong>JA:</strong> The struggle is to survive and say, I'm going to start again, I know I've got to have a different life but it may not be a worse life. I don't want to minimise the struggle of it, but I think reasonably strong characters \u2013 and I suspect Conrad and I could both be put in that bracket \u2013 are not going to go to pieces. The question is, how do you come back from that?</p> <p><strong>CB:</strong> I got messages of support every day and found them very encouraging. Some people I took to be friends were disappointing, but many people from whom I had no right to expect anything filled up much of that gap. I thought Rupert Murdoch [whose newspapers criticised Black] revealed himself as an absolutely beastly and terrible man, despite his very great achievements.</p> <p><strong>JA:</strong> I start from the notion that the \"hoops of steel\" club, as Shakespeare calls it, is very small. My friends in that category were rock solid. There were surprises among the rest. Two days after I was released, Denis Thatcher asked me to lunch at his club. I think if I was to go through the disappointments list with Conrad, we might find some people in common \u2013 Max Hastings for example.</p> <p><strong>SR:</strong> How important was religion?</p> <p><strong>CB:</strong> If you believe in God I think it's much easier to believe there is some purpose even when inexplicably unjust things are happening. Also, there's the idea that a setback on this scale is something you must draw a lesson from and work hard to see what the lesson might be. History is full of people who did come back from terrible setbacks and so you never lose hope. You aren't out of the game altogether, you just have to regroup.</p> <p><strong>JA: </strong>I would hate to have gone through all this without there being a huge spiritual element. To this day I do quite a lot of faith-based work in prisons.</p> <p><strong>SR:</strong> Should prisoners have the vote?</p> <p><strong>JA: </strong>No for constitutional reasons. I hate the idea of the British being pushed around by Strasbourg judges.</p> <p><strong>CB:</strong> For me there is a distinction between people convicted of violent crimes, who I think while they're in prison shouldn't have the vote. And the others shouldn't be in prison anyway so they should.</p> <p><strong>SR:</strong> Jonathan's first marriage ended in divorce. Did your marriage suffer?</p> <p><strong>CB:</strong> I think it was more difficult for my&#xa0;wife because she had a lonelier life without me. She doesn't like Florida, but she stayed there a lot because it was near to me. In the summer it's terribly hot and she has these magnificent dogs that have heavy fur coats. It was very uncomfortable for them.</p> <p>\u2022&#xa0;A Matter of Principle by Conrad Black is published by Biteback, price \u00a314.99.</p>",
  "<p>The retired British businessman Christopher Tappin has agreed a plea bargain deal with US prosecutors that his family hopes will guarantee his \"swift and safe return\" to the UK.</p> <p>Tappin, 65, from Orpington, Kent, spent two years fighting a legal battle against extradition to the US where he faces charges of conspiring to sell batteries for Iranian missiles.</p> <p>His case became a focus for criticism of the UK's extradition arrangements with the US. His rapid repatriation may partially mollify opponents of the arrangements who claim they are not fully reciprocal and disadvantage British suspects.</p> <p>Although Tappin has reached a deal with prosecutors, the court in El Paso, Texas, must ratify the terms of the agreement and formally sentence him. His wife, Elaine, said: \"From the moment Chris was put on a plane all we ever wanted was his swift and safe return. However upsetting, this is the beginning of that process. It would be inappropriate to comment further whilst the court has yet to establish Chris's fate.\"</p> <p>Tappin is on bail in El Paso after spending two months in a New Mexico detention centre. He faces up to 35 years in jail but any sentence is likely to be significantly reduced under a plea deal. The terms of the deal have not been released.</p> <p>Tappin's UK lawyer, Karen Todner, who also represented the alleged computer hacker Gary McKinnon in his successful 10-year fight against extradition, said 98% of people who enter the US justice system enter into a plea agreement.</p> <p>\"The odds are so heavily stacked against a defendant who chooses to plead not guilty and then is subsequently found guilty that the vast majority of people facing trial in the US opt to take a plea agreement,\" she said. \"This decision should come as no surprise.</p> <p>\"The US prosecutor has within his discretion the decision as to whether any custodial sentence can be served in the UK. If the US prosecutor declares, following a conviction, that repatriation should not take place then it is almost impossible to obtain.</p> <p>\"I hope that following this decision to enter into a plea agreement Mr Tappin will be able to return to the UK as soon as possible to rejoin his family.\"</p> <p>Tappin's case followed an investigation which began in 2005 when US agents asked technology providers about purchasers. Those customers that raised US suspicions were then approached by undercover companies set up by government agencies.</p> <p>Robert Gibson, a British associate of Tappin who agreed to co-operate, was jailed for 24 months after pleading guilty to conspiracy to export defence articles.</p> <p>Gibson provided customs agents with about 16,000 computer files and emails indicating that he and Tappin had long-standing commercial ties with Iranian customers.</p> <p>David Bermingham, one of three bankers jailed for 37 months over an Enron-related fraud in a deal with US prosecutors in 2008, said earlier this year that no sane defendant would risk dozens of years in jail when a plea bargain could enable them to be home within months.</p>",

It took place as the ceasefire called to mark the Islamic festival of Eid al-Adha was already faltering in parts of the country, with regime forces and rebel groups blaming each other for the violations.</p> <p>Car bombs have been increasingly used by rebel groups, including the Islamist Jabhat al-Nusraf organisation, which has some ideological links to the global jihad movement. However, such groups have largely targeted security bases.</p> <p>This bomb hit Daff al-Shouk square, where families were celebrating Eid, on the southern outskirts of the capital. No group had claimed responsibility for the blast by nightfall.</p> <p>Earlier, the truce brokered by the UN-Arab League peace envoy, Lakhdar Brahimi, had done little to stem the violence in parts of Syria, including parts of Damascus and ravaged districts of Aleppo.</p> <p>The Local Co-ordination Committees, which monitor violence daily, reported 110 breaches of the truce and around 48 deaths, a toll that is sharply down on any other day in recent months. Other areas of the country, such as the cities of Homs and Hama, were quieter than in recent months. Activists there reported that families had taken to the streets of some neighbourhoods to celebrate one of the holiest occasions in the Islamic calendar.</p> <p>In Aleppo, the centre of violence since rebels stormed the city in mid-July, gains made by opposition fighters in three districts on Thursday were partially clawed back by the army. Rebels had moved into the districts, reporting little resistance from a Kurdish militia in one of the areas and Syrian troops in two others. Little ground had previously changed hands in Aleppo despite more than two months of fighting. Syrian forces retain control of much of the west of the city and strategic points on the outskirts, such as the airport. However, they remain unable to secure the east of the city, despite near constant aerial bombardment of rebels in some districts.</p> <p>On Thursday Turkey denied a Human Rights Watch claim that it was preventing thousands of Syrian refugees from crossing into its territory. Turkey is hosting about 103,000 Syrian refugees and says it expects thousands more as winter closes in. Refugee groups claim some of those fleeing have been unable to cross from Syria since late August. Lebanon and Jordan are sheltering similar numbers to Turkey. All three states say they are under-prepared for an expected influx in the last weeks of autumn.</p> <p>Human Rights Watch senior refugee researcher Gerry Simpson said: \" General assurances [from Turkey] alone will not open borders. Thousands of desperate Syrians remain stuck inside Syria on the Turkish and Iraqi borders amidst mounting insecurity and with winter fast approaching.</p> <p>\"Human Rights Watch calls on the UN refugee agency to report publicly on which border crossings are closed and how many Syrians are stuck inside Syria as a result.\"</p>",

Lord (Ian) Blair, the former commissioner of the Metropolitan police \u2013 which has no election because London's mayor already acts as a quasi-PCC \u2013 angered ministers by urging voters to boycott the 15 November ballot during a television appearance last Sunday.</p> <p>One public meeting in Reading attended by six candidates for the post in the Thames Valley force attracted barely 20 voters \u2013 out of the 2.2 million people living in the authority.</p> <p>To the dismay of voters and the disquiet of police forces themselves, the largest group of candidates are <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/oct/19/police-commissioner-election-lists\" title=\"\">not the independents which polls say most voters would prefer</a>, but those picked by the main political parties \u2013 councillors past and current, MEPs, assembly members and a smattering of former MPs, mostly Labour. Only parties have the election machinery and volunteers to get the vote out, but low turnout could produce unexpected results.</p> <p>A quarter of the candidates are former military or police officers, both constables and senior ranks, who are campaigning on their experience.</p> <p>Fewer than 40 contenders are women, according to the Police Foundation's analysis.</p> <p>Labour and the Tories have candidates in all 41 police authorities \u2013 their size favours the Conservatives \u2013 with the Lib Dems contesting 23 and Ukip a similar number. Each has paid a \u00a35,000 deposit.</p> <p>Newly-elected PCCs will be responsible for setting budgets and holding their chief constable to account. They also face daunting challenges in responding to popular clamour for more localised and visible neighbourhood policing at a time when the manpower-heavy service is struggling to achieve greater efficiency in the face of 20% budget cuts.</p> <p>The outsourcing of back-office functions to private sector contractors is likely to increase, despite some candidates campaigning against it. The new PCCs, who will take over immediately from traditional low-profile police authorities, must also address the wider crime-reduction agenda which involves probation, councils and other local public services.</p> <p>Ministers know they have taken a leap in the dark in imposing the new system without pilot schemes or the kind of referendums that rejected elected city mayors everywhere except Bristol in May. Fears that extremist or \"Rambo\" candidates might stand and even win have largely failed to materialise. But the police minister, Damian Green, who was out canvassing with Tory hopefuls this week, knows the scale of the gamble.</p> <h2>A selection of the candidates</h2> <p><strong>Nick Alston CBE (Con, Essex)</strong> exemplifies the strong police and military flavour in the first PCC elections. Born in a Harwich police station and the son of a former deputy chief constable of Essex, the Cambridge graduate served as a Royal Navy officer and then worked in unspecified \"operational defence and security work\" in the UK and abroad, including with Goldman Sachs. He is high-profile, and promises partnership and localism. Age: 59. Salary (if elected): \u00a385,000.</p> <p><strong>Vera Baird (Lab, Northumbria)</strong> is a barrister and former Redcar MP and solicitor general. She is one of several high-profile politicians almost certain to be elected.

  "<p>Gareth Henry hit the international headlines in his native Jamaica four years ago when he was beaten by policemen in front of a mob of 200 people who cornered him in a Kingston pharmacy.</p> <p>A year later, in 2008, the head of the Jamaica Forum for Lesbians, All Sexuals and Gays (J-Flag), fled to Canada following a series of death threats. He was granted asylum.</p> <p>The 35-year-old gay rights activist and social worker is now <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/26/jamaica-gay-rights-homophobic-laws\" title=\"\">one of two co-petitioners bringing the legal challenge against his former homeland at the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights</a>.</p> <p>\"I was with J-Flag for four years,\" Henry explained on a trip to London this month. \"During that time 13 of my friends were killed.\" He identified several of the bodies. \"I took on the leadership of the organisation after the former leader, Brian Williamson, was stabbed to death in a homophobic attack in 2004.\"</p> <p>On three occasions, Henry said, he suffered violence at the hands of police officers. The most notorious incident was on Valentine's Day, 2007, when a group of gay men were chased into the Monarch pharmacy in Kingston by a large mob. Henry was with them.</p> <p>According to his statement to the commission, the police were called but were abusive when they arrived. One officer asked if he was a \"batty man\" and then all four policemen began beating him with their guns.</p> <p>He subsequently complained to the Jamaican ministry of justice. \"I met politicians and officials. I expressed concern about my safety and the fact that I was being targeted by the police. They didn't respond. The harassment from the police increased,\" he said.</p> <p>\"When I woke up on the morning there would be a police officer outside my window, saying they were going to kill me. I used to help house gay men who were homeless \u2013 primarily because family members had turned their backs on them. Some of these people were dying from HIV/Aids.</p> <p>\"If you are homeless and have no family support and are dying from HIV you have a sense of hopelessness. Even these people became a target for attacks.</p> <p>\"We documented the threats on my life. After the incident in February 2007, that made international headlines, we thought that would make some changes. But I had to go and live in hiding.</p> <p>\"I was stopped in traffic and a police officer said 'I have found you and we are going to kill you'. That statement still lives with me today. When I saw my friends being killed, I always asked 'Am I going to be next?'</p> <p>\"When he said that to me, I suddenly realised I was the next target. So I had to make a decision between running away and trying to find a safe place in a foreign land or staying and being killed.</p> <p>\"I was able to get out just in time but there are many other young men who are faced with the same threats and are not able to leave home and find a safe haven.</p> <p>\"Now I want to hold the Jamaican government accountable. A large proportion of the gay community in Jamaica is homeless and living in poverty and being ravished by HIV. Living with no hope and facing humiliation.</p> <p>\"Those people go through each day trying to survive, being anxious about homophobia and wondering whether they will be the next victim. There's no safe place in this country. We have exhausted all the possible options in terms of negotiations and meetings with the police.</p> <p>\"Why would a sane person chose to be a homosexual? Why would you chose death over life? It's clearly a human rights violation and it's time for radical action. We are calling on the international community to help save the gay community in Kingston.\"</p>",
  "<p>This week brought more bad news for hockey fans in a very bad news autumn. Thursday marked the deadline imposed by the NHL after which a full-length, 82-game season would not be possible. That deadline also meant the NHL withdrew its latest offer to the NHL Players' Association. Now, the league and the players remain at an impasse, and there are questions surrounding both how long a potential season might be, and whether fans will be denied experiencing the Winter Classic because of a protracted season. That is, if there is any NHL season at all. On Friday the season was postponed until 30 November - at the earliest.</p> <h2>The deals</h2> <p>About a week ago, the NHL put forward another deal to the NHLPA, a number of whose members are already off in Europe, playing away from increasingly frustrated North American eyes. It was the first time a proposal had been introduced since mid-September, and this time for some reason, the NHL decided to make it public. Anyway, it went something like this (broadly speaking): </p> <p>Taking after some of the other major leagues out there (and yes, the NHL still considers itself in that group), there would be a 50-50 split of hockey-related revenue (HRR) for each of the six years of the Collective Bargaining Agreement. It's worth remembering that at the end of the last deal, the players' cut of HRR was 57%, so that's a fairly considerable drop, and not one that the players were ultimately willing to accept \u2013 at the moment. </p> <p>The league also offered that players only have a maximum contract length of five years, bringing it down from, well, the basically unlimited number of years a player can sign for now. The NHL also proposed to make entry-level deals shorter, and it also stipulated that free agency would only happen after age 28, or after the player had been in the league for eight years. </p> <p>During a press conference, league commissioner <a href=\"http://www.nhl.com/ice/news.htm?id=643558\">Gary Bettman said the offer was put forward to try to ward off the loss of a full 82-game season, and that he believed it to be fair</a>.</p> <p>In response, the NHLPA gave the league three different proposals. In one, the players offered to take a raise in the first three years of a new deal, and then from then on have their wages frozen until their share of HRR was at 50%. The second offer was a variation on that, stipulating that the players would get 24.7% of new revenues every year as their share of HRR fell every year until it hit 50%.</p> <p>The third offer from the NHLPA is a little more complicated. <a href=\"http://www.theglobeandmail.com/sports/hockey/the-nhlpas-three-counter-proposals/article4622583/\">Here's how the Globe and Mail explained it</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"Players propose here that 13 per cent of revenues would not count toward the players' share or the salary cap and are instead used to pay existing contracts. The remaining 87 per cent is then distributed among players as part of a 50-50 sharing of that remaining revenue. The NHLPA indicated this option would involve both sides receiving a 50-per-cent share by Year 5 but that was disputed by the league in a press release.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Anyway, it seems the real problem was that the NHLPA wanted the league to still honour all the contracts the teams had already signed. Bettman said \"none of the three variations of player share that they gave us even began to approach [a] 50-50 [revenue split],\" <a href=\"http://www.tsn.ca/nhl/story/?id=407649\">he told the Canadian Press</a>. \"It's clear we're not speaking the same language.\"</p> <p>So here we are. Something major will have to happen to get these sides to agree, and that major happening will likely have to center on the 50-50 split. Likely, the league will have to give in a bit and allow for a gradual climb-down, rather than slashing away at the HRR split as it stands now. But how long will that take? And how long will the players be willing to hold out? Is it really about wanting to play? </p> <p>Finally, what of the Winter Classic? There's probably still a bit of time to save it, but if the league starts cutting the season in huge swaths, things like the Winter Classic and the All Star Game will be ever more in jeopardy (the All Star Game already is, really) to fit in a compacted schedule. That would be a shame, but at this point most fans would likely rather just see hockey again than worry too much about something like the Winter Classic. After all, there always next year. Theoretically.</p> <h2>The politics of it</h2> <p>In a weird little twist to this story, on Wednesday night, Jay Leno asked Barack Obama about the dispute on the Tonight Show. A \"Mike\" from Los Angeles asked whether Obama could \"pull some strings to end the NHL lockout\". The president responded:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I do have a comment on this. Every time these things happen, I just want to remind the owners and the players: you guys make money because you got a whole bunch of fans out there, who are working really hard, they buy tickets, they're watching on TV \u2013 y'all should be able to figure this out. Get this done.</p> </blockquote>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/dG0TzlA1oGA?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"369\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/dG0TzlA1oGA\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>Meanwhile, the team over at <a href=\"http://deadspin.com/5951872/inside-a-secret-nhl-focus-group-how-a-top-gop-strategist-is-helping-hockey-owners-craft-their-lockout-propaganda\">Deadspin got their hands on documents</a> distributed at a focus group arranged by the NHL to test its messaging strategy, apparently settling on \"shared sacrifice\" as the winner. Behind it all? A Republican strategist. </p> <blockquote> <p>As the lockout claimed its first actual games, the NHL hurriedly turned to the experts on shaping public debate: Luntz Global, the multinational market research firm that proudly proclaims, \"It's not what you say, it's what they hear.\" CEO and founder Frank Luntz is one of the Republican Party's chief strategists, and he appears regularly on CBS and Fox News as an analyst. [...]</p> <p>The league is eager to portray individual players as not in step with the union, claiming that the majority of them don't believe or don't buy into the rhetoric used by Donald Fehr and NHLPA leaders, and that they just want to play hockey. \"The players are not the enemy,\" the NHL may very well tell you. \"The union is the problem.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Deadspin has the entire package the focus group members were handed, along with an account of how the focus group worked. Luntz responded to the story on Twitter, saying it was an \"attempt to discredit NHL efforts to reach agreement w/ players on new CBA\".</p> <h2><a href=\"http://leafsbeefs.com/\">Leafs Beefs</a> explains it all. With beer.</h2> <p>Nothing explains union labour negotiations like a two-four of Pabst. </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/DBsEzolynBg?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"369\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/DBsEzolynBg\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p></p> <h2>The Brooklyn Islanders?</h2> <p>In amongst all the talk of labour disputes, though, there was other NHL news: The New York Islanders will be moving (for the 2015-16 season) to Brooklyn. <a href=\"http://youtu.be/3AvNFyuONJs\">Here is a very grainy and very boring clip of the formal announcement</a>.</p> <p>Anyway, the Islanders signed a 25-year, $1bn lease agreement with the Barclays Center, putting an end to lengthy speculation about where the team might go. The <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-10-24/nhl-islanders-to-move-to-brooklyn-s-barclays-arena-ny-post-says.html\">Islanders ownership had been threatening to move the team for a while, and had the 2015 season marked off already, given the lease at the Nassau Coliseum was set to expire</a>.</p> <p>It seems to me the move is a double-edged sword. The relocation might be a shot in the arm to an organization that's been floundering of late, and might be yet another feather in Brooklyn's cap as it tries to (seemingly \u2013 from this vantage point, anyway) separate itself from simply being a part of \"New York\" and define itself as a city again. All of which is cool, and could make for a really interesting new chapter in the life of this team. </p> <p>But, then there are the questions of legacy. The Islanders have been at home on Long Island - and at the Coliseum - since 1972, and in that time brought home four Stanley Cups, so moving them will be tough for the locals who would have to travel an extra 45km or so to see the team play in Brooklyn. And no matter where the Islanders play, is there still room for this team in the New York area? Can both the Rangers and Islanders (and let's not forget the Devils) be successful in this market? Is there enough revenue possible? </p> <p>Having the Islanders closer to Manhattan might help rekindle that rivalry \u2013 especially since it'll now be one that's even more about a battle between boroughs, too. And could the size limitations on the Barclays Center help? The arena only has a 14,500 capacity for hockey games, putting it below even the Winnipeg Jets home rink, the MTS Centre, which sits at just 15,000. </p> <p>Oh, and as for the name and logo? They're staying, apparently.</p>",
  "<p>More middle-class voters regard themselves as leftwing than do working-class voters, and working-class people show less support for overseas aid and immigration than middle-class voters, according to a new YouGov poll, commissioned by Progress, the Labour pressure group.</p> <p>The findings arguably underline the complex challenge Ed Miliband faces in reconnecting with people who were once described as Labour's core supporters.</p> <p>Peter Kellner, the YouGov president, said: \"While middle-class voters divide evenly on immigration, working-class voters divide more than two-to-one in favour of stopping all immigration.</p> <p>\"Likewise with overseas aid: middle-class voters divide evenly on whether to end it altogether, while working-class voters back the idea by two-to-one.\"</p> <p>On welfare reform, the picture is more nuanced. Overall, middle-class voters show 53% to 38% in favour of reducing welfare benefits for the unemployed, but working-class voters came out 45% to 40% against the idea.</p> <p>However, skilled workers, as opposed to those with unskilled jobs or relying on state benefits (DEs), are as keen on reducing benefits as the ABs and C1s; it is the DEs who come out against the idea. This policy is also supported in every region except the north of England and Scotland.</p> <p>Kellner concludes: \"Opposition to lower benefits is greatest among those who most fear losing out, or are currently relying on state benefits \u2013 scant sign there of working-class solidarity.\"</p> <p>The polling, based on aggregate data compiled in the summer and autumn, shows proportionately more middle-class people (36%) describe themselves as leftwing than working-class (28%).</p> <p>Far more DE voters disown any political affiliation.</p> <p>The results lead Kellner to conclude that although working-class voters are still more likely to vote Labour than Conservative, this has more to do with tribe and tradition, than ideology or policy.</p> <p>He is more broadly a strong advocate of the view that Labour will win from the centre.</p> <p>The polling also shows working-class voters regard stopping immigration as the single most important of seven policies put to them.</p> <p>Among C2 and DE voters a ban on all immigration is supported by 67% to 26%. Among middle-class voters (ABC1 voters) support is evenly divided with 49% to 46% opposed. On ending all overseas aid, the proposition is supported by C2 and DE voters by 58% to 31% and opposed by AB voters by 48% to 47%. On reducing welfare benefits to the unemployed ABs support the measure by 53% to 38% and C2s by a similar margin of 52 to 33%. Only DEs oppose the measure by a considerable 56 to 29%.</p> <p>Across the classes there is uniform opposition to income tax increases to protect public services. There is also general opposition to spending cuts.</p> <p>There is little class difference in overall support shown for gay marriage, nationalising the rail companies or putting workers on company boards.</p> <p>Progress director Robert Philpott said: \"These results show the need for Labour to avoid sectional appeals targeted at specific classes. As it did in the runup to 1997 election, the party needs to develop policies and a message that can appeal across a broad cross-class coalition. Ed Miliband's notion of one nation Labour offers the opportunity to do just that.\"</p>",
  "<p>Jim Jones is trying to quiet the Camden Town crowd. \"Imagine,\" he tells them, \"you're a teenager having sex in your bedroom and you don't want your mum to find out.\" In that sentence is captured the essence of his Revue: Jones and guitarist Rupert Orton (brother of Beth) are old enough to be the parents of said teenager, but they're&nbsp;still in thrall to the sex and danger of&nbsp;rock'n'roll.</p> <p>And so, with no embarrassment, legs are splayed and instruments are thrust outwards.

  "<p>Two gay Jamaicans have launched a legal challenge to colonial-era laws, which in effect criminalise homosexuality, on the grounds that they are unconstitutional and promote homophobia throughout the Caribbean.</p> <p>The landmark action, supported by the UK-based Human Dignity Trust, is aimed at removing three clauses of the island's Offences Against Persons Act of 1864, commonly known as the \"buggery\" laws.</p> <p>The battle over the legislation \u2013 blamed by critics for perpetuating a popular culture of hatred for \"batty boys\", as gay men are derided in some dancehall music \u2013 has also drawn a British lawyer into the debate, who said that Jamaica should not follow the legislative example of the UK.</p> <p>The legal challenge is being taken to the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, which is modelled on the European Court of Human Rights. Jamaica is not a full member and any ruling would only be advisory and not binding; it would, nonetheless, send out a strong signal of international disapproval.</p> <p>When the Jamaican prime minister, Portia Simpson Miller, was elected last December, she said she would hire a gay person to serve in her cabinet and condemned discrimination. Despite early sympathetic signals, her government has not attempted to repeal the laws.</p> <p>The Offences Against Persons Act does not formally ban homosexuality but clause 76 provides for up to 10 years' imprisonment, with or without hard labour, for anyone convicted of the \"abominable crime of buggery committed either with mankind or any animal\". Two further clauses outlaw attempted buggery and gross indecency between two men.</p> <p>Jamaica has one of the highest murder rates in the world. Murders of gay men are increasing, according to Dane Lewis, executive director of the Jamaica Forum of Lesbians, All-Sexuals and Gays (J-Flag), who is one of those petitioning the commission.</p> <p>\"This year alone there have been nine [murders],\" he said. \"The violence in Jamaica is having a spillover effect on other parts of the Caribbean: St Lucia now has a murder or so every year.\"</p> <p>One prominent victim was John Terry, the British honorary consul in Montego Bay, who was found dead in 2009 having been beaten and strangled. A note left on his body read: \"This is what will happen to all gays.\"</p> <p>Many gay Jamaicans have fled abroad, some to the UK. In 2002, two gay Jamaican men were granted asylum in the UK because their lives were in danger from \"severe homophobia\" in the Caribbean.</p> <p>Senior Jamaican police officers have in the past dismissed killings as the result of gay-on-gay \"crimes of passion\" \u2013 an interpretation disputed by civil rights groups.</p> <p>In a House of Lords debate this week on the treatment of homosexual men and women in the developing world, the Conservative Lord Lexden said a \"wave of persecution and violence has been suffered by gay people connected with [J-Flag]\". Intolerance of homosexuality, he noted, was a legacy of the British empire: \"Today, 42 of the 54 nations of the Commonwealth criminalise same-sex relations.\"</p> <p>Jonathan Cooper, a London barrister who is the chief executive of the Human Dignity Trust, said: \"We want to ensure that Jamaica satisfies its international human rights treaty obligations. We are supporting J-Flag in this case.</p> <p>\"These, and two accompanying cases supported by Aids-Free World, are the first cases before the Inter-American Commission but the issue is clear in international human rights law.\"</p> <p>The UN's International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, to which Jamaica is a signatory, protects private adult, consensual sexual activity.</p> <p>J-Flag has also received free pro-bono advice from the UK City law firm Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer in drawing up their legal challenge.</p> <p>One of the main bodies arguing to preserve the Offences Against Person Act is the Lawyers' Christian Fellowship in Jamaica (which has no connection to the UK Lawyers' Christian Fellowship).</p> <p>Paul Diamond, a British barrister and Evangelical Christian who specialises in religious discrimination cases, took part in a debate on Jamaica's laws at the University of the West Indies last December.</p> <p>\"[Jamaicans] feel they are being pressurised by the UK and US governments in terms of visas and aid grants to modify their position [on homosexuality], which they say is morally based,\" Diamond told the Guardian. \"I told them that England has totally failed in finding any balance between religious [and civil] freedoms.\"</p> <p>The prime minister's office in Jamaica did not respond to enquiries.</p> <h2>Anti-gay laws in the Caribbean</h2> <p>While Jamaica holds the crown for being the worst place in the Americas to be gay, the rest of the English-speaking Caribbean has a long history of homophobia. The British colonial administration entrenched \"buggery laws\" in its colonies, many of which remain in some form.</p> <p>The Bahamas criminalises same-sex activity between adults in public, although not in private. Jamaican, Guyanese and Grenadian laws do not mention lesbianism, but Trinidad and Tobago, Barbados, Antigua and St Lucia prohibit all acts of homosexuality.</p> <p>Trinidad and Tobago's state-sponsored homophobia extends further through immigration laws prohibiting \"prostitutes, homosexuals or persons living on the earnings of prostitutes or homosexuals, or persons reasonably suspected as coming to Trinidad and Tobago for these or any other immoral purposes\" from entering the country.</p> <p>Although the law is not enforced, there were attempts from Christian groups to prevent Elton John headlining the Tobago Jazz Festival in 2007. Church leaders were worried about the singer's potential influence on the \"impressionable minds\" of the island's young people.</p> <p>Anguilla, the British Virgin Islands, the Cayman Islands, Montserrat, and the Turks and Caicos islands were forced to repeal their sodomy laws in 2000, when Britain issued an order to its overseas territories, which it had to do to meet international treaty obligations.</p>",

Campaign groups believe the extreme weather of 2011 and 2012 \u2013 with hurricanes, heat waves, floods, droughts , wildfires in the US and the epic melting in the Arctic \u2013 are behind a sharp rise in the number of Americans who believe in global warming over the last two years.</p> <p>Some 70% of Americans believe in climate change, according to a <a href=\"http://environment.yale.edu/climate/files/Climate-Beliefs-September-2012.pdf\">Yale survey last month</a>, up 13% from 2010.</p> <p>As Sandy barrels in, climate messaging firms and campaign groups are putting out primers on the connections between climate change and extreme weather, and the rising costs over the last few years of dealing with monster storms.</p> <p>The challenge of course is whether either Obama or Romney will care to make that link on the campaign trail.</p> </blockquote>  <p>The question, Suzanne writes, is how much climate change might be to blame for storms like Sandy:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Climate change certainly makes strong storms even stronger. There is ample evidence that global warming is responsible for the increasing intensity of Atlantic hurricanes and a longer hurricane season \u2013 but no single storm can be attributed to global warming.</p> <p>Five of the top north Atlantic hurricanes ever recorded occurred in the last eight years, including Katrina, Rita, and Ivan.</p> <p>Hurricanes are now producing greater storm surges, heavier rain and more flooding than in the past as evidenced by Irene last year, which caused widespread flooding in the north-east, and Debby last June, which produced up to 2ft of rain in some locations in Florida.</p> <p>\u201cClimate change has led to warmer oceans and a warmer environment and more moisture for these storms which makes them more intense than they otherwise would be,\u201d said Kevin Trenberth, senior scientist at the National Centre for Atmospheric Research in Colorado.</p> <p>The warmer atmosphere and sea surface temperatures provide extra fuel for those storms. That extra boost, combined with heavy and prolonged rain, stronger storm surges and coastal erosion in places, mean severe storms can pack a punch even relatively far inland. \u201cWhat it really does is that it gives rise to a greater risk of flooding,\u201d Trenberth said.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-10-26T19:42:19.579Z\">at 8.42pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-508ade8bb5793e5495b45138\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-26T19:03:40.106Z\">8.03pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Mayor Michael Bloomberg</strong> has just held a news conference about how New York City is preparing for Sandy. </p>  <p>Bloomberg said Sandy is expected sometime Monday.

  "<p>\"Grandpa Wen,\" China's state media call him. Or \"The Premier of the People\". To many ordinary Chinese, China's 70-year-old premier Wen Jiabao is a series of endearing images \u2013 a grey-haired, bespectacled man playing basketball with primary school children, or bowing deeply to the families of natural disaster victims.</p> <p>A <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/26/business/global/family-of-wen-jiabao-holds-a-hidden-fortune-in-china.html\" title=\"\">report in Friday's New York Times</a> gave Wen's populist image a makeover. The paper found Wen's family has accumulated more than $2.7 billion (\u00a31.68bn) in assets, much of it from investments in companies that were directly influenced by Wen's position.</p> <p>Analysts say Wen's role as the Chinese Communist party's friendliest face \u2013 a counterpoint to the stodgy, unsmiling bureaucrats that fill its ranks \u2013 has made the disclosure of his family's wealth a deep embarrassment to the leadership.</p> <p>\"Someone like Wen is a very good focal point for the party's overall narrative \u2013 that it's the only vehicle that can maintain the prosperity that the Chinese people have achieved over the last 15 or 20 years,\" said Rana Mitter, an expert on Chinese politics at Oxford University.</p> <p>Wen has made much of his humble origins \u2013 that he grew up in poverty in Tianjin city before getting a postgraduate geology degree in Beijing. His mother, a teacher, raised him amid the turmoil of the Sino-Japanese war. \"The untold suffering in the days of old China left an indelible imprint on my tender mind,\" he told the National People's Congress in 2003.</p> <p>In his 42-year political career, Wen has gained the reputation of an intellectual. He regularly opens speeches with lines from ancient Chinese poets and scholars, expounding on the virtues of perseverance and commitment to duty. While visiting President Yoweri Museveni of Uganda in 2006, he <a href=\"http://www.chinese-embassy.org.za/eng/zxxx/t280214.htm\" title=\"\">improvised a poem</a>: \"Fifty years of journey sharing weal and woe / Brings Chinese and African hearts closer and ever so,\" he said, according to the website of China's embassy in South Africa.</p> <p>He has long been an ambiguous figure for China-watchers. Some say he could be a crusader for reform; others call him a figurehead. He has expressed support for anti-corruption legislation in speeches around the world. He visited Sichuan after a 2008 earthquake thought to have killed 90,000 people and has met migrant workers during labour unrest.</p> <p>When a high speed train crash in the coastal city Wenzhou in June 2011 became a focal point for popular discontent with the speed of China's development, Wen was quickly on the scene. \"I believe related departments will seriously learn a lesson from this incident,\" he said at a press conference after inspecting the crash site. \"If there is any corruption exposed in the investigation, we will handle it according to the law, and the consequences will be severe.\"</p> <p>Yet if Wen has enacted any real political reform, none of it is obvious. After his visit to the earthquake zone, the government harshly cracked down on activists demanding a list of the dead. His goal of improving migrant worker rights has gone largely unrealised. Corruption in China is still endemic, the country's wealth gap yawning, its thuggish state security apparatus stronger than ever.</p> <p>Analysts usually maintain one of two views on Wen, according to Mitter. \"One is that he's been genuinely trying to push for reform within the party, but has been isolated and not been allowed to succeed because of vested interests,\" he said. \"The other is that this is essentially a piece of self-aggrandizement by Wen.\"</p> <p>Analysts debate the importance of a photograph showing Wen standing alongside former premier Zhao Ziyang while visiting Tiananmen Square student protestors in 1989. While some say that Wen's proximity to Zhao \u2013 a staunch reformer who was placed under house arrest after the protests \u2013 shows his sympathy for the students' cause, others say it betrays nothing but a strong survival instinct, an impressive ability to further his career despite a dangerous political association.</p> <p>Wen has scored at least one big victory in his time as premier: he is widely considered instrumental in sacking the Chongqing party chief Bo Xilai \u2013 a charismatic leader with a flair for Mao-era grandiosity \u2013 triggering the party's most dramatic political upheaval in decades.</p> <p>\"The new problems that have cropped up in China's society will not be fundamentally resolved, and such historical tragedies as the Cultural Revolution may happen again,\" he told a political meeting in March, hours before Bo was stripped of his post.</p>",

Still, it's worth a look: streaming music and talk radio, as well as the ability to record some shows for listening at your leisure.</p> <h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.jaxtr.androidvoip\">Jaxtr Voice: Cheap Int'l Calls</a></h2> <p>Voice-over-IP apps are ten-a-penny on Android, so can Jaxtr's new international-focused one cut through the clutter? It makes calls via 3G or Wi-Fi, as well as offering access numbers in 40 countries when neither is available. Some countries can be called for free, and online voicemail is included.</p> <h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.co_mm\">Free calls - Comm</a></h2> <p>Also covered in this week's iOS roundup, this is a curveball app from DeNA, which is best known for its social mobile games. Comm is another Voice-over-IP app, which adds photo-sharing and instant messaging into the mix.</p> <h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=co.beermap.beermap\">BeerMap.co</a></h2> <p>Remember the days on iOS when virtual pints of beer were all the rage? BeerMap is an app that wants to get Android users supping pints in the real world: a \"social beer tasting app\" for drinkers to share their ratings and notes for both tipples and pubs in the UK.</p> <h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.imageshack.skypath\">Skypath for Android</a></h2> <p>Skypath is the latest social photography app for Android, which runs alongside a desktop application of the same name. The idea: it synchronises photos between your Android device, your PC and the ImageShack storage service.</p> <h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.arxnet.rightmove\">Rightmove Samsung TV Remote</a></h2> <p>This is a niche app, but it's an interesting sign of the way things may develop for other apps in the near future. It has one use: \"Use your Android as a remote for the RightmoveTV app on Samsung 2012 SmartTVs\", developed by Rightmove itself, the online property site. The app can also send texts and call individual estate agents, and share details of properties on social networks.</p> <h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.alibaba.intl.android.apps.poseidon\">The Official Alibaba App</a></h2> <p>Hong Kong-based B2B marketplace Alibaba now has an Android app for searching its millions of products, browsing suppliers and contacting them with enquiries. The app also saves favourite products for later reference.</p> <h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.fabercourtial.Limeseum\">Limeseum</a></h2> <p>This is an app tied to one specific location: the ancient Roman fort at Ruffenhofen in Germany, but I thought it was worth including for its glimpse at how augmented reality technology is good for more than adverts jumping out of chocolate bar wrappers. Designed to be used while walking around the fort, it offers videos, panoramic pics and text about the site.</p> <h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=kr.netsco.artist\">Timeline - Art Museum</a></h2> <p>And more culture here: an app that offers paintings from 80 masters (Da Vinci, Van Gogh and Monet included) arranged in a timeline from the Renaissance through to the present day. Every work and artist gets their own profile, although the developer appears to be hoping the use of some copyrighted works will squeak through \"in accordance with fair use principles\", which could be interesting.</p> <h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.doodlejoy.studio.doodleworld\">Doodle Joy</a></h2> <p>Android-owning parents have an increasing collection of good apps for their children to use, with Doodle Joy being a welcome addition to the list. It's a drawing app for kids offering more than 20 digital brushes, and the ability to save the process of drawing, not just the final image.</p> <h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.orbitz.hotel\">Hotels by Orbitz</a></h2> <p>Hotel-bookings is a hot area on all smartphones at the moment, with Orbitz's new app the latest trying to help people book a room and get a discount. In this case, the latter can include up to 50% off listed prices, with the promise of thousands of hotels to choose from globally.</p> <h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.droid.fusionpro\">FusionPro Music Player Beta</a></h2> <p>There's always scope for improvement of the default music players in smartphones and tablets. FusionPlayer is trying to make Android's \"simpler and easier\", with a single screen containing the entire player. It also pulls in lyrics and YouTube videos.</p> <h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ben.com.twythm\">Twythm</a></h2> <p>Another music app here, but one focused on social sharing. In fact, it's focused on Twitter: a quick way for Android devices to share details of the song currently being played with friends.</p> <h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.aviary.android.feather.plugins.stickers.american_football\">Aviary Stickers: Football</a></h2> <p>This is an add-on pack for Aviary's Photo Editor \u2013&#xa0;and really an excuse to write again about that app, which is excellent. Like the company's other packs (grunge, nostalgia etc) it provides 15 virtual stickers with which to customise photos, then share them with friends. The football is the American variety, by the way.</p> <h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.skp.adf.photopunch\">Photo Punch</a></h2> <p>Photo punch? Nothing to do with violence. Instead, this is about cutting out a portion of one photo, then pasting it into another. Cat head on human bodies, that kind of thing. Memes. Anyway, it's a quirky take on photo manipulation that appears to be sprouting wings on the Google Play store.</p> <h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=air.com.kenavision.app001\">Educam Classroom Viewer</a></h2> <p>Another app that's a sign of how technology is developing \u2013&#xa0;this time in classrooms. It's an app for viewing, capturing, annotating and sharing live images from a document camera, visualiser or digital microscope, for use in classrooms where students have their own devices to hand to watch on.</p> <h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nbdapps.instamessage\">InstaMessage</a></h2> <p>\"Less talking more wub wub\" reads one of the sample messages in the Google Play screenshots for this photo-manipulation app, designed to be used with Instagram. The idea: use themes created by its designers with your own words, posting to Instagram but also Facebook, WhatsApp, Twitter and Pinterest.</p> <h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=appinventor.ai_appliedautism.GreenDay\">GreenDay - Autism Behavior</a></h2> <p>Actually, this is an app for all children, not just those with autism \u2013&#xa0;even if the latter are its initial target group. For parents, it's about putting in place a behaviour plan for a child, who earns tokens for behaving well, with a colour-based system letting them know when they need to moderate their actions. The app supports up to three children.</p> <h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.jcsmdroid.pedometerplus\">Pedometer Plus</a></h2> <p>Not just a Pedometer! It's a Pedometer Plus! What's the plus? That would be measuring more than just the number of steps you take: think calories, speed and time. It also tracks your routes using GPS, although the feature can be turned off if you prefer to save battery life.</p> <h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.newsblur\">NewsBlur</a></h2> <p>Flipboard and the rest mean it's tough for any new social news-reader app to get a foothold on the major smartphone platforms. NewsBlur is having a go though: a way to read articles via Google Reader, share and comment on them with friends, and see what other people with similar tastes are reading too.</p> <h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gratafy.app\">Gratafy</a></h2> <p>Another US-only app for now: an \"experience-based social gifting platform\". That means sending real things to friends as gifts via social networks: food, drinks and desserts at a range of venues, which can then be redeemed in those places by using the app.</p> <h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.movember.movembermobile\">Movember Mobile</a></h2> <p>It's nearly that time of year again, when men up and down the land start growing furry upper-lip slugs and raising money for charity. Movember now has an Android app too: helping people manage their fundraising campaigns, and post updates and photos on the Movember site.</p> <h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.magicsolver.halloween\">Halloween - 13 Free Apps</a></h2> <p>It's nearly Halloween. Is anyone really looking for \"free Halloween apps\" and an app to find them? That's what MagicSolver is hoping, with the promise of an unlucky 13 app recommendations in and around Halloween.</p> <h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.abtosoftware.vncclient\">abtoVNC Viewer for Android</a></h2> <p>This is a showcase for its developer's SDK for other developers, rather than an app for consumers. It's a viewer app for logging in to remote desktops, altering their settings and then working with files stored on the computer. There's lots of competition in this area, though.</p> <h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.askmedigital.HSA\">HSA Skin Cancer Awareness</a></h2> <p>This is very much a professional app: for hair and beauty staff. The idea being it helps them learn and recognise the signs of skin cancer among their clients. It ties into a wider skin cancer awareness campaign in the UK.</p> <p>That's our selection, but what new Android apps have you been using this week? Make your recommendations in the comments section.</p>",

  "<p>You can hear it from blocks away: the deafening beat of Pogrom, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/golden-dawn\" title=\"\">Golden Dawn</a>'s favourite band, blasting out of huge speakers by a&#xa0;makeshift stage. \"<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPigBDg8ydQ\" title=\"\">Rock for the fatherland</a>, this is our music, we don't want parasites and foreigners on our land\u2026\"</p> <p>It's a warm October evening and children on bicycles are riding up and down among the young men with crew cuts, the sleeves of their black T-shirts tight over pumped-up biceps, strolling with the stiff swagger of the muscle-bound. They look relaxed, off-duty. Two of them slap a&#xa0;handshake: \"Hey, fascist! How's it going?\"</p> <p>Trestle tables are stacked with Golden Dawn merchandise: black T-shirts bearing the party's name in Greek, Chrysi Avgi, the sigma shaped like the S on SS armbands; mugs with the party symbol, a&#xa0;Greek meander drawn to resemble a swastika; Greek&#xa0;flags and black lanyards, lighters and baseball caps. I lean over to talk to one woman stallholder, dressed in Golden Dawn black with thickly kohl-rimmed eyes, but as soon as she opens her mouth a man in a suit strides up: \"What are you writing? Are you a journalist? Tear that page out of your notebook. No, no, you can't talk to anyone.\"</p> <p>Tonight is the opening of the Golden Dawn office in Megara, a once prosperous farming town between Athens and Corinth. The Greek national socialist party polled more than 15% here \u2013 double the national average \u2013 in the June election, when <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/may/07/neo-nazi-golden-dawn-party-greece\" title=\"\">it won 18 seats in parliament</a>. (One was taken up by the former bassist with Pogrom, whose hits include Auschwitz and Speak Greek Or Die.)</p> <p>Legitimised by democracy and by the media, Golden Dawn is opening branches in towns all over Greece and regularly coming third in national opinion polls. Its black-shirted vigilantes have been beating up immigrants for more than three years, unmolested by the police; lately they've taken to attacking Greeks they suspect of being gay or on the left. MPs participate proudly in the violence. In September, three of them led gangs of black-shirted heavies through street fairs in the towns of Rafina and Messolonghi, smashing up immigrant traders' stalls with Greek flags on thick poles.</p> <p>Such attacks are almost never prosecuted or punished. Ask Kayu Ligopora, of the Athens Tanzanian Community Association, whose premises were vandalised by around 80 \"local residents\" on 25 September after police walked away. He's lived in Greece for 20 years; for the first time, he says, he's thinking about leaving. Or&#xa0;Hussain Ahulam, 22, who told me how four men with dogs and a metal crowbar left him bleeding and unconscious by the side of the road as he walked home one day. Or 21-year-old HH, a&#xa0;Greek citizen of Egyptian origin, who was beaten on 12 October by three men with chains as he stepped off the trolley bus, and whose sight may be damaged for good.</p> <p>Or ask <a href=\"https://twitter.com/manolis\" title=\"\">@manolis</a>, a blogger for <a href=\"http://www.lifo.gr/\" title=\"\">Lifo</a> magazine, who on 11 October went to photograph Golden Dawn's attack on a theatre showing <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/1999/aug/22/vanessathorpe.theobserver\" title=\"\">Terrence McNally's Corpus Christi</a>, which casts Christ and the apostles as gay men in Texas. He says four or five people surrounded him in front of the riot police, hit him and spat on him, and put a lit cigarette in his pocket. \"A known Golden Dawn MP follows me, punches me twice in the face, knocks me down,\" he tweeted. \"I lose my glasses. The MP kicks me. The police are exactly two steps away.\" Another MP, Ilias Panagiotaros, stood on the sidelines ranting in front of video cameras: \"Wrap it up, you little faggots. Wrap it up, arse-fuckers. You little whores, your time has come. You fucked Albanian arseholes.\" A third, Christos Pappas, was filmed releasing a man from police custody. He is the only one now under police investigation.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398419610\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/24/1351081796286/HH-a-Greek-of-Egyptian-or-008.jpg\" alt=\"HH, a Greek of Egyptian origin\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">HH, a Greek of Egyptian origin, was beaten by three men with chains.

A&#xa0;woman in a long green dress and high-heeled silver mules is choosing a black T-shirt; another asks the price of a Greek flag. Suddenly there's shouting, a thunder of boots on asphalt: 50 yards from the stage, a group of braves have pushed a&#xa0;man off a red motorbike and are kicking and punching him as he lies on the ground. His arms are protecting his head; I can hear the boots go in. No one stirs until an older member calls them off: \"Come back to our space, fellow fighters. The Leader is on his way.\" The Leader, Nikolaos Michaloliakos, squat in a baggy suit, threads his way through the crowd accompanied by the party's spokesman, Ilias Kasidiaris, a&#xa0;former commando with five criminal charges pending, famous abroad <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVH9LlgLSLU\" title=\"\">for assaulting two women candidates on TV in June</a>. On talkshows, Kasidiaris scowls and slouches like a&#xa0;delinquent teenager, but tonight he looks expansive, almost rock star cool. The office door is flanked by men in camouflage trousers, with crash helmets and Greek flags rolled around wooden staves; more stand guard on the balcony and the roof.</p> <p>Standing among the citizens of Megara as Michaloliakos addresses them, I feel as if I've slipped into a parallel universe. As a Greek, I've known these people all my life: middle-aged women with coiffed hair and well-upholstered bosoms, men in clean white shirts and neatly belted trousers. They're the people who run the cafes and corner shops; who work hard every day, often at two or three jobs; who pinch children's cheeks and won't let you pay for your coffee; who were always cynical about politicians' promises. I&#xa0;never thought they could fall prey to fascist oratory. Yet here they are, applauding Michaloliakos as he barks and roars, floodlit against a low white building next to the petrol station. We could almost be back in the 1940s, between the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axis_occupation_of_Greece\" title=\"\">Axis occupation</a> and the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_Civil_War\" title=\"\">civil war</a>, when former collaborators whipped up hatred of the left resistance.</p> <p>Michaloliakos has his populism down pat. His message is pride, and purity, and power. He lambasts the other parties for selling out the country, for their lies and corruption, with special attention to the left party, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-17980954\" title=\"\">Syriza</a>. Golden Dawn, he says, are the only patriots, the only ones who haven't dipped their hands in the honeypot. He praises Megara, which used to supply all of Greece, \"before we started eating Egyptian potatoes, Indian onions and Chilean apples\". Then he turns to \"the two million illegal immigrants who are the scourge of this country\", who sell heroin and weapons with impunity. \"Voting for us is not enough,\" he says. \"We want you to join the struggle for Greece. Don't rent your house to foreigners, don't employ them\u2026 We want all illegal foreigners out of our country, we want the usurers of the troika and the IMF out of our country for ever.\"</p> <p>After the fireworks and the flares and the national anthem, Efthimia Pipili, 67, gives me her reaction. \"Foreigners have come twice to my house to rob me in the night,\" she says. \"If I&#xa0;didn't have my rottweiler, I'd be dead by now. I&#xa0;used to vote for <a href=\"http://http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panhellenic_Socialist_Movement\" title=\"\">Pasok</a> [the Panhellenic Socialist Movement]. Last time I voted for Tsipras [the leader of Syriza] because I thought he was different. But Tsipras wants to protect the foreigners. I have \u20ac100 to last for the next three weeks. I owe \u20ac400 to the electricity company; they're going to cut me off. Why shouldn't I be for Golden Dawn, my love?\"</p> <p>Golden Dawn is many things: a party, a&#xa0;movement, a subculture; a&#xa0;vigilante force; a&#xa0;network inside the police and the judiciary. Vasilis Mastrogiannis of the Democratic Left, a former senior police officer turned politician, describes it frankly as \"a&#xa0;criminal organisation\". New Democracy MP Dimitrios Kyriazidis, who founded the Greek police union, calls it a \"political excrescence\". \"Because of my past in the police, I know very well where these people come from,\" Kyriazidis says. \"Most declare their profession as 'businessman'. But one has to pause at that.\"</p> <p>The party's founder and leader, Nikolaos Michaloliakos, served time in the late 1970s for assault and illegal possession of guns and explosives. While inside, he met members of the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_military_junta_of_1967-1974\" title=\"\">military junta that ruled Greece from 1967 to 1974</a>, but his political views, as expressed in Golden Dawn, the magazine he started when he was released, were well to the right of theirs. Breaking the boundaries of \"acceptable\" rightwing nationalism, Michaloliakos published paeans to Adolf Hitler, arguing that Greece should have been at the side of the Axis in the second world war. The magazine, its covers periodically adorned with portraits of the F\u00fchrer and his acolytes, served up a weird amalgam of Nazi propaganda, antisemitism, traditional nationalism and pagan fantasy. The party that now courts and counts on the Orthodox church once advocated a return to \"the faith of the Aryans\" \u2013 the Olympian gods \u2013 claiming that Christianity had \"grafted Jewish obscurantism on to the trunk of European civilisation\". In the one interview I was allowed with a Golden Dawn official, MP Panagiotis Iliopoulos told me that, as a young man, the magazine expressed his ideas completely. Have the party's views changed since then? \"Not at all,\" he said. \"There are no neo-Nazi articles in the magazine. Only historical ones.\"</p> <p>Golden Dawn first drew attention in the early 1990s, when the dispute over the name of the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia fuelled an upsurge of Greek nationalism. It found fertile ground in the anti-immigrant sentiment that spread through Greece with the first wave of migrants from Albania and eastern Europe; it gathered strength as the failures of Greek and European policy turned Greece into a lobster trap for refugees and migrants coming from Asia, Africa and the Middle East. As thousands struggled to survive beside impoverished Greeks in neighbourhoods shattered by the economic crisis, Golden Dawn vigilantes began to \"clear\" Athenian squares with fists and clubs and knives; to storm unofficial mosques; to sell protection to shopkeepers; to escort old ladies to the supermarket. In 2009 the party polled a mere 0.29% in the national election. In 2010, Michaloliakos was elected to the Athens city council; he celebrated his arrival with a fascist salute.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398419611\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/24/1351081380943/Golden-Dawn-MPs-008.jpg\" alt=\"Golden Dawn MPs\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Golden Dawn MPs.

In June, many voted for Golden Dawn as a protest against the parties that brought the country down: \"I want them in parliament to beat the others up.\" Now they are turning to it because hope is exhausted; because things are out of control and they want someone to take charge; because it's \"doing something\". \"It's not that Greece is going to be saved,\" one voter said to me. \"Greece can't be saved.\" What, then?</p> <p>The Golden Dawn office in downtown Athens is open three evenings a week. Most of the visitors are middle-aged women with dull eyes and sunken cheeks, faces too old for their bodies, hardened, tired expressions. More than 50 come in an hour. Quietly, they ask the bouncers, \"Are they giving out food inside?\" \"Third floor,\" the bouncers say; but most of the women come out empty-handed save for a&#xa0;mauve piece of paper with the Golden Dawn logo on it. There's only enough today for voters from this ward; they'll announce the next distribution on a poster, in the papers, if you phone.</p> <p>Away from the door, Maria Kirimi tells me she's been locked out of her flat with all her things inside since 29 July; the family are crowded at her mother's now, seven people surviving on \u20ac400 a&#xa0;month. \"We're the living dead,\" she says. Isn't she troubled by Golden Dawn's violence? \"The boys in the black shirts are the only ones I'm not scared of. I feel they'll protect me.\" I&#xa0;ask her mother, old enough to remember the junta, what she thinks of their far-right views. \"I heard Michaloliakos say on TV that their sign isn't Hitler's sign but a&#xa0;patriotic one,\" she says, and then looks down at her feet. \"It does upset me a&#xa0;bit. But I haven't heard of anyone else giving out food.\"</p> <p>For the young people drawn into its inner circle, Golden Dawn means much more. Vetta has Celtic crosses on her collar points, a pack of Stuyvesants and a can of Red Bull clutched in her left hand. Her kohl-rimmed eyes dart back and forth as she speaks, but she is open, friendly. The 33-year-old says she helped to \"clear\" Aghios Panteleimon square three years ago and was stunned by people's gratitude. She's a&#xa0;member now, one of 20 chosen each year for their contribution to the cause and given lessons in ideology and behaviour: \"We have to welcome everybody, to be polite but serious.\" There's a dress code for women \u2013 no heels, low-cut tops or bare backs \u2013 and a growing Women's Front, which offers training in self-defence. \"But there's no difference between men and women here. We all sweep and mop. And, yes, the men make coffee.\"</p> <p>The Golden Dawn office in industrial Aspropyrgos is in a flat above an empty garage, next to the old elevated motorway. The stairs are lined with crash helmets, black shields and Greek flags rolled on to wooden staves, ready to snatch up at a moment's notice. The walls are hung with the slogans of Greek nationalism \u2013 \"Macedonia is Greek soil\" \u2013 and a&#xa0;blown-up photograph of Golden Dawn supporters fighting the riot police. Arete Demestika \u2013 six months pregnant, ponytail down to her waist, earrings like black roses \u2013 waxes lyrical in praise of the party: \"It's an attitude, a&#xa0;way of life, it's what's called Greece. It awakens new parts of you and makes you stronger, it arms you with knowledge, it's a secret school. We learn our true history, the lore of the nation, because the Greeks are a superior race. And it's given me my family \u2013 I met my husband here \u2013 and made me feel I'm not alone in the struggle for our country.\"</p> <p>But outside, as the sun goes down, 27-year-old Costas, a black-booted Golden Dawn cadre, slips out from under the rhetoric and speaks in his own words. He's an inspector now in the Eleusis oil refineries, but that's not his vocation. He's a&#xa0;craftsman, a marble carver; he used to work at <a href=\"http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/404\" title=\"\">the Acropolis</a>, but the pay was terrible and you couldn't get a decent contract if you weren't in the right party. His face softens and sweetens as he talks about working the marble, learning the craft as a boy, and I realise that he comes from a&#xa0;village I know well. Suddenly we're two people \u2013 two Greeks \u2013 talking about a place we love, a place full of memories, almost as if things were normal.</p> <p>Deliberately, inexorably, Golden Dawn is moving into the gaps left open by the crippled Greek state. Its strategy is a blend of seduction and extortion, the exploitation of need backed by the threat of violence. To its existing \"solidarity projects\" \u2013 \"Food for Greeks only\" and \"Blood for Greeks only\" \u2013 the party has now added a&#xa0;third: \"Jobs for Greeks only\". Golden Dawn members are visiting workshops and factories, counting and publicising the number of foreign workers there, \"encouraging\" employers to hire Greeks instead. But its biggest success has been the provision of \"security\", with the collusion of the authorities: the intimidation of migrants, protection of Greek shops, vigilante patrols.</p> <p>Adept at spectacle, the party claims new territory with a show of black-shirted strength, fireworks and flares and fanfare, masculine energy. Physical fitness is a big part of its culture. There are Golden Dawn gyms that don't admit foreigners; Golden Dawn security firms. MP Panagiotaros owns a shop called Phalanga that sells military memorabilia; bovver boots and black gloves; ultra football shirts; kit by Pit Bull and Hooligan. Members of the military junta beam from photos on the wall. The heavy stuff is said to be kept in a back room.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398419612\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/24/1351082236610/Lawyer-Yianna-Kourtovik-008.jpg\" alt=\"Lawyer Yianna Kourtovik\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Yianna Kourtovik acts for victims of racial attacks.

It's common knowledge that if you want to get squatters out of your flat, you call Golden Dawn, not the police, who at best will quietly pass you a Golden Dawn telephone number. The story has become a staple of dinner-party conversation; in the version I heard from unemployed journalist Julia Iliakopoulou, the Golden Dawn heavies who cleared the Pakistanis out of her friend's flat by \"beating them black and blue\" made them clean it up and paint it afterwards. \"Don't upset yourself,\" they said. \"We're Greeks helping Greeks.\"</p> <p>It's hard to measure just <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/video/2012/oct/26/golden-dawn-greece-police-video\">how deeply Golden Dawn has penetrated the police</a>. In Athens wards where the police vote in large numbers, the party polled 19-24% last summer; Panagiotaros crows that 50-60% of the force is now with the movement. What's obvious is that rightwing violence almost always goes unchecked, even when it happens under officers' noses or on camera. Early in October, anti-fascist protesters told me they had been tortured in the Athens police headquarters: burned with a cigarette lighter; forced to strip naked, bend over and spread their buttocks; filmed by officers who said they'd give the pictures to Golden Dawn. As I&#xa0;tried to interview some of them in a public lobby of the Athens courthouse, an officer grabbed me by the arm and pulled me roughly away. A police spokesperson denied the protesters' allegations.</p>      <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-398365913\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2012/10/25/1351185351838/Golden-Dawn-supporter-015.jpg\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/brightcove/2012/11/7/121025GoldenDawnFinal-16x9.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/connectedTV/1280/2012/11/7/121025GoldenDawnFinal-720.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/ad/121025GoldenDawnFinal/121025GoldenDawnFinal.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2012/11/7/121025GoldenDawnFinal_3gpLg16x9.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2012/11/7/121025GoldenDawnFinal_3gpSml16x9.3gp\"/> </video>   <p>Lawyer Yianna Kourtovik is familiar with Athens' most notorious police station, Aghios Panteleimon, which in 2010 was censured by a&#xa0;United Nations special rapporteur. She tells me that migrants trying to bring complaints of racist violence are routinely threatened with counter-charges and held in the cells; that local supporters of Golden Dawn wander freely in and out of rooms where complainants are giving statements; that she has had to prevent a friend of accused attackers from removing evidence. \"If that isn't giving cover to Golden Dawn, I&#xa0;don't know what is,\" she says. A few weeks ago, she was egged by Golden Dawn outside the station while the police looked on. Then: \"The other day, as I was walking down the road, two uniformed officers behind me started chanting, just loud enough for me to hear, 'Blood! Honour! Golden Dawn!'\"</p> <p>Why are such allegations never investigated? The usual response from those on the left is that Golden Dawn is \"the long arm of the state\" \u2013 that the government tolerates it to discourage immigration and keep people in a passive state of terror. But Golden Dawn is now much more of a threat to public order than protesters against austerity. There is also the fear of further alienating a desperately underfunded, underpaid and demoralised police force. New Democracy's Kyriazidis has led efforts to isolate Golden Dawn in parliament and, as a&#xa0;veteran union organiser, has intimate knowledge of the old militarised, post-junta police. But when I put the question to him, he hesitates: \"Now that Golden Dawn is a&#xa0;legal party in parliament, we can't do anything\u2026 If there is an investigation, it has to be done internally, to remove individuals who act in this way but not weaken the police as a whole.\"</p> <p>Through some lethal cocktail of intention, incompetence and inertia, the state has let a&#xa0;violent, anti-democratic force take control of law enforcement.</p> <p>Greece has bitter experience of what can happen when the far right infiltrates the security services. But the Democratic Left's Mastrogiannis thinks what is happening now is more dangerous than a&#xa0;coup. \"With the junta, you knew the enemy,\" he says. \"But these people are acting inside society, undermining the system from within. People doubt that democracy is alive. They see it as something that works only for the few, who exploit it to make money. And the circumstances are not transient. This situation could go on for 15, 20 years.\"</p> <p>Already Golden Dawn's success has moved the agenda to the right. Speaking in Paris last month, prime minister Antonis Samaras compared his country to 1930s Weimar. Trying to win back ground before the last election, he launched an ill-thought-out campaign (Xenios Zeus, or Zeus the Host) to round up illegal migrants, and spoke of taking back Greece's city centres. \"I try to tell myself that he meant from criminals,\" says Dr Yunus Mohammadi of the Greek Forum of Refugees, \"but really he meant from migrants.\"</p> <p>People quickly become inured to hate speech and violence. Panagiotaros now speaks openly of a \"new kind of civil war\" between Greeks and \"invaders\", nationalists and leftists. Two years ago, a friend who sits on the Athens city council came in late to find only one empty seat, beside Michaloliakos. He hesitated, but the Golden Dawn leader waved him over. \"Do sit down,\" he&#xa0;said. \"Fascism isn't contagious.\" At the time, we thought it funny.</p>",
  "<p>With the first Arctic blast of winter hitting parts of the UK today, it's time for cyclists to consider their winter riding tactics.</p> <p>Road or mountain bike? Wider tyres? Mudguards or not? Thermal socks and gloves? Or should we just all move to Holland where they are planning to <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-20041522\" title=\"\">introduce heated bike lanes?</a></p> <p>I contacted <a href=\"http://www.explorefairbanks.com/\" title=\"\">a group of bike commuters in Fairbanks, Alaska</a> \u2013 where there is already a couple of inches of snow on the ground and this weekend's forecast is for highs of -7 C (20F) - to find out how they survive the winter months.</p> <p>The group included Clint Adler, whose daily 16-mile winter commute includes a half-mile stretch over a frozen lake, and the university student Logan Stolpe who once climbed on his bike despite the thermometer reading -43F. He said:</p> <p>\"Between really wide tires, riding on snow, and cold grease in the bike components, the bike is really inefficient at that temperature, so it's not too hard to stay warm.\"</p> <p>All the cyclists rode <a href=\"http://gearjunkie.com/fat-bike-trend\" title=\"\">\"fat bikes\"</a> , like beefier, heavier mountain bikes with four-inch-wide tyres.</p> <p>\"These tyres are great for riding on packed snow, though in the summer I use conventional mountain bike tyres,\" said Adler, a manager at the Alaska Department of Transport who cycles home for lunch each day.</p> <p>All agreed on the following key points which are just as relevant for bike riders braving the UK elements this winter:</p> <p>\u2022 Keep warm. This isn't just about clothing. Body temperature can be regulated by level of effort. Too cold? Pedal harder. Overheating? Slow down for a mile or so. \"Though I still haven't found that sweet spot, I always end up being sweaty when I get to class,\" says Stolpe.</p> <p>\u2022 Protect your extremities. Stolpe wears a beaver fur hat with earflaps and keeps his feet warm with a pair of moosehide <a href=\"http://www.mukluks.com/\" title=\"\">mukluks.</a> (Personally, I prefer my Shimano RW80 winter shoes with Gore-Tex lining and neoprene ankle straps, but then I don't have to deal with sub-Arctic conditions on a daily basis).</p> <p>\u2022 Protect your bike. While salt isn't used to treat the roads in Fairbanks \u2013 \"it's usually too cold for it to work\" \u2013 it's worth treating your chainset, components and hubs with <a href=\"http://bicycletutor.com/lubricants/\" title=\"\">lubricant,</a> such as Fenwick's, to protect from grit and other road treatments employed by local councils. Post-ride degreasing is essential too, though this isn't necessarily essential in Alaska: \"The cold keeps the snow from melting \u2013 and your bike getting wet \u2013 and it also stops any dirt from sticking to your bike.\"</p> <p>\u2022 Riding on ice. This is best avoided if at all possible. In the UK, that means modifying your commuting or training route to avoid untreated roads, or danger spots such as shaded areas where black ice is likely to form. (My own winter training route is largely flat and I will dismount and walk down any hills if there is a risk of ice). But if it's unavoidable, you can prepare by switching to wider tyres and reducing their pressure to give your tread a great contact patch with the road surface. Then it's just a case of \"trying not to make a turn,\" says Skolpe. \"Just keep in a straight line until you're past it.\" And if you have to brake, use the rear brake. (The front brake transfers weight to the front wheel where the traction is minimal on ice). Also, be extra careful at stop signs. You might be able to come to a halt, but the motorist behind you might not.</p> <p>\u2022 Riding in snow. All the riders agreed the wide tyres on their \"fat bikes\" gave them a degree of \"flotation\" in the snow. For those of us on road or mountainbikes, Skolpe recommends keeping your speed up and allowing your front wheel - within reason - to follow the tracks and ruts left by motorised traffic. Alternatively, keep to the gutter where there is usually fresh, virgin snow to provide better traction.</p> <p>Some of the riders I spoke to are members of <a href=\"http://www.fairbankscycleclub.org/\" title=\"\">Fairbanks Cycle Club</a>, which has a full programme of winter rides scheduled until December (when temperatures can plummet to -25 C).</p> <p>Will you be continuing cycling during the winter, and if so what modifications will you be making to your bike and riding style?</p>",

Now if I need something I just type in a search on the Internet, find what I need and then look for the most competitive deal.<br>I can't really think what Argos's USP might be, there are so many differant outlets on the Net now days, the purchaser is spoilt for choice.</p> </blockquote> <p><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/19049118\"><strong>dash4cash</strong></a> added this insight:<br> </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I briefly worked with Argos last year on a study to re-invent their catalogue digitally and the core problem was the sheer cost and logistics of physical catalogue production. What I learnt was staggering: it takes months and months to produce (most of the year, in fact); the work is split across the internal Argos catalogue team and multiple design and production agencies; it costs a fortune to ship and print; it couldn't be updated easily; they can't add anymore products to it because it would become too heavy and unwieldy (which adds to shipping costs); and the catalogue was becoming less relevant with the rise of digital shopping.<br>In terms of competing with Amazon, they were plainly aware they were a catalogue business and, without it, they would possibly sink into obscurity if they couldn't compete with Amazon on price. But their advantage is their network of local stores, which is a effectively a decentralised network of stock warehouses; they can satisfy customers who want a product very quickly, faster and in a more predictable fashion than even same day shipping.<br>In short, how they redefine their catalogue and still use their store network is the challenge they'll have to surmount to safeguard their future</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/19041272\"><strong>BeckyDavidson</strong></a> said: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Digital or non-digital, they're a pretty cruddy outfit.<br>My last online purchase at Argos: Habitat salt and pepper grinders.

Car was fine but the recommended batteries were the wrong ones. Contacted Argos to tell them. They said thanks, we'll get that changed on the website but they wouldn't refund the batteries I had no use for as I'd got them in another store.<br>And the product photos are misleading too</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/19041794\"><strong>FortescueMundy</strong></a>: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Has anyone tried ordering something from Argos online?

I had to chase over the telephone more than once. The second time I rang I was told the unit had arrived, but was faulty. On reflection, I felt that this was just an excuse. I know that these days, retailers use the 'just in time' method of acquiring the goods they are going to sell, but they need to do better if they want to compete.<br>The next time I need a large article which Argos classes as 'home delivery' I will be going to somewhere like Curry's and taking it home with me.

I had a great, little portable in my bedroom with a tempermental ariel that we had to prop up on the headboard ... but no more. Now we have one tv in the front room - the sound fades in and out, and we get nothing at all in bad weather - and that is assuming there is anything to watch - I was happy with 4 channels. One of the saddest things was my mum saying recently that since she lost the use of her portable, she no longer has the choice to watch programmes she likes and she has to sit night after night staring at a screen controlled by someone else. She cannot be the only one.

Some great memories.<br>I first saw CEEFAX on August 15 1981. I was in a bar at the Copthorne Hotel at Copthorne in Sussex, waiting for a table in the restaurant. A keen cricket fan, I noticed the TV in the bar was showing the England Test match score. I pointed this out to my dad, also a cricket fan. My initial thought was how it brilliant ts was that the viewer could call up information, like a newspaper, on their television screen.<br>Earlier that year, we had only just \"gone\" colour at home, and bought a video recorder. Both the TV and the video had remote controls, even though the video remote was actually connected by a cable, which we would occasionally trip on. But the TV didn't have teletext.<br>It was two later - in 1983 - that we first had CEEFAX and ITV's rival service, Oracle, at home. The new TV we rented at that time also had stereo! We paid \u00a326 a month to rental firm DER, as I recall.<br>Back on CEEFAX - my favourite pages were 340 for the cricket, 302 for football, and the news pages.<br>In later life, as a journalist and government press officer, I used CEEFAX to keep me up to date with the news, professionally.<br>When I was a press officer at the Health and Safety Executive in the 90s and 00s, the HSE's director-general said he realised the importance of the out-of-hours press office when he saw three of the top five news stories on CEEFAX were about health and safety.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/19040812    \"><strong>Jimmyji</strong></a> added: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>For news I consulted Ceefax till the last day on BBC World program.

These failures are themselves hugely expensive over the life of an individual, but state care also costs as it is being given - up to \u00a350k a year. Grandparents are often the best option to provide stability, to love and nurture damaged children but the state needs to recognise that taking on the responsibility of a second family when entering retirement places a huge burden on people. The long-term savings where a child can be placed with a family member needs recognising with a statutory and non-means tested benefit. We do not means test the allowances paid to foster carers and owe it to family members caring for a child who would otherwise be in the care of the state to recompense them for the additional costs they are bearing.</p> </blockquote> <p> <br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/18986499\"><strong>Shelly James </strong></a> said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Many of the children taken on by kinship carers need specialised help, some are traumatised and some are dealing with bereavement, a lot are on the autistic spectrum and many suffer from Attachment Disorder. You would not ask a foster carer to do the same out of love, children still need to be clothed and fed. Foster children get fast track access to all the specialised help they need, Kinship carers on the other hand are in limbo, the children are treated as third class citizens. The financial side of things is only one side of the story, there is the emotional support needed as well. How would you deal with no longer being a grandparent but now the main carer, how would you approach the child's school when they are dealing with family dynamics but because of the various laws now in place, they don't actually know how to explain to other class members why a certain child does not live with their parents.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/18986982\"><strong>paulinemackie</strong></a> added:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>My husband and I had to take out a residency order for our grandaughter who was 18 months at the time,Mum unable to cope and a violent partner,I could'nt work as going through treatment at the time,it cost us \u00a3340 for the solicitor as residency is a civil action,a few weeks after we had her with us I needed major surgery,our wonderful health visitor got her into a day nursery for 5 hours a day,I was unable to get out due to op and ill health,I phoned social services to ask for help with transport to get our grandaughter to nursrey and back,the answer astonished me \" There is nothing we do when grandparents are in situ\"My husband was fortunate that he had a good boss who allowed him to leave work to take her to nursery and again to pick her up.<br>My husband only earned \u00a3240 a week and this was just 5 years ago,we contacted our MP as we had lost out on legal aid as civil actions had a high ceiling at the time,we almost qualified for it,however as my husband is also a volunteer coastguard,who's income from this was only paid by callout,some months maybe \u00a350 another \u00a35,she was very sorry,what she did manage to do was to get us Kinship Allowance from our LA the grand sum of \u00a323 a week,why did'nt the social worker tell me about this?<br>Our story ends well,within 18 months our daughter was able to function and care for the wee one and they have a brillaint relationship now,we did it out of love and care,but some extra income would have been handy.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/18990973\"><strong>northernglam</strong></a> said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>As a parent of a disabled child who has to give up my career to care - because the childcare and education services available were completely unsuitable, yes there is support, but carers allowance and DLA do not make up for the loss of 30 years earnings and the pension I would have had. \u00a355 a week carers allowance does not cover even 1/4 of the average mortgage now, let alone bills and food, running a car, replacing a washing machine or house repairs. Yes we manage, mainly because we had paid down a lot of the mortgage before the disabled child came along but we will have to live on a basic pension, our non disabled children cannot go on school trips and will not get any of the family support we expected to be able to give them to go to university.

The thing with drugs is that if they provide a benefit you are often borrowing from the future. They can help with concentration and have a mild positive stimulant. I thought they were brilliant at first. However they can be too much, and can make a person too stimulated, like having too much coffee (without the heart palpitations). I found that i talked too fast and since i work on the phones for a living it is much more conductive for me to just be normal and make sure i have enough sleep. You could use them to (and i think the military do) to prevent the need for sleep - if you did that too consistently i think you could do yourself real damage.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/19046725\"><strong>celiahc</strong></a> said:<br> </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I have to take Modafinil because I'm narcoleptic.

I could focus incredibly well on simpler tasks, but towards the end of the dose I would find it hard to hold a coversation with someone, and/or become irritable, as it says in the article. It leaves you feeling pyschologically, if not physically, burnt out, and therein lies the danger.<br>I still take it on occaision, but given the choice between Modafinal and proper time management and discipline you should go for the later, as in my opinion using the drug you trade mental quantity for quality.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/19049288\"><strong>GodsavetheKean</strong></a> said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><br>My housemates and I took modafinil last year for revision with varying results.

Firstly, what the author fails to state here is that modafinil is known to act as an anti-depressant - its not that you necessarily find the work more interesting, it is that your mood can be enhanced. In fact, for certina types of study, personally, i think that modafinil doesn't quite cut it. For mechanical - revision style - learning of facts etc., modafinil is a good drug, but when it comes to thinking about something properly and creatively, it isnt as effective. As a revision aid i think that it can certianly better performance ofr the average person. Another thing the author doesn't explicitly mention here is that this stuff can SERIOUSLY affect your sleep. If you take it at 8 in the morning, it can stop you sleeping that night, though im sure this varies from person to person.</p> </blockquote> <h2>'Parasite' porn websites stealing images and videos posted by young people</h2> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/oct/22/parasite-porn-websites-images-videos\">Children and young people are posting thousands of sexually explicit images of themselves and their peers online</a>, which are then being stolen by porn websites, according to the Internet Watch Foundation (IWF).</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/19005134\"><strong>trickywicked</strong></a> said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I can imagine as a teenager it can seem to be a bit of an adult thrill to use images of yourself to tease the opposite sex, without fully understanding the risks, it can seem so simple and almost safe to do.

If we all treated someone having naked pictures online as no big deal and just one of those things that can happen when a bit of risky fun goes wrong, like breaking your arm falling off your bike, then it wouldn't be a big deal. It is only because we tell people that it is somehow shameful or immoral to have images of your body available for all to see, even if it wasn't your intention, that people are hurt.

Then Brussels' biggest fear \u2013 a sweeping Tory-led renegotiation of the UK's EU membership terms \u2013 will not materialise, at least not any time soon. Instead, either as part of a Lib-Lab pact or majority government, the ball will be in Labour's court. So what will Labour do?</p> <p>In its 2015 election manifesto, the Conservative party could well promise renegotiation followed by a referendum on the result. It's far from set in stone, but increasingly likely. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/jul/01/conservatives-europe-referendum-cameron-eu\" title=\"\">Tory scepticism on Europe</a> as an issue may not allow David Cameron to get away with less. Labour effectively has two choices in how to respond:</p> <h2>Option one: <br></h2> <p><strong>Gamble on Europe not being an electoral issue.</strong> The thinking is that the EU always ranks low on the list of voters' concerns. National elections are never fought over Brussels. This is only partially true. Europe is a low priority if presented as a single issue \u2013 but the fact is, it's not. To varying degrees, it permeates other issues such as the economy, general trust in politicians and, most importantly, immigration (which consistently ranks high) \u2013 something that is likely to be established by the current government's \"<a href=\"http://www.fco.gov.uk/en/global-issues/european-union/balance-of-competences-review/\" title=\"\">balance of competences</a>\" review. Labour could try ducking the question in a campaign, but if the Tory party manages to successfully tap into the public's growing hostility towards the EU status quo \u2013 and with the eurozone's demands for greater integration unlikely to go away \u2013 it could really hurt Labour.</p> <h2>Option two:</h2> <p><strong>Promise a referendum of their own and so neutralise the Tories' pledge.</strong> The Labour party is unlikely to promise a public vote on a renegotiated EU deal \u2013 in large parts, they have already rubbished the idea \u2013 so it will have to be a straight in/out vote. The plan would be to call a referendum shortly after the elections, campaign for a yes, win the vote and move on to other business.</p> <p>This would be a massive gamble. The experiences of Fran\u00e7ois Hollande in France and <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-20019669\" title=\"\">Mariano Rajoy in Spain</a> show that political honeymoons are rare in today's EU politics. And heaven knows what Europe and the British economy will look like in 2015/2016, with the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/sep/13/eurozone-crisis-live\" title=\"\">Greek bailout package</a> set to expire, for example. If the referendum coincides with, say, a major new drive for more EU integration, with fresh demands put on the UK; and with a large number of Tories campaigning to leave (more likely in opposition), the British public may be pushed over the edge. It would then be Labour that unintentionally pulls the UK out of Europe.</p> <p>There may be some options in between, such as promising a referendum on forthcoming treaty changes \u2013 or pledges to pursue some milder reforms \u2013 but that will not sound overly convincing. And even leaving aside the referendum issue, Europe could hit Labour like a steam train: in a few years' time, the free-standing \"<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Fiscal_Compact\" title=\"\">fiscal treaty</a>\" is meant to be incorporated into the EU treaties. Will Labour nod that through, given that it effectively codifies the Bundesbank-style austerity, <a href=\"http://www.standard.co.uk/comment/comment/ed-balls-austerity-has-failed-in-europe--we-must-all-now-go-for-growth-7858045.html\" title=\"\">much criticised by Ed Balls</a> and co? Will it veto Germany's plans for a fiscal discipline commissioner, if they materialise? How will it relate to the evolving eurozone banking union and potential accompanying treaty changes? Will it tear up the coalition's EU \"<a href=\"http://www.adamsmith.org/blog/international/eu-referendum-lock\" title=\"\">referendum lock</a>\"? The more the eurozone agrees to do in common, the harder it will be for the UK to stand still. In fact, the eurozone crisis means that the status quo is no longer an option for Britain.</p> <p>The problem is that, fundamentally \u2013 and much like the Tory leadership itself \u2013 it does not yet appear that Labour knows what it wants for the UK in the multi-tier Europe that is developing. The previous Labour administration's policy of simply sitting in the \"euro waiting room\" and hoping the public would come along for the ride is no longer credible. However, the wing of the party that said it always opposed euro membership has yet to articulate what its alternative plan is.</p> <p>There are a lot of good and clever people on Labour's front benches. So far, it has suited Labour to treat Europe as a coalition pi\u00f1ata. Not for much longer. Labour now has the chance to develop a coherent and positive European vision and a plan of its own \u2013 designed around a flexible model for EU co-operation, in which Brussels does less in the UK, but does it better. Bank on the status quo or Tory splits, and both the party \u2013 and Europe \u2013 may be in for some unexpected surprises.</p>",
  "<p>When does <strong>Strictly Come Dancing</strong> turn into Dancing on Ice? When the professional dancers on the hit BBC show are given a pay freeze and threaten not to go on the annual UK tour. Some of the dancers feel they are \"household names in their own right\" and want to see their weekly pay boosted from \u00a35,500 a week to \u00a38,000. Apparently the BBC has stalled at \u00a36,000. One source told the Sun that the dancers \"work like dogs\" on the Strictly tour, and yet the celebrities get paid about \u00a313,000 a week.

Since launching the concept in 2009, they've hosted performances in UK cities including Belfast, Glasgow, Oxford, Manchester and London, and abroad \u2013 in Mumbai, Sydney, Mexico City and New York.</p> <p>Offer's three-part request taps into what living-room gigs are all about \u2013 an alternative way to experience live music that prioritises quality. Pop-up gigs are the perfect antidote to merchandise-heavy, big venue performances that can leave you wondering whether you really like live music after all.</p> <p>Living-room gigs themselves are nothing new. Even Noel Gallagher's had a go. However, what was once a niche activity is spreading fast. It's an opportunity for bands to do their thing without music industry constraints, while audiences get a chance to see a great band without the irritation of getting crushed in a massive crowd.</p> <p>We've all been there: you arrive at the 4,000-capacity venue armed with your best mate to see a favourite band perform. Tickets cost \u00a332 each but you make up for it by living off soup for a few weeks and writing your lecture notes smaller to save on notepads. You get there early enough to find a spot near the front, not stuck behind a row of 6ft blokes in their Doc Martins, so you won't have to be on tip-toes all night. The lights go down, the band walks on, the music starts. Then the guy behind you starts singing. Loudly. And out of tune.</p> <p>The living-room gig set-up is ideal for cash-strapped, music-loving students. Sofar Sounds is run on a donations-only policy, there's an informal atmosphere, and you can bring your own drinks. What's more, the \"underground\" feel gives the gig an edge that the O2 Arena could never pull off.</p> <p>For Sophie, studying geography at Manchester University, it was the laidback intimacy that she enjoyed: \"We saw Stefan Melbourne play a living-room gig back in May. I loved it. There's no physical divide between the musicians and the audience so you feel totally immersed in it.</p> <p>\"Clubs and bars try to promote this image of students constantly wanting to party hard until they're total wrecks. It's demeaning and it's just not true a lot of the time. Sofar was quite the opposite \u2013 chilled out, really friendly crowd and brilliant music.\"</p> <p>The sentiment is shared by maths student Ollie, who is studying at UCL. \"I've been to a couple of living-room gigs and can't wait to go again,\" he says.</p> <p>\"We saw The Staves play last year and I remember thinking how cool it was to see musicians in such a relaxed setting. Students don't often get that luxury \u2013 it feels more like something reserved for those who've made it big. I guess living-rooms are the ultimate democratiser.\"</p> <p>Fiery folk-pop band <a href=\"http://tokillaking.co.uk/\" title=\"\">To Kill a King</a> are living-room gig veterans, having done over 50 such events, almost all of which they've organised themselves via requests on their <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/tokillaking\" title=\"\">Facebook page</a>.</p> <p>But as their drummer Jon Willoughby points out, not all \"living-room gigs\" are actually performed in, er, living-rooms:</p> <p>\"<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYbrR3nDiGE&amp;feature=player_embedded\">We've performed gigs all over the place</a>: a florist's in Manchester, a tattoo parlour in Middlesborough, a bike shop in Brighton \u2013 as well as actual living-rooms of course. Settings like that are a great way to make fans feel involved and it's pretty awesome for us too.\"</p> <p>Despite the band's growing success and an upcoming UK tour, this hasn't changed their affection for these low-key shows. For guitarist Ian Dudfield, \"there's something great about going back to doing it up-close-and-personal, living-room style\".</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/6nuJvEYUvdI?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"283\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/6nuJvEYUvdI\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>Leeds-based <a href=\"http://www.hopeandsocial.com/\" title=\"\">Hope and Social</a> are a six-piece rock band who fit as many living-room gigs as they can into spare touring days. Often they end up staying the night once the post-gig shindig is over.</p> <p>Ed Waring, the band's keyboard player, says: \"There comes a point when trying to earn money can disturb what you're actually doing with the music you want to make. It's a continual battle all bands have. For us, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nuJvEYUvdI&amp;feature=player_embedded\">playing music and interacting with fans</a> is what it's all about. Living-room gigs give us a great opportunity to combine those things.\"</p> <p>Living-room gigs are a cheap way to get to know new bands and unfamiliar styles of music. \"Everyone gets to have a good time,\" says Waring, \"and if there are people there who don't know who we are, even better \u2013 that's people learning about our music while having fun with their mates.</p> <p>\"For us, it's a reminder that a band like us is just a few generations down from wandering minstrels. The only difference is we're doing it in living-rooms.\"</p>",

Unfortunately, Grand Central punctuality statistics are not published by National Rail.</p> <p><strong>Seating </strong>The service had one first-class coach with the rest of the train taken up with standard class carriages. The standard coaches had a good mix of airline style and table seats, all with ample leg room.</p> <p><strong>Facilities </strong>The on-board cafe had a good range with competitive prices. Tea and coffee (\u00a31.50), a bacon butty (\u00a33) and chocolate bars (80p) were on offer, as well as playing cards and travel games. Passengers wishing to pay by card had a minimum spend of \u00a36. Wi-Fi is offered to all customers free of charge, while the on-board toilet facilities were more than adequate.</p> <p><strong>Staff </strong>The on-board crew were well-mannered, especially when confronted with a troublesome customer in the carriage. The on-board announcements, however, were perhaps too frequent for most people's tastes.</p> <p><strong>Rating</strong> 9/10.</p> <p><strong>Adam's verdict</strong> One of the few sections of UK railway to have more than one operator in direct competition, the York to London stretch is served by two competent providers in East Coast and Grand Central. East Coast is a considerably bigger firm and Grand Central was not able compete on the number of services offered, although it has already announced plans to add more in the near future.</p> <p>Walk-up prices were considerably cheaper on Grand Central, with anytime return tickets nearly \u00a3130 cheaper than its rival. However, both firms offer a wide range of cheaper advance tickets.</p> <p>The carriages on the Grand Central train were far roomier than those on East Coast, with more table seats available and considerably more leg room. Grand Central also offered free Wi-Fi and the prices of on-board snacks were far cheaper.</p> <p>Despite running fewer services, the lower prices mean Grand Central is worth waiting for.</p> <h2>Last week</h2> <p>We pitted <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/money/2012/oct/19/itunes-blinkbox-which-better\" title=\"iTunes or blinkbox  which is better?\">iTunes against blinkbox</a> in the battle of the film downloads.

Our colleague Mona Mahmood has been talking via Skype with Aula Sulaiman, a resident in the Nile Street district of the city (on the southern edge of Khalidiyeh district) which is under Syrian army control.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There is no sign of Eid in my neighbourhood. Some people were trying to do shopping yesterday, but it was not like the day before Eid at all.</p> <p>We didn't do the special cake we do every Eid and didn't even buy the sweets we used to buy every Eid to offer to our guests. We are in a big crisis and there is no space for such things \u2013 we hardly can be happy even if it is Eid.</p> <p>Eid prayers today had very few people and mosques near areas under shelling did not open at all today.</p> <p>We were able to slaughter a sheep today, and some other people did, though people are very short of money. We intend to take the meat to refugees in schools and gardens and also to liberated districts as butchers' shops are closed there. Getting a sheep in Aleppo is not easy these days .. and the price is $300-$500.</p> <p>The main market, Al-Madina market is in old Aleppo near the castle. It is where people used to do all their shopping as it has moderate prices. Now, no one can access it as half of it is occupied by the FSA and the the other half by the Syrian army and snipers are on top of the buildings.</p> <p>Yesterday, we had heavy rain in Aleppo and as the city has been neglected for a long time without municipality services water swamped the roads. Shops and street vendors lost everything as the water covered their goods.</p> <p>The FSA fighters were able to access new districts in Aleppo yesterday \u2013 Ashrafiyeh, al-Rahman mosque and al-Sabeel. The FSA are surrounding the Criminal Security now but the Syrian army have brought tanks to Ashrafiyeh district today. The tanks did not fire any shells.</p> <p>If the tanks do open fire there, it will be a disaster as Ashrafiyeh is very populated and the people would have to move out.</p> <p>There is a barracks Syrian army in the district where I live. The FSA are controlling part of it and trying to get control of the other two parts but till now they could not. This barracks has anti-aircraft missiles. If the FSA can liberate this barracks, they can liberate our district too.</p> <p>After the FSA attack yesterday, we expected a retaliation by the Syrian army \u2013 specially by planes \u2013 but thank God it did not happen. Some of the people here are talking about Jabhat al-Nusra being able to get anti-aircraft missiles from abroad, which stops the Syrian army shelling the the city with planes. I have to say that the planes have not shelled Aleppo for three days now.</p> <p>There is an artillery in al-Zahra district. It has been shooting a site near Ashrafiyeh since this morning. I have heard more than six shells so far.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-508aa4ac95cb4ec5a031ba1d\" class=\"block is-summary\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-26T14:56:44.256Z\">3.56pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Children injured in Damascus bomb</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Several children were injured in the Damascus car bomb according to an activist in the city.</p> <p>A playground was hit, according to Susan Ahmad, spokeswoman for the Revolutionary Command Council of Damascus.

I conducted case work with migrants and refugees with mental health problems, ranging from post-traumatic stress disorder to depression.</p> <p>I spent a year helping people apply for benefits, locate housing and find their way around London. I was shocked and appalled at the abuse the people I worked with suffered on a daily basis \u2013 both from professionals and the general public.</p> <p>I read an article recently that said that social work students were not political any more. This certainly isn't the case for me, and for many of my fellow students on the MA in social work course at university.</p> <p>We are well aware of the cuts to vital services that are having an impact on people who use services as a result of the current government's austerity measures, and are determined to challenge these as we enter the profession.</p> <p>During my first week at Goldsmiths on the MA social work course, I have already watched my fellow students get to grips with the professional capabilities framework and we will be using it to demonstrate our skills and knowledge to potential placement providers.</p> <p>I feel privileged to have come into contact with so many inspiring and talented social workers during my time at the college. My advice to fellow students is not to believe everything you read.</p> <p>Yes there is a high burnout rate and jobs are hard to come by. But there are social workers who are passionate, who find ways to relax in their spare time, who are politically active, who use social media to debate social work issues and who adore their jobs.</p> <p>I feel lucky to have met them, and will be embracing this positive attitude as I embark on my training.</p> <p><em>If you would like to blog for the social care network about issues affecting social workers' professional lives, then you can get in touch by </em><a href=\"mailto:jessica.fuhl@guardian.co.uk\" title=\"\"><em>emailing us</em></a><em>.</em></p> <p><strong>Why not join our community?

  "<p>Julian Assange has said he will not consider leaving the Ecuadorean embassy in London unless the US government drops its \"immoral\" investigation into WikiLeaks.</p> <p>Assange has been sheltering in the embassy since June as part of his attempt to avoid extradition to Sweden to face rape allegations. He fears he will ultimately be sent to the United States to face interrogation over the whistleblowing website, which he founded.</p> <p>In a CNN interview in the embassy, Assange said the standoff could end if the US government drops its investigation. \"It's an immoral investigation,\" he said. \"It breaches the first amendment, it breaches all the principles that the US government says it stands for and it absolutely breaches the principles the founding fathers stood for and which most of the US people believe in.\"</p> <p>Assange broke his bail conditions in June when he took refuge in the embassy in Knightsbridge after he lost a supreme court challenge to the validity of the European arrest warrant that demanded his return to Sweden for questioning. He was due to be sent within days when he took up residence in the diplomatic mission having been granted political asylum.</p> <p>His lawyers and the Ecuadorean government contend that travelling to Sweden could lead to his extradition to the US, where he could face charges over WikiLeaks' publication of thousands of US diplomatic cables.</p> <p>US soldier Bradley Manning is two years into his military solitary confinement for allegedly leaking hundreds of thousands of US state secrets, many of which ended up on the WikiLeaks website. He is currently awaiting trial and could be sentenced to life in prison if found guilty.</p> <p>\"There's an attempt to extradite me without charge and without evidence, allegedly for the purpose of questioning,\" said Assange. \"Meanwhile, the FBI has been engaged in building this tremendous case, now up to 41,235 pages.\"</p> <p>In the interview, Assange compared life in the embassy to \"living on a space station\". \"There's no natural light,\" he said. \"You have got to make all your own stuff. You can't go out to the shops. But I've been in solitary confinement. I know what life is like for prisoners \u2013 [this is] a lot better than it is for prisoners.\"</p> <p>His interview came after WikiLeaks released more than 100 US defence department files on Thursday disclosing the military's detention policies in Guantanamo Bay and Iraq, dating from the September 11 attacks until 2004.</p> <p>Assange said the documents showed that \"policies of unaccountability\" had allowed prisoners to be abused with impunity. The destruction of video interviews or the failure to record them, as revealed in the files, had led to a situation \"where abuse can occur and it can't be discovered\".</p>"
