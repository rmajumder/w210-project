[
  "<p><strong>Hello David. How are you?</strong> Very well thanks Small Talk. Yourself?</p> <p><strong>Top banana. Now then, you're part of Sky Sports' Ryder Cup breakfast show team. What's that going to entail?</strong> It's Saturday and Sunday morning, we'll be reviewing the previous day's golf. A bit like Goals on Sunday \u2013 but with golf. It's a review show with a light-hearted touch.</p> <p><strong>Are you a morning person generally?</strong> Er, no. I had another interview to do before this and I completely slept through it and forgot. I've got about five missed calls. I get up early most of the time on tour so you get accustomed to it but I'd rather not have an alarm there. I'd rather be sleeping but there's not much chance of that with a six-month old.</p> <p><strong>When you've been dragged from your bed, what's your breakfast of choice?</strong> At the moment I'm into porridge. I like muesli. Ideal breakfast would be some really nice chopped fruit, a bowl of porridge, a cup of tea and the Daily Mail.</p> <p><strong>All very, very healthy. Apart from the Daily Mail obviously. So, to the big one - who is going to win the Ryder Cup?</strong> If I only I knew. I'd have a massive bet. What I will say is that Europe are good enough to win it. I think they can and they possibly will. I think our team is so strong that if they don't win they'll be disappointed. It's always so hard to call which is why it's become such a brilliant event. But our team is as good as we've ever had.</p> <p><strong>Does the lack of experience on the US side count against them?</strong> I don't think it does. In fact, I'd say it's almost the opposite. They've got Brandt Snedeker, Jason Dufner, Keegan Bradley and Webb Simpson making debuts. Snedeker's just won the the FedEx Cup, so he's fairly happy. Webb Simpson and Bradley are both major winners so they're not going to be intimidated by the Ryder Cup atmosphere. And Dufner's a really good player. I think it could work in their favour. It's their first Ryder Cup, they're great players, they've been watching the Ryder Cup for 20 years, they want to be part of it and they want to win. To have rookies of that quality could be an advantage.</p> <p><strong>There seems to be a far too convivial atmosphere between the sides for Small Talk's liking. Is there less animosity between the sides these days?</strong> Things have changed haven't they. A lot of our players live over there [in America], they're friends with the US players, they play on their tour, so it has changed undoubtedly. But then the event was set up to foster relations between the two sides of the Atlantic. It's as good natured as it can be and that's good. The sporting occasion that there was at Celtic Manor wasn't in any way lessened by the fact that they all got on.</p> <p><strong>You won the Ryder Cup in 2004 and 2006 \u2013 what were the parties like after those wins?</strong> Fantastic. We went to an Irish bar after the first one and I had the strangest thing happen. I didn't have any money on me, because you don't need any money on you when you're playing in the Ryder Cup. When we went out to this party I happened to mention to Westwood and Clarke that, hang on a minute, if we're going to a public place, I haven't got any money. \"Don't worry about it. You'll be fine. You won't need any money in this place.\" So we got to this Irish bar, the place is rammed, and all eight of us who had gone along were stood up on this bar. Westwood does this thing where he introduces everybody with a big build up. It's all good fun. We must have been up there for 40 minutes.</p> <p>Eventually we jumped down. I order a drink. The barman says: \"That'll be $12.\" I said: \"Erm, I haven't got any money.\" \"Why've you ordered a drink?\" \"I'm one of the golfers. I've just been on the bar.\" \"Whaddaya mean you're one of the golfers?\" This barman had just been transported in from Mars at that exact moment and hadn't witnessed any of the previous hour's action. Eventually some American dude came up and said: \"You've just kicked our ass, now I'm going to have to buy you a beer.\" Then in Ireland that was a real proper party at the team hotel. The Guinness was flowing. I danced until four in the morning and woke up with a neck that I couldn't move and had to have three days of intensive physio in order to try and play the next weekend. Helluva night. Brilliant.</p> <p><strong>So the tips for the new guys are: book in for physio on Monday morning and take your wallet with you if you go out.</strong> Definitely. But actually, I haven't experienced a losing Sunday night, but it must be awful. The Americans still went out and had a drink and a party of sorts but you want to make sure you end up on the winning side so you can have that massive energy-filled party.</p> <p><strong>Away from the golf, how do you like to relax?</strong> Erm ... I ... erm ... I don't do a lot really. Just potter about. A bit of socialising. As soon as I get home, Freddie gets passed on to me and Daddy Daycare takes over. I haven't got any hobbies really because every time I try to do something I break something or sprain something or tear something. So, yeah, I'm a potterer.</p> <p><strong>Pottering is a hugely under-rated form of relaxation. </strong>Yeah, I'm never happier than when I'm going to the tip.</p> <p><strong>Small Talk has not long discovered the joy of the tip. Well, the Reuse and Recycling Centre.</strong> It's not so great with a bag of dirty nappies, though.</p> <p><strong>Probably not. So you're a Swindon Town fan?</strong> I am, kind of by default. I followed them as a kid. I don't live there anymore so I don't go to any matches, but it's always mentioned on my website and I follow the results.</p> <p><strong>So it's sort of right. Not like that time </strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/feb/22/smalltalk.sportinterviews\" title=\"\"><strong>Small Talk tried to ask John Scales about his two pubs in Wolverhampton</strong></a><strong>. Any strong opinions on Paolo Di Canio? He's always interesting.</strong> We've got a bit of a history of high-profile managers \u2013 Glenn Hoddle, Lou Macari, Steve McMahon, Ossie Ardiles \u2013 so Paolo's very much in that vein. He's absolutely bonkers isn't he? But he did well for us last year. I don't know how long he'll stay. But on the whole, for the fans, he's a joy to have around.</p> <p><strong>Returning to the golf. Small Talk likes a game of pitch and putt on a course in London's Hackney. 18 holes, each hole is about 80-120 yards - what would be a decent score on there? What should we be aiming for?</strong> Well, have you got handicaps?</p> <p><strong>[Belying the fact that Small Talk and associated chums are the most hopeless of hackers] Er, no.</strong> Four a hole? Maybe a mixture of fours and threes? So let's think ... [does a few mental sums] ... 65?</p> <p><strong>[Small Talk's chest bursts with pride] Well, our best ever is 66.</strong> There you are then.</p> <p><strong>[Small Talk decides he wants more praise] And there's always a few divots, twigs on the greens, syringes that sort of thing ...</strong> It's not exactly Augusta's par three I'm sure. Actually, they are strangely more difficult than they appear par three courses. Even for pros. It always surprises me how bad my scores are whenever I play one. So, you're fine with a 67.</p> <p><strong>[Small Talk makes mental note to apply for Tour card for next season] Who is the most famous person in your mobile?</strong> Hugh Grant. We played at a pro-am tournament. I did have Samuel L Jackson's number in my old phone but I lost it.</p> <p><strong>Cheese or chocolate?</strong> Chocolate. Galaxy. Very effeminate chocolate for some reason. I should be a Yorkie man, but I'm not.</p> <p><strong>Do you wear slippers?</strong> No. I've got flip-flops on.</p> <p><strong>What would you put in Room 101?</strong> Soft spikes. We used to wear metal spikes on the soles of golf shoes and we still can. But then this whole new revolutionary idea of rubber or plastic spikes came in. They're called soft spikes. They're great for being able to walk into clubhouses. But they clog up with grass and I slip in them all the time. And now many golf clubs in the world only allow soft spikes. I hate them.</p> <p><strong>What's your favourite vegetable?</strong> [Long pause] Erm ... [another pause] ... I haven't got one. They're all horrible aren't they? I'm not really a veg man.</p> <p><strong>Well, even the most ardent vegephobe might like a cauliflower smothered in cheese sauce ... </strong>Ah, yes, but I don't like cauliflower cheese. Let's just say ... [inspiration strikes] green beans.</p> <p><strong>Have you ever seen a ghost?</strong> No.</p> <p><strong>What about a UFO?</strong> No.</p> <p><strong>Do you think either of those things exist or are we alone? [Slightly harrumphing noise from the other end of the phone that could be mild irritation but Small Talk chooses to interpret as 'deep thought'</strong>] Erm ... Well, I would be more inclined to believe somebody who said they had seen a ghost than someone who claimed to have seen a UFO.</p> <p><strong>What was the last book that you read?</strong> Fifty Shades of ... no I'm joking. It was called Adrenaline and I hated it. It actually started to depress me. But for some reason I ploughed on.</p> <p><strong>Last of all then. Sunday evening, 6pm, USA v Europe, we've got 50p to put on the final score. What's it going to be?</strong> 15 ...16-12 ... 15-13 to ... Europe. That'd be brilliant. As close as it could be, virtually.</p> <p><strong>Excellent. We'll make our fortune. Thanks for your time David.</strong> Pleasure. No problem.</p> <p>\u2022 Watch The Ryder Cup live on Sky Sports in HD, 3D, and on mobile devices via Sky Go and Sky Sports for iPad.</p>",
  "<p>The Liberal Democrats used much of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/liberal-democrat-conference-2012\" title=\"\">their week in Brighton</a> to discuss, as one Twitter wag put it, all the policies they would pursue if only they didn't have power. For some, notably Vince Cable, differentiation from the Tories was the name of the game. Nick Clegg was steadfast in his commitment to the coalition, with a firm message on the deficit. But he too was keen to draw dividing lines with the Conservatives where he could: \"Do you really think the Tories will make Britain fairer?\" <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/2012/sep/26/nick-clegg-lib-dem-conference-live#block-5063163f58f9bdd2eeba02a2\" title=\"\">he encouraged his campaigners to ask on the doorstep</a>.</p> <p>As my research in marginal seats has consistently found, the Lib Dems' heavily localised appeal means they are unlikely to do as badly at the next election as their single-figure national poll ratings currently suggest. Nevertheless, the week has highlighted their strategic dilemma: how to set themselves apart from the Tories while showing that they can contribute to a grown-up coalition.</p> <p>Polling Lib Dem voters during the party's post-election slump, I concluded its best hope for the future lay in appealing to people who wanted it to be a serious force, not those who used it as an opt-out from having to choose. Becoming a kind of opposition-in-office, as a way of pitching to left-leaning voters who wish they had never entered government in the first place, would be the worst of all possible worlds. An appeal to the left would be hampered by the fact that for many of their disillusioned former voters, the Lib Dems' problem is one of trust as much as policy. Noisily making unmeetable demands would contradict their supposed aptitude for coalition politics, and make them seem even less influential in Whitehall, not more.</p> <p>At the <a href=\"http://www.conservativesinbirmingham2012.com/\" title=\"\">Conservative conference</a> we&#xa0;will see how David Cameron plans to deal with his own predicament. One&#xa0;third of his voters from 2010 now say they would not vote for the party in an election tomorrow. His main priority, some argue, should therefore be to appeal to previous Tory voters for whom the government's record has been less stoutly Conservative than they had hoped. But there could only be one winner if the coalition parties reverted to strategies tailored to their respective fringes. Ed Miliband would not miss the chance to fill what would then be the vacant position of a party of government for the broad mass of voters.</p> <p>The only route to the majority the Tories crave is to show they are governing for the whole country. Certainly, this involves bringing back the \"defectors\" who voted Tory in 2010 but currently say they will not next time. But this alone would only take the party back to the vote share that took it into coalition.</p> <p>To govern alone, the Tories need to attract and hold people who did not vote for them last time and may never have done so before. The latest phase <a href=\"http://lordashcroftpolls.com/2012/07/project-blueprint-phase-3-the-quest-for-a-conservative-majority/\" title=\"\">of Project Blueprint</a>, my ongoing research on the prospects for an overall majority, found there are as many people who voted Lib Dem in 2010 who might be persuaded to vote Tory as there are Conservatives tempted to switch to Ukip. The Conservatives do not have the luxury of choosing between the two if they want to govern alone after 2015.</p> <p>This is a conundrum for the Tories but the demands of these two groups are not as irreconcilable as they might appear. Potential converts agree that the Tories have the best approach to the economy and vastly prefer Cameron as prime minister to the alternative. They have reservations about whether the Conservatives are committed to fairness. Potential defectors \u2013 of whom the biggest chunk say they do not know which party they will vote for \u2013 often think the party does not seem to be on their side, or are disappointed with Cameron. Many, though, say a Conservative government is their preferred election outcome and simply dislike the coalition.</p> <p>The Tories can appeal to both these sets of voters, and to the wider electorate, if everything they do shows they have the right priorities for the country, displays strong leadership, proves they are on the side of the right people, and offers some reassurance about their character and motives. Deficit reduction, constructive welfare reform, more responsive public services, a measured demonstration that promises are being kept on crime and immigration \u2013 combined with a greater sense of direction and grip \u2013 all qualify.</p> <p>Cameron needs to show a determination to make life better for people whether they supported the Tories last time or not. After all, if the Conservatives want to ditch the Lib Dems after the next election, they will need to steal their voters.</p>",
  "<p>As Venezuelans get ready to head to the polls for the most closely fought presidential election of the past 14 years, one question is at the forefront of everyone's mind: does Hugo Ch\u00e1vez still have it? By \"it\", I&#xa0;mean his legendary, intense, emotional connection with the poor \u2013 a kind of attachment that has, for many, a feeling of religious fervour. Of faith.</p> <p>\"<a href=\"http://www.miamiherald.com/2012/09/11/v-fullstory/2997290/capriles-closing-in-on-chavez.html\" title=\"\">Ch\u00e1vez is the only one who has ever really cared about the poor</a>\" \u2013 you hear his supporters say it again and again, with real feeling, and now more than ever it's the centre of his pitch to voters.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.chavez.org.ve/\" title=\"\">Ch\u00e1vez: Heart of my Fatherland</a> \u2013 the slogan turns up everywhere, right down to <a href=\"http://www.noticierodigital.com/cms/wp-content/uploads/extracto_imagen_botellita_de_agua_22sep2012.jpg\" title=\"\">the water bottles</a> given away to keep his supporters hydrated at rallies.</p> <p>But 14 years on, as even his most hardcore supporters acknowledge, Ch\u00e1vez's experiment in 21st-century socialism isn't really working. After the chaotic nationalisation of most of the agro-industrial chain \u2013 from the farm to the supermarket \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.economist.com/node/16326418\" title=\"\">food shortages have become chronic</a>, with various staples disappearing from shelves. <a href=\"http://wikileaks.org/cable/2007/12/07CARACAS2381.html\" title=\"\">Lines at subsidised government grocery shops are long,</a> and particularly scarce commodities sell out almost the second they're delivered.</p> <p>On closer inspection, the only thing that appears to be 21st century about Ch\u00e1vez's 21st-century socialism is <a href=\"https://twitter.com/chavezcandanga\" title=\"\">the presidential Twitter account</a>. The economy is still run along the same rigid lines that crippled eastern bloc economies for much of the 20th century. One after another, industries have been nationalised only to become outsized money-pits unable to produce the goods needed. The steel and cement industries <a href=\"http://blogs.ft.com/beyond-brics/2011/08/19/venezuela-no-cement-no-steel-no-housing/\" title=\"\">can't produce enough</a> to meet the country's housing needs; electric utilities have brought chronic <a href=\"http://latitude.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/09/21/chavezs-electric-power-problem/\" title=\"\">blackouts throughout the country</a>; and the phone company has failed to deliver adequate internet access. Venezuelans like to joke that Julian Assange passed over Venezuela for political asylum simply because the internet is so slow there.</p> <p>That Venezuela's economy doesn't grind to a halt, Zimbabwe style, amid the waste, corruption and mismanagement of incompetent central planning is down to a single word: oil. Sitting atop <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oil_reserves_in_Venezuela\" title=\"\">the world's largest reserves</a> at a time of extraordinarily high prices, the government is kept afloat by a torrent of petrodollars that more or less papers over the cracks. When steel production falls by two-thirds after a botched nationalisation, the government simply re-routes part of the petrodollar stream to finance steel imports. When nationalised farms suffer a similar fate, food imports are jacked up.</p> <p>Oil wealth is a magical elixir that keeps up the appearance of normality, even as the country sinks deeper and deeper into the economic morass.</p> <p>In many ways that near-mystical bond with the poor is the most important of the assets that oil funds. Ch\u00e1vez has been careful to keep the spigots open, channelling a constant stream of populist giveaways to his supporters. An oil-for-appliances deal with China, for example, has allowed Venezuela to import more than 3m Chinese-made stoves, refrigerators, washing machines, air conditioners and flat-screen TVs, goodies handed out directly to governing party supporters as part of \"My Well-Stocked Home\" \u2013 a government social programme, <a href=\"http://www.correodelorinoco.gob.ve/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Mi-casa-bien-equipada-.jpg\" title=\"\">whose logo includes the comandante presidente's face</a>. The guiding principle to Chavista social policy is simple: people must never be under the impression it's to the welfare state they owe their access to oil-financed goodies \u2013 all gratitude and loyalty must be focused on Ch\u00e1vez himself. The resulting cult of personality is neatly captured in that slogan. Ch\u00e1vez, we're told, is no mere politician: he is the \"heart of my fatherland\" \u2013 with that possessive pronoun to cement each voter's twin loyalties to the nation and its leader. It's only the tiniest step from that formulation to its flip-side: failure to support the leader is <a href=\"http://www.hrw.org/news/2012/07/17/venezuela-concentration-and-abuse-power-under-ch-vez\" title=\"\">tantamount to treason</a>.</p> <p>It has taken Venezuela's long-suffering opposition movement 14 years to decode Ch\u00e1vez's intoxicating appeal and formulate a compelling alternative. This year the opposition has finally united and rallied around <a href=\"http://hayuncamino.com/\" title=\"\">Henrique Capriles</a>, an energetic young state governor who has put pragmatism and problem solving at the centre of his campaign. Capriles can't match Ch\u00e1vez for charisma, and doesn't try to. But after 14 years of deepening economic dysfunction, administrative chaos and dependence on oil, he has sensed an opening for a no-nonsense campaign centred on institutionalising the revolution's social advances while sweeping away its legacy of political sectarianism, ideological rigidity and mismanagement. \"Never again should you have to show a Socialist party membership card to access a social programme,\" Capriles says in his stump speech, invariably bringing the house down. The line hits home because every person in the audience knows someone who has been shut out of access to the latest oil bonanza for ideological deviance.</p> <p>Capriles senses there's a thirst in Venezuela to move beyond the divisive politics of the Ch\u00e1vez personality cult; that for more and more one-time Chavistas the old visceral pull of the <em>caudillo's</em> charisma has worn thin in the face of a mass of unsolved problems; that Venezuelans crave the type of minimally competent government they've not had for years; and that they're ready to take a chance on change.</p>",
  "<p></p> <h2><a name=\"economy\">Economy</a></h2> <p><strong>It's the economy, stupid \u2013 or is it? You have to go back more than 70 years to find a president who retained his job when so many of his compatriots lost theirs. Economic gloom made short work of Jimmy Carter and George Bush Sr. But Barack Obama's record is not all bad \u2013 and that might be good enough to save him, says Larry Elliott</strong></p> <p>Barack Obama should be toast. Under his stewardship, the US economy has suffered its feeblest economic recovery since the second world war. Living standards for the average American have fallen since he arrived at the White House almost four years ago.</p> <p>Despite his rallying call to the struggling and the dispossessed in 2008, poverty is rising and the gap between rich and poor has grown. History shows that the last incumbent president to win an election with the unemployment rate above 8% was Franklin D Roosevelt.</p> <p>If the race for White House is about the economy \u2013 and American voters routinely say it is \u2013 Mitt Romney would be winning the election by a country mile and Obama contemplating joining George Bush Sr and Jimmy Carter as one-term presidents of the modern era.</p> <p>Polling by the Pew Research Centre shows that only 41% of Americans say their own personal financial situation is excellent or good, while consumer confidence is lower than it was when Gerald Ford lost to Carter in 1976 and when Carter was turfed out by Ronald Reagan four years later. The last time Americans felt this gloomy was in 1992, and Bill Clinton won.</p> <p>The fact that real median incomes, a benchmark of how well the middle classes are doing, have dropped by 4.7% since Obama became president has allowed Romney to ask the question so tellingly posed by Reagan against Carter: \"Are you better off than you were four years ago?\"</p> <p>If the well-off in the US were asked that question, the answer would be yes. The top 5% of earners, those making $186,000 (\u00a3115,000) or more, took 22.3% of national income in 2011, up from 21.3% in 2010.</p> <p>Income inequality, as measured by the Gini coefficient, is greater than it has been since records began in 1975, making the US the fourth most unequal country in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development after Chile, Mexico and Turkey. All this has got the pollsters scratching their heads.</p> <p>Bruce Stokes, fellow of the Pew Institute, said: \"Back in the spring, my assumption was that if unemployment remained above 8%, the president was going to lose. It has remained above 8% but despite that the president retains a great deal of public support, and that has grown in the last month.\"</p> <p>Obama has been helped in recent weeks by some tentative signs that the economy is on the mend. The recession in the real estate market \u2013 the worst the US has ever endured \u2013 appears to be at an end, with housing starts, home sales and property prices all on the rise.</p> <p>Ben Bernanke, chairman of the Federal Reserve, has lifted share prices on Wall Street by announcing that the US central bank will continue to use monetary stimulus until there is clear evidence of sustained growth. An easing of the eurozone crisis has calmed fears that the economy might plunge off a cliff in the runup to election day.</p> <p>There is, though, perhaps more to it than that. Analysts at Capital Economics say that the darkest days for the US economy were in the months between Obama's election victory in November 2008 and his inauguration in early 2009 and that the economy is in much better shape now than it was then.</p> <p>\"At the end of 2008, GDP was falling at an annualised rate of 9%, over 700,000 jobs were being lost every month and the banking system was in meltdown,\" Capital Economics said.</p> <p>Polls show that many voters still blame Bush and the Republicans for the current weakness in the economy, while at the same time giving Obama credit for rescuing the US car industry when it was faced with bankruptcy.</p> <p>Even this, however, does not appear to be the whole story, as voters in the swing states appear to be planning to vote for Obama while at the same time believing that Romney would be just as good, if not better, at handling the economy.</p> <p>According to Stokes, the explanation may be that Obama is well ahead when it comes to other issues, such as healthcare and national security, and is also seen as a more likable candidate.</p> <p>Romney's only hope in the remaining weeks of the campaign is to make Obama's handling of the economy the key election issue. If he fails to do so, Obama looks likely to be re-elected.</p> <p></p> <h2><a name=\"Health\">Health</a></h2> <p><strong>Obama's healthcare reform was arguably the biggest domestic achievement of his presidency, requiring Americans to buy health insurance and making sure people with pre-existing conditions got insurance. Republicans denounced the act as unaffordable, a violation of individual freedom. Romney pledged to repeal the care act in its entirety but now says there are a things he would keep \u2013 including allowing young adults to stay on parental policies until they are 25. In a trip to the US, the Guardian's health editor, Sarah Boseley, found plenty of beneficiaries of the Obama reforms</strong></p> <p>Dawn Josephson, who lives in Jacksonville, Florida, fell foul of an insurance trap. In 2008 her son, Wesley, then two, woke up one morning with just the white of one eye showing and the iris of the other hardly visible. It was sudden-onset strabismus, caused by lack of co-ordination between eye muscles and the brain. His eyes were no longer focusing on the same point.</p> <p>They were paying $800 (\u00a3495) a month for health insurance for their family of four, with an excess of $1,500, and they were liable for 20% of their costs after that.</p> <p>Wesley had a surgical procedure costing about $8,000, although there was no overnight stay. With lab tests, the bills probably came to $12,000.</p> <p>\"About two months later, we got a nice little note from our insurance company saying, 'we are now terminating this policy and we have nothing else to offer you',\" she said. \"My husband and I are self-employed, so we have to get our own policy. We found another for about the same rate, but because Wesley had this pre-existing condition, anything relating to the eye was not covered. We were still going to the doctor every two months, paying anything from $600 to $1,000 for doctors' bills.\"</p> <p>The local Nemours children's hospital offered a payment scheme, so they ran up bills and paid a small monthly amount towards them.</p> <p>\"Around April 2010, we said, 'we can't do this any more, there has got to be an alternative',\" she said.</p> <p>An insurance agent found the family a cheaper policy, which at least saved them money for Wesley's bills.</p> <p>When Josephson called the insurance company to check on the policy, she was told everyone was covered, including Wesley. Josephson could not believe what she was hearing.</p> <p>\"For a split second I thought they made a mistake \u2013 just shut up and take the policy,\" she said. \"Then she said to me, 'we are no longer excluding pre-existing conditions for children'.\"</p> <p>On 23 March, Obama had signed the affordable care act into law. Wesley Josephson had just become one of the first beneficiaries.</p> <p></p> <h2><a name=\"foreign\">Foreign policy</a></h2> <p><strong>Foreign policy did not figure much in the campaign, until the killing of the US ambassador to Libya this month. Since then the gloves have come off, writes Julian Borger, the Guardian's diplomatic editor</strong></p> <p>Mitt Romney said very little about foreign affairs on the stump but he seized on the attack on the US consulate in Benghazi as an emblem of America's place in the world under Obama. He claimed that the US response to the wave of attacks on American diplomatic mission had been to apologise for the amateur video that had triggered them.</p> <p>It turned out he has his timings wrong and that a statement by the US embassy in Cairo condemning the video for its cynical portrayal of the prophet Muhammad had preceded the attacks.</p> <p>But the Romney campaign pressed on with the theme, seeking to cast the administration as apologising for American values abroad.</p> <p>The president appeared to slip in a television interview aired in which he described the riots as \"bumps in the road\" on the way to a functioning democracy.</p> <p>Romney responded quickly saying: \"These are not bumps in the road, these are human lives.\"</p> <p>The theme resonated because of popular perceptions of what was widely seen as ingratitude among the new north African democracies for American support for the Arab spring.</p> <p>The Republican vice-presidential nominee, Paul Ryan, claimed this week that the riots over the anti-Muslim video were a demonstration of how the Obama foreign policy was \"blowing up in our faces\".</p> <p>Ryan compared the scenes from north Africa to the 1979 Iranian revolution, implying a comparison between Obama and the Democratic president at the time, Jimmy Carter, the personification among American conservatives of weak, unpatriotic, leadership.</p> <p>Obama has sought to counter that narrative with his emphatic celebration of those values in this week's speech to the UN general assembly.</p> <p>On the bigger picture, that is some polling evidence that Obama has the edge.</p> <p>A new YouGov poll, seen by the Guardian, shows that, while a large majority of Republicans see their country locked in a zero-sum struggle with Islam, Americans as a whole rejects that view by 47% to 39%. Almost half those polled believe \"it is possible for the west and Muslims to coexist in peace\".</p> <p>Obama's UN speech mentioned in passing what the White House believes are its principal achievements abroad \u2013 the killing of Osama bin Laden, the withdrawal from Iraq, and the planned pullout from Afghanistan.</p> <p>The first aspect inoculates Obama from Republican attacks for lack of resolve over the other two. The slayer of America's enemy number one cannot easily be accused of being weak on security. Moreover, there is no political advantage to be gained in a war-weary America by arguing that the White House is cutting and running from foreign conflicts.</p> <p></p> <h2><a name=\"immigration\">Immigration</a></h2> <p><strong>Immigration reform is one of the top issues for Latino voters. Most of the estimated 11 million illegal immigrants in the US are Latino. Obama won their overwhelming support in 2008, and polls show he should repeat this in November. Although he failed to deliver on his promise to introduce immigration reform, he has taken action, bypassing Congress, to give the children of some illegal immigrants relief from the threat of arrest. He has also promised reform in a second term. But as Ewen MacAskill and Ed Pilkington report, there is still a long way to go to prevent immigrants from falling foul of individual states taking matters into their own hands</strong></p> <p>Latinos living without immigration papers in Arizona have begun bombarding helplines and lawyers' offices with requests about how to provide for their children should they be arrested under the controversial new police power that came into effect last week.</p> <p>A phoneline hosted by the Arizona branch of the American Civil Liberties Union received almost 4,000 calls in two days, many from anxious parents who fear their children could be left abandoned should they be picked up under the \"show-me-your-papers\" provision.</p> <p>Hundreds have been asking for help setting up a power of attorney, which gives a relative or friend who has US citizenship the right to care for minors in such an eventuality.</p> <p>\"People are terrified. They fear that they will go to the store to buy groceries and won't get home, and their kids will be left alone at school,\" said Luz Santiago, a pastor in Mesa. She said she had personally handled about 50 requests for power of attorney so far.</p> <p>The \"show-me-your-papers\" clause is the most deeply contested of the provisions of SB 1070, an Arizona law passed in 2010 that has set the benchmark for a wave of hardline immigration laws clamping down on undocumented families in several states.</p> <p>Under its terms, police are required to investigate the immigration status of anyone they come across during their normal work and whom they suspect of being unauthorised.</p> <p>The law was snarled up in legal challenges that went up to the US supreme court. In June, the court struck down several elements of the legislation but allowed the clause to go ahead pending local Arizona court approval.</p> <p>That approval was granted this week and the provision is now in effect.</p> <p>Residents of Phoenix, the capital of Arizona, are braced for the rule change, having witnessed the impact of heavy-handed policing for years under Joe Arpaio, who calls himself \"America's toughest sheriff\".</p> <p>Groups working with undocumented Hispanics are more concerned about other smaller towns, such as Flagstaff and Prescott, which have large Latino populations but no experience of police officers acting as immigration agents.</p> <p>Tucson, Arizona's second-largest city, is calling a forum next Tuesday in which community leaders will meet the police chief, Roberto Villasenor, to discuss the implementation of the clause.</p> <p>Regina Romero, who sits on the city council and convened the meeting, said the clear fear was that police would be drawn into racial profiling. \"We live 45 minutes from the Mexican border, so who else other than Mexicans are you going to be picking up? You are not going to be looking for Canadians in this part of the country,\" she said.</p> <p>Alessandra Soler, head of the ACLU in Arizona, said that there was already evidence that Tucson police were making contact inappropriately with US border patrol officers even for such mundane issues as help with translation.</p> <p>\"It's extremely problematic when you have local police contacting border patrol when there is no good reason.\"</p> <p>The ACLU and other groups have an outstanding civil rights action against SB 1070 still lodged with the state's appeal court. That legal attempt to put a stop to \"show me your papers\" will continue to pass through the courts, and the intention of opponents of the provision is to beef it up with real examples of racial profiling.</p> <p>Lydia Guzman, director of the hotline, said the aim now was to chronicle the impact of the law. \"The supreme court has given us the green light to present to the courts victims of racial profiling, so that's our challenge: show me the victims.\"</p> <p></p> <h2><a name=\"gender\">The gender gap</a></h2> <p><strong>Polls show women could be a crucial issue for the Democrats, with Romney lagging 20 points behind Obama with women voters, writes Karen McVeigh</strong></p> <p>Democrats tend to do better among women voters than Republicans, but even allowing for historical precedent, Romney is performing terribly with a demographic group whose votes can be decisive in swing states.</p> <p>The latest polls suggest that the gender gap this year could hit historic levels, with Romney trailing Obama by some 20 points among women nationally, and even more in some key battlegrounds.</p> <p>There are many policy related reasons behind the antipathy towards the Republicans among female voters. Women are more likely consider healthcare and social issues as important to their voting choice.</p> <p>But Romney has said that if elected he will repeal Obama's Affordable Healthcare Act, and social issues have persistently intruded on his campaign's attempts to focus on the economy.</p> <p>One of the defining Democrat attacks on the Republican candidate and his party has been over its \"war on women\", for policies on equal pay, domestic abuse, abortion and contraception.</p> <p>The drive by Republican lawmakers to cut funding for Planned Parenthood, the nation's largest provider of cancer screening to women with low incomes, has alienated some female voters, as have attempts to restrict access to abortion.</p> <p>Romney has flipped his position on abortion, running as pro-choice in Massachusetts, before changing it to anti-choice when running for presidency in 2008.</p> <p>By picking Paul Ryan, one of the most staunch anti-abortion conservatives as running mate, Romney has alienated moderates. That tension was further exposed in August amid the furore over the \"legitimate rape\" comments of Senate candidate Todd Akin.</p> <p></p> <h2><a name=\"funding\">Campaign finance</a></h2> <p><strong>Court rulings have given corporations and the super-rich a greater role in the elections than ever, writes Ed Pilkington</strong></p> <p>Super Pacs sound like a new child's toy. In fact, these new entities, arising from two court rulings, form the single most important innovation of the 2012 election cycle and are pumping a torrent of private and corporate money into the race.</p> <p>Formed in the wake of two controversial court rulings in 2010, Citizens United v FEC and Speechnow.org v FEC, Super Pacs \u2013 based on the traditional political action committees but able to engage in unlimited political spending outside campaigns \u2013 allow corporations, for the first time in more than 40 years, to use their financial muscle to influence an election.</p> <p>Super Pacs cannot directly fund candidates but they can support them with their own message.</p> <p>Collectively, Super Pacs have already spent $270m this year. The Republicans have the edge on spending, with billionaire donors such as Sheldon Adelson and Bob Perry wading in with tens of millions of dollars. The Republican Super Pac effort is being closely co-ordinated by George Bush's former svengali, Karl Rove.</p> <p>Obama has a Super Pac that supports his candidacy, Priorities USA, but it has raised $43m to the $97m raised by Restore Our Future, the Super Pac which backs Romney.</p>",
  "<p>Jonathan Kaiman depicts an increasingly ugly and intolerant Canada characterised by wanton environmental despoliation and paralysing political soul-searching (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/14/maple-leaf-what-ails-canada\" title=\"\">Maple leaf ragged: what ails Canada?</a>, 15 September). I suspect this verdict would surprise the nine out of 10 Canadians who recently told pollsters that \"Canada is the greatest country in the world\".</p> <p>It would also confound the many observers who recognise Canada's global economic leadership, with the strongest fiscal position in the G8.</p> <p>I will confine myself to correcting Kaiman's slanders against the most open and generous immigration system in the developed world. He claims that we are \"tightening\" immigration. In fact, our government has increased immigration to the highest sustained level in Canadian history, and the highest per-capita level in the developed world. He writes that we have \"radically adjusted the criteria for successful applications\", when in fact we are making our system more flexible, allowing skilled tradesmen, semi-skilled workers and foreign students to become permanent residents for the first time. He claims that we \"cut resettlement programmes en masse\", when in fact we are increasing our refugee resettlement programmes by 20% and have tripled funding for their integration.</p> <p>Kaiman wrongly suggests that we have \"eliminated all but the most basic healthcare for most refugee groups\", when in fact we will continue to fund healthcare for most refugees \u2013 such as those resettled from UN camps \u2013 more generously than Canada's general health service. He bemoans a fictitious \"harsh crackdown on illegal immigrants\", suggesting that there is something untoward about seeking to remove citizenship from people who obtained it fraudulently and have never lived in Canada. Far from \"harsh\", those who contest our efforts have access to an extensive process of judicial reviews and appeals.</p> <p>Kaiman laments our refusal rate for citizenship when, in fact, our overall acceptance rate last year was 92%. We are also proud to have the highest naturalisation rate in the developed world, with 85% of permanent residents eventually becoming full citizens. Finally, Kaiman imagines that the number of immigrants to Canada from China and India has halved in the last six years, when in fact it has remained constant, with an annual average of 28,000 permanent residents from India, and an annual average of 30,000 permanent residents from China between 2006 and 2010 (the last full year of available data).</p> <p>Kaiman's imaginary 50% reduction in Asian immigration is the basis of his most outrageous claim, that \"the changes point to a deep-rooted, yet widely ignored undercurrent of racism in Canadian society\". While no society can claim to be entirely free of prejudice, Canada is the only major western democracy without a xenophobic or anti-immigration political movement, and consistently records the highest levels of public tolerance for ethnic, religious and cultural diversity in the developed world.</p> <p>Canada is frequently lauded as a model of peaceful pluralism. Our government's recent reforms have made Canada more open to legitimate immigrants but harder on those seeking to abuse our generosity. It is a pity that&#xa0;Kaiman has aligned himself with the radical fringe of racial grievance-mongers in mistaking the rule of law \u2013 the backbone of a free and open society \u2013 for discrimination.<em> </em></p>",
  "<p>Few radio show presenters have to change gear as sharply as <strong>Jeremy Vine </strong>(Radio 2). His programme features four topical items ranging from hard news, through emotional terrain that the show handles superbly, to lighter items that are often unintentionally hilarious.</p> <p>It's a challenging mix, and one that relies on Vine keeping cool and consistent. But in the really sad moments (such as a woman this week talking about her son's suicide) you can hear he is moved, and you can also hear him reeling from some of the dottier subject matter. The latter got to him for about a minute this week, and resulted in him corpsing on-air as he tried to read a listener's email about ice-cream van music driving them mad.</p> <p>Corpsing on the radio is such a gleeful, cheering thing to encounter; it's impossible not to laugh along. You could hear why Vine laughed \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p00z2h37\" title=\"do listen\">do listen</a>, I don't want to give the details away, but it's a clash of listener anger and an incongruous tune \u2013 and, as with other famous examples (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/organgrinder/2008/mar/28/ifyouareinneed\" title=\"Charlotte Green, most notably\">Charlotte Green, most notably</a>), it's brilliant to hear all the broadcasting rules melt away for a minute. It's another sense of connection with presenters: they are human, fallible, and can only resist the hilarity of what's sometimes put before them for so long.</p> <p>Also on Radio 2, a new departure: a rather promising musical drama, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01mw1n1\" title=\"Shout to the Top\"><strong>Shout to the Top</strong></a>. Written by Louise Weiner (ex-Sleeper) and Roy Boulter (ex-The Farm), it's about an all-female group breaking into the music business in 1988. The plot takes well trodden paths \u2013 there's nothing dramatically surprising in the first episode \u2013 but the music sounds credible, with strong cover versions of hits and catchy new tracks. And there are some nice gags. One of the band members suggests they call themselves Oasis: \"That's a terrible name for a band,\" another says dismissively. Shane Ritchie plays the band's manager, Vince, and it's not exactly a stretching role. He runs a pub (\"Last orders, ladies and gentlemen please!\") and sounds a&#xa0;lot like Alfie Moon.</p>",
  "<p>Saudi Arabian officials have deported 241 Nigerian women from the annual hajj pilgrimage, and are threatening to send back hundreds of others said to be travelling without male chaperones, prompting a diplomatic row between the two countries.</p> <p>Nigerian officials responsible for organising the hajj said three planes were turned back from the Saudi city of Medina, while a further 1,000 women were held in detention centres in Mecca, some for up to five days. Under Saudi law, women are minors who require permission from a male relative to work, leave the country or, in some cases, receive medical treatment.</p> <p>But Nigeria's Saudi ambassador, Abubakar Shehu Bunu, said it had been agreed Nigerians could perform the rites as long as they were accompanied by local officials once they were in Saudi Arabia. Bunu has lodged a formal complaint with Saudi authorities.</p> <p>Many of the women who were sent back arrived in tears, some carrying babies strapped to their backs. \"We are all so sad. I used my last savings to top up what my cousin provided to pay for a hajj seat, only to be treated like infidels who are not fellow Muslims,\" said Halima Muhammad, who spent two days in a detention centre.</p> <p>\"From the airport we were all rounded up and taken to a facility that is not fit for humans. No one offered us anything, we had only water and slept on bare floors,\" she said by phone from Katsina. Others said they spent hours in darkened planes and were sent back without disembarking.</p> <p>Many Africans save for years to scrape together the \u00a33,000 fee; rich Muslim philanthropists and politicians sponsor pilgrims each year. Approximately half of Nigeria's 160-million strong population practise Islam, making it Africa's most populous Muslim country. But women are generally free to move around on their own, even in stricter northern states that practise sharia law. All Muslims who can afford it are required to perform the hajj at least once in their lifetime, according to the five pillars of Islam.</p> <p>Relations between the two oil-producing countries have been strained over the hajj in recent years. A Nigerian hajj official said some of the deported women had gone with male chaperones. \"Their crime was that some boarded different aircrafts to the men who were supposed to lead them in. So some of them disembarked from the aircraft at different times to the men,\" the official said.</p> <p>Last year, Saudi Arabia said it had deported several thousand undocumented Nigerians from the country over a one-year period. The hajj visa allows visitors to stay up to 45 days, though the rites do not normally take more than four days to complete.</p> <p>Saudi's interior ministry says that it deports more than 700,000 foreign nationals each year, including more than 20,000 who overstay their visas after arriving for the hajj.</p> <p>Nigerian Lawan Kaita, a Muslim leader from the city of Katsina and former governor, said Muslim elders in the city were calling for a \"strong response from Muslims across the world\". \"It's a slap in the face for Nigeria and all Muslims. Saudi Arabia has the privilege of being hosts, but it shouldn't stop others from coming to do the hajj,\" he said.</p> <p>Other African countries have faced similar woes in organising their citizens. Egypt's foreign ministry reported 12 citizens were deported daily during the pilgrimage last year. In Ivory Coast, authorities overfilled their quota last year, eventually leaving several hundred unable to undertake the trip.</p> <p>Around 2 million visitors will perform the hajj this year, with Saudi Arabia rejecting requests from 40 countries around the world to increase their quotas. Each Muslim country can send 1,000 pilgrims per million citizens.</p>",
  "<p>Rwanda's biggest aid donor, the European Union, has partially frozen its financial support to the east African nation, dealing what may be the heaviest blow yet to president Paul Kagame.</p> <p>The move follows decisions by the United States, Germany, the Netherlands and Sweden to suspend donor support over allegations that the Rwandan military is supporting a murderous rebellion in the neighbouring Democratic Republic of the Congo.</p> <p>Britain's position has been more ambiguous: after <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jul/27/uk-blocks-rwanda-aid\" title=\"\">initially freezing</a> \u00a316m of general budget support to the country in July, it unblocked half that amount earlier this month, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2012/sep/06/britain-resumes-aid-to-rwanda\" title=\"\">a partial U-turn</a> that provoked criticism. The EU's decision now leaves Britain isolated.</p> <p>Analysts said the EU had been \"dithering\" over the issue since a report was published by experts of the UN security council's sanctions committee alleging Rwandan support for the violent rebel group M23. <a href=\"http://www.gov.rw/RWANDA-S-RESPONSE-TO-THE-ALLEGATIONS-CONTAINED-IN-THE-ADDENDUM-TO-THE-UN-GROUP-OF-EXPERTS-INTERIM-REPORT\" title=\"\">Kigali vehemently denies the charges</a>.</p> <p>The EU said it would press on with existing aid projects aimed at Rwanda's poor, but direct budgetary support of up to \u20ac70m (\u00a356m) over six years has effectively been suspended. Overall EU aid to the country is \u20ac380m from 2008 to 2013.</p> <p>\"Some new decisions concerning additional budget support have been put on hold,\" an EU spokesperson said. \"In light of the current conflict in eastern DRC, the EU takes seriously the allegations contained in the report of the group of experts of the UN security council sanctions committee and needs more time to assess these allegations.</p> <p>\"Therefore, some new decisions concerning additional budget support have been delayed pending the clarification of Rwanda's role in the conflict and its constructive engagement in search of solutions.\"</p> <p>The M23 is led by Bosco Ntaganda, who is wanted by the international criminal court for war crimes It was formed when fighters from an ethnic Tutsi rebel group integrated into the Congolese military in a 2009 peace deal. The six-month uprising has forced 470,000 people to flee their homes.</p> <p>The Congolese government welcomed the EU's stand. Atoki Ileka, its ambassador to France and special envoy to the UN, said: \"This position gets into line with what many European countries have done so far. It's a step in the right direction. It is good to put pressure on the Rwandan leadership.\"</p> <p>Civilians are being killed and raped because of a \"so-called\" rebel movement, he added, and it was vital to find a solution. \"The stalemate is on the Rwandan side. The evidence is there. We all know Rwanda is directly supporting a rebellion in the region. There has been interference going on for 15 years and we must put a stop to it.\"</p> <p>A <a href=\"http://www.hrw.org/news/2012/09/11/dr-congo-m23-rebels-committing-war-crimes\" title=\"\">report by Human Rights Watch</a> earlier this month accused the M23 of widespread war crimes, including summary executions, rapes and forced recruitment. Thirty-three of those executed were young men and boys who tried to escape the rebels' ranks, the watchdog said, adding that it had clear evidence that the Rwandan army had deployed troops to directly support M23.</p> <p>Carina Tertsakian, senior researcher on Rwanda for Human Rights Watch, said: \"The EU is one of the biggest donors to Rwanda and this should send a clear signal that the Rwandan military should stop supporting the M23, otherwise Rwanda's relationship with international partners and friends may be jeopardised. Rwanda still depends heavily on foreign aid for its national budget to it should take this seriously.\"</p> <p>Britain's failure to hold the line was a mistake, Tertsakian added. \"In our view that was strategically counter-productive. It gave the signal that everything was fine. It was premature.\"</p> <p>When the controversial decision was made, Britain claimed that Rwanda deserved credit for engaging constructively in peace talks. \"Given this progress, and recognising that the government of Rwanda has continued to demonstrate its strong commitment to reducing poverty and improving its financial management, Britain will partially restore its general budget support to Rwanda,\" Andrew Mitchell, the outgoing international development secretary, told parliament.</p> <p>A source at the department for international development said on Thursday: \"The new secretary of state, Justine Greening, will be looking extremely closely at the issue of budget support to Rwanda.\"</p> <p>Last month Kagame, once seen as a darling of the west, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jul/25/paul-kagame-rwanda-us-britain\" title=\"\">castigated donors</a> who cut aid and launched a so-called \"dignity fund\" to help wean the country off its dependence on outside help. Rwanda relies on donors for about 40% of its budget.</p> <p>Its foreign minister, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/LMushikiwabo\" title=\"\">Louise Mushikiwabo</a>, responded to the EU cuts on Twitter. \"EU suspending 'new aid' to Rwanda is either old news or designed to mislead,\" she posted. \"No such decision has been taken.\"</p> <p>Kagame and Congolese president Joseph Kabila are due to join a UN crisis meeting in New York on Thursday. On Monday Hillary Clinton, the US secretary of state, met both leaders to push for a solution, only for Kabila to make indirect reference to Rwanda's alleged meddling in his speech before the UN general assembly on Tuesday.</p> <p>Aid agencies warn that the situation on the ground is worsening and the UN's refugee agency has called for an additional $40m (\u00a325m) to help those displaced by fighting.</p> <p>M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res reported that its staff now fear for their safety. \"It's alarming that our Congolese colleagues are compelled to join the thousands of people currently displaced in the region,\" said Jan-Peter Stellema, MSF's operations manager. \"It's a strong indication of how fear has escalated, how people believe the situation will go from bad to worse. It also shows the increasing challenge to deliver medical aid to those in need.\"</p> <p>Franz Rauchenstein, head of the International Committee of the Red Cross delegation in Congo, added: \"The security in the east of the country has deteriorated further.

  "<p>On Christmas day five years ago, <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0806293/\" title=\"George Sluizer\">George Sluizer</a> had an aneurysm. The director was in France at the time. He was taken to hospital in a coma. One doctor hesitated before giving up on him. \"Everything said zero. But he thought he saw a light in my eye,\" says Sluizer.</p> <p>He was taken to a specialist hospital in Lyon. There was no helicopter: \"I went by ambulance as a dead person for five hours, without blood and without oxygen in my heart or my brain.\" When Sluizer finally flickered back into consciousness, he instructed the doctors to get a move on as he had to fly back to LA. He had decided that he needed to finish a film.</p> <p>Four weeks in intensive care and five years of recuperation later, the director, now 80, has completed the movie he began more than 20 years ago. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/oct/19/river-phoenix-film-dark-blood\" title=\"\">Dark Blood</a> is a story, he says, of \"three people in the desert\": Judy Davis, Jonathan Pryce and, in his last screen role, River Phoenix.</p> <p>Phoenix plays an unnamed young man, disturbed and embittered, mourning his wife and waiting for the apocalypse in a nuclear testing site in the Utah desert. Davis and Pryce are an affluent Hollywood couple whose Bentley breaks down. They are rescued,&#xa0;but then held captive by Phoenix's character.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2003/oct/24/1\" title=\"\">Phoenix died of an accidental drugs overdose</a> 11 days before the shoot was due to wrap. Sluizer all but threw in the towel. The production was closed down. Several key scenes hadn't been shot. The rights issues were daunting.</p> <p>Instead, he made several more features: Brit thriller Crimetime (1996) with Sadie Frost and Stephen Baldwin; Brussels-set drama The Commissioner (1998); and Jos\u00e9 Saramago adaptation The Stone Raft (2002). As his health faltered again, he became more wary about handling a full film crew, so he made a small documentary. <a href=\"www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/i-saw-ariel-sharon-murder-2-palestinian-toddlers-in-lebanon-1.325540\" title=\"\">Homeland (2010)</a> was about the plight of Palestinian refugee families, and its attacks on Ariel Sharon over his part in the Sabra and Shatila massacre caused controversy. Sluizer was back in the public consciousness. But by then, he had already started reviving Dark Blood: \"I guess I am a craftsman, in the sense that I don't like unfinished products.\"</p> <p>At the time of his death in 1993, Phoenix was regarded as one of the most exciting actors in Hollywood. Nicknamed <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/where-were-you-when-river-phoenix-died-the-vegan-james-dean-is-being-mourned-by-teenagers-from-ilkley-to-bristol-says-rose-rouse-1502720.html\" title=\"\">\"the vegan James Dean\"</a>, he emulated his idol in both looks and a high ratio of impact to movies shot. He was both teen idol and method actor and his performances in My Own Private Idaho, Running On Empty and Stand By Me were enough to generate huge excitement about his future.</p> <p>In the two decades since his death, it is Phoenix's younger brother, Joaquin (formerly Leaf), who has emerged from the siblings (Summer, Rain and Liberty) with the biggest screen career. When Sluizer started editing Dark Blood, there was speculation that he might be invited to dub his brother's voice. But the family made it clear they did not want to participate in the release. The director blames journalists (\"they're worse than pimps\") for stirring up ill-feeling around the project. Sluizer insists he never had any intention of approaching Joaquin and denies he is revisiting Dark Blood for financial gain. He personally funded most of the post-production and doesn't have rights to screen the film outside the festival circuit.</p> <p>Reviving interest in the film's star was not his goal, he says: \"I make films and tell stories. I use actors to tell those stories. This is not a film about River.\" He says he doesn't know how a new generation will respond to Phoenix, but he is still \"bombarded\" by fans of the star who write to express their gratitude that they will soon be able to see the film: \"Some are totally, totally devoted to him. He was special in the sense that he was very instinctive. He was dyslexic, which meant he couldn't learn two lines without making a mistake. That meant he had to understand what he said, to feel it. That gave him a certain strength.\" He never played a scene the same way twice, says Sluizer. He was a restless presence.</p> <p>Earlier this year, the director was given more bad news regarding his own health. \"The most optimistic doctor gave me six months. The least optimistic said, you should die before you get out of my office!\" He remains cheerfully pragmatic: \"Stubbornness gets you nowhere. People think that if you have a lot of willpower, that will help. Well, the doctors say that's bullshit. But every day I wake up and say: oh, I am still here. That's the way it is.\"</p> <p>\u2022 Dark Blood premiered at the <a href=\"http://www.filmfestival.nl/publiek/films/dark-blood\" title=\"Netherlands film festival\">Netherlands film festival</a>.</p>",

Kings and mosques dominate Saudi notes. Emirati designs feature coffee pots sparrowhawks and falcons \u2013 reminders of desert traditions.

  "<p>What does it take to get you out of bed in the morning when your in tray is piled sky high with the woes of the planet?</p> <p>Guardian Sustainable Business chairman Jo Confino did his best to get up close and personal with the panel at last week's quarterly debate on the challenges of staying positive in the face of adversity.</p> <h2>Fish stocks and the health of the oceans</h2> <p>Peter Hajipieris, director of sustainable and external affairs at frozen food giant Birds Eye Iglo, was bursting with positivity. This despite the fact that 30% of his company's business is frozen fish, and scientists have warned that the world's fish stocks are rapidly depleting.</p> <p>Confino asked him: \"With <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/sep/17/cod-pass-notes-3248?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">only 120 'old' cod in the North Sea</a>, what's it like to work in an industry where the global situation is so dire? When you look at what your company does and what you personally do against the challenge, do you ever go home and think, 'in 20 years there may not be a fish business'?\"</p> <p>Hajipieris, however, is a man who sees the oceans as half full rather than half empty. The Pacific Ocean alone is 64m square miles, he points out \u2013 a vast expanse that together with the other oceans covers three quarters of the planet. \"We have to make the sea work,\" he says.</p> <p>But the key to staying focused and positive, he says, is to surround yourself with like-minded companies. \"We really believe in collaboration, including with our competitors. The challenges are much bigger than any one company or country. We get that. You have to choose your battles and decide where you can make a difference. We focus on the continuity of food supply.\"</p> <p>Confino persisted: \"But on a personal side, how do you manage yourself when you clearly see what's happening in the world? Do you ever switch from being hopeful to being pessimistic?\"</p> <p>No, Hajipieris said. \"I genuinely believe that the planet and humans have of way of balancing themselves, but the time scale is longer than we are used to ... I'm an eternal optimist. I don't give up. And if I did, we wouldn't have a food supply, and our consumers depend on that.\"</p> <p>However, there were moments of frustration, especially when the company's efforts were misreported in the media, he added.</p> <h2>How to influence other companies</h2> <p>Edward Butt, vice-president of sustainability at Tate &amp; Lyle, was somewhat more introspective. \"The sustainability professional needs a certain skill set,\" he said. \"One has to be able to influence people when you may not have direct control or seniority over them. You have to work through the company, try to align your sustainability objectives with their objectives, such as increasing sales in a sustainable part of the business.\"</p> <p>\"But do you ever feel that you are pushing a rock up a hill?\" Confino asked. \"That people are stuck in an old way of doing things?\"</p> <p>Butt said it was easier to push a sustainability message when you are selling to other businesses instead of consumers. He pointed out that Tate &amp; Lyle now supplies the food industry \u2013 having sold its sugar and golden syrup brands two years ago.</p> <p>\"Most consumers don't buy green. It's the same thing with socially responsible investment. It's a niche market. But if you are supplying the likes of Tesco and Walmart, they get sustainability. If they don't have sustainability of supply, in 25 years, they won't be here. It makes it an easier job.\"</p> <p>He said big businesses' awareness of sustainability had increased dramatically over the past 10 to 15 years. \"It could be argued that business is now giving more leadership than government.\"</p> <h2>Focusing on achievements</h2> <p>John Revess, director of sustainability for packaging company Rexam, said the strides made in sustainability over the past 20 years, with lighter materials and a tripling of recycling rates, helped motivate him.</p> <p>\"We face challenges, and internally it's never easy, but we are all catalysts for change. Business as usual is not what we do. For me looking back over time and seeing we are making progress makes me feel good.\"</p> <p>Confino asked whether the same pace of change could be kept up, or whether the \"low-hanging fruit\" had already been picked.</p> <p>Revess said he had faith in human ingenuity. \"There will be new materials, new ways of using those materials, and new supply chains that will allow us to deliver sustainability targets. Continuous improvement never finishes.\"</p> <p>But would it be enough to meet the scale of the challenge, Confino persisted, citing rising sea levels and the catastrophic impacts of climate change forecast to be around the corner. Was wholesale change of the system now required to avert disaster?</p> <p>Revess quoted the Serenity Prayer: \"God, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, the courage to change the things I can and the wisdom to know the difference\", saying he could not do anything to stop the melting of the ice cap. \"I accept that. My job is to deliver within my sphere of influence of the packaging we produce, deliver food to consumers with less impact on the planet.\"</p> <p>Butt agreed: \"For me, sustainability is a journey. You can't manage everything every day but you can chop it up into pieces and work on those pieces. If you are motivated by an environmental ethic, as I am, there will be ups and downs, but it's about challenging yourself and your colleagues to keep going and take one step at a time.\"</p> <h2>Speak to people in their own language</h2> <p>Ian Hill, chief sustainability officer at BT's broadband supplier, Openreach, said sustainability professionals could have an impact if they used the right language for their audience and spoke to people on their own terms. It was important not to focus too much on the word \"sustainability\" itself, he said.</p> <p>\"What matters to people [in the company] is their own safety and the fact that they are connecting communities.\" Similarly, customers want services. \"The fact that we are doing something that lowers their carbon footprint is welcome, but not a focus.\"</p> <p>There was a suggestion from the audience that the views of young people, who would be most affected by the changes of the planet, should be taken on board to shake companies out of complacency.</p> <p>Revess said: \"Young people may be angry but they aren't doing very much about it when it comes to building a recycling society. It's the middle-aged people who are making sure they recycle things at home.\"</p> <h2>Time to take risks</h2> <p>To wind up, Confino asked what risk the panellists would be prepared to take to bring about a step-change at their companies.</p> <p>Hajipieris said he would take most of the marketing budget and spend it on advertising its sustainability efforts. Hill suggesting putting more of the operational budget into research. Revess wanted to set more visionary targets that would require a leap in innovation to achieve, such as those set by Unilever or Marks &amp; Spencer.</p> <p>Butt said: \"I think the best idea came from the floor today. I'd have some young people come into some board meetings and see what happens.\"</p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by </strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/guardian-professional\" title=\"Guardian Professional\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

  "<p>Early in August, the Associated Press <a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/story/2012-08-02/immigration-prison/56689394/1\">reported</a> that America's three largest private prison companies, the <a href=\"http://thecca360.com/\">Corrections Corporation of America</a> (CCA), GEO Group, Inc and Management and Training Corp spent in the region of $45m over the past 10 years in lobbying state and federal governments. During the same period, these companies saw their profits soar as they scored more government contracts.</p> <p>During the same period, various pieces of legislation got passed ensuring that immigrant detention, in particular, would remain a lucrative growth market. The companies get defensive, however, if anyone attempts to draw a connection between their lobbying efforts and their booming businesses. But whatever the purpose of the lobbying, the very fact that these companies, which perform a public service using taxpayer funds, are first and foremost profit-making entities highlights the flawed incentivisation of the private prison model and its growing presence in the American criminal justice system.</p> <p>I'll get to the lobbying in a moment, but first let's have a look at that flawed incentive. Thanks to mandatory sentencing laws and the \"war on drugs\", the prison population has exploded over the past 30 years \u2013 to the point where it has become an untenable burden on state budgets. As a result, many state lawmakers have begun to look at ways to reduce their prison populations. This is good for society, as needlessly locking people up for excessive periods for nonviolent crimes has proven to be counter-productive and cost-prohibitive \u2013 not to mention inhumane.</p> <p>This is terrible news for the private prison business, however, as they are reliant on state and federal governments to provide them with their customer base: that is, bodies to fill their cells.</p> <p>The CCA highlighted its concerns over this potential downturn in demand for services in its <a href=\"http://ir.correctionscorp.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=117983&amp;p=irol-reportsannual\">Annual Report</a> to shareholders in 2010:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"The demand for our facilities and services could be adversely affected by the relaxation of enforcement efforts, leniency in conviction or parole standards and sentencing practices or through the decriminalization of certain activities that are currently proscribed by our criminal laws. For instance, any changes with respect to drugs and controlled substances or illegal immigration could affect the number of persons arrested, convicted, and sentenced thereby potentially reducing demand for correctional facilities to house them.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>As it turns out, the CCA is doing just fine. Its revenue in 2010 was a record $1.67bn, an increase of $46m from 2009. Half of that revenue came from contracts with states, and 43% of it came from federal contracts with the US Marshals, the Bureau of Prisons and ICE. Since 9/11, the number of immigrants held in detention has grown exponentially, and the number held in private prisons (not just the CCA's facilities) has increased during that period by 206%, <a href=\"http://sentencingproject.org/doc/publications/inc_Dollars_and_Detainees.pdf\">according to a report (pdf)</a> by the Sentencing Project.</p> <p>The companies maintain that their lobbying efforts have nothing to do with this expansion and insist that it is their policy to \"expressly prohibit their lobbyists from working to pass or oppose immigration legislation\", such as the Arizona immigration bill SB1070, which provides for the mandatory detention of immigrants who cannot produce papers on request. In an email to me, the CCA's spokesperson, Steve Owen, stated his company's position as follows:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"Allow me to strongly reiterate that it is CCA's longstanding corporate policy not to take positions on any legislation at any level of government involving detainment, crime or sentencing policies.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Since it is not to influence custodial policy, where are the private prison firms spending those millions of lobbying dollars? On a state level, it's difficult to ascertain exactly where the funds are directed, as each state has different disclosure requirements for lobbyists. But <a href=\"http://www.justicepolicy.org/research/2614\">a report compiled by the Justice Policy Institute</a> issued in 2011 and using data from the National Institute on Money in State Politics found that between 2003 and 2010, the CCA contributed a total of $1,552,350 to state election campaigns, with its efforts concentrated in California, Florida and Georgia. (Of these contributions, approximately half was to candidates, more than a third was to party committees and around one tenth was spent on ballot measures.) Contracts with the state of California account for 13% of the CCA's total revenue, and Georgia is home to the CCA-run Stewart Detention Center, the largest immigrant detention center in the country.</p> <p>At a federal level, it is much easier to find out exactly where lobbying efforts have been directed. For instance, on the federal government's official lobbying disclosure website, it is possible to do a search to see exactly how much each private prison company has spent in any given year on lobbying efforts, and to find the specific issues they lobbied on. So, in this CCA lobbying report from 2008 (<a href=\"http://soprweb.senate.gov/index.cfm?event=\" choosefields&amp;reset=\"1&quot;&quot;\">see pdf</a>), it clearly states in box 16 that the \"specific lobbying issues\" were the \"HR1889 (Private Prison Information Act); all provisions and HR1890 (Public Safety Act); all provisions.\"</p> <p>The purpose of the latter bill, <a href=\"http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/110/hr1890\">HR1890</a>, was to \"ensure that the incarceration of inmates is not provided by private contractors or vendors and that persons charged with or convicted of an offense against the US shall be housed in facilities managed and maintained by federal, state or local governments\".</p> <p>The bill died in committee. So the CCA lobbied and came out on the winning side against a bill that would have ended privatization of prison services. Whether that fits with the CCA's stated policy of not taking positions on \"any legislation at any level of government involving detainment\" may be moot, for I'm sure its shareholders would feel that those were lobbying dollars well spent.</p> <p>The private prison companies insist that their lobbying and campaign donations are above board and legally compliant. They are corporations in the business of making profit, and so you cannot really blame them for doing whatever it takes to achieve that end.</p> <p>It is their political enablers, the lawmakers who accept millions of dollars from these corporations, who ought to be doing some serious soul-searching. Of all the public services to be outsourced, incarceration, where the state deprives a person of their liberty and assumes responsibility for his or her mental and physical well-being, is not one to be auctioned for campaign contributions.</p>",
  "<p>My husband, Haydn Davies Jones, who has died aged 88, was a leading practitioner and academic in the residential care of children. A lifelong socialist, he believed that everyone deserved a chance.</p> <p>Haydn loved Wales, its rugby, music, language and literature. He was born in the mining community of Penrhiwceiber, south Wales. After serving in the Fleet Air Arm, he returned to Aberystwyth to complete his history degree. We met at a hop on the pier. After miles on the prom and lectures on the Jacobite plots (his thesis), he proposed to me on Constitution Hill with a box of chocolates. We married in 1949.</p> <p>Haydn spent five years as an instructor-lieutenant in the Royal Navy, helping prisoners in the detention barracks and working with psychiatrists and probation officers. He left to be second-in-command, then captain, of the Wellesley Nautical school, Blyth, Northumberland, an approved school for 140 boys, mostly committed by the courts. His approach was open, firm and fair. He introduced housemasters to work on a more personal level and began the Duke of Edinburgh award scheme, leading 20 boys on the Pennine Way in winter.</p> <p>In 1961 he became a lecturer at Newcastle University, responsible for a Home Office-funded course for senior staff mainly from residential childcare. He lectured throughout the university on sociology and delinquency. He was the impartial chairman of the Cumbrian Youth Committee and served on the parole board of Durham prison.</p> <p>During a sabbatical, he lectured at colleges throughout Europe and was a member of the international Rasmussen group of professionals in his field, involved with residential care of children. He became interested in the role of the social pedagogue and a holistic approach to education and care, working closely with children in practical ways to help them take responsibility for their own lives.</p> <p>Haydn was the British representative of the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale des Communaut\u00e9s Educatives, the largest international association for people working with children and young people. He edited and contributed to their publication Living with Others As a Profession and also wrote several monographs on social pedagogy, in which there is now a growing interest in the UK.</p> <p>Haydn was never happier than he was when striding the mountains of Britain or Austria with family and friends, sporting his Austrian Alpine Club sweater, baggy breeches and red stockings and wielding his ice axe.</p> <p>He is survived by me, our children, Geraint and Rhiannon, and grandsons Christopher and Andrew.</p>",
  "<p>\"999. What's Your emergency?\" Reassuring words in a moment of crisis for the 31m callers each year, they are also music to the ears of TV commissioners \u2013 and familiar to viewers of the current Channel 4 show of the same name. Shows such as Coppers, The Force, Helicopter Heroes, Police Interceptors and Extreme A&amp;E fill the TV schedules. And there are more: Junior Doctors: Your Life in the Their Hands, Great Ormond Street, 24 Hours in A&amp;E, and One Born Every Minute. We can't seem to get enough of programmes featuring those people we rely on in extreme situations.</p> <p>So what is it that makes these observational documentaries so attractive to viewers? For one thing they are simple and gripping, throwing up a steady stream of real-life dramas. In 999 What's your Emergency in which we follow phone operators taking 999 calls in Blackpool, we're shown a compelling mix of moments of crisis, a social context for what we're watching, and the odd cheery yarn to provide some light relief.</p> <p>As one might expect in a seaside town renowned for occasional bouts of booze and excess, the footage is sometimes upsetting. When a 999 operator tells someone to \"pump the chest hard and fast\", the news is rarely good. But the show can also be instructive \u2013 who knew there was quite such a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/sep/15/mephedrone-usage-children-drug-workers\" title=\"\">Mephedrone</a> problem in Blackpool? \u2013 and even occasionally funny. \"Suze, vibrator stuck in anus?\" asks a genuinely puzzled operator, desperate to know if this constitutes a genuine emergency.</p> <p>But many of these shows can, at times, also leave viewers feeling slightly uncomfortable; wondering just how voyeuristic our enjoyment is. And sometimes you have to wonder why anybody involved allowed themselves to be filmed. Channel 4's documentaries commissioning editor Mark Raphael says he never fails to be surprised at the ease with which participants agree to sign the necessary release forms. But, he argues, our love of emergency services documentaries isn't based on voyeurism, although they of course bring natural drama.</p> <p>\"When a police car or an ambulance whips by in the street it is natural we crane our necks to wonder what is going on,\" he says. But, beyond that, these shows also offer reassurance that when things go wrong, there are people whose job it is to care.&#xa0;\"People like to feel there are good people out there,\" he says. \"People don't watch to reaffirm their life but people watch 24 Hours in A&amp;E because they feel uplifted.\"</p> <p>Along with One Born Every Minute, 24 Hours in A&amp;E uses a fixed-rig camera unit, which means people are less guarded and \"more truthful\" Raphael argues. \"If you have a camera operator and a sound guy you can never be as real or as close.\"</p> <p>Certainly I won't forget the dad-to-be on One Born Every Minute wondering whether to eat a custard cream; or the one who kept shifting in his seat, concentrating on his own comfort while his wife had rather less of her own. These very odd but very truthful moments.</p> <p>Jo Bishop, series producer of the BBC's Junior Doctors: Your Life in their Hands argues that medical shows in particular are comfortingly familiar \u2013 for all of us who have experienced medical care and the NHS workers she says also avidly tune in.\"There are extremes of life and death and what it's all about, what makes us live and what makes us die,\" she says. \"[But you also] meet the nurses who deal with these situations and you see them eating sticky buns or talking about their holidays. They are just like us.\"</p> <p>Bishop is also realistic enough to admit that there are so many of these kinds of shows because trends are important in TV commissioning \u2013 and currently emergency services observational documentaries are strutting the TV equivalent of the Paris catwalk. &#xa0;Or as she prefers to put it:&#xa0;\"It's like the ice-cream salesman. You get a lot in one area because they know it's good territory.\"</p>",
  "<p>South Sudan's rainy season has overwhelmed aid efforts in refugee camps sheltering more than 100,000 Sudanese refugees in Maban county, say international aid agencies.</p> <p>The remote <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2012/apr/26/refugees-flee-to-south-sudan-camps\" title=\"\">Jamam</a> camp, about 75km west of the border with Sudan, is one of the worst affected, effectively cut off because of roads made impassable by rains. But conditions are bad across the region, according to <a href=\"http://www.internationalmedicalcorps.org.uk/\" title=\"\">International Medical Corps UK</a> (IMC).</p> <p>\"Flooding has inundated our compounds outside the camps and staff now have to sleep in the refugee camps in the clinic,\" said Sean Casey, IMC country director for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/south-sudan\" title=\"\">South Sudan</a>. \"It is also difficult to get supplies in, as the river is swallowing up our vehicles.\"</p> <p>Aid agencies warn of a major outbreak of diseases such as hepatitis E, malaria and cholera due to severe malnutrition, water shortages and contaminated drinking water. At least 16 refugees have died from an outbreak of the water-borne hepatitis E in the past few weeks, <a href=\"http://www.oxfam.org/en/pressroom/pressrelease/2012-09-21/new-sites-south-sudan-refugee-camps-must-be-found-blue-nile-confli\" title=\"\">according to Oxfam</a>, and there are fears this number could rise.</p> <p>\"We've got an emergency on our hands which is worsening day by day and it has the potential to get bigger with more <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/refugees\" title=\"\">refugees</a> coming in,\" said Casey. \"We have huge logistical constraints and a very vulnerable population. Hepatitis E is a new challenge, along with concerns about water supply and our capacity to respond because of access constraints.\"</p> <p>After <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2012/may/17/south-sudan-border-conflict-sudan?INTCMP=ILCNETTXT3487\" title=\"\">a year of conflict</a> between Sudanese government troops in Blue Nile state and South Kordofan, 80,000 refugees have fled across the border into South Sudan, to the inhospitable region of Maban county, now housing 106,000 refugees.</p> <p>Maban county's four refugee camps face recurrent flooding due to heavy rains in September and October. Overflowing rivers and flooding make conditions treacherous for refugees and aid agencies, and creating infrastructure to hold the water back has proved impossible. \"Resources on all sides are really limited and food is taking priority,\" said Casey. \"If we can't get supplies through, then hepatitis E will be just one of many concerns.\"</p> <p>Aid agencies are beginning to move the 20,000-30,000 refugees from Jamam to Gendrassa, a refugee camp 70km away that so far remains untouched by flooding.</p> <p>Oxfam and IMC claim this is only a short-term solution due to overcrowded camps; the <a href=\"http://www.unhcr.org.uk/\" title=\"\">UN Refugee Agency</a> estimates another 60,000 people will arrive from Sudan in November and December, when the dry season makes movement possible.</p> <p>According to IMC, one in five children in the refugee camps is malnourished. The global acute malnutrition rate stands at about 22% for children under five and 32% for pregnant women and new mothers.</p> <p>\"Malnutrition among pregnant woman and new mothers is the worst, and they are also more susceptible to hepatitis E,\" said Casey, who suspects malnutrition is particularly high among women because they give food to children and men first.</p> <p>Casey said malnutrition could also be attributed to a delay in the arrival of rations. Exacerbating the problem further, the supplies include a wheat that must be crushed before cooking, which means women have to sell a share of their food to be able to prepare their meals.</p> <p>Maban county is among the most remote and least developed areas in South Sudan. During the rains, the only way to get aid in is by plane or boat. Oxfam says this \u2013 combined with the high cost of fuel, and the scarcity of materials caused by South Sudan's conflict-fuelled economic crisis \u2013 has made the humanitarian response in Maban one of the world's most expensive.</p> <p>\"A lot of aid workers in Maban have said that this is the hardest place they have worked,\" said Casey. \"It is hard to find even the most basic things, like enough food to feed staff. It's becoming clear we are going to need another site. Many may need to be moved outside Maban, [because] it's all under water, just a mud soup.\"</p> <p>Oxfam has also called on the government of South Sudan and the international community to prioritise finding new sites. Pauline Ballaman, head of Oxfam's emergency response in Maban, said: \"The Maban camps alone are not the answer to the crisis. There is simply not enough ground water to sustain so many people, and now heavy rains have left people wading through mud to get basic services. So far, agencies have managed to prevent a major crisis during the rainy season. However, agencies cannot keep trucking in water and air-dropping food year after year. If the refugees stay where they are, this will require a sustained supply of funding.\"</p> <p>Casey said the ideal solution to the crisis in Maban county is for Sudan to allow humanitarian access to civilians affected by the fighting in Blue Nile and South Kordofan, where Khartoum is trying to quell rebel movements backed by South Sudan.</p> <p>The leaders of Sudan and South Sudan have reached a deal that will allow for the resumption of oil exports. Earlier this year, a dispute over oil transit fees prompted South Sudan to shut down shipments, but the leaders of Sudan and South Sudan have since brokered an agreement that will allow for the resumption of oil exports. Salva Kiir, the South Sudanese president, said the two countries would sign a \"protocol of collaboration\" on Thursday, but disputes about the contested Abyei region and border demarcation have yet to be resolved.</p>",
  "<p>They widen waistlines, lighten wallets and even spread anti-Japanese sentiments. To critics, their yearly appearance is associated with waste and ostentation.</p> <p>But China's centuries-long love affair with the mooncake is unstoppable. Eaten to celebrate the mid-autumn festival, when friends gather to admire the harvest moon, they have evolved, with the country's embrace of consumerism, to reach new heights of luxury and exoticism.</p> <p>\"It's just like how Americans eat turkey. Nobody knows why we eat them, we just do,\" said 25-year-old Tang Cong, who works for an internet company in Beijing.</p> <p>Round or square, the palm-sized pastries \u2013 sometimes chewy, sometimes flaky \u2013 are decorated with patterns and traditionally filled with pastes such as lotus seed and sometimes salted duck egg yolks. As high in fat and sugar as they are rich in flavour, they are usually eaten in small wedges, accompanied by tea.</p> <p>Their increasingly esoteric fillings now include ham and rose petal, sea cucumber and peacock.

Last autumn, the makers of Angry Birds produced a special edition of the game with golden mooncake slices instead of eggs.</p> <p>Though mooncakes are rarely eaten by the buyer \u2013 they are generally destined as gifts for friends, employees or business contacts \u2013 they say a lot about the purchaser.</p> <p>\"Young people tend to lean towards H\u00e4agen-Dazs mooncakes; these kinds of stylish mooncake. People who are a little bit older, they're a little bit more sentimental, so they tend to buy more traditional mooncakes, like red bean,\" said Li Heshui, manager at the Beijing wholesaler Shangpin Zhenghua.</p> <p>Financial, technology or media companies are more likely to buy modern versions, while construction firms and manufacturers tend to opt for cheaper, traditional varieties, he added.</p> <p>The pastries can embody not just one's tastes, but even one's political views: last week, as anti-Japanese protests spread through China, a nationalist \u2013 or enterprising \u2013 baker <a href=\"http://shanghaiist.com/2012/09/22/anti-japan-mooncakes.php\" title=\"\">produced a set of four with slogans on top</a> including: \"Bite Little Japan to death!\"</p> <p>But the pastries say as much about the recipient as the donor.</p> <p>\"These mooncakes are for our rich, honourable friends \u2013 high-level leaders and rich businesspeople,\" explained a sales assistant, also surnamed Li, as she sold \"Nobility Promise\" mooncakes at an upmarket shopping mall in central Beijing ahead of this Sunday's festival.</p> <p>A box of 10 \u2013 about the size of a small coffee table \u2013 cost 1,080 yuan (around \u00a3100) and included abalone and sea cucumber varieties.</p> <p>\"Those over there are for our ordinary friends,\" she added, gesturing at individually wrapped ones in the other corner.</p> <p>Soaring prices have prompted authorities to step in and curb the excesses of the mooncake trade in recent years. Regulations now outlaw unnecessarily lavish packaging and the inclusion of expensive bonus gifts, such as high-priced alcohol, in the boxes.</p> <p>\"It was partly because of corruption, but also it was just a waste of resources,\" said an official at the Beijing Association of Roasted Foods and Sweets.</p> <p>Some customers have also grown uneasy at the health implications of the treats, which clock in at around 800 calories apiece. A handful of firms claim to offer versions with lower fat and sugar, somewhat akin to the idea of a healthy Christmas pudding.</p> <p>According to a Chinese news site, one brand boasts that its milk and papaya-flavoured versions confer a range of aesthetic benefits, including a more youthful appearance and larger breasts.</p> <p>But there are signs that even with such innovations, mooncakes may have become too popular for their own good.</p> <p>Aware that clients may be inundated with boxes, many companies now send them coupons instead. Recipients can order mooncakes \u2013 or something else entirely, such as French red wine, Chinese tea or Spanish olive oil, said Mr Li.</p> <p>Tang said younger people rarely bothered exchanging mooncakes with friends these days.</p> <p>\"Now it's just a business thing. This year my boss gave me two or three boxes, but I haven't bought mooncakes for anyone,\" she said.</p> <p>\"I actually don't really like them.\"</p>",

If it works, and the Lib Dems remain in government after 2015 (at a conference fringe I heard one speaker joking about young people in 2020 talking about having lived all their adult lives \"under a Lib Dem government), Clegg will be seen as one of the great political figures of our age.

Stubborn and principled, they ignored the cynics who mocked them. They simply refused to give up on their dreams. They refused to accept that Liberals would never again be in government. And they refused to accept that Liberalism, that most decent, enlightened and British of creeds, which did so much to shape our past, would not shape our future. We think we\u2019ve got it tough now. But it was much, much tougher in their day. It was only their resolve, their resilience and their unwavering determination that kept the flickering flame of Liberalism alive through our party\u2019s darkest days.</p> <p>At our last conference in Gateshead, I urged you to stop looking in the rear view mirror as we journey from the party of opposition that we were, to the party of government we are becoming. But before we head off on the next stage of our journey, I want you to take one last look in that mirror to see how far we\u2019ve come. I tell you what I see.</p> <p>I see generations of Liberals marching towards the sound of gunfire. And yes, I see them going back to their constituencies to prepare for government. It took us a while but we got there in the end.</p> </blockquote> <p>Younger colleagues were wondering why Clegg started going on about \"the sound of gunfire\". It was a reference to <a href=\"http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Jo_Grimond\">Joe Grimond.</a></p> <p>Then Clegg finishes with this.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>These are the people on whose shoulders we stand. They never flinched, and nor should we. We owe it to them to seize the opportunity they gave us, but which they never had. Taking on the vested interests. Refusing to be bullied. Refusing to give up. Always overturning the odds. Fighting for what we believe in, because we know that nothing worthwhile can be won without a battle. A fair, free and open society. That\u2019s the prize.

It's embargoed until 3pm, which means I'm now free to publish. So, here goes...</p> <p>Here are the main points from the speech.</p> <p><strong>\u2022 Clegg said he would not allow the top rate of income tax to be cut below 45% during this parliament.</strong> When George Osborne announced it was being cut from 50% to 45% in the spring budget, many Tories expressed the hope that this would be the first step towards getting it down to 40%, the level it used to be before Labour raised it during the credit crunch. Osborne reportedly wanted to take it down to 40% in one go. But Clegg said he would not accept any further change before 2015.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Now that we have brought the top rate of tax down to 45p \u2013 a level, let\u2019s not forget, that is still higher than throughout Labour\u2019s 13 years in office \u2013 there can be no question of reducing it further in this parliament. All future cuts in personal taxation must pass one clear test: do they help people on low and middle incomes get by and get on? It\u2019s as simple as that.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>\u2022 But he defended the decision to cut the top rate of income tax from 50% to 45% in the spring budget.</strong> He said he had \u201cinsisted\u201d on getting an increase in the tax allowance into the budget and that he had \u201cconceded\u201d the top rate tax cut. But he said he stood by the decision as a whole.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Why? Because as liberals, we want to see the tax on work reduced, the tax on unearned wealth increased, and the system as a whole tilted in favour of those on low and middle incomes. The budget delivered all three.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>\u2022 He announced that Paddy Ashdown will return to the Lib Dem frontline, taking charge of the party's 2015 election campaign.</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I can announce today that Paddy Ashdown has agreed to front up our campaign as chair of the 2015 general election team. I must admit, I\u2019m not quite sure I\u2019m ready for all those urgent emails and 5am phone calls. But I can\u2019t think of anyone I\u2019d rather have by my side. Paddy, it\u2019s great to have you back.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>\u2022 He said the Lib Dems should stop speculating about what they might do in the event of a hung parliament because this was ultimately a decision for the electorate.</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There\u2019s been a lot of discussion on the fringe of this conference about our party\u2019s next steps; about our relationship with the other parties; and about what we should do in the event of another hung parliament. It\u2019s the sort of discussion politicians love \u2013 full of speculation and rumour. But I have to tell you, it is all based on a false, and deeply illiberal, assumption: that it is we, rather than the people, who get to decide. In a democracy, politicians take their orders from the voters.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>\u2022 He claimed that the Lib Dems were the only party who could be trusted on the economy and trust to deliver a fairer society.</strong></p> <p><strong>\u2022 He accused Labour, and particularly Ed Balls, of financial irresponsibility</strong>. Balls was mentioned three times, while Ed Miliband was not mentioned at all. Clegg claimed that the poor suffered the most as a result of Labour's mismanagement of the economy.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Labour may have thought it was funny, after crashing the economy and racking up record debts, to leave a note on David Laws\u2019 desk saying: \u201cthere\u2019s no money left\u201d. But it\u2019s no joke for the most vulnerable in our society; the people Labour claim to represent but let down the most. So let\u2019s take no more lectures about betrayal. It was Labour who plunged us into austerity and it is we, the Liberal Democrats, who will get us out.</p> </blockquote> <p>And he accused Balls of offering \u201ca fantasy world where there is no 'boom and bust' and the money never runs out\u201d.</p> <p><strong>\u2022 He also attacked Conservatives who believe deregulation is the best solution to the country's economic problems.</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The idea that if government just deregulated a bit more as Liam Fox proposes, or borrowed and spent a bit more as Ed Balls proposes, we would, at a stroke, achieve strong and lasting growth, is just not credible. In my experience, if you\u2019re being attacked by Liam Fox from one side, and Ed Balls from the other, you\u2019re in the right place.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>\u2022 He said that the government was willing to act \u201cagain and again and again\u201d to get growth going.</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>If Plan A really was as rigid and dogmatic as our critics claim, I\u2019d be demanding a Plan B, and getting Danny and Vince to design it. But it isn\u2019t. Which is why you were right, earlier this week, to overwhelmingly reject the call for us to change our economic course. We have taken big and bold steps to support demand and boost growth. And we stand ready to do so again and again and again until self-sustaining growth returns.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>\u2022 He launched a veiled attack on the Conservatives for not fully supporting green growth.</strong> The Lib Dems would \u201chold [the Conservatives] to their promises\u201d on the environment, he said.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We will not succeed in this last task unless we can see off that most short-sighted of arguments: that we have to choose between going green and going for growth. Decarbonising our economy isn\u2019t just the right thing to do; it\u2019s a fantastic economic opportunity.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>\u2022 He said that austerity was essential because, if Britain lost control of its finances, it would lose its independence</strong>.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>In the coming years, some countries will get their own house in order. But some will not. Those that do will continue to write their own budgets, set their own priorities and shape their own futures. But those that do not will find their right to self-determination withdrawn by the markets, and new rules imposed by their creditors, without warning or clemency.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>\u2022 He suggested that welfare spending was too high.</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>One of the things about governing is it forces you to confront the inconvenient truths oppositions choose to ignore. Like the fact that, over the last 50 years, our economy has grown threefold, but our welfare spending is up sevenfold.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>\u2022 He defined liberalism as giving people \u201cthe freedom to be who you are, the opportunity to be who you could be\u201d.</strong></p> <p><strong>\u2022 He said the Lib Dems must give up being a party of protest.</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I know that there are some in the party \u2013 some in this hall even \u2013 who, faced with several more years of spending restraint, would rather turn back than press on. Break our deal with the Conservatives, give up on the coalition, and present ourselves to the electorate in 2015 as a party unchanged. It\u2019s an alluring prospect in some ways. Gone would be the difficult choices, the hard decisions, the necessary compromises. And gone too would be the vitriol and abuse, from right and left, as we work every day to keep this government anchored in the centre ground.</p> <p>But conference, I tell you this. The choice between the party we were, and the party we are becoming, is a false one. The past is gone and it isn\u2019t coming back. If voters want a party of opposition \u2013 a \u201cstop the world I want to get off\u201d party \u2013 they\u2019ve got plenty of options, but we are not one of them. There\u2019s a better, more meaningful future waiting for us. Not as the third party, but as one of three parties of government.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>\u2022 He confirmed that the government would give secondary schools a \u201ccatch-up premium\u201d, allowing them to spend \u00a3500 on help for children arriving from primary who are behind in English or maths.</strong></p> <p><strong>\u2022 He said that extremists could take over in the west if governments responded in the wrong way to the threat posed by the global power shift.</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The potential consequences of this shift in power, should we in the west fail to respond, cannot be overstated. Our influence in the world, our standard of living, our ability to fund our public services and maintain our culture of openness and tolerance \u2013 all are in the balance.

Or not. \"Does it work, or if it does work does it have so many negative consequences we shouldn't do it any more?\" posed Cable. \"At some point in the next few months the question will arise, unless growth spontaneously returns, do you do more of it, [and] how do you do it?\"</p> <p>At the same event, John Cridland, the CBI's director general, suggested the major employers' and industrialists' group was open to the government committing to a target to decarbonise the UK's power sector by 2030 - a major commitment which would mean, effectively, that no gas, oil or coal plants could be used to generate electricity in less than two decades time unless still untenable technology was developed to capture and store the carbon and other greenhouse gas emissions.</p> <p>Asked if the CBI would support the target being included in the up-coming Electricity Market Reform bill, Cridland repllied: \"I'm not yet persuaded, but that doesn't mean I'm against it.\" If the CBI was satisfied that including the target would not create \"target fatigue\" and would not delay the bill, \"I'd look at it again\", he added.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-64dc14b6-d64e-4d5c-9471-6703f14f7d1f\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/26/1348665983427/3b65d812-6578-4b73-88be-0d883e3ce1fa-460.jpeg\" alt=\"Vince Cable listens on as Jo Swinson addresses the conference.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Vince Cable sits as Jo Swinson addresses the conference.

But this was not what his committee had found: \"I think there is an interesting question which will arise at some point, which is what Charles Farr has been telling Theresa May everybody is saying to him.

Nick Clegg is trying to forge the Liberal Democrats into a new party \u2013 but his creation is on electoral life-support and it is not yet clear whether it has a viable future.</strong> The Lib Dems used to be a receptacle for the protest vote, buoyed by the hope that electoral reform would eventually give them 100-plus seats in the Commons, but now the protest vote is going elsewhere and, with PR and Lords reform (backdoor PR) off the agenda for years, Clegg is trying to turn the Lib Dems into a mainstream party that can win by first-past-the-post. As Matthew d'Ancona put it <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/nick-clegg/9544637/Cleggmania-is-now-nothing-but-a-distant-memory.html\">in a column recently,</a> he wants \u201cnothing less than to create a third party of government; not an electoral dumping ground for the Undecideds, the Outraged and People Who Still Hate Blair, but a party ready to participate in future coalitions and bring its own distinctive approach to bear on government\u201d. Unfortunately, <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/liberaldemocrats/9493952/Lib-Dems-face-near-wipeout-in-2015-poll-warns.html\">with the polls as they are, </a>this new entity could face virtual electoral wipeout in 2015.</p> <p><strong>2. The Lib Dems seem more committed to ever to the coalition.</strong> This seems strange, given the fact that the decision to go into coalition has led to their collapse in the polls, but the party seems to have realised that it has past the point of no return. It may not know where its journey will end up, but the bridge back to April 2010 is in cinders. The clearest sign of this came when the party endorsed the coalition's key economic strategy, decisively rejecting a call for a Plan B. Clegg also made the point convincingly <a href=\"http://www.libdems.org.uk/speeches_detail.aspx?title=Nick_Clegg%E2%80%99s_rally_speech_at_Liberal_Democrat_Autumn_Conference&amp;pPK=ccad70de-e202-43a8-8778-27555c5e6503\">in his speech to the conference rally on Saturday night.</a> \u201cThis is the first time anyone in modern Britain has experienced a national coalition government,\u201d he said. \u201cWe must show them it is a form of government that works well for them. If we don\u2019t we will have lost not only the argument for having Liberal Democrats in power but for having a third party at all.\u201d In other words, the Lib Dems face an existential threat, and if the coalition fails, the Lib Dems are doomed too.</p> <p><strong>3. The Lib Dems are seeking to reassert their identity \u2013 and the mansion tax, civil liberties and green growth at the heart of it</strong>. Although events have run relatively smoothly on the conference floor, the realisation that the Lib Dems will have to fight an election as a party of government for the first time has triggered an intense debate about the party's identity that has overshadowed events on the fringe. The most provocative contribution came from Richard Reeves, Clegg's former director of strategy, <a href=\"http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/politics/2012/09/case-truly-liberal-party\">whose appeal for undiluted liberalism</a> was seen as an attempt to push the party to the right, but many Lib Dems strongly disagree (see <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/blog/2012/sep/26/nick-clegg-lib-dem-conference-live#block-5062b2d758f9bdd2eeba0249\">8.46am)</a> and think the party would be mad to give up on leftish voters who are attracted by the party's social democratic instincts. The Lib Dems have not resolved the right/left argument, but this week has shown members can unite around three themes: taxing the wealthy (the mansion tax has been championed ad nauseam), defending civil liberties (the leadership got trounced on secret courts, in the best debate on the conference) and green growth (which has become a key dividing line with the Tories).</p> <p><strong>4. Clegg intends to fight the next election.</strong> Clegg has always said he intends to fight the next election, but now, for the first time, people like me are starting to believe that he really means it. Partly that's because of his decision to issue his apology, which would not make much sense if he was planning to abandon ship in 2014. And partly because it's because people who know him well seem to be increasingly certain that he is going to stay on. Sometimes it's the gossip that is particularly persuasive. In the past there were suggestions that his wife Miriam wanted Clegg to stand down before 2015, but <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/blog/2012/sep/22/lib-dem-conference-live-blog-2012#block-505db576c0e38ada80016272\">at the weekend the Financial Times reported that she's opposed to Clegg taking a job in Brussels,</a> because she has decided that the city is too provincial.</p> <p><strong>5. There will be no imminent leadership challenge.</strong> Clegg's personal ratings are dire, but there has been no serious challenge to his leadership <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/blog/2012/sep/26/nick-clegg-lib-dem-conference-live#block-5062b2d758f9bdd2eeba0249\">(Lembit Opik doesn't count)</a> and for the moment his position is perfectly safe. But it might be different in 2013, and as for 2014 \u2013 book your tickets for the conference now. If Clegg has not already suffered an attempt to depose him by then, 2014 should be the moment for a showdown.</p> <p><strong>6. Vince Cable is the party's undisputed leader-in-waiting.</strong> Cable has not done anything disloyal in Brighton, but he used his speech on Monday to advertise his availability, and his credentials as someone who could work with Labour or the Tories, and, with a clutch of polls showing that the party would do better under his leadership, he is now, for the moment, the overwhelming favourite to succeed Clegg. Tim Farron's prospects seem dimmer than they did last year and Chris Huhne \u2013 whose absence leaves Lib Dem firepower much weaker than it was \u2013 is of course, er, otherwise engaged.</p> <p><strong>7. Election manifestos are going to look different in the future because they will clearly differentiate between non-negotiable promises and negotiable ones.</strong> The Lib Dem tuition fee experience, and Clegg's apology, has focused attention on how the party can avoid this problem in the future. \u201cAll parties will need to be more upfront with the British people on what 'tablet of stone' stuff, and the other [promises] that will depend on circumstances,\u201d Clegg said yesterday.</p> <p><strong>8. Coalition government is making government more open.</strong> In the past ministers used to row in private and defend their collective decisions in public. When the coalition launched the two parties tried to play down their differences in public, but now Clegg and his colleagues are so open about their differences with their Tory colleagues that, as this week has demonstrated, it has almost stopped being a story. Danny Alexander proposed a motion implicitly attacking his boss, George Osborne, and the media barely batted an eyelid. Conversations that used to take place behind closed doors are now being conducted in public. It's a notable shift in Whitehall culture.</p> <p><strong>9. The Lib Dems are still overwhelmingly white and male.</strong> The party has no ethnic minority MPs and there seem to be very few ethnic minority delegates at the conference. We have not had a speech from a high-profile Lib Dem woman, although Jo Swinson <a href=\"http://markreckons.blogspot.co.uk/2012/09/jo-swinson-could-be-our-next-leader.html\">(who is being tipped as a future leader) </a>may fill the gap when she speaks. In diversity terms, this party has a very long way to go.</p> <p><strong>10. But it's a great party to join if you want to speak at a party conference.</strong> This week has confirmed that the Lib Dems are still the only main party in British politics who are genuinely comfortable about letting their members debate politics. Labour and the Tories use their conferences to showcase their leaders and their rising stars. If you want to go to party conference, and get involved in debates and speak repeatedly, I'm afraid you haven't got much option. You'll have to join the Lib Dems.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-09-26T11:47:56.335Z\">at 12.47pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5062db8dc0e327c3f7c905d8\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-09-26T10:40:13.359Z\">11.40am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here's more on the planning vote. It's copy from the Press Association.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>A packed hall at the party's conference in Brighton voted almost unanimously to oppose the government's proposals, which include letting home owners build extensions of up to 25ft in their gardens. <br>Local government minister Don Foster was left with the humiliation of being the only speaker to oppose the motion, while only three Lib Dem members voted in favour of the government's plans.</p> <p>Lib Dem councillors lined up one after the other to criticise the plans and the party's leadership for adopting what Foster insisted was a Tory idea which had made it into the coalition agreement. <br>One councillor asked what planet deputy prime minister Nick Clegg and his fellow Lib Dem MPs were on. <br>The emergency motion exposed tensions between the party's MPs and members, who expressed their anger at having another Tory policy foisted upon them. <br>Catharine Smart, from Cambridge, said: \"This proposal will not help growth, it will not speed up construction. It will actually slow it down. You just wonder what planet some of these people are on. <br>\"Just for once these parliamentarians should listen to the little people on the district councils who actually know most about this. Just listen to them and take these stupid ideas away.\" <br>Richard Fagence, from Windsor, Berkshire, said: \"This is not just a mistake, in my opinion. This is a huge mistake. <br>\"Don't even get me started on extensions. <br>\"My back garden is wider than it is deep, if you see what I mean. It's about 32ft deep but you could now develop an extension 26ft deep in old money. <br>\"The motion calls on the coalition government to withdraw these proposals. I would add one word to that: immediately.\" <br>Prue Bray, from Wokingham, Berkshire, said: \"This is not the first coalition policy forced on the party. <br>\"We know in coalition we cannot have everything we want. We understand the need for confidentiality in government. <br>\"But surely it is not beyond us as a party to come up with a better way for the party and parliamentarians to work together so we can avoid situations like this?\" <br>Tim Ward, from Cambridge, said the plans were \"both unnecessary and damaging\". <br>\"Every time one of these daft ideas arrives from government, I have to direct one of my senior officer to researching, analysing and responding to the consultation,\" he said. <br>\"I have an officer working on this as we speak. I would much rather have my officers concentrating on growth.\"</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5062d367c0e327c3f7c905d1\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-09-26T10:05:27.337Z\">11.05am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here's my colleague John Harris's take on the Lib Dem conference.

I thought it was because party conferences are increasingly dominated by lobbyists, rather than activists, but <a href=\"http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/opinion/columnists/danielfinkelstein/article3549498.ece\">in the Times today (paywall) Daniel Finkelstein suggests that there's a wider problem, which relates to the way politics is changing.</a></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Once these events in seaside towns were the gathering places of the representatives of vast movements. Parties had millions of members and were among the biggest voluntary associations in the country. When addressing the party faithful, a leader was addressing a real group, a significant group.</p> <p>But now? The mass party movements are no more. The membership has disappeared. And yet everyone keeps going as if it hasn\u2019t happened.</p> </blockquote> <p>Finkelstein suggests that annual conferences should be abandoned. Much as I like coming, I think he's onto something.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I am not assailing party members. It is fashionable to say they are swivel-eyed or doddery. Me, I\u2019ve always liked them. There\u2019s no part of their strange political obsession that I don\u2019t partake of fully myself. I\u2019ve had a lot to do with Tory party members and overwhelmingly found them kind, intelligent, engaged and committed to their communities. Other party memberships are no less so.</p> <p>But their politics are hardly representative. Not even of the core vote, let alone of swing voters. The biggest move in politics is from the committed to the uncommitted, from those with tribal attachments to those simply keeping score, choosing governments as if they were company managers. And the annual party conference season denies this trend, instead gathering together these unrepresentative people, encouraging them to confirm each other in their own beliefs and exerting pressure on governments and political leaderships to respond.</p> <p>The decline of mass political parties is hugely significant and almost certainly irreversible. And it\u2019s time for reform that reflects this reality. It is wrong, for instance, that what amount to little cliques should be choosing candidates for Parliament. But why not start by ending these annual conferences? A broader convention of supporters every three or four years, perhaps. That should be plenty.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5062b2d758f9bdd2eeba0249\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-09-26T07:46:31.526Z\">8.46am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>There has not been much evidence of plotting against Nick Clegg at the Lib Dem conference, but my colleague <strong>Patrick Kingsley</strong> was at the Liberal Left fringe meeting yesterday where he discovered that an attempted coup is underway. It's being masterminded by Lembit Opik! Here's what Patrick sent me.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Half of Liberal Democrats are dissatisfied with Nick Clegg, according to an activists' poll, but it's been hard to find barefaced dissent at conference. Last night's Liberal&#xa0;Left event was the exception \u2013 former MP Lembit Opik openly demanded that Clegg resign as leader, soliciting support for a petition that calls for Clegg to remain as&#xa0;deputy prime minister, but step away from the running of the party.</p> <p>\"The problem is that the image of the Liberal Democrats is mixed up with the coalition government,\" said Opik. Clegg is too tainted by his relationship with the Tories, he&#xa0;said: if he's not ousted by the next election, \"we'll be throttled to death.\"</p> <p>Currently, the Lib Dem conference cannot fire the Lib Dem leader. But should Opik's petition gather enough support, it would force a vote at the party's spring&#xa0;conference on whether to give delegates the power to sack Clegg. The proposal would need a two-thirds majority to pass.</p> <p>Opik wants Clegg to get on with the business of running the country, and let someone else try to remould the party's image. That someone, he argued, would ideally be&#xa0;a leftish backbencher who comes from the grass-roots. He wouldn't name names \u2013 but party president Tim Farron fits the bill.&#xa0;</p> <p>Opik was speaking at a fringe event hosted by Liberal Left, the party's most left-wing faction \u2013 and led by rebel MP Adrian Sanders, assembly member Stephen Knight,&#xa0;and Liberal Left chair Linda Jack.</p> <p>\"Where next for the Liberal Democrats?\" the panellists asked \u2013 and for many the answer was clear: away from Clegg.</p> <p>\"When your party leader starts to appear on your opponents' leaflets more often than your own,\" said Knight, \"you have to wonder whether or not he's an asset.\"&#xa0;</p> <p>More generally, there were concerns that the Lib Dems have swung too far to the right in recent years. \"There is a feeling that this is no longer our party,\" said Linda&#xa0;Jack, who tabled an amendment on Monday criticising the coalition's deficit plans, which was shot down by party honchos. A decade ago, she argued, social liberals&#xa0;like her were at the centre of the Liberal Democrats. But because so many left-wingers have since left, those who remain are now seen as extremists.</p> <p>Knight was particularly upset at a recent pamphlet on \"Cleggism\" written by Richard Reeves, Clegg's outgoing strategist. Reeves promoted the pamphlet at a think-tank&#xa0;event on Monday \u2013 arguing that the party should abandon their social democratic wing, and redefine themselves as purely big-L Liberal. Sanders said Reeves shouldn't&#xa0;be taken too seriously: his debate was mocked at a meeting of the parliamentary party on Monday. One MP, he said, noted that it was on at the same time as a&#xa0;discussion about assisted dying \u2013 and wondered whether the two events could have been merged.</p> <p>For his part, Sanders stayed clear of saying anything particularly inflammatory. But he suggested that Clegg was stuck in a bubble, and needed to employ more advisers&#xa0;with links to the grassroots.</p> <p>So if this was the revolution, it was a pretty small one. Only 20 people turned up, evidence that not everyone left in the party hankers after rebellion. Sanders said there&#xa0;were no machinations within parliament to depose Clegg, while Opik is a marginal figure, ridiculed for losing one of the Liberal Democrats' safest seats in 2010.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-09-27T10:03:21.626Z\">at 11.03am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5062b11dc0e327c3f7c905bd\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-09-26T07:39:19.760Z\">8.39am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>It's the final day of the Lib Dem conference and Nick Clegg will close the conference with a speech at 2.30pm. Some excerpts have already been released in advance, and The Times, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CxyQqDik2rs\">remembering David Steel,</a> has summed up Clegg's message with a rather brilliant headline (paywall): <a href=\"http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/news/politics/article3549685.ece\">\u201cGo back to your constituencies and prepare for vitriol and abuse.\u201d </a>Here's the quote from the Clegg speech setting it out in full.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I know that there are some in the party \u2013 some in this hall even \u2013 who, faced with several more years of spending restraint, would rather turn back than press on. Break our deal with the Conservatives, give up on the Coalition, and present ourselves to the electorate in 2015 as a party unchanged. It\u2019s an alluring prospect in some ways. Gone would be the difficult choices, the hard decisions, the necessary compromises. And gone too would be the vitriol and abuse, from Right and Left, as we work every day to keep this Government anchored in the centre ground.</p> <p>But conference, I tell you this. The choice between the party we were, and the party we are becoming, is a false one. The past is gone and it isn\u2019t coming back. If voters want a party of opposition \u2013 a \u201cstop the world I want to get off\u201d party \u2013 they\u2019ve got plenty of options, but we are not one of them. There\u2019s a better, more meaningful future waiting for us. Not as the third party, but as one of three parties of government.</p> </blockquote> <p>Before Clegg speaks, we've also got a full programme of events this morning. Here's the full agenda.</p> <p><em>9am:</em> Debate on mental health</p> <p><em>9.45am:</em> Emergency debate on planning, on a motion saying the government should drop its plan to relax some planning laws for three years.</p> <p><em>10.35am:</em> Debate on housing.</p> <p><em>12.20pm:</em> Jo Swinson, the new consumer affairs minister, delivers a speech.</p> <p><em>2.30pm:</em> Nick Clegg's speech. As Patrick Wintour reports, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2012/sep/26/nick-clegg-lib-dem-conference-speech\">Clegg will send an austere message to his party on Wednesday, telling them the Liberal Democrats are willing to impose several more years of spending restraint, are now anchored in the centre ground and are determined never to revert to being a party of protest and opposition.</a></p> <p>At some point this morning I'm also going to write a post on 10 things we've learnt from the Lib Dem conference (once I've worked out what they are).</p> <p>If you want to follow me on Twitter, I'm on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AndrewSparrow\">@AndrewSparrow.</a></p> </div>   </div>",
  "<p>A relatively common misconception of local government is that the main thing we do is pick up the bins. This isn't surprising \u2013 it's an important service and the most visible we provide.</p> <p>Yet there are literally hundreds of other ways councils serve local communities, from the fun and entertaining such as libraries and leisure centres, to the essential services that most residents fortunately never encounter, such as safeguarding children. Some local authorities deliver more than 700 services to their communities.</p> <p>The hard-working council employees I encounter are generally content to go about their work in an unostentatious way. It isn't in the nature of public service to shout about what you do. But occasionally it pays to pipe up \u2013 and today, the #OurDay tweetathon offers an ideal opportunity.</p> <p>Over a 24-hour period we're asking local authorities, councillors and council workers to take a couple of minutes to give residents an insight into a day in the life of local government, describing what they are doing and why.</p> <p>The benefits of participating are twofold. Firstly, it gives councils the opportunity to show residents they offer a round the clock service to communities. From the pre-dawn street cleaning teams to environment officers handling late night calls from neighbours kept awake by noisy house parties, councils are working 24 hours a day. Using Twitter, it only takes a couple of minutes to let residents know how their money is being spent and alert them to the services that are available to them.</p> <p>Secondly, it helps to publicise councils' new communication channels. The growth in social media and the number of web-savvy residents using smartphones has gifted local authorities a cheap and easy way of talking with the people they serve. From updates on road closures and black ice warnings, to advising residents of the opportunities to respond to community consultations, online networks offer a great way to get information out quickly and directly. And it gives residents the opportunity to provide instant feedback.</p> <p>Traditional media outlets, including radio stations and local papers, remain an important way to share ideas, but remember that many of the 18-year-olds who voted in the most recent local elections have had access to the internet since they were eight years old. It is essential that our approach evolves with them and the older residents who have also embraced social media. Part of that means reaching out and explaining why they should follow and join our social media outlets.</p> <p>I'll be tweeting about my day today from <a href=\"https://twitter.com/dmontfort\" title=\"\">@dmontfort</a> and I hope you'll follow me and join in with #OurDay.

  "<p>What is the modern Conservative party? How coherent is its ideology? Is it united? Not in the sense of the day-to-day policy skirmishes around David Cameron, but rather at the party's deeper levels, the real potential source of prime ministerial instability.</p> <p>The central paradox facing the modern Tory party is obvious. On the one hand, Cameron carries it all pretty lightly; he enjoys, and is pretty good at, the job. He purports to lead a modern, liberal, cosmopolitan government \u2013 all mainstream politicians now tend to call themselves \"progressive\". He presides over a radical, reforming administration \u2013 think deficit reduction, health reform and the overhaul of welfare \u2013 and faces an opposition recovering from arguably its worst ever election defeat. Not a bad place to be. All other things being equal, the party should be united behind the leader.</p> <p>Yet the hallmark of the modern Tory party is fragility. It is a dangerously brittle thing. After 13 long years of opposition, and barely two years into government, it appears to be sinking, devoid of pragmatism. The recent reshuffle exposed its inner wiring \u2013 a medium-term modernisation strategy surrendered before the concerns of day-to-day party management. Cameron is captive and weak. Boris is mean and hungry. New right-wing factions are launched almost weekly. Hostility to the Liberal Democrats is simple transference; real venom is directed in private at the Tory leader. Is there any better example of a new government stalling so dramatically after initial suggestions of energy and vitality?</p> <p>The leadership response from Westminster is to paper over the cracks \u2013 to remind us these are the usual mid-term travails ramped up by sacked or passed-over MPs and the pathologically oppositional. Meanwhile, from the grassroots, the admirable <a href=\"http://conservativehome.blogs.com/platform/tim_montgomerie/\" title=\"\">Tim Montgomerie of the influential website Conservative Home</a> calls for renewed vigour on the part of Osborne, Hague and IDS in drilling into Ed Miliband's leadership, and a focus on immigration and welfare. Both sides look to the impressive 2010 intake to square the circle; to import grit, ideas and rigour into the Tories, and to deal with the pesky Lib Dems.</p> <p>All roads lead to <em>Britannia Unchained</em>, the short tract written by a group of young, right-wing Tory MPs that is considered a route map to political renewal. Forget the small beer, shallow-end stuff of the news cycle: real unity is to be secured through rallying to the ideas in this book, and its generation of Tory \"stars\" putting a spark into their party and securing outright victory in 2015. That is quite a task for the MP authors Kwasi Kwarteng, Priti Patel, Dominic Raab, Chris Skidmore and Elizabeth Truss, yet they appear up for it. The book received some unfavourable attention before it was published \u2013 newspapers picked up on the suggestion that the British people are \"among the worst idlers in the world\", too many of whom \"prefer a lie-in to hard work\". But first things first: there is still much here that we can agree on.</p> <p>The task at hand is to rebuild this country. We start with an extraordinary economic history, but one we cannot simply rest on. The reality is that Britain does, as these authors suggest, face a fundamental choice \u2013 whether to manage decline or confront today's global challenges. How can we do this and build a successful 2020 Britain? Many of the remedies put forward here are pretty self evident: good quality childcare, applauding hard work, high quality education and skill formation, embracing risk and innovation, regional balance, cutting unnecessary red tape. The comparisons the authors make are also of interest \u2013 praise is given not just to the usual Singapore and South Korea, but also to Brazil and even parts of Europe. The authors demonstrate their socially liberal credentials on race, sexuality, gender and identity, and they make other interesting arguments: for example, they question the cult of celebrity, and emphasise the importance of virtuous parenting and the nurturing of appropriate attitudes in our children.</p> <p>Yet at its core this book is not about social liberalism. Scratch off the veneer and all is revealed: a destructive economic liberalism that threatens the foundations of modern conservatism. The state is assumed always to be malign, and it's taken for granted that the labour market is not flexible enough (is it ever?). For reform read marketisation and intensified commodification. In this world, safety nets stifle a \"can-do\" culture, weakening our work ethic and muscular individuality. Banking crises are simply part of the natural order of things; Britons are working fewer hours because they can't be bothered or are wilfully avoiding work. The role of politics and public policy and the impact of structural problems in markets and institutions are absent from the analysis.</p> <p>For these authors \u2013 all members of the party's right-leaning Free Enterprise Group \u2013 it is a binary world, where everything is forward or back, progress or decline, sink or swim, good or bad. They do not appear to see the world as a complex place. The choice is between regulation and dynamism: their ideal worker is one prepared to work long hours, commute long distances and expect no employment protection and low pay. Their solution to the problem of childcare is unregulated, \"informal and cheap childminders\". We need dramatic cuts in public expenditure, they argue, to be matched by equivalent tax cuts. The demonisation of the welfare recipient continues apace; a broad dystopian worldview dominates the future. The bottom line for these Tory radicals is that the notion of community, society or indeed country is always trumped by textbook economic liberalism.</p> <p>A few years ago I asked a high-flying commentator about the notion of \"compassionate conservatism\". This young columnist is hardwired into the project set out in <em>Britannia Unchained</em> and gives his readers a weekly report from the frontline. His contempt for the compassionate version of Tory ideology was total. Why, I asked. Because \"we\" are \"liberals organising within the Conservative party,\" he replied. It is this economic liberalism that has sought, albeit in vain, to sell off our forests. It seeks a planning free-for-all; it celebrates chaos. It would dismantle valued national institutions \u2013 in broadcasting, policing, transport and health. Such libertarianism is unpatriotic \u2013 the nation's best interests wouldn't be pursued in industrial strategy, defence or indeed Britain's place within Europe. It threatens the \"national-popular\" foundations of the Thatcher revolution; it is a brutal and destructive creed at odds with national interest as she understood it.</p> <p>Put simply, Margaret Thatcher knew she had to meld together the economic liberalism of the new right and the traditional, patriotic sentiment of both her party and the country. This was never framed as \"either-or\". Her pragmatic brilliance built a coalition that contested the centre ground and bolted in parts of the working class.</p> <p>In contrast, although claiming to be the true descendants of Mrs T, the authors of <em>Britannia Unchained</em> represent a project that is extreme and destructive, and which threatens the essential character of our nation. It is because this faction is in the ascendancy that Cameron is actually failing; he remains captive to an economic reductionism that could well destroy conservatism \u2013 in the proper sense of valuing and conserving the nature and assorted institutions of the country.</p> <p>Cameron is not one of this crew. Tactically, in the short term he might survive; but in the medium term he is toast. The economic liberals' march through the Conservative party will continue; every day there is less and less opposition, and they will eventually win. The coalition with the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Orange_Book:_Reclaiming_Liberalism\" title=\"\">Orange Book Liberals</a> in Clegg's party might well stumble on. But the cost, over time, will be two lost traditions: a recognisable conservatism and a recognisable social liberalism.</p> <p>\u2022 Jon Cruddas MP is a member of the shadow cabinet and leads Labour's policy review.</p>",
  "<p>The first traces of plastic debris have been found in what was thought to be the pristine environment of the Southern Ocean, according to a study released in London by the French scientific research vessel Tara.</p> <p>The finding comes following a two-and-a-half-year, 70,000-mile voyage by the schooner across the Atlantic, Pacific, Antarctic and Indian Oceans, to investigate marine ecosystems and biodiversity under climate change.</p> <p>\"We had always assumed that this was a pristine environment, very little touched by human beings,\" said Chris Bowler, scientific co-ordinator of Tara Oceans. \"The fact that we found these plastics is a sign that the reach of human beings is truly planetary in scale.\"</p> <p>Samples taken from four different stations at locations in the Southern Ocean and Antarctica revealed traces of plastic at a measure of approximately 50,000 fragments per square kilometre \u2014 a rate comparable to the global average. While traces of plastic pollutants are customary in many of the world's oceans, with the highest levels found in the North Atlantic and North Sea, researchers had anticipated rates in the Southern Ocean to be some 10 times lower than the global average.</p> <p>\"Discovering plastic at these very high levels was completely unexpected because the Southern Ocean is relatively separated from the world's other oceans and does not normally mix with them,\" Bowler explained before unveiling Tara's findings at an event at the Science Museum in London on Wednesday. The microscopic fragments, invisible until accumulated in trawling nets, are the result of waste products such as plastic bags and bottles, degraded over years or decades by UV light and sea water. Tara researchers, whose work was recently hailed by UN secretary general Ban Ki-moon, were also surprised to find that synthetic fibres, largely constituted by clothing from washing-machine residue, made up a significant portion of the plastic fragments.</p> <p>Identifying the regional source of such general waste, which has made its way to the Southern Ocean over some half a century, remains more problematic. However, it is believed to originate from Africa, South America or Australia.</p> <p>The fatal impact of plastic pollutants on the marine environment has been widely observed, as birds and fish regularly consume waste products, which can be easily mistaken for jellyfish or other prey but cannot be degraded in the stomach. Plastics also slowly release toxins and other chemical substances that work their way up the marine food chain.</p> <p>\"It's too late to do much about what's already out there at this stage, as this stuff is going to hang around for thousands of years,\" said Bowler. However, he says the best way to mitigate future pollution is to advocate the use of biodegradable technologies while emphasising a shift in consumer practices.</p> <p>Tara will continue its marine research activities in 2013 with a groundbreaking mission to the Arctic circle to investigate the ocean environment following the melting of Arctic ice as a result of climate change.</p>",

That is bad, I have ended my career on your show tonight,\" the prime minister said, after struggling when Letterman fired a series of questions at him.</p> <p>Shifting slightly awkwardly in his seat, Cameron first ran into trouble when Letterman asked him who composed the music for Rule Britannia after the band struck up the music from the Last Night of the Proms. \"Elgar,\" he said uneasily. \"You are testing me,\" he added.</p> <p>Letterman waited until near the end of Cameron's appearance to point out that Thomas Arne composed the music, and that the poem was by James Thomson.</p> <p>Letterman picked on Rule Britannia to remind the prime minister that Britain once had an empire on which the sun never set. Cameron showed a better grasp of American history as he rattled through Anglo-American relations. \"We had a bit of a falling out, [though] I think we are getting over that,\" the Oxford PPE graduate said. \"We interfered in your politics 200 years ago when we sailed up the river and burnt the White House.\"</p> <p>Cameron asked to become the first sitting prime minister to appear on the Letterman show, recorded at the legendary Ed Sullivan Theatre on Broadway, to fly the flag for British business. He told Letterman he was \"shamelessly\" exploiting the afterglow of the Olympics and Paralympics.</p> <p>Cameron retrieved his honour when asked to explain the difference between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. He summed up the partition of Ireland in a few seconds and went on to praise the Queen's visit to Dublin last year. He made one minor slip when he said she was the first member of her family to visit since independence. The Prince of Wales has visited on numerous occasions.</p> <p>The interrogation turned to Magna Carta. \"1215,\" he shot back when asked the date it was signed. It took him a few minutes to give the venue \u2013 Runnymede \u2013 before delivering a first class essay about its significance in checking the powers of the English crown.</p> <p>But he did not know the English for Magna Carta. Cameron's university chum, Boris Johnson, the mayor of London, who has appeared on the show, will no doubt be chuckling. Letterman eventually ended Cameron's agony, explaining it meant Great Charter.</p> <p>Letterman's producers gave the show a southern English middle class theme, providing the US audience with a guide to the British class system. The other guest was the British actor Jonny Lee Miller, who made his name in Trainspotting. Miller, the former husband of Angelina Jolie, is from Kingston, Surrey, and was educated at Tiffin, a local grammar school.</p> <p>Mumford &amp; Sons, the folk rock band from Wimbledon, offered a song from their new album Babel. Marcus Mumford, the lead singer, was educated at King's College School. As an Etonian, Cameron represented a higher step on the ladder of the English private school system.</p> <p>Cameron, who ran rings round Jeremy Paxman during the 2005 Tory leadership contest, took care to prepare for his encounter with Letterman. One joke doing the rounds was that Sir Kim Darroch, Britain's national security adviser who has a quick and dry humour, would stand in for Letterman in rehearsals.</p> <p>In the end the Cameron prep team, led by his communications director and former television news editor Craig Oliver, fired a series of questions at him. Top of the list were queries about the Queen after the Letterman team told No 10 they were fascinated by the British monarch after her walk-on part in the James Bond section of the Olympics opening ceremony.</p> <p>The Cameron team studied with care Johnson's appearance on the Letterman show in June, when the mayor was asked how long he has been cutting his hair. \"That's a low blow,\" New York-born Johnson replied with a smile.</p> <p>Barack Obama was given a reasonably easy ride on the show this month when he appeared after the leaked video in which the Republican presidential challenger, Mitt Romney, appeared to write off 47% of the US electorate. The prime minister watched a recording of Obama's appearance as part of his preparation.</p> <p>One senior British source said: \"It is just a good opportunity. Britain has had an extraordinary year with the Jubilee, with the Olympics and with the Paralympics. We have got something good to shout about. So getting out there talking up Britain is important.</p> <p>\"We should never forget that we are the biggest investor in America, America is the biggest investor in us. There is a saying in business that when you want to do better you go back to your biggest customers and try and squeeze out a bit more.\"</p> <p>Cameron sought to show a modern Britain. Letterman did his best to counter that in laying the ground for Cameron's appearance by releasing dry ice to depict \"London fog\".</p>"
