Hassan saw severed heads and limbs lying in pools of sticky blood following the shelling of a funeral. Mohammed's skin and hair caught fire when a nearby car exploded. Kareem's next-door neighbour was killed by a shell as she nursed her baby. Moussa was kept in a prison cell alongside decomposing bodies. Eleven-year-old Mohamed writes poems about death and freedom.</p> <p>In the bleak, windswept landscape of the rapidly swelling Za'atari camp and the overcrowded towns and villages of northern Jordan, child refugees from Syria are struggling to cope with the weight of their experiences during 18 months of bloodshed.</p> <p>Some are haunted by the deaths of relatives, friends and neighbours. Some hear the sound of shelling and shooting constantly replaying in their heads. Many have seen their homes and communities turned to rubble. A few have been abused or tortured in detention. Some exhibit the physical scars of conflict. Almost all bear the psychological scars.</p> <p>Children have flooded across the border from Syria in recent weeks, most in family groups but an increasing number making the difficult and dangerous journey without a parent or close relative. At Za'atari, where dust-caked tents stretch in long rows across a vast desert plain, children are up to two-thirds of the current population of 31,000 refugees.</p> <p>\"They are paying the highest price. We have seen a lot of psycho-social distress, behavioural problems,\" says Nadine Haddad of <a href=\"http://www.savethechildren.org.uk/syria\" title=\"\">Save the Children</a>, which is launching a campaign to draw attention to the plight of children caught up in the conflict. Adolescent boys tend towards aggression and even vandalism; younger children suffer nightmares and bed-wetting.</p> <p>According to Michele Servadei of Unicef, the number of unaccompanied children arriving at Za'atari has increased to more than 20 a week. Some are completely alone; some have been sent by their parents to travel with neighbours or extended family members. \"Most are boys between 14 and 18, but we are also now getting some girls \u2013 a symptom that things are getting worse, more families are being disrupted.\"</p>      <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-396604258\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2012/9/24/1348494714777/Nur-nine-lives-in-a-refug-001.jpg\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/brightcove/2012/9/24/120924Nursavechildren-16x9.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2012/9/24/120924Nursavechildren_3gpLg16x9.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/ad/120924Nursavechildren/120924Nursavechildren.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2012/9/24/120924Nursavechildren_3gpSml16x9.3gp\"/> </video>   <p>These children are part of a bigger picture. The UN says a total of more than 280,000 Syrian citizen have registered as refugees or are awaiting registration after fleeing to Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan and Iraq. But there are tens, maybe hundreds, of thousands more outside the camps and formal process of registration. Aid agencies, host countries and small communities are struggling to cope with the influx.</p> <p>Ohood, a 14-year-old from east Deraa, made the journey to Jordan a month ago with her parents and seven of her siblings. The Free Syrian Army escorted the group to a point close to the Syrian border. \"We had to walk in the dark for three hours, very slowly and quietly,\" she says while washing clothes in a bucket by a standpipe. \"It was hard for the little children.\" They arrived in Jordan at 2am.</p> <p>Her family left after repeated shelling of their neighbourhood. \"One day we were at school, about 50 children in an Arabic lesson, sitting at our desks. There were clashes with the FSA, and they got mad and started shooting.\" Asked who \"they\" were, she says: \"[President] Bashar's security.</p> <p>\"It was very frightening. All the children started running away, trying to escape. The shooting lasted about an hour.\" A few days later the family fled to Jordan.</p> <p>Kareem, a 14-year-old with a cherubic face, mimics the sound of shells and gunfire while describing attacks on his and his neighbours' homes. \"I could hear the rockets passing our house. Next door to us a woman was hit by shrapnel in her chest while nursing her baby. Three children also died. We stayed in the bedroom of our house, about 30 or more of us. The bombing went on all night.\"</p> <p>He pulls up the leg of his jeans to show burn scars on his leg. \"There were fires in the street, they were burning petroleum. I was running because I thought a tank was coming. I fell into a fire.\" Kareem was taken to a field hospital for basic treatment, but a year on his leg still causes pain. Despite his ready smile, he anxiously pulls at his lower lip while describing what happened.</p> <p>Making constant gunfire noises, Kareem follows us through the rows of flapping tents to find Mohamed. An engaging 11-year-old writer of poetry, he arrived at Za'atari camp around a month ago, shortly before his mother gave birth to Mohamed's new brother. The baby, he says, is \"skinny and doesn't nurse. We're all sick from the dust, we can't breathe normally.\"</p> <p>Shortly before they left their home in Deraa province, a bullet whizzed in through a window and smashed through a cake his mother had made to break the Ramadan fast. Mohamed and his siblings usually hid in a cupboard when the shooting started.</p> <p>One of Mohamed's poems is a tribute to a man called Nathem, \"the first person to die in our town. He was on a protest, throwing rocks, and the soldiers started shooting.\" Another poem is, he says, about freedom. He recites the opening lines: \"Homs is on fire, and all of Syria went to its aid.\"</p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/video/2012/sep/25/syrian-refugee-omar-video\">Omar's story: 'I was sleeping when the shell fell' \u2013 video</a><br>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/video/2012/sep/25/syrian-child-refugee-bisan-video\">Bisan's story: 'It was a massacre' \u2013 video</a><br>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/video/2012/sep/25/syrian-child-refugee-emmad-video\">Emmad's story: 'The mountain route was risky' \u2013 video</a></p> <p>It is hard to keep track of children in Za'atari despite the best efforts of aid agencies. Plans to use colour-coding and symbols to identify different parts of the camps have yet to be implemented; and in any case the relentless sand and dust swiftly turn everything a uniform brown. Younger children frequently get lost; older ones sometimes sneak out past the camp's fences and armed guards, or simply disappear within the massive compound. We spend an hour fruitlessly searching for Moussa, a 15-year-old who lives alone in the camp, one of more than 200 unaccompanied minors registered since Za'atari opened on 29 July. His mother and two brothers are also in Jordan but, as Syrians, they are not permitted to pay \"bail\" money to get Moussa out of the camp so he can join them. Moussa told Save the Children that he had fought with the FSA, and was imprisoned for 22 days after being captured by the Syrian military. \"I was tortured and I saw children dying. I've got scars on my feet, chest and back. There were hundreds of us in prison. I was in a big cell with other children. The youngest ones were nine or 10, they had been captured during protests. I was beaten up every day, and they used electricity too.\"</p> <p>His interrogators wanted information about the FSA, he said. \"But I never told them.\"</p> <p>He said there were dead bodies in his cell. \"They'd been there a long time, and they stank. They were decomposing, there were maggots.\"</p> <p>A young man in the tent in which Moussa had been sleeping tells us the boy has gone to the \"new camp\", a vast area of expansion where tents are being erected in anticipation of thousands of arrivals over the coming weeks. Delivery trucks and bulldozers constantly churn up the sand into choking clouds, which are then fanned by the relentless wind.</p> <p>The tents are mostly bare, with foam mattresses laid on groundsheets. Most families left their homes with minimal possessions; many of the children have only the clothes they are wearing. The temperature is already dropping after dark; soon it will be bitterly cold at night.</p> <p>Aid workers say the camp inmates feel humiliated by their new living conditions. \"Their passports are confiscated, they are forced to eat whatever they're given, they wash their clothes in a bucket, they have nothing to do all day. There is a lack of dignity. It's like being in prison,\" said one. Some refugees are even asking to return to Syria.</p> <p>Save the Children, Unicef and other agencies have established \"child friendly spaces\" where children can play and take part in therapeutic activities, such as drawing and painting. \"They express their feelings and what they've seen in different ways,\" says Haddad of Save the Children. \"Some draw happy families. Some draw Syria. Some focus on horrific things. Each child has his or her way.\"</p> <p>Jordan's burgeoning refugee crisis does not end at the camp's perimeter fence. In addition to the 31,000 people in Za'atari camp, there are an estimated 140,000 Syrian refugees living in towns and villages in northern Jordan. Many extended families stretch across both sides of the border, and some refugees are crowding in with relatives. Others are renting apartments in cities such as Ramthe, Mafraq and Irbid.</p>      <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-396612409\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2012/9/24/1348503016854/Hassan-is-14-years-old-an-015.jpg\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/brightcove/2012/9/24/120924Hassanchildren-16x9.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2012/9/24/120924Hassanchildren_3gpLg16x9.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/ad/120924Hassanchildren/120924Hassanchildren.m3u8\"/> </video>   <p>Hassan, a 14-year-old from Zaynab, near Damascus, and a further eight members of his family have squashed into a relative's house in Mafraq a few weeks after fleeing Syria in the aftermath of what he describes as \"a massacre in our town\".</p> <p>According to his account, Syrian helicopters fired rockets at a night-time funeral for an FSA fighter. \"There were about 5,000 people. I was at the edge of the funeral.\" The mourners were making a lot of noise, he says, but when the rockets hit, \"there was no sound\".</p> <p>\"There were bodies, and pieces of bodies, everywhere. Everyone was looking for relatives. Everyone was scared because there were helicopters still in the sky. I saw heads 20 metres away from the blast. I saw arms and legs that had been cut from bodies. There was lots of blood everywhere. Before I go to sleep at night, I always remember what happened that day.\"</p> <p>Hassan's uncle and cousin were among the dead. \"We found their bodies in the mosque.\" He adds: \"Everybody from young to old hates Bashar.\"</p> <p>He has not been able to start school in Jordan, although he is trying to register. Local schools are struggling with the refugee influx, and aid agencies are trying to help with prefabricated classrooms and textbooks. They are also encouraging teachers among the refugee population to volunteer to work. In Za'atari camp alone, there are up to 10,000 school-age children \u2013 the equivalent of 10 average-sized secondary schools in the UK.</p> <p>\"Many children have lost months or even years of schooling,\" says Servadei of Unicef. School is not only essential from an educational point of view but also to provide children with a sense of routine and occupation. Boredom is one of the biggest problems for refugee children.</p> <p>Seventeen-year-old Mohammed, now living with a relative in Irbid, would also like to restart his education. \"I want to register but they have told me the schools are full. It's boring. I just go for walks around the town.\"</p> <p>Before leaving Syria, Mohammed was involved in the FSA. \"We used to help them, but I was not fighting myself. We would scout roads and refill ammo. There were younger children than me going out with the FSA, as young as 10.\"</p> <p>Youngsters, he says, were involved in the uprising from the beginning. A protest in his home town of Deraa, initiated by schoolchildren, led to the arrest of about 50. \"They were taken to jail. They had their fingernails pulled out, they were beaten with sticks. Some lost their minds.\" Some of the children were as young as six, he says.</p> <p>\"A lot of children have been killed. My friends, my cousins.\"</p> <p>Mohammed intends to go back to Syria to join the fight, but first needs treatment for burns on his face and body, which have left him extensive scarring and pain. \"I was standing next to a car, which was hit. There was a big fire. I was burned all over. It was like a dream. Then I passed out.\"</p> <p>He crossed to Jordan alone around six weeks ago, going first to Za'atari camp and now staying with a relative in Irbid. His family is still in Deraa. \"I miss them. I can't stay here while my family might be killed. I want to go back. I'm no longer afraid of anything.\"</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.savethechildren.org.uk/syriagive\" title=\"\"><em>Save the Children in Syria</em></a></p>",

  "<p>The brief statement released by Roy Hodgson made a point of stressing John Terry's decision to retire from the England set-up had been accepted only \"reluctantly\". The phone call had been fielded on Sunday afternoon while the national manager prepared to watch Rio Ferdinand and Manchester United win at Anfield, the angst kicking in as soon as the line went dead. \"I am, of course, disappointed to lose a player of John's international experience and exceptional ability,\" said Hodgson after digesting the news. Even that felt like an understatement.</p> <p>Terry's ability to flirt with controversy was supposed to have rendered him a toxic presence when it came to the national side and yet successive England managers have staked their reputations on the centre-half, prepared to accept all the accompanying baggage and merely rely on his strong-arm ability and unswerving self-belief.</p> <p>For Fabio Capello and Hodgson to have done so revealed the respect within the game for the defender's powers even if Terry is now 31 and, inevitably, slower than he was. Injuries have taken their toll in recent seasons and his game feels as if it is played from deeper these days, the back and knee twinges or nerve pain that has regularly rippled down his right leg in recent years fuelling a wariness that he can be outpaced at times.</p> <p>But he was still someone on whom the national team had relied in Ukraine over the summer and was clearly to be a key component of Hodgson's first qualification campaign. This was a defender who had featured in every minute of England's involvement in the past three major tournaments \u2013 albeit in a team prone to under-achieve who have never ventured beyond a quarter-final \u2013 and, whether it was a progressive enough policy or not, the management were still counting on him to help this team reach Brazil. In their eyes Terry was the best central defender available. Now, after 78 caps, he is out of the running.</p> <p>Hodgson has until the end of next week to draw up a squad to sweep aside San Marino and, more significantly, blunt the Poles in Warsaw with central defence now an area to be addressed. There is a short-term solution staring the manager in the face: Ferdinand was outstanding against Liverpool with a performance worthy of a player capped 81 times, if not at all since the summer of 2011. He would fill the void with his experience and classy ability to summon a tackle, pick a pass or read the game, a former captain who could inspire and reassure. Yet the recall that seems so obvious may end up ignored. That call might prove too hard even for a manager of Hodgson's years to make.</p> <p>Ferdinand has become embroiled in the saga that has taken down first Capello and now Terry. That was inevitable given it was his brother, Anton, who was the subject of the alleged \"abusive and/or insulting words and/or behaviour\" currently being scrutinised by the Football Asociation's independent commission, and the subject of the alleged racially aggravated language in the case dismissed at Westminster magistrates' court in July. Rio was ignored for Euro 2012 for \"footballing reasons\", though that always felt too convenient. Those same reasons may not now apply. Yet more intriguing would be whether Ferdinand could be reintegrated into the national set-up: he is expected to follow his brother's lead and refuse the hand offered by Terry and Ashley Cole when United play Chelsea next month, his retweet of a message that suggested the full-back was a \"choc-ice\" after he gave evidence on Terry's behalf at the trial having already prompted an FA sanction.</p> <p>Would his inclusion not prolong this unsettling story, further testing unity in the dressing room? Furthermore, while Hodgson may be a pragmatist at heart, would the inclusion of a player who turns 34 in November after an absence of 16 months not feel too regressive? For the sake of eking some kind of positive from a messy and divisive situation, Terry's decision may have to become a watershed: the time this team moved on.</p> <p>On the face of it England are well stocked with centre-backs. Joleon Lescott was an unsung success at Euro 2012, a player who was drafted in late once Gary Cahill had been ruled out with a cracked jaw but is a Premier League winner who partnered Terry effectively and impressively through the side's four-game involvement at the finals. Cahill himself has Terry's stature and style to his game, if not his club-mate's experience even if he is a European Cup winner where his captain, despite the medal, is not.</p> <p>Phil Jagielka, too, has impressed when offered an opportunity over his 14 caps, his own pairing with Lescott having been forged at Everton and adopted by Capello as a regular Plan B. The pair successfully shut out Spain in a friendly in November 2011 and England have won all but one of the four games in which they have started alongside each other. The success against Switzerland in Basel in qualification for Euro 2012 was arguably the team's most impressive of that group away from Wembley. Jagielka's Everton assistant manager, Steve Round, said Terry's departure presented \"a terrific opportunity\". He must consider it precisely that.</p> <p>That Terry has missed 10 of his country's 24 games since returning from the World Cup in South Africa would suggest life without the Chelsea stalwart should hardly be considered a step into the unknown. There have been five different combinations lacking Terry who have started matches in the last two years and, away from those relatively established names, Hodgson could point to a posse of youngsters eager to make their mark. Phil Jones, Chris Smalling and Steven Caulker would hope to make an impression when fit and in form. The first two would surely have featured against Italy in Berne in August had their respective knee and metatarsal problems not ruled them out.</p> <p>The onus is firmly on them to prove Terry's loss is not as significant as it instinctively feels. England appeared shaky at Wembley against Ukraine earlier this month after the former captain turned his ankle in Moldova. Perhaps Jagielka and Lescott had simply lacked the proper preparation time ahead of that awkward fixture or maybe it was early-season rustiness but this was a glimpse of an England stripped of their most experienced centre-back and Cole, with their combined 176 caps.</p> <p>It must prove fleeting vulnerability even if nagging away at Hodgson, too, will be the reality that only Jagielka and Lescott can hope to be playing regularly for their club teams in the campaign ahead, with Terry's retirement \u2013 freeing up international windows for breathers \u2013 potentially impacting on Cahill's involvement on a weekly basis at Chelsea. That is something Hodgson may have to live with as he looks forward to Brazil. The younger pretenders may have their chance. Ferdinand might not be an option in Rio.</p>",

Coming to study at a UK university has become increasingly difficult, as would-be students get entangled in <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/higher-education-network/blog/2012/aug/30/london-met-paralympics-opening-ceremony\" title=\"\">more complex and expensive visa requirements</a>, face negative sentiment towards them in the British media, and experience increasingly stringent restrictions on their movements once they have arrived.</p> <p>In fact, the current coalition government has gone so far as to actively <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2012/may/14/ministers-immigration-numbers-game-students\" title=\"\">target foreign students by labelling them 'migrants'</a> and directly targeting them in support of its efforts to reduce net migration to the tens of thousands.</p> <p>I've argued before (alongside many in the higher education sector) that international students should be classified as education tourists, not migrants. Prominent think tank <a href=\"http://www.migrationobservatory.ox.ac.uk/\" title=\"\">the Migration Observatory</a> has confirmed that only 6% of international students remain in the UK as students after five years \u2013 a period of time which may be dedicated to A-Levels and then a three year degree (without further post-graduate study). Lumping international education in with general immigration policy is a dangerous game to play.</p> <p>So <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2207649/Exposed-myth-bright-foreign-students-Just-cent-attend-university-rated-ten.html?ito=feeds-newsxml\" title=\"\">the claim being made today by Migration Watch</a> that non-EU students are being recruited to prop up the finances of less-well known universities is the latest attack in the unjustified war on foreign students. Not only are Migration Watch's arguments potentially damaging to the UK higher education sector, they are also misleading and inaccurate.</p> <p>Migration Watch, an organisation which monitors migration flows to and from the UK, claims that its finding that just 5% of the international students who enter Britain each year go to a top 10 university, and one in eight to a Russell Group university, is evidence that Britain is not attracting the brightest and the best of the international community.</p> <p>This data is questionable for a number of reasons. Firstly, the figures presented by Migration Watch are distorted by the fact that a significant number of international students do not go straight to university. Many come to feeder institutions where they take foundation programmes or complete their A-levels before progressing to higher education, often in top tier universities. If these students were removed from the calculation, and we looked only at the percentage of foreign students actually attending university in the UK, the proportion that go to top 10 or Russell Group institutions would be significantly higher.</p> <p>Secondly, the report fails to acknowledge that the best students do not necessarily go to the best universities. Many choose universities that might not be highly ranked but that have excellent specialist departments with notable alumni successes. Prominent examples include the <a href=\"http://www.ucreative.ac.uk/\" title=\"\">University of the Creative Arts</a> or <a href=\"http://www.lincoln.ac.uk/home/\" title=\"\">the University of Lincoln</a>, which has an excellent media department.</p> <p>The figures presented by Migration Watch will be further skewed by the fact that while business is the most popular subject choice for overseas students, many of the best business schools in the country are relatively new, and are not at top ranked universities. So we have excellent foreign students attending excellent business schools (such as <a href=\"http://www1.uwe.ac.uk/bl/bbs.aspx\" title=\"\">Bristol Business School</a>, part of the <a href=\"http://www1.uwe.ac.uk/bl/bbs.aspx\" title=\"\">University of the West of England</a>) who are branded as \"not the brightest and the best\" by Migration Watch.</p> <p>UK universities rely on international students for their intellectual, cultural and financial contribution. Universities such as London School of Economics, (with a 42% foreign student population) or Imperial College London (36%) have diversity ingrained in their culture and seek out the brightest minds from overseas to add to the prestige of their undergraduate courses and postgraduate research programmes. Without international students, these institutions would be financially and culturally worse off.</p> <p>The vast majority of international students do little more than arrive, learn and then leave. In the process they contribute significantly to the UK's higher education sector and the general economy \u2013 creating jobs in academia and the local community as well becoming the source of the UK's 'soft power' on their return home. Yet our government, and organisations like Migration Watch, seem intent on driving them away.</p> <p>We still have the opportunity to promote our 'gold-standard' universities and fill them with future leaders of industry from emerging economies all around the world. But let's not jeopardise our privilege to educate with a politically motivated debate on immigration which has nothing to do with these genuine and valuable education tourists.</p> <p><em>James Pitman is managing director of </em><a href=\"http://www.studygroup.com/\" title=\"\"><em>Study Group</em></a><em>, a specialist provider of educational programmes and placements for international students.

  "<p>Tradition, Mahler once famously said, is \"Schlamperei\" - which means something akin to sloppiness. Mahler meant it in terms of performance practice, but it's an axiom many contemporary composers have followed to the letter, throwing out any \"sloppy\" vestiges of previous traditions, the tainted sentimentality of romanticism, the overblown rhetoric of expressionism, or any of the too easily imitated \"isms\" that have been part of the story of 20th and 21st-century music. If that's a rough axiom for many of the greats of contemporary music, if you're a German composer, it pretty well became an ideology after the second world war.</p> <p>All of which makes this week's composer one of the most radical figures writing today, precisely because of his superficial conservatism. To those who know his music, he's someone whose unstoppable musical creativity, whose tumult of pieces for orchestras, opera houses, string quartets, for the familiar forms of musical institutions, and for famous soloists such as Anne-Sophie Mutter, makes him one of the most approachable, engaging and profound composers writing music today. I give you <a href=\"http://www.universaledition.com/Wolfgang-Rihm/composers-and-works/composer/599/biography\" title=\"\">Wolfgang Rihm</a>, arguably contemporary music's most prolific composer, with more than 400 works \u2013 and counting \u2013 to his name.</p> <p>Born in Karlsruhe in 1952, when the generation of Stockhausen, Boulez and Nono were in their first, iconoclastic phase of maturity, Rihm had already written a symphony as a teenager (it's astonishingly good, too, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2009/jan/16/rihm-symphonies-nos-1-2\" title=\"\">a compelling essay in a wildly expressive atonal language that teems with ideas, energy, and meaning</a>). As a young composer, he challenged the masters of ideological purity with a language that wasn't afraid to reference, to transmute and to deal with the music of the past, composing pieces that had the temerity to take on the legacy of Austro-German music rather than rejecting the achievements or the aesthetic of Berg and Schoenberg, or Schumann, Schubert or Beethoven.</p> <p>This was a crazy way of doing things for any self-respecting avant garde composer in the 1970s, and Rihm unwittingly found himself part of a movement misleadingly called (aren't they all?) the \"<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Simplicity\" title=\"\">New Simplicity</a>\". But before this becomes too much of a German-new-music version of the <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb_qHP7VaZE\" title=\"\">Judean People's Front v the People's Front of Judea</a>, the point is that Rihm's gigantic musical output \u2013 one of the greatest and grandest in terms of sheer quantity of hours of music composed, of consistent quality, of massive emotional range, of variety of forces and scales \u2013 resists any attempt to reduce its reach to a few handy labels.</p> <p>If you listen to his <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qu-lado4QRg\" title=\"\">Lichtes Spiel</a> for violin soloist and strings, you might think that Rihm specialises in modern-sounding nostalgia; if you hear one of his Fetzen for string quartet and accordion, you'll have him down as a splintery modernist, all sharp elbows and crystalline energy; if you go for one of his operas such as the recent <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFMz2Flahgk\" title=\"\">Dionysos</a>, you might hear him as the heir to Berg's operatic canon; or if you hear his cello concerto, <a href=\"http://www.universaledition.com/Wolfgang-Rihm/composers-and-works/composer/599/work/12663\" title=\"\">the Konzert in Einem Satz</a>, you could describe him as a lyrical atonalist, picking up where Schoenberg and Karl Amadeus Hartmann left off. Listen to one of his <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LfCh9-qPtcA\" title=\"\">Klavierst\u00fccke</a>, though, and you're hearing music of blistering, unpredictable intensity.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2010/mar/04/wolfgang-rihm-interview\" title=\"\">When I met Rihm a few years ago</a>, he shamed me by giving me 30 CDs of his music, none of which I had heard, and yet I had thought I had got to grips with at least some of his music before I saw him.</p> <p>The first thing you need to do with Rihm is give up on any idea of coming to terms with the whole, generously proportioned effulgence of his life's work, and remember that the longest journey starts with a single step, or in this case, a single work. Begin with this one, and promise me you'll stay with it until the end: <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KML7ZFLAtVI\" title=\"\">Jagden und Formen</a>, a 50-minute, single-movement musical thrill-ride for large ensemble that embodies some of the signature qualities of Rihm's music: its addictive energy, its torrent of ideas, its massively ambitious scale, as well as its uncanny sense of drama and pacing. The title means \"hunts and forms\"; I prefer thinking of it as \"hunting and forming\", because the music is in a constant state of volatility, of change. A spirit of restless dynamism animates every bar of this music. And that's why it's important you stay with it until the end (although YouTube hasn't got an upload of the complete piece; you need Spotify for that) because when you get there, you'll experience one of the most life-enhancing jolts of musical energy in post-war music. Whatever else post-tonal music was supposed to do, it was supposed to sound like this.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396607209\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/arts/2012/9/24/1348482733253/Jakob-Lenz-by-Wolfgang-Ri-008.jpg\" alt=\"Jakob Lenz by Wolfgang Rihm, ENO 2012\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Andrew Shore as Jakob Lenz in English National Opera's recent  production of Rihm's opera.

We are going to put this record on to the turntable, kick off our shoes and dance our lives away as if that particular year and the decade from which it comes will most surely live on forever because in this music, or perhaps more significantly deep in the mind of Jack Tatum whose vehicle is Wild Nothing, they undoubtedly do. A period in musical history which with a few notable exceptions, many of us are still trying to forget is clearly theirs to celebrate. For this their second album Tatum steps out of his low-fi Virginian bedroom and to the synth, echo and reverbed drum blueprint of their 2010 debut Gemini he welds a much bigger production sound and to those contagious pop melodies he now drenches them in layers of shimmering guitars, quietly understated strings and his illusory, breathy vocals.</p> <p>So far so very good but on closer inspection, and despite a title which may suggest otherwise, it quickly becomes the light to the shade of one of 1989's truly epic albums, Disintegration by the Cure \u2013 in many respects it is Dr Jekyll to that record's Mr Hyde. Both utilise cascading synthesiser and fluid, molten guitar lines to great effect and both convey romanticism in their lyrical message (Wild Nothing's The Blue Dress is most surely the Cure's Lovesong by any other name) but it is the differences lying therein that highlight the eventual shortcomings of Nocturne. While Robert Smith's vision was on an equally grand scale he recognised the need to shroud his love songs in a much darker, occasionally even more sinister hue. His acute sense of gothic melodrama is what truly made that record and it is ultimately the absence of any darkness whatsoever which is Nocturne's undoing. It is often too far simple in its texture, overly breezy in its execution and it is this lightness of touch that eventually removes it from the memory bank of music that is built to last.</p> <p>It is probably grossly unfair to draw comparisons with Disintegration; that was after all the Cure's eighth studio album and Smith was some seven years Tatum's senior at the point of its release. And it is a truly classic record both in the era it was made and the here and now. That is not to say that Nocturne is a bad record, far from it. But for Tatum to continue to borrow his ideas and inspiration from the 80s and for his own voice to be properly heard in the modern age he will need to significantly develop his grand design into something much more than this.</p> <p>- simongodley</p> <h2>Turn on the Bright Lights by Interpol</h2> <p>The early signs were not good. It's hard to believe it now but 10 years ago almost every trendy new rock band under the sun was trying to recapture the gloomy, romantic sound of Joy Division. When the hype began to swell about the debut by a maverick bunch of New Yorkers with a too cool for school icy existentialism who dressed in sharp black suits, it was hard to feel excited.</p> <p>But five seconds into first hearing Obstacle No 1 you realise that there is something different about Interpol. Suddenly those snazzy suits and Armani model haircuts did not seem quite so ludicrous. \"I wish I could taste the salt off your last faded lips,\" sings Paul Banks over a relentlessly propulsive and visceral lead guitar. The bass lines of Carlos Dengler is as smooth and glacial-sounding as ice but the serrated riff is jagged and staggering. The song's emotional bursts gives its thematic content a harsh emotional depth as it builds to the chorus and Banks singing \"You'll go stabbing yourself in the neck.\" It's profoundly disturbing. It's grandiosely beautiful. It's morbidly bleak. This is the moment Interpol arrived as the most exciting rock band in the world and sadly the band would never again reach such lofty heights.</p> <p>On the album's opener, Untitled, Daniel Kessler's sublime, angular downstrokes announce the band with breathktaking simplicity, followed by the swaggering confidence of Carlos Dengler's baselines and eventually the song's one lyric: \"I will surprise you sometimes/ I'll come around/ When you're down.\" Nobody could ever accuse this band of lacking self-belief. It is a powerful, enigmatic and strangely ominous way to kick things off and it succeeds in setting the emotionally wrecked but ultimately beautiful scene with surprising economy.</p> <p>Time and time again on this album the tension between darkness and light overspills to confront you with cut after cut of painful self-revelation. PDA is all jangling guitars, tightly wound choruses and seamless rhythm section. Well almost. Banks sets the scene for what is coming with the lyric: \"You cannot safely say while I will be away/That you cannot consider sadly how you helped me to stray.\" And then suddenly, seemingly out of nowhere, the song deconstructs completely as its lead riff turns inwards on itself and the song becomes something else entirely. \"Something to say/ Something to do/ Nothing to say/ When there's nothing to do,\" sings Banks as in one single swoop, the band muster Nietzsche's alchemical trick of turning the muck of failed romantic love into the gold of realising that life is little more than coming to terms with loss and longing.</p> <p>Immediatey comes Say Hello to the Angels, a song that I discarded upon first falling for this record but now see as the peak of this albums many high points. The song has an expansive structure commencing with a punky Fugazi-esque attack. It stands out on a uniformly gloomy-sounding album for being more upbeat and on first listen it even becomes clear that Banks is singing about oral sex. But in the end Interpol can only ever be Interpol. After the second chorus, in a moment of devastating emotional sincerity the song comes majestically crashing down in trademark Interpol fashion. \"This is a concept/ This is a bracelet/ This isn't no intervention.\" What does Banks really mean when he sings this? Who knows? But it feels like the end of the world as you know it.</p> <p>In 2002, albeit briefly, Interpol felt like the defining band of their era. In the end, whatever the critics have to say about the band's declining creativity, their legacy as the dark lords of noughties rock will remain undiminished.</p> <p>\u2013 ElliotBorges</p>",
  "<p>Two songs down and there's a fight on \u2013 a small whirlpool of boys in the crowd headbutting each other's sternums. As they fall into step during the rather valiant, heather-scented chorus of The Captain, it becomes clear they're trying to dance. It's all a little rough for the iTunes festival, a brilliantly produced but rather sterile do, at which crowdsurfing is limited to six seconds a punt. You feel as if you're in a TV studio (which you essentially are) and the balloted ticketing system stops many diehard fans getting in. Nevertheless, it's also an appropriate place to see a band who have hauled sweaty, tattooed rock into arenas and up to the top of the charts.</p> <p>In 2010, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/biffy-clyro\" title=\"\">Biffy Clyro</a> were forever tied to The X Factor when their song <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAh--lH0H3U\" title=\"\">Many of Horror</a> was chosen as winner <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eOBityJj4kI\" title=\"\">Matt Cardle's debut single</a>. They'd had 12 years in relative obscurity before their breakthrough album Puzzles in 2007, and their proggy past is detectable only in traces now, such as the preposterously great drum intro to <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6KEHF1z40I\" title=\"\">Living Is a Problem Because Everything Dies</a>, illustrated tonight with plumes of steam. Stingin' Belle, the first single from next year's new album, is the kind of triumphant Caledonian rock that works best for them, with gunfire drums, buttock-shaking bass and \"bagpipe\" impressions on a guitar. The innocuous Bubbles is much tougher on stage than on tape, accompanied with stretchy orbs that burst into clouds of dry ice.</p> <p>It's a streamlined, efficient and chat-free set, and pretty hard to get a sense of character. While their more jerky indie stuff (<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8kuWH7sjFo\" title=\"\">Who's Got a Match?</a>, or the new song The Joke's on Us) sounds tight as a fist, it has always seemed odd coming from half-naked men with legs splayed in the attitude of Slash. The crowd vote with their feet in favour of the rock songs: the Foo Fighterish anthem <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDmeMjsV35U\" title=\"\">That Golden Rule</a> gets the boys channelling their excitement in a frantic conga line.</p>",
  "<p>Apple's new maps offering has drawn huge amounts of ire from users used to having Google Maps on their device. But it's far from the company's first brush with a PR embarrassment. What's surprising is how many of them it has managed to ride over and turn into success. Will maps be the same \u2013 or cause lasting damage? </p> <h2>Apple Maps - September 2012</h2> <p>The introduction by Apple of its own mapping service in iOS6, the operating software rolled out to iPhones and iPads on Wednesday 19 September, has been one of its worst PR disasters. Although the update has brought voice-driven turn-by-turn navigation, users have complained that the new maps, which replace Google's \u2013 in use on the iPhone since 2007 \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2012/sep/20/apple-maps-ios6-station-tower\">lack accuracy, clarity and detail</a>. In response, Apple said that \"We launched this new map service knowing it is a major initiative and that we are just getting started with it. Maps is a cloud-based solution and the more people use it, the better it will get. We appreciate all of the customer feedback and are working hard to make the customer experience even better.\"</p> <p>In other words, it knows that people aren't liking it. But it hasn't got a quick fix \u2013 and for people missing public transport information since the loss of Google, the only options are to use Google's maps in the browser (maps.google.co.uk), hope that the map will get you there, or \u2013 when all else fails \u2013 buy a paper map. Or ask someone. <br><br><em>Apple's new maps.

Getting every item in the world in the right place with the right name is no small task \u2013 but Apple seems to have embarked on it, for better or worse.</p> <h2>iPhone 4 antenna \u2013 July 2010</h2> <p>\"Antennagate\", as it was inevitably known, began when <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2010/jun/24/iphone-reception-problems-bottom-edge\">new owners of the iPhone 4 started using their devices</a> - and discovering that the new design had worse reception when their hand bridged the gap between the two external antennae on the lower left. Some complained by email to Steve Jobs - who <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/blog/2010/jun/25/iphone-reception-problems-solved\">responded</a> \"don't hold it that way\". </p> <p>Although Jobs <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2011/oct/24/steve-jobs-biography-antennagate\">thought that the claims were a smear campaign</a>, two weeks later he fronted a press conference at which he said that Apple would offer a free \"bumper\" for the phones \u2013 while also saying that only 0.55% of iPhone 4 owners had complained to Apple about problems. The iPhone 4 was knocked off PR World's \"Top 10 Cell Phones\" list. Separate testing by AnandTech suggested that the iPhone 4 was actually more sensitive to mobile signals than its predecessor. The iPhone 4 sold substantially more than the 3GS, and is still on sale today.</p> <h2>The buttonless iPod shuffle - March 2009</h2> <p>The what? That's right: Apple <a href=\"http://www.macworld.com/article/1139333/iPod_shuffle_design.html\">released an iPod with no buttons at all</a>, and it wasn't even April Fool's Day. You were meant to control it through your headphones, which <em>would</em> have a button. In September 2010, Apple updated the line. Guess what? No more buttonless iPod shuffles; instead, they now had buttons again. (Thanks Michael DeGusta for <a href=\"http://twitter.com/degusta/status/250133326847959040\">pointing that one out</a>.)</p> <h2>MobileMe \u2013 July 2008</h2> <p>The launch of MobileMe \u2013 Apple's first big foray into cloud computing \u2013 was meant to be a proud moment. Apple created a paid-for service which was meant to synchronise email, calendars, address books and settings between Macintosh computers and iPhones. It launched at the same time as the iPhone 3G, the App Store, and the iPhone 2.0 software update.</p> <p>But instead of being a triumph, MobileMe <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2008/jul/31/apple.email\">turned into a fiasco</a>, with people failing to receive email and the service suffering long outages. In an email to staff, Jobs said that the launch, which saw repeated outages, was \"not up to Apple standards\". He was more brutal with the staff of the MobileMe division, whom he called into a meeting hall and berated. \"Can anyone tell me what MobileMe is supposed to do?\" he asked. On receiving an answer, he responded: \"So why the fuck doesn't it do that?\" The head of the team was fired in front of the rest. Jobs later <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/blog/2008/aug/05/stevejobsregretsmobilemeco\">apologised publicly</a>.</p> <p><br><em>MobileMe became iCloud. Photo by <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/osde-info/\">osde8info</a> on Flickr. <a href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0/\">Some rights reserved</a></em></p> <p>MobileMe morphed in 2011 into iCloud \u2013 which now provides storage for millions of iPads and iPhones, as well as doing the functions of MobileMe for email, and delivering text message-style iMessages over mobile data. </p> <h2>Original iPhone price cut - September 2007</h2> <p>The first iPhone was released in June 2007, priced at $600 for the 8GB version (there was also a 4GB version). In September, Apple <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/07/technology/07apple.html\">abruptly dropped the price</a> by $200 - leading to howls of protests and overflowing email inboxes at Apple. Within days, Steve Jobs acknowledged the mistake and said: \"Our early customers trusted us, and we must live up to that trust with our actions in moments like these.\" Early buyers were given $100 of credit for the Apple Store; Jobs defended the fact it was not the full $200 by saying that \"this is life in the technology lane\". </p> <p>The price drop did apparently help sales in the phone's first Christmas.</p> <h2>iMovie HD replaced by iMovie 08 - August 2007</h2> <p>By the time iMovie, Apple's free cut-it-yourself movie-making software, had reached version 6 (aka \"HD\") it had reached a sort of nirvana, offering a timeline to drag clips into, effects, separate sound volume controls, and simple import. Inexplicably, it then replaced it with iMovie 08 - a complete and user-mystifying departure from the features of its predecessor. The outcry was so great that Apple eventually had to offer iMovie HD as a separate download; it's still so popular that copies are sold on eBay. (Thanks Roy van Veen <a href=\"http://twitter.com/Royalty/status/250129996805443584\">on Twitter</a> for the suggestion.)</p> <h2>iPod nano screen \u2013 September 2005</h2> <p><br><em>A scratched iPod nano screen, October 2005. Photo by <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/weedavid/\">weedavid</a> on Flickr. <a href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/\">Some rights reserved</a></em><br>The tiny Flash-based nano, which Jobs unveiled by pulling out of his jeans coin pocket, had a colour screen \u2013 but early users quickly discovered that it <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/blog/2005/sep/26/problemssurfac\">scratched rather easily</a>. With the nano being key to Apple's plans to dominate iPod sales at Christmas, the early response from Apple was no response. Instead it huddled for a while before responding, some days later, to say there was a problem with a small batch of screens. </p> <p>The nano went on to drive Apple's biggest ever quarter of sales.</p> <h2>Revealing the PowerMac G5 \u2013 2003</h2> <p>Steve Jobs wanted the glory of unveiling the new Power Mac G5 desktop computer. Unfortunately his web team got there first: a mistake in the setup meant that the picture and specifications of the device were shown on the Apple website on the Sunday evening before his Monday speech, for long enough for screenshots to be snapped. Jobs referred to it in his speech as \"premature specification\". A website management position became vacant not long afterwards. </p> <h2>The Cube computer \u2013 2000</h2> <p><br><em>Back view of the Cube. Photo by <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ian_munroe/\">ianmunroe</a> on Flickr. <a href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/\">Some rights reserved</a></em><br>Shown off proudly by Steve Jobs in July 2000, the Cube (literally a seven-inch cube) was a fanless desktop computer (for which you had to bring your own screen and keyboard) aimed, Apple said, at \"prosumers\" \u2013 people who wanted professional-level power at consumer-y prices. Though the cubic design looked good, the fact that you couldn't add full-size graphics cards or upgrade the RAM, and that the price without a screen was higher than for a full-powered desktop Power Mac murdered sales. In addition, some had manufacturing problems that led to mould lines \u2013 or cracks - appearing in the sides. Apple put the Cube on ice in July 2001.</p> <h2>The Mac's missing CD burners \u2013 2000</h2> <p>In 1999, Napster exploded onto the internet, offering a completely new (if legally dubious) way of accessing huge amounts of music stored on other peoples' PCs. Abruptly, people began downloading music, and burning CDs of music. But at Apple, Steve Jobs was sure that the way forward was DVD playback \u2013 and so iMacs, PowerBooks and iBooks included DVD drives by default, not CD-burning drives. Potential customers turned away: Apple Mac sales dropped by a third while that of the PC market grew by 10%. In November 2000 Jobs warned analysts that Apple would see lower profits: we \"completely missed the boat\" he admitted to them: \"We just blew this one.\"</p> <p>Within a year, Apple had launched the iPod - which was only a theoretical idea when he spoke to analysts. </p> <h2>The \"hockey puck\" mouse - September 1998</h2> <p><br><em>Spot the odd one out: the iMac's USB mouse was an ergonomic nightmare. Photo by <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/moparx/\">moparx</a> on Flickr. <a href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0/\">Some rights reserved</a></em><br>Along with the attractive curves of the first iMac, Apple introduced a new mouse which was circular, rather than the more usual oval. Unfortunately, nobody seems to have tested it to see what extended (or even brief) use would be like. The \"hockey puck\" was incredibly frustrating to use because it gave no clues to the hand about which was the front or back, and which was the side. That meant the onscreen mouse often moved in the wrong direction. People who bought iMacs soon found they needed to spend on a third-party mouse as well, to the delight of third-party mouse manufacturers, who saw a brief boom \u2013 which, ironically, persuaded many that Apple might be a company worth building add-ons for. </p> <p>That latter effect was amplified by the number of iMac users who had to buy new peripherals, because the iMac dumped the floppy drive and adopted USB wholesale \u2013 both moves that Windows PC companies held off doing. The add-on accessory business for Apple products including the iPod, iPhone and iPad (and to a lesser extent Macs) is now worth billions every year.</p> <p>Somehow, the awfulness of the hockey puck mouse lasted 18 months before Jobs killed it in January 2000, citing its terrible reviews, and introducing an oval-shaped optical mouse which still \u2013 like all Apple mice before and since \u2013 only had one button.</p> <h2>The Newton \u2013 1993</h2> <p><br><em>Apple Newton beside an iPhone. Photo by <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/blakespot/\">blakespot</a> on Flickr. <a href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/\">Some rights reserved</a></em><br>The Newton was meant to be an intelligent \"personal digital assistant\" (a phrase coined by John Sculley and a Toshiba executive over dinner one evening). It would decipher handwriting and carry contact details and in essence be the first Apple iPhone \u2013 but years before the iPhone. However, the handwriting recognition was deeply flawed (unsurprising given the ambition of the project and the comparatively underpowered processors of the day) and the device was costly. Steve Jobs <a href=\"http://www.pencomputing.com/frames/newton_obituary.html\">finally killed the Newton</a> not long into his return.</p>",
  "<p>Barack Obama has defended his handling of the Middle East against criticism from Mitt Romney, saying pointedly that if the Republican presidential candidate wanted to start another war in the region, he should just come out and say it.</p> <p>Romney accused the president of failing to adopt a more aggressive stance towards ousting Bashar al-Assad from Syria, and claimed Obama's weak leadership elsewhere in the region had opened the way for the riots that led to the death of US ambassador Chris Stevens in Libya and three other Americans.</p> <p>Romney also attacked Obama for failing to offer enough support to Israel, particularly in relation to Iran.</p> <p>But Obama brushed aside the criticism. \"If Governor Romney is suggesting that we should start another war, he should say so,\" Obama said.</p> <p>The clash over foreign policy came in separate interviews with Obama and Romney by the CBS 60 Minutes show, broadcast on Sunday night. The exchanges gave the first indication of lines the pair may adopt in the presidential debates, the first of which is in Denver on 3 October.</p> <p>The Middle East is growing as a campaign issue, with many voters angry over the attacks on the US embassies. Romney is attempting to undercut Obama in an area, foreign policy, in which polls have consistently shown the president enjoys a considerable advantage.</p> <p>There is little public appetite for US involvement in another war after the one in Libya, in which France and Britain were portrayed as taking a lead, though backed by US logistical support. Obama has been careful to avoid the US being drawn into Syria and has refused to agree to Israeli demands that it set \"red lines\" on Iran's nuclear programme, which if crossed would trigger military strikes.</p> <p>In his interview, Romney criticised Obama for his failure to meet Israeli prime minister Binyamin Netanyahu either in New York this week when both will be at the United Nations or in Washington. He said this sent a message that the US was distancing itself from its friends.</p> <p>\"I think we also have to communicate that Israel is our ally. Our close ally. The president's decision not to meet with Bibi Netanyahu, prime minister of Israel, when the prime minister is here for the United Nations session I think is a mistake and sends a message throughout the Middle East that somehow we distance ourselves from our friends and I think the exact opposite approach is what's necessary,\" Romney said.</p> <p>Obama said he would not be pressured into making decisions. \"When it comes to our national security decisions, any pressure that I feel is simply to do what's right for the American people. And I am going to block out any noise that's out there,\" he said. But, he stressed that he felt an \"obligation, to make sure that we're in close consultation with the Israelis on these issues. Because it affects them deeply.\"</p> <p>Both men were asked about their biggest vulnerabilities. Obama said his was the failure to change the tone in Washington, a key promise from his 2008 campaign. </p> <p>He said: \"I'm the first one to confess that \u2013 the spirit that I brought to Washington, that I wanted to see instituted, where we weren't constantly in a political slugfest but were focused more on problem solving that \u2026 I haven't fully accomplished that.</p> <p>\"Haven't even come close in some cases. And \u2026 if you ask me, what's my biggest disappointment is that we haven't changed the tone in Washington as much as I would have liked.\"</p> <p>The admission echoes a similar remark he made less than a week ago in an interview with Hispanic television network Univision when he said he had been unable to change Washington from the inside as he said the lack of immigration reform had been his biggest failure. The remark was pounced upon by Romney and the Republican campaign. </p> <p>In his 60 Minutes interview, Romney was pressed on his tax reform plans but, as in past months, refused to go into detail. He said he would lower all income tax by 20% and would end many tax loopholes.</p> <p>\"The devil's in the details. The angel is in the policy, which is creating more jobs,\" Romney said.</p> <p>Because the tax cuts were being combined with an end to exemptions and deductions, most Americans would see little change in their tax payments. Working-class people would probably see as \"little break\".</p> <p>Romney, who released some of his of personal tax details on Friday, defended the fact that he paid less than 15% in tax because on investment income. \"I think it's the right way to encourage economic growth \u2014 to get people to invest, to start businesses, to put people to work,\" he said.</p> <p>Obama criticised Romney for having pursuing the same kind of tax policies as George W. Bush: tax cuts for the wealthy and rolling back regulations of the financial sector. \"Well, we tried that vigorously, between 2001 and 2008 and it didn't work out so well,\" Obama said.</p> <p>Romney also brushed aside the suggestion that his campaign was in difficulty. His team has been repeatedly forced on the defensive, unable to gets its message out. Last week was dominated by reports of internal strife and a devastating secret video of a Romney speech dismissive of 47% of Americans as freeloaders.</p> <p>But asked how he planned to turn things around, Romney said: \"Well, it doesn't need a turnaround.\" He added: \"I've got a very effective campaign. It's doing a very good job.\"</p>",
  "<p>Andrew Mitchell is facing renewed pressure after the Sun newspaper revealed that an official police report of a confrontation in Downing Street claimed that he described armed officers as \"plebs\".</p> <p>In a blow to the chief whip, who had been warned by No 10 that his position would be in jeopardy if more damaging details emerged, the Sun said the report confirmed the officers' account.</p> <p>The official report, which has been seen the Sun, says that Mitchell swore at the officers and described them as \"plebs\" when they declined to open the security gates in Downing Street to allow him to cycle past.</p> <p>Mitchell admits swearing in the presence of the officers, though he fiercely denies describing them as \"plebs\". His position would be untenable if he was proved to have used the word, because it would lend support to Labour claims that the Tory leadership regards public servants \u2013 even those charged with guarding the prime minister \u2013 as socially inferior.</p> <p>The decision of the police to issue a direct challenge to Mitchell, by showing their report to the Sun, means that the prime minister will once again have to review the position of his new chief whip. David Cameron had let it be known that Mitchell would be allowed to keep his job after apologising to the police last week if no more damaging details emerged. Sources said there were no excuses for Mitchell's behaviour, which has prompted a difficult few days for the government.</p> <p>Mitchell has admitted swearing in front of officers, though he insisted he used the word \"fucking\" to express frustration and did not direct it at the police. The chief whip, who went to public school, has emphatically denied accusations by unnamed police officers that he called them \"plebs\".</p> <p>The chief whip's explanation cut no ice with Labour, which said his account was \"unravelling\". Yvette Cooper, the shadow home secretary, said that the confirmation that Mitchell had sworn in front of police guarding Downing Street merited an investigation by Sir Jeremy Heywood, the cabinet secretary.</p> <p>Cooper said: \"Andrew Mitchell's account of what went on is unravelling day by day and we need to know exactly what happened. Everyone is already deeply concerned that a senior cabinet minister is reported as dismissing police officers doing an important security job as 'plebs.' It is really important that the prime minister does not compound this by dismissing the testimony of police officers and the evidence from their notebooks without proper investigation.\"</p> <p>Eric Pickles, the communities secretary, said he accepted Mitchell's explanation that he did not use the word \"plebs\". But Pickles mocked Mitchell when he told the BBC's Sunday Politics: \"He's never used it in my presence, but then again I'm very proud myself to be a pleb.\"</p> <p>The most authoritative account of Mitchell's side of his confrontation with the police was published by the Sunday Telegraph. In his weekly column, Matthew d'Ancona wrote that Mitchell has admitted that he swore, though it was not aimed directly at the police.</p> <p>The paper says that Mitchell admitted muttering in earshot of the police: \"You guys are supposed to fucking help us.\"</p> <p>Mitchell has let it be known he used the word \"adjectivally\" and was not directing it at the police.</p> <p>Mitchell's explanation may raise questions about the statement he issued on Thursday night when the Sun reported that he had sworn at police and had called them \"plebs\". In the statement, Mitchell said he did not accept he had used the words attributed to him. One of those words was \"fucking\".</p> <p>The Sun reported Mitchell as saying: \"Best you learn your fucking place. You don't run this fucking government. You're fucking plebs.\" The newspaper also reported a witness as saying that Mitchell had described police as \"morons\".</p> <p>The Liberal Democrats declined to call for his resignation. But Nick Clegg told the Andrew Marr Show on BBC1: \"I think that civility, being courteous to the police is important at all times. But of course it's especially important given the tragic events \u2013 the killing of Fiona Bone and Nicola Hughes.\"</p>"
