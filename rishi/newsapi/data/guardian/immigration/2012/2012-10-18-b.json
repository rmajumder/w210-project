All of this is bad new for the San Francisco Giants who are one loss away from going home and do not look like a team with enough offense to make a serious push here. And, yes, they have Barry Zito going for them tomorrow. With a win tomorrow in NLCS Game 5, the Cardinals will be headed to the World Series to face the Detroit Tigers, who eliminated the New York Yankees in the American League Championship Series earlier today.We'll be covering that here at the Guardian at 8:00pm EST. That will do it for us tonight, however, so from all of us here at the Guardian, thanks for following along with all of today's baseball action.

The difference between this year's San Francisco Giants team and the one that won the World Series two Octobers ago can be summed up the following fact: It's game four of the National League Championship Series and the Giants are at a disadvantage tonight because Tim Lincecum is starting.</p> <p>Yes, the two-time Cy Young winner has been having a disastrous season, to the point where he has been working out of the bullpen during these MLB Playoffs. Now, however, <a href=\"http://www.mccoveychronicles.com/2012-nlcs/2012/10/18/3522324/tim-lincecum-we-put-our-trust-in-thee\">the Giants need him to be Timmy</a> to avoid falling into a 3-1 NLCS hole to the St. Louis Cardinals. Giants' ace Matt Cain was on the mound yesterday afternoon for a rain delay extended Game 3, and pitched well, but the Giants offense could do nothing against the Cardinals pitching. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2012/oct/17/san-francisco-giants-st-louis-cardinals-nlcs-game-3-live\">The Cardinals won the game 3-1</a> and effectively took control of the series.</p> <p>Of course, the Cardinals themselves aren't in a perfect position here for a guaranteed win. Tonight's starter Adam Wainwright, a one time Cy Young candidate himself, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2012/oct/13/st-louis-cardinals-washington-nationals-nlds-game-5-live\">hasn't been quite himself this postseason</a> after a year where journeyman starter Kyle Lohse has jumped him in the rotation. More ominously, the Cardinals lost Carlos Beltran yesterday to a knee injury and his status is in question for the rest of the series (he may be able to pinch-hit tonight). It didn't hurt them yesterday, of course, as Beltran's replacement Matt Carpenter his the two-run home run that proved to be the difference maker.</p> <p>Because that's what it's like to be the St. Louis Cardinals, the luckiest team in baseball history. Maybe the most productive player in modern postseason history goes down, so St. Louis replaces him with a stretched-out pinch-hitter who responds by hitting the difference-making homer in his first opportunity. This is why the Giants have to be scared of St. Louis, they've clearly made some sort of deal with the Baseball Gods. I'm waiting for an opposing pitcher to spontaneously combust while pitching a no-hitter against them.

  "<p>Brussels police have swept the offices of two major public health organisations for bugs following a break-in at a building in the rue de Tr\u00e9ves in which laptops and documents relating to their battles against the tobacco industry were stolen.</p> <p>It is a convenient address for those involved in lobbying and monitoring the European political process, just five minutes walk from the Parliament building, and there are eight floors of well-equipped offices for burglars to investigate. But it appears they were interested only in those of the European Smoke Free Partnership and the European Public Health Alliance on the 5th and 1st floors. A third office \u2013 a company that has clients on the other side of the argument \u2013 was also entered, but nothing was taken.</p> <p>The burglars struck within 48 hours of the resignation of the European health commissioner, John Dalli. On Wednesday, he revealed that he had been forced out by commission president Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso over a report by EU anti-fraud investigators accusing a fellow Maltese of attempting to sell influence over the commissioner to a Swedish tobacco company.</p> <p>Amid the confusion and the denials of wrongdoing on all sides, one thing looks certain \u2013 the tough new tobacco products directive that Dalli wanted to launch this autumn will not go ahead on schedule. It may even be stymied for this parliament and pushed back beyond the next elections \u2013 or be dead in the water.</p> <p>Anti-tobacco campaigners are convinced that they are looking at a dirty tricks campaign designed to strangle the new directive (TPD) at birth. But nobody beyond Barroso and a few others knows the strength of the evidence, because Olaf \u2013 the EU anti-fraud office \u2013 is refusing to release the report that led to Dalli's downfall. It is now being passed to the Maltese judiciary.</p> <p>In March, Silvio Zammit, a Maltese entrepreneur, circus owner and deputy mayor (until Thursday) of the small town of Sliema was in contact with Swedish Match, a tobacco company based in Stockholm. It makes snus, a moist tobacco product that is placed under the lip. It is illegal in the rest of the EU. The company \u2013 which is involved in a joint venture with tobacco giant Philip Morris to commercialise snus and other smoke-free tobacco products outside Scandinavia and the US \u2013 hoped to persuade the European commission that snus is healthier than cigarettes because it is not inhaled.</p> <p>Swedish Match complained to Olaf that Zammit had asked for a very large sum of money \u2013 how much, nobody is saying \u2013 to arrange a meeting with the health commissioner.</p> <p>No meeting took place and no money changed hands. <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ft8o6RWMKUE\" title=\"\">Dalli, in a videoed interview</a> with a Brussels political paper, said the investigators' report \"stated there was no proof at all that I was involved in any misdeed\" and that no decision of the commission had been jeopardised. But the report claimed there was \"some circumstantial evidence that I was aware of what was happening,\" said Dalli. \"This I refute completely.\"</p> <p>Swedish Match claims Zammit came to it. It told the Guardian that it hoped the events of recent days would not undermine the tobacco products directive, \"which we have eagerly anticipated for the past 12 years. Our hope and expectation is that this time snus will be judged on its own scientific merits, that it will receive a fair trial and that the processes followed by the commission in the review of the TPD will continue to be transparent and fair.\"</p> <p>But Dalli in his video read out an email which he said was from the company to Zammit, asking for an informal meeting with the commissioner in Brussels. It asked how much Zammit would charge.</p> <p>\"These people were offering to bribe Zammit to arrange a meeting with me,\" said Dalli. \"He never asked me for any meeting with these people.\"</p> <p>On his Facebook page, Zammit is equally robust: \"I categorically state that I have never received any payment from Swedish Match or Estoc (the European Smokeless Tobacco Council). My role was that of a lobbyist and all my contribution in the matter was above board and regular, in consonance with established practices. Furthermore, I confirm that I was contacted by the foreign party and it was them that set the ball rolling,\"he wrote. He adds that he has resigned as deputy mayor and as a member of the Sliema local council to fight to clear his name.</p> <p>Florence Berteletti Kemp, director of the European Smoke Free Partnership, \u2013 an alliance of the prominent health organisations Cancer Research UK, the European Respiratory Society and the European Heart Network \u2013 is at a disadvantage because she now has no computer. Whoever burgled the office took it, together with the computer of staff at the European Public Health Alliance who were also working on the tobacco legislation. \"They made it look very messy, so it looks ransacked, but they have taken specific things from specific persons,\" she said. Those things were related to the Dalli affair.</p> <p>\"What we are witnessing is the biggest tobacco industry interference in public health policy at the European level. The backdrop to the burglary at our office is the political scene. We believe that is no coincidence,\" she said.</p> <p>The new directive was intended to try to reduce the temptation for younger people \u2013 and particularly women \u2013 to start smoking, she said. Dalli said in his post-resignation interview that it would have imposed new restrictions on smokeless tobacco products and banned flavourings such as chocolate and strawberry. It would also have required graphic pictures of the damage smoking does on 75% of every packet.</p> <p>But it is now on ice. It should have gone to a consultation stage at the end of this month, but nothing will be done before a new health commissioner is appointed. That means there is unlikely to be time to get it through before new European parliament elections in 2014.</p> <p>\"This ambitious proposal on the side of public health to protect young people from beginning to smoke will not be continued,\" said Berteletti Kemp. \"It is a mess.\"</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 19 October 2012 because the original said Swedish Match is part-owned by tobacco giant Philip Morris.</p>",
  "<p>Mike used to pride himself on his health, running double marathons and working as a personal trainer, but now he looked painfully thin and nervous. Sat in the bright living room of a safehouse where he lived for three months, he described having to retrain himself to eat properly after being kept in squalid conditions and forced to work unpaid for three years. He was, he said, a modern-day slave.</p> <p>\"Before this happened I never even thought it could happen in this country, or that it could happen to men,\" he said. \"But if you are desperate enough, anyone could find themselves in this trap.\"</p> <p>Mike is one of hundreds of men and women who are trafficked into Britain for the profit of their unscrupulous bosses, according to a government report. Estimates released on anti-slavery day suggest the number of people being trafficked into and around the UK is rising, with 946 victims in contact with authorities last year, compared with 710 in 2010.</p> <p>The report by the <a href=\"http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/crime/human-trafficking/\" title=\"\">inter-departmental ministerial group on human trafficking</a> states that trafficking gangs in China, Vietnam, Nigeria and eastern Europe now pose the biggest threat. But it is not just a foreign national problem, said Helen Grant, the newly appointed victims minister. \"This exploitation of vulnerable people by predatory gangs is not something that any civilised society should be prepared to accept,\" she said. \"It is happening to men, women and children, to foreign nationals and to British citizens.\"</p> <p>Perched on the edge of a bed in a safehouse for trafficking victims in the south-east that the Guardian had been given access to, Grant said it was difficult to know whether there had been an increase in trafficking or just in the reporting of the crime, but she believed the crime affected many more people than the official numbers suggested. \"Trafficking has been a forgotten issue that has happened behind closed doors, but now I think we are starting to see the true extent of it,\" she said. \"I certainly think the problem is greater than we are seeing.\"</p> <p>Grant <a href=\"http://www.helengrant.org/about-helen/biography-and-experience\" title=\"\">worked as a solicitor</a> supporting victims of domestic violence before becoming a Conservative MP. \"In the past there was a refusal to accept that domestic violence happened, and thank goodness we have come along from that, but we have to realise that human trafficking for manual labour, sexual exploitation or the harvesting of organs exists,\" she said.</p> <p>The report details two cases of people trafficked for illegal organ harvesting, which were stopped before any operation was carried out. A report from the Salvation Army released on Thursday said that of the 378 individuals it helped in 2011/12, 44% were trafficked for labour exploitation, 42% for sexual exploitation and one for the purposes of organ removal.</p> <p>According to the government study, 712 adult victims and 234 child victims were reported last year to the national referral mechanism, the body that identifies trafficking victims. Campaigners suggest the true figures could be significantly higher as many victims feared being deported if they tried to escape their situation.</p> <p>Aidan McQuade, director of Anti-Slavery International, accused the government of a series of policy failings that he said could lead to an increase in trafficking, including the removal of the right for migrant domestic workers to change employers and the failure to extend to remit of the gangmasters licensing authority.</p> <p>\"The fact that this issue continues to be seen through the prism of immigration means the decision on whether to protect a trafficked person is based more on their nationality rather than their right under the law to receive support,\" he said. \"It seems clear that until the government appoints a trafficking commissioner to co-ordinate its anti-trafficking obligations we will continue to see policy impeded by politics.\"</p> <p>According to the report, Nigerians were the largest group of potential trafficking victims, and Romanians the biggest group in Europe. It estimates there were 92 organised crime groups in the UK with known involvement in human trafficking, and 142 defendants were charged with offences related to human trafficking in 2011-12. It states that thousands of frontline workers including doctors, police, border staff and airline workers have been trained to better identify victims of trafficking in the past two years.</p> <p>At the safehouse, Mike described how he had been coerced into slavery after losing his job and becoming homeless. After sleeping rough on a beach for two weeks, a man approached him as he was making his way to a train station, offering him accommodation and work in exchange for \u00a320. His accommodation was a filthy hut on a caravan site to be shared with another man; his payment between \u00a35-10 a week for hard labour doing ground work seven days a week. \"I was just one of their tools, just a way to make them money,\" he said.</p> <p>He was hit once for bringing no work in on a particular day, and said other men were hit daily. He felt unable to leave because of the threat of violence. \"By the end I let go of all of my humanity and I just thought I deserved it,\" he said. \"The fear was that if I tried to leave I would be run over, hit by cars. In the end it seemed easier to stay than to go.\"</p> <p>When the site was raided by police who suspected men were being used as slaves, Mike did not believe his ordeal was over. But he accepted help and spent three months in a safehouse run by the Salvation Army, which runs 19 establishments across England and Wales after winning funding worth \u00a32m from the Home Office and Ministry of Justice last year.</p> <p>Mike hoped his story might encourage others to come forward and seek help. \"I want to get the message out there, I want people to realise that it does happen. People need to get out and seek help because there is help out there.\" He was looking forward to a brighter future. \"I am more positive, I just want a job, to work in an office,\" he said. \"I just want a normal life.\"</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 19 October 2012. It quoted Helen Grant talking about the harvesting of sexual organs. She was referring to the harvesting of organs. This has been corrected.</p>",
  "<p>Dilma Rousseff may be one of Brazil's most popular presidents ever but even she knows better than to challenge the prime-time power of the TV phenomenon known as Avenida Brasil.</p> <p>Rousseff, who enjoys a 62% approval rating, postponed a rally to endorse her party's candidate in a S\u00e3o Paulo mayoral race on Friday because it would coincide with the finale of the telenovela.</p> <p>The last episode of <a href=\"http://tvg.globo.com/novelas/avenida-brasil/index.html\" title=\"\">Avenida Brasil</a> is tipped to be a 70-minute storm of melodrama that includes a polygamous wedding, a celebratory feast and the answer to the question on tens of millions of Brazilian lips: \"Who killed Max?\"</p> <p>Against such competition, presidential aides feared the rally would fall flat: even hardcore politicos are likely to stay at home to see the mystery solved.</p> <p>Several newspapers pointed out that Rousseff is a fan of the show \u2013 which has been running up to six days a week since March \u2013 and may simply have wanted to be among the 50% of the viewing public expected to tune in for the climax.</p> <p>It makes political sense for the president to tune into Avenida Brasil's audience, which has come to epitomise the rise of a formerly poor social group that is now in the most powerful consumer stratum in the country.</p> <p>Brazil's \"C-class\" \u2013 as they are categorised \u2013 have grown rapidly in size and influence over the past decade thanks to the growth of the Brazilian economy, widening credit lines and the government's efforts to address income inequality.</p> <p>Since 2004, the government says, 32 million Brazilians have been lifted out of poverty. Last year, this helped the C-class \u2013 defined as those earning between 1,000 and 4,500 reals (\u00a3300-\u00a31,400) a month \u2013 to constitute for the first time a majority of Brazil's population of 196 million.</p> <p>Ten years ago, they needed every penny to meet their bills. Today they have enough disposable income to buy mobile phones, laptops and motorbikes. According to a study commissioned by the president's office, the C-class accounts for 76% of supermarket sales and 60% of visits to hairdressing salons.</p> <p>With this group increasingly beloved by advertisers, TV producers at Rede Globo \u2013 the channel that dominates the \"telenovela\" industry \u2013 are angling more shows and lucrative product placement opportunities in their direction.</p> <p>Few more so than Avenida Brasil, which is named after a busy road in Rio de Janeiro that leads from rundown suburban communities and <em>favela</em> shanty towns into the smart city centre.</p> <p>Dating back to 1951, telenovelas have long been a feature of Brazilian life and often mix plots from different classes and a range of controversial issues. But rarely has a prime-time drama pushed more C-class buttons.</p> <p>This is evident in <a href=\"http://vimeo.com/41310400\" title=\"\">the opening credits, set over a <em>baile charme</em> dance track and images of a pulsating nightclub</a>, and the bling-bedecked cast of characters \u2013 a cuckolded footballer, the owner of a manicure parlour and the sparsely clad <em>piriguete</em> party girl, Suelen.</p> <p>Mariana Zylberkan, a columnist for Veja magazine, says the show represents a shift from the plush restaurants and bossa nova rhythms of upmarket Rio to the barbecues and techno of the C-class.</p> <p>\"The profile of the characters is unprecedented among the telenovelas of the past 10 years,\" she writes, calculating that 79% belong to the \"new middle class\".</p> <p>Marieta Pinheiro de Carvalho, a history lecturer at the University of Rio de Janeiro, said the focus on C-class was becoming a trend.</p> <p>\"In previous novelas, there was too much value placed on the richest class. What is happening now is a classical part of the civilising process: groups that didn't have much power in the past now have more economic and social influence so they are contesting a greater public space.\"</p> <p>Reflecting the optimism and the lingering vulnerability of the formerly poor, the plot features spectacular social rises and falls when match-deciding penalties are missed, wrongdoing is exposed and love affairs succeed or go awry.</p> <p>At least two of the lead characters are raised in rubbish dumps. One plots revenge. The other, Max, has been murdered. The culprit is the source of as much speculation this week as \"Who shot JR?\" at the 1980s peak of in the US soap Dallas \u2013 or the mystery over the killing of Dirty Den in EastEnders in the UK.</p> <p>But there are distinct differences between British soap operas and Brazilian telenovelas, which tend to run in more intense bursts \u2013 every weekday over a roughly eight-month period, ending with a spectacular finale.</p> <p>This is not that first time that a telenovela has overshadowed politics. In 1993, the impeachment of president Fernando Collor de Mello was pushed off the front pages by the real-life murder of soap opera star Daniella Perez, by the actor who was playing her jealous boyfriend in De Corpo e Alma (Of Body and Soul).</p> <p>The genre was recently thought to have been in terminal decline as audiences switched from hackneyed storylines to cable TV and the internet, while rivals in Mexico, Venezuela and even South Korea competed in the wider Latin American market. But slicker HBO-like cinematography and a new generation of scriptwriters \u2013 such as Jo\u00e3o Emanuel Carneiro, who wrote Avenida \u2013 have revitalised the telenovela by appealing to the young and the C-class.</p> <p>As Avenida Brasil approaches its finale with another murder, a marriage proposal and the creepy rantings of the father of the suddenly sympathetic villain Carminha, the ratings are creeping closer to the 50% level, which has rarely been seen since the 1990s. The last episode is expected to surpass that.</p> <p>The outcome is, of course, secret. But showbiz websites predict it will wrap up with a solution to Max's murder, the wedding of the lead characters, and a huge party to mark the opening of a shopping mall in Divino \u2013 a perfect happy ending for the advertisers who adore the new consumer class.</p> <p><em>Additional reporting by Carolina Massote</em></p>",

It includes accounts from relatives of several people who disappeared. Here are a couple of them:</p> <h2>Amer Abdullah</h2> <blockquote> <p>Amer Abdullah, 32, is from Sinjar near the city of Ma\u2019arat al Numan in the province of Idlib. His brother Hisham told Avaaz: \"My brother was just a farmer before the beginning of the revolution. With the beginning of the demonstrations in our area, the security forces stifled us, denying access to basic supplies that we cannot live without, specifically oil fuel that we use for heating. My brother contributed to bringing fuel oil from several fuel stations to be distributed to the residents.</p> <p>\"On February 18, 2012, and while heading to a fuel station to bring fuel oil, he passed a military checkpoint in the area of Wadi al Daif, east to the city of Ma\u2019arat al Numan, and was arrested there. Since then, we do not know anything about him except for news from recently released detainees. We last heard about him 3 months ago, we were told that he was in the prison of Mazzeh, physically weak and that he lost a lot of weight. We still don\u2019t know in which security branch he is being held. We did not dare to go and ask about him for fear of being arrested.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <h2>Anas al-Shaghri</h2> <blockquote> <p>Anas al-Shaghri is 23 and a nonviolent protester who was disappeared in a rural area of Banyas shortly after the protests in the town began. His sister said: \"On the 14th of May, 2011, my brother was arrested and handed over after midnight by someone he trusted. He was supposed to meet him to change his place of hiding. When we contacted this person he told us: \u2018Yes, I handed Anas over myself.\u2019 Since then we have not heard any news from my brother, except for some information that he was in Branch 291 State Security in Damascus. We heard that through one of the recently released detainees. He also told us that Anas was in solitary confinement and was subjected to severe torture. This left me in a state of fear and horror over my brother to the point where I cried every day just imagining what could have happened to him.</p> <p>\"Every time we ask about Anas they deny that he was detained in one of their security branches. We hired a lawyer for this matter but to no avail. What made Anas\u2019s case unique is that he was one of the first to call for peaceful demonstrations in Banyas. He used his friendships and his strong charismatic personality to incite demonstrations. Anas was also one of the most active media spokesmen in the city of Banyas, he was in constant contact with various news outlets; this made the security forces and Shabiha more resentful and hateful towards him.\"</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-10-18T10:33:39.810Z\">at 11.33am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-507fc5cec0e361310bc6d146\" class=\"block is-summary\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-18T09:03:10.084Z\">10.03am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Yemen explosions blamed on electrical fault</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here is another \u2013 very dramatic \u2013 picture showing multiple explosions in the Yemeni capital.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Dory_Eryani/status/258853667040555009\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>wow the explosion is very big ! <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search/%23previoustweet\">#previoustweet</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search/%23Yemen\">#Yemen</a> <a href=\"http://t.co/tPCQMFLq\" title=\"http://twitter.com/Dory_Eryani/status/258853667040555009/photo/1\">twitter.com/Dory_Eryani/st\u2026</a></p>&mdash;Hind Aleryani\u0647\u0646\u062f(@Dory_Eryani) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Dory_Eryani/status/258853667040555009\" data-datetime=\"2012-10-18T08:54:58+00:00\">October 18, 2012</a></blockquote> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Macoombs/status/258850794378506241\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Yemenis crowded on their rooftops watching columns of smoke rise from explosions hitting base of a hilltop in NW area of Sanaa, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search/%23Yemen\">#Yemen</a>.</p>&mdash; Casey L Coombs (@Macoombs) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Macoombs/status/258850794378506241\" data-datetime=\"2012-10-18T08:43:33+00:00\">October 18, 2012</a></blockquote> </figure>  <p>General Ali Muhsen's people are claiming that it was caused by an electrical fault:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/BaFana3/status/258854548293165056\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/search/%23Yemen\">#Yemen</a> | Gen Ali Muhsin's news site : Explosions in <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search/%23Sanaa\">#Sanaa</a> weapons store due to electrical fault.

That's the modern world. Sometimes \u2013 quite often actually \u2013 I wish I had been born in the 12th century.</p> <p>Camilla, bless her, had this marvellous idea that I should write down my thoughts as a kind of public diary instead, and Tiggy has shown me how to type them out on her computer in the form of what she says is called a \"blog\". I thought at first she said bog, but she insists it's blog. So here we are. Quite historic in its way.</p> <p>Camilla warned me not to be controversial, and suggested I write about the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2012/oct/16/great-british-bake-off-john-whaite\" title=\"\">Great British Bake Orf</a>, which we always make a point of watching. So much better than most of the American rubbish on the television. It's nice to be able to say well done to the BBC, especially at a time when they are being attacked over <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/greenslade/2012/oct/10/jimmy-savile-bbc\" title=\"\">poor Jimmy Savile</a>.</p> <p>Bunny in the press office told me it was unwise to mention Jimmy. The man is apparently now a pariah. But I knew him well \u2013 he had a cottage in the Highlands where I had the pleasure of dining \u2013 and found him most amusing. He was in the tradition of great British eccentrics, and if we can no longer find a place for such people we are surely diminished as a nation. No doubt he had some foibles \u2013 don't we all? \u2013 but the man is DEAD. Let him rest in the peace of the world beyond. I thought <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/video/2012/oct/10/jimmy-savile-tombstone-scarborough-video\" title=\"\">tearing up his headstone</a>, grotesque though it was, was appalling. Is nothing sacred these days?</p> <p>I am told there are now <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/oct/17/jimmy-savile-government-barrister-investigations?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">eight inquiries</a> into whatever he is alleged to have done. They should have gone to Gordonstoun if they really wanted to witness peculiar behaviour! <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/video/2012/oct/16/jimmy-savile-ed-miliband-video\" title=\"\">That ghastly man with the strange voice who leads the Labour party even wants a public inquiry</a>. Inquiry-itis is one of the evils of what passes for modern society. Let the dead bury the dead, as the Bible wisely instructs us.</p> <p>Mention of Gordonstoun reminds me how cold it used to be there. Some winter mornings when we were woken up for our 5am run, you had to break the ice that had formed in the bath with a polo mallet. But it was character forming. Look at me. I get furious when I see so many people complaining about <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2012/oct/18/energy-minister-tariffs-row-deepens\" title=\"\">high energy charges</a>. Fuel supplies are finite. When will we understand that? We have to make sacrifices. Ask yourself \u2013 do you really need that radiator on; would another pullover do the trick instead?</p> <p>We are endlessly being told about pensioners' fuel poverty, but my parents have reached a ripe old age despite it being bloody freezing at Balmoral, where the boilers have never worked properly. As for Sandringham \u2013 if there's anywhere in the world colder than Norfolk at Easter, I've yet to find it. But the cold is far better for you than stuffy, overheated, bacteria-filled modern houses. As with so much else, all this mollycoddling has got to stop.</p> <p>Another thing that makes my blood boil is the way townspeople poke their noses into the lives of those of us who make a living in the countryside. Badgers are jolly attractive creatures with their stripey faces, though extremely stinky if you've ever been close to a sett as I have on many occasions. But <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2012/oct/14/letters-observer\" title=\"\">I can't have them infecting my Friesians at Highgrove with TB</a> (no, I'm not referring to Tony Blair!). Of course we have to cull them. It's what Harry calls a \"no brainer\". And he should know.</p> <p>Now I accept that shooting and gassing are not very pleasant, and people with a fondness for The Wind in the Willows are likely to become upset. But I have a solution. Badger hunting! Imagine the Heythrop gathering on a crisp November evening for a night-time's hunting. What fun. Badgers can run jolly fast when they have to, and it would be cracking sport. It would also give hunts a much-needed shot in the arm, thus killing several birds with one stone, if that's not mixing an animal metaphor \u2026</p> <p>Camilla, Tiggy, Bunny, leave that plug alone. What are you doing? Have I said something remiss? You told me to be myself. I just wanted people to understand me and realise I had their interests at heart. After all, one day I will be their king. Please don't turn the computer orf. I'll write something sweet about the Queen Mother's letters instead. Oh blast, the damn thing's frozen.</p>",

  "<p>Hundreds of anti-abortion activists have gathered in the heart Belfast to protest at the opening of the first ever private abortion clinic on the island of Ireland.</p> <p>In driving rain, the demonstrators said prayers and waved placards with graphic images of aborted foetuses at the entrance to the new Marie Stopes clinic on Great Victoria Street.</p> <p>Some of them also tried to shout down a lone pro-choice demonstrator who held up her own placard with the words: \"Been in the situation? Only then does your opinion count.\"</p> <p>Danni Stanfield, a 21-year-old student from Belfast, said: \"Many of the people here today, who are pro-life, if they were in that situation themselves they might take a different point of view. I don't think many here today have come from the background where they have gone through abortions themselves.</p> <p>\"I am pro-choice but I had to come here and support the clinic. I am not saying to women who got pregnant unplanned that they should have an abortion, but rather that they be allowed that choice.\"</p> <p>She pointed out that the protesters have never been able to stop up to 1,000 women leaving Northern Ireland every year to have terminations in Britain. Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK where the 1967 Abortion Act does not apply owing to opposition from the political parties at Stormont and all the main churches.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/80EqQK7TLmk?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"283\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/80EqQK7TLmk\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>There was a heavy police presence alongside the anti-abortion activists at the Marie Stopes clinic, which has offered services including terminations for women who are up to nine weeks pregnant. A smaller number of anti-abortion campaigners were also packed into the front of Belfast Opera House, directly across the road.</p> <p>The clinic is based in the same building as the former Anglo Irish Bank, right in the heart of commercial Belfast.</p> <p>A white van bearing the slogan \"Abortion is Murder\" was driven continuously around central Belfast as some passing motorists beeped their horns in support.</p> <p>Ciara Coyle, who travelled from Derry to join the protest, said she believed abortion was wrong \"no matter what the circumstances\".</p> <p>Asked how she and her fellow anti-abortion activists could stop the clinic from operating, Coyle replied: \"Unfortunately all we can do is pray, to pray and to protest peacefully. To be in the streets. I just can't understand why our politicians and the likes of the health minister can't stop this already.\"</p> <p>She denied that there was a demand among women within Northern Ireland for abortion services. \"I do believe that Northern Ireland is a pro-life country, like the whole of Ireland, and we will continue to make our stand against this baby-killing clinic.\"</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/CkBpRq7ZE90?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"283\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/CkBpRq7ZE90\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>Meanwhile, Northern Ireland's attorney general has called for a Stormont investigation into the legality of the clinic's opening. John Larkin QC, chief law officer and adviser to the power-sharing government, said that while he cannot intervene he would be happy to give advice to the administration.</p> <p>Among those attending the protest were individuals and groups from the Irish Republic, where there is an absolute ban on abortion. They fear that the opening of the clinic, which will provide medical and not surgical terminations, will allow women from south of the border to travel to Northern Ireland for abortions in certain circumstances.</p> <p>Pro-choice campaigners plan to hold a rally in support of the Marie Stopes clinic on Thursday evening but intend to keep their distance from the anti-abortion activists.</p>",
  "<p>The Foreign Office has opened a new crisis centre to help rescue British citizens trapped abroad by political upheavals or natural disasters, in an effort to prevent a repeat of the delays in evacuating Britons from Libya last year.</p> <p>The evacuation fiasco in February 2011 left hundreds of UK nationals in Tripoli, Benghazi and in the desert oilfields after airlines cancelled flights. The government found it hard to find chartered planes to replace them, and one of them broke down before take-off, drawing an <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/feb/24/libya-plane-britons-lands-uk\" title=\"\">apology from the prime minister</a> and prompting the foreign secretary, William Hague, to order a review of evacuation procedures.</p> <p>\"The problems themselves were difficult to foresee. At one point, a series of aircraft didn't fly for a variety of reasons including technical breakdown. But whenever things like that happen we have to be better prepared next time, so I think things like that were a clear lesson that some things had to be changed and improved,\" Hague said.</p> <p>\"The main practical lesson was even more redundancy. If you've got a plane going to rescue people, you need another one that is on standby. Or another two. If you think you're going to need two, you perhaps need four. These are always difficult decisions because the more planes you have the more expensive it is. You need more redundancy, more capacity to deal with these events.\"</p> <p>The crisis centre, <a href=\"http://www.fco.gov.uk/en/news/latest-news/?id=823026682&amp;view=News\" title=\"\">in the basement of the Foreign Office</a>, has a video wall so that multiple live feeds can be projected at the same time. At the launch event it displayed a map of the world showing 13 countries where British officials have rehearsed crisis and evacuation procedures over the past years.</p> <p>The centre is equipped with interactive whiteboards that allow maps of the crisis region to be called up and marked with evacuation plans which are then sent to British missions around the world.</p> <p>A feed of information comes in from government agencies such as the <a href=\"http://www.bgs.ac.uk/\" title=\"\">British Geological Survey</a>, for information on earthquakes and tsunamis, and the <a href=\"http://www.hpa.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Health Protection Agency</a>, for information on any emerging pandemics, for example. Digital clocks on the walls display the time in the Maldives, Cairo, Washington, Hong Kong, London and Mexico.</p> <p>The aim of the centre, which has a permanent staff of 28 and a total surge capacity of 110, is to be able to handle two global crises at the same time. Hague said that drew on the other lesson from 2011, which was that crises did not necessarily come along one at a time.</p> <p>\"There was the New Zealand earthquake and the Japan tsunami which were very close to each other,\" the foreign secretary said. \"The sheer volume of events and the numbers of British nationals caught up in a whole series of political events and natural disasters \u2026 that's made it necessary to upgrade the crisis centre.\"</p> <p>The Foreign Office has also created a new rapid deployment team for the Middle East and south Asia, which will include consular issues, counsellors, logistics experts and, when necessary, police disaster victims identification units, and can now draw on more than 170 trained volunteers from Foreign Office staff who can be deployed around the world at a few hours' notice.</p> <p>\"People often ask what do you do when you're not in crisis, and I say we almost always are dealing with a crisis,\" said Juliet Maric, head of the crisis management department. \"There is almost always something we are watching or monitoring or tracking, or if not we are planning and preparing or training and exercising.\"</p>",

She looks at the issues faced by those with fluctuating conditions, and the pressure she feels to conceal the good days (\"...days that are amazing. Days when I can walk to and then around my local park, watching kids play and parents shout at them. When I can touch trees and feel grass between my toes if I take my shoes off.\") And she adds:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I refuse to buy in to this Atos-inspired way of thinking. I won't accept that I should wallow in my disease and take to my bed for ever more so that they'll give me a fairly small amount of money every week and allow me to keep my blue badge. What kind of a society is this that this Coalition is building? A society where those of us who are sick or disabled should be defined by those things? I will not do it. I'm not going to play. I'm going to carry on celebrating my good days ... I will continue to cherish going out and having coffees and lunches with friends; I will carry on getting stupidly excited about using public transport and marvelling at the Oyster card system. I'm still going to get a buzz out of walking to the corner shop just a couple of hundred yards from my house \u2013 I say walking, it may look like that from the outside but in my heart it's still so much of a novelty for me that I feel like I'm flying to the local Londis. After a couple of decades of not being able to do those things at all, I'm grabbing my right to love doing them with both hands and anybody who thinks I should do otherwise can go join the Tory party. <br>Is Atos really going to punish us for doing this? For trying to be well and 'normal', instead of sick and crippled and downtrodden? Is this what Cameron's big society wants from those of us who aren't completely able-bodied? Because if it is, there's something far more rotten and insidious going on than anybody is admitting to, and certainly there's more than enough horrors that we already know about. Like an inverse Robin Hood, this government is taking from the poorest and weakest and giving to the rich fat cats, and how can that be right? This isn't meant to be a rant about government, though I suppose that's an inevitable by-product; it's meant to be a spleen-vent about the impotence forced upon those of us who just want to work and have that bit extra we need to live on, so that we can. Those of us who want to be well and functional and a useful part of society.

The existence of an alcohol industry and many of our fellow subjects' inability to drink and behave responsibly forces untold costs upon the public purse and causes mass demand for policing and emergency medical services. We're not banning pubs or alcohol, though, are we? We're not talking in terms of locking up drunken offenders for inordinate periods to ensure they are not free to drink again next weekend. Yet more harm and cost is caused to our society from drunk young men and, increasingly, women.<br>Why not just lock up all of \"these people\"? \u2013 is it because we, ourselves, along with most people are or have been in this group and we know general labels around alcohol related violence and disorder do not apply to us?! &lt;&lt; Stigma in operation. We do actually know that the relationship between alcohol and crime is far more direct than the links between mental illness and crime and that the costs \u2013 measured in lives lost and money \u2013 are far greater.</p> </blockquote> <h2>Other news</h2> <p>\u2022 BBC: <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-19989350\" title=\"\">Crime in England and Wales falls</a><br>\u2022 CivilSociety.co.uk: <a href=\"http://www.civilsociety.co.uk/fundraising/blogs/content/13586/gift_aid_small_donations_scheme_is_no_gift_for_small_charities\" title=\"\">Gift aid small donations scheme is no gift for small charities</a><br>\u2022 Community Care: <a href=\"http://www.communitycare.co.uk/blogs/childrens-services-blog/2012/10/why-governments-adoption-consultation-is-naive-old-fashioned-and-laughable.html\" title=\"\">Why the government's adoption consultation is 'naive', 'old fashioned' and 'laughable'</a><br>\u2022 Inside Housing: <a href=\"http://www.InsideHousing.co.uk/tenancies/council-offers-tenants-%C2%A325000-to-downsize/6524251.article\" title=\"\">Council offers tenants \u00a325,000 to downsize</a><br>\u2022 Public Finance: <a href=\"http://www.publicfinance.co.uk/news/2012/10/cipfa-hits-out-at-u-turn-on-council-tax-benefit/\" title=\"\">CIPFA hits out at U-turn on Council Tax Benefit</a><br>\u2022 Telegraph: <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/educationnews/9615709/Statistical-illiteracy-leaves-citizens-at-risk-of-being-duped-by-politicians-and-businessmen-warns-British-Academy.html\" title=\"\">'Statistical illiteracy' leaves citizens at risk of being duped</a><br>\u2022 Third Sector: <a href=\"http://www.thirdsector.co.uk/news/1155260/hmrc-reveals-foiled-fraudster-tried-set-189-charities/\" title=\"\">HMRC reveals it foiled fraudster who tried to set up 189 charities</a></p> <h2>SocietyGuardian blogs</h2> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/patrick-butler-cuts-blog\" title=\"\">Patrick Butler's cuts blog</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/sarah-boseley-global-health\" title=\"\">Sarah Boseley's global health blog</a></p> <h2>SocietyGuardian on social media</h2> <p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/SocietyGuardian\" title=\"\">Follow SocietyGuardian on Twitter</a><br><a href=\"http://twitter.com/patrickjbutler\" title=\"\">Follow Patrick Butler on Twitter</a><br><a href=\"http://twitter.com/#!/clare_horton\" title=\"Follow Clare Horton on Twitter\">Follow Clare Horton on Twitter</a><br><a href=\"http://twitter.com/#!/AlisonBenjamin1\" title=\"Follow Alison Benjamin on Twitter\">Follow Alison Benjamin on Twitter</a><br><a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/societyguardian\" title=\"Facebook page\">SocietyGuardian's Facebook page</a></p> <h2>SocietyGuardian links</h2> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/society\" title=\"SocietyGuardian.co.uk\">SocietyGuardian.co.uk</a><br><a href=\"http://careers.guardian.co.uk/public-sector\" title=\"Get ahead: the Guardians public and voluntary sector careers page\">The Guardian's public and voluntary sector careers page</a><br><a href=\"http://jobs.guardian.co.uk/?INTCMP=ILCJOBTXT257\" title=\"Hundreds of public and voluntary sector jobs\">Hundreds of public and voluntary sector jobs</a></p> <p>SocietyGuardian editor: <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/alisonbenjamin\" title=\"Alison Benjamin\">Alison Benjamin</a><br>Email the SocietyGuardian editor: <a href=\"mailto:society@guardian.co.uk\" title=\"\">society@guardian.co.uk</a></p>",
  "<p>I'm the Seattle-based publisher of a <a href=\"http://offbeatempire.com/\" title=\"\">network of lifestyle websites</a> read by roughly one million people each month. Almost all of our readers are women, most of them are educated and many of them are quite politically liberal. Because of this large, diverse and progressive readership, we deal with community issues that perhaps wouldn't be such a problem on smaller sites. And lately, I've started to notice a disturbing trend.</p> <p>Over the past couple of years, I've watched the rise of a new form of online performance art, where liberal internet commenters make public sport of flagging potentially problematic language as insensitive, and gleefully calling out authors as needing to \"check their privilege\" (admit their privileged position within society and its associated benefits).</p> <p>As a publisher serving readers who identify as both progressive and marginalised (in many different, varying ways), this issue is hugely important to me \u2013 I'm protective of the quality of debate on my sites. As a progressive myself, it's also complex and challenging because while I very much share the political values of the folks who engage in this kind of thing, I'm not on board with the tactics \u2013 which essentially amount to liberal bullying, and are way worse than anything I see from the conservatives who swing by my publications. The sad truth is that when it comes to the motivations behind this kind of commenting, it's basically the same as the GOD HATES FAGS guys \u2013 even though the values are the polar opposite.</p> <p><strong>Common trends in this online behaviour:</strong></p> <p><strong>\u2022 Focus on very public complaints.</strong> I can think of exactly one time when someone emailed their concern about problematic language. These complaints seem to be always intended for an audience.</p> <p><strong>\u2022 Lack of interest in a dialogue.</strong> These complaints aren't questions or invitations to discuss the issue. They're harshly worded accusations and scoldings (which I've written about before).</p> <p>\u2022<strong> Lack of consideration for the context or intent.</strong> The focus is on this isolated incident (this one post, this one word, this one time), with de-emphasis on the author's background, experience, or the context of the website on which the post appears.</p> <p>\u2022 And on a more stylistic note, these complaints are often prefaced with phrases like \"Um,\" and other condescending affectations.</p> <p>It's challenging for me because the values motivating these complaints are completely in line with both my personal politics and my professional passion for catering to niche markets and semi-marginalised cultures (I say \"semi-marginalised\" because let's get real here: readers of my websites are more likely to be a 20-something white plus-size roller derby player or an introverted 30-something information sciences grad student \u2013 neither of whom who are marginalised in the same way as, say, a gay Cambodian amputee immigrant living in Mexico City).</p> <p>Increasingly, I've started recognising this kind of behaviour for what it is: privilege-checking as a form of internet sport. It's a kind of trolling, with all the politics I agree with, but motivations and execution that turns my stomach. It's well-intended (<em>so</em> well-intended), but when the motivations seem to be less about opening dialogue about the issues, and more about performance, righteousness, and intolerance toward those who don't agree with you \u2026 well, I'm not on board.</p> <p>This is where it starts to feel like the \"GOD HATES FAGS!\" sign-wavers. While the political sentiments are exactly opposite, the motivations are remarkably similar: I WOULD LIKE TO DERAIL THIS CONVERSATION AND HAVE AS MANY PEOPLE AS POSSIBLE WITNESS HOW RIGHT I AM. I don't care if your politics are progressive and your focus is on social justice: if you're shouting at people online and refusing to have a dialogue, you're bullying. I don't care if you're fighting the good fight: if you're fighting in a way that's more about public performance, shaming and righteousness, I'm not fighting with you.</p> <p>\u2026 Even if I agree with your goals.</p> <p>My big challenge is knowing how to respond to this kind of feedback, which comes in almost daily. Sometimes it feels like I have two options:</p> <p>\u2022 Acquiesce to every complaint of anyone anywhere on the internet, until we're putting trigger warnings at the top of posts that mention balloons because some people are globophobic (TRUE STORY!).</p> <p>\u2022 Align myself with insensitive assholes who defend their right to hate speech.</p> <p>Again, as a liberal I'm deeply conflicted about this issue. I love observing and following the ways that language shifts. It's exciting and fascinating to watch as the semantics of marginalised communities evolve. I recently had to talk to my ageing lesbian mother and her partner about how the word \"tranny\" causes a lot of issues for folks in the transgender community. My mothers are totally aligned with the cause and totally active in LGBT communities \u2026 they just hadn't got the latest memo.</p> <p>I'm totally on board with the reasoning behind shifting the language from \"illegal immigrants\" to \"undocumented immigrants.\" I get why the word \"gypsy\" is problematic. I've appreciated the lively discussions I've had with readers about words like \"<a href=\"http://offbeatempire.com/2012/05/derp\" title=\"\">Derp</a>\" and \"<a href=\"http://offbeatempire.com/2011/10/word-tribe-racist\" title=\"\">Tribe</a>\" (because these were <em>discussions</em>. Dialogues).</p> <p>I love learning new things about how cultures are defining themselves. I love that people take the time to try to improve my publications by sharing the latest language that communities are using. I love that readers feel safe enough to voice their concerns. I love this shared concern for sensitivity around language. I love the social justice motivations, and the encouragement that we all be self-aware of how the language we use has powerful, sometime unexpected impacts on the people around us.</p> <p>BUT. But. Seriously, I'm just not down with:</p> <p>\u2022 The derailing of conversations to debate semantics.</p> <p>\u2022 The need to process it all publicly (\"Look at me look at me look at meeee! I am the very MOST aware of my privilege and am therefore the very BEST progressive on the entire internet!\").</p> <p>\u2022 The righteousness.</p> <p>\u2022 The intolerance and inability to respect that those who share your values might not share your opinions on this particular subject.</p> <p>This is where this kind of conversation begins to feel more like liberal bullying, where the only correct response is agreeing and acquiescing. Any other response is seen as ignorant at best, hateful at worst.</p> <p>My priorities with online discourse are dialogue and respect. In my little corner of the online world, I keep my focus on constructive critique and articulate, compassionate communication. Shouting down people who disagree with you (even if I agree with your argument) simply doesn't feel productive or helpful. If I had a dollar for every time we have to delete a blog comment that I personally agreed with because it was stated as an attack \u2026 I could shift my whole business model. Being an asshole: it's not just for the GOD HATES FAGS people any more.</p> <p>Ultimately, when these complaints come up (which has slowly gone from \"monthly\" to \"weekly\" to \"almost daily\"), my editors respond with comments like: \"I understand what you're saying, and share your concern \u2013 but I disagree that this usage is problematic.\" Alternately, sometimes we just say: \"I agree that this usage is problematic, but I'm going to leave it.\" I want to make sure that folks know readers' concerns are heard, but that it doesn't always guarantee that we'll make changes.</p> <p>We're especially unlikely to make changes when readers engage in performance art privilege checking and refuse to have a direct dialogue with us. I often respond to a semantics-debating comment with an invitation for the commenter to email me directly to discuss the issue. Almost no one ever does. Apparently, having a one-on-one dialogue with a publisher isn't as edifying as performance art.</p> <p>For those of you who like to fight the good fight for social justice and language sensitivity online, before writing that Tumblr missive or firing off that privilege-checking comment, I'd love to encourage you to take a moment to ask yourself these questions:</p> <p>\u2022 Am I living my values with this exchange? If my goal is tolerance and sensitivity, am I embodying both those values in this conversation?</p> <p>\u2022 What are my motivations here? Do I want to make a difference, or just feel like I'm right? What would \"making a difference\" look like in this context?</p> <p>\u2022 Is this person an ally? How can I best communicate with them to ensure they stay that way?</p> <p>\u2022 What is my ultimate goal in my activism? Is this exchange the best use of my time to achieve that ultimate goal?</p> <p>In terms of my ultimate goal with this post: I want to support progressive activists in their very important work for social justice, but also beg them to carefully consider their methods and strategies with online communication. We're fighting for the same team, here. I wish we didn't have to spend so much time fighting with each other.</p> <p>\u2022 A <a href=\"http://offbeatempire.com/2012/10/liberal-bullying\" title=\"\">version of this blog post</a> first appeared on Offbeat Empire.</p>",

In hues so vivid they almost throb, he conjures cottages hunched under skies of tangerine, pink or purple; moonlit landscapes where trees dance, monsters pretend to be mountains, men have three eyes or pointed teeth, and kings wear coronets made from turrets. These creations take a playful, anything-goes approach to painting, with decorative curlicues and chequered patterns, more reminiscent of folk art and children\u2019s-book illustration. Auer\u2019s vision is a far cry from the macho, German art that preceded it. This exhibition charts his development as a painter from 2004 to now, from his densely detailed modern fairytales to recent works where colour dominates and figures and flora become lacier and free-floating. <br></br><strong><em><a href=\"http://www.corvi-mora.com/\">Corvi-Mora</a>, SE11, Fri 26 Oct to 21 Dec</em></strong><br></br><em>SS</em><br></br>Untitled (2009), by Abel Auer</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397915811\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/17/1350490208614/Ivan-Seal-006.jpg\" alt=\"Exhibitionist2010: Ivan Seal\" width=\"400\" height=\"476\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\"><strong>Ivan Seal, Bristol</strong><br></br>At first glance Ivan Seal\u2019s paintings are unassuming: small canvasses in muted hues that depict a series of ordinary items.

Pencils stand up on their own and bow at daredevil angles. The rainbow layers of crystal rock appear to be both the face of something solid and paper-thin. Far from straightforward depictions, Seal\u2019s creations are quietly self-contained fantastical painted worlds that the viewer enters into innocently, unprepared.

  "<p>\"Guys, the ice caps are melting now,\" <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/oct/11/im-with-the-bears-review\" title=\"\">wrote Chris Ross in the Guardian Review last year</a>. \"Where are those stories?\"</p> <p>The review's subject was a collection of short stories, I'm With the Bears, all on the issue of climate change. It featured good writing \u2013 from the likes of Margaret Atwood and Lydia Millet \u2013 but, as Ross put it, \"much of this material seems to have been lifted from the wastebasket.\" Why was no one writing fresh fiction about it?</p> <p>One year on, the question still stands. \"In spite of the stakes,\" <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/blog/2012/sep/30/50-months-climate-change\" title=\"\">said Andrew Simms on the Guardian's environment blog the other day</a>, \"the issue has receded from the political frontline like a wave shrinking down a beach.\" It seems that the wave never quite reached our beach \u2013 the beach of fiction writing \u2013 in the first place.</p> <p>Sure, there was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/fiction/9780224090490/solar\" title=\"\">Solar</a>. Ian McEwan's 2010 satire of a balding, overweight scientist with marriage problems explicitly focused on \"the most pressing and complex problem of our time\". That's the one everyone could probably mention. But after that? There was mainly silence (if you leave aside poetry, where much more seems to be going on, most notably, perhaps, <a href=\"http://whatisadrift.tumblr.com\" title=\"\">Tom Chivers' ADRIFT project</a>).</p> <p>There's apocalyptic fiction, of course, and you could, I suppose, connect a novel such as Margaret Atwood's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/fiction/9781844085644/the-year-of-the-flood\" title=\"\">The Year of the Flood</a> to climate change. But is this type of literature really concerned with the issue, or does a vaguely related scenario merely serve as a purpose for other themes and situations? (Also, as environmentalists are increasingly keen to point out, climate change isn't really about the end of the world at all; it's about living conditions becoming harder and harder as we go along.)</p> <p>Yes, Jonathan Franzen's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/fiction/9780007318520/freedom\" title=\"\">Freedom</a> (2010) touched on the issue (the \"greener than Greenpeace\" Walter is deeply worried about it), and one could stretch things by considering books such as Joe Dunthorne's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/fiction/9780241144060/wild-abandon\" title=\"\">Wild Abandon</a> (2011), which is interested in low-carbon living. A number of childrens' books are on-topic, too. In Saci Lloyd's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/unclassified/9780340970157/the-carbon-diaries\" title=\"\">The Carbon Diaries 2015</a> (2008), for example, the UK has become the first nation to introduce carbon dioxide rationing. But the kids are alright, really: many are getting climate change much better than the grown-ups do (and, naturally, they're much more worried about it).</p> <p>No, it's we adults who are failing to have this conversation. It's an unpleasant conversation to have, no doubt about it \u2013 and maybe that's why it's not really taking place in fiction, at least not centre-stage. Many novels vaguely reference the situation; sentences such as \"in a warming world\" or \"in these times of climate change\" are common in much of what's being published at the moment. But that's about it.</p> <p>As such, the portrayal of climate change in fiction might actually be a pretty accurate reflection of what's going on in the real world. We know about it, and we know it's a pretty damn serious problem, but engage with it directly? Maybe tomorrow. Maybe the day after tomorrow. Isn't someone else looking into it? We don't want to have this conversation, it seems; and neither do most characters in most novels being published.</p> <p>It's probably also true that climate change is far too complex an issue to write a definitive novel about. But is it too complex an issue for fiction writers to make a contribution? To write not so much a definitive novel about it, but one of many complementary ones? My own attempt at this, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/fiction/9780957192508/from-here\" title=\"\">From Here</a> (2012), tells the story of a group of ordinary people (a supermarket cashier, an ex-banker, a hipster girl), who've come together in an unlikely alliance \u2013 realising how this one issue touches them all to the core. It's full of the contradictions surrounding climate change, and the confusion many people (even those actively involved) feel around it. Telling people that I was working on a story that tackles the issue head-on, and with a clear stance on it, the response I often got was: are you sure? Which, more than once, probably meant: are you completely out of your mind?</p> <p>There's a school of thought that says novels shouldn't (even can't) be about a very current issue. One could reply that climate change isn't very current in that sense \u2013 it didn't start yesterday, and it will be with us for a long, long time \u2013 but I won't, because our response to it (or lack thereof) is as current as it gets. But ought that really to prevent us from writing about it?</p> <p>Zadie Smith beautifully described the dangers of writing fiction that's grounded in the now <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/audio/2012/sep/07/zadie-smith-james-meek-podcast\" title=\"\">in a recent Guardian podcast</a>. People tend to find their own time \"uninteresting, vulgar and stupid,\" she said, and they will constantly accuse you of \"shallowness, because there's a sense that literature must be timeless\". And yet, the novels that \"end up being important to people are the ones which in some way express their time\" \u2013 provided you're not simply producing a \"springboard to talk about whatever is in the news.\"</p> <p>It's definitely a fine line, but we need to have this conversation, and I refuse to accept that I'm the only one who believes that fiction can make a massive contribution to it. Novels are about human beings, and it's one of their great strengths that they can be as open and honest as they wish \u2013 about our errors and failures, about our confusions, but also about our deepest wishes and hopes. That's why they have the power to cut through many of the things that make our coming-to-terms with climate change so hard on a strictly factual level.</p> <p>What is our fiction, if it's shying away from \"the most pressing and complex problem of our time\"? What is our fiction, if all we really strive for is to make some universal statement on humankind, avoiding the messiness that's the here and now? What is our fiction if, wanting to be timeless, we forget our own times? So, I'm putting this as a question, but also as a provocation: Where are those stories?</p>",
  "<p>Less than half of the international students eligible to stay on at London Metropolitan University have opted to do so, with more than 55% of students finding a place elsewhere or abandoning university study.</p> <p>Thousands of international students had their university places threatened when <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2012/aug/30/london-metropolitan-university-visa-revoked\" title=\"\">London Met's visa licence was revoked in August</a>. But a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2012/sep/21/london-metropolitan-university-reprieve-student-visa\" title=\"\">temporary reprieve granted to the university</a> allowed students with full immigration status who were already enrolled or who had been offered a place at the university, to stay on until the end this academic year \u2013 or until the end of their course, whichever is sooner.</p> <p>Around 1,000 of the students affected have now graduated or completed their course. But of the 1,385 remaining students who were given the option of sticking with the troubled institution, only 626 chose to do so.</p> <p>In the wake of the licence revocation, rival London-based universities led aggressive marketing campaigns in an attempt to snap up former London Met students. A taskforce was also set up which focused on helping students find alternative courses. It won't be clear which universities enrolled the most London Met students until mid-November, when a breakdown of student destinations is released.</p> <p>London Met vice-chancellor Malcolm Gillies says the reprieve did little to repair the damage done by the revocation and that the loss of hundreds of international students will leave a hole in the university's budge.</p> <p>\"Although the High Court concessions have eased some of the immediate pain, the revocation caused considerable anxiety to many students and their families, and will have a significant effect on our financial position, which is being quantified.\"</p> <p>\"The university has been preparing for the consequences of the UKBA licence revocation and we will be pursuing paths to regain our highly trusted status very soon. In the meanwhile we continue to be committed to offering educational opportunity, on equitable principles, to a diverse range of national, European Union and international students.\"</p> <p>A student support fund of \u00a32m for those who have been financially disadvantaged by the visa scandal will be open for applications until the end of October. The fund has already received 150 applications for financial help with visa reapplication costs, extra tuition fees, and additional expenses.</p>",
  "<p>The <a href=\"http://www.justice.gov.uk/\" title=\"\">Ministry of Justice</a> spends a significant portion of the tax payer's money on services which operate within the 'social justice economy'.

Get as much work as you can, even if it means doing four or five different things.</p> <p>\"By profession, I am a makeup artist. Apart from that, I design bags and work as part of the crew during photo sessions. I also organise weddings and do flower decorations,\" says Karolina. She also teaches makeup techniques to those who want to join the business. It makes for some very busy weeks \u2013 but still no guaranteed salary or paid holiday.</p> <p>Karolina says she didn't know what she wanted to do with her life when a teenager. This changed when it turned out she had failed mathematics in her secondary school exams. \"I had to forget about studying at university. Ten years ago it was a real tragedy. I heard so many times that I had ruined my life,\" she says.</p> <p>While her friends were in their first year of university and she was waiting for a retake of her exams, she started working. Karolina says that year was a \"breakthrough\" for her. \"I had time to find my own way,\" she says.</p> <p>\"It all started when I interned in a florist's shop. The job quickly turned into a passion. At that time, I started going to makeup school. After that, I was accepted into a respected school that taught flower arrangement and I started working for a well-known florist's shop. After a few years of work, I decided to start my own business,\" she says.</p> <p>Karolina says her life is now quite hectic. During the week she sometimes works on photoshoots that takes her all over Poland. \"I go to sleep in Warsaw and start the morning with a photoshoot in Poznan,\" she says.</p> <p>On the weekends, she organises weddings and does makeup for brides. Between all this she designs handbags which are then sewn by her mother. She says she now wants to focus on promoting her own handbag brand. \"Up till now it has been a hobby but I think there is a future in that and it could soon by my main source of income,\" she says.</p> <p>Karolina has no steady income. But she says she doesn't need that much. \"I want a vacation twice a year and a long weekend once in a while.\"</p> <p>She like sushi and spends a lot of money on petrol. She also says she \"avoids banks like the plague. If I want to invest in equipment, I simply save up for it.\" She adds: \"I meet many people who are doing different jobs at the same time.\"</p> <p>She says it's \"cool because you don't fall into a routine. But you mustn't forget that everything you do, you must do very well,\" she adds. \"I am lucky because I love the work I do.\"</p> <p><em>Translated by Remi Adekoya</em></p> <h2>Joseba Elola, El Pa\u00eds, in Madrid<br></h2> <p>Cases of middle-class people with cashflow problems were never alien to him. Luis worked in the legal department at the bank Caja Madrid for years, handling the papers day in, day out, for default proceedings. Little by little, he saw how classic cases of bad debtors were joined by new profiles: people who weren't usually on lists of this sort, people who were not on the fringes of society \u2013 in a word, middle-class folk.</p> <p>Little could he have imagined that at 57, it would be his turn to struggle to stay off those lists. Now he's already on the list of the unemployed, along with his wife, who's been out of work for five years. They have given up their credit cards, and this month their home internet connection has been cut off \u2013 one more expense they just can't afford.</p> <p>In front of the Inem (national employment office) near the M\u00e9ndez \u00c1lvaro bus station in Madrid, Luis talks about his predicament.</p> <p>\"A litre of petrol already costs more than a cup of coffee,\" says Luis. \"Our car's just gathering dust now.\" What savings the family had have been dwindling over the past few years, especially since his wife lost her job as an administrative assistant.</p> <p>Their elder son, a 27-year-old economist, is doing an internship at an insurance company; as Luis puts it, he's \"working for free\". So this four-person family (the younger son is 15) has an income of \u20ac1,400, the amount Luis receives in early retirement pay. His mortgage eats up \u20ac600. Another \u20ac300 is debited for the loan he took out to pay back an advance. Which leaves \u20ac500 to get through the whole month. The days when they could go away on holiday are a distant memory; the luxury of going out is a thing of the past. \"We've got to make it through the whole month on what we have.\"</p> <p>Goodbye to the book club and to the union dues he used to pay. And next month, goodbye to the \u20ac90 they pay to have television, telephone and internet. \"I used to work and live with a certain degree of security, but everything has changed,\" he says. \"Emotionally, you feel awful. I've still got a little life in me, I don't think what's happened to me is fair. At 57, I don't have any chance of finding work anymore.\"</p> <p>Luis Fern\u00e1ndez, head of Adesorg, an association of the unemployed, puts it quite clearly: \"Those of us who've been unemployed for a while have adapted: we work on the sly, slave labour, and we're going to start growing feathers from eating so much chicken. But I'm worried about what's going to happen with the upper-middle class: they're going to end up in this phase soon and the trauma's going to be huge. From having a settled life, even if without a whole lot of luxuries, to being treated like dirt.\"</p> <p><em>Translated by Eric Rosencrantz</em></p> <h2>Federico Taddia, La Stampa<br></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397951829\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2012/10/17/1350471579185/Daniele-Mondiale-001.jpg\" alt=\"Daniele Mondiale\" width=\"165\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Daniele Mondiale, who moved back home this year midway through his doctorate.

But this year, he was forced to return to live with his parents.</p> <p>\"When I told Mum and Dad that the only way I could make it to the end of the month was to come back and live under their roof, I felt a mixture of conflicting emotions: on the one hand, a sense of failure and humiliation, but on the other, the peace of mind that comes with knowing I had given it my all but had come up against a difficult period in history.\"</p> <p>For a while, things were good for Daniele. He graduated in architecture at Milan Polytechnic, and quickly got to the point of earning around \u20ac2,000 a month. He rented a studio and was financially independent. \"It was 2007, before the financial crisis, and for a couple of years I had a real sense that I was building a future for myself. It was an illusion, though; a flash in the pan.\"</p> <p>The economic situation closed the building sites: everything suddenly became more difficult. The drop in the amount of work available prompted fierce competition and the immediate consequence was that payments went down.</p> <p>\"The big fish \u2013 the well-established practices \u2013 started snapping up all the work, leaving us smaller fish without a scrap. They were paying their part-timers ridiculous sums. And at the same time the cost of living was going up unstoppably: it became impossible to live off an amount of money that would have covered shopping, petrol and the bills just months earlier.\"</p> <p>So Daniele and a colleague decided to flat-share, splitting the rent on a small loft apartment on the outskirts of town. The plan was to carve out a small workspace in addition to the living area. But that idea soon foundered. \"In place of the studio we put in two extra beds so we could sublet. After 10 years, it felt like I was back where I had started: living in a flat with three other people and sharing a bedroom with somebody else to make ends meet. It wasn't exactly how I had imagined my life turning out.\"</p> <p>In the end Daniele gave up. With a degree and a masters and studying for a doctorate, he packed his bags and headed back home. It has not been a dead end. \"I've put 'architect' on a nameplate under the doorbell. I started to put myself about and put my name into circulation. Unexpected opportunities have opened up for me here, whereas in the city I was just one of many,\" he says. He has picked up some projects and earns around \u20ac1,500 a month \u2013 \"still not enough for me to live by myself, but I'm hoping that I've set off on the right track\".</p> <p>Living conditions remain undesirable. \"I've carved out a small room in the attic of the house where I grew up, with my own bathroom but a shared kitchen and hallway. It's not easy getting used to not having your own personal space and time any longer. Nor is it easy living again with your parents, who will always see you as their child and so, inevitably, will tell you off if you're late for dinner, ask you where you went the night before with your friends, and give you disapproving looks if you go out onto the veranda to smoke a cigarette.</p> <p>\"No, it's not easy getting used to all that again, especially after having savoured the taste of independence and of being able to get by on your own.</p> <p><em>Translated by Sean Wyer</em></p> <h2>Randeep Ramesh, the Guardian<br></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397951830\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2012/10/17/1350473485292/Stuart-Noden-008.jpg\" alt=\"Stuart Noden\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Changes in welfare funding mean that Stuart Noden, who is unable to work after a stroke, also fails to qualify for benefits. He is about to lose his home.

The 51-year-old worked for more than three decades as a cabinet maker in Manchester. Until recently he had a house and took foreign holidays twice a year.</p> <p>Since he blacked out and fell while working on the roof of his house two years ago, Noden's life has collapsed. He had a series of mini-strokes in March followed by a full stroke in June. He's been left with weakness down his left side, relies on a walking stick to get about and has regular seizures. Unsurprisingly, he has not worked since March.</p> <p>\"I used to work every day, never was ill for 33 years. Now I can barely walk and get so tired I sleep all day,\" Noden said. But his health woes are only part of the problem. In Britain, the financial and fiscal crisis has been felt most acutely in those areas targeted for cuts by a government determined to rein in public debt.</p> <p>The hospital cardiologist told him he could no longer drive and would not be able to return to work. Yet he failed to score enough points to qualify for the welfare payment designed to assist people who are incapacitated through sickness.</p> <p>He claims the government assessor did not take any notes about the problems he has been experiencing and knew nothing about the hidden implications of his condition.</p> <p>The points system, begun as a trial under the last administration and expanded under the coalition, determines who can qualify for the benefit, known as the employment and support allowance. Critics say it is being used surreptitiously to cut the welfare roll.</p> <p>\"They told me I only scored six points and I needed 15. I can't work and have been in and out of hospital. If I cannot get benefits, who can?\"</p> <p>Noden has appealed but says he was told by the Department for Work and Pensions this would take at least six months. \"Bloody crazy,\" he says.</p> <p>The Stroke Association, a national charity helping Noden in his appeal, in a survey of 2,200 stroke survivors earlier this year found that 38% had not received an assessment of their needs \u2013 effectively denying them welfare help.</p> <p>Noden describes the world of benefits as a Kafkaesque \"hell of people being rude and saying no\". The decision not to award ESA has cost him \u00a390 a week. He also applied for unemployment benefits but was denied support because he was not in a medically fit state to apply for work.</p> <p>He then applied for a disability allowance, but was considered to be insufficiently disabled to receive this benefit. He then applied for housing benefit and initially received \u00a310 a week which has now been stopped.</p> <p>The couple became reliant on his wife's \u00a3574 monthly pay as a cleaner. With a \u00a372,000 mortgage costing \u00a3520 a month, they knew they would not be able to survive on one income alone. \"We are getting by on \u00a325 a week. My wife cannot get more hours to work. So we are eating frozen meals and getting all our food from freezer shops. It's not easy to survive, to be honest.\"</p> <p>The couple are about to lose their home after falling behind on their mortgage repayments. \"The bank was fine with us reducing the payments until a few weeks ago when they started proceedings against us when I was in hospital. They had people come to the house to see that I had not run off or something.\"</p> <p>Once homeless, Noden will have to be housed by the local council, with taxpayers' cash being used to pay to keep a roof over his head. \"If they had given me benefits in the first place we could have stayed in our own house. Instead, the bank gets the house and the government and council will pay for me to live somewhere. Crazy.\"</p> <h2>B\u00e9atrice Gurrey, Le Monde, in Cergy-Pontoise <br></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397951831\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2012/10/17/1350472633071/Auch-re-family-008.jpg\" alt=\"Auch\u00e8re family\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Auch\u00e8re family moved out of Paris to find affordable housing, but are struggling to balance their lifestyle with increasing taxes.

Their mother, Cl\u00e9mence Auch\u00e8re, explains belt-tightening, French style.</p> <p>First there is the kitchen: new, yes, like an Ikea showroom, but installed by her husband, Fabrice, during the summer holidays. Then there are the cutbacks on holidays and going out.</p> <p>\"We no longer allow ourselves the luxury of going to the other end of the world as we might like. We don't go skiing, we have cut back on our cultural life, and think twice about everything,\" says Cl\u00e9mence.</p> <p>Property taxes have gone up by a third over the past three years, and the Auch\u00e8res are not convinced by the French government's austerity plan. \"We know there are more efforts that have to be made. But that we'll also be exploited,\" she adds.</p> <p>The Auch\u00e8res decided to move out of Paris just as the crisis was blowing up. Cl\u00e9mence's salary as a nurse barely paid for childcare. Rent, parking and food all added up. \"I couldn't afford new clothes and even birthday presents and having friends over to dinner were hard to afford,\" she says.</p> <p>Property prices pushed them 30&#xa0;miles out of Paris, where they found a four-room apartment for just under \u20ac200,000 (\u00a3161,000) in Cergy-Pontoise. The mortgage costs \u20ac1,400 a month \u2013 almost half of Fabrice's take-home pay.</p> <p>Cl\u00e9mence is not expecting a crisis as big as those in Greece and Spain, but is anticipating a more sober future. \"Taxes will continue to go up, while public services will become smaller and smaller in terms of human and financial resources.\"</p> <p>Her husband, an audiovisual technician, says working conditions have become harder. Until 2010, his events company had a succession of good years. Now clients are cutting back and want bigger, quicker events for less money. Working days are getting longer, pressure is rising \u2013 but salaries are not.</p> <p>Away from the furrowed brows, Bastien and Alban have fallen asleep. They can sleep easy. Their parents prefer to go without themselves, rather than cutting back on the fees for the baseball and hip-hop courses. They'd rather cut out restaurants and ice creams.</p>",

He didn't do it. He had a Democrat House and Democrat Senate, super majority in both houses. Why did he fail to even promote legislation that would have provided an answer for those that want to come here legally and for those that are here illegally today?\" Romney said.</p> <p>Obama sidestepped the question, listing changes to the immigration system he had made but not addressing why he failed to put a bill to Congress for comprehensive reform. </p> <p>However, while many Latino voters are unhappy with the president about that, there is little evidence they have confidence in Romney and the Republican party to address immigration in a way that is sympathetic to undocumented migrants. </p> <p>Romney's advert promises to unite families, provide work permits and find permanent solutions for undocumented youth living in the US. But he has offered only sketchy policy proposals and Obama noted that Romney's adviser on the issue was at the forefront of drawing up Arizona's controversial law permitting the police to challenge people over their immigration status.</p> <p>In a second Spanish-language advert released on Wednesday, Romney attacks Obama with allegations he has made more than $700m in cuts to Medicare \u2013 a theme the Republicans have repeatedly pressed during the campaign despite fact checkers saying the charge is false.</p>",

Tonight could be the night that New York head back to the Big Apple empty handed, with their long term future looking&#xa0;bleaker&#xa0;than it has in some time. There is however, one more shot to make it right, to come back from the dead, and turn their series against the Detroit Tigers into something of a competition. All of that is on the shoulders of CC Sabathia, who is the reason New York didn't go down against the Baltimore Orioles, the reason they have even so much as a sniff at World Series title number 28. Should he be fail to live up to his own high standards, there are serious doubts that the Yankees offense, putting on what must be one of the worst shows in playoff history, will be able to pick him up, and that is a gross understatement.&#xa0;</p> <p>Meanwhile, there is love in Detroit all around Comerica Park. Love for a team that is on the verge of realizing expectations, when they seemed unreachable for most of the season, back when they were stoic, sputtering, stalling. Now they can reach the World Series for the first time since they shocked baseball in 2006, when they made it to the Fall Classic, only to be undone by those St. Louis Cardinals. The Tigers will have the flame throwing Max Scherzer on the hill, Detroit's number two pitcher, who is primed to slice through the meek Yankees lineup, that is, unless New York somehow pull it all together at the last second.&#xa0;</p> <p>We could have champagne tonight, so get the ice buckets out, just in case.
