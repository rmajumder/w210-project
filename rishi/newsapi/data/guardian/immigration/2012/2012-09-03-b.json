  "<p>The UK Border Agency faces intense criticism from MPs for causing chaos in the student visa system with a \"poorly planned and ill thought-out\" change in the rules for overseas students.</p> <p>The agency's failings meant an extra 50,000 people abused the system, coming to Britain to work rather than study, the <a href=\"http://www.parliament.uk/pac\" title=\"\">Public Accounts Committee</a> (PAC) said.</p> <p>The committee of MPs said in a report published on Monday that the UKBA had enforced new rules for overseas students in 2009 before controls were in place. The result was a \"difficult and costly\" three years as the agency tried to amend the rules to clamp down on abuse.</p> <p>It removed controls such as spot-check interviews of students entering the country, the PAC says. But it did not make the new electronic system, showing a student had been sponsored by a licensed sponsor, mandatory until 2010. Instead, it and relied on sponsors' letters that were \"easily forged\".</p> <p>The report has been published a week after London Metropolitan University was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2012/aug/30/taskforce-london-met-international-students\" title=\"\">stripped of its right to teach and recruit students from outside the EU</a>, after audits found that more than a quarter of cases sampled had no leave to stay in Britain.</p> <p>The UKBA said there was no proof that a significant proportion of international students at London Met had satisfactory English. In more than half of the cases the university did not know whether students were attending lectures.</p> <p>The decision affects up to 2,700 overseas students, as the university can no longer teach its current international students after losing its licence.</p> <p>Speaking in the Commons on Monday, immigration minister Damian Green said: \"UKBA found systemic failures that meant that London Met had not been able to ensure the appropriate admission and tracking of students from abroad.\"</p> <p>The government accused the university of \"failing to address serious and systemic failings\" identified six months ago.</p> <p>Officials will start writing to affected students on 1 October, giving them 60 days to leave Britain or find another university to complete their studies.</p> <p>Labour MP Jeremy Corbyn said: \"The image around the world is one that is really quite appalling because it suggests that overseas students may well be deported from this country because of a decision made by UKBA for which there is no detail given as to the basis of that decision.\" Many of the university's buildings are in the MP's Islington constituency.</p> <p>The Home Office, through UKBA, introduced Tier 4 of the points-based system of skilled migration in March 2009.</p> <p>It was intended to control the entry of students from outside the EU who come to the UK to study. Under Tier 4 of the system, students have to be sponsored by an educational institution which is licensed by UKBA.</p> <p>Responsibility for testing whether applicants are likely to comply with their visa conditions has been transferred from the UKBA to the sponsoring institution.Margaret Hodge, the Labour MP who chairs the PAC, criticised the way the new system was introduced.</p> <p>She said: \"The result of the UKBA's poorly planned and ill-thought out course of action was chaos: an immediate high level of abuse of the new system and a surge in the number of student visas.</p> <p>\"In 2009 the number of migrants who abused the student route to work rather than study went up by as much as 40,000 to 50,000.\"Hodge said legitimate international students make a valuable contribution to the UK economy, and the UKBA had a responsibility to reduce burdens on those who do come here to study.</p> <p>But she said UKBA had also been \"unacceptably slow\" to react to a surge in the number of people who abuse student visas.The MP said: \"Even where it has been told by colleges that so-called students are not studying, it has been unacceptably slow to act.</p> <p>\"The UKBA must take urgent enforcement action to remove them. This would also send a message to other would-be migrants that the student route is not an easy option for those with no intention of studying.\"</p> <p>Responding to the PAC report, the immigration Minister said in a statement:</p> <p>\"This government has introduced radical reforms in order to stamp out abuse and restore order to the uncontrolled student visa system we inherited.</p> <p>\"Our hard-hitting new measures are beginning to bite - we have already seen the number of student visas issued drop by 30% in the twelve months to June 2012, compared with the same period in 2011, and recent enforcement action has seen four hundred student overstayers leave the London area and return home.\"\"Tough new rules have seen 500 fewer colleges being able to sponsor international students, and last week London Metropolitan University's licence to teach non-EU students was revoked after it failed to address serious systemic failings.</p> <p>.</p>",
  "<p>London Metropolitan University is launching legal action against the UK Border Agency's decision to revoke its licence to sponsor international students.</p> <p>The university said that it was taking action so its students could return to study \"as a matter of urgency\". The legal challenge, which could take the form of a judicial review, sets the scene for a clash between the government and the university sector over the rules for overseas students.</p> <p>The government stripped London Met of \"highly trusted\" status last week after the UKBA found a quarter of overseas students it checked on for an audit did not have permission to stay in the country.</p> <p>The decision to revoke the university's licence affected up to 2,600 overseas students and could result in a \u00a330m annual loss, London Met said. It announced in a statement: \"There is no evidence of systemic failings, as claimed. The evidence that we provided to UKBA clearly shows on file after file that we were taking every reasonable measure we could to be compliant.\"</p> <p>London Met said it had been carrying out checks on its overseas students that met, and in some areas exceeded, the UKBA's requirements. The UKBA's requirements had changed substantially at least 14 times in the last three years, it said, adding: \"London Met is concerned that the current immigration policy is creating confusion across universities in the country and irrevocable damage to the UK's globally recognised education sector.\"</p> <p>The system forces universities to treat students with suspicion \"until proven otherwise,\" the university said.</p> <p>The university's vice-chancellor Professor Malcolm Gillies said: \"London Met will fight this revocation, which is based on a highly flawed report by the UKBA. The university will continue to give top priority to the interests of our international students who have been so distressed by this precipitate action.\"</p>",
  "<p>\u2022 Bliss to be alive for this glorious summer of the Olympics and Paralympics. And what have we gained: a regeneration of the can-do spirit, the creation of new heroes, community engagement on a level not seen for a generation. Many people made this happen. All should have prizes. Some already have. There was, for instance, rejoicing in June, when <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-18456070\" title=\"\">Tessa Jowell was made a dame</a>. As culture secretary, she, with Ken Livingstone and the Olympic authorities, persuaded Tony Blair to back a British bid. Just deserts, people said. And the enthusiasm extended across party lines and to all who made that leap of faith. There was one sceptic, apparently. Some call him the culture secretary; others, Mr Hunt; close friends, Jeremy. We're not going to honour her just for being part of the last Labour government, was the gist of the noise from his office. No, we're not, supporters explained. We're doing it because without her, we would not have got the Olympics. Representations were made above his head. The rest is history. Good old Dame Tessa. Why would anyone listen to Jeremy?</p> <p>\u2022 The Murdoch empire probably doesn't since the BSkyB debacle, when the minister for Murdoch failed to seal the deal. And now we see signs that Murdoch people may also be tiring of the love-bombing they have been subjected to from London mayor Boris Johnson. Private dinners here, Olympic tickets there. And yet yesterday, when the Sun's ideologist-in-chief Trevor Kavanagh addressed the matter of the Tory leadership, he dismissed the blond as \"<a href=\"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/politics/4517670/TREVOR-KAVANAGH-Prove-youre-a-man-not-a-mouse-Dave.html\" title=\"\">untested as a team leader with real power and responsibility</a>\", and smiled that smile at education secretary Michael Gove. The Mail doesn't much care for Boris either. He'd better not upset the believers at the Daily Tel.</p> <p>\u2022 M'learned friends prepare, meanwhile, to fill their coffers yet further over the farcical stripping of the London <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/video/2012/aug/30/london-metropolitan-university-students-march-video\" title=\"\">Metropolitan University's right to hand out foreign student visas</a>. Legal experts say the university, faced with the ruinous implications of another coalition debacle, will be obliged to fight it through the courts. But if the decision stands and the Border Agency prevails, there will be other questions to be asked. How likely is it, for example, that the agency will be able to round up students earmarked for summary deportation? Isn't it more likely, on past record, that most will be here to a ripe old age? Then there is the monitoring. Last week immigration minister Damian Green said: \"Some 142 of 250 (57%) sampled records had attendance monitoring issues, which meant it was impossible for the university to know whether students were turning up for classes or not.\" But last year, inspectors from the Quality Assurance Agency for Higher Education specifically addressed that point. \"Advisers receive regular and comprehensive data to facilitate attendance,\" the inspection report said of London Met. It concluded that: \"Confidence can reasonably be placed in the soundness of the university's current and likely future management of the academic standards of its awards.\" Also in \"the soundness\" of the university's \"management of the quality of the learning opportunities available to students\". Didn't sound then like an institution in chaos and requiring the severest sanction. But summer came, and ministers needed a bone to throw to&#xa0;the right and the Mail.</p> <p>\u2022 A period in the spotlight for London Met, but then, it has never been backwards in coming forward. This was an email to staff from vice-chancellor <a href=\"http://www.londonmet.ac.uk/the-vice-chancellors-office/malcolm-gilles-vice-chancellor.cfm\" title=\"\">Malcolm Gillies</a> just last month. \"Once again this year, we have secured all the key advertising sites,\" he said. \"We will be on the front page of the Telegraph official Ucas listings, in the Evening Standard &amp; Metro, on the Ucas Clearing Homepage and in London schools and local radio. Ours will be the first email sent from Ucas to c 40,000 unplaced students in London.\" The London Met message went far and wide. Alas, it reached the Border Agency.</p> <p>\u2022 Finally, amid controversy about the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/sep/02/grant-shapps-google-howtocorp-adsense\" title=\"\">online business</a> run by the wife of housing minister Grant Shapps, some ask why they didn't see it coming.

  "<p>To use the word \"deportation\" regarding the consequences surrounding the loss of London Metropolitan University's sponsor licence (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/aug/31/foreign-students-editorial\" title=\"\">Editorial</a>, 1 September), instead of the more appropriate \"removal\", is wrong and unhelpful. Since 2000, a deportation order is issued in circumstances where it would be deemed in the public good or where the court recommends such action following conviction of an offence punishable with imprisonment. It therefore has much more serious consequences for the deportee, and such casual use of the terms is liable to cause panic among international students already in the UK as well as send out the wrong message to anyone considering the UK as a destination for study.<br><strong>Kay Bains</strong><br><em>Head of UK immigration, Mazars LLP</em></p> <p>\u2022 The UK Border Agency is hiding the scale of its failures behind sensational headlines. Damian Green is trying to create an illusion that he is tough on immigration by treating legal immigrants like illegal immigrants, and doing nothing about illegal immigration. By revoking the licence of the LMU he is punishing legitimate students, while bogus students will no doubt disappear and join the backlog of 150,000 cases reported earlier this year. The estimated cost of a forced removal is \u00a311,000 per migrant. With an estimated 150,000 individuals requiring removal, this will cost the UKBA \u00a31.65bn \u2013 much more than the entire UKBA budget.</p> <p>The processing times for visa renewals have increased steadily in recent months, and the UKBA is now taking almost six months to process postal applications from within the UK. The Border Agency needs more realistic targets, and should be more honest about its capacity. It is losing credibility with its current strategy.<br><strong>J van Zyl</strong><br><em>London</em></p> <p>\u2022 I am writing to raise my displeasure regarding the new UKBA rule forcing us legitimate international students to sign in twice a week, every week. I do understand that this is not the university's decision, but due to current UK immigration policies. However, to require students to sign in twice a week as if we are dangerous convicts is ridiculous.</p> <p>A person on the UK sex offenders register needs to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2006/jan/18/childrensservices.politics1\" title=\"\">register with the local police only once a year</a>; they are not required to show up twice a week every week, and sign in their \"attendance\" while being \"witnessed\" by a member of staff. It seems the current UK government views international students as worse than convicted paedophiles.</p> <p>As <a href=\"http://www.ukba.homeoffice.gov.uk/sitecontent/documents/aboutus/reports/pbs-tier-4/overseas-students-report.pdf?view=Binary\" title=\"\">UKBA itself has pointed out</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/jan/09/migrationwatch-bogus-foreign-students\" title=\"\">only 2% of international students are potentially non-compliant</a> (ie possible fraudulent cases). Disrupting 405,000 legitimate students twice a week, every week, to weed out 2% of potential fraud cases, is in my opinion a very unwise decision.</p> <p>Even if this move removes the 2% of fraudulent students, the government's inability to restrict EU migration means net immigration is unlikely to fall significantly. As its only other option is to \"squeeze non-EU migration as hard as it can\", <a href=\"http://www.newstatesman.com/blogs/politics/2012/08/how-immigration-cap-strangling-our-universities\" title=\"\">in the words of the New Statesman's George Eaton</a>, that means turning away thousands of potential international students while being disruptive to current ones. I urge all UK universities to work together and oppose this move.<br><strong>Mohd Ozeman</strong><br><em>Medicine student, Newcastle University</em></p>",
  "<p>Much has changed since the wannabe prime minister David Cameron pledged to give a third of his first government's jobs to women, thereby ending what he called the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2008/mar/02/women.gender\" title=\"\">\"scandalous under-representation\"</a> in parliament. Not least the fact that, once in Downing Street, he promptly appointed just five women to his 23-strong cabinet. There may be a female home secretary in Theresa May, but at 22%, the UK ranks 57th in terms of female parliamentary representation, according to the <a href=\"http://www.cfwd.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Centre for Women and&#xa0;Democracy</a>.</p> <p>Since the coalition came to power there has been the leaked internal memo about the Tories' \"problem with women\", the appointment of an unelected woman to give the feminine perspective to Number 10 and economic policies that see female unemployment at a 25-year high.</p> <p>Will Cameron make amends with his first major cabinet reshuffle, expected shortly? And, if so, how much will it matter? We ask several leading feminist thinkers:</p> <h2><strong>Natasha Walter <br>Author and director of Women for Refugee Women</strong><br></h2> <p>\"Clearly, the reshuffle gives the government an opportunity to put some more female faces into those rows of grey men. I'm sure that the women who have been mentioned as possible new ministers \u2013 from Jo Swinson to Claire Perry, Maria Miller to Helen Grant \u2013 will prove quite as competent and articulate as the men they replace. But will they be able to bring any commitment to greater equality and justice into this government? That would mean creating a change of direction rather than a change of personnel, and nobody is suggesting that is on the cards.\"</p> <h2><strong>Susie Orbach <br>Psychotherapist, writer&#xa0;and campaigner</strong><br></h2> <p>\"As every agency I can think of that helps women is being decimated by the coalition I'm not sure how much the reshuffle matters. The health service, work and education are at the forefront of the most appalling attacks by the coalition. They are not going to do the things that need to be done: raise the minimum wage, provide proper childcare, education and training. This is an ideological government and they use language to cover nefarious doings.</p> <p>\"I do feel strongly though that Lynne [Featherstone, equalities minister] should stay. She has taken body image to the UN and has also fought for gay marriage. I also think Jo Swinson [Liberal Democrat MP] should be moved in. Both have worked well together.\"</p> <h2><strong>Bea Campbell <br>Writer and campaigner </strong><br></h2> <p>\"It is important to have more women in cabinet because presence is important. Coalition leaders should know that the cabinet is woefully short of women, that it needs to be representative, and should get on with it and make it so. They won't of course.Coalition women MPs don't seem to understand the importance of the Equality Act \u2013 and the statutory duties to pay 'due regard' to equality in all policymaking - including the budget. We should hear no more about women ministers 'nagging', no more behaving like subordinates, and lamenting their lack of power. They've got more power than the rest of us. Coalition women MPs should be asking themselves: do they want to participate in the worst government for women since the second world war? They should make their government do something very straightforward: the right thing.</p> <h2><strong>Ceri Goddard <br>Head of Fawcett Society</strong><br></h2> <p>\"The reshuffle is a golden opportunity for the prime minister to boost the presence and influence of women in British politics. Ninety years after women first got the vote, the nation is run by a cabinet made up of more millionaires than women. Women are bearing the brunt of austerity measures in terms of cuts to benefits and services. If you're not at the table, you're on the menu. Other countries fare much better, even when it comes to cabinet-level posts \u2013 indeed, Sweden, Switzerland and France all have equal numbers of men and women in their cabinets. Why can't we?\"</p> <h2><strong>Holly Dustin<br>Director of the End Violence Against Women Coalition</strong></h2> <p>\"First and foremost we'd like to see more women in Cabinet and government to ensure that women's lives and experiences are better reflected in policy-making. There are some great women in both parties who deserve promotion such as Lib Dem Jo Swinson who has been a long time supporter of our campaign to end violence against women in the UK, as well as Margot James, Jane Ellison and Helen Grant on the Conservative backbenches who also speak out about this issue. Theresa May has long-championed work on violence against women and leads this as Home Secretary. It is difficult to see who else in Cabinet at present would do this if she were moved.\"</p> <h2><strong>Rowan Harvey <br>Women's Rights Advocacy Advisor, ActionAid UK</strong></h2> <p>\"No one could doubt that Andrew Mitchell [development secretary] has genuinely come to understand how central women are to development efforts. If he were to move on in the reshuffle, recent initiatives, including the 2012 London Summit on Family Planning, are hopefully part of a process that his successor will continue Central to this should be a scaling up by DFID DFID should also scaleas well as scaling up work to combat violence against women.\"</p> <h2><strong>Jenny Jones <br>Green party member of&#xa0;London Assembly</strong></h2> <p>\"A reshuffle is a chance for some bravery. It's time for even the Tories to acknowledge that women still don't have their fair share of jobs, power, or responsibility. Yet whether or not Lynne Featherstone, who has disappointed many feminists who wanted more gumption, is replaced with Jo Swinson who voted for raising the upper limit on university tuition fees despite advocating free education for most of her career, I'm not sure. Why not find the ideas first and then the right people to push them&#xa0;through? Even I, a lifelong feminist, could just about stomach a man as equalities minister, if he advocated and&#xa0;made happen the Norwegian law of&#xa0;40% quota for women on company boards.\"</p> <h2><strong>Julie Bindel <br>Writer and activist</strong><br></h2> <p>Lynne Featherstone, the most seniorLiberal Democrat woman, should be moved out of government by Cameron. Much as it pains me to say, the Lib Dems are worse than the Tories even when it comes to tackling violence against women and girls. Featherstone also toes the party line that decriminalizing prostitution would help to eliminate the abuse within the industry, despite evidence to the contrary from the Netherlands and elsewhere. I cannot think of one woman in either the Conservative or Lib Dem party who has any sense of how to promote equality for women, so would opt for Alistair Burt to do the job. From what I hear he has been good on tackling discrimination towards asylum seekers. It is a stark choice.</p>",
  "<p>I am standing on a woman's breast, looking up her nostrils. She lies immobile in the tough landscape, her soft curves criss-crossed by spiralling paths that resemble graphic lines as if Pablo Picasso had sketched a lolloping nude on a Gauloises packet and a team of guys with bulldozers copied out his drawing on a colossal scale.</p> <p>Nowadays buildings and sculptures that aspire to fame come with nicknames predevised by publicists. Just as the Shard likes to be known as \u2026 the Shard, Charles Jencks' huge earthwork Northumberlandia wants to be nicknamed the Lady of the North.</p> <p>It is a sprawling hill-sized nude that lies, modestly screened from the road by woodland, just outside Newcastle. I can't help wondering if the city that spawned the adult comic Viz might come up with other names for this carnal fantasy. The Nude of the North, the Nymph of the North \u2026 Sid the Sexist's favourite picnic site.</p> <p>Anyone who has ever wanted to clamber on a vast female form will enjoy this work of art. It's rollicking fun. At first you see a curvaceous landscape, a bit like the remains of some ancient hill fort preserved by English Heritage.</p> <p>Then as you head up one of the white paths that navigate what will, when the grass is fully grown, be a completely green constellation of orotund features, views open up of a superabundant body. Stand on Northumberlandia's head and you look down on her spiralling breasts, her splayed arms, her mountainous hips.</p> <p>Her nose is a massive earthen lump, her eyes and lips are made of stone. Her nipples are circular tiles. Yet unless you look from the air, these fragments of a picture can only be put together in the imagination as you walk around the dimpled eminence.</p> <p>This is why Northumberlandia works as art. The image of a colossal naked woman sketched out with blobby freedom on the landscape of south-eastern Northumberland may sound a bit tacky and crass, but it never resolves itself into a simple recognisable form when you are walking on and around it.</p> <p>Instead, the different vistas that open up of her head, her legs, her tummy form a mental picture that relates in a suggestive way to the curvaceous textures of heaped earth.</p> <p>Jencks is one of the founding figures of postmodern architecture, a powerful critic of what he saw in his influential writings in the 1970s as the aridity of modernist design. In recent years he has created a series of extravagant earthworks, primitivist works of art that recreate in pampered parks the mounds and ramparts of ancient fortifications and sculptures such as the ancient Serpent Mound in the US.</p> <p>Yet in this work he takes a big risk. His previous earthworks have been abstract and elegant. This is a full-on nude. A nude you climb. Is that absurd?</p> <p>It is terrific. This is no facile folly but a playful sculpture that celebrates the ancient human habit of seeing figures in the landscape. Jencks is not the first artist to equate the female form with rolling hills and meadows.</p> <p>In their collaborative 16th century painting Sleeping Venus, the Venetian artists Giorgione and Titian pictured a sensuous nude lying in a landscape whose rolling contours seem tailored to her anatomy. In the 20th century Max Ernst made a similar point when he revealed a woman's body in a landscape in his collage Le Jardin de France.</p> <p>Hills as bosoms, valleys as vaginas \u2013 Jencks evokes a rich mythology of the feminised Earth that has haunted ancient fertility cults and modern surrealists alike.</p> <p>Surrounded by calm lakes that like Northumberlandia herself have been salvaged from the mining works that eviscerate the Blagdob Estate of Viscount Ridley, this will surely become a popular picnic spot, and not just with sexist Viz characters. There's a slumberous dreamlike delicacy to this work of art that dares to proclaim the wonder of the human body, that fertile marvel.</p> <h2>Charles Jencks</h2> <p>It is almost impossible to give Charles Jencks one job title. He is an artist, a landscape designer, a polemicist, a modernist and postmodernist theorist and a writer of important and bestselling books on architecture. If that were not enough he is also the co-founder, with his late wife, of Maggie's cancer caring centres.</p> <p>Jencks, 73, was born in Baltimore, studied at Harvard and moved to the UK in the mid-1960s.</p> <p>He now lives in Scotland and is the writer of numerous books and essays on architecture including The Language of Postmodern Architecture and The Iconic Building \u2013 the Power of Enigma and The Garden of Cosmic Speculation.</p> <p>That last title reveals some of his central thoughts: that art and architecture exist to make us think about the cosmos; that there is always a bigger picture. In an <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2011/jun/22/charles-jencks-life-mounds-architecture?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">interview with the Guardian</a> last year he said: \"It's something people have done even before they built Stonehenge, so why not now?\"</p> <p>He added: \"I do believe architecture, and all art, should be content-driven. It should have something to say beyond the sensational. But, yes, the lack of culture in so much new architecture is worrying.\"</p> <p>His belief in the ability of buildings to uplift helped drive the creation of the network of Maggie's centres, named after his late wife, Maggie Keswick Jencks, who died in 1995.</p> <p>Jencks is a leading figure in landscape architecture and his flair for reflecting science in the landscape led to Cern, the particle physics laboratory in Geneva, asking him to work on its gardens.</p> <p>As well as Northumberlandia, Jencks has been busily working with the engineer Cecil Balmond on a landmark for Gretna on the England-Scotland border.

  "<p>Barack Obama needs to increase his appeal among Puerto Ricans living in the central zone of Florida if he is to win the crucial battleground state in the race to return him to the White House, in-house polls are indicating.</p> <p>The Obama for America re-election campaign is focusing its energies on what is increasingly seen by both Democrats and Republicans as a vital demographic target in a vital swing state. So much so that Team Obama is flying in senior politicians from Puerto Rico in an effort to mobilise undecided voters in the heavily populated I-4 corridor around Orlando.</p> <p>Internal polling figures that were released for the first time at a Hispanic caucus meeting at the Democratic National Convention in Charlotte on Monday show that Obama is only enjoying a relatively soft lead among Puerto Ricans in Florida. A survey conducted by the pollster Sergio Bendixen on behalf of the campaign at the end of July gave Obama a 54% to 32% advantage over Republican candidate Mitt Romney within this electoral demographic.</p> <p>Presenting the figures to the caucus, Bendixen said, \"We need to do better than that. We need to get that number up into the seventies. If we are to carry Florida we need to do better among Puerto Ricans in the Orlando area.\"</p> <p>The Hispanic vote has been identified by both main parties as an important factor within the 2012 presidential fight, and within that contest Florida is the undisputed highlight. That is partly a reflection of the fact that the state commands 29 of the 270 electoral college votes needed to win the presidency.</p> <p>But it is also a product of Florida's large and growing Hispanic population, which already accounts for more than a fifth of all voters in the state, as well as its highly diverse ethnic mix. Obama's internal polling shows that among Cubans in southern Florida he is trailing 38% to Romney's 56%, whereas among US-born Hispanic Floridians he is up 51% to 35%.</p> <p>Overall, Obama continues to command a lead among Floridian Latinos, but it is relatively close, at 51% for Obama and 37% for Romney. With 12% of the Latino population still undecided, there is still all to play for.</p> <p>Bendixen has carried out internal polling for the Obama campaign in two other key swing states with large Hispanic populations \u2013 Nevada and Colorado. Nevada comes out as the great Obama success story of 2012 so far \u2013 the president is enjoying a 56-point lead among Latinos there (by 74% to 18%).</p> <p>Between April this year to July, support among Nevadan Latinos surged an extraordinary 20 points, a measure of success that Obama for America has so far failed to replicate in Colorado. Though the president has a comfortable lead there too (69% to Romney's 21%), he only managed to achieve a four-point increase in Hispanic support in Colorado in the three months up to August.</p> <p>Bendixen told the assembled Hispanic caucus that every time he polled Latino voters in the swing state \u2013 on average once every two months \u2013 support for Obama was increasing. He put that down to a combination of the positive reception Obama's key policies have had among Latinos, and the increasingly negative opinion among them of Romney and the Republicans.</p> <p>Mainly Spanish-speaking Hispanics \u2013 first generation immigrants from Mexico and other Latino American countries \u2013 were showing a particularly robust response to Obama's bid for re-election. They polled in favour of him by a whopping 84% to 7% for Romney (by contrast Hispanics with English as their dominant language favoured Obama by 63% to 30%).</p> <p>Bendixen sees that in turn as a reflection of high levels of anxiety among first generation American Hispanics about healthcare and the immigration status of their loved ones. Both Obama's Affordable Care Act, which extends health coverage to millions of uninsured Americans, and his executive order to defer the threat of deportation from young Hispanic students have polled exceptionally well among Latino voters in the swing states.</p> <p>Fears about health insurance are especially pronounced among the Puerto Ricans in central Florida. Many of them were drawn to Florida by jobs at Disney World and other tourist attractions, but they are frequently paid the minimum wage without any health insurance.</p> <p>Obama for America has for several months been seeking to capitalise on that well of good feeling among Latinos by aggressively running Spanish-language TV adverts in Florida, Nevada, Colorado and other battleground states. The adverts, also produced by Bendixen, have focused on Obamacare and the president's executive order deferring deportations for young Hispanics.</p> <p>In another Spanish-language advert, the Obama campaign has sought to make hay over some of Romney's most controversial remarks on immigration, including his pledge, made in one of the primary TV debates, to force undocumented Hispanics to \"self-deport\" themselves.</p> <p>The Romney campaign has by contrast been slow off the mark, only recently beginning to broadcast TV ads in Spanish. Its first such advert was a soft focus interview with one of the candidate's sons saying what a good guy he was.</p> <p>\"The Republicans haven't done much to fight us for this crucial vote yet. They are only just getting into gear with advertising and messaging,\" Bendixen told the Democratic Hispanic caucus.</p> <p>One problem faced by Latino organisers canvassing for Obama among Puerto Ricans in central Florida is that there is what one called a \"leadership deficit\" there with few Puerto Rican politicians in positions of influence. To make up for it, the campaign has been bringing in leading politicians from Puerto Rico itself such as Kenneth McClintock, president of the US territory's state senate.</p> <p>The Republican party has similarly been seeking to cement its Puerto Rican credentials in Florida, putting the first lady of Puerto Rico, Luce Vela, on stage at its national convention in Tampa last week. The convention also highlighted Marco Rubio, the Hispanic senator for Florida.</p> <p>But Bendixen's figures show that Romney's favourability rating among Hispanics in Florida, Nevada and Colorado has slumped by 14 points (from 42% to 28%) in the three months up to August, while Obama's has increased from 60% to 65%.</p> <p>\"Romney has made self-inflicted wounds,\" Bendixen told the caucus. \"When he talks about auto-deportation people do not forget that as it reflects on the quality of life of all Hispanics, documented or undocumented.\"</p>",
  "<p>Like recalcitrant pupils bribed with the promise of a treat on the first day of term, MPs hurried back to Westminster after the summer break with less foot-dragging than usual. The tea room was crowded by mid-morning. You could see why. Apart from ministers about to be sacked in David Cameron's first unforced reshuffle, everyone was guaranteed some cruel laughter.</p> <p>Tory MPs arrived hoping that they or their chums would finally get that overdue promotion while the blood of their enemies \u2013 near-communists like Ken Clarke \u2013 would flow down the gutters like puke after a teenage party. Labour could look forward to abusing the unstoppable Michael Gove for this year's botched GCSE results. As for Lib Dems, simply by suggesting that Nick Clegg pass the leadership torch to a new generation (Vince Cable), obscure MPs could get their name into a rightwing newspaper. Assorted nationalists could jeer at them all.</p> <p>Bliss! Could it get any better? It could and it did. Gove grandly swept aside all criticisms of his own role in shifting the GCSE goalposts. It would be quite wrong for ministers to meddle with exam results, let alone with the regulator, he piously insisted. On a quite separate matter the education secretary confirmed that it would soon become easier to sack bad teachers \u2013 or \"underperforming staff\", as he chose to put it.</p> <p>Downing Street could not have expressed it better. Which of headmaster Cameron's underperforming staff were making their last ministerial appearances on Monday \u2013 and which backbench thruster making a final \"look at me\" display of ultra-loyalty will be rewarded with a job by teatime on Tuesday?</p> <p>The genial literature buff John Hayes, the lifelong learning minister, is tipped for the chop by that shadowy Westminster figure, the Great Mentioner, who peddles gossip in reporters' ears at reshuffle time. If so Hayes's last words to Hansard will have been to quote Marcel Proust to the effect that \"we must not receive [wisdom], we must <em>discover</em> after a journey\". It is the minister's flowery way of promoting apprenticeships; not so much Swann's Way as Swan Hunters.</p> <p>Will Hayes be ministerial dust by Tuesday night? Or will the Proust wing of the Tory party (not as influential as it was) save his skin? Will Damian Green, the too-civilised immigration minister who followed Gove into the dock, survive the cull?</p> <p>As he defended the Home Office's latest mini-shamble, London Metropolitan University's withdrawn licence to recruit foreign students, Green gave as good as he got in the face of Labour humbug. But he was polite. Is that good enough?</p> <p>And those late job applications \u2013 conspicuously unctuous questions from Michael Fallon, from Matt Hancock and little Robert Halfon \u2013 will they carry them over the wannabe line? Will one of them be proud under-secretary for Post-it notes by nightfall? Battle-scarred Labour MPs can barely conceal their amazement that Cameron did not do his reshuffle in late July so that the fallen could get over it \u2013 and the new ministers find their feet \u2013 by September. For them this reshuffle will keep on giving.</p> <p>Until it does there is Clegg. Back in late July, when he announced that Lords reform had been found stabbed in a corridor, he swore revenge on both Labour and the Tories for the crime and promised to report progress when MPs came back from the beach. Good as his word, Clegg duly made a statement, one which invited guffaws from opponents of Lords reform, dismay at his lack of courage from genuine reformers and crocodile tears from the Labour frontbench. It always favours reform but never the one on offer.</p> <p>It can't have been much fun. But Clegg did better than usual. There was a jaunty irony in his tone as if he knew he had been suckered and decided not to mind. In Clegg's search for an authentic public voice this was progress. No, I won't myself be taking an undemocratic peerage (\"Call me old-fashioned, but \u2026\"), he assured Dennis Skinner. Someone else reminded him of rival plans to make peers retire. You can retire a few of mine, Clegg replied.</p> <p>What can he mean, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/aug/30/lib-dems-nick-clegg-peer?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">Lord Oakeshott</a>?</p>",
  "<p>The Democratic national convention in Charlotte culminates with Barack Obama's acceptance speech on Thursday night. Before then, the convention will feature a mix of fresh and familiar faces. Here are six worth watching:</p> <h2>Julian Castro: the rising star</h2> <p><strong>Why he is there:</strong> appeals to crucial Latino voters in swing states</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395602326\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2012/9/3/1346686134224/Julian-Castro-004.jpg\" alt=\"Julian Castro\" width=\"220\" height=\"132\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Julian Castro.

The Emmy-winning actor is the daughter of a Mexican American family that lived in Texas long before it was subsumed by the US. Longoria has spoken out in favour of liberal immigration reform, and against the draconian anti-immigrant laws enacted in Arizona.</p> <h2>Elizabeth Warren: the liberal lion</h2> <p><strong>Why:</strong> support for grassroots favourite in critical election battle</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395602328\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2012/9/3/1346686021951/Elizabeth-Warren-004.jpg\" alt=\"Elizabeth Warren\" width=\"220\" height=\"132\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Elizabeth Warren.

Warren's calls to restore sanity to the financial system and stiffer regulations for Wall Street saw her passed over as head of the new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. But she bounced back by winning the Democratic nomination to contest the US Senate seat in Massachusetts held by Republican Scott Brown.</p> <h2>Bill Clinton: the political rock star</h2> <p><strong>Why:</strong> erstwhile opponent turned trusted ally able to woo independent voters</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395602329\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2012/9/3/1346686320062/Bill-Clinton-and-Barack-O-004.jpg\" alt=\"Bill Clinton and Barack Obama\" width=\"220\" height=\"132\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bill Clinton and Barack Obama.

After Republicans in Congress barred Fluke from speaking at a hearing on contraception and healthcare reform, Democrats invited her to a high-profile event. That aroused the fury of talkshow host Limbaugh, who attacked the law student as a \"slut\" and \"prostitute\". The ensuing outrage cost Limbaugh an apology and a string of dropped advertisers, and made Fluke into a national figure.</p> <h2>Martin O'Malley: the 2016 hopeful</h2> <p><strong>Why:</strong> popular state governor as high-profile party leader</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395602331\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2012/9/3/1346693491968/Martin-OMalley-004.jpg\" alt=\"Martin O'Malley\" width=\"220\" height=\"132\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Martin O'Malley.

Hillary Clinton's job as secretary of state keeps her away from Charlotte, but Martin O'Malley, the governor of Maryland, is in the front-rank of candidates if she decides not to run. O'Malley made his name as a crusading mayor of Baltimore and in 2006 ousted the Republican incumbent as governor. He comfortably won re-election in 2010 in an otherwise tough year for Democrats, and boasts liberal stances on gay marriage and taxation.</p>",
  "<p>Two universities had their licenses to admit overseas students temporarily suspended after the UK Border Agency discovered problems with the enforcement of visa rules, ministers have said.</p> <p>London Metropolitan University was stripped of its highly trusted sponsor status last week after checks by UKBA found breaches of visa rules. Audits found that of a sample of 101 overseas students at London Met, a quarter had no leave to remain in the UK.</p> <p>UKBA carried out a further sample check of 600 overseas students at London Met, which found problems in 60% of cases, MPs were told.</p> <p>Speaking in the Commons in response to an urgent question about London Met, the immigration minister Damian Green said that both of the other institutions had resolved their problems and were no longer suspended.</p> <p>The minister said London Met's case was more serious. He said: \"UKBA found systemic failures which meant that London Met had not been able to ensure the appropriate admission and tracking of students from abroad.\"</p> <p>Allowing London Met to continue awarding visas would have undermined the visa regime, Green added.</p> <p>\"Institutions must comply with the rules, whether they sponsor 10, 100 or 1,000 international students. This includes having a system to check that students have the right visas to study in the UK and monitoring the attendance of students,\" the minister told MPs.</p> <p>\"Education providers have to meet strict standards ensuring they provide high quality education and take their immigration responsibilities seriously.\"</p> <p>Officials will start writing to affected students on 1 October, giving them 60 days to leave the UK or find another university to complete their studies. The decision leaves 2,700 foreign students at London Met facing deportation.</p> <p>The government accused the university of \"failing to address serious and systemic failings\" identified six months ago.</p> <p>Labour MP Jeremy Corbyn, who tabled the Commons question, said the London Met decision would deter foreign students from studying in the UK.</p> <p>\"The image around the world is one that is really quite appalling because it suggests that overseas students may well be deported from this country because of a decision made by UKBA for which there is no detail given as to the basis of that decision.</p> <p>\"Every university in this country has cause to be concerned by this decision from UKBA.\"</p> <p>Shadow immigration minister Chris Bryant said Labour supported the crackdown on bogus courses but warned the government needed to support legitimate students.</p> <p>He said: \"We need to foster an international reputation for high value education, not undermine it.</p> <p>\"The government has acted at the most disruptive time of year in the most disruptive way - yet more ministerial incompetence. Legitimate international students bring in \u00a33.3bn in to this country's economy.\"</p> <p>The Liberal Democrats also criticised the move. Mike Crockart, MP for Edinburgh West, accused UKBA of \"heavy-handed, rhetoric-induced action\".</p> <p>But Green said the decision to act against London Met was the \"opposite of rhetoric\". He said: \"Instead of years of immigration ministers from the previous government talking tough and acting weak, we now have a government that is acting tough as well.\"</p>",

Three months from now, the young Syrian mother will give birth again, this time in circumstances that are less life-threatening but characterised by destitution, misery and choking swirls of sand in a relentless wind.</p> <p>Home for Abu Zaid, 29, her husband and their four young children \u2013 and thousands of other refugees from the violence in Syria \u2013 is now a desert tent city in northern Jordan. Days are dominated by a wearying and unwinnable battle to keep the sand at bay and the fear of losing a child among the near-identical rows of flapping tents and thousands of displaced youngsters.</p> <p>But at least the Abu Zaids have escaped the horrors of Dael, north of Deraa. They left the town around six weeks ago, part of a stream of people fleeing across the border to Jordan. In the past week or two, that stream has become a river of desperate humanity: mainly women and children, moving under the cover of darkness, clutching only their fear, each other's hands and the odd plastic bag of possessions.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395595099\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/maps_and_graphs/2012/9/3/1346688946261/Syrian-refugees-001.png\" alt=\"Syrian refugees\" width=\"460\" height=\"455\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Syrian refugees Photograph: Graphic</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Graphic</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Zataari refugee camp, opened by the Jordanian government at the end of July to house 500 people, has swollen to a population of more than 26,000. Two-thirds of them are children, of whom around 5,000 are under the age of four. Five hundred are \"unaccompanied minors\" \u2013 youngsters who made the perilous journey without their parents, and who are now dealing with the pain of separation along with new privations and the traumas they left behind.</p> <p>Official expectations are that Jordan's refugee population will grow by up to 10,000 a week. The Jordanian government says there are a further 140,000 Syrian refugees crammed into towns and villages close to the border. Turkey, Lebanon and Iraq have also seen huge influxes of refugees, with thousands more still trying to leave Syria.</p> <p>At Zataari, conditions are wretched despite sterling efforts by humanitarian organisations. Sand and dust whipped up by the wind sweeping across the nine-square-kilometre site cause respiratory problems. Newly erected tents are swiftly coated in a layer of sand, turning their colour from white to brown within a day or two. Sand is in children's hair, eyebrows, eyelashes, under fingernails; eyes are rimmed red; voices hoarse.</p> <p>Only 40% of the camp has electricity. There is one latrine per 50 refugees. For now, the desert sun beats down on the exposed ground for 12 hours a day, but within weeks night temperatures will plummet and winter will bring driving rain and freezing winds.</p> <p>The Jordanian army maintains a heavy presence inside and outside the camp. Refugees are not allowed to leave without special permits. Less than two weeks ago, a protest by camp inmates over conditions and frustration at the tight security was quelled by teargas fired by soldiers.</p> <p>Bulldozers, earth movers, water tankers, delivery and garbage trucks rumble continuously through the camp's entrance, a serious hazard to hundreds of people milling around aimlessly. The United Nations agency for refugees, UNHCR, acknowledges the camp's problems but insists the priority is to get infrastructure in place for the existing population and the refugees expected in the coming days and weeks.</p> <p>The high proportion of children in the camp presents particular challenges. \"Many children coming across [the border] are traumatised and some are injured,\" says Pip Leighton of the UN children's agency, Unicef. \"There is huge psychological stress. Many of them have seen things that no adult should see, let alone a child.\"</p> <p>Agencies such as Unicef and Save the Children are offering specialist counselling and therapeutic activities. \"These kids are telling stories that are pretty frightening,\" says Hedinn Halldorsson of Save the Children. \"Some have been in hiding for months. Many are waking in the night, crying. Some children are panicking when they hear the planes [from a nearby Jordanian military base] overhead.\"</p> <p>In many cases, fathers have stayed behind in Syria in the hope of protecting property and caring for livestock. \"Separation is traumatic,\" says Halldorsson.</p> <p>Humanitarian agencies have set up designated play areas, and are working on establishing schools within the camp. \"But some days we do nothing but help parents search for lost children,\" says Rae McGrath of Save the Children.</p> <p>Abu Zaid says that, whatever the problems of the camp, it is better than what the family left behind. \"I was very afraid \u2013 the shelling was all around us. All the time the children were terrified and not sleeping,\" she says. \"This is not how we are used to living. We're adjusting. But the children have started playing again. At home, they were locked inside the house.\"</p> <p>Miriam, 11, who has been at Zataari for two weeks after fleeing from Sawara with her mother and five siblings, says she has no idea how long the family will stay. Her father stayed behind to take care of the family's cows. \"I'm worried about him,\" she says.</p> <p>Abed, 12, from Deraa, was smuggled through the mountains at night with his mother, three brothers and four sisters. \"I was scared,\" he says, but adds: \"Here we feel safe.\"</p> <p>Most of the refugees cross the border east of the official \u2013 but now closed \u2013 crossing at the town of Ramtha. The nightly numbers hit a peak of 3,300 last week; a subsequent drop is attributed to the period of a full moon.</p> <p>Most of the women and children are smuggled under the protection of rebels; some men bring their families and then return to Syria. The refugees are brought in buses to the camp, usually arriving while it is still dark. After registration and a meal, families wait to be allocated a tent.</p> <p>\"We're all just about keeping ahead of the problem,\" says Leighton. \"But if there was a massive influx, we would have significant challenges.\"</p>",

A young Ugandan entrepreneur, Vincent Biyara, had been our guide as we struggled to the top. It was from here that he described the development he wanted to see in the Karagutu valley that tumbled before us. It was a vision of enterprise: a community able to utilise its natural assets to establish agricultural and tourist businesses that would create jobs and enable the community to prosper.</p> <p>There is now widespread recognition in the development community that poverty cannot be defeated without stimulating enterprise and achieving inclusive economic growth. This is especially important when you consider that six out of the top 10 fastest growing economies are in Africa: Uganda, for example, is one of the fastest growing non-oil producing countries in the world. Growth alone is not enough; it must be harnessed to ensure the resulting job creation, development of management capacity and the transfer of technology benefit the poorest. This will require NGOs, businesses and governments to collaborate in new ways to provide greater opportunity for the next generation of entrepreneurs, to ensure that the benefits of growth are not just shared with the poorest but are generated by the poorest.</p> <p>This won't happen by accident. Starting your own business is difficult in any context; if you are from somewhere like Karagutu, the challenges are multiplied. That is why <a href=\"http://www.vso.org.uk/\" title=\"\">VSO</a> has developed an innovative partnership with <a href=\"http://www.benjerry.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Ben &amp; Jerry's</a>, who source fair trade vanilla for their ice-cream from Western Uganda. Together, we are combining Ben &amp; Jerry's experience of doing business in Uganda with VSO's knowledge of local communities to support fledgling enterprises \u2013 from an eco-tourism initiative to a briquette business.</p> <p>We brought together 15 young entrepreneurs from Europe, who all had experience of setting up a businesses to address a social issue, to work with 15 Ugandan counterparts. Their task was to answer a single question: how can we accelerate the building of enterprises that are commercially viable and also create prosperity for poor communities?</p> <p>The process highlighted three key obstacles that stand in the way of enterprise flourishing in Uganda and across Africa. These are the challenges of capital, capacity and corruption.</p> <p>No business can succeed without capital to invest in an idea or take it to scale. In much of Africa, that capital is a very scarce resource. Across the world, only 1% of global capital markets are invested in Africa. That is a scandalous disadvantage to Africa's entrepreneurs. For example, one entrepreneur I met in Uganda described his difficulty in finding an investor to help him purchase new technology that would allow him to fuel a cotton factory through biomass technology instead of using thousands of gallons of diesel per month. The savings on fuel would enable the 30,000 local farmers who supply the factory with cotton to get higher prices for their products. And yet the investment for the technology is not forthcoming.</p> <p>NGOs have both reach and local knowledge that is often invisible to commercial capital markets. VSO, for example, is working on strengthening livelihoods with 275 local partners in 18 countries. Despite the much-needed emergence of online lending sites such as <a href=\"http://www.kiva.org/\" title=\"\">Kiva</a> and the launching of some innovative social impact funds, NGOs' role in linking opportunity to capital is still nascent and remains a fundamental challenge.</p> <p>Second is the challenge of capacity. Investment flows to Africa will be inhibited unless there is confidence in the management capacity of those who are entrusted to use that investment to return a dividend. One potential investor told me \"I don't invest in ideas; I invest in management teams who can execute on a plan.\"</p> <p>It's in the area of people that organisations like VSO and our partners such as <a href=\"https://www.ashoka.org/\" title=\"\">Ashoka</a> are ideally placed to play a proactive role. Volunteers with the right expertise and knowledge can act as a catalyst and build the capacity of African entrepreneurs to compete effectively. Our <a href=\"http://www.accenture.com/us-en/company/citizenship/Pages/voluntary-services-overseas.aspx\" title=\"\">Making Markets Work for the Poor </a>partnership with <a href=\"http://www.accenture.com/gb-en/Pages/index.aspx\" title=\"\">Accenture </a>over the last 10 years has focused on just that: using its commercial expertise to help analyse value chains and support poor communities to access them better.</p> <p>Finally, there is the threat of corruption. Studies by economists such as <a href=\"http://www.milkeninstitute.org/about/about.taf?function=detail&amp;Level1=ProStaff&amp;Level2=Bio&amp;ID=32&amp;cat=Staff\" title=\"\">Joel Kurtzman</a> have demonstrated that there is a clear correlation between levels of opacity (the degree of easily discernible and transparent business governing practices) and levels of per capita income. If one falls, the other falls with it. Corruption was cited as a death nail by the Ugandan entrepreneurs we worked with, increasing the cost of vital products and eating into already slim margins. A strong and vibrant civil society is a prerequisite for exposing and confronting corruption, and NGOs' contribution is a vital part of work to create an enabling environment for trade and enterprise.</p> <p>Working on enterprise-based approaches to development is still new ground for many NGOs. For some, it doesn't sound like the sort of activity NGOs should be engaging in. But what this visit to Uganda made clear to me was that enabling people like Vincent to realise his vision for Karagutu is exactly what we should be doing.</p> <p><em>Mark Rowland is the head of fundraising and partnerships for <a href=\"http://www.vso.org.uk/\">VSO</a> and has spent the last 15 years working for a range of international development agencies.</em></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by </strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/guardian-professional\" title=\"Guardian Professional\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

  "<p>If the financial crisis put an end to the golden age of company takeovers, no one bothered to tell the beer industry \u2013 the world's biggest breweries continue to have an insatiable thirst for empire expansion.</p> <p>Heineken has just taken a big step towards completing the latest money-spinning deal as it gained the approval it needs to buy Asia Pacific Breweries, makers of Tiger beer, for up to \u00a34.1bn. It comes two years after it bought Femsa Cerveza, makers of Sol beer, in Mexico for $7.6bn (\u00a34.8bn).</p> <p>The Dutch brewer is not alone \u2013 last year rival SABMiller, which makes Peroni and Grolsch and Pilsner Urquell among others \u2013 snapped up Foster's for a cool \u00a37.5bn.</p> <p>And in 2008 a \u00a333bn merger created the world's biggest brewer by putting together Anheuser-Busch and InBev \u2013 a megadeal that united Budweiser, Beck's, Stella Artois and Hoegaarden.</p> <p>Heineken's new-found taste for Asian and Mexican beer is not hard to understand.

Only last week SABMiller opened a multimillion-pound brewery in Nigeria.</p> <p>But the biggest cash cow, as in so many industries, could be in China, where the popularity of beer has increased rapidly alongside the traditional desire for spirits. The country already accounts for one in four pints sold worldwide, double that of the US, and could account for 40% of total worldwide sales by 2016.</p> <p>Twenty years ago the Chinese barely touched beer, drinking an average of just 12 pints per person each year. By 2001 that consumption had nearly trebled to 32 pints; last year it was 63. By 2021 the number of pints consumer per head is expected to increase to 93.</p> <p>Ian Shackleton, from Japanese bank Nomura, said recently: \"Historically, China has had a strong 'spirits culture', with consumption skewed towards the Chinese traditional spirit baijiu. Beer, as a proportion of total alcohol, increased from 21% in 1997 to 51% in 2011, with the beer category growing at the expense of local, cheap spirits.\"</p> <p>AB InBev is expected to generate 6% of its group profits by 2021 from China, compared with just 1% last year, while SABMiller \u2013 which owns a 50% stake in China's most popular beer, Snow \u2013 will take 19% of its profits from the country. It currently takes 2%.</p> <p>The Heineken deal for Asia Pacific Breweries is important enough that the Dutch firm has increased its initial offer to buy out its joint venture partner Fraser and Neave (F&amp;N), after ThaiBev's billionaire owner, Charoen Sirivadhanabhakdi, made a counter bid.</p> <p>Heineken and F&amp;N formed a partnership in 1931 and jointly control a majority stake in Singapore-based Asia Pacific. The&#xa0;Dutch brewer wants to buy out F&amp;N's&#xa0;40% stake to increase its far east business interests and eventually take full control of the company. It currently has a 42% stake.</p> <p>An offer of S$53 (\u00a326) a share has been approved by F&amp;N's board and will be put to shareholders. However, 40% of those shareholders are rivals ThaiBev and Kirin, with the latter already trying to derail the bid by offering S$55 a share, causing Heineken to increase its initial S$50 a share bid.</p> <p>ThaiBev \u2013 maker of Chang beer \u2013 knows how important the deal is for Heineken, which needs the new markets to reduce its reliance on a poor-performing European region.</p> <p>Analyst John Mullane, from Dolmen Stockbrokers, explained: \"This deal is a positive development for Heineken because they have been overexposed in a weak European market, and behind the curve in exploiting growth opportunities in emerging markets.</p> <p>\"The fact they are willing to pay such a high premium shows how keen they are to expand in these markets and how important it is for them.\"</p> <p>Alcoholic drinks analyst at Euromonitor International, Zsuzsa Szilagyi, agreed.</p> <p>She said: \"There are very few targets left to acquire, which is why it is very important for Heineken, because it doesn't have its own presence in the region.</p> <p>\"The leading players are building their presence very smartly. There is sluggish growth in mature markets at the moment, so companies have to find growth prospects elsewhere.\"</p> <p>Despite their fast-growing appetite for beer, Chinese and African drinkers do have some catching up to do if they are to drink their European counterparts under the table. Admittedly, the Chinese do have some catching up to do if they are to be anywhere near the same league for drinking compared to their European counterparts.</p> <p>In terms of consumption per person, nine of the top 10 nations are in Europe \u2013 and the 10th is Australia.</p> <p>Topping the list is the Czech Republic, where an unnerving 244 pints are drunk each year on average by individuals. Ireland comes second with 195, followed by Germany with 186 pints.</p> <p>But drinking habits in Europe are changing. John Mullane from Dolmen said: \"Consumers are becoming more discerning and want higher quality and craft beers. Big breweries are recognising this and are likely to be looking at craft beers for expansion.\"</p> <p>In the US, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2011/jun/24/american-craft-beer-hippest-hops\" title=\"\">sales of craft beers</a> brewed usually by independent breweries on very small scales, have had double digit percentage increases, with Europe catching up.</p> <p>James Watt, co-founder of the Scottish craft beer firm <a href=\"http://www.brewdog.com/about\" title=\"\">BrewDog</a>, said companies such as his are tapping into an area that drinkers feel has been missing.</p> <p>He said: \"I think there has been a lack of choice in the UK for the last 30 to 40 years from industrial beers from monolithic brewers and we're trying to fill that gap.</p> <p>\"There has been an explosion in craft beers in the US and I think that will happen over here. People want to know how their beer is made and what's gone into it.\"</p> <p>But Watt is clear that Aberdeenshire-based BrewDog, which was started in 2007 and now has more than 60 employees and a turnover of \u00a312m, is not for sale. \"I'd sooner shoot myself in the head than sell to the big breweries. It would be like the Clash selling out to the Spice Girls.\"</p> <p>However, it won't stop the likes of Heineken, SABMiller and AB InBev continuing to reshape the beer-brewing landscape and with combined revenues of nearly \u00a350bn a year don't expect them to stop spending any time soon.</p>",
  "<p>Britain has assured Ecuador that Julian Assange has a double guarantee that he cannot face extradition from Sweden to the US if he were to face the death penalty or his human rights were to be breached.</p> <p>In a written statement to MPs, the foreign secretary, William Hague, said it was a \"matter of regret\" that the government of Ecuador had decided to offer asylum to Assange after Britain offered a series of assurances to Quito.</p> <p>Britain is seeking to extradite Assange to Sweden, where he faces allegations of sexual misconduct. The WikiLeaks founder, who sought protection in the Ecuadorean embassy in London in June, has been granted asylum by Quito on the grounds that he could face extradition from Sweden to the US where, it is feared, he could face the death penalty for his role in publishing hundreds of thousands of leaked US government documents.</p> <p>Hague told MPs the double guarantee meant Assange could only be extradited to the US from Sweden if both Britain and Sweden believed he would not face the death penalty and his human rights would not be breached.</p> <p>The foreign secretary said: \"Both the United Kingdom and Sweden are signatories to the European convention on human rights and the British government has complete confidence in the independence and fairness of the Swedish judicial system. As we have discussed with the government of Ecuador, the United Kingdom and Sweden robustly implement and adhere to the highest standards of human rights protection.</p> <p>\"The suggestion that Mr Assange's human rights would be put at risk by the possibility of onward extradition from Sweden to a third country is also without foundation. Not only would Sweden \u2013 as a signatory to the European convention on human rights \u2013 be required to refuse extradition in circumstances which would breach his human rights, but the authorities in Sweden would also be legally obliged to seek the United Kingdom's consent before any extradition to a non-EU member state could proceed.</p> <p>\"Our consent may only be given in accordance with the international conventions by which the UK is bound, including the European convention on human rights, and also our domestic law. In practice, this means that the United Kingdom could only consent to Mr Assange's onward extradition from Sweden to a third country if satisfied that extradition would be compatible with his human rights, and that there was no prospect of a death sentence being imposed or carried out.\"</p> <p>The foreign secretary expressed disappointment that Ecuador decided to grant asylum to Assange after officials had explained the guarantees to Quito in detail.</p> <p>\"It is a matter of regret that instead of continuing our discussions, the foreign minister of Ecuador announced on 16 August that Ecuador had decided to grant diplomatic asylum to Mr Assange&#xa0;\u2026 We wish to continue our dialogue with the government of Ecuador. We believe that our two countries should be able to find a diplomatic solution. We have invited the government of Ecuador to resume, as early as possible, the discussions we have held on this matter to date.\"</p> <p>In his statement, Hague did not repeat his warning to Ecuador last month that Britain could invoke the Diplomatic and Consular Premises Act 1987 to arrest Assange inside the embassy.</p> <p>Hague simply told MPs: \"Throughout our exchanges, we have noted that the rights of diplomatic missions conferred by the 1961 Vienna convention on diplomatic relations come with responsibilities. Article 41 of the Vienna convention sets out the obligations of diplomatic missions to respect the laws and regulations of the receiving state \u2013 in this case the United Kingdom. These include the duty not to impede the due legal process of that state.\"</p>",
  "<p>One of the greatest difficulties in the field of sustainability is helping consumers to recognise how their purchasing habits can exacerbate key problems such as poverty and climate change.</p> <p>The challenge is particularly acute when people buy products that have been grown or manufactured by communities thousands of miles away, and with whom they have no connection.</p> <p>I recognise that for myself, even though I am immersed in sustainability. When I buy Fairtrade products, I do it because I think it's the right thing to do but I don't actually feel the difference it could make to the lives of real people.</p> <p>That has all changed after a recent visit to a group of vanilla farmers in south-west Uganda.</p> <p>The personal experience of staying in the farming community of Karagutu for three nights and seeing how their lives have been transformed by Fairtrade, has brought the issue up close and personal.</p> <p>I came away with a stronger sense that buying non-Fairtrade products is exploitative. I will now be even more conscious about what I buy and relate it to the impact that it might have on the ground. The experience in Uganda was therefore a timely reminder that there are many different ways of knowing, and that what generally leads to lasting change is something that resonates on a deep emotional level.</p> <p>I see in other parts of my life that when my actions are infused with meaning, I tend not only to be happier and more effective, but also I don't go back to negative behaviour so easily.</p> <p>Returning home and watching peoples' shopping habits also reminded me just how zombie-like most of us are when we walk up and down supermarket aisles, tossing products in our trolleys, often with other things on our mind.</p> <p>What can help connect people are stories, and the tale of vanilla pods in general, and the Rwenzori region of Uganda in particular, is worth telling.</p> <p>When it comes to vanilla, I have always had a vague sense that it is overpriced, but seeing the enormous amount of work involved in growing and processing it, I now know that is far from the truth.</p> <p>Vanilla vines, which are part of the orchid family, need large amounts of tender loving care in training, pruning and mulching. Every flower has to be hand-pollinated within 24 hours of blossoming if they are to form a pod. Once fully grown, they need to be cured by hand in the sun for between three to six months.</p> <p>So you can imagine how the local farmers felt when several years ago world prices collapsed. Not only was their income devastated but they felt they had no alternative but to destroy the vines, which take around five to seven years to mature from seedlings, to make way for other crops.</p> <p>Fortunately, it was at this time that Oxfordshire furniture maker Lulu Sturdy stepped in with a plan to support the growers. She became involved because a 400 hectare (1,000 acre) estate in Rwenzori, which had been confiscated from her grandfather by Idi Amin, was returned to the family after president Museveni came to power in 1986.</p> <p>Sturdy decided that Fairtrade was the answer and now sells certified vanilla pods, essence and powder sourced from around 1,000 farmers in the area, under her own <a href=\"http://www.ndali.net/\" title=\"\">Ndali</a> brand, to Tesco and Waitrose, as well in bulk to major companies such as Ben &amp; Jerry's ice-cream.</p> <p>Fairtrade has helped to transform the farmers' economic viability. They now get a guaranteed $5.1 per kilo, compared with $2.3 for non-Fairtrade vanilla and the $1 they would get if they were sold in the local market. Converting all the farms to organic raises the price again to $5.6.</p> <p>But those are just numbers. What that means in practice is that the farmers can build homes that are not just made of mud and straw, and can afford to eat and send their children to school; everything we take for granted.</p> <p>On top of the individual farmers benefitting, the communities also receive a premium for each kilo sold, which has contributed to the creation of a number of income generating projects, such as the opening of a pharmacy store.</p> <p>Joseph Mbusa, chairman of MVFA, the farmers' umbrella group, said: \"Fairtrade is what we are looking for, not donations, because with donations the impacts do not reach the farmer on the ground.</p> <p>He added: \"As soon as you have something more, your status improves, and the farmers feel they have more pride in their work and are more committed to farming. The numerous credit organisations and savings co-ops that have been formed also have the effect of binding the communities and helping them to realise the importance of working together.\"</p> <p>Innovative grants from the Department for International Development (DFID) have also helped, by match-funding a new purpose-built machine for Ndali that can make vanilla powder, and supporting the development of new packaging for Tesco and Waitrose that can promote the fact the vanilla is now organic.</p> <p>That's the good news. But the story is not all positive and the ending, like many in Africa, is uncertain.</p> <p>Despite all Ndali's crop of 60 tonnes of vanilla being Fairtrade and organic, more than half has to be sold off at the price of $2.3 per kilo because not enough Fairtrade buyers can be found.</p> <p>Worse still, climate change is making it increasingly difficult to rely on consistently good weather for the drying process, and the Ndali processing plant has no access to electricity. Last year, half the crop was ruined because of this. If that continues and no affordable solution is found, then the business is at risk.</p> <p>Also, there is something in me that wishes it were a Ugandan entrepreneur behind Ndali's success rather an Englishwoman with networking access to developed markets. That is not to deny her great achievements.</p> <p>What the country really needs is to develop its own entrepreneurs. That is starting to happen in the cities, but also needs to be encouraged in rural areas. Mbusa is hopeful of this happening and talks of using some of their premium funds to develop their own processing plant for vanilla, cocoa and coffee to keep more of the profits within the local community.</p> <p>Beyond this, Sturdy's team and Mbusa complain that the cost of Fairtrade membership, combined with its overly bureaucratic practices, mean that small groups of farmers, who are often only semi-literate, don't have the opportunity to join the movement. In fact, Ndali looks after the paperwork for all the hundreds of farmers it works with.</p> <p>From a personal perspective, I benefitted greatly from the trip, but came away from Uganda wondering how best to deeply connect the billions of consumers in the so-called developed world to the consequences of their actions.</p> <p>I have not come up with any scalable answers, and therefore join the many others who are struggling with the same quandary.</p> <p>Individuals are motivated by so many different factors, and their lives are often so busy and challenging, that there does not seem to be an easy solution.</p> <p>For that reason, I turn to you to ask what ideas you have that may be effective in forging deeper relationships between individual consumers and global markets?</p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by </strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/guardian-professional\" title=\"Guardian Professional\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

  "<p>She wasn't supposed to turn up until the Christmas special but thanks to a surprise appearance in Saturday's episode, we have already had our first look at Doctor Who's new companion played by Jenna-Louise Coleman. There she was right after the opening titles, with Oswin \u2013 wasn't she going to be called Clara? \u2013 wrecking a souffle a year after her starliner had careered into the side of the Dalek asylum planet. Or so it seemed. In truth, Oswin was a Dalek all along.</p> <p>In terms of intrigue, Coleman's introduction couldn't be faulted. Nobody, unless they went out of their way to wrestle spoilers out of the internet, was expecting to see her this early \u2013 let alone looking so Daleky. Her journey from armoured alien to fully fledged Doctor's companion could be one of the most memorable in the show's history, if played correctly.</p> <p>But in terms of character, the jury's still out. If Asylum of the Daleks was anything to go by, Oswin threatens to hover on the wrong side of irritating. On and on, she babbled, about herself and her bakery and her bisexuality and the Doctor's chin and any other subject that happened to ambiently float into her brain, all at a trillion miles an hour.</p> <p>She's the sort of person who'd quickly make you fantasise about driving a steak knife through your hand if you ever found yourself seated next to her at dinner. Perhaps someone turned her into a Dalek because they hoped it would shut her up for a bit. From the evidence of this episode, you couldn't really blame them.</p> <p>Imagine her and the Doctor in the Tardis together, gibbering on whimsically at each other for eternity. It'd be like the <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGaeGZi5VVc\" title=\"\">bad old days of Ghostbusters</a> all over again. The Doctor already added, \"explodey-wodey\" to his phrases this weekend. That can't possibly be a good sign of things to come</p> <p>And there's still a question over Coleman's range, too. Admittedly this isn't her fault: she had plenty of chances to emote at the end, as she realised that she wasn't who she thought she was, but all her big moments were ruined by the strange decision to cut to the exterior of her Dalek as as it wiggled its antenna around impotently.</p> <p>These are only first impressions of course \u2013 remember how your heart sank when you first heard Matt Smith scream: \"Geronimo!\" right after David Tennant's death, only to fall in love with him during The Eleventh Hour? But it's fair to say that, as first impressions go, Coleman's wasn't spotless.</p> <p>Unless this is all a big setup to have a fully robotic, furious Dalek as the Doctor's next assistant, because I'd be fully behind that decision. Especially if it kept trying to kill Matt Smith in increasingly complicated ways. Road Runner in space. Who wouldn't love that?</p>",
  "<p>On Exmouth Market in central London, there is a blue tent by the side of the road. Look closer and you will see that the side of the tent is daubed with the words \"Jesus, help me\". Crowds bustle by on their way to and from work. But if you stuck your head inside, you would be greeted by the earnest face of Abdul Rahim Dehdozorgi.</p> <p>Dehdozorgi has not eaten for more than 30 days. He is hungry. His movements are slow and deliberate. If you doubt his resolve, then look closely at his lips. They are sewn together with fishing wire.</p> <p>Dehdozorgi's hunger strike is in support of his old pastor in Iran, an evangelical named Youcef Nadarkhani who was condemned to death by hanging in 2010. His crime? Apostasy \u2013 leaving the religion of Islam for another.</p> <p>Christianity is protected by Islamic law, and even though apostasy is a crime in sharia, it is not actually illegal in Iran. However, it can be punished by a court of law under the auspices of upholding a religious ruling.</p> <p>Nadarkhani argued in his trial that he had never been a Muslim, and thus could not be an apostate. The fact is that practising Christianity, especially international Protestantism, is often viewed as seditious in Iran. Proselytising for a religion that holds so much sway in the west is perhaps akin to advertising communist meetings in McCarthy-era America.</p> <p>Nadarkhani was held for four years in a notorious jail for political prisoners. He was given many chances to renounce his faith, but he steadfastly refused. Dehdozorgi described Nadarkhani's house church to me, the joy he had found there, and the persecution they faced. He claimed he could no longer practise Christianity safely in Iran.</p> <p>The form of Christianity to which Nadarkhani converted Dehdozorgi is not uncontroversial. The \"Jesus Only\" movement, that rejects the notion of the trinity for a unified theology of Christ, is seen as a cult by many other Christians. Even Iranian Christian news agency Mohabat News published an article complaining that \"the cult has caused untold damage to the cause of the gospel in Iran\".</p> <p>Whether his interpretation of Christ is orthodox or heretical, Dehdozorgi is clearly prepared to sacrifice the only thing he has left, his life, for his God. It is faith that made Dehdozorgi brave, but it is the British Home Office that has ensured he has nothing to lose. He is seeking asylum here and in the UK it is illegal for asylum seekers to work while their cases are being processed. Perhaps it is hoped that destitution will convince refugees to go home. Many, like Dehdozorgi, are simply unable to go home. He was living on the streets for more than three years before he began his hunger strike.</p> <p>The story has a precedent. In 2011 two Iranian brothers sat in a tent in central London and declared a hunger strike, sewing their lips together to display their resolve. They were in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/apr/21/iranian-hunger-stikers-sew-lips-uk-deportation\" title=\"\">national papers</a> and on television after a week.</p> <p>Dehdozorgi, however, has been largely ignored by the papers. Why? I could offer a tentative answer: the 2011 strike was secular, squarely aimed at the Border Agency. Dehdozorgi's protest is clearly religious. Many people will read the religious symbolism on the side of his tent as a mark of insanity.</p> <p>The intensity that the story of a 2,000-year-old execution arouses in people like Dehdozorgi is interpreted by some as dangerous irrationality. Even to those of us who disagree, Dehdozorgi's striking bravery is disturbing; perhaps he is determined to martyr himself here, as London grinds past without a second glance.</p> <p>Passers by quicken their pace in the effort to scrub his mournful image from their field of vision. The Iranian government is likely to do the same. Dehdozorgi's eyes are glazed with tiredness, but he is determined. He is prepared to die fighting this small battle for religious freedom in his country, whether this world pays him any mind or not.</p>",
  "<p>A suicide car bomb targeted a US diplomatic vehicle in the volatile city of Peshawar on Monday morning, killing two bystanders and wounding 19, including the passengers.</p> <p>Remarkably no one inside the car was killed by the huge rush-hour blast, which left a crater in the road and toppled nearby walls. Television footage showed a burned-out four-wheel-drive vehicle at the scene, thought to be the vehicle that was attacked.</p> <p>Immediately after the blast, the information minister of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province claimed four people had been killed, including two Americans. But the US state department denied that, saying \"two US personnel\" and two Pakistani members of staff were injured in the attack, which local police say involved more than 100kg of explosives.</p> <p>One eyewitness said he saw a severely wounded foreigner being loaded into a vehicle.</p> <p>\"No US consulate personnel were killed, but we are seeking further information about other victims of this heinous act,\" the statement said.</p> <p>Over the years the US consulate and its staff in the city, which is close to both the Afghan border and the semi-autonomous tribal areas that are home to a range of militant groups, have been repeatedly attacked.</p> <p>Last year, a car bomber attempted to target staff from the consulate, which includes diplomats and officials from the United States Agency for International Development, as they drove to work in a convoy of two armoured cars.</p> <p>The Pakistani Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack, in which a nearby motorcyclist died.</p> <p>In 2010, militants launched a multi-pronged attack of gunfire, car bombs and rocket-propelled grenades on the heavily fortified consulate itself, killing guards and a Pakistani civilian. In 2008, gunmen launched an unsuccessful attack on the car of the chief US diplomat in the city as her vehicle was leaving her residence.</p> <p>Also on Monday, trucks carrying supplies to Nato forces in Afghanistan were attacked in the south-west of the country.</p>",
  "<p>A Gaza man has died after setting himself alight, apparently in protest over his family's dire living conditions.</p> <p>Mohamed Abu Nada, 20, died on Sunday from injuries sustained a few days earlier when he poured petrol over his body at the morgue of Gaza City's Shifa hospital and set himself alight.</p> <p>His father told reporters in Gaza that his son wanted to draw attention to the family's poverty. \"I asked my son to go and look for a job, because I don't have a job and we don't have any source for living,\" said Abu Mohamed Abu Nada.</p> <p>Father and son reportedly argued before the incident.</p> <p>The family live in al-Shati refugee camp in Gaza City. Two-thirds of Gazan families became refugees in 1948 and they are generally among the poorest in Gaza.</p> <p>\"This case illustrates so tragically the wider sense of desperation which the blockade has engendered,\" said Chris Gunness, spokesman for the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, Unrwa. \"The humanitarian situation in Gaza is becoming increasingly dire, with the prospects of a prosperous and dignified life dwindling with every day.\"</p> <p>Hamdi Shaqqura of the Palestinian Centre for Human Rights said the news of the young man's suicide did not come as a shock. \"It is not the first time. In the past there have been several suicides for the reason of economic hardship,\" he said. \"The ongoing chronic closure imposed on the Gaza Strip has had a devastating impact on all aspects of life.\"</p> <p>The situation was particularly hard for young people, said Shaqqura. \"There are thousands and thousands of new graduates in the streets with no hope of finding a job, no hope of travelling abroad and no hope of building careers and lives.\"</p> <p>The unemployment rate in Gaza is 29%, and rises to 58% among young people aged between 20 and 24, according to the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics. Eight out of 10 households are dependent on some kind of aid, and 39% of the 1.6-million-strong population live below the poverty line.</p> <p>Overcrowding, lengthy and frequent power cuts, unsafe drinking water, poor sanitation and inadequate medical care are features of daily life in Gaza for much of the population.</p> <p>A UN report released last month forecast a rise in the population to 2.1 million by 2020. \"The substantial population growth will thus add some 500,000 people to a living area which is restricted and already heavily urbanised,\" said the report, <a href=\"http://www.unrwa.org/etemplate.php?id=1423\" title=\"\">Gaza in 2020 \u2013 A Liveable Place?</a> \"The challenges which confront the people of Gaza now will only intensify over the coming years.\"</p> <p>Israel enforced a tight blockade of Gaza for four years after Hamas took control of the area in June 2006, banning most imports, exports and the movement of people. Although it eased the blockade in 2010, there are still heavy restrictions on importing construction materials, exporting almost all goods and the issuing of permits to leave Gaza via Israel.</p> <p>Suicide, which is forbidden under Islam, is rare in Gaza despite operations by suicide bombers during the second intifada.</p>",

  "<p>When I was growing up, dandelion and burdock was the social tipple of choice. Darkly mellow with just enough fizz and a pleasing aniseedy aftertaste, I used to drink it at my granddad's house in Manchester, in a kitchen that looked exactly like the one in <em><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pZxvxmry4A\">The Tiger Who Came to Tea</a></em>. After the drink \u2013 which we would gulp down with Jacobs rum 'n' raisin Club biscuits - he would prop the bottle on the doorstep outside, ready for the man who collected \"the empties\".</p> <p>To me, dandelion and burdock will always be as 1970s as fruit-juice-for-starters and Berni Inn steaks with flags in. Apparently though it dates back to the days of St Thomas Aquinas, and in the late 1800s was positively popular thanks to the <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/static/in_depth/programmes/2001/booze/history2.stm\">Temperance Movement</a>, when bars sprung up starting in the north west serving up alcohol-free drinks to counter the rampant boozing of the day - alcohol being largely unregulated.</p> <p>Now, apparently, it's back, along with other old-style temperance drinks gracing much fancier menus than the Withington chippies of my youth. At the <a href=\"http://www.bookingofficerestaurant.com/restaurant/hotels/hotel-information/travel/lonpr-booking-office-st-pancras-renaissance-london/\">St Pancras Booking Office Bar</a> you can sip sarsaparilla, ginger beer, cream soda, blood tonic and lemon and ginger, which we drank with crispy calamari and devilishly moreish truffle and parmesan chips.</p> <p>Meanwhile, <a href=\"http://thebrinkliverpool.com/\">The Brink</a> in Liverpool do \"temperance cocktails\", including a \"Bollywood sour\" (lemon, sparkling water, ginger, elderflower and apple) and a \"Long Boat Fizz\" (ginger beer, lots of ice, fresh mint and freshly squeezed lime). Michelin-starred Lancashire chef <a href=\"http://www.thethreefishes.com\">Nigel Haworth</a> likes to sell them at his high-end Ribble Valley eateries, while nearby <a href=\"http://www.fitzpatrickstemperancebar.co.uk/\">Fitzpatrick's Temperance Bar</a>, in Rawtenstall, Lancashire reports a 300% increase in sales in the last year.</p> <p>If I'm feeling brave I may try whizzing one up myself, although, according to the Booking Office bartender, when he researched them for a cocktail \"they were unbelievably complicated\". Sarsaparilla, for example, involves an intricate blend of sarsaparilla root, anise, liquorice, nutmeg, molasses, cinnamon, cloves, brown sugar, lemon juice and other botanical extracts. Frankly why bother, when you could just crack open a of <a href=\"http://www.fentimans.com/\">Fentimans</a> or <a href=\"http://www.mawsonstraditionaldrinks.co.uk/\">Mawsons</a> (Victoriana in a bottle) instead? </p> <p>Cocktail lovers could have a crack at one of Mark Hix's creations, which he has been known to serve up at <a href=\"http://www.marksbar.co.uk/\">Mark's Bar</a> at the Belgravia Hotel in London (past glories include the Blooded Triangle - orange juice, rhubarb syrup, lemon sherbet and bitter lemon \u2013 and the Apple Mojito - chilled peppermint tea, Burrow Hill apple juice, soda and Bramley apple syrup). Or you can make his <a href=\"http://www.sallyshalamsbritain.co.uk/how-to-have-fun-without-a-drink/\">Earl Tregothnan Sour</a> by dry shaking chilled Tregothnan Earl Grey tea, bergamot orange juice, sugar syrup, Seville orange marmalade and egg white in a cocktail shaker with heaps of cubed ice.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395628173\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/22/1345644508308/Inside-Fitzpatricks-Tempe-004.jpg\" alt=\"Inside Fitzpatrick's Temperance Bar\" width=\"220\" height=\"132\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Inside Fitzpatrick's Temperance Bar in Rawtenstall, Lancashire. Photograph: Christopher Furlong/Getty Images</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christopher Furlong/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>My favourite temperance drinks though have to be from Fitzpatrick's, the only surviving temperance bar in the country and dating back to 1899. I have to declare a little bias here. I grew up a few miles from this quirky Pennines apothecary, with its ceramic tap barrels and jars of botanical herbs and roots. My great grandfather was a herbalist and a member of the Manchester temperance movement, so Fitzpatrick's always held a special lure. Their cream soda \u2013 all sweet creamy fizz and a delight with ice-cream \u2013 was a treat of my childhood. You could even buy it as a powder and blend it yourself, which felt thrillingly, almost dangerously scientific.</p> <p>In their heyday, temperance drinks were not only seen as delicious non-boozy tipple, but were thought to have health benefits: ginger for soothing nausea or colds, sarsaparilla and dandelion for detoxifying. I'm a little sceptical: according to family folklore, my gran's deafness was caused when my great grandfather decided to shun the doctor and treat her ear infection with his herbal linctures.</p> <p>But, for me, there's no knocking the taste, whether it's the sassy kick of sarsaparilla with its slightly medicinal undertones, punchy blood tonic with its surprising hint of bubblegum and the spicy warmth of rosehip, or lemon and ginger with its sharp citrus and lingering fiery afterkick. You can cook with the cordials too: there's <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/food/recipes/dandelion_and_burdock_01047\">dandelion and burdock cake</a>, gingery Thai prawns or Fitzpatrick's \"creamy chocolate ice cream flake\" (cookies and cream ice cream, sarsaparilla or dandelion and burdock cordial, chocolate pouring sauce and one small crushed flake).</p> <p>Those in need of a stiffer drink needn't miss out, either: the Booking Office throw the lemon and ginger into some water, soda water, gin and <a href=\"http://www.cocktaildb.com/ingr_detail?id=284\">capillaire syrup</a> to make a hot boozy Limmers Gin punch. It may not be true temperance, but boy, does it go down a treat.</p>",

  "<h2><strong>Day five: 3 September</strong></h2> <p>GB's Lee Pearson is a nine-times Paralympics gold medallist, and by the end of today he could have equalled Dame Tanni Grey-Thompson's record of 11 Paralympic golds with a win in the equestrian mixed individual freestyle Ib event (2.15pm). He has won three successive hat-tricks of gold medals since Sydney and along with his horse, Gentleman, he'll want more. Today is also the last of the group games in the wheelchair basketball competition, with GB's&#xa0;men (3.15pm) and women (1pm) looking to finish strongly and get a favourable draw in the knockout&#xa0;stages.</p> <h2>Archery</h2> <p>10:00 Men's Individual Recurve -
