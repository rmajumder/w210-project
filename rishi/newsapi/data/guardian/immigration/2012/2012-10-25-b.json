  "<p>Campaign strategists in the vital battleground of Ohio are pioneering a radical new approach to the ground war in the final days of the presidential election, delivering targeted messaging to different parts of the state in an attempt drive up voter turnout on 6 November.</p> <p>Both Barack Obama's re-election operation, Obama For America, and Mitt Romney's campaign are using micro-targeting techniques, backed by traditional TV and radio advertising, to hone messages to the specific political concerns of different corners of the state. The heavily vaunted \"battle for Ohio\" is not a single battle at all \u2013 in fact it is several distinct political conflicts being waged simultaneously in a bid for the state's rich crop of 18 electoral votes out of the 270 needed to win.</p> <p>The strategic shift in focus down to the level of regions, counties or in some cases even neighbourhoods is revolutionising the final stages of the race, with both parties vying aggressively for votes right across the state. The localised model of campaigning being developed in Ohio this year is likely to become the template of future US presidential elections as the technology takes hold.</p> <p>As Chris Redfern, who chairs the Ohio Democratic party, puts it: \"Four years from now it will be even more targeted as the technology improves and advances are made in how we collect information.\"</p> <p>As recently as the 2004 presidential election, Ohio was divided for campaigning purposes in half \u2013 the Democratic stronghold in the industrialised north, and the more rural and staunchly Republican south.</p> <p>But the advent of targeted messaging has heralded a sea-change in the way the campaigns are being run. In the final two weeks of the presidential contest, Obama will be campaigning as fiercely among the traditionally conservative Appalachian communities in the south-east of Ohio as he is in solidly blue Cleveland.</p> <p>\"In the old days \u2013 eight years ago \u2013 we'd focus on driving up votes in the north of Ohio, then hope we'd outnumbered the conservative turnout in the south-west,\" Redfern said. \"This year we're competing in all Ohio's 88 counties, and we are confident we will find some success in all 88 counties.\"</p> <p>Scott Jennings, Romney campaign director in Ohio, puts the same point another way: \"When our database tells us that there is a household of coal miners in a certain neighbourhood, then volunteers will be calling on them talking about Mitt Romney's plan on energy.\"</p> <p>The impact of this micro-targeting revolution can be clearly seen in four parcels of Ohio, in each of which a distinct political battle is being fought: the west and south-west of Ohio, with its concentration of military bases and suppliers, where the debate revolves around defence cuts; in the north, where it is wall-to-wall auto industry; in the east and south-east, where an argument rages over coal and the future of energy; and in the central zone around the financial and university hub, Columbus, where there is much talk about Wall Street regulation and education.</p> <h2>Defence in the west</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398381649\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2012/10/25/1351196980689/Barack-Obama-in-Dayton-Oh-006.jpg\" alt=\"Barack Obama in Dayton, Ohio\" width=\"220\" height=\"132\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Barack Obama in Dayton, Ohio. Photograph: Pablo Martinez Monsivais/AP</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Pablo Martinez Monsivais/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Dayton area and the west of Ohio is a military powerhouse. It contains the massive Wright-Patterson air force base, which procures all logistics for the US air force as well as developing new systems and technologies.</p> <p>It is not surprising that the military dominates the conversation in this region \u2013 it provides almost 30,000 jobs directly on the base and supports another 35,000 jobs outside, generating almost $5bn a year in business. On the back of those economic imperatives, both presidential campaigns have built their ground operations in the west of Ohio with a firm eye on the military vote.</p> <p>On Obama's side, that was self-evident when he and his running mate Joe Biden came to address a crowd of 10,000 supporters outside Dayton on Tuesday. The president spoke at length about his foreign policy achievements \u2013 pulling out of Iraq, drawing down in Afghanistan and killing Osama bin Laden \u2013 and he promised that if her were re-elected he would \"fight every single day for the men and women who have served our country so bravely\".</p> <p>On Romney's side, the campaign has been putting out TV ads and fliers warning of Obama defence cuts. \"Our message is clear,\" said Jennings, \"we are not going to cut defence as it weakens America and is a real jobs issue in Ohio.\"</p> <p>The two campaigns came to blows recently over the future of the Abrams tank, which is built in a plant in Lima in western Ohio. The Republicans seized on a comment from Biden about the need to reconfigure the military.</p> <p>\"Look, the military says we need a smaller, leaner army. We need more special forces, we don't need more M1 tanks,\" the vice-president said, reflecting the Pentagon's own thinking.</p> <p>The Romney campaign smelled blood, as there are 800 engineering jobs attached to the MI Abrams tank plant. It began running automated phone messages saying that a second-term Obama administration would see the Lima tank plant close with the loss of all those jobs.</p> <h2>Auto industry in the north</h2> <p>The role that Obama played in helping the American auto industry recover after the 2008 crash is his strongest card in Ohio, and he plays it whenever and wherever he's in the state. As Redfern points out, there are auto-related outlets in 82 of Ohio's 88 counties \u2013 providing about one in eight of all jobs in the state.</p> <p>But the car industry is especially concentrated in the north, all along the Lake Erie coastline. It is here that the Obama campaign has been serving a non-stop diet of TV and radio ads, reminding voters that his auto bailout helped save more than 150,000 jobs in Ohio and since June 2009 created an additional 17,000 jobs.</p> <p>That plays well from Toledo in the north-west, home to Chrysler and Jeep, across to Youngstown in the north-east, which produces the new Chevy Cruze. To ram the point home, Obama For America has been <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mgiuq2uR6LA\">airing a new TV advert in north Ohio</a> media markets called Made in Ohio. It lingers over the headline of a New York Times article written by Romney headlined: \"Let Detroit Go Bankrupt\".</p> <p>In the final presidential debate on Monday, Romney tried to defend himself against the charge that he would have let the auto industry self-implode by saying he wanted a managed bankruptcy to allow the big car companies to clear their debts and refinance. But he is clearly on the defensive in the densely populated north of the state.</p> <p>The Romney campaign sidesteps the issue of the auto bailout and talks instead about \"manufacturing\" and the trade threat posed by China. \"Manufacturing is crucial to communities like Toledo and Cleveland,\" Jennings said. \"We talk about getting tough on China \u2013 when China cheats that hurts jobs in Cleveland.\"</p> <p>As an indication of the disparity between the two campaigns across the auto belt, Obama For America has 19 field offices in the north-west region around Toledo. Romney by contrast has three.</p> <h2>Coal in the east</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398381650\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2012/10/25/1351196317684/Ohio-coal-006.jpg\" alt=\"Ohio, coal\" width=\"220\" height=\"132\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ohio, coal. Photograph: Shannon Stapleton/Reuters</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Shannon Stapleton/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>One of the fiercest local battles in this election is being fought in the east and south-east of the state. Yard signs posted on the lawns in front of many houses in the lush Appalachian hills make clear how intense the race is here. \"Stop the war on coal, fire Obama,\" they say.</p> <p>Coal mining is big business in the east of Ohio, with open-top mines, related steel mills and coal-fuelled power plants scattered all over the area. The Romney campaign has been making much of that here, accusing the Obama administration of being hostile towards coal.</p> <p>Paul Ryan and Romney's son Matt were both in coal country this week, holding rallies in which they charged the president with regulating the coal industry to death. The aim is clear: to galvanise the coalmining communities and rural Appalachian folk and cajole them to the polls in an attempt to counter Obama's grip on the auto-industry north.</p> <p>\"We think we have a winning issue here,\" Romney's Ohio director, Scott Jennings, said. \"There are many people in this region who traditionally vote Democrat, but they know Barack Obama has been terrible for them.\"</p> <p>Obama For America is fighting back as best he can. The campaign has been playing clips of Romney standing in front of a coal factory when he was Massachusetts governor and saying: \"That plant kills people\".</p> <p>The Obama campaign has also been emphasising in its media messages in this area that Romney has a Swiss bank account and holdings in the Cayman Islands. \"We calculate that such behaviour doesn't resonate well with the values of the people in this part of the state,\" a senior Obama For America official said.</p> <h2>Education and Wall Street in the centre</h2> <p>Columbus, the state capital, is home to Ohio State University, with about 57,000 students. That's very attractive territory for Obama who in 2008 did well among students.</p> <p>This year, the campaign has been emphasising how the Obama administration has doubled funds for federal Pell Grants to help students pay for college. Latest figures for 2010 show that 363,000 Ohio students benefited from the grants.</p> <p>The Republicans have been focusing more on Columbus's role as the financial capital, highlighting Romney's business career in the hope of impressing this conservative-leaning city.</p> <p>Overall, one of the interesting features of 2012 compared with previous presidential election cycles is how competitive the race is across all these four regions. Unlike in the past, nothing is being left to chance.</p> <p>Dr Melissa Miller, associate professor of political science at Bowling Green State University, said that the battle that is raging across Ohio is partly a reflection of the power of digital micro-targeting that is still in its infancy, and partly the result of such a close race where the harvesting of any additional votes, however few and far between, could prove to be decisive.</p> <p>\"When the race is razor thin as it looks likely to be, then it becomes all about finding your supporters and getting them out to vote,\" Miller said.</p>",
  "<p>Remember Paul Thorburn? You will if you are Welsh because, rightly, Welsh rugby fans still talk about his kick 26 years ago in the then Five Nations against Scotland. It was an <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTtTbcfwCMA\" title=\"YouTube  Thorburn kick\">absolute monster</a>, measuring a little over 64 metres and because it was exceptional, people remember it. Just like Bob Beamon's long jump in the 1968 Mexico Olympics, when he beat the world record by nearly two feet, it was a one-off, so the memory lingers on.</p> <p>Now, what would happen if these feats were two a penny? What if rugby kickers started banging penalties over from around 60 metres as a regular occurrence? Because they are.</p> <p>On Sunday at Leicester, Toby Flood had one of those days. In 17 minutes, he attempted three kicks from inside his own half, two of which split the posts almost perfectly and both were probably good enough to get home from about 58 metres.</p> <p>The first, on 51 minutes, was initially awarded against the Ospreys 10 metres further out, but referee Romaine Poite then moved the ball upfield after a talk about discipline. From 47 metres it easily cleared the bar and was not far short of reaching the stand.</p> <p>Fourteen minutes later, Flood ran out from under his own posts, two Ospreys went off their feet and Poite pointed to a spot around 53 metres out. With no breeze to speak of, the kick got home with two or three metres to spare. Three minutes after that, the Leicester fly-half tried a third time from 52 metres. Again, distance was no trouble, but direction let him down.</p> <p>Exceptional kicking? It seems not. A week earlier, Leigh Halfpenny of Cardiff Blues landed a couple of monsters against Sale and tales of pinpoint accuracy are coming in from everywhere. At Galway, where the wind is not normally kind to kickers, Ben Botica and Dan Parks landed 13 from 15 between them and a day later Jonny Wilkinson's kicking for Toulon saw off Cardiff.</p> <p>In a lot of cases, such kicks are down to better technique, better preparation, stronger and bigger kickers or guys who are prepared to work hard at their art, as Wilkinson certainly is. However, this time, word around the circuit is that the ball being used for the Heineken Cup suits most kickers down to the ground \u2013 Flood said as much.</p> <p>But is that a good thing? Will the performances of the past two weeks last longer in the mind than Thorburn's 1986 kick, which was not only measured at a shade over 70 yards, but was launched off the ground, not a kicking tee, which made it that much more difficult. I think not, and that, for me, is bad news because the reason sporting memories stay fresh is that they are usually unique.</p> <p>In my mind's eye, that Thorburn kick always looked long and low \u2013 never seemingly getting above the tops of the Cardiff posts \u2013 and just sneaked inside the left upright. A later conversion from 49 metres I can't remember and, short of suggesting that all the Flood and Halfpenny kicks were awarded after incidents at the breakdown, I can't be more precise about them.</p> <p>If that sounds overly romantic, then I'm sorry. I'm more likely to be impressed by improved personal ability than by new tweaks in technology and would suggest that if kickers go on using specialist coaches and keep finding exercises which help them boot balls further, then it's up to the ball manufacturers to step in and stop what seems like a march toward endless giant kicks. It's starting to distort games and rendering them less of a spectacle.</p> <p>You can do three things with a penalty; tap it and go for the try, kick for touch and go for the try or belt the ball at the posts. I merely ask which is the least entertaining, but increasingly common.</p> <p>And while I'm at it, can we make the drop goal less of \u2013 as snooker players say \u2013 \"a shot to nothing\". Watch the Springboks return 22 restarts, each of which are kicked long, with a pot at the posts. They know they can't lose. Hit and they get three points, miss and it's back to square one.</p> <p>How about giving the defending side the option of letting a drop kick go dead and then restart play with a scrum from where the kick was taken. I bet that would produce something of a rethink, fewer kicks and more play with ball in hand.</p>",
  "<p>Sudan has complained to the UN security council that Israeli planes bombed a munitions plant in Khartoum, an attack that has been widely interpreted as a warning to Iran over its nuclear programme.</p> <p>Israeli military commentators said that the Yarmouk facility in the Sudanese capital was owned by Iran and had been used to supply weapons to Hamas fighters in the Gaza Strip. The \"impressive\" reach of the secret operation was said to have demonstrated an ability to hit Iran's nuclear facilities \u2014 a similar distance from Israel.</p> <p>As reverberations continued from Tuesday's 1,000-mile attack, Israel would neither confirm nor deny it was involved. Ehud Barak, the defence minister, said : \"There is nothing I can say about this subject.\" But one of his most senior officials praised the country's air force and called Sudan a \"terrorist state\".</p> <p>Sudan's UN ambassador, Daffa-Alla Elhag Ali Osman, called on the security council to condemn the raid as \"a blatant violation of the concept of peace and security\". Iran also denounced Israel, as did Hezbollah, the Lebanese Shia movement with close links to Tehran.</p> <p>Sudan's culture and information minister, Ahmed Bilal Osman, had said earlier that four radar-evading aircraft carried out an attack around midnight on Tuesday. \"We think Israel did the bombing,\" he said. \"We reserve the right to react at a place and time we choose.\"</p> <p>Sudan's state news agency said the planes used \"hi-tech jamming devices\" in the attack and a Sudanese reporter told Israel's Haaretz newspaper that there was a telecommunications blackout for about an hour before the explosions.</p> <p>\"There are two arms factories in this area of the strike: one is the Yarmouk factory, the other is the Sudan Technical Centre,\" a UN source told the Guardian. \"We don't know for certain if they are making weapons or manufacturing ammunition. At the very minimum they are repackaging munitions produced elsewhere. Yarmouk is sponsored by Iran. The Sudan Technical Centre is definitely handling Chinese weapons.\"</p> <p>Israel has long accused Khartoum of serving as a base for Hamas, the Palestinian Islamist movement that controls the Gaza Strip. \"Sudan is a dangerous terrorist state,\" Amos Gilad, an influential former general and senior defence ministry official, told Israel's Army Radio.</p> <p>There was a strong sense that Israel was also sending a blunt message to Iran. Ron Ben-Yishai, a veteran military commentator, wrote in daily newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth: \"There is no doubt that the explosion in Khartoum will be food for thought not only for the authorities in Sudan but also in Gaza \u2013 and especially in Tehran.\"</p> <p>Ephraim Inbar, a strategic expert, said: \"It is very plausible that Israel was behind the strike. We have operated in that region in response to a variety of intelligence reports in the past. We definitely have the capability [to launch such a strike]. It seems an easy operation, involving four jets. For us it would be a piece of cake.\"</p> <p>The UN source said: \"We know for sure that weapons are flowing from and through Sudan into the Egyptian Sinai, possibly to Gaza. The Egyptians have told us that the arms flowing into Sinai from Sudan are a big security problem. Northern Sinai is full of weapons.</p> <p>\"We have seen in the last few days intense clashes along this northern border, between Israel and Egypt, with armed, radicalised Bedouin groups with a vision of political Islam. There seem to be clear links between this and the strike in Khartoum. In the same days we've seen a dramatic increase in rockets fired into Israel from Gaza. The convergence of these elements points to Israel as the perpetrator.\"</p> <p>In past there have been allegations that Sudan stored chemical weapons for Iraq at the Yarmouk facility. Government officials denied the charge. The attack destroyed part of the compound infrastructure, killed two people and injured another.</p> <p>In April last year, Sudan said it had irrefutable evidence that Israeli attack helicopters had carried out a missile and machine-gun strike on a car south of Port Sudan. That attack mirrored a similar strike by foreign aircraft on a truck convoy reportedly laden with weapons in eastern Sudan in January 2009. That too is widely believed to have been carried out Israel.</p>",
  "<p>\u2022 Truth be told, Barack Obama has probably already lost the votes of that portion of America scandalised by bad language. For one thing, his autobiography, Dreams From My Father, makes copious use of the word \"motherfucker\" \u2013 while his rival, linguistically speaking, seems to inhabit a 1950s sitcom set among the clean-cut patrons of a milkshake parlour. (As governor of Massachusetts, one former colleague told the New York Times recently, Romney used to tell people to \"go to H-E-double-hockey-sticks\", though he does indulge, the paper conceded, in \"the occasional 'crap'.\")</p> <p>But now the coarseness chasm has widened. As an interview team from Rolling Stone were leaving the Oval Office earlier this month, that magazine reveals, \"executive editor Eric Bates told Obama that he had asked his six-year-old if there was anything she wanted him to say to the president \u2026 She said: 'Tell him: You can do it.'\" Obama replied: \"You know, kids have good instincts. They look at the other guy and say, 'Well, that's a bullshitter, I can tell'.\" \"Bullshitter\" may not be \"motherfucker\" \u2013 but as an insult directed at one presidential candidate by another, it's this campaign's high, or low, point, which makes it, in the immortal words of Joe Biden, \"a big fuckin' deal.\" \"The president is someone who says what he means and does what he<br>says,\" Obama's spokesman Dan Pfeiffer tried to clarify, urging<br>reporters not to get \"distracted by the word\".</p> <p>We can expect Romney's media surrogates, in the coming days, to paint the president as classless and foulmouthed, though Romney himself was apparently simply too gosh-darned shocked by the news to comment, preferring to drown his sorrows, according to unconfirmed reports, in a delicious ice-cream soda. (With Diet Coke.)</p> <p>\u2022 A recurring theme of the campaign has been the vigorous efforts, by some Republican supporters, to find ways to deny the reality of Obama's narrow but steady lead in numerous swing-state polls and electoral college predictions. First came Unskewed Polls, a website that nudged results in Romney's favour by \u2013 and I'm simplifying, but only slightly \u2013 adding a few more points to his totals.</p> <p>Then came the rise of the \"Nate Silver Truthers\", sceptics determined to find bias in the methods of the New York Times's in-house polling geek, whose numbers are crunched almost entirely by (an evidently left-leaning) computer.</p> <p>And now please welcome Townhall.com commentator Matt Towery, who's convinced the polls are biased towards Obama because \u2026 some of them take 20 minutes to answer. \"And what hardworking, productive member of a family, taking care of a business, house or family, has time to spare for such an opus? Likely not the type that fits the profile of a Romney voter.\" Never mind that good models iron out such hypothetical biases by adjusting for polls' past performance in predicting results. This new angle seems unassailable: polling itself is biased towards layabout Democrats! Next month: why \"voting\" isn't really a trustworthy measure of how people vote.</p> <p>\u2022 Where now for multimillionaire self-embarrasser, journalist-manipulator and Scotland-annoyer Donald Trump, after yesterday's heartless announcement that he'd be withholding $5m from deserving charities unless the president did something he'd obviously never do? The New York property news site The Real Deal reports that Trump, who enjoys pretending to \"fire\" people, has been fired in a non-pretend fashion, after the board of one of his flagship buildings, Manhattan's Trump Place, voted to replace the Trump Organisation as the building's manager.</p> <p>Still, he'll always have the gossip columnists and the conservative rabble-rousers, right? Maybe not: the Fox News talking head Michelle Malkin responded to his latest stunt by calling him a \"clown\", which is a bit like being called a \"cantankerous vegetarian indie rock pioneer\" by Morrissey; and now the veteran gossip writer Lloyd Grove has had enough, too. \"At long last, you have made yourself irrelevant,\" he writes, and vows, on behalf of his employer the Daily Beast, no further coverage of Trump's antics for the foreseeable future. \"Or, at the very least, before the November 6 election.\" So a week and a half, then.</p>",
  "<p>From beyond the grave Elizabeth Taylor has overtaken her close friend Michael Jackson to become the top earning dead celebrity. The estate of the actor, who died last year, earned $210m (\u00a3130m) in the past 12 months largely due to Christie's record-setting auction of her jewellery and art collection, according to Forbes' annual poll of the richest dead celebrities.</p> <p>Taylor's auction, which included a Van Gogh that fetched $24.6m, helped her push Jackson into second place. Her fortunes were also boosted by sales of her perfume, White Diamond, which earned $75m in 2011.</p> <p>With the sale behind her Taylor may struggle to keep her crown next year from Jackson. The King of Pop's fortunes appear to have risen since his death in 2009, not least because he is no longer around to spend it. His estate took in $145m, according to Forbes, more than any other artist. Much of the money came from his half share in the Sony/ATV publishing catalogue, whose artists include the Beatles and Lady Gaga.</p> <p>The third slot in Forbes' poll went to another King, Elvis Presley. His estate suffered after the Viva Elvis show in Las Vegas closed but attendances at his home Graceland rose, helped by warm weather. One billionaire is betting his reign will continue. Investor Leon Black's Apollo Global Management bought CKX, the parent company of American Idol and the estates of Elvis and Muhammad Ali, last year for $509m. Black likes icons. He bought one of four versions of Edvard Munch's The Scream for $119m earlier this year.</p> <p>The top three, all of whom were immortalised by Andy Warhol, are followed by Charles Schulz this year. The Peanuts comic strip creator made $37m in the past 12 months and his estate is set for another boost as Fox prepares a big screen movie from the team behind the hit Ice Age movies.</p> <p>While Jackson looks set to reclaim his crown next year, 2013 could witness an unlikely fight between Charlie Brown, Taylor and Presley for the runner-up prize.</p>",
  "<p>All but unnoticed by the wider world, Turkey's prime minister, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, held an unscheduled t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate last week with the US's most despised bogeyman, President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad of Iran.</p> <p>Given deep disagreements over Syria, and Iranian anger at Turkey's decision to allow the US to deploy missile defence systems on its soil, <a href=\"http://breakingnews.sy/en/article/9247.html\" title=\"\">the meeting at a regional economic summit in Baku, Azerbaijan, was something of a surprise</a>.</p> <p>Neither man gave much away after the encounter, but officials said ways of defusing the Syrian crisis were discussed. After a year or more of backing opposing sides, and with a military solution apparently beyond the reach of both Bashar al-Assad's regime and Free Syrian Army (FSA) rebels, Iran and Turkey have a shared interest in calming things down.</p> <p>The Syrian regime's reported agreement, strongly backed by Iran and Turkey, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-20066613\" title=\"\">to begin a limited truce this weekend</a> may be one result of this new approach. It also reflects a changing Turkish stance that puts new emphasis on forging a regional solution to the Syrian impasse in the absence of effective US, UN or other international action.</p> <p>Turkey has been badly burned by the Syrian conflagration and feels let down by Washington and its European Nato allies, who have rebuffed its calls for border buffer areas, no-fly zones and armed humanitarian intervention. It has all but given up hope that either a re-elected Barack Obama or Mitt Romney will show a stronger lead.</p> <p>An estimated 150,000 Syrian refugees have flooded over Turkey's southern frontier. Trade with Syria, once worth an annual $2.5bn (\u00a31.5bn), has dwindled to a trickle. Resulting economic hardship and political instability in Hatay and other Turkish border provinces, home to <a href=\"http://www.todayszaman.com/news-291247-group-tries-to-recruit-hatay-alevis-into-assad-army.html\" title=\"\">large numbers of Arab Alevis who identify with Syria's ruling Alawite minority</a>, has rung alarm bells in Ankara.</p> <p>\"Turkish policy on Syria was thrown into total confusion by Assad's refusal to stand down last year,\" said Cengiz Aktar, a leading Turkish commentator. \"They were expecting him to go the way of Mubarak [in Egypt] and Gaddafi [in Libya], or better still Ben Ali [the Tunisian president who fled into exile]. But nothing of the kind happened \u2026 The US and Europe were not prepared to back any military operations and the Russians were doing their own thing \u2026 Turkey ran out of options.\"</p> <p>To make matters worse, Turkish officials are convinced the Syrian regime, retaliating for Turkish support for the FSA, is aiding and abetting Kurdistan Workers' party (PKK) separatist fighters, whose terror attacks on targets in south-east Turkey are at a 10-year high.</p> <p>The PKK's Syrian offshoot, the Party of Unity and Democracy (PYD), which claims to represent Syria's Kurdish minority, has also profited from the chaos. Turkey worries the PYD may try to set up an autonomous region in northern Syria, akin to Massoud Barzani's Kurdistan regional government (KRG) in northern Iraq.</p> <p>\"Particularly alarming was the capture of several towns along the Turkish border by the PYD,\" said Gonul Tol, of the Centre for Turkish Studies at the Middle East Institute. \"Turkey watched nervously as Kurdish groups took control of the towns after the withdrawal of Assad forces and hoisted the Kurdish flag over Syrian government buildings, along with posters of the PKK's imprisoned leader, Abdullah Ocalan,\" <a href=\"http://mideast.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2012/08/29/syrias_kurdish_challenge_to_turkey\" title=\"\">Tol wrote</a>.</p> <p>Ahmet Davutoglu, Turkey's foreign minister, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/19/turkey-britain-us-intervene-syria\" title=\"\">told the Guardian in an interview conducted last week</a>: \"When the regime has withdrawn from certain places in Syria, sometimes they are giving weapons or other means to let the PKK control those parts of Syria \u2026 The PKK is trying to use the chaotic situation in the region for their own activities.\"</p> <p>A recent spate of incidents along the 560-mile border has reinforced the impression the situation is spinning out of control. Turkish and Syrian military units exchanged fire repeatedly after a Syrian shell killed five Turkish civilians in a border town earlier this month.</p> <p>And a huge diplomatic row broke out last week after Turkish fighter jets forced down a Syrian passenger plane en route from Russia to Damascus. Turkey <a href=\"http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/turkish-fm-defends-ankaras-decision-to-ground-syrian-plane.aspx?pageID=238&amp;nID=33130&amp;NewsCatID=338\" title=\"\">claimed the plane was carrying</a> military equipment, an allegation furiously denied in Moscow.</p> <p>Security issues aside, Syria has become a massive political headache. Erdogan and Davutoglu have been heavily criticised for first engaging with Assad last year, in the belief they could talk him round, and then going to the other extreme this year, noisily demanding his resignation when they lacked the means to enforce it.</p> <p>\"They were naive. They bet that Assad would fall. And they were wrong,\" said a former national newspaper editor. \"Erdogan is frustrated. He feels Assad sold him out. He takes everything personally.\"</p> <p>Capitalising on opinion polls that show a large majority of Turks fears a war with Syria and opposes any kind of intervention, Kemal Kilicdaroglu, leader of the main opposition Republican People's party (CHP), rounded on Davutoglu, saying his famous policy of \"zero problems with neighbours\", adopted in 2002 as Ankara sought to re-establish itself as a regional superpower, was a flop.</p> <p>Kilicdaroglu said Turkey was isolated over Syria, with only Saudi Arabia, Qatar, the KRG in Iraq and Hamas on its side. Against it were ranged Russia, China, Iran, Brazil and India.</p> <p>\"How can we describe the policy that put Turkey into this situation?\" <a href=\"http://www.kurdpress.com/En/NSite/FullStory/News/?Id=2695#Title=CHP%20leader%20criticized%20Turkey%20foreign%20policy,%20calls%20FM%20%18an%20idiot%19\" title=\"\">Kilicdaroglu asked</a>. \"Is this 'strategic depth' [a favourite Davutoglu concept] or strategic blindness? The process that resulted in Turkey becoming part of such a meaningless balance comes from a foreign minister whose incompetence is known by the entire world \u2026 You have to be a real idiot to do that.\"</p> <p>Clear signs are now emerging that the government is changing tack, and that by mending fences with neighbours such as Iran, Russia, and maybe even Nouri al-Maliki's Iraq, it hopes to forge a binding Syrian solution that is guaranteed by the regional powers and bridges what at present is a growing Sunni-Shia sectarian divide. Part of this new approach, outlined by Erdogan, is to establish a set of parallel talks mechanisms bringing together Egypt and Saudi Arabia, which want Assad to resign, and Russia and Iran, who have resisted forced regime change.</p> <p>Welcoming the move, the H\u00fcrriyet columnist Semih Idiz said Turkish policy on Syria had become a \"rudderless ship\" and a course correction was long overdue. \"This represents a significant shift in position by Ankara&#xa0;\u2026 It was no more than a few months ago that Ankara looked coolly on any discussion on Syria which involved Russia and Iran,\" <a href=\"http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/turkey-changes-tack-on-syria.aspx?pageID=449&amp;nID=32739&amp;NewsCatID=416\" title=\"\">Idiz said</a>.</p> <p>Intriguingly, this revamped region-based approach may include a rapprochement with Israel. Ties ruptured in 2010 amid a bitter row over the deaths of nine Turkish activists aboard a Gaza aid flotilla that was stormed by Israeli commandos. Alarmed at events across its disputed Golan Heights border, Israel has put out diplomatic feelers, suggesting that at this time of crisis, Tel Aviv and Ankara should set aside old differences and work together.</p> <p>Pinhas Avivi, a senior Israeli foreign ministry official and former ambassador to Turkey, offered bilateral talks on Syria this week. Turkey's public response has been cool so far, but <a href=\"http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4295593,00.html\" title=\"\">political insiders say Ankara has a strong interest in making up</a>.</p> <p>Speaking to the Guardian, Ahmet Davutoglu, Turkey's foreign minister, said Turkey had always believed in a regional approach and was optimistic Russia, for example, with which he was maintaining regular high-level contacts, could be part of a solution.</p> <p>While flatly rejecting suggestions his Syria policy had failed, he was adamant Assad would have to step down if a lasting settlement were to be secured. He said: \"Every day I am asking myself, what more could be done to prevent this bloodshed. We have done everything&#xa0;\u2026 We have tried bilateral engagement with the regime to persuade them [to have] a transition process and help them go to a democratic system \u2026</p> <p>\"For several months we tried, even before the Arab spring \u2026 We went to Damascus last August [2011] \u2026 He [Assad] accepted our step-by-step plan but after two, three days he did not fulfil his promise&#xa0;\u2026 We realised he was cheating us and trying to misuse his relationship with us.</p> <p>\"Still we have regional engagement with Egypt, Iran, Saudi Arabia&#xa0;\u2026 What else can we do? I think it would not be ethical at all to continue business as usual&#xa0;\u2026 Ethically and strategically our policy has been right. Ethically it is right because we are on the side of human rights, we are on the side of the rightful aspirations of Syrian people. Strategically it is right because we are on the right side of history.</p> <p>\"At the end of the day, this regime cannot continue the way it is, and the new elected government of Syria will be the best friend of Turkey.\"</p>",
  "<p>Felipe Andres Coronel, aka <a href=\"http://www.myspace.com/immortaltechnique\" title=\"\">Immortal Technique</a>, is more than just an underground hip-hop legend \u2013 he's an activist, humanitarian and a revolutionist. Born in Peru and raised in Harlem, New York, the 34-year-old has struck a chord with those seeking an alternative voice in hip-hop. He represents a thorn in the side of the mainstream with his messages about class struggle, religion, government and institutional racism.</p> <p>He is currently touring the UK and will be performing with <a href=\"http://www.myspace.com/lowkeyuk\" title=\"\">Lowkey</a> \u2013 a British hip-hop artist and activist \u2013 at a sold-out Electric Brixton tonight.</p> <p><strong>What are the themes of your music?</strong></p> <p>A better response is: go on the internet and steal all my music and listen to it. If it speaks to you, then feel free to support me. But if you want a real answer to that question, I'd say that the music I make is very personal, passionate and tells a story of sacrifice. There are a lot of historical and political references. People ask me: 'Why do you rap about politics?' I've always tried to reflect real life in my music and go beyond the experience of the inner-city ghetto of America. I like to have multiple dimensions in my music.</p> <p><strong>What do you make of Lowkey and the political/conscious hip-hop scene in the UK?</strong></p> <p>It's a very positive thing to have multiple dimensions to any hip-hop scene. So I always think the voice of reason is great to have. People such as Lowkey and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/artist/759d2090-c396-492a-90fd-2586a50d48cd\" title=\"\">Akala</a> rap about real life. Reality rap is what I call it. I think the UK has a rich culture of immigrants who are coming from Africa and Asia and share experiences that are so unique, it's only right that they document it and recount their struggles too. Without that diversity you're going to end up like we did in the States, and I hope that never happens. We are fighting a real guerrilla war in America in terms of getting independent music out, getting out music with a message. They are resisting. We've found a home-base to fight from in the jungle. They've found it too hard to wipe us out; we're not going anywhere.</p> <p><strong>Who is resisting and why are they doing it?</strong></p> <p>It's more the industry. There are forces within the industry who like very much what I do. Why? Because it's a money-maker. It's more people who see the music I make as a threat to the status quo of hip-hop. They don't want people to hear about Palestine, slavery or torture. They want us to just dance and sing and smile and pretend that the world is OK. They believe hip-hop is sheer entertainment. Entertainment can be used for many things: to inspire and educate but also to pacify, to keep people stupid and preoccupied with things that aren't important.</p> <p><strong>Where does the anger in your music come from?</strong></p> <p>I think it's righteous fury. If someone shot your mother you'd be angry, right? But would you be wrong for being angry? No. I've heard people criticise me for the most ridiculous things, calling my music abrasive. If you're troubled by the words I speak, then you should probably hang yourself because the world is going to tear you apart or is too real for you to accept. I'm not offended by fuck, shit, pussy, dick, motherfucker. You know what I'm offended by? I'm offended by seeing a child in Gaza who has had his skin burned off by white phosphorus. I'm offended by seeing the graves of civilians that are there because they are the \"collateral damage\" of a drone strike in Afghanistan or Pakistan. I'm offended when I see people perverting Christianity, Islam or Judaism for their own political purposes so they can justify taking land or killing people in the name of something.</p> <p><strong>How have you evolved as an artist since your first album, </strong><a href=\"http://www.allmusic.com/album/revolutionary-vol-1-mw0000375543\" title=\"\"><strong>Revolutionary Vol 1</strong></a><strong>?</strong></p> <p>I just used to write rhymes in my mind and then I tried to find beats to fit them. By <a href=\"http://www.allmusic.com/album/revolutionary-vol-2-mw0000695711\" title=\"\">Vol 2</a> I was mastering and perfecting the flow and by <a href=\"http://www.allmusic.com/album/the-3rd-world-mw0000788879\" title=\"\">The Third World</a> album my flow had a developed a lot more. I had to learn to breathe with my diaphragm rather than my lungs. I learned to expand my arms so I get the extra 10% of breath that opera singers do when they sing. I had to go to a breathing coach, and there is no shame in that. If [rapping] is your instrument, learn how to use it.</p> <p><strong>Who are your musical influences?</strong></p> <p>Most of my lyrical influences came from people who didn't really do hip-hop. Like <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/malcolm-x\" title=\"\">Malcolm X</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/muhammad-ali\" title=\"\">Muhammad Ali</a> \u2013 people who I thought were incredible speakers. But in terms of rap, I'm talking <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/artist/fc4568b6-cbe3-4a3d-8409-28510c19e3e2\" title=\"\">KRS-One</a>, Ice Cube, Chuck D, Kool G Rap, Big Daddy Kane, Slick Rick, Big Punisher, Lord Finesse, DITC.</p> <p><strong>What was involved in making the 2011 documentary film </strong><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hLJIH7ICJs\" title=\"\"><strong>The [R]evolution of Immortal Technique</strong></a><strong>, and what did you learn?</strong></p> <p>That I hate documentaries about my life but at the same time I loved making this. It was a seven-year-long project. We went everywhere. We did hip-hop shows from one corner of the Earth to another.</p> <p><strong>What places hit you the most?</strong></p> <p>Afghanistan in terms of seeing struggle, poverty and strife. But in Haiti after the earthquake, I saw some of the worst conditions in my life. I saw a 10-year-old girl who had become the surrogate mother of all these little three- and four-year-old girls whose parents had perished. She was feeding them and giving them water so they wouldn't die. That is a 10-year-old girl! There were four or five families in one tent. When I went to Peru I saw a 10-year-old girl prostituting herself on the street. That affects you differently.</p> <p><strong>What do you make of Obama's first term as president?</strong></p> <p>Why are we held prisoner by this two-party system when neither of them represents the true values of America? Romney's position is fairly deceptive. Obama painted him as a man who will say anything to get elected. That's what Romney is. Romney said he wasn't anti-abortion when he was governor of Massachusetts, then when he was running for the Republican party he is the most anti-abortion guy in the world. He said he would start a war with Iran but when he realised the economic and political reality of starting another war and how much America is against it, he began mirroring Obama's policy.</p> <p><strong>What should the world expect if Romney becomes president?</strong></p> <p>I think he would make it end up looking like [George W] Bush's third term as president. Obama is still a war president. He didn't shut down Guant\u00e1namo Bay; he deported more people than Bush did; he supposedly ended the war in Iraq just to expand in Afghanistan; he signed the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Defense_Authorization_Act\" title=\"\">National Defence Authorisation Act</a>, which is very draconian. I have a lot of problems in actively supporting someone like that.</p> <p><strong>In your song </strong><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Igt-jW4e8ts\" title=\"\"><strong>Point of No Return</strong></a><strong> you say the government is after you. How much truth is in that?</strong></p> <p>I've definitely had a lot of run-ins with the government. They have tried to do my father for taxes; they thought I was hiding money with him. I have had my passport confiscated and have been questioned by Homeland Security upon coming home \u2013 not from Afghanistan but anywhere in the world.</p> <p><strong>Do you see yourself making music forever?</strong></p> <p>In some capacity yes, but the soul has to develop in some form. I like writing books, stories and essays \u2013 I may do that. I use to teach ancient history in prison for children. I found a lot of gratification in that because I saw people's lives turn around.</p> <p><strong>Your lyrics contain a lot of religious messages. What does religion mean to you and do you follow a faith?</strong></p> <p>If I told people I was a Muslim, people wouldn't say: \"Wow, that's wonderful you've found inner peace in your life by embracing Islam.\" They'd ask: \"What type of Muslim are you? Are you one of them fucking Wahabbi, Sunnite, Salafi psycho-niggas? Are you down with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/hezbollah\" title=\"\">Hezbollah</a> and them?\" If I told people I was Jewish, they'd ask: \"Do you support Israel and do you support the colonisation of Palestine?\" It's irrelevant whether you call yourself a Christian, Muslim or Jew because if you don't reflect that in your life, you aren't that at all. I have always been hounded by people about it; people try and pry it out of me. I believe in God and have a faith that's very personal to me. That faith is between me and God. We have polarised religion, rather than it being a personal reflection of your relationship with God and how you communicate with God. I'd rather be friends with a good atheist than a bad religious person. Your religion is suppose to ennoble you, but if all it makes you do is become contemptuous of other people, or make you say other people are going to hell, your religion has failed you, or rather, you have failed your religion.</p> <p><strong>What struggles do you face with being a \"reality rap\" artist and people trying to pinpoint any sort of hypocrisy in your life?</strong></p> <p>I don't shy away from anything. As human beings, we're all works in progress. If I can get some constructive criticism, you're helping me grow as a human being. Sometimes I realise I need to grow. It happened with me trying to take the word bitch more out of my music. I'm not a \"gay-rights champion\", but if I'm going to talk about people being oppressed in my music, then aren't some people oppressed if they don't have the right to marry the person they want in a society that's supposed to be free? They shouldn't be punished by a government because of the way they are born.</p> <p><strong>Do you feel a lot of your music is about conspiracies?</strong></p> <p>I wouldn't call it conspiracy. I would suggest people research \u2013 for example when I said Bin Laden was part of the CIA and people said \"that's not true\". There was a poll in the US and it showed less than 15% knew Bin Laden knew was employed by US. When people say it's a conspiracy I welcome the criticism, because the music I make is backed by historical facts. I'm not afraid to be wrong or debate it. I won't allow people to marginalise my music.</p> <p><strong>What do you do in your spare time?</strong></p> <p>Read, sleep, work out, box, spend time with people I love.</p> <p><strong>Why do you use the N-word so frequently?</strong></p> <p>I would say I use it less frequently than I have before. I have made a conscious decision to replace it in the music I make. I understand a lot of people have used that word to express camaraderie. In the States we remade the word to be something that reflected unity among ourselves. I think it was a confidence-builder and a way of showing that hip-hop could supersede any of the stereotypes thrown on top of them. The only problem is that when it became corporatised, someone else decided what those stereotypes would be replaced with.</p> <p><strong>Will you continue to use the word?</strong></p> <p>I think eventually I will have to phase it out. I don't want to be 50 years old and yelling to my children like that. I think what people need to keep in mind is the way individuals are introduced to that word is incredibly unique for everybody's experience. There is a certain power in reclaiming language.</p> <p><strong>Do you ever see yourself starting a family?</strong></p> <p>I was born with the disease I inherited from my father \u2013 it's called responsibility. It prevents me from dropping seeds in random women and not taking care of children like a man should. When it's time for me to have a family, I intend to dedicate my life to that. It's hard to juggle that as an artist and a revolutionary.</p>",
  "<p>John Long couldn't bring himself to vote in the last presidential election. The head of Florida's Tea Party movement despised John McCain and Barack Obama in equal measure.</p> <p>But next month Long will cast a ballot for Mitt Romney even though he regards the Republican presidential candidate as carrying much of the same baggage as McCain. The crucial difference for Long, who is pastor of a church set up for construction workers at Disneyland, is that after four years of Obama he would vote for anyone else. Plus, Romney has one overriding asset.</p> <p>\"The vast majority of people wouldn't have voted for John McCain if he was running unopposed. He was the worst nominee in the history of the United States,\" said Long. \"Romney is better than McCain because McCain didn't have a lick of business sense. For all of the things over which Mitt Romney and I disagree, for all the ways in which he doesn't turn me on, I respect a man who promises to come to Washington and look at the United States government as a business. If Mitt Romney was an abortion supporter, if Mitt Romney favoured gay marriage, if he believed in global warming, I'd still be fine with him if he would go to Washington and run it like a business.\"</p> <p>That view is increasingly expressed, albeit in less trenchant form, by once wavering voters across Florida \u2013 among the most important of swing states for Romney because there is almost no chance of him taking the presidency without winning it.</p> <p>\"I've been in there asking for a job,\" said Bob Brachett, a 38-year-old unemployed man outside a Staples office supply store \u2013 the chain Romney turned into a successful nationwide operation. \"I did vote for Obama last time and I don't think he's a bad president or a bad man. I don't believe a lot of the things they say about him. But the jobs situation is very bad in Florida and I don't see Obama making it better. I'll take a chance on Romney.\"</p> <p>Various branches of the Republican party were for a long time wary of Romney because of what they called the \"3Ms\": Massachusetts, Mormons and money.</p> <p>Social conservatives recoiled from Romney in the Republican primaries because of his support as Massachusetts governor a decade ago for legal abortion and gay rights, and his engineering of healthcare reforms, including a legal requirement to buy medical insurance, which provided the model for Obama's healthcare overhaul.</p> <p>There was great suspicion within the Christian right, which regards Romney's Mormon faith as a cult.</p> <p>More pragmatic elements of the party leadership feared Romney's enormous wealth \u2013 he's worth about $250m \u2013 would cause many ordinary voters to discount him as out of touch with their problems.</p> <p>The Democrats certainly tried to exploit Romney's money: how he made it, where he banked it and how much tax he paid on it. The focus of the attack was Bain Capital, Romney's private equity firm, for shipping jobs to China. The Democrats also latched onto his shifting positions on abortion, gay rights and health care to portray him as insincere and desperate for power. At a campaign stop in Florida earlier this week, Obama repeatedly accused his opponent of being afflicted with \"Romnesia\", which causes him to forget his previous political positions.</p> <p>But less than a fortnight before the election all of that appears to count for less than the Democrats in Florida hoped.</p> <p>The key to the state is Hillsborough County, a fairly diverse area politically, economically and racially that includes the port city of Tampa. No presidential candidate has won the state since 1960 without taking Hillsborough.</p> <p>Obama carried the county with 53% of the vote in 2008, the same margin of victory for George Bush four years earlier.</p> <p>The chairman of Hillsborough's Republican party, Art Wood, is cautious in predicting which way it will go this time. But he regards the election as \"dramatically different\" from four years ago when Republicans found McCain \"hard to embrace\".</p> <p>Wood said he had feared Romney faced the same problem, in part because of the 3Ms, until he shook up the election at the first presidential debate three weeks ago.</p> <p>\"The whole matrix Obama constructed about Romney collapsed with the debate. Obama was doing everything he can not to talk about his performance, not to talk about the economy. He spent months talking about how bad Romney was, how Romney hates women and Romney's in favour of tax cuts for the rich. Nasty labels. And then Romney starts talking and people see he's a decent guy,\" said Wood.</p> <p>\"He's raised five kids that are the all-American family and Obama was raised in Indonesia and Kenya. That matrix, that charade, that whole story he constructed about Romney \u2026 it just started collapsing. It wasn't that Romney was more persuasive. It was that what so many voters thought about Romney collapsed.\"</p> <p>Part of Romney's support is constructed on a visceral dislike of Obama with overtones of racism. Among the more popular Republican campaign signs is: Take Our Country Back.</p> <p>Evangelical preachers have for months been telling their congregations that abstaining in 2008 because they did not like McCain was a disaster that let Obama slip into the White House with an un-American agenda. The message has gone out that not voting is a vote for Obama. The Christian right has embraced it and set aside concerns about Romney's religion and earlier positions on abortion and gay rights.</p> <p>But if Romney takes Florida it will be because of the bounce in the polls that followed the first presidential debate. Romney went from up to nine percentage points behind just a week earlier to <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2012/president/fl/florida_romney_vs_obama-1883.html\">seven points ahead after the first debate</a>.</p> <p>Obama has since narrowed the gap but Romney retains a consistent lead. With the battering to the president's attempts to paint his opponent as incapable and out of touch, many Florida voters appear to have given the Republican candidate a second look.</p> <p>Political scientists say research shows a strengthening support for Romney among women worried about jobs and the impact of the economic crisis on their families.</p> <p>Latinos in Florida voted 57% for Obama four years ago. Now Romney is two percentage points up with them \u2013 despite Obama's claim on Wednesday that they would swing the election in his favour.</p> <p>\"Hispanics are basically Republicans \u2013 except when you get to the immigration issue,\" said Wood. \"What I believe is happening is the Hispanics are willing to make the immigration issue a second-tier issue this time around. It's not that it isn't very important but they realise the matter of jobs is more important this time.\"</p> <p>Wood said the shift since the first debate energised Republicans into believing that perhaps, after all, their man could win.</p> <p>\"There were an incredible number of Republicans [who] stayed home four years ago. The signs are that many of them will now vote,\" he said.</p> <p>Margaret Iuculano, a Republican candidate for county commissioner, said she has knocked on 30,000 doors campaigning over the past year.</p> <p>\"Early on there was a ton of indecisiveness out there. I've seen just a huge turn in the past weeks. Plenty of soft Democrats are voting for Romney,\" she said. \"People are much more educated on some of the issues. Jobs. It's always jobs. It's Romney's business experience that plays well. I have a lot of those conversations.</p> <p>\"I'm praying that what I see is factual and not wishful thinking, but I definitely see a surge in energy. I walked a neighbourhood last weekend with a lot of Republicans who hadn't voted in elections. We knocked on a lot of doors and they mostly said they were coming out to vote. We have to see if they do.\"</p> <p>Democrats have dismissed Republicans claims of a surge in support as \"bluster\", and say they have a well organised \"ground game\" to get supporters out when early voting begins on Saturday that will ultimately deliver the state to Obama. But Democratic activists concede that there does not appear to be the same level of enthusiasm among young voters as there was in 2008 when Obama relied heavily on support in college towns in Florida to win the state.</p> <p>The Democratic strategy to highlight the threat to Medicare \u2013 the government healthcare programme for the elderly \u2013 if Romney is elected also appears not to have had the impact the party hoped in Florida.</p> <p>Susan MacManus, a former chair of the Florida elections commission and a University of South Florida professor of political science, said that is in part because many retired people in the state, who often only move to Florida during the winter for the sun, are prosperous.</p> <p>\"Compared to a senior in Philadelphia or Detroit, the seniors here are younger, healthier, wealthier, better educated. Not as dependent upon Medicare. Plus you also have to take into consideration: seniors vote 42% registered Republicans, 41% Democrats and the rest no party affiliation. They're sticking to their candidate on Medicare. They're not threatened by it,\" she said.</p> <p>MacManus said that her research shows that many retirees are more likely to be concerned about the economy.</p> <p>\"A huge problem for a lot of older voters is the debt. Suddenly they're getting a call from a frantic adult child saying I'm going to lose my home, I can't make they mortgage payment, I lost my job. Retirees were shocked America could be headed toward another great depression. The deficit is a bigger issue here and it's very motivating to people. They really worry about the economic direction of the country,\" she said.</p>",
  "<p><a href=\"http://www.seattleartmuseum.org/\" title=\"\">Seattle Art Museum</a> has done a striking thing. It has <a href=\"http://slog.thestranger.com/slog/archives/2012/10/23/sex-at-seattle-art-museum\" title=\"\">removed all works by modern male artists from its galleries and filled them with works by 20th- and 21st-century women artists</a> from Georgia O'Keeffe to <a href=\"http://www.pipilottirist.net/begin/body.html\" title=\"\">Pipilotti Rist</a>.</p> <p>Works of art by <a href=\"http://www.pbs.org/wnet/americanmasters/episodes/jasper-johns/about-the-painter/54/\" title=\"\">Jasper Johns</a> and Jackson <a href=\"http://www.nga.gov/feature/pollock/\" title=\"\">Pollock</a> have gone into storage.

After all, patriarchy is not the personal fault of, say, <a href=\"http://www.rauschenbergfoundation.org/\" title=\"\">Robert Rauschenberg</a> \u2013 another of Seattle's vanished dead white males. Rauschenberg is a highly original, compelling artist whose work inspires artists today \u2013 male and female alike. One young artist who seems to me to work in his tradition is, for instance, <a href=\"http://i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01392/Lucy-Skaer-The-Sie_1392868i.jpg\" title=\"\">Lucy Skaer</a>.</p> <p>In fact, the stunt in Seattle is only for a few months: the big macho names will be back in town soon enough. But still. This is a slightly old-fashioned political art gesture, surely?</p> <p>Maybe not.</p> <p>The story of art is an iceberg of gender inequality, a daunting frozen mass of male power. Before the 20th century, the apprenticeships and academic training required to learn representational skills put chilling obstacles in the way of women, who were excluded from such institutions. In the 20th century, the ice started to melt \u2013 but arguably this created more insidious and hypocritical forms of inequality.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://life.time.com/culture/jackson-pollock-rare-unpublished/#2\" title=\"\">relationship of Lee Krasner and Jackson Pollock</a> is a case in point. Krasner was a talented painter who also happened to be better educated and more socially competent than Pollock. She ended up supporting him emotionally and nurturing him, as he struggled with alcoholism: her reward in art history is to be second best to his fame.</p> <p>These kinds of relationships stalk modern American art. Read biographies and it often seems women stuffed the floppy hamburgers, helped with the prints ... <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Women-Art-Society-World/dp/0500203938\" title=\"\">and were sidelined</a>.</p> <p>Still, the Seattle method is clumsy. Krasner's art does not need special pleading \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.spaniermanmodern.com/06_LIAbstraction/krasner06noonf_lg.jpg\" title=\"\">it has an unmistakable power</a>. Why not simply show her and Pollock side by side?</p> <p>Pollock's genius was real, if fragile: to sideline him is foolish. A museum that owns a Pollock and chooses not to display it is making a mistake. Bury excellence and you end up denying the power of art. That helps no artist.</p>",
  "<p>\"You know about Gangnam Style, right?\" asked the senior South Korean Google exec, when I found myself in Seoul two weeks ago \u2013 her first question. But, while the huge viral success of Psy's hit has created a whole genre of jockey-based dance moves, Gangnam is a place, too.</p> <p>It's the Mayfair of Seoul, the high-rise district of the city just south of the river. Although it does feature one large and rather beautiful temple, Bongeun, for the most part, Gangnam is an upmarket shopping area, home to the enormous underground COEX mall (where part of the video was filmed) and the nearby boutique-lined streets of Apgujeong-dong. To see the historic Seoul, you have to cross the river, but that's not the point of Gangnam.</p> <p>The point of Gangnam is to be seen there, and the streets are full of young, well-dressed teens mingling with the super-rich of the city. Seoul is the capital of Korea; Gangnam is, as Psy says, the capital of Seoul. It's so expensive that it accounts for almost 10% of the land value of the entire country.</p> <p>The Gangnam Style phenomenon has shone a western light on K-pop too, the genre of slick, mass-produced teen-idol boy and girl bands that dominate the south-east Asian music scene. You might not have heard of it before Psy, but K-pop videos were viewed more than two billion times in 2011. The future of British pop may include acts such as A Pink and B2ST too.</p> <p>Only the very wealthy can afford to live in Gangnam \u2013 not the kids in the latest styles who hang around its huge malls.

  "<p>Apple's launch of a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/oct/23/ipad-mini-apple-tablet-google-amazon\" title=\"\">smaller, cheaper iPad</a> this week generated a global hullabaloo, but for one Chinese businessman in Brazil, it cannot have seemed quite so extraordinary.</p> <p>Paulo Xu had been there and done that \u2013 a year earlier and for half the price \u2013 with a 300-reais (\u00a3100) tablet computer that has brought the internet into hundreds of thousands of low-income homes for the first time.</p> <p>The technology may have been less advanced, but the simple device showed how new combinations of manufacturing nous and marketing opportunities are changing the face of the electronics industry in emerging economies.</p> <p>With the European market in crisis and production costs rising in China, Latin America is an increasingly attractive proposition for many major firms seeking new areas of growth. In recent weeks, BMW, Foxconn and Hyundai have announced major new investments in Brazil.</p> <p>Xu arrived many years earlier and has since built one of Brazil's fastest growing computer companies.</p> <p>Born Xu Wei to a middle-class family in Nantong, Jiangsu province, he came to Brazil in 1994, adopted the name Paulo, and started out in the kitchen of a Japanese restaurant, where he says he worked 17 hours a day and earned 450 reais a month.</p> <p>But like his idol, Li Ka Shing \u2013 Asia's richest man \u2013 he had ambitions to become an entrepreneur. Xu opened a restaurant, then a gift shop, then moved into consumer electronics by forming a new company, Digital Life, in 2004.</p> <p>He started out with car audio equipment and moved into the tablet business a few years ago, getting technical advice from manufacturers in China. Many components are made in his homeland, but all the assembly work is done in Brazil, which enables him to qualify for generous tax breaks.</p> <p>To avoid competition with higher-end devices made by multinational brands, Digital Life aims at the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/18/avenida-brasil-clash-president-cancel-rally\" title=\"\">growing niche of low-income consumers</a>.</p> <p>Thanks to strong economic growth, government wealth redistribution polices and \u2013 sometimes alarmingly \u2013 extended credit lines, this group are starting to buy smartphones, motorbikes and other products that were unavailable to them before.</p> <p>Digital Life's cheapest tablet computer, which retails for 300 reais (\u00a393), has an 800 MHz processor, four gigabytes of memory, an 18cm (7in) screen and a wireless modem. Unusually for a tablet, it also has a port for a cable connection because many purchasers do not want to pay extra for routers.</p> <p>Despite a slowdown of the Brazilian economy in 2012 to about 2%, Xu expects sales of his low-price tablet to increase tenfold this year to 1m units, and to rise to 2.5m by 2014.</p> <p>\"When it comes to the Chinese and Brazilian markets, my advice is to bet on the economy and work honestly. That always gives a return,\" he says.</p> <p>His business owes much to the model that made China the workshop of the world: importing hi-tech components from overseas and assembling them cheaply.</p> <p>In his case, this is being done on a medium scale at a factory in Minas Gerais. But multinationals are starting to follow suit.</p> <p>With costs rising in China and the Latin American market growing, several big manufacturers are expanding their operations in Brazil.</p> <p>Taiwan's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/foxconn\" title=\"\">Foxconn</a>, which assembles products for Apple and others, is moving more of its operations from China. Since opening its first factory in Brazil last year, it has ramped up production. Last month, it announced a 1bn reais plan to build its seventh plant in Brazil. The megafacility in S\u00e3o Paulo will assemble smartphones and tablet computers and provide 10,000 jobs.</p> <p>China's Chery Automobile recently unveiled a $400m investment in a new factory in S\u00e3o Paulo that will have the capacity to produce 150,000 vehicles per year once it is finished towards the end of 2013.</p> <p>This week, BMW announced plans to build its first car plant in Latin America. Construction will begin next April on the $264 factory in Araquari. South Korea's Hyundai and Samsung are also working on new factories in Brazil.</p> <p>Brazil is in dire need of more manufacturing to rebalance an economy that is over-reliant on exports of commodities such as soy, iron ore and oil. China is its main customer for raw materials and greatest competitor for manufactured goods. For most of the past decade, cheap Chinese goods have dominated.</p> <p>This has been a similar story in much of Latin America, but there are signs that this may be changing as the costs of doing business in China start to rise because of improved labour regulations and a stronger currency. According to a recent study by JP Morgan, labour costs in Mexico and China are now almost equal \u2013 a dramatic change since 2003, when the latter was three times cheaper.</p> <p>But Brazil still has to catch up. Compared with China, Xu says, Brazil has more bureaucracy, less developed supply chains and weaker industrial promotion policies.</p> <p>Nonetheless, with the Chinese market more saturated and competitive, he sees the greatest future opportunities in Brazil.</p> <p>\"The Brazilian market is very big and diverse because Brazilians like new things, especially technology. Chinese consumers are more conservative,\" he says. \"All the expansions that we are planning will be made right here in Brazil.\"</p> <p><em>Additional reporting by Carolina Massote</em></p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 28 October 2012 to correct Paulo Xu's given name.</p>",

I don't know what you do about that. It's easier to deny.\"</p> <p>Asked what was needed to wake people up, the veteran broadcaster famous for series such as <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Life_Collection\" title=\"\">Life</a> and <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006mywy\" title=\"\">Planet Earth</a> said: \"Disaster. It's a terrible thing to say, isn't it? Even disaster doesn't do it. There have been disasters in North America, with hurricanes and floods, yet still people deny and say 'oh, it has nothing to do with climate change.' It visibly has got [something] to do with climate change.\"</p> <p>But some US politicians found it easier to deny the science on climate change than take action, he said, because the consequence of recognising the science on man-made climate change \"means a huge section from the national budget will be spent in order to deal with it, plenty of politicians will be happy to say 'don't worry about that, we're not going to increase your taxes.'\"</p> <p>Neither Barack Obama or Mitt Romney mentioned climate change in three TV debates, despite a summer of record temperatures and historic drought in the US.</p> <p>Romney used Obama's commitment to taking action on climate change <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/aug/31/mitt-romney-acceptance-speech-hope\" title=\"\">as a joke in his convention speech</a>. The president later <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/sep/07/barack-obama-mitt-romney-climate\" title=\"\">hit back by saying</a> \"and yes, my plan will continue to reduce the carbon pollution that is heating our planet because climate change is not a hoax. More droughts and floods and wildfires are not a joke.\" However, environmentalists have been critical of Obama's silence on the subject and the Green party presidential candidate, Jill Stein, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/oct/22/us-elections-barack-obama-climate-denial\" title=\"\">went as far as saying</a> it meant he was, in effect, \"another climate denier\".</p> <p>Attenborough said he thought the US's attitude towards climate change and the environment was not just because of politics, but because of the country's history. \"[It's] because they're a pioneer country. There has been the wild west, the western frontier\u2026 that's still there, you see it in the arms business, the right for everyone to bear arms. It's part of the pioneer stuff that you've [Americans] grown up with.\"</p> <p>By contrast, he said, people in the UK had \"grown up with a mythology of black industry and wrecking the countryside.\"</p> <p>The current financial crisis has made it problematic for politicians to show leadership on climate change, Attenborough acknowledged. \"Well it's a very difficult time to do it [show leadership]. In times of recession, it's a very difficult time to advance these arguments [on the urgency of tackling climate change] that mean you have to spend even more money and take money from taxes to do things,\" he said.</p> <p>Yet he also warned that it was becoming clear the impacts of climate change were worst than had been expected. Talking about the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/sep/19/arctic-ice-shrinks\" title=\"\">record Arctic sea ice melt this summer</a>, he said: \"The situation is worse than we thought [in the Arctic]. The processes of melting are more volatile than we thought. More complicated. The ice cap is really melting faster than we thought.\"</p> <p>The 86-year-old naturalist, who is also a patron of the charity <a href=\"http://www.populationmatters.org/\" title=\"\">Population Matters</a>, said many of the environmental problems the world faced could be helped by addressing human population, which is <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/oct/31/seven-billionth-baby-born-philippines\" title=\"\">believed to have reached the 7 billion mark last year</a>, and is forecast to reach 10 billion by the middle of the century.</p> <p>The solution, he said, was to raise living standards and increase democracy in developing countries. \"The only way I can think of it [tackling population] is by giving women the rights to control their own bodies and control how many children they have. In every circumstance where women have that right, where they have the vote, where they are proper medical facilities, where they are literate, where they are given the choice, the birth rate falls,\" he said. \"That is a good start, if that could be spread.\"</p> <p>\u2022 You can read more of Sir David Attenborough's views on climate change and animals in this Sunday's Observer magazine</p>",

  "<p>I am just old enough to remember something of the coronation of 1953. We watched a film of it, in colour. A few months later we saw another film, <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0045646/\" title=\"\"><em>The Conquest of Everest</em></a>, by George Lowe and Tom Stobart. It had a commentary by Louis MacNeice. In my&#xa0;childish understanding, the coronation and the ascent of Everest became one and the same thing.</p> <p>Mick Conefrey's moving book confirms that the coronation and the conquest of Everest were indeed knowingly yoked together. Jan Morris, then a young journalist for the <em>Times</em>, helped get hastily coded dispatches, confirming that Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay had reached the summit, to London just in time for the coronation. It was immediately understood to be a huge boost to British prestige and a tonic after the war and rationing. In some ways it reminds me of the recent Olympics and the jubilee, with reality stretched to encompass some uniquely British qualities. The Indians and the Nepalese joined in vigorously, both claiming Tenzing a hero and a native son. In fact, Tenzing was born in Tibet. Conefrey describes this frenetic scramble for ownership of the&#xa0;mountain brilliantly.</p> <p>But how could a mountain which straddled the border between Tibet and Nepal be considered British? And why did it have the name of a British man, Sir George Everest, who had been surveyor-general of India from 1830 to 1843? The truth was that the British climbers regarded themselves as the aristocracy of the sport, and through the Indian connection Everest was thought to be more or less within the sphere of British interest.</p> <p>The climb was some years in the planning. Operating from the Royal Geographical Society, the Himalayan committee wanted to see a British conquest after many failures and many&#xa0;deaths, as far back as George Mallory's and Andrew Irvine's mysterious disappearance in 1924, a subject of Wade Davis's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/sep/25/into-silence-wade-davis-review\" title=\"\">brilliant book of last year</a>, <em>Into the Silence</em>.</p> <p>To carry out their \"great cause\", the committee appointed Mr Everest, Eric Shipton, as leader. In 1952 a group of hand-picked climbers, including the New Zealander Edmund Hillary, went to Cho Oyu in the Himalayas to prepare and test equipment for the following year. But the legendary Shipton proved to have little organisational know-how and no interest in the notion of \"the great cause\"; the expedition was a shambles and he was sacked rather ineptly. John Hunt, a colonel in the army, was recruited as leader. He proved to be just the man for the job, meticulous in his planning and a relentlessly hard worker, as well as a good climber. He very soon endeared himself to the others.</p> <p>In the meantime, the pressure was on: the Swiss were mounting an expedition that included Tenzing Norgay. They got within 600 metres of&#xa0;the summit before giving up, but they were planning to come back in 1954 if the British failed.</p> <p>The first British attempt, on 26 May 1953, was to be made by Tom Bourdillon and Charles Evans. Despite the meticulous preparation, it was fraught with difficulty; the weather was appalling and the climb from the South Col was terribly difficult. In the end a defective oxygen canister meant that they had to turn back only a few hundred metres from the top. For the rest of his life Bourdillon regretted that&#xa0;he hadn't gone on alone. But he had heeded Evans's warning that if he did he would never see his wife again. He was killed climbing in the Alps some years later.</p> <p>Hillary and Tenzing were the next up. They set off confidently towards the South Col, where they just managed to get a tent up in a gale and temperatures of -20C. They didn't sleep. In the morning they had a problem with the oxygen, and finally left their tent at 7am. Hillary's diaries show that they were determined to make it, no matter what the risks. At the final 40ft rock wall, Hillary forced himself through a narrow crack in the rocks and ice, overhung by a huge and unstable cornice. Tenzing followed. Hillary now believed they were going to make it. But after an hour he started wondering if he could go on. Then the going suddenly improved and he saw that the snow ahead was sloping away from him towards Tibet. They had made it. Hillary's famous pictures show Tenzing holding his axe,&#xa0;flying the small flags he had brought with him. The two of them stayed 18 minutes on the summit. Typically, Hillary did not ask Tenzing to take a picture of him.</p> <p>What had happened on the last few hundred yards became the subject of controversy. Did Tenzing drag Hillary up, or was it the other way round? The Indians and the Nepalese boldly and falsely claimed that Tenzing was first up, 40 metres of rope between them. In fact Tenzing was suffering badly, and Hillary had to help him, something which Tenzing admitted much later. But Hillary and Tenzing and all the others knew that climbing was a team effort: on the way down, Tenzing had to pull Hillary from a deep crevasse. After three months on the mountain, Hunt was overcome with relief and happiness as he greeted his men.</p> <p>Hillary was knighted, as was John Hunt, while Tenzing got the George Medal; there was talk of colonial attitudes. All three were worldwide celebrities. They met everybody who was anybody, including the newly crowned Queen and Prince Philip. Tenzing was deified in Nepal and India.&#xa0;It does not appear to have brought him happiness: although he was given a large house and a prestigious job as head of a mountaineering academy, he died in Darjeeling in 1986, depressed and with a drink problem. John Hunt went on to run the Duke of Edinburgh's Award&#xa0;and the parole service. Some years later he was made a life peer. Hillary became New Zealand's high commissioner to India.</p> <p>As I read the book, I often found myself deeply moved. It is a tale of great courage, and \u2013 poignantly \u2013 of a world that has passed.</p> <p><em>Justin Cartwright's most recent novel is </em><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/fiction/9781408803882/other-peoples-money\" title=\"\"><em>Other People's Money</em></a><em> (Bloomsbury)</em></p>",
  "<p>Early this month saw the tenth birthday of<a href=\"http://www.lassn.org.uk \"> Leeds Asylum Seekers' Support Network (LASSN) </a>and they have got a new website to celebrate. Before enjoying that, though, we had the annual general meeting \u2013 the boring bit but necessary for legal reasons. </p> <p>I am so glad that all this is now behind me; I did over 20 years of committee meetings: council, school governors, charities. I'm glad that I did, as I like to think that some of them made a difference, but enough is enough and I am now very happy to be a volunteer and nothing more. </p> <p>We heard from someone who had been in at the very beginning of LASSN, over ten years ago, before the charity itself was officially launched. She made the point that we all hope not to be here in another ten years' time, but we fear that the need will be just as great then as it is now. Conflict around the world does not lessen just because the European Union has <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/oct/12/european-union-nobel-peace-prize\">won the Nobel peace prize.</a><br>&#xa0;<br>Then came the party: lovely food cooked by a local couple who were born in East Africa and have lived in Leeds for many decades. It was good to share experiences, both happy and sad, with other volunteers. Some were Short Stop hosts, some English-at-home tutors&#xa0;and others befrienders. We also talked of other things: holidays (I had just returned from another train trip across Europe, this time to Porto), and dogs (other people's, I don't have one as regular readers may have guessed).<br>&#xa0;<br>Earlier in the day I had visited my asylum-seeking friend, still waiting to hear&#xa0;when and to where she will be moved. No news may be good news, but can also be very stressful and for her at present it is the latter.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398322825\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Books/Pix/pictures/2009/9/9/1252498040613/Grasmere-in-the-Lake-Dist-005.jpg\" alt=\"Grasmere in the Lake District\" width=\"140\" height=\"130\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Grasmere, where the Quakers run Glenthorne guest house.

We reminisced about a lovely holiday they had all had in the Lakes, in a guest house owned by the&#xa0;local <a href=\"http:// www.quaker.org.uk\">Society of Friends</a>. Everything had been paid for by the Friends, including a boat trip on Derwentwater. By coincidence I had <a href=\"http://www.glenthorne.org/\">stayed there as a paying guest</a> whilst I was doing the Coast to Coast walk two years ago. I remembered the food being very good and they agreed with me. It was lovely to relax and talk about ordinary things, far removed from current strain and stress.</p> <p>The following week, I was on duty with what used to be Short Stop and is now called the Grace Project, an amalgamation of two linked schemes, Short Stop and Long Stop, both offering emergency accommodation for homeless asylum seekers, one for one night only, the other for longer. LASSN&#xa0;has decided to merge them and to use the name Grace in honour of an early user of short Stop many years ago.</p> <p>Now settled in Leeds, she has become a trustee of LASSN and an enthusiastic advocate of both short Stop and Long Stop. </p> <p>Just one person to be placed this week. My first call is to one of our regular hosts who is unwell but tells me that if I can find nobody else she can help. She has anawful cough and cold, like the one I have just got over, so it's a relief that my next call is answered with a cheery \"Of course.\" I phone the referring agency <a href=\"http://www.pafras.org.uk\">Positive Action For Refugees and Asylum Seekers </a>&#xa0;back and that is all for the day. The nights are becoming colder and longer so the Grace project becomes more and more vital.</p> <p>The next day dawned in gloom and pouring rain but the forecast promised sun later, so it was on with the waterproofs and off to Runswick Bay.&#xa0;We<a href=\"http://www.moortoseacycle.net/content.php?nid=321&amp;offset=0&amp;cID=2&amp;mID=8\"> Coasties volunteers</a>&#xa0;were continuing to carve a path, which only seems to exist on the map, through bracken, bramble and our old friend, blackthorn. It had been started with cutting steps many months ago and more steps will be needed on this stretch, but today it is too wet. However by 11am the rain has stopped and an hour later, the sun and the midges are out.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398322826\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/25/1351140779105/janice2.jpg\" alt=\"janice gwilliam\" width=\"460\" height=\"345\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Whoa, stop!

He was speaking to our colleague Mona Mahmood via Skype.</p> <p>He confirmed that the Kurdish district was taken over by the FSA under a deal with the Kurdish PKK party.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Brigades of the FSA were able to progress from al-Ashrafiyeh district where the Criminal Security branch is. There was also progress in al-Midan and Sulaiman al-Halabi districts. The [government] branch responsible for raids is in al-Midan district. These two branches are the biggest in Aleppo.</p> <p>Till now the clashes which started at 10am today are continuing and many district have been stormed by the FSA to get towards these two branches. Earlier news claimed that these two branches were taken by the FSA but the truth is the FSA fighters are surrounding these branches and they have still not taken them yet. We are working to get inside them.</p> <p>In Khan al-Assal district, there is a police school which was under siege by the FSA for 10 days now. The Syrian army were sending reinfocrements every day to ease the siege on it. Today a convoy was heading towards the school and was faced by fire from the FSA and could not get there.</p> <p>As for al-Ashrafiyeh district, it was controlled by [the Kurdish] PKK party and the Syrian army. The FSA were in Bani Zaid which is at the entrance to al-Ashrafiyeh. The FSA had to take al-Ashrafiyeh district to be able to reach the Criminal branch \u2013 and they did. The advance now is just around the Criminal Security and it is not easy to get control.</p> <p>If we talk about Aleppo and the countryside, the FSA are in control of 90% of the ground but when it comes to Aleppo as a city, the FSA are in control of 60% of the ground to 40% for the Syrian army.</p> <p>There are spots of power for the Syrian army like the Criminal Security in al-Ashrafiyeh, Political Security in al-Azziziyeh and Air Force security and intelligence in New Aleppo, in addition to the \"raids\" branch which is one of the biggest security branches in Aleppo.</p> <p>If the FSA can liberate all these branches, we can say at that time that Aleppo has been liberated entirely.</p> <p>At the beginning of the attack today, the Syrian army tried to stop the advance but they could not sustain it for long and they pulled out. Some of them left their weapons and ran away, others were killed.</p> <p>In Khan al-Assal, the FSA fighters were able to take some Syrian army soldiers as prisoners.</p> <p>For a long time, al-Ashrafiyeh and Sheikh Maqsoud districts were under the control of the PKK which is in alliance with Assad's regime (it helps in detaining members of FSA and hands them over to the Syrian army).</p> <p>At the beginning we did not plan to open a front from this direction \u2013 I mean al-Ashrafiyeh \u2013 to avoid any clashes with the PKK. Our target is the regime.</p> <p>The PKK had agreed not to interfere and not to support any side of the confilct. We did not attack any members of the PKK [today], in fact they pulled out to clear the way for us. It was a deal that they would pull out before the arrival of the FSA. The clashes were with the Syrian army only.</p> <p>The PKK accepted the deal after a lot of pressure from the Kurdish people. Lately, many buses loaded with Kurdish people from Afreen, 70km northwest of Aleppo, were attacked at random by the Syrian army thinking they are coming from Izzaz.</p> <p>Since the beginning of the revolution the regime has been trying to keep the PKK on its side but I think now it is going to lose them.</p> <p>More than 300 fighters from al-Fattah brigade, Tawheed brigade and Ahrar Syria brigades took part in the operation today.

The road is packed with people trying to get back to Bani Walid but the army is turning them away.</p> <p>While we were there things got very heated. The army started opening fire - the bullets seemed to be going over our heads. People were running, children were screaming. It was pandemonium and I think things are getting worse. Army checkpoints in Tripoli are insisting people [who had fled the violence in Bani Walid] can go home. Now we have thousands and thousands of people backed up along this road, very very angry that they are not being allowed back in.</p> </blockquote> <p>Pro-Gaddafi fighters continue to put up resistance, according to the authorities, despite declaring an end to the battle for the town, Chris said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Soldiers outside the town said they are still house clearing and they still fear there are suspected pockets of resistance. The commanders in the town have obviously decided they don\u2019t want anyone back in. They want to tamp the town down. But the trouble is the Libyan government is giving a very different message, and putting out [messages] on television saying [residents of Bani Walid] can go home.</p> <p>The government has said all along that their target was not the people of Bani Walid, but that the town had become a magnet for all the former Gaddafi regime people elsewhere in Libya, because it was the one area of the country that had no government control. The whole point of the exercise was to hunt these people down. Apparently several dozen have been arrested, including some quite prominent former officials. These people were fighting very hard because they know they face trial and execution if they surrender.</p> <p>It feels as if the army has triggered a second conflict by refusing to let people back in.&#xa0;</p> </blockquote> <p>The clashes caught UN humanitarian aid workers en route to the town by surprise, Chris reported. \u201cThey were stunned to hear this is going on,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The people of Bani Walid were already furious at the assault on the town, and the current confusion over whether they can return will only add to the tension, Chris said.</p> <p>The fight for Bani Walid has been a \u201chuge set back for the Libyan authorities\u201d, he added.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The operation against Bani Walid was supposed to be the new parliament showing that it could be sensible and that it could run the country. They wanted to say that everyone can go home and now they are stopping people going home. This is going to antagonise everyone and its going to cause a fresh new cycle of violence.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-canonical-url=\"\" >  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;ab-player&quot; data-boourl=&quot;http://audioboo.fm/boos/1024790-renewed-clashes-outside-bani-walid-as-army-prevents-return-of-angry-residents-and-pro-gaddafi-forces-resist-says-chris-stephen/embed&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://audioboo.fm/boos/1024790-renewed-clashes-outside-bani-walid-as-army-prevents-return-of-angry-residents-and-pro-gaddafi-forces-resist-says-chris-stephen&quot;&gt;listen to \u2018Renewed clashes outside Bani Walid as army prevents return of angry residents and pro-Gaddafi forces resist, says Chris Stephen\u2019 on Audioboo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;(function() { var po = document.createElement(&quot;script&quot;); po.type = &quot;text/javascript&quot;; po.async = true; po.src = &quot;http://d15mj6e6qmt1na.cloudfront.net/assets/embed.js&quot;; var s = document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;)[0]; s.parentNode.insertBefore(po, s); })();&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-6f0b1666-228e-4186-ba93-a330750e28b3\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/25/1351162923227/9e01f506-7c03-4618-b613-902e6613f041-460.jpeg\" alt=\"Libyan militia fighters aligned with the defence ministry celebrate on top of a building in the centre of the former Gaddafi stronghold of Bani Walid October 24, 2012.

  "<p>Growing up in 1980s Bradford, I always knew I'd take the traditional route to marriage. If I harboured teenage dreams of walking down the aisle to marry a man I loved, then my fantasy was blighted by the insurmountable burden of breaking away from my family. Besides, I'd always known I was lined up to marry a cousin \u2013 my uncle's son.</p> <p>He was as good a suitor as any. I reasoned that an educated, outgoing, well-travelled professional would make the sort of husband who would afford me the freedom to pursue my own career.</p> <p>British Muslim friends who had married before me warned of the importance of considering the environment that I'd be marrying into. For instance, living independently was always preferable since it limited day-to-day interference from the in-laws. The size of household was worth thinking about. I didn't want to have to please too many in-laws or spend too long in the kitchen. I also needed to consider my future mother-in-law's disposition because her backing could make or break the union.</p> <p>My mother had her own criteria. She wanted a son-in-law of good stock, who was respectable and responsible with the sort of traditional career that would always pay the mortgage \u2013 my mum's way of offering me long-term security.</p> <p>The suitor's social class was critical. Rather than a union between two individuals, this was a family merger, so mum needed to ensure the bond was sustainable. While we would never marry beneath us, we also didn't want the pressure of keeping up appearances by forming an alliance with people above our station.</p> <p>Mum has several cousins in her ancestral village in Pakistan who never married because their families couldn't identify men of a suitable social class for them. In a couple of cases, property was the issue. Since the bride takes a share of her father's property to her new family, a daughter's betrothal outside existing kinship networks can create a division of wealth, which is usually unwelcome. The same practice was prevalent among British nobility during Elizabethan times, when marriages were seen as alliances between two families which also helped to preserve prestige and wealth.</p> <p>Marriages like mine were based entirely on practicalities rather than emotions. Perhaps that's why we never talked about love when I was growing up. In fact, love is still the elephant in the room among Pakistani women of my mum's generation. They shun the subject as a weakness or \u2013 worse still \u2013 as a western concept which threatens to destabilise their preferred system of making marriages. This was certainly the case during my ill-fated relationship. I had presumed love would grow naturally; if I complained about its absence, I was told it was patience and staying power I lacked.</p> <p>I wanted to understand this attitude, so I set out to explore the experience of love and marriage among different generations of Muslim women in and around Bradford. The first generation \u2013 the ones that married migrant mill workers like my father during the 1950s and 1960s \u2013 talked about marriage rather than love, viewing the latter as a frivolity rather than a vital ingredient. There was little time for coupledom in their marriages, it seems, and love was something that took place in the dead of night, strictly behind closed doors.</p> <p>Rukeeya (not her real name) is now in her late 60s. She was 17 when her marriage was arranged with a family associate in Karachi, where she spent several years living with in-laws, before her husband secured work in Bradford. Not dwelling on love and happiness, she says, was a survival technique because \"it was out of your hands\". Instead, Rukeeya focused on being an ideal daughter-in-law which involved \"forsaking my own wishes in favour of others\" and \"keeping your tongue in check\".</p> <p>Changing attitudes appear to be driven largely by the British-born daughters of the migrant mill workers. Longstanding models of marriage, which offer security and family approval, are still dominant. What is different though is that British Muslim women like 45-year-old Noreen (not her real name) are now recognising and articulating their emotional needs:</p> <p>\"You know that passionate fantasised love inside a woman? I don't feel that kind of love. It's a different love altogether. It's a caring love. It's kicked in now in my life as we've got older, as I've got used to my husband's way of life.\"</p> <p>Perhaps it's because their mothers didn't talk to them about love, that the first generation of British-born Pakistani women are keen to ensure that their daughters prioritise emotional wellbeing when it's their time to choose a life partner.</p> <p>\u2022 Irna Qureshi's latest work, <a href=\"http://www.brad.ac.uk/theatre/whats-on/BHM/Cartographies-of-love/\" title=\"\">Cartographies of Love</a>, is a live performance based on intimate conversations with three generations of Muslim women in West Yorkshire.</p>",
  "<p>Anyone looking at the history of Britain's postwar far right is going to ask themselves these questions. Why did a clearly neo-fascist party emerge so strongly in the 1970s, less than a generation after fascism's defeat? Why, nonetheless, did this party's vote collapse in the 1979 general election? Ten years on, with the far right mushrooming all over Europe, why did the British far-right remain so invisible? And why, after the BNP did begin to make electoral gains in the first decade of this century, did its support haemorrhage at the last election \u2013 if, indeed, it did?</p> <p>In <em>Bloody Nasty People</em> (the pun is the Sun's), <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/daniel-trilling\" title=\"\">Daniel Trilling</a> addresses these issues in a brisk but compelling narrative. The story goes like this. In 1967, a number of obscure far-right grouplets combined to form the National Front. Emboldened by <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HP7fETsKYkA\" title=\"\">Enoch Powell's 1968 \"rivers of blood\" speech</a> (and the Heath government's admission of 27,000 Asians expelled from Uganda in 1972), the party was hijacked by neo-Nazi <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2005/jul/20/otherparties.thefarright\" title=\"\">John Tyndall</a>, who presided over an expansion of membership and votes, but no seats, in local elections in the 70s. Subject to an ideological and physical assault from the antifascist movement, and outflanked by a resurgent, rightwing conservative leadership, the Front was humiliated at the 1979 general election.</p> <p>During the 80s, the Front was taken over by a racial-mystic, quasi-terrorist faction, inspired by the Italian fascist \"strategy of tension\" which had led to the death of 86 people in Bologna's railway station bomb of 1980. Meanwhile, Tyndall saw his new British National Party as a more traditional neo-fascist alternative. Under his plodding leadership, the BNP failed to exploit anger at the Salman Rushdie fatwa, and \u2013 facing continued antifascist action \u2013 found itself increasingly unable to organise. Forced by these circumstances to return to the ballot box, the BNP won a single council seat \u2013 under the slogan \"Rights for Whites\" \u2013 in<a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/september/17/newsid_2520000/2520085.stm\" title=\"\"> Tower Hamlets in 1993</a>.</p> <p>Derek Beackon's victory was shortlived, but it provided a kind of dress rehearsal for what was to come. By 1999, Tyndall had been deposed by Cambridge graduate \u2013 and eager Holocaust-denier \u2013<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/nick-griffin\" title=\"\"> Nick Griffin</a>, who set about \"modernising\" the party by dropping its most obviously risible, and contemptible, policy, the compulsory repatriation of Britain's entire non-white population. Like the NF in the 70s, the Griffin BNP was double coded, providing \"a sense of belonging to something very special\" to its core activists, while persuading \"ordinary electors\" that it was \"just another choice on the political scene\". It was this publicly sanitised party which was able to exploit the 2001 Oldham, Burnley and Bradford riots (all of them provoked by the threat or fact of far-right assaults on Asian communities), first in the 2001 general election (in which Griffin won 16.4% of the vote in Oldham West) and then in a series of council election victories across the ex-industrial north, the Midlands, and London. By 2003 the BNP had 14 councillors, and, by 2006, 44. With a membership of over 10,000, the party won nearly a million votes in the 2009 European parliament elections, and two seats.</p> <p>Despite all this, incompetent and often absent councillors combined with Griffin's bowel-shrivelling performance on <em>Question Time</em> to undermine the BNP's gains. In 2010, Griffin failed to unseat (or even seriously dent) Margaret Hodge in Barking, where a highly successful grassroots campaign also deprived the party of all of its 12 councillors. After Trilling finished his book, the English local elections of 2012 saw no BNP gains and six losses. There are now only three BNP councillors remaining.</p> <p>Telling this tale, Trilling challenges much conventional wisdom. First, he contests the idea that the BNP is exclusively a Labour heresy (as Ukip is seen as a Eurosceptic Tory bolthole). In Burnley, the BNP's vote was targeted by activists scouring the Yellow Pages for self-employed builders, joiners and mechanics; their highest vote was in outlying, Tory-voting villages (as it was in Yorkshire; for a period, the Bront\u00ebs' Haworth was represented by the BNP).</p> <p>Second, Trilling questions the notion that the best way to beat the BNP is to steal its thunder. He insists that it was the empty Liberal Democrat promise to prioritise Tower Hamlets' \"sons and daughters\" for council housing which legitimised the BNP's rhetoric and opened the door for their short-lived 1993 victory. The party's anti-asylum campaign was helped by William Hague's anti-immigration \"foreign land\" speech in 2000. By giving credence to the BNP's case against \"Africans\" supposedly moving in on Barking social housing, he argues, Hodge contributed to the BNP's victory in the 2006 local elections. By contrast, in 2010, her campaign admitted Labour's responsibility for the root cause, the shortage of public housing for everybody.</p> <p>The \"fertile ground\" from which the BNP reaped electoral success was ploughed not just by politicians but by the press. The early 21st century saw not just a remorseless tabloid crusade against asylum-seekers, but the Daily Telegraph's equally implacable struggle against the Macpherson report, the concept of institutional racism, and the bogey of \"political correctness\", all of which was echoed in the BNP's propaganda.</p> <p>Finally, Trilling questions the idea that the threat has passed. The anti-fascist movement has proved highly effective in keeping the BNP vote below winning level. But the BNP still won 563,743 votes at the 2010 general election and gained a higher average vote in the constituencies it contested than in 2005. The emergence of the English Defence League \u2013 conceived by a City investment banker, a Christian fundamentalist and a former BNP activist, yet ostensibly anti-homophobic, racially plural and pro-Israel \u2013 demonstrates that even the British far right can change with the times. Polling on attitudes to immigration and&#xa0;multiculturalism suggests \u2013 at the very least \u2013 that the far right has not exploited its full electoral potential, even within a system notoriously unfriendly to minority parties. With a leader as effective as Le Pen <em>p\u00e8re</em> or <em>fille</em>, or even \u2013 merely \u2013 a leadership which doesn't issue death threats to each other during election campaigns, might not a new far-right grouping turn its back on violence and gain as much purchase as equivalent parties in&#xa0;continental Europe?</p> <p>One answer to this question is that, for all their ideological contortions, the BNP, the EDL and their various splinters are fascists, and violence is what fascists do. The far right failed to take off as a serious electoral force in the 1970s, and it's failed again now. But&#xa0;that shouldn't tempt us to lower our guard.</p> <p>\u2022 David Edgar's most recent play was <em>Written on the Heart</em>.</p>",

If you're interested in APIs, you'll find it interesting.</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.mobilemoneyrevolution.co.uk/omg-now-o2-has-launched-a-mobile-card-reader/\">OMG... now O2 has launched a mobile card reader &gt;&gt; Mobile Money Revolution</a></h2> <blockquote> <p>On the day that <a href=\"http://www.mobilemoneyrevolution.co.uk/izettle-raises-more-funds-prepares-full-uk-launch/\">iZettle confirms its intention to launch in the UK</a>, Brit operator O2 has confirmed that it too is launching into this ridiculously crowded sector.</p> <p> Thanks to the massive success of Square in the US, everyone's piling into the market for mobile card reading. PayPal, Intuit, Verifone and others have launched Stateside, while Payleven, SumUp, mPowa and more are battling each other in Europe.</p> </blockquote> <p> However the US-based versions can't attack the UK or European markets: no chip-and-PIN. (Even some of the players in the UK and European market don't have that capability - which might separate them out quite quickly.) </p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.theappside.com/2012/10/22/despite-piracy-there-will-be-another-android-football-manager-game/\">Despite piracy, there WILL be another Android Football Manager game &gt;&gt; The Appside</a></h2> <blockquote> <p>Sports Interactive has confirmed that it will be releasing Football Manager Handheld 2013 for Android, despite heavy piracy of the 2012 version - its first for Android devices.</p> <p> Studio director Miles Jacobsen tells Red Bull's website that the ratio of pirated downloads to legitimately bought copies of Football Manager Handheld 2012 for Android is now \"ranging between nine to one and 11 to one\".</p> </blockquote> <p> We've heard the same figures from Jacobsen. It's quite a problem for app developers: it has to represent lost revenue.</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.quora.com/Software-Engineering/What-are-the-best-examples-of-software-bugs-that-became-features/answer/Harvey-Green\">What are the best examples of software bugs that became features? &gt;&gt; Quora</a></h2> <blockquote> <p>This is from an anecdote by Ken Demarest, one of the original developers who worked on Wing Commander I on the PC...</p> <p> ... we were getting an exception from our EMM386 memory manager when we exited the game. We'd clear the screen and a single line would print out, something like \"EMM386 Memory manager error. Blah blah blah.\" We had to ship ASAP. So I hex edited the error in the memory manager itself to read \"Thank you for playing Wing Commander!\"</p> </blockquote> <p> Actually, the <a href=\"http://www.quora.com/Software-Engineering/What-are-the-best-examples-of-software-bugs-that-became-features\">whole thread</a> is worth reading, starting with Space Invaders.</p> <h2><a href=\"http://16s.us/TCHead/faq/\">Cracking TrueCrypt 7 &gt;&gt; TCHead</a></h2> <blockquote> <p>Q. Can TCHead brute-force TrueCrypt?<br>A. Yes. However, TrueCrypt passwords go through many iterations and are strengthened. Cracking them takes time. Very strong passwords will not be cracked. Also, in addition to trying multiple passwords an attacker must try each password against each combination of hash and cipher (assuming they do not know what these are beforehand). System encrypted hard drives use only one hash and cipher, so attacking those is faster.</p> </blockquote> <p> Hard to know whether to be worried about this or not.</p> <p>You can follow <a href=\"http://pinboard.in/u:guardiantech\">Guardian Technology's linkbucket on Pinboard</a>.
