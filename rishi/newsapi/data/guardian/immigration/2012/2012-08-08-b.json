  "<p>Bitter shandies aside, I'm not a habitual lemonade drinker \u2013 it's a thirst that seems to have quietly died away at about the age of 17, the same time as that for orange squash and blue raspberry Panda Pops. No wonder the <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hro4AdTYiTA\" title=\"\">distinctly more mature R Whites chap had to sneak downstairs in the middle of the night to get his fix</a>. </p> <p>But at this time of year, when I'm toiling up a hill in the sunshine or stuck on a stifling bus in the bad-tempered traffic, a cold glass of lemonade often appears before me, unbidden, like a mirage of refreshment. Not the saccharine-laden, aggressively carbonated sort, of course: no, my daydreams tend more towards the mouth-puckering, traditional drink \u2013 the kind that suggests rolling lawns replete with croquet hoops rather than a warm can from the ice cream van.</p> <p>For reasons probably clear to anyone of a more scientific bent, the sweet and sour flavours of real lemonade seem to hit the spot like nothing else on a hot day. (Interestingly, however, Jane Grigson reports in her <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/data/book/food/9780140469981/jane-grigsons-fruit-book\" title=\"\">Fruit Book</a> that, when she was a child, it was a late-winter drink intended to \"cleanse the blood\" of all that season's stodgy food.)</p> <p>The cloudy sort sold under the name of \"old-fashioned\" lemonade is often just as sugary as its colourless cousin, and the fresh kind is extortionately expensive if you actually want to quench your thirst rather than wet your whistle, making lemonade an ideal candidate for trying at home.</p> <h2>Paula Deen</h2> <p>One of the simplest recipes I find is from down-home southern US celebrity chef <a href=\"http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/paula-deen/lemonade-recipe/index.html\" title=\"\">Paula Deen</a>. She dissolves two cups of sugar in one cup of hot water, and then stirs in two cups of fresh lemon juice and dilutes it with a gallon of cold water. The results are intensely sweet and sour \u2013 nice in small quantities, but not terribly thirst quenching. It finds favour with the most sweet-toothed of my housemates, who screws up his face at every other lemonade of the day: perhaps one for the children.</p> <h2>Constance Spry</h2> <p>The indomitable Constance Spry, first principal of London's <a href=\"http://www.cordonbleu.edu/lcb-london/en\" title=\"\">Cordon Bleu cookery school</a> and author of what the Observer Food Monthly describes as <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/2010/aug/13/50-best-cookbooks-ofm?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">\"one of the greatest cookbooks of all time\"</a>, gives an <a href=\"http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=YWYgMPDQ6BUC&amp;pg=PA167&amp;lpg=PA167&amp;dq=constance+spry+old-fashioned+lemonade&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Cp-WNmFKrN&amp;sig=rgtkGcb2hVk2kX6AROfHHuBQj9s&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Qp8WULr4N_DB0gWTiYCIAw&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=constance%20spry%20old-fashioned%20lemonade&amp;f=false\" title=\"\">almost equally simple recipe</a>, which involves pouring 1.2 litres of boiling water over three diced lemons along with 3tbsp sugar and leaving it to soak for 15\u201330 minutes \"until strong without becoming bitter\". Slices of lemon and a sprig of mint are added for the final hour of chilling. Despite me checking it assiduously, it's still rather bitter for my taste after 20 minutes \u2013 and the lemon doesn't seem to have released any of its juices. Perhaps mashing the diced fruit through the sieve might have yielded better results, but I don't dare second-guess Constance.</p> <h2>Jane Grigson</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-394403630\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Lifeandhealth/Pix/pictures/2012/8/8/1344438131827/Jane-Grigsons-lemonade-001.jpg\" alt=\"Jane Grigson's lemonade\" width=\"220\" height=\"195\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jane Grigson's lemonade Photograph: Felicity Cloake</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Felicity Cloake</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Jane's <a href=\"http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ej3cNgbF90gC&amp;pg=PA220&amp;lpg=PA220&amp;dq=lemonade+%22jane+grigson%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=hrZWgLXh3y&amp;sig=8tUlu-sLWiBH_UCUGJS0UvljsyQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=8J8WUKrOLMOw0QWg9ICgDg&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=lemonade%20%22jane%20grigson%22&amp;f=false\" title=\"\">Fruit Book recipe</a> involves infusing water with the peel of three lemons and simmering it gently \u2013 \"the peel gradually flavours the water quite strongly\". Once cool, I stir in the lemon juice and sugar to taste and chill, then dilute with soda water and serve with a sprig of mint and a slice of cucumber. Although I find a still lemonade more refreshing, the balance of sour and bitter flavours is much better than in the Constance Spry recipe, although perhaps a little muted for my taste. The mint and cucumber provides a distinctive and very British taste of summer which makes this particular lemonade stand out from the rest.</p> <h2>Delia Smith</h2> <p><a href=\"http://www.deliaonline.com/recipes/type-of-dish/party-food/accompaniment/home-made-lemonade.html\" title=\"\">Delia's method</a> also involves infusing hot water with the zest of three lemons and then stirring in the juice of six fruits, along with 150g sugar. She then leaves it overnight, which, given how rapidly Constance Spry's lemonade turned bitter, makes me anxious, but actually the flavour is very well balanced and my favourite of all the recipes I test.</p> <h2>Gary Rhodes</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-394403631\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Lifeandhealth/Pix/pictures/2012/8/8/1344438026327/Gary-Rhodess-lemonade-001.jpg\" alt=\"Gary Rhodes's lemonade\" width=\"220\" height=\"172\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Gary Rhodes's lemonade Photograph: Felicity Cloake</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Felicity Cloake</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Gary's recipe, in <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/data/book/food/9780563537113/the-complete-rhodes-around-britain\" title=\"\">The Complete Rhodes Around Britain</a>, is billed as going well with griddled scones and homemade biscuits, which is endearing \u2013 it sounds just the kind of thing to set off a sunny afternoon in a striped deckchair. The method, however, is unusual: I chop up two lemons, pith, pips and all, and stick them in a blender with 4tbsp caster sugar and a pint of water, whizz it all together, sieve it and it's ready to serve over ice. I really want to like this one (so easy!) but like the Constance Spry lemonade, the bitterness of the peel is a little overpowering.</p> <h2>Mamta's Kitchen</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-394403632\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Lifeandhealth/Pix/pictures/2012/8/8/1344438105741/Mamta-Guptas-lemonade-001.jpg\" alt=\"Mamta Gupta's lemonade\" width=\"220\" height=\"185\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mamta Gupta's lemonade Photograph: Felicity Cloake</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Felicity Cloake</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>You never appreciate a glass of chilled lemonade more than in a hot climate, and India can't get enough of the stuff. In my experience, lemonade on the subcontinent tends to mean a glass half-full of freshly squeezed citrus juice (what were described as lemons always tasted more like limes to me) served with a bottle of soda water and a bowl of sugar to be added as desired \u2013 along with a good pinch of salt.</p> <p>Blogger <a href=\"http://www.mamtaskitchen.com/recipe_display.php?id=10313\" title=\"\">Mamta Gupta's simple recipe</a> for nimbu pani involves stirring the juice of a lemon or lime (I use lemon, for consistency rather than for authenticity's sake) into a jug of water, then adding sugar to taste and serving with ice and a slice of lemon. A pinch of chat masala spice \u2013 which doesn't seem quite in keeping with the drink I'm trying to achieve \u2013 or salt is an optional extra: Mamta observes that \"salt and sugar together help to replace the lost electrolytes in the intense heat of India\", and indeed this subtly flavoured drink is hands-down the most refreshing of all the recipes I try. I quite like the salt, but that could just be nostalgia \u2013 it doesn't go down quite so well with some of my testers, so I'm going to leave it to your discretion.</p> <h2>Perfect lemonade</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-394403628\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Lifeandhealth/Pix/pictures/2012/8/8/1344439664838/Perfect-lemonade-008.jpg\" alt=\"Perfect lemonade\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Perfect lemonade Photograph: Felicity Cloake</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Felicity Cloake</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The simplicity and speed of Gary Rhodes's method appeals to me here \u2013 lemonade is something you should be able to enjoy on the spur of the moment rather than having to prepare it the night before as Delia's recipe demands. I did enjoy the balance of flavours in her lemonade though, which I put down to the ratio of one part zest to two parts juice, as opposed to the equal amounts favoured by most of the others. I've added slightly more juice to make it a little more thirst-quenching, however. A pinch of salt, and a slice of cucumber and a sprig of mint to serve, adds a final touch of summer \u2013 if time permits, soaking them while the lemonade chills, as Constance Spry suggests, allows their flavour to infuse further. If not, dive straight in.</p> <p><strong>Makes 600ml</strong></p> <p>If you prefer a sparkling lemonade, add only 250ml cold water to the blender and then top up the jug with cold soda water just before serving.</p> <p><strong>2\u00bd unwaxed lemons</strong><br><strong>50g white caster sugar</strong><br><strong>570ml cold water</strong><br><strong>Pinch of salt (optional)</strong><br><strong>\u00bc cucumber, sliced</strong><br><strong>Small bunch of mint</strong></p> <p><strong>1.</strong> Cut one of the lemons into chunks and put into a food processor or blender, along with any juices from the chopping board and the juice of the remaining one and a half lemons, the sugar, the salt if using and a little of the water.

Taste and add a little more sugar if necessary.</p> <p><strong>2.</strong> Pour into a jug add the slices of cucumber and a couple of sprigs of mint, then chill until ready to serve.</p> <p><strong>3.</strong> Serve over ice with a fresh slice of cucumber and a fresh sprig of mint for each glass.</p> <p>Is lemonade the most refreshing drink on earth \u2013 and if not, what do you use to quench your thirst when the temperature soars? And has anyone any good suggestions for lemonade cocktails \u2013 a gin fizz, perhaps?</p>",
  "<p>\u2022 After all the speculation, time for clarity from the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/aug/08/boris-johnson-prime-minister-prat?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">mayor of London, Boris Johnson</a>. \"I think it's inconceivable I'm going to be prime minister and at the moment I certainly don't want to be prime minister,\" he told ITV's Daybreak. And it wouldn't happen, he said. \"How could anybody elect a prat who gets stuck in a zip wire?\" How indeed? \"I tell you what happened,\" said the mayor. \"I was trying to publicise our live site in Victoria Park, which is a wonderful place, by the way. And after I got stuck, which was slightly scarier than you might think \u2026 I want you to know, it was&#xa0;heroic \u2026 after I got stuck on that thing we did have a big increase in the number of visitors, so it wasn't totally fatuous, contrary to appearances.\" Good old Boris. But, not for the first time, he isn't being entirely straight with us. There is a science to the zip wire. The tension has to be just right for it to work, and that's why people who use it are weighed. But just occasionally, those who operate it encounter someone \u2013 let's say by way of example, Boris Johnson \u2013 who balks at being properly weighed and finds that, as a result, they get stuck in the middle. There is some logic to what he says. Who'd want a prime minister who won't take advice?</p> <p>\u2022 Still, if Boris is destined for even bigger and better things, he is going to need a team. Thus far he has not been great at picking lieutenants. Think of the <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1227538/Pictured-Shamed-Boris-ex-deputy-painting-toilets-community-service-fiddling-expenses.html\" title=\"\">deputy mayor who picked up a criminal conviction for fiddling his expenses</a>. Or the one caught fiddling his CV. Still, Boris is getting better, some say. And certainly he prizes loyalty. Thus there will be some controversy but little surprise at City Hall that the mayor has found another fine opening for his ally Veronica Wadley \u2013 past editor of the ever-helpful Evening Standard, presently the Boris-appointed chair of the London Arts Council \u2013 who has become the mayor's \"senior adviser for Team London, Volunteering, Charities &amp; Sponsorship\". And it's all good, because while political opponents were able to meddle in the arts job, which needed ratification, Johnson has greater writ to choose advisers. With the&#xa0;right friends in place, who knows how far he can go.</p> <p>\u2022 Excitement mounts, meanwhile, as more people become aware of the \"big society\" project to oust the unlovely Tory MP for Cannock Chase, Aidan Burley; he who dismissed the Olympics opening ceremony as \"leftie multicultural crap\". The website LabourList is leading the charge \u2013 people's champ and Murdoch nemesis Tom Watson has already pledged \u00a3100. Just one notable act of pushback so far. Yesterday, Dr Stuart Russell, aka Dr Phil Edwards, the former spin doctor for the British National party, got in touch to rubbish the whole thing and to shake an electronic fist on the issue of immigration. Excellent. Every good campaign needs enemies like Dr Stuart/Phil.</p> <p>\u2022 Pushback of a different kind at News International. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/aug/07/news-international-chief-aggrieved-arrests\" title=\"\">Chief exec Tom Mockridge voices annoyance</a> that Sun reporters continue to be arrested at home at 6am in the morning, despite his pleas that they be allowed some dignity. But there is little chance of the Met taking any notice. The force can be just as beastly to its own people. One cause celebre right now concerns the Met press officer dragged into a disciplinary investigation for having a drink \u2013 tea, of the regular variety \u2013 with a Mail reporter. The press officer was under suspicion for leaking a story which appeared four days later. He vehemently denied it; the Mail supported that, insisting it got the story elsewhere. And everyone wondered whether it was likely that such a sensible type would have indulged in such predictable skulduggery in the Weeting/Elvedon/Leveson climate. The Met tells he has been cleared. Not a stain on his character etc. But these are terrible times. Spotting any journalist in any place at any time, the smart Met employee might sensibly run the other way.</p> <p>\u2022 Finally, from David W Lesch \u2013 professor at Trinity University, Texas and adviser to the US government on Middle Eastern issues \u2013 a book, Syria:&#xa0;The Fall of the House of Assad. It is published on 30 August, which may be presumptuous, may be prescient. Either way, John Simpson has three weeks to get in place.<em> </em></p> <p><em>twitter: </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/hugh_muir\" title=\"\"><em>@hugh_muir</em></a></p>",

As few people expected, and I include myself among them, Australia made a game of it all the way to the final quarter. While it never really fell in doubt, it never felt comfortable.</p> <p>The keys for this game were pretty obvious:</p> <p>1. LeBron James is running this team, and running this well. He did a bit of everything today, a lot of everything, including getting his entire team involved. Some triple-doubles seem more like quiet statistical oddities, it appears on the box score but it doesn't seem impressive live (I call these \"Rondos\"), but every bit of LeBron James's triple-double today (11 points, 11 assists, 14 rebounds) came at a crucial time.</p> <p>2. Kobe Bryant came back from the dead. Okay, that's a bit melodramatic I suppose, but after a poor Olympics showing and a dismal first half, Kobe just exploded with three-pointers like Kevin Durant and Carmelo Anthony before him.</p> <p>So, Australia gave the USA their best, but it wasn't enough with LeBron and Kobe taking the game over. It happens. But we all know the true winner today:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/JThePedantic/status/233339885484900352\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/hunterfelt\"><s>@</s><b>hunterfelt</b></a> That guys prediction at the beginning was pretty close...he got Australia's score right.</p>&mdash; J D (@JThePedantic) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JThePedantic/status/233339885484900352\" data-datetime=\"2012-08-08T23:12:18+00:00\">August 8, 2012</a></blockquote> </figure>  <p>Yeah, that was pretty impressive.

Today the knockout rounds begin, pitting USA against the Australian national team. More than most team sports, basketball is a postseason sport, the \"win or go home\" challenge forces all involved to take their game to a higher level. The next few rounds should make the previous games feel like preseason exhibition games, the stakes are that much higher.<br><br>Just how high are the stakes for Team USA? Well, despite the fact that they were undefeated in pool play, their preliminary rounds performance was still considered a disappointment. First, they received an unexpected challenge from unheralded Lithuania, who held a lead as late as the fourth quarter. Then, USA found themselves up only by one point against Argentina at the half before they were able to pull away in the third. The mere fact that not all of these games have been laughers has brought out the second-guessers who believe Team USA needs to make adjustments. Most notably, <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/sports/lakersnow/la-sp-ln-la-london-olympics-kobe-bryant-should-keep-starting-job-20120807,0,941443.story?track=rss\">there's been some debate about whether or not Kobe Bryant, who has been a bit inconsistent, should be taken out of the starting lineup and replaced with Andre Iguodala because of his superior defense.</a><br><br>The good news for the American team is that they've also shown they can go on stretches of otherworldly dominance: Witness their historic blowout win against Nigeria or how they responded to Argentina's challenge with a second-half barrage of three-pointers. Ah, the three pointer. That's really the difference between Team USA struggling or shattering records. The trick to staying in the game with them is to hit the three-point shot early and often while hoping that they miss the three-pointers on their end. The strategy's drawback, however, is that if the USA starts making their threes, they are quite literally unbeatable. It's no coincidence that their best stretches of basketball were punctuated by ungodly three-point performances from Carmelo Anthony (against Nigeria) and Kevin Durant (against Argentina). <br><br>Australia, to put it mildly, has a lot to do if they want to pull off an upset of the ages. Australia does have some NBA experience, Patrick Mills currently plays for the San Antonio Spurs, and David Anderson has bounced around several NBA teams, but it's certainly a complete mismatch talent-wise. Here's how Yahoo! Sports' Dan Devine <a href=\"http://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/olympics-fourth-place-medal/olympic-men-basketball-quarterfinal-preview-matchups-players-watch-014007467--oly.html\">breaks down Australia's chances:</a></p> <blockquote> <p><br><br>Australia needs its best performance from everyone \u2014 the 39-point Patty Mills of the win over Great Britain, the 20-on-11-shots Joe Ingles and little-bit-of-everything Matthew Dellavedova of the win over Russia, the 17-and-7 David Andersen of the win over China, etc. It needs the combo of rugged captain Matthew Nielsen and Gregg Popovich disciple coach Brett Brown to inspire the nastiest defense the Boomers can muster.</p> <p>It needs bigs Aleks Maric and Aron Baynes to bang America's frontcourt early and often. It needs Team USA to play the brand of defense that nearly netted Lithuania an upset and kept Argentina close through two quarters. It needs multiple U.S. shooters \u2014 Kevin Durant, Carmelo Anthony, LeBron James, Chris Paul, Kevin Love, take your pick \u2014 to continue settling for 3-pointers and go ice-cold from long range. It needs USA coach Mike Krzyzewski to forget what the numbers say and refuse to go big.</p> <p>If all that goes Australia's way, the Boomers should be within 15 in the fourth.</p> </blockquote> <p><br>Ouch.</p> <p>As far as the rest of the quarterfinals, earlier today Spain eliminated France 66-59, ending Tony Parker and company's run. Before that, Russia took care of Lithuania 83-74. So, Spain and Russia will meet in the Semifinals, with the winner moving to the gold-medal game. Meanwhile, Brazil and Argentina are facing off against each other while I'm writing this, with the winner going on to face the winner of this game. Me? I'm rooting for a USA-Argentina rematch after all the bad blood that's accumulated between these two teams. <a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/sports/olympics/london/basketball/story/2012-08-06/team-usa-carmelo-anthony-cheap-shot-argentina/56830912/1\">Carmelo Anthony's groin must be avenged!</a></p> <p><br>Elsewhere: In the first round of the women's quarterfinals, the US women's team throttled Canada 91-48. If you're surprised at that score, you haven't been paying attention to just how good this US women's team is. The great Jackie MacMullen, pretty much my absolute favorite basketball writer ever, has <a href=\"http://espn.go.com/olympics/summer/2012/espnw/story/_/id/8243821/2012-summer-olympics-us-women-london-real-dream-team\">made a compelling case that it's the US women's team that's the true \"Dream Team\" in this Olympics</a>. In any case, the women's team is moving onto the Semifinals tomorrow against, oh hey look who it is again, Australia at 12:00pm EST or 5:00pm BST. <br><br>Okay, you've probably heard enough from me for the moment, it's time to hear from you.

  "<p>\"While we do our good works let us not forget that the real solution lies in a world in which charity will have become unnecessary.\" So wrote the great African man of letters <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinua_Achebe\" title=\"\">Chinua Achebe</a> in his 1987 novel Anthills of the Savannah. His words should ring loud in the ears of those attending the global hunger event (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2012/jul/27/david-cameron-hunger-summit-olympics\" title=\"\">Report</a>, 27 July) in London this Sunday. At the summit \"good works\" will no doubt be done which we will applaud but for too long the dominant if well-meaning approach has been the short-term fix. We need to lift our ideas and open our eyes towards the new and changing Africa: a future where African children's experience of famine is only from history books.</p> <p>Let's be clear. Parts of Africa are blighted by poverty, hunger, war, corruption and the vagaries of a harsh and changing climate. Today severe hunger is stalking a huge swath of Africa from Senegal in the west to Chad, on through Sudan and all the way to Somalia in the east. More than 20 million people are affected. These parts of this vast continent need our collective support. Immediate aid is needed.</p> <p>But Africa also needs sustained long-term investment which helps people provide enough food for their families, build their own future, withstand the next challenge and lift their horizons beyond the latest crisis.</p> <p>Let's also be clear that the solution lies in Africa \u2013 a continent of vibrant, talented, creative and hard-working people. Africans need a relationship with the rest of the world that treats them as who they are \u2013 equals with something to offer. Every one of us on this planet is descended from shared but distant ancestors. Whether from those who stayed or from those who made those tentative steps out of the continent millennia ago, we are all African. Together we can make an African future where \"charity will have become unnecessary\".<br><strong>Baaba Maal </strong><em>musician, Senegal</em><br><strong>Angelique Kidjo </strong><em>musician, Benin</em><br><strong>Femi Kuti </strong><em>musician, Nigeria</em><br><strong>Hugh Masekela, </strong><em>musician, South Africa</em><br><strong>Oumou Sangare </strong><em>musician, Mali</em><br><strong>Amadou and Mariam </strong><em>musicians, Mali</em><br><strong>Sidi Tour\u00e9 </strong><em>musician, Mali</em><br><strong>Vieux Farka Tour\u00e9 </strong><em>musician, Mali</em><br><strong>Djimon Hounsou </strong><em>actor, US/Benin</em><br><strong>Chiwetel Ejiofor </strong><em>actor, UK/Nigeria</em><br><strong>Mulatu Astatke </strong><em>musician, Ethiopia</em><br><strong>Jupiter </strong><em>musician, Democratic Republic of Congo</em><br><strong>Muntu Valdo </strong><em>musician, Cameroon</em><br><strong>Fatoumata Diawara </strong><em>musician, Mali</em><br><strong>Ismael Lo </strong><em>musician, Senegal</em><br><strong>2Face </strong><em>musician, Nigeria</em><br><strong>Lami Philips</strong> <em>musician, Nigeria</em><br><strong>Soundsultan </strong><em>musician, Nigeria</em><br><strong>Y'en A Marre </strong><em>activist movement, Senegal</em><br><strong>Cheikh Lo </strong><em>Senegal</em><br><strong>Kwame Anthony Appiah </strong><em>writer, UK/Ghana</em><br><strong>Croque Mort </strong><em>musician, Chad</em><br><strong>Didier Awadi </strong><em>musician, Senegal</em><br><strong>Sara Mitaru </strong><em>musician, Kenya</em><br><strong>Nanjira </strong><em>musician, Kenya</em><br><strong>Octopizzo </strong><em>musician, Kenya</em><br><strong>Camp Mulla </strong><em>musicians, Kenya</em><br><strong>Ice Prince Zamani </strong><em>musician, Nigeria</em><br><strong>Jesse Jagz Abaga </strong><em>musician, Nigeria</em><br><strong>Jude MI Abaga </strong><em>musician, Nigeria</em><br><strong>Brymo Ashimi </strong><em>musician, Nigeria</em><br><strong>David \"Blackman\" Muthami </strong><em>producer, Kenya</em></p> <p>\u2022 You have recently reported on UN and Zimbabwean government predictions suggesting that up to 1.6 million people in the country will require food aid next year (Report, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2012/aug/01/zimbabwe-food-shortages-aid\" title=\"\">1 August</a>).

I recently met the big agencies like USAid, World Bank and others on a trip to Harare with international development charity Practical Action. They want to see an emphasis on support to commercial farmers. They think that, if they can get the export market up and running, some of the income will trickle down to the 1.6 million who have very few resources.

It is the feeling of knowing you are improving and getting fitter and stronger.\"</p> <p>He undertakes gruelling sessions the equivalent of 200 lengths dedicated to producing as much lactic acid as possible in his thighs and hamstrings so his anaerobic power and endurance at race time is maximised. It is measured by physiologists who take blood samples to produce a kind of personal best of pain. Jamieson's is 17.5, he says proudly.</p> <p>\"A few years ago when I was training in Edinburgh we had a challenge to do twenty 400m freestyle races to find who had the fastest average and then we did a run around Arthur's Seat and I passed out,\" he said. I had pins and needles on my tongue, lips, hands and feet and my vision went blurry. I remember the others crowding round me and their heads seemed to be spinning and I remember saying: 'I love this. It has been a good session'.\"</p> <p>When Hoy saw off the German, Maximilian Levy, in the keirin final to win his sixth gold medal, it was hard not to wonder where the thigh power came from.</p> <p>\"There are parts of your training that are really grim,\" Hoy told the Guardian. \"It is part of the process and you know that it is worth it because when you arrive at the race you feel that you've ticked all the boxes and you feel there is nothing more you could have done.\"</p> <p>During a race \"you are caught up in the moment so much you are not really aware of the sharp, stinging pain of the lactic acid. It is almost as if racing is the easy part compared to the training you go through to get to this stage,\" he said.</p> <p>Chris Bartley, the silver medal winning rower in the lightweight fours, said that by the end of the race \"your body is screaming\" with \"lung burn\" from breathing so hard, agonising buttocks from lactic acid buildup and sometimes blurred vision from lack of oxygen.</p> <p>\"The pain is one of the reasons you get stressed before racing,\" he said. \"You know you are going to have to suffer or you won't get the result.\"</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-394451627\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/9/1344469950533/SA-Jae-hyouk-004.jpg\" alt=\"SA Jae-hyouk\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">South Korea's SA Jae-hyouk grabs his arm after getting injured during the men's 77Kg group A weightlifting competition.

It has been like that at the Olympics for over 100 years. I remember seeing pictures of the 1908 Olympics of athletes wobbling over the line.\"</p> <p>Mo Farah stormed rather than wobbled over the line to win the 10,000m gold, but that doesn't mean he didn't suffer. His coach, Alberto Salazar, once a successful runner himself, put it like this recently: \"The pain of running is like the pain of drowning. A kind of weariness sets in and you lose the will to fight. What I could do is simply push myself through that exhaustion.\"</p>",
  "<p>On Saturday 28 July 2012, Wade Michael Page walked into the Shooters Shop in Wisconsin to buy a 9mm semi-automatic handgun, and ammunition. Eight days later, the 40-year-old military veteran arrived at a Sikh temple in Oak Creek and began shooting at members of the congregation who had gathered to prepare a meal. During the shooting, six members of the Sikh community, one police officer and the attacker were killed.&#xa0;</p> <p>Within hours of the shootings, the <a href=\"http://www.splcenter.org/\" title=\"\">Southern Poverty Law Centre (SPLC)</a> revealed that Page was a known white supremacist. He had links to networks including the Hammerskin Nation and was involved in an underground music scene often referred to as \"white power music\" or \"hate rock\". Influenced strongly by earlier bands in England such as Skrewdriver, white power music is seen by those who study extremism as one of the most important recruitment tools for the modern far right. Page's involvement appears to have been deep: in an interview with online music magazine Label56.com in 2005, he claimed to have sold all of his possessions so that he could travel around the country attending white power festivals such as Hammerfest. The next year he formed a band called End Apathy recruiting bandmates from the other groups such as Definite Hate and 13 Knots. Asked in 2005 to elaborate on the meaning of the band's lyrics, Page replied: \"The topics vary from sociological issues, religion, and how the value of human life has been degraded by being submissive to tyranny and hypocrisy that we are subjugated to.\"</p> <p>Page's body also contained references to white supremacism. A tattoo of the number \"14\" was a direct reference to the so-called \"14 words\" that occupy a central role in neo-Nazi vocabulary: \"We must secure the existence of our people and a future for white children.\" This passage, a reference to a section of Mein Kampf, was popularised by <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Lane_%28white_nationalist%29\" title=\"\">David Lane</a>, a member of white supremacist terror group The Order. Another tattoo of the Odin or Celtic cross represents one of the most popular symbols among neo-Nazis, seen as the international symbol for \"white pride\". Those who had been close to Page confirmed his ideological affinity to the extreme right. Reflecting a wider belief within the movement, an old army friend of Page claimed that as far back as the 90s he had talked about \"racial holy war\", and would rant \"about mostly any non-white person\".&#xa0;</p> <p>As with the aftermath of the attacks by Anders Breivik in Norway, it was not long until sympathisers surfaced online. \"Take your dead and go back to India and dump their ashes in the Ganges, Sikhs,\" wrote one neo-Nazi. Others praised their \"brother\": \"All I feel is loss and sympathy for a brother that was overwhelmed by pain and frustration. I could [sic] care less though for those injured and wounded other than Wade.\" Another warned of future attacks: \"There are thousands of other angry White men like Page, the vast majority of them unknown ... When will they, like Page, reach their breaking point...?\"</p> <p>The threat of violence from disgruntled rightwing extremists is not lost on the security services, or analysts. In 2009, Daryl Johnson, an analyst at the Department for Homeland Security, <a href=\"www.fas.org/irp/eprint/rightwing.pdf\" title=\"Right-Wing Extremism: Current Economic and Political Climate Fueling Resurgence in Radicalization and Recruitment [PDF]\">authored a report</a> that explicitly warned of the growing threat of far-right violence. Pointing to the economic downturn, the election of Barack Obama and evidence that some military veterans were struggling to re-integrate into civilian life, the report was one of the first to flag the growing importance of the extreme right \u2013 a movement that was routinely overlooked after 9/11. Few, however, took the warning seriously. Rather, Republicans and rightwing commentators <a href=\"http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2009/apr/16/right-wing-extremism-alarm/?page=all\" title=\"\">openly criticised the report</a>. Some saw it as an attempt to discredit the insurgent and right-wing Tea Party movement while many viewed it as an unfair attack on military veterans. Others said it focused unnecessarily on domestic rather than foreign manifestations of terrorism.</p> <p>But Johnson (who was later shunted into a different department) was not wrong. Following Wisconsin, some analysts reminded commentators that the far right is responsible for as many \u2013 if not more \u2013 attacks on US soil than religious-based extremists, and now poses the most significant domestic security threat. Indeed, prior to 9/11 the most damaging act of terrorism within the US was the bombing of a federal building in Oklahoma by militia sympathiser Timothy McVeigh, which resulted in 168 deaths and more than 800 injuries. Between 1990 and 2010 the far right committed 145 ideologically motivated homicide incidents in the US. Of these incidents, excluding the bombing in Oklahoma City, far-right extremists killed 180 people.</p> <p>The data suggests that American far right groups have grown \"explosively\", which is attributed to a potent combination of public anxieties over the financial crisis, the growth of conspiracy theories, the exploitation of fears over non-white immigration and the prospect of Obama securing a second term in office.</p> <p>According to the SPLC, in 2011 the number of \"hate groups\" active in the US reached 1,018, 69% more than in 2000. The most striking growth has been within the \"patriot\" scene, which contains anti-government groups that cling to conspiracy theories and view the government as enemy number one. There were fewer than 150 of these (mostly inactive) groups in 2000. By 2011, there were almost 1,300. In fact, since 2009 this particular variant of the far right has grown at a rate of 755%.</p> <p>While it is difficult to compare across borders, similar warnings have been voiced in Europe. Last year, the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution in Germany noted that while the number of people in far-right political parties had contracted to 22,000, the number of those involved in more combative and confrontational forms of far-right politics was on the rise: the number of rightwing extremists&#xa0;with a propensity to violence had increased to 9,800; the number of followers of more violence-prone neo-Nazi groups had risen to 6,000; and the number of street-based demonstrations had reached an all-time high.</p> <p>Though less affected than other countries, from 2001 onward, authorities in the UK have similarly voiced concern over a rapidly evolving far-right scene. In recent years, at least 17 individuals who committed or planned acts of violence or terrorism, and who were linked to the far right, have been imprisoned. In 2009, the&#xa0;discovery of a network of rightwing extremists in England with access to an arsenal of weapons prompted London Metropolitan police to warn that <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2009/jul/06/far-right-terrorism-threat-police\" title=\"\">far-right militants might attempt a \"spectacular\" attack</a>. In the same year the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/video/2010/may/28/english-defence-league-uncovered\" title=\"\">English Defence League (EDL) was born</a>, introducing a new form of far-right politics that is less interested than its predecessors in elections, and more focused on rallying support through street-based confrontation and networks that transcend national borders.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-394850978\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/8/1344445694649/Wisconsin-candlelight-vig-008.jpg\" alt=\"Wisconsin candlelight vigil\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A candlelight vigil following the shooting at a Sikh temple in Wisconsin, Photograph: Chris Wilson/AP</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chris Wilson/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Though often dismissed as alarmist, these warnings were partly validated in July 2011, when Breivik launched his politically motivated attacks in Oslo and on the island of Ut\u00f8ya. Shortly afterward, authorities in Germany discovered that a violent neo-Nazi cell \u2013 the National Socialist Underground (NSU) \u2013 had been responsible for <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/nov/15/germany-neo-nazi-terror-cell-doner-killings\" title=\"\">at least a dozen murders</a>. Then, in Florence, an activist connected to the far-right group Casa Pound shot dead two immigrant street traders in an unprovoked attack. While it might be tempting to treat the attack in Wisconsin in isolation, it is actually the latest in a series of acts of violence from individuals linked to far-right groups.</p> <p>The perpetrators of these attacks are often dismissed as crazed and psychologically flawed loners. Perhaps this is because we have grown used to the security threat from religious extremists and tend to view their far-right counterparts as a loony fringe, rather than rational agents who are using violence to achieve certain goals. What <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/anders-behring-breivik\" title=\"\">Breivik in Norway</a>, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/dec/13/florence-gunman-shoots-street-vendors\" title=\"\">Gianluca Casseri in Florence</a>, the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/bombs/0,,190332,00.html\" title=\"\">\"London nailbomber\" David Copeland</a> and Michael Page all share in common is that they arrived at violence following a longer involvement with far-right extremism. For more recent examples \u2013 such as Breivik \u2013 their attacks followed an almost total immersion in online \"virtual communities\". These perform a crucial role in cultivating a set of narratives that are often later used to justify violence. These include emphasis on the perceived threat of racial or cultural extinction, belief in an impending and apocalyptic conflict (a \"race war\" or \"clash of civilisations\"), belief that urgent, radical action is required and that followers have a moral obligation. In short, only by engaging in violence can they defend the wider group from various threats in society.</p> <p>This preference for violence or terrorism reflects a viewpoint within the far right that has long prioritised \"direct action\" over a ballot-box strategy. For much of the past two decades in Europe, the strength of the far right has been measured through its number of votes at elections. But it is important to note that \u2013 for some within this scene \u2013 strength is measured as the ability and willingness to engage in violent action against \"enemies\" that are seen to threaten the racial purity and survival of the native group. These enemies can beimmigrants, minority groups, future leaders of mainstream parties or the state.</p> <p>Identifying and tracking the Breiviks and Pages of this world will always be extremely difficult. But the reality is that \u2013 at least for the past 10 years \u2013 western democracies and their security agencies have focused almost exclusively on only one form of violent extremism. The far right may still pose less of a threat than al-Qaida-inspired groups, say, but our ignorance of this form of extremism is&#xa0;striking.</p> <p>Wisconsin teaches us that the challenge that now presents itself is to understand what \"pushes and pulls\" citizens to commit violence in the name of rightwing extremism, and to develop an effective response. To do this, we must first start taking violence from the far right more seriously.</p>",
  "<p>I have two strangers coming for dinner. This is nerve-racking: who in their right mind invites strangers into their home? Also, I'm worried I've over-seasoned the curry I'm making, but there's no way of checking: I'm fasting so I can't taste as I go.</p> <p>I'm taking part in <a href=\"http://www.ramadanfestival.org/?p=505\" title=\"\">Dine@Mine</a>, an initiative set up by 25-year-old Maryam Douale from Manchester. The idea is that Muslims host an iftar (the meal with which you open your fast) for non-Muslims, to forge better understanding over food. \"Ramadan at my house is loud, fun and full of love and good food,\" Douale says. \"It's my family at its warmest and best. I thought what if we could give non-Muslims a chance to see what a normal Muslim family is like? Food plays such an important role in cultures and traditions ... it brings people together\"</p> <p>My guests, Jack and Jenni, live nearby. I email to say we will break our fast at precisely 8.49pm, while my husband, Richard, wonders helpfully if it'll be \"really awkward\". Meanwhile, I have a meal to prepare. I think of what I grew up with in Ramadan, my mother's big steaming pots of hearty, spicy Pakistani food.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-394527310\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2012/8/8/1344435550155/Mint-and-cucumber-raita-f-008.jpg\" alt=\"Mint and cucumber raita, for iftar\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Huma's mint and cucumber raita.

I skip the deep-fried pakoras and samosas that feature at most iftars as I find them heavy after a day's fast and for dessert, I'm including a good old British fruit crumble to reflect Richard's background. We'll open our fast the traditional way, with a date and water, a practice that goes back to Islam's beginnings. (And dates give the instant sweet energy rush needed after a day without food.)</p> <p>Jack and Jenni arrive. We offer them elderflower drinks, explaining we will wait until we've opened our fast, but they say they want to wait with us. Although they haven't fasted ahead of the meal, they are excited about joining in: \"When would I ever get the chance to experience any part of Ramadan?\" Jenni asks.</p> <p>At 8.49pm, Richard passes the dates round. Then we help ourselves \u2013 there's no formality with Pakistani food. Our guests' plates are laden with rice and both curries, and, reassuringly, they both want seconds. Jenni asks what we normally eat in Ramadan, and I confess that when I lived alone, I'd gorge on pasta, which left me bloated after a day without eating. Now I cook Pakistani food for special occasions \u2013 after a day's fast, there's nothing like it.</p> <p>I was worried the experience might put us on show \u2013 Look! Here are Muslims who fast! \u2013 but it hasn't at all. Friends and colleagues are intrigued about Ramadan but shy of asking questions and I want our guests to feel they can ask anything. Being used to fasting, I forget this is what baffles people most. \"Do you really get up at 3am? Is it like a midnight feast\" asks Jenni, who thinks sehri, the pre-fast meal, sounds \"magical\". I tell her that eating bagels while half asleep is quite mundane. They've been reading up on Ramadan, and instead of bringing flowers, made a donation to a charity for the homeless.</p> <p>Religion can be one of those subjects you steer clear of at dinner with strangers, but in this context it's easy to be open and honest with our views.</p> <p>The simple act of sharing a meal together has laid down the foundations of a new friendship \u2013 Douale will be pleased to hear we're going over to theirs for dinner after Eid.</p> <h2><strong>Helen Pidd attends iftar in Delhi</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-394527311\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2012/8/8/1344435769579/Helen-Pidd-celebrating-if-008.jpg\" alt=\"Helen Pidd celebrating iftar with Aisha.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Helen Pidd celebrating iftar with Aisha.

Despite covering my blonde hair, I resolutely failed to blend in. Ayesha shooed away the teenage boys photographing me on their phones and told a particularly aggressive hawker that I would not be paying 300 rupees to enter a place of worship.</p> <p>After prayers, the sky started to darken. Hundreds of families spread picnic blankets in the mosque's huge courtyard, an expanse of scorching marble which can accommodate 25,000 prostrate worshippers. But we weren't dining alfresco \u2013 we had a rendezvous with Ayesha's friend Adam Mohammad.</p> <p>Adam's family lives above one of their restaurants, a five minute walk from the mosque's main gate.

  "<p>Seeing <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/jul/24/greenland-ice-sheet-thaw-nasa?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">satellite pictures from Greenland</a> last month, scientists from Nasa at first couldn't believe what the data was telling them. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/jul/31/europe-greenland-natural-resources?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">About 97%</a> of the<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/jul/27/greenland-ice-sheet-melt?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\"> Greenland ice sheet was melting</a>. The rate was unprecedented, with the thaw more widespread than ever as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jul/26/arctic-climate-change\" title=\"\">unseasonally warm weather across the Arctic</a> took effect.</p> <p>\"It was so extraordinary that at first I questioned the result: was this real or was it due to a data error?\" wondered Son Nghiem, one of the scientists responsible for the research at Nasa's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena. In a normal summer, some melting is observed over about half the island's surface area. This new data \u2013 from three satellites \u2013 raised serious concerns over the progress of global warming and the likely consequences.</p> <p>For scientists at the Met Office's world-renowned <a href=\"http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/climate-change/resources/hadley\" title=\"\">Hadley research centre</a> in Exeter, the question was not just how fast Greenland was melting, but something much trickier. They have been crunching through years of data from dozens of satellites, trying to establish whether the conditions in the Arctic circle are related to the record-breaking washout of a summer in the UK. </p> <p>The news could be disconcerting for fans of the British summer. Because when it comes to global warming, we can forget the jolly predictions of Jeremy Clarkson and his ilk of a Mediterranean climate in which we lounge among the olive groves of Yorkshire sipping a fine Scottish champagne. The truth is likely to be much duller, and much nastier \u2013 and we have already had a taste of it. \"We will see lots more floods, droughts, such as we've had this year in the UK,\" says <a href=\"http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/people/peter-stott\" title=\"\">Peter Stott</a>, leader of the climate change monitoring and attribution team at the Met Office. \"Climate change is not a nice slow progression where the global climate warms by a few degrees. It means a much greater variability, far more extremes of weather.\"</p> <p>A series of unusually wet and cold summers has afflicted the UK for several years. Remember the devastating floods of 2007, when some areas received double their normal rainfall for June? Or the predictions of a \"barbecue summer\" in 2009 that backfired badly on the Met Office as the (correctly anticipated) high temperatures were accompanied by heavy clouds and rainstorms? The impression that many Britons have had that summer weather has been getting worse in recent years is borne out by the data \u2013 five out of the last six years (2007-2012), have shown below-average sunshine from June to August, and in some cases well below average. All have had above-average rainfall \u2013 in some cases more than 50% above the long-term average. \"It is not just a perception \u2013 we have had a run of relatively poor summers,\" says Stott.</p> <p>This year has been the worst so far. April was the wettest on record, and so was the period from April to June. The sun was missing too \u2013 June was the second dullest recorded. Hopes that August might bring more settled weather were dashed when the first few days brought floods as far apart as Scotland and Somerset, forcing scores of people from their homes. The unseasonally wet and miserable summer may have failed to dampen the Olympic spirit but it has brought misery to thousands.</p> <p>Nor has the UK been alone in suffering extreme weather. In the US, the eastern seaboard has been hit by heatwaves and storms but even worse has been the \"dustbowl effect\" in Texas and across much of the nation's agricultural heartland. India's monsoon failed to appear on schedule, leaving millions of farmers in the subcontinent facing destitution. Floods in Beijing, after the heaviest rainfall in 60 years, caused devastation to millions.</p> <p>The consequences across the world have been and will be dire. A food crisis is now all but inevitable, according to the US agriculture secretary. Emergency plans are being discussed in India, while in China the clear-up is accompanied by concerns that environmental degradation may be making the country's problems worse.</p> <p>Attributing any single weather event, or short pattern of events, however extreme, to climate change is always tricky. Extreme weather events occur, in the scientists' term, stochastically \u2013 they happen by themselves, unpredictably, owing to the natural variations of the weather.</p> <p>But the science of climate change has progressed rapidly in recent years. Last month, the Met Office and NOAA, the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, <a href=\"http://www.noaanews.noaa.gov/advisories/20120710-advisory-climatewebinar.html\" title=\"\">published a groundbreaking report</a> that showed recent events could be attributed to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/jul/10/extreme-weather-manmade-climate-change?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">human causes</a>. Last year's unseasonally warm November in the UK \u2013 the second hottest since records began in 1659 \u2013 was shown to be at least 60 times more likely to have happened because of climate change than because of natural variations in the earth's weather systems.</p> <p>Stott says: \"We are much more confident about attributing [weather effects] to climate change. This is all adding up to a stronger picture of human influence on the climate.\"</p> <p>For the British Isles, the melting Arctic could hold the key to whether the weather is changing under human impacts. Recent poor summers have been strongly linked by scientists to a change in the usual position of the <a href=\"http://metofficenews.wordpress.com/tag/jet-stream/\" title=\"\">jet stream</a>, a weather system that normally lies in high latitudes during the northern hemisphere summer.</p> <p>Earlier this year, two US scientists published a paper in the journal Geophysical Research Letters, suggesting that the meandering of the jet stream could be linked to the reduction in sea ice. <a href=\"http://www.sheffield.ac.uk/geography/staff/hanna_edward/icesheet\" title=\"\">Edward Hanna</a>, reader in climate science at the University of Sheffield, who is taking part in <a href=\"http://www.agu.org/pubs/crossref/2012/2012GL051000.shtml\" title=\"\">similar research</a>, explains: \"The last six summers since 2007, while often rather cool and wet over the UK, have brought Greenland unusually high air pressure, mild southerly winds, record-breaking temperatures and melting of the land ice.\" The link, he believes, is that Arctic sea-ice losses and the <a href=\"http://www.agu.org/pubs/crossref/2012/2012GL051000.shtml\" title=\"\">release of heat over the Arctic Ocean</a> have tended to weaken the jet stream and make it more meandering. This has brought more low pressures over Britain, less stable conditions, more cloud cover and rain-bearing weather systems from the Atlantic.</p> <p>This year, the jet stream moved much more than usual, passing south of the UK. It also persisted in this position for an unusually long time. If this pushing of the jet stream southward is indeed linked to less sea ice over the Arctic circle, as Hanna suspects, then the signs are that we will see many more of these wet summers in future.</p> <p>Despite the recent advances in climate-change science, it is too early to say whether this is certain. Hanna warns: \"Six years is a relatively short time, and there are quite a number of other factors \u2013 sea-surface temperatures, variations in the sun's power and the partly random and chaotic nature of atmospheric circulation \u2013 that can affect jet stream patterns, so further research is needed to make us more confident about the nature of these changes.\"</p> <p>That means it could take several years \u2013 aided by the roomfuls of supercomputers at the Met Office \u2013 to come up with more sturdy evidence linking our poor summers with climate change. If the link is established, it could signal similarly dull and disappointing British summers for many years to come.</p> <p>But one piece of the picture may be about to fade. The majority of the most valuable data we have amassed \u2013 including the images of Greenland's surface melting \u2013 comes from between 20 and 30 satellites that are now under threat. Ageing <a href=\"http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/41895904/ns/technology_and_science-space/t/lost-satellite-deals-heavy-blow-climate-research/\" title=\"\">satellites</a> are being removed from orbit and not replaced, while those that remain are at ever greater risk of buffeting from the debris that now litters space. \"There is a severe danger of not being able to see so clearly [from space] in future with the fall-out of satellites, uncertain government funding and so on,\" says Kate Willett of the Hadley Centre.</p> <p>Unless the satellite data continues to stream down, we will never know whether the UK is at risk of a new age of drizzly summers and dry winters, and drought alternating with flooding.</p> <p>Meanwhile in Greenland, inhabitants have been basking in an almost unheard-of heat, regularly topping 20C, with a succession of dry sunny days dominating the weather over the past two months. \"It's been lovely here, much warmer than usual \u2013 we've really been enjoying a nice summer,\" says Henrik Stendal from his offices in Nuuk, the capital. British staycationers can only shiver in envy.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 9 August 2012. The original stated that NOAA stood for the US National Oceans and Atmospheric Administration.

  "<p>Did I ever tell you about the time a couple of jellybeans cost me an Olympic medal? It was back in Sydney in 2000. Halfway through the second day of the decathlon, I was munching some sweets to keep my energy up during the discus throw. I gave some to Chris Huffins, who was a good mate of mine as well as a rival. He ended up beating me to the bronze medal by 17 points. That's about a one second difference over the 1,500m. Bloody jellybeans.</p> <p>I was thinking about that just the other day, as I watched the decathletes come out on to the track for the start of their Olympic competition. It is going to take more than a jellybean or two to stop anybody beating Ashton Eaton at these Olympics. At the US trials a few weeks back Eaton broke Roman Sebrle's world record, which I had thought would stand for the rest of my lifetime. The miraculous thing about Eaton's world record was that his discus throw and his shot put were dismal. I mean, give me a standing start and I could put the shot further than he did. And I've been retired for four years.</p> <p>If Eaton improves those two events, he could take the decathlon where Usain Bolt has taken the 100m \u2013 somewhere where no one else will be able to reach for generations to come. People like Eaton come along once in a lifetime. I expect him to break Sebrle's Olympic record too.</p> <p>For me, Eaton is the greatest all-round athlete on the planet. When you think of the Olympics you think of the fastest men on earth, the runners, you think of the strongest men, the weightlifters, and you think of the most agile, the gymnasts. If you combine every single one of those elements into a human being, you get a decathlete.</p> <p>These guys are the million dollar men, a bunch of Captain Americas. You think I'm joking? Daniel Awde, who was representing Great Britain until he pulled out injured, was a body double for the actor Chris Evans in the Captain America movie they made last year.</p> <p>To do the decathlon you need the dynamic power of the sprinters, the explosive strength of the shot putters, the agility of the pole vaulters, and at the end of it all, you need the balls to do the 1500m when you're feeling so knackered you're not even sure you can walk to the start line, never mind run to the finish.</p> <p>And these aren't races, they are time trials, which are a purer test. In the decathlon if you go past the guy in front of you, you don't think: \"OK, I can wind down now,\" you think: \"I have got in front of you and I still need more points.\" There is no let-up for 10 events.</p> <p>Psychologically, technically and physically, you have to turn yourself into different people. When you step on the track you are an Olympic sprinter. When you step on to the runway, you are an Olympic long jumper. You have to compartmentalise every event.</p> <p>I remember that feeling in Sydney so well. The first day of competition lasted for 13 hours. When it was over, I ate, went to the physio, went to the doctor. Then, after midnight, I went down to the basement of our house and stood on my own in an ice bath. I looked at my watch and thought: \"I have to be up in five hours! Bloody hell, how did it come to this?\" And I tell you what, I wouldn't have wanted to be anywhere else.</p> <p>I've never talked about this before but after I crossed the finish line in the 1500m I looked at the clock and saw I had knocked six seconds off my personal best. I thought: \"That has to be good enough.\"</p> <p>Then the scoreboard came up and it said Erki Nool first, Roman Sebrle second, Dean Macey third. I'd done it. The elation was just starting to wash over me, and then the scoreboard flashed again. They had switched my name around with Huffins. When I look back on the worst moments of my life, that is right up there. I sat on the floor, shaking my head in shock. I was sure I was going to be sick on the track. It took me 10 minutes to compose myself to talk to the press, and once I had done that I just broke down.</p> <p>To this day one of my major regrets is that I was so devastated I didn't even join in the traditional lap of honour, which all the decathletes and heptathletes do at the end of every competition. We do it because our event is so tough. It is two days of blood, sweat and tears, physical and emotional torture. Anyone who finishes, win, lose or draw, deserves to take the applause of the crowd. In Athens four years later I came fourth again. That time I made sure I was there for that lap of honour.</p>",

They were members of rival gangs who had put aside their differences in a plan, orchestrated via text and BBM messages, to run amok in one of the most extreme episodes of the urban disorder, inner London crown court heard on Wednesday.</p> <p>Three were jailed for nine years, and one was given a seven-year term while others were jailed for six years and six-and-a-half years and three received four-year sentences. Only one rioter was given a non-custodial sentence. All but four had previous convictions, and several had breached detention or curfew orders to take part in the rioting, the court heard.</p> <p>Detective Chief Inspector David Hutcheson said the police were still looking for more than 20 key figures involved in the rioting.</p> <p>The full story of the violence on 8&#xa0;August last year, which Judge Usha Karu said was one of the most extreme nights of the four days of urban disorder, can be told now following the end of two trials.</p> <p>It involved the storming of the Ledbury restaurant in Notting Hill. In previously unseen CCTV footage 30 diners are shown diving under tables as rioters burst in, some carrying batons, and sticks and shouting for diners to get on the floor. Watches, cash, jewellery and phones were taken by rioters wielding poles, knives and baseball bats. One woman had her wedding ring pulled off her finger, and a chauffeur waiting in a Bentley outside was attacked.</p> <p>The court heard that the Ladbroke Blood gang and the Lisson Green Men had put aside rivalries to plan and carry out what the judge said was \"carnage\", \"mayhem\" and \"mob criminality\".</p> <p>One rioter was tackled to the ground by the TV historian Dan Snow.</p> <p>A three-day sentencing hearing heard how the four-hour rampage included an attack on a shopkeeper, Mohammed Haroon, which was not previously detailed in the extensive coverage of the disorder. Haroon was beaten about the head with a looted champagne bottle by 19-year-old Kalen Hinds in an attack caught on CCTV inside the Super Save shop on Westbourne Park Road.</p> <p>In the footage, which can only now be shown, Haroon cowers in the corner of the shop, surrounded by masked youths. Hinds can be seen battering him about the head with the bottle.</p> <p>\"They hit me so many times I was very scared,\" Haroon told Channel 4 News. \"I think they were trying to kill me. After that attack I became dizzy and left the shop. I went out and called the police. The police didn't pick up.\"</p> <p>Jailing Hinds for nine years for conspiracy to burgle, conspiracy to commit violent disorder and the wounding and robbery of Haroon, Karu said the violence was \"completely inexcusable\".</p> <p>Sentencing all 16 \u2013 the youngest of whom is a 15-year-old asylum seeker from Sudan \u2013 Karu said: \"It was a year ago today that you were involved in the mayhem and mob criminality that so disturbed the law abiding public. Today, in stark contrast to those scenes of arson, looting and criminal damage London is hosting the Olympics which demonstrates the excellence that can be achieved in sport as an inspiration to all. However, those involved in these events were involved in the opposite.\"</p> <p>The 16 defendants were among 50 people who rampaged through west London at a time when the police were clearly outnumbered and overwhelmed, the court heard. \"The evidence shows this was not a random meeting but a planned campaign between some of you who knew each other as a result of belonging to gangs and communicated with each other by mobile phone,\" Karu said. \"Two gangs put aside their differences in order to get together to perpetrate the serious disorder. The object was to \u2026 cause chaos, damage and to loot.\"</p> <p>Three of the 16 admitted taking part in the Ledbury raid: Anas Ibrahim, 17, was jailed for six years; Ahmed al-Jaf, 19, was jailed for nine years for the Ledbury raid and his part in the attack on Haroon; the 15-year-old Sudanese asylum seeker, who cannot be named, was sentenced to three years in detention.</p> <p>Hutcheson said afterwards: \"These are some of the most significant sentences that have been given for the rioting. These events involved members of several gangs who organised themselves via social media to cause mayhem. Hopefully these sentences will send a strong message to those involved in gangs or those contemplating involvement.\"</p> <h2>Full list of defendants and their sentences</h2> <p><strong>Kalem Hinds</strong>, 19, was sentenced to nine years in a young offenders' institution for conspiracy to burgle, conspiracy to commit violent disorder, wounding and robbery of Mohammed Haroon</p> <p><strong>Rio Myers</strong>, 16, received four years for conspiracy to burgle, conspiracy to commit violent disorder, robbery of Haroon and robbery of a taxi driver</p> <p><strong>Gyasi Skinner</strong>, 20, received nine years two months for conspiracy to burgle and conspiracy to commit violent disorder, other rioting matters and four burglaries</p> <p><strong>Karim Lamguindaz</strong>, 16, for conspiracy to burgle and conspiracy to commit violent disorder, received a three-year rehabilitation order and a tagged curfew</p> <p><strong>Liam Hodge</strong>, 21, was sentenced to four years four months for conspiracy to handle stolen goods and other matters including possession of cannabis and fraud</p> <p><strong>Tyler Brewer</strong>, 19, was jailed for four years and one month for or conspiracy to handle stolen goods and a separate burglary</p> <p><strong>Jazz Dedier</strong>, 18, received 18 months in a young offenders' institution for conspiracy to commit violent disorder.

  "<p>In response to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/05/attack-across-egypt-israel-border\" title=\"\">last week's border attack in the Sinai peninsula</a> which murdered 16 Egyptian soldiers, today Egyptian military attack helicopters <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/08/egypt-sinai-offensive-islamic-militants\" title=\"\">fired missiles on suspected Islamist militants in Sinai</a>, reportedly killing 20. The air strikes on Tumah village \u2013 the military's first in Sinai since Egypt's 1973 war with Israel \u2013 were carried out as security forces massed near Rafah on the Palestinian Gaza border for what they called a decisive confrontation with the militants.</p> <p>Without addressing Sinai's severe social challenges, particularly a widespread feeling of neglect, discrimination and disfranchisement among its Bedouin population, the army's tactics might exacerbate an already dangerous situation.</p> <p>For the last two decades, the security situation in Sinai has rapidly deteriorated, fuelled by abject poverty, socioeconomic marginalisation and heavy-handed mistreatment of Bedouins, an ancient and proud community, by the Mubarak security apparatus. From the 1990s onwards, billions of US dollars were poured into developing the tourist industry in Sharm el-Sheik in south Sinai and the peninsula at large, with most jobs going to outsiders, not Bedouins. There was no trickle down to the local economy.</p> <p>Similarly, Mubarak and his associates sold huge tracts of Sinai land to crony capitalists, angering Bedouins who felt excluded from the development of agricultural farms in their heartland.</p> <p>Equally important, Mubarak unleashed his security thugs against restive Bedouins and humiliated and insulted their leaders, a sin that deepened the community's resentment against the Cairo authorities. Over the years many Bedouins have told me of their grievances against the Mubarak regime, stressing economic exploitation of their land and disrespect for their code of honour and values.</p> <p>While Mubarak's fat cats made fortunes out of Sinai, 50% of Bedouins live in poverty, with few employment opportunities. For their survival, they depend on an underground economy, including smuggling of goods and arms to besieged Gaza, illegal African and Egyptian immigrants to Europe, and drugs. A growing lawlessness turned Sinai into an attractive destination for jihadis, fortune seekers, and criminals.</p> <p>As Israel, with Mubarak's active co-operation, tightened its siege of Gaza in 2000, Sinai became a lifeline for Hamas and the Palestinians, using smuggling tunnels to obtain food and arms. Some Bedouins embraced the cause of their Palestinian neighbours, whose tragic plight reminded them of their own. Radicalisation found fertile ground, drawing in Bedouins, militant Palestinians opposed to Hamas, the Egyptian government and Israel and scores of foreigners.</p> <p>The recent flare-up of violence is a fresh reminder of the fierce urgency to resolve the Arab-Israeli-conflict and to establish an independent Palestinian state. Ironically, Hamas is being blamed for the militants' attack against Egyptian soldiers. Yet these militants have battled Hamas and accused it of selling out. Hamas finds itself between a rock of Israeli encirclement and a hard place of jihadis who are impatient to militarily confront the Jewish state.</p> <p>Although the post-Mubarak authorities recognise the gravity of the crisis in Sinai, their plate is full, and there is a lack the means and will to effectively deal with the Bedouins' legitimate demands, such as community empowerment and allocating a share of tourism in Sinai to the local economy.</p> <p>President Mohamed Morsi and the ruling generals had hoped to postpone the inevitable \u2013 rethinking Egypt's security architecture via Israel and the United States after the ouster of Mubarak, who collaborated with Israel in imposing its blockade of Gaza and acted as Washington's man in the region. They can no longer afford to do so.</p> <p>The challenge facing the new Egyptian leadership is to construct a post-Mubarak order that prioritises human security broadly defined. That means economic development at home and a political strategy that empowers citizens and local communities, not crony capitalists; and a proactive quest to broker a peace settlement that provides security for Israel and justice to the Palestinians. Any other approach that only focuses on sealing off Gaza from Sinai \u2013 privileging co-operation against terrorism \u2013 will face stiff opposition by Egyptians and will most likely fail to deliver security for Israelis, Palestinians and Egyptians.</p>",
  "<p>Stroll south down Ocean Avenue in Santa Monica any morning of the week and you will see, in no particular order, the following scenes: middle-aged men in shorts, singlets and boxing gloves sparring with personal trainers; young women in spandex doing yoga and Pilates; grandmothers with Nike headbands doing calisthenics; young men with tattoos doing squat thrusts and handstands to boombox beats.</p> <p>All that on the strip of grass separating the avenue from the bluffs overlooking the Pacific. Down on the beach you plunge into a&#xa0;whirl of joggers, rollerbladers, cyclists, volleyballers, surfers and swimmers. Continue past the pier and you see gymnasts and acrobats of all ages and sizes swinging from exercise bars, rings and ropes. Farther down the boardwalk you encounter the glistening pecs and straining sinews of Muscle Beach.</p> <p>All of which, if you were living in Los Angeles, could prompt a subversive question: who needs London? The local display of sporting prowess and passion, a daily ritual, costs nothing to watch and join. Many of the bodies \u2013 an exhibitionist culture usually leaves little to imagination \u2013 are buffed and chiselled to Olympian standard. Plus, you get spectacular sunsets over Malibu.</p> <p>\"Can anything beat this?\" asked Jonathan, a wiry fiftysomething in jeans and loafers who at that moment was suspending himself upside down from two dangling iron rings. His face slowly reddened and his inverted body swayed in the breeze. But it remained straight as a spear. \"Look at that horizon,\" he grunted, wriggling his nose at the waves and the azure sky. \"Come on, tell me what beats this.\"</p> <p>The usual answer is nothing. This western tip of Los Angeles is blessed; a sunny beach playground which claims, with some justification, to have launched decades ago the modern cult of physical fitness. How, then, does it view the Olympics taking place 5,000 miles away? In a word, smugly. While couch potatoes around the world munch Pringles and gaze at the athleticism with a sense of wonder, this corner of Los Angeles towels off its sweat and thinks, uh-huh, not bad. \"I trained with his dad,\" said Dave Pelosi, an 88-year-old retired gym teacher, watching a US volleyballer serve against Brazil. Pelosi might have made the US gymnastic team for London's 1948 Olympics had it not been for a broken rib.</p> <p>LA would not be LA if it did not view the Games through its own particular prism. For the fitness fanatics of Santa Monica that means seeing the athletes in London as alter egos who have the time, youth and sponsorship to take performance to the ultimate level. The city's other tribes all have their own idiosyncratic take.</p> <p>Hollywood looks at the display of physical perfection and wonders how it may convert into movie box office. It started with Sonja Henie, the Norwegian Olympics figure skater who translated success on ice into a 1930s movie career with the likes of <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/moviesnow/la-et-mn-st-classic-hollywood-20120730,0,6963864.story\" title=\"\">One in a Million, Thin Ice and Second Fiddle</a>.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MwHWbsvgQUE\" title=\"\">Johnny Weissmuller, the Michael Phelps of his day, swapped swimming trunks for a loin cloth and a career as Tarzan</a>. <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwjdKPnOzQA\" title=\"\">Larry Crabbe</a>, another champion swimmer, ended up playing Buck Rogers and Flash Gordon. It was not exactly the Olympics but Arnold Schwarzenegger won Austria's 1965 Olympic lifting championship and went on, via Muscle Beach, to conquer Hollywood and Californian politics.</p> <p>When not poaching the athletes, Hollywood eyes the Olympics for storylines: Chariots of Fire, Cool Runnings, Munich, Miracle on Ice, The Jesse Owens Story.</p> <p>LA has been near universal in its appreciation of Danny Boyle's film-esque opening ceremony. NBC is especially grateful for that spectacular kick-off. Its contract with the International Olympic Committee has produced a ratings juggernaut that has rolled over the comedies and dramas of rival networks. Faced with overwhelming competition from the Olympics, ABC's Bachelor Pad and <a href=\"http://www.thewrap.com/tv/article/ratings-bachelor-pad-and-glass-house-hit-lows-olympics-dominate-nbc-50096\" title=\"\">The Glass House nosedived to ratings lows, noted the industry bible, The Wrap</a>.</p> <p>So many city hall employees tuned in that online computers slowed to a crawl. \"We are experiencing a high volume of traffic due to people watching the Olympics online,\" scolded a leaked letter from Randi Levin, the municipal IT chief. \"I respectfully request that you discontinue this as it is impacting city operations.\"</p> <p>Such is LA's historic amnesia there is barely any mention or nostalgia for its hosting of the 1984 Olympics, Games notable, among other things, for OJ Simpson carrying the torch, the Soviet boycott, Mary Decker tangling with Zola Budd in the 3,000m final, Lionel Richie capping the two weeks with the hit All Night Long and the Games, for the first time in decades, making a profit for the host&#xa0;city.</p> <p>Even less mention is made of LA's hosting of the 1932 Olympics. In the depths of the great depression many countries could not afford to send delegations. Nevertheless, the Games were considered a success and even made a reported $1m profit.</p> <p>When London winds up next week the US will ponder anew why it has failed to land the Summer Games since Atlanta 1996. New York missed out to London and, despite Barack Obama's personal intervention, Chicago missed out to Rio de Janeiro for 2016, prompting mutterings of IOC hostility to US bids.</p> <p>Not all LA watches the Olympics through a haze of endorphins and commercial opportunism. Some Angelenos plant themselves on bar stools and soak up the action with what they imagine to be British-style dining. \"When else would eating a week's worth of fish and chips be socially acceptable behaviour?\" mused the LA Weekly in a guide to local Anglo-Saxon pub grub such as Hollywood's Blue Boar, which specialises in <a href=\"http://blogs.laweekly.com/squidink/2012/07/olympics_restaurants_los_angeles.php\" title=\"\">British cask ales</a>.</p> <p>\"A couple of big-screen TVs hang above the bar, which means you tune in while snacking on curry and chips, a sausage roll or other types of food that make you glad the people on the telly are the ones doing strenuous exercise.\"</p>",

What am I talking about? Can you identify this bird's taxonomic family and species? What sex is this bird? Is it juvenile or adult? </p> <p><strong>Response:</strong> This is a female (or juvenile) orchard oriole, <em>Icterus spurius</em>, the smallest of the North American orioles. This colourful species is placed into the New World blackbirds and orioles family, Icteridae. </p> <p>Orchard orioles are neotropical migrants, wintering in northeastern Colombia and northern Venezuela and breeding in semi-open deciduous forests, orchards and parks throughout most of the eastern and central United States and into southeastern Canada and northern Mexico. They are gregarious; their elaborate woven hanging nests are often found in very close association. </p> <p>Orchard orioles consume mainly insects and arachnids in breeding season, then their diet changes to favour mostly ripe fruits and nectar in addition to insects. On their wintering grounds, they add seeds to their diet. </p> <p>Females of this species are often mistaken for New World wood warblers and especially for female hooded orioles, <em>I. cucullatus</em>. In the field, the orchard oriole can be identified by its smaller size, shorter and straighter bill, shorter tail and by its two very bold wingbars. Unfortunately, all of these fieldmarks are either not visible or are obscured by the angle of our original mystery bird image, so the best you could do with this mystery bird was to narrow it down to these two possibilities. However, based on the second image I shared with you, I am tempted to go out on a limb and propose that our mystery bird may be a recent fledgling due to its (mostly) horn-coloured bill and the lack of a pale yellow streak through its eye. </p> <p>This species is special, in my opinion, because they don't reach sexual maturity until 2 years of age -- an unusual life history trait for small- to medium-sized passerines. Additionally, yearling males have a distinct plumage from both females and adult males. In fact, the specific name, <em>spurious</em>, recalls the original misidentification of a yearling male as a female Baltimore oriole, <em>I. galbula</em>. </p> <h2>The Mystery Birds reference library:</h2> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/grrlscientist/2012/may/12/2\">Africa</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/grrlscientist/2012/may/05/6\">South and Central America</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/grrlscientist/2012/apr/28/6\">Oceania and the South Pacific Ocean</a></p> <p>.. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. </p> <p>You are invited to <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/punctuated-equilibrium/mystery-bird\">review all of the daily mystery birds</a> by going to their dedicated graphic index page. </p> <p>If you have bird images, video or audio files that you'd like to share with a large and (mostly) appreciative international audience here at <em>the Guardian</em>, feel free to contact me to learn more. </p> <p>.. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. </p> <p>twitter: @<a href=\"http://twitter.com/#!/GrrlScientist\">GrrlScientist</a> <br>facebook: <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/grrlscientist\">grrlscientist</a><br>evil google+: <a href=\"https://plus.google.com/u/0/111331532997434679580/posts\">grrlscientist</a><br>email: grrlscientist@gmail.com</p>",
  "<p>Despite the heartening news that a Kingston jury <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/aug/08/boris-johnson-aide-extreme-pornography-cleared\" title=\"\">returned not guilty verdicts</a> in a landmark porn trial on Wednesday, grave questions arise about the right of the state to intrude on the privacy of the individual with unfounded obscenity prosecutions.</p> <p>My client, Simon Walsh, was charged with five counts of possessing \"extreme pornography\" under <a href=\"http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2008/4/section/63\" title=\"\">section 63 of the Criminal Justice and Immigration Act 2008 (CJIA)</a>. The images showed acts of fisting and urethral sounding (the insertion of surgical rods into the urethra for the purpose of sexual gratification).</p> <p>These acts are legal to perform (fisting is even discussed in Fifty Shades of Grey - now the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/aug/07/erotic-book-fifty-shades-british-bestseller\" title=\"\">bestselling book in British history</a>), but representing them is criminalised under the CJIA if they are \"likely to result, in serious injury to a person's anus, breasts or genitals\". While prosecutions under s63 are not uncommon (1,337 offences were prosecuted last year), most accused plead guilty. It is therefore rare for a jury to consider this specific situation: whether someone is guilty of a crime that could result in imprisonment due to possessing images of legal acts.</p> <p>Simon is openly gay and enjoyed these acts in private with other consenting adults, so what has any of this got to do with the general public? Like Simon, you could be sent a potentially illegal picture via email. One which you never requested or opened, only to later find yourself in court, accused of being in possession of it.</p> <p>While some defendants have hundreds of thousands of allegedly extreme or indecent images on their computers, Simon had five images of consensual adult sexual activity and a single unrequested picture unopened on his email server attached to an email containing a story about \"Jason\". Simon never requested this image and the prosecution were unable to prove Simon ever opened, viewed or knew it. In the story Jason was described as being in his mid twenties. The prosecution described Jason as being 14 years old; the legal age of representation in pornography being 18.</p> <p>Three defence experts viewed the image and stated in written reports that Jason was in his twenties. As a matter of legal procedure, the jury never heard this expert evidence. Instead they used their common sense and acquitted Simon.</p> <p>Nonetheless this procedure raises significant concerns about the way in which prosecutions are conducted and the right of the state to interfere with the privacy of the individual.</p> <p>Unlike the <a href=\"http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Eliz2/7-8/66/contents\" title=\"\">Obscene Publication Act</a>, which covers distribution, the CJIA shifts the burden on to individuals in possession of pornography. People need to know how to modify their behaviour in accordance with the law, yet it is unclear what acts constitute \"extreme pornography\".</p> <p>As well as criminalising acts which are legal to perform, the CJIA would seemingly outlaw images which have been exhibited in art galleries. In 2008, the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2007/oct/16/art\" title=\"\">Barbican Gallery's Seduced exhibition</a> included photographic images of male on male anal fisting and male urethral insertion from artist Robert Mapplethorpe's X Portfolio. The gallery cleared them with the City of London police before the exhibition opened.</p> <p>Police also regularly misclassify images they discover. In the <a href=\"http://www.thisisstaffordshire.co.uk/New-laws-test-landmark-trial/story-12570771-detail/story.html\" title=\"\">Stafford extreme pornography trial</a>, my client was initially charged with being in possession of over 1,250 \"extreme\" images. Upon viewing them, it became clear that over 900 were of clothed performers not engaging in any form of sexual activity. That defendant was eventually acquitted by a jury of all charges.</p> <p>So, would you even know what material might be illegal? Have you been sent junk emails and not opened them? How much do you know about operating systems caching images attached to unopened emails?</p> <p>Simon is a barrister specialising in actions against the police, an alderman of the City of London, a magistrate and was formerly an aide to the Mayor of London. As a consequence of this prosecution, Simon was fired by Boris Johnson and excluded from his chambers. He ran the risk of going to prison. He had to listen to his innermost sexual fantasies discussed in court and media. This included an inaccurate accusation in the Mail Online that he had actually viewed \"child porn\".</p> <p>In questioning defence expert witness Dr Clarissa Smith, prosecution counsel Thomas Wilkins asked if those who attended sexual health clinics were significantly more likely to have engaged in \"risky\" sexual behaviours. She disagreed.</p> <p>He then stated that if the fisting pictures were of women they must be degrading and objectifying. She disagreed. In his closing address to the jury, he described Dr Smith's evidence as: \"disingenuous, self-serving and dishonest\".</p> <p>In addressing the jury, defence counsel Matthew Buckland stated that: \"The modern zeitgeist is an inclusive one. To call this obscene is a huge retrograde step\". Nevertheless in his summing up for the jury, His Honour Judge Price QC stated that: \"It is emphatically not your duty to send out a message to anyone about modern society\".</p> <p>Thankfully, the result of the jury's verdict is precisely that. They have made a powerful statement about the voyeur state intruding on the liberty of individuals' private and consensual sex lives. As the American comedian Bill Hicks said in satirising the US supreme court's attitude:</p> <blockquote> \"The problem with pornography is basically this: no one knows what it is. Other than that we got a really good grasp on the situation. We know it's bad; we just can't figure out what the fuck it is.\" </blockquote>",
  "<p>He hasn't been seen in public since the G20 summit in Mexico, and since then Ethiopia's prime minister, Meles Zenawi, has even missed the African Union summit held in his own capital city, Addis Ababa.</p> <p>Zenawi, 57, usually a conspicuous figure at meetings of African and international heads of state, has now been missing for more than seven weeks, amid growing incredulity.</p> <p>Government sources in the secretive African nation say that Meles \u2013 who was seen looking frail before his disappearance \u2013 is resting but well, but more than one eyebrow has been raised at the reasons for his absence. \"The Prime Minister is on vacation recovering from illness,\" an Ethiopian government source told the Guardian. \"There has been a lot of ill-meant speculation about his health.\"</p> <p>But there have been numerous reports that Meles traveled to Europe for medical treatment, prompting debate about its success as his recovery period continues unabated. Some media reports have claimed Meles visited the Saint-Luc hospital in Belgium, while the Egyptian state information service reported that Meles underwent surgery in Germany, prompting a cable of good wishes from President Mohamed Morsi.</p> <p>The Ethiopian press \u2013 regarded as one of the least free in Africa \u2013 has also reported that Meles is recovering from medical treatment. Experts say there is widespread confusion as to the fate of the prime minister, even within the secretive ruling party, the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF).</p> <p>\"It is a mystery what has happened to Meles and not even his own ministers know his fate,\" an exiled Ethiopian source said. \"Media in Ethiopia have been getting it wrong and have now dropped the story altogether.\" Some analysts have claimed that Meles will not return to power at all, after a senior member of the TPLF, Sibhat Nega, stated that the party was working on a power succession and that the regime could continue in the event of \"individuals\" dying or leaving the government.</p> <p>The death of president John Atta Mills in Ghana last month led to a rare broadcast on Ethiopian state TV on how to mourn the death of a leader, which has also fuelled speculation that Meles's health may be further deteriorating. It is not the first time that an African government has failed to confirm the illness or death of a leader in office, prompting periods of mysterious absence.</p> <p>A century ago Emperor Menelik II, the founder of modern imperial Ethiopia, was buried in 1913 without any public announcement after he had been incapacitated by a stroke for several years, leaving the administration of the country in the hands of a specially appointed council.</p> <p>More recently, the late Nigerian president Umaru Yar'Adua was neither seen nor heard from for almost six months \u2013 apart from one phone interview with the BBC \u2013 between travelling to Saudi Arabia for medical treatment, and his eventual death in May 2010.</p> <p>Earlier this year news of president Bingu wa Mutharika of Malawi's death was leaked to the press, but not confirmed by the government for 24 hours, prompting fears of a power struggle and nearly triggering a constitutional crisis before he was eventually succeeded by the current president, Joyce Banda.</p> <p>The tendency to shroud the sickness and deaths of leaders has been repeatedly criticised for destabilising often fragile democracies and triggering secretive succession crises. There have been a flurry of searches and social media interactions on the fate of Meles by Ethiopians \u2013 including a popular #WhereIsMeles hashtag on twitter, but his absence from government is of concern to donors, who pump almost $4bn (\u00a32.6bn) of aid into Ethiopia every year.</p> <p>It is thought that deputy prime minister and foreign minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, is temporarily in charge, alongside other members of the ruling party. But one diplomatic source in Addis Ababa said that no western government was sure as to the whereabouts or fate of the Ethiopian leader.</p> <p>Meles, who came to power in 1991 following a 30-year war that toppled the Soviet-backed regime of former president Mengistu Haile Mariam, has long been popular with donors for his record of delivering growth to Ethiopia, whose economy has been growing at an estimated 9% per year for almost a decade.</p> <p>Ethiopia receives hundreds of millions of dollars in aid and support from the US, which welcomes its peacekeeping and military intervention in neighbouring conflicts in Somalia and Sudan. But Meles is viewed by many as a dictator who has stifled democracy and used draconian methods to silence dissent. The Committee to Protect Journalists, which regularly condemns the trial and imprisonment of journalists in Ethiopia, says that one newspaper \u2013 the weekly Feteh \u2013 was ordered by the government to block dissemination of 30,000 copies reporting on the prime minister's whereabouts.</p> <p>\"The ban on Feteh's latest issue illustrates the depth of repression in Ethiopia today and authorities' determination to suppress independent coverage of the prime minister,\" said Tom Rhodes of the CPJ. \"Every citizen has a right to be informed about the wellbeing of their leader and the conduct of their government.\"</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 10 August 2012. The original said Meles had not been seen since a G8 summit in June. That was a G20 summit.</p>",
  "<p>The bid to take American electricals retailer Best Buy private could trigger the end of its joint venture with Carphone Warehouse and net a \u00a3660m profit for Charles Dunstone's business.</p> <p>Dunstone sold 50% of Carphone Warehouse Europe, which owns his stores in the UK and on the continent, to Best Buy for \u00a31.1bn in 2008. The two also have a profit-sharing agreement to create a chain of mobile phone stores in China and Mexico.</p> <p>But if Best Buy's former chairman Richard Schulze succeeds in a bid unveiled this week to buy out the company he founded, a clause in its deal with Carphone Warehouse would allow Dunstone to buy back the half of his business.</p> <p>Under the terms of the deal with Best Buy, Dunstone has an option to buy the 50% stake back at \"fair market value\" if there is a change of ownership at Best Buy. Exane BNP Paribas bank puts that number at \u00a3600m, which at today's exchange rates is \u00a3500m less than Best Buy originally paid.</p> <p>With a guaranteed 10% discount, regaining full control could cost Dunstone just \u00a3540m.</p> <p>The break clause also gives him the option to sell his share of the two companies' Global Connect venture. Exane estimates Best Buy would pay as much as \u00a3100m for the mobile phone shop business.</p> <p>\"In our view it is highly likely under this scenario that Carphone would want to take up these options,\" said Exane analyst Ben Spruntulis. He added that Dunstone and his chief executive, Roger Taylor, already had a \"strong track record of undertaking value-enhancing transactions with Best Buy\".</p> <p>A spokesman for Carphone said: \"We do not comment on rumour and speculation. Our commitment to our relationship remains as strong as ever.\" Best Buy may welcome the cash generated by exiting its European venture. The retailer is struggling to compete with online rivals like Amazon, prompting Schulze's bid to organise a private equity buyout.</p> <p>The founder and former chairman has written to the company saying that he is in talks with top-flight private equity firms and that his financial adviser, Credit Suisse, is \"highly confident\" it could arrange the necessary debt financing.</p> <p>The contract with Carphone contains break clauses from 2015 onwards. These clauses can be brought forward should either partner be taken over by a company that is not majority controlled by the founders, Schulze and Dunstone.</p> <p>If Schulze succeeds in his bid to acquire Best Buy, he is unlikely to retain majority control. He has offered to put just $1bn of equity into the deal, with the rest raised from private equity firms and the debt markets. This would give him around 25% of the new company \u2013 not enough to claim control.</p> <p>Carphone may also want to end the relationship because it has been looking to form a partnership with other retailers, namely Media Markt in the Netherlands.</p>",
  "<p>From the Kyrgyzstan mountains came Aisuluu Tynybekova, who trains with men and became the nation's first female Olympic wrestler only because her trial for assault was postponed until after the Games. Tynybekova's outing on the mat lasted just two of the maximum three 120-second periods, beaten 3-1 by the Swede Henna Johansson in the 63kg freestyle category.</p> <p>Tynybekova, 19, did not stop to speak but her coach, Nurbek Izabekov, admitted the impending court case was a factor in the loss. \"From the psychological and moral point of view it did affect the performance of the athlete, of course it was the cause of the result,\" he said, while also citing an ankle injury the economics student suffered last month.</p> <p>Tynybekova, who grew up milking cows and horses in her village in the remote Naryn Province, denies the accusation that she assaulted a 17-year-old girl in April at an ice-cream stall in Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan's capital. Before a district judge delayed the trial until 15 August \u2013 three days after London 2012 finishes \u2013 Tynybekova's participation was in the balance.</p> <p>A section of the local media believe the girl had hoped to exploit Tynybekova's status as one of Kyrgyzstan's best medal hopes. The 14-strong team have so far not made the podium in London. Kyrgyzstan's all-time Olympic yield is a silver and bronze in Greco-Roman wrestling and a judo bronze. The Kyrgyzstan government has promised $200,000 (\u00a3127,000) for a gold medal winner, $150,000 for silver, while a bronze medallist would receive $100,000.</p> <p>Tynybekova told Kyrgyzstan's Russian-language newspaper Vecherniy Bishkek: \"People try to provoke me into violence every day.\"</p> <p>Tynybekova also had difficulties with the resources invested in her by the Kyrgyzstan Olympic Committee. Speaking a few months before the Games she said: \"The food here is okay for training. A bit stingy, though. We take what we're given and then we go and train.\"</p> <p>Her status as an Olympian made no difference, Tynybekova said: \"No, we have the same food as before. They say that they'll change it but they haven't so far. They say that the Olympic Committee will pay the stipend before the Olympics. But regardless of the money we're training now the same way we used to train before.\"</p> <p>For the Games she brought to London supplies of dried fruit and a dried cheese called khurut, though it is the wrong season for kumis, the fermented horse milk that is Kyrgyzstan's national beverage.</p> <p>Tynybekova's family home is in the mountainous Naryn province, though relaxing there is difficult. \"When I go home I want to get enough sleep, but one can't really sleep well in the village,\" she said. \"All my relatives get up early. Household chores like milking the cows start early in the morning. I've been milking cows and horses since childhood.\"</p> <p>Of her chosen method of preparation, Tynybekova said: \"Wrestling with women you don't get the same experience as training with men. Girls don't present the same challenges as men, I would say. Unfortunately, there are not many female wrestlers [in Kyrgyzstan] \u2013 it is also bad for me as I need competition. But I really hope that I will be able to inspire many women in Kyrgyzstan to go for wrestling.\"</p> <p>Tynybekova's talent may have derived from her grandfather, who was a wrestler. She said: \"I tried different sports at school \u2013 basketball, karate, even boxing \u2013 but I always felt I could do well in wrestling. My brother and I used to wrestle at home on mattresses during our childhood. Then in 2009, when I learned about the first female wrestling completion in Naryn, I decided to try my luck.\"</p> <p>Izabekov said: \"She is only 19 years old and these are the first Olympics that she takes part in. She has been practising for three years and we are next going to participate in the Asian Games of 2014. Of course, we are looking to the future and future Olympics and world championships.\"</p>",

  "<p>Imagine a music festival where the evening ends not in a soggy sleeping bag but with crisp white bed linen, where queues at the bar are replaced by waiter service, and, no matter who's playing, you'll always end up feeling moved.</p> <p>The good news is that the rock cruise, where bands play over a few days on a cruise ship, is already here, featuring acts including Pulp and R Kelly.</p> <p>\"We are getting a lot more interest from overseas,\" said Martin Forssman, whose <a href=\"http://www.swedenrockcruise.com/index.cfm?lg=2\" title=\"\">Sweden Rock Cruise</a> has been catering for Scandinavian music obsessives since 2004. \"After years roughing it on campsites, people enjoy the novelty of seeing their favourite bands and then eating at a restaurant or going to a casino, knowing they'll be sleeping in a really comfortable bed.\"</p> <p>As anyone who survived this year's<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/gallery/2012/jun/22/isle-wight-festival-weather-in-pictures\" title=\"\"> Isle of Wight</a> or <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/gallery/2012/jul/08/t-in-the-park-festival-in-pictures\" title=\"\">T in the Park</a> festivals could tell you, the unpredictable nature of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/jul/12/great-british-musical-festival-washout\" title=\"\">British weather</a> means that, even for the most committed hedonist, festival-going can be a sobering experience. t is easy to understand why increasing numbers of music fans aren't looking so much further afield as out to sea.</p> <p>\"Someone put details of the <a href=\"http://monstersofrockcruise.com/\" title=\"\">Monsters of Rock cruise</a> up on Facebook,\" said Rachel Street, a 32-year-old veteran of countless muddy Glastonburys. \"I didn't really know any of the bands, but it looked like a laugh. About 20 of us ended up going. It was four days and three nights sailing from Fort Lauderdale in Florida to the Bahamas and it was absolutely brilliant.\"</p> <p>Instead of soggy falafels, overpriced drinks and ghastly toilets, Street found a 24-hour buffet, cocktails and a cabin where, at the end of each day, she could sleep, shower, and wake up ready to watch the likes of <a href=\"http://www.cinderella.net/\" title=\"\">Cinderella</a> and <a href=\"http://www.ufo-music.info/\" title=\"\">UFO</a>. And if she didn't fancy that, there was always the mini-golf.</p> <p>\"I am so converted. At one point I was watching a band while sitting in a Jacuzzi drinking a mojito. The boat sails at night too, so instead of waking up to a muddy campsite you're at some beach in the Bahamas.\"</p> <p>While the cruise's ability to be both a festival and a holiday has been apparent to heavy metal fans since Vince Neil's first <a href=\"http://www.motleycruise.com/\" title=\"\">Motley cruise</a> set sail in 2008, savvy operators are now including indie fans.</p> <p>In January Atlanta-based promoters <a href=\"http://www.sixthman.net/\" title=\"\">Sixthman</a> \u2013 the market leaders \u2013 arranged for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2012/feb/06/weezer-cruise\" title=\"\">2,000 Weezer fans to sail between Miami and Cozumel, Mexico</a>. With a supporting bill including Dinosaur Jr, Sebadoh, Yuck and Wavves, the clientele were a far cry from the middle-aged metal fans who regularly rock up the gangplank for <a href=\"http://www.thekisskruise.com/\" title=\"\">Kiss</a> and <a href=\"http://www.kidrockcruise.com/\" title=\"\">Kid Rock</a>'s floating festivals.</p> <p>\"The Weezer cruise was a perfect example of the big companies realising they can tap into a market they've never been able to reach before,\" said <a href=\"http://www.indiegoddess.com/\" title=\"\">Wendy Fonarow</a>, anthropologist and author of Empire Of Dirt: The Aesthetics and Rituals of British Indie Music.</p> <p>\"The average age was about 30. The atmosphere reminded me of [holiday camp-based festival] <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/all-tomorrows-parties\" title=\"\">All Tomorrow's Parties</a>, where people come with a shared determination to make it work. The difference is, a cruise is much more fun than staying at a holiday camp. There were book readings, but there was also an 80s-themed prom night and snorkelling trips. Everyone came away raving about it.\"</p> <p>For diehard fans the cruise provides a chance to meet their heroes. It may not be cheap \u2013 prices for the Weezer trip started at $799 (\u00a3510) per person for a double cabin \u2013 but cruising comes with the possibility of looking at tropical fish with Rivers Cuomo or enjoying a drink in the bar with J Mascis.</p> <p>This exclusivity factor has a 21st-century twist. \"A cruise is brilliant for networking,\" said Fonarow. \"There's a Facebook page specifically for those who went on the Weezer trip, and they're already talking about the next one.\"</p> <p>In October <a href=\"http://www.concertscruise.com/\" title=\"\">R Kelly's inaugural Love Letter cruise</a> sails from Miami to the Bahamas, while <a href=\"http://www.getshiprocked.com/2012/\" title=\"\">Shiprocked</a> \u2013 headlined by metal band Korn \u2013 follows in November. California's Coachella festival, meanwhile, has announced plans for the <a href=\"http://ss.coachella.com/\" title=\"\">SS Coachella</a>, which will leave Florida on trips to the Bahamas and Jamaica in December with an entertainment crew including <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/pulp\" title=\"\">Pulp</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/hot-chip\" title=\"\">Hot Chip</a>.</p> <p>However, such exotic destinations can't disguise the fact that, fundamentally, these trips are floating festivals, with everything that entails. \"Because the bars are open 24 hours everyone gets completely wrecked,\" said Rachel Street. \"Put it this way, I saw plenty of cabin swapping going on.\"</p>",
  "<p>At least 70 journalists and support staff were killed while on assignment in the first half of this year, making it one of the bloodiest periods of recent times.</p> <p>Fifteen were confirmed dead in Syria alone between January and June, according to the biannual Killing The Messenger survey of news media casualties produced for the International News Safety Institute (INSI) by the Cardiff school of journalism.</p> <p>The next worst countries were Nigeria, where seven unidentified newspaper staff were killed by a bomb, Brazil, Somalia, Indonesia, where five journalists died in a plane crash, and Mexico.</p> <p>The toll compares with 124 for the whole of 2011 and 56 for the first seven months of last year. And 70 may be a conservative figure as INSI has recorded the deaths of an additional 30 news people where it was unclear whether the killings were related to their work.</p> <p>\"Journalists are more than ever in the cross-hairs of the enemies of freedom,\" said INSI Director Rodney Pinder.</p> <p>\"Despite some encouraging international political moves to halt the murder, the gun and the bomb remain the favoured method of censorship in far too many countries.</p> <p>\"Each and every killing chokes the free flow of information without which free societies cannot function.\"</p> <p>The survey also highlighted that the great majority of news media deaths occur in countries during supposed peacetime. Forty-three journalists died in countries officially at peace, victims mostly of vicious criminals, and often abetted by corrupt security forces, politicians and business interests.</p> <p>Impunity remains the big problem. Most of the killers of journalists continue to get away with it. In the first half of this year only one person was identified in connection with 47 targeted killings worldwide.</p> <p>The rate of impunity for murder of a journalists has remained constant at around 90% globally for the past 10 years - undoubtedly fuelling more of the same.</p> <p>As a safety organisation, INSI records all deaths of journalists and other news workers in the course of their duties, whether deliberate or accidental.</p> <p><em>Source:</em> <a href=\"http://www.newssafety.org/news.php?news=20542&amp;cat=press-room-news-release\">INSI</a></p>",
  "<p>A barrister has been acquitted of possessing extreme pornography in a landmark case over the boundaries of what can be described as \"extreme\".</p> <p>The jury was unanimous and took less than 90 minutes to clear Simon Walsh, 50, a former aide to London mayor Boris Johnson, and who served as a magistrate and alderman in the City of London, after a week-long trial.</p> <p>The case is believed to be the first to address whether images of anal fisting, a sexual practice which is legal, and urethral sounding are extreme pornography, as defined under the controversial section 63 of the Criminal Justice and Immigration Act 2008. Earlier this year Michael Peacock was acquitted of charges under the Obscene Publications Act 1959 of distributing obscene DVDs, which featured fisting and bondage, discipline, sadism and masochism (BDSM).</p> <p>Walsh was charged with possession of six email attachment images, which were not found by police on either his work or home computers, but on a Hotmail server account he set up to receive and send sexual messages.</p> <p>Oxford-educated Walsh was sacked from his position on the London Fire Authority on his arrest in April last year. He was a man of impeccable character who had made an outstanding contribution to society, the court heard, and had previously chaired the City of London Corporation police authority and licensing authority. He had been unable to work as a barrister since his arrest on the charges, which carry a sentence of up to three years in prison.</p> <p>His lawyer, Matthew Buckland, told Kingston crown court that the case raised issues of private personal encounters and \"how we view them in an inclusive democracy\".</p> <p>Walsh faced five charges under the 2008 act, which stipulates images are extreme if they are \"grossly offensive, disgusting or otherwise of an obscene character\" and if they \"portray, in an explicit and realistic way\" any act \"which results in, or is likely to result, in serious injury to a person's anus, breasts or genitals\".</p> <p>The prosecution claimed three images, found in attachments in Walsh's sent box, showed urethreal sounding, where a medical instrument is inserted into the tip of the penis to stretch the urethra and stimulate the prostate, acts that were likely to cause injury to a person's genitals.</p> <p>Two images showed anal fisting, which was likely to cause injury to a person's anus, it argued.</p> <p>The defence argued there was no evidence of any serious injury in any of those images, and that the activities were low risk. Walsh had taken the urethral sounding images himself at a New Year's Eve party and sent them only to other participants at the party, the court heard.</p> <p>A sixth charge, of possessing an indecent image of an underage boy, related to an attachment sent to Walsh which showed a sexually aroused male with a ligature. Walsh told the court he had no recollection of ever opening the attachment on the email, which was unsolicited and unanswered.</p> <p>The defence claimed the image was not of a child but an adult. It was also not possible to prove Walsh had opened the attachment, the court heard.</p> <p>Walsh, whose Hotmail user name was \"Cityfister\" with the password \"scat\", and who was a registered user of a social networking website called NastyKinkyPigs.com, admitted to police he had an interest in BDSM. He had practised fisting but disputed the claim that the images were extreme pornography.</p> <p>Giving evidence, he denied ever hurting anyone and said: \"I know the limits and I respect them.\"</p> <p>Prosecutor Thomas Wilkins told the court Walsh was \"a gay man who has what he described as a strange sex life\".</p> <p>Wilkins said: \"He doesn't dispute that he uses the email account purely for his sex life. He doesn't dispute that he is interested in bondage and sadomasochism.\" There was no dispute that Walsh had sent three of the images, but, added Wilkins, \"he disputes that they are extreme or pornographic\".</p>",
  "<p>Gareth Goh has the sort of summer job most 16-year-olds could only dream of: piloting around a bumper-sized remote control car in front of 80,000 people, with the world's best athletic competition to keep you occupied during breaks.</p> <p>Goh's task, which admittedly is unpaid, is to be one of the Games volunteers controlling the quarter-scale electric Minis that whizz around the central area of the Olympic stadium, returning javelins, shots and discuses to competitors. While the days are long and the responsibility great \u2014 no one wants to be remembered as the volunteer whose car careered onto the track during a race \u2014 there is the bonus that the field events tend to pause during the noise of major running heats and finals.</p> <p>\"I was there for Super Saturday, and for the 100m final on the Sunday. We get the best view you can,\" said Goh, one of 10 Sutton grammar school pupils working inside the stadium. \"It's been pretty amazing. Some of my friends were a bit jealous at first, but we're trying to share out the job at the stadium so everyone gets to do it.\"</p> <p>If Goh is feeling happy with his lot, so is BMW, which owns the Mini marque and is one of the official sponsors of the Games. Marketing experts are agog at the way BMW's ad people have managed to get such a recognisable product \u2014 albeit a scaled-down one \u2014 inside the Olympic Stadium, supposedly a product placement-free zone.</p> <p>The International Olympic Committee's charter would seem to be quite clear, stating in rule 50 that \"commercial installations and advertising signs shall not be allowed in the stadia\". The IOC has passed the use of the cars as they carry no specific branding. Nonetheless, the IOC's television and marketing director, Timo Lumme, conceded at a press conference, that \"you can recognise it's a Mini\".</p> <p>If that wasn't enough, the \"mini Minis\", as they are inevitably called, have proved a hit with spectators and the media, giving BMW extra payback for their estimated \u00a340m deal with the 2012 Games. The coup is all the greater given the more hostile spectator reaction to some actions by primary sponsors, for example Visa's decision to bar the use of any other cards at Olympic venues while plastering kiosks with the unlikely-sounding slogan, \"Proud to accept only Visa\".</p> <p>Goh's involvement came last year when, spurred on by his father, who had already volunteered, he organised a group of fellow pupils to apply to be \"junior Games makers\". Before he arrived at the Olympic Park he had little idea of what his duties might involve: \"On our first day in the stadium one of the officials asked if we could nominate someone for a particular task. Because it had been my idea to get the team together, they picked me.\"</p> <p>He and the other remote-control operators had less than 15 minutes training to use the cars, he said: \"They're pretty straightforward \u2014 the controls are just forward and backwards, left and right. You're really just running them up and down the field. I've not had any mishaps yet, though someone else did run his Mini into an official. They didn't seem to mind too much.</p> <p>\"The only problem can sometimes be remembering which is yours, because they look identical. A couple of times I've wondered why mine isn't moving and realised I'm looking at the wrong one \u2014 you need to concentrate quite hard.\"</p> <p>It's not the only significant event for Goh this summer: on 23 August his GCSE results arrive. He said: \"At least this has helped to keep my mind off it.\"</p>",

The allegation that this was some attempt at sockpuppeting is 100% wrong. This was an attempt to correct some misconceptions. That's all this was about.\"</p> <p>O'Dwyer's appeal against extradition is due to be heard in London in October. The case was brought by the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency, which claims that his TVShack.net website earned more than $230,000 (\u00a3147,000) in advertising revenue before US authorities obtained a warrant and seized the domain name in June 2010.</p>",

  "<p>On the surface, it looks as if collaborations between Alfred Hitchcock and Hungarian-born scriptwright <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Tabori\" title=\"George Tabori on wikipedia\">George Tabori </a>were doomed to failure. Tabori worked on the scripts for two of Hitch's films: he was replaced on <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/35095/north-by-northwest\" title=\"North By Northwest on guardian.co.uk/film\">North By Northwest </a>by Ernest Lehman, who came up with <a href=\"http://www.ritholtz.com/blog/2011/05/north-by-northwest-crop-duster/\">the cropduster scene</a>, and was dropped from <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/76930/i-confess\" title=\"I Confess on guardian.co.uk/film\">I Confess</a> after the production company found the ending of his script too shocking.</p> <p>In 1986, Tabori \u2013 widely championed as one of Europe's greatest theatre directors <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/2007/jul/26/guardianobituaries.booksobituaries\" title=\"Tabori's obituary in the Guardian\">when he died in 2007 </a> \u2013 gave an interview with a German newspaper in which he said: \"I was never a particular fan of Hitchcock's work.\" The problem, he explained, was that he had grown up as part of generation of European filmmakers who still had aspirations and ideals about cinema. Hitchcock, on the other hand, just wanted to entertain. The way Tabori envisioned it, I Confess was meant to be socio-political parable for McCarthyite terror \u2013 \"Hitch listened to my ideas, but ultimately he just wasn't interested.\"</p> <p>I can tell why Tabori might have said that, but I also reckon couldn't have been more wrong. Even without Tabori's final touches, I Confess is Hitchcock's most European film: continental arthouse with a dash of British humour, barely touching the American gothic that became Hitch's trademark.</p> <p>Set in French-speaking Quebec City, it starts with a dramatic collage of street signs that <a href=\"http://bookdesign.files.wordpress.com/2009/10/einbahnstrase.jpg\" title=\"Einbahnstrase\">would have pleased Walter Benjamin</a>, culminating in a camera swoop through an open window: a man lies murdered on the ground. Next, a shot straight out of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/fritz-lang?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"Lang on guardian.co.uk/film\">Fritz Lang</a>: a shadowy figure in a cassock walking down old-world cobblestones.

You can see why: for those who like to break their films down into structural parts, there's plenty to admire. Keller's confession is neatly mirrored by that of Logan's girlfriend (<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anne_Baxter\" title=\"Anne Baxter on wikipedia\">Anne Baxter</a>) from pre-priesthood days, now married. She tells the police that the victim had been blackmailing her, and that she saw Logan on the night of the murder to seek advice. It's meant to serve as an alibi, but the timing doesn't quite match up, and her testimony only ends up incriminating the priest further.</p> <p>As it happens, this bit is also where the film's flaws are hardest to ignore. In Tabori's original script, Father Logan gets revealed to be the father of an illegitimate child and is executed at the end \u2013 too much for the producers to handle. But without those revelations, the plot starts to sag a bit. What exactly is Logan's teenage sweetheart being blackmailed for?</p> <p>It would be absurd to pretend that I Confess can match <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/35092/strangers.on.a.train\" title=\"Strangers on a Train on guardian.co.uk/film\">Strangers on a Train</a> for suspense, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/34583/birds\" title=\"The Birds on guardian.co.uk/film\">The Birds</a> for thrills, or North by Northwest for wit. There's a fairly amusing running gag involving a dopey priest on a bike, but even he looks like he would rather edge out of the reel. Instead, it offers something we don't usually turn to Hitchcock for: seriousness.</p> <p>Lead actors matter in Hitchcock's films, but mainly because of what they do, rather than what's going on inside them. Here it's different: it's almost as if the former Jesuit schoolboy Hitch is caught off-guard, not so much confidently directing as being slowly mesmerised by Father Logan's inner turmoil. Hollywood's original method actor before <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/marlonbrando\" title=\"Brandon on guardian.co.uk/film\">Marlon Brando</a>, Montgomery Clift filmed with his acting coach just out of shot, but his performance is a masterclass in subtlety. He interiorises so much, you sometimes start to wonder if he's acting at all.</p> <p>Clift's understated style is brought out even more by the contrast with theatrically-trained Hasse, who does more melodrama with his eyes in the first minute than Clift in the entire movie. When Keller overhears his name mentioned by police, he swooshes around like a camp Count Dracula doing a double take. Contrast that with Clift's character being declared innocent by the judge at the end of the movie: for a few seconds there's no reaction whatsoever, then Father Logan breathes the softest, aspen-leaf sigh of relief.</p> <p>In the work of someone so exhaustively appreciated as Hitchcock, you wouldn't expect to find forgotten masterpieces but I Confess is one. It might never catch fire, but it smoulders gloriously.</p>",

He Mr Taekwondo, a superb athlete who has dominated the sport since it was admitted to the Olympics in 2000. Yet on that day in November 2009, as the revered American stared at the ceiling in a hushed hall in Mexico City, Cook was his deserved conqueror, a teenager from Dorset only the sport's hardcore knew much about.</p> <p>The British team performance director \u2013 then and now \u2013 Gary Hall, was moved to observe: \"We are thrilled with the result, not only because he beat an all-time great but also the manner of the victory. L\u00f3pez is one of the sport's most successful athletes of recent times and Aaron has proved once again that he is more than capable of competing on the world's biggest stage.\"</p> <p>Three years on and, for reasons that make sense only to British taekwondo's selectors, Cook is apparently no longer capable of competing on the world's biggest stage, despite being ranked No1 in the world, and will be watching the Olympics as a spectator rather than a competitor capable of beating the ageing L\u00f3pez.</p> <p>After much agonising, the selectors picked Lutalo Muhammad, a fine fighter in his own right, the European champion, ranked seven in the world with a win and a loss against Cook but who is now burdened with the unfair weight of controversy that has attended this shambles.</p> <p>Hall has said: \"The unfortunate situation ... wasn't ideal. We all had our worries, particularly the selectors who had to go through a very tough time. Quite a lot of pressure was applied, some of it undue. The coaching team and the performance staff behind them have done an absolutely fantastic job.\" You can only hope for their sake that they have, because, if not, they will come in for the most awful flack.</p> <p>So, what of L\u00f3pez? Is he as great as people say, as great as he was when Cook knocked him out in Mexico? He does not lack confidence or pride. The son of Nicaraguan refugees whose entire family, based in Houston, Texas, are immersed in taekwondo, L\u00f3pez is a 100%, flag-waving American. On a recent trip to see relatives in Nicaragua, he declined a meeting with the president, the Sandinista hero, Daniel Ortega, and, when we spoke, could not even remember his name.</p> <p>\"I'm sure I'm biased but I believe we're the best country in the world,\" he said. \"I know each athlete will go out there to do their best to bring home the gold medal.\"</p> <p>L\u00f3pez was a prodigy who fulfilled all the promise. \"I made the national team when I was 15 years old and [his brother] Jean, who's five years older, was on the team with me. Imagine a little 15-year-old travelling all over the world with guys who are in their 20s and you're a little kid?\"</p> <p>But this part of the journey may be a highlight for L\u00f3pez. \"In Beijing it was very difficult to get around. I've travelled all around the world, but I'd never been to England until last year, for the Olympic test event. The history of the country \u2013 Big Ben, London Bridge, Buckingham Palace \u2013 I really enjoyed the cultural part of it. It's like New York City. I felt that energy.\" Speaking before Cook missed selection, L\u00f3pez provided useful insight into the changing face of taekwondo. \"It's truly a global sport. At one time, it was only Korea taking all the medals, but at the 2010 world championships every single weight class had a world champion from different countries. Like Croatia, Mali, Azerbaijan, Turkey \u2013 they're all winning world championship and Olympic medals. It's a very competitive field. I haven't even mentioned Iran, they just won the Olympic qualifiers.\"</p> <p>\"You have the kid from Great Britain who's up and coming [Cook]. He's going to be real tough to beat because he'll have his whole country behind him.\" Sadly, no. Whatever the skill of the athlete, there is no accounting for the politics.</p> <p>L\u00f3pez will know what Cook feels like. At the Beijing Olympics, he was denied a chance at gold when docked a point on a marginal call against the Italian Mauro Sarmiento. It was his first defeat in six years and the fallout was dramatic. The American's team leader, Herb Perez, alleged that the World Taekwondo Federation (probably the most unfortunate acronym in sport) had pressured member nations not to protest at the Olympics in order to protect the image of the sport.</p> <p>\"When [poor judging] happens to you,\" Perez said, \"you're told to shut up and not say anything because of what will happen to you, or what will happen to the sport.&#xa0;If&#xa0;this is truly what taekwondo is&#xa0;about, maybe taekwondo shouldn't be in the Olympics. Maybe they should fix&#xa0;it.\"</p> <p>But taekwondo is in the Olympics and so is L\u00f3pez. He has somehow managed to dance around the sport's serial scandals, a man apart. In the small world of taekwondo, L\u00f3pez is unchallenged as the king. It is Cook's misfortune he will not get a chance at London 2012 to take a swipe at his crown.</p>",
  "<p>The Sinai has long been an area beyond the writ of Cairo. The vast desert peninsula is inhabited largely by Bedouin tribes, who for decades have been marginalised, neglected and impoverished.</p> <p>But in the 18 months since the Egyptian revolution forced out the former president Hosni Mubarak, the Sinai has become more chaotic and violent. And Israel has become increasingly alarmed by deteriorating security across its southern border.</p> <p>The peninsula is a wild frontier, a \"new hotspot with an expanding terrorist infrastructure\", according to a report, <a href=\"http://www.washingtoninstitute.org/policy-analysis/view/sinai-a-new-front\" title=\"\">Sinai: A New Front</a>, by Israeli analyst Ehud Yaari for the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, released earlier this year. \"Measures are needed to prevent the total collapse of security in and around the peninsula [and] avoid the rise of an armed runaway Bedouin statelet.\"</p> <p>Israel has urged the Egyptian government to take firm action against Bedouin militants and smugglers, and has enlisted the support of the US in its efforts. During a visit to Cairo last month, the US secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, warned that Sinai could become an \"operational base\" for jihadists if security was not stepped up.</p> <p>The region has suffered from chronic under-investment in education, health and transport. Its inhabitants are among the poorest in Egypt. Added to the potent mix of poverty, alienation and tribal loyalties is a sizeable Palestinian population in the north of the peninsula, with family, political and economic connections to Gaza.</p> <p>In the south, massive investment since the 1990s in upscale resorts in the former Bedouin fishing village of Sharm el-Sheikh, and a programme to create a \"Red Sea Riviera\" along the coast, has further alienated the Bedouin. They are routinely excluded from employment in swanky resorts, and consequent resentment may have contributed to a spate of tourist kidnappings and armed robberies in the past year.</p> <p>In the north, there is markedly more violence. A pipeline supplying gas to Israel has been blown up more than a dozen times, disrupting flow and causing millions of dollars worth of damage. Armed gangs are trafficking huge numbers of people fleeing persecution, war or poverty in other parts of Africa, charging thousands of dollars for passage across the Sinai into Israel. Camps have been established, from which emanate horrific stories of rape, torture, extortion, misery and desperation. The smuggling of drugs <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jul/17/eritrean-regime-arms-human-trafficking?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">and arms</a> is also a major industry.</p> <p>And there has been an increase in militant Islamism. Israel says it detects the presence of \"global jihad\" militants and groups, some loosely connected to al-Qaida. \"There is a problem with Bedouin tribes drifting towards a fundamentalist Islamic ideology, making themselves part of the Islamic jihad movement, by which I mean a loose network of small terror organisations trying to fight the current order,\" Major General Dan Harel, former deputy chief of staff of the Israel Defence Forces, said earlier this week.</p> <p>Israel cannot risk jeopardising its 33-year-old peace treaty with Egypt by taking action itself. Under the terms of the treaty, the Sinai is a demilitarised zone. But the overnight military attack by the Egyptian military may be the first step in Cairo's efforts to regain control and impose order.</p>",

These objects can reveal and illuminate multifaceted aspects of a character's life and psyche \u2013 including innermost secrets and desires. </p> <p>Films depict cigarette lighters as tools of crime, deception, exoneration, investigation and manipulation. They are often represented as devices that drive the narrative, because the acquisition, possession and/or loss of a cigarette lighter can carry significant implications for the plot.\"</p> <h2>1. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/35092/strangers.on.a.train\">Strangers on a Train</a></h2> <p>In Alfred Hitchcock's Strangers on a Train (1951), the cigarette lighter is a quintessential MacGuffin. This lighter, engraved with \"A to G\" \u2013 meaning from Anne to Guy \u2013 was a romantic gift from Anne Morton (Ruth Roman) to Guy Haines (Farley Granger), and it becomes the narrative's linchpin. To clear his name of his wife Miriam's murder, Guy must retrieve his lighter from psychopath Bruno Anthony (Robert Walker), who had stolen it to implicate Guy in the murder. The lighter, therefore, becomes the key to Guy's innocence, while also highlighting his involvement with Anne. By the film's end, the lighter takes on investigative, redemptive and exonerative qualities that go beyond solely identification purposes. As the lighter circulates throughout the unfolding narrative, it becomes imbued with multiple meanings, which, according to philosopher and film scholar Mladen Dolar, render it <a href=\"http://bit.ly/MttQK1\">more than mere Hitchcockian MacGuffin</a>: \"It is a fascinating, captivating, bewitching, spellbinding object which necessarily possesses a kind of materiality and a certain lethal quality.\"</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/KPLZAH987J4?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"283\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/KPLZAH987J4\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p><a href=\"http://youtu.be/KPLZAH987J4\">Reading this on mobile?

In the film's final scene, protagonist Dr Margaret Ford (<a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001080/bio\">Lindsay Crouse</a>) steals a gold cigarette lighter from the purse of a woman sitting at the next table in a restaurant. Although Margaret is a respected psychiatrist, she had recently joined a group of ruthless conmen who ultimately betrayed her. In the penultimate scene, Maggie violently confronts Mike (Joe Mantegna), their leader. Early in the film, Maggie appears repressed, uptight and lonely. At the film's start, when Maggie admires the elegant, gold lighter belonging to her elderly mentor, Dr Maria Littauer (Lilia Skala) \u2013 a stand-in for Freud \u2013 Maria urges Maggie to \"enjoy\" her newfound success in life by buying herself one. In the final scene, Maggie seems more relaxed, about to enjoy a nice lunch in a highbrow restaurant with Maria, whereas in the film's first restaurant sequence between Maggie and Maria, Maggie had no time for such leisurely pleasures \u2013 and a Freudian slip occurs when instead of saying \"pleasures\", she says \"pressures\". </p> <p>Maggie's stealing the lighter can be understood on numerous levels: more than just an object for her chain smoking, the lighter represents a celebration of her victory over Mike in the showdown immediately preceding this scene. It is as if she has taken Mike's advice seriously, when earlier he had spoken to her about asserting herself by stealing \"a memento \u2026&#xa0;[taking] something from life\". Another interpretation of her theft confirms Mike's assertion that Maggie is \"a born thief\" \u2013 after she stole his penknife \u2013 and is a victim doomed to repeat her own compulsive behaviour, despite her supposed expertise in the treatment of compulsions. After all, she has written the bestseller Driven: Compulsion and Obsession in Everyday Life.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/A0eFfE8oa98?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"283\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/A0eFfE8oa98\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p><a href=\"http://youtu.be/A0eFfE8oa98\">Reading this on mobile?

However, rather than only identify its owner, George Smiley (Gary Oldman), a high-ranking British intelligence officer, it points out Smiley's arch rival, the elusive master Soviet spy Karla. Smiley narrates how, in 1955, during their only face-to-face meeting, Smiley had given Karla cigarettes and his own engraved lighter in a failed attempt to coax Karla to defect to the West. Twenty years later, Karla teased one of Smiley's spies, who was held in custody behind the Iron Curtain, with that very same lighter as he asked after Smiley. The lighter, originally a gift from Ann, George's wife, has the inscription, \"To George from Ann\", an inversion of \"A to G\", the engraving on the lighter in Strangers on a Train, and can, therefore, be considered a wink and a nod to Hitchcock. </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/KfU7M3RU63I?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"283\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/KfU7M3RU63I\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p><a href=\"http://youtu.be/KfU7M3RU63I\">Reading this on mobile? Please click here to view</a></p> <p>These cigarette lighters, both gifts from women named Ann(e) to their men, whose first names start with the letter G, seem to forge a symbolic link between the films. Moreover, the films frame the cigarette lighter in terms of matters of the heart, since the loss of the lighter is linked to the loss of the woman who gave it as a gift. In Strangers, Guy recovers his lighter, successfully maintaining his relationship with Anne, but this is not the case with Tinker Tailor: the loss of Smiley's lighter to Karla foreshadows his losing his wife Ann to Karla's British double agent, with whom she was having an adulterous affair. </p> <p>\u2022 Last week Emily Cleaver looked at scenes involving <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/filmblog/2012/aug/02/clip-joint-corpses?newsfeed=true\">corpses</a>.

  "<p>Great Britain is now basking in the glory of our Olympic Games and also showing its multicultural face. The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/aug/05/london-2012-team-gb-medals\" title=\"\">eight team GB gold medallists</a> last weekend all came from very different walks of life; different races and religions, from north and south of the border, the privileged and not so privileged. A glorious snapshot of who we are.</p> <p>I dreamed of experiencing this with my son when London won the Games bid back in 2005, so imagine my delight then when I received three tickets to go to a basketball game. I told him, as any proud father would, \"we're going to the Olympic Games!\" and, as promised, last week we went to the Olympic Park arena to see Lithuania v Nigeria.</p> <p>But my joy at going to the \"greatest show on earth\" was quickly overshadowed by the appalling racist behaviour of a large section of the Lithuanian supporters, who began by booing every time the Nigerian players touched the ball. At first I just thought it was poor sportsmanship, but their antagonism towards the Nigerian players quickly escalated. It was shocking \u2013 something I've not seen, perhaps, since the 1970s when far-right skinheads roamed the streets. The alcohol-fuelled group of 30 to 40 fans began monkey chanting, and making masturbating gestures.</p> <p>It's at times like these you ask yourself, \"what should I do?\" Most people around me seemed disgusted at what was unfolding, but they were unwilling to do anything. Then, about half a dozen of the Lithuanian fans began doing the Nazi salute, at which point I informed the volunteer stewards, who were equally appalled but felt helpless. I demanded they call the police.</p> <p>The police calmed the situation on arrival, although the booing continued, and we moved seats. I was later informed that one individual had been arrested and have since found out he has been charged and convicted for his behaviour.</p> <p>Petras Lescinskas, 36, an accountant from Lithuania <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/01/olympics-nazi-salute-basketball-match-fined\" title=\"\">admitted</a> raising his arm several times and making a \"Hitler moustache\" with his other hand.</p> <p>In his defence he told the court that this was acceptable behaviour in his country but the judge rejected his claims.</p> <p>Although I was unaware of it at the time, a Lithuanian fan had been videoed making the Nazi salute to three black Olympic officials during another basketball match two days earlier. At that game nobody complained and so no action was taken.</p> <p>Locog officials subsequently told me that they are forced to act if someone makes a complaint. But surely Locog should not have to wait for a member of the public to complain before they feel compelled? Volunteer officials, along with athletes and the public, should not be subject to this behaviour. The games authorities are proud of their zero tolerance statement, but this ideal falls well short unless they take a proactive stand to back it up.</p> <p>More generally, many more of us should stand up to the bigotry displayed by individuals such as Lescinksas. You don't have to put yourself in harm's way to make a stand. Although the Olympic authorities were not proactive enough in dealing with bigotry, when they were called upon, they, along with the police and the courts, acted decisively.</p> <p>The collective message to those who think this behaviour is OK was unequivocal: you are wrong.</p> <p>As we celebrate the success of our multicultural Olympic world-beaters we must also be ready to defend our multicultural society from such racism and bigotry.</p>",

All the news aired by the regime's media that regime's army was able to get control on Salahedin are mere lies. The Syrian army could not get forward even for one metre in this district. It is completely untrue that we have pulled out of Salahedin, we are still there fighting.<br><br>Tough battles are still going on there. Till now we do not have any result for the number of martyrs and wounded as random shooting is still going on. The Syrian army are using warplanes, artillery, rockets and mortars against all the districts in Aleppo not only Salahedin district. The old part of Aleppo is now sustaining great damage from the Syrian army, and the international community is just watching \u2013 even helping the regime.<br><br>We have issued an order to all the brigades which are based in Aleppo's countryside to head to the city and help other FSA brigades fighting in Salahedin now. We have more than 7,000 fighters in Aleppo now. <br><br>We are armed with our great belief in the fairness of our case. We will stay steadfast and persist to the end. We know that the Syrian army after this battle will retreat and many of its officers and soldiers will defect sooner or later.<br><br>All the weapons we have to combat this onslaught are guns, Kalashnikovs, anti-tanks, RPGs and some anti-aircraft rockets. <br><br>Salahedin district is the western gateway for Aleppo and one of the first districts liberated in the city. It is close to the college of artillery and armament \u2013 all the regime's forces are piled nearby in al-Hamadaniah district. That is why it is so important for the regime to get it back from the hands of the FSA.<br><br>Criminals of the regime are destroying Aleppo's most ancient district. People of Aleppo resent the international community's lack of concern about the destruction of their city but they do resent the FSA as some media claim. It is working hard to provide them with security. <br><br>We are securing bread for the people here, wheat and gas for bakeries and food for the civilians. We are helping the civilians who want to leave the city in finding a safe shelter for them \u2013 they can't do that by themselves. Aleppo's population is more than four million.

But another Jordanian official and the rebel Free Syrian Army said he fled to Jordan that day along with his seven brothers, two sisters and their families.</p> <p>They said he was planning to travel onward to Qatar, but did not specify when.</p> <p>The reason for the discrepancy in accounts was not immediately clear. But Jordan has been concerned that its more powerful northern neighbour may try to drag it into its 17-month-old civil war.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-08-08T11:18:51.306Z\">at 12.18pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5022486ab57975a08080f30e\" class=\"block is-summary\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-08-08T11:07:22.140Z\">12.07pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">New initiatives on tourism, archaeology and dentistry</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Some of the latest tweets from the Syrian government's news agency, Sana:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/SANA_English/status/233155445014011905\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>A Youth Group in <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search/?q=%23Tartous\"><s>#</s><b>Tartous</b></a> Launches Website to Document <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search/?q=%23Syria\"><s>#</s><b>Syria</b></a>'s Tourist and Archeological Sites</p>&mdash; SANA English (@SANA_English) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SANA_English/status/233155445014011905\" data-datetime=\"2012-08-08T10:59:24+00:00\">August 8, 2012</a></blockquote> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/SANA_English/status/233155279141883904\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/search/?q=%23Syria\"><s>#</s><b>Syria</b></a>: Photograph by Syrians <a href=\"http://t.co/58dQ6yfM\" title=\"http://twitter.com/SANA_English/status/233155279141883904/photo/1\">twitter.com/SANA_English/s\u2026</a></p>&mdash; SANA English (@SANA_English) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SANA_English/status/233155279141883904\" data-datetime=\"2012-08-08T10:58:45+00:00\">August 8, 2012</a></blockquote> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/SANA_English/status/233153621141905409\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/search/?q=%23Syria\"><s>#</s><b>Syria</b></a>: Higher Education Council Agrees on Opening Dentistry Faculty in al-Furat University</p>&mdash; SANA English (@SANA_English) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SANA_English/status/233153621141905409\" data-datetime=\"2012-08-08T10:52:09+00:00\">August 8, 2012</a></blockquote> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/SANA_English/status/233153025647190016\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/search/?q=%23Syria\"><s>#</s><b>Syria</b></a>: Situation of Displaced Families Discussed, Draft Laws on Tourist Projects and Gold Imports Approved</p>&mdash; SANA English (@SANA_English) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SANA_English/status/233153025647190016\" data-datetime=\"2012-08-08T10:49:47+00:00\">August 8, 2012</a></blockquote> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5022445795cb77f057201be4\" class=\"block is-summary\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-08-08T10:49:59.332Z\">11.49am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Syrian TV says fresh offensive launched in Aleppo</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Reuters reports: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Syrian state TV said that forces loyal to President Bashar al-Assad had pushed into the southern Salahedin district of Aleppo, killing the majority of the rebels there, and had entered other parts of the city in a fresh offensive.</p> <p>It said that dozens of \"terrorists\" were killed in the central district of Bab al-Hadeed, close to the ancient citadel, and Bab al-Nayrab in the south east.</p> <p>Rebels have used Salaheddine, the southern gateway to Syria's biggest city, as a base for three weeks but a Reuters witness said some positions were abandoned on Wednesday.</p> </blockquote> <p>Other rebels have a different version of events.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/martinchulov/status/233143925592952832\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Rebels now saying regime on back foot in Salahedin.

  "<h2>TORT</h2> <p>Tort is more an umbrella of different topics than a single subject. It covers civil wrongs that aren't crimes but, if proved, result in compensation for the loss suffered. You'll cover the principles and key cases that developed them.</p> <p>Perhaps the best thing about tort is that you'll study the law behind headline stories. Should the Catholic church be responsible for abuses committed by priests? You'll look to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/law/2012/jul/12/catholic-church-loses-apeal-liability\">recent developments</a> in the tort of negligence for this. Is there a tort for breach of privacy? Naomi Campbell's case against the Mirror newspaper will shed some light. And the most interesting areas are those where strict legal principles either give way to a broader sense of fairness and justice - or don't.</p> <p>That torts change over time may make the subject interesting, but it is also the biggest challenge: caselaw governs most torts, which means a lot of reading judgments. Get used to reading long, often meandering, sometimes pointlessly complex essays written by judges. Then ignore the writing style of most of them for your own work, and aim for crisp, well-referenced arguments.</p> <h2>CONTRACT</h2> <p>This states the obvious, but contract law covers all of the features of contracts: when a contract is formed, how to end a contract, and what counts as having performed contractual obligations.</p> <p>After studying contract law, you won't be able to go to the student bar's 2-4-1 all-night-free-boozathon without wondering if you've given consideration for the drinks. You'll also develop a strong understanding of what a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlill_v_Carbolic_Smoke_Ball_Company\">smoke ball</a> is (no, it isn't that).</p> <p>But contract law won't just make you a party bore. An understanding of it is essential for civil legal practice. It underpins commercial law and opens the door to employment law. There is also a strong contrast with European legal systems in contract law, and an increasing influence of EU law. Though there are firm principles that you must learn, there is also room to develop your own views.</p> <h2>LAND/PROPERTY</h2> <p>Studying property law will bring a new meaning to the word interest. At its heart, property law aims to teach you when an interest in land is valid in law, how to create one and when it is necessary.</p> <p>This knowledge is clearly of practical use. Before I went to university I didn't know what a mortgage was. Some of you will, unfortunately, have landlords at university that are less than scrupulous. Land law includes tenancy rights and obligations. It's practicality is land law's strength, but be wary of giving out advice just because you study law.</p> <p>Lowlights definitely include the <a href=\"http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Geo5/15-16/20\">Law of Property Act 1925</a> - which includes what seems like thousands of schedules and millions of paragraphs detailing types of interest in land, all of which need to be learned. For me, this was like trying to learn an Excel spreadsheet by heart. However, land law rewards those that buckle in and get on with it - marks are relatively easy to gain if you put in the hard shifts.</p> <h2>EQUITY/TRUSTS</h2> <p>Perhaps the most mysterious of the core subjects, equity used to be a different type of law, built on ideas of natural law and justice, with disputes settled in different courts to common law. In the 1870s (that's recent in the context of English law), the division was abolished.</p> <p>This left us with the law governing equitable interests. One important type is an equitable trust and many equity courses will focus on the formation and effect of trusts. Equity isn't a core subject in many degree programmes, and many aspects of trust law are taught in property courses.</p> <h2>EUROPEAN UNION LAW</h2> <p>This subject covers the institutions, legislation and cases of the EU, and if you're wondering why it's a core subject, then it will be an eye-opener. </p> <p>EU law is firmly embedded in domestic law because of the <a href=\"http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1972/68/contents\">European Communities Act 1972</a>. It means European treaties and regulations have effect here and EU directives must be implemented. The EU principles of free movement of goods, workers and services are also applicable in England and Wales. The meat of the subject is in understanding how these features are implemented and what happens if they aren't.</p> <p>The most interesting part of the subject was learning that great swathes of our law are dependent on EU legislation. Sex discrimination, other employment law, and parts of immigration law have a huge debt to the EU.</p> <p>I also think it's a subject that clicks into place when you understand the main principles. A lot depends on how you learn: figure out what works for you, then use it to learn the key structures and this will be an enjoyable subject.</p> <h2>HUMAN RIGHTS</h2> <p>Human rights law isn't a core course everywhere but is often offered as an option, and human rights law now threads through most other core subjects.</p> <p>Clearly the Human Rights Act 1998 (HRA) is central. But it's also only half the story. You will cover case law from the European court of human rights in Strasbourg as well.</p> <p>Human rights law is brimming with controversy and is rarely out of the news. Should Abu Qatada be deported? How far should freedom of expression stretch? Are our courts subservient to Strasbourg? Each of these questions rests on human rights law. And studying it is a great myth-busting tool - you will be able to spot the many incorrect statements made by press and politicians.</p> <p>A note of caution - as a subject strongly influenced by politics, history and current affairs it may be easy to get carried away in fascinating debates. But your course will deal with each right guaranteed by the HRA in turn and the slightly mechanistic way courts have interpreted them. It is important to get a handle on this, as well as the sexier aspects of human rights law.</p> <h2>CRIMINAL </h2> <p>Criminal law is almost certainly allocated as a compulsory subject in order to reassure law students that there is more to law than corporations, tax and contracts. Instead you will find yourself studying the laws of murder, grievous bodily harm, criminal damage, how to plead a successful provocation defence, and in what circumstances sadomasochistic acts in your own home may be unlawful (every law student's favourite: <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R_v_Brown\">R v Brown</a>). </p> <p>S&amp;M aside, the study of the law of crime is equally interesting as it is challenging. It's the first subject of the law degree where you will find yourself using Latin phrases regularly, and time is taken to get to grips with psychological concepts such as intent, recklessness, insanity and diminished responsibility. Far from enabling you to simply stand up in court and argue a criminal defence, studying crime will equip you with an understanding of the individual elements of a crime, while providing some of the most interesting caselaw you will come across during the degree.</p> <h2>PUBLIC/CONSTITUTIONAL</h2> <p>One of the most engrossing elements of public law is its current nature and relevance. Study is fast-paced and analytical, as you can find yourself studying the benefits of the relatively new supreme court one day, and arguing for or against House of Lords reform the next. Conceptual issues such as sovereignty of parliament and whether the Crown should be \"above the law\" ensure that there is plenty of room for debate, and current affairs are just as relevant as historical legislation. </p> <p>You will quickly grasp the legislative process, and understand the roles of various public bodies, whether looking at judicial reform, ministerial practices or the duty of the executive. Far from a dull overview of the government and courts, public law is an opportunity to really understand the inner workings of English law, and the decisions which affect citizens every day.</p>",

We got inside and everyone was evacuated.\" <br>Mr Johnstone, who is in London on holiday, said the canister exploded with such force that it blew the roof off the barbecue area.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5022bb7db57975a08080f390\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-08-08T19:18:22.210Z\">8.18pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Breaking news outside our window</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Bizarrely, we could see a fire outside the Guardian's window in Kings Cross, which turns out to be at New Zealand's hospitality house. 700 people have been evacuated.

While the BBC last night chose to focus on his sudden recovery from injury, our commenters seemed to think that the doctor's note was a side issue to the fact that the scheduling made it impossible for runners to compete in both the 800m and 1500m, the classic middle-distance runners' double. This is <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/london-2012-olympics-blog/2012/aug/08/london-2012-olympics-day-12-live-blog?commentpage=4#comment-17566635\">what I said earlier</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2012/aug/07/taoufik-makhloufi-olympic-1500m-gold-disqualification\">Taoufik Makhloufi controversy</a> is a ridiculous creation. Sure it was a bit odd that he dropped out of the 800m. Sure he probably wasn't injured. But somebody messed up by entering him in both events when they are scheduled against each other and this was a way out. But the people who really ought to be embarrassed are the people who decided to schedule the 800m and the 1500m like this. Middle distance runners have a fine tradition of running in both those events. The story of Coe and Ovett wouldn't exist if they had had to choose which to run in. One would have chosen 800 and the other 1500. No drama there. Makhloufi ran a great 1500m. He should've been able to run in both but was denied a proper chance.</p> </blockquote> <p>Our Olympics correspondent Owen Gibson tells me that it was Locog that decided on the Track &amp; Field schedule. Asked if the schedule stopped athletes from doubling up, a Locog spokeswoman said: \"This is something that is looked at at each Games and is looked at with the IAAF. I'm quite confident we've been alright on that.\" </p> <p>What do you think of the Makhloufi controversy? Do you think it is still possible for athletes to do the 800-1500 double? Is that still the double athletes aim for?

They were among the last sailors to be<br> picked for London 2012 and were determined to put right the<br> disappointment in China.</p> <p><br> Their regatta in the skiff class has been inconsistent. They have won<br> a couple of races in the preliminary series but have finished poorly<br> too often. They clung on bravely and went into Wednesday's medal race<br> in fifth as part of a six-way fight for the bronze medal. In light winds, Morrison and Rhodes got off to a great start and led the early stages of the medal race. But they could only finish the race fifth. The Danish team of Allan Norregaard finished third in the medal race to take bronze overall.<br> It was a significant race, too, for the Australian team.</p> <p><br> Their pair, Iain Jensen and Nathan Outteridge were guaranteed gold by<br> simply crossing the start-line. That was a second gold for the<br> Australians in the regatta following Tom Slingsby's triumph in the<br> Laser dinghy. They look good to win more golds than the GB sailors and<br> seize the title as the world's pre-eminent Olympic sailing nation. New<br> Zealanders Peter Burling and Blair Tuke were also bound to take silver<br> in the 49ers and duly did.</p> <p>Rhodes said they sailed \u201creasonably well\u201d in the medal race but had<br> lost the chance earlier in the week. Their friendship will not suffer.<br> \u201cWe're still be mates,\u201d said Rhodes, \u201cYou never know, we may come and<br> try again.\u201d</p> <p>Morrison said the result was \u201cpretty gutting.\u201d He said they had not<br> sailed well on the Nothe course in front of the spectator area, where<br> the winds are shifty. But he, too, looked forward, saying he would<br> like to keep competing. \u201cRio sounds lovely.\u201d</p> <p>GB eyes will also be watching the quarter final of the women's<br> match-racing event with on Wednesday. This is a one-on-one battle<br> rather than a fleet race. The first team to win three races goes<br> through to the semi-final.

Stuart Hayes played this role for the Brownlees yesterday.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/17564682\">RoyRoger asks</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Whilst I was watching the Brownlee brothers' interview after their medal victory I got the impression that they had an unfair advantage over the rest of their competitors. Am I the only one who picked up on this? Or have I missed the point/purpose of the race? Is it a team race? Or are all entrants expected to do of their best?</p> <p>I mention the latter point because a few days previously a few competitors were sent home for not doing their best.</p> <p>Back to the interview. On the interview couch sat three triathlon competitors. Why three I wondered? The Brownlee brothers including triathlete Stuart Hayes.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/17564746\">MsRobinson answers</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Well the Brownlees had a pacemaker which I reckon helps in the bike ride a great deal. Support from your brother and one other is pretty helpful I guess but it went true to the formbook. So no complaints.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/17564805\">conanthebarbarian adds</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Hayes was there as a pacemaker. As a three their strategy was to race so at least one of them would win (a Brownlee). This is a practice common in a number of sports, most notably cycling. Bradley Wiggins was not competing to win in the road race. Four of the five in that team were working so that Mark Cavendish could have a chance at the win in the sprint finish. Presumably you now think that gold medal winner Wiggins was \"not competing in the olympic spirit\" as well. I think you are wrong. Because they were all competing for a win for their country and working to that aim. Had any of these competitors found themselves in with the chance for the win at the finish they would have taken it. That does not mean they cannot start out with a particular strategy and it is a world away from setting out to fail and not even bothering to compete.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5022349b95cb77f057201bd0\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-08-08T09:42:51.983Z\">10.42am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">5000m</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Britain's Mo Farah is jogging around the stadium in preparation for his heat for the 5000m, which is about to start.

  "<p>Sudan has finally agreed to allow relief supplies into the two rebel-controlled border states of South Kordofan and Blue Nile, where aid agencies say <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/jun/06/act-now-stop-genocide-sudan-nuba\" title=\"\">fighting and denial of aid access for more than a year has left civilians facing a humanitarian disaster</a>.</p> <p>The agreement came the day after Sudan's negotiating team <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/04/sudan-south-sudan-oil-row\" title=\"\">reached a deal with South Sudan over oil transit fees</a>, potentially resolving a dispute that has threatened a return to all-out war. The UN security council resolution 2046 had threatened both Juba and Khartoum with sanctions if they failed to conclude negotiations by early August.</p> <p>However, the <a href=\"http://splmtoday.com/index.php/news-mainmenu-2/686-south-sudan-clinches-fair-oil-deal-with-sudan\" title=\"\">oil deal is conditional on further agreement on border demarcation and security arrangements</a>, which Khartoum insists means ending Juba's support for the rebels in the north.</p> <p>Similarly, the <a href=\"http://www.sudantribune.com/IMG/pdf/20120804_Tripartite_SPLM-N_Humanitarian_MoU.pdf\" title=\"\">memorandum of understanding</a> (pdf) between the Sudan People's Liberation Movement-North (SPLM-N) and the African Union, League of Arab States and UN tripartite on humanitarian assistance to Blue Nile and South Kordofan states requires negotiation of a cessation of hostilities and further political agreement; it could be delayed until the end of the rainy season, when the roads reopen.</p> <p>Veteran aid commentator John Ashworth said: \"There is a desperate need to get food and other relief items into the Nuba mountains (the main rebel-held area in South Kordofan) as quickly as possible, whether by road or air. But it is impossible to do so as long as the Khartoum regime continues to bomb and shell civilians. An internationally monitored ceasefire is needed immediately to allow humanitarian operations, and Khartoum must be pressured to enter meaningful negotiations to resolve the conflict peacefully.\"</p> <p>Last week, the World Food Programme (WFP) said it was going to <a href=\"http://www.wfp.org/news/news-release/wfp-plans-air-drops-continue-lifesaving-food-assistance-refugees-south-sudan\" title=\"\">start air-dropping relief supplies to refugees from the two areas in South Sudan</a> because the current rains made the roads impassable.</p> <p>A group of 96 international organisations has also <a href=\"http://www.internationaljusticeproject.com/2012/08/03/ijp-act-for-sudan-and-other-signatories-urge-unsc-to-implement-resolution-2046/\" title=\"\">written to the tripartite</a> (pdf) urging it to consider air drops across the border. They argue it is the only way to get aid to the area in time.</p> <p>Rebecca Tinsley of <a href=\"http://www.wagingpeace.info/\" title=\"\">Waging Peace</a>, one of the letter's signatories, branded both the aid access agreement and the oil deal \"a cynical attempt to meet the UN deadline, avoid sanctions, and wait until the international community once again loses interest in Sudan and South Sudan\".</p> <p>Yasir Arman, the SPLM-N secretary general, suggested the aid plan is unlikely to be operational until the start of the dry season in October. \"Khartoum is reluctant to agree a ceasefire because they want to sabotage the operation,\" he said.</p> <p>Arman complains of the \"moral equivalence\" afforded by the international community to his forces with Khartoum's proxy militias south of the border, particularly Joseph Kony's Lord's Resistance Army, against which the African Union is currently trying to launch a joint military operation with troops from the Central African Republic, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, South Sudan and Uganda, with US military assistance.</p> <p>Stressing that the SPLM-N was formed more than a quarter of a century ago \u2013 before Omar al-Bashir's seizure of power in a 1989 military coup \u2013 while the government of South Sudan has only existed for a year, Arman insisted: \"We are nobody's proxies.\"</p> <p>He said that, during the six-year interim period of the comprehensive peace agreement \u2013 which stipulated both sides had to work \"to make unity attractive\" \u2013 the SPLM-N were partners in a power-sharing government. They were labelled terrorists only after the southerners voted to secede, said Arman.</p> <p>The continued problems facing aid operations in Sudan were highlighted when Jamal Al Fadil Farag Allah, a 56-year-old Sudanese national working for the WFP, was <a href=\"http://www.wfp.org/news/news-release/wfp-deplores-fatal-shooting-staff-member-south-kordofan-sudan\" title=\"\">killed in an armed attack near Hilat Yatu</a>, around 80km north of Kadugli, the capital of South Kordofan state.</p> <p>WFP executive director Ertharin Cousin said: \"It is unacceptable for humanitarian workers to face attacks while they are working on the frontlines of hunger in countries like Sudan,\" which remains \"one of WFP's most challenging and complex operations\".</p> <p>Arman blamed Sudan's forces for the attack, which occurred in an area controlled by the government, insisting this was part of \"Khartoum's strategy of sabotaging the humanitarian access agreement, as has happened many times in Darfur\".</p> <p>Last week, the security council <a href=\"http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=42595&amp;Cr=&amp;Cr1\" title=\"\">renewed the mandate of Unamid, the African Union/UN peacekeeping operation in Darfur for another year</a>.</p> <p>On 3 August, the UN high commissioner for human rights urged Sudan to launch an <a href=\"http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=42619&amp;Cr=Darfur&amp;Cr1=\" title=\"\">independent investigation into the reported use of excessive force by government security forces</a> during a protest in Darfur, which resulted in eight deaths and injured more than 50 people.</p> <p>Arman maintains Khartoum will continue with its policy of mass starvation unless there is further pressure from the international community.</p>",

Male birds of paradise compete for the attention of females in courtship behaviour known as \u201clekking\u201d. Lekking involves males (like the one pictured here), either individually or in groups, showing off their feathers, hopping, head bopping and shaking their delicate long streamer-like plumage. If a male manages to impress a female he is rewarded with an opportunity to mate. Found in Papua New Guinea and Indonesia, there are 40 species of birds of paradise in the family Paradisaeidae listed on the IUCN Red List of which three, black sicklebill (<i>Epimachus fastuosus</i>), blue bird of paradise (<i>Paradisaea rudolphi</i>) and wahnes\u2019s parotia (<i>Parotia wahnesi</i>) are listed as threatened</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tim Laman/NaturePL</span> </figcaption> </figure>"
