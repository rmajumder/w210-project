  "<p>Will the popularity of <em>Parade's End</em> (just ending) and <em>Downton Abbey</em> (just beginning) lead to a spike in sales for Penguin's beautiful reissue of <a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9781905490998\" title=\"Arabella Boxer's Book of English Food\">Arabella Boxer's <em>Book of English Food</em></a>? I hope so. An elegant if rather patrician writer \u2013 if I read her right, she is absolutely convinced that most domestic servants loved their work \u2013 Boxer tells the story of the flowering of English food between the wars, an unexpected bloom that occurred mostly in the houses of very posh people and which died with the outbreak of the second world war. The recipes are delicious, relatively straightforward, and fabulously camp. Even better, she cites the provenance of every one, with the unexpectedly spiffing result that, this autumn, we can all be a little bit posh. There is a certain amount of pleasure to be had in serving up a dish like Steamed Spring Vegetable Pie, and announcing casually: \"Ah, yes. This was a favourite of Lord Berners, you know. He used to serve it at Faringdon.\" But then, I have a borderline obsession with <a href=\"http://www.faringdon.org/hyberners.htm\" title=\"greedy old Berners\">greedy old Berners</a>, an aesthete who liked cream with everything, and who dyed his mayonnaise blue using a special powder sent from Paris by Vera Stravinsky.</p> <p>It would be worth buying <em>English Food</em> for Boxer's opening essay alone. The anecdotes that stud it, like currants in a bun, are far funnier than anything Julian Fellowes has ever come up with. For instance: in the 1920s and 30s, professional cooks were careful to keep their best recipes secret. Take Mrs Woodburn, who cooked for the Mildmays for 50 years. (Who are these Mildmays? Boxer writes of them as if we should know, with the result that I have a strong urge to pretend that I'm on nodding terms with every one of their descendants.) Mrs Woodburn had an asparagus ice for which she was famous, and when the Queen Mother, then the Queen, was staying at Flete (where is this Flete? will my National Trust card permit me to stalk its ballroom?), she asked her for the recipe. Alas, no dice. \"Yer husband asked me for that,\" said Mrs Woodburn. \"But I wouldn't give it to him.\" If Fellowes wrote this scene, cook would blush to her roots, and rush off to inscribe the receipt in her best handwriting, on finest parchment.</p> <p>It's Boxer's contention, though, that the new food of the 20s was developed not in the kitchens of our great houses, which continued to turn out heavy Edwardian dishes, but up in town, where a new generation of hostesses \u2013 Emerald Cunard, Nancy Astor, Wallis Simpson, Sibyl Colefax \u2013 were busy teaching everyone else how to be modern by painting their drawing rooms white, breakfasting in bed, and offering their guests an exotic new confection known as Rice Krispies (<em>Downton Abbey</em> would ideally be invaded by a crusading interior designer some time quite soon, were its writer not so chronically obsessed with a certain vision of the past). These women were influenced by their roots \u2013 some were American-born \u2013 and by taste-makers such as June Platt, the cookery writer at <em>Vogue</em>, and Lady Sysonby, whose cookbook had illustrations by Oliver Messel, the stage designer, and an introduction by Osbert Sitwell. I say \"modern\" but, of course, we're not talking about a salad scattered with lentils and a few bits of goat's cheese. A quick pre-dinner drink at Wallis's place involved the handing round of nine different canapes, eight of them hot. (And mind the white carpet when you bite!)</p> <p>Entertaining, if one did it properly, was an exhausting business. Even in London, dinner parties were vast; at her house in Charles Street, Mrs Ronnie Greville had 56 guests to dinner in 1928. Were people pleased to receive such lavish hospitality? Not always. Some things never change. Your guests, or mine, might hop into a minicab and bitch all the way home. Guests of these top society hostesses would write the whole thing up in their diaries. In 1930, Harold Nicolson \u2013 the writer husband of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/vita-sackville-west\" title=\"Vita-Sackville West\">Vita Sackville-West</a> \u2013 was invited to Cliveden by Nancy Astor. But Harold, judging by his tone, would rather have stayed at home: \"Thirty two people in the house\u2026 Little groups of people wishing they were alone... After dinner, in order to enliven the party, Lady Astor dons a Victorian hat and a pair of false teeth. It does not enliven the party.\" What a bore Nicolson must have been. Berners, whether for the right reasons or wrong, would have laughed until the blue mayonnaise shot right out of his nose.</p>",
  "<p>Germany, France and Spain want a defence industry \u2013 so does Britain. The only structure that makes any sense as defence spending is slashed everywhere is for the national industries to be brought together into one single European defence contractor. Last week EADS, the umbrella company for the German, French and Spanish defence industries, and Britain's BAE Systems <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/sep/14/bae-eads-merger-lockheed-pentagon?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">proposed to do just that </a>in a \u00a330bn merger.</p> <p>It will be a giant company. All four governments will jockey for advantage; the deal could fail. The US might signal it is not interested in giving business beyond the British. But for all that, the logic is obvious. Divided, European defence contractors will fail. United they might hold the line \u2013 giving European countries a defence capability to act independently from the US, along with maintaining jobs and frontier technology.Everybody in the defence community has understood the inevitability of this for years.</p> <p>Similarly with the armed services. British defence chiefs have always been privately in favour of developing a joint European army, navy and air force A British general and admiral would have a good chance of commanding the European army and navy, forces with real clout..</p> <p>European countries' strategic defence interests, after all, are almost identical. What the British military faces instead is decades of decline in morale, ageing equipment and military marginalisation, increasingly neutered. It is a parallel story in finance. Our Eurosceptic chancellor was in Cyprus to defend British interests to the last as the EU launches its new system of banking supervision \u2013 which even he concedes is a vital precondition to securing the future of the euro. Treasury officials privately admit we don't have a negotiating position. Britain can be safely ignored. Essentially the European Central Bank, Germany, France and the European Commission will decide on the pan-European regulatory regime: British banks, to sustain their business, will have to follow suit.</p> <p>In other words the fate of two great British industries \u2013 defence and financial services \u2013 is now intertwined with the EU. There is no other option. You might think that as a country there would be some resolve to stay in the governing councils of the political architecture managing our continent, and of which, ineluctably, we are part. This is the only way to nurture our great industries and remain an influence within the power relationships that determine the modern world. Supranational governance and collaboration are inescapable: and for a European country that means engaging with the EU.</p> <p>Yet almost no one will say so \u2013 virtually no politician, commentator or business leader will speak out. They might get castigated as \"guilty men\" by a media mob for \"selling out\" to Europe, when in truth the guilty men and women are those conniving \u2013 actively and passively \u2013 in the process of our marginalisation. Modern Europe is characterised as a spent force hidebound in red tape, welfarism and preoccupied with the absurd ambition of creating a single currency. National sovereignty and the Anglo-Saxon community are what Britain must cherish. The future allegedly lies in China, despite the fact that a Chinese Spring \u2013 and associated turmoil \u2013 is drawing closer.</p> <p>It is a mindset in which the immediate end of the euro has now been joyfully \u2013 and wrongfully \u2013 predicted some half a dozen times in the last two years. Almost every self-respecting commentator on left and right has felt it a badge of honour to deride the euro and anyone who supports it as a fool and a knave. Yet the euro is still standing. When there are elections and referendums \u2013 in Greece, Ireland and Holland \u2013 pro-European parties win, democratically validating this alleged anti-democratic project. The key measures to make the euro survive \u2013 the creation of a European Stability Mechanism, the buying of euro bonds by the European Central Bank and pan-European banking supervision \u2013 have been or are being put into place.</p> <p>Real wages are falling painfully to produce the required adjustment, especially in Ireland and Greece. Greece will get more time to service its debts. Although the next 18 months of collective austerity \u2013 in my view vastly more than what was needed \u2013 will be tough, after that the EU will start to grow again. The euro will survive.</p> <p>There is rational Euroscepticism \u2013 grounded in genuine concerns about the likelihood of creating a pan-European democracy and integrating disparate economies. In fact one of the by-products of the crisis has been the creation of a phenomenal cross-European democratic discussion: Europeans know more about each other than ever before.</p> <p>Equally, the German challenge to many eurozone countries \u2013 be serious about production and wealth-creation as we are \u2013 is well made and being accepted. But the proposed EADs/BAE Systems merger highlights that even rational scepticism is trumped by another reality: if we want to preserve strategic industries and grow others they need the clout and scale that only European countries acting collaboratively can provide.</p> <p>I can't and don't pretend the current euro is great; I only maintain that it is better than the way floating exchange rates work in reality \u2013 \"dirty floats\" (where central banks seek to manipulate their native rates) and competitive devaluations. Also, Europe gets some countervailing power on Germany. But none of these reflections cut any ice with irrational Euroscepticism \u2013 the fulminations of former defence secretary Liam Fox, for example, or those of Ukip leader Nigel Farrage or of most of our media.</p> <p>Increasingly I see them as European versions of the Tea Party; passionately arguing for bonfires of red tape, low taxes; anti-Brussels instead of anti-Washington. And, like the Tea Party, if the facts don't fit make them up. Yet does anybody seriously believe that red tape \u2013 home- and EU-made \u2013 is really the cause of an even longer and deeper recession than that of the 1930s? Nor is social spending, as long as it is well-designed not to undermine incentives, anywhere associated with economic underperformance.</p> <p>The future of our defence, like the future of the City, lies in making common cause with Europe. It will be a rocky ride \u2013 the sceptics could yet force and win an anti-EU referendum. But exit will only trigger a faster recognition of the reality that is forcing the proposed deal between BAE and EADS. Our only future is European. Before 2030 Britain will be applying to join the euro \u2013 and thus beginning a catch-up with a Europe which by then will be much more prosperous than us, looted by our feckless elite and their Eurosceptic apologists. Watch and wait.</p>",
  "<h2><strong>BUZZWORDS/SLOGANS</strong></h2> <p>\"Rebuilding Britain\" will be Labour's catchphrase for Manchester 2012. The message is that Ed Miliband is not just a wonk but a man of action \u2013 the political version of Bob the Builder. Less catchy is Miliband's latest favourite word, if it can be called that, \"pre-distribution\": by which he means spending more on young people, early on, so they are equipped better for the world of work.</p> <p>The Tories will stress how difficult it is governing when there is no money (the slogan may be \"leadership in tough times\"). With Boris Johnson on the prowl, they have to gently trash the mayor of London. \"Serious people for serious times\" is a message they put out to dig at him. As for the Liberal Democrats, expect \"fairness\" and \"fair taxes\" to be themes as they desperately try to show they really are taking on the Tories.</p> <h2><strong>DODGY FRINGE PLOTS</strong></h2> <p>Johnson is not a subtle man. He has chosen to talk at a fringe meeting entitled \"Re-elected and Olympotastic\" along with Cameron's arch-critic Tim Montgomerie from the website ConHome. Johnson is expected to talk with great wit, some self-deprecation, and many references to the classics, about his brilliant summer outshining the prime minister. Meanwhile, the oh-so-coy mating games of figures in Labour and on the left of the Lib Dems will be on display. Miliband's policy man Jon Cruddas and Lord Adonis will be flashing some political leg at an event about the age of pluralism in politics at the Lib Dems, while Simon Hughes is expected to flirt wildly at the Labour conference.</p> <h2><strong>FOLLOW MY LEADER: THE BIG SPEECHES</strong></h2> <p>Cameron will need to hit the Tory sweet spot if he is to send everyone home happy \u2013 and that means avoiding incendiary issues in the shires, such as gay marriage and the green agenda. Expect him to be anti-EU, anti-wind farms, tough on crime, tough on spending. Rightwing, in other words. Miliband will need to show he will be as tough as the Tories on spending while helping low earners and the squeezed middle. Nick Clegg has to show that, after losing on electoral reform and the House of Lords, he can now fight to the death for something else: a wealth tax or Vince Cable's mansion tax?</p> <h2><strong>THE NEW GURUS</strong></h2> <p>Now that Steve Hilton is gone from No 10, gurus are pretty much out in Tory land. But in Labour land they still come and go with regularity. Not long ago Miliband was embracing Maurice (now Lord) Glasman, until he dropped a brick or two over immigration and other things. Now Australian philosopher Tim Soutphommasane is suddenly the rage. American philosopher Michael Sandel, author of <em>What Money Can't Buy</em>, will be speaking at Labour. For the Lib Dems there will be interest in Ryan Coetzee, previously of the South African Democratic Alliance, headhunted as a new adviser to Clegg.</p> <h2><strong>PARTY ANIMALS</strong><br></h2> <p>Best bashes this year: the Spectator party at the Tories and the New Statesman at Labour. News International parties are not quite what they were.</p> <h2><strong>NEW WONKS</strong><br></h2> <p>Conservative Voice, a joint venture of disaffected Tory big beasts Liam Fox and David Davis, was launched with much fanfare and, no doubt, no small amount of wincing by Cameron last week. It says it exists to help promote policy. But it might just help promote Fox and Davis, too. The Resolution Foundation is independent but with Gordon Brown's former deputy chief of staff, Gavin Kelly, at its head, Labour is likely to learn most from its work. The leftwing of the Liberal Democrats, meanwhile, is on the rise and the Social Liberal Forum's members, including the irrepressible Lord Oakeshott, will no doubt be stirring again.</p> <h2><strong>STAR TURN</strong><br></h2> <p>Nadine Dorries is warming up nicely for Tory conference. While she is unlikely to find herself on the platform, the MP for Mid Bedfordshire last week suggested the party needed a \"kill Cameron policy\". She has been quick to insist that she was talking metaphorically, but her rhetorical flourishes are set to enliven conference on the fringes.</p> <h2><strong>COLOUR SCHEMES</strong><br></h2> <p>Expect a little less of the green tree motif and a lot more of the deep dark blue of Tory yesteryear on display in Birmingham for the Conservatives \u2013 and don't look for evidence of once fashionable \"Red Tory\" ideas. Conveniently, the venue, the International Conference Centre, already has blue as its colour scheme, so there won't be any confusion.</p> <p>Some leftwing Lib Democrats were suspicious of that last year when their party conference was staged there. The purple of New Labour has been resolutely ditched. \"Red Ed\" is sticking with what he knows, though he continues to flirt with \"Blue Labour\" attachment to communities. Intriguingly, on the agenda for the Liberal Democrat conference there is a large picture of a smiling Nick Clegg \u2013 wearing a red tie. Is he trying to tell us something?</p>",
  "<p>He did it very well, did David Cameron. One of the dimensions of being prime minister at which he excels is crafting the right language and striking the appropriate tone on grave or shocking occasions or, in this case, responding on behalf of both government and country to a shockingly grave report. He delivered a model statement of penitence for what he correctly called \"the double injustice\" done to the victims of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/hillsborough-disaster\" title=\"\">Hillsborough</a> stadium crush.</p> <p>It is always easier, mind, to say sorry for a disaster that was someone else's fault. The bigger test is what happens next. It is wrong to think of Hillsborough, and the disgusting conduct of some members of the South Yorkshire force, as a tragedy to be deeply regretted and then filed away as an event belonging to the distant past. It is true that stadium design has been massively improved and methods of crowd control have become more sophisticated. Football hooliganism, fear of which was a contributory factor, has largely disappeared from Britain. So a tragedy of that type is less likely to happen now.</p> <p>What cannot be said with so much confidence is that the police would never behave like that again. It would be a comfort to think that Hillsborough was an isolated example from long ago of officers attempting to conceal their own neglect and incompetence by lying about what had happened and smearing the victims of their mistakes. It would also be a false consolation. What happened at Hillsborough was not an isolated one-off, but a particularly horrific example from a pattern of policing scandals over many decades. The very long list includes multiple miscarriages of justice such as the false imprisonment of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/birmingham-six\" title=\"\">Birmingham Six</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/guildford-four\" title=\"\">Guildford Four</a>. The shooting of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/gallery/2007/oct/01/demenezes\" title=\"\">Jean Charles de Menezes</a> and the death of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/g20-police-assault-ian-tomlinson\" title=\"\">Ian Tomlinson</a> at the G20 protests are two more recent cases where the police made appalling errors and then tried to cover up their mistakes. Scotland Yard's failure to properly investigate the hacking scandal exposed alarming lacunae in the ethical and professional judgment of some of the most senior officers in the Met. Other officers face trials for corruptly selling information to newspapers.</p> <p>There are many dedicated men and women doing a job which can be highly demanding, often dangerous, and sometimes life-threatening, and they do it in a spirit of public service. But that cannot be said of the police as a collective. Hillsborough is a particularly grotesque illustration of a culture that to this day too often puts its own interests before those of the public it is paid to serve. Repeated scandal is what happens when you have a closed profession highly resistant to scrutiny or criticism whose default instinct is to protect its own.</p> <p>It is also the result of a failure of political will to pursue reform. The approach of Margaret Thatcher and Tony Blair was not to challenge police working practices or culture. For her, they were \"one of us\" and crucial allies in her epic battles with the trades unions. Mrs Thatcher responded to an earlier report about Hillsborough by telling her then home secretary, Douglas Hurd, to mute the government response to devastating evidence of police misconduct. For Tony Blair, being pro-police was a vital ingredient of being New Labour. He loaded them with many additional powers and generously increased budgets. To a reform-minded home secretary, Mr Blair once demanded: \"Do we really want a fight with the police?\"</p> <p>To see what he was frightened of, you only have to look at the trade union of their rank-and-file officers, the Police Federation. Visiting the Federation's annual conference is the scariest date in the home secretary's diary. Earlier in the year, they boorishly humiliated Theresa May when she tried to make her voice heard through the booing and heckling. She should not take that personally. They dealt out the same treatment to Labour home secretaries too.</p> <p>Millions of employees in the private sector have learnt that there is no longer such a thing as a \"job for life\" while millions in the public sector have been challenged to justify their existence. Working practices have been revolutionised; organisations radically restructured; pay and conditions dramatically changed. Teachers, nurses, ambulance drivers, doctors, local authority workers and firefighters have all felt bracing blasts of government-driven change. The big exception has been the police.</p> <p>There has been some progress, including a serious effort to purge racism since the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/1999/feb/24/lawrence.ukcrime12\" title=\"\">Macpherson inquiry into the Stephen Lawrence case</a>. But compared with everyone else, the police are the last unreformed public service.</p> <p>Because Labour prime ministers tend to become nervous of looking anti-police, it probably takes Conservative ministers to reform the forces of law and order. David Cameron and Theresa May made a bold start when they commissioned the first fundamental review of police pay and practices in 30 years by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/jun/27/tom-winsor-chief-inspector-constabulary\" title=\"\">Tom Winsor</a>, the former rail regulator. They have also demonstrated a seriousness of intent about implementing his recommendations by making him chief inspector of constabulary, an appointment which has provoked fierce outrage in the ranks. When he takes up the post this autumn, it will be the first time that the role has been performed by someone from outside the police since its creation in 1856.</p> <p>The government has also set great store by the novelty of elected police and crime commissioners, the most dramatic change in police governance ever. Making chief constables accountable to commissioners, so it is believed, will challenge the whole culture of policing. Forces will have someone independent constantly looking over their shoulders. One minister who is an enthusiast for commissioners says: \"What would have happened in South Yorkshire in 1989 had there been an elected person in charge? Their whole purpose in life would have been to find out what the hell happened.\"</p> <p>I would certainly hope so, but there are problems with the commissioners even before a single one is in post. The quality of the candidates is patchy, ranging from people with the potential to be excellent invigilators to old party hacks. The number of people turning out to vote is going to be abysmal because, when the original timetable slipped, the government took a crazy decision to make these standalone elections in the inclement month of November rather than combine them with the county council elections next May. Most informed people I talk to, including those running the campaigns, reckon they will be lucky if turnout averages 15%. Commissioners elected on such a small vote may have legitimacy issues which will embolden the police to try to ignore them.</p> <p>An even more important question is whether the Winsor reforms can be pushed through against the ferocious hostility of many officers. They don't like his proposal to widen the pool of talent from which police leaders are drawn by allowing direct entry into the higher ranks, breaking the tradition that all officers must start out as a beat constable. Another resisted reform is that officers should be rewarded for their skills, performance and hours spent on the front line rather than the length of service. Were we talking about any other part of the public sector, ministers could just get on and implement these changes. They can't do this with the police because of the no-strike deal. So the fate of Mr Winsor's most crucial recommendations are being determined by a body called the police arbitration tribunal.</p> <p>On top of which, the minister most passionate about reform has just quit. <a href=\"http://www.nickherbert.com/\" title=\"\">Nick Herbert,</a> who had a real zeal for the challenge, left the government in the recent reshuffle. He has been replaced by <a href=\"http://www.damiangreenmp.org.uk/galleryflash.aspx?id=25\" title=\"\">Damian Green</a>, who was moved to the police brief from immigration, and must think that all the clich\u00e9s about the frying pan and the fire apply. A few years back, Mr Green was the target of a ludicrously misconceived police operation when officers raided the MP's home and parliamentary offices. So Mr Green is probably not the sort to go soft on police reform. In the end, though, the outcome of this battle will most depend on the mettle of his seniors, the home secretary and the prime minister. The police never come quietly. As one former chief constable puts it, there is an \"inbuilt conservatism\" about the service which makes it \"often risk-averse, process-dominated and defensive.\" It is a big thing for governments to take on the police, which is why ministers have so rarely done it.</p> <p>David Cameron demonstrated how accomplished he can be at making a pitch-perfect parliamentary statement with his eloquent apology for Hillsborough. Getting the police to accept and implement reform will require different leadership skills. This will be a test of how much steel there is in his spine.</p>",
  "<p>A British professor of German history has published an extraordinary expos\u00e9 of the secret Nazi past of the man who married her godmother.</p> <p><em>A Small Town Near Auschwitz</em>, written by Mary Fulbrook, who teaches at University College London, and to be published this week, tells the story of Udo Klausa, a man Fulbrook's family believed was involved only in mundane local government during the war years.</p> <p>However, she has unearthed unpublished material that reveals his role as a Nazi backroom administrator of the Holocaust, operating close to Auschwitz concentration camp, where more than a million Jews died. On discovering the true nature of his activities, Fulbrook said: \"I felt literally like I'd been punched in the stomach. I was angry and shocked. I partly wrote the book almost to rub his face posthumously in the murderous consequence of his actions.\"</p> <p>Delving into Klausa's past was especially painful for her because her own mother \u2013 a close friend of Klausa's wife, Alexandra \u2013 was a German-Jewish refugee who lost friends and relatives to the Holocaust. It was through her mother's childhood friendship with Alexandra that Fulbrook obtained access for the first time to Klausa's unpublished memoir, written long after the war, and to dozens of wartime letters written by Alexandra.</p> <p>They reveal a man who \"produced the preconditions\" for selections and deportations. Klausa was the <em>landrat \u2013</em> or civilian administrator \u2013 of a sizeable county in eastern Upper Silesia, north of Auschwitz in Poland, where thousands of people lost their liberty or their lives to his civilian policies. Yet the writings suggest that he never witnessed the results of his actions and had seemingly convinced himself of his own innocence.</p> <p>Fulbrook was shocked to discover how few references there were to atrocities against Jews around Bendsburg, the small town where Klausa and his family lived \u2013 even though people had been burned alive, shot, hanged or deported.</p> <p>One depraved act in a neighbouring county involved forcing Jews to lie for hours forming a path of human paving-stones over which Nazis walked in heavy boots. An eyewitness recorded a German standing on a Jew's face until it was \"squashed to pieces\". \"These omissions from his memoirs are extraordinary,\" Fulbrook said. \"He has no memory of atrocities. This is really important in understanding how the Holocaust was possible. It shows the way in which you could live with that kind of past, cover it up and present yourself as a perfectly decent, ordinary civil servant who had nothing to do with the atrocities.</p> <p>\"If he'd conveyed anything like fear, regret, guilt, shame, I would have felt much more comfortable. But it's just a whitewashed past.\"</p> <p>Letters sent in 1942 by Alexandra to her own mother suggest that Klausa was disturbed by the unfolding events \u2013 they refer to her husband's \"even worse\" mood. But mass killings are mentioned coldly. Alexandra wrote: \"There is constant shooting, everywhere dead Jews are lying around \u2026 One simply can't avoid seeing all this, and the constant shooting drives one quite mad.\"</p> <p>Fulbrook said the material offered a new perspective on perpetrator mentality. Other studies have focused on prominent Nazis and frontline killers or their victims, she said. But the victims only ever saw the people in the frontline of physical violence, the SS and Gestapo, the designated \"perpetrators\". The backroom civilian administrators were unknown to them.</p> <p>She came across Klausa's story while \"idly\" sifting through her mother's old letters. Among them was a typed memento created by Klausa's son in memory of Alexandra. It drew on his mother's own letters. One referred to 15,000 Jews being deported. Fulbrook said: \"I thought, 'Where on earth was she to witness this in one day?'\u2009\"</p> <p>Alexandra was writing from Bendsburg, Fulbrook said. \"I'd never heard of it. I Googled it.\" It was the Germanised name for the occupied Polish town of Bedzin.</p> <p>There was also passing mention of Klausa as a <em>landrat</em>. Fulbrook said that, even though she is a German historian, she does not understand a landrat's functions. There was no literature on it \u2013 \"let alone a landrat close to Auschwitz\".</p> <p>It was after investigating further that she discovered <em>landrats</em> were charged with implementation of Nazi directives. Klausa went along with Nazi policies, ensuring Jews wore the yellow star, did not break the curfew, and did not use public transport or enter areas forbidden to them.</p> <p>After the war, West German law for prosecuting war criminals allowed the defence of \"following orders\" to escape a murder charge. \"Thereby, Klausa fell out of the picture completely,\" Fulbrook said. He was never tried and later became director of a Rhineland regional council. In the book, she writes: \"One part of me wants to yell back at Klausa \u2026 to scream that, without him and countless other functionaries \u2026 Hitler could never have wrought such mass destruction.\"</p>",
  "<p>In the catalogue that accompanies this exhibition, curator Kate Bush writes: \"Photography does not merely illustrate the world, it articulates it.\" <a href=\"http://www.barbican.org.uk/artgallery/event-detail.asp?ID=13613\" title=\"\">Everything Was Moving</a> attempts to show not just how the medium articulated the various political and cultural upheavals of the 1960s, but how it responded to the often self-questioning experiments of contemporary conceptual artists like Andy Warhol and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2010/sep/12/ed-ruscha-obama-pop-art\" title=\"\">Ed Ruscha</a>. The&nbsp;predominant creative dynamic in the show, though, is the one articulated in the 1950s by Henri Cartier-Bresson, who proposed that photography should&nbsp;strive to find \"a balance... between two worlds \u2013 the one inside us and the one outside us\".</p> <p>Bruce Davidson, whose evocative, sometimes shocking images of America&nbsp;during the civil rights era are on show here, merged those two worlds, one subjective, the other objective, by challenging the notion that the documentary photographer should be a detached observer. When he accompanied the 10 young men on the <a href=\"http://www.magnumphotos.com/Catalogue/Bruce-Davidson/1963/USA-Mississippi-Freedom-March-NN17181.html\" title=\"\">Mississippi freedom march</a> in 1963&nbsp;\u2013 \"five whites and five blacks, walking down an isolated two-lane highway in the middle of nowhere\" \u2013 he regarded himself, he later said, as \"the 11th marcher\".</p> <p>The undiminished power of Davidson's photographs attest to his eye for the illuminating detail \u2013 a gesture, a gaze, a single solemn face in an agitated crowd \u2013 and to the risks he often took in getting so close to his subjects \u2013 the marchers and the angry white men who tailed them every step of the way.</p> <p>One of the strongest juxtapositions in a show that relies on the drama of contrasting, even opposing, approaches is between Davidson's work and that of William Eggleston. Both photographers shot extensively in America's deep south, but the results, superficially at least, suggest that they may as well have been working on different planets. It is not just the contrast between Davidson's black and white reportage and Eggleston's vivid, brooding colours, but the difference in artistic temperament and vision. Eggleston's democratic eye lights on the most seemingly mundane of subjects \u2013 a ceiling, a rusting road sign, the back of a woman's head \u2013 and somehow these disparate images add up to a unified aesthetic. Here, the American south is a state of mind as much as anything else: a menacing place of odd shadows and unreal light.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/2011/jan/25/david-goldblatt-photography-guillot-review\" title=\"\">David Goldblatt</a> has spent more than six decades photographing his native South Africa and his detached, formal, but thought-provoking images of the apartheid era are a testament to the abnormal normality of that time and place. In one, a row of black faces in a mixed crowd stare at a line of young white women in swimming costumes, entrants in a Miss Lovely Legs competition. In another, entitled <em>The Maid's Room</em>, a newspaper rests on a chair beside a makeshift single bed and a cardboard carpet. The headline reads \"Moon men on the way back\". Life goes on, these photographs say, in a grotesquely normalised way.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/jan/23/ernest-cole-photographer-apartheid-review\" title=\"\">Ernest Cole</a>'s images emphasise the singular importance of a photographer who also grew up under apartheid and who responded to its daily ignominies in an endlessly resourceful way. Having managed to get himself reclassified as \"coloured\" rather than \"black\", Cole moved freely between the townships and the white sectors, often shooting visual narratives that showed the distance between the two. His snatched shot of a well-dressed white man casually slapping a young black boy around the face as he walks past him on the street is one of the most arresting images in the entire show. Cole died an exile, penniless and homeless, in New York in 1990, the week after Nelson Mandela was freed from prison.</p> <p>The other artists in Everything Was Moving are given less space, and the juxtapositions seem less dramatic, though Larry Burrows's richly coloured action tableaux of American soldiers in combat in Vietnam are provocatively contrasted with Shomei Tomatsu's grainy black-and-white images of what he saw as an increasingly Americanised Japan. In 1961, Tomatsu visited Nagasaki to record the city's reconstruction. There, he photographed exhibits in the local museum, including a <a href=\"http://www.michaelhoppengallery.com/artist,show,1,105,0,0,0,0,0,0,shomei_tomatsu.html\" title=\"\">beer bottle</a> so distorted by the force of the atomic blast that it resembled a skinned pig hanging in a restaurant.</p> <p>The influence of conceptual practice is most visible in the early pictures of Boris Mikhailov, whose series of doubly exposed visual satires on Soviet censorship, <em>Yesterday's Sandwich</em> (1968-1975), add up to a scrapbook-like impression of a world where the personal was always political. More elliptical still is Sigmar Polke's series of 14 photographs of a staged fight between two dogs and a bear, which he took in Afghanistan in 1974. A swipe at Russian imperialism, the images are less easy to read on any other level, their surfaces having been covered in dark washes and stains. This is photography challenging photography's reliability, but the series seems out of place here.</p> <p>I was intrigued by Graciela Iturbide's modernist portraits of the nomadic Seri people of rural Mexico and by Raghubir Singh's vivid images of Indian life. In one unforgettable shot, two sari-clad girls fly almost horizontally on a makeshift rope above a crowd of women and children. After Li Zhensheng's huge panoramic tableaux of demonstrations and mass rallies in Mao's China, it was like entering a different world.</p> <p>Indeed, there are so many different worlds here that the very idea of a historical moment is challenged. It is more a set of vivid glimpses of a period in which everything that was moving was caught, and transformed, by a generation alert to the myriad possibilities of photography.</p>",
  "<p>Tate Britain's enormous pre-Raphaelite exhibition has 200 works \u2013 paintings, drawings, sculptures, wallpaper designs, embroidered bedspreads \u2013 and a single unifying theory. This is announced in the terse subtitle. The curators apparently want us to believe in the pre-Raphaelite brotherhood as Britain's first modern art movement, radical, difficult, rebellious, dangerously innovative and experimental. Why, even the bedspreads are avant garde.</p> <p>This counterintuitive claim sounds like a case of Victorian humbug in itself. It wants to turn the pre-Raphaelites into proto-modernists, up there with the cubists or the abstract expressionists, even though their entire aesthetic is the most blatant and passionate denial of everything modern and 20th-century imaginable. It's a sensational argument, perhaps directed at a new young generation of gallery-goers. But it also feels like a faintly apologetic attempt to give the old boys a lift, casting their art as strange when it is the very definition of overfamiliarity.</p> <p>For though this is the first Tate survey in almost 30 years, it never feels that way. The pre-Raphaelites are always with us. This show has all the classics you can see for free in our public museums, from Henry Wallis's dead <a href=\"http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/wallis-chatterton-n01685\" title=\"\"><em>Chatterton</em></a><em> </em>to Millais's <a href=\"http://www2.tate.org.uk/ophelia/\" title=\"\"><em>Ophelia</em></a> in her lush Surrey stream, from Holman Hunt's scapegoat cast out into the purple desert to his most popular period hit, <a href=\"http://www.manchestergalleries.org/the-collections/search-the-collection/display.php?EMUSESSID=a3a181b17a763ede8fe42afc4e288488&amp;irn=596\" title=\"\"><em>The Light of the World</em></a><em> </em>(1851-56), with Christ appearing in satin, rubies and 24-carat halo against a seething&#xa0;twilight.</p> <p>Painfully literal \u2013 Christ holds a big light \u2013 and laboriously allegoric, with its weeds, fallen apples and rusty door, against which Our Saviour knocks, this painting (in its many editions) was the Turin Shroud of the Victorian empire. Seven million people queued to see it from South Africa to New Zealand, some sinking to their knees in reverence. This is not avant-garde art, this is painting as moral and spiritual&#xa0;guidance.</p> <p>Perhaps it's unfair to cite Holman Hunt in evidence against the show's argument. He is (to me) the least palatable of the pre-Raphaelites, the most didactic, sentimental and oppressive. His <em>Shadow of Death</em>, in which the young Christ, with alarmingly prominent veins, stretches his arms wide to throw a cruciform shadow over a rack of nails in his father's workshop, rams the point home so insistently it seems to resist appreciation altogether as art.</p> <p>It's easier to contemplate the other pre-Raphaelites with modern eyes. There are the super-real details adored by the surrealists, and that heightened sense of the frozen moment that may have come from looking at early daguerreotypes. There are the sub-Freudian symbols and the weirdly suggestive shadows.</p> <p>Millais's <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferdinand_Lured_by_Ariel\" title=\"\"><em>Ferdinand Lured by Ariel</em></a> is so dreamlike in its excessive particularity it could have been made on LSD. Twenty different kinds of grass have been identified in its patch of meadow, and Ariel is not the standard Victorian fairy but a bizarre hermaphrodite buoyed up by cabbage-coloured bats. Burne-Jones's protagonists, with their faraway dark-ringed eyes, appear so transfixed they could be narcotised.</p> <p>All of this is very well conveyed in the show, along with the inspiration the pre-Raphaelites found in medieval and renaissance art and \u2013 which is more of a revelation \u2013 the febrile visions of the 19th-century painter <a href=\"http://vonholst.info/\" title=\"\">Theodor von Holst</a>. Even the pre-Raphaelites' personal look (prolific sideburns, thick hanks of hair) turns out to have its origin in Germany's <a href=\"http://www.arthistoryarchive.com/arthistory/romanticism/Franz-Pforr-and-the-Nazarenes.html\" title=\"\">Nazarene</a> painters, a band of pious primitivists who worshipped D\u00fcrer and wore their hair long in homage.</p> <p>This is all abundantly clear from the pictures, as well as the texts. But the newer claims don't amount to very much. That Picasso admired an early Holman Hunt does not make the Victorian any more of a modern. That Kandinsky saw elements of abstraction in the work of Rossetti would surely have shocked the latter. Van Gogh may have admired Millais's <a href=\"http://www.wikipaintings.org/en/john-everett-millais/chill-october\" title=\"\"><em>Chill October</em></a> \u2013 that still, sear threat of winter in a watery landscape that makes one cold all over \u2013 but the painting is hardly a classic brotherhood narrative.</p> <p>Indeed, what this show really offers is not a new take on the pre-Raphaelites so much as the chance to be struck anew. For this is surely the oddest of art movements \u2013 obsessed with narrative, myth and fiction but addicted to pedantic fact; relentlessly symbolist and yet fanatically literal; contemporary in its preoccupation with prostitutes, workers, literacy, immigration and so on, yet with its roots in the medieval past.</p> <p>Consider that this is a movement whose primary purpose was for everyone to paint in roughly the same way, in which the aesthetic was so programmatic that you could teach even a very mediocre brush-man such as William Morris to copy it. A movement intent on supplying its audience with visible models of virtue and vice, hope and despair, temptation and responsibility, where every picture tells a story but the moral is spelled out all over again for the slow of learning in labels within the painting and homilies lettered across the gilded frames.</p> <p>This is an art that gives prominence to everything that can be researched \u2013 from the exact form of the stones outside Jerusalem to the pallor of a fading cornflower \u2013 but which gives the same weight to every single thing. An art in which nothing appears independent of the fact-checked precedent, in which there is no breath of life, no flexibility, no spontaneity.</p> <p>These paintings could not be made \u2013 or viewed \u2013 in a hurry. A full-scale allegory such as William Shakespeare Burton's <a href=\"http://www.the-athenaeum.org/art/detail.php?ID=39894&amp;msg=You+were+sent+here+because+this+artist+only+has+one+artwork+in+our+database.++This+is+it\" title=\"\"><em>The Wounded Cavalier</em></a> takes time to interpret, as you read your way from the expiring cavalier to the pack of fallen playing cards, the broken sword, the autumn tree and the red admiral alighting on the weapon at the dead centre of the painting. In the gloom stands a Puritan with a bible, looking down on this man who has lost his gamble. The Puritan is as upright as the tree trunk. Eight subscribers paid for this picture to be presented to the Corporation of London. It is painting as means of public address.</p> <p><em>The Wounded Cavalier</em> is something of a one-off because Burton invented the whole scenario, whereas most pre-Raphaelite costume dramas rely entirely on existing stories. <em>Hamlet</em>, <em>Pygmalion</em>, <em>Lilith</em>, <em>The Lady of Shalott</em>, even <em>The Return of the Dove from the Ark</em> \u2013 practically anything can be adjusted to accommodate the cataleptic damsels and drooping knights that infest this art.</p> <p>Indeed, the curators' contention that this art is notable for its variety of approaches seems no more plausible at first than the avant-garde argument. But anyone prepared to make the effort to keep alert through room after room of densely crowded pictures will see that this is in some senses true.</p> <p>Millais has a gift for visionary narrative anchored in extreme reality. He is the method painter par excellence (and so well represented here this amounts to a Millais show-within-a-show). Nobody is quite as weird as Rossetti and his monstrous regiment of women \u2013 all the same, even the so-called portraits of his wife \u2013 with their square jaws and centre partings, tumescent necks and vampire lips. And not even Holman Hunt, for all his electric lighting, is quite as artificial as Edward Burne-Jones, whose bloodless somnambulists are wandering about in some other world.</p> <p>But although the paintings may differ from one artist to the next, what strikes is the deadening pre-Raphaelite effect. The characteristics are always the same: glistening excess, lurid colour, that all-over emphasis and oppressive density of detail that leaves the eye with nowhere to go, that demands your obedient attention. This is an art that insists on telling you where to look, what to think and how to feel \u2013 that wants to turn you into a passive Burne-Jones zombie.</p>",

  "<p>It says something about the parlous state of modern blockbusters that any comic-book franchise flick made with a modicum of heart, soul and (most importantly) wit is immediately hailed as a game-changing event. Aficionados have long known that writer-director <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/joss-whedon\" title=\"\">Joss Whedon</a> is one of the good guys \u2013 a genre film-maker who understands both his source material and the fan culture that surrounds it \u2013 but the money-spinning success of the awkwardly titled (in the UK anyway) <strong>Marvel Avengers Assemble</strong> (2012, Disney, 12) has now cemented him as a Hollywood big hitter.</p> <p>This in itself is a reason to be cheerful, for while Michael Bay makes cynical millions treating his viewers with contempt, it's great to celebrate the success of a franchise film-maker who actually appears to like and respect his audience. Thus what could have been a join-the-dots mash-up of Marvel's biggest-hitting superheroes becomes a&#xa0;surprisingly coherent rallying call for a rag-tag band of dysfunctional odd-bods who view themselves as less of a team than a time bomb.</p> <p>Lending heavyweight thespian clout, Mark Ruffalo steps into the Hulk's stretchy pants as the tortured scientist attempting to keep a lid on his temper; Scarlett Johansson kicks everyone's ass as Black Widow; and Robert Downey Jr is reliably wired up as the screw-loose Iron Man. However, it's Tom Hiddleston's twisted Norse god Loki who steals the show with his horny headdress and Chaucerian epithets (when did you last hear the phrase \"mewling quim\" in a 12-cert romp?).</p> <p>It's not perfect; at times there are too just many character strands to maintain singular narrative momentum, and there's nothing here to match the weight and heft of <em>The Dark Knight Rises</em>. But at least the gloomy (both literally and metaphorically) opening sequences look brighter and clearer without the 3D specs that spoiled so many cinema screenings, and the overall impression is of a film made for love as well as money. Extras variously scattered across DVD, Blu-ray and double-disc editions include the short <em>Marvel One-Shot: Item 47</em> (featuring Lizzy Caplan) which became the toast of Comic-Con.</p> <p>The central conceit of the Uruguayan horror film <em>La Casa Muda</em> was that it appeared to be have been shot in real time in one continuous take, although (like Hitchcock's <em>Rope</em>) there were in fact several edit points hiding in the darkness. Film-makers Chris Kentis and Laura Lau repeat this trick for<strong> </strong><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Silent-House-Elizabeth-Olsen/dp/B007L6VP8W\" title=\"\"><strong>Silent House</strong></a> (2011, StudioCanal, 15), a now obligatory (but still perfunctory) American remake of yet another subtitled shocker that brings little to the table other than English dialogue and a comparatively bloated budget.</p> <p>Rising star Elizabeth Olsen carries the movie shoulder-high as the neurotic young woman trapped in an old house haunted by demons inextricably tied up with her own repressed past. Yet talented and mercurial as Olsen may be (see <em>Martha Marcy May Marlene</em> for proof), even she finds it hard to do much with a role that requires her to hit a level of jibbering hysteria all too early. The result is like listening to Michael Bolton crucifying a selection of ballads&#xa0;in which he turns everything up to 11 on the first chorus, leaving you&#xa0;wondering where the hell he can go from there.</p> <p>Austrian actor Karl Markovics makes a confident and arresting directorial debut with <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Breathing-DVD-Thomas-Schubert/dp/B007TWHE6A\" title=\"\"><strong>Breathing</strong></a><strong> </strong>(2011, Verve, 15), a melancholic drama in which an institutionalised teenager finds himself holding down a probational job at a Vienna morgue wherein the spectre of his lost mother is invoked. Boasting a movingly unaffected central performance by Thomas Schubert and suggesting a solid career behind the camera for Markovics, this impressively atmospheric work marries social realism with poetic licence to fine and clearly heartfelt effect, and was Austria's official submission for this year's foreign-language film Oscar.</p> <p>Is Gordon Ramsay cinema's most unwelcome screen presence? On the evidence of last year's <em>Love's Kitchen</em>, in which the potty-mouthed TV chef proved unable to play even himself convincingly, the answer would seem to be yes. Yet watching<strong> </strong><a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/El-Bulli-DVD-Ferran-Adri%C3%A0/dp/B008ACGLVM\" title=\"\"><strong>El Bulli</strong></a> (2011, Artificial Eye, 12), a documentary about the avant-garde restaurant in which cooking and science experiments are indistinguishable, I found myself longing for someone to start storming around swearing at everybody just to liven things up a little. The subject matter may be intriguing, but faced with ice as this year's most fashionable food all I could think of was Woody Allen as a Russian peasant in <em>Love and Death</em> telling Diane Keaton that his plate of snow was \"a little undercooked\" and looking forward to a dessert bowl of \"Sleet! My favourite!\"</p>",
  "<p><strong>Price \u00a327,600 </strong><br><strong>MPG 74.3</strong><br><strong> Top speed 131mph</strong></p> <p>Years ago, having owned a string of scrap-yard survivors, rusted hand-me-downs and persistent MOT offenders, I decided the time had finally come to buy a \"grown-up\" car. One that would cost four figures (just), have a number plate in the current run of the alphabet and which wouldn't bring a tear of disappointment to my father's eye. I headed for my local garage where the salesman looked me up and down before pointing towards the far corner of his yard: \"What you want is flash but not much cash. And no car does that better than a Citro\u00ebn BX\u2026\" He was dead right, both about me and the BX.</p> <p>The now defunct BX was a disarming mixture of luxury (electric windows, hydraulic suspension, tinted sunroof), wrapped in a stylish package and propped up on a&#xa0;mechanically unimpressive foundation.</p> <p>It was a template that worked brilliantly for Citro\u00ebn and millions of drivers (including myself) were delighted, though often frustrated. But hey, it was a proper car.</p> <p>The latest generation of Citro\u00ebns, however, is messing with this blueprint. For the price, they're still gadget-heavy and unexpectedly luxurious\u2026 but their underpinnings are no longer as dubious.</p> <p>The most recent car to buck the trend is the innovative DS5 Hybrid4 \u2013 the world's first mass-produced diesel-electric hybrid car. It will do a wallet-tranquillising 74mpg and its CO<sub>2</sub> emissions dip below the magic 100g per km mark, which means it avoids both road tax and London's congestion charge. These figures are all the more impressive when you consider that the DS5 is both large and posh. It's a five-seat premium motor, not some green-conscious bandwagon with hemp seats and a whiff of eco-smugness.</p> <p>From the outside it's a bit of a&#xa0;shape-shifter: part saloon, part estate, part MPV, the DS5 is unlike any other car you'll see in your local multi-storey. Two long swishes of chrome whip up from its front corners to a&#xa0;steeply angled dark windscreen, like a pair of metal ice-hockey sticks. There's plenty more chrome along the sills and snaking around the front valance, bracketing the headlamps like the silver glints on the arms of designer sunglasses. The bonnet is as heavily creased as a linen napkin and the flanks are sculpted and shapely.</p> <p>The interior is a banquet of high-grade rubber, leather and soft-touch plastics. Controls sweep around the driver, spilling down the central console and studding the ceiling. The digital dash scrolls information past you with dizzying graphics. It all feels a bit <em>Top Gun</em> at times.</p> <p>But what really sets the DS5 apart is its groundbreaking power unit. A&#xa0;161bhp, two-litre turbo diesel drives the front wheels and a 36bhp electric motor the rear. The result is a&#xa0;four-wheel-drive set-up with 200bhp. You can switch the system around and choose sport, 4x4 or all-electric drive, or you can do what most of us will \u2013 select auto and let the smart car decide.</p> <p>Pioneering though the car may be, there are still a few touches to remind you of the Citro\u00ebns of old. The gearbox feels jerky and uncertain at times, the weight of the car means it takes a heavy foot to get you going, and the satnav is maddeningly inept. The lack of a central cubby also means every time you turn a corner the keyless fob slides off the polished surface. But there's more than enough flash to blind you to any faults.</p>",
  "<p>A few episodes into the new series of <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/later/\" title=\"\"><em>Later\u2026 with Jools Holland</em></a>, which starts on BBC2 next week, the music programme will celebrate its 20th year of broadcast. A slighter anniversary will have passed unnoticed \u2013 the casual inquiry that started it all, one producer to another at Television Centre: \"What's Jools up to at the minute?\"</p> <p>Holland was then a touring musician and band leader who'd done presenting work for Channel 4 in the 80s, and later a stint on American television. The BBC producers hoped he might front a new show they were planning. Something modest, late night, to go in among the weather bulletins and party political broadcasts on a Friday. Nothing special.</p> <p>They were Michael Jackson, then in charge of <em>The Late Show</em> on BBC2, and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/may/26/mark-cooper-television-bbc\" title=\"\">Mark Cooper,</a> who arranged the cultural programme's occasional music acts. Cooper had an eclectic booking policy \u2013 \"Ice T one day, the Kronos Quartet the next\" \u2013 but was keen to showcase more musicians than <em>The Late Show</em> had room for. Jackson, meanwhile, wanted to make use of the studio space that went to waste after they went off air. They agreed to make a weekly spin-off, called <em>Later</em>, with four or five bands each performing two or three songs over an hour.</p> <p>Cramming musicians into their little studio, Cooper hoped, would create frisson. Because by now the idea for the show had evolved from the unromantic (\"Here's an empty studio\") to the practical (\"How can we get the most amount of different music on?\") to the deliriously ambitious (\"We hoped for something like a Greek tragedy\u2026 The kind of show where you couldn't lie!\").</p> <p>They wanted Holland to host, linking performances with puns and chat, occasionally playing jazzy piano with his guests. He'd done something similar on <em>Sunday Night</em>, a show for US broadcaster NBC, and before that had worked on music programme <em>The Tube</em>. To him, <em>Later</em> sounded like \"the bastard love-child of all the shows I'd done in the past\". He signed up.</p> <p>And so on Friday 9 October 1992, about 100,000 midnight viewers met Holland in his studio. Then in his mid 30s, skinny and hardly filling a wide-shouldered suit, the presenter was <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KrEVNX2RgA&amp;feature=player_detailpage#t=32s\" title=\"\">sat low on a piano stool</a> \u2013 placed, for no obvious reason, in front of a hat stand and a fire exit sign. He sounded less than certain as introductions were made: \"Welcome, ladies and gentlemen, to the first show of these shows\u2026\"</p> <p>The Neville Brothers and <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTl16UOfXCg&amp;feature=player_detailpage#t=6s\" title=\"\">the Christians performed</a>; Holland got the lead singer of Nu Colour's name wrong, and <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BkSmE25kOY0&amp;feature=player_detailpage#t=69s\" title=\"\">asked a member of D'Influence</a> if the growth in the popularity of British soul music was \"a sort of reaction to some of the more hardcore... things?\" The show featured artificial smoke, electric-blue lighting and a lot of cameras rolling just-too-late out of shot. It's unlikely any of those watching at home realised they were witnessing the start of something lasting. And \"inconceivable\", says Holland now, \"that we'd be doing it 20 years later.\"</p> <p>Gradually things got going. Paul Weller did a boisterous <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eANiz4gZU7k\" title=\"\">rendition of Sunflower</a> in 1993. Blur and Oasis appeared in 1995, as well as D'Angelo, David Bowie, Pulp with a full orchestra. <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBxYfLqKyew\" title=\"\">Elliott Smith was awkward and heartbreaking</a> in 1999 \u2013 a year that Mel C was the <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ubcxrm0svhE\" title=\"\">first and last Spice Girl</a> to be on. In 2000 a debuting Chris Martin muffed the <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZazBiZUrBU\" title=\"\">introduction to Yellow</a> because, he said, Gary Brooker was in the room and he couldn't stop thinking about this being one of the guys that wrote A Whiter Shade of Pale. In 2001 the Manics led a <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-48SFXmbro\" title=\"\">studio-wide rendition of an AC/DC riff</a> and Nick Cave joined in, so too Shaggy. Mary J Blige was <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pzx5M_K9UZ8&amp;feature=fvst\" title=\"\">superb and exhausting</a> in 2002; <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cig2Ep-4udg\" title=\"\">Devendra Banhart played cross-legged</a> in 2004; Klaxons were <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gk1ZoR7Jq-E\" title=\"\">out of tune</a> in 2006. Two years ago Chicago's Mavis Staples chatted up Bengaluru's <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvL_Yk1Q9Z0\" title=\"\">Raghu Dixit</a> (<a href=\"http://raghudixit.com/later-with-jools-holland/\" title=\"\">\"Boy you can really sing!\"</a>), and last spring Plan B <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJs_UhaWAJw\" title=\"\">sang lyrics</a> he'd written minutes before, scribbling in his dressing room. Paul Weller <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZIrx41r6e8\" title=\"\">appeared for the 11th time</a>.</p> <p><em>Later</em> might once have been reduced, by Robbie Williams, to the status of \"<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83R2Z57Obtk\" title=\"\"><em>Top of the Pops </em>with pubes</a>\", but a certain type of musician rings this booking in red, anticipating a trip to dingy studio seven in west London the way they might Shepherd's Bush Empire or the Pyramid stage. \"It's the Holy Grail,\" says 25-year-old Ben Howard, who <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqSfJVqmG2w\" title=\"\">this year performed</a> tracks from his debut album. \"There's nothing like it,\" says 68-year-old Randy Newman, who <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNut8cni8V0\" title=\"\">last year performed</a> tracks from album number 16.</p> <p>\"It reveals the nuts and bolts of bands,\" says Bj\u00f6rk. \"You can't help but get a little puffed up, a little competitive,\" says KD Lang. \"I'm not sure if it comes across on television,\" says Tracy Chapman, \"but sometimes you can reach out and touch the band standing next to you.\"</p> <p>Heath Fogg, guitarist from Alabama Shakes, says: \"It was the most nervous I've ever been for a show.\" Guy Garvey, Elbow frontman, says: \"There's a gentlemanly feeling of, we've got to do our stuff here.\"</p> <p>\"When it's over it's over,\" says Jools Holland. \"There are no retakes and you can go and have your tea.\"</p> <p><strong>Back in 1992, when <em>Later</em> began, </strong><em>Top of the Pops</em> was in good health and confident enough of its viewership to give a guest-hosting spot to Ricky from <em>EastEnders</em>. <em>The Word</em>, a Channel 4 magazine show that hosted live bands, was thriving. Indeed there was such an appetite for music television that Pete Waterman managed four years hosting <em>The Hit Man and Her</em>, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fP4HTa89EEw\" title=\"\">a dance show set in a disco</a>. None of the above survive (and <em>The Late Show</em>, by the way, was binned in 1995).</p> <p>Why has <em>Later</em> lasted? Holland, now 54, takes an idealistic view. \"It has remained a servant to the song,\" he says. Mark Cooper, now 59 and <em>Later</em>'s executive producer since the start, is more pragmatic. It's important, he thinks, that the programme<em> </em>endeared itself to artists by being tech-minded and fastidious. \"Bands are obsessed with how they sound,\" he says, and so on <em>Later</em> they get to do extensive sound-checks, with technicians sensitive to quibbles. Artists get flattered as artists \u2013 a rare thing, several tell me, in the world of TV. Usually, KD Lang says, the musician is \"shoved on at the end of a show, a second-class citizen\". Bj\u00f6rk recalls being booked on other programmes between \"chat, comedy, bingo\u2026 <em>Jools</em> is the only show I know of that lets you play totally live, lets you soundcheck and rehearse and then has a full hour just on music.\"</p> <p>Over 20 years, Cooper says, bonds have been forged with established acts. \"Foo Fighters have done <em>Jools</em> since [1997 single] <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrfWF-_f-IM\" title=\"\">Monkey Wrench</a>, Coldplay since Yellow. There's a homecoming aspect for them, and we benefit.\"</p> <p>Many younger artists have grown up watching, wanting a patch of that congested studio for themselves. \"I saw KT Tunstall on <em>Later</em> when I was 11 or 12 \u2013 hooked ever since,\" says singer Lianne La Havas, who <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swN1sRpXjhY\" title=\"\">debuted last year</a>. Ben Howard recalls watching from a sofa in Devon as <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8gszYhoLgg\" title=\"\">Bon Iver sang Skinny Love</a> in 2008, \"one of the most amazing live acoustic performances I've ever seen\". A way away, in Athens, Alabama, \"I used to get in from work and watch re-runs of <em>Jools</em> on a US cable channel,\" says Alabama Shakes's Fogg. \"It was part of my routine while I ate dinner.\"</p> <p>Alabama Shakes were invited earlier&#xa0; this year <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTQXCuyRS40\" title=\"\">to appear</a> on an episode <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zCyCluXHjFw\" title=\"\">also featuring Jack White</a>. \"Playing in front of a hero like that is one of the most nerve-wracking and rewarding things I've ever done,\" says Fogg. \"You're in a circle. Jack White's watching. There's no other venue like it.\"</p> <p>Cooper calls this <em>Later</em>'s \"Colosseum effect\". \"Artists try to trump each other,\" he says. \"There are elements of the show that are gladiatorial.\"</p> <p>Cooper and his <em>Later</em> colleague for the last 11 years, series producer Alison Howe, like to have fun with the tensions their format creates. \"Poor Stornoway,\" says Howe. \"Poor Stornoway, from Oxford, who I don't think were even signed when they came in.\" She refers to a show in 2009, when <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Qk_fAi5PuY\" title=\"\">Jay-Z had been booked</a>, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnkkjMx8d-E\" title=\"\">also Norah Jones</a>, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNBqvInSNEU\" title=\"\">also Dave Grohl</a>, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bl1UrIVSWJI\" title=\"\">also Sting</a>. Somewhere in the middle of that <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B8OAj9F7hI\" title=\"\">the unsigned four-piece Stornoway made their TV bow</a>.</p> <p>\"Because we had so much wealth!\" says Cooper. \"You just thought somebody should benefit from it,\" says Howe, \"even though the experience must have been terrifying.\" On that note, she says, she still feels bad for <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZtdXl3QZD_A\" title=\"\">Fleet Foxes</a>, made to debut after <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PF0XdCSRXjY\" title=\"\">Al Green singing Let's Stay Together</a> in 2008.</p> <p>\"But that's how it works, right?\" says Norah Jones. \"When I was <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dU6rEpRisfU\" title=\"\">first on the show</a> [in 2002] everyone else was well known and I wasn't. I remember having tunnel vision, telling myself: 'Just look at your piano, <em>don't</em> look at Wilco.'\" Jones, at the time, was a newcomer whom Cooper had seen perform in a Pizza Express in central London. \"The idea that she'd win Grammies, sell millions of records \u2013 that was never the point for us,\" says Cooper. \"While we love the taste-making aspect [of the job], we don't book somebody thinking they're going to become successful.\"</p> <p>Howe points out the many times <em>Later</em> has missed the boat with artists, booking them when they're already well established; recently <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56krdP5W3CQ\" title=\"\">Mumford and Sons</a>, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cExQBFCnuMg\" title=\"\">Tinie Tempah</a>, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGo5XTmLG7U\" title=\"\">Two Door Cinema Club</a>. \"And of course there are quite a few emerging acts we've put on that don't go on to become successful,\" he says. He was big on a group called <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9TuKtxZKI8\" title=\"\">Pelvis in 1998</a>... \"It's a bit like being an A&amp;R,\" says Cooper. \"People remember the&#xa0;successes.\"</p> <p>One was KT Tunstall, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7XIQ_6J2do\" title=\"\">invited on in 2004</a> with a few hours' notice because the New York rapper Nas hadn't got on a plane; Tunstall went platinum with her debut album that year, and has credited <em>Later</em> ever since for the push. In 2007 Cooper and Howe found themselves with a spot to fill between two heavyweights, Bj\u00f6rk and Paul McCartney. Bj\u00f6rk recalls a shy girl, \"performing in front of me, almost <em>a&#xa0;cappella</em>.\" Howe: \"This 18-year-old south Londoner, terrified at the time, but you felt she wouldn't falter.\" Cooper: \"<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zf6dQxQURXE\" title=\"\">Watch the clip</a>. Adele is shitting herself.\"</p> <p>Adele, then still to release an album, perched on a stool and sang Daydreamer. She told me last year: \"It was my first TV appearance, and <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WHKeFLy1Bo\" title=\"\">Bj\u00f6rk did The Anchor Song</a> just before me, my favourite song of hers. It winded me.\" But Adele got through it (and returned, six months later, to perform on <em>Later</em>'s regular New Year's Eve edition, <em>Hootenanny</em>). She's had an all right few years since.</p> <p>\"People have to rise to the occasion,\" says Cooper. \"Good musicians do, generally, and the drama of them getting through is a big appeal of the show.\"</p> <p><strong>But not everybody gets it. </strong>Broadcast for 20 years and you'll become shorthand for something \u2013 something, in all likelihood, unflattering. Cooper complains that newspapers \u2013 including this one \u2013 use <em>Later</em> as a byword for predictable, safe music. \"We know the cliches,\" he says. \"I hope we're not predictable, I hope we're challenging\u2026 But we're not a cool show. We're not selling a lifestyle, what it is to be young \u2013 how could we be? Given who we are, given how long we've been on?\"</p> <p>Blogs on influential music site the Quietus have decried <em>Later</em>'s \"Sunday-supplement pop\", and likened band-approval on the show to <a href=\"http://thequietus.com/articles/02007-cats-on-fire-our-temperance-movement-album-review\" title=\"\">acceptance by the Masons</a>. \"The format is so well-worn it's self-parodic,\" <a href=\"http://www.nme.com/blog/index.php?blog=1&amp;title=later_with_jools_holland_time_for_a_refr&amp;more=1&amp;c=1&amp;tb=1&amp;pb=1\" title=\"\">complained <em>NME</em></a> this year. And a few outspoken musicians have taken against <em>Later. </em>Folk singer Robb Johnson called it \"<a href=\"http://thequietus.com/articles/05773-where-are-all-the-protest-singers-billy-bragg-nina-simone-dorian-lynskey-33-revolutions-per-minute-a-history-of-protest-songs-review\" title=\"\">a cosy televised version of <em>Mojo</em> magazine</a>\". Mark E Smith of the Fall <a href=\"http://www.thestoolpigeon.co.uk/features/interview-mark-e-smith-fall-boogie-woogie-jools-holland.html\" title=\"\">once said</a> he only agreed to appear if he <em>didn't</em> have to duet with Jools Holland. He claimed to have demanded: \"No boogie-woogie piano, Mister Holland.\"</p> <p>Smith was being mean (and a lot of musicians told me they agreed to their repeat visits to the show, in part, because of personal affection for Holland). Yet the host's jazzy piano work is one of a few longstanding, distinctly un-rocky features of <em>Later</em>. Over its 20-year run a smooth and very grown-up production routine has been established by core staff who've been running things from the beginning. (Current director Janet Fraser-Cook and sound supervisor Mike Felton were in their jobs at launch; Michael Jackson went on to become a BBC controller.) Recordings are relaxed and efficient \u2013 Ben Howard says: \"I thought TV was your classic load of nutters running around and shouting but <em>Jools</em> was the most chilled-out place\" \u2013 which doesn't leave much room for the chaos that can make telly memorable.</p> <p>\"There's a strain of thinking that music on TV is only really good when it fucks up,\" says Cooper. \"L7 throwing tampons on <em>The Word</em>. The Stone Roses [shouting \"Amateurs!\" after a <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDRz3H30NmY&amp;feature=player_detailpage#t=54s\" title=\"\">studio power-cut</a>] on <em>The Late Show</em>. We don't deliver&#xa0;that.\"</p> <p>The timetable for visiting bands is rigid. Artists commit for two days \u2013 individual sound checks on a Monday, rehearsals with all bands present on a Tuesday. Backstage there are paltry BBC treats: Fogg recalls being given a Lynyrd Skynyrd DVD to watch; Lianne La Havas got cheese, ham, and the sound of Holland's piano playing coming through the vents from his dressing room. In the studio an audience is brought in, followed by the bands, who record an hour-long show to be broadcast on a Friday. After that (since the addition in 2008 of a live show to the weekly <em>Later</em> package) there's an extra 30-minute broadcast that goes out live on a Tuesday.</p> <p><em>Later</em> asks a lot of its guests' time, and it makes the famous sit still and be patient while others are spotlit. \"A real ego-leveller,\" says Randy Newman, and something that doesn't always make sense to debutants. \"Jay-Z was really bewildered,\" says Cooper. \"He wanted to know: 'Why can't I do my songs in a row?' But he's a music lover, and [the format] was so obvious to him when he stepped on to the studio floor.\"</p> <p>There were difficulties in 2009 with Smokey Robinson. \"For some reason \u2013 I don't think he was feeling well \u2013 Smokey didn't turn up,\" says Holland. \"Smokey's probably been bored stupid in TV studios since the 1960s,\" says Cooper. Anyway, the R&amp;B legend was late \u2013 and rehearsals had to start without him, even though a special guest had been booked for a duet. \"Eric Clapton was getting pissed off,\" remembers Cooper. \"He'd eaten the cheese sandwich he'd brought with him. He was saying, 'Jools, I'm going to get my coat.'\" After a queasy wait, Robinson arrived in a cab and Cooper \"pushed him through the curtain, literally as Jools walked across the floor to introduce him\". Unruffled, Robinson <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iX1PeMHUcCw\" title=\"\">sang a track</a> made famous by Norah Jones. Its chorus line: \"Don't know why/I didn't come\".</p> <p>\"That's our version of chaos,\" says Cooper. Janelle Mon\u00e1e once lost her voice mid-show; At The Drive-In <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ar2Y_gjA4g&amp;feature=player_detailpage#t=232s\" title=\"\">pinched stage furniture from Robbie Williams</a>; the Libertines <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p_yde5BJrww\" title=\"\">smoked an on-set cigarette</a>. It's not quite tampon-throwing, not quite Ian Brown having a hissy fit... <em>Later </em>has never been much good at forever-in-legend extravagance. Instead: \"We once had McCoy Tyner getting so into his jazz tune that he decided to do <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZCBW-Ukhs8\" title=\"\">an 18-minute version</a>,\" says Cooper. Holland tried to halt the music after five. The audience intervened with applause after six. Elbow were due next to perform, \"and Guy Garvey kept looking at his watch,\" something that in the genteel world of <em>Later</em> must rank equivalent to dashing a beer bottle on the nearest hard surface. \"But it's our version of conflict,\" says Cooper, and he's comfortable with that. So too, I think, are most of <em>Later</em>'s&#xa0;audience.</p> <p>This is not a show about things going wrong, it's about things going very, very right. It's about artists \u2013 spurred on by weirdly intimate peer scrutiny, by close production and painstaking sound-management \u2013 putting on a four-minute rendition of a song that's as close to perfect as possible. <em>Later</em> isn't always dynamic; it has its cosy moments. But there's something properly commendable about the quality level it forces, the number of cut-out-and-keep moments created as a result. YouTube videos of Bon Iver doing Skinny Love have garnered more than 2m clicks. <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckbdLVX736U\" title=\"\">John Cale sang Hallelujah</a> in front of 100,000 viewers in series one, a single clip that's been watched 4.4m times since.</p> <p>Artists like Ben Howard have come to see an appearance on <em>Later</em> as a deposit in the cultural time-capsule. \"Most artists are terrified of what they'll be remembered for,\" he says. \"<em>Later</em> is not necessarily a pivotal performance in your career but it's a defining performance. You're conscious it's something permanent, something that people will look back to.\"</p> <p>\"It's an opportunity for artists to leave a record,\" agrees Cooper.</p> <p>\"Our time on <em>Jools </em>is something I'd be proud to show my grandkids,\" says Fogg.</p> <p>\"Long,\" says Garvey, \"may <em>Later</em> reign.\"</p>",
  "<p>At the final wrap of this month's <em>Savages,</em> star Blake Lively distributed \"I SURVIVED OLIVER STONE\" T-shirts. But her experiences likely didn't match what Stone had been putting actors, crews, and himself, through prior to me interviewing him in September 1986. He'd jumped from directing <em>Salvador</em> in Mexico \u2013 where \"half the crew were down with amoebic dysentery and the other half were starving\" \u2013 to <em>Platoon</em> in the Philippines, where he'd allowed actors \"no more than two hours sleep, in their fox-hole, and only two basic rations, each day, however gruelling\".</p> <p>Stone told me sweatily he'd sidestepped \"the Hollywood meat-grinder\" with gonzo spirit, agit-prop, dodgy finances, ad-hoc catering and \"the dark humour of a&#xa0;severed ear served in a champagne glass\".</p> <p>He'd written <em>Salvador</em> with and about loose cannon journalist Richard Boyle, who had covered death squads, rapes and the civil war in El Salvador. Boyle lived with Stone, his wife and baby son during its writing, and \"one night, totally drunk, Boyle ate all the baby milk formula in our fridge\".</p> <p>After ordering chilli from room service, Stone ate it the way I'd expect equally of a tired yet hyper director or a \"grunt\" infantryman. Back in 1967, \"thinking it the gung-ho thing to do\", he'd joined the US infantry and once took part in an ambush of Viet Cong eating in the jungle. As the bullets flew, so did fish, rice and chopsticks. In <em>Platoon</em>, he had \"exorcised\", or at least replayed, such personal demons.</p> <p>With food caught between his gap front teeth, Stone told me that his father was a&#xa0;machete dealer and predicted \"a kid's movie will be my next move\".</p>",
  "<p>I fully understand that making life choices can be tricky: what career to pursue, so you don't end up trying to saw off your own leg with frustration; which person to jump into bed with, so you don't find yourself sharing dampened sheets with somebody who tells you they think Hermann Goering was misunderstood and had some pretty cool ideas, actually.</p> <p>Choosing what to eat off a restaurant menu is never tricky. It's not complicated. It's not like filing a&#xa0;tax return or getting North Korea to see sense or navigating the Kingston bypass. It's simple. There's a list of dishes. You read the list and choose the&#xa0;one that sounds nicest or, at a push, least nasty.</p> <p>I spend an absurd amount of my working life in restaurants, choosing things off lists, and cannot help but marvel at the people who, asked what they would like to eat, flap their hands about like they're shooing away flies and mutter, \"Ooh, come back to me last\". Why? What the hell are you waiting for? Divine intervention? A&#xa0;scorching column of light to descend from the heavens to illuminate the place on the sheet where it says \"rump of lamb with aubergine puree\",&#xa0;the bloody dish that we all bloody knew you were going to bloody order anyway?</p> <p>There is a simple truth. People who take ages trying to choose what to eat in restaurants don't like food. Not enough, anyway. They can't choose because they are suspicious of what the kitchen might be attempting to do to them. For them every dish is an elephant trap, specifically designed to make them look like the picky eater we all know they are. And don't try suggesting it's because menus are full of too many lovely things to make a simple choice impossible. I read more menus than you do. I have measured out my life in badly punctuated starters and grammatically incorrect mains. I&#xa0;can therefore tell you that the number packed full of glorious possibilities can be counted on the fingers of my left hand. After I've put fingers one to four through a threshing machine. And that last one turned out to be a big whopping lie.</p> <p>If you have a proper appetite, menu choices are simple. You go out wanting the fish or the steak. That's the kind of person you are tonight. You may think yourself deeply discerning, but really, you have made this decision before you arrive, even if you don't know it. You turn up, look down the list, find the thing that most closely approximates how you're feeling. You choose it. If I&#xa0;were allowed to order like that we all know what would happen. I'd order the pork belly and pull my \"so shoot me\" face when everyone rolls their eyes.</p> <p>As it happens I'm not allowed to do that. I have to find the thing that reads most like a car crash, full of mangled body parts: the deconstructed prawn cocktail with Marie Rose ice cream and iceberg lettuce jelly; the sweetbreads with the Amaretto veloute; the witty dessert made with beetroot. And if there aren't any of those, I have to find the thing that looks complicated. And if there is neither of those I get to choose the thing that sounds nice which isn't pork belly.</p> <p>I can do all that in about 90 seconds, leaving the rest of the time free to force people to laugh at my crap jokes. That's just how people who really like their food work.</p>",
  "<p>One unwelcome consequence of life in a coalition, almost certainly overlooked by David Cameron and Nick Clegg when they announced their political marriage in May 2010, was that under this system there can be two leadership crises in the same government at the same time.</p> <p>Two and a half years on, neither man can ignore this awkward reality any longer. In coalitions made up of two parties, things happen in twos. When times are good both leaders benefit, but when they are bad there is double the trouble.</p> <p>After a summer in which politics was largely forgotten in a bubble of Olympic ecstasy, it is back with a vengeance and in a form more visceral and irrational than ever. Cameron and Clegg are suddenly, from almost nowhere, in the firing line; their ability to remain as leaders of their own parties and the country in question.</p> <p>MPs and activists in both governing parties are restless and some are thinking dark thoughts. Last week in the House of Commons a young Conservative backbencher, who until now would have been listed in the \"thoroughly loyal\" column on the Tory whips' office blackboard, was asked about talk of Boris Johnson being installed again as an MP so that, at the right moment, he could mount a coup and replace Cameron as leader and prime minister. \"There are lots of MPs who would fall on their swords to allow Boris in,\" said the MP. \"Things are that bad. Lots of people don't know whether they want to be here any more. People are very fed up.\" Another member of the 2010 intake \u2013 now packed with individuals who, following the reshuffle, fear they will never enter government \u2013 said merely: \"For me, it is anyone but Cameron.\"</p> <p>It is true that for every Tory MP who plays up the threat to the prime minister's leadership from Johnson or A&#xa0;N&#xa0;Other Tory there are several who will dismiss the idea out of hand. \"It is for the birds,\" said one normally vociferous critic of the prime minister. \"Look how well he did on the Hillsborough announcement. I had people coming up to me from the Labour side saying how brilliant he was, and it is true. He was. It is all bonkers.\" In Clegg's case, his MPs are more solidly supportive, though they are not uniformly so. In many respects the discipline of the Liberal Democrats is remarkable, given their position in the polls and the Tory blows they have taken over electoral reform, House of Lords reform, and now the apparent systematic throwing overboard of green policies by No 10 and the Treasury. But there are some notable Lib Dems \u2013 and not just Lord Oakeshott \u2013 who believe Clegg is now so toxic that the party will be wiped out unless it installs Vince Cable in his place well before the next election.</p> <p>Before what is bound to be a gossip-fuelled party conference season in which Lib Dem flirtation with Labour (and vice versa) will be added to the mix of plotting, irresistible visions of the future home into view. Could dishevelled Boris, with his wild and abundant blond hair, and bald Vince come together in the Rose Garden to renew the coalition? What exciting deals could be struck? Would Cable \u2013 an opponent of Heathrow expansion \u2013 back a Boris Island airport in the Thames estuary in return, perhaps, for Johnson supporting a new push on the environment, maybe with Boris bikes extended nationwide? Or, after the next election, will it be Vince and Ed (Miliband) in the \"progressive coalition\" so longed for by many on the centre left?</p> <p>As yet, the Tory insurgency against Cameron is small and incoherent. Around a dozen MPs are believed to have signed a letter to Graham Brady, chairman of the 1922 Committee of backbenchers, calling for a leadership contest, although he refused to tell anyone what the number was at a meeting of the executive last week.</p> <p>Another 15 to 20 are believed to be considering doing so, but, in the words of one colleague, \"will almost certainly be too cowardly when it comes to it\". Brady must have 46 letters before a leadership contest is triggered. The word is that the dozen signatories are from all wings of the parliamentary party, reflecting a spectrum of discontent. The right wants Cameron to give a referendum on Europe and commit to the seizing back of more powers from Brussels. It is unhappy with the pro-EU Lib Dems and wants taxes cut and spending slashed even more. The left, on the other hand, is fed up that much of Cameron's \"modernisation\" agenda (including green policies) has been abandoned and at the self-inflicted damage of unpopular health service reforms.</p> <p>Many Tory MPs say that following months of U-turns they do not know what to tell their constituents to believe in any more. They complain that the party has no direction. But even among the most critical there is, to date, no sign of a united view emerging about who might take on Cameron. The mini-revolt is more an expression of broad unhappiness than a well-formed plot with a clear plan of action behind it. Some like the idea of Johnson as leader because he would cheer up the party and be, initially at least, massively more popular in the country. Others from the right would like to see former defence secretary Liam Fox or David Davis taking over. There is also an idea being put around that a unity candidate might run and Brady's name is being mentioned. Such ideas provoke wildly mixed reactions. \"I like old Graham,\" said one senior Tory. \"But that is mad. He's a real plodder.\" The lack of coherence is, however, no reason for Cameron to rest easy. The leadership issue will not go away. As we report, Johnson, fresh from outshining Cameron at the post-Olympics rally, is planning a series of appearances both at the Tory party conference in Birmingham next month and afterwards during which he will focus on his successes in 2012 \u2013 securing re-election as London mayor in May and fronting the Olympics. The theme will be how Tories (under Johnson) can win against Labour when there is not much money around and how they can organise things (under Johnson) better than anyone else in the world. While the mayor will cast it all in a loyal frame, he \u2013 not Cameron \u2013 will be the darling of the conference.</p> <p>Downing Street is edgy, to say the least, and its dismissive line that \"serious times require serious people\" is not likely to help. Johnson is bound to milk his conference appearance to the maximum. He will arrive on the Monday and attend a rally and a fringe, amid huge media attention. In the evening he is due to speak at an event staged by the ConservativeHome website, which is edited by Tim Montgomerie, a regular critic of Cameron. The event is entitled \"Boris Johnson's 2012. Re-elected and Olympotastic\". Then on Tuesday he will speak to conference once more on the themes of how to win in austerity and how to get re-elected against Labour. Provocative?</p> <p>The mayor's biographer Andrew Gimson, author of <em>Boris \u2013 the Rise of Boris Johnson</em>, believes it is. It would, he says, be \"quite out of character\" for Johnson to miss this chance to upstage Cameron. \"These occasions are perfect for such an operation: you have hundreds of journalists with nothing much to write about except for dreary speeches by careerists who reckon the way to get to the top is to stay on message. Boris reckons the way to get to the top is to go off message.\" The pattern of Johnson causing trouble was set at Cameron's first conference as Tory leader, in Bournemouth in 2006. Cameron praised the TV chef Jamie Oliver. Johnson then told a fringe meeting: \"If I were in charge, I would get rid of Jamie Oliver and tell people to eat what they like.\" Again in 2009, he infuriated the leadership by playing to the Eurosceptic gallery with calls for a referendum, just as Cameron was trying to sweep the issue under the carpet in the runup to the general election. Finally, on 7&#xa0;November, Johnson will address the 1922 Committee, where another thunderous reception can be expected, at the invitation of Brady.</p> <p>Johnson's autumn addresses will unsettle Cameron, who is already worried that others around him, including education secretary Michael Gove, are manoeuvring. A cabinet minister said last week that the word was that the PM deliberately sacked two of Gove's ministers in the reshuffle without his say so because Gove had leaked several policy stories without telling No 10 first. It was a message about who was running the show.</p> <p>With both party leaders vulnerable, the party conference season presents them with tactical challenges and dilemmas. Some in the Tory party think the threat from Johnson will make Cameron move further to the right and persuade him to take harder lines on Europe, on immigration and on crime, while backing deeper spending cuts to get the deficit-cutting strategy back on track. The reason would be to buy some time with the parliamentary party, where the right is larger and more vociferous than the left. But that approach will have other knock-on effects that will not help the prime minister and the coalition.</p> <p>Most of all it will make it even more difficult for Clegg to persuade his party that it can deliver on Lib Dem values and policies in a coalition with Cameron's rightward-drifting Tories. At the Lib Dem conference in Brighton, which begins on Saturday, Clegg will have to stand firm against Cameron on Europe, on the environment, on civil liberties, on preventing further cuts in welfare, because if he doesn't his party could well ask whether it is all worth it, and turn against him.</p> <p>And where will it turn? Increasingly, perhaps, towards Cable, who is beginning to talk more and more with Labour about future co-operation. Those text exchanges with Ed Balls will become more regular. The real problem for Cameron and Clegg is that, in seeking to keep their own parties united behind them in the face of leadership threats, they may have to take them in opposite directions. The bigger question then becomes whether the coalition can survive the strain.</p>",
  "<p>More people would support a political party that pledged to stop all immigration or promised to reduce the number of Muslims than one that encouraged multiculturalism, a survey conducted in the wake of the Olympics reveals.</p> <p>Despite London 2012 being heralded as a celebration of a diverse society, the research suggests much of the electorate remains open to views traditionally associated with far-right groups.</p> <p>The survey, conducted by YouGov with 1,750 respondents, found that 41% of people would be more likely to vote for a party that promised to stop all immigration, compared with 28% who said they would be less likely to support a group that promoted such policies.</p> <p>In addition, 37% admitted that they would be more likely to support a political party that promised to reduce the number of Muslims in Britain and the presence of Islam in society, compared with 23% who said it would make them less likely.</p> <p>Matthew Goodwin of the Extremis Project, an independent group monitoring extremism and terrorism that commissioned the research, said that, although Britain lacked a successful extremist political party, much of the public was susceptible to far-right ideology.</p> <p>He said: \"The results clearly point towards enduring public anxieties over the performance of mainstream political and business elites, immigration and also the role of Muslims and Islam in society.\"</p> <p>In Europe, far-right parties have gained an increasing foothold, with Marine le Pen's National Front recently polling 6.5 million votes and a poll in Greece indicating that support for the neo-Nazi Golden Dawn has grown to 10.5%, up from 7% at the last election. However, the fiercely anti-Islamic Freedom party of Geert Wilders won only 15 seats in last week's Dutch elections, compared with its previous 24 seats.</p> <p>The UK poll results suggest, however, that Britain may struggle to host far-right groups capable of such popularity, revealing a striking generational divide in attitudes towards multiculturalism. It found that large majorities of 18-to -24-year-olds rejected radical rightwing policies, with 60% saying that a party campaigning to halt all immigration would make them less likely to support it or that it did not matter to them.</p> <p>Less than a quarter of 18-to-24-year-olds said they would be more likely to vote for a party that promised to halt all immigration, compared with more than half of those aged above 60. Similarly, 27% of the younger age group said they would vote for a party that campaigned to reduce the number of Muslims, compared with 49% of those aged over 60.</p> <p>Goodwin, a lecturer at Nottingham University, said: \"While we see further evidence of an emerging generation that is more tolerant towards \u2013 and accepting of \u2013 immigration and diversity, there remains clear potential for a party that \u2026 promises to halt immigration, reduce the number of Muslims and prioritise traditional British values over other cultures.\"</p>",
  "<p><em>SPOILER ALERT: This weekly blog is for those who have been watching the new series of Doctor Who. Don\u2019t read ahead if you haven\u2019t seen episode three \u2013 A Town Called Mercy</em></p> \n<p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2012/sep/08/doctor-who-dinosaurs-on-spaceship\" title=\"\">Dan Martin\u2019s episode two blog</a></p> \n<h2>\u201cAnachronistic electricity, Keep Out signs, aggressive stares \u2013 has someone been peeking at my Christmas list?\u201d</h2> \n<p>Another week, another \u201cblockbusting movie poster\u201d that actually delivered on its premise, as Doctor Who did the western. And A Town Called Mercy was a proper western. One glimpse of a cyborg in this environment immediately brought to mind <a href=\"http://uk.imdb.com/title/tt0070909/\" title=\"\">Michael Crichton\u2019s 1973 movie Westworld</a>. But while that was set in a theme park in the future, this was the real deal. With no eventual reveal that the whole thing was a spaceship, or the result of any perception filters, this was the full-blooded tale of a real town under real siege from a lone gunman \u2013 and it came complete with its own noble sheriff, the Doctor on horseback, and, irresistibly, its own High Noon moment.</p> \n<p>Writer Toby Whithouse delivered a complex morality dilemma fizzing with sharp dialogue, Adrian Scarborough\u2019s Kahler-Jex brought some British eccentricity, and director Saul Metzstein did an effective job of recreating the look of classics of the genre. If anything, A Town Called Mercy was more effective as a western than as a Doctor Who episode.</p> \n<h2>\u201cToday I honour the victims first. His, the Master\u2019s, the Daleks\u2019, all the people who died because of my mercy\u201d</h2> \n<p>One of the classic western tropes is the wounded traveller confronting his demons. Here that role fell to Kahler-Jex, reflected off the Gunslinger \u2013 with both sides of that struggle refracted through the Doctor himself. This was also the source of the episode\u2019s emotional wallop, drawing excellent performances (once again) from Matt Smith and Karen Gillan. In fact it was Gillan who emerged as the real star of the episode: pratfalling with the pistol but facing off against the Doctor.</p> \n<p>Seeing the Doctor holding a gun is never going to be a comfortable sight, but Whithouse pushed him to that point deftly \u2013 certainly with more delicacy than displayed in the previous episode\u2019s clunky business with Solomon, which was presumably designed as the build-up to this week\u2019s events. The end point, however, was worth it \u2013 with it now falling to Amy to be the Doctor\u2019s keeper. Her line: \u201cThis is what happens when you travel on your own for too long,\u201d was genuinely moving. And fans can\u2019t help but worry about what\u2019s going to happen to the Doctor when Amy\u2019s gone. Because given that she\u2019s a blown-up Dalek, Jenna-Louise Coleman\u2019s Oswin isn\u2019t going to be much immediate use.</p> \n<h2>Pond watch</h2> \n<p>The Tardis crew ended up in the Old West because the Doctor misfired in his mission to take them to the Day Of The Dead festival in Mexico. That\u2019s the sort of cultural reference Whithouse is good at, because that is <em>exactly</em> the sort of place a couple like the Ponds would choose to holiday if they had a space-time machine that made money no object. It says a lot about their changing relationship with the Doctor that he has become a travel agent for them.</p> \n<h2>Fear factor</h2> \n<p>Again, being a Whithouse script, this was full of paranoid philosophising of the kind we\u2019re used to from Being Human. Jex was great for this \u2013 I liked the \u201cWe all carry our prisons with us\u201d line in particular. But this was not really one for behind-the-sofa moments. The Gunslinger was cute as much as anything else. In the end, he found a kind of nobility.</p> \n<h2>Mysteries and questions</h2> \n<p>Well done to <strong>@FindOutForYourself</strong> in the comments for picking up the repeat pattern of the malfunctioning light-fitting. I must say I\u2019d made a link between its appearance both here and in Asylum Of The Daleks, but had completely missed the significance in Dinosaurs On a Spaceship. It seems inevitable that it will play into the Ponds\u2019 exit, since their final adventure is with the Weeping Angels. What happens when a light flickers? It goes dark and you can\u2019t see!</p> \n<p>Mind you, while we\u2019re all theorising about the terrible end possibly facing the Ponds <strong>@xandaca</strong> pointed to their \u201cfading interest\u201d in travelling with the Doctor \u2013 something that\u2019s borne out both here and in the Next Week trail.</p> \n<p>And yes, <strong>@PhaseShift</strong>, it was you who made the connection last week that maybe Oswin is <a href=\"http://tardis.wikia.com/wiki/Jagaroth\" title=\"\">a Jagaroth</a>!</p> \n<h2>Time-space debris</h2> \n<p>\u2022 A Town Called Mercy was filmed at the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tabernas_Desert\" title=\"\">Desert Of Tabernas</a> in Almeria, Spain, which also provided the location for A Fistful Of Dollars, and For A Few Dollars More.</p> \n<p>\u2022 \u201cCan everyone who isn\u2019t an American please drop your weapons?\u201d</p> \n<p>\u2022 Doctor Who has been to the Wild West before, in the <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/classic/episodeguide/gunfighters/\" title=\"\">1966 William Hartnell story The Gunfighters</a>. Whithouse did reconsider watching it, but was advised by Moffat and Mark Gatiss not to, because: \u201cIt\u2019s not exactly a jewel in the crown.\u201d</p> \n<p>\u2022 A noble and moving performance from Ben Browder as poor Isaac. Browder of course has sci-fi form as <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRFqXigg_do\" title=\"\">the star of Farscape</a>.</p> \n<p>\u2022 Was anybody else a bit befuddled by the exact nature of the plan? Confuse The Gunslinger by all putting Jex tattoos on, then drive him mad by shorting his blaster with the sonic screwdriver? Surely they would have been stumped if Jex hadn\u2019t done what he did?</p> \n<p>\u2022 \u201cNo, his name\u2019s Susan and he wants you to respect his life choices.\u201d</p> \n<h2>Next week!</h2> \n<p>It\u2019s At Home With The Ponds time with The Power Of Three and \u201cthe year of the slow invasion\u201d.

Two protesters were killed in Khartoum, Sudan and two more in Tunis, Tunisia. Four were<br>killed in the Yemeni capital of Sana'a.</p> <p>Police in Cairo cleared demonstrators from outside the American embassy and Tahrir Square. A 36-year old man died after being hit by a rubber bullet</p> <p>In Sydney around 200 demonstrators clashed with police outside the American consulate.</p> <p>Friday's worst violence was in the Sudanese capital, where protesters targeted the German embassy first, storming through the outer wall and setting fire to buildings and a car near the gates before they were pushed back by police firing teargas. German diplomats fled to the British embassy next door, which became the next target of the mob.</p> <p>William Hague, the foreign secretary, said: \"Sudanese police attended the scene, but demonstrators were able to break down a perimeter wall and cause minor damage to the compound. They did not attempt to gain access to the British embassy building.\" No staff had been harmed, he added. Reports said at least one of the rioters had been killed in clashes with police.</p> <p>The US embassy in Khartoum, which appears to have been the next target, announced that protesters had been expelled from its compound.</p> <p>Protests, mostly aimed at US embassies and galvanised by the emergence of a crude anti-Islam video made in California, were also reported in Iraq, Iran, Bahrain, Afghanistan, Yemen, Egypt, Jerusalem and the West Bank, Kashmir, Malaysia, Indonesia and the Nigerian city of Jos. In Tunis, crowds of rioters throwing stones clashed with police outside the US embassy, who responded with teargas. A fire could be seen within the embassy compound and the American school in Tunis was also reported to be ablaze. Reports said two demonstrators had been killed.</p> <p>The embassy attacks in Sudan marked the first time anti-US protests over the film had mutated into a broader anti-western revolt. In his statement on the events in Khartoum, Hague said: \"The neighbouring German embassy, which appeared to be the focus of the attack, was set on fire and severely damaged. We remained in close contact with the Germans throughout the incident and were able to offer shelter to German diplomats. I am pleased to say that they are also safe.\"</p> <p>The unrest began in Tuesday in Cairo, when protesters stormed the American embassy, and then spread to the eastern Libyan city of Benghazi, where the US consulate was stormed and gutted by an armed mob who killed the ambassador, Chris Stevens, and three other employees.</p> <p>Two US destroyers have been deployed to the Libyan coast and Barack Obama dispatched a unit of marines trained in counterterrorist operations to the country. US drones over Benghazi were targeted by anti-aircraft fire by the extremist groups in the area who are believed to have led Tuesday's storming of the consulate. As a result, the city's airport was temporarily closed. As Washington scrambled to protect its far-flung diplomats, US marines were also reported to have arrived to bolster security at the embassy in the Yemeni capital, Sana'a, which has also been the target of rioters.</p> <p>Libyan authorities have identified 50 people who were involved in the attack on the US consulate in Benghazi in which the ambassador and three other Americans were killed, a security official has Saturday.</p> <p>US ambassador to Libya Christopher Stevens and three others died when gunmen attacked the consulate and a safe house refuge in the eastern city on Tuesday night. The attackers were part of a crowd blaming America for a film they said insulted the Prophet Muhammad. So far four people have been arrested and are being questioned, Libyan officials have said.</p> <p>\"We know of 50 people who were involved in the attack, we have names and we know who they are, but there could be more,\" said Abdel-Monem Al-Hurr, spokesman for Libya's supreme security committee.</p> <p>\"Four have been arrested. Some of the others may have escaped via Benghazi airport, maybe to Egypt, but this not confirmed. We have given their names to all of the Libyan border entry points.\"<br>It was unclear how much the violence was spontaneous and to what extent it had been orchestrated. The film involved was apparently made last year by a Coptic Christian living in Los Angeles, using actors who have said they had no idea they were making an anti-Islam film. The offensive language about the prophet Muhammad was dubbed in later.</p> <p>A 14-minute clip of the film appeared on YouTube in July but only began to generate widespread anger this week, when it was promoted by radical Islamophobic Christians in the US and then broadcast in Egypt by Islamic activists.</p> <p>The US secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, denounced the film as \"disgusting and reprehensible\".</p> <p>US officials have said they believe outrage over the film may have been used by an extremist Libyan group, Ansar al-Sharia, as cover and a diversion for an assault on the Benghazi consulate that had been long planned for the 11th anniversary of the 11 September attacks. The president of the Libyan assembly, Yousef al-Megariaf, agreed. During a visit to Benghazi, he described the storming of the consulate as \"pre-planned to hit at the core of the relationship between Libya and the United States\".</p> <p>Small anti-American demonstrations in Damascus and Tehran appeared to have been facilitated by the authorities there.</p>",
  "<p>Major US banks are being investigated for insufficiently safeguarding against being used by drug dealers or terrorist groups to launder dirty money, it was reported Saturday.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/15/business/money-laundering-inquiry-said-to-target-us-banks.html?_r=0\">An article in the New York Times</a> suggested that federal and state authorities were ready to launch an aggressive crackdown on the failure to monitor transactions, in a move aimed at flagging to financial institutions that weak compliance is unacceptable.</p> <p>Officials told the Times that regulators are close to taking action against JP Morgan, while other firms including Bank of America are also being investigated over perceived shortcomings when it comes to putting a check on money-laundering activities.</p> <p>It comes just months after a Senate committee roundly criticised HSBC for ignoring warning signs that it was being used by money launderers and drug cartels in Mexico.</p> <p>US politicians also accused HSBC of circumventing US sanctions on countries including Cuba and Iran \u2013 a charge that has also been levied against JP Morgan.</p> <p>The Senate report was also highly critical of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), stating that the regulator needed to take \"stronger action\" on banks that exercise poor anti-money laundering controls.</p> <p>The OCC is now leading the crackdown on non-compliant banks, according to the New York Times report.</p> <p>It suggested that a \"cease-or-desist\" order could be issued against JP Morgan in the coming months, forcing the bank to review its checks, and implement measures to firm up its safeguards.</p> <p>Prosecutors from the justice department and the Manhattan district attorney's office are also investigating lapses at a number of financial institutions, it was reported.</p> <p>If action is taken against JP Morgan it will comes as a further blow to a bank still reeling from a $5.8bn trading loss that led to a political firestorm in the US and led to a tighter regulation of Wall Street.</p>",
