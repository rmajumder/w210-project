  "<p>It had been difficult to locate much optimism in Dublin beforehand about the Republic of Ireland's chances against the second-best team in world football. Never mind the chastening experiences of the Euro 2012 finals, when Giovanni Trapattoni's squad departed Poland battered and bowed, their World Cup qualification campaign had begun with them dodging a bullet in Kazakhstan. The late 2-1 victory was hugely fortuitous.</p> <p>There was no escape here in what represented a new low for the under-pressure Trapattoni. All of the pre-match fears were realised in brutal fashion as Germany, despite a slow start, purred through the gears to visit humiliation on Ireland. Marco Reus was the destroyer in chief, his first-half goals ending the game as a contest and begging the question that had always felt central to the occasion: by how many would Germany prevail?</p> <p>The second-half came to resemble a training exercise. The outstanding Mesut Ozil, Miroslav Klose and the substitute Toni Kroos got the goals \u2013 Kroos' pair were rattled in from distance \u2013 and it was a dismal experience for everyone connected to the Irish set-up. The minutes ticked like hours and the atmosphere, which had been vibrant at the start, when Ireland actually looked compact and committed, turned sour.</p> <p>It was the scale of the capitulation that was most worrying and Trapattoni has work to do to lift morale before Tuesday's tie in the Faroe Islands. It feels as if his job will be on the line. The Italian has shaped his Irish adventure upon defensive resilience but there was nothing here after the half hour, Germany cutting through them almost at will. Trapattoni's team have now conceded 16 times in five competitive ties and this was the heaviest home defeat in Irish football history. The substitute Andy Keogh's injury-time goal was the most hollow of consolations.</p> <p>Jon Walters, who started as the lone striker in a new-look Trapattoni formation, was perhaps the solitary positive and he caught the mood when he described the performance as \"embarrassing\".</p> <p>\"We let ourselves down, the manager down and we let the country down,\" he said. \"We can't be anything but apologetic.\"</p> <p>Trapattoni remained defiant, insisting his players would pick themselves up. He dismissed the suggestion that his time in the job was up; that he had run out of ideas to motivate the players. He said that he would fight on because he was \"proud\".</p> <p>It was ominous, though, that he spent a significant portion of his post-match briefing talking up his achievements in qualifying for Euro 2012 and, also, the very near miss at the 2010 World Cup. He reminded his audience of Ireland's state when he took over in 2008 and the amount of players he had developed. Nobody is criticising what he did up to the European Championship. It is what happened at them and since that is of deep concern. The future is fraught.</p> <p>Trapattoni had been forced to make sweeping changes as Ireland started for the first time in 15 years without Shay Given, Damien Duff, Richard Dunne or Robbie Keane. The first two have retired; the other two injured. With problems elsewhere, Trapattoni named only four players from the line-up that had started the final group tie of the failed Euro 2012 campaign against Italy. He prizes experience and continuity. The upheaval and lack of established international alternatives made him nervous.</p> <p>Joachim L\u00f6w, the Germany manager, could afford to start Kroos and Lukas Podolski on the substitutes' bench and omit Mario G\u00f6tze entirely. His team dictated the tempo and although they did not threaten until past the 30 minute mark, when they did, the tie turned sharply.</p> <p>Ireland's defensive concentration lapsed in shocking fashion when John O'Shea lost possession to Reus and then seemed to drag down the winger inside the penalty area. Surprisingly, the referee, Nicola Rizzoli, booked Reus for diving. The German had has his revenge in the next attack. Bastian Schweinsteiger's floated ball invited Marcel Schmelzer to maraud into the box and, when the ball broke, Reus shot high into the net.</p> <p>Germany's second brimmed with quality. They played the ball out from the back, under pressure and, once Ozil had dipped his shoulder and glided away from James McCarthy, the alarm bells sounded loudly. Ozil moved possession to the right-back J\u00e9r\u00f4me Boateng, he played it across the field for the advancing Reus and his low left-footed drive billowed the far corner of the net.</p> <p>Trapattoni made an attacking change in the 51st minute, bringing on Shane Long for Keith Fahey but the home crowd's mood was killed shortly afterwards when Darren O'Dea, already on a yellow card, cut recklessly through Klose inside the area. Ozil's penalty was ice-cool.</p> <p>Klose's goal came after he rounded Keiren Westwood and threaded home from a seemingly impossible angle while Kroos's shooting oozed power and conviction. His first, a vicious left-footed volley, was the goal of the tie but his second ran it close. Trapattoni could only admit to his team's \"inferiority.\"</p> <p>\"Usually, we are more aggressive,\" he said. \"But after 30 minutes, we were without strength or energy. We had no direction.\"</p> <p>The fear is that Trapattoni will not rediscover it.</p>",
  "<p>The amount of money invested in a \"sustainable and responsible\" manner in the UK has swelled to an estimated \u00a3275bn, a report has found. The study from Eurosif, the Brussels-based European Sustainable Investment Forum, claims that an exciting new phase in the development of ethical investment is now taking place in the UK. To mark National Ethical Investment Week, which starts on 14 October, Guardian Money looks at the latest themes on green finance and explains how you can join the ethical revolution.</p> <h2><strong>Rail:</strong> The right track for green investors</h2> <p>It says a lot about the changing nature of environmental investing that the latest theme in some portfolios is the glamour stock of the Victorian era \u2013 railway companies. Amid rising petrol prices and congested roads, many rail firms, particularly in the US, have enjoyed a renaissance, supported by environmental investors keen to see polluting trucks taken off the highways.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397648192\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/MONEY/Pix/pictures/2012/10/12/1350041320018/Train-in-sunset-001.jpg\" alt=\"Train in sunset\" width=\"220\" height=\"139\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">US train.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Public Domain</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In the 1970s and early 1980s many American railroad companies were on the verge of bankruptcy, having lost their passenger business to the car, and much of their freight as well. But they fought back with huge increases in fuel efficiency \u2013 America's railroads are three times more fuel efficient than sending freight by truck \u2013 and improved service reliability. Around 40% of freight in car-loving America is now carried by rail, a much higher figure than in Europe, while President Obama has agreed huge new federal investment in<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2009/apr/16/barack-obama-high-speed-rail\" title=\"\"> high-speed passenger lines</a>.</p> <p>Shares in railroad companies have soared. <a href=\"http://www.up.com/\" title=\"\">Union Pacific</a>, which dates back to 1862 and dominates west of Chicago, was trading at $30-$35 in 2004 but shares now change hands at more than $120. In 2009, legendary investor Warren Buffett bought America's second biggest rail operator, Burlington Northern Santa Fe, in a deal valuing the company at $44bn, while CSX, the third biggest operator, has seen its share price quadruple since 2004.</p> <p>Truck companies that work with the railroads rather than compete with them, have also benefited. <a href=\"http://www.jbhunt.com/\" title=\"\">JB Hunt</a>, one of the biggest road hauliers in the US, partners with railroad firms to cut carbon emissions. As an example, it says, it can truck a shipment from a Procter &amp; Gamble plant in Delaware on the east coast to a rail freight terminal in Pennsylvania, then transport it by train to Chicago, where it is switched to another train to California, and for the last 100 miles by road truck \u2013 again to a Walmart store. So a 3,000 mile shipment travels just 150 miles by road.</p> <p>It tells customers: \"We can help you convert more of your over-the-road shipments to rail, saving you money and reducing greenhouse emissions by 50%.\" It's a win-win for customers, investors and the environment. JB Hunt's share price has jumped from $6 at the start of 2003 to $55 this week.</p> <p>Train companies form a key part of <a href=\"http://www.jupiteronline.com/\" title=\"\">Jupiter Ecology's</a> \u00a3340m portfolio, managed by Charlie Thomas. \"When investing in environmental solutions companies, rail businesses tick many important boxes,\" he says. \"They score well in terms of pollution abatement and efficient use of natural resources, while also responding favourably to the demographic challenges caused by a rising population (eg improving local air quality and reducing congestion).\"</p> <p>He has invested in Kansas City Southern, as well as Hub Group, which, like JB Hunt, is an \"intermodal\" company maximising efficiency between road and rail. But it's not just a US story. Jupiter Ecology counts East Japan Railway among his top 10 holdings.</p> <h2><strong>Water:</strong> the big new wave</h2> <p>Ten litres of water is used to produce just one single sheet of A4 paper. Around 850 litres of water is needed to irrigate, grow and process the oranges squeezed to produce one litre of juice. And if you buy steak mince this weekend, consider this: it will have taken 7,750 litres of water to produce a half-kilo pack that's enough to make a few burgers.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397648193\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/MONEY/Pix/pictures/2012/10/12/1350041395163/An-orange-tree-001.jpg\" alt=\"An orange tree\" width=\"220\" height=\"144\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Orange tree Photograph: Etsa/Corbis</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Etsa/Corbis</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It's little wonder that environmentalists are deeply concerned about \"water stress\". Asia's industrial revolution is driving a vast increase in water demand \u2013 and the supply is running out. The United Nations reckons that if things stay as they are, by 2030 demand will exceed supply by 40%, leaving up to four billion people suffering acute shortages.</p> <p>Only 2.5% of the world's water is fresh, and two-thirds of it is in fast-melting polar ice and snow cover. China is particularly at risk as industrial expansion continues at a breakneck pace. The country has 21% of the world's population but only 7% of its available water. When countries industrialise, they use far more water. In the developed world, industry uses 42% of the water supply; in the developing world, 81% is used by agriculture. But as countries build power stations, steel plants and paper mills, their water consumption rockets.</p> <p>So how are ethical investors responding? Sue Round is head of investment at Ecclesiastical Insurance, which runs the <a href=\"http://www.ecclesiastical.com/foryou/investments/index.aspx\" title=\"\">Amity</a> range of green and ethical funds. Her starting point is encouraging water-intensive companies to disclose how much water they and their suppliers are using, through what's called the<a href=\"https://www.cdproject.net/water\" title=\"\"> Carbon Disclosure Water Project</a>. The project aims to put \"water stewardship\" at the heart of every company's business strategy.</p> <p>But is it having real impact? Round insists big companies are taking it seriously, citing Tesco as an example. It has worked with suppliers and factories to cut water usage by 300m litres a year. But while that's undoubtedly good for the environment, how does it help investors? Round points to Marks &amp; Spencer. \"It has made considerable water savings in recent years. All their environmental efficiencies have added significantly to their bottom line.\"</p> <p>The Amity International fund also invests in companies that are engineering solutions to the coming water crisis, such as recycling industrial and residential waste water. It holds shares in <a href=\"http://www.boustead.sg/\" title=\"\">Boustead</a>, a Singapore firm specialising in waste water engineering and whose products are in 800 water plants across the globe. \"Its treatment systems can safely return waste water to drinking water quality,\" says Round. Its share price is currently nearly $1, double the level of three years ago but still below the peak before the financial crisis.</p> <p>Ecclesiastical is also investing in desalination as a potential solution to water stress. It is estimated there are currently 543 ongoing desalination projects across 90 countries, each costing between $100m-$300m. Saudi Arabia and Qatar are the biggest investors, but there are major projects in the US and China. Even Thames Water has spent \u00a3250m on a desalination plant in Beckton, east London, which can supply drinking water for one million Londoners, and Southern Water is considering one on the south coast.</p> <p>\"Advances in technology have turned a proven but essentially uneconomic activity (boiling seawater to produce distilled vapour) into one increasingly attractive as a solution to water scarcity via membrane osmosis,\" concluded Ecclesiastical in a research note earlier this year. It believes desalination will be a significant investment play for ethical investors, naming GE, Suez and Siemens as potential stock beneficiaries.</p> <p>And most green funds now have a portion of their portfolio dedicated to water stocks, while others, such as <a href=\"http://www.worldwiseinvestor.com/library/fundview/CHP4/Pictet%20Water\" title=\"\">Pictet Water</a>, invest only in water.</p> <h2><strong>Agriculture:</strong> solutions, not speculation</h2> <p>Big agriculture and the ethical and green investment community rarely see eye to eye. Two years ago a Swiss investment research firm named agricultural firm Monsanto as the world's <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/01/28/the-least-ethical-compani_n_440073.html\" title=\"\">least ethical company</a>. Many ethical investors also despise the billions pouring into food exchange-traded funds (ETFs), where speculators are cashing in on constricted supply and rising food prices.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397648194\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/MONEY/Pix/pictures/2012/10/12/1350041262831/Close-up-of-Sweet-Corn-US-001.jpg\" alt=\"Close up of Sweet Corn USA\" width=\"220\" height=\"137\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sweetcorn USA Photograph:  /Alamy</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph:  /Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But one British agricultural firm is catching the attention of green investors worldwide. Genus, based in Basingstoke, is the former breeding division of the Milk Marketing Board and is regarded as the world leader in improving pig and cow herds. \"Basically it is seen as a&#xa0;green and ethical stock because it has developed techniques to reduce the amount of feed and water required to get meat on to people's tables,\" says Mark Hoskin of ethical financial advisers Holden &amp; Partners. Shares in Genus, now one of the 250 biggest stock market-quoted companies in Britain, have tripled since 2009 from 475p to 1474p this week. It is currently a top holding in Ecclesiastical's Amity fund.</p> <p>Other green and ethical fund managers focus on food quality. Triodos, the ethical bank, which is shortly to launch a sustainable equity fund, says food companies will make up around 12% of the portfolio. <a href=\"http://cheviot.co.uk/investment-funds/climate/factsheet\" title=\"\">Cheviot Climate Assets</a>, a&#xa0;relatively new environmental fund, has 13.4% of its fund in food, specialising in grain production and harvesting, food testing and food processing.</p> <p>The staple food stock, so to speak, of most green funds is <a href=\"http://www.wholefoodsmarket.com/\" title=\"\">Whole Foods Market</a>, the US&#xa0;organic supermarket chain with an outpost in London's Kensington. It has earned a Waitrose-style reputation in the US, where its combination of high quality and high prices have prompted wags to label it \"Whole Pay Check\". But its share price has hit $100 in recent trading, compared with just $10 in early 2009, and significantly above its 2006 peak of $77. Jupiter Ecology's largest holding is <a href=\"https://www.unfi.com/Pages/default.aspx\" title=\"\">United Natural Foods</a>, the biggest independent distributor of organic foods in North America. Despite the financial crisis, the squeeze on household budgets and rising unemployment, United Natural Foods' share price has increased from $25 to $60 over five years. When the credit crunch first struck, analysts reckoned that households would cut back on costly organic produce but it seems the opposite is true, in North America at least.</p> <p>\"The sector has grown by 10%-15% a&#xa0;year for the last 10 years but even after that it still only accounts for 4% of all grocery sales in America,\" says Charlie Thomas of Jupiter Ecology. \"However, the number of people putting an organic product in their supermarket basket has gone from 20% to 80% of households.\"</p> <p>Organic food suppliers and retailers may meet western levels for sustainable agriculture but John Ditchfield of ethical advisers <a href=\"http://www.barchestergreen.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Barchester Green</a> acknowledges they do little to alleviate hunger in poorer countries. However, he points to <a href=\"http://www.whebam.com/\" title=\"\">WHEB Asset Management</a>, a specialist fund manager focusing on challenges to the world economy, such as rising food prices and scarce water supply. It sees technology as part of the solution and is an investor in Trimble Navigation Systems, a GPS firm that tracks climate patterns to help farmers produce food more efficiently.</p> <h2><strong>Co-operatives:</strong> think small, think local</h2> <p>Many green investors are more than happy for their money to go into companies based overseas \u2013 US railroad operators, Asian water treatment firms and so on. But what if you want to invest in projects on your doorstep?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397648195\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/MONEY/Pix/pictures/2012/10/12/1350041196463/Butchers-Arms.-001.jpg\" alt=\"Butcher's Arms.\" width=\"220\" height=\"147\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Butcher's Arms. Photograph: Mark Pinder</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mark Pinder</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The good news is that across the country there are growing numbers of schemes enabling people to give financial backing to local projects, and hopefully earn a decent return, too.</p> <p>During the last couple of years, Guardian Money has featured several, from cafes and renewable energy projects, to pubs and post offices.</p> <p>These community-owned and run businesses are becoming increasingly common, and often there is an opportunity for locals \u2013 and others sympathetic to the cause \u2013 to invest by buying shares or \"loan stock\" (ie you lend a sum of money for a set period).</p> <p>Since 2009, around 15,000 people have invested in more than 100 community share issues, raising more than \u00a315m, according to the government. But this looks like an underestimate.</p> <p>Only last week, communities minister Don Foster launched a \"<a href=\"http://www.communityshares.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Community Shares Unit</a>\" to help local people become part-owners of much-loved assets and services such as their community pub or football club. Backed by the <a href=\"http://www.communities.gov.uk/corporate/\" title=\"\">Department for Communities and Local Government</a>, and run by <a href=\"http://uk.coop/\" title=\"\">Co-operatives UK</a> and <a href=\"http://locality.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Locality</a>, the unit aims to help more local enterprises use share offers to get projects up and running.</p> <p>There is clearly an appetite for such schemes: earlier this year, a share offer for a community solar power station called <a href=\"http://www.westmillsolar.coop/\" title=\"\">Westmill</a> on the Oxfordshire/Wiltshire border raised more than \u00a34m in just six weeks.</p> <p>With these schemes there is usually a minimum investment, which is sometimes as low as \u00a310-\u00a350 but, more typically, \u00a3200-\u00a3250. The projected investment returns can vary, though 4%-6% a year is not uncommon.</p> <p>There does not appear to be a \"one-stop-shop\" website that rounds up all the community projects across the country that are looking for investors. However, both the Community Shares Unit and the <a href=\"http://communitysharesfund.coop/\" title=\"\">Community Shares Fund</a> feature details of current and past share offers.</p> <p>Guardian Money will continue to highlight some of the more interesting schemes that come to our attention. For example, ethical investors in Great Britain are being encouraged to look across the Irish Sea and invest in Northern Ireland's first community-owned wind energy co-operative.</p> <p><a href=\"http://drumlin.coop/home.asp\" title=\"\">Drumlin Wind Energy Co-operative</a> has plans to operate five 250kW turbines north of Belfast, and has already raised \u00a31.6m, which will fund the first two. Individuals, businesses and organisations can invest between \u00a3250 and \u00a320,000; it believes it can offer an average annual return of 7% to 10% over 20 years. The share offer is open until 30 November.</p> <p>Another site worth checking is <a href=\"https://www.abundancegeneration.com/\" title=\"\">Abundance</a>, which describes itself as a \"community finance platform\" allowing people to put money into UK renewable energy schemes and receive a regular cash return based on the energy produced. It currently has two projects open: a wind turbine in the Forest of Dean, and a scheme to install solar panels on homes in the South Downs.</p>",
  "<p>Every week we receive tales of fraud, scams and rip-offs. The most distressing involve the callous exploitation of elderly savers, often through the telephone equivalent of \"door stepping\" where the scamsters won't hang up until they have fleeced their victim. But a tale we were sent this week is one of the most sickening I've heard.</p> <p>It involves a 75-year-old woman \u2013 we won't say her name \u2013 who was phoned by a firm, ostensibly in Dubai, that appealed not just to her vulnerability and naivety, but her good nature, too. The caller knew the lady had shares (how? she probably once had a holding in a privatisation or demutualisation, and names on share lists are swapped mercilessly between \"boiler room\" crooks). He convinced her to sell her existing shares \u2013 did she know they'd been under-performing? \u2013 and buy \"carbon credits\" instead. They're green, environmental and backed by governments around the world. What could go wrong?</p> <p>The crook could scarcely believe his luck when she handed over half her life savings, \u00a3133,690. When, later, she thought better of it, the crook said she'd signed a contract and if she didn't pay up he'd pursue her through the courts. Under pressure, she paid up \u2013 and the money disappeared into an account in Williamsburg, New York.</p> <p>Once you have been stung once, they try to sting you again. She was pestered and persuaded to hand over a further \u00a3100,000 \u2013 a sum that would leave her virtually penniless \u2013 to an account in Coconut Creek, Florida. Thankfully, her son found out, and at the last moment halted the transfer.</p> <p>He has since tried desperately to recover the money, but with no success. The Financial Services Authority is not interested (\"incredibly unsympathetic\" in his words) because carbon credits are outside the remit of regulators. In the looking-glass world of consumer investor protection, regulators can only intervene on \"authorised\" investments. Carbon credits are a recent invention, so you're on your own.</p> <p>They told him to contact the police, who helpfully gave him a crime reference number, but precious little else. The victim's bank was negligent, too \u2013 use your card on holiday in Dubai and it will block your account unless warned \u2013 but hand over \u00a3133,690 to an account in America and that's fine and dandy.</p> <p>The final twist in this story comes from JP Morgan, the giant US bank, who rang the lady to promise help in recovering the money, for a \u00a32,000 fee. She nearly paid. Of course, it wasn't JP Morgan but the same fraudsters trying to squeeze out the last drop of cash.</p> <p>Sadly, we can do nothing to help, except to warn others. There is a real market in \"certified\" carbon credits, but the \"voluntary\" credits sold to our victim are almost worthless.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.nfib.police.uk/june-12-carbon-credit-fraud.html\" title=\"\">National Fraud Intelligence Bureau</a>, run by the City of London Police, is blunt. In June it issued a statement which said: \"If you buy carbon credits you WILL NOT make any money no matter what the salesman says.\"</p> <p>The low-lifes and toerags who target the elderly will stoop to anything. Always put the phone down \u2013 and tell everyone you know to do the same.</p>",
  "<p>A few days ago, I&#xa0;polished off my final blackberry and apple crumble of the year, made with the very last pickings from our resident brambles. So it'll be 10 or so months before I taste a&#xa0;freshly picked blackberry again. Am I downhearted? Not really. In fact, I'm quite perky, because the last blackberry is not the end of the wild fruit story for the year. Very far from it. Brambles are actually one of the earlier fruits of the hedgerow crop, delightful, juicy harbingers of the colourful and delicious harvest to come. If you've been out and about picking these lovely fruits, I hope you'll sally forth again and again as the autumn progresses, to gather hips, haws and their wild brethren. They may not have the blackberry's advantage of being immediate ambulant consumption, but take a hatful home and they can be cooked into all kinds of splendid things.</p> <p>What you'll be able to pick depends very much on your location and the time of year, but even in the middle of a town, over the next four weeks there are likely to be wild fruits worth picking within walking distance of your front door. Rowan is perhaps the first to look out for \u2013 this lovely tree, also known as mountain ash, can be found in the wild, but it's also a popular municipal planting in gardens and parks. Its bright orange-red berries make one of my favourite fruit jellies (in the preserved sense, rather than the tea party one), with a deep, woody flavour that's notably good with roast meat.</p> <p>Hawthorn is another very widely available wild plant, easy to identify because of its distinctive, raggedy-lobed leaves. Its small scarlet berries, or haws, pepper hedgerows up and down the land. If you can gather even a sandwich-boxful, try this week's haw-sin sauce \u2013 it's really very good.</p> <p>Also hugely plentiful, and just as common in urban as rural settings, is&#xa0;the elder tree. Its wine-dark little berries are right at the end of their season now, but you may still be able to gather a few. Don't worry if they're all gone, though: there's plenty of time for other generous wild crops. Plump, purple sloes will cling to the blackthorns well into November (try them in a sloe version of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2012/sep/07/damson-recipes-hugh-fearnley-whittingstall\" title=\"\">last month's damson vodka recipe</a>). Sharp little crab apples should be grabbed whenever you can, because they're incredibly useful in the kitchen. And then there are rosehips, with their glowing, crimson skins. These grow wildly, widely and often abundantly in most parts of the UK and, generally, their flavour gets better as the season progresses. You don't eat them raw \u2013 their tough carapace conceals a nest of seeds surrounded by tiny fibres that are a nasty irritant \u2013 but once cooked, strained and sweetened, rosehips release a gorgeous, deep, honeyed flavour, and make a wonderful syrup and a&#xa0;beautiful hedgerow jelly.</p> <p>You don't need any special equipment to gather these fruits, except perhaps secateurs for the rosehips. Just wear stout footwear and thick gardening gloves because the hedgerow is a thorny place. I&#xa0;avoid gathering fruits close to busy roads, though I'm less picky about that these days since my foraging friend <a href=\"http://www.wild-food.net/page/about+john+wright\" title=\"\">John Wright</a> pointed out that pollution from cars is not what it was when we all used leaded petrol. I'm more concerned, in fact, about not foraging in field margins where chemical sprays may have got to the fruit. And, as my mum taught me in my formative blackberrying years, I&#xa0;generally forage above the height at which an alsatian cocks its leg. Beyond that, just make sure you know what you're harvesting (<a href=\"http://www.wild-food.net/book/1/Hedgerow\" title=\"\">John's&#xa0;Hedgerow Handbook</a> is indispensable, or take a smartphone for instant online identification). Give everything a thorough wash and pick-over when you get home, and you are all set for an autumn of particularly mellow fruitfulness.</p> <h2>Crab apple and sloe sorbet</h2> <p>The sorbet is also good made with a&#xa0;handful of damsons or blackberries instead of sloes. Serves eight.</p> <p><strong>About 1kg crab apples (or cooking apples), washed and cut into chunks (no need to peel or core them)</strong><br><strong>A couple of handfuls of sloes</strong><br><strong>125g caster sugar</strong></p> <p>You want 1kg of fruit in total, with the bulk being apples. Put the apples and sloes in a heavy-based pan and add 150ml water (250ml if using cooking apples). Bring to a simmer and cook for 15 minutes, until reduced to a pulp. Tip into a sieve and rub through with a wooden spoon to remove the skins and pips, and create a pur\u00e9e.</p> <p>Put the sugar in a pan with 150ml water, heat gently and stir to dissolve the sugar. Bring to a boil and boil for five minutes. Stir this into the pur\u00e9e, leave to cool, then chill. Process in an ice-cream machine (you'll need one with a decent capacity \u2013 around 1.5 litres) until semi-set, then transfer to the freezer. Alternatively, pour into a plastic container, freeze for an&#xa0;hour, or until the sides start to&#xa0;get solid, then mash together with a fork and freeze for another hour. Repeat twice more at hourly intervals, then let the sorbet set solid.</p> <h2>Hedgerow jelly</h2> <p>Many hedgerow berries make a wonderful preserve that's good for both sweet and savoury applications: try blackberries, rosehips, haws, sloes, elderberries or rowan berries. These wild fruits are low in pectin, so combine them with apples to get a good set. Wild crab apples work well, as do cooking apples such as bramleys. However, cooking apples usually release less liquid than crabs, so your yield may be lower. You don't have to stick to these proportions: I&#xa0;sometimes make a jelly that's one-third apples to two-thirds berries; likewise, a mostly apple jelly with a&#xa0;handful of berries will still be good. It's not really worth making a jelly with much less than 1.5kg fruit, but work with what you forage. Makes enough to fill four to eight small jars.</p> <p><strong>1kg crab apples or cooking apples, , washed and cut into chunks (no need to peel or core them)</strong><br><strong>1kg blackberries, rosehips, haws, sloes, elderberries or rowan berries</strong><br><strong>Granulated sugar</strong></p> <p>Put the apples and berries in a&#xa0;preserving pan. (If using rosehips, chop them roughly first, though take care because the fibres inside them are an irritant, so do this in a&#xa0;processor, if need be.) Add enough water almost to cover the fruit, bring to a simmer, and leave to cook gently until the fruit is soft and pulpy. Tip into a jelly bag and leave to drip for several hours or overnight.</p> <p>Prepare your jam jars by washing them in hot soapy water, then put them in a low oven to dry out and heat up. Put a saucer in the fridge.</p> <p>Measure the juice and transfer to the clean preserving pan. For every 600ml juice, add 450g sugar. Bring slowly to a boil, stirring to dissolve the sugar, then bring up to a rolling boil and boil hard for eight minutes. Now start testing for setting point. Turn off the heat, use a teaspoon to drip a little jelly on to the cold saucer and return to the fridge for a couple of minutes. Push the jelly with your fingertip: if it has formed a significant skin that wrinkles with the push, it's reached setting point; if not, turn the heat back on and boil for two to three minutes more, then test again. (Err on the side of caution: a lightly set jelly is far nicer than a&#xa0;tough, solid one.</p> <p>Once setting point is reached, pour into the hot, sterilised jars and seal at once. Leave to cool, label and store in a cool, dark place. Use within a&#xa0;year, and refrigerate after opening.</p> <h2>Haw-sin sauce</h2> <p>Haws are more abundant than blackberries, and just as easy to pick. They're too hard and bitter to eat straight off the bush, but they give a&#xa0;lovely fruity flavour to hedgerow jellies and wines, and can be used to make this delicious sweet-sour sauce, which comes from my friend <a href=\"http://www.rivercottage.net/users/Pam%20the%20Jam/\" title=\"\">Pam Corbin</a>. Use it like a ketchup, or a&#xa0;dipping sauce, or add to a stir-fry. Makes one 330ml bottle.</p> <p><strong>500g haw berries</strong><br><strong>300ml cider vinegar</strong><br><strong>170g granulated sugar</strong><br><strong>Sea salt and freshly ground black&#xa0;pepper</strong></p> <p>Wash a bottle and a vinegar-proof screwtop or stopper in hot, soapy water, then put them in a low oven to dry out and heat up.</p> <p>Wash the berries and remove any stalks and leaves. Put them in a pan with the vinegar and 300ml water. Bring to a boil, lower the heat and simmer for 30 minutes, by which time the berries will have turned a&#xa0;dull brown and their skins will have split to reveal their yellow flesh.</p> <p>Tip into a sieve over a clean pan and rub the fruit through with a&#xa0;wooden spoon, leaving the skins and pips behind. Add the sugar to the pur\u00e9e in the pan and heat gently, stirring, until it dissolves. Bring to a&#xa0;boil and simmer for five minutes, stirring often to ensure it doesn't catch. Funnel the hot sauce into the hot, clean bottle and seal straight away. This sauce improves with age, so if you can leave it for a few weeks before opening. Use within a year and refrigerate once open.</p> <p>\u2022 For the latest news from River Cottage HQ, go to <a href=\"http://www.rivercottage.net\" title=\"\">rivercottage.net</a>.</p> <p>Hugh's new book, Three Good Things, is published by Bloomsbury at \u00a325.

So in a sense the most compelling influence on my novel, apart (obliquely) from Greek myths, which are almost always about unhappy families, was the poetry of Pound, Apollinaire, EE Cummings, HD, Baudelaire and Plath.</p> <p>And music too. While I was writing <em>Swimming Home</em>, the song that haunted me most was Nirvana's <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTWKbfoikeg\" title=\"\">\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\"</a>. When the poet laureate of yearning, <a href=\"http://observer.guardian.co.uk/kurtcobain\" title=\"\">Kurt Cobain</a>, numbly riffs \"hello hello hello\", I often think about what it is he wished for and whether hello might have meant goodbye. Whatever, it moves me every time. If we all sometimes use words to conceal rather than reveal what it is we really mean, it seems to me there is quite a lot at stake in the ways we manipulate everyday language. Do we have to be writers to have a great deal invested in language? These questions are nuanced in the events that take place in what turned out to be my most tightly plotted novel.</p> <p><em>Swimming Home</em> is set in a smart villa in the French Riviera. It was clear to me that I had to build a sense of place that was as defined and memorable as Gatsby's opulent white mansion.<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2012/jun/10/great-gatsby-fitzgerald-jay-mcinerney\" title=\"\"> F Scott Fitzgerald reveals that Jay Gatsby</a> was born James Gatz. I too have the identity of my male protagonist slide precariously between two names, Joe and Jozef \u2013 although he is often called ruder things. The villa in <em>Swimming Home </em>had to have the solid walls of a realist novel because I was going to make someone walk straight through them. In this sense <em>Swimming Home </em>merges the European modernism of its influences with some of the traditions of British realism. I wanted to create an uncanny atmosphere in which the past and the near future co-exist in the present of every sunny day.</p> <p>By the time I wrote the final draft, I discovered that minor characters were becoming fairly major. It was rather like supporting actors in a film taking the writer aside to complain that they don't have enough lines. In the end I had to agree with them. Cinema was deeply influential. A major inspiration was <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RjUya7KXmA\" title=\"\">Frank Perry's <em>The Swimmer</em></a>, adapted from the <a href=\"http://shortstoryclassics.50megs.com/cheeverswimmer.html\" title=\"\">John Cheever story</a>, with an incandescent performance from an athletic, ageing Burt Lancaster. <em>The Swimmer</em> is a bleak story told in a cunningly light-hearted tone: \"The day was beautiful and it seemed to him that a long swim might enlarge and celebrate its beauty.\" I enjoyed the visual pleasure of the glittering blue pools of suburban Connecticut and noted the way the melancholy anti-hero flirts and lies to conceal his state of mind. The other film that kept returning to me was <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/video/2012/jun/21/discreet-charm-bourgeoisie-video\" title=\"\">Luis Bu\u00f1uel's <em>The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie</em></a>, centred as it is on the absurd rituals of a group of middle-class people.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_m85eoa-8s\" title=\"\">Godard's <em>Le M\u00e9pris/Contempt</em></a> (1963) was an indirect influence. I was intrigued by how Brigitte Bardot is directed to be almost angry about her beauty. Some of <em>Le M\u00e9pris </em>is set in a villa in Capri and it is here that the Bardot character accelerates the contempt she feels for her writer husband, who is using her physical beauty as bait to get himself a job. In <em>Swimming Home</em>, the beautiful but fragile Kitty Finch has to field the desiring but often aggressive gaze of every character in the novel. She is the daughter of the woman who cleans the villa. I made sure that she indiscreetly stares right back at them.</p> <h2><strong>Hilary Mantel: Bring Up the Bodies</strong> (Fourth Estate)<br></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397592473\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Books/Pix/pictures/2012/10/11/1349970044121/bringupbodies-002.jpg\" alt=\"bringupbodies\" width=\"140\" height=\"215\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">xxx</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In May 1536, a queen of England was brought under guard into the open air before a large crowd. She said her last words, made her final prayer, and waited, kneeling upright. The executioner took off her head with a single stroke of his sword. The shock of that brutal moment resonates still. Through the centuries, writers and historians have reworked and reimagined the last days of Anne Boleyn. But the retelling does not sap the power of the story. It seems to intensify its horror. There is always something left over, something unexplained, something insufficiently imagined: something that asks you to strip back the narrative and start again. It is as if her last words are still hanging in the air, and we are straining to pick them out from the white noise of history.</p> <p>In my 2009 novel <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2009/may/02/wolf-hall-hilary-mantel\" title=\"\"><em>Wolf Hall</em></a>, I offered a version of the early life of Thomas Cromwell, who rose from the humblest beginnings \u2013 his father was a brewer and blacksmith \u2013 to become the right-hand man of Henry VIII, and eventually Earl of Essex. Sardonic, deceptively amiable, and clever as a bag of snakes, Cromwell helped cut through the knotty business of Henry's first divorce. England split with Rome. Henry assumed the headship of the English church, and married the woman he believed could make him happy and give him a son. Three years on, still without an heir, he was ready for a new wife, and Cromwell was ready for regime change. He had been the servant of the Boleyn family, but he no longer needed them. The Boleyns had become a political liability, an international embarrassment. And Anne, he told the Spanish ambassador, was out for his blood.</p> <p>Until now this story has not been told through Cromwell's eyes. What can a novelist add to the painstaking work of historians? Perhaps nothing; all she can do is create a parallel version, an intimate version, sneak you into rooms where the door is barred. This affair was a conspiracy. It did not, by its nature, leave those traces in the written record that historians need to understand it. Perhaps we can't understand it unless we can feel it: the foetid atmosphere of Henry's court, seething with malice, suspicion, fear. The double nature of every word and deed. The retrospective rereading of each incident, each utterance, that could lead to arrest, trial, verdict. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2012/may/11/hilary-mantel-on-anne-boleyn\" title=\"\">Anne Boleyn </a>had many enemies, and some false friends. Five men were bundled to their deaths during those spring days, accused of being her lovers and of plotting the king's death. He has found guilty men, Cromwell says: \"Though perhaps not guilty as charged.\"</p> <p>The action of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2012/may/04/bring-up-the-bodies-hilary-mantel-review\" title=\"\"><em>Bring Up the Bodies </em></a>is compacted into nine months. It feels different from <em>Wolf Hall</em> to read, and it was different to write; it was a condensed exercise in dread. The action goes week by week, day by day, as the plot against the Boleyns is formed. It goes hour by hour, as Anne, in the tower, laughs hysterically and talks her chances away. Then minute by minute as she is led to the scaffold, then second by second, until the swordsman raises his arm and Cromwell walks away from the pool of gore, into the next phase of his remarkable and alarming career, and into the third part of my trilogy. Historians may disagree about his morals, about his role: but no one can question the fascination of his rise and fall. There is no statue to Cromwell, no monument. So I am trying to make one out of paper.</p> <h2><strong>Alison Moore: The Lighthouse </strong>(Salt)<br></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397592474\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Books/Pix/pictures/2012/10/11/1349971496055/thelighthouse-002.jpg\" alt=\"thelighthouse\" width=\"140\" height=\"215\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">xx</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Towards the end of 2009, I started to write a story about a man obsessed with a woman with whom he had once had a relationship. It opened with him alone in her kitchen, having trouble with his shoes. I was only a little way into it when I was invited to submit a short story to Nightjar Press for publication as a chapbook. After writing that, I returned to the just-begun story and could see that while I was drawn to my characters and interested in the emerging themes, it needed more movement. It struck me that a circular walk I'd been on with my husband in 2007 would be the ideal setting for a story about returning and repetition, the story of a man who is having trouble finding his way. The diary I'd kept \u2013 I usually write one when I'm abroad \u2013 was full of useful details and helped me to reconnect with that week of walking.</p> <p>Thinking about family and home, loss and substitution, I was exploring the idea of people and places associated with shelter and comfort and safety, but in fact having the potential to do great harm, which brought me to lighthouses, which have always interested me. I liked the idea of a confusion between a light to guide you home and what the beam from a lighthouse signifies. I was at the same time reading Muriel Spark's <em>Complete Short Stories</em> and serendipitously came across the line \"she became a tall lighthouse sending out kindly beams which some took for welcome instead of warnings against the rocks\", which I used as an epigraph.</p> <p>As for the physical lighthouses in the story, my husband and I had been&#xa0;on a coastal walk in Cornwall and had lunch up on the cliffs overlooking Godrevy lighthouse. That's what I was picturing when I wrote the family picnic scene where Futh acquires the lighthouse perfume case. And when I got to the point where I wanted him to have such a thing, a bit of online research revealed that, wonderfully, such a thing existed, and it was of German origin.</p> <p>I enjoyed connecting the idea of a lighthouse's warning signals with other elements of the text, so again and again throughout the narrative, people are in various ways warning Futh away. Before he reaches Hellhaus, they say to him, \"Stay away\", or, \"Stay here\". At the hotel, it is Bernard who says to Futh, \"You should go\", and to another man, \"Get the fuck out\". When Futh is walking away from Hellhaus, he is told that he is \"going in the right direction\". As he makes his way back, he is told, \"You want to be going in the other direction.\" But this is not a warning signal he can understand, and as he returns to Hellhaus he is anticipating its comforts.</p> <p>Futh's story, of course, hinges on the absence of his mother, whom he is in one way or another constantly seeking. I've no doubt that this stems from my mum dying. I wasn't a child, I was 24, but I had the dream Futh has \u2013 I dreamed she'd been reincarnated and had sent me her new name and address so that I could go and see her, but I couldn't read her writing. My son was born in 2009, so I suppose I was thinking about my mum more than usual when I started writing this story about a man and his obsession with a woman who leaves and never comes back.</p> <h2><strong>Will Self: Umbrella </strong>(Bloomsbury)<br></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397592475\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Books/Pix/pictures/2012/10/11/1349971684467/umbrella-002.jpg\" alt=\"umbrella\" width=\"140\" height=\"215\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">c</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For a writer who increasingly mistrusts the metaphoric \u2013 nothing, in the final analysis as much as the first impression, is like anything other than itself \u2013 when it comes to the subject of my own books, and my attitude to them, I find myself mired in similitude. So, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2012/aug/19/umbrella-will-self-review\" title=\"\"><em>Umbrella</em></a>, like all my other novels, seems to have come about through the conjoining of one idea or preoccupation with another, until, having reached a critical mass this fissionable material exploded and so produced the blast pattern that is the text itself.</p> <p>Three principal ideas contributed the most to this critical mass. First, there was family history. Having reached my 40s, like many another slightly nerdy man (and I think it is a mostly male preoccupation), I started looking into my immediate ancestry. I was interested in the first Self \u2013 in the patrilineal line, of course \u2013 to have lived in London, but on my way back to Adolphus Samuel Self, carriage painter, resident in Kennington in the 1840s, I stopped by my grandfather's family, who at the time of the 1911 census were living in Fulham; where my great-grandfather, the flamboyant Samuel \"Rothschild\" Self, was the night garage manager for the London Omnibus Company. This much I had already known \u2013 I also knew that my grandfather had a couple of sisters. What I had never heard mentioned was a brother, and yet there he was: Stanley Self, a couple of years younger than my grandfather, and just the right age to have fought in the first world war.</p> <p>I've never found out for certain, my nerdiness gave out at the prospect of a trip to the necessary regimental archive, and besides, by then I'd already decided to fictionalise the material, which made the facts quite unimportant to me. But what this did bring home, yet again, was the impact of the first world war on the British psyche \u2013 something brought into further salience by a reading of <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/reviews/book-of-a-lifetime-the-great-war-and-modern-memory-by-paul-fussell-2264683.html\" title=\"\">Paul Fussell's <em>The Great War and Modern Memory</em></a>, a work ostensibly of literary criticism, although Fussell's real thesis is that the war \u2013 and in particular the trench war in Flanders \u2013 represented a sort of forcing ground for the ironic consciousness that went on to dominate the 20th century, and beyond.</p> <p>The third main idea furled into <em>Umbrella</em> comes from <a href=\"http://www.oliversacks.com/books/awakenings/\" title=\"\">Oliver Sacks's <em>Awakenings</em></a>, his astonishing account of giving a new drug, L-Dopa, to the comatose post-encephalitic patients he found in Highlands hospital, in Brooklyn, in the late 60s. I first read Sacks's book in the early 80s and I think that, like a comatose post-encephalitic, it lay dormant in me for a long while, waiting to be roused at the appropriate time. On rereading <em>Awakenings</em>, I realised that its schema was a gift for a novelist; there was the five-decade caesura in these patients' lives that coincided with the core of the 20th century \u2013 and in particular with the mechanisation of ordinary life \u2013 and there were their symptoms of ticcing and jerking, of festination, hypertonia and akinesia; exaggerated physical states that seemed to mirror the mechanical.</p> <p>It's easy, therefore, to see why I should sit down to write a novel about a Cockney post-encephalitic patient, with two brothers, one lost on the Somme, the other \u2013 based on my own grandfather \u2013 a high-speed social climber and mathematical savant. Audrey Death, in <em>Umbrella</em>, is a sort of personification of the impact of technology on society over the past century \u2013 and her awakening in Friern hospital (formerly Colney Hatch lunatic asylum, latterly a luxury flats development), by my long-term fictional accompanist, psychiatrist Zack Busner, allowed me to investigate a mass of ideas and emotions.</p> <p>Many who have commented on <em>Umbrella</em> have been preoccupied by formalism, singling out its use of the high modernist techniques of stream-of-consciousness and the continuous present \u2013 but these were always of secondary importance to me, simply the tools necessary for the job of getting these characters, these ideas, and their commingling through time, down on the shattered page.</p> <h2><strong>Jeet Thayil: Narcopolis </strong>(Faber)<br></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397592476\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Books/Pix/pictures/2012/10/11/1349971932334/narcopolis-002.jpg\" alt=\"narcopolis\" width=\"140\" height=\"215\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">v</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Seven or so years ago, I was living at a friend's apartment on <a href=\"https://maps.google.co.uk/maps?client=safari&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;q=Cemetery+Road+in++Mumbai&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;hq=&amp;hnear=0x3be7b637ccca9c67:0x6bbce515b6aaf675,Cemetery+Rd,+Jogeshwari+West,+Mumbai,+Maharashtra,+India&amp;gl=uk&amp;ei=ZwtsUIT2OqO70QWcqoHwBA&amp;ved=0CCIQ8gEwAA\" title=\"\">Cemetery Road in Bombay</a> and working on a book. I thought it would be a non-fiction book about India's religions. As it turned out, I was wrong. But at the time it seemed appropriate to be living in the Roman Catholic suburb of Bandra, on a street named after a Jewish cemetery. Bombay's cemeteries are delineated by community, Chinese, Muslim, Jewish, European; and they are extremely crowded. The cemeteries were not designed to accommodate the great numbers of the dead that are housed in them. And there are impromptu guests, the unidentified bodies found on the city's railway tracks, garbage dumps and streets, who are buried at random, or incinerated and disposed of without rites or names or permanent resting places. Even in death, Bombay's citizens are at the mercy of real estate. Only the Parsis are immune, because their dead are left on the Towers of Silence to be pecked at by vultures.</p> <p>There were three cemeteries on Cemetery Road, the Jewish one and two others, St Peter's seaside cemetery and the St Francis of Assisi cemetery. There was a crematorium, too, though it had never been in use. It always struck me when I returned to the apartment, or left it, that it was an interesting place to live. According to my friend, one of the houses on the street had been a brothel, a famous one, and though it was no longer in business, old residents still referred to it as The Brothel. Between the brothel and the cemeteries, between sex and its albino twin, Cemetery Road's residents conducted their lives, hurriedly.</p> <p>I was living on Cemetery Road and writing of elsewhere. I travelled around India and kept at the book, until one morning, for no reason at all, I wrote a chapter titled \"A Walk on Shuklaji Street\". I wrote more chapters, very quickly. I recalled moments I did not know I had stored away, snatches of old Hindi film music, bits of conversation, a slant of dusty light in the late afternoon, a room in which life occurred at floor level, a face lit by an oil lamp. What I was writing was clearly fiction, based on the 20 or so years I had spent in Bombay as a young man. I understood that the book had decided its own shape and it would be foolish to resist \u2013 that it would be foolish to do anything other than follow where the characters led. It became a novel about Bombay in the late 70s, 80s and 90s: a memorial to a vanished city and to people I knew who died. I decided to call it <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2012/feb/17/narcopolis-jeet-thayil-review\" title=\"\"><em>Narcopolis</em></a>, because Bombay seemed to me a city of intoxication, where the substances on offer were drugs and alcohol, of course, but also god, glamour, power, money and sex; because the city was built on opium shipped to China by the British East India Company working with a small group of Parsi ship owners, a secret history omitted by most history books; because I thought of the people I used to know as Narco Polos, voyagers into the unknown, who seldom returned whole or alive; because I was living on Cemetery Road and it seemed to me I was living in a city of the dead; and because this title suggested another, a hidden title, Necropolis.</p> <p>Like the city, Cemetery Road has been renamed. It is now the Khadeswari Mandir Marg, which evokes nothing and promises less than nothing. I no longer live in Bombay.</p> <h2><strong>Tan Twan Eng: The Garden of Evening Mists </strong>(Myrmidon)<br></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397592470\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Books/Pix/pictures/2012/10/11/1349972206117/thegarden-002.jpg\" alt=\"thegarden\" width=\"140\" height=\"215\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">d</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borrowed_scenery\" title=\"\">\"Shakkei\" \u2013 the Art of Borrowed Scenery</a> \u2013 is one of the main principles in Japanese gardening. When designing a garden, the gardener will utilise the trees in a neighbour's property, or the mountains in the distance; he will even borrow from the clouds, the wind and the mists. The gardener incorporates these elements and views into the garden, making them integral to his creation. He must do it so skilfully, so seamlessly, that visitors to the garden are never aware of it.</p> <p>Can shakkei be a metaphor for creative writing? There are similarities between the Art of Borrowed Scenery and the techniques of fiction. Using the elements of time, setting and atmosphere, a writer creates a space for the reader to flesh out these characters in his own mind. In the process the reader lends something of his own \"scenery\" to these characters, making them feel more real to him, more alive.</p> <p>One of the characters in my novel is Yugiri, the Garden of Evening Mists. It interacts with the other characters \u2013 in particular Yun Ling and Aritomo, the main protagonists. It borrows from their emotions and their responses. Yun Ling and the gardener Aritomo \u2013 and everyone who enters Yugiri \u2013 react to the garden in their individual ways. Yugiri, Yun Ling and Aritomo are mirrors, reflecting and borrowing from one another. So what is real, and what is only a reflection of a reflection of a reflection?</p> <p>\"Every aspect of gardening is a form of deception,\" remarks Yun Ling. Writing a novel is similar to designing and creating a Japanese garden: both arts require artifice and lies. Every single object in a garden is carefully selected and placed to create the optimal effect; the same with words and sentences in a work of fiction. For a novel \u2013 and a garden \u2013 to succeed, the lie has to convince, to beguile. Like the gardener, the writer must create a believable world. Yun Ling realises this when she leads a group of visitors through Aritomo's garden: \"The turns in the track disoriented not only our sense of direction, but also our memories, and within minutes I could almost imagine that we had forgotten the world from which we had just come.\"</p> <p>Are we aware that shakkei is part of our daily existence? \"A garden borrows from the earth, the sky, and everything around it, but you borrow from time,\" Yun Ling tells Aritomo. \"Your memories are a form of shakkei too. You bring them in to make your life here feel less empty.\"</p> <p>We borrow not only from our own memories, but also from the memories of the people around us. And it isn't only memories that create the shakkei of our lives, but everything we see and hear and experience, everyone we meet and talk to and who talks to us. We borrow from the music we listen to, from the books we read. We borrow from the past and the present. We borrow from the future, those far mountains we will reach one day. We borrow all these into our lives, and they form the ever-changing landscape in which we travel, day after day.</p> <p>\u2022 The winner of the 2012 Man Booker prize will be announced on Tuesday.

  "<h2>Lewisburg, West Virginia</h2> <p>One of the <a href=\"http://www.preservationnation.org/\" title=\"\">National Trust for Historic Preservation</a>'s \"distinctive destinations\", Lewisburg was voted coolest small town in the US by <a href=\"http://www.budgettravel.com/\" title=\"\">Budget Travel</a> magazine. What makes it so special? There's its arts scene: <strong>Carnegie Hall</strong> (<a href=\"http://www.carnegiehallwv.com\" title=\"\">carnegiehallwv.com</a>) for arthouse films, lectures and live music, and a jazz and blues festival; <strong>Greenbrier Valley Theatre</strong> (<a href=\"http://www.gvtheatre.org/\" title=\"\">gvtheatre.org</a>); art galleries (<a href=\"http://www.downtownlewisburg.com/galleries.html\" title=\"\">downtownlewisburg.com</a>); and its literary festival (<a href=\"http://www.lewisburgliteraryfestival.com/\" title=\"\">lewisburgliteraryfestival.com</a>). The historic district has around 60 18th- and 19th-century buildings, including a lovely church and a museum. Surrounding <strong>Greenbrier county</strong> is known for meat, cheese and fruit, sold at the farmers' market on Saturday mornings and in local cafes and restaurants. There's a buzzing cafe culture, two artisan bakers and two annual food festivals. Out of town there is great hiking and cycling in wooded and mountainous countryside, and fishing and rafting on the <strong>Greenbrier river</strong>. Accommodation ranges from historic inns and quaint B&amp;Bs in town to log cabins and country estates, such as <strong>Swift Level</strong> (<a href=\"http://www.theswiftlevel.com\" title=\"\">theswiftlevel.com</a>, from $225 a night for four), a family-run farmstead.</p> <h2>San Luis Obispo, California</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397600501\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Late_offers/pictures/2012/10/11/1349967700941/San-Luis-Obispo-Californi-001.jpg\" alt=\"San Luis Obispo, California\" width=\"460\" height=\"277\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">One of the vineyards near San Luis Obispo.

It's an old city \u2013 one of the oldest in California \u2013 but with a youthful vibe. The well-preserved centre has great bars, including a brewpub serving around 10 home-brewed beers (<a href=\"http://www.slobrewingco.com/\" title=\"\">slobrewingco.com</a>). Wine is another big attraction \u2013 so it's no wonder this is known as the happiest city in America. <strong>Edna Valley</strong>, <strong>Arroyo Grande Valley</strong> and <strong>Avila Valley</strong> are home to small, family-run wineries, most open for tastings (<a href=\"http://slowine.com/cm/wineries_vineyards/member_wineries.html\" title=\"\">slowine.com</a>). <strong>Koberl at Blue</strong> (<a href=\"http://www.epkoberl.com/\" title=\"\">epkoberl.com</a>) is a restaurant serving dishes specially designed to complement the central coast's wines. The Thursday night market (<a href=\"http://www.slocountyfarmers.org/\" title=\"\">slocountyfarmers.org</a>) is a large, rowdy affair, with students, bands and cyclists clogging the streets. There is a campsite at nearby <strong>Montana de Oro state park</strong> (<a href=\"http://www.slostateparks.com/montana_de_oro/default.asp\" title=\"\">slostateparks.com</a>), which has miles of sandy beaches, and there is great kayaking between Shell and Pismo beaches, where there are sea caves to explore. The <strong>Madonna Inn</strong> (<a href=\"http://www.madonnainn.com/index.php\" title=\"\">madonnainn.com</a>, doubles from $189) is an eccentric local landmark \u2013 a theme hotel that's worth a visit, if only to check out the rock waterfall urinal in the men's bathroom.</p> <h2>Tucson, Arizona</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397600502\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Late_offers/pictures/2012/10/11/1349967537931/Tucson-Arizona-001.jpg\" alt=\"Tucson, Arizona\" width=\"460\" height=\"277\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Fox Theatre, Tucson.

Summers here are fiercely hot, with temperatures regularly topping 40C, with a monsoon season in August and September. But winters are mild, with highs up to 24C, and spring \u2013 which begins in February \u2013 is a wonderful time to visit. The <strong>Fiesta de los Vaqueros</strong>, or rodeo week, takes place then (16-24 February 2013, <a href=\"http://www.tucsonrodeo.com/\" title=\"\">tucsonrodeo.com</a>). The city centre has been spruced up recently and has some interesting historic areas and architectural gems such as the restored <strong>Fox Theatre</strong> (<a href=\"http://www.foxtucsontheatre.org/mainhome.php\" title=\"\">foxtucsontheatre.org</a>). But the spectacular desert scenery around the city is the real draw: standout spots are <strong>Sabino Canyon </strong>(<a href=\"http://www.sabinocanyon.com/\" title=\"\">sabinocanyon.com</a>) and the village of <strong>Summerhaven</strong> near the summit of Mount Lemmon in the Santa Catalina mountains; the cactus forests of the <strong>Saguaro national park</strong>; and the limestone caves at <strong>Kartchner Caverns state park</strong> (<a href=\"http://azstateparks.com/Parks/KACA/index.html\" title=\"\">azstateparks.com</a>). There are several campsites in the mountains, but the threat of rattlesnakes may make a lodge or ranch a more tempting option, such as the <strong>Lodge on the Desert</strong> (<a href=\"http://www.lodgeonthedesert.com\" title=\"\">lodgeonthedesert.com</a>, doubles from $179).</p> <h2>Great Barrington, Massachusetts</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397600503\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Late_offers/pictures/2012/10/11/1349967627110/Great-Barrington-Massachu-001.jpg\" alt=\"Great Barrington, Massachusetts\" width=\"460\" height=\"277\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Main Street in Great Barrington.

The recently restored <strong>Mahaiwe</strong> performing arts centre (<a href=\"http://www.mahaiwe.org/\" title=\"\">mahaiwe.org</a>) is a cultural focus for the whole south Berkshires, while the <strong>Guthrie Centre</strong> (<a href=\"https://guthriecenter.org\" title=\"\">guthriecenter.org</a>) hosts quirkier events, such as the Troubadour folk music series. Hermann Melville and Nathaniel Hawthorne picnicked on <strong>Monument mountain</strong> in 1850, and thousands now follow in their footsteps every year. There's a ski resort a couple of miles away (<a href=\"http://www.skibutternut.com/\" title=\"\">skibutternut.com</a>).

But the city is undergoing a resurgence at the moment, with an influx of young creative types and entrepreneurs attracted by low rents and subsidies. The new arrivals have revitalised the downtown district, where bars, restaurants and galleries have opened, and the riverside area is being developed.</p> <p>Detroit has been known for music for more than 100 years, from blues, gospel, jazz and Motown to hip-hop and techno \u2013 born here in the mid-late 1980s.

It is the foodie capital of the state, with a thrice-weekly farmers' market, five microbrewies, and one of the highest numbers of restaurants per capita in the US. The cuisine is seafood-heavy, with an abundance of lobster and clams. (Wood-oven roasted mussels are a speciality at <strong>Fore Street</strong>, <a href=\"http://www.forestreet.biz\" title=\"\">forestreet.biz</a>.) But the city is also great for vegetarians as well as being more ethnically diverse than other parts of Maine. The cobbled <strong>Old Port area</strong> and the downtown <strong>Arts&#xa0;District</strong> are the hippest places to hang out, both full of galleries, independent shops, restaurants and bars. There is a free self-guided walking tour of the best art venues on the first Friday of each month (<a href=\"http://www.firstfridayartwalk.com/\" title=\"\">firstfridayartwalk.com</a>). The north end of the 2,390-mile <strong>US Highway 1</strong> passes through Portland and makes a very scenic coastal drive. Lobster boats and ferries take passengers on tours of <strong>Casco Bay</strong>, and <strong>Old Orchard Beach</strong>, 19 miles to the south, is a charming resort town.

  "<p>\"The way I see it, the further north you go, the better it gets,\" the old timer tells us as we fill up with fuel at Grand Marais, an end-of-the-road town in northern Michigan, on the shore of Lake Superior. A brutal cold wind whips in off the lake, direct from the Canadian wilderness. Among the huddle of buildings is a small brewery and an outfitting store (We Welcome Hunters and Trappers). Further up, a clapboard house is, appropriately, called End of the Trail.</p> <p>We have driven more than 1,000 miles to get here, to the very edge of the US. To give our two-year-old daughter, Nell, the experience of being in the wilds, my husband and I have brought her on a road trip through Michigan, to its remote Upper Peninsula, on a route rated one of North America's best for autumn colour. We are in effect circumnavigating Lake Michigan, with a few detours.</p> <p>The name Michigan comes from the Native American word <em>michigama</em>, meaning great lake. With 3,288 miles of shoreline, Michigan has more coast than the US's entire eastern seaboard. Our journey takes us through scenic inland waterways, giant dunes, old-growth forests, and vast inland seas.</p> <p>With Chicago behind us, we head up the eastern shore of Lake Michigan in a rented motorhome, our passport to the wilds when travelling with a young child. We cover many miles in the first couple of days, cruising up Route 31. Beyond the highway and strip malls are small, genteel towns with immaculate harbours, catering for well-heeled tourists and second-home owners.</p> <p>In the warm autumn light we pass farmers' markets and fruit farms. In tented shelters by the road, trestle tables are piled high with wooden boxes of blueberries, apples and raspberries. Michigan is well-known as a fruit-growing state, and Traverse City is famed as the cherry capital of the US. The state is also home to around 100 vineyards and wineries, producing particularly good rieslings. We dine well as we travel north.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397644417\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Late_offers/pictures/2012/10/11/1349966873674/Kari-Herbert-and-Nell-at--001.jpg\" alt=\"Kari Herbert and Nell at Hurricane Bay\" width=\"460\" height=\"277\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kari with daughter Nell at Hurricane Bay</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>At night, we opt for rustic state forest campsites, often in areas of outstanding natural beauty. We cook over a fire, reading and talking by candlelight. In the darkness, we can see the glow of other campfires and hear nothing but the distant murmur of voices and the wind in the trees. We're alone, but with others nearby; there is comfort in these woods. In the mornings, Nell plays on the golden beaches by the clear waters of Lake Michigan, and dances through piles of leaves and pine cones in the forests.</p> <p>Our first major destination is Sleeping Bear Dunes national park, named after a Chippewa legend which tells how a forest fire on the lake's western shore drove a mother bear and her two cubs into the lake. After many miles of swimming, the mother bear reached safety and waited on a high bluff for her cubs to join her. Too tired to continue, the cubs drowned within sight of the shore. The great spirit Manitou created two islands to mark where the cubs disappeared and a solitary dune to represent the mother.</p> <p>Wind and erosion have greatly reduced the size of the \"bear\" over the years; nevertheless, this 35-mile stretch of towering dunes, forests and beaches is consistently voted as one of the most beautiful places in the US. We pay $10 to take the seven-mile Pierce Stocking scenic drive \u2013 a gentle loop through woodland with spectacular viewpoints over forests and lake.</p> <p>Down on the lakeshore the dune climb is also popular, particularly for kids. On top of the giant dune, we are 150m above the lake, which stretches almost 60 miles west towards Wisconsin, hidden by the curve of the Earth. We continue north, passing Traverse City and Elk Rapids and a sign announcing the 45th parallel \u2013 halfway between the equator and the North Pole. Cheered by this unexpected landmark, we pull over for a cup of tea and a slice of apple pie.</p> <p>Miles of blueberry and corn fields and acres of vines are punctuated by immaculate tall red barns and stands of pine, aspen and maple. Halloween is fast approaching. Pick-ups at roadside stalls are filled with pumpkins and dark-skinned gourds.</p> <p>The leaves are beginning to deepen: golds of the trembling aspen and white birch, burnished copper of white ash, and russets and deep blood-reds of sugar maple and black gum trees. We'd been told many times that the autumn colours get better the further north you go. This is true of many things in Michigan: fewer bugs, fewer tourists, cleaner air. We want to get to the wilds, to big country, to solitude.</p> <p>Ernest Hemingway figures large in this landscape. His lazy childhood days beside Walloon Lake and in the nearby streams and woods fundamentally influenced his writing. Many of his short stories were based here.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397644418\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Late_offers/pictures/2012/10/11/1349966820720/Lake-Superior-the-Shipwre-001.jpg\" alt=\"Lake Superior, the Shipwreck Coast.\" width=\"460\" height=\"277\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lake Superior, the Shipwreck Coast. Photograph: Getty Images</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>We take a short detour to Horton Bay on Lake Charlevoix, a favourite spot for those following a Hemingway trail. Beside the General Store is the Red Fox Inn, where Hemingway stayed as a young man, and whose owner, Vollie Fox, taught him to fish. Handpainted signs tell the story. The wonderful store, too, is full of memorabilia. The store owner, Chip Lorenger, spreads a well-used map on the bar and directs us to some of his favourite places.</p> <p>Taking his advice we head out on the backroads following a route taken by Hemingway and his first wife after their wedding in 1921. \"See all that,\" Hemingway told his bride. \"Talk about the beauty of the Bay of Naples! I've seen them both, and no place is more beautiful than Little Traverse in its autumn colours.\" We cannot help but agree as we swing round the bay and make our way on route 119 towards the great <a href=\"http://www.mackinacbridge.org/\" title=\"\">Mackinac Bridge</a>, gateway to the Upper Peninsula and roughly the halfway point of our journey. To mark this \u2013 and to enjoy a hot bath and good food \u2013 we leave the motorhome and catch a ferry to <a href=\"http://www.mackinacisland.org/\" title=\"\">Mackinac Island</a>.</p> <p>Cars are prohibited here, so residents and visitors use bicycles or horse-drawn carriages. It is a slightly unreal but enjoyable escape into nostalgia. Numerous fudge shops pump their sweet, chocolatey fumes into the street as day trippers pour off the ferry. We spend a night at the impressive Grand Hotel, built colonial-style in Michigan white pine. Opened in 1887, it is the grand dame of American hotels.</p> <p>Back on the mainland, we head towards the famed Tahquamenon Falls on the northern side of the peninsula, setting for Henry Wadsworth Longfellow's epic poem The Song of Hiawatha. At the village of Paradise we turn west and enter wilderness territory \u2013 1,000 square miles of old-growth forest. At its heart is the Tahquamenon, the \"dark river\" or \"golden river\" of the poem. The upper falls are the largest waterfall east of the Mississippi river, after Niagara.</p> <p>Snow is beginning to fall as we rent a small boat and row to the island between the five smaller cascades that form the Lower Falls. We have the place to ourselves. Chipmunks scurry across our path as we step over logs half-gnawed by beavers. We watch the play of colours across the falling water \u2013 the crimson, gold and russet forest framing the brown, churning torrents.</p> <p>The warmth of the previous week is gone. The thermometer has dropped by 20 degrees overnight. Days before, a man in flip-flops and T-shirt had said, \"Enjoying the weather, are ya? Make the most of it. Winter is coming.\"</p> <p>As the cold bites, we begin to see why many of the local residents head south, like birds, to warmer climes. Many places in the Upper Peninsula can expect between four and five metres of snow during the winter.</p> <p>We reach the far north of Michigan. At Muskallonge Lake state park the tarmac ends. On a rutted track we grope our way slowly along the shores of Lake Superior, as white-tailed deer cross our path. This is a seasonal route, accessible in winter only by snowmobile. It's dark by the time we arrive at the Hurricane River campsite. A sign pinned to the small registration hut warns of black bears. Our motorhome is shaken through the night by growling winds. We wake to find the skylights covered in snow and a carapace of ice.</p> <p>We are on the fringes of the 40-mile Pictured Rocks shoreline, a sandstone escarpment that runs from Laughing Whitefish Falls to Tahquamenon in the east. This dramatic exposure of rocks is Michigan's top tourist attraction \u2013 and best viewed from a boat on the water in milder weather.</p> <p>As the storm clouds pass, we walk to the shoreline and find one of the most beautiful, and the most treacherous, beaches I have ever seen. This northern shore of Michigan on Lake Superior is known as the Shipwreck Coast. Waves crash on the bone-white sand. We walk through spray towards the Au Sable lighthouse, our daughter gathering up sand-polished stones \u2013 agate, jasper, quartz, basalt and hematite \u2013 and rolling them into the surf.</p> <p>We can just spot the teeth of the infamous sandstone reef appearing through the waves. We weave our way along the beach and over jutting platforms of marbled rocks, to cut back on to the trail through fir and aspen.</p> <p>As we near the lighthouse, we begin to see the shipwrecks. Black ribs jut out of the sand, the remains of the hull of a boat. Farther on lies another nautical skeleton. There is beauty here, but desolation too, and we feel that particularly now, as winter approaches.</p> <p>We reach Au Sable Point and watch the darkening sky. We cannot go any farther north. This is the edge of the US, and the Canadian wilderness lies beyond these perilous waters. That will be another journey.</p> <p>It's often the road to nowhere that brings you to exactly the place you need to be. Many of the roads we have taken to get here were glorious. For the most part, the delight was in the driving: each turn of the road providing a different display of indescribable autumnal colour.</p> <p>We didn't know it when we started out, but this place is our turning point. With wind-stung cheeks, we sing our way back down the trail to ward off black bears. We have the storm at our backs and something of the wilderness in our hearts. This is what we came for.</p> <p>\u2022 <em>Kari Herbert's latest book is </em><a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Polar-Wives-Remarkable-Behind-Explorers/dp/192681262X/ref=sr_1_2?\" title=\"\"><em>Polar Wives: The remarkable women behind the world's most daring explorers</em></a><em> (Greystone \u00a310.79)</em></p>",
  "<p>This article is brought to you by the Rivera brothers. I say that because three of them, friends of mine, live in a mechanic's shop around Northside Village, Houston, Texas; and the key to a successful Texan road trip is to not consult or visit them, or even go near their street. Big characters, adventurous in business, dangerous at backgammon, generous with rum \u2013 but I never fully survived a drive that started at their place, or followed their directions.</p> <p>The first time I drove from their yard I was held overnight at the Mexican border post they recommended, where my residency was cancelled despite paying gratuities. That post phoned the next and I was detained there as well, my residency cancelled again, after paying gratuities the first post told the next I was good for. It all eventually led to me living and writing in Ireland, hence the boys' responsibility \u2013 plus here borders are open, and officers are content to just be smug.</p> <p>In the meantime, though, I roamed as a tourist over that border. The second time I left the Riveras, seeing that I was driving nearly seven litres of Americana, the boys loaned me a radar detector, which in the end only beeped after a sheriff's deputy reached the window to book me for speeding. Then I was busted for the detector as well. And still I returned \u2013 but by the third time I hit Rivera territory, I just parked the car in their yard and had them drive me to the airport after a fortnight of lending each other money and choosing who would make Leroy go for beer.</p> <p>A few months after I left, they sold the car.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397645344\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/pictures/2012/10/12/1350042131165/DBC-Pierre-on-the-road-001.jpg\" alt=\"DBC Pierre on the road\" width=\"460\" height=\"277\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">DBC Pierre on the road</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It's a long introduction, I know; but things are richer with context, and it lays a context for this: in the end I devised a road trip from Houston that avoids the Rivera brothers altogether. A weekender like a TV movie, where a girl slams a motel door, where pumpjacks and crickets compete in the night, where guitar players called Cletus drink rye. A ready-meal road trip that we can take today, a mixture of neon lights and nooks and crannies; because although the perfect drive is the one without a destination, if we're travelling from here we don't have the time to ask that many gas station attendants the way to the interstate. With these instructions, all the realities and hospitalities, the expected and unexpected beauty of central Texas can unfold without need of a map; we just have to get to Houston.</p> <p>Even without a destination, a good road trip will have a goal, however; and this, if not risky, should at least mess with temptation \u2013 chasing fruitless infatuations, gambling, escaping an abusive partner, or a suicide pact with a friend are all valid fuels for the road. For this starter road trip, the goal must be Texas barbecue: the best in the land, beef as soft as sashimi, served by the pound, on paper.</p> <p>For vegetarians there can be turkey and beans.</p> <p>To do it properly we need to rent a Dodge Charger, if not a small truck. It's not a long drive for a weekend, maybe an eight-hour round trip. If you draw the route on a map, you'll see it's a small triangle in south central Texas \u2013 but bear in mind that Texas is almost three times the size of the UK, plus any itinerary should have room to sit and hear the world creak in a breeze. As this page goes to press it's 28C in central Texas, and humid. Grackles chatter in trees.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397645345\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Late_offers/pictures/2012/10/11/1349958983798/Blacks-BBQ-001.jpg\" alt=\"Blacks BBQ\" width=\"460\" height=\"423\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Black's Barbecue in Lockhart, Texas.

Before setting the mirrors, tune the radio to 102.5FM, KMKS, a Bay City station with range. Leave the airport and turn right on to the Sam Houston Tollway, heading west to Interstate 10, the Katy Freeway. This junction is the closest we come to the Rivera brothers. Keep moving. If you're a ZZ Top fan, we pass the turn off to <a href=\"http://www.google.co.uk/imgres?um=1&amp;hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;sa=N&amp;biw=1380&amp;bih=871&amp;tbm=isch&amp;tbnid=s0Bb3slaKBUI0M:&amp;imgrefurl=http://www.musicchartheaven.com/ArtistsZ/zztopgreatest.htm&amp;docid=NEHZqyiBasGuqM&amp;imgurl=http://www.musicchartheaven.com/ArtistsZ/zzlagrange.jpg&amp;w=754&amp;h=743&amp;ei=JVN1ULzZAaHU0QXUo4GoBw&amp;zoom=1&amp;iact=hc&amp;vpx=185&amp;vpy=144&amp;dur=1226&amp;hovh=223&amp;hovw=226&amp;tx=137&amp;ty=110&amp;sig=103750408551928658366&amp;page=1&amp;tbnh=153&amp;tbnw=155&amp;start=0&amp;ndsp=24&amp;ved=1t:429,r:0,s:0,i:71\" title=\"\">La Grange</a>, and can detour and pose at the road sign. If not then, two-and-a-bit hours west along I-10, keep an eye out for signs to Luling and Lockhart.</p> <p>For these two-and-a-bit hours a local might say there's not much to see \u2013 but it's a good time to reflect on how hard it is to imagine John Wayne riding through these subtropics; and to calculate that there are 254 counties in Texas, a mixture of wet, dry, and moist counties, alcoholic beverage-wise. Moist counties are wet and dry depending when and where you are.</p> <p>Take a right into Luling on 183, cross the railway lines, and across the road to the left (633 East Davis Street) sits City Market \u2013 the holy grail of beef brisket. If it's before six in the evening, go in for a pound in butcher's paper, with a jalape\u00f1o, some potato salad, bread or beans. After six, mark the spot to return for breakfast or lunch. Note the heavy smell in the air around here \u2013 crude oil. This is a town where oil pumpjacks spring out of backyards and roadsides, many decorated, turned into moving characters, cowboys, grasshoppers, girls, planes.</p> <p>Drive a few miles up 183, watching out for skunks if it's dark \u2013 hit one and never smell the same again \u2013 and just before Lockhart, the Plum Creek Inn (<a href=\"http://www.plumcreekinn.net/\" title=\"\">plumcreekinn.net</a>), our motel, appears on the left. What can we say, a motel \u2013 big rooms, a swimming pool, air conditioners, no Laura Ashley. In the movie of your life a girl slams a door. Maybe some neon fizzes and crackles. Critters make noise in the grass.</p> <p>From here it's a quick drive to the old town centre of Lockhart \u2013 mecca of barbecue, and somewhere small to wander and soak up. Find North Main Street, at the far side of the courthouse square, and stroll north to Lilly's at number 110, a beer shop and pool joint \u2013 practise your Spanish, one of those nice ladies is Lilly \u2013 or walk on one block to Black's Barbecue (<a href=\"http://www.blacksbbq.com\" title=\"\">blacksbbq.com</a>) the oldest continuously owned barbecue restaurant in Texas.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397645346\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Late_offers/pictures/2012/10/11/1349958911674/San-Antonio-riverfront-001.jpg\" alt=\"San Antonio riverfront\" width=\"460\" height=\"277\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The San Antonio Paseo del Rio river walk, Photograph: Alamy</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>And after collapsing to late-night TV \u2013 maybe something with a motel in it \u2013 there's only one way to spend Saturday if the car is pointed up highway 183: follow it a while more to Austin, through Mustang Ridge and past Bergstrom Airport, veering left down East 7th Street to East 6th Street. This is the home of live music in the south, a mellow chaos of blues, rock and country. Get lit up at Shakespeare's Pub (<a href=\"http://www.shakespearesaustin.com/main.html\" title=\"\">shakespearesaustin.com</a>) then trawl the street for the bands that most pull you in.</p> <p>To recover on Sunday, with our mayhem all rinsed out, a long drive down Interstate 35 to San Antonio is the key \u2013 for my money San Antone is one of the three most beautiful cities in the US. Hang out by the river, visit the Alamo, eat an enchilada and ponder \u2013 this is where Mexico lost its northern state of Texas in battle.</p> <p>Then, driving down I-10 back to Houston, reflect: the Rivera boys are still levelling the score.</p> <p>\u2022 <em>DBC Pierre's first novel </em><a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9780571215164\" title=\"\"><em>Vernon God Little</em></a><em>, set in Texas, won the Man Booker Prize in 2003</em></p>",

  "<p>It's 131 years since the gunfight at the O.K. Corral but Tombstone is still milking that most famous of western shootouts \u2013 between the Earps and the Clantons \u2013 for every cent. And the latest piece of Earpsploitation is Virgil's Corner. Now a boutique B&amp;B, it was once the home of Virgil Earp. Virgil was the kingpin of the Earp family. When things reached a head with the Clanton gang, he deputised his younger brother Wyatt and his friend \"Doc\" Holliday to help him sort things out. We have heard of Wyatt because, unlike his brothers, he lived to a ripe old age, long enough to spin the tale.</p> <p>Virgil was senior lawman in Tombstone and built a house a couple of blocks from the O.K. Corral in 1880. The More family took on the house in 1969 \u2013 but it was badly damaged by fire in 1998. Timbers that survived, including original doors, had been put into storage.

Last Christmas one of their organisers asked a child what he wanted for Christmas only to be told that he wanted a blanket to keep out of the cold.</p> <p>\"We never finished the war on poverty that was started in the 1960s\", said Hart as she describes how the organisation operates in half the counties of West Virginia. In some, the run-down coal towns of the south, median incomes are $16,000, barely a third of the US average. Hart says the real unemployment rate is well above 20%.</p> <p>Asked how West Virginia has coped with the recession, she replied: \"There wasn't much here to start with and it's getting worse.\"</p> <p>Poverty and inequality were supposed to big issues in this year's campaign. The growing gulf between rich and poor became a hot issue in 2011 as a result of the Occupy Wall Street protests, and the latest official figures show things getting worse, not better. Of the 34 rich-country members of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, only Chile, Mexico and Turkey are more unequal.</p> <p>But for all president Barack Obama's rhetoric over taxing the 1% or the brief firestorm that followed the disparaging remarks Mitt Romney made about the 47% he claimed \"pay no income tax\", many feel the plight of America's poor is being ignored.</p> <p>Martin Gilens, politics professor at Princeton university, said: \"Both parties are highly dependent on affluent donors to fund their campaigns. Neither party has seen it as a particularly advantageous issue to push. That's why inequality has pretty much never been an issue either the Democrats or the Republicans has embraced in this country.\"</p> <p>The share of national income of the richest 1% more than doubled between 1980 and 2008, from 8% to 18%. They make an average of $1.3m in after-tax income, while the poorest 20% take home $17,700.</p> <p>Richard Freeman, economics professor at Harvard, said: \"It's clearly a problem. Even conservatives would see that if the trend were to continue it would be devastating. Imagine the trend going on for another decade or two. Most people would say that would be dangerous\".</p> <p>Already, the risks to the American economy have become apparent. Stagnating real incomes in the three decades leading up to the financial crash of 2007 left many US citizens increasingly hooked on debt. Robert Frank, economics professor at Cornell university says American corporations have forgotten Henry Ford's insight: workers need to be paid wages high enough for them to buy the goods they are producing.</p> <p>West Virginia, the US's second poorest state after Mississippi, has always struggled. The coal mining industry has slashed jobs as it has gone high tech, the steel industry is gone and its mountainous terrain presents physical obstacles to doing business. But in this recession it has been hit yet again.</p> <p>While Romney pledges to cut entitlements, people on a minimum wage of $7.65 an hour struggle to meet even their most basic needs. At the Bread Basket, a drop-off point for Appalachian Outreach in Ritchie County, people line up for food parcels. Grits, dried pasta, tinned food, basic necessities for those whose money runs out at the end of the month.</p> <p>Annie Owens has been organising the drop-off for 28 years and says now is the worst time she can remember. She has had to restrict the handout to the elderly and disabled in order to cope with the demand, \"People put their pride aside and come and get it\", she said.</p> <p>One of those collecting a food parcel, pensioner Barbara Smith, said: \"It's important to us. It helps us go from month to month. You have to make up your mind whether it's your medicine or your food\".</p> <p>Asked whether poverty was an issue in the election for America's politicians, Owens was emphatic. \"This is not an issue for them. If we tell them this is going on they don't believe us. They think we are hillbillies, that this is our choice, that this is the way we want to live. But often it's not choice, it's not the way people want to live our lives. They forget about the small people.\"</p> <p>For some life is getting better. Fracking, the controversial method for producing natural gas, is creating jobs. Pipelines too are being built across the mountainous terrain. There are jobs blowing the tops off mountains for coal. But the majority of these jobs are short term, low paid and benefit free. Once the job is done, there is nothing to fall back on.</p> <p>Hart worries about the environmental impact of allowing energy firms to rip up West Virginia's stunning landscape. \"What do you do for tourism when you blow up a mountain top? People want jobs and there's nothing else,\" she said.</p> <p>Freeman, Gilens and Frank said there were policies that could help: full employment, changes to the tax code to make it more progressive; much greater investment in education; reform of campaign financing to break the stranglehold of rich donors.</p> <p>Obama's healthcare reform apart, there has been little evidence that America's political class is interested in this sort of agenda. Hart said she raised the plight of the people she helps with congressman David McKinley, a West Virginia Republican.</p> <p>She said his response was to say they should get a job. \"He is totally clueless,\" she said.</p>",
  "<p>In the carpeted halls of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/conservative-conference-2012\" title=\"\">Tory party conference</a>, a place that smelt of exhausted sandwiches and spoke only to itself, the Tory problem with women was explicit. They were there, it is true, in small numbers and bright colours, so the photographers could find them without recourse to maps or shovels. Samantha Cameron mounted the stage after her husband's speech for a chaste kiss, eerily channelling <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Girl_with_a_Pearl_Earring\" title=\"\">Vermeer's Girl with a Pearl Earring</a>, and a swift circular belly rub \u2013 the gruesome fecundity shot, I call it.</p> <p>Young women drifted around, subject to the sexual politics of 1952, prodded, patronised and invited to sweaty suites for private \"briefings\". Otherwise, nothing of value to women was offered, unless you count some pre-conference rhetoric about <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/07/tory-abortion-call-reignites-debate\" title=\"\">abortion being awful</a>, which I don't think will swing anything outside of Kansas. The re-election strategy is out \u2013 Tories are staking everything on an economic revival and&#xa0;Ed Miliband's face.</p> <p>That it is possible to go for re-election without a nod toward the concerns of an entire gender seems mad, but they do it with a kind of wonky pride. I am sure that clever Tories know they cannot win an election without women; their pollsters will have told them so. If only men voted, Labour would have been in government continuously since 1945: it is the Scottish independence effect, in reverse. Tony Blair swept in on female smiles and <a href=\"http://www.ipsos-mori.com/researchpublications/researcharchive/2867/Conservative-support-among-women.aspx\" title=\"\">David Cameron himself took 36% of the female vote in 2010</a>. In September, <a href=\"http://www.standard.co.uk/news/politics/david-cameron-pays-the-price-for-calm-down-dear-jibe-as-women-shun-tories-8163210.html\" title=\"\">31% of women were pleased with the prime minister's performance compared to 38% of men</a>, a number to make him glow red, or white, or both. So&#xa0;this blitheness is astonishing and foolhardy, a gift to Miliband.</p> <p>You see the contempt on the edges, when the mask falls off. See the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/sep/24/andrew-mitchell-profile-thrasher-rugby\" title=\"\">parable of Andrew \"Thrasher\" Mitchell </a>and how the insult \"pleb\" can easily be translated into \"having no money\", having no money being the quickest route to this government's disgust. (By far the greatest cheer at conference was for lower taxes \u2013 poor BoJo, outclassed by a beautiful tax dream.) The <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-12271765\" title=\"\">Tory MP Dominic Raab wrote of \"flagrant discrimination</a> \u2026 against men\", a conclusion so lacking in supporting evidence, I wonder his loved ones didn't try to stop him publishing.</p> <p>The Tory minister <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/8510548/Conservative-minister-writes-to-Labour-MP-to-apologise-for-asking-why-she-was-in-a-Commons-lift.html\" title=\"\">Andrew Robathan&#xa0;tried to throw the Labour MP&#xa0;Stella Creasy</a> out of an MPs' lift, because the idea that a 35-year-old (blonde) woman could be an MP is obviously rather strange to him.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2011/apr/27/david-cameron-calm-down-dear\" title=\"\">Cameron's \"Calm down, dear\" to the Labour MP Angela Eagle </a>was fascinating, because only a misogynist would think to say it, or his other taunt, \"<a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-14834867\" title=\"\">frustrated\", to the Tory backbencher Nadine Dorries</a>, which is of course a bored euphemism for \"sexless\". This is the cheap dialogue of a one-dimensional Mills &amp; Boon hero circa 1977 \u2013 Doctor in the House? Or something in breeches? He apologised, in a glib emotional fashion, via a properly vetted journalist, but the damage was done. Women equal (ha!) furious, excitable and so on.</p> <p>While this is annoying, no woman was ever plunged into poverty by being told to calm down: this is merely the rhetoric that exposes the probability. But there is also the woeful under-representation of females in cabinet and government. Despite <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/the-womens-blog-with-jane-martinson/2012/sep/03/what-women-want-from-the-reshuffle\" title=\"\">Cameron's 2009 pledge to stick females in a third of government posts</a>, we are <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2012/mar/07/women-representation-in-politics-worldwide\" title=\"\">53rd in the world for female representation, behind Iraq and, weirdly, Afghanistan</a>. Female ministers do not always equal female policies, it is true, and this party has a whole clutch of quasi-\"blue\" feminists, who like the word but misunderstand its meaning, although they do get very agitated about porn. But their promotion at least implies the leader cares how&#xa0;he is perceived. With the <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/9519832/Fears-that-Cameron-ignored-women-in-Cabinet-reshuffle.html\" title=\"\">demotion of Baroness Warsi, Caroline Spelman and Cheryl Gillan</a>, Cameron threw off even that.</p> <p>For the real calamity, we have policy. The cuts, as I tire of typing, are hitting women disproportionately, because women work in the public sector in greater numbers, and there are more female carers, by an insane margin. Of&#xa0;the \u00a314.9bn in cuts already being made, three quarters are at the expense of women. Female unemployment was&#xa0;1.1&#xa0;million in September, and of every 10 jobs lost in the last quarter to March, <a href=\"http://fawcettsociety.org.uk/index.asp?PageID=1266\" title=\"\">eight were lost by women</a>. Women are leaving the workforce and we cannot know if they will return, or live off welfare, or off men, with all the angst that brings. Not all unemployed women lead the oblivious lives of Tory wives \u2013 there will be poverty.</p> <p>There is worse to come. The chancellor is advised on employment matters by the Tory donor and hedge-funder Adrian Beecroft, who owns a chunk of Wonga, the payday loans company expanding due to some of the weakest regulations in western Europe. Asking Beecroft to advise on employment strategy may seem cartoonishly awful, but this is the party that asked the head of Unilever, maker of Carte D'Or ice-cream of all things, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/mar/02/sugar-addiction-children-big-food-fat\" title=\"\">to chair its public health commission</a>, so we should&#xa0;not be too surprised.</p> <p>The chancellor <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/oct/08/george-osborne-shares-rights-scheme\" title=\"\">announced a new barrage of measures</a> at conference that&#xa0;make it practically easier to fire women, and harder for them to complain.

  "<p>Turkey has scrambled fighter jets to its border with Syria for the first time since warning its southern neighbour that fast escalating tensions between the two former allies could lead to war.</p> <p>Officials in Ankara said on Friday the jets were deployed in response to the presence of a Syrian helicopter firing near the town of Azmarin, about 8km from Turkey's south-west border. The town has seen intense fighting between regime forces and rebels since Monday.</p> <p>The Turkish jets fired no shots, but their response to a Syrian aircraft flying close to the frontier is being interpreted as a sign that prime minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan may be prepared to enforce a de facto no-fly zone inside Syrian airspace.</p> <p>Officials told Turkish media last week that Syria had agreed to keep its forces up to 10km (6.2 miles) from the restive 900km-long border with Turkey. Damascus did not respond to the claim, which came after Ankara won parliamentary approval to enter Syrian territory on hit and run missions, following the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/03/turkey-syrian-mortar-bomb\" title=\"\">shelling of the Turkish town</a> Ak\u00e7akale, which killed five civilians.</p> <p>The cross-border shellfire that led to Turkey's dramatic move continued for at least six days after the law was passed, stirring already incendiary tensions and casting doubt on the Turkish claim of a deal, which if true would mark a significant moment in the Syrian civil war.</p> <p>The Syrian air force has been increasingly deployed over the country's towns and cities since July and has been a formidable foe for opposition groups with limited means to down regime jets and helicopters.</p> <p>Although several of each have been shot down with anti-aircraft cannons, rebels have taken to attacking airbases. One such attack on the Taaneh base east of Aleppo late on Thursday is believed to have left the giant airfield in rebel hands.</p> <p>Claims of the base's capture were supported by videos posted online, which showed large missiles and several aircraft as uniformed rebels moved among them. Eyewitness accounts of Syrian jets bombing weapons depots within the airfield's boundaries also supported the rebel claims to have taken the base. The bombing seemed to be aimed at preventing planes and weapons from falling into opposition hands.</p> <p>Opposition groups in Idlib have also attacked airbases, with a confirmed raid on one airfield in September destroying five helicopters and damaging several more.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Turkish officials suggested that a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2012/oct/11/syrian-passenger-plane-turkey-video?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">Syrian commercial airliner intercepted by the Turkish air force</a> on Wednesday was carrying components for weapons systems sent by Russia. The plane and its passengers, which took off from Moscow, were allowed to continue to Damascus after being grounded at Esenboga airport, Ankara, for several hours. The incident continued to draw fierce criticism from Moscow, which has denied sending a cargo of weapons or ammunition, and from Damascus, which accused the Turks of air piracy.</p> <p>The flight engineer of the plane told Syrian media on Friday that he and other officers were <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2012/oct/12/syrian-air-turkish-video\" title=\"\">handcuffed by Turkish officials as the plane was searched</a>. As the civil war has escalated over the past year, Turkey has also twice brought to ground Iranian planes flying over its airspace that it suspected of carrying weapons to Damascus. Both groundings drew similar protests from Tehran.</p> <p>In the wake of the tensions, on Thursday Turkey said it had banned its carriers from travelling over Syrian airspace.</p>",
  "<p>A giant eyeball discovered washed up on the shores of Florida has created an internet buzz and left marine biologists pondering its likely owner.</p> <p>The blue, softball-sized body part was stumbled upon Wednesday by beachcomber Gino Covacci as he walked through the surf at Pompano Beach. Having kicked the object over, he found himself staring into the large lens of an as-yet-to-be identified sea creature.</p> <p>\"It was very, very fresh,\" he told Florida newspaper the Sun Sentinel, adding: \"It was still bleeding when I put it in the plastic bag.\"</p> <p>Experts put the eyeball on ice, ahead of preservation in a formaldehyde. It has since been sent to the Florida Fish and Wildlife Research Institute in St Petersburg. Marine biologists are now attempting to discover the derivation of the dislodged eyeball.</p> <p>On Friday, an assistant biology professor at Florida International University in Miami said the eyeball could have come from a deep-sea squid or a large swordfish.</p> <p>Heather Bracken-Grissom said she had started discussing the eyeball with her colleagues as soon as they saw the pictures on the internet. She added that the lens and pupil are similar to the shape of a deep-sea squid's eye.</p> <p>Bracken-Grissom also noted that a squid's eyes can be as large as soccer balls, and that they can be easily dislodged.</p>",
  "<p>Government scientists have definitively linked a new oil slick in the Gulf of Mexico to the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2010/sep/09/bp-oil-spill-deepwater-horizon-timeline\" title=\"\">BP oil spill disaster of 2010</a>.</p> <p>A senior government scientist said the most likely source of the new oil is the mile-long length of pipe from the Deepwater Horizon rig, now lying in a crumpled loop on the ocean floor.</p> <p>At worst, he said, the pipe was thought to contain some 1,800 barrels of oil \u2013 a minuscule amount compared with the 4.9m barrels that gushed into the ocean from BP's well during the 2010 oil disaster.</p> <p>\"When you look at all those pieces of information and put them together there is a high degree of confidence that the oil we are seeing and the sheening on the surface is coming from the riser, and that this is residual oil,\" said Frank Csulak, who is the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's scientific co-ordinator for the Deepwater Horizon disaster site.</p> <p>BP said in a statement to reporters that its tests confirmed the oil was from the riser, and that samples contained compounds found in drilling mud.</p> <p>BP spokesman Brett Clanton said: \"The size of the sheen, its persistent point of origin and other factors indicate the most likely source is the bent riser pipe that once connected the rig to the well head, where a mix of oil, drilling mud and sea water were trapped after the top kill operation.</p> <p>\"It's very reasonable and logical to conclude that maybe a little crack formed in one of the creases, in one of the bends, and that is where the oil is leaking out of.\"</p> <p>BP and Transocean, which were partners on Deepwater Horizon, have until Friday afternoon to submit a clean-up plan for the site.</p> <p>The sheen, only microns thick, varies in size. Earlier this week it extended for three miles near the site of the doomed well, about 50 miles off the shore of Louisiana.</p> <p>The United States Coast Guard said in a statement on Wednesday night that lab tests, performed at a government facility in Connecticut, had matched oil from the slick to the Deepwater Horizon.</p> <p>Oil sheens are pretty common in the Gulf of Mexico, where there are tens of thousands of idled offshore wells \u2013 many of which were abandoned without being completely sealed off.</p> <p>But the size and persistence of the sheen near the BP disaster site, first detected by satellite images on 9 September, prompted further investigation.</p> <p>The Coast Guard in its statement said it was still investigating the source of the new oil. \"The exact source of the oil is unclear at this time but [it] could be residual oil associated with the wreckage or debris left on the seabed from the Deepwater Horizon incident.\"</p> <p>Other government officials, <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/bp-scientists-believe-recent-gulf-oil-sheen-coming-from-2010-wreckage-not-capped-well/2012/10/11/55516574-13e7-11e2-9a39-1f5a7f6fe945_story.html\" title=\"\">speaking to the Washington Post</a>, have said it is unlikely that oil could be leaking again from the original well head. Engineers poured thick plugs of cement into both ends of the well to finally cap it last July 2010, and officials said a new breach was very unlikely. \"With what we did to it it's pretty hard to imagine,\" Marcia McNutt, who heads the US Geological Survey, told the Post.</p> <p>A more detailed chemical analysis also ruled out a natural seep from the well reservoir. Csulak said researchers discovered the presence of drilling mud, which had been in the riser.</p> <p>However, he appeared to downplay concerns about more oil entering the Gulf. The sheen, at this point, is not recoverable, Csulak said. \"We don't feel that is causing an environmental impact. It's not going to reach the shore-line,\" he said.</p>",
  "<p>Ralf R\u00fcller wanted to create a sacred ground for coffee connoisseurs in the heart of Berlin, somewhere devotees of the bean could sip their brews free from distraction.</p> <p>This purist \u2013 not to say militant \u2013 approach to coffee-drinking extended to a long list of rules at his brew bar, the Barn Roastery, including a ban on extra milk, spoons, laptops, dogs, mobile phone ringtones, loud phone calls and \"media\" (apart from newspapers). Sugar is strongly discouraged. But the rule that has provoked the most heated reaction is R\u00fcller's decision to prohibit pushchairs and prams.</p> <p>\"Coffee Nazis, choke on this swill\" and \"totalitarian coffee regime\" are just two of the many messages of protest R\u00fcller received after he installed a stone bollard \u2013 complete with a picture of a pram with a red line through it \u2013 in the doorway of his coffeehouse in the northern Berlin district of Prenzlauer Berg. (The bollard is moved for wheelchairs.)</p> <p>Marianne Burket-Eulitz, a family policy expert for the Green party, called R\u00fcller's attempts to keep prams out \"a socially incorrect affront to families\".</p> <p>But the former actor-turned-barista is unapologetic, upset only that his brews \u2013 which are prepared with the delicacy and attention worthy of a Japanese tea ceremony \u2013 are not receiving the attention he believes they deserve.</p> <p>\"People should listen to their senses when they drink a cup of coffee. Just as we take care of the coffee bean from crop to cup, we also take care of the people who come in here to drink it,\" he argues, pointing to customers chatting, reading newspapers or gazing at the goings-on on the bustling Sch\u00f6nhauser Allee.</p> <p>R\u00fcller's young team demonstrate the brewing process to customers, measuring temperatures, weights, checking aromas, \"taming\" froth, and timing to a second the silky brown creations magicked out of vacuum presses and syphons.</p> <p>The staff, who come from as far afield as Australia and Mexico, include Rob MacDonald, a dairy farmer from Australia who claims his tastebuds are so refined he can tell what a cow has eaten from the flavour of its milk. \"I love this artistic approach to coffee,\" says the 27-year-old, who as well as training to be a barista is \u2013 perhaps inevitably \u2013 learning to play the jazz xylophone.</p> <p>R\u00fcller's buggy ban comes amid an increasingly bitter turf war between two groups of locals. Prenzlauer Berg is famous for its high concentration of young families but over the past few years, tensions have mounted between these younger incomers and older, often poorer, long-term residents \u2013 many of whom feel squeezed out of the now gentrified district, which once lay ignored and crumbling in the communist east of the city.</p> <p>Ill-feeling has shown itself in a string of incidents including arson attacks on pushchairs and an anonymous campaign of stickers and posters depicting babies with red lines through them. R\u00fcller says he is caught in the middle. \"I never meant to get involved in the social politics when I opened my coffee bar. I'm certainly not '<em>kinderfeindlich</em>' [against children],\" he insists. \"This isn't about discrimination, it's about specialisation \u2013 the only way for me to survive as a small entrepreneur against big coffee chains, whose margins are much higher, is to narrow what we do and do it better.\"</p> <p>That includes such time-intensive procedures as grinding fresh coffee for each cup, measuring the brewing ratio of water to coffee, pressure profiling, and purifying the water. He holds public \"cuppings\" (tastings) once a week. He has also signed an agreement with his bean supplier, Square Mile of London, \"that I will never serve a mediocre cup of coffee\".</p> <p>He is the first to call himself a geek, and takes comfort from the fact that support for his coffee shrine has been just as strong as the opposition. \"Good move, dude! You're setting an example that hopefully will be followed by many before long. Moreover, I've never met a toddler who liked coffee anyway,\" wrote one fan on The Barn's Facebook page.</p> <p>Some young mothers have also expressed their appreciation at his pushchair ban. \"There's space enough here to fit in 20 prams,\" says Anne Rech, 36, a sales manager watching her cup of washed El-Salvador Kilimanjaro being carefully prepared while, strapped to her in a carrier, her nine-month-old daughter, Philippa, gurgles quietly. \"But why should they? There are plenty of dedicated <em>kinder</em> cafes people can go to if they want their kids to run around.</p> <p>\"German coffee can be horrible, so the more places dedicated to improving coffee that open up, the better.\"</p> <p>Before moving back to Berlin several years ago, R\u00fcller worked as an actor in London where he often played Nazi soldiers in British TV war dramas. He says it feels as if he has been cast as the Nazi in his own coffeehouse drama.</p> <p>Though initially hurt by attempts on Twitter and Facebook to label him the \"Soup Nazi\" \u2013 a reference to the infamous soup-stand owner in the US sitcom Seinfeld who demands of his patrons that they abide by a strict set of rules, he laughs as he suggests the comparison is not so far off the mark. \"Like him, I'm incredibly proud of my product and want people to respect it,\" he says.</p>",
  "<p>Is it right of the Nobel committee <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/oct/12/european-union-nobel-peace-prize\" title=\"\">to award this year's peace prize</a> to the European Union at a time when the EU is facing the gravest existential crisis of its 55-year history, and when the continent's elected leaders have repeatedly failed to resolve an economic conundrum which is largely of its own devising? No, I don't think it is.</p> <p>It smacks of bad timing, just as the committee's award of the same prize to Barack Obama in 2009 \u2013 when he'd barely sat down in the Oval Office \u2013 was toe-curlingly premature. It damaged the new president's standing at home (where plenty of US voters mistrust do-gooding foreigners) and was deemed sufficiently misjudged to make Obama stay away from Oslo award ceremony. Smart man, given that <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/datablog/2011/oct/07/nobel-peace-prize-winners-list-2011\" title=\"\">the winners list contained some failures and a few rascals</a>.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/oct/12/nobel-peace-prize-2012-live#block-5077e26e58f91d7bbadac413\" title=\"\">Early reactions to the 2012 award</a> suggest puzzlement. Why now when the protracted eurozone crisis staggers on? Why not earlier, for instance after the successful enlargement into the former Soviet bloc in the years after the Berlin Wall collapsed and the old Soviet Union imploded? Why not later, when the EU has triumphed over its financial problems?</p> <p>The puzzlement is offset by the delighted noises coming out of Brussels and other major capitals. Did I just hear Italy's Romano Prodi on the BBC saying Europe is more united than at any time since the Roman empire (collapsed 476 AD) and still in need of \"more and more unity\". That sort of response tips my own reaction towards what Lord David Owen is calling \"churlish\".</p> <p>He should talk. He's been pretty churlish towards the EU's record in recent decades, since he swung from ardent enthusiasm towards a more agnostic (and healthy) attitude. The trouble with Brussels is that, unlike some brave and persistent local hero in a world trouble spot - Northern Ireland has had several worthy winners - it doesn't need morale-boosting pats on the back. It's quite good at doing that without any outside help. Too good in fact.</p> <p>Clearly the citation suggests that the award is meant to encourage EU leaders to press forward with the project as well as to recognise \u2013 rather belatedly \u2013 that it has helped keep the peace in Europe since 1945. Eurosceptics often appear to forget this, pocketing the gains without much acknowledgement while quibbling about the price of vegetables. War was very terrible twice in the Europe of the 20th century and nearly destroyed it. Perhaps with hindsight we may say it did.</p> <p>But Nato played at least as big a part and did so sooner at crucial junctures, not least in expanding into the former Soviet bloc after 1989 and in being more effective in the former Yugoslavia of the 1990s. The fact that the US was the dominant player and the Russians the clear and present danger made it easier for Nato to be more decisive and dynamic.</p> <p>Germany's abject rejection of military force as its main instrument of foreign policy after 200 years of Prussian-led expansionism was also pretty important. If awards are to go to institutions, then both Germany and Nato deserve consideration. Silly you may feel? Well, yes indeed. How about the World Health Organisation or the UN Refugee Agency team? The Red Cross won the award in both world wars.</p> <p>The trouble with today's timing is that it may encourage renewed complacency of the kind that has marked the protracted eurozone crisis since it started in 2007 and became lethal when the Bush White House allowed Lehman Brothers to fail the following year. The EU blamed Anglo-Saxon market capitalism for the crisis, as if the structure of the eurozone itself was not as defective as anything done by London, New York or Washington.</p> <p>More lethal still, the euro's weakness \u2013 reckless, under-priced lending to peripheral economies (Greece, Portugal, Ireland etc) which were likely to blow up - has proved much harder to remedy. The major players have usually done too little and too late to impress markets and ratings agencies which have gone from their own complacent assessments to neurosis.</p> <p>They did it and it's still not clear if they can put it right as the European Central Bank (ECB) struggles to overcome German reluctance to letting it become a real central bank and do whatever it deems necessary to restore confidence and growth.</p> <p>\"We don't want to underwrite Greek debt,\" say the Germans.</p> <p>\"But you did when you agreed to let them enter your currency union,\" comes the reply. \"You were a pay-day loan operator, Wonga to the poor.\"</p> <p>The outcome is pressure to create a trans-eurozone banking union and - who knows \u2013 an EU finance ministry with real teeth, and to do so at breakneck speed. The austerity imposed on Greece and other stricken states is creating a backlash in the name of democratic accountability, the resurgence of the very nationalism the EU was created back in 1957 to quell for ever.</p> <p>It looks ugly and could easily become uglier. If it is averted it will be via a German-dominated core Europe, the kind of outcome which Britain has struggled for centuries \u2013 against France, Spain, Russia and Germany itself \u2013 to prevent. The future is clouded. Yet the word from Oslo \u2013 and from Brussels \u2013 is that another Franco-German war is unthinkable. Let us fervently hope they are all right.</p> <p>But nothing is unthinkable.</p>",
  "<p>\"Super-selectivity\" is the kind of concocted word beloved of politicians and policy wonks. I hadn't heard it until a couple of weeks ago when Rob Whiteman, chief executive of the UK Border Agency (UKBA), used it to describe the government's immigration policy at the <a href=\"http://www.detentionadvice.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Detention Advice Service</a>'s 20th anniversary conference.</p> <p>Whiteman argued that, within this newly labelled policy, foreign national prisoners were regarded as a specific category of people who really, really should be deported \u2013 presumably, super-super-selectivity. He was referencing a speech earlier this year by then immigration minister Damian Greene to the Conservative think-tank Policy Exchange when the minister talked of super-selectivity or (in the alternative) \"double-plus selectivity\" (yes, <a href=\"http://www.migrantsrights.org.uk/blog/2012/02/mr-green-s-speech-points-double-plus-selectivity\" title=\"\">seriously</a>).</p> <p>In the context of the 10,861 foreign nationals in our prisons, \"super-selectivity\" means one thing: \"you're not staying here\". Such blanket judgments \u2013 treating a class of people as \"a homogenous mass\" as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/julietlyon\" title=\"\">Juliet Lyon</a>, director of the Prison Reform Trust, neatly put it at the conference \u2013 need to be challenged.</p> <p>The notion that the European Convention on Human Rights is routinely abused in defence of foreign nationals also needs to be challenged. \"It's shameful that child killers and rapists can abuse human rights laws to escape deportation,\" <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/immigration/9566479/177-foreign-criminals-avoid-deportation-on-family-rights-grounds.html\" title=\"\">said Charlie Elphicke</a>, the Conservative MP for Dover &amp; Deal recently. \"What about the right to family life of the families they have destroyed?\"</p> <p>Foreign national prisoners achieved <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/libertycentral/2012/apr/21/foreign-national-prisoners-new-pariahs\" title=\"\">pariah status</a> following the \"crisis of 2006 when it was revealed that more than 1,013 were released without being considered for deportation \u2013 an issue so toxic that it led to the swift departure of Charles Clark as home secretary.</p> <p>According to the Prison Reform Trust, foreign national prisoners in UK prisons come from 156 countries and over half are from 10 (Jamaica, Poland, Ireland, Nigeria, Pakistan, Romania, Lithuania, India, Vietnam and Somalia). They aren't all child killers and rapists, nor are all of them violent \u2013 46% of foreign national women are inside for drug offences (compared to 21% of British nationals) and 16% for fraud and forgery offences. According to the female prison welfare project Hibiscus, half of foreign national women have children under the age of 18.</p> <p>The total number of foreign nationals in our prison nearly doubled between 2000 and 2010 \u2014 compared to a 20% increase in British nationals. In 2009, some 11,268 untried foreign nationals went into custody \u2013 that's a staggering 136% increase since 1999 (by contrast there has been a 28% decrease in terms of untried receptions of British nationals).</p> <p>Foreign prisoners are also treated differently \u2013 or at least strongly feel that they are. At the DAS conference, Martin Kettle, policy lead on foreign national prisoners at the HM Inspectorate of Prisons, went through the results of a survey of 5,352 British national and 750 foreign national prisoners on perceptions of life in prisons. Apparently, 81% of British national prisoners knew where they were going when they were coming to a prison compared to 66% of foreign nationals; 75% of British nationals felt safe on their first night compared to 69% of foreign nationals; and 17% of British nationals as against 22% of foreign nationals felt unsafe at that point in time.</p> <p>Kettle spoke of the 'damage of uncertainty': \"If you walk into an immigration removal centre you can feel it in the air.\"</p> <p>The immigration regime was tightened in July specifically to prevent the abuse of article 8 rights \u2013 the new rules state that it will only be \"in exceptional circumstances that the public interest in deportation is outweighed\". A report by the Chief Inspector of Borders and Immigration last November found that between February 2010 and January 2011 about a third of appeals lodged by foreign national prisoners against the decision to deport was successful (425 in total) \u2014 primarily on article 8 grounds. In the same year, <a href=\"http://www2.lse.ac.uk/humanRights/articlesAndTranscripts/2011/KlugDeportation.pdf\" title=\"\">5,235 foreign national prisoners were deported</a> from the UK.</p> <p>As of April next year and the introduction of the <a href=\"http://www.justice.gov.uk/legislation/bills-and-acts/acts/legal-aid-and-sentencing-act/laspo-background-information\" title=\"\">Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Act</a>, it will be impossible for foreign national prisoners who wish to challenge deportation proceedings to get legal advice from a solicitor unless they are able to pay for it themselves. \"It is not right to subject someone to a serious sanction of deportation without giving them the means to understand the situation and to assert the rights provided for them by law,\" commented DAS director Nigel Caleb. Quite. By the way, all deportations papers served by the UKBA are written entirely in English.</p> <p>The 2006 crisis led directly to the introduction of the <a href=\"http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2007/30/contents\" title=\"\">UK Borders Act 2007</a> with a new regime of automatic deportation for any non-EEA national (including those granted indefinite leave) who gets a custodial sentence of 12 months or more. So rather than the facts of individual case determining a decision to deport, it is the length of prison sentence.</p> <p>The so-called crisis has also fundamentally changed the attitude of the Home Office staff from senior managers to caseworkers, Steve Symonds of the <a href=\"http://www.ilpa.org.uk\" title=\"\">Immigration Law Practitioners' Association</a> told delegates at the DAS event. According to Symonds, in nine out of 10 cases where detainees are released, they are released as a result of the decision of a court. \"That is obviously because the UKBA and its casework staff cannot countenance the idea that they release someone,\" he said.</p> <p>Symonds made the case for scrapping the automatic deportation provisions. He called it \"a stupid policy position which does not give any more power to deport anybody, but which prevents sensible consideration of the circumstances of every individual rather than just the homogenous mass\".</p> <p>It is a proposal that is hard to disagree with, bit it won't be introduced until more enlightened times.</p>",
  "<p>An MP is calling on parliament to ban liquid nitrogen cocktails after a teenage constituent had to have her stomach removed after she downed two of the drinks at her 18th birthday celebrations.</p> <p>David Morris, the Tory MP for Morecambe and Lunesdale, has written to the health secretary, Jeremy Hunt, and to the Food Standards Agency calling for a ban on the sale of so-called \"nitro cocktails\", after Gaby Scanlon fell ill when she drank two \u00a38.95 nitro J\u00e4germeister drinks at Oscar's wine bar in Lancaster. The cocktail seemingly created a \"frozen bomb\", burning away her stomach tissue to such an extent that she had to have emergency surgery to remove it.</p> <p>When parliament returns next week, Morris will be calling for a ban on the sale of the cocktails. \"I am incredibly angry that such a drink has injured one of my constituents,\" he said.</p> <p>\"I would like to see these drinks banned from sale so we do not see anyone else's son or daughter injured \u2013 or even killed.\"</p> <p>Prof Mark Bellis, director of the centre for public health at Liverpool John Moores University, and one of the UK's leading authorities on alcohol and drug abuse, told the Guardian: \"We have got to remember that the people they are selling these drinks to are often vulnerable as they are already intoxicated. It can be seen as a way of exploiting a very vulnerable population.\"</p> <p>He said that other forms of \"extreme drinking\" included \"soaking tampons with alcohol, nebulising it or pouring it into their eyes\".</p> <p>There has been much debate about whether imbibing alcohol this way is a real phenomenon or an urban myth, but Bellis believes these extreme activities do take place. \"People are at real risk and we have to make sure the industry doesn't exploit vulnerable people,\" he added.</p> <p>Lancashire police, which is investigating the case, said that if Scanlon had not been operated on quickly she would have died. The boiling point of nitrogen is minus 196C and it is stored at very low temperatures.</p> <p>In Manchester, the Alchemist bar sells cocktails including a Dry Iced Tea cocktail with a teapot of dry ice, but staff point out that it has a much higher boiling point (at -57C) than nitrogen, so is safer. \"We use a variety of molecular drinks-making techniques to surprise, baffle and confound your tastebuds,\" it says on its drinks menu.</p> <p>A video on YouTube showing a man pouring vodka into his eyes has been viewed more than 50,000 times. And Prince Harry was criticised in 2007 for taking part in the potentially lethal vodka snorting drinking game. He was captured on video inhaling the spirit amid cheers from his friends.</p> <p>Vodka snorting has potentially serious health risks. The Royal College of Physicians said it contained additives that could cause an allergic reaction and damage the lungs and mucus membranes of the nose and trachea.</p> <p>Nebulising involves putting alcohol in a nebuliser and smoking the vapour, a bit like a hookah.</p> <p>Dr John Ashton, director of public health for Cumbria, said Scanlon was a victim of a dangerous gimmick used to sell more alcohol and the \"irresponsible alcohol industry\" that he said was now competing in this way. Public houses should not be playing with chemistry, he said.</p> <p>He said there should be stringent regulation and questioned why more MPs were not challenging the drinks industry. The cocktails with liquid nitrogen were being promoted as glamorous or somehow reminiscent of celebrity culture, he said, and it had begun to affect the high street. \"She was drinking the cocktail in a licensed premises. It's not as if she was on the edge of society and it's not her fault. It seems that the agencies seem to be abdicating responsibility for what happened.\" The response by the statutory authorities illustrated how fragmented Lancashire's public health services were, he added.</p> <p>Mike Fallon of the Barrow and District Licensed Victuallers Association (LVA) said: \"You don't have to be a brain surgeon to know that if you put an ice cube on your tongue, it will stick to you. Liquid nitrogen will stick to your stomach. I don't know why you would put it in drinks. It is ridiculous.</p> <p>\"We have been ringing round pubs and clubs in our LVA area and I am sure they will keep a safe house. We don't want anything to do with liquid nitrogen. It is definitely a no-go area.\"</p> <p>However, Chris Shaw, owner of 20 Bar in Dalton, was defiant. He believes it is acceptable to use liquid nitrogen if it is handled properly. \"It's only the same as setting cocktails alight, but obviously people are aware of the risks of fire and use it safely,\" he said.</p> <p>Scanlan's stepfather, Ian Henshall, 40, said the family were hoping for a quick recovery. \"She is our main concern at the moment and we are just concentrating on her getting better,\" he said.</p> <p>Oscar's wine bars in Lancaster and York have ceased serving liquid nitrogen cocktails and are \"tremendously concerned\" for Scanlon's welfare.</p> <p>In a statement, they said: \"This unfortunate incident is part of an ongoing police investigation and as such we cannot make any comments other than to say that we are tremendously concerned for the person involved and our heartfelt best wishes go to them and their family at this distressing time.\"</p> <p>Andrew and Sally Dunn, the company's directors, also own Oscar's in Swinegate, York. They began selling nitro cocktails in February, with the staff apparently trained to safely handle the substance. A notice outside the York bar said they were not being served until further notice \"after something had happened elsewhere\".</p> <p>The councillor Paul Aitchison, chairman of Lancaster city council's Licensing Act committee, was at the Lancaster bar a few months ago and tried the cocktail, with no ill-effects. He said: \"I have actually tried it myself \u2013 I thought it sounded interesting. That's probably one of the draws. You assume the drinks served in licensed premises will be safe.</p> <p>\"It was quite scary to think that it could have possibly happened to me.\" He said he was sure there would be a national safety debate.</p> <p>Aitchison said the council's cabinet had called for the health secretary to investigate the matter and called for steps to be taken to limit the selling of such cocktails \"and this includes a possible ban.\"</p> <p>Lancashire police said the investigation was in its early stages and the premises involved had fully co-operated with all agencies.</p> <p>The Food Standards Agency (FSA) said that although liquid nitrogen was not a toxic substance, it was unsafe to drink and eat as the human body was unable to cope with such a cold internal temperature. Colin Houston, the FSA head of incident management, said there were safety and handling guidelines around the use of liquid nitrogen, especially with food.</p> <p>\"It is the business owner's responsibility to make sure their staff have been trained and are aware of the potential risks of using liquid nitrogen,\" he said. \"They also have to have appropriate safety measures in place to protect both their staff and consumers.\"</p> <p>He said the FSA would be making local enforcement officers aware of the use of liquid nitrogen in cocktails and it would be something officers could incorporate as part of their inspection regime. The FSA is also working with other departments and agencies to investigate the issue and whether they need to take further action.</p> <p>Despite her horrific injuries, Scanlon is said to be doing well this week after surgery. According to friends in the village of Heysham, near Lancaster, where she lives with her family, she has been moved from critical care to a ward at the Lancaster Royal Infirmary. Initially, she had been in a \"critical but stable\" condition.</p> <p>She will have to endure regular vitamin injections and remain on a special diet for the rest of her life.</p>",
  "<p>New migrants often enter the UK facing life in the least desirable housing and are more likely to suffer from overcrowding, poor conditions and tenure insecurity than other groups. Competition for scarce affordable housing can also create tension between communities and put obstacles in the way of integration.</p> <p>As communities become more diverse, housing providers need to understand and engage with a broader group of tenants be able work sensitively with range of different cultures.

  "<p>A year ago, with Europe mired in its deepest crisis for 60 years and an air of revolt sweeping the continent, the Guardian teamed up with five other European newspapers to explore the question of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/series/europa\" title=\"\">what the EU is for</a>. The union is currently reviled perhaps like never before: a euro debacle, debt swamping the continent, expansion stalled, sluggish economies going backwards, euroscepticism on the rise. But what of the European success stories? What about trade, movement of people, prosperity, environmental law? What about social programmes, collective heft and \u2013 as the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/oct/12/european-union-nobel-peace-prize\" title=\"\">Nobel prize committee</a> pointed out \u2013 the advent of peace in a part of the world that had been blighted by cataclysmic war every couple of generations?</p> <p>A team of reporters for the Europa project fanned out to find out what the EU did well.

  "<h2><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=munMGzeqCQE\" title=\"\">1) Brazil's footballers at the airport, Nike (1998)</a></h2> <p>Ronaldo. Romario. Roberto Carlos. A joyous kickabout through Rio de Janeiro airport. Sergio Mendes' Mas Que Nada oba-oba-oba-ing in the background. And John Woo in the director's chair. What's not to like? Admittedly when the advert was shown on near-permanent loop during France 98, you may have wanted to volley <em>jogo bonito</em> into a certain Oregon-based multinational's swoosh, but with 14 years' distance it's hard not to be warmed by its tricks, flicks and sheer sunniness.</p> <p>The advert was shot at short notice during the Christmas holidays when Brazil's players, temporarily away from their clubs, could be rounded up. Equipment was delayed due to trucks getting flat tyres. Players turned up late \u2013 seven hours late in Ronaldo's case. And no one in the airport wanted them there. But despite the challenges, it all came together. <a href=\"http://www.theasc.com/magazine/aug98/nike/pg1.htm\" title=\"\">Speaking to the American Society of Cinematographers</a> in August 1998, the director of photography Gale Tattersall said: \"I can't tell you how chaotic it was shooting during the holiday in an airport where nobody wanted us. If you need something in Brazil, it's three days away or that office is closed for the month.\"</p> <p>The advert was shot primarily in a private VIP departure lounge and Varig Airlines' maintenance hangers. \"They'd heard horror stories about lights melting airplane windows, and didn't want us wheeling any lights near their planes,\" explained Tattersall, with a chuckle.</p> <p>But how were they able to capture the players' speed and energy? \"The Steadicam operator, Jeff Mart \u2026 has this amazing ability to wear a Steadicam and ride a bicycle using only one side of the handlebars,\" said Tattersall. \"He can literally drop the bike, get off and start walking \u2026 I recall one shot in particular where he placed the camera at a very low angle and steered his bike toward a player just as the ball was kicked.\"</p> <p>Woo, meanwhile, was able to make the shoot appear natural by the simple act of making them laugh. \"I had lots of moments to make them look great by photographing teasing smiles and childlike actions. Although we all came from so many different backgrounds, we ended up playing like kids, which added a lot of humour to the commercial.\"</p> <p>There were fewer smiles when the extent of Nike's deal with the Brazilian FA was teased out \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2001/jan/11/newsstory.sport2\" title=\"\">which included contractual clauses</a> allowing it to choose Brazil's opposition for certain friendlies and insist on the participation of eight first-teamers.

Sure, the dialogue sounds innocent enough \u2026</p> <blockquote> <strong>Kevin:</strong> Good workout today, 'Enry! <br> <strong>Henry:</strong> And after a good workout \u2026 <br> <strong>Kevin:</strong> \u2026 nothing beats the good smell of Brut \u2026 <br> <strong>Henry:</strong> 'Ere, are you trying to muscle in on my act? <br> <strong>Kevin:</strong> Yeah, why don't you throw in the towel, 'Enry? <br> <strong>Henry:</strong> Gurrr!

Just a clever way of selling a product \u2013 deodorant \u2013 that many men regarded with as much suspicion as women's lib?

It was if the world's greatest ever basketball player told staff at his favourite burger joint: forget the bun, squirt that mustard and ketchupy goodness on my T-shirt. There! There! And there! Not that Bird has anything to be proud of: he's wearing a vest and clearly hasn't shaved the hairs on his back.</p> <p>Still, no one was watching His Airness v His Hairyness for fashion tips \u2013 just the increasingly extravagant, and amusing, attempts to score.</p> <p>\"Every detail was worked out,\" <a href=\"http://\" title=\"\">explained Jim Ferguson</a>, who was part of the team behind the ad, in 2010. \"We actually had to have Larry challenge Michael to the game because we couldn't have Michael make the challenge because of his gambling situation at the time \u2026 Larry added the line, 'No dunking.' Then the two took the first two shots (over the backboard and on their knees). After that, it was just editing though Larry didn't necessarily want to do it that way. When the two of them are in the stands and Larry challenges Michael, Larry was actually trying to figure out if he could really make it off the scoreboard.\"</p> <p>The advert, first broadcast during the Super Bowl, almost didn't hit the air. \"At the last second our lawyers realised we didn't have commercial clearance to use the Hancock Building,\" said Ferguson. \"Eventually I think we traded to the rights to use it for a basketball autographed by Jordan and Bird and I think $100. Nobody ever thought it would turn into what it did.\"</p> <p>A follow-up <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nC6wh1-ni4c\" title=\"\">was aired a year later</a>, featuring Charles Barkley, the grand canyon, and space. \"I got an idea,\" says Larry. \"First person to miss has to watch the other eat two Big Macs.\" Once again, it's worth following along for the ride.</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bo0ncg-2zPY\" title=\"\">4) Shaquille O'Neal plays by his own rules, ESPN (2008)</a></h2> <p>Another basketball legend, another classic advert. On a road trip in their rusty camper van, ESPN presenters Mike Breen and Stuart Scott are playing Scrabble with Shaquille O'Neal. As you do. But it's Scrabble like you've never seen before. After the camera pans to the board \u2013 which has the words 'shaqattack', 'shaqalici', 'shaquesque' and, yes, 'shaqfu' on it \u2013 Shaq is asked: \"How do you get so many qs?\"</p> <p>\"Don't worry about it,\" replies Shaq with the understated menace of Kathy Bates in Misery. \"My turn again.\"</p> <p>A year later O'Neal appeared on Jimmy Kimmel Live <a href=\"http://www.boreme.com/posting.php?id=23950#.UHfO1VEYImo\" title=\"\">and played Scrabble while being interviewed.</a> Sadly for aficionados, Shaq's knowledge of the rules and his word-playing skills suggested that he's not spending retirement thumbing through Chambers Official Scrabble Words International to learn high-scoring plays like dzo, faqir and sheqalim by rote.

That bears repetition, particularly here. It's only right to acknowledge that when sports stars appear in adverts the result is often cheesier than Vernon Kay at a Stilton convention. Or just plain bad. Take <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t_PmcaYHYLk&amp;sns=em\" title=\"\">this karate-tinged commercial</a> for Puma starring Vinnie Jones, Robert Pires and Nicolas Anelka. <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nyvVP5eooQ&amp;sns=em\" title=\"\">Ronaldinho doing this</a> while eating a yoghurt. <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHkqN52xqD4&amp;NR=1&amp;feature=endscreen\" title=\"\">Joe Frazier crooning for the Miller Lite dollar</a>.

Gaze open-jawed as Adams's racy of version 'Hey Big Spender!' suddenly cuts to an awkward Frazier sitting on his mother's knee, announcing \"I've just spent 200 grand on a house for my favourite girl\". His mother replies \"Have a Muriel son, but don't get the ashes on the rug\", and then, bizarrely, the commercial finishes with Adams top-noting Big Spender again. A truly awful effort all round, with production values that make L!VE TV look like a lavish HBO mini-series.</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJK0P2VqFVo\" title=\"\">6) Andr\u00e9s Iniesta and the big friendly bear Gol TV (2010)</a></h2> <p>Just when you thought you couldn't love Andr\u00e9s Iniesta any more, he appeared in an advert with a big, growly, cuddly bear.

  "<p>It is perhaps a sign of a party that was rattled by Ed Miliband's speech that led to Cabinet ministers meeting at the Conservative conference in Birmingham this week to consider ways of stealing the 'One Nation' mantra back from Labour. </p> <p>Where did it start? With the beginnings of a long-overdue debate over how the party regains the trust and confidence of the north, particularly urban seats, in much the same way as Margaret Thatcher did. </p> <p>The facts speak for themselves. Of the 158 constituencies in the North, at the last General Election, the Conservatives won just 43, a little over 27% of the seats available. For a party committed to governing in the national interest this causes problems on two levels.</p> <p>On the crudely political one, the arithmetic is clear: David Cameron cannot hope to win an outright majority without picking up more seats in the three northern regions But there is something else, far more fundamental. At a time when ministers are speaking of the need for yet more austerity, neither party in the coalition has a mandate in the north to push this agenda on.</p> <p>Take benefit reforms, for example. The Chancellor <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2012/oct/08/george-osborne-austerity-2018\">this week announced</a> that \u00a310 billion of further cuts would be needed from the welfare budget, a proposal likely to hurt the north more than the south. Yet despite this, the largest party in Government claims a mandate for such reforms not from those likely to be most affected, but from the south where jobs are in much greater supply. Little wonder that many now openly question whether Britain is fast becoming not one nation, but two. </p> <p>Writing <a href=\"http://www.leftfootforward.org/2012/10/this-government-does-not-understand-the-north/\">last Friday for Left Foot Forward</a>, Kevin Meagher, a <em>Guardian Northerner</em> contributor and former special adviser when Labour was in power, declared that the Government \"just doesn't understand the North\". What then does the party need to do to show that is does \"get\" the north.</p> <p>Last week we heard from the Conservative MP for Hexham, Guy Opperman who in his <em>Guardian Northerner</em> article <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/the-northerner/2012/oct/05/conservatives-conservative-conference-2012\">called on the party leadership </a>to adopt a more traditionalist, Thatcherite stance, arguing that policies on immigration and welfare reform played well with northern voters as bread and butter issues when communicated clearly. </p> <p>Likewise, writing for the<em> Guardian</em> over the weekend, Neil O'Brien, Director of the Conservative's favourite Think Tank, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/oct/05/conservatives-new-workers-party\">Policy Exchange argued</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Today the Tories urgently need a new round of renewal. While progress has been made, Tory modernisation has not healed the party's worst wounds. It is still seen as the party of the rich. It does badly in urban areas, particularly outside the south-east. And that's partly because it does so badly among Britain's biggest ethnic minorities.</p> <p>Obviously Cameron should ignore calls from the usual suspects to lurch rightward. But the solution isn't as simple as tacking to the centre \u2013 after all, most voters have tough views on crime, welfare and immigration. What's needed is a blue-collar modernisation, focused on the north and Midlands.</p> </blockquote> <p>With David Cameron having rejected the idea that the party is somehow toxic in the north <a href=\"http://www.thenorthernecho.co.uk/news/9971192.Cameron_denies_North_is_toxic_to_Tories/\">during an interview </a>with the <em>Northern Echo</em>, just how is the party doing on what Guy Opperman sees as the bread and butter issues of immigration and welfare reform and is David Cameron really the man to reach out to the north?</p> <p><strong>Immigration</strong></p> <p>It's one of those perennial issues. When I used to work for an MP and spent dark evenings and weekends knocking on doors campaigning, immigration was often cited by voters as a major area of concern, particularly the belief that many eastern European migrants are simply taking jobs that British people could fill. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2010/apr/28/gordon-brown-bigoted-woman\">Gordon Brown's gaffe</a> during the General Election, when he described Rochdale pensioner Gillian Duffy as a 'bigot' for raising the issue of immigration, was a sign of Labour's difficulty in confronting the question. Nonetheless, Ipsos Mori's <a href=\"http://www.ipsos-mori.com/Assets/Docs/Polls/IssuesIndextabsSeptember12.pdf\">most recent issues index</a> points to 20% of northerners feeling that immigration is one of the main issues facing the country. This was just 1% less than the NHS, traditionally seen as the most precious of institutions to the public. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397622930\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/7/1349632913950/Theresa-May-002.jpg\" alt=\"Theresa May\" width=\"140\" height=\"130\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Theresa May; pressing immigration buttons.

But is it?</p> <p>Asked by <a href=\"http://cdn.yougov.com/cumulus_uploads/document/yzb3zx2976/YG-Archives-Pol-Sun-results-081012.pdf\">YouGov in its poll</a> for the <em>Sun</em> this week which of the three main parties northern voters felt would handle the issue of immigration best, 24% said the Conservatives whilst 27% said Labour. For the likes of Guy Opperman, such figures are likely to be a sign that the party isn't doing a good enough job at selling its problems. That would be fine if it wasn't for the fact that <a href=\"http://cdn.yougov.com/cumulus_uploads/document/tdixuso356/YG-Archives-Pol-ST-results%20-%2005-071012.pdf\">YouGov's poll </a>for the <em>Sunday Times</em> over the weekend found that when asked how good a job the Government was doing on immigration (note, nothing about comparisons with opposition), just 15% said a good job compared to the 68% who said a bad one. Voters' indications seems to suggest that in the north we have problems with the substance rather than the message. </p> <p><strong>Welfare Reform</strong></p> <p>One of the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2012/oct/08/george-osborne-deal-welfare-cuts\">biggest cheers of the week</a> in Birmingham came from the party faithful in response to the Chancellor's news that among the \u00a310 billion of new savings to be made in the welfare budget will be the removal of housing benefit from all under-25s. It was the kind of red meat the Tory party wanted to hear. But is it, as Guy Opperman suggests, what the <em>north</em> wants to hear?</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.ipsos-mori.com/Assets/Docs/Polls/IssuesIndextabsSeptember12.pdf\">Ipsos Mori's issues index</a> found that just 8% of northern voters rated social security and benefits issues as a priority facing the country, and as with immigration, <a href=\"http://cdn.yougov.com/cumulus_uploads/document/yzb3zx2976/YG-Archives-Pol-Sun-results-081012.pdf\">YouGov's findings</a> for the <em>Sunday Times</em> found 28% of northerners believing the Government are doing a good job on welfare reform compared to the 60% who said they were doing a bad one. Perhaps this one isn't the winner that some on the right think it might be. </p> <p><strong>Would Boris do it for the Conservatives in the North? </strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397622931\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Politics/Pix/pictures/2012/10/9/1349784224327/Boris-Johnson-004.jpg\" alt=\"Boris Johnson\" width=\"140\" height=\"130\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Boris. Not all secret weapons work in the north. Photograph: Sportsphoto Ltd/Allstar</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sportsphoto Ltd/Allstar</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>And finally, the question of leadership. Is David Cameron really the man to reach out to the north, and perhaps more fundamentally does Boris Johnson's star appeal extend to Yorkshire, the North East and North West?</p> <p><a href=\"http://news.opinium.co.uk/sites/news.opinium.co.uk/files/VI_02_10_2012_OP3036.pdf\">Polling by Opinium</a> for the <em>Observer</em> over the weekend asked voters to rate how favourably they viewed certain Conservative politicians. For David Cameron, the unfavourables reached 50% in the North East, 60% in the North West and 53% in Yorkshire and the Humber. Boris Johnson however saw his favourables across all three northern regions clearly higher than his unfavourables. Not a good start for the Prime Minister. But it's not all bad news for Number 10, as the rest of the BoJo stardust seems confined down south. </p> <p>Asked how likely it is that northerners would vote Conservative if Boris Johnson replaced David Cameron as party leader by the time of the next election, a clear majority said it was unlikely, while a similar majority could not imagine him as Prime Minister. Interestingly, asked which they would prefer to see replace David Cameron, in the north east and Yorkshire and the Humber, William Hague clearly leads Boris Johnson. </p> <p>The message then? While BoJo's stock is rising in his party, it is unlikely that he would be an answer to the Conservative's northern problem. With <a href=\"http://www.comres.co.uk/polls/The_People_Leaders_Oct2012.pdf\">ComRes polling </a>for the <em>People</em> newspaper finding that 56% in the north east, 53% in the north west and 53% in Yorkshire and the Humber see Cameron as out of touch, it is tackling this problem that could prove the key to a northern revival.

  "<p>Ah Heston, Heston, Heston. \u00dcbermensch of the gastronomic zeitgeist that you are, it's hard to write anything food-related without mentioning your name.

For it's never just lasagne where you're concerned. Even now, as I survey the sleek black packaging I know that inside is so much more than a lasagne. You promise it's \"even better than mama used to make.\" Well it's not, but it's fine. It is indeed rich and the pasta is well-textured, and despite the abiding sense of glueyness I return for another forkful. Chilli con carne is deliciously smoky and has a good level of spice and richness \u2013 nudged along by the flavoured butter, though the mince is a little granular.</p> <p>Onto the shepherd's pie, a dish that I've long believed stands or falls on the quality of its mash, and I'm sure you agree. You've spent many hours getting your mash right, analysing water content and starch levels of various potato varieties in order to achieve the smoothest results. This mash is smooth all right \u2013 it would do a plasterer well. It also remains oddly straight-faced during its half hour in the oven, unwilling to adopt the golden crust one yearns for. The filling is terrific \u2013 a combination of braised lamb shank and mince with a good depth of flavour. But it's lipstick on a pig of a potato dish. Same with the fish pie. There's a lively mustard-tarragon thing going on and the fish has retained its texture - but again, it's let down by the mash.</p> <p>\"Great mash depends on the right potato,\" you tell us on the packaging for your mashed potato for two. No doubt it does, but it doesn't lie within. Without the redeeming fillings of the other mash abominations, the faults are unforgivable. Texture, flavour, smell and appearance all score nul points. A belly flop.</p> <p>The diamond in the rough is the mac and cheese. There's a magnificent tang of proper mature cheddar, a lovely crunchy crumb on top, and the inspired addition of al dente cauliflower \u2013 it's two of the finest comfort dishes rolled into one. Then I'm reminded that it's meant to have truffle in it, which it doesn't seem to and doesn't really need anyway. Truffle is a cheffy shortcut for improving a dull dish. Stick it in your spuds instead.</p> <p>There's nothing here that's entirely without merit, but we've come to expect more of you, Heston. Where's the twist of genius, the sleight of hand, the derring-do? Most importantly, what happened to the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/2012/mar/31/heston-blumenthal-olympic-airline-meals\" title=\"\">\"painstaking lengths\"</a> to which you'll go to perfect every dish?

  "<p>The winner of the 2012 <a href=\"http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/\" title=\"\">Nobel peace prize</a> will be revealed later today, amid frenzied speculation that this year's award could be given to bloggers from the Arab spring, Russian rights activists or even to Julian Assange, currently holed up in an embassy next to Harrods.</p> <p>The five members of the Nobel peace prize committee will announce their decision at 10am BST. Some 231 individuals and organisations have been nominated for this year's prize, to be awarded in Oslo on 10 December \u2013 slightly fewer than 2011, which had a record 241 entries.</p> <p>Last year <a href=\"http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/index.html\" title=\"\">three women shared the award</a> \u2013 Liberia's president Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, the Liberian activist Leymah Gbowee and the Yemeni politician Tawakkul Karman. It significantly boosted the number of women winners \u2013 the tally was previously just 12 since 1901. The committee praised their \"non-violent struggle for the safety of women and for women's rights to full participation in peace-building work\".</p> <p>However, in an embarrassing blow to the committee, Gbowee <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/10/former-ally-ellen-johnson-sirleaf\" title=\"\">recently launched a scathing attack on Sirleaf</a>, her fellow laureate and Africa's first female head of state. Gbowee accused Liberia's president of nepotism and complacency over poverty reduction, and dramatically quit her post as head of the government's Peace and Reconciliation Commission.</p> <p>This year, the bookies' favourite for the Nobel prize is <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_Sharp\" title=\"\">Gene Sharp</a>, one of the world's leading theorists of non-violence and an emeritus professor at the University of Massachusetts. (<a href=\"http://www.paddypower.com/bet/current-affairs/nobel-prizes/Nobel-Peace-Prize-2012-3336373.html\" title=\"\">Paddy Power has installed him at 6/4</a>.) Sharp is credited with inspiring peaceful protests across the globe, from Cairo to Beijing. Two other activists prominent during the Arab spring are also tipped \u2013 29-year-old Tunisian blogger <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/oct/23/tunisia-elections-haunted-by-ben-ali-regime\" title=\"\">Lina Ben Mhenni</a> and the celebrated Egyptian internet activist <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jan/13/protesters-egypt-tahrir-wael-ghonim\" title=\"\">Wael Ghonim.</a></p> <p>The most politically controversial choice, however, would be to give the prize to campaigners from eastern Europe. Since his return to the Kremlin in May, Russia's president Vladimir Putin has enacted a series of repressive new measures in response to growing anti-government protests. He has expelled USAID and demanded that western-funded Russian non-governmental organisations brand themselves as \"foreign agents\" \u2013 a move straight from the KGB's playbook.</p> <p>One activist mentioned for the prize is <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/aug/20/russia.comment\" title=\"\">Svetlana Gannushkina</a> and her Moscow-based human rights organisation Memorial. Another is Lyudmila Alexseyava, the 85-year-old doyenne of Russia's human rights scene, and chair of the Moscow Helskinki Group. Alexeyeva is one of the few survivors of the Soviet dissident movement, a veteran enemy of state power, and was <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/12/world/europe/12dissident.html\" title=\"\">arrested two years ago at a New Year's Eve protest dressed as the Snow Maiden</a>.</p> <p>Another contender is Ales Belyatsky, an activist from Belarus. Belyatsky was detained in August 2011 and jailed after a show trial condemned as \"political\" by the European Union. Putin and his Belarusian counterpart Alexander Lukashenko are likely to react badly if the peace prize is given to activists from their countries, and to regard it as unacceptable western meddling.</p> <p>Following his nomination in 2011, the WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange is also on the list \u2013 and tipped by the bookies at 16/1. It seems far-fetched, however, that Assange will get the award at a time when he is fighting rape allegations and an EU arrest warrant for extradition to Stockholm, home of the Nobel Foundation. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/aug/19/julian-assange-balcony-bolivar-knightsbridge\" title=\"\">Assange has been living in the Ecuadorean embassy in London since June and has been given political asylum</a>. He would have to get past the Scotland Yard policemen waiting on the doorstep to arrest him to collect his prize.</p> <p>There are several long-shot suggestions also on the bookies' list including Facebook (33/1), the European Union (40/1) and Bono (100/1). Other more plausible names doing the rounds in Oslo include the former German chancellor Helmut Kohl, now in poor health; the Mexican bishop Jose Raul Lopez; Cuban dissident Oscar Elias Biscet; blogger Yoani Sanchez; and the instigators of the Myanmar reform process.</p> <p>The award consists of a Nobel diploma, a gold medal and 8m Swedish kronor (\u00a3700,000). Previous winners who have provoked controversy include Barack Obama \u2013 he had only just become US president in 2009, leading many to wonder what he had actually achieved \u2013 and Henry Kissinger.</p>",
