  "<p>Six members of the Olympic and Paralympic teams from the Democratic Republic of Congo are planning to claim political asylum on Monday after the conclusion of the 2012 games.</p> <p>The athletes and coaches, who are appealing to the UK government for sanctuary, say murders of opponents by government forces and other human rights abuses are on the increase. They claim the situation has deteriorated sharply since the elections last November in which President Joseph Kabila was re-elected despite claims that his main rival Etienne Tshisekedi was the true winner. Widespread violence was reported during the election period.</p> <p>Those claiming asylum are Paralympic athletes Levy Kitambala Kinzito and Dedeline Mibamba Kimbata, the national technical director of the Athletic Federation of Congo, Guy Nkita Kinkela, who is here as a coach, boxing coach Adelare Ibula Masengo and Judo coach Blaise Bekwa. Judoka Cedric Mandembo has gone into hiding and is also thought to be fearing persecution from the Congolese government.</p> <p>Wearing T-shirts supporting the recently launched \"Stop Kabila Now\" campaign by Congolese dissidents, and the 2012 games passes that confirm they are representing their country, some of the athletes were close to tears as they talked about events in their homeland.</p> <p>They said there is a political split in the Congolese team at the 2012 games, with some supporting Kabila and others strongly opposed to him.</p> <p>Kinkela said: \"Some athletes here are supporters of Kabila but we don't know them. Some replaced athletes with a better track record. One athlete shares the surname of the opposition leader, Tshisekedi, and he was not allowed to come because his surname was considered to be promoting the opposition leader.</p> <p>\"We feel that the members of the team who support Kabila are watching our movements.\"</p> <p>The asylum-seekers have criticised the Congolese government on the African TV channel Ben TV since arriving in London. They claim this has meant that they are regarded as traitors.</p> <p>Bekwa said: \"My brother was a supporter of the opposition. He was shot and killed on election day. The situation is so bad in Congo and there is a real need for us to receive protection in the UK. If you oppose the government, it is not only the individual who is at risk but their family and friends too.\"</p> <p>Kinkela added: \"In Congo, I have attended demonstrations against the government but it is hard to publicly criticise Kabila when I am in my country. In London, we are free to speak.\"</p> <p>Kimbata said she had seen some of her neighbours shot dead by government forces on election day. \"In my area, 95% of people voted against Kabila.\"</p> <p>She lost both legs after stepping on a landmine and said that she had not benefited from money given to Congolese athletes by games officials. \"I'm a wheelchair racer but I don't have a racing chair in Congo, only an orthopaedic chair that is supposed to be pushed by someone else. I was told to keep quiet about this and not complain about the lack of equipment I had during my training.\"</p> <p>She is racing at the games in a chair donated to her by British Paralympic athlete Anne Wafula Strike. Strike, who was born in Kenya, has highlighted the problems of disabled athletes from developing countries in accessing the right equipment to compete.</p> <p>Human rights abuses in Congo are widely documented. A delegation of UK Border Agency officials are in Congo now to investigate claims of persecution of refused asylum-seekers from the UK.</p> <p>Okito Tongomo, chair of the Congolese Support Group in the UK \u2013 which opposes the Kabila government \u2013 said: \"This is a tragic situation and these members of the Congolese team need protection here in the UK. There is a long history of human rights abuses in Congo but things are getting worse.\"</p> <p>The team's solicitor, Hani Zubeidi, said: \"They are planning to claim asylum on Monday. I hope the Home Office gives them an appointment without delay. Sometimes, people have to wait for weeks before they can lodge their asylum claim but these claims should be dealt with urgently.\"</p>",

The leader suggested that some or all of the financing of the SFO be transferred to City institutions. It is true that the SFO gives better value for money than the FSA, but putting more regulatory costs on to the City is not the answer. In any case, the SFO is a policing and prosecution function. No one is suggesting the transfer of those costs to local councils.</p> <p>In our report, <a href=\"http://www.adamsmith.org/research/reports/simple-rules-for-complex-systems-streamlining-the-uks-financial-regulation-regime\" title=\"\">Simple Rules for Complex Systems: Streamlining the UK's Financial Regulation Regime</a>, we looked at the forthcoming division of the FSA into three parts and concluded that, given some small enhancement of the SFO and the Financial Ombudsman Service, two of the progeny of the FSA were unnecessary.</p> <p>It would make more sense to cut the costs of the FSA and its progeny and use the tax accruing from the extra City profits arising to increase the SFO's budget.</p> <p><strong>Tim Ambler</strong></p> <p>Adam Smith Institute,</p> <p>London SW1</p> <h2><strong>Unkindest cuts of all</strong></h2> <p>I was extremely concerned, although not surprised, by Sir Merrick Cockell's warning that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/sep/01/council-reserves-will-run-dry?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">\"cuts will bleed council reserves dry within five years\"</a> (News).

Palestinian cultural visits are routinely frustrated, obstructed, prevented, banned.</p> <p>She must be very underinformed if she does not realise that Batsheva were not being held \"responsible for any Israeli government policies\".

  "<p>The foolish man built his house upon sand; the wise man built his house on a rock. The ambitious entrepreneurs of Datang chose a sturdy nylon and wool foundation. \"People always need socks,\" points out Xu Leile, whose company clothes the feet of the British and US armies, European hikers and pampered pet dogs.</p> <p>Thanks to Xu and hundreds more like him, \"Sock City\" \u2013 north-west of Tie Town, east of Sweater Town \u2013 epitomised China's economic success story. The obscure settlement in eastern Zhejiang province became an export-driven boomtown, producing as much as a third of the world's sock supply and thriving even through the financial crisis in 2008 and the subsequent global recession.</p> <p>Last year, Datang made roughly two pairs of socks for every person on earth. Long and short, Argyle or polka-dotted, they cram the stores of the nearby wholesale market. In Xu's spacious new factory, the shelves are stacked with huge reels of red, blue and orange thread. But ask Xu about the future and he grimaces. \"I'm very worried. This year is much worse than 2008-9,\" he says.</p> <p>The biggest of his rivals to have gone under in May \u2013 the Anli Sock Group, which produced 60m pairs of socks annually \u2013 could prove to be \"the Lehman Brothers of Datang\", according to Fan Jianping, chief economist of the State Information Centre.</p> <p>Failures such as Anli's and a slew of disappointing data in recent weeks are raising fears far beyond China that a slowdown in the world's second largest economy is turning into a hard landing. In the face of Europe's woes and the weak US recovery, Chinese growth has become more important than ever: the ripples are already being felt globally, with commodities analysts blaming tumbling prices on falling demand from China.</p> <p>The country's premier, Wen Jiabao, has issued repeated warnings about the economy, saying growth is under pressure and exports need support. Last week's <a href=\"www.theguardian.com/business/2012/sep/07/china-boosts-economy-infrastructure-plan\" title=\"\">announcement of approval for infrastructure projects</a>, which some estimate to be worth 1tn yuan (\u00a399bn), appears to be an indication of just how alarmed authorities have become about the largely investment-driven economy.</p> <p>Until now, they have taken a series of milder measures, such as cutting the reserve ratio requirement and reducing interest rates, mindful of the painful hangover that resulted from the huge 4tn yuan stimulus they adopted to stave off the last crisis. That inflated property prices again and left a legacy of massive local government debt and questionable loans and infrastructure projects.</p> <p>China's economy saw second-quarter growth of 7.6% year-on-year: enviable to US or European eyes, but the lowest rate in three years, and the sixth straight quarter of slowing growth. Export growth slid to 1% in July \u2013 the lowest rate for three years, bar January, which was skewed by the lunar New Year holiday \u2013 and earlier this week, the official factory purchasing managers' index fell to 49.2 \u2013 the first time since November that it had dropped below the 50 barrier separating expansion from contraction.</p> <p>\"We should be very worried,\" says Anne Stevenson-Yang, co-founder of Beijing-based J Capital Research. \"The economy has been in a hard landing since the fourth quarter of last year, but seems to have been helped by the consumer economy \u2026 That's now down as well.\"</p> <p>Most analysts are more optimistic, at least for now. While growth has fallen from a peak of 11.9% in the first quarter of 2010, when there were concerns about overheating, the decline is far less steep than last time, when it plummeted from a peak of 14.8% in the second quarter of 2007 to a low of 6.6% in early 2009.</p> <p>But Alistair Thornton of IHS Global Insight warns: \"More of the indicators we are looking at are showing strain and weakness. It's nowhere near what we were looking at four years ago, but nonetheless pretty ugly.</p> <p>\"There are huge stockpiles of coal at Qinhuangdao; steel factories in Hebei are over capacity; in retail, auto dealers have two, three, four months' more stock than they are used to.\"</p> <p>Cranes still tower over construction sites, but no one is working in them, says Yu Wankun, the sales manager for SANY Excavators in Jiangsu, the neighbouring province to Zhejiang.</p> <p>\"I feel like a blossoming summer has suddenly turned into a dull winter,\" he laments. \"In 2008, we didn't feel the crisis at all. This year, we do feel the crisis has really struck. The government's stimulus created a bubble. But many local governments are in debt now and the central government's financial support has stopped.\"</p> <p>The knock-on effects hit people hard when exports started falling in May, says Xiao Zhou, boss of another Datang firm. \"A lot of sock companies started doing real estate in Jiangsu \u2013 they went bust because of the property market, not because of sales,\" he says.</p> <p>Back in the sock factory, Xu has heard that 73 clothing firms have gone under this year, with some leaving behind debts of billions of yuan. Things have not been so bad since 2003, when foreign buyers stayed away because of the Sars crisis. Usually Xu goes to the US once a year; this time, he has made three trips \u2013 but one major customer halved its usual $5m order anyway. Sales to civilian customers are down by at least a fifth.</p> <p>It is a sign of the times that his firm, Huazhong, considers the boom in sales to the Syrian army as a rare bright spot. \"Last year they bought 870,000 pairs. This year it's 960,000 already,\" he says. Few might imagine that camouflage or khaki ribbed socks came in so many varieties, but French, Singaporean and Saudi Arabian soldiers have proved exacting customers.</p> <p>But Datang also has its strengths. Smart entrepreneurs have moved away from piling high and selling cheap to targeting foreigners. Xu decided early on to focus on high-quality products and military sales, which he hoped would prove more stable and more lucrative. Though his company has dabbled in producing woolly hats, lacy tights and dog booties, Xu's latest target is the medical market, with products such as support stockings. Others in Datang have focused on domestic consumers or sought new markets in rival developing countries.</p> <p>The rise in Chinese purchases and the increase in trade to the Middle East should also help to offset problems elsewhere, says Hou Zhiping, general manager of the city's hosiery market.</p> <p>So far, there is little sign of rising unemployment \u2013 admittedly a trailing indicator \u2013 which might fuel fears of social unrest. At the labour market in nearby Yiwu, a recruiter for the Xialaite sock company grumbled about the difficulties of finding enough employees.</p> <p>Geoff Crothall of China Labour Bulletin, a Hong Kong-based group supporting mainland workers, says there have been noticeably more layoffs than last year, especially in Zhejiang and Guangdong, \"but nothing like 2008-9, when 20m workers were laid off \u2026 I don't think there's a huge number of unemployed migrant workers wandering around.\"</p> <p>Recruiters in those provinces had previously complained of severe labour shortages, he points out, and opportunities in migrants' home provinces have improved: \"Recently it was reported that, for the first time, there were more rural labourers from Sichuan working within the province than outside it.\"</p> <p>Beijing's push to develop inland areas has also had some success, as Crothall points out: while Zhejiang's economy grew 5.2% in the first half of 2012, down from 12.1% in the same period last year, western areas like Sichuan, Chongqing, Shaanxi and Guizhou all saw rates of above 16%, according to official figures.</p> <p>But growth is now slowing in those regions, too \u2013 and because their economies are so much smaller, they have less effect on the overall situation. \"You would have to triple Xinjiang's economy to have an impact on the national picture&#xa0;\u2026 If you can't fix Guangdong, you can't fix China,\" says Thornton.</p> <p>Yet, says Patrick Chovanec of Tsinghua University's School of Economics and Management, the outlook is not uniformly negative: \"This is an economic adjustment and, in the long run, will be good for China and the world, but it doesn't mean it won't be painful.\"</p> <p>Officials and analysts have long warned that the Chinese economy is unsustainable; that the years of double-digit growth were fuelled by investment and exports, and that rebalancing and reform were desperately needed.</p> <p>A powerful editorial in <em>Caixin</em>, the country's most influential business magazine, raised fears that local governments were ignoring the centre's cautious approach and instead attempting another major stimulus that would crowd out smaller private enterprises, deter competition and increase distortions in the system.</p> <p>Continuing to pursue high-speed growth, fuelled by government investment, will mean that \"growth will fall; discrimination will become pervasive, and rent-seeking and corruption rampant; our society and environment will be pushed to their limits; and development cannot be sustained. The mass protests, riots and environmental disasters we have seen are just some of the consequences of this distorting growth model. They are a warning,\" it said.</p> <p>\"If we continue to hanker for economic 'miracles', we must be prepared to pay a high price in future.\"</p> <p><em>Additional research by Cecily Huang and Kathy Gao</em></p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 11 September 2012 to correct comments made by Xu Leile.</p>",
  "<p>It is a bold idea to graft Shakespeare's thoughts about forests and make something original out of them \u2013 to turn over a new narrative leaf. And the Catalan director Calixto Bieito, known for his imaginative liberties with Shakespeare, is in his element in <strong>Forests</strong>. Rebecca Ringst's set is arresting but one should take it as a warning: the stage is dominated by a bare silhouette \u2013 and this is no tree of life. Dazzling white light shines on to the stage but is more surgical than vernal. White streamers descend, nicely illustrating the line from <em>As You Like It</em>: \"Here in the skirts of the forest like fringe upon a petticoat.\" The show starts as it means to go on, as a congested but skilful hybrid in English and Catalan, with subtitles at the side of the stage, taking in <em>A Midsummer Night's Dream</em>, <em>Henry VI:</em> <em>Part II</em> and <em>As You Like It</em>, all mixed with Maika Makovski's beautiful singing. Her sylvan lullabies rock us into a false sense of security.</p> <p>If there are \"sermons in stones\" in this forest, they are not insisting on a straight and narrow course. The freedom here is sexual \u2013 and gender-swapping opportunities abound. Christopher Simpson's Orlando is unnervingly gorgeous in black wig, cocktail frock and golden stilettoes. Katy Stephens is electrifying throughout, but especially as Rosalind in a man's suit. The actors run breathlessly round the tree. Some cartwheel. They scream and kiss. This is free-fall Eden. The liberation within Bieito's forest also includes a freedom with Shakespeare's words \u2013 permitted to run away from home. As ever, Shakespeare proves tolerant to reinvention, his words pliant as willow.</p> <p>But what Bieito misses is the most precious of Shakespeare's forest freedoms: pastoral sweetness. Where is the \"good in everything\" in which <em>As You Like It</em> delights? Bieito's Arden is limited by its focus on sexual abandon, and even its melancholy seems one-dimensional \u2013 Josep Maria Pou dominates it as an unhinged philosopher in a winter coat who has presence but lacks charm, and is more likely to be admitted to an asylum than detain anyone with his wit. It seems that Bieito has taken Rosalind's description of love as a \"madness\" too literally, intent on committing us to the darkness she prescribes. One can see his manic anthology is about to take a turn for the worse.</p> <p>When it comes, the turning point is magnificently staged. The actors rush to demolish the base of the tree \u2013 earth spills out in every direction. What follows is as frightening as anything in Goya's black paintings. The landscape is suggestive of an open grave as we turn to Bieito's darker purpose. But the difficulty he faces is that, taken out of context, Shakespeare's tragic figures lose stature. Gloucester and Lear are diminished twins, Ophelia is doll-like, suffocated by a polythene bag, and when Hamlet says: \"I have of late \u2013 but wherefore I know not \u2013 lost all my mirth...\", he sounds dim, as it seems obvious that anyone in these benighted surroundings would have lost the will to live, never mind mislaid their mirth. Nor is the power of the piece augmented by George Costigan's tendency to give us famous speeches as if in inverted commas, in a you've-heard-it-all-before sort of manner (particularly true of Jaques's <a href=\"http://internetshakespeare.uvic.ca/Library/SLT/life/lifesubj+1.html\" title=\"\">seven ages of man</a>).</p> <p>If Shakespearean sweetness is missing from the earlier part of the evening, it is catharsis that is absent from the second. In the pendulum swing from light to dark there is a failure to acknowledge Shakespearean hinterlands, clearings in the wood. Bieito sees this as being about renewal, but the concluding image of a tree decorated with red balloons seems an apologetic regeneration. For all its classy verve, this is a production that cannot redeem itself, will never be out of the wood.</p> <p>It's not often that one show leads to another, but in Flintshire's Wepre Park in Wales there's a chance to take a walk through real woodland of such beauty that it would make a romantic poet swoon. Even without any theatrical contribution, the time spent walking (between 6pm and 9pm) into the advancing night, towards the 13th-century ruined <a href=\"http://www.greatcastlesofwales.co.uk/ewloe.htm\" title=\"\">Ewloe Castle</a>, would have been a&nbsp;pleasure. <a href=\"http://nationaltheatrewales.org/whatson/performance/ntw22\" title=\"\"><strong>Branches: The Nature of Crisis</strong></a>, a choreographed tale from National Theatre Wales, is a wildly eccentric piece of work. It offers large chunks of&nbsp;gripping storytelling from the Celtic&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/history/sites/themes/society/myths_mabinogion.shtml\" title=\"\">Mabinogion</a>,&nbsp;but the most unexpected thing about it is that Argentinian director Constanza Macras's real subject is economics. We are asked to consider \u2013 on rocky shelf and by running brook and beside trees with curtsying branches \u2013 not only the&nbsp;modern credit crunch but economic history: the South Sea Bubble and 18th-century Scottish economist <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Law_(economist)\" title=\"\">John Law</a>.</p> <p>It's an evening of striking imagery. I loved the wedding dresses hanging from trees, lit from within and, presumably, for sale. And although the narrative is frustratingly discontinuous, there is much spirit. I'll remember the funky Japanese couple exclaiming over nettles, the three drunk women on a hen night, squabbling in the shallows of the river,&nbsp;and the pining fellow by a waterfall singing lieder to a mermaid. Every now and then, adding to the rum&nbsp;experience, a lugubrious, unstaged dog walker would pass by \u2013 like a modern Jaques.</p>",
  "<p>In February 1965 the Hungarian director of the Royal Opera House \u2013 emerging as incontestably the greatest conductor of his generation \u2013 flew to Tel Aviv to lead a series of performances by the Israel Philharmonic. Georg Solti had for a while been much enamoured by young television reporter Valerie Pitts, who had interviewed him in the Savoy hotel a few months previously, in September 1964, and he had pressed her to join him on the road. Early in March 1965 she duly arrived in the Middle East and Solti was asked by the singer Ken McDonald how long the comely blond visitor was planning to stay. \"For the rest of her life,\" replied the maestro.</p> <p>Pitts had been working as an interviewer and announcer for the BBC, with her own programme covering cultural events in the week ahead. \"I wrote and researched the programme during the previous week, ready for transmission on a Monday evening,\" recalls Lady Solti today. \"At the end of August there was a last-minute change of plan. The clip of the new film I was going to talk about was held up in customs. I was in a total panic. It was Friday afternoon and I had to find an item. So I thought: the Royal Opera House \u2013 maybe they've got a ballet or an opera \u2013 and Sheila Porter in the Opera House press office said, 'Well, there's always Solti. He's doing a new <em>Ring</em>.' She rang back a few minutes later, saying: 'He'll do it. Make yourself pretty and be there at 11, at the Savoy.' That was all very well but where on a Friday at 5.30 was I going to find a film crew for the next day?</p> <p>\"A minor miracle happened \u2013 the BBC could send a crew, providing I could finish in time for them to be at Arsenal football ground for the kick-off. So off I went to interview Solti, without knowing quite what I was going to talk to him about. I knew nothing of the <em>Ring</em>, except that it was very long, in German and by Richard Wagner.\"</p> <p>\"When I arrived at the Savoy the film crew were becoming agitated as there was no sign of him. The receptionist told me that Dr Solti was in his room. I went up in a lift which was transformed into a red lacquer temple, found the room, knocked on the door and a guttural voice said: 'What do you want?' I said I was from the BBC, and suddenly the door flew open and there he was, wrapped up in steaming towels. 'My dear, I'm so sorry,' he said. 'I forgot. Do you think you could find my socks?'</p> <p>\"So I was looking for his socks under the bed and suddenly the door flew open and there was the head of the opera house press office, saying: 'Valerie, what are you doing there?' \u2013 with me, bottom in the air, searching for Solti's socks.\"</p> <p>The young reporter admitted to the maestro: \"I'm not awfully good on opera. Truthfully, I don't like it much because I saw a frightful production in Frankfurt \u2013 <em>Elektra,</em> I think. It was horrid.\"</p> <p>There followed a terrible pause, then Solti's brown eyes twinkled. \"My dear, what year was that?\" he asked. Then he laughed: \"Thank you very much. I was conducting.\"</p> <p>\"And that's how it all began,\" says Lady Solti. \"I was bewitched \u2013 captivated \u2013 by this man, and logic and pragmatism just flew out of the window. It was a <em>coup de foudre</em>. After months of turmoil I went to Israel. I arrived to a hotel room which he had filled with vases of carnations and antirrhinums. A few days later he dictated my letter of resignation to the BBC!\"</p> <p>We are speaking in Solti's London studio which is rather like a museum, now frequently used by young musicians as a place where they can study and rehearse. The place is vibrant with creativity. On Solti's old desk is a fragment of the living past \u2013 a score of Bach's <em>St John Passion</em>, on which Solti was working when he died, covered with his hallmark annotations in lead pencil and red crayon \u2013 his two strata of excavation and analysis of the composer's intent.</p> <p>Next month marks the centenary of the birth of the conductor, musician, visionary, jester, husband and father who bore witness to, and embodies, his time, the core of the 20th century, and whose genius \u2013 a word too liberally used nowadays \u2013 not only towered over the music-making of his lifetime but radically changed it in ways that are only now becoming clear.</p> <p>Fittingly, the 100 years that have passed since his birth will be celebrated in the city he made his musical home, Chicago, with a concert by the <a href=\"http://www.worldorchestraforpeace.com/\" title=\"\">World Orchestra for Peace</a> \u2013 which Solti founded in Geneva in 1995 for the 50th anniversary of the United Nations. The concert will be on his birthday, <a href=\"http://www.chicago-theater.com/theaters/symphony-center/tickets.php?buy=true&amp;eventID=1833490&amp;edate=2012-10-21T13:15:00&amp;utc=1350850500&amp;eventName=World+Orchestra+For+Peace\" title=\"\">21 October, at Symphony Centre in Chicago</a>. (Another concert will have taken place in New York at Carnegie Hall on 19 October). The World Orchestra for Peace is made up of the finest musicians on the planet, who volunteer to convene from time to time to deliver the message embodied by the orchestra's name. Solti did this: resurrecting a very 19th century, romantic and didactic purpose for music into the ravaged 20th century \u2013 and now the orchestra performs in his name, beyond his lifetime, into the ominous 21st. The concert will be conducted by <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valery_Gergiev\" title=\"\">Valery Gergiev</a>, and feature musicians who were part of Solti's mission to encourage newcomers and to hand on to future generations what he had learned from his own masters. Two great stars, <a href=\"http://www.angelagheorghiu.com/\" title=\"\">Angela Gheorghiu</a> and <a href=\"http://renepape.com/\" title=\"\">Ren\u00e9 Pape</a>, both of whom began the formative part of their careers with Solti, will be joined by as yet unknown young singers from the <a href=\"http://www.georgsoltiaccademia.org/\" title=\"\">Georg Solti Accademia</a>, a masterclass in bel canto singing which is held annually in Solti's Italian home of Castiglione della Pescaia.</p> <p>But Solti did so much more: he made music of magic and quality, entwining power and clarity, that no other interpreter of his time \u2013 not even Karajan, Jansons, Ancerl, B\u00f6hm or Bernstein, in what is rightly considered music's golden age \u2013 could match. In the studio, Solti revolutionised the science and art of recorded music so as to democratise it at the highest \u2013 still unsurpassed \u2013 level of atmosphere and sound quality. And in concert, Solti is the only name one can speak in the same breath as those that dominated the generation that preceded him \u2013 astride both the second world war and the iron curtain \u2013 Evgeny Mravinsky in Leningrad and Wilhelm Furtw\u00e4ngler in Berlin. Solti was the true heir to their legacy on record, and their way of electrifying live performance through blending restless and rigorous perfectionism with explosive&#xa0;spontaneity.</p> <p>Georg Solti was born Gy\u00f6rgy Stern, the son of Ter\u00e9z Rosenbaum and M\u00f3ricz Stern. At the end of the first world war Hungarians with Germanic surnames were encouraged to adopt Hungarian names. His parents kept the family's original surname but his father decided the children's names should be changed to help their careers. He chose Solti at random \u2013 the name of a small Hungarian town. Thus Georg kept the same initials, GS. In his autobiography, Solti describes his father as a businessman who \"trusted everyone and was often cheated\". Young Solti was admitted to the Academy of Music in Budapest, where he studied piano and composition, and thereafter became a repetiteur at the state opera.</p> <p>But as a Jew, Solti and many others employees of the opera house were dismissed once anti-Jewish laws came into force. As is still the case today, it is difficult for young conductors to find work so Solti went to Karlsruhe in Germany, where he was hired by the great <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josef_Krips\" title=\"\">Josef Krips</a>, who was duly denounced for hiring an Ostjude \u2013 a Jew from the east. In 1937, while attending rehearsals at the Salzburg festival, he was asked to replace one of Toscanini's assistants, who could not play because of illness. In 1938 the officials of the Hungarian Opera, having heard that Solti had worked with Toscanini, invited him to conduct a performance of <em>The Marriage of Figaro </em>with the Budapest Opera. The date was 11 March 1938. It was a great day for Solti and his family. Halfway through the performance the news broke of German troops marching into Vienna. The show ended and he never conducted an opera there again.</p> <p>The Hungarian composer Antal Dor\u00e1ti heard of his young friend's dilemma and invited him to join him for two weeks in London, conducting for Colonel de Basil's Ballets Russes. From there Solti made his way home where, in August 1939, \"at the age of 26,\" he wrote, \"I said goodbye to my mother and sister.\" At Budapest station he was seen off to Switzerland by his father on the very day that war was declared. \"I was never to see him again,\" Solti would write.</p> <p>There are remarkable pictures of Solti during his wartime years as a refugee in Zurich. In those days people made photographs of themselves into picture postcards, and Solti sent home cards of himself posing in Alpine dress outside his mountain chalet. He described himself as \"desperately lonely and depressed\" as he waited for war to end, though he occasionally conducted the Zurich orchestra in the Kleine (junior) Tonhalle.</p> <p>After the defeat of Nazi Germany, Solti was invited to \u2013 of all places \u2013 Munich. His decision to establish himself as a Jew among the ravages of the Reich was astonishingly foresighted; he was among the few to understand postwar Germany and Europe right at their inception, compelled by Winston Churchill's speech in Zurich inviting Germany and France to build a \"new Europe\" on the ashes of war. He also confessed: \"Like Faust, I would have been prepared to make a pact with the devil and go to hell with him in order to conduct.\" Directorship of the Bavarian State Opera in 1946 was his first and crucial post. \"It was a heroic time, both for Germany and for myself,\" he wrote. Lady Solti reflects: \"People asked: 'But how could you, as a Jew, go to Germany?' I think Gyuri [short for Gy\u00f6rgy] felt: look, we're all young people in our 30s, and it's our mission to create a Europe in which that cannot happen again. What were [we] to do with Germany? Put a barbed wire fence around it? But he didn't go there as a missionary \u2013 he went because he was offered a job. It was also fortuitous \u2013 Germany was de-Nazifying, and it must have been an amazing time.\"</p> <p>Solti moved on to Frankfurt, then London \u2013 succeeding Rafael Kubel\u00edk as director of Covent Garden in 1961, and by the mid-60s bringing the house to a zenith. Solti wrote later: \"I have a British wife and two British daughters, and British I shall remain\"; but also: \"I am a committed European,\" He was never really settled; his orchestral career was centred on the Vienna Philharmonic and Chicago, and he wrote later: \"My term as musical director of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra was the happiest time in my professional life.\" This was a Hungarian who as a refugee made Switzerland his home, then came to raise a family in London, had a house in Italy and an orchestra in America \u2013 a man without race or nation. Lady Solti says: \"He hated the term 'cosmopolitan'. Let's say he was a man who had lost his family and his country, so that home was wherever his own family was, and wherever he was making music. He was a person of the world; with a deep sense of the world, and a belief in the new Europe, right from its very beginning.\"</p> <p>It is hard to express what it is that elevates a great artist over a very good one, and impossible to account for the creative sorcery which enables someone like Solti to tower even above the greats, to achieve what he could with an orchestra, on record and in performance. There are certain composers on whose work Solti has stamped his mark with a distinction that has never been equalled, nor probably ever will be, so that his conduit of their intentions has become integral to the experience of listening to them: Wagner, Strauss and Mozart arguably \u2013 Mahler unquestionably. I remember sitting enthralled \u2013 even in adolescence, knowing little of the context \u2013 ear-to-the-speaker with my new edition of <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Mahler-Symphony-No-2-Resurrection/dp/B001LOKFPO\" title=\"\">Mahler's <em>Resurrection</em> Symphony</a>, bought with pocket money. And in concert: Solti's shattering Mahler Ninth at the Royal Festival Hall with the Chicago orchestra in 1981 left anyone who heard it dazed with wonderment. It is due almost entirely to Solti that Mahler's music moved from relative obscurity in the early 1960s to the sell-out position it now occupies in the performing repertoire.</p> <p>Lady Solti is captivating on her husband's discovery of Mahler: \"I think he recognised the sounds in Mahler as those of where he came from. He knew some of those sounds intuitively, the cowbells, they called to his intuition, and were familiar to him. He would say: this music is wonderful but we never hear it.\"</p> <p>Just as Solti had understood the new Germany while most (in his and every field) were still mired in wartime thinking, he also understood the need to perform and record Wagner. Richard Wagner was seen after the war as the composer whose antisemitism and interpretation of Teutonic myth was adulated, some would say kidnapped, by the Nazis. Yet it was his music Solti now performed to a standard no one but perhaps F\u00fcrtwangler had achieved. (But then F\u00fcrtwangler was \u2013 albeit as a man of genius fraught with political dichotomies \u2013 conductor of the Berlin Philharmonic under the Third Reich.)</p> <p>\"Maybe,\" says Lady Solti, \"he knew the full background and chose not to take any heed. Or maybe he just wiped all that from his mind when it came to Wagner. I honestly don't know. But I do know that people just did not talk about the horrors at that time. They were not looking back because they were looking forward with their duty to make a new and better world.\"</p> <p>She continues talking about her husband \"wanting to live every moment\". This was, she says, \"part, I am sure, of the survival thing he always had, like every Jewish-central-European of his age. He was Jewish with all that means in terms of the history of his generation \u2013 with an understanding of people and of survival that Anglo-Saxons have never really had to learn. I think the survival thing is crucial.</p> <p>\"He had a sense of the beauty in all things, something I would call spiritual rather than religious. He told me his father would pray when eating the first fruit of the season. I remember so clearly the special moment for Solti when he ate the first apricot, cherry or peach in Italy. He loved animals and birds and used to ask, 'How can humans kill animals and birds for food?' He loved listening to the birds singing in the trees, and he would whistle to them and they in turn would answer him, because of course he had perfect pitch. He loved the sea \u2013 looking at it and swimming in it \u2013 but disliked sailing on it.\"</p> <p>He took pleasure even in the little things, and would be \"ridiculously happy winning at games \u2013 ping-pong, tennis, cards or bridge, particularly if he bid a grand slam and made it. He loved trains and railway stations, and introduced me to the glories of station buffets, particularly the one in Lausanne in Switzerland and the Gare de Lyon in Paris. He had such an enthusiasm about everything he did and wanted to share everything \u2013 food, music, nature, jokes, literature. It was the same with music \u2013 the joy of working with an orchestra he loved, the joy of being with his musician friends, and the pleasure of working with the musicians around him and sharing the music.</p> <p>\"He was a working musician,\" Lady Solti continues, \"fundamentally a working musician. Although he became a star he was also an artisan, working with and for the music. He used to say: 'No matter what statements I make, no matter who I know and what receptions I go to, I am first and foremost a musician \u2013 that is what I am: a musician at the service of the composer whose music I am playing.'\"</p> <p>Solti was known by everyone he met or worked with for a blend of striving and of perfectionism \u2013 for pursuing the unattainable, never satisfied with what he had achieved, however magnificent it was hailed as being. \"He once said,\" says Lady Solti: \"'If ever I tell you that was a good performance, you know I am not well.'\". In his autobiography Solti describes how he learned from F\u00fcrtwangler \u2013 of whom he speaks as something like the teacher he never had \u2013 \"that all serious artists are often dissatisfied with their work\".</p> <p>There was another riptide cutting beneath this dissatisfaction, this striving: \"Gyuri used to say that the musician is the servant of the composer, and no one could ever be certain exactly what the composer's intention was, they could only try their best. Perhaps that was a reason he was never satisfied.\" Although he loved accolades, he always said that nothing in his entire career had made him happier than when he was playing the piano for a rehearsal in Salzburg in 1937, and felt a presence behind him. It was Toscanini, and Toscanini simply said: \"Bene.\"</p> <p>\"Gyuri always said that no accolade in his entire life matched that single word from Toscanini.\"</p> <p>In 1969 Solti became music director of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra. It was in the windy city that Solti became so rooted in local lore that his image was used on posters to advertise both the orchestra and the Bears football team, under the slogan: \"We both know a good score\".</p> <p>\"If he had a musical home,\" says Lady Solti, \"it must surely be Chicago.\" And yet, for a family with two daughters, \"this was a compromise. I'm an only child, and he had no family \u2013 so here were these two desperate creatures, with two lovely little girls \u2013 but no family structure apart from my parents. We thought, in our innocence, we could do it all. For him, it was the music and the joie de vivre, and for me \u2013 well, I just hit the ground running \u2013 and I still am in a way. Initially, the girls went to school in London and Chicago but it didn't really work. So from that point onwards the schedule in Chicago was planned years ahead to incorporate school holidays, and we'd go to faraway places and the girls would travel with us. But in summer we would all go to Italy where the maestro had his studio in the garden and divided his time between studying and spending time with the children.</p> <p>\"People would ask: 'Where do you live? Where's home?' \u2013 and it was difficult to say. It would have been nice to have a little cottage with roses round the door but that didn't come into it really.\" Lady Solti throws back her head, laughing. \"We were Gypsies, nomads \u2013 we always thought it would be fantastic to have some kind of amphibious, aeronautical caravan and trailer that could fly and sail to wherever we wanted. That would have been my dream.\"</p> <p>For the last twenty years of his life, Solti engaged one man to be something like a master of ceremonies, an executive director who made sure that the conditions were right for the music-making, keeper of the gates marked budget and logistics.</p> <p>Charles Kaye, now director of the World Orchestra for Peace, remembers being told: \"I'm looking for someone who can look after all this\" and thinking: \"What can I bring to this? I'd worked with Lucia Popp, Nicolai Gedda, Askenazy \u2013 but Solti was God in this world.\"</p> <p>Kaye gives a description of Solti at work: \"He would look at a work he had performed a hundred times before, but was still excited to see a new, unmarked score. And he's start to mark it; first in pencil, then in red\" \u2013 and Kaye produces, across the table of a friend's kitchen in Hampstead, a score by Brahms, thick with annotations and notes; a soft, probably 2B pencil, then the red crayon.</p> <p>\"What he did better than anyone else in the world was <em>study</em> the music, and turn his ideas into action. You could watch him working it out, having a hundred ideas a minute for a recording or a performance, the cast or conditions he wanted. My job was to enable him to work in the best conditions possible \u2013 what would Solti need in order to make this performance or recording the best possible \u2013 and send the shopping list ahead. Occasionally I'd have to say something like 'We'll never get that past Decca', but there was no saying no, unless there was a very good reason.\"</p> <p>It is incontestable that Solti both revolutionised recorded music and set a standard of sound that has never been attained since. His Wagner <em>Ring</em> cycle from the 1960s was recently crowned by B<em>BC Music Magazine</em> as the <a href=\"http://wpr.org/music/BBC-Music-Top-50-1201.pdf\" title=\"\">greatest recording feat of all time</a>. Solti assembled around him a group of producers and engineers who became known as \"the Decca boys\" under John Culshaw at a time when the British label was at its zenith. \"At the time,\" says Lady Solti, \"when television was new, and later with the advent of colour television and the development of video, there was also an excitement around what could be done for the gramophone after the advent of the long-playing record.\" A democratic urge was at work in Solti's enterprise \u2013 that the mass dissemination of music in the home should be of the highest quality.</p> <p>And there was also science. John Pellowe joined the Decca boys as a young engineer from north London who \"didn't make it to university\" but was blessed with synesthesia \u2013 seeing music as a series of colours. Not a great musician, but instinctive about music at a time when Britain led the world in acoustics and gramophone equipment \u2013 Wharfedale, Kef and Quad. \"The idea that we could make recorded music with breadth and width like that,\" says Pellowe, \"enabled a whole new generation, a new era, in music. And Solti had a real passion for the studio \u2013 he fuelled the central tenets of what the philosophy of recording became. It was something primaeval \u2013 he knew what he wanted. Solti was fascinated by acoustics, by an acoustic space. He understood that the acoustic space can be just as important as the notes on the score or quality of the musicians.\"</p> <p>Pellowe adds something the truth of which matters less than the fact that he feels it: \"Valerie may disagree with this but I think he saw his recording career as more important than his concert conducting career. A studio is a studio, and Solti understood what that meant.\"</p> <p>Pellowe would record with Solti in Kingsway Hall in Holborn, \"a scruffy old place he loved to work in\", and the Sofiensaal in Vienna, \"an old swimming pool boarded over to make a dusty old ballroom, with a lovely acoustic, though a little small for Wagner\". With his team, Solti established a system of recording with what Pellowe calls \"the Decca tree\" of three omni-directional microphones 10ft 6in above ground to capture the sweep of the sound as it flew over the conductor's head, then more directional mics to spotlight the woodwind and the back of the orchestra. \"We used fewer mics than our competitors but I think to greater effect,\" he says.</p> <p>Recordings were made, Pellowe recalls, in \"long sessions, whole movements \u2013 not little slices like some conductors. Solti would play it back, listen while marking up his score, and go back to do some sections again.\"</p> <p>But there was a human element to this: \"Solti would talk directly to me, unlike most others. It was not the common situation, where you have the conductor talking to the producers who then relay the information. Solti consulted everybody; it was a team effort, and Solti was part of that team. And when it was done, he'd throw parties for all of us. No one was taken for granted. That's what made it special, and that's how he was the greatest influence on all our lives, certainly mine.\"</p> <p>Pellowe went on to devise the revolutionary \"constellation system\", the creation of an electronic \"stage shell\" around an orchestra playing in a vast or outdoor arena but hearing itself as though in a perfect acoustic setting. He concludes: \"Whatever I do is the legacy of working with Solti.\"</p> <p>With its origins in an orchestra assembled at Buckingham Palace for Solti's 80th birthday in 1992, and a project at Carnegie Hall bringing together musicians from the conservatoires of America, the World Orchestra for Peace staged its first concert in 1995 in Geneva to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the founding of the United Nations. But the timing could not have been more horribly ironic: Solti conducted a fine performance for the UN members and secretary-general Boutros-Boutros Ghali. Just a few days later, only an hour's flight from Geneva, UN soldiers delivered the people of their own UN-declared \"safe area\" of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Srebrenica_massacre\" title=\"\">Srebrenica</a> to execution squads under the command of General Ratko Mladic, currently on trial for genocide, and looked on as 8,000 men and boys were taken to be summarily massacred by Bosnian Serbs.</p> <p>The international peace orchestra fared better than the organisation it celebrated. It was, says Lady Solti, \"a notion that some thought untenable at first until Solti turned round during the first rehearsal and said: 'It works!' From that moment it became a gathering of the best and most committed orchestral players in the world.\"</p> <p>It performed \u2013 among many other extraordinary concerts \u2013 Mahler's 5th Symphony under Gergiev at Krakow to mark the 60th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz. And next month the orchestra marks Solti's birth in 1912. The concert takes place in Chicago rather than Solti's birthplace of Budapest but includes Concerto for Orchestra by B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k, the composer next to whose grave Solti is himself buried.</p> <p>Clarinettist Larry Combs and horn player Gail Williams are husband and wife, and play for both the Chicago Symphony and World Orchestra for Peace. \"It's such a thrill to play with the best of the best from all over the world,\" says Combs. \"I sit next to a man called Viktor Kulik in the clarinet section \u2013 I speak no Russian, he speaks no English, with only the music to communicate \u2013 so that we understand each other perfectly!\"</p> <p>Combs recalls: \"When we started, no one thought an orchestra of people who did not know each other could work at this level of quality \u2013 but it does, equally well with Gergiev as it did with Solti.\"</p> <p>His wife, Gail Williams, says of Solti: \"It's one thing to be a talented musician, as many are today, but they don't have a plan, like Mr Solti did. He had this bigger picture beyond the symphony or the opera itself. I was young when I joined, and he infused me with the greater colours of sound and his rhythmical integrity \u2013 he was like a metronome. He said what he thought and wanted, and made us think about that bigger musical plan. And his expectations were high: he had not only learned the piece before we first sat down to work but lived with it \u2013 and he demanded of us to have done the same.\"</p> <p>During the months leading up to his sudden death in 1997, BBC's <em>Omnibus</em> programme made a serendipitously important film with and about Solti. It is charged with poignant exuberance rather than sadness; it bursts with Solti's wise effervescence, even in old age, perhaps especially in old age, as he returns to face the country he had left. Solti reflects and talks his way through a visit of homage to his grandparents' grave, a performance of music by children from his home village in the presence of its young mayor; he walks the corridors \u2013 and revisits students in the practice room \u2013 of his alma mater, the Liszt Academy. And he sits, at the programme's end, on a bench looking over Lake Balaton where he swam as a child.</p> <p>He died a few weeks later. He is buried in Hungary, and the inscription on his grave is one word: \"Hazat\" (\"has come home\").</p>",

  "<p>Will Gompertz gives the game away with the title. As he writes in the introduction, his book is aimed at people who suspect that modern and contemporary art is a sham, \"but, now that fashions have changed, find that it is not socially acceptable to say so\". If you are one of these people, you might love this book. But if you don't think the art of the last 150 years is a sham, you might slowly lose patience with the <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/thereporters/willgompertz/about-will-gompertz.html\" title=\"\">BBC's arts editor</a>.</p> <p>Gompertz has written an energetic and comprehensive romp through modern art, starting unusually early in the 19th century and continuing right up to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/ai-weiwei\" title=\"\">Ai Weiwei</a>. He's got them all in, from Courbet to Rothko to Hirst. Although his book is short on illustrations for a beginner's guide, it's a well-balanced history. He gives the right amount of space to the European postwar avant garde including Lucio Fontana, Yves Klein and Joseph Beuys. At the end there is an appropriate page or two about the dealer <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/calebmelby/2012/05/03/larry-gagosian-andy-warhol-and-the-rise-of-the-superdealer/\" title=\"\">Larry Gagosian</a>, who with 11 galleries dotted around the world's capital cities embodies the hyper-commerciality of art today.</p> <p>It's refreshingly up-to-the minute, as you might expect from an arts correspondent \u2013 there's a vivid description of MoMA's 2010 <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/12/arts/design/12abromovic.html?pagewanted=all\" title=\"\">blockbuster exhibition</a> with performance artist Marina Abramovic. There's a good section on female modernists, who were not treated seriously enough by their fellow male artists or, until recently, by curators and historians. And Gompertz doesn't make the mistake of many more analytical critics, including <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/aug/13/robert-hughes-art-nick-kent\" title=\"\">Robert Hughes</a> and <a href=\"http://www.columbia.edu/cu/arthistory/faculty/Krauss.html\" title=\"\">Rosalind Krauss</a>, of finding all modern art totally brilliant until they get to the last 10 years.</p> <p>He reorients modern art, as other recent art historians have done, away from cubism and painting and towards&#xa0;Duchamp and the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Readymades_of_Marcel_Duchamp\" title=\"\">readymade</a>.&#xa0;This is the fashionable thing to do because it helps make sense of Warhol and Hirst, but it's not the be-all and end-all.

He says postmodernism has been replaced by \"entrepreneurialism\", though to my mind cynicism would be a better word.</p> <p>Yet this is a patchy book, its language often formulaic. Duchamp, we're told, enjoyed the \"sensuous charms\" of New York and \"the sun's warm embrace\". The descriptions of artists and their milieus are frequently cartoon-like. Gompertz's portraits of the alcoholic genius Jackson Pollock and the libidinous, bargain-hunting collector Peggy Guggenheim do not feel insightful. In the final chapter, after enthusing about Banksy, he writes: \"If Marcel Duchamp were alive today he would be a street artist.\" Really? The ultra-theoretical cool-headed conceptualist who spent much of his life living off the super-rich? I don't think so.</p> <p>Gompertz's criticism is zesty, resolutely non-theoretical and often ends in dubious hyperbole. Sol LeWitt's <a href=\"http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=Sol+Le+Witt%E2%80%99s+sculptures+of+cubes&amp;hl=en&amp;prmd=imvnso&amp;tbm=isch&amp;tbo=u&amp;source=univ&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=dk0_UIvRAsbJ0QWapICgDA&amp;ved=0CCcQsAQ&amp;biw=1456&amp;bih=1015\" title=\"\">sculptures of cubes</a> apparently relate to the space age because they were \"exploring the same principles at the same time as scientists were designing rockets to put man on the moon\". He indulges in that common failing of art criticism: the deployment of phrases that could be applied to a thousand artists. Pollock's drip paintings express \"unfettered emotion\". Gauguin has \"the ability to communicate ideas and feelings universal to us all in a unique way\". Still, he does wittily describe Marc Quinn's <em>Blood Head</em> as a \"sorbet\".</p> <p>The real problem with this book is not the art history but the reader that it constructs. It's not surprising that Gompertz \u2013 BBC arts editor since 2009 \u2013 should have adopted the approach he does because TV executives today all make the same mistake of imagining that their \"audience\" don't know anything about, and don't much like, contemporary art. But most people I meet are pretty clued-up about it, and I've hardly ever met anyone under 70 who thinks that Duchamp's urinal or <a href=\"http://peterjamesfield.blogspot.co.uk/2010/10/carl-andre-and-me.html\" title=\"\">Carl Andre's bricks</a> shouldn't be considered art. Gompertz writes that an <a href=\"http://www.anthonycaro.org/frames-related/Gallery.htm\" title=\"\">Anthony Caro sculpture</a> \"at first glance appears to be the sort of twisted configurations a young child might make out of pipe-cleaners and cardboard\". It doesn't to me, and never did. Gompertz is contradictory, because at the same time he is always reminding the reader \u2013 correctly \u2013 that we live in an age where art is more popular and visible than ever before.</p> <p>Reading this book made me feel like an old fogey who worries that life and culture are leaving them behind and they'd better make an effort to catch up. I felt better remembering myself as the 14-year-old I once was, falling in love with art but knowing little about it, daunted by thick, complicated volumes&#xa0;of history. For such a person, this book would work well \u2013 but you'd need to follow it up quickly with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2005/may/14/highereducation.news\" title=\"\"><em>Art Since 1900</em></a> by Hal Foster, Rosalind Krauss and others, which is at the serious but still digestible end of the modern art history spectrum.</p> <p><em>Ben Lewis is an art critic, presenter and author </em></p>",
  "<p><strong>Your new novel, <em>Zoo Time</em>, features a publisher who has committed suicide, an agent in hiding and a novelist harangued by book groups. Is publishing doomed?</strong></p> <p>It's not my experience that my publisher shot himself or my agent is always hiding from me but I wouldn't have written it if I didn't think there was something worrying about, not so much publishing, but the state of the book\u2026 some of the things that I play with, some of the jokes I make, attack things that need to be attacked.</p> <p><strong>You write acerbically about genre fiction\u2026</strong></p> <p>I'm contemptuous of genre things... You go into a good bookshop like Foyles and see a kind of \"vampire room\". I was sitting in the American Embassy a while back, trying to get a visa, and every woman in the room was reading the vampire series \u2013 you know, the one with the black cover and the bit of blood. Now people are reading soft porn! What happened to the fun of reading a good book? There are people who, when they say they prefer Henry James to <em>Fifty Shades of Grey</em>, they do actually mean that.</p> <p><strong>Your protagonist, middle-aged novelist Guy Ableman, gets collared by a furious woman at a book group. Did that happen to you?</strong></p> <p>Reading groups should be the most wonderful things but every time you go to one you hear the most terrible things\u2026 That scene has actually happened to me. I have had someone say \"The only character I identified with was the one who was dead.\" It makes me want to lecture them. You do not, when you read a novel, identify with a character. Lear was a horrible father. Othello was not a man you want to be married to.</p> <p><strong>This is your first novel since winning the 2010 Man Booker prize for </strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/fiction/9781408809938/the-finkler-question\" title=\"\"><strong><em>The Finkler Question</em></strong></a><strong>. Was it hard to follow up?</strong></p> <p>I don't know because this book was half-written when I won. As soon as I finished <em>The Finkler Question</em>, I was in despair. I'd changed my English publisher because they'd been lukewarm about it and not offered enough money. The American publisher didn't like it. The Canadian publisher didn't like it\u2026 I'd been bleeding readers since my first novel and I could see my own career going down. I thought: people don't get the joke, they don't get that something can be funny and sad. It's over, I thought. If I was going to do another book, it would have to be wildly funny. I'm good at comedy when I'm feeling down. So I started writing <em>Zoo Time</em> and had a marvellous time. I think it's the funniest novel I've ever written. And then I won the fucking Man Booker! It was the biggest joke of all. Because how can you write a novel about literary failure when you've won the Booker?</p> <p><strong>Did winning make you happier?</strong></p> <p>I could feel quieter and happier, winning that prize. It was like they were saying \"OK, we get it now\", because I felt I'd been working away at the edges for years. It was nothing to do with antisemitism but I felt I had a voice that was not quite suitable \u2013 like having too loud a voice for a quiet room. I feel that voice has been accepted. It is a Jewish voice. And because this isn't America, it took longer to accept. In America, post-Scott Fitzgerald, they're all Jewish or aspiring to be.</p> <p><strong>What do you make of the term \"literary fiction\"?</strong></p> <p>I hate the phrase \"literary fiction\". I write fiction. The others write crap.</p> <p><strong>Does your wife [television producer Jenny de Yong] read your manuscripts?</strong></p> <p>She's the first port of call. I give her the manuscript only when it's finished, then I stay out of her hair for three or four days. The house goes very still. I hear the pages turning and sometimes I listen at her study to hear if she's crying or laughing. There's only one novel where she's said, \"This could be the end of our marriage but this book isn't working.\" I called the publisher and said they'd have to wait a bit longer for it.</p> <p><strong>What book was that?</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/oct/05/fiction\" title=\"\"><em>The Act of Love</em></a>. It's not a very English book. It's about sexual perversion.</p> <p><strong>Does she still have the Mulberry handbag you bought her with the Booker prize money?</strong></p> <p>Yes, she's still using it. The number of people who didn't get that joke, who said to me \"Have you really spent the whole \u00a350,000 on a handbag?\"</p> <p><strong>You used to sell handbags for a living\u2026</strong></p> <p>My dad had a market stall and whenever you're in trouble for money, as I was when I was teaching in Cambridge, you turned to markets. I sold them for about three years in the late 60s, early 70s. Sometimes my students would help me out and I'd give them supervisions on the stall.</p> <p><strong>As an undergraduate, you were taught by </strong><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F._R._Leavis\" title=\"\"><strong>FR Leavis</strong></a><strong>. What was he like?</strong></p> <p>Gentlemanly and courteous. He was funny, much more than you'd realise, and more generous about literature than his reputation would suggest.</p> <p><strong>Do you see a similar disconnect between your reputation and who you really are?</strong></p> <p>I did at one point. Early on, people thought I was louche and wild and provocative. Now I worry that I've over-mellowed\u2026 I'm tame now, aren't I? I'm just a National Treasure. People want to pat me. One of my agents once said I was one of the most dangerous men in London and I was so excited by that. For a few days, I walked around Soho snarling.</p> <p><strong>Maybe you're more content now?</strong></p> <p>I am happy but I wonder if that makes me less interesting. But I am \u2013 what can I do about it? I've been married several times and now I'm with the person I want to be with and that's a stroke of luck. I've always said if a woman is looking for a good husband, she should go for a Jewish man past 60. Jewish men are essentially brought up to love women. Then you rebel against that and become a bit of a bastard. Then at 60, you revert.</p> <p><strong>Did your father, Max, read your novels?</strong></p> <p>He couldn't. He was barely literate\u2026 He would just stare at the cover. The first book I ever wrote was dedicated to my parents and it upsets me to tell this story still but he thought I'd taken the book out to the printer and got them to print his name on that copy. My mother, on the other hand, read me avidly.</p> <p><strong>You've talked in the past about \"Jewish intelligence\". What is it?</strong></p> <p>It's an over-commitment to disputatiousness, the love of an argument, the love of exaggeration.</p> <p><strong>On <em>Desert Island Discs,</em> you took freshly ironed shirts and trousers as your luxury. Why?</strong></p> <p>It's a fetish... I don't like what men wear. I've never owned a T-shirt. I don't like vests or sweaters or cardies with zips. I like a proper shirt with a collar. There's nothing else that I think I look nice in. I don't think there's anything else that other men look nice in, to be honest. Things with words on! Can you imagine? On grown-ups! Words are to make books&#xa0;with.</p>",
  "<h2>MEN'S T54 MARATHON</h2> <p><strong>Central London, 11.30am </strong>Approximately 200,000 people lined the streets to watch the Olympic marathon and similar, if not larger, numbers must be expected to turn out to see if David Weir can win an extraordinary fourth gold medal in the Mall.</p> <p>It's a huge ask but Weir won his sixth London marathon this year in a field where seven seconds separated the top seven finishers so the crowd should witness a fantastic battle whatever happens. However, he not only faces his rival from earlier races, Marcel Hug, as well as the world record holder, Heinz Frei, but more importantly, Kurt Fearnley.</p> <p>The Australian is the 2011 world champion and has avoided competing in multiple marathons this year to put all his energy and focus into the bare hour-and-a-half that athletes take to complete the 26.2mile course, but said in July that he expected: \"The guy who wins the marathon, I think will also medal in the shorter distances.\" Making it advantage Weir. Don't miss it.</p> <h2>WOMEN'S T54 MARATHON</h2> <p><strong>Central London, 11.31am</strong></p> <p>Starting just after the men's race, Great Britain also have an excellent contender in the women's event. Shelly Woods, who took bronze at Beijing in the 5,000m is strongest over the longest distance and won this year's London marathon by almost four minutes, ahead of Japan's world champion, Wakako Tsuchida.</p> <h2>MEN'S T12/T46 MARATHON</h2> <p><strong>Central London, 8am </strong>The race for the visually impaired (T12) and amputee (T46) athletes opens the day's events and in T12 the current world champion, Spain's Alberto Suarez Laso, looks at the top of his form, although Colombia's Elkin Serna Moreno is his closest challenger. The T46 should offer a closer fight with world and paralympic champion, Mexico's Mario Santillan facing off with Brazil's Tito Sena and Spain's Abderrahman Ait Khamouch.</p> <h2>MEN'S 7-A-SIDE FOOTBALL</h2> <p><strong>Riverbank Arena </strong>ParalympicsGB were pipped into the 7/8 place play-off (8.30am) with the USA after a 4-3 defeat to Argentina who face Holland in the 5/6 place play-off (11am) but the big one is the final between Russia and Ukraine (4pm). It is Ukraine's chance to take the title for a third time in a row and for added drama a repeat of the 2008 final where they beat Russia 2-1 in extra time, both goals scored by their outstanding player and current captain Volodymyr Antonyuk.</p> <h2>WHEELCHAIR RUGBY FINAL</h2> <p><strong>Basketball Arena, 2.15pm </strong>Having proved hugely popular with the crowds, Great Britain's failure to reach a medal match was disappointing, partly due to an unlikely defeat to a Japan who reached the semi-finals. But Sunday's final should nonetheless be gripping. It pits Canada, who invented the game, against Australia, arguably the best side in the world. Too tight to call, it is the perfect final and should make for top-end murderball.</p> <h2>WEATHERWATCH</h2> <p>Sunny but punishing: 20C rising to 26C by 1pm, a real test for the athletes.</p> <h2>THE CLOSING CEREMONY</h2> <p><strong>Olympic Stadium, 8.30pm </strong>Entitled the 'Festival of Flame' and drawing on themes based on earth, wind, water, fire and ice, the ceremony has been put together by the artistic director of the Olympic finale, Kim Gavin.</p> <p>That it will be spectacular seems a given but a less all-encompassing and more straightforward show is expected here, which should avoid some of the woeful choices Gavin made on his first run. So, don't expect dreary, plod-rockers the Kaiser Chiefs playing Pinball Wizard, <em>while the Who were actually in the stadium</em>, dreary clod-hopper George Michael shamelessly plugging his new single, or dreary pop-fopper Russell Brand ruining I am The Walrus.</p> <p>Instead, expect Coldplay. Lots of Coldplay. A set that must be odds-on to last longer than this morning's T54 marathon will be livened up by duets with Rihanna and, say the rumours, Jay-Z.</p>",
  "<p>Spalding railway station in Lincolnshire is not a big place. It takes me about two seconds to scan the platform and spot who I'm looking for: <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2011/aug/01/lulzsec-alleged-hacker-released-on-bail\" title=\"\">Jake Davis</a>, aka Topiary, the computer hacker who at one point last year was the subject of one of the biggest manhunts on the planet.</p> <p>For a period in 2011, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/lulzsec\" title=\"\">LulzSec</a> \u2013 an offshoot of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/anonymous\" title=\"\">Anonymous</a>, the internet \"hacktivist\" collective who came to prominence around the time of the Wikileaks affair \u2013 wreaked a trail of chaos across the web. Their actions ranged from the transgressive \u2013 they had <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2011/jun/16/cia-website-lulzsec-hackers\" title=\"\">taken down</a> the CIA's website and hacked into Sony's database and released more than a million user names and passwords \u2013 to the absurd: after the American network PBS aired a critical documentary about Julian Assange, LulzSec hacked into their website and replaced the homepage with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2011/may/31/pbs-victim-hackers-wikileaks\" title=\"\">an article</a> about Tupac Shakur, the (very much dead) rapper, which bore the headline \"Tupac Still Alive in New Zealand\". During the Arab spring, members of the group hacked and defaced Tunisian and Egyptian government sites. One hacker, <a href=\"http://thenextweb.com/uk/2011/07/20/16-year-old-leading-member-of-lulzsec-reportedly-in-custody-after-sting/\" title=\"\">Tflow</a> (later discovered to be a 16-year-old London schoolboy), allegedly wrote a webscript that enabled activists to circumvent government snooping.</p> <p>LulzSec had also hacked into the website of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2011/jun/21/soca-website-hacking-lulzsec\" title=\"\">Soca</a>, the UK's Serious Organised Crime Agency, and replaced the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2011/jul/18/sun-website-hacked-lulzsec\" title=\"\">front page of the <em>Sun</em></a> online with a \"report\" that Rupert Murdoch had been found dead (with a helpful hint for the FBI in the closing paragraph: he'd been found, it said, \"in his famous topiary garden\").</p> <p>For a time, LulzSec demanded and caught the world's attention. Their tweets made headlines. Their jokes were retweeted by thousands. And there, waiting for me at Spalding station, is LulzSec's PR guru. \"Look out for the pale kid that needs a haircut,\" he'd texted me. And he's not wrong. He is quite pale and could do with a haircut. And he's impossibly young: just 19. A skinny teenager with a soft Scottish accent who \u2013 for a period of time last year, during \"the 50 days of Lulz\" \u2013 ran rings around law enforcement agencies on several continents.</p> <p>Of course, I already know what Jake Davis looks like, because in July last year, Davis, then 18, was arrested at his home in the Shetland Isles. And after being charged with five hacking-related crimes and released on bail, he emerged into the sun outside Westminster magistrates court for the world to see. Anonymous suddenly had a face: and the face was of a furtive, greasy-haired youth, wearing a pair of dark glasses and carrying a book called <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/jul/15/science-culture-books-review\" title=\"\"><em>Free Radicals: The Secret Anarchy of Science</em></a>. If you had to imagine what a teenage computer hacker would look like, this was it.</p> <p>The episode was front-page news on websites across the world, as a string of arrests were made: 19-year-old Ryan Cleary from Essex; 16-year-old Tflow from London; 27-year-old Jeremy Hammond from Chicago; a 25-year-old former soldier, Ryan Ackroyd, from Doncaster; 19-year-old Darren Martyn (or PwnSauce), from Galway, and Donncha O'Cearrbhail (or Palladium), also 19 and from Offaly, Ireland. The most <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/aug/29/lulzsec-hacker-arrest-sony-attack\" title=\"\">recent arrest</a>, 12 days ago, was of another American, 20-year-old Raynaldo Rivera of Arizona.</p> <p>In March this year came the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/mar/06/lulzsec-sabu-working-for-us-fbi\" title=\"\">news of how it happened</a>: the FBI had turned a LulzSec member in New York, a 28-year-old Puerto Rican father of two called Hector Xavier Monsegur, known online as \"Sabu\", and used him as their informant. It was like <em>The Sopranos</em>, but instead of organised crime and Italian hitmen it involved teenagers sitting at computer screens. And perhaps most confusing of all, the vast majority of the main players seemed to be living in Britain or Ireland.</p> <p>Gabriella Coleman, professor of scientific and technological literacy at McGill University, in Montreal, probably knows more about Anonymous than anybody on the planet. She has studied them from the moment they first emerged as a new political force in 2008, and says that it's no coincidence that so many of the arrests were of British and Irish nationals. Anonymous is a vast, new, poorly understood global force who specialise in \"ultra-co-ordinated motherfuckery\", as one of Coleman's contacts puts it. And it attracts a huge British following.</p> <p>In the chatrooms where Anons gather, Parmy Olson, a London-based journalist with <em>Forbes</em> magazine, found the British connection blindingly obvious. Her book, <em>We Are Anonymous: Inside the Hacker World of LulzSec, Anonymous, and the Global Cyber Insurgency</em>, published in America this June, offers a brilliant insight into the hacktivists' world. Almost by accident, Olson charted the emergence and domination of LulzSec, following the twists and turns of the story as it happened. \"And,\" she says, \"you could just see a lot of people talking about British things, British television shows, they were speaking with English spellings. You could tell they were British.\"</p> <p>Olson met Jake Davis before he reverted to Jake Davis \u2013 when he was still Topiary \u2013 in the Shetlands. \"It took a day and a half just to get there,\" she says. \"And it was embarrassing really. He was one of the most wanted hackers on the planet, and he just seemed so young.\"</p> <p>A year is a long time, though, when you're 18. I'd been expecting a socially awkward geek, but Davis turns out to be open-faced, chatty, good at eye contact and not geeky at all, though this may have something to do with the fact that he hasn't been allowed access to the internet for more than 12 months. He's pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit computer misuse under the Computer Misuse Act and is back in court in April next year. He's also waiting to see if he'll stand trial on another charge: conspiracy to commit fraud (the CPS is currently assessing whether a trial is in the public interest, given that he's already pleaded guilty to the first charge). He's currently at liberty on condition that he wears an electronic tag, is home by 10pm, and lives with his mum (who moved to Spalding shortly before his arrest).</p> <p>And that he goes nowhere near the internet. His only means of communicating with the outside world is a mobile phone that looks like it was a recent model circa 1995. And the greatest surprise \u2013 not just to me, but to him \u2013 is that he's barely missing the internet at all. \"I actually feel a lot better within myself. My life was the internet, pretty much. It was chatting on the internet and amassing groups of friends. And I had no life outside it. A year ago I would just be head-down kind of walking along, mumbling monosyllabically.\"</p> <p>It's that lack of contact with the outside world that has led Jake Davis to me. He helped Parmy Olson with her book, and he seems keen to have some form of communication with the outside world. Because communicating was both his speciality and what got him into this mess in the first place.</p> <p>\"Living in the Shetlands, I didn't understand the impact of what we were doing,\" he says. \"I didn't understand the impact on the real world. And now that I'm here in Spalding, and I've been a lot in London, I kind of see that the world does go round and it's not about hiding in a bedroom.\"</p> <p>What seems incredible, even now (and maybe, especially, to Jake), is how a slightly troubled teenager living on the two-sheep island of Yell, in the Shetland Isles \u2013 a place as isolated and remote as anywhere on Earth \u2013 came to find himself at the heart of a radical global political movement.</p> <p>But then, maybe that's the point. When I met Gabriella Coleman in Edinburgh she'd spent the previous evening meeting one of her contacts, who lived in a remote croft in the Scottish countryside. \"He cooked me pheasant,\" she said. Olson, too, found that a disproportionate number of contacts she met \"lived in out-of-the-way places\".</p> <p>For Jake, living in the Shetlands, the internet became his everything. It was where he made friends and socialised. \"It's where I learned almost everything I now know. The thing I miss the most is Wikipedia. I mean, at school I learned to knit. I'm actually a pretty good knitter now.\" Jake had a somewhat difficult childhood, and that (combined with the knitting lessons) led him to drop out of school at 13, shortly after his stepfather was killed in an accident.</p> <p>What's surprising, at first, is that he's not unhappy that he was caught, or that he faces the prospect of several years in prison. \"People say that prison is bad, but I lived in my bedroom with a computer for years. It's not going to be as bad as that. I just want to go and do my sentence and get my education in there. I want to get a really good education and just read loads of books.\"</p> <p>That's if he doesn't get extradited \u2013 because he's been charged in America, too, where his fellow hackers are facing up to 20 years inside. By contrast, in Ireland no charges have been brought against the arrested hackers. Anonymous may be an international phenomenon but there's no consensus (yet) on how to police the internet.</p> <p>What's immediately apparent about Jake Davis (and about a lot of the people involved with Anonymous) is just how bright and intelligent he is. And how the internet is where they find an outlet for their intellect \u2013 an outlet that somehow seems to have eluded them in real life. \"These weren't just normal individuals who found themselves in extraordinary circumstances,\" says Parmy Olson. \"They really were extraordinary individuals in extraordinary circumstances.\"</p> <p>What I find so interesting about Davis is how completely he seems to have been let down by the education system. It entirely failed to uncover or nurture his talents. \"I literally have not a single qualification to my name,\" he tells me at one point, and looks rather sheepish. Davis rose to prominence in Anonymous and then LulzSec not because he was some expert hacker \u2013 he wasn't; his technical skills were limited \u2013 but because he is a naturally gifted writer and communicator. Among other things, he controlled the LulzSec Twitter account, from which issued forth a stream of jokey pronouncements, the last of which had the feeling of prophecy to it: \"You cannot arrest an idea,\" he said. Which may be true, but almost exactly a month later a team of police officers burst into his living room, and then flew him by specially chartered plane to London, a place he'd never been to before. \"It was like going to the future or something,\" he says.</p> <p>You can't arrest an idea, though. And although Anonymous's impact may have been exaggerated (not least by itself), at its heart is a radical idea: that the internet can enable mass, participatory, possibly illegal action in a way the world has never seen before. Actions that can be controlled by neither governments nor international agencies, and which are decided by the horde, enacted by the horde, and policed by the horde.</p> <p>According to Parmy Olson, the \"hivemind\", or getting people to \"believe in the power\" of the hivemind, is probably Anonymous's greatest achievement. There is no central organisation (though there are organisers) and no official membership. In some ways it resembles that other recent un-organisation, al-Qaida. If you believe in Anonymous, and call yourself Anonymous, you are Anonymous.</p> <p>And in 2008, it seemingly came out of nowhere. At the time, Gabriella Coleman was studying the <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9TuhOiwGzeg\" title=\"\">Open Source community</a> (the network of programmers who believe in, and develop, free software open to all) and was based at the University of Alberta, which happened to have the largest Scientology archive in the world. And she couldn't help but notice what happened when a video of Tom Cruise being interviewed about Scientology appeared on the internet. A group of online hackers began \"trolling\" (mocking; trying to get a rise out of) the Church of Scientology. For a lot of people, the video \u2013 meant for internal PR purposes only within the church \u2013 was provocation enough: Cruise appears as a genuine, bona fide, swivel-eyed religious nutcase. Then things escalated. The church began <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/culture/culturereviews/magazine/17-10/mf_chanology?currentPage=all\" title=\"\">issuing legal threats</a> against the sites hosting the video, and it was this attempt to police the internet that prompted certain people to rise up and try to defend it.</p> <p>\"What I realised,\" says Coleman, \"is that the Church of Scientology was like the perfect nemesis. It was the geeks' worst nightmare, because it is a religion of science and technology, but the technology doesn't work and the science is pseudoscience. And it's an extremely proprietary religion: they have very aggressive control over trademarks and copyright, so in every way it seemed like the hackers saw how the church was like them, but their evil twin.\"</p> <p>And in doing so, they also realised that they possessed a hitherto unrealised power: strength in numbers. Instead of merely staging online protests, a day of global protest was organised. And on 10 February 2008, 7,000 people <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SraUpcJfqw\" title=\"\">showed up</a> in 127 cities around the world. They didn't know it then but a new political movement was born. \"We are Anonymous,\" read one of the flyers. \"We are Legion. We do not forgive. We do not forget. Expect us.\"</p> <p>Talking to Coleman and Olson, I think I'm getting a handle on Anonymous, and what it is and what it has done. And then I start going into Anonymous chatrooms, on IRC (internet relay chat), on the so-called \"deep web\", a place unsearchable by Google. And I realise I don't understand a thing. People just seem to be talking about random crap in acronyms I don't understand. It's confusingly chaotic. There are people entering the room every five seconds, people leaving, people changing their nicknames. And then there's the slang. Everyone is a fag: there are newfags (newcomers) and oldfags (old-timers) and fagfags (homosexuals) and moralfags (those perceived as taking the moral high ground). I realise that I am a newsfag. But I can't spot the plans to conquer the universe between the casual misogynism and the Aids jokes.</p> <p>It's only on the reporter channel that I find people who can type in sentences and speak a language that I recognise as English. It's where self-selected Anons interact with the press and explain Anonymous's objectives. A 17-year-old called The_Poet, who tells me he's of Iranian parentage, says he became involved because of <a href=\"http://memeburn.com/2011/05/operation-iran-anonymous-does-not-forgive/\" title=\"\">Operation Iran</a> (or OpIran as it's known, Anonymous's campaign to help activists in Iran following the re-election of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad in 2009). He wanted to feel that he was doing something to help activists there. He's at school, he says, and he was about as computer-savvy as I am when he found the forum (ie, not very) but now he spends up to five or more hours a day on it. We chat away, and he tells me that having helped draft press releases and the like, and having become interested in world affairs, he's now considering diplomacy as a career. Though saying you're in Anonymous is possibly not the most obvious CV-building step, I venture.</p> <p>It's late when we chat, around 1am UK time, and it's obvious he's in Europe somewhere, and it's school the next day. \"Go to bed,\" I keep telling him. And I can't help but feel relieved when he tells me that he hasn't done anything illegal. Because via the encrypted chat protocol, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/blog/2002/aug/31/outwithaolin\" title=\"\">Jabber</a> (the first step to communicating with anyone in Anon world), I have chatted to another teenage Anon who was arrested, but never charged. He was lucky. \"I was immature and stupid and reckless,\" he says. \"I caused a lot of damage. Hurt a <em>lot</em> of innocent people. I put millions of people at risk of identity theft by leaking their passwords. It is never justified. Never.\"</p> <p>But you did it because\u2026?</p> <p>\"At the time, it seemed great fun.\"</p> <p>Because fun is the bedrock of it all. \"Trolling\". Agitating. Taking the piss. Lying to, manipulating and taking in fellow internet users. Making a joke of everything. Jake suspects it's why it's so big in Britain. \"Anon humour is quite dark and ironic and is pretty similiar to British humour,\" he says. The origin of \"lulz\" is a corruption of LOLs, meaning \"laugh out loud\" (and not \"lots of love\", as David Cameron thought when he put LOL at the end of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/may/11/rebekah-brooks-david-cameron-texts-lol\" title=\"\">a text to Rebekah Brooks</a>).</p> <p>It's all about the lulz. On 4chan, the \"image board\" (like a chat board, but where people came initially to share images, and whose /b/ \u2013 or \"random\" \u2013 board spawned the idea of Anonymous), anything goes. Just so long as it's not taken seriously. In fact, 4chan is the originator of hundreds of internet memes and viral videos, many of which have found their way into mainstream media.</p> <p>It's easy to grow paranoid researching an article on Anonymous. Some terrible things have happened to people who have tangled with them. LulzSec's first collective action was against Aaron Barr, the CEO of an internet security firm, HBGary Inc, who claimed to have penetrated Anonymous and worked out who the central players were. To cut a long story short, he hadn't. LulzSec cracked his email password, downloaded 40,000 of his emails and <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/writer/parmy_olson/\" title=\"\">released them</a> in a torrent online for anyone to read.</p> <p>Soon after I start hanging out in Anonymous chatrooms, my computer starts running slowly. My phone starts glitching. I start waking in the night with paranoid dreams. Quinn Norton, a reporter for <em>Wired</em> magazine, tells me that there is a strong culture within the group of not attacking the press. Even so, she suspects there may be a \"cache of [my] documents somewhere, but they're not doing anything bad with them\". The main thing to bear in mind if writing about them, she says, is \"not to be an asshole\".</p> <p>I tell Jake about my paranoia. \"I had that every day,\" he says. \"Every morning I spent an hour doing searches and running certain scripts to make me feel better.\" But in his case, at least, it comes down to the old truism that just because you're paranoid, it doesn't mean that there isn't someone following you.</p> <p>When Sabu, the Anonymous turncoat, was intercepted by the FBI, he disappeared offline for 24 hours, and when he came back his story didn't quite hang together. \"I was completely suspicious of him,\" says Jake. \"I was just too stupid to do anything about it. The idea that there was a group of Feds out to get me is the kind of stuff that happens in films. And I'm from the Shetland Islands. The FBI aren't going to be using one of my friends to spy on me. That happens in American action films, it is not real life. And it turns out that this is exactly what happened.\"</p> <p>It was even stranger in some ways for Gabriella Coleman. She met Sabu in New York before any of the arrests, and immediately became suspicious of his status and motives. \"I just knew,\" she says. \"There was no way while he was still the world's most wanted hacker that he'd be wanting to meet me unless he'd been arrested. I knew he'd been arrested. But of course, I couldn't tell anyone. And that was really hard.\"</p> <p>As an anthropologist studying Anonymous, at times, she says, she felt like a cross between \"a detective and a priest\". She watched the group take shape from the time of the Scientology uprising, and was online, in the chatrooms, at the moment it hit the big time: WikiLeaks.</p> <p>Julian Assange had just released the US <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/the-us-embassy-cables\" title=\"\">diplomatic cables</a>, PayPal had announced that it would no longer accept donations on Wikileaks' behalf, and the internet was in uproar. \"There were 7,000 people a time logging into the channels [chat rooms] when, usually, at the very most there would be 1,000,\" says Coleman. \"More than 35,000 people downloaded the software.\"</p> <p>\"The software\" was something called low orbit ion cannon (LOIC), and it meant that anyone with a few clicks of a mouse could become a \"hacker\", or at least a website attacker. Computers all over the world started sending packets of information to the PayPal and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2010/dec/08/operation-payback-mastercard-website-wikileaks\" title=\"\">Visa</a> websites, flooding its servers with a DDoS attack (distributed denial of service). In her book, Parmy Olson explains what actually happened. The PayPal and Visa websites were attacked successfully, but the main perpetrators weren't the \"hive\": the real firepower came from a couple of individuals with \"botnets\", illegal networks of compromised computers. Olson suggests the hive was a PR myth.</p> <p>Still, it's a dangerous PR myth. A few months after the attacks, the FBI began to arrest people: people who had been drawn into Anonymous by the rhetoric, and either didn't realise that what they were doing was illegal, didn't have enough technical nous to cover their tracks, or simply didn't care. There were students, middle-class professionals\u2026 Anonymous wasn't just \"the stereotypical kids living in their mum's basement\", as Coleman puts it. \"You'll probably find at least a couple in your IT department.\"</p> <p>But when you look, for example, at the stunning visual nature of some of Anonymous's designs, that shouldn't come as too great a shock. Nor the brilliance of its operations in <a href=\"http://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2011/01/26/egypt-versus-the-internet-anonymous-hackers-launch-ddos-attack/\" title=\"\">Egypt</a> and <a href=\"http://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2011/01/03/pro-wikileaks-hackers-tunisian-government-websites/\" title=\"\">Tunisia</a>, and recently in <a href=\"http://www.digitaljournal.com/article/327979\" title=\"\">Syria</a>. At its most powerful and compelling, it has leaped to the defence of the internet itself. It was only when Anonymous started highlighting what was happening in Tunisia, for example, after the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/dec/17/arab-governments-silenced-wikileaks\" title=\"\">government banned Wikileaks</a> in late 2010, that the rest of the world's press started paying attention to what became the Arab spring.</p> <p>It is \"political art as spectacle\", according to Coleman. And it stands in opposition to almost everything mainstream society holds dear. Individual fame is neither sought nor welcomed. Anons who draw attention to themselves or claim to speak for Anonymous are ostracised. \"It's almost like the polar opposite of everything that social media stands for,\" says Coleman. \"They dramatise the importance of anonymity and privacy in an era when both are rapidly eroding. They are the anti-Facebook.\"</p> <p>Being anonymous was the source of Jake's power: no one knew he was a kid. That, and the idea of the hive. \"Everyone secretly knows that everyone else [in Anonymous] is kind of a lonely, geeky guy,\" says Jake. \"But we all ignore it, and we all play this Anon game where we are all these invincible Anons.\"</p> <p>And they were mostly guys. Anonymous is very male. In the <a href=\"http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/rules-of-the-internet\" title=\"\">Rules of the Internet</a>, which came out of the 4chan site, Rule 30 states \"there are no girls on the internet\". The previous rule states that \"all girls are men and all kids are undercover FBI agents\", which contains a grain of truth.</p> <p>At times it seems like Anonymous is a nest of slightly naive teenagers who are going to get into trouble. Teenagers have always acted out. Now they get to act out on a global stage, where just a few clicks of a mouse could lead to them spending the next 20 years behind bars. It's impossible to generalise, however. One figure behind one of the most popular Anonymous Twitter feeds told Coleman that he is a \"member of the 1 per cent\". \"He's always in Paris on vacation,\" she tells me. \"He's a very, very wealthy engineer and he's extremely careful in concealing his identity.\"</p> <p>And on the #reporter channel, I chat for a while to an Anon called \"nsh\", who tells me that what we're witnessing is \"the emergence of a new kind of identity, and with it a new form of identity politics. Traditional politics caters to fixed demographics, requires that participants have continuity of identity, can be located in geography. These are things that can be dispensed [with] online, and have been, with great effect.\"</p> <p>He's a bit fond of his long words, nsh, and he likes his historical analogies. The random attacks on websites are really the contemporary version of writing a political slogan on a wall, he says. It's like online vandalism. \"But the Vandals,\" he writes, \"got the short stick, historically, didn't they?\" He won't tell me anything about himself, but my guess is he's British and studying at one of our better universities. It's probably not a coincidence that both <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/aug/29/assange-supporters-claim-hacked-cambridge\" title=\"\">Cambridge</a> and <a href=\"http://www.techweekeurope.co.uk/news/oxford-university-security-anonymous-hack-90815\" title=\"\">Oxford</a> universities have been targeted in the past two weeks, as part of Anonymous's ongoing Operation Free Assange. If you're going to spray-paint a wall, you might as well do it somewhere your mates will see it. I like joshing with nsh, but I do feel the generational difference. When he makes a joke, he signals it with an emoticon. When I make a joke, he says \"lol\". I have to say, \"Ha, ha!\" because otherwise, I tell him, \"I'll sound like Ali G. It'd be embarrassing. Like hearing your gran try to rap.\"</p> <p>There is \"no clear-cut moral assessment\" of Anonymous that can be made, says Gabriella Coleman. \"But if you hurt the internet, be careful, because the internet may well hurt you back.\"</p> <p>In Spalding, Jake Davis can make even less sense of it, even though, for a time, he was it. His lawyers have made him read<strong> </strong>hundreds of pages of his chat logs as part of his case. \"And I just think 'Who is this Topiary guy?'\" he says. \"He is just full of crap. We tried to do something funny, something political, something ideological, and it ended up just being a mess.\"</p> <p>I'm possibly more confused about Anonymous now than when I started researching this article. When I look at <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-17544311\" title=\"\">pastebin.com</a>, which is where hackers put up the latest data dumps, the results of their latest hacking and defacement operations, the targets seem random, perverse.</p> <p>\"Cadwal, there is always mad shit going on in Anonymous,\" an Anon called KnowledgeUS tells me. \"It is even hard for an Anon to know all that's going on with Anonymous.\"</p> <p>It makes me feel a little better. \"Ha, ha!\" I say. Because Anonymous is something that belongs to a new generation. It's their internet. Their Anonymous. And at my age, I'm just too old for the lulz.</p> <p><em>This piece was edited on 2/10/12 to clarify a contributor's quote</em></p>",
  "<p><strong>Dear Owen</strong></p> <p>Welcome to your new job as secretary of state for the environment. I predict an interesting spell in office \u2013 for you certainly come with unusual credentials. You have virtually no record of making environmental pronouncements of any consequence or for showing concerns about ecological or climatic issues. You say you loathe wind turbines, a source of renewable energy on which Britain was supposed to be becoming reliant, while it is also said that you are a proponent of fracking, the extraction of shale gas, a process that would cause major increases in UK carbon emissions.</p> <p>For good measure you arrive at your new post with the strong endorsement of Britain's chief climate change denier, Nigel Lawson, the former chancellor who now believes his legacy of laissez-faire economics is being undermined by unnecessary curbs to carbon emissions and who has committed himself to the obstruction of such reforms.</p> <p>It is quite a CV, and you can appreciate why those concerned with scientific issues might be worried. Apart from your own dubious record, several other individuals given cabinet posts last week have also voiced startling, unorthodox views.</p> <p>The new transport minister, Patrick McLoughlin, has revealed he has a morbid fear of flying, for example, while the new health secretary, Jeremy Hunt, turns out to be a supporter of homeopathy, a widely discredited, ineffective form of treatment derided by the medical establishment. Putting such individuals in office is the equivalent of putting <em>Twilight</em>'s Cullen clan of vampires in charge of a blood bank. Certainly the chance of rational, evidence-based debate in cabinet looks a remote prospect these days.</p> <p>Hence my letter to you, Mr Paterson. In taking charge of UK environmental affairs, you have been handed a task that has never been more important. It needs to be directed with pressing urgency: ice sheets are melting, sea levels rising and farmland is turning to desert across the globe as temperatures rise.</p> <p>Hundreds of millions of people are destined to lose their homes in the next few decades unless we take action now. Britain, which gave birth to the industrial revolution and which became the first country to pump significant excesses of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, has a special responsibility to the world. If nothing else, we need to set an example and end our reliance on the burning of fossil fuels to generate power.</p> <p>And that is what worries me about your appointment. By all accounts you are a charming, pro-foxhunting, country gentleman who has an intense love of his North Shropshire constituency but who has yet to demonstrate any recognition of the global nature of the environmental crisis we face (though I acknowledge your 2010 green paper on fisheries management reveals an appreciation of the current crises affecting the oceans). Humanity is now going through the latter stages of an experiment far greater than the hunt for the Higgs boson or the decoding of the human genome. As we pump more and more greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, thereby melting ice caps, destroying precious ecosystems and eradicating species in their thousands, we are creating a future for ourselves that becomes less and less certain and more and more hostile.</p> <p>Now it is true that Britain may avoid some of the very worst direct impacts of this grand experiment when \u2013 later this century \u2013 global average temperatures rise by at least 3C to 6C, but we will not escape the secondary consequences. As central Europe and much of Asia scorches, millions of starving people will reach our shores. Our country will be turned into a military outpost dedicated to keeping them out, a point recently raised by Professor Stephen Emmott, who has observed that senior army officers have recently become a common sight at climate conferences. If nothing else, this suggests that the military sees the dangers we face, even if politicians like you do not.</p> <p>In short, you need to see the big picture. My fear is that you were picked because that is the last thing you do. Your appointment is part of George Osborne's bid to bring short-term boosts to the economy at the expense of long-term environmental gain and in the face of opposition from government climate advisers. Let us bring back fossil fuels, in particular gas, as our main power source and curtail renewable energy sources, argues the chancellor, who has succeeded in persuading the prime minister to pack the cabinet with environmental sceptics, utterly undermining David Cameron's declared hope his government would be the greenest ever seen in Britain.</p> <p>I hope you have the courage to confound those expectations and to realise that we face a catastrophic future if we do not halt our dependence on fossil fuels. Fracking is not an answer to our problems, nor is the new dash for gas, backed by Osborne. The latter would leave us dependent on natural gas producers such as Qatar and at the mercy of major price rises that would be introduced in later years.</p> <p>By contrast, creating an indigenous renewable power industry in Britain \u2013 for wind, wave and tidal turbines \u2013 will give us energy independence and wean us off our fossil fuel habits. That is the longer-term, bigger picture. I hope you see it, but I doubt you do.</p> <p>My unease is only deepened by the knowledge that you are the brother-in-law of the environmental sceptic Matt Ridley, whose stewardship at Northern Rock saw the first run on a British bank for 150 years but who has never tired of telling us that climatewise we have nothing to fear.</p> <p>Nor have your actions since taking office done anything to soothe jangled nerves. Pressed last week by journalists to deny or admit you are a climate change sceptic, you hid behind a feeble Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs press release that merely acknowledged that you were responsible for exploring issues such as climate change.</p> <p>It was an unimpressive start. I would like to think that things can only get better. Given a pause for reflection about the wider issues, that could happen. I hope you do get the bigger picture. If you do not, then the nation will have wasted further precious time when it could be taking decisive action to counter climate change. And time is a commodity that is already in dangerously short supply.</p> <p><strong>Yours, Robin</strong></p>",
  "<p><em>SPOILER ALERT: This weekly blog is for those who have been watching the new series of Doctor Who. Don\u2019t read ahead if you haven\u2019t seen episode two \u2013 Dinosaurs on a Spaceship</em></p> \n<p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2012/sep/01/doctor-who-asylum-of-the-daleks\" title=\"\">Dan Martin\u2019s episode one blog</a></p> \n<h2>\u201cI\u2019m riding a dinosaur on a spaceship, I only came round to fix your light.\u201d</h2> \n<p>Well, that was fun, wasn\u2019t it? The only way this could have been more of a riot is if Samuel L Jackson had turned up. Fandom will probably hate Dinosaurs on a Spaceship. Yes, it was flimsy and, yes, it was pretty much a story built around a title. The producers have admitted as much. But second episodes are supposed to be fun \u2013 and you only have to think back to <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2011/may/07/doctor-who-the-curse-of-the-black-spot\" title=\"\">The Curse of the Black Spot</a> to realise that this is the finest episode two from Doctor Who in some time.</p> \n<p>It looked hugely expensive \u2013 with both the dinosaurs and the Silurian craft beautifully realised \u2013 while <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1163823/\" title=\"\">Chris Chibnall</a>\u2018s most accomplished Who script to date proved not only incredibly funny, but managed to carry the title over a whole episode. So much was packed in: Silurians! The India Space Agency! A randy Queen Nefertiti! Rory\u2019s dad! Camp dreadnoughts with the voices of Mitchell and Webb! How wrong can you go with that sort of thing?</p> \n<h2>\u201cEgyptian queen or not, I should put you over my knee and spank you!\u201d</h2> \n<p>This episode also served as this series\u2019 \u201ccelebrity historical\u201d adventure while still managing to sidestep the requirement to feign historical accuracy. Which is a bit of a shame because I\u2019d dearly love to see a Doctor Who story set in Ancient Egypt; the business with the giant weapon-bearing alien maggot thing will have to be left to the imagination. I like the idea of the Doctor\u2019s gang \u2013 like a sitcom version of the army he raised in A Good Man Goes to War \u2013 and Mark Williams\u2019s performance of a human bewildered by all of this was lovely (and highlighted how used to everything Amy and Rory now are). Rupert Graves, meanwhile channelled something of the Brigadier as game-hunter Riddell. And there was a cute riff on history \u2013 Queen Nefertiti really did vanish from the historical records in 1336BC.</p> \n<h2>\u201cPiracy, the genocide \u2026\u201d</h2> \n<p>The dinosaurs, of course, were not the baddies here, with the tearjerking triceratops death scene reminiscent of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Land_Before_Time\" title=\"\">The Land Before Time</a>. But in David Bradley\u2019s Solomon we had one of the most unpleasant villains in recent memory. And as funny as the episode was, the whole thing was undercut with a darkness that was almost disturbing enough to ruin everything. The line about \u201cbreaking in Nefertiti\u201d, for instance, was laced with a dark sexuality that felt completely inappropriate.</p> \n<p>Perhaps it was intended as some justification for the Doctor\u2019s merciless decision to leave the old letch for the missiles. But that was a hugely un-Doctorish move, and I\u2019m not sure how I feel about that, either. Could it be intended to feed into the themes revealed in the trailer for next week\u2019s western episode \u2013 with the Doctor getting emo over the question of his mercy?</p> \n<h2>Pond watch</h2> \n<p>Amy and Rory are getting seriously good at this. Amy even plays the Doctor to Neffy and Riddell (nice line about flirting companions, too), and even Rory has developed enough aptitude as a Tardisnaut to show his dad the ropes (inadvertently earning his respect for his profession etc etc etc). But the foreshadowing of their exit continues: with the Doctor zinging in and out of their lives, Amy can\u2019t settle. And, really, why would she keep quitting jobs? That modelling looked like a right cushy number.</p> \n<h2>Fear factor</h2> \n<p>Dinosaurs on a Spaceship may have been a great many things, but scary it was not.</p> \n<h2>Mysteries and questions</h2> \n<p>\u2022 No sign of Oswin this episode, although plenty of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2012/sep/03/doctor-who-companion-jenna-louise-coleman\" title=\"\">interesting theories last week</a> about the nature of her return. I think we can safely say that her appearance was intended as part of a mystery and not a casting accident, and I\u2019m going with the \u201cperson fractured through time\u201d theory. Meanwhile, could the Silurians be a part of this year\u2019s arc? We know that Neve Macintosh is back later in the series as <a href=\"http://tardis.wikia.com/wiki/Vastra\" title=\"\">Madame Vastra</a>.</p> \n<h2>Time-space debris</h2> \n<p>\u2022 Of course, we\u2019ve already seen dinosaurs on a ship, of sorts, before if you count the Drashig from the 1973 Pertwee story <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/classic/episodeguide/carnivalmonsters/\" title=\"\">Carnival of Monsters</a>.</p> \n<p>\u2022 Everyone\u2019s speculating about Benedict Cumberbatch playing the Master, but here we have the first Sherlock crossover, in Rupert \u201cLestrade\u201d Graves.</p> \n<p>\u2022 \u201cEven a monkey could use them. Oh look, they\u2019re going to.\u201d</p> \n<p>\u2022 Turns out the Doctor is quite the musician. After last week\u2019s turn on the triangle in Carmen, he was also the second pair of hands in Fantasia in F minor for four hands.</p> \n<h2>Next Week!</h2> \n<p>Doctor Who does the wild west, as

  "<p>She has the eyes of her father, a gaze that became an emblem for the 20th century. She also has his deep sense of social injustice, but Dr Aleida Guevara has always had to share her \"papi\" with the world.</p> <p>While she doesn't mind the posters, the flags, the postcards, graffiti paintings and T-shirts, Dr Guevara and her family are trying to clamp down on \"disrespectful\" uses of her father's famous photo, taken by Alberto Korda in 1960. Not easy when it is the most reproduced image in the world.</p> <p>\"It's not so easy, we do not want to control the image or make money from it, but it is hard when it's exploited,\" Dr Guevara smiles. \"Sometimes people know what he stands for, sometimes not. Mostly I think it is used well, as a symbol for resistance, against repression.\"</p> <p>Che on a bikini was one they couldn't stop, but Che, a teetotaller, on a vodka bottle was a battle won for the family with the help of the <a href=\"http://www.cuba-solidarity.org.uk\">UK Cuba Solidarity Campaign</a>.</p> <p>Next month marks the 45th anniversary of the killing of Ernesto \"Che\" Guevara, the guerrilla who helped lead the Cuban revolution and became an icon of rebellion. This year is also the 50th anniversary of the US \"blockade\", the ongoing commercial, trade and travel embargo which has stifled Cuba's economy. The cold war era-style standoff still sees America spend millions beaming propaganda radio and TV stations into Cuba. Cubans remain the only immigrants the US encourages in with automatic citizenship.</p> <p>An underdeveloped country offering world-class education and healthcare for all, Cuba maintains anti-dissident policies, imprisoning journalists and anti-government activists. Despite a mass prison release of dissidents in 2011, Cuban authorities, says Amnesty International, \"do not tolerate any criticism of state policies outside the official mechanisms established under government control. Laws on 'public disorder', 'dangerousness' and 'aggression' are used to prosecute government opponents. No political or human rights organisations are allowed to obtain legal status.\"</p> <p>Dr Guevara is in the UK for another anniversary, the 14th year since the Miami Five \u2013 spies entrusted with infiltrating anti-Castro terrorist groups operating from Florida \u2013 were jailed by the US. The 51-year-old Havana paedriatician will lead an evening vigil in London outside the US embassy on 18 September. \"I'm not political,\" she insists, \"but I care about injustice.\"</p> <p>Aleida was seven when Che was killed in a remote Bolivian hamlet by a group of Bolivian soldiers and CIA operatives. With only shadowy memories of her father, she has got to know him through his diaries and the reminiscences of others, including the man she calls \"Uncle\" \u2013 Fidel Castro.</p> <p>\"Fidel has told me many beautiful stories about my father, but I cannot ask him too much, he still gets very emotional at the thought of Che. For example, my father had terrible handwriting, so my mother was asked to transcribe his diaries. When Ra\u00fal Castro came to our house to collect the manuscript, my mother knew that Ra\u00fal and Fidel also kept diaries, so she said 'if there are accounts in the diaries that differ then you must go with Che's, because he is not here to defend himself'. Ra\u00fal got very angry and said 'No, while Fidel and I are alive, Che is alive. He is always with us.' They were crying then.</p> <p>\"If Che hadn't died in Bolivia, he would have died in Argentina trying to change things there,\" she says. \"Maybe it would be a different continent today. My mother always says that if my father had lived we would all have been better human beings.\"</p> <p>Che was a medical student in Argentina when, on a motorcycle tour around Latin America in 1952, he became incensed by the poverty he saw. He took up political theorising and then arms, joining the revolution that overthrew Cuba's vicious Batista regime.</p> <p>It was then, as the middle class and wealthy fled Cuba for Miami, that a bitter chasm opened between the two nations, and it has deepened from president to president. The promise of President Obama to tackle the Cuban issue has come to nothing so far. \"We had great hopes, but we are disappointed in Obama, maybe things have even got worse for us,\" Dr Guevara says.</p> <p>Revolution, she believes, simmers on in Latin America, where the gulf between rich and poor is escalating and she blames, as Che did, creeping American-led industrialisation. \"This economic crisis is even more dangerous than any before for Latin America. It's not only about oil now, the US want water too. Brazil is destroying its rainforest to mine out iron, Mexico is a dumping ground for unwanted waste. This time the land is being destroyed as well.\"</p> <p>Critics of Che claim the photogenic young man in battle fatigues who wrote poetry overshadows the brutality of his revolution. Guevara showed no qualms about killing. \"It was a revolution,\" says his daughter. \"Of course, I would rather there was no bloodshed but that is the nature of revolution. In a true revolution you have to get what you want by force. An enemy who doesn't want to give you what you want? Maybe you have to take it. My father knew the risk he took with his own life.</p> <p>\"I was angry, of course, growing up without a dad, but my mother always says, love your father for who he was, a man who had to do what he did. My father died defending his ideals. Up to the last minute he was true to what he believed in. This is what I admire.\"</p> <p>But she says she would like to have been able to argue with him. \"When I was six he sent me a letter. In it he said I should be good and help my mother with household chores. I was angry because my brother's letter said 'I will take you to the moon' and my other brother's read 'We will go and fight imperialism together'. I was annoyed \u2013 I wanted to go to the moon, why couldn't I fight imperialism?\"</p> <p>Dr Guevara is the eldest of Che's four children with his second wife, Aleida. \"We didn't have privileges growing up as Che's children. My colleagues didn't know who I was until I first talked on Cuban TV in 1996. But it's important not to keep silent, because there is injustice being wrought.\"</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 12 September to correct the date of the evening vigil at the US Embassy.</p>",
  "<p>Both of them have a Spanish-sounding surname. Both have a moving story of poor parents coming to America for a better life. And both recently spoke to the American people from a primetime slot at their party's national convention.</p> <p>But San Antonio mayor Juli\u00e1n Castro and Florida senator Marco Rubio are far from being on the same side. Instead they symbolise the almighty battle for the Hispanic vote between Republicans and Democrats in the 2012 election.</p> <p>Each has been selected as a sort of party champion, sallying forth to do battle for the support of America's 50\u2009\u2009million Latinos, whose votes could decide whether former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney wins the Oval Office or President Barack Obama secures a second term.</p> <p>The contest has pitted two of the youngest rising stars in American politics against each other. Castro is just 37, yet already has a major national profile, prompting comparisons with Obama's own path to the White House. Meanwhile Rubio, 41, is a Tea Party favourite often touted as a future Republican leader who was even widely rumoured to have been considered for Romney's vice-presidential shortlist this year.</p> <p>Both men are the children of immigrants \u2013 from Mexico and Cuba respectively \u2013 and both gave widely praised speeches that wowed their fans. Yet, mirroring the many splits in American Hispanics' own communities, that is where the similarities end. Rubio is a darling of the right wing of the Republican party and beats the drum for slashing government spending. He is staunchly anti-abortion and has said that gay marriage goes against his Christian faith.</p> <p>Castro, meanwhile, has served as the grand marshal in his city's gay rights parade, praises the role of government in society and is the child of a leftist civil-rights-campaigning single mother. Each man therefore represents a radically different vision of what his party thinks will appeal to Hispanic voters. \"Both parties need to show that they are open and attractive to Hispanic voters, but they are not at all a unified bloc,\" said Professor Scott McLean, a political scientist at Quinnipiac University.</p> <p>So far it is a battle that Castro and the Democrats have been winning. In 2008, Latino voters went for Obama by almost 70% and current polling \u2013 though showing a drop in support \u2013 still has the Democrat ahead of Romney by 63% to 28%. In the recent Charlotte party convention, Castro was given the all-important keynote address \u2013 the first Hispanic to fill that spot \u2013 but other Latino party bigwigs were given prominence too. Much was made of Obama's appointment of the first Hispanic woman to the Supreme Court in Sonia Sotomayor, and the president was also lauded for recent moves to lift the threat of deportation from millions of young illegal immigrants brought to the US as children.</p> <p>It is that thorny issue of illegal immigration that is the Democrats' real strength. Though Obama is hardly liberal on the issue, the Republican party has moved far to the right, embracing controversial measures against illegal immigration in states such as Arizona. Yet one study has estimated that some 9.5 million people \u2013 the vast majority of them likely to be Latino \u2013 live in \"mixed\" households where at least one person is illegal. In such homes, harsh Republican rhetoric on immigration is always going to be offputting.</p> <p>\"That is the wedge issue that keeps Latinos from the Republican party,\" said Professor Gabriel Sanchez, an expert in Latino politics at the University of New Mexico.</p> <p>Yet Republican strategists believe they have an ace up their sleeves in the party's embrace of conservative social values that are often shared by many Hispanics, who are often deeply Roman Catholic and family-oriented. Rubio and other leading Republicans, such as Texan Senate candidate Ted Cruz and New Mexico governor Susana Martinez, frequently tout their social values. But it has not been a winner overall, because Latino social conservatism often goes hand-in-hand with a belief in government welfare programmes as a way out of poverty for a demographic often much poorer than its white equivalent. This is especially true as the economic aftershocks of the Great Recession are still being felt while Republicans tout massive cuts to healthcare, education grants and food stamps.</p> <p>\"Who cares about two guys getting married when you want a job?\" said Professor Stephen Nu\u00f1o, a political scientist at Northern Arizona University. \"In the end, a voter is not going to forget Republican hostility and that the party wants to deport their uncle.\"</p> <p>Many experts believe the Republican party faces disaster in the future as Hispanics became an ever more vital part of the electorate. In 2008, some 10.2 million voted, a whopping 25% increase on 2004 (in the early 1990s, only 2% of the electorate was Hispanic). It is a number certain to leap again in 2012.</p> <p>Recent surveys have shown that Hispanics represent more than half of all US population growth over the past decade. Due to a youthful population profile, they already represent one in four Americans under the age of 18. \"The numbers are compelling,\" said Sanchez.</p> <p>So, too, is the geography. One of the fastest areas of Latino population growth is the Republican heartland of the south. If the Republican party does not in some way attract Hispanics, it will face a withering of support even in the reddest of red states. The battle is already on for Texas \u2013 a solidly Republican state that is home to both Castro and Cruz. It is noticeable that Texas's Republican governor, Rick Perry, is already softer on aspects of illegal immigration policy than the Republican mainstream. But if the Republicans are to compete nationally as the voice of Hispanics, if Marco Rubio is to best Julian Castro on the national stage, then the Republican party itself will have to change. \"It has to. But I don't see that that is going to happen for a very long time,\" said Nu\u00f1o.</p>",
