  "<h2><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0osXTPmNkAw\" title=\"\"><strong>Wave Machines</strong></a><strong> </strong><br><strong>Ill Fit (Neapolitan/Pias)</strong></h2> <p><strong> </strong></p> <p>It's fair to say of Liverpool's Wave Machines that if you were to break into their houses and rifle through their record collections you'd find a Prince record or two. However, if you are going to be retro, then Prince is the way to go to, rather than the dried-out, skinny-trousered, classic rock so drearily retrodden by the rest of the landfill. Arising from an aqueous swirl of fizzy, colourised funk-ade, Ill Fit elegantly springs taut and cuts loose, the falsetto vocals tremulous and restrained, its faintly distressed surfaces offering subtle hints of hindsight to a perfect funk-pop age. Teetering on sublime.</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IoZu1wn_c4\" title=\"\"><strong>Peace</strong></a><strong> </strong><br><strong>Bloodshake (Columbia)</strong></h2> <p><strong> </strong></p> <p>There are shades of the criminally overlooked band the Invisible about Bloodshake, taken from Birmingham lot's Delicious EP. The video sees them free-floating in a neo-neo-psychedelic Photoshopped starswirl. The vocals are mildly tranquilised, the guitars a splashy interplay of white liquid, but this is anti-shoegaze, driven by a rambunctious, gatecrashing energy, coming at you like a bucket of water. Peace do not bring peace. They've come a long way from their lo-fi origins and are breaking out in a direction you wish more would follow.</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YyY5upiRO8Q\" title=\"\"><strong>Jessie Ware</strong></a><strong> </strong><br><strong>Night Light (PMR)</strong></h2> <p><strong> </strong></p> <p>Jessie Ware has been touted as a diva in the making, and her vocals are rich and lucid, but free of the sort of gymnastic gurgling nowadays considered to denote \"soul\". She's got leftfield credentials, too, working with Dave Okumu of the Invisible (them again), who adds a certain oblique shimmer to Night Light. All that she's got to be wary of is being sucked into an MOR vortex of dry ice, Heart FM and Celine Dion-ification.</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-Q9r6hIp-w\" title=\"\"><strong>AxeWound</strong></a><strong> </strong><br><strong>Exorchrist (Search And Destroy)</strong></h2> <p><strong> </strong></p> <p>Fascinating stuff from the British-Canadian metal \"supergroup\", AxeWound. This was once death metal, you suspect, before being subjected to intensive dilution. The plastic rat swung by the blonde female in the video as she sits amid a mass of candles signifies how utterly sanitised this Satanism is. For all its volume and sweat, it's as odourless and ultimately as chaste as mainstream Christian rock.</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kt2yM3X4RP8\" title=\"\"><strong>Tyga Feat Chris Brown &amp; Wynter Gordon</strong></a><strong> </strong><br><strong>For The Fame (Young Money/Cash Money)</strong></h2> <p><strong> </strong></p> <p>Tyga stands for \"Thank You God Always\", the little creep. For The Fame, with its cliched stabs of synth strings, 10-times refried electro backbeat and general \"coming to the top deck of a bus near you soon\" tinniness is nondescript enough. It does, however, involve Chris Brown. Let's hope that nothing comes out about Brown to ruin his currently spotless reputation and make us wonder why he has been heaped with riches and fame despite being an obviously, appallingly obnoxious dick.</p>",
  "<p>Forget Nick Kamen, Mad About The Boy and Stiltskin. Levi's Go Forth campaign has traded in its sepia-tinged visions of The Old Days\u2122 in favour of a vision of nowness that's so of-the-moment that it will be o.v.e.r. by the time you finish this sentence. \"This is a pair of Levi's: buttons and rivets and pockets and cuffs,\" says Serious Voiceover Lady, in an insouciantly cool tone that suggests she's reading her little denim poem during a pretentious open-mic night, squeezed in between an ethically sourced fish juggler and a sock puppeteer re-enacting chapter eight of Naomi Wolf's Vagina. In her excitable verse, Little Miss Patti Smithsonian artfully makes the link between wearing a pair of Levi's vein-crushers with the ability to find a cure for cancer and become leader of the free world (subtext: if you sport some Guess? jeans you'll probably only spark up a cure for deep vein thrombosis and are fated to become the leader of your local pop choir).</p> <p>The ad cuts between shots of Real People (translation: eye-wateringly pretty models who last ate in 2005) getting changed into a variety of Levi's couture, and then walking down the street en route to big, career-making moments. Levi's new campaign might be very cool and all but it's also so exhaustingly melodramatic that it'll make most of us want to hide behind the metaphorical changing-room curtain of life, stuffing our faces with ice-cream as we watch the latest episode of The Great British Bake Off, wearing jeans with an elasticated waistband. A pair of which, if we're being honest, is probably not in Levi's new range.</p> <p><em><strong><br>Watch the ad <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsP6XTHBwRw\">here</a></strong></em></p>",

  "<p>If you're thinking about booking a last-minute October half-term getaway in the sun, the good news is that seven in 10 foreign holidays are cheaper this year compared to last, according to research which names Greece as the most affordable destination.</p> <p>The study from M&amp;S Bank, which looked at the price of holidays in 10 of the top family destinations at this time of year, found that the increased strength of the pound against the euro \u2013 up around 7.6% since last autumn \u2013 combined with relatively low inflation, meant that four of the five most affordable holiday destinations are in Europe.</p> <p>Arguably, best value was the Greek island of Corfu where the total cost of a week's stay, including flights, seven nights' accommodation and dinner plus one activity, works out at \u00a3662 per adult \u2013 an average saving of \u00a359 per person on last year. That, of course, may have something to do with Greece's current woes.</p> <p>Also less expensive than last year are the Alicante region of Spain at \u00a3687 per adult (down by \u00a321 per person) and Faro in Portugal (\u00a31,035. That's \u00a333 lower than in 2011).</p> <p>But if you are thinking of booking a last-minute holiday, make sure you and your family have their documents in order.</p> <p><strong>European Health Insurance Card</strong> <strong>(EHIC)</strong> gives access to state-provided healthcare in EU countries.

  "<p>One Thursday morning not long ago, I caught a bus to 1957. Alighting at Crouch End Broadway, I walked into the old <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hornsey_Town_Hall\" title=\"\">Hornsey Town Hall</a> and found myself in the office of a&#xa0;television news producer on whose desk was a&#xa0;<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remington_Rand\" title=\"\">Remington Rand</a> typewriter, and next to it a stack of typewritten articles from the wires, clamped together with a hefty metal bulldog clip, the top of which was a report about the <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/april/19/newsid_2720000/2720723.stm\" title=\"\">marriage of Prince Rainier to Grace Kelly</a>. On the bookshelves, a 1957 explanatory tome about nuclear power rested next to a contemporary <a href=\"http://www.ukwhoswho.com/\" title=\"\">Who's Who</a>. On&#xa0;a&#xa0;smaller, secretary's desk in the anteroom, a&#xa0;1950s seaside postcard was secured under a glass paperweight.</p> <p>The woman whose office this was strode along the corridor, dressed in an orange skirt suit with a&#xa0;teal blouse, her hair rollered, her face powdered and lipsticked. And then I walked through a&#xa0;doorway and the illusion was broken, for in the space of a yard I found myself transported from the 50s Beeb to a Soho nightclub, one where Martini bottles lined the bar and the velvet-swagged tables were sized for two cocktail glasses&#xa0;and a large ashtray.</p> <p>This is the set of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/the-hour\" title=\"\">The Hour</a>, which arrived on our TV screens last year billed as the British <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/mad-men-tv-series\" title=\"\">Mad&#xa0;Men</a>, but turned out to be something quite different. Both shows deal with sexual politics in&#xa0;a world on the brink of seismic change. But in&#xa0;some ways The Hour, set among the makers of a radical new TV news show, has less in common with Don Draper and co than it does with Rona Jaffe's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/may/08/best-everything-rona-jaffe-review\" title=\"\">The Best Of Everything</a>, a 1958 novel about&#xa0;the first generation of career women in New York, which Draper is at one point seen reading in bed. As in Jaffe's book, the changing role of women is at the very centre of The Hour, which revolves around the character of Bel Rowley, a young producer based on the real-life BBC producer <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grace_Wyndham_Goldie\" title=\"\">Grace Wyndham Goldie</a>. Because it takes as its viewpoint the making of a BBC programme about contemporary events, The Hour is very much about Britain: about the British establishment attempting to adapt to or control a world on the edge of dramatic change. The first series was set against the backdrop of <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/british/modern/suez_01.shtml\" title=\"\">the Suez crisis</a>; the second, which reaches screens later this month, a&#xa0;year later in 1957.</p> <p>Writer <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/abimorgan\" title=\"\">Abi Morgan</a> is on set the day I visit, despite \"the most horrific hangover ever\". Morgan,&#xa0;whose other recent credits include <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/140396/iron-lady\" title=\"\">The Iron Lady</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/142860/shame\" title=\"\">Shame</a>, is loud but tiny; the hangover comes with a long, funny story that involves being accidentally bought champagne by&#xa0;<a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000362/\" title=\"\">Danny DeVito</a>. Finding the right backdrop for the new series, she tells me, is a process of \"chasing down history to find the story. Thematically, there are two threads \u2013 the nuclear threat and the start of the cold war, and the internal threat caused by immigration and a new clash of culture. The late 1950s is the moment when Britain breaks free from the old establishment, and signs up to a&#xa0;new world order&#xa0;that is all about money. There's so much going on. It's a ticking clock. To me, that's what&#xa0;The Hour symbolises.\"</p> <p>Fast forward a week, and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/romola-garai\" title=\"\">Romola Garai</a> \u2013 the wearer of the aforementioned orange skirt suit \u2013 strides into a Shoreditch photographic studio in an <a href=\"http://www.isabelmarant.tm.fr/\" title=\"\">Isabel Marant</a> cotton top (\"Horribly, horribly expensive, but it is literally my favourite top ever\") and high-waisted jeans, carrying a pack of cigarettes and a take-out coffee. It is the morning after the wrap party, and Garai and her co-stars, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/dominic-west\" title=\"\">Dominic West</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2011/jun/29/ben-whishaw-the-hour?INTCMP=ILCNETTXT3487\" title=\"\">Ben Whishaw</a>, are back in 2012. Today, they are to be shot in both 1950s and contemporary fashion. It is the modern clothes that Garai is more concerned about: she has what costume designers quaintly call \"an old-fashioned figure\", and that she refers to more colourfully as \"plenty of junk in the trunk\".</p> <p>\"What happened with The Hour,\" she tells me, \"was basically that I picked up the script and the first line I read was, 'Bel is sitting at her desk.' And I was like, well, this is fucking amazing. This part is mine. Because how often are you ever introduced to a young female character and she's sitting behind an actual desk? The main thing I'm interested in is that I don't want the women I play to be defined by their romantic involvement with the male lead. I want them to have a job. So the fact that Bel having a job is the first thing we know about her was a huge deal for me.\"</p> <p>Garai says she recognises a lot of Bel's character&#xa0;in herself. \"We are similar in being ambitious, young women who love our jobs and are truly passionate about them. And who are interested in&#xa0;the world around them, and in politics. But we are different in that Bel is a real diplomat with people, which I'm not at all. I say what I think, and then get into trouble.\" She tries&#xa0;to look sheepish about this, but it's not particularly convincing. \"Actually, I think it's OK&#xa0;to fight for what you care about. The best piece of advice I was given about work was by someone who told me that it's OK to have conflict. I think sometimes women need to be reminded of that.\"</p> <p>\"Hello, Romsey Poms!\" With this greeting to Garai, Dominic West, who plays Hector in The Hour, bursts into the makeup room. He positions himself in front of the mirror, which is the largest in the studio, to check his reflection in the outfit he has been dressed in. (As the shoot progresses, West is often to be found in front of this mirror; Whishaw, on the other hand, tends to&#xa0;slope off to a bathroom to inspect his reflection without an audience.) Garai, who missed the wrap party, asks West how it was. \"Marvellous! Just marvellous. There were dancing girls, Romsey Poms, and you know how I&#xa0;love dancing girls.\" Garai rolls her eyes at me in the makeup mirror, hugs West, and announces fondly that, \"Dominic is an idiot, obviously, but actually we all get on incredibly well. Not just us three [with Whishaw], but everyone. There is a&#xa0;lot of corpsing on the set of&#xa0;The Hour. One day, we got so hysterical they had to clear the set and send us all back to our rooms. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2011/aug/21/anna-chancellor-interview-the-hour\" title=\"\">Anna [Chancellor]</a> had tears streaming down her face, they had to redo her makeup. We&#xa0;got into so much trouble.\"</p> <p>Later, Whishaw describes it as \"amazing, just a&#xa0;lovely, lovely set. It seems odd to talk about the&#xa0;three of us because the others, like Anna [Chancellor] and <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2772105/\" title=\"\">Oona [Chaplin]</a>, are such a vivid part of it. There is just a huge, huge amount of love and honesty and laughter.\"</p> <p>But while The Hour was lavished with praise for its 1950s style, Garai is notably less effusive when we discuss Bel's wardrobe. \"The clothes are&#xa0;the one element of the programme that I feel rather ambivalent about. My choice would have been for her to be dressed in a more realistic way, which would be much tweedier. But needless to say the producers were keen for her to&#xa0;look as glamorous as possible. I feel strongly that how Bel dresses is not how someone in that environment would really have dressed. She wouldn't have wanted to look glamorous, to make herself vulnerable to criticism in that way. If it was down to me, it would've been tweed suits and brogues.\"</p> <p>Many of the same tastes apply in real life, she says, despite today's ultrafashionable Marant. \"I&#xa0;wear a lot of navy and grey, and I do love woolly&#xa0;tights. My sister says I dress like a French teacher. The level of grooming that was involved for women in the 1950s is completely alien to me. I don't wax. I barely shave. If I do my own makeup, I look like I've been to a burns unit.\"</p> <p>The second series of The Hour sees Whishaw's&#xa0;character, Freddie, return older, wiser&#xa0;and better poised as a meaningful rival to Hector for the status of the show's alpha male. As&#xa0;interviewees, the two actors could scarcely be&#xa0;more different. Whishaw sits facing me, neatly cross-legged, hair falling over his eyes, elfin face resting on the points of long-fingered pianist's hands. When he answers a question, he closes his&#xa0;eyes and leans forward, to speak directly into my tape recorder. He talks very slowly, and after Garai's galloping gossip it takes me a few minutes&#xa0;to adjust, so I find myself asking the next&#xa0;question only to realise he is still pondering the last. When West's turn comes, he sprawls on the sofa with one arm thrown across the back, claiming maximum space like a tiger prowling the&#xa0;boundaries of his cage, angling what I suspect he knows is his best side towards me. It is a measure of his charm that he is, despite all this, impossible to dislike.</p> <p>Whishaw, like Garai, was drawn to the character as written by Morgan. \"Freddie is one of those characters you'd like to be more like, in real life. We're similar in that we're both a bit obsessive, but he's braver, bolder. He has absolute courage in his convictions. He's not a saint, but at the centre of him is something very admirable. I think it would be lovely to have that conviction, that very clear belief structure. I guess I wish I had that.\" Whishaw has a whimsical, meandering way of talking, and a tendency to start stories that don't go anywhere. (On clothes: \"I once had a pair of jeans I really liked. I loved them, they were perfect! And then they fell apart and, um, well I&#xa0;didn't buy another pair.\") His ideal day off, he says, would be wandering around the markets and flower markets in east London, where he lives. \"I like to sort of drift about.\"</p> <p>West swears a great deal, loudly and with immaculate enunciation, in the manner of Hugh Grant in Four Weddings. Eton educated, he shook&#xa0;off the posh actor label when he scored his&#xa0;role in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/wire\" title=\"\">The Wire</a>; having done that, he is free to play posh again. \"Hector is old-school. He was at D-day. But his ambition means that he has to try to leave that behind, to straddle the old establishment and the new.\" A bit like you then? He starts to laugh. \"Well, I think we both enjoy a&#xa0;party. Wine, women and song, you know.\" He smiles at me, longing for the&#xa0;woman from the Guardian to get wound up, so I ignore him and ask about something else, at which point he cuts in to announce, \"I do quite like winding people up. I enjoy winding Romola up, especially. Probably because I just adore her. The thing about Romola is\" \u2013 he calls her \"Romsey Poms\" only when she's there to be teased, I notice \u2013 \"that she doesn't seem to have the slightest idea how sexy and beautiful she is. Oh, fuck, fuck, don't quote me on that. She'll fucking kill me.\" He actually looks quite scared.</p> <p>The Hour's art director is <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0829378/\" title=\"\">Eve Stewart</a>, whose CV ranges from Mike Leigh films to <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzI4D6dyp_o\" title=\"\">The King's Speech</a>. \"I've never known anyone like her,\" Garai says. \"In one meeting scene, I had a piece of&#xa0;paper in my hand, which you couldn't see on camera, and I looked down and it was a precis of&#xa0;a&#xa0;story that had been mentioned in passing in the script as a story The Hour might have covered&#xa0;that week \u2013 the first African American air&#xa0;hostess, I think it was. And it was a proper printed two-page report, on the original 1950s paper&#xa0;typed on an&#xa0;authentic period typewriter. Factually accurate. I mean, is she mad? But there's something about a&#xa0;show in which every department completely commits to making the&#xa0;show real, which somehow transmits itself to&#xa0;the audience.\"</p> <p>Similarly, the&#xa0;on-set office of <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0147031/\" title=\"\">Suzanne Cave</a>, the costume designer, is plastered with moodboards building a visual backstory for the characters, textured with both contemporary references and those that either layer in other references or add a&#xa0;modern element, helping the clothes read easily to a 21st-century eye. So for Bel's character there are tearsheets from <a href=\"http://www.anothermag.com/exclusives/rachel-weisz\" title=\"\">a shoot of Rachel Weisz in AnOther Magazine</a>, which Cave loved for the saturated block-colour outfits (a true-to-1957 trend that looks right and glamorous for today); for Chancellor's character, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/tv/features/thehour/aps/lix.shtml\" title=\"\">Lix Storm</a>, there are photos of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/katharinehepburn\" title=\"\">Katharine Hepburn</a> and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Susan_Sontag\" title=\"\">Susan Sontag</a>; for Freddie, there is <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/jackkerouac\" title=\"\">Jack Kerouac</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/jamesdean\" title=\"\">James Dean</a>, all turned-up collars and shy swagger.</p> <p>The Hour's costumes are a labour of love. The&#xa0;showgirls' stagewear was created by layering strings of pearls, yards of lace and pieces of jet fringing on to old-fashioned corsetted underwear from John Lewis. But the biggest visual challenge, Stewart says, is \"boring offices. They are quite difficult to get right, because no one takes photographs of their boring offices, so it's&#xa0;hard to get the information. And it's the detail&#xa0;that matters.\"</p> <p>So she was thrilled, when first seeing the Hornsey Town Hall building, to find that the door handles were from the correct period (\"You wouldn't believe how long it can take to source the right door handles\"). \"My job is to create a&#xa0;bubble of belief where the story can become real. I do think that if I can help the actors believe, that transmits itself to the audience, almost in a&#xa0;subliminal way. But on the other hand, I know that this all sounds mad.\"</p> <p><em>\u2022</em> The new series of The Hour begins on BBC2 in November.</p>",
  "<p>Magnus Carlsen is now just four points shy of Garry Kasparov's all-time performance rating record of 2851 points after the world No1 won the Grand Slam final at Bilbao. Carlsen tied with Fabiano Caruana, then crushed the Italian 2-0 in a speed play-off.</p> <p>The 21-year-old's next tournament is a quadrangular in Mexico City in late November, then he will compete in the London Classic at the Olympia conference centre on 1-10 December. This event, now in its fourth year, has fine spectator facilities and offers free admission to children.</p> <p>As usual for the Classic, the opposition is top quality. The world No2, Levon Aronian, reigning world champion, Vishy Anand, Russia's ex-world champion, Vlad Kramnik, US champion, Hikaru Nakamura, and the all-time female No1, Judit Polgar, will be joined by three English grandmasters led by the in-form Luke McShane. But Carlsen has already won the Classic twice and he also likes London, so he will be odds-on to win.</p> <p>Carlsen is regularly compared with other great champions. The most obvious links are to Jos\u00e9 Capablanca and Anatoly Karpov, who were also endgame virtuosos. Carlsen's facility for creating positions, not necessarily favourable, which play on his opponent's technical and psychological weaknesses, echoes Emanuel Lasker who held the world title for a record 27 years.</p> <p>Fewer compare Carlsen to Bobby Fischer, although both have been called&#xa0;'the Mozart of chess'. Unlike the brash and outspoken American, Carlsen&#xa0;is calm, laconic, and likes to ski and play football away from tournaments. Fischer projected his personality and will to win across the board, bombarding&#xa0;his opponent with thought&#xa0;waves.</p> <p>But watching the video where Carlsen destroys Caruana in their blitz decider, I felt I saw Fischer reincarnated. Before the game Caruana sat tense and still, while Carlsen fidgeted in his chair, showed his impatience to start, and radiated energy.</p> <p>Carlsen blitzed out his first nine moves with early central threats. When Caruana erred by 9...a6 (Qc8! 10 Nb5 Qc6) the shot 10 e5! provoked the further mistake Bxg2? (dxe5 11 Bxb7 exd4) and after 12 Qh5! Black could resign.

  "<p>Dolls hold a fascination for us, symbols both of innocence and corruption, death-like miniature people, as likely to inspire revulsion as love. The title of Susan Hill's short novel, <em>Dolly</em>, clearly signals horror, and the path of this deceptively familiar narrative is littered with landmarks of the ghost story. There is a bleak and isolated house, storms, a dreary churchyard abandoned by God, and, as in the earlier <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/fiction/9780099284369/the-mist-in-the-mirror\" title=\"\"><em>Mist in the Mirror</em></a>, warped reflections in mirrors as a symbol of the darker self. For this is also a morality tale, and what better visual metaphor for the soul than the revelation of reflection?</p> <p><em>Dolly</em> is set in the past and has something of a 19th-century sensibility, although cars, electric light and, towards the end of the book, the 1970s are referred to. Much of the narrative is a flashback to a childhood summer, as cousins Edward and Leonora, arriving in the Fens by steam train, meet for the first time to spend the summer at Iyot House with their evocatively named Aunt Kestrel. We are told that Kestrel's sisters, the children's mothers, had \"a life-long feud\"; one drab and brown-haired and jealous of the other, \"an extremely pretty child with blonde bubble-curls\", who grew up to have \"a succession of lovers\" before having Leonora with an older, rich husband. We are not told who brings Edward up, or where he spends the time when not at Iyot, only that Leonora's mother, Violet, travels the globe restlessly, indulging and neglecting her daughter by turns.</p> <p>As in other of her novels, Hill has created a blameless, sensitive male protagonist, not subject to the sins of the female characters yet suffering their disturbing consequences. The book opens with the adult Edward as he revisits Iyot House, now empty, finding himself driven by unseen forces to the graveyard and a certain dusty, dark cupboard in the house. He is disturbed by strange rustling sounds but time has frozen over his disturbing childhood experience. The place acts \"like a pick stabbing through the ice of memory\" and we are transported back to discover it.</p> <p>Anticipating the arrival of her nephew and niece, Aunt Kestrel, unused to children, yearns to please them; but she finds Edward unsettling \u2013 \"opaque and polite\" \u2013 and the unpleasant Leonora more unsettling still. Kestrel observes that Leonora is like her mother, which \"boded ill\", but Mrs Mullen, the housekeeper, has no such delicacy. She represents a more superstitious, but, we sense, more accurate view: Edward is \"namby pamby\" and \"the devil is in Leonora\".</p> <p>Leonora is \"a white-faced child with a halo of red hair\". When crossed she is prey to violent rages, stabbing tea-tables with silver forks, screaming \"without apparently needing to pause for breath\". She is without empathy, bored by Edward's orphaned state, despising of kindness. On Leonora's birthday, her mother sends packages from abroad, which she opens with impatience. She longs desperately for the one thing her mother has never given her \u2013 a doll. Both Edward and Aunt Kestrel, assuming innocence in this desire, try in their own ways to make up to Leonora for her lack of love, but their efforts have horrible consequences. A doll, when it arrives, instead of softening the girl, comes to grotesquely embody the damage of Leonora's soul.</p> <p>While parallels with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2003/jan/18/classics.henryjames\" title=\"\"><em>The Turn of the Screw</em></a> might be assumed, it is not the psychology of the perception of evil that is considered in <em>Dolly</em> but evil itself. The narrative is conventional but an examination of love and the lack of it is the substance of the book. Is evil caused by psychological damage, or is it inherent? It's true that Leonora's mother rejects her, but Edward's situation is at least as tragic; he has no parents at all, and yet he is not \"possessed by a demon\", as even Leonora herself believes \u2013 \"I am, I am.\" The daughter of a selfish, pleasure-seeking woman, she cannot look on her own reflection. Glimpsing her face murkily next to Edward's in a black pool, and later in the church, in a shiny silver plate, she runs away in fearful horror.</p> <p>An assuredly chilling ghost story, <em>Dolly</em> doesn't leave its questions unanswered. Damage is assumed, noted, but not forgiven, and as the story develops evil is passed through the generations like a stain \u2013 in dark places, dank graves, dolls, and ultimately even human flesh.</p> <p>\u2022 Sadie Jones's <em>The Uninvited Guests</em> is published by Chatto.</p>",

But broken glass starts around four to five blocks from the epicentre.</p> <p>There are at least 12 cars that have been destroyed by fire or explosions, including what looked like the car which had the bomb planted in it - it had been flipped over and landed on the hood of an Audi. It had been completely destroyed. There was broken glass throughout all of it. Almost like fallen snow.</p> </blockquote> <p>Sassine is an upper middle class enclave of Christian Beirut that is known for its opposition to the Syrian government making it an unlikely target for the Syrian rebels, Prothero said.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There was nothing specific around it that would indicate a specific or financial target. A few prominent banks have offices in the area. About 150m away is an opposition political party known as March 14th. About 100m away also is a Christian headquarters known as Lebanese forces.</p> <p>From the location of the blast it is difficult to know who is being targeted. My best guess is that someone tried to blow up a car with someone in it. Either a vehicle passing by another vehicle or the bomb was in the vehicle itself.</p> </blockquote> <p>The damage to nearby buildings was substantial, but did not suggest the blast occurred inside one of them.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There is a very prominent Syrian bank that was located right next to [the scene]. Several banks have offices there so its a possibility that a bank official was targeted.</p> <p>I would think it was unlikely to be a political act of violence against the Syrians based on its location, because this is probably the most devoutly anti-Syrian neighbourhood in all of Lebanon. So for somebody to set a car bomb off in an attempt to kill a Syrian official [would have known] they were going to put the lives of many people at risk. That seems unlikely to me, but it is Lebanon so anything is possible.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-canonical-url=\"\" >  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;ab-player&quot; data-boourl=&quot;http://audioboo.fm/boos/1015330-journalist-witness-to-beirut-bomb-scene-says-death-toll-set-to-increase-and-anti-syria-attack-unlikely/embed&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://audioboo.fm/boos/1015330-journalist-witness-to-beirut-bomb-scene-says-death-toll-set-to-increase-and-anti-syria-attack-unlikely&quot;&gt;listen to &amp;#x2018;Journalist witness to Beirut bomb scene says death toll set to increase and anti-Syria attack unlikely&amp;#x2019; on Audioboo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;(function() { var po = document.createElement(&quot;script&quot;); po.type = &quot;text/javascript&quot;; po.async = true; po.src = &quot;http://d15mj6e6qmt1na.cloudfront.net/assets/embed.js&quot;; var s = document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;)[0]; s.parentNode.insertBefore(po, s); })();&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-50816045c0e343ef1abc7cc3\" class=\"block is-summary\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-19T14:14:29.432Z\">3.14pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">'A terrorist act', says information minister</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The Lebanese information minister has described the explosion in Beirut as \"a terrorist act\".</p> <p>Al-Jazeera reports that security forces are clearing people from the area to preserve the \"crime scene\" for investigators.

In fact, the killing by the regime has increased more since Brahimi started to talk about the truce.</p> <p>Come here to Maarat al-Numan and see. Every day we have 20 or 30 martyrs falling by the aerial and artillery shelling by the regime. What truce is Brahimi talking about? Let him come here and have a look.</p> <p>Bashar [al-Assad] and his group are liars. They might say that they accept the truce but in reality they will never stop the killing and the shelling.

  "<p>\"Nobody knows where Gaddafi is buried,\" said Abubaker Ali, a 29-year-old volunteer with the forces massed at the Sufageen forward base in the Libyan desert. Squinting towards the horizon where a pall of black smoke rose from the town of Bani Walid, hidden behind a line of barren hills, he said: \"He's buried in the desert. But nine-tenths of Libya is desert.\"</p> <p>Muammar Gaddafi was captured and killed by rebels a year ago on Saturday and buried somewhere under the rust-coloured sand. The location of the grave is a closely guarded secret, but in the same stretch of sand the same rebel forces \u2013 now wearing government uniforms \u2013 prepare a final push into the last of his strongholds. Bani Walid, 90 miles from Tripoli, was supposed to have fallen a year ago. Instead Gaddafi's former henchmen and officials have turned the town into a bastion.</p> <p>The Libyan leader's bloody death is one of the images seared in Libya's collective memory. Trapped in Sirte, his birthplace, on the coast, he tried to escape in a convoy that was bombed by Nato on 20 October last year. Rebel forces found him hiding in a roadside culvert, and mobile phone footage of the time shows him being dragged away, kicked and punched, with blood running from a head wound. Shortly afterwards he was shot dead by an unknown gunman. His body was laid out on public display in Misrata, the hardest-hit of the rebel cities, before being transported south for burial.</p> <p>The year since his death has been one of chaos and violence. In January pro-Gaddafi loyalists in Beni Walid rebelled, chasing government forces out of the town. Last month they kidnapped and killed one of the Misrata militiamen credited with Gaddafi's capture.</p> <p>The former transitional authorities were unable to stitch together a country riven by mistrust and anger after 40 years of ruthless dictatorship. Savage battles continue to erupt across much of the country, some score-settling, some the work of jihadists, who last month claimed the life of the US ambassador Chris Stevens.</p> <p>Elections in July for the first truly democratic parliament in Libya's history were a success, but the result has so far been a failure: a parliament so riven with ideological, tribal and regional rivalries that, three months on, it cannot agree on a new government.</p> <p>Ali was anxious to get back to his studies \u2013 a PhD in civil engineering at a university in El Paso, Texas \u2013 but said Beni Walid represented unfinished business. \"People are tired,\" he said with a shake of the head. \"They really want an end of all this.\"</p> <p>The mood was the same in the impromptu camps set up in a wide elongated ring around Beni Walid. Abdul Fatah worked as an intensive care nurse during last year's revolution, and has left his medical studies to serve in a tented field hospital here. \"They want to finish it on the 20th of October because it's the same time they caught Gaddafi,\" he said.</p> <p>Tanks and heavy artillery were being moved up along the few highways around this base, ready for the resumption of battle after a truce to encourage civilians to flee. According to Abdul Fatah, Libya's problems rest foremost with the politicians, and their failure to put national interest before their own. \"The people in power don't think about Libya, they think about themselves, that is the problem,\" he said. \"The first thing the national congress did was to appoint themselves high salaries.\"</p> <p>The government, to no one's surprise, is divided over Beni Walid: government-appointed militias are conducting the offensive on their own initiative, with ministers sitting on their hands, in part for fear of civilian casualties. Beni Walid is only one of a dozen security headaches. The Islamist militia blamed for the killing of Stevens in Benghazi is now holed up in the forested Green Mountains, but army commanders surrounding them say they cannot get orders to move in. Smuggling gangs continue to battle one another along the southern border with Sudan and Niger and the western border with Tunisia.</p> <p>The mountain town of Zintan, home of one of Libya's most powerful militia armies, continues to hold Gaddafi's son Saif al-Islam, refusing to hand him over either to the government or to the international criminal court. The government's own police force, the supreme security committee, is accused of standing aside in August and allowing Salafist extremists to bulldoze a Sufi Shrine in downtown Tripoli. Meanwhile, Libya continues to disintegrate. There is no central refuse collection in Tripoli, so mountains of garbage have built up amid the ruins of Gaddafi's former home at Ban Aziza.</p> <p>On the highway east of the capital, plantations of trees created to halt the encroachment of the Sahara have been systematically cut down by criminal gangs selling the timber. Pensions go unpaid, schools struggle for books, and at the Libyan stock exchange chains of zeros on the glowing screens show the almost total absence of investor activity. Libya's Facebook generation, the young people who used the web to spread news of last year's revolution, is struggling with internet provision recently revealed to be one of the slowest in Africa.</p> <p>At the root of the problem is the inexperience of last year's revolutionaries with the levers of power. Gaddafi's dictatorship was so absolute and all pervasive that the only organisation not controlled by the state was, famously, the Boy Scouts. The result is that a year after liberation, Libyans are still blinking in the sunlight, unsure of how to operate after four decades of having decisions made for them.</p> <p>Gaddafi did not even leave the people he ruled with a parliament building. The national congress is instead forced to sit in a cramped conference centre converted to the task. And so little faith do ordinary Libyans have in the system that each day small knots of protesters barge through the main gates to make their voices heard, literally at parliament's door.</p> <p>Hassan el-Amin, an independent MP who returned to Libya after 28 years of political exile in Britain, sat in an ante room in the conference centre, listening to the shouts of a dozen amputees who say this is their last hope to get war pensions the government had promised them. The guards and staff argued back, the protesters continued for an hour, then went home in dismay. \"The big issue in Libya is security,\" Amin said. \"The political scene, at least you have an elected body, that's not the issue. The issue is security, security, security.\"</p> <p>Libya today is not a single state but a collection of fiefdoms. Some work better than others: Misrata, Libya's third city, is booming, and Tripoli, the capital, has seen regular police take the place of militias. But Stevens's killing shattered what remained of foreign business, with trade delegations staying away and embassies shedding staff. Palm City, a luxurious seafront complex for diplomats and foreign executives, is half-empty.</p> <p>Benghazi's population was so enraged by that killing and government inaction that protesters took matters into their own hands, storming a series of Islamist militia bases late last month. \"There are some people who want Benghazi to be like Somalia, everyone killing each other,\" said Hanna el-Galal, a civil rights activist in the city. \"Most Benghazians want to work together, men and women, for the common good.\"</p> <p>And some voices here call for patience. \"It was 42 years of dictatorship, that is a long time,\" said Mohammed bin Tahar, an electrical engineer serving as a volunteer unloading wounded soldiers from helicopters at Misrata's hospital. \"It is not easy to change the way people think in just a year.\"</p>",
  "<p>There are modern-day Welsh folk heroes and, several rungs further up, there is Adam Jones. Everybody loves him, from his grateful national coach, Warren Gatland, to the woman whose car he pushed up the road this week after she ran out of petrol. \"When I'd finished she also said she wanted a picture of me pushing it.\" Anonymity remains a forlorn concept for the dragonhood's favourite rugby men.</p> <p>In the case of Jones the prop, this is partly his own fault. There is only one more instantly recognisable shaggy mop of hair in Britain, which must explain why a certain Boris Johnson is the hirsute Osprey's No1 fan. The mayor of London even phoned him up before <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2011/oct/15/rugby-world-cup-warburton-wales-france\" title=\"\">last year's World Cup semi-final against France</a> to deliver praise of the \"Cro-Magnon man\" in red. Johnson has also subsequently written a piece for Jones's testimonial brochure \u2013 \"Anyone in public life with hair like that gets my vote\" \u2013 to consummate the pair's improbable bond.</p> <p>The mayor is not alone in his high regard for the Hair Bear. Jones, due to rumble into Welford Road on Sunday for a crucial Heineken Cup pool tussle with Leicester, is currently not just the best tighthead in Wales but the British Isles and, arguably, the world. England's Alex Corbisiero, among others, rates him the best anywhere.</p> <p>During Wales's three grand slam triumphs since 2005, Jones played in 14 of the 15 games. Only Gareth Edwards, JPR Williams and Gerald Davies among the great Welsh legends of the 1970s enjoyed such a glorious hat-trick. If he suddenly withdrew from this autumn's internationals, a nation would have a collective seizure.</p> <p>The big man has achieved more than seemed probable in 2003 when he was hauled off the field by the then-coach Steve Hansen 30 minutes into a World Cup quarter-final. Even now, after 85 Test matches, he appreciates the consolatory pint England's Jason Leonard bought him afterwards. \"It was tough. I'd just had my heart broken. I did struggle at the time and didn't take it the right way.\"</p> <p>At least he can joke about it now. Not long ago the mischievous All Black lock Ali Williams urged Jones to approach Hansen at a reception for a belated explanation. \"I'd had about four pints when Ali Williams says: 'Come on, let's go and ask him why he subbed you.' The answer was: 'He was too unfit.' And there was me still holding a pint of Carling.\"</p> <p>It is a classic self-deprecating Jones punchline. If he achieves his goal of 100 Test caps and playing in the 2015 Rugby World Cup he will say Wales were simply short of No3s. He also prefers to give credit to Gatland. \"It was funny it took another New Zealander to come in and kick me up the arse. He's been a massive influence. He pretty much told me if I wasn't a certain weight I could forget it.\"</p> <p>The conditioning staff at the Ospreys and Wales have, as a result, often had their work cut out. Jones gazes thoughtfully at an empty pint of Diet Coke and muses on the chocolate and chips of yesteryear. \"I used to be a bit chunky but I went quite fat when I was 16. I don't know what happened but by the time I turned 18 I weighed 23 stone. Too many flagons of cider, too many under-age beers maybe.\" These days his programme weight is 19st 7lb but his focus has altered. A self\u2011confessed rugby nut \u2013 \"I need to get a life, really\" \u2013 he will spend hours watching games at home in Merthyr, squirrelling away nuggets of information about future opponents.</p> <p>One day, one suspects, he will make a fine scrummaging coach. He is already a passionate believer in backing young props, rather than hauling them off at the first sign of trouble. Attitude and technique, he feels, ultimately count for more than raw power. \"I'm reasonably strong but not phenomenally so. There are backs in the Welsh squad who are stronger than me.\"</p> <p>The Lions hierarchy, not to mention Wales and a less <em>gal\u00e1ctico</em>-stuffed Ospreys team, feel differently. Not only can the 31-year-old be relied upon to stiffen any pack but his premature exit from the 2009 Lions series with a dislocated shoulder had a profound impact. The local relief when he rejected lucrative French offers to remain in Ospreylia until 2014 was considerable. He is also a hugely entertaining raconteur, full of tales such as the day his team-mate Ian Evans knocked himself out on the concrete ceiling of the tunnel before a game at the Liberty Stadium. \"He was jumping up and down prior to kick-off \u2026 next thing we know he's smashed his head on the ceiling and his knees have gone.\"</p> <p>Evans also had the dressing room in stitches <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/oct/12/ospreys-treviso-heineken-cup\" title=\"\">before last week's Treviso game</a>, pushing a pretend vacuum cleaner around and wielding an imaginary feather duster to Queen's I Want To Break Free, slightly undermining Alun Wyn Jones's passionate pre-match team talk. Just as well, perhaps, that the Ospreys subsequently won 38-17.</p> <p>Sunday's meeting with Leicester is serious stuff \u2013 \"Dan Cole's a good player&#xa0;\u2026&#xa0;England are lucky they've got him\" \u2013 but Jones feels professionalism and fun have a place. \"Myself, Gethin Jenkins and Mike Phillips are the last of a certain generation. We played when it was semi-professional. I played for Abercrave RFC up in the valleys, against older guys, getting beaten up on a regular basis. Everyone after us has been in an academy. I think it is a problem.\"</p> <p>Polite scepticism is also reserved for the Polish ice chambers to which the Welsh squad are headed next week. \"I'm sure there's scientific evidence it does work but I've never woken the next morning thinking: 'Ah, I'm ready to go 15 rounds now.' Maybe that's just me getting cynical in my old age.\"</p> <p>Either way, the mechanic's son with the shaggy locks who once had a job making patio slabs proves rugby still caters for all sorts. \"When I first came in the old boys were saying: 'Props shouldn't have hair like that,' but I think it suits me.\" He grabs a ringlet and sniffs it as if it were a freshly-poured glass of wine. \"It's a bit smelly, it's not the nicest hair in the world but I haven't had it cut for a year.\"</p> <p>So much for trivial details. It is the remarkable man beneath the frizz we should really be celebrating.</p> <p><em>Details of Adam Jones's testimonial evening in Cardiff next month can be found at </em><a href=\"http://www.adamjones3.com\" title=\"\"><em>www.adamjones3.com</em></a><em> </em></p>",
  "<p>The Trades Union Congress march on Saturday is being held under the slogan \"A Future that Works\" as part of a campaign to force the government to consider alternatives to austerity measures. Here are some ideas from across the political spectrum.</p> <h2>1. Activist industrial policy</h2> <p>A version of picking winners, where the government backs certain sectors with significant funding support, whether direct grants or through an infrastructure bank. One clear example, already backed by successive governments, is aerospace. It could joined by, for instance, electric cars and tidal power.</p> <p><strong>Backers:</strong> Vince Cable, and Lord Adonis all favour a more dynamic industrial landscape.</p> <p><strong>Feasibility:</strong> high, if the government of the day can find the money and policies to back the underlying requirements. In the words of Lord Adonis, the following need prolonged backing: skills, technology, innovation, government procurement, infrastructure, finance, and supply chains. Picking winners is not as simple as it sounds.</p> <p><strong>Will it work?</strong> Yes, but this is a long-term strategy that requires political consensus, from changes to education policy to supporting industries that have long lead-times (civil aircraft programmes work on 30-40 year cycles, for instance).</p> <h2>2. Specialist banks</h2> <p>Create a state bank or a series of specialist banks, targeted at specific sectors. This could be a national infrastructure bank (for roads), a national green bank (for tidal power), regional banks (akin to the German Landesbank system) or a small to medium-sized business bank. This is a long and impractical wish list \u2013 setting up one bank is difficult enough \u2013 but Vince Cable, the business secretary, has already announced plans for a \"business bank\" that could leverage up to \u00a310bn.</p> <p><strong>Backers:</strong> TUC, Cable, the Labour party.</p> <p><strong>Feasibility:</strong> high, but funding is the issue.</p> <p><strong>Will it work?</strong> It would need strict lending parameters, to prevent the Fannie-Mae-and-Freddie-Mac-style sprees that stoked the US housing boom.</p> <h2>3. Corporate governance overhaul</h2> <p>This would see more employees represented on management boards and remuneration committees in a way similar to the German stakeholder system. Lord Glasman, the Labour life peer, says it will harness the energy, skills and commitment of a workforce. \"A third of the board should be reserved for capital, a third for the workforce and a third for users and local interests. This would enable the negotiation of a corporate strategy in which the good of the firm is owned by each of its principle stakeholders. Accountability is too important to be left to accountants. That is a fundamental lesson of the crash.\"</p> <p><strong>Backers:</strong> Germany, Glasman.</p> <p><strong>Feasibility:</strong> low, because it is unlikely that the City, shareholders or companies would comply without legislation.</p> <p><strong>Will it work?</strong> Representatives would have to be put on Plc boards, not management boards, or companies would find a way around them.</p> <h2>4. Cut middle-class benefits to fund infrastructure spending</h2> <p>The Social Market Foundation (SMF), a thinktank, argues that benefits for the comparatively better-off should be cut and reinvested in infrastructure. Around \u00a315bn could be raised by cutting free bus passes and television licences for some better-off pensioners, as well as halving higher-rate pension tax relief and axing child benefits for the top 50% of earners.</p> <p><strong>Backers:</strong> SMF. Ian Mulheirn, director of the SMF, says: \"We are screaming out for infrastructure investment, but if we are worried about funding it with extra borrowing, then the answer is to cut middle-class benefits that do nothing for growth.\"</p> <p><strong>Feasibility:</strong> medium. The Conservatives will not want to cut pension tax relief for a core segment of their voters. Labour and the Liberal Democrats would be more sympathetic.</p> <p><strong>Will it work?</strong> It would be a significant public spending cut and the funds could be leveraged, so it would definitely get projects started, although the boost would be medium- to long-term.</p> <h2>5. 'Guerilla economic development'</h2> <p>An idea floated by Karel Williams and Sukhdev Johal from the CRESCCresc research centre at the University of Manchester. Under one example, local council pension funds would be used to build social housing. These houses would be built on terrain such as land banks compulsorily purchased from housing developers and retailers such as Tesco. Similarly, public assets could be put in public trust for use by the local community. The Conservative MP for Dover, Charlie Elphicke, is trying to buy Dover Port on behalf of the local population.</p> <p><strong>Backers:</strong> Karel Williams and Sukhdev Johal, Charlie Elphicke</p> <p><strong>Feasibility:</strong> taking land off Tesco is illegal, but compulsory purchasing orders offer a way around that. The Port of Dover faces fewer legal impediments.</p> <p><strong>Will it work?</strong> Again, success would be long-term but it would effectively devolve economic power to local councils and regions.</p> <h2>6. Adopt the full Beecroft report</h2> <p>The report into employment law by Adrian Beecroft, a venture capitalist, is viewed as something of a rightwing nuclear option. Elements of the report have been decried by Cable as \"complete nonsense\", led by proposals to make it easier for firms to sack underperforming staff. Nonetheless, George Osborne's suggestion that workers give up employment rights in exchange for shares is seen as a follow-up to the report.</p> <p><strong>Backers:</strong> Adrian Beecroft</p> <p><strong>Feasibility:</strong> unlikely because of the likely reaction of centrist voters and Liberal Democrats.</p> <p><strong>Will it work?</strong> The effect would be immediate but it could be unexpected \u2013 strikes, for instance.</p> <h2>\u2022 Change the Bank of England inflation target to a nominal GDP growth target</h2> <p>Instead of focusing on a 2% inflation target, the monetary policy committee \u2013 which sets interest rates \u2013 could go for economic growth instead.</p> <p><strong>Backers:</strong> the US economist Scott Sumner.</p> <p><strong>Feasibility:</strong> the BoE would have to be convinced that it would not lead to spiralling inflation.</p> <p><strong>Will it work?</strong> If it resulted in GDP rising, the BoE would have to be vigilant to ensure that inflation did not wipe out the benefits.</p> <h2>8. The Alistair Darling plan</h2> <p>The plan of halving the economic deficit over four years \u2013 Labour's 2010 general election policy \u2013 would have led to less stringent spending cuts than those envisaged under the coalition. George Osborne has targeted eliminating the deficit by 2015.</p> <p><strong>Backers:</strong> Darling.</p> <p><strong>Feasibility:</strong> nil, given the election result.</p> <p><strong>Will it work?</strong> If that plan had been put to the electorate now, the general election result might have been different. It would have taken less demand out of the economy too.</p> <h2>9. Relax immigration restrictions</h2> <p>Jonathan Portes at the National Institute of Economic and Social Research (NIESR) argues that the government should lower barriers to skilled immigrants from outside the European Union. He also argues that restrictions on non-EU students, and rules on their ability to secure jobs in the UK, should be relaxed.</p> <p><strong>Backers:</strong> NIESR.</p> <p><strong>Feasibility:</strong> unlikely under a government with Conservative leanings.</p> <p><strong>Will it work?</strong> NIESR's ideas certainly get a sympathetic hearing from sections of the business community, which are crying out for skilled labour.</p> <h2>10. Tax increases</h2> <p>\u2022 The TUC is calling for a number of tax changes to raise income and reduce the impact of the recession on the less well-off. It wants to equalise the rates for income tax and capital gains tax, to restore the top rate of tax to 50p, introduce a \"Robin Hood\" tax on financial transactions and abolish the domicile rule that allows people to avoid UK tax.</p> <p><strong>Backers:</strong> TUC.</p> <p><strong>Feasibility:</strong> Osborne is not expected to reverse the reduction of the top tax rate from 45p to 50p.</p> <p><strong>Will it work?</strong> The Robin Hood tax, in particular, needs an international consensus that would be difficult to achieve. A 50p reversal would appeal to voters.</p>",

  "<p>A Congolese rebel group accused of killings, mass rapes and other atrocities is taking groups of tourists on gorilla treks to the Virunga national park and using the proceeds to fund its insurgency.</p> <p>Government authorities were forced to withdraw from parts of the park earlier this year because of the advance by M23 rebels, and now tourists wanting to see the rare mountain gorillas are being led by rangers who have defected to the militia.</p> <p>A tour operator based in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jul/09/congo-rebels-capture-key-towns-conflict\" title=\"\">Bunagana, a border town that has been held by the M23</a> since early July, said international tourists were still coming to the park, at a cost of more than $350 (\u00a3218) a day.</p> <p>\"We had 39 visitors in August alone,\" said Laurent Ntawukiruwe, director of Shoushou Safari Tours. \"I have agents in many different countries that help to bring tourists in. We have had German and Italian visitors, and soon we will have some French coming.\" A group of British tourists were booked to visit on 29 October, but cancelled their reservation.</p> <p>Ntawukiruwe said his tours were run by rangers who had defected to M23, which is fighting an insurgency against the Democratic Republic of the Congo government. \"The four rangers \u2026 are now in collaboration with M23,\" he said.</p> <p>In September, a <a href=\"http://www.hrw.org/news/2012/09/11/dr-congo-m23-rebels-committing-war-crimes\" title=\"\">report by Human Rights Watch</a> accused the M23 fighters of committing \"widespread war crimes, including summary executions, rapes, and forced recruitment\". The UN has accused neighbouring Rwanda of supporting the rebels, prompting a number of countries to freeze aid to President Paul Kagame's government.</p> <p>The outbreak of hostilities between M23 and the Congolese army in May forced the Congolese National Park Authorities (the ICCN) to shut down its tourism activity. Shoushou Safari Tours has an ICCN sign on display at its Bunagana office, but the operation has no link to the legitimate park authorities, said Virunga park director Emmanuel de Merode.</p> <p>\"These tours have absolutely nothing to do with us,\" said De Merode. \"This puts the gorillas and the visitors at risk. You need to have well-trained staff to lead these tours \u2013 handling mountain gorillas is an extremely sensitive issue. These expeditions are detrimental to the park and we condemn them in the strongest terms.\"</p> <p>Vianney Harakandi in the Virunga park tourism office in Goma confirmed that a handful of rangers had defected to join M23. He criticised Shoushou Safari Tours for trying to suggest the expeditions were official, saying it was an attempt to disguise the fact that the tours were aiding M23. \"Ultimately the money the tourists pay will just reinforce the capacity of this illegal armed group,\" he said.</p> <p>Eugene Rwabuhihi, from the M23 department of tourism, environment and conservation, suggested the rebels were planning to step up the operation. \"We are preparing for tourism activities and securing the gorilla population,\" he said. \"When tourists come, they will pay to see the gorillas and we will receive part of that money for providing their security.\"</p> <p>Tourists pay $300 for the permit to see the gorillas, $50 for transportation and $10 for the guides. It is unclear how much of this goes to the rebel group. But it is significantly cheaper than visits to see mountain gorillas in Uganda and Rwanda, where permits alone cost $500 and $750 respectively.</p> <p>Tourists wanting to see the gorillas usually fly to the Ugandan capital, Kampala, before driving to the Congolese border and crossing into Bunagana, where they stay in the Mountain Gorilla hotel. The hotel has recently hosted meetings of high-ranking M23 military commanders.</p> <p>Because the border crossing is controlled by M23, the tourists no longer have to obtain a Congolese visa. \"It is much simpler for me like this, because I don't have to pay for my visa, or organise all sorts of different permits and passes,\" said Abdel, a French tourist who has booked with Shoushou and did not want to reveal his surname. \"I am fascinated by the Congo, but I've never been. I'm going into a war zone and there is a lot that I don't know. I'm going there to learn, to get that knowledge.\"</p> <p>Abdel, who lives in Kampala, said he was not concerned that the tours were being conducted by, and make profits for, an armed rebel group. \"I want to be able to see the gorillas without lots of other tourists around, but this is also an experience that will allow me to see many things I've never seen before.</p> <p>\"I am keeping an open mind. The situation there is complicated; it's not as simple as saying 'the rebels are bad, the government is good'.</p> <p>\"My father fought in the Algerian resistance against France, and back then they called him a terrorist. But he was a freedom fighter.\"</p> <h2>National park plagued by death</h2> <p>Virunga is the oldest and most bio-diverse national park in Africa, but it has been ravaged by the cyclical violence that has plagued eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo over the last 25 years.</p> <p>The fall of Mobutu Sese Seko in the 1980s brought violence and poachers. Animal populations, especially of large mammals, were severely affected. The Rwandan genocide and subsequent Congo wars brought further instability, with the rebel Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda establishing itself in the centre of the park.</p> <p>This instability culminated in the Kivu conflict of 2004 to 2009, where Laurent Nkunda's National Congress for the Defence of the People rebels built their strongholds in and around Virunga.</p> <p>His fighters finally signed a peace agreement in March 2009 and integrated into the Congolese army, allowing the Congolese National Park Authorities to oversee the recovery of Virunga's plants and wildlife, especially the rare mountain gorillas. Tourists had begun to return in increasing numbers; in 2009 the park received 550 visitors, by 2010 that figure rose to 3,000, and was projected to reach 6,000 this year.</p> <p>But in April those former fighters mutinied again, forming M23. The M23 commanders have taken key towns in and around the park, and for now it is largely under M23 control.</p> <p>Park authorities have been forced to suspend tourism again, and rangers risk their lives as they seek to ensure the security of the local Congolese people and Virunga's mountain gorillas. More than 130 rangers have been killed since 1996, including one in May.</p>",
  "<p>The rules of discussing class in Britain are, pleasingly, very like those of cricket. Once you know them, they seem incredibly obvious and intuitive and barely worth mentioning; if you don't know them, they are pointlessly, sadistically complicated, their exclusivity almost an exercise in snobbery in its own right. Nowhere is this more evident and yet more tacit than in relationships: people marry into their own class. It's called \"assortative mating\". You know this by looking around, yet there's such profound squeamishness about it that research tends to cluster around class proxies. The question goes: \"Do you and your spouse share the same educational attainment?\" (Translation: are you the same class?) Or: \"Did you go to the same university?\" (Translation: are you really, really the same class?)</p> <p>This trend is immune to social progress elsewhere. If anything, people are more likely than ever to marry into their own class, as a&#xa0;report from the Institute for Public Policy Research showed this year. Of people born in 1958, just over a third of women had a partner from the same class as themselves: 38% married up, while 23% married down. For those born in 1970, 45% married into the same class; of those born between 1976 and 1981, 56% married into the same class, with a far smaller proportion (16%) marrying up.</p> <p>Even the phrases \"marrying up\" and \"marrying down\" are sullying to use. You can't really escape the connotation that the rich are better than the poor. But I use them anyway, putting them in the grammatical equivalent of surgical gloves, because there is no right-on alternative: there's no unsnobbish way to convey a difference in class between two people. The leftwards path is to pretend class doesn't exist. Which is fine, but it's also total horse manure.</p> <p>So what's it actually like, when you don't mate assortatively? Emily Wyndham married her husband 11 years ago this week. They met at Oxford University. \"I'd describe my parents as working class made good,\" she says. \"My father had to leave school at 16 for financial reasons, but he became a businessman, they built a hotel. Not anywhere nice \u2013 it was in a crap industrial coastal town they forgot to close down. In doing so, they made quite a lot of money \u2013 enough to send us to private school \u2013 so we were the first generation of our family to go to university. He's always very keenly been aware of his position in life, and always very keenly felt he was working class, and wanted to assimilate himself to become middle class. He's very class-conscious. He reads the Telegraph; he's voted Tory for years and years.</p> <p>\"I didn't feel aware of class differences at university. Three of my closest friends had been to comps; we were all pretty much lower middle class, all from quite similar backgrounds.\"</p> <p>She met her future husband while she was having tea with a student from another college. \"I&#xa0;think she actually said, 'He's very posh.' \" They got together just after finals. \"It was never an issue; I just knew he was very nicely spoken, as my mother would say. I think quite early on in our relationship he went off shooting. It was like he'd moved to another world that I hadn't known existed. When we were in&#xa0;our final term, he went to his cousin's birthday and I said, 'That sounds very posh.' And he said rather sheepishly, 'Well, he is an earl.' And I thought, 'Oh fuck. This is way outside anything I've ever experienced.' \"</p> <p>She met his parents one month into the relationship. \"I think they were a bit underwhelmed. I smoked at the time. I'm so embarrassed to think of this now, but I think I&#xa0;smoked between courses and they were appalled. Generally, I got the impression that I was being looked up and down and found rather wanting. But, in my favour, his sister was going out with someone who was even more low-class than me. They wanted him to marry someone who had grown up around the corner, whose parents they knew and of whom they approved. They attached no value at all to academic prowess. They hadn't heard of my parents, so they weren't interested in&#xa0;me. And also, I think they just slightly thought that I was a little bit too loud \u2013 not the quietly understated, elegant person that would fit into their quietly understated, elegant lifestyle.\"</p> <p>When Emily introduced her parents to his \u2013 at <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2000/oct/01/foodanddrink.restaurants\" title=\"\">the smart Islington restaurant Granita</a> \u2013 that went quite well. \"The worst was the wedding. My parents were sending out invitations, but they were on their uppers because their business had gone to pot. So they weren't paying, but because they're quite proud, I&#xa0;wanted them to feel like they were still the hosts. The invitations had to come from them. And there were all these titles, and they'd been told his aged aunt would only open invitations that were correctly addressed. My mum was very much, 'They'll just have to take us as they find us.' But my dad was going, 'No, no, no, it's got to be right.' He was shitting himself that somehow he would make some terrible faux pas and our lowly beginnings would be revealed.</p> <p>\"In his speech, he actually said, 'It's quite clear to all of us that Tom's married above himself.' It brought the house down \u2013 in the brilliant way of the British class system, where nobody ever says anything but everybody notices everything.\"</p> <p>Emily was 26 when she married. The wedding sounds very stressful: if you're a Catholic and not the Brideshead sort, apparently it's immediately obvious how ill bred you are to people who know about that sort of thing. I wonder why she didn't put it off a bit longer. \"My biological clock had been on speed-dial for a long time. I knew at 20 that I&#xa0;didn't want to be with someone I couldn't foresee a future with. And Tom was not that bothered about class \u2013 he couldn't have married anybody who was a class warrior, who thought everything he stood for was awful. He had to feel that he could be himself, and he did, and so did I.</p> <p>\"He said, 'Marrying you has taken me out of the&#xa0;upper class and put me into the middle class.' I know he was joking, but equally, there's an element of truth to it.\"</p> <p>And what about their four children, ranging in age from 18 months to 10? \"I'd say they are upper middle class, or possibly even middle-middle. In purely class terms, the decision about secondary school will be major. If they go to the state school, they will very obviously be different from their grandparents and even from their parents. I don't want them to grow up feeling completely divorced from their grandparents and their cousins. Although, of course, they're already divorced from my father's side.\"</p> <p>(Lady) Alice Douglas has been with Steve for six years. Previously, she was married to Simon, whom she met while he was serving nine years in prison for armed robbery. \"If I look at all my boyfriends, mostly they'd be working class. I don't know if that was a conscious decision, but certainly as a&#xa0;child I was always utterly devastated if anyone found out I had a title. It was just this terrible secret. Then, when I started going out with boys, I&#xa0;always preferred working-class boys. Now I&#xa0;live in a little Welsh village that is full of farmers and everyone's pretty working class, and my favourite thing is going to the pub at weekends and hanging out with all the farmers. I like people who work the land. I&#xa0;guess it's a sense of history, a sense of honesty. It's just life on a more basic level.\"</p> <p>Her first husband was a Turkish refugee, and that marriage failed because he couldn't stand living in England. \"My second husband I met when I was in a drama production at a prison. He was a&#xa0;typical working-class young lad who had masses of intelligence \u2013 he had such a lot to offer, but had failed to do anything beyond the army. I think that, because of his working-class roots, when he went up for jobs, he didn't really believe he should get them. Probably what class gives you is a belief that you can achieve things.\"</p> <p>They bonded over playing Macbeth and Lady Macbeth in the prison production, and married while he was still inside. He was five and a half years younger. \"We had a big, crazy wedding. Most people were cool about it, and I kind of ignored the ones that weren't. I don't know that there were that many differences. There were funny things \u2013 like if I was getting some building work and people were quoting, because I'd got a&#xa0;title and they didn't know me very well, it always seemed it was a bigger quote than if my ex-husband asked.</p> <p>\"Once, we were asked to go on Richard &amp; Judy. If Simon, my ex, ever tried to negotiate a fee for things like that, people were very dismissive and often rude to him \u2013 they'd quibble over 50 quid. Whereas if I asked, we might get \u00a31,000. It shows how ingrained it is, that if a person is of a higher class, they're worth more.\"</p> <p>The couple had two children, now 13 and 12, and split up over the classic things that split parents up, regardless of class: maturity, reliability, who's still in the pub and who isn't. \"The children are blessed with being comfortable in any class. They are just as happy with their grandma on Simon's side on a&#xa0;council estate as they are with my parents.\"</p> <p>Then she met Steve. \"I fell in love with him, and for about four years, he said, 'I love you, but I can't possibly get involved. Your life is too chaotic, it's too full on, there are too many people and I want a simple life.' It took four years to wear him down.\"</p> <p>Steve agrees with this analysis, pretty much: \"It's just so manic here. We're a clash of personalities really. Alice is definitely a go-getter and I'm more laid-back. I was brought up by very working-class parents. During the 1970s, growing up, there was work for everybody. My father, a maintenance fitter, always instilled in me not to be resentful of the upper classes, or the people bred into money, because they're the ones who create the work. Alice was born into wealth and power, but she'd never use it \u2013 she's absolutely down to earth. Although I do catch her up now and then on her accent. I've looked through every dictionary I can find, and I just can't find any R that would explain her pronunciation of bath.</p> <p>\"When I introduced her to my parents, they probably felt more concerned for Alice, really. They thought she could have been with somebody who could have given her a lot more \u2013 somebody far more independent and financially stable. But as soon as they met her and saw how sweet she was, that was it.\"</p> <p>Julia Stephenson met her boyfriend, Steve, seven years ago. \"I'm more middle class,\" she says, \"and he's working class. But I don't know if one can really describe one's own class. I've been pitched as more upper middle class just because of this flighty life I used to live. I didn't go to university, I&#xa0;left school and then went to <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucie_Clayton_Charm_Academy\" title=\"\">Lucie Clayton's Secretarial College</a>. I was a Sloane Ranger, but I&#xa0;think a lot of people managed to be Sloane Rangers without necessarily being very wealthy.\"</p> <p>Her mother and father had had the same class gap, to which she attributes the marital problems that saw them divorce when she was seven. \"Her&#xa0;parents were very snotty and disapproving \u2013 they barely spoke to him \u2013 and they sent her off to&#xa0;Argentina for six months, but it didn't work. And then he went off and had affairs, because I&#xa0;think when men feel inadequate like that, they try to get validation from elsewhere.\"</p> <p>When Julia was young, she liked posh boys with&#xa0;snazzy cars, and got married in that mould at 26, but that didn't work out. \"I never would have met Steve if we weren't both Buddhists. But&#xa0;then we went on a Buddhist course to Japan and he really pursued me, which was heavenly. He was so confident. And that's when I realised that working-class men are where it's at. If only I'd realised that before my early 40s. As it was, I&#xa0;was pursuing these rather effete old Etonians. I&#xa0;like working-class men, anyway. I like the accent, I like the fact that they're always going to&#xa0;pubs and also, most importantly, how handy they are. They're always doing things round the house. He's built an extension. He's got four equally handy brothers and they all came round and helped him.</p> <p>\"My family were just delighted that I'd met anybody at all. My dad liked him, too. It's not like I was 21 and a young virgin needing protection. There are differences that are annoying. It annoys me that he likes all his food overcooked. He doesn't want to see any blood in meat. But, no, we don't have major differences. He left school when he was 15, but I left when I was 17, anyway. He has a very inquiring mind. And he's quite cultural. I thought one of the benefits of going out with a working-class man was that I wouldn't have to go to the theatre or to the opera or ballet, but no, he loves all that. I find it quite refreshing to be&#xa0;with someone who's not interested in keeping up with other people, who's happy to drive around in a bashed-up old van. Having been out with upper-class men, it would be a complete nightmare to be married to one of them. All the moaning, the sexual hang-ups, the way they need&#xa0;to be with men all the time, and are terrified of women\u2026\"</p> <p>As we talk, Steve arrives home, bearing the wherewithal to build something that will stop the dogs going downstairs in the middle of the night. \"He's getting the power drill out as we speak,\" Julia says, ironically delighted, but still actually quite delighted.</p> <p>\u2022 Some names have been changed.</p> <h2><strong>When two families collide: one man's story</strong></h2> <p>You don't grasp the full extent to&#xa0;which your family communicates in middle-class code until you bring home a&#xa0;partner who does not. My new girlfriend, being not remotely middle class, didn't just lack fluency in this mysterious canon; she didn't even know it existed. The only upside was she had no idea just how badly things went when she first met my parents.</p> <p>I had a pretty good idea of how it would go, which is why I put it off for two years. I had left my wife to be with her, and my family was furious. How could you do this to your poor wife, they'd yell. What they really meant was, how could I do this to them? How could I swap an adorably gentle-mannered professional for a loud, semi-literate divorcee whose bookshelf held precisely four volumes, all true crime stories?</p> <p>The first few minutes didn't go too badly. She had recently enrolled on a college course and, as my family makes the traditional middle-class fetish of education, this seemed like safe conversational territory. And it was, until Mum asked, \"How will you cope with all the pressures of a full-time job and a&#xa0;college course on top of it?\"</p> <p>What this means is: \"Please note that I'm a very caring and sympathetic person.\" What my girlfriend heard was, \"Are you up to it?\" In her world, the only way to see off such doubt is to deliver a defensively bombastic broadside about how easy she finds everything. For her, that's how to demonstrate strength and resolve. In my family's world, you demonstrate that by volunteering ambivalence. \"Yes,\" you're meant to say, \"it's&#xa0;a lot to take on, and there are days when I do wonder how I'm going to manage it all.\" What that really says, of course, is, \"Please note that I'm a very thoughtful and considered person, whose modesty belies resilient self-belief.\" Boasting achieves the exact opposite of the desired effect. My parents exchanged troubled glances.</p> <p>Each time we met, they'd ask lots of questions, eliciting more boasts. In my girlfriend's circles, questions are not the currency of good manners, but the height of rudeness: intrusive, unwelcome, vaguely intimidating. None of her friends or family ever asked me anything about myself \u2013 apart from one night, when her brother, a bit drunk, asked about my job as an A&amp;E doctor. Then he clamped his hand over his mouth. \"Sorry \u2013 you must have thought I was going on like a copper!\" No, no, I reassured him, the thought had truthfully never crossed my mind.</p> <p>Announcing that my girlfriend was pregnant was probably the all-time low point. \"Well! What <em>interesting</em> children you'll have,\" was the best my sister could manage. We took my parents for a walk to break the news, but my girlfriend was nervous and blurted it out so clumsily that they thought she was joking. When the penny dropped, those fatal first four seconds of horrified shock, before a&#xa0;scramble to say the right thing, were so damning that we all pretended they'd never happened. Later on, my mum drew me to one side. \"Do&#xa0;you want to have a baby or a <em>family</em>?\" The implication was clear: we might be capable of breeding, but we were never going to create a family culture.</p> <p>To some degree she was right. My girlfriend likes to dress our daughter in Disney-branded outfits, comfort her with a&#xa0;dummy and feed her sweets as snacks, all of which I surreptitiously remove from our luggage before a visit to my&#xa0;family.</p> <p>Much of my family's disapproval is so coded that it goes over her head, but I clock every shudder and wince. Most of all, I clock the discrepancy between my family's self-image as radical, liberal, a bit bohemian, and its alarm at having to put into practice the inclusive values it so loves to extol over a glass of good wine. <strong>Anonymous</strong></p>",

Sexual violence is commonly used as a weapon of war, with up to 500,000 women raped during the Rwandan genocide and Darfur described as a <a href=\"http://www.refugeecouncil.org.uk/policy/position/2009/vulnerable_women/vulnerable_women_lit_review\" title=\"\">\"rape camp\"</a> under the Sudanese government. This kind of horrific violence against women has to stop and the One Billion Rising campaign will be a powerful way to push for that change.</p> <p>On 25 November, on the International Day for the Elimination of Violence Against Women, the UK government will <a href=\"http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/crime/violence-against-women-girls/\" title=\"\">report</a> on the progress of its Violence Against Women and Girls strategy, which contains 100 actions to stop women at home and abroad from facing abuse, which we at the Refugee Council wholeheartedly welcome.</p> <p>But for us, there is a glaring omission: out of the 100 actions, there is only one point about protecting women who are seeking asylum in the UK, despite them being some of the most vulnerable women and at most risk of violence in our society.</p> <p>It is shocking that women who have fled violence abroad and come to the UK in search of protection often face further abuse and exploitation here, in the country where they thought they would be safe. A fifth of the women who accessed the <a href=\"http://www.refugeecouncil.org.uk/policy/briefings/2012/08032012experiences_of_refugee_women\" title=\"\">Refugee Council's therapeutic services</a> in 2011 had experienced sexual violence since coming here. The recent Women for Refugee Women report, <a href=\"http://www.refugeewomen.com/\" title=\"\">Refused</a>, also highlights distressing accounts of the violence asylum seeking women face in the UK.</p> <p>It is a result of UK Border Agency failures and government policies that asylum-seeking women are particularly vulnerable to violence and exploitation here. As the majority of refused asylum seekers are not eligible for financial support or allowed to work to support themselves, many women are forced into destitution. They enter into exploitative or abusive relationships, or prostitution, just to get a roof over their heads. This leaves them open to violence and abuse that they often can't escape from.</p> <p>Most women seeking asylum in the UK are turned down (<a href=\"http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/publications/science-research-statistics/research-statistics/immigration-asylum-research/?d-7095067-p=1#\" title=\"\">64% of applicants last year</a>), often as a result of a system that is complex and unwelcoming to women. Many Border Agency officials have no understanding of gender-based persecution. Women are not always supported appropriately to be able to disclose the violence they have faced to support their case, and decisions on their cases are therefore often wrongly made. According to official Home Office statistics, around 30% of refusals that are appealed by women are overturned by the courts, showing that a high number of initial decisions were wrong.</p> <p>When a woman's rights are violated overseas, the UK government promises to help, but when the same woman seeks asylum here, these promises count for nothing. That cannot be right. The <a href=\"http://www.asylumaid.org.uk/charter\" title=\"\">Women's Asylum Charter</a> has launched the <a href=\"http://e-activist.com/ea-action/action?ea.client.id=121&amp;ea.campaign.id=16171\" title=\"\">No Woman Should be Missed Out</a> campaign to put pressure on the government to support asylum-seeking women.</p> <p>It is exciting to see so much energy going into preparations for V-Day in February 2013, and we are preparing our own video in support of the campaign. But before then, there is much that can be done to ensure that all women are being protected from violence while in our country, and that asylum seeking women are no longer missed out.</p> <p><em>\u2022 Anna Musgrave is the women's advocacy and influencing officer at the Refugee Council.</em></p> <p>\u2022 Want to get involved? <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2012/sep/24/one-billion-rising-your-videos\" title=\"\">Submit your video here </a></p>",
  "<p>I remember uttering a slur aimed at gay people (the other F-word) in front of my mother when I was about 11 years old. She rebuked me faster than I could ever recall: \"Never call anyone that!\" However, she did not mean it in solidarity with gays and lesbians; rather she felt it was the worst word one could be called. As a Latina, I knew our culture was full of machismo, and being gay was the antithesis of that. Despite being a huge <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ellen_DeGeneres\" title=\"\">Ellen DeGeneres</a> fan, my dad stopped watching her show when she came out (but that did not last long. Her comedic magic won him over far better than his eldest daughter pleading, \"She's not a different person!\").</p> <p>Yesterday, a <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/19/us/gay-marriage-support-grows-among-latinos-survey-finds.html?_r=0\" title=\"\">Pew survey</a> showed that a slight majority of Latinos in the US (52%) now favour same-sex marriage. Just six years ago, 56% of Latinos favoured outlawing same-sex marriage. So what accounts for this flip?</p> <p>I believe it is a combination of reasons. The first is the comedic gold of Ellen DeGeneres, and the positive representations of LGBT persons in pop culture. From Ricky Martin to characters such as <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santana_Lopez\" title=\"\">Santana Lopez on Glee,</a> gay and lesbian Latinos are no longer invisible. Given that some Latinos might only know out members of their community from seeing them on TV (unless they followed <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chavela_Vargas\" title=\"\">Chavela Vargas</a>, a popular <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ranchera\" title=\"\">ranchera</a> singer who died earlier this year), this really matters. Tellingly, a <a href=\"http://www.gallup.com/poll/118931/knowing-someone-gay-lesbian-affects-views-gay-issues.aspx\" title=\"\">2009 Gallup poll</a> showed that opposition to gay rights is highest among people who believe they do not know anyone who is gay.</p> <p>I also believe that the decade-long fight for the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DREAM_Act\" title=\"\">Dream Act</a>, which would provide conditional permanent residency to selected undocumented residents, has had an impact on how Latinos view LGBT rights. The act, which is sponsored by my senator, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dick_Durbin\" title=\"\">Dick Durbin</a>, creates a pathway to citizenship for undocumented youth who were brought to the US by their parents as children. In June, President Obama went some way towards this goal, by issuing an order, dubbed \"Dream relief\" that would allow young undocumented immigrants to put off the threat of deportation for two years, for work or study. Many \"Dreamers\", as they call themselves, had no idea they were undocumented until they asked to obtain a driver's licence or applied for college.</p> <p>The Dream Act movement engaged in storytelling to connect with allies outside its network. Dreamers \"came out\" as undocumented to friends, teachers and community members. They spoke about how they are as American as someone born in Chicago, just without legal documents. They also talked about their sexuality: there are a good number of Dreamers who are out as gay, lesbian or transgender. This dual storytelling made a difference: the fight for marriage rights is not about the ceremony, but about the benefits that are tied to the institution of marriage in the US. And those benefits are important in the comprehensive immigration reform conversation, in the same way that it matters in the same-sex marriage conversation. Youth who are both LGBT and fighting for the ability to become citizens are taking these issues to a new level.</p> <p>What about our religion? I hear you say. Latinos are predominately Catholic, this is true, but Latinos are also negotiating how much of their Catholicism influences their lives. In Mexico City, same-sex marriage is legal. According to a <a href=\"http://latinainstitute.org/Latinopoll\" title=\"\">2011 poll</a> commissioned by the National Latina Institute for Reproductive Health, 74% of registered Latino voters agree women should have a right to decide, without politicians' interference, whether to carry a pregnancy to term or not, and 68% are comfortable breaking with the Catholic church on this issue. Latinos are increasingly comfortable with negotiating their faith with their political views, whether it is about gay rights or abortion rights.</p> <p>We are a diverse group of people. We do not share the exact same culture, but we do have a lot in common. In the US, we are scapegoats for everything \u2013 from the violence of the failed war on drugs to stealing jobs. We know discrimination and the injustice we live with is similar to the injustice our LGBT sisters and brothers live with. In fields across the country, Latinos picking strawberries have few employment-related rights. In our offices, the majority of LGBT employees <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT_rights_in_the_United_States#Employment\" title=\"\">have no protection against discrimination</a>. Moises Villada, co-ordinator at the Gender and Sexuality Centre at the University of Illinois in Chicago, remarked how inspiring it was to hear the labour leader <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dolores_Huerta\" title=\"\">Dolores Huerta</a> speak at the <a href=\"http://www.creatingchange.org/\" title=\"\">2009 National Conference on LGBT Equality</a>. It was a testament as to our shared struggles. Indeed, this progression towards justice was only a matter of time.</p>",
  "<p>The government hopes that its <a href=\"http://www.openpublicservices.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/\" title=\"\">Open Public Services</a> will make public services more creative and innovative. As the voluntary sector has decades of experience in identifying, addressing and preventing inequalities, charities are well placed to improve both the design and delivery of many public services. However, experience shows that there are significant barriers that hamper this reality. The National Council for Voluntary Organisations (NCVO) has partnered with 14 organisations to demonstrate positive examples of charities bringing transformation and innovation to public services.</p> <p>Below are four case studies, taken from the report Open Public Services: Experiences from the Voluntary Sector that demonstrate how charities are already delivering innovative public services and highlight the key lessons learnt.</p> <h2>Barriers to commissioning specialist services: Baca Project, Leicestershire</h2> <p><a href=\"http://www.bacaproject.org.uk/\" title=\"\">The Baca Project </a>in Leicestershire delivers services targeting the needs of 15- to 19-year-olds trafficked into the UK or seeking asylum. The charity provides supported accommodation placements for local authorities, who have a statutory duty of care for these young people under the Looked After Children Act. Their services are specifically tailored to young people who are not from the UK, and Baca has been successful in helping them develop socially, mentally, emotionally and academically.</p> <p>Baca worked closely with the local authority to design and deliver durable and workable solutions. However, as the charity's services are so specialist, they are often commissioned to provide unique placements with local authorities outside of a formalised contract. Current commissioning and procurement practices often seek a blanket approach to the care of young people, which makes it difficult for Baca to compete with larger service providers.</p> <p>One key problem that the Baca Project identified is how limiting written contract tender documents can be when communicating their service users' experience. They believe that if the commissioning process also included site visits, commissioners would be better placed to understand how an organisation delivered its services and see first-hand the impact those services have on users. Every local authority that visits the Baca Project loves the ethos and atmosphere, and the way that young people interact with the staff. This is extremely hard to capture in the boxes of a tender document. If site visits became the norm, Baca is confident it would be able to communicate better the positive impact of its services on the lives of young people entering the UK under extremely difficult circumstances.</p> <h2>Key lessons:</h2> <p>Commissioning should include site visits to help commissioners understand the characteristics of an organisation, and future commissioning of contracts must not discount organisations that provide individualised care for marginalised groups. Contracts must allow for specialism and expertise to shine through.</p> <h2>Working in consortiums: The CICS Project in Conwy, North Wales</h2> <p>Older people who have been discharged from hospital often need support to help them fully recover and regain independence. In Conwy, where 28% of the population are above the retirement age, this was identified as a key public service need. However, as individual needs are wide ranging, a creative and flexible approach was required to help patients who needed further help and support. To address this, the<a href=\"http://www.redcross.org.uk/\" title=\"\"> British Red Cross</a> co-ordinated a consortium of large and small voluntary sector partners to provide home-care support to these patients.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.wales.nhs.uk/sitesplus/861/page/48994\" title=\"\">The Conway Intermediate Care Service (CICS)</a> project helped people to find out about and take up services on offer from the voluntary sector, via a service co-ordinator at the British Red Cross. The co-ordinator visited clients in their homes, conducted an assessment and created a service pathway of support based on services locally available via the voluntary sector. The co-ordinator assigned a suitable volunteer to work with the client and provided signposting for other services. The programme was aimed at reducing hospital re-admissions and repeat referrals to the CICS team.</p> <p>The results were very positive. This was a true partnership between the statutory health services, social care services and the voluntary sector based on openness and transparency. Evaluation by the <a href=\"http://tsrc.ac.uk/\" title=\"\">Third Sector Research Centre</a>, found that service users \"were far more independent and had seen improvements on a range of dimensions\".</p> <p>Furthermore, self-reported improvements from service users were significantly large across a range of indicators, averaging 29% improvement on nine measures of wellbeing. This programme has demonstrated successful collaboration on an equal footing between very different sized and resourced organisations.</p> <h2>Key lessons:</h2> <p>Consortiums are one way that charities can efficiently improve the quality of public services. Good practice models of collaboration will clearly acknowledge relative difference in risk, resource and reach of the participating charities.</p> <h2>Working in partnership: <a href=\"http://www.westmerciaprobation.org.uk/\" title=\"\">West Mercia Probation Trust</a> and <a href=\"http://yss.org.uk/\" title=\"\">YSS</a></h2> <p>Voluntary organisations are often well placed to provide services that help to reduce re-offending, an opinion that has been echoed by the <a href=\"http://www.justice.gov.uk/about/noms\" title=\"\">National Offender Management Service </a> (NOMS). Yet <a href=\"http://www.clinks.org/\" title=\"\">Clinks</a>, a national charity supporting the involvement of voluntary organisations in the criminal justice system, says that current commissioning and procurement practice often deters or even excludes voluntary sector providers.</p> <p>Research by Clinks found that good commissioning is often dependent on certain individuals within NOMS, who understand the unique services that the voluntary sector has to offer.</p> <p>For example, David Chantler, chief executive of West Mercia Probation Trust, had the vision of downsizing his trust, but seeing overall service provision to offenders growing. He worked to transform the trust so that it only ran core offender-management services, believing that it should work with other services providers to explore types of services that reduce reoffending.</p> <p>To achieve this, West Mercia Probation Trust invited bids for the role of a strategic partner and the specification required good knowledge of local service need and a sound track record. The trust received bids from the private sector and large national voluntary organisations but decided to appoint a local youth charity, YSS, as its strategic partner.</p> <p>This partnership has enabled the probation trust and YSS to explore and discuss new services, without obligation to award YSS the work, or for YSS to deliver the services identified. Ultimately this partnership has allowed YSS and others in the voluntary sector to initiate some really exciting and innovative services.</p> <h2>Key lessons:</h2> <p>Public bodies, including probation trusts and local authorities, should seek to involve voluntary sector partners at the design stage of services, so that the needs of local service users are voiced.</p> <h2>Co-produced commissioning in Health and Social Care: Connected Care model</h2> <p><a href=\"http://www.turning-point.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Turning Point</a>, a national social enterprise, has developed a <a href=\"http://www.turning-point.co.uk/community-commissioning/connected-care.aspx\" title=\"\">Connected Care</a> model of community-led commissioning. The innovative project involved local communities in the design and delivery of health and social care services to make them more integrated, inclusive and cost effective. The project demonstrates to commissioners the usability of current services and facilitates discussions on what is required to meet local need. Crucially, the project identifies weaknesses in service provision that may not otherwise be addressed by more conventional commissioning practice.</p> <p>Connected Care has been run in 14 areas of England, including Basildon, Warrington and London. It transfers skills to local people so that they are able to have a say in local services. The projects train local people to become community researchers so that they conduct their own research into the types of health and social care services needed in their local area. The local knowledge of these community researchers is invaluable in ensuring the services reach the heart of communities.</p> <p>The Connected Care model gives a voice to seldom-heard groups, such as the Gypsy, Roma and Traveller communities. Yet it can provide savings for the public purse. According to Turning Point's Connected Care Cost Benefit Analysis report, for every \u00a31 invested in the project in Basildon, a return of \u00a34.44 is achieved.</p> <p>The community researcher training has long-term benefits to participants, with more than half going on to further employment, training or volunteering. And a number have even gone on to establish their own social enterprises, prompting social action within their local communities.</p> <h2>Key lessons:</h2> <p>Involving communities in the design and delivery of services gives a voice to service users that are seldom heard in conventional commissioning processes. By building the capacity, skills and confidence of local people, they are supported to be more active participants in society.</p> <p>These case studies have been taken from a new collaborative report, co-ordinated by the <a href=\"http://www.ncvo-vol.org.uk/\" title=\"\">NCVO</a>, to share the experiences of charities delivering public services. The report has been created in partnership by 14 organisations, specialising in areas including health and social care, criminal justice and social investment.</p> <p><em>Charlotte Stuffins is part of the policy and research team at </em><a href=\"http://www.ncvo-vol.org.uk/\" title=\"\"><em>NCVO</em></a><em>.

  "<p>Turkey has called on the US, Britain and other leading countries to take immediate action to intervene in Syria to prevent a looming humanitarian \"disaster\" that it says threatens the lives of millions of internally displaced people and refugees as winter approaches and could soon ignite a region-wide conflagration.</p> <p>Appealing to the major powers to set aside their differences over how to end the 20-month-old civil war in which an estimated 32,000 people have died, Ahmet Davutoglu, Turkey's foreign minister, said the crisis had gone on for long enough. The Syrian people were crying out for help and their pleas could no longer be ignored.</p> <p>\"How long can this situation continue? I mean in Bosnia, now we have Ban Ki-moon [the UN secretary general] apologising 20 years after. Who will apologise for Syria in 20 years' time? How can we stay idle?\" Davutoglu told the Guardian in an exclusive interview in Istanbul.</p> <p>\"We [Turkey] are doing all we can to help these people, using all diplomatic capacity to stop this bloodshed. But there should be a much more concerted effort by the international community. The best way we can see now is direct humanitarian intervention.\"</p> <p>The call came as the UN's peace envoy, Lakhdar Brahimi, travelled to Damascus for crucial talks with the regime due to be held on Saturday \u2013 the latest bid, after several failed international initiatives, to bring a halt to the killing. Brahimi is expected to propose a temporary truce, beginning on 26 October, the start of the Eid al-Adha holiday, in the hope that it may lead to a permanent ceasefire.</p> <p>Predominantly Muslim Turkey, a leading Middle East power that is also a Nato member and long-time US ally, has been caught in the storm as the Syrian crisis has unfolded south of its shared 560-mile (900km) border. Opinion polls show most Turks are fearful of their country being sucked into the Syrian quagmire.</p> <p>More than 145,000 refugees have taken shelter in improvised camps or Turkish cities, fighters of the Free Syrian Army and their Gulf backers use Turkey as a base and covert weapons supply route, and fighting has spilled on to Turkish soil.</p> <p>Earlier this month, Syrian shelling killed five Turkish civilians in the town of Ak\u00e7akale, triggering a week of cross-border artillery and mortar exchanges and fears of all-out war. Turkey also recently forced down an aircraft flying from Russia to Syria that it said was carrying military equipment.</p> <p>Turkey's earlier proposal to the UN to set up a border buffer zone, backed by a possible no-fly zone, was ignored by the US, Britain and other Nato members wary of involvement in another Middle East war. Russia and China oppose direct intervention.</p> <p>Now, clearly frustrated by the impasse and deeply concerned at the prospect of a spreading conflict, Turkey's leaders appear to be adopting a tougher line while appealing to the world's conscience.</p> <p>The Syrian regime's continuing use of air bombardment and heavy weapons against Syria's civilian population was propelling the country and the region towards a human catastrophe, Davutoglu said. A much more robust response was required from London, Washington and Paris.</p> <p>\"If nothing is done, maybe in the next two months it [the number of refugees] will double to 200,000, even 400,000 \u2026 When the technology the regime was using was snipers, the refugees were coming in a few thousands. Now they are using artillery shells and tanks, the number increased rapidly,\" Davutoglu said.</p> <p>\"We want the international community to find a solution to resolve this issue inside Syria. All means can be discussed. But there must be proper humanitarian access. We have 145,000 refugees in Turkey but there are millions of people, two million people inside Syria who are IDPs [internally displaced people]. Those that are lucky can come to Turkey. They are the lucky ones.</p> <p>\"So there has to be humanitarian access, a humanitarian mission inside Syria, and the international community must be ready to protect it. This is the question, whether it is a buffer zone or humanitarian access \u2013 how these people are to be protected inside Syria. We are calling for an international humanitarian mission to go into Syria and be protected to stop the refugee flow.</p> <p>\"The international community must make a decision. Humanitarian access must be guaranteed by any means that is acceptable. These people are human beings. The winter is approaching. How will they survive the winter?\"</p> <p>Davutoglu stressed any new initiative must be backed by the UN security council. If it established a mechanism to guarantee international humanitarian assistance inside Syria, Turkey would support it and would allow its soil to be used as a base. But Turkey would not act alone or without UN authorisation, he said.</p> <p>Alluding to the Obama administration, which has been criticised by Republicans for a weak response, as well as to Britain and other countries, Davutoglu said: \"We expect the leading powers of the international community to be more firm, more decisive and clear in their policy regarding oppression in Syria.\"</p> <p>Davutoglu said Turkey was not seeking military confrontation with the regime of President Bashar al-Assad. But the international community must send a \"stark warning\", via the UN security council, that some of Damascus's actions constituted a \"war crime\", he said. Turkey wanted the immediate creation of a transitional government, leading to democratic elections. If Assad wanted to avoid facing war crimes charges in The Hague, he should stop killing his own people.</p> <p>While Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Turkey's prime minister, has called for Assad to step down, Davutoglu said it was ultimately a matter for the Syrian people.</p> <p>\"It is not our business, it is for them to decide. But after such a criminal act, such oppression and aggression, more than 30,000 people have been killed, we don't know how many are lost, millions are IDPs, and maybe more than 500,000 are refugees, how can such a person [Assad] who is responsible for these statistics continue to run a country?\"</p> <p>With Brahimi due in Damascus, Davutoglu said Turkey would support a meaningful peace process in Syria but its end objective must be a transfer of power.</p> <p>The biggest problem for any talks process was that Assad could not be trusted to keep his word, Davutoglu said. Turkey has suggested that Faruk al-Shara, Syria's vice-president, might lead any transition negotiations. This idea was predictably rejected by Damascus, and by its main regional ally, Iran.</p> <p>\"We don't see a serious counterpart in Damascus for such talks who is powerful or strong enough to fulfil commitments \u2026 Last year myself personally and other senior state officials went to Damascus to convince the regime to halt the violence against civilians. But unfortunately they did not fulfil their promises.</p> <p>\"What is the purpose of any dialogue if it legitimises the Syrian regime? If they are sincere, there are channels to have a dialogue, UN special envoy Brahimi and many other channels. If they come to us with a proposal to end the bloodshed and allow the people to decide their own future, then there will always be a channel.\"</p> <p>Davutoglu said he was hopeful that Russia, wary of another Libyan-style, regime-changing Nato operation, might be persuaded to soften its anti-interventionist stance, once the scale of the impending humanitarian crisis became clear.</p> <p>\"I have contact with [Sergei] Lavrov [Russia's foreign minister]. They have their own approach especially after the Libyan experience, but even if there was a mistake or something wrong in Libya and I don't think that there was, why should Syrian people pay the price?\"</p> <p>Asked about US concerns that hardline jihadi groups were hijacking Syria's uprising, Davutoglu said that possibility made a swift solution all the more urgent.</p> <p>\"The presence of some groups on the ground should not be used as an excuse for not being active. Prolonging the crisis will create a much more critical environment concerning these groups. We must have a solution and act as soon as possible to avoid a power vacuum in Syria.</p> <p>\"We must immediately establish a transitional government and let the Syrian people see a light at the end of the tunnel. At present they do not see light at the end of the tunnel. In the surrounding darkness, anyone can do anything.\"</p>",
  "<p>Anyone familiar with the football fan culture of Serbia cannot feign surprise at the latest <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/oct/17/uefa-serbia-international-ban-racism-england\" title=\"\">disturbances that took place at the Under-21 Serbia v England international game</a> in Krusevac, during which Serbian fans allegedly chanted racist abuse at the English team. This was unfortunately not an isolated incident, and is unlikely to have been a spontaneous outburst.</p> <p>Since the 1980s, former Yugoslav (Serbian and Croatian in particular) football fan clubs have been the chief instigators of violence at domestic and international football games. Those fan clubs tend to be closed to outsiders, and are less concerned with football than with orchestrating brawls. Distinct from general football audiences, they have been the main reason for increases in violence. Some Belgrade-based clubs are alleged to have originally been fronts for neo-Nazi groups, and others are said to have supplied paramilitary combatants for the conflicts in Croatia and Bosnia in the 1990s.</p> <p>The Krusevac incident must be understood within this particular historical context. While most football supporters in Serbia are not organised around these clubs, Serbian fans have nevertheless been embroiled in a long list of recent violent incidents. In 2005, Serbian football fans held up banners referring to the Srebrenica genocide in a World Cup qualifier against Bosnia-Herzegovina. Following a 2011 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2010/oct/29/uefa-italy-serbia-abandoned-euro-2012\" title=\"\">violent incident in Genoa at the Euro 2012 qualifier</a>, the Serbian football federation was fined \u20ac120,000. This was a crisis point, and following suggestions from UEFA chief Michel Platini, Serbia's ministry of interior formed a special unit to tackle football hooliganism and <a href=\"http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/article/serbia-gets-football-police\" title=\"\">prevent its ban from international competitions</a>.</p> <p>This time, the racist behaviour in Krusevac drew attention to the wider and more systematic failures of the Serbian political leadership. The immediate response of Ivica Da\u010di\u0107, the prime minister, and the Serbian Football Association (FSS) has been <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/oct/18/danny-rose-england-serbia-racist-chanting\" title=\"\">to deny the racist nature of the incident</a>. Da\u010di\u0107 has since ordered a police investigation into the incident, and the FSS ordered a disciplinary one. Regardless of what emerges from those investigations, the FSS's refusal to engage with the issue of racism does not sit comfortably with the history of violent fan club culture in Serbian football. Although monitoring violent fans falls under the remit of the ministry of internal affairs (which Da\u010di\u0107 oversees), the FSS also has a moral obligation to explicitly condemn racism and other unacceptable behaviour.</p> <p>As the professional regulator, the FSS has not really taken a deeper look into this question, nor does it appear to have set up frameworks to deal with intolerance and racism; a serious oversight given that most Serbian football teams now include foreign-born players. The FSS response to Krusevac is a part of that systematic failure, and it sits in sharp contrast to the English attempts to deal with racism within its own football leagues.</p> <p>However, the problem doesn't only lie with the FSS. The incident, and particularly Da\u010di\u0107's denial of its racist nature, raises much larger questions about discrimination and intolerance in Serbia. Whilst the public reaction has been swift in condemning the fans, Da\u010di\u0107 has not been as forthcoming. This is not entirely surprising. Since Serbia's democratic revolution on 5 October 2000, all successive governments have had a record of poor engagement with domestic issues related to minorities and rights. The 2012 Gay Pride parade was cancelled on his watch, apparently due to security concerns. In November 2011, when Da\u010di\u0107 was the first deputy prime minister, the small town of Banja Koviljaca, which hosts Serbia's only centre for asylum seekers, experienced raised tensions between the residents and a group of Afghan refugees. The Serbian government has not encouraged debate on any of these issues, nor addressed the groups that promote intolerance or do not support minority rights. In that context, Da\u010di\u0107's reaction to the most recent football incident is not surprising.</p> <p>Serbia has now formed a National Council for the Prevention of Violence and Unsuitable Behaviour at Sports Events, which will be chaired by Da\u010di\u0107 and the first deputy prime minister. Let's hope this is not just token gesture. It may bring into mainstream discussion some of the serious problems within football fan culture and its connections to extremism. Racism, intolerance and violence in football cannot be dealt with if there is no broader political or societal engagement.</p>",
  "<p>So we're back from the international break, and all of a sudden there's less than two weeks to go in the regular season. Where did the time go? <strong> San Jose Earthquakes</strong> could assure themselves of a historic night on Sunday, by clinching the Supporters Shield against an <strong>LA Galaxy</strong> side who would of course be delighted to hand their Californian brethren the points that would see them head into a likely wild card game with Vancouver Whitecaps...</p> <p>Of course <strong>Vancouver</strong> have to secure their (and Canada's) first play off spot themselves, with a result against <strong>Portland Timbers</strong>, themselves bidding for the Cascadia Cup, or a favorable result when <strong>Seattle Sounders</strong> kick off against<strong> FC Dallas</strong>. Dallas are probably still kicking themselves after letting a lead slip against Chivas USA last time out. <strong>Chivas</strong> will play the not quite as underachieving <strong>Colorado Rapids</strong> later on that evening as both sides hurry to the end of poor seasons. </p> <p>Two teams hoping their seasons don't end prematurely next weekend, face off in Washington, DC on Saturday night - when the hometown <strong>DC United</strong> look to book their playoff spot against <strong>Columbus Crew</strong>. Meanwhile up in New York, there'll be plenty of hometown anxiety as the <strong>New York Red Bulls</strong> face a <strong>Sporting Kansas City</strong> side who've looked to have their measure in their previous two encounters. New York could do with a result, not least since their last game of the season sends them to a <strong>Philadelphia</strong> side looking rejuvenated by the end of their own playoff tensions, and who could yet cause problems for <strong>Houston Dynamo</strong>, as they try to get across the playoff line.</p> <p>The other two clashes this weekend sees the already playoff bound<strong> Chicago Fire</strong> face a <strong>New England Revolution</strong> team who are not playoff bound, but may be \"somewhere\" bound as stadium rumors gather pace. Finally <strong>Toronto FC</strong> are hosting <strong>Montreal Impact</strong>, with a seeding spot in next year's Amway Canadian Championship still at stake for Montreal, and nothing but the scant consolation of knowing the national team have drawn attention from their own failings at stake for Toronto FC.</p> <p>Ever ready to point out failings (and successes) - our regular cast of fan reps, bloggers, podcasters and beat writers, who know their teams better than anyone. Read their previews of this weekend's games, then add your own thoughts in our comments section. And join us for <strong>our live game this weekend, which is that Cascadia Cup clash between Vancouver Whitecaps and Portland Timbers</strong>. Then we'll be back on Monday morning with <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/blog/2012/oct/08/week-31-real-salt-lake-chicago-fire\">Five Things We learned</a>.</p> <h2>Toronto FC vs Montreal Impact, Sat 1.30pm (TSN,RDS)</h2> <p><strong>Duncan Fletcher</strong>, <a href=\"http://www.wakingthered.com/\">Waking the Red</a>, Toronto:</p> <p>Last time TFC played, it was inevitably another defeat. With some supporters protesting but most of them just numbed and apathetic, TFC actually played much better than they have recently, but were done in by two familiar failings. Lack of finish meant the game stayed 0-0 until it got to be time for us to let in the customary late goal \u2014 this time Milos Kocic fumbled an easy save to allow a tap in rebound in the 88th minute \u2014 and 1-0 to DC United it was. That's now 20 defeats on the season. We did at least get to see Canada beat Cuba 3-0, but then they went and lost 8-1 to Honduras to knock themselves out of the World Cup. </p> <p>This week it's Montreal. In the penultimate game of the season that should be a huge game, but alas there isn't even the added spice of being able to knock the Impact out of the playoffs. Win this one though, and we'll have won the season series over both Canadian teams, and that's the kind of tiny achievement TFC fans have been reduced to hoping for. One more week, just one more week and it's done. </p> <p><strong>Sofiane Benzaza</strong>, <a href=\"http://www.mountroyalsoccer.com\">Mount Royal Soccer</a>, Montreal:</p> <p>In Week 32 of MLS action, the Montreal Impact rekindled hostilities with the Houston Dynamo at BBVA Compass Stadium. Both teams could not be more geographically apart and different, from location to weather. But both teams seemed to really love to hate each other and go at it on and off the field. The 1-1 draw eliminated the Montreal Impact from the playoff run but also put a serious dent in the Dynamo's hopes to be more secure in 5th in the East. That draw puts a definitive end to the Impact's playoff aspirations but a lot of work is left.</p> <p>That workload includes preparing the end of the season and looking to the next one and it starts with Toronto FC at BMO Field. Jesse Marsch will be serving a one-game suspension after being expelled from the bench against the Dynamo, the previous week. With the 2013 Amway Canadian Championship seed in play, Montreal will be going for the win to finish ahead of the Vancouver Whitecaps. The highest Canadian seed in MLS will get to play the ''easier'' FC Edmonton in the semi-finals of the Championship. This gives a better chance to make it to the finals and eventually qualify to the CONCACAF Champions League. With injuries for major players, will the Impact give more minutes to the younger players of the team? Can they afford it? I think they could but the winning mentality/culture has always driven this club and been a big part of its success.</p> <h2>New York Red Bulls vs Sporting KC, Sat 7pm</h2> <p><strong>Tim Hall</strong>, author of \"The view from 101\" for <a href=\"http://www.firsttouchonline.com\">First Touch</a>, New York:</p> <p>The standard schizophrenia surrounding the Red Bulls this year has done nothing but increase as of late. Sporting Director Eric Soler was demoted with four games left, and reports from Sweden say that head coach Hans Backe is out come December win, lose or otherwise. A similar fate has struck the on-field product as of late, as New York followed a complete drubbing of Toronto with a disinterested performance against Chicago. All of which makes the job of your humble game previewer that much more difficult: which New York team will turn up at Red Bull Arena this Saturday?</p> <p>The opposition provided this week is Sporting Kansas City, and if their two previous meetings this season are any indication, this should be a physical, if not downright violent, affair. The player to watch for is Thierry Henry, which isn't exactly breaking news, of course. But consider this: with the international break, Henry has had two full weeks of rest. The last time that happened, the Frenchman came out and posted a one goal, three assist performance against Toronto. Also remember that the only reason Henry got that break to begin with was a one-game suspension for headbutting SKC's Kei Kamara, which will be a dynamic to watch for in this rematch. With a win ensuring a playoff birth, Captain Titi and company will have to come out guns blazing to avoid a do-or-die game next week in Philadelphia. </p> <p><strong>Malena Barajas</strong>, co-founder, <a href=\"http://womenunitedfc.com/\">Women United FC</a>, Sporting Kansas City:</p> <p>Sporting KC needs only a draw against New York Red Bulls to extend its current no-loss streak in what will be an intense match this coming Saturday. This is the third and final regular season match between the two, with the record at 1-1. NYRB has seen turmoil and tragedy in the past two weeks and have been performing poorly at home. NYRB will come in to the match motivated not to drop any more precious points. No doubt the Crew will be fighting for a playoff berth in its final two matches. Saturday night is fan appreciation night at Red Bull Arena, so a sell-out is expected, but it is RBA, so a sell-out doesn't necessarily mean a crowd.</p> <p>Sporting KC will bring its momentum; with two regular season games remaining, Jimmy Nielsen is two shut-outs away from matching a League record for most shut-outs in a season (currently held by former Wizard Tony Meola, set in 2000). Graham Zusi will continue in excellent form after a fantastic showing in the US national team qualifiers. Though he hasn't been starting, expect defender Aurelien Collin back in the starting line-up. Midfielder and stronghold Roger Espinoza suffered an ankle injury in the last match - a draw against the Crew - so there absolutely will be a change in the midfield. Though none could replace Espinoza's presence, Coach Peter Vermes has several options, among those options: push Lawrence Olum up to the midfield and keep Zusi on the wing; bring back a recently healthy Bobby Convey; trust workhorse Jacob Peterson; or bring on Oriol Rosell for a chance at another game-winning goal. Sporting KC dominated in the last match against NYRB, and it could very well dominate the play this Saturday.</p> <h2>D.C. United vs Columbus Crew, Sat 7.30pm</h2> <p><strong>Kim Kolb,</strong> author of <a href=\"http://screaming-eagles.com/category/nest-liner/\">NestLiner</a> blog for the Screaming Eagles</p> <p>Last time out, United made it's last 2012 trek north of the border into Canada to take on Toronto. United has relied on a 4-5-1, with Lionard Pajoy as the sole forward, since Dwayne DeRosario was lost for the season. The formation and tactics have solidified what's been a shaky defense, but offensive flow and pressure have been sacrificed. Toronto played a disciplined game and stifled the meager United attack. Ben Olsen used his offensive substitutes to inject more offense, bringing on Branko Boscovic, Maicon Santos, and Hamdi Salihi. In the 89th minute, Santos took a long range shot from distance and at a narrow angle, and former United goalkeeper Milos Kocic couldn't cleanly handle it, and the ever opportunistic Salihi was at his side instantly and capitalized on the opportunity.</p> <p>This week United has its eyes on the playoffs. Columbus comes to town, and United clinches a playoff berth with a win or tie. The international break has brought United's health up to as good of a level that can be expected, with only the long term injury players not seeing practice time. Though many expect Olsen to continue his 4-5-1 formation, expecting the unexpected is a safe bet when considering his personnel and tactical decisions, and while one can argue with the decisions, it's been very hard to argue with the results of those decisions. United is expecting a large crowd in expectation of the playoff return, and it would be fantastic to clinch in the final home regular season game.</p> <p><strong>Ian Fraser</strong>, <a href=\"http://crewunion.com\">Crew Union</a>, Columbus Crew:</p> <p>I don't want to spend too much space on the game against SKC since it seems like forever ago now. In a nutshell, the Crew defense allowed a goal in which the opposition was able to find some space between the defenders and then in recent Crew fashion Columbus managed to snag a late goal only this time it was for 1 point instead of 3. In between that was the odd chance but mostly a battle between the boxes. Still, it was crucial point as it keeps alive a couple of playoff scenarios heading into this weekend....<br> Words can't even describe how big this game is for Columbus and unfortunately they have a poor record in DC and DC have been stellar at home. I was one of the people who thought DC would slump when they lost DeRo for the season but they haven't. DC have won 4 of 5 and they are doing it with defense, only giving up 2 goals in that span. They are not lighting up the scoreboard and their winning goals in the last 2 games should be considered gifts, yet they have found a way to get the goal needed to win. Columbus, on the other hand, have been prone to giving up poor goals over the past 2 months but have found an offense that has been able to get late goals needed to get points. This seems to be a matchup of recent strengths this week, will the Crew find a way to crack the DC defense and will they be able to avoid a lapse in the back? There is some question over Julius James' availability for Saturday but he played against SKC when he was in doubt. If he goes out, returning Josh Williams to CB may provide the change needed to jump start the D. The only other questions for Warzycha will be whether to use Birchall or O'Rourke as the holding midfielder and if Dilly Duka gets a deserved return to the first XI after providing a spark vs SKC. Defensive lapses can be corrected and luck tends to even out, hopefully that is the case Saturday but this is going to come down to finding a way to win. Columbus have left it late for the past 2 months and they will get the win needed to keep the season going, 2-1 Columbus.</p> <h2>New England Revolution vs Chicago Fire, Sat 7.30pm</h2> <p><strong>Christopher Camille</strong>, <a href=\"http://www.midnightriders.com/\">Midnight Riders</a>, author of NE tactics blog <a href=\"http://soccertheory.wordpress.com/\">Soccer Theory</a>:</p> <p>Benny Feilhaber continued his season of petulance by getting sent off at PPL Park in the Revs last match again the Union. Thankfully, the player once billed as a club savior won't have to subject the Gillette Stadium crowd to his wasteful brand of disinterested soccer due to the suspension that goes along with his red card. </p> <p>Those who are still willing to make the trip to see the Revs, who have won once in 15 matches, will be subjected to what the Revs are dubbing \"Fan Appreciation Night.\" The club will be showing the fans just how much they appreciate them by hosting their last home match of the season on a field criss-crossed with American Football lines. A truly pathetic sight to be seen for any fan of the sport, but really just par for the course with New England's floundering soccer franchise. </p> <p><strong>Scott Fenwick</strong>, Editor, <a href=\"http://onthefire.com\">On the Fire</a>, Chicago:</p> <p>Chicago's last result was timely. After a 2-0 defeat at Sporting Kansas City and an abysmal, embarrassing 3-1 drubbing at home versus Philadelphia Union that marked the Fire's 15th anniversary, head coach Frank Klopas and company went from contenders to borderline pretenders in a mere six days. But doubts about the Fire's viability as a playoff squad were soon put aside. In a quick pivot, Chicago marched into Red Bull Arena and handled the New York Red Bulls. The Fire's focused, disciplined effort from back to front resulted in a 2-0 win that vaulted the Men in Red back into second place in the Eastern Conference, and again within striking distance of leaders Sporting.</p> <p>A glance at the standings might betray the real danger Saturday night's match at bottom-dwelling New England poses for Chicago. The Fire could walk into a trap if they are not mentally prepared for a 90 minute battle against a bitter rival. You can bet that head coach Jay Heaps will have his Revs ready to play hard in their last home match of 2012. How can Chicago earn a crucial, needed three points? Watch the New York tape; rinse and repeat. Look for Klopas to employ a 4-1-3-2 (ish) tactical formation. The Fire will attempt to maintain a tight shape in the back and absorb pressure while they look to win duels in the midfield, counterattack, and get the ball up top to big point-man Sherjill MacDonald and his counterpart, the mercurial trequartista Chris Rolfe.</p> <h2>Houston Dynamo vs Philadelphia Union, Sat 7.30pm (NBCSN, TSN 2)</h2> <p><strong>Zach Woosley</strong>, <a href=\"http://www.dynamotheory.com/\">Dynamo Theory</a>, Houston:</p> <p>The Dynamo's draw against Montreal was lame and yet another poor result for this team against non-playoff teams. If Houston ends up missing the playoffs, it will be due to their inability to consistently beat teams below them in the standings. Fortunately, Sporting KC did us a solid and drew with the Crew, allowing the Dynamo a mulligan as they remain precariously in fifth place. </p> <p>The Dynamo host the Philadelphia Union on Saturday and I have two perspectives on this game. My heart says the team has used the international break to re-focus and get their \"stuff\" together for the final two must win league matches of the season. My heart continues with the sentiment that the Dynamo will smash the Union and hold on the final playoff spot. My head on the other hand tells me that this Dynamo team has been consistently poor against the Union this season and why should that change, especially since Philly is playing better of late. I don't know who to believe, but my pessimistic nature is expecting the worse.</p> <p><strong>Adam Cann</strong>, <a href=\"http://phillysoccerpage.com/\">Philly Soccer Page</a>:</p> <p>Before last week's international break, the Philadelphia Union defeated the New England Revolution in a match that highlighted many of the young team's strengths and weaknesses. Philly's early dominance had no end product, and was followed by a defensive lapse that let Jerry Bengston in on goal alone. The return to form of the forgotten Keon Daniel climaxed with a free kick that set up the winning goal, but minutes later absurd set piece defending forced Zac MacMath into a brilliant low save. And then there was Jack McInerney. Frozen out of the squad until mid-June by former Union manager Peter Nowak, McInerney's tally against the Revolution means he now leads the team in goals (7) and shots on goal (16), while his three assists place him second behind Michael Farfan's five.</p> <p>This Saturday, the Union travel to Houston to face a team in desperate need of a win. Only one point ahead of Columbus for the final playoff spot in the Eastern Conference, the Dynamo cannot afford to stumble against Philly or Colorado in their last two matches. Less than a month ago, Freddy Adu's brace led the Union to a stunning 3-1 win over Houston. Adu has struggled with injuries since that match, but returned to practice and should feature in some capacity this weekend. Standout defender Sheanon Williams is doubtful, however, so flashy rookie Ray Gaddis will have to play big if the Union want to shut down the physical Dynamo offense.</p> <h2>Chivas USA vs Colorado Rapids, Sat 10.30pm</h2> <p><strong>Alicia Ratterree</strong>, <a href=\"http://www.thegoatparade.com/\">The Goat Parade</a>, Chivas USA:</p> <p>In their last match, Chivas USA hosted FC Dallas, and broke their losing streak with a 1-1 draw. Although the match started predictably, with a early goal by Blas Perez, Chivas showed fight for the first time in weeks and Jorge Villafana scored a timely goal for the Goats. If it wasn't for Dallas keeper Kevin Hartman, who made several excellent saves, Chivas would have likely gotten a winner.</p> <p>This week, Chivas hosts the Colorado Rapids in their home finale. Colorado has struggled mightily this season, but they have really looked to be a cut above Chivas in their previous meetings. Still, this will be the first game between the clubs at the Home Depot Center this season, and Chivas fans are desperate to see a win. Hopefully Chivas can continue the positive momentum from the Dallas match and produce a result against Colorado.</p> <p><strong>Todd Haggerty</strong>, <a href=\"http://www.pidarmy.com\">Pid Army</a>:</p> <p>Two years ago the Rapids defeated the Earthquakes en route to the MLS<br>Cup - now the Rapids are just a speed bump in the way of SJ clinching<br>the supporters shield. Wondo and the Quakes brushed aside the Rapids<br>with so much ease, in frigid conditions, that supporters should have<br>been offered a refund. Though a refund would potentially bankrupt the<br>team. </p> <p>With two games to go, Bravo and company have decided to shut<br>down a couple of veterans and give a chance to some of the younger<br>players to impress - never mind that these players have been unable to<br>crack the lineup on one of the worst teams in the league. Thankfully,<br>these youngsters (is Tyson Wahl young?) play Chivas USA on Saturday.<br>With only two points separating these clubs I expect a hard fought<br>high quality match with the Rapids winning the battle of OPTA stats<br>but losing on goals (OPTA stats are the \"true\" measure of a team).<br>Perhaps the anemic front offices from both of these teams will share<br>their secrets of success and next season will be amazing.</p> <h2>San Jose Earthquakes vs LA Galaxy, Sun 7pm (Galavision)</h2> <p><strong>\"Nerdy Gales\"</strong>, <a href=\"http://www.centerlinesoccer.com/\">Center Line Soccer</a>, San Jose:</p> <p>After another late equalizer against Dallas, Earthquakes fans again reveled in their excitement, while the press wondered if, perhaps, the team was riding its luck a little too far. Any concerns were quelled effectively when Chris Wondolowski scored his second hat trick of the season, contributing with Marvin Chavez to the subsequent 4-1 road victory over the Colorado Rapids. In freezing temperatures, the Quakes maintained the upper hand throughout; their performance marred only by an unnecessary tackle that earned Jason Hernandez a red card and the Rapids their only goal from the resulting penalty kick.</p> <p>Earthquakes fans go into the last home game, with the pregame emphasis firmly on the Earthquakes new stadium. After a four year wait, 5,500 fans will be engaged with blue shovels to break the existing Guinness world record of 4,532 attendees at a groundbreaking \u2013 got to dig that! The atmosphere of the long sold out game will undoubtedly live up to Quakes fans' expectations of excitement. A win or tie for the Earthquakes (or anything less than victory for Sporting KC) this weekend, will present the Supporters' Shield to San Jose \u2013 and the possibility of a brace for Chris Wondolowski, which would tie Roy's Lassiter's single season record, adds to our anticipation. The Quakes defense is the main concern, with a late decision on who will pair with Bernardez in center (Hernandez is suspended and Morrow is nursing a shoulder sprain). Options include Opara (cleared to play after concussion symptoms), Zayner, and bobblehead of Sunday's game, Ramiro Corrales. We'll take any magic (Goonie or otherwise) to keep the unbeaten record intact for the entire season at Buck Shaw \u2013 for then the Supporters Shield will be ours. </p> <p><strong>Josh Guesman</strong>, founder, <a href=\"http://www.thesection108.com\">The Section 108</a> blog, co-host of <a href=\"http://nasn.tv/category/corner-of-the-galaxy/\">Corner of the Galaxy</a> podcast, LA:</p> <p>With the international break over, the LA Galaxy can now put their 2-1 loss to Real Salt Lake behind them. The disjointed and costly drop of points can now only be relived through a Goal of the Week from Robbie Keane and questions from the makeshift back line. Currently listed on the injury report is the achilles of Robbie Keane, the knees of Landon Donovan and AJ DeLaGarza, and the hip of Todd Dunivant. While DeLaGarza's absence puts him back with the club sometime in early November, the rest are complete unknowns. Although, it is widely expected that Dunivant will be back for the weekend tie against Supporters' Shield front runners San Jose. </p> <p>What is confirmed however, is that the 2011 MLS Cup Champions will need to 'win out' if they want to avoid 4th place. However, the task of subduing the Western Conference giants may fall to a weakened squad with replacements aplenty. One welcomed addition may be the inclusion of recently signed Christian Wilhelmsson in midfield. If Landon Donovan, who has a bone bruise, doesn't play, expect Mike Magee to take over with Robbie Keane up top. Of course, that is assuming that Keane is given the green light on Sunday. Galaxy fans should also expect appearances by Edson Buddle and perhaps even 19 year old Jose Villarreal. Regardless, if LA can't get the win in the Bay Area, expect them to shut things down against Seattle and start preparing to face Vancouver shortly after in the playoffs. </p> <h2>Vancouver Whitecaps vs Portland Timbers, Sun 7pm</h2> <p><strong>GUARDIAN LIVE GAME</strong></p> <p><strong>Brenton Walters</strong>, Communications Director, <a href=\"http://vancouversouthsiders.ca/\">Vancouver Southsiders</a>:</p> <p>A win! Actually: A WIN! Finally, the Whitecaps emerged from their winless streak with a much-needed win over a hapless Chivas side, a thumping 4-0 win at home in front of some fans in desperate need of catharsis. The players were excellent, but Chivas were so poor defensively. Camilo in particular had a great game, scoring once and assisting twice, as did Richards, Robson and Koffie. With the win (and the subsequent Dallas draw with Chivas), the Caps put themselves in a great position in the play-off race, and now just need one win from their two remaining games to guarantee a spot.</p> <p>Which brings us to Portland, who travel north in the final Cascadia Cup derby of the season. The Timbers are pretty horrible on the road, winless all season. Building on our thrashing of Chivas and the instability in the Timbers squad, this should be a win for us. We're healthy, feeling confident, and ready to book a spot in the play-offs - the first Canadian team to do so. If we keep it tight at the back, maintain our composure in the middle and keep up pressure on Portland's frail backline, we should end the day on a happy note. </p> <p><strong>Roger Anthony</strong>, <a href=\"http://www.timbersarmy.org\">Timbers Army</a>, Portland:</p> <p>The Timbers do-or-die Cascadia Cup match in Seattle on Oct. 7 was about what Timbers Army diehards have come to expect from their die-easy squad. An uncompetitive 3-nil loss has set up yet another do-or-die Cascadia match in Vancouver this weekend. Portland actually got started on the right foot, with Diego Chara causing havoc in the middle of the pitch. Things unraveled soon enough: With Sounder star Freddy Montero streaking toward the near post, Timbers CB Futty Danso courteously deflected the incoming cross into the Portland net for him. (Who says these guys are rivals?) Three minutes later, Sounder MF Brad Evans found Eddie Johnson hiding in plain sight at the penalty spot, and before the 30-minute mark the game was effectively over.</p> <p>Remarkably, Portland can still capture the Cascadia Cup with a win at Vancouver Sunday. Perhaps even more remarkably, Designated Payee \u2026 er, Player, Kris Boyd, turned up for training this week, reanimating a season thought to have been extinguished with his long, slow hobble off the pitch in San Jose last month. Vancouver's Southsiders are undoubtedly trembling. </p> <p>As owner Merritt Paulson has frequently observed, Portland hasn't been awarded a penalty kick in MLS play this season. The fantasy scenario has Boyd coming off the bench and converting a penalty for a 1-nil, Cup-clinching win. The far-more-likely scenario is that the playoff-worthy Whitecaps wrap up their spot in the tournament, and the Timbers finish off a winless season on the road.</p> <h2>Seattle Sounders vs FC Dallas (ESPN, ESPN Deportes, TSN 2, RDS2)</h2> <p><strong>Dave Clark</strong>, <a href=\"\" http: www.sounderatheart.com \"\">Sounder at Heart</a>, Seattle:</p> <p>Seattle learned a lesson in their midweek draw with Real Salt Lake. That lesson? That despite being a man down and with a defense built out of midfielders they can still shut down a top team in the league. While there was only one point earned, the shutouts keep piling up for the Rave Green. Still positioned to finish as high as second in the West, the Sounders will have to move on from a roster depleted by international callups.</p> <p>They will do that against FC Dallas. It will be imperative for Seattle to get the offense in form prior to the MLS Cup Playoffs. Dallas' backline is a bit piecemeal right now. Eddie Johnson's return to the starting lineup should fuel the fire as his combination of speed and strength should torch a young and inexperienced line. Tiffert, Rosales and Johansson should provide the kindling to put an end to Matt Hedges Rookie of the Year campaign, as it burns out forcing Dallas out of the Playoff hunt.</p> <p><strong>Gina Zippilli</strong>, <a href=\"http://the-inferno.net\">The Inferno</a>, Dallas:</p> <p>We played at Chivas in our last game, which was a game we were expected to win and... I don't understand how, but we scored the first goal and then conceded one and ended up drawing it. It's pretty infuriating when that happens against the worst team in the league at this stage - especially since Vancouver put four past them just a few days earlier. It was even more disappointing to hear Schellas Hyndman say in his post match comments that he'd seen it coming because the team had had a bad practice beforehand. So a terrible result, but by the grace of the soccer gods we're still in it (the playoff race).</p> <p>The team is at Seattle on Sunday night - it's not going to be an easy game, especially knowing that Vancouver play before us. Even if Vancouver doesn't win their game, we'll be kicking off under intense pressure. We're without at least two key players as well - the injury picture is beginning to look like the start of the season: De Guzman is out with yellow cards, Jackson is doubtful, Shea has picked up a mystery injury and was sent back from the national team.

  "<p>For a working critic based in the capital, the London film festival is an enticing prospect \u2014 and yet a frustrating experience. The regular round of UK releases must be attended to; those films have to be reviewed (including the inevitable sprinkling of duds) and so LFF films have to be squeezed in wherever possible. </p> <p>What makes it all more agonising is the fact that the LFF programme is somehow always the most mouthwatering document produced by any festival: a juicily thick brochure, packed with great stuff, and an unmissable-looking film on every page. The LFF may not have as many premieres as <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/torontofilmfestival\" title=\"Toronto Film Festival\">Toronto</a>, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/venicefilmfestival\" title=\"Venice Film Festival\">Venice</a> and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/venicefilmfestival\" title=\"Cannes Film Festival\">Cannes</a>, but so what? That's the sort of thing that preoccupies industry types. Regular filmgoers in London are surely just delighted to have such a comprehensive lineup of titles, tried and tested and trusted by the other festivals.</p> <p>But there we are. The London critic has to sacrifice many delicious LFF films for his or her regular commitments. And for reviewers, there's another consideration. So many of the hot-ticket items at the LFF are coming out on general release anyway, often in just a couple of weeks. Reviewing them now is potentially bad timing and irritating for audiences outside London.</p> <p>So anyway: I try to focus on films that are not part of the obvious critical mainstream, inevitably a partial and arbitrary choice, and this year I've tried to take a look at some Italian films at the festival. (Interestingly, the most visible way the LFF's new artistic director <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2012/sep/05/london-film-festival-2012-lineup\" title=\"London film festival gets competitive\">Clare Stewart has changed the festival</a> is in abolishing the geographically-based categorisation of films: British, French, European, World Cinema etc. Instead, she's broken them down into themes: Love, Debate, Thrill etc. Is that telling the audience what to think? Well, maybe, but if it gets audiences for films which might otherwise be tucked away in geographical ghettos, then this innovation will have paid its way.)</p> <p>The Italian films I've seen are very different, but each in its way dwells satirically on the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/silvio-berlusconi?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"Silvio Berlusconi\">Berlusconi</a> culture: a preoccupation with get-rich-quick, celebrity, TV, gameshows, women getting jobs as sexed-up promo girls in shopping malls.</p> <p>L'Intervallo, or The Interval, is a gem of a film: thoughtful, low-key and tremendously acted. It has been directed and co-written by the documentary film-maker Leonardo Di Costanzo, making his fiction debut. It is set in Naples, a city shot with an absolute lack of sentimentality. A 16-year-old called Veronica (Francesca Riso) is in deep trouble with the mob, the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camorra\" title=\"the mafia group on wikipedia\">Camorra</a>; she has been ordered to wait in an abandoned, derelict building while the tough guys decide what to do with her. To make sure she does not escape, they have appointed an overweight, dopey teenage boy to watch over her: this is the unfortunate, resentful Salvatore (Alessio Gallo). Normally, he would be selling ice-cream from his heartbreakingly small cart: the Camorra have kidnapped this precious cart and held it hostage, to make sure he does his part in keeping Veronica hostage. The movie is effectively the \"interval\" between Veronica's offence becoming known and the mob arriving to deal with her. There's nothing for Veronica and Salvatore to do but wait, until the bad guys show up. At first, prisoner and guard are snappy and hostile with each other, and then a strange friendship develops as they realise that they are both prisoners. Inevitably, the Camorra reveals itself to be a chain of bullies getting picked on by bigger bullies. A low-level wiseguy called Mimmo (Salvatore Ruocco) is subordinate to a scarier <em>capo</em> called Bernardino (Carmine Paternoster) and finally the movie leaves it to us to decide how the four rank in real power and status.</p> <p>The LFF has a new film by Giuseppe Piccioni, a really interesting director whose previous works <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0282701/\" title=\"Luce dei miei occhi on IMDb\">Light of My Eyes </a>and <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1261055/\" title=\"Giulia non esce la sera on IMDb\">Guilia Doesn't Date At Night </a>have featured in London. This is called <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1964795/\" title=\"on IMDb\">Il Rosso E Il Blu</a>, or The Red and the Blue, a many-stranded film set in a high school in Rome. The lead is the smoulderingly handsome Riccardo Scamarcio, who played the hotel thief in Woody Allen's <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/149157/to-rome-with-love\" title=\"on guardian.co.uk/film\">To Rome With Love</a>. He is an idealistic young teacher trying to reach out to the bored and disaffected kids. <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0125540/\" title=\"the actor on IMDb\">Margherita Buy</a> plays the headteacher who is confronted with a startlingly dysfunctional pupil, and <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0379072/#Actor\" title=\"the actor on IMDb\">Roberto Herlitzka</a> is Prof Fiorito, the cantankerous and cynical old timer who despises the children and himself, but is astonished when an ex-pupil phones him out of the blue. I wasn't entirely convinced by this film, which seemed a little sugary and sentimental and content with cliches. It looks very much as if it has been inspired by Laurent Cantet's school-set film <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/128192/class\" title=\"the film on guardian.co.uk/film\">Entre Les Murs</a>, or The Class, particularly in the final shot. But this is pretty soft-centred.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1891788/\" title=\"on IMDb\">\u00c8 Stato Il Figlo</a>, or It Was the Son, directed by Daniele Cipr\u00ec, is absolutely brilliant: an operatically mad tragicomedy about greed and taboo, like something by <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/jonson\" title=\"\">Ben Jonson</a>, and it resembles Paolo Sorrentino's <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/115641/family.friend\" title=\"L'Amico Di Famiglia on guardian.co.uk/film\">The Family Friend</a>. The title's meaning becomes plain in a final double-twist. It stars an actor who has to be the king of contemporary Italian cinema: <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0785842/#Actor\" title=\"the actor on IMDb\">Toni Servillo</a>, going uproariously over the top as Nicola, a working class guy in Palermo who ekes out a living salvaging scrap metal from old ships. He's always shouting, yelling, shrugging and gesticulating at his extended family. His family's proximity to gangster culture has resulted in a terrible tragedy, but out of this comes a kind of wealth, which Nicola spends on a flashy car. But this car brings an inevitable catastrophe.</p> <p>Cipr\u00ec makes this movie with tremendous flair and visual attack and it is often very funny. I hope it gets a full UK release. At any rate, it's been a high point of the London film festival.</p>",
  "<p>Halloween will soon be upon us so if you were looking for a spooky project before the end of this half-term then we have hunted out some great ideas for you that will not only get your pupils being creative but will do so while keeping a sharp eye on your carbon footprint (and your budget).</p> <p>Using recycled materials is a great way to make great Halloween decorations and, let's face it, all schools have lots of waste materials to use. But a sensible idea to drive home the importance of being green and doing our bit to steer rubbish away from the landfill is to take a look at the kinds of rubbish we sometimes throw away. Start your recycling Halloween project with a trawl of the class bin. I did this with my year 4 class. We asked the caretaker not to empty our bin for a week and then at the end of the week I donned my rubber gloves, poured it all out onto a large plastic sheet on the floor and we made piles of all the different kinds of rubbish. Although we had a separate recycling bin you would be amazed at the amounts of plastic and paper that had sneaked into our general bin. It was a good reminder of what we should throw where apart from anything else!</p> <p>To help with the discussion about what happens to all our rubbish once we have binned it take a look at <a href=\"http://teachers.guardian.co.uk/teacher-resources/2110/Refuse-and-recycling\">this resource</a> which offers a rudimentary break-down and lots of talking points.</p> <p>But once you have analysed your rubbish keep to one side all the usual recycling suspects - but do make sure they are clean before contemplating using them. If you are concerned about using toilet rolls and egg boxes in class then just blast them for a few seconds in a microwave. Alternatively stick to the tubes from cling film and kitchen roll.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398043217\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/18/1350578260636/Green-witch-004.jpg\" alt=\"Green witch\" width=\"140\" height=\"130\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Green witch Photograph: Emma Drury</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Emma Drury</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For younger children - nursery and reception these <a href=\"http://alittlelearningfortwo.blogspot.co.uk/2011/03/changing-faces-toilet-roll-dolls.html\">changing face people</a> are ace and pretty simple to do. I had a go at one in a Halloween theme and simply painted my kitchen roll with green paint, added a black dress, some discarded ribbon hair (although I think a thatch of messy wool would have looked lots better) and made a wee broomstick from a piece of dowling and newspaper and ta da - one Halloween witch. And what was good about her was she could be a good witch, grumpy orange-faced witch or sickly looking witch depending on my mood. Great for using in role-play, helping to teach about emotions and why not use as the impetus for putting on a little puppet show?</p> <p>There are tonnes of other brilliant ideas for recycling projects you could utilise in school <a href=\"http://pinterest.com/cathyjames/glorious-junk/\">here</a>.</p> <p>However, staying with our spooky theme you could take a look here for a brilliant spider's web to hang on the classroom door <a href=\"http://playresource.org/spooky-spider-wreath/\">here</a> using old newspapers to create both the wreath and the spider or older children could take a look at this witchy figure http://playresource.org/witch-figure/ who could be made from recycled cardboard and paper.</p> <p>For older children much could be gleaned from making a skeleton from recycled plastic milk bottles. This site has a step-by-step guide to <a href=\"http://www.ehow.com/how_12129723_make-human-skeleton-model-empty-plastic-milk-bottles.html\">creating a scary skeleton</a> and there's no harm doing a bit of learning about our bones on the way.</p> <p>Don't forget that clothes can be used happily to create some ghouls and ghosts. Put out an appeal for washed odd socks and then with the socks create hand puppets. You can sew on old buttons to create eyes, sew or glue on some hair and if you fancy making a dragon or a serpent then add in a strip of red felt for a tongue. Give each character a name and make a start on a class Halloween story - you could even take photos of them to help illustrate it or make it into a spooky fairy tale.</p> <p>Finally, get your students to use leftover card and paper to create and decorate these <a href=\"http://teachers.guardian.co.uk/teacher-resources/5631/?INTCMP=NECJOBBTN767I2\">bat masks</a> or <a href=\"http://teachers.guardian.co.uk/teacher-resources/5632/?INTCMP=NECJOBBTN767I2\">creepy tarantula mask</a> - much better than the usual masks doing the rounds when out trick or treating. Download the resource, create one template out of card to save on resources and set the class the challenge of making them only with paper from the recycling box.</p> <p>Happy, safe and green Halloween.</p> <h2>This content is brought to you by <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/guardian-professional\" title=\"Guardian Professional\">Guardian Professional</a>.

  "<p>Aesop had already grasped a fundamental truth when he said \"persuasion is often more effectual than force,\" more than 2,600 years ago.</p> <p>Understanding the mysterious art of persuasion has been an obsession for many ever since and brands have long played the persuasion card successfully. They are skilled and experienced masters at convincing us to buy products we didn't know we wanted. Recently, and encouragingly, progressive brands have been using their well-honed persuasion muscle to cajole their consumers into being greener.</p> <p>These brands are building behaviour change into products, modelling green lifestyles through behavioural placement and using the weight of their marketing expertise to persuade. These are the three P's of brands and behaviour change.</p> <p>Sustainability persuasion is the traditional territory of governments and NGOs. We are familiar with their prods, pleas, and occasional coercion into making us better people. Public information campaigns that play hard on our emotions and anxieties have been successful over the decades at getting us to quit smoking, only drive when sober and wear seat belts.</p> <p>In each of these cases the reward is obvious: change your behaviour or risk death, disease or legal sanction. However, when campaigns have tried to enter the green lifestyle arena, their successes have been less noteworthy and harder to achieve. Persuasion can quickly morph into nagging and, as a result, the hackles of resistance quickly rise.</p> <p>Brands, by comparison, are much more confident talking about and changing our lifestyles. By drawing on their powers of persuasion they are able to nudge and push their consumers' environmental behaviour with far more impressive results than expensive public information campaigns.</p> <p>In Sweden the popular hamburger chain Max has searched for radical sustainability improvements. In 2008 they began putting CO2 labels on the menu. By revealing to customers that its Grand de Luxe Cheese 'n' Bacon beef burger produced five times more carbon dioxide than its vegetarian burger, and six times more than a fish sandwich, Max allowed for clear comparison at point of sale (an attribute other carbon labelling schemes struggle with). Although information on its own doesn't work, in this context sales of the lower-carbon burgers increased by 16%. Max also believes the move improved the business overall.</p> <p>McDonald's, as Max's key rival, has had its own persuasive successes. Keen to play a more active role in reducing litter in its communities, the company began to put comparative pictures of a littered street scene next to a litter-free street scene on its food trays and packaging. The simplicity of this visual cue, together with clear messaging on packaging, combines consciously directive messaging with subconscious visual clues to change behaviour. The company reported a 25% reduction in complaints from neighbours about litter.</p> <p>This is a key learning for would-be persuaders. The recipe for behaviour communications is one part clear directives on the desired behaviour, carefully mixed with visual, emotive and social nudges.</p> <p>In Denver the smart use of imagery helped lead to a 20% reduction in water use across the city. Local water company Denver Water put up billboards in which only a small fraction of the available space carried the message: \"Use only what you need\". It drew the eye, had visually impact and memorable. It also ran for years giving time to embed in the popular consciousness.</p> <p>These smart, simple infographics are key tools for behaviour change, but so is a giggle. Axe shower gel (known in the UK as Lynx) promotes the radical idea to its teenage male customers \u2013 a notoriously hard demographic to turn green \u2013 that sharing a shower uses far less water. Shamelessly (but effectively), it ran a press and online video campaign showing a male silhouette waving from under a shower with a female figure either side of him. At a stroke, the rather boring, nagging notion of saving water suddenly has appeal for young men.</p> <p>These are just a few of the brands that are using their power to persuade people to change their behaviour. The growing interest of brands in changing consumer behaviour is probably the most interesting sustainability development for years but much more is needed.</p> <p>In 2010 brands spent $450bn (\u00a3280bn) on advertising worldwide. Imagine what could be achieved if just a small fraction of that was used to persuade people to change their behaviour? We need to nudge the nudgers into action. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sustainable-business/planet-brands-index-change-the-world\" title=\"\">Our Planet Brands Index</a> identifies 100 brands that have the potential to change the world.</p> <p><em>Lucy Shea is chief executive of </em><a href=\"http://www.futerra.co.uk/\" title=\"\"><em>Futerra Sustainability Communications</em></a><em> </em></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by </strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/guardian-professional\" title=\"Guardian Professional\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

  "<p>The call for reform started in Jordan well before the Arab spring. However, it has intensified since \u2013 not only because of the Arab revolutions, but also in response to widespread state corruption. Jordan's reformers are demanding constitutional changes; in particular, changes to our election law so that a truly representative parliament is possible, together with an elected prime minister who is accountable to parliament.</p> <p>The national demonstrations that took place earlier this month exposed the attitude of Jordanian officials toward reform. The demonstration was organised by the Muslim Brotherhood together with more than 70 independent initiatives. The announcement that the opposition was to hold a peaceful demonstration was met with a concerted campaign to disrupt it. The media even reported that radioactive pollution was present in the area of the demonstration. Various officials prepared a counter demonstration under the title \"Loyalty to the King\" in the same place, and at the same time.</p> <p>However, the demonstration went ahead \u2013 the largest in the country's history \u2013 putting Jordan on the path of true reform. What is most striking is that this large attendance was drawn from all parts of the country \u2013 cities, villages, Bedouin centres and refugee camps \u2013 and included many women. The official response had been designed to instil fear; it failed. Many in Jordan now speak of this demonstration as the beginning of the Jordanian spring.</p> <p>Just days after the demonstration, the newly appointed prime minister, Abdullah Al-Nsour, declared there were to be no changes to the election law, a key reform demand. This did little to relieve the tension. Just as 2011 witnessed the formation of four different governments in Jordan, so this year will end with at least three governments, with the dissolution of two parliaments before the end of their terms \u2013 a clear indication of political instability. The regime has no clear exit plan from this crisis.</p> <p>The need for reform is clear, but the regime does not want to accept it. This is obvious, not only in the way it dealt with the demonstration, but also in its dealings with its own representatives. The king had said he would be the guarantor of the findings of the Committee of National Dialogue which was formed and headed by Tahir al-Masri, the head of the appointed upper house of parliament. But instead the king insisted on the electoral law that was issued by the <a href=\"http://www.gid.gov.jo/en/home.html\" title=\"\">General Intelligence</a>, not that which was issued by the committee. Those who participated in this committee were betrayed, as was the prime minster at the time, Awn Al-Khasawneh, who resigned refusing to allow the passage of laws formulated by the intelligence services.</p> <p>The opposition is now faced with the choice of remaining in the street, or entering the elections. We have chosen to remain in the streets until genuine reform is achieved \u2013 the forthcoming elections have been manipulated even before they begin, and will be directed by a committee headed by Abdul Ilah al-Khateeb, a former minister in the government that forged the 2007 elections.</p> <p>Our regime is good at talking about reform. As for reform itself, it still has a long way to go. The Arab spring was used to spread fear among the people. The regime continues to scare the west, too, pointing to the rise of the Islamists after the rise of the Arab spring.</p> <p>The fact that Bashar al-Assad continues in office, despite his savagery, has also given a boost to Jordan's repressive regime. And having seen that the world does not call to account Assad, we in the Jordanian opposition have deep doubts about the true intentions of the American and British troops who were reported to be on Jordanian soil. They claim they are providing \"protection to Jordan from Syrian spillover\", but we oppose any foreign troops on our land, and consider this a clear violation of Jordanian sovereignty.</p> <p>In Jordan, the regime has not shed blood; it pursues a strategy of \"clean repression\". Regrettably, the victory of Hamas in the 2006 Palestinian parliamentary elections was used as an excuse to forge the Jordanian elections in 2007. That was not a one-off: the Palestinian intifada was also used as an excuse to suspend parliamentary life for two years, during which time the government issued 200 temporary laws in the absence of a parliament. Today the Arab spring is used as an excuse to delay, rather than accelerate, reform.</p> <p>Even so, in the absence of bloodshed there is still hope. In our monarchical system, reform is possible, and we have a history of reform that we can build upon. In the 1950s, a constitution was enacted and a parliamentary government was formed. In 1989, the Islamic Movement participated as a partner in the government and led a programme of democratic transformation.</p> <p>The monarchical system is able to benefit from global experience \u2013 most notably, perhaps, that of King Juan Carlos and the transition to democracy in Spain. Ironically, the late King Hussein Bin Talal said in 1989 that he wanted to do as his friend, Juan Carlos, had done, but democratic transformation was aborted because of external factors, among them the Gulf war and the Wadi Araba Treaty with Israel. We hope that this time reform will be realised with transition to a genuine constitutional monarchy. The decision is still in the hands of the king, who today holds absolute power.</p>",
  "<p>After writing six historical novels in a row, with my latest novel <em>Dominion</em> I have fulfilled a long-held ambition and written an alternate history novel, a \"what-if\". I remember, as a history student in the 70s, reading Len Deighton's novel <em>SS-GB</em>, an alternate history in which Germany has successfully invaded Britain in 1940 and the country is divided between resisters and collaborators. Its imagining of a defeated Britain rife with spies stuck with me, and I became a fan of second world war alternate history novels, especially Robert Harris's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/fiction/9780099571575/fatherland\" title=\"\"><em>Fatherland</em></a>, which I think is the best.</p> <p>Most such novels imagine a successful invasion of Britain, but my own reading convinced me that, militarily, Germany's planned 1940 invasion could not have succeeded, given Britain's control of the air and the sea. So I turned to another option, which very nearly happened \u2013 Neville Chamberlain being succeeded as prime minister in 1940 not by Winston Churchill but by fellow-appeaser Lord Halifax. Most of the Conservative Party, Chamberlain himself, and the King, wanted Halifax, not Churchill, to lead the proposed new coalition government, and the Labour Party left it to the Conservatives to decide. Halifax's doubts about his ability to be a war leader gave Churchill the post. If Halifax had assumed the position I think he would have made peace after Dunkirk; he certainly argued for doing so then. The terms would have been Britain keeping her empire and leaving Germany a free hand in Europe. I think, as Churchill did, that had this happened Britain would inevitably have ended up as a German satellite.</p> <p>In <em>Dominion</em>, rigged elections have, by 1952, brought an increasingly authoritarian Britain run by Lord Beaverbrook and Oswald Mosley, while the growing strength \u2013 and violent actions \u2013 of the British Resistance, led by Churchill and Attlee, have led to the government allowing an expanded Special Branch and Auxiliary Police force to crack down ferociously on dissent, with the Gestapo in the background, while Germany increasingly presses Britain to deport its Jews for \"resettlement in the East\".</p> <p><em>Dominion</em> is a book about resisters and collaborators. The resisters are not all shining heroes. Nor are the collaborators all monsters. Some are motivated by fanatical nationalism, others are venal, but others are pacifists, while everyone fears threats not just to themselves but their families. The book's central character, David, is a civil servant secretly supplying information to the resistance. But he is full of conflict \u2013 over his part-Jewish background, which he has kept secret even from his wife Sarah, and over the dangers his activities could place her in. Sarah comes from a family of pacifists, some of whom are now collaborators, and the way she, and they, react to developing events is a major theme of the book.</p> <p>David is sent on a dangerous mission and he and a group of fellow-resisters are pursued across a shabby, frightened Britain by a relentless Gestapo agent, Gunther Hoth. With Gunther I have tried showing something different to a stock Nazi, and he has some of the features of the classic modern detective \u2013 he is shambling and awkward, with a disastrous personal life, but also a brilliant and intrepid detective and hunter of \u2013 in his eyes \u2013 wrongdoers. He has an unshakeable moral compass. Unfortunately this is Nazism, and he is capable of its most appalling acts. But how a decent enough young German became a slave to Hitler's ideas is also part of the tale.</p> <p>In writing my historical novels I have always tried to be as accurate as possible in conveying the world of the story. That is a hard task, but in <em>Dominion</em> there was the additional challenge that my 1950s never actually existed. I had to think through the developments I thought would have taken place in Britain after surrender \u2013 political, social, cultural. For example TV, which had just got started before the war closed it down, returns in 1940 not 1945, is more widespread and under increasing government control. There was no blitz, no Attlee government or welfare state. The world I have created is, I hope, recognisably the early 50s, but warped and twisted and impoverished, its worst aspects exaggerated.</p> <p>In the wider world of the story America, after Britain's surrender, did a deal with the Japanese and retreated into isolation. All Europe is under Germany's heel, and with Britain gone from the field Hitler invaded Russia earlier and with more troops. However, unlike in some alternate history novels, the Third Reich is not triumphant. Hitler's Russian war has gone on for 11 years, sucking the resources of Germany and all Europe into the limitless territories of the Soviet Union. Hitler's Parkinson's Disease has left him a disabled recluse. Riven with internal conflict, the Nazi regime is on the edge of collapse. I always thought the whole Nazi enterprise was far more fragile than many think.</p> <p>Why write this novel now? The main reason was that, having written four Tudor novels in a row I badly needed a break from Henry VIII's England. But also, during the last two years as I wrote the book, the evils of politics based on race and nationalism \u2013 its dominant theme \u2013 came to the fore again in Europe as economic crisis gripped the continent and many people responded, as they had in the 30s, by turning to nationalist solutions. I find the free-market ideology that has dominated the world for the past 30 years, and brought us to our present ruin, a dogma that has failed repeatedly and disastrously, but politics based on national identity is even more dangerous; anti-rational, demagogic, assuming individuals should be defined by their nationality, and, always, against an enemy.</p> <p>Tragically, and unlike in the 1930s, nationalisms are on the rise in Britain as elsewhere in Europe, with Ukip and, north of the border, the Scottish National Party. In <em>Dominion</em> I have gone to town on the SNP's opposition to actively fighting fascism, which was also true in the real world. I make no apology for using the book to stress how I see the SNP, for all the moderate face it currently presents, as deeply dangerous, with no politics in the conventional sense, believing only in the old dream that the unleashing of \"national spirit\" and \"national pride\" can solve a country's problems.</p>",

  "<p>The <a href=\"http://allafrica.com/stories/201210010123.html\" title=\"\">economic and security agreements</a> signed by Sudan and South Sudan, including one on oil, cannot come into force soon enough in Leer.</p> <p>South Sudan's decision to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jan/26/south-sudan-shuts-oil-wells\" title=\"\">shut down its own oil production</a> in January, as part of its row with Sudan, was initially a popular decision, even in this small town of conical thatched huts and a few concrete buildings in oil-producing Unity state. The shutdown was described by vice-president Riek Machar, who is from Leer, as the moment South Sudan assumed economic independence from Sudan.</p> <p>But South Sudan relies on its neighbour's oil infrastructure, from pipelines and refineries to the export terminal. When there was no agreement on how much Juba should pay in transportation fees, Khartoum began confiscating oil \u2013 or \"stealing\" it, as Juba's leaders saw it \u2013 \"in lieu\" of payment. This resulted in production being halted. But it did not take long before the precipitous drop in revenues hit home. Oil had provided 98% of the South Sudanese government's budget. Without it, almost everything ground to a halt.</p> <p>\"When the oil was stopped, so many problems happened. The economy went into a downturn. The things we got from oil stopped, and so did the development we were doing in the counties,\" says Peter Nyok, the senior administrator for Leer county, careful to add that he and other local officials were in favour of the decision to shut down the oilfields.</p> <p>Following the deal signed with Sudan, South Sudanese officials now hope to get production restarted by the end of this year. But Nyok's office, devoid of filing cabinets or computers, contains little sign that he and his small team had the necessary resources to bring about much-needed change even when the oil was flowing.</p> <p>A short distance across Freedom Square, which the heavy rains have turned into a quagmire, the police have similar problems. The well-regarded local police commander, Colonel David Gatluak, explains that he has only 186 officers to cover Leer county's 16 payams (administrative units). The police don't have a single car, so they have to chase criminals \u2013 often cattle rustlers \u2013 on foot. Worse, there are only five radios between the entire force. The mobile phone network is not very reliable, which means they often only hear about crimes a few miles away when someone runs through the mud to tell them.</p> <p>Since July, says Gatluak, salary payments have been coming late, and an ordinary police officer's monthly pay packet has decreased from 640 to 450 South Sudanese pounds (SSP; about \u00a370). South Sudan, like Sudan, implemented a range of austerity measures because of the shutdown. \"There are a lot of challenges facing us,\" Gatluak says. \"We need support. We cannot blame the new government because it is a new nation. It will come, slowly.\"</p> <p>In the market, prices have risen sharply. A bag of sorghum used to cost 300 SSP; now it is 700, according to trade unionists. An onion costs more than \u00a31. One of the economic agreements signed should end an economic blockade imposed by Sudan, which has caused the price rises. The agreements on trade and opening border crossings could be more significant than the oil flowing again, as many people here say they haven't benefited from the oil billions South Sudan has received in the past few years.</p> <p>Leer is cattle country, and in a sense this has provided a sort of insulation from the oil shutdown. People still count their wealth by the number of cows they own. Cows are used to pay dowries, and are only sold as a last resort. Gatgong Jiech has 10 cows. \"I am not rich, but I am alive,\" he says. The years of peace have brought many benefits, he explains. He didn't get an education, but now he sends his older children to school.</p> <p>At Emma secondary school \u2013 named after the late British aid worker Emma McCune, who married vice-president Machar when he was a rebel leader \u2013 they've had to move. The classrooms have flooded, so they're now sharing the old brick buildings of a nearby primary school. There is a lack of exercise books, textbooks and even pens. That's not all. \"One of the challenges is we receive a very low salary,\" says Simon Bol, a maths teacher. \"It cannot compensate all our needs. When we got our independence we wished our salary would increase. But after the oil has been shut down people are suffering. We even received our salary two or three months late.\"</p> <p>The oil shutdown put a temporary halt to many development projects in South Sudan. If the trade and oil agreements with Sudan are properly implemented, they should bring some relief in Leer, and elsewhere.</p>"
