Viewership was down. Neither candidate dwelled on foreign policy on the campaign trail today.</strong> Obama did return to a moment from the debate when he went after Romney on the auto bailout:&#xa0;\"He looked me in the eye and&#xa0;tried to pretend he never said let Detroit go bankrupt!\"</p> <p>\u2022<strong> The Obama campaign announced it is printing 3.5 million booklets laying out what it called a plan for a second term.</strong> It also bought ad time in nine swing states to air a new 60-second commercial. The Romney campaign produced multiple new web videos using footage from the debate.</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>A debate broke out over whether Romney has the momentum in the race for the White House or whether he has never held the lead and even now is losing in the states that count.</strong> Both can't be right.</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Gallup's tracking poll showed a 5-point gap with Romney in the lead.

Now he's just another partisan squabbler who, after he loses this election, will probably follow losers like Mike Huckabee and Al Gore into a career in cable punditry. Maybe get a time slot on MSNBC.</p> <p>This is (a dramatized version of) the case laid out by John Cook in a<a href=\"http://gawker.com/5954125/2008-called-it-wants-to-know-what-happened-to-barack-obama\"> lament </a>on Gawker reacting to Obama's joke last night that \"The 1980s are now calling to ask for their foreign policy back.\" Cook writes:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>That's a middling joke. It should by no means be coming from the president of the United States, let alone one who promised to put away childish things. It's a dumb \"zinger,\" transparently crafted to appeal to the Mark Halperins and Politicos of the world. That's not to say that humor has no place in political rhetoric or that Obama betrays his promise every time he deigns to insult his opponent. But to graft a pre-planned VH1 <em>Best Week Ever</em>-level joke onto a nationally televised discussion about life and death and our role on the world stage is scarcely less pathetic than the desperate flailings of the McCain campaign that I smugly scoffed at four years ago.</p> </blockquote> <p>Cook has a point, and it is this: the McCain campaign was capable of scoff-able flailing. Where Cook is wrong is in his earnest notion that a dumb debate joke sullies the presidential stole.</p> <p>In a tortured essay of personal disillusionment, Cook finds equal fault with Obama's recent stump speech laugh line about how Mitt Romney has so much trouble keeping track of his policy positions that he must be suffering from \"Romnesia.\" The pun, Cook writes, is \"too juvenile and jokey to be coming from the president.\"</p> <p>The attack over \"Romnesia\" is coming at the president today from the right, too:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/jpodhoretz/status/260760216608595968\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Please, would somebody who isn't simply an Obama fan explain to me why \"Romnesia\" is a smart, voter-getting crack?</p>&mdash; John Podhoretz (@jpodhoretz) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jpodhoretz/status/260760216608595968\" data-datetime=\"2012-10-23T15:10:54+00:00\">October 23, 2012</a></blockquote> </figure>  <p>First, here's why Obama says \"Romnesia\" on the stump:</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8BBEXB1Wf9c\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/8BBEXB1Wf9c?wmode=opaque&fs=1&feature=oembed&start=45\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>The crowd loves it.</p> <p>Politics plays out in arenas. Sometimes in stadiums. It increasingly plays out across social networks in which buzzy material spreads and boring material dies. The point is to win the crowd. Few politicians have been as good at it as Obama is. That YouTube clip has 400,000 views and change, and there are many vigorously viewed copies.</p> <p>Second, the notion that Obama has ever been above dumb jokes is a wrong notion. This is a president who, talking about a regulation that classifies milk as oil, said, in a State of the Union address: \"I guess it was worth crying over spilled milk.\" Michelle had <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdjwD2LEGOo\">to close her eyes</a> at that one.</p> <p>This is a president who cannot resist <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=fzpcgRfc0CI\">dumb baseball jokes</a>, and dumb jokes about how he finds it reassuring that his daughters, as they approach dating age, are in the constant company of men with guns.</p> <p>But in Cook's eyes the dumb debate joke is only a symptom of a larger affliction. Obama, he writes, has lost the \"sense of himself as the adult in the room.\"</p> <p>Obama may have adjusted his rhetorical style from 2008. It would be an occasion for unearthly discomfort had he not. Obama cannot, in 2012, stand behind a lectern and say, \"We are the change we've been waiting for.\" He said that before he was elected as the nation's first black president. He said that at the end of eight long years of George W. Bush. It was a statement of patent truth whose force has dissipated as the novelty of Obama's first candidacy has turned into the reality of his presidency.</p> <p>A couple dumb jokes aren't ruinous to the Obama brand, because the brand is no longer built on the promise of a more adult politics. It's now built on the health care law, the withdrawal of troops from Iraq and a cold-blooded policy of assassination by flying robot. It's built on getting slapped around by Republicans in Congress. If he doesn't win re-election, it will be built next to Jimmy Carter's retirement home.</p> <p>Grown-ups don't judge Obama on his jokes. They judge him on his record.</p> <p>P.S. And also, let's not forget what aggressively dumb political speech actually sounds like:</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b3VXXN-fF2A\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/b3VXXN-fF2A?wmode=opaque&fs=1&feature=oembed&start=20\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>  </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-10-23T21:01:11.662Z\">at 10.01pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5086d6b5c0e376c4a1112e39\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-23T17:41:09.365Z\">6.41pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Obama narrows gap in Gallup poll</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The president is on the improve in Gallup's national 7-day tracking poll, in which he has recently trailed by as many as 7 points among likely voters.</p> <p>Today Gallup <a href=\"http://www.gallup.com/home.aspx\">finds</a> a 5-point margin, with Romney out front 51-46 among likely voters.

It's Tuesday, with two (2) weeks to go before election day. Here's a summary of where things stand:</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Governor Romney and President Obama met on a Florida stage last night to debate foreign policy, a topic that turned out to encompass the state of Wisconsin's schools and of Detroit's car factories.</strong> The foreign policy discussion centered on the Middle East and North Africa: Iran, Israel, Syria, Libya, Iraq, Egypt.&#xa0;</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/NickKristof/status/260569672213217280\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Foreign policy debate spent more time on Israel than on Europe, India and Africa combined. That's not our world.</p>&mdash; Nicholas Kristof (@NickKristof) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NickKristof/status/260569672213217280\" data-datetime=\"2012-10-23T02:33:45+00:00\">October 23, 2012</a></blockquote> </figure>  <p>\u2022 <strong>Who \"won\"?</strong> The snap polls picked the president. <a href=\"http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2012/10/22/cnn-poll-who-won-the-debate/?hpt=hp_t1\">CNN</a> found Obama out front 48-40; <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-250_162-57537795/poll-decisive-win-for-obama-in-final-debate/?tag=MaxDeep\">CBS</a> found Obama on top 53-23 with 24% of respondents calling the debate a \"tie\".</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Obama repeatedly accused Romney of being \"all over the map\" with his stated policy positions, and indeed Romney had significantly amended his stances on core questions of war and peace from what they were two weeks ago.</strong> Questions like should the US have kept tens of thousands of troops in Iraq and should we commit to leaving Afghanistan by 2014. Voters who care where the Republican candidate stands will have to guess.&#xa0;</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>The anticipated debate over the administration's arguably poor handling of the aftermath of the attack in Benghazi, Libya, on September 11 never materialized.</strong> Obama was not pressed to explain why there was not more security in place at the US mission or why the White House originally peddled a false version of events.&#xa0;</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Romney said the Middle East had slid toward chaos under the Obama administration.</strong> He said Iran is \"four years closer\" to a nuclear weapon and al-Qaida is resurgent in North Africa. Romney's best line: \"We can't kill our way out of this mess.\"&#xa0;</p> <p>\u2022 A<strong>part from his utter aqueousness on policy, Romney came in for criticism for seeming lightweight or unpracticed next to the president in discussing how to steer the ship of state.</strong> Romney laid out a bullet-point prescription for intervention in Syria that sounded like the work of a management consultant proposing to fix Acme, Inc. Romney stutteringly confused Iran and Iraq, and he said that Syria was the non-contiguous Persian Gulf state of Iran's \"route to the sea\". He ventured criticism of the president's record but seemed unable to imbue his critique with the force of knowledge or vision or belief.</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>There were zingers.&#xa0;</strong></p> <p>Obama: \"In the 1980s, they're now calling to ask for their foreign policy back because you know, the cold war's been over for 20 years.\"&#xa0;</p> <p>Romney: \"I congratulate him on taking out Osama bin Laden and going after the leadership in al-Qaida. But we can't kill our way out of this mess.\"&#xa0;</p> <p>Obama: \"You mentioned the navy, for example, and that we have fewer ships than we did in 1916. Well, governor, we also have fewer horses and bayonets, because the nature of our military's changed.\"</p> </div>   </div>",

Yet, for now at least, the 4,730 Celtic supporters at the Camp Nou are gazing back, misty-eyed, to 2004, when the Hoops drew twice at Barcelona and clinging to an unlikely repeat. They couldn't do it again, could they?</p> <!-- Block 3 --> <p><strong>Well, no ... </strong> ... Most of the starting XI that faced Barcelona in 2004 were veterans of the 2003 Uefa Cup campaign, which saw the Hoops reach the final before losing to Jose Mourinho's spoiling, diving, super-cynical Porto side in a minor classic. On their day Martin O'Neill's side could beat anyone. But this 2012 Celtic vintage, while admirable in many ways, isn't in that class. Drop them into the Premier League and they'd surely be fighting to stay up [mbm reporter ducks for cover].</p> <!-- Block 4 --> <p><strong>Team news:</strong></p> <p><strong>Barcelona (4-1-2-3):</strong> Vald\u00e9s, Adriano, Mascherano, Bartra, Song, Jordi, Alba, Xavi, Iniesta, Pedro, Messi, Alexis. <strong>Subs:</strong> Pinto, Montoya, Cesc, Dos Santos, Sergi Roberto, Villa, Tello.</p> <p><strong>Celtic (9-0-1):</strong> Forster, Lustig, Wilson, Ambrose, Izaguirre, Mulgrew, Brown, Ledley, Wanyama, Samaras, Hooper.</p> <!-- Block 5 --> <p><strong>Reasons to be cheerful for Celtic fans:</strong> Sergio Busquets, who is suspended, plus Alves, Piqu\u00e9, Puyol, Thiago, Cuenca and Muniesa will also miss tonight's match. Their defence conceded four at the weekend. Any others?</p> <!-- Block 6 --> <p><strong>1 min</strong> We're off! Celtic, kicking from right-to-left on my TV<br>screen, gets things underway. I'm having the odd technical gremlin so<br>forgive me if the updates are patchier than a band of particularly<br>unruly pirates for a bit.</p> <!-- Block 7 --> <p><strong>3 min</strong> Barcelona immediately gain possession and are already<br>probing for weaknesses. Messi finds Alexis ... who puts it wide. What<br>a chance! Meanwhile Colin Wan writes: \"Fabregas has got to be<br>absolutely gutted not to be in the team today. He was brilliant<br>against Deportivo. And I think Messi likes playing with him. Though I<br>bet Messi could probably score if they blindfolded him, forced him<br>into and England shirt and made him take a penalty in a game against<br>Germany.\"</p> <!-- Block 8 --> <p><strong>5 min</strong> And so it continues, left to right and back end, with<br>Xavi conducting the orchestra. An early goal here and this could be a<br>hiding ...</p> <!-- Block 9 --> <p><strong>7 min</strong> A long ball is pumped forward by Forster, flicked on by<br>Samaras and then Brown fouls. You suspect it will be the first of many<br>tonight.</p> <!-- Block 10 --> <p><strong>10 min</strong> Alba's cross scoots along the six yard box but Celtic<br>are able to clear. They're conceding a lot of possession, but that was<br>always going to be the case. \"Well, so far Celtic are categorically<br>the best British team in Europe. Well done, them,\" says Matt Dony, not<br>unreasonably.</p> <!-- Block 11 --> <p><strong>14 min</strong> Decent stuff from Celtic, particularly down the left<br>with Samaras and Izaguirre linking nicely. Meanwhile Scott Brown makes<br>his presence felt, and concedes a foul.</p> <!-- Block 12 --> <p><strong>16 min</strong> Pass. Pass. Pass. Pass. Pass. Pass. Pass. Pass. Tackle.<br>Celtic are defending <em>so</em> deep here ...</p> <!-- Block 13 --> <p><strong>17 min</strong> Drama! First Forster saves and then almost immediately<br>Celtic, who have been inviting all sorts of pressure, nearly<br>rope-a-dope Barcelona. The Hoops have a three-on-three for a second,<br>but it's cleared.</p> <!-- Block 14 --> <p><strong>18 min GOAL! CELTIC ARE AHEAD! Barcelona 0-1 Celtic (Mascherano OG<br>18)</strong> Charlie Mulgrew skizzles one in, it hits Samaras's shoulder<br>pinballs on to Mascherano and into the net. Incredible scenes at the<br>Camp Nou!</p> <!-- Block 15 --> <p><strong>21 min</strong> Barcelona continue to patiently probe. They could be 1-0<br>up or 0-1 down here; you wouldn't know the difference in the style of<br>their play.</p> <!-- Block 16 --> <p><strong>22 min</strong> Meanwhile Ryan Dunne emails in: \"I'm personally a<br>Glorious Glasgow Rangers fan myself, but dare I say that many a Celtic<br>fan would regard their team as Scottish/Irish (not necessarily a<br>criticism; afterall, Barca are Catalan) rather than being the British<br>anything. Fair play though, the O'Neil Celtic were powerful and<br>exciting. I'm no Jonathan Wilson, but is the O'Neil favourite 3-5-2<br>really as dour as people allege? Galloping wingers! Two up Front! At<br>least one creative central midfielder! What's not to love?\"<br>Please consider the environment before printing this email.</p> <!-- Block 17 --> <p><strong>24 min</strong> Messi powers a free-kick <em>this</em> close over the bar.<br>It had fizz, dip and Boltesque pace ... it was just an inch or so too<br>high.</p> <!-- Block 18 --> <p><strong>26 min</strong> There was a moment there when Barcelona were<br>tiki-taki-ing the ball about when Celtic had eight defenders and their<br>keeper in the penalty box. And still Alba, trying to run onto a<br>throughball, is given offside.</p> <!-- Block 19 --> <p><strong>28 min</strong> Meanwhile spare a thought for David Goldstone: \"Many<br>months ago I booked a romantic two night break to Barcelona, staying<br>at an indescribably chic and expensive hotel in a peaceful square just<br>off La Ramblas. Brilliantly I managed to choose the two nights when<br>Celtic were in town. No sleep last night. If they win and we have<br>another sleepless night being serenaded by the green and whites then<br>my marriage is seriously over. Come on Messi. Do it for me.\" Win or<br>lose tonight David, I suspect you're going to be \"serenaded\" again.</p> <!-- Block 20 --> <p><strong>29 min</strong> Big miss from Marc Bartra! From a corner, Iniesta, who<br>has perhaps been an octave or two below his searing best so far, sends<br>a swirling cross that Bartra meets six yards out ... and glances wide.<br>He should have scored there.</p> <!-- Block 21 --> <p><strong>31 min</strong> Meanwhile Ryan Dunne is back. \"Yikes, some crazy<br>scorelines tonight! I'm sure I cant' be the only, Sean, wondering if<br>yourself or Barry G have a bet on Man U, Barca and Chelsea all losing<br>tonight, and if so, what sort of odds you got ( a bajillion to one?)\"<br>This will sound like aftertiming but my only bet tonight is both teams<br>to score in this game at 6-4. Fingers crossed ...</p> <!-- Block 22 --> <p><strong>33 min</strong> Still Barcelona stick resolutely to plan A, but the<br>speed of their passing has increased. Celtic's formation is now very<br>much 5-4-1. Barcelona win another corner but Adriano's skidding shot<br>from 24 yards is saved at his near post by Forster.</p> <!-- Block 23 --> <p><strong>35 min</strong> Scott Brown pushes, barges, harries and annoys Messi -<br>all in the space of a few seconds - before conceding a foul. For all<br>their possession, Barcelona have created - what - three decent chances<br>so far?</p> <!-- Block 24 --> <p><strong> 37 min</strong> Again come the slow handclaps ... clap ... clap ...<br>clap ... as Messi lines up a free-kick, 25 yards out, central. Then -<br>for a millisecond - silence before a huge 'Oooooooooooooh' of<br>exhalation as Messi's free-kick hits the netting over the bar.</p> <!-- Block 25 --> <p><strong>38 min</strong> Samaras is hobbling here after rolling over his ankle.<br>Surely he can't continue here? Meanwhile this from Gordon Pittendrigh:<br>\"I'm a Celtic fan trying to remember to breathe here. Not sure whether<br>to watch rest of game or DVD of The Alamo.\"</p> <!-- Block 26 --> <p><strong>42 min</strong> With Samaras off, and James Forrest waiting to come on,<br>Barcelona keep the torture going against the 10-men but again it comes<br>to nothing.</p> <!-- Block 27 --> <p><strong>44 min</strong> Celtic sub: Forrest on, Samaras off. Celtic are<br>desperately hanging on for half-time here.</p> <!-- Block 28 --> <p><strong>GOAL! Barcelona 1-1 Celtic (Iniesta 45m)</strong> A wonderful, wonderful goal for Barcelona - five, six passes in a blink of an eye, with Xavi<br>and Iniesta key, before the later takes a throughball on the half-turn and slots it into the corner. That was everything Barcelona stand for, right there.</p> <!-- Block 29 --> <p><strong>Half-time</strong> Just before the referee's whistle, Messi dragged a half-chance wide. So it's 1-1 at half-time after a riveting first half. Meanwhile Colin Owens wrote this a few minutes ago: \"With Braga 2-0 ahead and Celtic 1-0 up I hastily deposited \u20ac10 into my Paddy Power account for a Barca/Utd double as I know too well that good things don't last!\" Looks like you might have a shot there, Colin ...</p> <!-- Block 30 --> <p><strong>46 min</strong> Barcelona get the second half underway. \"I'm not sure if its the same for everyone, but this MBM is appearing on my phone with lots of line breaks, giving it the appearance of blank verse,\" says Matt Dony. It lends a Shakespearean dignity and gravitas to Barca's dinky little sideways passes.\"</p> <!-- Block 31 --> <p><strong>48 min</strong> It's as you were: Barcelona continue to probe, particularly with the Alba-Alexis-Iniesta triangle down the left, while Celtic remain steadfast for now. The vistor's aim is to play the ball into Hooper and try to get runners off him. And it works there, as after five or six passes they win a free-kick in a dangerous. Mulgrew steps up ...</p> <!-- Block 32 --> <p><strong>49 min</strong> ... and crashes it against the wall, which was about five yards back. The follow up shot from Izaguirre balloons into the crowd.</p> <!-- Block 33 --> <p><strong>51 min</strong> Lovely twist-and-pass from Iniesta to Messi, who immediately brings the ball to heel before attempting a 9-iron over the 6ft 7in Forster. It doesn't miss by very much...</p> <!-- Block 34 --> <p><strong>53 min</strong> So close for Celtic! Barcelona can't defend set-pieces at all. Another flighty corner from Mulgrew spins violently across the six-yard box, flicking the head of two Celtic players before going wide. Neil Lennon, watching on the sidelines, has his head in his hands.</p> <!-- Block 35 --> <p><strong>56 min</strong> It's almost all Barcelona here. Forster has just saved a straightforward shot from Adriano. \"I can confirm that I'm not seeing any unusual formatting,\" says, er, Mister Justi. \"I'm currently on a Windows XP SP3 machine with Google Chrome version 22.0.1229.4m which is \"up to date\". Also I'm regionalized to Canada. I'll get my video driver details if you should like too.\" Hands up who fancies going to a party at Justi's house afterwards?</p> <!-- Block 36 --> <p><strong>59 min</strong> For a second there Celtic had a two-on-two but Victor Wanyama dallies and dillies and is tackled. Meanwhile Martin Mckeefry has some relationship advice for David Goldstone (28 min), who emailed in from his posh hotel near Las Ramblas.: \"If his idea of a romantic break even involves logging on to a computer, let alone a min-by-min report, then his marrage etc etc.\"</p> <!-- Block 37 --> <p><strong>60 min</strong> [Minute-by-minute reporter dons anorak] Possession<br>stats: Barcelona 73%-27% Celtic. They've had nearly 600 passes to<br>Celtic's 117.</p> <!-- Block 38 --> <p><strong>62 min</strong> Celtic sub: Commons on, Brown off. \"When you say 'as you were' with regards to Barcelona's insistent probing and general anal retentiveness as far as ball possession is concerned, is there a criticism there (implicit)?\" asks Ian Copestake, opening up a gigantic can of worms. \"Do do you take joy from it? Just curious.\" Personally I'm not one of those Barcelona-baiters. I love watching them play. But, yes, I would like them to mix it up a little bit more.</p> <!-- Block 39 --> <p><strong>64 min</strong> Another two-on-two for Celtic; another near-miss for Barcelona. Mascherano tries and fails to block off Commons down the touchline, but the Celtic sub is unable to find Hooper with his cross. Barcelona are still dominating here, mind ...</p> <!-- Block 40 --> <p><strong>66 min</strong> A half-paced Messi thruster squirms into Forster's arms. A minute later the keeper is called on again to save from Iniesta. The Celtic fans are in good voice singing - I think - Fields of Athenry, but their team is tiring.</p> <!-- Block 41 --> <p><strong>68 min</strong> And still it continues. The pressing, the waiting: tension, torture. \"Where was Song (Barca's only nominal holding midfielder) in that 2 v 2 Celtic counter-attack which Wanyama fluffed!?\" asks SB Tang. \"It was left to poor Xavi to hare back to support the two exposed Barca centre-backs. The man's got enough on his mind, what with his symphony orchestra conducting duties and all.\" Defensive duties have never been Song's strong point.</p> <!-- Block 42 --> <p><strong>69 min</strong> Save from Forster! Perhaps his best of the night - Alexis's cross, Messi sliding across the six-yard line (possibly offside), the Celtic keeper hurling his body in the way to block. They couldn't hang on here, could they?</p> <!-- Block 43 --> <p><strong>72 min</strong>Cynical from Mascherano, who realising his team are short at the back, chops down Forrest. That's a yellow card. This Barcelona defence, which is admittedly missing its first-choice centre-halves and Busquets to protect it, is as rickety as a very rickety rickshaw going over a very rickety bridge.</p> <!-- Block 44 --> <p><strong>73 min</strong> Barca! Barca! chant the fans. Another save from Forster. Meanwhile Dave Konopka emails in: \"I love how SB Tang apparently thinks that Song 'holds' or otherwise plays defense. As a loyal Arsenal fan, I can tell you with absolute certainty that three things will happen whenever Alexandre Song plays. 1) He will play at least one incredibly incisive pass. 2) He will never be in position to break up a counter-attack. 3) He will commit a lot of fouls. This is why Arsenal are playing better defensively after selling Song, even if Arteta is far from a prototypical defensive midfielder.\"</p> <!-- Block 45 --> <p><strong>75 min</strong> The biggest man on the pitch saves from the smallest! After more Barcelona passing, Iniesta plays a wonderful scooped lob into the unmarked Messi's path - the Argentine's header is palmed up in the air by Forster and bounces just wide of the post!</p> <!-- Block 46 --> <p><strong>76 mins</strong> Barcelona sub: Pedro off, Tello on. Celtic sub: Mulgrew off, Kayal on.</p> <!-- Block 47 --> <p><strong>78 min</strong> Yellow card Adriano for hacking down Ledley. \"Come on celtic u can do it!\" cries David Blackburn speaking, I suspect, for a great many of you.</p> <!-- Block 48 --> <p><strong>80 min</strong> Barcelona sub: Pedro off, Villa on. Can Celtic survive? The odds are about 50/50 they will according to Betfair ... and what a result it would be if they could.</p> <!-- Block 49 --> <p><strong>82 min</strong> Superb tackle from Ambrose, who takes the ball off the excellent Iniesta's feet. The corner, once again, comes to nothing - but from the resulting play Song is closing in on a header when Wangyama clears.</p> <!-- Block 50 --> <p><strong>84 min</strong> A delay in play - and plenty of whistles - as Wanyama goes down with cramp. Celtic will be down to 10 men for the time being while he is treated. Incidentally Xavi has made 148 passes so far, with a 92% success rate.</p> <!-- Block 51 --> <p><strong>85 min</strong> This is desperate, backs-to-the-wall stuff here, but<br>Celtic are hanging on. There's some lovely interplay between Villa and<br>Messi but Forster is alert to the danger. Meanwhile Wanyama is back on.</p> <!-- Block 52 --> <p><strong>87 min</strong> Xavi, uncharacteristically, screws a shot wide. Three minutes now. Can they hold on?</p> <!-- Block 53 --> <p><strong>88 min</strong> Celtic are playing with a back six here, but still they<br>survive. After a succession of taps, feints and short passes, Adriano<br>launches one into row Z. Then Alba, five yards from goal but on the<br>byline is tackled at the death. Celtic supporters are getting<br>boisterous now - they're singing \"Celtic we love you!\" Too soon?</p> <!-- Block 54 --> <p><strong>90 min</strong> Now Villa hits the post from about 15 yards after more<br>superb work from Iniesta. So close. Meanwhile Daniel Finucane writes:<br>\"Your explanation of Barca's shaky D was a tad rickety itself. Barca<br>are also missing their first-choice full backs, Alves and Abidal.\"<br>Fair point, Daniel.</p> <!-- Block 55 --> <p><strong>90+1 min</strong> We'll be having four minutes of injury time. Surely<br>there'll be one more Barcelona chance?</p> <!-- Block 56 --> <p><strong>90+2 min</strong> Huge cheers from the Celtic fans as Alexis allows a<br>pass to go out for a goal kick. Meanwhile Colin Owens writes: \"I've<br>never had a bet come good with a late winner! Please don't let it<br>happen to me tonight. If Barca nick it the winnings will lie heavy in<br>my pockets...btw Wanyama is immense. How can his brother have a<br>champions league medal and Victor plays Ross County for a living?\"</p> <!-- Block 57 --> <p><strong>GOAL! Barcelona 2-1 Celtic (Alba 90+3)</strong> No. No. No. No. No. In the very last minute, Alexis cross evades everyone before Alba at the back stick beats James Forrest and bundles it home. Barcelona deserve it based on possession and skill; Celtic don't based on their heart and desire and everything else they brought to this game.</p> <!-- Block 58 --> <p><strong>FULL-TIME</strong> \"That's the sound of a million breaking hearts,\"<br>suggests Matt Dony, not unreasonably. What an unexpected treat that<br>game was - and Celtic must be completely gutted. They applaud their<br>fans before trudging off, heads bowed. Still, they remain in second<br>place in the group and, with two home games to come, remain in the box<br>seat. Thanks for all your many emails and sorry I couldn't use them<br>all. Cheers, Sean.</p>",
  "<p>The report published today by HM Inspectorate of Prisons <a href=\"http://www.justice.gov.uk/downloads/publications/inspectorate-reports/hmipris/immigration-removal-centre-inspections/cedars/cedars-2012.pdf\" title=\"\">into the government's first \"family friendly\" detention facility for parents and children awaiting forced removal from the UK</a> is a mixed bag. The chief inspector of prisons, Nick Hardwick, describes the unit \u2013 Cedars, near Gatwick \u2013 as an \"exceptional facility\".</p> <p>But there is also plenty of criticism in his report. Hardwick highlights the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/oct/23/g4s-deportation-force-pregnant-woman\" title=\"\">unacceptable force used against a pregnant woman in a wheelchair</a> and flags up force used on six of 39 families placed in the facility. He adds that children became very distressed during removals, and says it was not possible to measure the psychological impact of that process on them. Incidents of self-harm along with shortcomings in healthcare and training were also pointed out.</p> <p>What this report does not do is address two of the continuing controversies surrounding the detention of children for immigration purposes. But its publication is a timely reminder that they are a long way from resolution.</p> <p>The first concerns the fact that the coalition government in general, and deputy prime minister Nick Clegg in particular, have maintained a consistent narrative that child detention has ended. The government's own data relating to numbers of children detained proves this is not true.</p> <p>The second is the continued and controversial involvement of the children's charity Barnardo's, which has a contract with government to staff the centre alongside G4S, the firm behind the Olympics security fiasco. G4S has been the subject of many allegations of assault by immigration detainees including <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/jimmy-mubenga\" title=\"\">Jimmy Mubenga</a>, who died during an attempt to remove him.</p> <p>The Lib Dems promised to end child detention <a href=\"http://network.libdems.org.uk/manifesto2010/libdem_manifesto_2010.pdf\" title=\"\">in their 2010 manifesto</a>, and they insist they have delivered on this objective. Clegg received much adulation from the organisation Citizens UK at his party's conference last month for \"ending\" child detention. Basking in their gratitude, Clegg said: \"We're not accustomed to being thanked for pledges we've kept.\"</p> <p>Yet the government's own figures show that the number of children they are detaining is on the rise. A total of 91 children were detained last year. In the first six months of this year 107 children were detained, 35 of them not in the \"family friendly\" Cedars but in ordinary immigration removal centres such as Tinsley House, near Gatwick. Clegg is engaging in a form of doublespeak. In the face of the statistical evidence from his own government, he continues to insist that child detention has ended.</p> <p>And what of Barnardo's, which attracted a flurry of controversy when it was announced that it would be working with UK Border Agency to help staff Cedars? The children's charity insisted that if certain \"red lines\" were crossed, it would walk away from the contract. The red lines include disproportionate use of force, use of Tinsley House as an overflow facility, and the detention of families more than twice. Hardwick stated that one family was detained three times, and several were detained twice, as well as describing the use of force on the pregnant woman as \"unacceptable\". Alison Worsley, Barnardo's deputy director of strategy, insists: \"We have always been clear that our involvement at Cedars does not stop&#xa0;us speaking out on behalf of asylum-seeking families. We raise any concerns with UKBA at the time that they arise at the appropriate level, from operations up to ministers, and have already spoken out twice publicly. Furthermore we will continue to call for improvements to the family returns process as a whole.\"</p> <p>The government insists that only families who have exhausted their appeal rights will end up in Cedars. Yet&#xa0;nine of the 39 families who have been detained there were released, suggesting that their appeals were not exhausted, and so they should not have been there in the first place.</p> <p>The government has tried extremely hard to convince us that child detention has ended, but this year's figures continue to creep upwards, compared with last year's. Those who are campaigning to end the detention of children say their work is not yet done. In the meantime Clegg and the organisations who champion him for ending child detention need to stick to the facts. The fixtures and fittings at Cedars are prettier than in the rest of the government's immigration removal estate, but Hardwick's report has highlighted some of the same concerns that existed about child detention in its previous incarnation in various immigration removal centres. If the government really wants to end child detention, it should stop detaining children.</p>",
  "<p>If Mitt Romney is elected president of the United States on 6 November \u2013 an outcome which is no longer the statistical implausibility it once was \u2013 then historians will say it was the October debate season, that turned it around.</p> <p>Before he came face to face with Barack Obama in Denver three weeks ago, Romney existed in much of the American public mind as a cartoonish figure, a comic-book plutocrat so rich his wife had two Cadillacs and his cars had an elevator of their own. Extravagantly out of touch, he was \"Mittens\", the pampered son of privilege who refused to come clean about his taxes and whose personal rate <a href=\"http://money.cnn.com/2012/09/21/pf/taxes/romney-tax-return/index.html\" title=\"\">turned out to be a measly 14%</a>. Ideologically, he was either unpalatably extreme \u2013 a \"severe conservative\" by his own description, whose message to America's undocumented immigrants was that they should \"self-deport\" \u2013 or an insincere flip-flopper who had reversed countless previous positions \u2013 first supporting, then opposing, abortion rights, for instance \u2013 to curry favour with the hardcore faithful who pick Republican presidential candidates.</p> <p>And he was useless to boot: clumsily embarking on a summer overseas tour that alienated a string of allies, including Britain, whose imminent Olympics he hinted would be a flop. As late as September his candidacy seemed doomed to failure. He had condemned himself out of his own mouth, thanks to a covert video of a fundraising speech in which he wrote off 47% of the American electorate as feckless parasites who would never vote for him anyway.</p> <p>The conventional wisdom deemed Romney perhaps the most inept nominee of a major party ever to seek the presidency. Obama was on course for a blowout, tipped to retake states that, when he won them in 2008, had seemed like an unrepeatable fluke.</p> <p>But that was before the debate season. Now that it's over, with Monday's encounter the last time the two men will clash directly, the landscape looks utterly different. Before the first debate on 3 October, the national poll average showed Obama consistently ahead, usually with a four-point cushion. Now Romney has a lead: tiny, but a lead.</p> <p>Obama's cheerleaders used to point to his \"firewall\", his advantage in the key nine or 11 swing states. But now the uber-pollster Nate Silver deems that firewall \"brittle\", Obama's previous edge in Florida, Colorado and Virginia steadily melting away. Today a different Romney has succeeded in lodging himself in the public imagination: sane, reasonable, even moderate.</p> <p>He seems energetic and capable, his experience in business no longer a liability \u2013 evoking questions about the vulture-like conduct of his private equity company, Bain Capital, along with his record of outsourcing American jobs \u2013 but an asset, a qualification for turning around the ailing enterprise that is USA, Inc.</p> <p>Monday's performance completed that new picture. Democrats had been painting Romney as the heir to George Bush, noting the hawks and <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/10/22/heilbrunn-neocons-idUSL1E8LMFS620121022\" title=\"\">neo-conservative outriders who form his circle of foreign policy advisers</a>. That left the Republican with a single task for a debate dedicated to international affairs: he needed to reassure the American people that he was no warmonger, out to reshape the world with US force, but a cool-headed realist. Accordingly, he lashed himself to his opponent, offering a me-too echo of Obama's foreign policy. He too would withdraw troops from Afghanistan by 2014. He too had no plans to intervene militarily in Syria. He too regarded war to halt a nuclear Iran as a \"last resort\". Why, the only differences were ones of style: he would show Vladimir Putin \"backbone\", rather than the \"flexibility\" Obama had promised. And he would never apologise for America, or say it had dictated to other nations. Instead he declared \u2013 in what was his best moment, one already spliced into a new TV commercial \u2013 \"Mr President, America has not dictated to other nations. We have freed other nations from dictators.\"</p> <p>Most neutrals gave the debate to Obama, either on points or more convincingly, who regularly exposed Romney's inconsistency on Afghanistan, Iraq and Iran \u2013 \"you've been all over the map\" \u2013 and used humour to devastating effect when he rebutted the Republican's lament that the US Navy had fewer ships now than at any time since 1917. Obama's reply: \"Governor, we also have fewer horses and bayonets, because the nature of our military's changed.\" But for Romney, none of that much mattered. He was not aiming for a win; he merely needed to avoid disaster. As David Frum, former speechwriter to Bush, tweeted: \"Romney reassured voters who fear he might be too hawkish; otherwise gave nobody reason to vote against him. Mission accomplished.\"</p> <p>That goes for the whole debate season. Romney needed to use October to transform himself from a near joke-figure into a plausible president \u2013 and he did. That's why Republicans like to recall Ronald Reagan in 1980. Early that autumn, too many voters regarded Reagan as unfit or too extreme to be president. But during the TV debates, Reagan laid their fears to rest. This autumn also began with the US electorate disappointed in the occupant of the Oval Office. But it first needed to be reassured that it was safe to vote for the alternative. Romney may have lost two out of the three debates but it doesn't matter \u2013 he did what he needed to do. Now a campaign that began nearly two years ago enters its final stretch. There will be no more grand set pieces, just the hard graft of on-the-ground organisation, as both parties sweat to get out their vote \u2013 with all eyes on one must-win state.</p> <p>\"It will all come down to Ohio,\" says one former Democratic strategist close to the Obama campaign. \"Both know it.

  "<p>A New York appeals court has ruled that lap dances are not an artistic performance and are therefore not exempt from state tax.</p> <p>A 4-3 ruling by New York's top court determined that Nite Moves strip club must pay a $124,000 bill for not paying proper sales tax on club admission and private dances. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/us-news-blog/2012/sep/05/new-york-strip-club-art-tax\">The Albany strip club claimed</a> they did not owe the state tax because the strip club is \"a place of amusement featuring dramatic or musical arts performances\".</p> <p><a href=\"http://blog.timesunion.com/capitol/archives/161585/court-of-appeals-decides-4-3-lap-dances-can-be-taxed/\">In the majority opinion</a>, judges said it would be irrational for the tax tribunal to exempt every act that is considered a dance performance. </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>If ice shows presenting pairs ice dancing performances, with intricately choreographed dance moves precisely arranged to musical compositions, were not viewed by the Legislature as \"dance\" entitled a tax exemption, surely it was not irrational for the Tax Tribunal to conclude that a club presenting performances by women gyrating on a pole to music, however artistic or athletic their practiced moves are, was also not a qualifying performance entitled to exempt status.</p> </blockquote> <p>Judge Robert Smith said in a dissent that the majority opinion \"raises significant constitutional problems\" because it makes a distinction between lowbrow and highbrow dance. </p> <p>\"It does not matter if the dance was artistic or crude, boring or erotic,\" said Smith. \"Under New York's tax law, a dance is a dance.\"</p> <p>Smith also clarified that his dissent is for constitutional reasons. </p> <p>\"Like the majority and the Tribunal, I find this particular form of dance unedifying \u2013 indeed, I am stuffy enough to find it distasteful,\" said Smith. \"Perhaps for similar reasons, I do not read Hustler magazine; I would rather read the New Yorker.\"</p> <p>A 2005 audit by by the state department of taxation and finance determined that Nite Moves must pay $124,000. The strip club then took the case to court, arguing the dances should be tax-exempt because some of the dancers are trained in ballet, jazz and gymnastics. </p> <p>In the petitioner's brief, Nite Moves' lawyer W Andrew McCullough also argued that the strip club is comparable to a theater because it has dressing rooms, ushers and a wait staff. </p> <p>Nite Moves is different from most strip clubs because it does not sell alcoholic drinks and therefore is held to different standards of tax-exemption. </p> <p>An administrative court judge initially ruled in favor of Nite Moves and said: \"The fact that the dancers remove all or part of their costume \u2026 simply does not render such dance routines as something less than choreographed performances.\"</p> <p>A New York tax appeal tribunal opposed the ruling saying their was not enough proof that the strip club should be exempt from taxes. The New York court of appeals agreed to hear the case last year.</p>",
  "<p>Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani is used to basking in the limelight. But when the emir of Qatar arrived in Gaza on Tuesday \u2013 the first Arab leader in years to visit the impoverished coastal strip \u2013 he was hailed for breaking its siege, demonstrating his country's huge and growing influence in the Middle East.</p> <p>Palestinians rolled out the red carpet for the emir as his black Mercedes bumped along a rutted main road that he has promised to rebuild, past white and maroon Qatari flags, the song Thank&#xa0;You, Qatar playing endlessly on&#xa0;local radio and TV.</p> <p>Sheikh Hamad flew to Egypt and crossed the border into Gaza, a move billed as breaking the blockade in force since the Islamists of Hamas took power in 2007. It also underlined the ability of the tiny, fabulously rich Gulf state to punch above its weight internationally.</p> <p>He arrived with 90 tonnes of aid and pledged $400m (\u00a3250m) to invest in housing and infrastructure to replace property damaged in the 2008-09 war with Israel.</p> <p>Flanked by his wife, the elegant and high-profile Sheikha Mozah, he spoke to a large crowd at Gaza's Islamic University, the biggest event of a six-hour stay.</p> <p>The last head of state to visit the strip was King Abdullah of Jordan, who went there in 1999 for talks with then Palestinian president, Yasser Arafat.</p> <p>Predictably, the brief royal visit was the top news item on al-Jazeera, the satellite TV channel owned by the emir's family and which has been an unabashed and influential cheerleader for the uprisings of the Arab spring from Tunisia to Syria.</p> <p>Qatar's ambitious move was a stunning boost for Hamas, shunned by Israel, the US and western countries as a terrorist organisation. Ismail Haniyeh, its deposed prime minister, called it a historic event that had broken the \"unjust blockade\".</p> <p>\"The visit gives Hamas legitimacy in the Arab world and internationally,\" said Mkhaimar Abusada, an independent analyst at Gaza's al-Azhar university. It was further striking evidence that Qatar, whose per-capita income is now the highest in the world, is in effect using its enormous oil and gas riches and close ties to Islamist organisations to expand its regional influence in the wake of its involvement in the uprisings against Libya's Muammar Gaddafi and Bashar al-Assad in Syria.</p> <p>\"The emir is confirming that Qatar is the principal supporter of the Muslim Brotherhood takeover in Egypt and everywhere else,\" said Ahmed Asfahani, the respected al-Hayat newspaper columnist. \"Qatar is using the Brotherhood to promote its own interests. It also shows that Qatar is trying to replace Iran as a major player on the Palestinian issue.\"</p> <p>Observers in the region also see the visit in part as a reward to Hamas for ending its support for Assad. Until a few months ago, the movement's exiled leadership was based in Damascus, helping bolster Syria's credentials as a key member of the \"axis of resistance\" confronting Israel, along with Iran and Hezbollah in Lebanon.</p> <p>But its veteran leader, Khalid Mish'al, decamped to Doha. And Haniyeh came out in open support of the right of the Syrian people to oppose Assad.</p> <p>Mahmoud Abbas, the western-backed Palestinian president and leader of Fatah, had let it be known from his headquarters in the West Bank town of Ramallah that he was furious about the visit, which plays into the hands of his bitterest rival. \"Nobody's happy about it,\" said one Palestinian source. \"It definitely makes a statement. And of course there is a track record of Arab regimes playing into intra-Palestinian politics.\"</p> <p>The PLO welcomed any help with reconstruction in Gaza, but called on \"all Arab brethren to \u2026 use their leverage to ensure an end to the division and the policy of creating a separatist entity in the Gaza Strip, as [this] principally serves the Israeli agenda.\" There is also an unspoken fear of eroding the claim of Abbas's Palestinian Authority to be the sole representative of the Palestinians.</p> <p>Israel angrily condemned the Qatari visit as well. \"We find it weird that the emir doesn't support all of the Palestinians but sides with Hamas over the Palestinian Authority [in the West Bank] which he has never visited,\" said its foreign ministry spokesman, Yigal Palmor. \"The emir has chosen his camp and it is not good.\"</p> <p>In the background, it is possible to discern a new pattern of relations emerging in a political landscape transformed by the Arab spring in which a key player is the Egyptian president, Mohamed Morsi, a leader of the Muslim Brotherhood.</p> <p>In the era of Hosni Mubarak, Qatar was often at loggerheads with Egypt, which, like many other Arab governments, hated al-Jazeera and saw it as a disruptive instrument of Qatari policy. Even now, Doha is being more radical than Cairo. Formally, Egypt considers Abbas as the representative of Palestinians and Gaza as under PA authority (or that the end state of Palestinian reconciliation should be a West Bank and Gaza united under PA control). The emir called publicly for efforts to promote reconciliation between the Palestinian rivals to confront Israel. \"It will be interesting to see if Qatar is now going to play a more active role in mediating between Hamas and Fatah, or even Hamas and Israel,\" said Abusada.</p> <p>Doha has won admiration and irritation in equal measure in the Middle East and beyond. Uniquely, it maintains cordial, if low-key, relations with Israel as well as Iran, hated by other Gulf Arabs. It is also home to a large US air base. Its wealth speaks eloquently. In September, it announced plans to invest $18bn over five years in Egypt. Its aid also helped reconstruction in south Lebanon after the 2006 war between Hezbollah and Israel. At that time, the emir worked closely with Assad, only to turn against him when the Syrian uprising began 19 months ago. In Libya last year, Qatar bankrolled the anti-Gaddafi rebels but channelled resources through Islamist brigades only to face criticism later that it was behaving in a manipulative manner. Now Qatar has become a key supporter of the armed Syrian opposition, amid growing concern in the west that the weapons it pays for are reaching jihadi-type groups rather than democratic forces.</p> <p>Among its other accomplishments, Qatar is to host the 2022 World Cup, having defeated bidders including the US and Japan. Following intense lobbying it also recently managed to join La Francophonie \u2013 the 57-member bloc of French-speaking nations \u2013 as an associate member. French is barely spoken in Qatar but it insists it is committed to promoting use of the language.</p>",
  "<p>One could have been forgiven for assuming that, in the course of four and a half hours of combined presidential debates, all policy bases would have been covered.</p> <p>Big Bird, binders full of women and battleships all featured, after all. </p> <p>But a surprising number of major issues failed to warrant a mention in any of the three head-to-heads. Here's a guide to what was not discussed \u2013 and the candidates' stances on the forgotten topics.</p> <h2>Gay rights</h2> <p>Despite Obama making a high-profile U-turn on the issue of gay marriage just months ago, the topic of same-sex unions didn't get a look in. The closest Obama got to an attack was a snide jab at Romney getting his social policies from the \"1950s\".</p> <p><strong>Where they stand:</strong></p> <p><strong>Obama:</strong> Has pushed through a progressive agenda in terms of gay rights, having jettisoned the \"don't ask don't tell\" policy of previous administrations. His conversion to being pro same-sex marriage has been welcomed by the LGBT community, as has his direction to government bodies not to defend the Defence of Marriage Act (Doma) in the courts.</p> <p><strong>Romney:</strong> His agenda of gay rights has been built on shifting sands over the years. In the mid-1990s he told Log Cabin Republicans that he supported \"full equality for America's gay and lesbian citizens\". But he has veered towards social conservatism over the last year, repeatedly asserting his belief that \"marriage is between a man and a woman\". He has said he will defend Doma.</p> <h2>War on drugs</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398247924\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/3/1349292779789/marijuana-medical-angeles-006.jpg\" alt=\"marijuana medical angeles\" width=\"220\" height=\"132\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Los Angeles city council opted to reverse the ban rather than face an expensive and possibly doomed referendum fight.

Obama has also come out against legalisation. He did, however, bring in legislation to reduce the disparity between sentences given to those caught with crack cocaine, compared to users of powder cocaine. He has also diverted more funds to prevention and treatment programmes.</p> <p><strong>Romney: </strong>Likewise anti-legalisation, Romney blames demand in the US for the cross-border violence in Mexico. In a recent forum organised by the Univision TV Network, the Republican reportedly said that the US president has to make \"a priority of reducing demand in this country and communicating to our young people, and older people, that when they use these illegal drugs, they are contributing to the deaths of people around the world\".</p> <h2>Climate change</h2> <p>In the course of the presidential debates, the topics of gas prices and energy independence came up. But neither candidate turned the issue around to green energy <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/oct/23/us-president-debates-climate-change\">and the issue of climate change.</a></p> <p><strong>Where they stand:</strong></p> <p><strong>Obama:</strong> Has pledged to reduce emissions which cause global warming and hit out at sceptics, warning at the Democratic national convention: \"Climate change is not a hoax.\" Obama has also pumped money into the green sector through government grants and loans.</p> <p><strong>Romney: </strong>Has called for the phasing out of subsidies for the wind industry and has mocked Obama for wanting to help \"heal the planet\". Although not an outright denier, Romney has said that we \"do not know what's causing climate change on this planet\".</p> <h2>Domestic surveillance</h2> <p>Discussion on homeland security during the first debate failed to nail the candidates on creeping surveillance of US citizens.</p> <p><strong>Where they stand:</strong></p> <p><strong>Obama:</strong> According to the American Civil Liberties Union there has been a 60% increase in electronic surveillance under Obama's watch. He also extended the controversial patriot act, with authorises the wiretapping of US and non-US citizens.</p> <p><strong>Romney:</strong> Has said that he supports the patriot act. Meanwhile as governor of Massachusetts <a href=\"http://www.boston.com/news/local/articles/2005/09/15/wiretap_mosques_romney_suggests/\">he advocated the wiretapping of mosques</a> and carrying out surveillance on foreign students. </p> <h2>Housing</h2> <p>With the economy very much central in the election campaign, it is surprising that some of the main victims of the recession \u2013 homeowners left underwater by falling house prices and those foreclosed on \u2013 didn't get a look in.</p> <p><strong>Where they stand:</strong></p> <p><strong>Obama:</strong> Has introduced legislation that has helped millions of struggling homeowners, but not as many as he would have hoped. The home affordable modification programme has helped an estimated 1 million families refinance their home loans, but it's goal was to help up to 4 million. </p> <p><strong>Romney:</strong> Has criticised attempts to interfere with the housing market. Indeed his free-market approach appears to extend to giving no help to those facing repossession. \"Don't try to stop the foreclosure process. Let it run its course and hit the bottom,\" <a href=\"http://2012.talkingpointsmemo.com/2011/10/romney-dont-try-and-stop-the-foreclosure-process-video.php\">he said in reference to housing</a>. </p> <h2>Abortion</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398247925\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/29/1346274868810/abortion-colorado-personh-006.jpg\" alt=\"abortion colorado personhood\" width=\"220\" height=\"132\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pro-life activists march in Washington on the anniversary of Roe V Wade.

  "<h2><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/heather-hurlburt\">Heather Hurlburt</a>: 'Obama scored zinger after zinger'</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398245557\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Global/content/icons/2011/10/11/1318360150849/heatherhurlburt_140x140.jpg\" alt=\"Heather Hurlburt\" width=\"140\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>We heard a lot of talk right after Monday's foreign policy debate about Mitt Romney passing or not passing the \"commander-in-chief test\". That may sound as if it means: can the public imagine him bayoneting Syrian President Assad while riding a horse, or ordering a military strike against Iran. But in the last weeks of a campaign, it means something much more specific.</p> <p>Romney has had either 18 months or five years, depending how you're counting, to introduce his commander-in-chief bona fides to the full range of American voters. In the final weeks of a close race, his task was a different one: convincing undecided and middle-of-the road voters, who seem, this cycle, to be disproportionately women, that he is a likeable, moderate guy with solutions to the problems they face.</p> <p>As I have <a href=\"http://www.usnews.com/opinion/blogs/world-report/2012/10/22/dont-assume-women-dont-care-about-national-security\">written elsewhere</a>, polling continues to find that women are less receptive to violence and conflict-based solutions to problems than men. They \u2013 as well as moderates \u2013 disproportionately prefer Obama's approach to national security policy. This is <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/10/22/presidential-debate-reactions-2012-twitter-women-foreign-policy_n_2002996.html\">why</a> \"last night's\" Mitt Romney used the word \"peace\" so many times, and was so anxious to agree with President Obama's plans to remove US troops from Afghanistan, refuse to send US troops to Syria and intervene militarily in Iran only as a last resort.</p> <p>But for this to work, Romney had to do more than hug Obama on substance and find smart-sounding attack lines. He needed to come up with positive alternatives: what <em>is</em> the Middle East policy that will get rid of the murderous Assad, convince Israelis and Palestinians to come to terms and provoke the Arab streets to love us? What should the next administration do about the magical opportunity he invoked in Latin America? What tools are there he can deploy that Obama does not have to convince Iran to drop its nuclear program?</p> <p>Commentators \u2013 and not just Democrats \u2013 have been hitting Romney on his lack of substance, since the spring. Bill Kristol, Peggy Noonan, Colin Powell, Danielle Pletka have all at various times suggested that his vague positions lacked seriousness. \"Think, Mitt,\" Powell <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2012/05/colin-powell-to-romney-on-foreign-policy-come-on-mitt-think/257578/\">pleaded</a> after the \"Russia No 1 geopolitical foe\" comment.</p> <p>Romney had a run of misfortunes with his foreign policy outings: missteps on his Europe and Israel trip, <a href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2012/10/romney-speech-vmi-emails\">criticism</a> over politicization of the VMI speech venue, <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/09/06/mitt-romney-afghanistan_n_1862533.html\">omission</a> of Afghanistan and veterans from his convention speech. So, to come off seriously and successfully as a moderate, he needed to shut down Obama's critique of him.</p> <p>And here he failed. Obama scored zinger after zinger: a decade wants its military policy back \u2013 a military of cavalry and bayonets, and on and on. Effective responses were few and far between, which meant Romney was allowing Obama to fire up his own base and sow doubts in Romney's target audience.</p> <p>The insta-polls last night, whatever they may say about the race itself, reflected Romney's failure to move from a candidate with a critique to a leader with bullet-proof, or at least quip-proof, policy alternatives.</p> <p>The polls showed it; the dial-tests showed it; the pundit analyses showed it. Romney made a full run at Obama's dominance on national security, and didn't shake it. It remains to be seen how profound this impact is on the race, but the conventional wisdom about the politics of American national security, marked for three decades by progressives' fear of conservative dominance and mockery, will never be the same.</p> <p><em>Heather Hurlburt is executive director of the National Security Network</em></p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/jamesantle\">James Antle</a>: 'Romney tried to distance himself from George Bush'</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398245558\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2008/06/02/james_antle_140x140.jpg\" alt=\"James Antle\" width=\"140\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Both candidates were broadly in favor of a US foreign policy that includes or permits preventive war, drone attacks, untrammeled executive surveillance powers and \"crippling sanctions\" against Iran.</p> <p>Both insisted no option was off the table in dealing with Iran, a threat they both described in the same terms. Both supported regime change in Libya by US arms and in Egypt \u2013 though in the latter case, they would leave it up to the Egyptians themselves.</p> <p>Neither was specific about what kind of \"help\" they had in mind for Syrian rebels. Neither was willing to admit their policies might lead to direct American military involvement in the places where they were intervening.</p> <p>The only time the exchange between President Barack Obama and Republican challenger Mitt Romney genuinely resembled a debate was when it veered off-topic, tackling subjects ranging from tax cuts to school classroom sizes.</p> <p>Romney uttered cliches about his opponent apologizing for America, while Obama pretended that his successful raid against Osama bin Laden was representative of his track record against al-Qaida more generally.</p> <p>The most interesting aspect of the debate was Romney trying to distance himself from George W Bush, explicitly saying the country didn't need another Iraq or Afghanistan war.</p> <p>The second most interesting was the level of mockery and sarcasm employed by Obama \u2013 he once reminded Romney that the military budget wasn't a game of battleship \u2013 which was unusual for an incumbent president. Perhaps Obama's most effective line, though, was when <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2012/10/third_presidential_debate_the_foreign_policy_argument_between_barack_obama.html\">he said Romney would</a> \"do the same things we did, but you'd say them louder and somehow that will make a difference.\"</p> <p>It stung because it seemed true.</p> <p>Romney tried to be agreeable and avoid looking like a warmonger. Obama was aggressive and looked somewhat like he thought he was running from behind.</p> <p>Obama edged out Romney in the second and third debates, but Romney scored a decisive victory in the first. In the end, it appears that Romney has been the net beneficiary, turning this into a competitive race once again. <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-250_162-57536261/polls-gallup-still-has-romney-up-marist-shows-obama-leads-in-two-swing-states/\">Gallup has the former Massachusetts governor ahead</a>, most swing state polls still suggest the president is the frontrunner. </p> <p>But there's no debating, it's close.</p> <p><em>James Antle is editor of the Daily Caller News Foundation and a senior editor at the American Spectator</em></p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/alex-slater\">Alex Slater</a>: 'If anyone took the Bush mantle, it was Obama'</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398245559\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Global/content/icons/2010/9/20/1284991083547/alexslater_140x140.jpg\" alt=\"Alex Slater\" width=\"140\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>America was deprived of a \"rock 'em, sock 'em\" third presidential debate this election season. Instead, what undecided voters in swing states got last night was a meandering, sometimes slightly argumentative, but largely somniferous discussion between two candidates more interested in mild personal attacks than in substantive foreign policy.</p> <p>Yes, Obama won the debate: <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/POLITICS/pollingcenter/polls/3287\">48% of a scientifically conducted poll with CNN </a>voters confirmed the president's victory, but only by a relatively small margin. Indeed, 40% believed Governor Romney to be the victor. In an ever-tightening race, this should give Democrats pause.</p> <p>Romney's performance was nuanced to a fault. Clearly, his staff had tattooed the words \"do no harm\" on his arm before he stepped on stage. And clearly, the governor paid attention. Conscious of <a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2012/10/15/swing-states-poll-women-voters-romney-obama/1634791/\">the tightening polls among female voters</a>, Romney had obviously been briefed to be non-aggressive, to avoid the mantle of warmonger \u2013 in short, to avoid becoming the third rail of American politics: the bumbling, warmongering President George W Bush.</p> <p>But that also exposed him to appear weak, a \"yes man\" to Obama's four-year record in office. Indeed, as Mara Liasson, journalist for NPR, pointed out only minutes after the debate, Romney's most uttered words seemed to be \"I agree\".</p> <p>The president, on the other hand, apart from inexplicably having been told to stare at the governor in what can only be described as a creepy glare, was in a feistier mood. For months now, his campaign has steadily avoided the \"go-to\" political tactic in the American political narrative: painting your opponent as a flip-flopper, undecided and vacillating on issues.</p> <p>That restraint was gone last night, as the president repeatedly delivered attack after attack on Romney's inconsistent record, from troops in Iraq to the surge in Afghanistan. In fact, if anyone took the Bush mantle, it was Obama repeating almost word for word parts of President Bush's second convention speech:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"I will never shy away from defending America.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>So, where does this leave the campaign in these closing weeks? Yes, Obama won tonight, but these debates have been lackluster at best. On the whole, the three match-ups can likely be called an overall draw, with the first debate propelling what the press is now calling \"Mittmentum\". Nevertheless, the political calculus remains firmly in the president's favor, with Ohio \u2013 this election's pivotal state \u2013 looking likely to swing Obama's way.</p> <p>If that happens, political scientists across the country will be forced to return to the age-old \u2013 and still unresolved \u2013 question, \"Do debates really matter?\" And last night, here in Boca, that seemed doubtful at best.</p> <p><em>Alex Slater is a Democratic strategist and principal of the political consultancy Clyde Strategies</em></p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/markweisbrot\">Mark Weisbrot</a>: 'It was a victory just to have drones mentioned'</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398245560\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2010/10/28/1288281260427/weisbrot.jpg\" alt=\"Mark Weisbrot\" width=\"140\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mark Weisbrot</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: guardian.co.uk</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The presidential debate on foreign policy is always a painful and disgusting spectacle for any reality-based viewer.</p> <p>Both candidates play into the fantasy that the United States needs to spend more on its military than most of the world combined, because we face grave threats when the rest of the world knows that US foreign and military policy is all about power and empire.

Romney's assertion that he wants to make \"pariahs\" of Iranian diplomats reflects a substantive difference \u2013 that he is less likely to seek a negotiated solution and more likely to start another disastrous war.

The existence of the program is officially classified, and the Obama administration does not publicly acknowledge it, so it was something of a victory just to have it mentioned.</p> <p>On the technical side, Obama was combative and did very well, as he did in the second debate. If he loses this election \u2013 which is not likely, but still possible \u2013 it will be due to his failure to confront Romney on an issue that is most important to senior citizens, the only age group where he is losing.</p> <p>That issue is social security. <a href=\"http://www.mittromney.com/issues/social-security\">Both Romney and his party</a> are on the record in favor of cuts to social security, but Obama from the first debate has <a href=\"http://truth-out.org/opinion/item/11991-social-security-president-obamas-biggest-failure-in-last-weeks-debate\">pretended</a> that there is no difference on this issue.

How refreshing.</p> <p>On the campaign trail, Romney has evoked the bluster and relentless chest-thumping of President Bush. But last night, Romney conveyed an attitude of humility that many war-weary Americans are desperate to hear. In his early opening salvo, he congratulated President Obama for \"taking out Osama bin Laden,\" and added: </p> <blockquote> <p>\"But we can't kill our way out of this mess.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Indeed, while going after al-Qaida is the right policy, meeting that challenge only militarily won't resolve the underlying political circumstances that give rise to terrorism.</p> <p>In another extraordinary turn, Romney said on the subject of getting the Muslim world to reject extremism that \"[w]e don't want another Iraq, we don't want another Afghanistan\". Perhaps Romney's realist handlers \u2013 those who want him to win the presidency \u2013 have finally gotten to him: <a href=\"http://tinyurl.com/9ryfw2v\">polls show overwhelmingly that Americans think the Iraq war was a mistake</a>, and America paid an enormous price in blood and treasure for an Iraq under considerable Iranian influence. Even <a href=\"http://tinyurl.com/8kubbv6\">many in the GOP</a> have turned against America's endless wars of nation-building in Iraq and Afghanistan.</p> <p>The governor was vague and evasive at times, perhaps to obscure the fact that his substantive differences with Obama were minimal and mainly semantic. For instance, on Syria, Romney's policy is no different than the incumbent's. He advocates helping the opposition by working with America's partners; finding responsible parties and rebels and arming them; working for the creation of a responsible government to replace Bashir al-Assad; and not getting drawn into a military conflict by injecting neither American troops nor a no-fly zone.</p> <p>On military spending, Romney came across as disjointed and contradictory. After all, if a President Romney intends to spend 4% of America's GDP on the military \u2013 an increase of $2tn over the next ten years \u2013 then how will his administration pay for that and close the budget deficit?</p> <p>Part of the problem is that Romney's vision appears to be driven by capabilities and tactics (incremental policies to achieve short-term objectives) rather than a clearly articulated strategy (a broad sense of guidance for our actions and decisions). Worse, both Romney and Obama embrace some of the same hawkish and meddlesome national security and surveillance policies adopted under President Bush. In that respect, President Obama's predecessor \u2013 and the pro-interventionist foreign policy establishment in Washington \u2013 was the debate's clear winner.</p> <p>For all of these flaws, though, Governor Romney's shift was still remarkable. Juxtaposed with his previous invocations of the American people watching the world and \"shaping events\", or having \"confidence in our cause\" and \"resolve in our might\", he appears to have realized Americans are tired after enduring the human and financial costs of two prolonged and deeply unpopular wars. At last, the Romney campaign has adopted a tone of moderation in the final weeks before the election.</p> <p><em>Malou Innocent is a foreign policy analyst at the Cato Institute</em></p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/jim-geraghty\">Jim Geraghty</a>: 'Some will find the president's diatribe unattractively sarcastic'</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398245562\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Global/content/icons/2012/1/11/1326298456752/jimgeraghty_140x140.jpg\" alt=\"Jim Geraghty\" width=\"140\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>In a perfect world, candidates would come to a foreign policy debate with great knowledge, recognition of the complications and difficulties in making the world a better place, and a humility about their ability to foresee events in a rapidly-changing world. Both candidates would recall that President George W Bush campaigned on a pledge for a humble foreign policy in 2000, and President Obama would recognize that promises such as closing Guant\u00e1namo Bay turned out to be much harder to keep than he expected. </p> <p>Around the globe, promises are easier to make than keep. Every presidential challenger paints the incumbent as soft on China; once in office, the economic intertwining of the US and China, and Washington's quite limited ability to influence the decision-making in Beijing, become clearer. For <a href=\"http://www.nationalreview.com/campaign-spot/316070/bill-clinton-still-talking\">four straight cycles</a>, Bill Clinton and George W Bush pledged to move the US embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem; for 16 years, those promises were perpetually delayed. (Of course, this year the issue briefly returned again, as Democrats had a floor fight over a declaration that Jerusalem is the capital of Israel.)</p> <p>Unfortunately, last night's debate occurred in a far from perfect world. Voters aren't thinking about foreign policy right now, and both candidates knew it. There aren't that many undecided voters left, and those that are may not have been watching. The debate was up against Monday Night Football and the seventh game of the baseball playoffs, suggesting viewership would be lower than the preceding two presidential debates.</p> <p>To the extent undecided voters think about foreign policy at all, they're quasi-isolationist and poorly informed. The last thing they want to hear is that the world is complicated, or that the US can't tell other countries to go pound sand.</p> <p>Finally, while Bob Schieffer seemed to hit the right balance of tough questions without frequent interruptions, the topics were heavily focused on the Middle East. In 90 minutes of debate, there was no discussion of the European Union, its currency and debt crises, and what that could mean for the US economy. No mention of violence on our southern border with Mexico; no mention of India.</p> <p>Mitt Romney and Barack Obama went into Monday night with dramatically different strategies. The president seemed to think he needed a knockout blow and his base undoubtedly believes he landed one after another, while some will find the president's \"horses and bayonets\" and Battleship diatribe remarkably condescending and unattractively sarcastic (the Democratic base undoubtedly believes Mitt Romney is a joke and deserves to be treated as such). The independents and folks who climbed onto the Romney bandwagon since the first debate are unlikely to be persuaded by this sneer, however.</p> <p>Romney, on the other hand, aimed to look presidential. The result was a remarkably uncombative debate performance. It seems he believed Obama's last big card to play was that Romney would be a duplicate of George W Bush on issues of war and peace, and so he disarmed it by declaring early on, \"we can't kill our way out of this mess.\"</p> <p>The word \"peace\" was used 12 times last night; it was spoken by Romney every time. It was a sales pitch to a war-weary nation \u2013 likely to be effective, even if the next four years are rather unlikely to see any genuine, lasting peace.</p> <p><em>Jim Geraghty is a contributing editor to the National Review and writes the Campaign Spot blog</em></p>",
  "<p>Alex Salmond has been accused of misleading voters about the legal advice given to his government about the right of an independent Scotland to join the European Union.</p> <p>The first minister has repeatedly said that Scotland would be an automatic member of the EU, be free to adopt sterling as its currency and would inherit all the UK's opt-outs on EU immigration and border controls. He has asserted that this position was supported by his government's legal advice.</p> <p>But Salmond was forced to make a statement to the Scottish parliament late on Tuesday after opposition leaders accused him of \"lying\" and \"covering-up\" following an admission from his deputy, Nicola Sturgeon, that no specific legal advice had been given by Scottish law officers on EU membership.</p> <p>His critics highlighted an <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1pt-zOnU9c\" title=\"\">interview by Salmond with Andrew Neil on BBC1's Sunday Politics earlier this year</a> in which the first minister said he had been given clear legal advice by Scottish law officers. Asked by Neil whether he had sought advice from the Scottish government's own law officers on membership of the EU, Salmond replied: \"We have, yes, in terms of the debate.\"</p> <p>Asked what that advice said, Salmond responded: \"Well, you know I can't give you the legal advice or reveal the legal advice of law officers, but what you can say is that everything we publish is consistent with the legal advice we have received.\"</p> <p>But in an unexpected disclosure to the Scottish parliament, which capped an already difficult day for Salmond after <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/oct/23/msps-resign-snp-nato-stance\" title=\"\">two SNP backbenchers resigned over Nato</a>, Sturgeon revealed that the Scottish government had only sought legal advice from its law officers in the last week.</p> <p>The Scottish government was due to appear at a two-day hearing in Scotland's highest civil court in December in an attempt to overturn a historic ruling by Rosemary Agnew, the Scottish information commissioner, that this legal advice should be published in the public interest. However, this court action \u2013 which has so far cost nearly \u00a312,000 in legal expenses \u2013will now be dropped, Sturgeon said. \"I can confirm that the government has now commissioned specific legal advice from our law officers on the position of Scotland within the EU if independence is achieved,\" she said. \"[The] Scottish government had previously cited opinions from a number of eminent legal authorities, past and present [but] has not sought specific legal advice.\" She also suggested that getting legal advice was only possible now that Salmond and David Cameron, the prime minister, had signed the \"Edinburgh agreement\" to legally establish the independence referendum.</p> <p>She told MSPs that ministers had only recently requested that advice from its chief law officer, Frank Mulholland, the lord advocate, provoking audible gasps from opposition benches.</p> <p>In a brief statement to MSPs, Salmond denied misleading voters but again said every Scottish government statement and policy paper on EU membership had drawn on its own legal advice, appearing to contradict Sturgeon's earlier statement. He said he was talking about \"general advice\", adding: \"All of these documents are underpinned by legal advice by our own law officers. They have to be. That is the reality.\"</p> <p>Many legal experts argue that an independent Scotland would have to reapply as a new state, a view that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/sep/12/barroso-doubt-scotland-eu-membership\" title=\"\">appeared to be supported by the European commission's president, Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso, last month</a>, leading to suggestions it must then join the euro.</p> <p>Paul Martin MSP, Scottish Labour's business manager, said: \"It appears the first minister is a liar and used taxpayers' money to try to cover up his lies. [Alex] Salmond has started the debate on Scotland's future within the UK with barefaced lies that even embarrass his deputy.\"</p> <p>Catherine Stihler, the Labour MEP for Scotland whose first freedom of information request led to Salmond's legal challenge, said: \"When I attended the court of session in September the Scottish government must have known that their legal advice was just a blank sheet of paper. Thousands of pounds later and now we are told they are seeking legal advice. You couldn't make it up; it's lies, lies and more damned lies.\"</p> <p>Alistair Darling, chairman of the pro-UK Better Together campaign, said the disclosure undermined the Scottish government's stance on EU membership, which contracted other legal opinions that Scotland would have to reapply to join the EU, may be forced to use the euro, and adopt the Schengen agreement on border controls.</p> <p>\"This strikes at the heart of Alex Salmond's credibility,\" Darling said.</p> <p>Ruth Davidson, the Scottish Tory leader, stopped short of accusing Salmond of lying, but said: \"This has been a cabinet cover-up right from the beginning, using taxpayers' money to try and hoodwink the Scottish people. This is conduct unbecoming of a first minister and his government and exposes the depths to which they will sink to realise their independence dream.\"</p> <p>The controversy added to what was already a difficult day for Salmond, which saw his overall majority at Holyrood reduced to two seats.</p> <p>Earlier on Tuesday, two rebel MSPs Jean Urquhart and John Finnie, resigned from the party in protest at an SNP conference vote at the weekend to join the nuclear-armed military alliance Nato.</p> <p>Finnie, a former police officer who joined the SNP at 16 and has been an open critic of other Scottish government policies, said: \"I cannot belong to a party that quite rightly does not wish to hold nuclear weapons on its soil, but wants to join a first-strike nuclear alliance.\"</p> <p>It also emerged on Tuesday that a long-delayed Scottish government consultation on its independence referendum, which received 26,000 responses, had found widespread and at times heavy opposition to some of Salmond's key proposals for the referendum \u2013 particularly his desire for a two-question poll.</p> <p>The document, published by Sturgeon, disclosed that 59% of respondents did not want a two-question referendum which included an option to vote for greater devolution \u2013 one of Salmond's main objectives. A two-option poll was only backed by 25%.</p> <p>It found that 53% of respondents supported votes for 16- and 17-year-olds but once \"standard campaigns\" were taken out of the calculation, support fell to 45% in favour and 48% against. It found voters were split 33% to 27% in favour of voting on Saturdays.</p> <p>The biggest vote in support of Salmond showed that 63% of respondents favoured his proposed referendum question: \"Do you agree that Scotland should be an independent country?\", and 59% agreed the vote should be held in autumn 2014.</p> <p>Richard Baker, a Labour shadow minister, said: \"Tuesday was a three-part 'scomnishambles' for this government.\"</p>",
  "<p>'Cameron has been one of the most disappointing Conservative leaders.\" During his tenure, \"error has been piled upon error\". His party is still seen as \"a party of the rich\". His big society \"has been a complete failure as a message\". In office, as well as lacking a plan, his party \"has lost a sense of social justice \u2026 Conservative rhetoric often borders on social Darwinism\". Instead of \"a rightwing party with a heart\", Cameron has \"created a centrist party with cuts\".</p> <p>Even after months of Tory troubles, it is still something of a shock to hear these things from a lifelong Conservative. And not from some disgruntled activist or marginalised, anonymous cabinet dissident, but from one of the party's dominant figures, on the record, in the New Statesman, this newspaper and the Spectator over the past 12 months.</p> <p>Yet Tim Montgomerie is not like previous important Tories. Instead of a parliamentary constituency or ministry, or a personal fortune used for strategic donations, he has an unofficial party website, <a href=\"http://conservativehome.blogs.com/\" title=\"\">ConservativeHome</a>, and an increasing ubiquity in the rest of the political media. At 42, he is a fluent, seemingly inexhaustible writer, broadcaster, thinker, alliance-builder and campaigner. Over the past dozen years, he has played multiple, apparently contradictory Tory roles: internal critic and cheerleader; intimate of the party elite; self-appointed voice of the grassroots; polemicist for a more populist Conservatism \u2013 sometimes more, sometimes less right wing \u2013 and dispassionate analyst of the party's ups and downs.</p> <p>\"It's a new role in British politics,\" said Max Wind-Cowie of the Progressive Conservatism Project at the thinktank Demos. \"Without being elected, originally without the endorsement of a national paper, standing outside the official structure of one of the main parties, he has established himself as one of the foremost voices about what that party should do.\"</p> <p>Robert Halfon, Tory MP for Harlow, who has known Montgomerie since university, said: \"I've never met anyone like him. He's got so much energy in his head. He is a political entrepreneur.\"</p> <p>Montgomerie founded the ambitiously named ConservativeHome in 2005. Since 2009, it has been funded by the wealthy, perpetually manoeuvring Tory peer Lord Ashcroft. Edited by Montgomerie and four other staff, written by them and scores of contributors, it serves as a unique one stop shop for hundreds of thousands of rightwing Britons. \"ConHome\", as it is known in Tory circles, offers punditry, gossip, political philosophy, policy wonkery, a comprehensive roundup of Westminster news, appeals for help with Conservative causes, sales pitches from ambitious MPs, and sometimes raw contributions from party members and supporters.</p> <p>\"I and almost everyone else I know in the party read it at least once a day,\" said Wind-Cowie. Jesse Norman, Conservative MP for Hereford and South Herefordshire, said: \"Very few younger MPs don't check it.\" Halfon added: \"There are a lot of people in the Commons who say 'we don't look at it' when they look at it 50 times a day.\" Wind-Cowie, Norman and Halfon are all contributors \u2013 few prominent youngish Tories are not \u2013 but the site is also respected by bloggers on the left. Sunny Hundal, editor of <a href=\"http://liberalconspiracy.org/\" title=\"\">Liberal Conspiracy</a>, said: \"As a political operation I think ConHome sets the benchmark for everyone else.\"</p> <p>One well-connected Tory-watcher calls the site \"a party within a party\". A Tory MP said: \"Being a ConHome reader has almost replaced the party membership. I don't think I've looked at the official Conservative party website for about six months.\"</p> <p>Strikingly, senior Tories heavily criticised on ConservativeHome, such as the former health secretary Andrew Lansley, the former Tory chair Lady Warsi, and the former justice secretary Ken Clarke, often lose their jobs. On BBC Question Time in February, Clarke railed against \"Tim Montgomerie, who sets himself up as representing every active Tory in the country on his blasted website\". Sometimes mockingly, sometimes fearfully, many Tories have started referring to Montgomerie as \"the high priest of Conservatism\".</p> <p>In truth, ConservativeHome is a little too broad in tone and content to be simply a personal mouthpiece. It publishes hostile reader responses to Montgomerie's more controversial stances, such as support for a wealth tax (\"This is madness\") and gay marriage (\"You've sold your soul\"). Yet an argument for a particular sort of Conservatism pervades the site. Montgomerie and his online allies are sceptical about the EU, and about Cameron and his Tory \"modernisation\", which they consider too metropolitan and \u2013 gay marriage aside \u2013 too socially liberal. Most Britons, they argue, want the Conservative party to be tough on crime, welfare and immigration; but also more socially concerned and less elitist \u2013 \"rightwing with a heart\", in Montgomerie's phrase.</p> <p>\"He's got a robust, highly intelligent, well-organised critique of Conservatism from within the right,\" said Norman. \"The hybrid that Tim is pulling together is \u2026 rediscovering arguments from the 80s and 90s, but explicitly actuated by concern for the less well-off. The political effect of that is to reach out across political, class and emotional lines.\"</p> <p>Recently, there have been signs that the government is paying these ideas close attention. \"Conservative methods are not just good for the strong and the successful but the best way to help the poor,\" Cameron told his party conference this month. Montgomerie and ConservativeHome were even more prominent at the event than usual, their large, showily positioned marquee hosting events featuring Tory stars such as Michael Gove, Iain Duncan Smith and, most noisily, Boris Johnson \u2013 whose party leadership credentials Montgomerie has been pointedly talking up in recent months.</p> <p>At Tory gatherings, Montgomerie is easy to spot: tall, more casually dressed than more conventional Tory players, speaking in a seductively calm voice that combines politeness and attention-getting jolts of candour. At conference this month, \"he was just king of the whole place, striding about as if he really was running the party\", said one attendee.</p> <p>Montgomerie denies any such intention.\"I do not want ConservativeHome to be a party within a party,\" he said. \"I want it to be the conference fringe that never stops.\" Have he and the website prompted the Tories' current populist turn? \"It is possible that I was a little bit ahead of time \u2026 on the need for the party to support Britain's strivers. But the focus groups and opinion polls have been telling them similar things.\"</p> <p>Conservative unpopularity, and trying to find ways to end it, have been the near-constants of his political life. Born into an army family in Hampshire in 1970, his politics were Tory from the start. But his teenage Thatcherism was tempered, he says, by discovering evangelical Christianity at 16. At Exeter University, he helped run the Conservative Association with Halfon and two other current Tory MPs, Sajid Javid and David Burrowes. It was the end of the 80s and support for the Tories was ebbing. \"We used to talk about making the party not just for the rich,\" said Halfon. \"Tim had a BBC computer with an old-fashioned printer. He'd produce leaflets, newsletters, posters. A complete workaholic. ConHome is just an outgrowth of that.\"</p> <p>At Exeter, Montgomerie and Burrowes also started the Conservative Christian Fellowship, a still-extant organisation for uniting and expanding the party's Christian membership. Influenced by the US religious right, Montgomerie fiercely promoted what he now calls \"traditional views on homosexuality. That was my upbringing. I don't hold those views any more.\" After working briefly in the 1990s as a Bank of England statistician \u2013 for a polemicist, he retains an unusual, and potent, zest for figures \u2013 Montgomerie moved into full-time politics at Conservative central office, first under the leadership of William Hague, then under Iain Duncan Smith. Influenced by the \"compassionate conservatism\" of pre-9/11 George W Bush, Montgomerie saw his mission as strengthening the Tories' social conscience while keeping them as a strongly rightwing party. Duncan Smith increasingly relied on him, first as a speechwriter, then chief of staff. The fact that Duncan Smith's leadership went so badly has provided ammunition for Montgomerie's enemies ever since. As one MP put it: \"Tim is part of the problem, not part of the solution, some would say. The last time he had influence, the party was not in a beautiful place.\"</p> <p>To some of his critics, Montgomerie combines a restless search for ideological purity with electoral naivety: \"The Conservative version of Michael Foot's Labour party,\" wrote Matthew Parris in the Spectator last year. Others find Montgomerie's ever-quotable outspokenness sly or baffling or self-indulgent, given the already-buffeted government. \"He does cause a lot of angst, particularly in No 10,\" said the Tory blogger Iain Dale. \"But they still deal with him.\" Montgomerie is still invited to Downing Street drinks parties, and Cameron still talks to him at them. \"They are civil, but you can tell there's an underlying grievance,\" said one observer.</p> <p>Few doubt that Montgomerie would prefer a different leader. He was one of the earliest and strongest Tory pessimists about the party's chances at the next general election, and ConservativeHome, some Tories speculate, will play a pivotal kingmaking role if Cameron fails to win. Montgomerie said carefully: \"One day, we could bring two huge assets together, Boris, as a presidential PM, and the [very rightwing] class of 2010.\"</p> <p>Yet Montgomerie is a more complex person than sometimes imagined. Disarmingly mild-mannered, he \"never forgets if he feels you've let him down\", said Halfon. A veteran Westminster player, he lives in Salisbury, not London, most of the week, in the same otherworldly cathedral quarter as the former residence of Edward Heath. He is single, and able to work six days a week, he says, following \"biblical principle\": on the seventh, he gets the train with his sister to watch Manchester United and their famously Labour-supporting manager.</p> <p>Like many obsessive activists \u2013 Montgomerie insists he never wants to be an MP \u2013 he oscillates between optimism and pessimism, dissidence and loyalty. He recently launched another website, <a href=\"http://www.strongandcompassionate.com/\" title=\"\">strongandcompassionate.com</a>, straightforwardly dedicated, it appears, to campaigning for a Tory majority in 2015. He has described his political trajectory as a journey. He said: \"Perhaps I've moved leftwards on the NHS and rightwards on crime.\"</p> <p>His long-term ambition, he said, \"is for ConservativeHome to be handed over to someone else\" to run. Then what? There is an uncharacteristic pause. \"Maybe something in the [international] development world.\" Whoever is Tory leader then may breathe a sigh of relief.</p> <h2>Highs and lows<br><br></h2> <p><strong>Born</strong> 24 July 1970</p> <p><strong>Career</strong> Son of a soldier who discovered Thatcherism and Christianity in his teens, rose and then fell as an influential behind-the-scenes Tory, then reinvented himself as a new kind of political player through ConservativeHome.</p> <p><strong>High point </strong>Predicting before the 2010 general election that the first-ever televised party leaders' debates would be \"a big boost for Nick Clegg\", and that the Tories might \"live to regret\" agreeing to participate.</p> <p><strong>Low point </strong>Failure, as Iain Duncan Smith's chief of staff, to help protect the Tory leader in 2003 from an internal party coup has been cited ever since by critics who say he is too cerebral and naive.</p> <p><strong>What he says</strong> \"I'm not worried about ConservativeHome being too powerful.

The same goes for Iyad Ag Ghaly, a Touareg strongman and born-again Salafist, who founded the Ansar-ud-Deen movement at the end of last year.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/1PKdK_68r0A?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"369\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/1PKdK_68r0A\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>\"He believes in what he's doing,\" says Manny Ansar, director of the Festival in the Desert that has been taking place every January in and around Timbuktu and Kidal since 2001. \"And that's what frightens me. I'm not convinced that he wants to kill everyone who is not a Muslim, like the people in al-Qaida do, but I've seen him giving up the fruits of this life for God.\"</p> <p>Back in the 1990s, before he succumbed to the preaching of the Pakistani proselytising movement Tablighi Jamaat, Ghaly liked to smoke cigarettes and hang out with musicians from <a href=\"http://youtu.be/N2B8wIOIeO8\">Tinariwen</a>. He even composed songs and poems of love, rebellion and the beauty of his desert home. Now music, and with it a major source of communal cohesion and well being, has either disappeared or gone underground throughout the territory under his control.</p> <p>An official decree banning all western music was issued on 22 August by a heavily bearded Islamist spokesman in the city of Gao. \"We don't want the music of Satan. Qur'anic verses must take its place. Sharia demands it,\" the decree says.</p> <p>The ban comes in the context of a horrifically literal and gratuitous application of Sharia law in all aspects of daily life. Militiamen are cutting off the hands and feet of thieves or stoning adulterers. Smokers, alcohol drinkers and women who are not properly attired are being publicly whipped. As one well-known Touareg musician from Kidal says: \"There's a lack of joy. No one is dancing. There are no parties. Everybody's under this kind of spell. It's strange.\"</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398262204\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/24/1351060966001/Tinariwen-performing-at-t-009.jpg\" alt=\"Tinariwen performing at the World Cup 2010 Kickoff concert in Soweto, South Africa\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tinariwen, seen here performing at the World Cup 2010 Kickoff concert in Soweto, South Africa.

But the menace of al-Qaida started to have an effect on us in 2007. That's when al-Qaida people started to appear in the desert. They came to the nomad camps near Essakane [the beautiful dunes to the west of Timbuktu where the Festival in the Desert used to be held] and at first they were pleasant and said, 'Don't worry, we're Muslims like you.' Then they began to say, 'We have a common enemy, which is the west.' That's when I understood that things were going to get difficult.\"</p> <h2>The Kel Ansar<br></h2> <p>Remarkably, al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb (Aqim) never targeted the festival or any of the thousands of westerners who braved the journey to attend it. According to Ansar, some people put this down to the fact that his tribe, the Kel Ansar, are said to be descended directly from Muhammad and are highly revered. \"Others even thought that we cast spells to block their route,\" he says with a wry laugh. In truth, Aqim knew that if they wanted to keep the locals sweet and compliant, they were well advised not to mess with the Kel Ansar.</p> <p>Not all music events were so blessed. Returning from the Tamadacht festival near the eastern town of Anderamboukane in January 2009, a British tourist, Edwin Dyer, was kidnapped and sold to Aqim, who beheaded him four months later because the UK government refused to pay a ransom. It forced the Festival in the Desert to move into the safe confines of Timbuktu city limits in 2010.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398262205\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/24/1351061177889/U2-singer-Bono-attends-Ma-005.jpg\" alt=\"U2 singer Bono attends Mali's Festival in the Desert music festival in Timbuktu\" width=\"220\" height=\"132\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">U2 singer Bono attends Mali's Festival in the Desert music festival in Timbuktu.

The event was attended by Tinariwen, a host of other Touareg and Malian musicians and Bono.</p> <p>\"I was impressed by Bono's courage and that of his team,\" Manny says. \"He asked the soldiers who were assigned to protect him to leave him be and let him roam around the town freely or go and drink tea out on the dunes. But I wondered if I wasn't a bit mad myself to let him do that. I mean, Bono, kidnapped! Imagine that.\" La Maison, the hotel in Timbuktu where Bono and his entourage stayed, is now the headquarters of the city's Islamic tribunal.</p> <p>Manny felt like giving up when the rebellion erupted a few days after the end of the festival. But after talking to many musicians, as well as friends and international backers, he decided to organise a Caravan of Peace and Unity that will tour west Africa and visit refugee camps in February next year. He will also be promoting the Festival in the Desert in Exile in Europe, the Middle East, the US and elsewhere. \"It's my way of fighting back,\" he says. \"Before our music was heard in Essakane. Now it'll be heard in all the big festivals in the world. So it's the opposite of what the Islamists want. It's our victory and their defeat.\"</p> <p>Meanwhile, almost all the musicians in the north have fled the country like more than 500,000 of their fellow Malians, most of whom languish in refugee camps in Algeria, Mauritania, Niger or Burkina Faso. It is the biggest humanitarian crisis the Sahel has ever known. \"There's no music up there any more,\" says Vieux Farka Tour\u00e9, son of the king of the West African blues, the late Ali Farka Tour\u00e9. \"You can't switch on a radio or a TV, even at home.\"</p> <p>The town of Niafunk\u00e9 just south west of Timbuktu, where Ali Farka Tour\u00e9 was mayor for many years, is now under Islamist control. \"I know that if Ali were to awake from his tomb today,\" says <a href=\"http://youtu.be/7UGaGY9ulP0\">Afel Bocoum</a>, Tour\u00e9's former sidekick and Albarn's partner on the 2002 Mali Music project, \"he would just go straight back into it. He would die twice.\" Both Bocoum and Vieux Farka Tour\u00e9 have fled south to the safety of the Malian capital, Bamako, with their families.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/XtI0XXEeA2g?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"369\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/XtI0XXEeA2g\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>But down south, music is also in crisis, for related reasons. The military coup that toppled President Amadou Toumani Tour\u00e9 on 23&#xa0;March and kissed goodbye to one of Africa's most lauded democracies has left the capital, Bamako, fearful and economically depressed. \"People just aren't used to meeting soldiers in the street, so they tend to stay at home,\" says Adam Thiam, one of Mali's leading journalists.</p> <p>Many live music venues in Bamako, such as Le Diplomat, where Diabat\u00e9 and his Symmetric Orchestra used to play every weekend, have closed. The same goes for hotels and restaurants, starved of their once plentiful foreign tourist clientele. Nightclubs and weddings are still thriving but the trend is to save money by hiring sound systems and DJs rather than live musicians. \"People use what they earn to feed themselves, not to have fun,\" says <a href=\"http://youtu.be/9rDQYImnzwU\">Bassekou Kouyate</a>.</p> <p>But in west Africa, when the going gets tough, the rappers get going. Like Y'en A Marre, a collective that ignited nationwide debate during Senegal's election crisis last year, rappers in Mali have stepped up to denounce political skulduggery, Islamism and military rule.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398262206\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/24/1351062118292/Malian-singer-Rokia-Traor-006.jpg\" alt=\"Malian singer Rokia Traor\u00e9\" width=\"220\" height=\"132\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Malian singer Rokia Traor\u00e9.

We don't need them to teach us how to be Muslims. We're a secular tolerant country, where everyone declares their religion according to their feeling. And in any case, they know that a Mali without music is an impossibility.\"</p> <p>Amkoullel set up his own pressure group of rappers, activists and friends called Plus Jamais \u00c7a (Never Again). So far he has released a couple of videos, including one called SOS, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMJWoDeBRcg\" title=\"\">which has become a YouTube hit</a>. It has also been censored by the state broadcaster ORTM, which is still under the heavy hand of the military.</p> <p>\"We had this feeling that a heavy blow had been dealt to democracy,\" Amkoullel says of the 23 March putsch. \"And it had been done in a period of popular disillusion. It's as if in the collective consciousness, democracy was a failure in Mali.\" Like <a href=\"http://youtu.be/De8vJbYIWjA\">Les Sofas de la Republique</a>, the other rap collective raising the standard in rhyme for unity, democracy, peace and good governance, Amkoullel and his team have been organising demonstrations, debates and gigs. He has also received three death threats.</p> <p>\"I knew that our phones were being bugged,\" he says. \"Then I got this call that was like, 'Yeah \u2026 we're watching you, so you'd better calm down or take the consequences.' The second message wasn't from the same person. 'You're talking too much,' they said. 'Shut up or you'll disappear and won't understand a thing.' That was much clearer!\"</p> <p>And yet, despite the twin-pronged threat to the culture they have made world famous, all the musicians of Mali agree it remains at the core of their identity. \"I'm a Muslim, but Sharia isn't my thing,\" says <a href=\"http://youtu.be/3DydY8bHTyg\">Rokia Traor\u00e9</a>, one of Mali's most famous international stars. \"If I couldn't go up on stage anymore, I would cease to exist. And without music, Mali will cease to exist.\"</p>",

I am proud of having gone through the terribly difficult process of being falsely charged, falsely convicted and ultimately almost completely vindicated without losing my mind, becoming irrational, ceasing to be a penitent and reasonable person and actually being able to endure a discussion like this without getting up and smashing your face in.\"</p> <p>When a slightly flummoxed Paxman interjected: \"Well, you go ahead\", Black replied: \"No, I don't believe in violence.\"</p> <p>Earlier he told Paxman: \"I've been persecuted half to death. I don't have any shame. I am proud of what happened. I am proud of being in a US federal prison and surviving it.\"</p> <p>Throughout his Sky News and Newsnight appearances, Black's line of defence is that he was a victim of a terrible miscarriage of justice.</p> <p>\"Everything I did was legal, I didn't misunderstand [the law]. It as a smear job from A to Z because 99.95% of prosecutions are convicted, the whole [US legal] system is a fraudulent fascistic conveyor belt of corrupt prison system,\" he told Newsnight.</p> <p>When Paxman reminded him he was nonetheless a convicted criminal, Black turned to him: \"You're a fool, you're just a gullible fool; a priggish, gullible British fool, who takes seriously this ghastly American justice system that any sane British person knows is an outrage.\"</p> <p>On Tuesday afternoon, he popped up for his second round on Sky News's Boulton &amp; Co. \"Stop being a jackass, you're just being abrasive,\" he chided menacingly when Boulton asked him where he was going to live when his native Canada, where he is on a one-year temporary visa, turfed him out. \"I am not a refugee.\"</p> <p>\"Let me tell you something,\" he chided, before stopping to ask Boulton \"What's your name again?\"</p> <p>Later when asked why he had agreed to appear on BBC2's Have I Got News for You to be mocked, he said: \"I am here to sell books; I am not here to enjoy your somewhat predictable questions.\"</p> <p>He branded Boulton's employer, Rupert Murdoch, \"a sleaze-mongerer\" and insisted he wasn't a criminal because the US legal system had no \"validity\".</p> <p>In 2007 Black was convicted of defrauding Hollinger International shareholders of $6.1m (\u00a33.8m), by paying himself a tax-free bonus from the sale of newspaper assets without the approval of the company's board. He had been forced out of the company by shareholders in 2003.</p> <p>Black was released on bail after serving two-and-a-half years while his case was under an appeal, which resulted in two of his three fraud convictions being quashed. His original 78-month sentence was reduced to three years.</p> <p>He returned to jail last September to serve another 13 months and with time off for good behaviour he has completed his sentence.</p> <p>It is clear he does not see this as a bar to returning to public life in the UK, or resuming his seat in the House of Lords. He compared his plight to that of Nelson Mandela when he was released from Robben Island.</p> <p>\"First of all there is not a prohibition on a convicted criminal sitting [in the Lords],\" Black said on Newsnight. He told Boulton that he would \"presumably\" return to the upper house but hadn't decided yet.</p> <p>When Paxman moved to the subject of the extravagance of his wife Barbara Amiel, he feigned biliousness: \"Oh, God, I'm going to throw up.</p> <p>\"My first morning back in Britain and am I to be subjected to this? She wasn't extravagant. She's a magnificent wife \u2013 she visited me every week in prison, even when she had to come back from China to do it.\"</p> <p>Tom Bower, author of a book about Black, told Newsnight: \"What is so comical about Conrad Black is when he was in London he was always saying how genius capitalism is, but when shareholders said that he was stealing money in 2001, he said he was the victim.</p> <p>Five years ago he was convicted of defrauding the company he ran, Hollinger. He still claims to be innocent of all crimes. In the end Conrad Black believes he is god and everyone must bow to him.\"</p> <p>\"The one thing you can't say is he is a coward, he comes back again and again to suppress his critics.\"</p> <p><em>\u2022&#xa0;To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediaguardian.co.uk or phone 020 3353 3857.

  "<h2>Israel and the Palestinians</h2> <p>For decades a focal point of US foreign policy, the Israeli-Palestinian conflict was a notable absence in Monday's presidential debate.</p> <p>The only mention came when Mitt Romney was listing Barack Obama's supposed lack of progress in his first term: \"Are Israel and the Palestinians closer to reaching a peace agreement?\" the Republican candidate asked. \"No. They haven't had talks in two years.\"</p> <p>The lack of discussion reflects an agenda that is changing, partly as a result of upheaval elsewhere in the region and partly as a result of conscious efforts by the Israeli prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, to talk down the local conflict and talk up the threat from the Iranian nuclear programme. But it will deepen the disillusionment of many Palestinians with the commitment of the US to resolve the conflict, and perhaps increase their resolve to pursue alternative strategies, such as the bid for enhanced status at the United Nations.</p> <p><strong>Harriet Sherwood in Jerusalem</strong></p> <h2>Iran</h2> <p>The candidates restated long-held positions. Asked by the moderator, Bob Schieffer, whether an attack by Iran on Israel would be considered an attack on the US, both said they would stand by Israel. (The more pertinent question \u2013 what would be your response if Israel unilaterally launched an attack? \u2013 came later, and got no answer.)</p> <p>Obama highlighted the difference between his position and Romney's: \"The disagreement I have with Governor Romney is that during the course of this campaign he has often talked as if we should take premature military action. I think that would be a mistake.\"</p> <p>Romney spoke of the need to tighten sanctions and take further steps to isolate the Iranian regime diplomatically. \"Of course, military action is a last resort,\" he said. \"It is something one would only consider if all of the other avenues had been tried to their full extent.\"</p> <p>In a cutting riposte, Obama said: \"There have been times, governor, frankly, during the course of this campaign, where it sounded like you thought that you would do the some things we did, but you'd say them louder and somehow that that would make a difference.\"</p> <p>Volume, tone and perception count, of course. But on substance there may be little to choose between the two candidates.</p> <p><strong>Harriet Sherwood</strong></p> <h2>China</h2> <p>Romney <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/23/mitt-romney-china-currency-manipulator\" title=\"\">renewed his pledge to label China a currency manipulator \"on day one\"</a>, arguing that the US was losing a silent trade war with the world's second-largest economy.</p> <p>Overall, the Republican candidate took a milder stance towards Beijing, telling viewers on Tuesday night: \"We can be a partner with China; we don't have to be an adversary in any way, shape or form.\"</p> <p>But asked if he was formally accusing China of manipulating the yuan, and sparking a trade war, he replied: \"There's one going on right now, which we don't know about it. It's a silent one, and they're winning.\"</p> <p>\"We have to say to our friend in China \u2026 you can't keep on holding down the value of your currency, stealing our intellectual property, [and] counterfeiting our products [and] selling them around the world, even to the United States.\"</p> <p>The US has not labelled China a currency manipulator since 1994, though successive administrations have considered doing so. Some observers doubt whether Romney would actually follow through on his claims.</p> <p><strong>Tania Branigan in Beijing</strong></p> <h2>Africa</h2> <p>As expected, the 49 countries of sub-Saharan Africa hardly registered in the final US presidential debate.</p> <p>\"Africa\" came up only once, when Barack Obama said: \"Our alliances have never been stronger: in Asia, in Europe, in Africa, with Israel.\"</p> <p>The sole reference to South Africa was to the era of white-minority rule, two decades ago. It came when Mitt Romney said, of Iran: \"I would also make sure that their diplomats are treated like the pariah[s] they are around the world, the same way we treated the apartheid diplomats of South Africa.\"</p> <p>There was also a brief mention of Somalia, when Obama remarked: \"We created partnerships throughout the region to deal with extremism in Somalia, in Yemen, in Pakistan.\" The US has carried out drone strikes, and provided equipment and training to the African Union peacekeeping force that drove al-Qaida-linked militants out of their strongholds in Somalia.</p> <p>At one point Romney noted: \"Mali has been taken over \u2013 the northern part of Mali \u2013 by al-Qaida-type individuals.\"</p> <p>But after four years in which a president whose father was Kenyan raised hopes but failed to set Africa alight, the slim pickings came as little surprise on a continent accustomed to being far down the global agenda.</p> <p>Daniel Silke, a political analyst based in Cape Town, South Africa, tweeted: \"#Africa barely exists in final #Obama #Romney Presidential debate last night.\"</p> <p>Another tweeter, named Bevan, posted: \"Africa only mentioned twice in whole debate (Obama/Romney),hope fellow Africans took note. Only Africans can n will develop Africa for all.\"</p> <p>Jacques Sibomana, an entrepreneur, tweeted: \"And Africa yet became a forgotten Continent during the debate #Romney and #Obama.\"</p> <p>Last week, two analysts, Witney Schneidman and Andrew Westbury, <a href=\"http://allafrica.com/stories/201210191196.html\" title=\"\">issued a plea</a> for Schieffer to ask the candidates about Africa. They wrote: \"We urge you to use your privilege as moderator to direct the country's attention to a part of the world that has never been more important, but seemingly never so neglected as it concerns American foreign policy priorities: sub-Saharan Africa.\" It appears Schieffer failed to heed them.</p> <p><strong>David Smith in Johannesburg</strong></p> <h2>Pakistan</h2> <p>As with many other parts of the foreign policy debate, there was no daylight between the two candidates on Pakistan, with Mitt Romney using his time to try to demonstrate that he has some understanding of the country.</p> <p>He listed all the well-worn problems that, in the eyes of many US foreign policy experts, make Pakistan a troublesome country, albeit one the US can never afford to ignore.</p> <p>\"It is not time to divorce a nation on Earth that has 100 nuclear weapons and is on the road to double that at some point,\" Romney said.</p> <p>Repeated reference was made to Pakistan's nuclear stockpile, including to the prospect of the country, of 180 million people, one day having more nuclear weapons than Britain.</p> <p>He also noted the presence in Pakistan of the Haqqani network, an Afghan insurgent faction allied to the Taliban that has recently been designated a terrorist group by the US, and the threat that Taliban-sympathising ethnic Pashtuns in Pakistan may pose to Afghanistan after the end of the US combat mission, in 2014.</p> <p>He said: \"This is a nation which, if it becomes a failed state \u2026 there are nuclear weapons there, and you have terrorists that can grab those nuclear weapons.\"</p> <p>With the stakes so high, Romney was never going to forgo any tools for dealing with Pakistan, including the supposedly secret drone programme run by the CIA. Although the unmanned aircraft are a major source of friction between Pakistan and the US, Romney said the US must use \"any and all means necessary\" to target terrorists. \"I support that entirely, and feel the president was right to up the usage of that policy,\" he said.</p> <p>For his part, Obama simply let his record stand, using his time during the Afghanistan and Pakistan section to turn swiftly back to domestic policy, saying his strategy of building up the Afghan security forces would allow the US to divert resources to \"nation-building\" in the US.</p> <p><strong>Jon Boone in Islamabad</strong></p> <h2>Russia</h2> <p>Obama attempted to paint Romney as out of touch by recalling his Republican challenger's statement that Russia was the United States's \"number one political foe\". He upped the ante a bit by saying Romney had called Russia the country's number one political \"threat\". Romney corrected him on that later in the debate: the main threat, he insisted, was Iran.</p> <p>\"The 1980s are now calling to ask for their foreign policy back,\" Obama said, recalling Romney's words. \"Because the cold war has been over for 20 years.\"</p> <p>That's what some Russians have been saying all along. Shortly after Romney made the statement, earlier this year, Dmitry Medvedev, Russia's prime minister, advised the candidates to \"check their clocks from time to time. It's 2012, not the mid-1970s.\"</p> <p>The hardliners inside Russia, including Vladimir Putin, instead welcomed the statement as \"blunt\" and \"straightforward\". They are likely to do the same with the thoughts Romney aired during the debate.</p> <p>\"I'm not going to wear rose-coloured glasses when it comes to Russia or Mr Putin,\" Romney said, noting that \"Russia does continue to battle us in the UN, time and time again\". He also noted Moscow's recent withdrawal from the Nunn-Lugar agreement on arms clean-up as a sign of receding US influence in the world.</p> <p>With US-Russian relations spiralling to new post-cold war lows, it will be hard for Russia's leaders to disagree with any of that. Many will probably be happy simply to know that someone in Washington DC has noticed.</p> <p><strong>Miriam Elder in Moscow</strong></p> <h2>Europe </h2> <p>\"Our alliances,\" said Obama, \"have never been stronger: in Asia, in Europe, in Africa, with Israel.\"</p> <p>And for Europeans, that was it. The sole reference to Europe in the debate was a perfunctory passing remark from the president; the word Europe did not cross the lips of Romney at all.</p> <p>There was no eurocrisis, despite the Obama administration's worries about how the sovereign debt troubles might affect his re-election prospects, and despite the transatlantic pressure, on the Germans especially, to get to grips with the crisis.</p> <p>Germany was not mentioned once, and France just once, along with Britain, in another throwaway remark, contrasting high US defence spending with the thriftiness of others.</p> <p>The special relationship? The UK warranted one further single mention, Romney simply noting that Pakistan will soon have more nuclear warheads than Britain.</p> <p>But failure to mention Europe may be just the way the Europeans want it. After talking to French and European diplomats, Lib\u00e9ration's <a href=\"http://washington.blogs.liberation.fr/great\\_america/\" title=\"\">Washington blog</a> sensed they were OK with the fact that Europe had \"disappeared from America's radar\", happy that Obama was not blaming the eurozone crisis as a source of US economic woe, and that Romney had stopped riffing on the dangers of \"European socialism\" (in other words, the French president, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande).</p> <p>Both <a href=\"http://www.lepoint.fr/dossiers/monde/election-presidentielle-americaine-2012/le-troisieme-debat-romney-un-obama-bis-23-10-2012-1519983\\_539.php\" title=\"\">Le Point</a> and <a href=\"http://www.lefigaro.fr/elections-americaines/2012/10/23/01040-20121023ARTFIG00278-face-a-romney-obama-l-emporte-sans-creuser-l-ecart.php\" title=\"\">Le Figaro</a> felt that Romney had passed the test of leadership stature by keeping calm and succeeding in coming across as a plausible possible president.</p> <p>In a taster of its front-page editorial, Le Monde said: \"Point taken: foreign politics plays no role in the American election. On 6 November, voters will decide on one issue alone: the economy.\"</p> <p>Despite the irrelevance of Europe to the campaign, European elites are, of course, keenly watching the US election. Support for Obama is overwhelming, even if disappointment with the last four years is palpable; wariness of Romney is widespread.</p> <p>A BBC opinion poll released on Monday showed sweeping support in Europe for Obama, with France, perhaps surprisingly, returning stronger backing for the incumbent than anywhere else in the world, 72% to 2% for Romney. Two-thirds of British and Germans supported Obama, while Romney enjoyed 7% and 8% levels. The poll was conducted last month.</p> <p>Romney's highest European support came from Poland. But even that was a niggardly 16%, probably because of the Republican contender's relatively hard line on Russia.</p> <p><strong>Ian Traynor in Brussels and Angelique Chrisafis in Paris</strong></p> <h2>Latin America</h2> <p>It may be next door to the US with a population of 590 million people and some of the world's fastest growing economies, but Latin America barely received a mention during Monday night's debate.</p> <p>Obama failed to refer to anything on the continent south of the Rio Grande. Romney briefly accused the president of showing weakness towards Fidel Castro and Hugo Ch\u00e1vez and failing to take better advantage of the trade opportunities in the region, but the total time devoted to Latin America in the 90-minute-long debate was about 20 seconds.</p> <p>The sense of rejection was evident in the regional and Hispanic media.</p> <p>\"<a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/ABC_Univision/Politics/obama-romney-care-latin-america-mexico-brazil-cuba/story?id=17508488#.UIZBmmka8eY\" title=\"\">Obama and Romney Don't Care About Latin America</a>,\" said ABC-Univision, a major Spanish-language media group. Online commentators noted there was no mention of the drug war raging just across the Rio Grande in Mexico, insecurity in Central America, or free trade with Colombia.</p> <p>\"<a href=\"http://veja.abril.com.br/noticia/internacional/em-ultimo-debate-candidatos-tentam-conquistar-indecisos\" title=\"\">Nobody loves our Latin America very much</a>,\" wrote Caio Binder, a correspondent for Brazil's Veja magazine. Binder said Romney also got his numbers wrong in his brief mention of the region.</p> <p>In a positive description of the trade opportunity that the US had so far failed to take advantage of, Romney said: \"As a matter of fact, Latin America's economy is almost as big as the economy of China. We're all focused on China. Latin America is a huge opportunity for us \u2013 time zone, language opportunities.\"</p> <p>Binder commented acidly: \"Wrong, governor: According to the IMF, the GDP of Latin America (and the Caribbean) in 2011 was $ 5.6tn, while that of China was $7.3tn.\" Nonetheless, he said Romney had scored a point among Latin American voters for at least mentioning the region.</p> <p>The lack of attention to the region may disappoint the 21 million eligible Hispanic voters in the US, who are seen as potential deciders in three swing states \u2013 Florida, Nevada and Colorado. In Florida, they are particularly strongly represented with 16% of eligible voters.</p> <p>Nationwide, polls suggest Obama has the support of about 65% support of this group, compared with 35% for Romney. In Florida they are almost level.</p> <p>But Romney's mentions of Ch\u00e1vez, Castro and trade prompted his supporters to claim he had made the case to Hispanic voters.</p> <p>\"I was very gratified that it was Mitt Romney who brought up Latin America, who talked of doing more trade with the region, and was the one who said we have issues in Venezuela, we have issues in Cuba,\" Hector Barreto, who chairs a Romney support group, told NBC.</p> <p>Obama's team claimed the president's actions spoke louder than his words. \"Two passing references to Latin America in a debate does not change the fundamentals of the president's record on Latin America: No president has visited the region more times, in his first four years in office, exports are up more than 50%, we have new free trade agreements with Colombia, and Panama, and all of that is a function of his leadership,\" said Dan Restrepo, who was the administration's top Latin America adviser.</p> <p>The oversight of Latin America was largely due to the moderator Bob Schieffer who choose not to raise related issues, such as regional diplomacy, trade, drug control and immigration. But language may also be a partial explanation. Although Romney talked of Latin America's \"language opportunities\" for the US and although most Hispanics in the US speak English, the two candidates were less enthused to raise Latin American issues in this debate in English compared to interviews they have given to the Spanish language media.</p> <p><strong>Jonathan Watts in Rio de Janeiro</strong></p> <h2>Asia </h2> <p>Neither Obama nor Romney mentioned anywhere in Asia but China during the debate, despite the fact that America's presence in the region has involved a considerable number of south-east Asian nations in recent months, and that only looks set to increase.</p> <p>The US secretary of defence, Leon Panetta, visited Vietnam in June to promote greater ties between the former foes and stabilise a move whereby 60% of America's naval ships will be based in Asia Pacific by 2020. Then, last month in Jakarta, the secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, encouraged a regionally unified code of conduct for the 10 members of the Association of South-east Asian Nations (Asean) in dealing with China over territorial disputes in the South China Sea (Clinton later went on to visit both Timor-Leste and Brunei).</p> <p>And in the US, Obama met Aung San Suu Kyi of Burma, who was allowed for the first time in two decades to visit the US, and was awarded Congress's highest medal. That meeting was followed by the easing of many of the travel restrictions and sanctions against the former pariah nation, and, just last week, the US military's invitation to Burma to participate in a joint Thai-American military drill involving south-east and east Asian nations. That invitation was the US's first such engagement with Burma since 1988.</p> <p>With some analysts expecting the region to be at the centre of any US-Chinese disagreements over shared geopolitical interests, such as the South China Sea, one may very well expect to hear more about south-east Asia in the near future.</p> <p><strong>Kate Hodal in Bangkok</strong></p>",
  "<p>The president of Uruguay, Jos\u00e9 Mujica, has announced plans to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/sep/22/relaxation-cannabis-laws-war-on-drugs\" title=\"\">legalise the production and sale of marijuana</a> under a state monopoly, triggering a lively controversy in Montevideo. The relevant bill will soon be tabled in parliament, where the governing centre-left coalition led by the Broad Front (FA) enjoys a majority but is divided on this issue.</p> <p>Possessing and consuming marijuana was decriminalised in 2000. \"There is no question of Uruguay producing and distributing drugs, but the state will control and regulate the market,\" said interior minister Eduardo Bonomi.</p> <p>\"We have a progressive tradition,\" said Bonomi who, with Mujica, belonged to the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/oct/25/jose-mujica-favourite-uruguay-election\" title=\"\">Tupamaros urban guerrillas</a> in the 1970s. \"At the beginning of the 20th century our country ended the prohibition of alcohol, prostitution and gambling.\" Abortion is currently in the process ofbeing legalised. \"Our approach to marijuana is equally pragmatic,\" Bonomi said. \"The negative effects of consuming marijuana are far less harmful than the outbreak of violence associated with the black market.\"</p> <p>About 300,000 people (8% of the population) occasionally consume the drug. But the domestic market, currently illegal, is worth about $75m, according to the minister. \"The main hazard is not marijuana but the dealers who supply much more dangerous substances such as <em>paco</em> [a low-grade cocaine base], which does terrible damage.\"</p> <p>The government has not made it clear how production will be managed. Mujica has suggested that 150 hectares of land would be sufficient to cover demand, with distribution being entrusted to a \"private company\" under strict state control.</p> <p>The opposition is critical of the bill, arguing that it will boost drug use without reducing insecurity. Bonomi admits that crime is steadily increasing in Uruguay, but stresses that \"it is much lower than neighbouring countries such as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/brazil\" title=\"\">Brazil</a> or <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/argentina\" title=\"\">Argentina.</a>\"</p> <p>Insecurity is a prime concern for Uruguayans and a main cause of criticism of the president, whose approval ratings have fallen from 66% in 2004 when elected to 40%, according to a recent poll. However, three former Latin American presidents \u2013 Fernando Henrique Cardoso, C\u00e9sar Gaviria and Ernesto Zedillo, respectively of Brazil, Colombia and Mexico \u2013 have called for governments to take control of drugs. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/guatemala\" title=\"\">Guatemala</a> is in favour of the Mujica plan, and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/bolivia\" title=\"\">Bolivia</a> is looking at ways of legalising coca leaves.</p> <p>\u2022 <em>This article appeared in </em><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/weekly?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">Guardian Weekly</a><em>, which incorporates material from Le Monde</em></p>",
  "<p>Just a step from the centre of Rio de Janeiro, at the heart of the docks undergoing a massive facelift in preparation for the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/olympic-games-2016\" title=\"\">2016 Olympics</a>, two workers await the verdict of three archaeologists at the bottom of a trench. Municipal workers have once again stumbled on the remains of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/mar/04/archaeologists-find-slave-port\" title=\"\">Valongo wharf</a>, where the largest number of slaves imported to the Americas disembarked. A place to remember, a place of suffering long buried under the paving stones of this dazzling city.</p> <p>More than 600,000 slaves passed through in the early 19th century. The slave market stood nearby, much as the \"cemetery of new blacks\": new because they had just arrived. Since work started in 2010, a huge variety of bracelets, precious stones and personal items has been unearthed, tens of thousands of objects, says Tania Andrade Lima, who heads the dig.</p> <p>Work on the wharf has also revealed the scale of the slave trade in Brazil. Of the 9.5 million people captured in Africa and brought to the New World between the 16th and 19th century, nearly 4 million landed in Rio, 10 times more than all those sent to the United States.</p> <p>But for the last century Brazil has tried to forget its past, refusing to accept the legacy of the slave trade. It has sought to project the image of a country of mixed descent, where the colour of a person's skin does not count, a land unfettered by racism where cordial relations reign between citizens of Indian, European and African descent.</p> <p>Brazil was the last American nation to abolish slavery, on 13 May, 1888. At the time Rio represented the largest urban concentration of slaves since the end of the Roman empire, more than 40% of the population, almost a complete city in irons. Rio city council now plans to turn part of Valongo into an open-air archaeological site. \"This heritage can finally be recognised, shown off and used to combat our collective amnesia [...] regarding the black community,\" Lima suggests. The country is certainly changing. There are few people in Rio who would still describe it as a \"<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racial_democracy\" title=\"\">racial democracy</a>\", a term coined by the sociologist and writer Gilberto Freyre. Black movements tend to refer to \"institutionalised racism\", a view endorsed, among others, by the Catholic church, which condemns discrimination and the persistence of a slave-based mindset.</p> <p>According to census results published in 2011 by the <a href=\"http://www.ibge.gov.br/english/\" title=\"\">Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics</a> (IBGE), <em>brancos</em> (whites) account for less than half the population for the first time since the 19th century. Approximately 51% see themselves as <em>preto</em> (black, 8%) or <em>pardo</em> (mixed, 43%), up by more than 5% on 2000. The statistics also show that Brazilians of colour are at a significant disadvantage compared with their white counterparts. Racial inequality is manifest in many respects, starting with the share-out of riches. Two-thirds of the poor are pretos or pardos. With the same qualifications, coloured people earn half as much as whites. A black woman only earns a quarter of the salary paid to a white male. According to a 2007 survey, coloured people only account for 3.5% of executives, 10% of university students, 5% of members of parliament, 3% of the judiciary. So there's room for more change.</p> <p>President Dilma Rousseff's 36-strong coalition government includes only one black minister, Luiza Helena de Bairros, secretary of state for racial equality. She is a worthy successor to Edison Arantes do Nascimento, aka Pel\u00e9, the first coloured man to serve as a minister (of sport) in 1994. All the figures confirm this situation, contradicting the impressions of passing visitors. \"Racism in Brazil is well hidden, subtle and unspoken, underestimated by the media,\" says Joaquim Barbosa, the first black judge to sit on the bench of the supreme court in Brasilia. \"It is nevertheless extremely violent.\" Appointed by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/luiz-inacio-lula-da-silva\" title=\"\">President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva</a> (<em>left</em>) in 2003 and a well-known public figure, he recalls two occasions when white men handed him their car keys as he entered a fashionable restaurant in Rio. Being black they assumed he was a valet. \"But,\" he adds, \"things are slowly changing and awareness is growing.\"</p> <p>In a sensational decision this April the 10 supreme court judges unanimously ruled in favour of positive discrimination in higher education, declaring that the racial quotas in Brazilian universities were constitutional and redressed the \"social debt of slavery\". Dozens of expert witnesses were heard and the ruling was televised live.</p> <p>In August the senate passed a bill requiring federal universities to reserve half their places for students from state schools. Rousseff has signed the whole text into law; universities have till 2015 to comply. In practice the law mixes social and racial criteria, taking into account local particularities. It sets aside a quarter of all places in federal universities for students from families with an income less than or equal to one and a half times the minimum wage ($460). The other quarter will be allocated to students according to their self-declared skin colour.</p> <p>According to the daily <a href=\"http://oglobo.globo.com/\" title=\"\">O Globo</a> the law will more than double the number of affirmative-action places in Rio's four federal universities. They currently set aside 5,400 places for social quotas, but under the new arrangements their number will rise to 12,350. Opponents of the quota system have condemned the \"racialisation\" of Brazil, rooted in an increasingly ethnic approach to social affairs. Above all the ensuing debate seems to have put an end to the myth of racial democracy, in which skin colour does not count.</p> <p>A major change is apparently underway in what the sociologist Alberto Guerreiro Ramos called \"the most racist country in the world\", during the military dictatorship in the 1980s, a view endorsed by most of the experts Le Monde talked to. \"The quotas are the only alternative to the mechanisms of concealment and social exclusion set up since the end of slavery,\" says Spiritos Santos, the author of a lively blog on racial issues.</p> <p>\"This new phase is a revolution for Brazil,\" says David Raimundo dos Santos, a Franciscan friar who heads <a href=\"http://www.educafro.org.br/\" title=\"\">Educafro</a>, an NGO that campaigns to gain access to education for coloured people. He believes that blacks, once slave to a master, are now slaves to a system. \"Brazil is waking up and can now claim to have found a method for integration,\" he adds.</p> <p>Since independence in 1822, the Brazilian elite has sought to deny the nation's African roots. \"In an effort to glorify the past, while making no concessions to the Portuguese, the elite started by promoting the Indians, the original masters of the land and no threat to the slave-makers,\" says the historian Richard Marin. Blacks were sidelined. Even the abolitionist writer <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rui_Barbosa\" title=\"\">Ruy Barbosa de Oliveirato</a>, then finance minister, authorised much of the government records of slavery to be destroyed in 1890.</p> <p>When slavery was finally abolished the former captives were left to fend for themselves. Unlike Abraham Lincoln, who established 4,000 schools for former slaves, Brazil did not open a single one. \"With no land nor education, cut off from any social organisation, the enfranchised blacks were condemned to misery,\" according to historian Alain Rouqui\u00e9. \"The long-awaited abolition ultimately entrenched inequality.\"</p> <p>Prior to the financial crisis of 1929 the boom in coffee production attracted 4 million immigrants from Europe with little concern for the country's colonial past. On the grounds that this young and prosperous nation could not flourish with a largely black population, European immigration was encouraged in order to \"whiten\" Brazil, to <em>limpar o sangue</em> (cleanse the blood).</p> <p>Efforts to reassert the country's racial legacy started in the 1920s with Brazilian Modernism, which cast off Europe's academic strictures, and the novels of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%A1rio_de_Andrade\" title=\"\">Mario de Andrade</a>, which focused on the switch from a white to a black culture. In the 1930s the work of sociologist Gilberto Freyre \u2013 in particular <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casa-Grande_%26_Senzala\" title=\"\">Casa Grande e Senzala</a> (Masters and Slaves) \u2013 highlighted racial mixing as one of Brazil's defining features. He made no distinction between the three main ethnic groups \u2013 Africans, Indians and Portuguese.</p> <p>This concept, which contrasted with the north American segregationist model, proved very popular in Brazil, boosting the legitimacy of the authoritarian <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estado_Novo_%28Brazil%29\" title=\"\">Estado Novo</a> regime, in power during the second world war. Half-white, half-black <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Our_Lady_of_Aparecida\" title=\"\">Nossa Senhora da&#xa0;Concei\u00e7ao Aparecida</a> became the country's patron saint.</p> <p>But there was a big gap between the supposed racial democracy and the actual condition of many Afro-Brazilians, the victims of racism. Concealed by the absence of legal segregation and the warmth of social intercourse, this \"cordial racism\" was denied.</p> <p>The debate on quotas started in the 1990s under <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fernando_Henrique_Cardoso\" title=\"\">President Fernando Henrique Cardoso</a>. He set up working groups to discuss public action to promote the black community and made it compulsory for official documents to indicate skin colour. In 2002 Bahia State University introduced racial quotas, gradually followed by about 60 other establishments.</p> <p>Under Lula, the explicit goal of racial quotas was to compensate for the racial discrimination endured by blacks. After 10 years of debate and experiment the ruling by the supreme court endorses this approach.</p> <p>The streets of the Valongo neighbourhood have just been paved over and re-opened to traffic. This evening the first episode of a <em>telenovela</em> (soap), Lado a Lado (side by side) will be broadcast. It is the story of a black community after the abolition of slavery. \"It is an exciting and as yet little known period,\" said the lead actor, Lazaro Ramos.

Apparently, what is covered is potential humiliation as Muamba reckons he'd love to give Strictly Come Dancing a go. \"I love salsa, so I'd be well up for that,\" he told the Radio Times.</p>",

  "<p><em>Training to become a lawyer is a competitive and expensive business. Unfortunately, finding where help comes from can be a challenge and a bit time-consuming. Here's a guide to what's on offer at the different stages of your journey into the law that might help make it a bit less bumpy.</em></p> <h2>Graduate Diploma in Law (GDL) and Legal Practice Course (LPC)<br></h2> <p>Non-law graduates looking to pursue a career as a solicitor or barrister will have to complete the year-long conversion course or GDL. The cost varies from around \u00a34,000 to \u00a310,000 depending on where you study.</p> <p>Those who want to become solicitors then have to pass the LPC, which also lasts a year, and costs between \u00a37,000 and \u00a313,000 (although there are now some fast track programmes available), before completing a two-year training contract.</p> <p>Trainee solicitors currently receive a mandatory minimum salary of \u00a316,650 (\u00a318,590 in central London). However, that is <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/law/2012/may/17/trainee-solicitors-minimum-wage\" title=\"\">being scrapped</a> from August 2014, after which firms will only be obliged to pay the national minimum wage of \u00a311,265 a year. Trainee salaries vary enormously depending on the size of the firm. Those at large regional, national and City firms could expect to receive anywhere from \u00a320-40,000 a year, while those in legal aid and smaller high street practices will receive considerably less.</p> <h2>Law school scholarships </h2> <p>The law schools providing the professional courses offer numerous scholarships to help talented students meet the costs. Again, it's a case of trawling through the websites and prospectuses to find out what they offer and whether you might qualify.</p> <p>Selection can be based on an application or following tests, essay or presentation assessments.</p> <p>Here are a couple to get you going: The College of Law has just extended its Gold Award, which provides up to \u00a33,000 to non-law graduates taking the GDL.</p> <p>They are open to students with a first class undergraduate degree or a distinction at masters level. It offered 60 of the awards to help students who started the programme in September and will now offer 30 more to students starting the course in January 2013.</p> <p>The awards are open to students accepting a place on the full time course and are aimed at students without sponsorship from a firm or chambers, although part-sponsored students will be considered.</p> <p>Successful applicants will receive \u00a32,000 towards their tuition fees. If they go on to study the LPC or BTPC at the college, they will receive a further \u00a31,000 towards the fees, providing they are still unsponsored.</p> <p>Eligible students can <a href=\"http://gdlgoldaward@lawcol.co.uk\" title=\"\">email</a> for information. You will be required to submit a statement setting out what winning the award would mean to you and how it would help you attain your ambition of a career in law. The closing date is 7 December.</p> <p>Kaplan Law School offers two diversity scholarships, giving LPC students, who have attended a non-fee paying secondary school or college for their A-levels, a 15% reduction on their fees.</p> <h2>Sponsorship from firms </h2> <p>A number of law firms, generally the large City and top 100 commercial practices, sponsor the students that they give training contracts to, paying GDL and LPC fees as well as maintenance costs. Many of these firms stipulate which law school you must attend as they provide courses tailored to the needs of the particular firm. Details are provided on the firms' websites.</p> <p>You can also get information from The Training and Pupillages Handbook, a new version of which will be published at the end of October. It is made available free to university careers services and law departments, but can also be <a href=\"http://www.lawcareers.net\" title=\"\">purchased online</a>.</p> <h2>Bank loans </h2> <p>If you have no other funding option, you might want to consider professional and career development loans offered by high street banks. Barclays Bank and the Co-operative will lend GDL and LPC students between \u00a3300 and \u00a310,000. Interest rates are lower than for standard loans and you will not have to repay the loan until you have finished the course. Investec Bank offers loans for full time students studying at BPP.</p> <h2>Charities and grant-making trusts</h2> <p>There may be charities and grant-making trusts to which some students can apply. Details of can be sought from the local library (if you still have one) and the local authority awards officer. The website <a href=\"http://www.turn2us.org.uk/\" title=\"\">turn2us</a> provides a searchable database of benefits and grants available. Qualification for these awards varies hugely, and they usually only provide small amounts of money, so don't rely on one to provide full financial support for either tuition or maintenance.</p> <h2>The Law Society's Diversity Access Scheme </h2> <p>To help improve social mobility in the legal profession, the scheme offers LPC scholarships to talented students who have overcome exceptional social, educational, financial or personal obstacles to train to qualify as a solicitor. Since it was set up in 2004, the scheme has helped 113 students, including some who have been in local authority care, resisted coercion into arranged marriage, and battled with severe physical disabilities. It also provides successful applicants with work experience and mentoring.</p> <p>Last year it assisted 30 students. The Society has just confirmed that the scheme, which is supported by several law firms and law schools as well as by the Law Society's charity, will be available next year. Details of how to apply will be posted on the <a href=\"http://www.juniorlawyers.lawsociety.org.uk/funding-studies\" title=\"\">Junior Lawyers Division website</a> at the start of next year.</p> <h2>The Graham Rushton Award for visually impaired law students </h2> <p>Graham Rushton was a blind lawyer who left a large sum of money to the RNIB to be spent on assisting blind and partially sighted law students.The <a href=\"http://juniorlawyers.lawsociety.org.uk/node/13682\" title=\"\">grant is around \u00a37,000</a>.</p> <h2>Awards and scholarships to fund work experience</h2> <p>A number of other awards and scholarships exist to fund overseas work experience. These include the <a href=\"http://www.hrla.org.uk/Bursary_2011.php\" title=\"\">Human Rights Lawyers' Association bursary scheme</a> which enables law students to undertake internships, work placements and other poorly paid work in human rights law. It provides around five awards and a maximum annual bursary fund of \u00a36,000.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.hubbardlawscholarship.com.\" title=\"\">H M Hubbard Law Scholarship</a>, for trainee and qualified solicitors, funds the study of law and legal procedures in France, Spain or Canada.The Inderpal Rahal Memorial Trust provides grants towards legal training for women from an immigrant or refugee background who intend to practise or teach law in the UK.

  "<p>Arctic ice is <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/sep/19/arctic-ice-shrinks\" title=\"\">melting faster than expected</a>. Five years ago authoritative predictions suggested it would take until 2065 to shrink to the size it reached last month.</p> <p>Drastic action is necessary to reduce emissions from the energy sector if we are to slow the rate of global warming.</p> <p>Earlier this year, the UK government's independent climate adviser, the Climate Change Committee (CCC), <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/sep/13/uk-dash-gas-illegal-climate-committee\" title=\"\">called for the carbon footprint of UK electricity to be 50g/kWh by 2030</a>. However, the government has set a standard for new electricity generators that is nine times higher. This is to allow electricity generation from natural gas. But we will not achieve the CCC target if these gas plants are built, because they typically last 30 years. The government claims this \"dash for gas\" will lead us out of recession.</p> <p>Rather than listening to the fossil fuel lobby, the government should look to Germany, now leading Europe out of recession. In today's Nature Materials, <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/nmat/journal/v11/n11/full/nmat3466.html\" title=\"\">I point out, with German and Italian colleagues</a>, that the peak price of electricity in Germany is falling steadily, giving their industry a competitive advantage.</p> <p>The peak price is falling because the amount of solar photovoltaic (PV) electricity is rising exponentially. In summer or winter, PV systems in Germany supply cheap electricity with maximum power around noon, when the sun is highest. The peak demand, and therefore peak price of electricity, also occurs around noon.</p> <p>In the UK, an all-renewable electricity supply would be even easier than Germany because the monthly wind variation and evening electricity demand match. Our evidence suggests the most effective, cheapest and quickest way to achieve the CCC target is to impose their limit on new electricity generation here and now.</p> <p>All the renewable energy technologies are well below the CCC limit. Most of them are already well established. In 2011 the UK had 12.3GW of renewable power which is around 20% of our maximum electricity demand.</p> <p>Many more renewable energy technologies are available now than in 2006. Offshore wind is expanding. My group at Imperial has developed solar cells that are being manufactured with three times the efficiency of current PV panels. Tidal and wave power did not appear in the 2011 figures, yet the UK has one half and one third respectively of Europe's tidal and wave resources.</p> <p>Bioenergy contributes around one quarter of the UK renewable supply. Many types of biogas generator produce electricity cheaper than using natural gas. A fast-rising biogas contributor is anaerobic digestion. This is biogas from bacterial fermentation of food, sewage or livestock waste in closed vessels. Resulting carbon dioxide emissions are much lower than the CCC limit and greenhouse gases from the rotting waste are avoided.</p> <p>Importantly, all biogas fuels are indigenous. A \"dash for biogas\" will mean the price of UK electricity will no longer depend on the whim of foreign governments. There would also be no need for the environmentally unsound and politically unpopular method of \"fracking\" for shale gas.</p> <p>Recovery from recession is hindered by the reluctance of banks to invest in new industry. A large number of first-time investors were prepared to support the UK renewable industry but were deterred <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/oct/28/solar-subsidies-cut-half\" title=\"\">when the feed-in tariff (FiT) for solar photovoltaics was cut in half</a>. The FiT should be more closely modelled on the successful German counterpart. If the Treasury reversed its decision to count the FiT on its books, public expenditure would be reduced at a stroke.</p> <p>An even bigger boost to government finances could result if the CCC limit were imposed now. The government could save much of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/mar/21/budget-2012-oil-industry-tax\" title=\"\">\u00a33bn tax break they gave the fossil fuel industry in the budget</a>.</p> <p>Adopting the CCC limit now would help the UK emerge from recession. The cost of electricity would fall, new jobs would be created, government debt would fall and, at last, the government <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/may/14/cameron-wants-greenest-government-ever\" title=\"\">could fulfil its pledge to be \"the greenest government ever</a>.\"</p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www3.imperial.ac.uk/people/k.barnham\" title=\"\">Keith Barnham</a> is emeritus professor of physics at Imperial College London and author of <a href=\"http://bookshop.blackwell.co.uk/jsp/id/The_Burning_Answer/9780297869634\" title=\"\">The Burning Answer</a> to be published by Orion Books next year</p>",
  "<p>Labour MP Stella Creasy is <a href=\"http://www.w4mpjobs.org/JobDetails.aspx?jobid=37290\" title=\"\">recruiting a parliamentary researcher</a>. Aside from the generic skill requirements of \"excellent communication skills\" and the \"ability to prioritise tasks\", Creasy has said that applicants would benefit from a \"knowledge of mid- and late-90s indie music\". On the face of it, Pulp's Common People and Blur's Country House might well fit the politics of the Labour party, but it got me thinking more broadly about the relationship between my politics and my taste in music.</p> <p>Something rather wonderful happened to me on Monday. I walked into the green room before my appearance on <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01ng2qv\" title=\"\">Woman's Hour</a> and found myself shaking hands with Dionne Warwick. I have just about everything she has ever recorded in my CD collection. Don't Make Me Over, Make It Easy on Yourself and Walk on By were always played by the female DJ in the back room of a grotty pub in Leeds at our fundraisers for Lesbian Line, the support and friendship network I helped set up in the early 1980s when it was very isolating and scary to be out as a lesbian.</p> <p>Flicking through some vinyl I find David Bowie's Ziggy Stardust (1972). In my early teenage years, when I was being bullied at school, I would imagine how wonderful it must be to dress and behave against the grain and be revered, not laughed at, for it.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398240135\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/23/1350986291694/Julie-Bindel-goes-through-001.jpg\" alt=\"Julie Bindel goes through her record collection.\" width=\"200\" height=\"191\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Julie Bindel goes through her record collection.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Julie Bindel</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Bowie gave me my first insight into gender bending and the sense that difference was a positive. By the time Gloria Gaynor's I will Survive came out in 1978 I was a young feminist, hearing stories of the most horrific abuse of women and children at the hands of men.</p> <p>I took the words to mean surviving all kinds of atrocities (as opposed to heartbreak in a love affair which is what the song is about). Every fundraising and celebratory event we hold for Justice for Women ends with that song. It makes me cry.</p> <p>There is opera too, which is always a surprise to me. I used to be all class war about it until a friend dragged me to an outdoor Tosca in Italy, where nobody dressed up and they all ate ice cream and drank fizzy wine out of plastic cups. I came to love the melodramatic storyline and the tragic endings. It is like listening to an episode of Eastenders with beautiful singing.</p> <p>I hate R&amp;B but have a load of rap and hip hop, from Salt-N-Pepa, to Trina and Lil' Kim and, oh, Snoop Dogg. Yes, me, a radical feminist, loving an artist who raps about bitches and hos. What does that say about my politics?

Both agreed then it was time to act.</p> <p>But this year's vice-presidential contenders, Joe Biden and Paul Ryan, also failed to mention climate change during their single encounter, making for a total of six hours of primetime television debate without a single reference to climate change.</p> <p>The omission \u2013 or \"climate silence\" \u2013 has proved hugely frustrating to campaigners.</p> <p>It spawned <a href=\"http://climatesilence.org/\" title=\"\">a website</a> which urged Obama and Romney to give climate change <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/sep/10/uselections2008.hansen\" title=\"\">the attention it had in the 2008 election</a> and a petition drive before the first debate, which gathered 160,000 signatures demanding debate moderators put climate on the agenda.</p> <p>The two candidates did engage in a heated back-and-forth about gas prices in their town hall encounter last week. But the exchange saw Obama trying to one-up Romney in his support for oil and coal \u2013 fossil fuels rather than renewable sources of power.</p> <p>CNN's Candy Crowley, the debate moderator, <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/blogs/future_tense/2012/10/17/presidential_debate_candy_crowley_almost_asked_a_question_for_you_climate.html\" title=\"\">later told Slate</a> there had been questions from the audience about climate change, but she thought the economy was the priority.</p> <p>\"Climate change, I had that question,\" she was quoted as saying. \"All you climate change people. We just, you know, again, we knew that the economy was still the main thing.\"</p> <p>Her remarks set off a furious debate about the costs of climate change \u2013 including the $1bn price tag for each of more than a dozen extreme storms since 2011 and in the decades ahead.</p> <p>By Monday night, the debate about \"climate silence\" was in full voice. Al Gore weighed in, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/algore/status/260565096445644800\" title=\"\">tweeting during the course of the debate</a>: \"Where is global warming in this debate? Climate change is an urgent foreign policy issue.\"</p> <p>The Green party's presidential candidate, Jill Stein, went so far as to label Obama a climate change denier <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/oct/22/us-elections-barack-obama-climate-denial\" title=\"\">in an interview with the Guardian</a> for his failure to discuss the issue on the campaign trail.</p> <p>Other commentators argued allowances should be made for Obama's failure to discuss climate on the campaign trail, and his middling support for environmental concerns while in the White House.</p> <p>Since the rise of the Tea Party conservatives in 2010, energy and climate change have emerged as among the most contentious issues dividing Republicans and Democrats.</p> <p>The backlash from anti-government conservatives led Obama to downplay his green agenda, delaying and weakening environmental regulations. It also led to the adoption of what Obama called an \"all of the above\" energy strategy, which saw a role for expanded offshore oil drilling and domestic production, due to new techniques in hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/mar/22/keystone-xl-obama-fast-track-southern\" title=\"\">Obama also moved to fast-track the southern portion of the Keystone XL pipeline</a>, which will help step up Alberta's huge tar sands production.</p> <p>Administration officials, including Obama, began to avoid the very mention of climate change threats, opting instead to frame the issue in terms of the economic opportunities created by clean energy industries such as solar and wind power.</p> <p>Romney, meanwhile, responded to the rise of the Tea Party by backtracking on his earlier support for climate action as governor of Massachusetts. He also called for phasing out <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/blog/2012/oct/17/us-wind-power-mitt-romney-subsidy\" title=\"\">subsidies for the wind industry</a>.</p> <p>By the time of the Republican convention, Romney was using climate change as a laugh line, a way of tagging Obama with grandiosity for his 2008 election promise to help heal the planet.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/sep/07/barack-obama-mitt-romney-climate\" title=\"\">Obama hit back in his convention speech</a>, pledging to reduce the emissions which cause global warming. \"Climate change is not a hoax,\" he said. \"More droughts and floods and wildfires are not a joke. They are a threat to our children's future. And in this election you can do something about it.\"</p> <p>As a number of commentators noted at the time, it was Obama's most high-profile mention of climate change in months, if not years.</p> <p>Even so, the novelist <a href=\"http://90days90reasons.com/27.php\" title=\"\">Jonathan Franzen argued</a> that Obama \u2013 while a disappointment to campaigners \u2013 was still a better option on the environment than Romney.</p> <p>\"So give Obama a C-plus or even just a C on the environment if you like,\" Franzen wrote on the <a href=\"http://90days90reasons.com/index.php\" title=\"\">90 Days, 90 Reasons</a> blog.</p> <p>\"But consider that Mitt Romney, if he's elected, will nullify soundly based decisions by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA); he will continue to pretend that the science of climate change is uncertain; he will open up all federal lands (except, presumably, national parks) to the ravages of drilling and mining; he will roll back sensible regulation of pollution and habitat destruction; and he has shown, with his choice of Paul Ryan as a running mate, that he is serious about slashing funding for every federal program except the military \u2013 and you'd better believe that the EPA and Fish and Wildlife will be the first to be gutted. Mitt Romney will get an F, double-underlined in red ink.\"</p>",

He seemed to relax when the subject shifted to the economy, education and tax.</p> <p>One of the most vivid moments was when Obama, in a flash of arrogance, patronised his opponent, treating him as if he was a child. Lecturing him on military history after Romney complained the navy had fewer ships, Obama said: \"You mentioned the navy, for example, and that we have fewer ships than we did in 1916. Well, governor, we also have fewer horses and bayonets, because the nature of our military's changed. We have these things called aircraft carriers, where planes land on them. We have these ships that go underwater, nuclear submarines.\"</p> <p>Will this debate make a difference? Probably not. Although Romney was poor, he was not disastrously bad. And he got across his message that he is not belligerent. Talking about Iran, he said the US \"can't kill our way out of this mess\". That is what a war-weary America wants to hear. An attack on Iran would be a last resort, Romney said. He made peace a central part of his closing speech.</p> <p>Neither Obama or Romney made any serious gaffes or produced any zingers.&#xa0;The first debate in Denver, where Obama was overwhelmed, was a game-changer. But neither this one nor the one in New York have had the same impact or are likely to. The debates in New York and Florida have seen Obama climb back aboard the campaign but his performances have not been strong enough to determine the election outcome.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-10-23T02:54:49.367Z\">at 3.54am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5086042c58f96784ee29093d\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-23T02:42:53.145Z\">3.42am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Well that was easily the worst debate of the four we've had.

Nothing also on the EU or the euro-zone crisis, unless you count Mitt Romney's silly claim that America is going to end up like Greece unless he's elected.</p> <p>Anyway, I'd say Romney won it because he just lashed away at Obama without regard to subject or logic, showed that he knew enough about what passes for foreign policy that he's not going to fart in front of the Queen or whatever. And Obama did what he did in the first debate: lay out Romney's multiple positions and expect that would be enough.

It's not very likely that Israel's own nuclear arsenal will come up in the inevitable criticism of Obama's handling of Iran's as yet non-existent atom bombs.</p> <p>You won't hear the Republican candidate demand the president justify the kill list he endorses each Tuesday which names those sentenced without trial or a modicum of due process to be obliterated by American drones. There won't even be a question about the hundreds, perhaps thousands, of innocents also butchered by the unseen and unmanned war planes.</p> <p>Neither will you hear Romney press Obama over the dubious legal process underway at Guantanamo where military judges have blocked alleged terrorists on trial for their lives from talking about the tortures they were subjected to by the CIA and American military.</p> <p>And then there are the friends of perpetual US administrations who get a pass on America's self proclaimed commitment to freedom. Don't expect Romney to pin Obama down over relations with Gulf oil sheikhs or African dictators with lots of the black stuff under their feet. </p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-a23068a3-f499-45b5-86d0-83605df80af0\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/10/1349894447950/9ce0807e-21e4-4ee3-aba2-e7f28402de0f-460.jpeg\" alt=\"Palestine and Israeli conflict\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A Palestinian man from the West Bank village of Burin, throws stones at Jewish settlers of Bracha settlement during clashes in Burin.

  "<p>Dozens of Tamil asylum seekers have lodged emergency appeals in the high court to stop their deportation to Sri Lanka for fear they will be tortured on their return.</p> <p>Solicitors acting for clients due to be removed on Tuesday on a special charter flight for the UK Border Agency (UKBA) have issued judges with case files in 11th hour appeals in London.</p> <p>Citing <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/jun/05/tamils-deported-sri-lanka-torture\" title=\"\">previous evidence of torture for Tamils who have returned to Sri Lanka</a>, one lawyer told the Guardian that UKBA had already agreed to take two of his clients off the impending flight expected to leave on Tuesday afternoon.</p> <p>Kulasegaram Geetharthanan from Jein solicitors said he'd lodged applications on behalf of three further deportees and he believed between 10 and 15 other solicitors had lodged similar claims.</p> <p>He said the cases were lodged on asylum grounds and human rights. \"They are victims of torture and sustained visible scars and the [Sri Lankan] authorities have their records.
