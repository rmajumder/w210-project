  "<p>The Conservatives' first full reshuffle has left the cabinet slightly more male, more Oxbridge, with fewer people from ethnic minorities and with a more pronounced southern bias.</p> <p>Though the demographics are only slightly changed by the reshuffle, the new cabinet makes David Cameron's goal to have women in one third of government posts by the end of this parliament remote, and his wider modernisation agenda \u2013 to make the party more appealing to non-white voters, people outside the traditional, southern Tory heartlands, lesbian, gay and other minority groups \u2013 more difficult.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2012/sep/04/cabinet-reshuffle-coalition-cameron-data\" title=\"\">Analysis by the Guardian</a> reveals the changes between the new and old cabinets. The changes are dominated by Cameron's reshuffle since the Liberal Democrat leader, Nick Clegg, left his five cabinet members unchanged.</p> <p>The cabinet is two posts bigger and more Tory after the former justice secretary Ken Clarke and ex-party chairman Lady Warsi both remained in the cabinet.</p> <p>But the detail is possibly more telling about the struggle Cameron is having modernising his party at the top.</p> <p>Before Tuesday's changes, there were five women among the 29 full cabinet members, all of them Conservatives. Caroline Spelman and Cheryl Gillan have lost their seats in cabinet; Maria Miller and Theresa Villiers have been brought in and Warsi was demoted to a minister who attends cabinet but does not vote. On balance the number of women remained the same, but there are two more seats for men at the table.</p> <p>The shadow equalities minister, Yvette Cooper, tweeted: \"So looks like 3 of 5 women (Spelman, Gillan, Warsi) &amp; 1 of 19 men (Young) sacked from cabinet posts. Shows Cameron's attitude to women.\"</p> <p>Ceri Goddard, chief executive of the Fawcett Society, also attacked Cameron's lack of progress. \"Despite near universal acceptance that we need more \u2013 not less \u2013 involvement of women in building our economy, the prime minister has chosen to further marginalise women's influence on politics,\" said Goddard. \"Sweden, Switzerland and France all have equal numbers of men and women in their cabinets. Why can't we?\"</p> <p>Some of the party's female MPs were more pragmatic, however, stressing the importance of promoting women from the big influx of 2010 into junior ministerial ranks to prepare them for future cabinets. \"The PM has limited room for manoeuvre at the top end and has done the best he can by promoting both Maria Miller and Theresa Villiers, [and] at the junior ministerial level I am hopeful we will see more women appointed some of whom have great potential,\" said Margot James, a party deputy chairman, who also welcomed the promotion of a Lib Dem female MP, Jo Swinson.</p> <p>Penny Mordaunt, a new MP and member of the defence select committee, also warned against token women's appointments: \"As with chaps it must be on merit, expertise, talent and their ability to deliver.\"</p> <p>Warsi's move demotes the only non-white member of the cabinet, and the promotion of Chris Grayling appears to put two opponents of expanding gay rights in the cabinet since he sits alongside Owen Paterson, who has spoken publicly against legalising gay marriage.</p> <p>After two years of jibes about the party being led by southern posh boys, epitomised by the infamous photos of George Osborne and David Cameron in the tails of Oxford's Bullingdon drinking club, the Tory side of the cabinet has lost its majority of public schoolboys, with two more members from grammars and two more from state schools, though the number of Oxbridge graduates is slightly higher. Meanwhile there are the same number of northern MPs, but more secretaries of state born in or representing southern constituencies \u2013 despite the border being so far south that Birmingham qualifies as \"north\".</p>",
  "<p>The UN refugee agency has reported a dramatic increase in the number of people fleeing the violence in Syria after more than 100,000 people sought asylum in neighbouring countries during August.</p> <p>This brings the total number of Syrian refugees registered or awaiting registration to more than 235,300.</p> <p>The UNHCR's chief spokeswoman, Melissa Fleming, said the exit of 103,416 Syrians last month was \"a significant escalation in refugee movement and people seeking asylum, and probably points to a very precarious and violent situation inside the country\".</p> <p>As a result, UN agencies are likely to face pressure to revise their $193m (\u00a3122m) estimate of the cost of helping the refugees this year. That figure \u2013 in June \u2013 was based on expectations that there would be 185,000 refugees from Syria by the end of 2012.</p> <p>Among neighbouring countries, Iraq has seen a significant increase in the number of Syrian Kurds arriving in the past week, with an estimated 500 Syrians crossing each day, compared with 500 a week in the first three weeks of August, the UNHCR says.</p> <p>In Jordan, where there are already more than 77,000 refugees, Syrians continue to arrive at a rate of about 1,000 a day. The Jordanian government and relief agencies are making preparations for as many as 150,000 people.</p> <p>There are more than 80,000 refugees in Turkey where the UNHCR says the Turkish government is making plans to handle at least 150,000 refugees if the conflict keeps worsening.</p> <p>In Lebanon, there are more than 59,000 displaced Syrians who are registered or are awaiting registration. This week the UNHCR is opening a mobile registration centre in Baalbek in the eastern Bekaa valley in response to the increasing number of displaced Syrians who are arriving in the area.</p> <p>On Tuesday, Peter Maurer, head of the International Committee of the Red Cross, met the Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad, in Damascus.</p> <p>According to the ICRC, Assad gave a positive reaction to plans to expand humanitarian operations in Syria. Maurer stressed the need for improved access to healthcare, and to speed up imports of medical supplies, food and equipment.</p> <p>However, Syria's state-run news agency, Sana, suggested Assad had showed some scepticism about the international organisation's neutrality. It said Assad \"welcomes Red Cross humanitarian operations in Syria as long as it works independently and neutrally\".</p> <p>Sana also claimed that Maurer had \"expressed his appreciation for the co-operation shown by the Syrian government, praising the bridges of trust that have been built between the parties\".</p> <p>In other developments on Tuesday, Germany's foreign minister, Guido Westerwelle, called on Syria's disparate Syrian opposition groups to unite in preparation for the collapse of the Assad regime.</p> <p>Westerwelle said a common platform was urgently needed, and that the people of Syria must see \"there is a credible alternative to the regime\". He called on the opposition \"to create as fast as possible the conditions for&#xa0;\u2026 a transition government.\"</p> <p>Meanwhile, Abdel Basset Sayda, the head of the opposition Syrian National Council, called for a post-Assad economic recovery plan.</p> <p>\"In the aftermath of the destruction&#xa0;\u2026 we are convinced Syria needs a Marshall-style plan to ensure it stands again on solid financial and economic ground,\" Sayda said in Berlin.</p> <p>\"Without real comprehensive development we will open up the opportunity for the growth of all kinds of extremism in the region,\" he said.</p>",
  "<p>Celebrity backers of Julian Assange have lost \u00a3200,000 in bail money they put up for the WikiLeaks founder, it has been confirmed.</p> <p>At a hearing at Westminster magistrates court on Tuesday, district judge Howard Riddle adjourned a further hearing until October to decide whether nine other backers should also lose their money, after Assange fled an attempt to extradite him to Sweden last June.</p> <p>At Tuesday's proceedings, a court clerk told reporters that a \u00a3200,000 security pot given to the court before Assange was bailed \u2013 and believed to have been paid into by high-profile backers, including Jemima Khan, film directors Ken Loach and Michael Moore, and millionaire publisher Felix Dennis \u2013 had been forfeited at an earlier hearing in July.</p> <p>Assange skipped bail in June and took refuge in the Ecuadorean embassy in Knightsbridge, London, in defiance of an order to have him extradited to Sweden to face allegations of rape. He has claimed the Swedish extradition request is a ruse to facilitate his onward extradition the US, where he could face the death penalty.</p> <p>Last month Ecuador's president, Rafael Correa, granted him asylum and said the 41-year-old Australian could remain at its London embassy indefinitely.</p> <p>Journalist Phillip Knightley, Caroline Evans \u2013 the wife of former Labour minister Lord Evans \u2013 Nobel prize-winning biologist Sir John Sulston and Frontline Club founder Vaughan Smith, who also allowed Assange to stay with him at his Norfolk mansion during extradition proceedings, were among those who pledged sureties \u2013 a promise to pay the court \u2013 of \u00a320,000 each. All nine of those listed in Tuesday's hearing had pledged a total of \u00a3140,000. All in all, Assange's backers could lose \u00a3340,000.</p> <p>Adjourning the hearing until 3 October, Riddle said those guaranteeing bail had a month to persuade Assange to surrender to police if they wanted their money back.</p> <p>\"At the moment I'm not persuaded that any reasonable surety would not be using every effort, publicly and privately, to persuade Mr Assange to surrender himself to UK authorities,\" he said.</p> <p>He said it found it \"absolutely striking\" that none of the nine had attended court in person.</p> <p>Henry Blaxland QC, representing four of the sureties, said Vaughan Smith was making a documentary with the British army in Afghanistan, while Evans is on holiday in Italy.</p> <p>The judge noted that \"we have no explanation from others and no particular reason to believe that they want to be here\".</p> <p>Blaxland argued there was \"no evidence that any of the sureties are to blame for Mr Assange's failure to surrender\" adding that the event could not have been predicted by those putting up bail money.</p> <p>\"It was an extraordinary thing to do. Nobody could reasonably have foreseen that's what he would do,\" he said and urged that the hearing be postponed indefinitely.</p> <p>\"Given the drama at the Ecuadorean embassy has not yet reached the final act, perhaps one should wait to see what does happen,\" Blaxland said.</p> <p>Blaxland also argued that since Ecuador had granted him asylum the court should \"consider in deciding whether his failure to surrender to police is wholly unreasonable\".</p> <p>Riddle initially refused the adjournment but later allowed a further three weeks so the sureties had a chance to fight for their money.</p>",
  "<p>Social and personal psychologists typically list a handful of key actions that can help improve personal wellbeing but would they really stand up to being tested for planet friendliness too?</p> <p>One of the most respected of such lists is the government's <a href=\"http://www.neweconomics.org/publications/five-ways-well-being-evidence\" title=\"\">Five ways to wellbeing</a> which came out of research co-ordinated by the <a href=\"http://www.neweconomics.org/\" title=\"\">New Economics foundation</a>, as part of the <a href=\"http://www.bis.gov.uk/foresight\" title=\"\">Foresight report</a>. The five actions are: </p> <p>1. connect (with people, not technology)<br>2. be active<br>3. take notice <br>4. keep learning<br>5. give</p> <h2>Connect</h2> <p>When we have good relationships with people, we frequently end up sharing resources such as houses, meals or lifts. A house that keeps four people warm rather than one, or an oven that cooks a meal for a group, uses significantly less energy per person. What is more, the connected person is likely to be healthier and use up fewer resources from the health service, the emergency services and social security.</p> <p>\"The evidence is absolutely clear,\" says Felicia Huppert, director of the <a href=\"http://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;ved=0CCMQFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.cambridgewellbeing.org%2F&amp;ei=st5FUNXyGOr80QWslYCICw&amp;usg=AFQjCNGLFnukYBxVuWb734O1xcAKo1B33g\" title=\"\">Wellbeing Institute</a> at Cambridge University, and a contributor to the Foresight report, \"that social isolation increases ill health and death rates.\"</p> <h2>Be active</h2> <p>Of the five actions, this is the one most obviously linked to greener behaviour: being active and exercising will mean you are more likely to walk or cycle than drive. So while your footprints on the pavement and health will increase, the footprint that matters for the environment - your carbon footprint - will reduce.</p> <p>\"Research has now shown it's not that exercise is an anti-depressant, but more that not being active makes us depressed because we are evolved to be active,\" says Huppert.</p> <p>Being active also helps you connect: those who live in more walkable neighbourhoods in, say, Galway, Ireland, are much more likely than those in car-dependent suburbs to know their neighbours and to trust others. (And, astonishingly, having a sense of community provides more sense of wellbeing than the effect of trebling household income.)</p> <h2>Take notice</h2> <p>We all benefit from stopping for a moment to take notice \u2013 both of the external world and our inner world. We probably do not need to \"stop and stare as long as sheep, or cows\", as William Henry Davies would have us do in his poem, Leisure, but a moment to take stock can help us live in the now, rather than in the past or the future. Linked to the concept of mindfulness (with roots in Buddhism, Christianity and many other religions), the idea is that if we stop to notice the bird song or a passing cloud, we get in touch with ourselves and our physical world \u2013 what environmental psychologists define as \"nature relatedness\". The more you relate to nature, the more positive your emotions and the greater your life satisfaction.</p> <p>In <a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/ S0169204610001465\" title=\"\">a Canadian study</a>, people who walked from A to B on a tree-lined path by a river were systematically happier than those walking the same trip via an underground tunnel system. And students and hospital patients who can see green out of their windows do better than those who do not.</p> <p>How this all benefits the planet is obvious: the more humans care about nature, the more they are likely to take actions to protect it.</p> <h2>Keep learning</h2> <p>Those with more open minds are happier, not only because they stay mentally vigorous but also because they gain a renewed sense of mastery.</p> <p>They are also more ready to adopt and adapt to our changing world. So they will be the people who accept, rather than ignore or resist, ideas such as warnings that the polar ice is disappearing and that we need to act.</p> <h2>Give</h2> <p>It is now well established by psychologists that the act of doing things for others actually makes us happier than receiving \u2013 although experts say this is, somewhat surprisingly, not readily accepted by most people. Giving can be something more abstract than volunteering or supporting a charity: \"It can be about thinking ahead and how to give a healthy planet to future generations, as yet unborn,\" says Huppert.</p> <p>The other key point listed on most happiness lists is that, beyond a certain level of material security, more money does not increase wellbeing. In the West, GDP has doubled in the last 35 years while wellbeing has barely budged.</p> <p>Of course, not every aspect of being happy has environmental benefits: getting a good exam grade makes you happy but does not help the planet, while buying a fast car can make you happy but is detrimental to the environment. But, overall, I feel pretty convinced by the evidence: that sorting out our mental state can help the environment, and that working to combat environmental damage can help make us happier.</p> <p>From Gandhi to Schumacher, and the former leader of the Green party, Caroline Lucas, to academics such as <a href=\"http://scorai2012.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/ helliwell-final.pdf\" title=\"\">John Halliwell</a> and <a href=\"http://www.ogilvie.fastmail.co.uk/healthyfuture/convergent.html\" title=\"\">Sandra Carlisle</a>, environmental thinkers have stressed the need to find routes other than material consumption to personal wellbeing. If we are to find ways of closing the north/south income gap without putting further pressure on the environment, we need as many tools in our toolkit as possible.</p> <p>So how about, as we look to promote a change in our consumerist lifestyles, selling it as a route to true happiness?</p> <p><em>Charlotte Sankey runs Creative Warehouse, a publishing and communications consultancy specialising in the environment, arts and education.</em></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by </strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/guardian-professional\" title=\"Guardian Professional\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

  "<p>The contrast between the Democrats and Republicans couldn't be sharper when comparing the policy platforms adopted by the two parties at their respective national conventions. But the more revealing comparison is between the <a href=\"http://www.democrats.org/democratic-national-platform\">Democratic party platform of 2012</a> and its 2008 edition.</p> <p>Between the two parties this year, gay marriage, abortion, comprehensive immigration reform, healthcare and welfare spending all offer clear and distinct policy differences. In each case the Democrats are in favour and the Republicans are against.</p> <p>Although the official party platforms carry no real weight, with candidates free to adopt or discard them as they see fit, they do highlight one important point: while the Republican platform differs from that of the official Romney/Ryan ticket positions in a number of places, most notably on abortion, it would be hard to insert a \"Obama-Biden 2012\" bumper sticker between the Democratic platform and the presidential ticket.</p> <p>Aside from the political potshots the Democratic platform aims at Mitt Romney, the most significant new language is in its ringing endorsement of gay marriage, which largely aligns with Barack Obama's own recently changed stance. The 2012 platform reads:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We support marriage equality and support the movement to secure equal treatment under law for same-sex couples \u2026 We oppose discriminatory federal and state constitutional amendments and other attempts to deny equal protection of the laws to committed same-sex couples who seek the same respect and responsibilities as other married couples.</p> <p>We support the full repeal of the so-called Defense of Marriage Act [Doma] and the passage of the Respect for Marriage Act.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=78283\">That's a shift from the 2008 platform</a>, which skated over the issue with vague language of supporting \"equal responsibility, benefits, and protections\".</p> <p>Under the Obama administration, the department of justice has stopped defending Doma, but there have been no moves towards repealing it. That's unlikely to change soon, barring a dramatic change in the make-up of the House of Representatives.</p> <p>But the 2012 and 2008 editions differ most markedly over national security and civil liberties, especially the closure of the notorious US prison site at Guantanamo Bay; overturning the post 9/11 anti-terrorism laws such as the Patriot Act and trying alleged terrorists through domestic US courts. In 2008 the Democratic party unequivocally stated:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We will not ship away prisoners in the dead of night to be tortured in far-off countries, or detain without trial or charge prisoners who can and should be brought to justice for their crimes, or maintain a network of secret prisons to jail people beyond the reach of the law.</p> <p>We will respect the time-honored principle of habeas corpus, the seven century-old right of individuals to challenge the terms of their own detention that was recently reaffirmed by our supreme court.</p> <p>We will close the detention camp in Guant\u00e1namo Bay, the location of so many of the worst constitutional abuses in recent years.</p> </blockquote> <p>After struggling and failing to meet his own deadline to close Guant\u00e1namo and move terrorism trials to the mainland, and now influenced perhaps by the unhappy realities of being in office, Obama's policy as laid out in the 2012 platform speaks in measured tones of \"checks and balances\":</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Advancing our interests may involve new actions and policies to confront threats like terrorism, but the president and the Democratic party believe these practices must always be in line with our Constitution, preserve our people's privacy and civil liberties, and withstand the checks and balances that have served us so well. That is why the president banned torture without exception in his first week in office. That is why we are reforming military commissions to bring them in line with the rule of law. That is why we are substantially reducing the population at Guant\u00e1namo Bay without adding to it.</p> <p>And we remain committed to working with all branches of government to close the prison altogether because it is inconsistent with our national security interests and our values.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://www.politico.com/blogs/under-the-radar/2012/09/democratic-platform-again-seeks-guantanamo-closure-134261.html\">Politico's Josh Gerstein points out</a> that \"aside from the non-specific mention of 'new actions and policies' related to terrorism, there's no explicit reference in the new platform to Obama's dramatically ramped up use of drone strikes to kill suspected terrorists\".</p> <p>On Afghanistan, the 2008 platform's bold talk of educating Afghan girls and rebuilding the country's economy \"from the bottom up\" has disappeared, replaced in the 2012 platform by grim, pragmatic language of reversing the Taliban's momentum and giving Afghans \"the time and space to build the capacity of their security forces\" while preparing for the withdrawal of US forces by 2014.</p> <p>The 2012 platform also responds aggressively to a new threat: the Citizens United supreme court ruling that opened a gusher of untrammeled money into American politics. \"We support campaign finance reform, by constitutional amendment if necessary,\" is the platform position, one that President Obama announced last week.</p> <p>In all, the 2012 Democratic platform is recognisably related to its predecessor but, like the campaign it represents, it is indelibly stamped with the political pragmatism and rolled-back rhetoric of the Obama administration's four years in office.</p>",

  "<h2>Best of this week's news</h2> <p>Regular readers of this column will be used to foot-in-mouth remarks from comedians, upsetting interest groups on a weekly basis in the name of publicity. Until now, however, none of them had actually declared war in the most geopolitically sensitive region on Earth. Step forward John Cleese, who is attracting opprobrium for filming <a href=\"http://www.suchsmallportions.com/news/john-cleeses-israeli-nut-ad-endorses-bombing-iran\" title=\"\">an advert in which he plays an Israeli general ordering the bombing of Iran</a>. In the ad, for HaSachar Haole's Sababa Egozim chocoloate spread, Cleese's military man is so moved by that confection's sweet and nutty taste, he shouts out its name \u2013 which translates roughly as \"Let's go nuts!\" His underlings take this to sanction an all-out attack on the enemy, and the ad ends to the sound of missiles being fired. Cleese was reportedly paid $50,000 for the commercial.</p> <p>A more commendable example of Cleese's output also comes to light this week, in the form of a trailer for the Monty Python team's animated film about their late colleague Graham Chapman, <a href=\"http://splitsider.com/2012/08/check-out-the-fun-trippy-trailer-for-graham-chapman-a-liars-autobiography/\" title=\"\">A Liar's Autobiography</a>.

And stop being retarded x.\"</p> <p>Fielding was duly replied to by a certain Miss Spidey, who took umbrage at his Gervais-esque use of language. The comedian \u2013 temporarily abandoning the charming flights of surrealist fancy that made his name \u2013 riposted by calling Miss Spidey a \"dumb fuck\". And, of course, his fans joined in, as Miss Spidey relates on <a href=\"http://spiderplantland.co.uk/noel-fielding-is-a-coward/\" title=\"\">her blog on the subject</a>. \"150+ of his followers decided that I was fair game and started tweeted [sic] some pretty offensive stuff directly at me. A few threatened to have me killed or commit the act themselves \u2026\" <a href=\"http://www.channel4.com/programmes/noel-fieldings-luxury-comedy\" title=\"\">Luxury Comedy</a>, it wasn't \u2013 as Fielding seemed to recognise, backtracking fast online (\"I guess Twitter is a good idea in concept but not in reality\") and insisting that \"I literally meant retarded in the sense of slow or delayed thinking\".</p> <h2>Over to you \u2013 my pick of the week's reader comments</h2> <p>John Harris's article on the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/sep/02/frankie-boyle-pseudo-media-storm\" title=\"\">row over Frankie Boyle's Paralympics remarks</a> prompted a predictably lively response, including these thoughts from <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/18042408\" title=\"\">malasangra</a>.</p> <blockquote> A good [article], but one that isn't likely to be heard by the newspaper industry which makes its living from manufacturing pompous faux outrage. All newspapers need somebody to be angry about. Boyle is just providing them with the material they want and making a lot of money out of the \"bad boy comedian\" image it helps maintain. <br> I like \"edgy\", iconoclastic humour. I laughed out loud at some of his naughtier jokes on Mock the Week, but I was deeply disappointed when I sat down to <a href=\"http://www.channel4.com/programmes/frankie-boyles-tramadol-nights\" title=\"\">Tramadol Nights</a> and realised that tasteless shock factor jokes were all he had. The future looks bleak for him, because most of his fan base will have finished puberty and started maturing into adults within a couple of years. </blockquote> <p>Elsewhere, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2012/aug/30/comedy-gold-tim-minchin\" title=\"\">Leo Benedictus's overview of the comedy of Tim Minchin</a> sparked a debate as to where Minchin stood in relation to old-school musical comics, such as Tom Lehrer. According to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/18002388\" title=\"\">bachemobile</a> :</p> <blockquote> Purely in terms of pianistic technique, Minchin's probably more proficient at the fiddly bits than Lehrer, but that's not really the point of songwriting, and certainly not comic songwriting. Lehrer's great strength IMO (and one of the reasons he'll still be listened to years from now) is his ability to gel together music and lyrics/message: Oediupus Rex would only be half as funny without the incongruous accompaniment. <br> Plus his tunes are memorable in their own right (if only because he ripped them off from the styles he was satirising: I was humming I Wanna Get Back to Dixie just the other day!  On the other hand, the Minchin songs I've heard, while amusing, haven't stuck with me as much as the TL ones, I think because the songs lack the same hooks and easy memorability. </blockquote> <p>Finally, readers had their say on TV's latest contributions to the nation's gaiety, after Sam Wollaston's reviews of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2012/aug/28/hunderby-harrys-mountain-heroes\" title=\"\">Julia Davis's Hunderby and Adil Ray's much-discussed Citizen Khan</a>. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/17944024\" title=\"\">Plankton</a> had this to say about the former:</p> <blockquote> Hunderby was *brilliant*, it managed to out period drama pretty much every period drama for quite some time without even trying to! Perfect casting, sets, costumes etc and the humour was so underplayed and subtle it was a refreshing change from Julia Davis whom I love, but sometimes takes a joke too far. It was very, very clever to get all the performances and direction pitch perfect, as a few inches to the left and it's a French &amp; Saunders sketch with buxom wenches and \"But Sire!\" Oh, it was *brilliant*. I'm tuning in for the drama as much as the comedy, it reminds me of Green Wing in that respect. Can't wait for episode 2! </blockquote> <p>But that French and Saunders comparison was just the problem for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/17959482\" title=\"\">SirJohnDanvers</a>:</p> <blockquote> If Hunderby had been written by French and Saunders (who did this kind of thing 20 yrs ago) the Guardian would wretch [sic] all over it. </blockquote> <p>Meanwhile, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/17948253\" title=\"\">CaptainJory</a> dismissed Citizen Khan in terms that were widely echoed elsewhere:</p> <blockquote> I had been looking forward to Citizen Khan but it was a real let-down, although not entirely unexpected having watched the trailer. About 30 years too late, both in terms of its predictable jokes and its observations of British Asian life. I really don't understand what it was trying to achieve by regurgitating stereotypes that don't apply any more. The plastic sofa covers, the old Merc, etc, etc, none of this is particularly relevant now. Good job in feeding age-old misconceptions. <br> It was painfully unfunny and full of jokes that have been done to death before; parking in a disabled bay then hobbling off, accidentally speaking over the tannoy, forgetting to book the wedding venue, the favourite daughter who pretends to be good, etc, etc. I wonder what we'll get next week, some curry jokes, a mother-in-law, some Bollywood-style dancing perhaps. </blockquote>",
  "<h2>The winners</h2> <p>The last weekend of the school summer holiday has never exactly been a premium release date in the UK: over the past couple of years we've seen such venerated classics as <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2011/sep/01/fright-night-film-review\" title=\"\">Fright Night</a>, Apollo 18 and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2010/sep/02/dinner-for-schmucks-film-review\" title=\"\">Dinner for Schmucks</a> dumped on to the market. So this year's batch of end-of-summer releases, while hardly eliciting critical hosannas or audience stampedes, is certainly no worse than usual. Between them, new releases <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/148835/total-recall\" title=\"\">Total Recall</a> and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/148836/watch\" title=\"\">The Watch</a> kicked in \u00a34.7m in box-office, pushing aside Brave to grab the top two spots in the weekend chart.</p> <p>It's worth noting, however, that both saw their figures inflated by significant previews: two days' worth in the case of Total Recall (\u00a3959,000 of the \u00a32.49m total) and four days for The Watch (\u00a31.43m of the \u00a32.24m). Total Recall's sum compares with \u00a31.90m for the first weekend of wide play for the Paul Verhoeven original \u2013 and that was back in 1990, when tickets were significantly cheaper than today. As for The Watch, Ben Stiller's last film <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/144194/tower-heist\" title=\"\">Tower Heist</a> debuted with \u00a31.45m including \u00a3311,000 in previews last November.</p> <p>Excluding previews from the tallies, The Watch in fact landed in lowly fifth place, with \u00a3803,000. That's behind fellow new entrant The Possession, which debuted just shy of \u00a31m, as well as holdover titles Brave and Ted. With \u00a317.9m so far, Brave has already overtaken Pixar's worst-performing titles Cars (\u00a316.5m) and Cars 2 (\u00a315.6m), and now has Disney's Tangled (\u00a320.5m) in its sights. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/148370/ted\" title=\"\">Ted</a>, with \u00a328.1m, is closing in on <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/video/2012/jul/13/ice-age-4-continental-drift-video-review\" title=\"\">Ice Age 4: Continental Drift</a> (\u00a329.1m) to become the third-biggest box-office hit of 2012 so far.</p> <h2>The losers</h2> <p>Biggest faller in the chart, with a drop of 69%, is <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/148902/keith-lemon\" title=\"\">Keith Lemon: The Film</a>. Critical ratings were predictably horrendous (<a href=\"http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/keith_lemon_the_film/\" title=\"\">0% fresh at Rotten Tomatoes</a>). More challenging for distributor Lionsgate are user ratings of 2.5 out of 10 at IMDb, and 1.7 out of 5 at Rotten Tomatoes. Assuming these ratings are by people who actually saw the film, the TV spinoff is not set for a sustained healthy life at cinemas. The DVD should be in stores for Christmas.</p> <p>Lionsgate may take comfort that Keith Lemon in week two still managed to gross more than rival comedy <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/149067/few-best-men\" title=\"\">A Few Best Men</a> in its debut. The Australia-set film, which could be pitched as The Hangover meets Meet the Parents, kicked off with a weak \u00a3264,000 from 291 screens, and an average of \u00a3906. It surely can't help that there are currently five comedies in the market \u2013 the others are Ted, The Watch and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/147184/three-stooges\" title=\"\">The Three Stooges</a> \u2013 playing on a combined 1,900 screens.</p> <h2>The arthouse battle</h2> <p>Given <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/145816/imposter\" title=\"\">The Imposter</a>'s impressive debut the previous weekend, and its expansion to 77 screens, a solid hold was always likely. But it faced potentially tough competition from the newly arrived <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/148212/berberian-sound-studio\" title=\"\">Berberian Sound Studio</a>, which benefited from similar critical acclaim, including <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2012/aug/30/berberian-sound-studio-review\" title=\"\">five stars from the Guardian's Peter Bradshaw</a>. In the event, The Imposter won the spoils, not just with a bigger weekend gross (\u00a3212,000 v \u00a343,000), but also a higher screen average (\u00a32,755 v \u00a31,871). Partly thanks to the expansion, The Imposter posted the most robust hold of any film in the top 20, down just 5%. Although not benefiting from the same critical buzz as Berberian, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/143130/samsara\" title=\"\">Samsara</a> achieved a virtually identical sum at the box office. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/143110/take-this-waltz\" title=\"\">Take This Waltz</a> and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/147796/searching-for-sugar-man\" title=\"\">Searching for Sugar Man</a> are also both hanging on in the top 30, and have now reached \u00a3284,000 and \u00a3331,000 respectively. The success of these five films, catering to the tastes of most arthouse film fans, created a tough environment for competitor titles. After several weeks of play, both <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2012/aug/09/360-review\" title=\"\">360</a> and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2012/aug/09/jackpot-review\" title=\"\">Jackpot</a> have yet to pass \u00a3100,000, for example, and see the Other openers chart below for the very modest sum earned at the weekend by US indie <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/139141/myth-of-the-american-sleepover\" title=\"\">The Myth of the American Sleepover</a>.</p> <p>Berberian Sound Studio's opening compares with \u00a329,000 from 17 screens for the debut of Peter Strickland's previous feature <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/130512/katalin-varga\" title=\"\">Katalin Varga</a>, back in October 2009. The Imposter's tally of \u00a3694,000 after two weekends compares with \u00a3493,000 for <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/146456/marley\" title=\"\">Marley</a> at the same stage. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/141505/senna\" title=\"\">Senna</a> had taken a highly impressive \u00a31.1m at this point in its run, by which time it was already playing at 122 cinemas.</p> <h2>The future</h2> <p>Overall, the market proved to be the very definition of middling: 2% up from the previous weekend; 1% up on the equivalent frame from 2011; and 3% down on average weekend takings for the past year. With most kids returning to school this week, the autumn movie season now kicks off with the arrival on Friday of prestige fare including Joe Wright's Tolstoy adaptation <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/149093/anna-karenina\" title=\"\">Anna Karenina</a> and John Hillcoat's prohibition-era crime saga <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/146652/lawless\" title=\"\">Lawless</a>. Not so prestigiously, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/149147/dredd\" title=\"\">Dredd</a> offers violent genre pleasures, and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/146343/that-s-my-boy\" title=\"\">That's My Boy</a> is the latest comedy from Adam Sandler. Acclaimed documentary <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/149068/queen-of-versailles\" title=\"\">The Queen of Versailles</a> and Berlin film festival discovery Tabu enter the cluttered arthouse space. All titles face a potentially dangerous adversary in the weather \u2013 at the end of a disappointing summer, hours of sunshine tend to be especially cherished, and not to be frittered away by visits to darkened cineplexes.</p> <h2>Top 10 films</h2> <p><strong>1.</strong> <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/80204/total-recall\" title=\"\">Total Recall</a>, \u00a32,493,230 from 464 sites (<strong>New</strong>)</p> <p><strong>2.</strong> <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/148836/watch\" title=\"\">The Watch</a>, \u00a32,235,933 from 419 sites (<strong>New</strong>)</p> <p><strong>3.</strong> <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/146821/brave\" title=\"\">Brave</a>, \u00a31,604,163 from 548 sites.

  "<p>It was a cry, raw and anguished, that pierced the convivial party atmosphere and laid bare the sense of anomie gnawing away at South Africa.</p> <p>The archbishop emeritus Desmond Tutu had an emotional outburst on Monday night as he castigated politicians for greed, failing schools and the \"nightmare\" of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/16/south-african-police-shoot-striking-miners\" title=\"\">Marikana mine massacre</a>. His impromptu speech shocked guests at a book launch in Cape Town, according to <a href=\"http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/Tutu-shocks-audience-with-outburst-20120904\" title=\"\">local media reports</a>, which said a \"chatty audience\" including senior government officials was immediately silenced.</p> <p>Reports vary on his exact opening words, but a spokesman for Tutu indicated that he shouted: \"What the heck are you doing?\"</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.beeld.com/Suid-Afrika/Nuus/Wat-de-drommel-doen-julle-20120903\" title=\"\">Beeld newspaper</a> then quoted a highly emotional Tutu as saying: \"I am 80 years old. Can't you allow us elders to go to our graves with a smile, knowing that this is a good country? Because truly \u2013 it is a good country.\"</p> <p>Tutu, a Nobel peace laureate described as the moral conscience of South Africa, has not been afraid to criticise the governing African National Congress (ANC), for example over the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/oct/04/tutu-attacks-anc-dalai-lama-visa\" title=\"\">refusal to grant the Dalai Lama an entrance visa</a>.</p> <p>On Monday he was at the District Six museum for the launch of the struggle veteran Michael Lapsley's book Redeeming the Past, along with guests including Marius Fransman, the deputy foreign minister, and other high-ranking figures.</p> <p>Lapsley was an ANC chaplain who lost an eye and both hands to a parcel bomb sent by the apartheid regime. Later, speaking from the podium, Tutu expressed frustration at the betrayal of such sacrifices after the dawn of multiracial democracy in 1994.</p> <p>\"Is this the kind of freedom people were tortured and people were maimed for?\" he was quoted as saying. \"I ask myself, why were we in the struggle? The highest price was paid for freedom, but are we treating it as something precious?</p> <p>\"How can we have children 18 years later who go to school under trees and whose <a href=\"http://mg.co.za/article/2012-07-30-anc-government-textbook-failure\" title=\"\">education is being crushed</a> without textbooks and no one is held accountable? Have we so quickly forgotten the price of freedom?</p> <p>\"People are going to sleep hungry in this freedom for which people were tortured and harmed \u2026 It is difficult to believe people are getting such money and benefits, and are driving such flashy cars while the masses suffer in cramped shacks.\"</p> <p>He criticised those who enrich themselves where ministerial rules allow them. \"It's legal, but is it moral?\" he reportedly asked. \"Please, please, please, come to your senses.\"</p> <p>Tutu said the shooting at Marikana reminded him of events under apartheid.</p> <p>\"In 2012? In a democracy? In a new South Africa? Have we forgotten so soon? Marikana felt like a nightmare, but that is what our democracy is in 2012.\"</p> <p>The Marikana tragedy, in which police gunned down 34 striking mineworkers, has been <a href=\"http://www.shanduka.co.za/news-releases/WHAT-WE-DO-NOW-WILL-DEFINE-US-AS-A-NATION/index.html?&amp;re=1\" title=\"\">described as probably the lowest point in South Africa's short post-apartheid history</a> and prompted much soul-searching in the economically divided nation.</p> <p>Earlier this week, Tutu caused controversy when he accused <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/sep/02/tony-blair-iraq-war-desmond-tutu\" title=\"\">Tony Blair and George Bush of lying over weapons of mass destruction</a> in Iraq and called for them to answer charges of war crimes.</p>",
  "<p>If money talks, then spending \u00a364m in a single day bellows: \"Oi! We're serious about trying to win the Champions League!\" Europe can't help but hear Zenit St Petersburg now. The Russian champions are hardly new kids on the block \u2013 after all, they won the Uefa Cup in 2008 and then beat Manchester United in the Super Cup \u2013 but Monday's extravagant double capture of Hulk and Axel Witsel raises their status even higher, representing as it does the first time that a Russian club has lured from western Europe a pair of stars in their prime who were coveted by more prestigious clubs. Samuel Eto'o was reaching the end of his career when he joined Anzhi Makhachkala; and this discussion is no place for Aiden McGeady.</p> <p>Last season Zenit reached the Champions League knockout stages for the first time. Even before Monday's signings they looked likely to do so again this term \u2013 Milan are obviously formidable opponents but the other two teams in Zenit's group, the minnows Anderlecht and the financial basket cases M\u00e1laga, look eminently beatable. The acquisitions of Hulk and Witsel, though, mean it will probably take a team bigger than their conquerors last term, Benfica, to eliminate them this time round. But several teams do still look bigger and better than Zenit.</p> <p>As eye-catching as the signings were, Zenit still look lighter than the continent's customary heavyweights. They may even be behind two more recent arrivals at Europe's main ring. Whereas Manchester City and Paris Saint-Germain have splurged heavily at almost every opportunity since their super-rich benefactors took over, Zenit have been nearly totally inactive in the last four transfer windows, a state of affairs that had their Italian manager, Luciano Spalletti, much more agitated than Roberto Mancini has been this summer. Indeed, one of the recruits that eventually mollified Mancini, Javi Garc\u00eda, was a target that Zenit did not succeed in attaining.</p> <p>While the arrivals of Hulk and Witsel should repair two areas of the Zenit team that looked weak, other vulnerabilities remain. The goalkeeper Vyacheslav Malafeev remains error-prone and there is no truly commanding presence in central defence, where a previous high-profile signing, Bruno Alves (bought from Porto for around \u00a315m in 2010), has failed to fulfil expectations. Spalleti has reportedly been told he will need to off-load the Portuguese before he can recruit an upgrade, meaning Tomas Hubocan and Nicolas Lombaerts will likely stay the first-choice central defence this season.</p> <p>More and more top players seem likely to follow Hulk and Witsel to Russia in the years ahead, mainly, of course, because only a few clubs elsewhere can compete with the lavish salaries on offer but also because of the huge infrastructure improvements in the country ahead of the 2018 World Cup. Spartak Moscow and Rubin Kazan will shortly open spanking new stadiums and Zenit are revamping theirs by adding a retractable roof and pitch.</p> <p>They may not be building as frantically as PSG and City, but there is no doubt that Zenit's owners \u2013 Gazprom, the largest extractor of natural gas in the world \u2013 aspire to making their club European champions. Indeed, Gazprom is itself a growing influence in European football: in July the company to whom Roman Abramovich sold Sibneft for \u00a38.4bn in 2005 agreed a three-year sponsorship deal with Chelsea for an undisclosed amount that will likely help the London club's attempts to comply with financial fair play regulations and possibly helped smooth through the purchases of Eden Hazard, Oscar et al. What is more, in the same month Gazprom was unveiled as the sixth \"official partner\" of the Champions League, alongside Sony, Heineken, Visa and so on. So in a sense they already have their name on the trophy.</p>",

  "<p>Reshuffle? What reshuffle? Westminster professionals work themselves up about political personnel changes but, believe me, no one else much cares.</p> <p>As always, <a href=\"http://www.bartleby.com/46/3/53.html\" title=\"\">Shakespeare</a> expresses the nation's mood: \"We'll hear poor rogues talk of court news, who loses and who wins, who's in, who's out.\"</p> <p>It's not that voters are apathetic or indifferent or lazy. It's that they know from long experience that the identity of the minister in charge makes only the slightest dent in the policy of the department.</p> <p>Take what seems to be the main talking point for journalists: the replacement of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/sep/04/chris-grayling-jeremy-hunt-reshuffle?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">Ken Clarke by Chris Grayling</a> as justice secretary. It's a \"lurch to the right\", say pundits, excitedly. (Why, incidentally, to parties only ever \"lurch\" to the right? When did you last hear of someone \"lurching\" to the centre?)</p> <p>No one outside Westminster, though, will expect anything to change. The supremacy of the European convention on human rights, like the preference for non-custodial sentences, is regarded as an intrinsic part of the system, something beyond the capacity of any minister to alter.</p> <p>Every home secretary comes to office promising to deport dangerous fanatics, just as every foreign secretary promises to stand up to Brussels, every business secretary to \"cut red tape\", every chancellor to keep taxes down. It never happens. And the reason it never happens is that the minister is encased in a bureaucratic machine bigger than he is. There is little question that he wants these changes to occur \u2013 he can read opinion polls as well as anyone else \u2013 but he is stabbing at buttons that are disconnected, tugging at levers that have worked loose.</p> <p>In real life, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/may/14/in-praise-of-sir-humphrey-appleby\" title=\"\">Sir Humphrey</a> will almost always get the better of Jim Hacker. Where Hacker has a single special adviser, Sir Humphrey can call on hundreds of full-time professionals. Where Hacker is passing through \u2013 and already half-thinking of his next job \u2013 Sir Humphrey is there to stay. Where Hacker is distracted by Commons votes, constituency casework and after-dinner speeches, Sir Humphrey is in the department full time.</p> <p>With enough patience and tenacity, Hacker can eventually make changes \u2013 but it takes years to overcome the inertia of his permanent officials. Michael Gove is reforming education, and Iain Duncan Smith, like James Purnell before him, is reforming welfare. Both men, understanding how the system works, knew they had to stay at their posts to complete their work.</p> <p>Some Comment is free readers might at this stage be thinking that Sir Humphrey is a useful ally. Well, on some issues, he is, notably penology and education. On other issues \u2013 public spending, the American alliance, nuclear power, airport expansion \u2013 he is more of a nuisance to the left. And on quite a few, he is at odds with almost the whole country: it was a civil servant, for example, not a minister, who committed Britain to bailing out the euro, despite our non-membership.</p> <p>The problem is not this or that policy outcome; it's the delegitimisation of representative government. A minister is supposed to be there to remind his permanent officials that they work for the rest of us. If, instead, he becomes the cabinet champion and public spokesman for his department, democracy is vitiated.</p> <p>In consequence, the system loses its legitimacy, elections become devalued. \"What's the point in voting, nothing ever changes?\" people say. And, by and large, they're right.</p>",
  "<p><strong>How did you come to write The Artist of Disappearance, your trio of novellas about the influence of the past on modern India?</strong><br>The ideas had planted themselves in me long ago. For \"The Museum of Final Journeys\", it was visiting the Museum of Oriental Art in Venice and, while there, recalling the crumbling old palaces in the hinterland of West Bengal that I had toured with my sister, then a district official. For \"\u00cdTranslator Translated\", it was the debates that used to rage about colonial versus indigenous languages in India in the 50s and 60s, when I first started writing. And for \"The Artist of Disappearance\", it was the hills of Mussoorie, where I had spent childhood summers. But they had to wait for the right season to come to life, which came when I was once again spending a winter in Mexico, for me the best place in which to write.</p> <p><strong>What was most difficult about it?</strong><br>Recalling and recreating the events and atmosphere of the past and making them fresh and vivid and immediate once more.</p> <p><strong>What did you most enjoy?</strong><br>Doing precisely that, for a start; then the pleasure of finding the language to match that experience.</p> <p><strong>How long did it take?</strong><br>I wrote the first draft in one year, then took another year for a second and third draft.</p> <p><strong>What has changed for you since it was first published?</strong></p> <p>The response from Indian readers and critics, in particular, has been overwhelming. I had thought I would be castigated for writing about the India of the past and not keeping up with contemporary India, but that did not happen. On the contrary, so many readers seemed to appreciate them precisely for what they were. Instead of being seen as \"the granny\" of Indian writing in English, I was accepted as still readable.

  "<p>Every character actor who has ever been typecast dreams of a role that will transcend the cliches of his image. For Michael Clarke Duncan, who has died aged 54 of complications from a heart attack suffered in July, that breakout role also drew on the hidden truth of his own personality, and the results were spectacular.</p> <p>Duncan was nominated for an Oscar as best supporting actor in The Green Mile (1999), the film of the Stephen King story in which he plays John Coffey, a gentle giant with extraordinary powers, on death row for raping and killing two young girls. The film's climax, when Coffey, innocent of the crimes but having punished the real killer and an evil guard, goes to the electric chair telling Tom Hanks not to put a hood over his head because he is scared of the dark, left few dry eyes in any audience.</p> <p>Born in Chicago, Duncan, 6ft 5in and usually weighing about 20 stone, was himself a gentle giant. His father left when he was six, and his mother Jean's reluctance to allow him to play American football led to his deciding he wanted to become an actor instead.</p> <p>He played basketball at <a href=\"http://www.kcc.edu/Pages/Home.aspx\" title=\"\">Kankakee (Illinois) Community College</a>, but when his mother became ill, he dropped out of his communications studies at <a href=\"http://www.alcorn.edu/\" title=\"\">Alcorn State University</a>, a historically black university in Mississippi. After returning home, he supported his mother and sister, Judy, by digging ditches for a gas company and working as a bouncer at night.</p> <p>He moved to Los Angeles to pursue acting, again working as a bouncer before getting into the \"private security\" trade. He had acted as a bodyguard for such entertainment figures as Will Smith, Martin Lawrence, Jamie Foxx and LL Cool J before breaking into films in 1995 with a bit part in the Ice Cube vehicle Friday. His early film roles, including Warren Beatty's Bulworth (1998), saw him typecast as bouncers and bodyguards, often billed as Michael \"Big Mike\" Duncan. He gave up his day job as a real bodyguard for good in 1997, when the rapper The Notorious BIG was murdered on the first day Duncan was assigned to him.</p> <p>Duncan's break came following a part in Armageddon (1998) alongside Bruce Willis, who recommended him to director Frank Darabont for The Green Mile. He went on to work with Willis in three more films: two comedies \u2013 Alan Rudolph's adaptation of Kurt Vonnegut's Breakfast of Champions (1999) and The Whole Nine Yards (2000) \u2013 and the noirish blockbuster Sin City (2005).</p> <p>Although he never found another role with the impact of John Coffey, Duncan remained in demand with substantial parts in blockbusters such as Planet of the Apes (2001), The Scorpion King (2002) and perhaps his best later work as The Kingpin, in Daredevil (2003). To play the comic-book villain he went from weighing less than 20 stone to more than 23.</p> <p>His career blossomed, as his look made him easily cast for supporting roles in films and frequent guest parts in television series, and his resonant baritone voice made him a popular choice for animation voice-overs, in films such as Cats &amp; Dogs (2001), George of the Jungle 2 (2003), Dinotopia (2005) and Kung Fu Panda (2008). He starred in the comedy The Slammin' Salmon (2009), as a boxer turned restaurant-owner who stages a competition between his waiters to pay off a debt to Japanese gangsters, and was the villain, Erlik, in the straight-to-video Cross (2011), a supernatural action film that also featured Vinnie Jones as a Viking named Gunnar transplanted to the present.</p> <p>In 2010 Duncan undertook something of a reprise of his Coffey role in Redemption Road, as a man with a secret who brings home an alcoholic for his father's funeral. His last television role was a recurring part in the crime series Finder.</p> <p>In 2009 Duncan converted to vegetarianism. The following year, he met his fiancee, the Rev Omarosa Manigault, in the aisles of a Whole Foods supermarket in Los Angeles. Manigault, a considerable presence in \"reality\" television, made her name as a controversial participant in the American version of The Apprentice with Donald Trump, and feuded with Piers Morgan in The Celebrity Apprentice.</p> <p>In May this year, Duncan made a film for the animal-rights group Peta, talking about his conversion to a vegan lifestyle, and how he had thrown away $5,000 worth of meat when he did. Two months later, he suffered a massive heart attack.</p> <p>He is survived by his mother, sister and fiancee.</p> <p>\u2022 Michael Clarke Duncan, actor, born 10 December 1957; died 3 September 2012</p>",
  "<p>Enough is enough. George Galloway's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/aug/27/george-galloway-criticised-window-licker-tweet\" title=\"\">recent tweet</a> in which he described an individual as a \"window-licker\" (a derogatory term for a disabled person) is by no means the first time he has revealed the extent of his ignorance and bigotry towards a sizeable minority of the very individuals whom as a member of parliament it is his job to represent.</p> <p>I used to admire Galloway. I have heard him talk at numerous rallies and found him a compelling and passionate speaker with an ability to engage and enthuse a crowd from widely diverse backgrounds. \"Yes,\" I would think. \"I'm&#xa0;glad you're on my side.\"</p> <p>Then came his speech at a Stop the War rally. \"George Bush hears voices!\" he declared, to gales of laughter from the crowd, a reference to Bush's claim that God had told him to invade Iraq and Afghanistan. What could be more hilarious! A madman in charge of America! I can still recall my sudden sense of isolation; a moment before I had believed myself to be among friends. I wrote to Galloway after that but never received a reply.</p> <p>More recently, of course, there have been his <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/aug/20/george-galloway-julian-assange-rape\" title=\"\">extraordinary comments</a> regarding the allegations of rape and sexual assault concerning the Wikileaks founder, Julian Assange. In this, Galloway is far from alone, though typically he has gone further than most in his determination to ridicule the complaints of the women involved. \"It might be really bad manners not to have tapped her on the shoulder and said: 'Do you mind if I do it again?' ... but whatever else it is, it is not rape,\" he said. Galloway cannot possibly know what happened; he was not there. Assange may or may not be innocent of the allegations against him; this may or may not relate to WikiLeaks; but the readiness with which Galloway and others would simply dismiss the women's accounts will have left many survivors of sexual assault profoundly disillusioned and troubled.</p> <p>And now the window-licker comment. If anything could be more disturbing than an MP using the term, it is the attempt of Galloway's <a href=\"http://www.publicservice.co.uk/news_story.asp?id=20713\" title=\"\">spokesman </a>to justify his choice of language. \"He used the term, the street term, to dismiss the guy as a moron. Or idiot. Or doolally. To dress this up as some kind of slur on disabled people is shameful,\" he said. By this argument, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/aug/17/rio-ferdinand-fa-choc-ice-twitter\" title=\"\">Rio Ferdinand's tweet</a> in which he described Ashley Cole as a \"choc ice\" wasn't racist at all; he was just saying Cole was fake. The FA disagreed; they fined him \u00a345,000. Do we really expect higher standards of behaviour from our footballers than we do from our MPs?</p> <p>Disgusting as Galloway's language is, the problem runs far deeper than an obnoxious choice of word. The issue is one of attitude. It is the fact \u2013 whatever language he uses \u2013 that Galloway deems disability a tag with which to ridicule someone. I didn't think much of George Bush either but I don't see what that has to do with anyone hearing voices. And I don't think the fact that someone hears voices renders them incompetent or a warmonger or anything else. It just means they hear voices.</p> <p>Attitudes like Galloway's are sadly not uncommon. With many hoping the Paralympics could transform perceptions of disability, his comments offer a reminder of the scale of the transformation needed. I don't doubt that window-licker is flung about as a street term quite regularly. Internet forums are full of people mocking the claims of the women at the heart of the Assange case. But as an MP it is Galloway's job to represent the people of Bradford West. All the people of Bradford West. It is my belief that his attitude disqualifies him from doing so.</p> <p>Galloway should step down; he won't. But if the Respect party is to stand for anything other than a twisted sense of irony, it should seriously think about expelling him.</p> <p>\u2022 Clare Allan is an author and writer on mental health issues</p>",

The number of people registered at Red Cross and community shelters was put at 2,800 people, down from an earlier estimate of 4,000.</p> <p>Many of those caught up in the latest evacuation remain fearful of what awaits them at home.</p> <p>\"This is the second time we've lost our home. We lost it in Katrina,\" said Angela Serpas, from severely flooded Braithwaite in Plaquemines parish.</p> <p>Serpas and her daughter are currently staying with in-laws while waiting for the green light to go back home.</p> <p>In other parts of the state affected by Isaac, life is beginning to return to normal. Offshore oil rig workers returned to platforms and drilling rigs over the weekend.</p> <p>And although large residential pockets remain without power, lines have been restored to hundreds of thousands of homes.</p> <p>In New Orleans, the annual Southern Decadence festival \u2013 a gay pride celebration \u2013 went ahead over the weekend as planned. In Baton Rouge, thousands of gamblers gathered for the opening of Louisiana's newest riverboat casino \u2013 delayed by three days by the hurricane.</p> <p>But other parts of the flood-hit state remained under water. Much of Plaquemines parish, a vulnerable finger of land that juts into the Gulf of Mexico, continued to struggled to disperse as much as five feet of floodwater.</p> <p>\"I've never seen water come up this quick this fast,\" Parish president Billy Nungesser said.</p> <p>Nonetheless, local business owners and residents will be allowed to return temporarily with police escorts on Monday.</p> <p>In Saint John the Baptist parish, authorities are still eyeing the threat from high river levels. Over the weekend, evacuation buses and about 150 national guard soldiers were sent to the parish in case stranded residents needed assistance.</p> <p>President Obama will deliver remarks from Saint John the Baptist Parish later on Monday after seeing firsthand the post-hurricane clean-up operation.</p> <p>Mitt Romney visited the state Friday. In 2005, president George Bush was fiercely criticised for his slow response to Katrina, a hurricane that killed 1,800 people. In the immediate aftermath of the destruction, Bush opted to observe the damage from Air Force One, rather than setting foot on the ground.</p> <p>With an election just around the corner, neither Romney nor Obama were willing to make the same mistake.</p>",
  "<p>The vice-chancellor of London Metropolitan University said the institution would \"fundamentally contest\" the UK Border Agency's decision to revoke its licence to sponsor international students.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2012/sep/03/london-metropolitan-university-ukba-student-visa-rules\" title=\"\">The university is going to the high court this week</a> to try to stay implementation of the decision, which it says affects up to 2,600 overseas students and could result in it suffering an annual loss of \u00a330m.</p> <p>Its vice-chancellor, Malcolm Gillies, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme on Tuesday: \"My university is going to seek for this revocation to be stayed \u2026 because our analysis with leading immigration lawyers demonstrates that this report of the UKBA is wrong \u2026 We fundamentally contest the claim that there is systemic failure here.\"</p> <p>The government stripped London Met of its \"highly trusted\" status last week after the UKBA found a quarter of overseas students it checked on for an audit did not have permission to stay in the country.</p> <p>Gillies said the Border Agency's requirements for checking overseas students had changed substantially at least 14 times in the last three years, that it had failed to keep London Met aware of its concerns over the past six months and that the agency had not checked the details of its findings with the university.</p> <p>\"If it's based on something that's wrong or substantially wrong then we have to get that overturned,\" said Gillies. He said the decision was unfair on the overseas students at the university who face being thrown out of the country but also warned that it had wider repercussions, damaging not only the university but the reputation of British higher education as a whole.</p> <p>Speaking in the Commons on Monday, the immigration minister, Damian Green, said: \"UKBA found systemic failures that meant that London Met had not been able to ensure the appropriate admission and tracking of students from abroad.\"</p> <p>The government accused the university of \"failing to address serious and systemic failings\" identified six months ago.</p> <p>The vice-chancellor's comments coincided <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2012/sep/04/ukba-student-visa-rules\" title=\"\">with intense criticism of the UK Border Agency by MPs</a>, who accused it of causing chaos in the student visa system with a \"poorly planned and ill-thought-out\" change in the rules for overseas students.</p> <p>The agency's failings meant an extra 50,000 people abused the system, coming to Britain to work rather than study, the public accounts committee said.</p> <p>The committee of MPs said in a report published on Monday that the UKBA had enforced new rules for overseas students in 2009 before controls were in place.</p>"
