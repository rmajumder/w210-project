  "<p>\"Just when you thought it couldn't get any worse,\" whispered Simon Cowell <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv-6TQfsC-Q\" title=\"\">when \"classical crossover\" act Charlotte and Jonathan shuffled on stage during a heat of Britain's Got Talent earlier this year</a>.</p> <p>Then they opened their mouths and sang, and this extraordinary sound came out. Well it did out of Jonathan, a powerful tenor. Charlotte actually has a very ordinary voice. Dump her, said Cowell (boo, hiss). Of course Jonathan didn't: she was his school friend, she'd stuck by him when others hadn't, they were in this together.</p> <p>In the end they were <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGt\\_6foIZDU\" title=\"\">beaten into second place in the final by a dog called Pudsey</a> (not a singing dog thankfully, that would have been embarrassing). They haven't done badly though, as this ITV documentary, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan\\_and\\_Charlotte\" title=\"\">Jonathan and Charlotte</a> (they switched the names so Jonathan comes first, a small concession to Cowell's wisdom) demonstrates.</p> <p>Now they're off round Europe, to meet and learn from grand opera stars. \"It will be the most wonderful education,\" says their manager <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/mediamonkeyblog/2012/apr/18/jonathan-shalit-50th-birthday\" title=\"\">Jonathan Shalit</a> (presumably chosen for having almost the same name as his act). \"If you like, it will be the university of music for them.\"</p> <p>All the opera people seem to agree with Cowell's initial thought (that Charlotte should be dumped), though none has the courage \u2013 or lacks the tact \u2013 to say so. It doesn't matter though; J&amp;C can figure out their future later, for now they're just a couple of kids having a brilliant time: touring Europe, singing, eating ice cream, staying in hotels so posh they've got phones in the loo. And just the other day they were nobody.</p> <p>Worse than nobody in Jonathan's case \u2014 he was depressed, and bullied at school. Now he's happier, more comfortable being himself.</p> <p>It's oddly quite moving and lovely (even though the record they've made sounds truly ghastly). Of course, it could \u2014 almost certainly will \u2014 all go wrong: the balloon will burst and they'll come down to earth with a bump.</p> <p>But they are switched on and seem to realise this, just happy to enjoy it for now. There's only one problem: they do now seem to be owned by Simon Cowell.</p>",
  "<p>Something strange is happening to our credit card spending habits. We're becoming prudent and sensible. In every other recession since credit cards first started filling our wallets, there has been a sadly predictable turn of events. A significant number of consumers overspend during the good times, and are then overwhelmed by debts when the economy turns down, and job losses mount. What the finance industry calls \"delinquencies and impairments\" shoot up and personal bankruptcies spiral.</p> <p>But it hasn't happened this time. I met the boss of Barclaycard last week, Val Soranno Keating, dubbed the \"Queen of Cards\" because she controls an organisation that has 12 million credit card customers. She tells me that, rather than rising dramatically as expected, arrears and defaults have done completely the reverse, and are close to record lows.</p> <p>Instead, a grand substitution is taking place: cinema instead of theatre; fast food instead of restaurants; and public transport rather than cars.</p> <p>The huge rises in gas, electricity and petrol bills are taking their toll. Every time petrol prices surge, consumers cut back in other areas.</p> <p>An interesting relationship now exists between petrol prices and sales of electrical goods, such as TVs and computers. When petrol prices fall, almost exactly three months later consumers feel better off and buy a new flat-screen telly. The reverse happens when petrol prices rise \u2013 which may explain why Comet is on the brink of going bust.</p> <p>Barclaycard says it has seen spending at fast food restaurants rise 27.4% over the past year, while it is broadly flat at all other restaurants, and well below the rate of inflation. Meanwhile, we're leaving the car at home and taking the bus or train. Trips on public transport are up 6%, while those to fill up the petrol tank are down 4.1%, says Barclaycard.</p> <p>\"We're choosing more frequent trips to the cinema or the local pizzeria. Spending at fast food restaurants has surged by over a quarter, and we're being more value-conscious at the supermarket. We're still getting out, but we're choosing to leave the car at home due to high petrol prices,\" adds Soranno.</p> <p>Barclaycard doesn't just see the data from millions of credit card purchases. It also sees around one third of all payments made every day in the British economy through its merchant services, so it probably has a better feel for the state of the British economy than the Office for National Statistics.</p> <p>Unfortunately, it's not good reading. Spending by consumers is being consistently depressed by low or zero wage growth, while prices have continued to rise. Normally, spending shows a rise in November, ahead of Christmas. But it didn't happen last year, it seems. This year, whatever optimistic economists might say about \"the green shoots of recovery\", it's not showing up in Barclaycard's figures, which reveals that spending is flat, at best.</p> <p>The good news is that we're not taking on more debt, even though our wages are down and prices are up.</p> <p>A less benign interpretation is that economic confidence is so low that few of us think we can spend now and hope to pay it off later. The surprisingly robust jobs figures (have 500,000 jobs really been created over the past year?) probably mask a big switch to part-time and \"mini jobs\" where the squeeze on personal finances is intense. Historically low interest rates have also rescued mortgage borrowers who, even if they are in severe negative equity, can still, just, afford the monthly repayments.</p> <p>The credit card figures also fail to pick up on the low-income households turning to payday lenders. Prudent and sensible? Desperate, more like.</p> <p>At least the credit unions are trying to meet the challenge, as we've highlighted this week, but it needs a big player, such as the Post Office, to start offering cheap short-term loans if we are to be rid of the \"legal loan sharks\".</p> <p>We're not, perhaps, in a great depression. But the great stagnation is upon us.</p>",
  "<p>Yolanda La Amorosa flies through the air in a&#xa0;swirl of gold lam\u00e9 and petticoats, her calves clamped around the throat of her unfortunate opponent. He spins across the ring to land in a sprawl on the canvas, hand pressed against his lower back, face set in a grimace of agony. <em>\"Quieres mas, cabr\u00f3n? </em>[Do you want more, bastard?]\" Yolanda cries as she strides over and kicks him in the back of the head. There's a ripple of applause and laughter from her fellow wrestlers, who are hanging on the ropes, waiting to practise the same sequence.</p> <p>The ring is set up in a junkyard on the outskirts of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Alto,_La_Paz\" title=\"\">El Alto</a>, a sprawling migrant city that was once just a suburb of La Paz, the capital of Bolivia. The wrestlers, two women and two men, are training on torn mattresses laid across wooden planks. It's late afternoon and the sun dips behind the peaks of the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altiplano\" title=\"\">Andean Altiplano</a>. At over 4,000m, the air is thin and freezing. As the session ends, Yolanda puts on her bowler hat at a jaunty angle, sits on a pile of bricks and says, \"So what do you want to know?\"</p> <p>Bolivian all-in wrestling has been around since the 1950s. Inspired by Mexico's famous <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucha_libre\" title=\"\">lucha libre</a>, it's a theatrical mix of cartoon violence, acrobatics, goodies and baddies. But by far its most famous exponents are the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fighting_Cholitas\" title=\"\">Cholitas Luchadores</a>. With their <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pollera\" title=\"\">pollera bustle skirts</a>, bowlers and pigtails, Bolivia's indigenous Aymara women are icons of Andean culture. About 12 years ago, local wrestler and promoter Juan Mamani hit on the inspired idea of putting them in the wrestling ring.</p> <p>Yolanda, then simply Veraluz Cortez, was one of the first to respond to his casting call. \"I've got&#xa0;<em>luchador</em> blood in my veins,\" she tells me. \"My father was a wrestler, but he refused to train&#xa0;me. I&#xa0;had to do it all myself through hard work. That's how I became a champion.\" Born in&#xa0;Brazil, Yolanda moved to Bolivia when her parents separated. She was divorced herself 11 years ago, and raised her two daughters as a&#xa0;single mother until she remarried this year. \"I started wrestling to prove to myself, to the macho guys, to everyone, that I could succeed in such a&#xa0;dangerous sport.\" It's a sentiment shared by the&#xa0;other Cholitas I meet. In a country where machismo is almost a reflex, they see themselves as symbols of female empowerment.</p> <p>There are other perks, too, of course. While wrestling doesn't pay a lot \u2013 between $20 and $30 for a typical Sunday-night session \u2013 Cholitas such as Denita The Untouchable, Carmen Rosa and Maria The Damned enjoy the status of minor celebrities. They even tour internationally, in Chile, Argentina and the US.</p> <p>Life is tough in El Alto. The city was effectively built by the rural poor, fleeing an even harder life in the countryside. Domestic violence is a big issue \u2013 in 2009, the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inter-American_Commission_on_Human_Rights\" title=\"\">Inter-American Commission on Human Rights</a> estimated that up to 70% of Bolivian women suffered some form of abuse. Lucha libre is not only an escape from the daily grind, it also casts Aymara women as forces to be reckoned with. \"I like the younger Cholitas,\" says Gisella Garcia, a regular spectator. \"I like to see them beating the men.\"</p> <p>There's a problem with the whole emancipation narrative, though \u2013 or, at least, there was. Until last year, El Alto's wrestling scene was controlled by a man. Juan Mamani ran a virtual monopoly, with his Titans Of The Ring brand drawing large crowds to El Alto's Multifunctional Centre each Sunday, including high-paying tourists. But in October 2011, many of the top Cholita&#xa0;wrestlers broke away from Titans and set up their own association. \"All of the best wrestlers left,\" says Marta La Alte\u00f1a, real name Jenny Herrera, another of Mamani's original protegees. \"Mamani was taking all the money. When I broke my arm, he didn't help me at all and he kept telling me to lose. I wasn't prepared to do that.\"</p> <p>The new association's Sunday afternoon bouts take place in the Coliseo 12 de Octubre, a cavernous concrete stadium with bleachers for the locals and seats around the ring for tourists. At the back, the Cholitas gather in a tarpaulin tent where they stretch out and fix each other's hair and makeup. I meet Dina The Queen Of The Ring, a shy 28-year-old who has three children and cleans offices for a&#xa0;living. Ten minutes later, she has her masked male opponent in a choke, having just flattened him with a leap from the top rope. He taps out.</p> <p>Next up, it's Denita The Untouchable, a goodie, against Marta La Alte\u00f1a who, despite her relative bulk, delivers a quick series of hair-raising throws, then smothers the dazed Denita with her ample backside. The momentum shifts, though, and Denita starts displaying some of the speed and grace that earned her the untouchable moniker. It looks as if Marta is going to be counted out, but referee Ali Farak, a legendary baddie in the 1970s, who also happens to be Denita's dad, intervenes by breaking a wooden crate over his daughter's back. Marta pulls her up by her pigtails and starts spinning her round like a top, to a chorus of delighted boos from the crowd.</p> <p>Backstage afterwards, the pair embrace casually. There is an easy camaraderie among the Cholitas, a sense of shared pride in their identity. For years, the term <a href=\"http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=chola\" title=\"\"><em>chola</em></a> was derogatory, synonymous with the lowest social status in Bolivia. But just as the pigtails and polleras imposed by the Spanish 300 years ago are now a&#xa0;badge of honour for the Aymara, to be a chola is to be tough, independent and resourceful.</p> <p>Populist president <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/evo-morales\" title=\"\">Evo Morales</a>, himself Aymara, has been a vocal champion of the predominantly poor indigenous population, in particular its women. In 2010, he put together a&#xa0;cabinet with an even gender split, including three indigenous women. There are signs of an emerging indigenous middle class in La Paz. \"Five years ago, we were looked down upon \u2013 we used to just wait on the rich,\" Yolanda says as we sit in the little restaurant she runs. \"But now look at us. We're working in banks, in offices, even in government. We've shown that we are strong, entrepreneurial. And we won't be humiliated any more.\"</p> <p>\u2022 To see James Morgan and Johnny Langenheim's film about cholitas, go to <a href=\"http://vimeo.com/50363178\" title=\"\">vimeo.com</a>.</p>",

The website is happy to accept and make income from adverts from companies which take advantage of the unwary.</p> <p>For example, type \"Ehic card\" into Google and several companies will appear at the top of the listing \u2013 in the paid-for ads box. These official-looking sites prey on those who don't know better by charging a fee (typically \u00a314.99) to process their application for a European health card.</p> <p>But the truth is that Ehic cards are issued free for UK citizens. The official government site is further down the Google page. What the other sites are doing is getting consumers to pay for a service that is free. It's perfectly legal.</p> <p>The Passport Application Service works in a similar way. At the top of the website it says: \"Welcome to the UK Passport application assistance service which assists you with an online passport application service through the official Identity and Passport Service (IPS). Our service helps individuals who are entitled to complete a passport application online, to do so correctly.\"</p> <p>It doesn't claim to be the official passport site. Its fee of \u00a324 is for checking your application has been filled out correctly. Nice work it you can get it, although they have to buy the expensive Google ads to enable this to operate.</p> <p>We asked the company for an explanation. Finance director Stephen Oliver told us his firm offers a genuine service aimed at people who need help in filling in the application form. He said large numbers of passport applications failed each year because of errors \u2013 errors that his team will spot, saving his customers time. He also says his company employs translators to help those who do not have good enough English to fill in the forms. To access this service you have to dial an expensive 0905 number.</p> <p>When we pointed out that JW felt she had been duped into paying his firm's fee, he said he was happy to return her money not because he felt he was doing anything wrong, but as a gesture of goodwill.</p> <p>Interestingly, Google used to offer ads from companies that offered premium rate phone lines that would simply connect you to the normal NHS Direct phone line, but these have disappeared following criticism of the internet giant.</p> <p>Note, if you are desperate to have your passport application checked (why?) the Post Office offers a similar service, including sending, for \u00a38.75.</p> <p>If you are going to America, don't fall for one of the companies that will process your Electronic System for Travel Authorization (Esta) immigration forms \u2013 for an additional fee.

  "<p>Hollywood's prestige season is upon us and, despite a parade of heavy hitters, including Steven Spielberg's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2012/oct/09/lincoln-premiere-reactions-twitter\" title=\"\"><em>Lincoln</em></a> and the Wachowski-Tykwer adaptation of David Mitchell's <em>Cloud Atlas</em>, no potential Oscar winner is more ambitious \u2013 or more likely to provoke discussion regarding its meaning and intent \u2013 than Paul Thomas Anderson's sixth feature, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/146341/master\" title=\"\"><em>The Master</em></a><em>.</em></p> <p>Anderson's subtly disorienting, deeply engrossing study of the symbiotic relationship between charismatic cult leader Lancaster Dodd, magnificently played by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/philipseymourhoffman\" title=\"\">Philip Seymour Hoffman</a>, and his disturbed follower Freddie Quell, indelibly embodied by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/joaquin-phoenix\" title=\"\">Joaquin Phoenix</a>, is a panoramic chamber drama. Punctuated by persistent close-ups, it's an extended two-shot epic in its sweep.</p> <p>The first production to avail itself of the great clarity afforded by 65mm in the 16 years since Kenneth Branagh's <em>Hamlet</em>, <em>The Master</em> is a mock Promethean advertisement for itself, a blatantly big movie that is also provocatively eccentric. Anderson's compositions are often slightly off-kilter; he has a taste for slow, defamiliarising dolly shots. The score \u2013 composed like that of his previous film <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/122167/there.will.be.blood\" title=\"\"><em>There Will Be Blood</em></a> (2007) by Radiohead guitarist Jonny Greenwood \u2013 is modernistic and mildly discordant. The characters' dreams, if they are dreams, come and go unannounced.</p> <p><em>The Master </em>provoked considerable buzz before its North American release, mainly because it was assumed Anderson had made a film \u00e0 clef about the late L Ron Hubbard and his Church of Scientology. Hubbard may be the inspiration for Dodd, a writer who advances a quasi-religious philosophy known as \"the Cause\" that finds psychic trauma in prenatal experience or past lives, framing individual existences as part of a \"battle that's a trillion years in the making\". In addition to certain putative therapeutic practices, some Hubbardian details doubtless struck the artist as irresistible. The writer's reported credo (never defend, always attack) is, for example, attributed in the movie to Dodd's controlling wife (a steely Amy Adams). But mainly Anderson is interested in the master as&#xa0;a personality and a type.</p> <p><em>The Master</em> is Anderson's second consecutive movie to feature a charismatic spiritual leader. Like the precocious faith healer Eli Sunday in <em>There Will Be Blood</em>, Lancaster Dodd belongs to a tradition that has flourished in America for more than 300 years. In addition to Hubbard, Dodd conjures up America's colourful history of cults, quacks, self-invented saviours and self-appointed prophets: Cotton Mather, Joseph Smith, Mary Baker Eddy, Dale Carnegie, Ayn Rand, Wilhelm Reich, Timothy Leary and Pat Robertson are among the most successful. It's a subject that's only been rarely touched on by Hollywood, perhaps because the movies were once themselves a form of secular religion.</p> <p>Frank Capra's <em>The Miracle Woman</em> (1931), featuring the young Barbara Stanwyck as a version of evangelist Aimee Semple McPherson, Richard Brooks's 1960 adaptation of the Sinclair Lewis novel <em>Elmer Gantry</em>, with Burt Lancaster as a salesman turned revivalist, and John Huston's 1979 adaptation of the Flannery O'Conner novella <em>Wise Blood</em>, with Brad Dourif as a backwoods preacher, were prophets crying in the wilderness. <em>The Master</em> is something else. Anderson's movie sometimes verges on comedy but it is hardly a satire, or even a critique, of the Cause. Rather, it treats Dodd's existence as a fact of life.</p> <p>Released in the US to largely appreciative, if sometimes baffled, reviews, <em>The Master </em>is a singular piece of work that, if nothing else, confirms its 42-year-old writer-director's unique status. Todd Haynes's 2011 made-for-TV adaptation of the James M Cain novel <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/fiction/9781780220727/mildred-pierce\" title=\"\"><em>Mildred Pierce</em></a> notwithstanding, Anderson is the lone American film-maker of his generation who could be mistaken for a junior member of Hollywood's last golden age.</p> <p>Anderson's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/34488/boogie-nights\" title=\"\"><em>Boogie Nights</em></a> (1997) and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/81820/magnolia\" title=\"\"><em>Magnolia</em></a> (1999) were sprawling ensemble pieces \u2013 one dealing with the rise of the porn film industry, the other a manic, pre-millennial new age meditation on karmic craziness \u2013 that challenged Martin Scorsese and Robert Altman on their own turf. Taken from the first two chapters of Upton Sinclair's polemical novel <em>Oil!</em>, <em>There Will Be Blood</em> was a big, bold consideration of a larger-than-life American character that had the effrontery to engage Orson Welles. <em>The Master</em>'s cool detachment and consummate craft have invited comparisons to Stanley Kubrick.</p> <p>Anderson's willingness to go up against the big guys is reinforced by the father-son relationships that, sometimes cryptic, can be found in all but one of his features since his 1996 debut <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/mar/18/dexter-fletcher-film-changed-life\" title=\"\"><em>Hard Eight</em></a>. The exception, the perversely uncommercial 2002 Adam Sandler vehicle <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/94083/punch-drunk-love\" title=\"\"><em>Punch-Drunk Love</em></a><em>, </em>may be the one Anderson movie that most directly addresses his own father, Ernie Anderson, a comedian and TV personality who, among other things, hosted the Cleveland horror movie show <em>Shock Theatre</em> under the name Ghoulardi.</p> <p>Set in the aftermath of the second world war, <em>The Master</em> doesn't take on a classic film-maker so much as, in its elliptical way, the whole, handed-down notion of an American century. The movie suggests a hyperreal, streamlined analogue to Hollywood's similarly titled atomic age epics: <em>Magnificent Obsession</em>, <em>East of Eden</em>, <em>Giant</em>, <em>Bigger Than Life</em>. (The period production design, credited to Jack Fisk and David Crank, is remarkable.) Throughout there is a sense of a new world of possibility being forged. The movie's most mysterious sequence, set to Ella Fitzgerald's dreamy rendition of the ballad \"Get Thee Behind Me Satan\", unfolds in a California department store that has the radiance of a newly consecrated temple.</p> <p><em>The Master </em>opens on the eve of V-J Day in the summer of 1945, with vignettes of victorious American sailors on a Pacific island beach goofing around and acting horny, most graphically upon the ample sand-sculpted torso of a prone naked woman. Alone in the crowd of revelling seamen, Freddie Quell emerges as an impulse-driven lost soul with a taste for (and talent for mixing) home-made alcohol concoctions. Newly demobilised, Quell has his difficulties in adjusting to civilian life, if not life in general; identified, off-handedly, as the son of a psychotic mother and alcoholic father, he is also the sum total of the traumatised veterans who populate postwar film noir or social problem movies such as <em>The Best Years of Our Lives</em>.</p> <p>Quell's failure to fit in delivers him up to the charismatic Dodd. After supplying a bad batch of his booze to some fellow migrant workers, Quell sneaks aboard Dodd's yacht \u2013 or rather a yacht that the irrepressible Dodd, half literary swami, half vaudeville ham, is currently using as a training centre for the Cause. Before long, Freddie is playing Caliban to Dodd's Prospero in the brave new world of mid-century America. \"You'll be my prot\u00e9g\u00e9 and my guinea pig,\" Dodd tells him; in addition to serving as Dodd's subject and surrogate son, he will also be Dodd's sometime enforcer and personal bar-tender. The writer develops a taste for Quell's paint-thinner, squeezed lemon, crushed-pill moonshine \u2013 perhaps because it's a concoction not unlike his own spiritual home-brew.</p> <p><em>The Master</em> is, in large measure, the story of a showman and, as a movie, it's predicated on two sensational performances. Mumbling from the side of his mouth, pushing himself forward even while flinching away from anyone he addresses, Phoenix's hunched, simian lurch is as strange as his provocative, swallowed up line-readings. (It's as though Andersen created him as a foil for the film's master.) Dodd more than once calls Quell an \"animal\", which in some ways he is \u2013 a barely articulate brute with a capacity for sudden violence, springing into action in the aftermath of a Park Avenue soiree at which Dodd hypnotises the hostess into reliving her past life until a resolutely sceptical questioner wrecks the evening. Dodd, by contrast, is knowingly civilised \u2013 he's a jolly, freely mugging self-promoter who, more than once, bursts into song, at least in Freddie's mind.</p> <p>Because Hoffman's manipulative mountebank is as great a character as Phoenix's useful, if not always controllable, idiot, <em>The Master</em> has a balance lacking from the Daniel Day-Lewis show that <em>There Will Be Blood</em> ultimately became. To emphasise their relationship, Anderson likes to split the screen \u2013 most spectacularly during the scene when crazed Quell and hyper-controlled Dodd are locked in adjacent jail cells. As Quell trashes his, Dodd calmly tells him: \"Nobody likes you but me, Freddie.\"</p> <p>Recognising that the \"auditing\" process Dodd puts Quell through could be construed as a form of auditioning, critics have been quick to note that <em>The Master</em> is a quest for self-realisation set in the era of method acting; one online commentator went so far as to call the movie \"Brando v Brando\".</p> <p>With his vulnerable bravado, Phoenix does suggest a troglodyte Montgomery Clift, but the grandiloquent, self-amused Hoffman (who, playing a role Anderson wrote for him, could be justifiably called the best actor in American movies) is more like a nimble Orson Welles. It's an acting battle to be sure, albeit one that pits the spell of Dodd's fraudulent culture against the immediacy of Quell's authentic nature.</p> <p>The themes are not only big but perennial. Although in no way literary, <em>The Master</em> is the first movie I've seen since Lars von Trier's faux American <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/96938/dogville\" title=\"\"><em>Dogville</em></a><em> </em>that feels as if it could be a part of American literature. <em>Dogville </em>managed to reference<strong> </strong>Hawthorne's <em>The Scarlet Letter</em> and Hammett's <em>Red Harvest</em>. <em>The Master</em>, more conventional, has intimations of Theodore Dreiser's naturalistic national epics and Sinclair Lewis's American scene taxonomies, with a hint of the mysterious postwar undercurrents and psychic swells registered by William Gaddis's first novel, <em>The Recognitions</em>.</p> <p>Essentially, <em>The Master</em> is a fable and while Anderson's movie would seem to raise the question of whether Freddie Quell can live his American Dream as a masterless slave, it does ultimately suggest that Quell has internalised Dodd's teachings and even put them to use. For once in Anderson's world, the son has triumphed over the father.</p> <p>The introductory chapter of DH Lawrence's <em>Studies in Classic American Literature</em> addresses the function that freedom and authority occupy in the American imagination: It's the Calibans, \"the most unfree souls\", per Lawrence, who \"go west, and shout of freedom\". Lawrence concludes by proposing to strip away the trappings of democratic rhetoric that exalts the will of the people, to reveal America's \"deepest self\". For him, the official line \u2013 which he puts in quotation marks \u2013 is contradicted by the underlying meaning:</p> <p>\"Henceforth be masterless.\"</p> <p>Henceforth be mastered.</p> <p>Anderson, though, is an American.

  "<p>Skiing in February half-term in Europe is usually a nightmare: hour-long lift queues, 80-strong swarms of schoolchildren and the entire population of Paris clad in C&amp;A-ski chic skidding across the piste. Carving wide, open turns on a deserted slope is a rarely fulfilled dream.</p> <p>And yet here I am with the sun shining and perfect snow under my feet, a lone figure, cruising at my upper speed limit and headed for an empty, heated, six-person lift. What's more, I'm happily full from a lunch of steaming noodle soup that cost \u20ac2.50, and a \u20ac3-a-pint beer.</p> <p>From the raucous, boozy, apr\u00e8s-ski of St Anton to the heart-in-your-throat downhill descents of Kitzb\u00fchel, the Austrian Tirol is well known to Brits as the heart of the country's skiing. But not so well known is that this Alpine paradise comes in a double helping: North Tirol (the one we Brits mistakenly call Tirol) and East Tirol (Osttirol), the lesser-known bit. The resorts of East Tirol, two hours from Innsbruck, rarely appear in ski top 10s and you will not find the boot-stomping, apr\u00e8s-ski scene often associated with Austria there. But that's not to say that it's a backwater, just alluringly remote.</p> <p>\"Aaaal right, Kals. Yeh. Baby.\" The perfect silence is suddenly obliterated by a 50-something cocktail of Steve Martin and Franz Klammer who skids to a halt on massive skis.</p> <p>\"Yo,\" says Robbie, the silver-maned Austrian-American partner of my local ski guide, Eva, who accompanies him. They are to guide me around their home resort of Grossglockner Kals-Matrei, which they live below, in the picturesque village of Kals on the edge of the mighty Hohe Tauern national park \u2013 the largest nature reserve in central Europe. In summer, Kals is a sleepy farming community where the hay is still harvested with scythes, dried on racks in the meadows and bailed by hand. East Tirol tots up the most hours of sunshine in Austria.</p> <p>The ski resort lies off the main road from Mittersill to Lienz, and was established in 2009, when Kals gondola opened, joining the pre-existing areas of Kals and Matrei to form the Grossglockner resort, and whisking skiers from the village at 1,324m to Cimaross at 2,621m. In December the new \u20ac40m, four-star Gradonna Mountain Resort (<a href=\"http://www.gradonna.at\" title=\"\">gradonna.at</a>) \u2013 with 240-bed hotel, 41 chalets, indoor pool, spa and kids' club \u2013 will open in Kals, with extra investment in&#xa0;the resort's new lifts, restaurants and bars.</p> <p>With 110km of pistes and 16 lifts, the area does not compare with the mega-resorts in North Tirol (St Anton has 280km of pistes), and in one full first-lift-last-lift day of skiing you can cover just about every run. But with some fast, steep blacks and challenging reds on the Kals side, and great, sunny tree runs on the Matrei side, the feelgood factor here is huge. And as for the lift queues, they don't exist.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398733408\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/pictures/2012/11/1/1351770547814/Adler-lounge-Kals-am-Gros-010.jpg\" alt=\"Adler lounge Kals am Grossglockner\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Adler Lounge delivers panoramic views of the resorts, as well as offering a stylish dining experience.

It has three restaurants, including a gourmet dining room where your ski boots are replaced with slippers, and rooms and apartments to hire from \u20ac204 a night.</p> <p>We tuck into an incredible lunch of clear dumpling soup, venison, red cabbage and chestnut ragout and even squeeze in some <em>kaiserschmarrn</em> \u2013 Austria's signature sweet pancake \u2013 while Eva imparts a short history of the region. East Tirol is separated from North Tirol of the state by a&#xa0;12-mile-wide strip of land belonging to the neighbouring Austrian region of Salzburg Land. After the first world war, the south of the Tirol was ceded to Italy under the Treaty of St-Germain.&#xa0;</p> <p>It wasn't until 1967, when the 5.3km-long Felbertauern tunnel from Mittersill to Lienz was completed, that East Tiroleans were reconnected with North Tirol. \"Before the tunnel, we couldn't get to Innsbruck without travelling through Italy,\" says Eva. \"And the Italians didn't exactly make it easy [for us] to cross the border. They used to lock the doors of the trains at the top of the Brenner Pass and not open them again until the train got to Innsbruck.\"</p> <p>After lunch, Robbie takes us to the Matrei side of the resort, where the reds and blues are fast, with natural hits, soft bumps and tree-lined paths. We just make the last lift back to Kals and our long day comes to an end with an in-the-dark, adrenaline/schnapps-fuelled forest run back to the base, with Robbie bringing up the rear singing Country Road at the top of his voice.</p> <p>Grossglockner Kals-Matrei is the largest of East Tirol's six ski areas, which altogether add up to 350km of pistes. On the other side of the main road from Kals, in a gorgeous, south-facing valley is St Jakob im Defereggental, a small, fun, family resort, with seven lifts, three of which are rope tows.</p> <p>It's a beauty, and worth a visit if only for the one black, which winds its way through the woods like a meandering river before opening out onto a wide, empty piste, though really a locals' resort. When we arrive there's only one lift working above the tree line on the Grosser Leppleskofel peak, so we wait with the other skiers until the other two open.</p> <p>\"Hey. Hey. Guardian UK comin' atchaaaa!\" comes a west-coast caterwaul further down the lift line. It's Robbie with his family out for a day's skiing. Cue another schnapps-fuelled afternoon skiing faster than I've ever skied before.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398733409\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/pictures/2012/11/1/1351788967348/Tirol-map-001.jpg\" alt=\"Tirol map\" width=\"460\" height=\"413\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\"> </span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Thirty kilometres from Lienz towards the Italian border is another must-do resort. With views of the Austrian Alps and the Dolomites, Hochpustertal-Sillian really, really is a local place for local people, which means that on a weekday in half-term the pistes are a white canvas, with only a splattering of skiers. That's not to say there are no tourists \u2013 the Swedes apparently love the place \u2013 but despite there being only 55km of runs, the long, wide pistes distribute them well. Anyone under the age of 18 can ski on a child's ski pass (\u20ac20 a day in all East Tirol resorts), which makes it great value and attractive to the local kids who hit the hill en masse at the weekends and still have plenty of space.&#xa0;</p> <p>Set just off the SS49-E66, the main road that skirts the Lienzer Dolomites, heading for the Brenner Pass, Sillian's accessibility is second to none. Ski down the top-to-bottom piste number one (vertical drop 1,307m), walk 10&#xa0;paces to your car and you're on the highway and winding your way to Italy and on to Innsbruck.</p> <p>Skiing in the resorts of East Tirol is like finding treasure. They may not offer the short transfer, ski-and-party life you'll find up north, but this collection of undiscovered gems will definitely put a smile on your face, especially if you bump into Robbie.</p>",
  "<p>In times of recession, they say, cinemas do well, but during a depression churches do better. For Bulawayo, Zimbabwe's second city, that certainly appears to be true. Local historian Paul Hubbard and I are standing in front of an architectural gem of a cinema that is now a church, one that has fortunately left all the art deco trappings of the picturehouse intact. Miriam, the receptionist, tells me that they are growing fast with new sites opening every month, but down in the stalls one of the helpers tries to sell me his paintings. He's been&#xa0;struggling financially since his family were evicted in a land invasion. Was he bitter?</p> <p>He shrugs. \"I was angry then, but not now. I prefer the city.\"</p> <p>Next to the nearby City Hall hawkers sit with their craft carvings and weavings waiting for tourists, but there are few takers: in fact Paul seems to be their biggest buyer, ever-eager to point out bargains: \"Look, that stick is zebra wood \u2013 beautifully carved piece.\"</p> <p>I take the stick and also examine a six-inch-long conical basket. When I&#xa0;ask what it is, the lady screeches with laughter. \"It's called an <em>umncwando</em>.\" Paul tells me. \"That's Ndebele for willy-warmer.\" We move on.</p> <p>Zimbabwe's tourist business may be recovering but most visitors only connect with the safari lodges out&#xa0;in the bush. The opportunity then, to accompany Paul on a pub crawl that is newly available to tourists \u2013 \"Maybe we should say architectural walking tour\" \u2013 is irresistible. \"Bulawayo has&#xa0;an amazing historical heritage. Look here \u2013 the Palace Hotel bar \u2013 this is where <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Morton_Stanley\" title=\"\">Stanley</a> stayed in 1897,\" says&#xa0;Hubbard. He pulls a face as we enter. \"He said it was scarcely suitable for a gentleman let alone ladies.\"</p> <p>Inside the original dark panelling has been partly obscured by a Chinese dragon motif, but otherwise this is much as Henry Morton Stanley would have experienced it, excepting, of course, one other major difference: most of the clientele are a different colour. This bar, like others on the tour, were white men's watering holes in a country that had racial divisions hardwired into it the moment <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cecil_Rhodes\" title=\"\">Cecil Rhodes</a> arrived in 1893.</p> <p>Now, at the Palace bar, I was extricating myself from a debate on UK immigration policies, more precisely why the jolly man with gold teeth had been refused a visa. I express sympathy and ask if he had suffered?</p> <p>\"I had a farm,\" he says, then adds with a laugh: \"For nine months.\" That was the period between inheriting a farm and then losing it to war vets. \"Some of them were good guys.\" He doesn't appear particularly fazed: in fact everyone I was meeting here seemed to take reversals of fortune in their stride. Was there something in the beer?</p> <p>Drinking up and moving on, we pass a lovely old department store, its elegant frontage dating back to 1895, then stop at Grey's Inn. A sign at the door forbids \"Transparent Dresses.\"</p> <p>Next is the King's Head. \"My Dad was a goldminer,\" says Paul. \"He used to play dice in here.\" There are wooden plaques above the bar that still announce the tournament winners through the 1970s (Rhodesia came to a belated end in 1979) but all of those white people are gone.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398734495\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/gallery/2012/11/1/1351773378896/Bulawayo-Club-Zimbabwe-001.jpg\" alt=\"Bulawayo Club, Zimbabwe\" width=\"460\" height=\"277\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Bulawayo Club.

It still has&#xa0;a boisterous, good-humoured atmosphere, though no more gold-diggers. \"Replaced with local politicians,\" says Paul. \"Do not get your camera out!\"</p> <p>At Cafe Baku we decide against the \"Devil Juice: 2 tots $1\" and stick with beer. Finally, we are back where we had started, at the Bulawayo Club, where Rhodes' bust still broods in the lobby and his contemporaries are framed on the walls, little brass plaques recording their fates, often \"killed in action\".</p> <p>Outside the bar an aged sign reads: \"Dress for ladies is difficult to specify. Happily, most ladies have good taste and problems do not arise.\" We chat to a&#xa0;local black couple and persuade them to come to the snooker room, both protesting that they don't know how to play.</p> <p>Nothing much has changed in here since the slate tables were shipped from their Welsh quarry and carried, presumably by ox cart, halfway across Africa. The club members must have delighted in all the reminders of Edwardian England: the dark-wood panelling, the dour portraits, the ash wood cues, the bigotry about race, gender and dress. But even back then, however, they could not entirely exclude Africa.

  "<p>Ray squats down and inspects the tracks carefully, his rifle held in the crook of one arm. \"These are from yesterday,\" he says, pointing to where the fine dusty edge of the print has been blurred by the breeze. \"It's a big male \u2013 very big. The one we heard roaring just before dawn.\"</p> <p>That was an hour ago. I glance around the silent trees, half expecting to see a big cat staring back at me. Ray gets up and searches the ground nearby. \"Looks like there are two lionesses with him,\" he says.</p> <p>We walk on through the dry forest. At a glance the area looks dead, but closer inspection reveals signs of recovery: green shoots are appearing, the trees are gambling on rain coming soon. Ray leads on for about a mile then stops and inspects another lion print. This time the track is fresh. There is a stiff breeze blowing but the print is perfect. Ray nods and says: \"They were moving around this morning.\" He glances at me. \"Remember the rules. Stay with the gun. Never run.\"</p> <p>I was wondering how I could politely ask: \"Are you a good shot?\" But I knew the answer: all guides in Zimbabwe are great shots. It's part of their training, an apprenticeship that consistently produces top wildlife guides who are supremely competent in those awkward social moments, like a lion charge. In Ray's case, I knew he had spent his life handling such tricky situations, having been born and brought up in this place: Hwange national park. It's a giant of a reserve, 5,400 square miles, bigger than Yorkshire or the state of Massachusetts, but just one element in a vast ecosystem that extends into Botswana, Namibia and southern Angola.</p> <p>We move on again. The bush is thicker and visibility at times down to as little as 10&#xa0;metres. Then we come to a small clearing. \"They slept here,\" whispers Ray. He kneels down by a patch of wet, sandy earth \u2013 lion urine \u2013 and sticks his finger in to take the temperature. \"They are very close.\"</p> <p>He stands and finds the cats' trail leaving the clearing. We follow it. Then&#xa0;we see the dead buffalo, a female&#xa0;lying in the shade of a tree. Its eyes have been pecked out, but it has yet to be disembowelled. Ray touches the carcass.</p> <p>\"Cold.\" He frowns. \"It can't have been killed last night: the birds wouldn't have got to the eyes yet. But if it was the night before last, why have they eaten so little?\"</p> <p>I'm standing, camera at the ready. There are fresh tracks all around us. I feel like I'm watching a chef who is about to whip open the oven door: \"Voila! It's ready!\" All the ingredients in place for a feast of lion-watching \u2013 or maybe just a feast. Who is the masterchef here: is it Ray, or the lion? Three of them against two men and one gun \u2013 which is not with me, thankfully, but I&#xa0;do wish I'd brought something resembling a weapon. Will a&#xa0;Canon EOS 7D camera block up a lion's mouth?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398762412\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/pictures/2012/11/1/1351789047738/Zimbabwe-map-001.jpg\" alt=\"Zimbabwe map\" width=\"460\" height=\"409\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Zimbabwe map</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I'd arrived in Zimbabwe expecting surprises and with lots of questions. This was a country that had gone from&#xa0;being the bread basket of southern Africa to a basket case in a few short years. The catalogue of disasters was damning: thousands of villagers in Matabeleland had been slaughtered; white farmers had been terrorised and robbed; thousands of black farmworkers had lost their homes and jobs; the economy had been&#xa0;ruined and much of the population had fled abroad. Now there was talk of a recovery and a tourist influx but in the face of such an indictment, I&#xa0;asked myself, should anyone go to Zimbabwe?</p> <p>No sooner had I arrived than I was asking that same question to everyone I met. The replies were always frank.</p> <p>\"It's different now,\" one man told me. \"We have a power-sharing government. Tourists should definitely come,\" he said.</p> <p>\"When there were no tourists,\" said another, \"I never knew if my family would eat.\"</p> <p>Others honed in on underlying issues. \"How much of your money actually goes to the government? I'll tell you \u2013 just the $55 visa fee.\" And, of course, land redistribution came up: \"It had to be done,\" was a common refrain. \"The British stole it, then sold it to each other and thought that was all fine. But the land seizures \u2026 aish!\"</p> <p>That sound: aish, you hear it a lot in Zimbabwe when words are inadequate. When people talk about the period between the 2002 and 2008 elections, you hear it constantly. This was a time when visitor numbers nosedived. Zimbabwe's market share of African tourism had peaked in the 90s at around 8% but that halved in five years. In Hwange the total number of permanent safari lodges and seasonal camps fell from around 35-40 into single figures.</p> <p>Tour operators in the UK had difficult decisions to make. \"We kept Zimbabwe in our brochures,\" says Chris McIntyre of Expert Africa. \"It was important \u2013 especially for the small, owner-run operations that we'd known for years \u2013 to show them that we wouldn't abandon them in the bad times and that we took our responsibilities to them seriously.\"</p> <p>Out in the country I found that loyalty did not go unnoticed. \"We had so few tourists,\" said one man who had kept his job, \"But those few kept us alive.\" When people say such things, the true significance of a decision to boycott a country sinks in.</p> <p>\"For evil to prevail,\" one black Zimbabwean hotel owner told me, \"it only needs good men to do nothing.\"</p> <p>These people, I thought, see tourism as something with real economic and moral power, something that can have a significant and beneficial effect on Zimbabwe's future.</p> <p>So, I am standing there, an hour after first light, watching Ray dip his finger in a dead buffalo, one that belongs to a lion pride that is undoubtedly only metres away. And I start grinning because I had never asked the question: \"Is Zimbabwe safe?\" And if I had, it would have been with people in mind: angry war vets, baton-wielding police, violent mobs. Any safety threat, I'd imagined, would come charging at me in a uniform, not a sandy yellow fur coat with canines as long as my hand. Why hadn't I thought of that? Because the short-term political world distracts us from the deeper, more eternal questions of the natural order, questions such as: am I about to become a feline breakfast?</p> <p>Ray motions with his rifle and moves off. I follow. It is almost impossible to be silent in these dry leaves but fortunately the lions have left a big dusty trail. We walk in their footprints. Then suddenly Ray is pointing. \"There!\"</p> <p>I catch sight of a lioness's backside, then a few flickers of straw-coloured bodies through the trees. Through one gap, a face pauses momentarily. My gaze connects for an instant with a pair of sombre, yellow eyes, then they are gone. We set off in pursuit, but after a few minutes Ray stops. \"They got spooked. We'll never catch them now.\"</p> <p>I hadn't expected that: the king of the jungle to be afraid of us. But Ray nods. \"Sometimes they will sit, rarely they will charge, but usually they run away.\" It doesn't matter to me. I'm elated. Seeing lions on foot is an adrenaline-charged pleasure even when very brief. We decide to call off our lion hunt and go find some breakfast back at Somalisa Camp.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398762413\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/gallery/2012/11/1/1351774397239/Somalisa-Camp-Hwange-Zimb-001.jpg\" alt=\"Somalisa Camp, Hwange Zimbabwe\" width=\"460\" height=\"277\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Somalisa Camp</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A tented site, Somalisa is built with minimal impact under a bunch of tall acacia trees that spread between two waterholes. At each there is a small pool, not more than three metres across protected by a shallow moat. As the heat of the day fades, elephants come to both. Once there they drop their trunks in, suck up water, and then pour it down their throats. The particular experience here, however, is to slide into the pool and sit quietly in the water, the vast animals looming overhead as the evening comes. After their drink the giants stroll off through the camp \u2013 there is no fence.</p> <p>When Beks Ndlovu, a black, Zimbabwean wildlife guide, started Somalisa in 2006, it was his first venture and also the worst possible time: electoral violence and land seizures had brought economic chaos. By November 2008 basic commodities were doubling in price every hour of the day and the currency was, quite literally, not worth the paper it was printed on.</p> <p>But elections led to a power-sharing government the following February and after that came recognition that the Zimbabwean dollar was dead. No one would accept it any more. The US dollar was declared the main currency. Since then Zimbabwe has been crawling its way back from the edge of the abyss. \"Things are getting better,\" says Ndlovu. \"Our business has grown to eight camps in Zimbabwe and Botswana.\"</p> <p>Next day I find a sign of the growing confidence a few hours' drive away at Camp Hwange, a new operation set up by Dave Carson. In the dark days of hyperinflation, Dave moved his employees out to wildlife camps in Botswana, saving them from a fate that came to many black Zimbabweans: a border run and escape&#xa0;to Johannesburg. Now there is a new semi-circle of six luxury lodges strung around a waterhole that is filled from a&#xa0;borehole.</p> <p>\"Hwange is a very dry area,\" explains Dave. \"The boreholes and pumps were started in the 1930s and without them, the animals could not survive. They'd all have to move away,\" he says.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398762414\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/gallery/2012/11/1/1351774570351/Female-elephant-charges-K-001.jpg\" alt=\"Female elephant charges Kevin's Land Rover.\" width=\"460\" height=\"277\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A female elephant charges Kevin's Land Rover. Photograph: Kevin Rushby for the Guardian</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kevin Rushby/Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Even with the extra water, this time at the end of the dry season is a deadly period. Everywhere we see baobab trees that have been gnawed through by hungry elephants, while each waterhole seems to have the carcass of a young animal that didn't survive, always presided over by a committee of vultures. That evening we see long lines of elephants marching towards the waterhole, a few of them running.</p> <p>\"Some come long distances,\" says Dave as we stand by the campfire, just a couple of hundred metres away. \"We don't know what those animals have been through. Some have probably had bad experiences.\" As if to prove him right, the herd is about to throw up an example of one such individual.</p> <p>Our original plan was to walk out to a hide that Dave has built under an African ebony tree next to the water. Unfortunately, we've left it too late and there are so many elephants rushing in that we need to drive. First, we skirt the pan. In the treeline we spot kudu, impala and sable, all waiting for the elephants to finish. The birds have no such qualms: lines of guinea fowl come chuckling along in the dust while the sky is strafed with pigeons. The elephants take long drinks, then chuck themselves in, throwing great splatters of mud over themselves, and us. The air fills with dust and the contented sounds of animals that know they have survived another day.</p> <p>We motor slowly around the back, attempting to reach the hide. One cow elephant is behaving aggressively, rushing at other animals, waving her ears and trunk. The object of her anger, however, always seems to be other females of similar age and size. She doesn't tackle the big males. She doesn't tackle Land Rovers. Dave goes&#xa0;slowly, keeping a respectful distance. \"We'll just see if she'll let us into the hide.\"</p> <p>No sooner are the words out of his mouth than she drops her head and charges. Our forward path is blocked by lines of elephants who are still pouring in towards the water. Dave slams us into reverse, wrenches the wheel around. We shoot back and around. Then for a split second we are motionless. The elephant is six or seven car lengths away and closing fast. Dave bangs the driver's door and shouts at her, but she is determined to show this tin pachyderm who is boss. We speed away. The mad cow stops, shakes her trunk and ears, then looks around, like a playground bully seeking any signs of mockery in the onlookers. There is another smaller cow elephant standing near. She'd seen everything. Maybe she sniggered. Next thing, the mad cow is chasing her off behind the ebony tree.</p> <p>\"Some of theses elephants might not have seen vehicles or even humans before,\" says Carson. \"So we are careful with them.\"</p> <p>Later on, when the skittish female has gone, we climb into the hide \u2013 a pile of protective logs around the bole of the ebony tree. All around are huge elephants and the sounds of water gurgling down large&#xa0;and thirsty throats. The sun dies in a blazing thorn tree behind us. After&#xa0;dark, when all the big animals have gone, I walk back to the lodge with Dave and we talk about tourism and conservation.</p> <p>\"The wildlife rangers do an amazing&#xa0;job keeping Hwange going,\" says Dave, shining his torch up into a tree to reveal an African scops owl. \"But without tourists it would be very&#xa0;vulnerable.\"</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398762415\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/gallery/2012/11/1/1351774877882/Mana-Pools-National-Park--001.jpg\" alt=\"Mana Pools National Park, Zimbabwe\" width=\"460\" height=\"277\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mana Pools, one of Zimbabwe\u2019s\u2019s leading attractions, is under threat from mining companies.

Without the economic clout that tourism brings, wilderness areas can offer little resistance to pressure from other business interests, notably mining. Mana Pools, a world heritage site and one of the country's leading attractions, is under threat from mining companies interested in its mineral sands, and Hwange itself is bordered by open-cast coal operations that are spilling over into the park. Everywhere wildlife is being called on to justify its existence. Beks Ndlovu puts it like this: \"If it is to survive, wildlife must have a value and tourism provides that. When we say that these areas should be protected and not mined or exploited in any other way that appears economically viable, it is tourism that gives us a powerful argument.\"</p>",

  "<p>The sun blazes low over Prague, gilding the gothic spires of the Old Town. It's the hottest April day since 1800, and the very stones are pulsing with&#xa0;unseasonal warmth. Into this 90F heatwave, Prague's cityfolk are preparing to launch a bonfire. It's unfortunate timing \u2013 but it's Witches' Night, and everyone knows you can't dispatch a hag without a fire.</p> <p>P\u00e1len\u00ed carodejnic \u2013 the burning of the witches \u2013 is the ultimate in charmingly wacko holidays, a pagan farewell to the spirits of winter which the Czechs inherited from their ancient Slavic forebears. These ancestors believed the forces of darkness were at their peak on 30 April and in the absence of holy water (not invented yet), hoped to purge the earth of evil by burning a witch in effigy. Apparently no one saw the irony in trying to repel the demonic hordes with a big old fire.</p> <p>Back to the present day and Prague's Witches' Night combines the costumed creepiness of Halloween with the alcoholism of Christmas.</p> <p>My witch burning of choice is a family friendly barbecue on Kampa Island, a city-centre oasis in the Vltava River. It starts with a parade of magical creatures and by 7.30pm an expectant gaggle of witch-watchers has gathered in the shadow of the Charles Bridge.</p> <p>\"Can you hear \u2026 something?\" a student-aged German girl asks. Suddenly, I can. A deep, pacy bongo beat is echoing from Malostransk\u00e9 n\u00e1mest\u00ed, the Lesser Town Square. And then, with a whoop, the wild rumpus descends: a cackling, broom-toting, horn-blowing crone conga is dancing its way towards us.</p> <p>Toddlers ride by on parental shoulders, brandishing plastic pitchforks. A fiend swoops on a bystander, provoking: \"Oh my God!\" and a dropped ice-cream. It looks like the cast of Narnia got boozed and raided a goth jumble sale. Within minutes a crowd has joined the dance like rats after the Pied Piper.</p> <p>At the front of the parade, a dummy witch is trussed up on a stick. Next in line is a sort of Vegas Satan in a red satin hood. He's pushing a cart containing a shrieking woman and several small children. The woman (witch, of course) rattles her manacles and screams: \"I am innocent,\" while the kids sit quietly by, all oversized cloaks and stop-it-mum eyes.</p> <p>Stomping in time to the drumbeats, the crone army moves down Ulice na Kampe, the street that links the Charles Bridge to the Kampa Park. This is the place where the witch will meet her fiery end \u2013 and everyone else will eat hotdogs. A folk band is playing wild gypsy music as the event's organiser, Miroslav Stejskal, makes his way to the stage. For 364 days of the year, Stejskal is director of police in the Prague 1 district. Tonight, he's a medieval MC with an executioner's robe and mad-monk demeanour.</p> <p>\"I call all the witches,\" he bellows. \"I ask you, should we grant her a pardon, or will she be executed?\" About half the crowd raise their hands for mercy.</p> <p>\"My friends, all of you who raised your hands will lose them.\" Two things are clear: Czech police are not to be trusted, and the hag's going to burn.</p> <p>The rag doll is perched above a jenga-like lattice of logs, and the sound of bongos rolls again as the chief witches dance around it. Onlookers jostle for position and smoke pours into the gathering dusk as first the wood, then the witch succumb to the flames.</p> <p>And then, something happens.</p> <p>Across the park, sausage sellers cease their sizzling. Portly papas put down their beers. Candy floss blows away, unmissed. To my left, a pensioner puts an arm around her granddaughter, pulling her close. We are as mesmerised as the pre-Christian shepherds who began this ritual, in thrall to the beauty of the burning pyre. Fictional ghouls hold little horror for Czechs who remember the suppressions and show trials of communism, but perhaps it's no surprise that Witches' Night attracts so many of them.</p> <p>Under the cobwebs and false noses, this is a celebration in which evil is purged and spring rides to victory, renewal on her mind. The Witches of the Kampa have live music, umpteen barbecues, fire jugglers, and enough home-brew to last out the hottest of nights. Were I the cackling type, I'd quit the coven at once and join the party.</p> <p>\u2022 <em>Wizz Air (<a href=\"http://www.wizzair.com\">wizzair.com</a>) flies direct from Luton to Prague from \u00a350 return.

  "<p>This time next week, we'll know. I hesitate to say we'll know by Wednesday morning: any journalist who covered the Bush v Gore Florida photo-finish of 2000 knows better than to tempt fate. But, barring a repeat of that freak event, it should be clear enough soon enough.</p> <p>Now is the moment the two duelling campaigns contemplate their destiny. What if Mitt Romney loses, as most of the blue-chip polling analysis says he will? It'll be a bitter personal defeat for a man who has been plotting this campaign since the moment his last one ended in failure. Seven days after he dropped out of the Republican primary race of 2008, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/30/us/politics/setback-leads-mitt-romney-to-reinvention.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0\" title=\"\">Romney gathered his allies around a boardroom table</a>, handing out a single-page memo he'd written about himself, detachedly laying out his own strengths and weaknesses and plotting the path to 2012.</p> <p>Some will say he has been running much longer, the ambition rooted in the crushing of his father's presidential hopes in 1968. Now Mitt Romney will be twice defeated with no chance of coming back. The stellar career in high finance that beckoned four years ago will surely beckon again \u2013 and this time with no nosy reporters demanding to know how much he pays in tax. (<a href=\"http://money.cnn.com/2012/09/21/pf/taxes/romney-tax-return/index.html\" title=\"\">14%</a>, since you ask.)</p> <p>But the consequences of a Romney defeat would go much wider than the job prospects of one supremely wealthy man. The Republican party would have to stare itself long and hard in the face. A loss on Tuesday would mean the party had won the popular vote only once since 1988, when George W Bush beat John Kerry in 2004. In the five other elections, the Democrats would have beaten them. That is a shocking record that lays bare a deep, structural problem.</p> <p>Its base is shrinking before its eyes. The old \"southern strategy\" pioneered with such success by Richard Nixon, in which Republicans commandeered the white vote, often by playing on racial anxieties, worked wonders for decades. But now that white vote accounts for too small a share of the electorate: Romney is on course to win about 60% of it, but it's still not enough. <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/as-republican-convention-emphasizes-diversity-racial-incidents-intrude/2012/08/29/b9023a52-f1ec-11e1-892d-bc92fee603a7_story.html\" title=\"\">As the Republican senator Lindsey Graham so memorably</a> put it: \"The demographics race we're losing badly. We're not generating enough angry white guys to stay in business for the long term.\"</p> <p>The problem is that Republicans have not compensated for that decline in white numbers with gains elsewhere. Steve Schmidt, campaign manager for John McCain in 2008, put it starkly when we met: \"We have been horrific\" towards Hispanic-Americans, he said, adding that the party needed to start speaking to that rising population with \"respect\". George W Bush made an effort in that direction with some results, but any progress has been reversed this time. Obama is expected to win as much as <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/news/politics/la-pn-race-polarized-electorate-20121031,0,2198469.story\" title=\"\">75% of the Hispanic vote</a>.</p> <p>That problem with minorities \u2013 and one poll showed Romney's black support at <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/08/21/mitt-romney-black-vote_n_1820329.html\" title=\"\">a striking 0%</a> \u2013 is both cause and effect of its shrinking base. If only \"angry white guys\", or Tea Partiers and evangelical Christians, are taking part in presidential primaries, that is bound to have a distorting effect. Romney is a case in point. In theory, he could have been a candidate with crossover appeal: a moderate, proven businessman who had won in Democratic Massachusetts. But to win the Republican nomination he had to change, becoming what he called a \"severe conservative\", dropping his previous stances in favour of abortion rights and gun control and, in order not to be outflanked on his right, telling undocumented immigrants, most Hispanic, to \"self-deport\".</p> <p>This is the Republicans' existential problem. They have retreated ever deeper into an ideological laager, shaped by a narrow, nationally unrepresentative Christian right, until they have reached the point where anyone acceptable to them is unacceptable to the rest of the country. Romney was the only plausible candidate on offer from the freakshow they had to choose from \u2013 but competing in the freakshow turned him into someone implausible.</p> <p>If Romney loses on Tuesday, Republicans will have to acknowledge that they threw away an election that, by rights, should have been theirs. They faced an incumbent with low approval ratings and weighed down by an unemployment rate hovering around 8%: no US president since Franklin Roosevelt had been re-elected with such a high jobless number. This was their election to lose. If they lose it, they will need to contemplate the most profound change.</p> <p>And what if the polls in the critical swing states don't hold up and Obama loses? The brutal truth is that neither American politics nor history looks kindly on one-term presidents. They&#xa0;are instantly deemed failures. Jimmy Carter had to undertake a 30-year penance of good works in order to rehabilitate his reputation and absolve the grave sin of losing. Many Democrats would be similarly embarrassed by a defeated Obama, unsentimentally branding him a non-person. Many will say the party made a grave mistake and that it should have gone for Hillary in 2008, a view that will be nourished by this week's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/nov/02/hillary-clinton-mitt-romney-poll\" title=\"\">YouGov poll finding that Clinton would have beaten Romney</a> by a comfortable six points.</p> <p>The last four years will be regarded as an aberration, <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/charles-krauthammer-the-choice/2012/11/01/59b5bed0-2445-11e2-9313-3c7f59038d93_story.html\" title=\"\">\"a historical parenthesis, a passing interlude of overreaching hyper-liberalism, rejected by a center-right country that is 80% nonliberal,\"</a> according to the ultra-conservative commentator, Charles Krauthammer. Everything Obama did \u2013 his Keynesian stimulus, his bailout of the car industry, his reform of healthcare \u2013 will be condemned as a mistake, including by many Democrats who will succumb to the right's critique and fault Obama for veering too far left. Only the killing of Osama bin Laden will earn him any credit.</p> <p>Worse, and this will rarely be articulated out loud, too many Americans will see the first black presidency as a kind of failed experiment: we tried it, but it didn't work out. In a silent way, the bar for non-white candidates, already so high, will be even higher.</p> <p>The world outside America is backing Obama, the polls show it, but without the fervour of four years ago. Some on the left see little difference between him and Romney, on, say, drones, civil liberties or the Middle East; the odd nuance, perhaps, but otherwise they are&#xa0;Tweedledum and Tweedledee.</p> <p>Big mistake. Some of us heard the same refrain in 2000: no difference between Gore and Bush, who cares who wins? And we all know how that worked out.</p> <p><em>Twitter: </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/j_freedland\" title=\"\"><em>@j_freedland</em></a></p>",
  "<p>When hurricane Sandy struck, Fifi Bouille was giving birth in a refugee camp. There were no medics around, only her sisters. Throughout the three-hour labour, rain beat down on the tent and fierce winds tugged at the canvas.</p> <p>Not long after the umbilical cord was cut, the gusts were so great that the sisters feared the covering would be ripped from above them, so the first-time mother had to carry her newborn son through muddy paths in the middle of the the storm to find new shelter \"I was terrified my baby might die,\" says Bouille, who is now sharing a tent with six others. The danger of the storm has passed, but she is now faced by a new concern: how to feed her child and herself.</p> <p>The hurricane did not just take their tent, but their cooking utensils, bedding and meagre supplies of food. On Wednesday, she had one meal of corn. On Thursday, nothing.</p> <p>\"I need food, but I don't have enough money to buy it,\" she says. \"Tell people we need nappies, cooking utensils, protein.\"</p> <p>Bouille is not alone in fearing that Sandy's aftermath may be more terrible than the storm itself for Haiti. Although the world's attention has mostly focused on the hurricane's impact on the United States, the short-term suffering and long-term consequences for this Caribbean nation \u2013 the poorest country in the western hemisphere \u2013 are far greater because so many people already live permanently on the edge of catastrophe.</p> <p>Bouille moved to the Marassa refugee camp after her home and family were destroyed by a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/jan/17/no-room-cemetery-haiti?intcmp=239\" title=\"\">devastating earthquake in January 2010</a>. As with the storms before and after, the impact of that disaster was worsened by high levels of poverty, dire infrastructure and weak governance.</p> <p>Almost three years after the earthquake, 350,000 people in the capital of Port-au-Prince are still living in camps for displaced refugees.</p> <p>Over the past three years, hundreds who now live in the Marassa camp have been forced to flee twice: from homes destroyed in the quake, to tents which were ripped and flooded in the storm, and to a temporary shelter in a fire station. Since Sandy struck, the camp's inhabitants have rebuilt their simple church made of sheets of corrugated iron, but are still waiting for new tents and food supplies.</p> <p>Community leaders say cholera and hunger stalk the 3,500 camp residents, and starvation had claimed one life shortly before Sandy struck. Aid groups such as Oxfam have helped, but humanitarian support has ebbed in the past two years.</p> <p>\"We need food,\" said Mogaline Richard. \"There have been promises, but nothing has come yet.\"</p> <p>Haitians of proud of their country's origins. Later this month, people will celebrate the great battle fought by sugarcane slaves against their French overlords that led to the establishment of the world's first black-led republic in 1804.</p> <p>But Johan Peleman, head of the United Nation's Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs, warns: \"This country is very vulnerable. It has the world's worst cholera epidemic and 3.5% of people in the capital are still living in tents.\"</p> <p>Haiti was only hit by Sandy's tail, but 54 people died and 20 are still missing. Prime minister Laurent Lamothe described it as a \"disaster of major proportions\". There is little resentment that the US gets far more attention. Instead, the mood is more one of resignation that a catastrophe in a poor country is less of a story.</p> <p>\"This is not the first nor the last disaster we will have. We have seen so much worse that we are relieved there is only this,\" noted Emmelie Prophete\u2013Milc\u00e9, a writer based in Port-au-Prince. \"In New York disasters do not happen every day so the media have a good catch. In Haiti the disasters come every day. Well, almost.\"</p> <p>Even before Sandy, Haiti had more cholera cases than the rest of the world put together. Almost 6% of the population have been affected and 7,500 people have died.</p> <p>To respond to the rush of cases this month, M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res have opened an extra cholera treatment centre in Carrefour, where the tents are now almost filled with 158 patients, including many young children.</p> <p>Ezechial Maxi, a journalism student, came in on Monday after being turned away by the general hospital. \"The doctors were on strike because they have no medicine and they're not getting paid. I was crying. I knew I had cholera and thought I was going to die.\"</p> <p>After being put on an IV drip with a simple rehydrating formula, he has now almost fully recovered.</p> <p>Cholera is a disease of the poor. It is not difficult to avoid or treat if basic sanitation and clean water are available. But in much of Port-au-Prince, this is not the case. Many road are flooded. Street markets keep their food on the wet, rubbish-strewn and easily contaminated floor.</p> <p>Sandy will add to those risks, but, says Joan Arnan, the head of MSF's mission in Haiti: \"When it goes away, there'll still be cholera and misery in this country. The problem here is structural. We're talking about a very fragile country that cannot respond. Unless there is more support for the international community, this situation will repeat itself every time there is a big storm.\"</p> <p>More than any single disaster, the danger is from a steady accumulation of problems and not just in the city.</p> <p>Sandy turned dirt roads and paths into deep, fast running streams in the village of Jacquet in the district of Gantheir, an hour north-east of Port-au-Prince. About three-quarters of the people in this community of 2,850 people had their homes destroyed. Most of the homes were built from the same mud that gushed down from the denuded mountainside. All that was left of the school was a few dozen breeze blocks, upended desks and a twisted blackboard that still had the lesson notes \"history needs its documents\" chalked up in French. The nearby football pitch and farm fields were filled with mud and rocks.</p> <p>Downstream, homes made of mud walls and tin roofs had either collapsed or been flooded. There were already seven people to a small room in some of them. Now the community is squashed tighter in the few homes that remain dry and strong.</p> <p>\"The water came into our homes at midnight. There was just a little at first, but by 4am it had turned into a torrent of mud that took away almost everything we owned,\" said Yanick Thelemarque, a mother of seven who has only eaten one meal in the past two days.</p> <p>Food insecurity is growing. More than 70% of crops, including bananas, plantains and maize, were destroyed in the south of the country, officials say.</p> <p>\"Our harvest is gone and we don't have enough money to buy anything so, after we brush our teeth in the morning, our mouths are empty for the whole day,\" Thelemarque said.</p> <p>For several villagers, this was the second or third time in three years that a disaster had ruined their homes.</p> <p>Jean-Tholere Cenat, a farmer, lost his house and crops of potatoes, beans and leaks. \"The flood left us alive, but took our spirits,\" he says. \"Tell people we need food and housing.\"</p> <p>In the past food shortages have led to violence. The anger is already evident here. After the deputy mayor came to hear their problems, an irate crowd came away yelling: \"We're hungry!\"</p> <p>Local people say it was not always this way. \"Life was better for us 20 years ago, when schooling was free and a little land was enough to feed and family,\" says Jean-Carlo Prosper, who runs a non-governmental organisation that works with Oxfam to ease the problems and help people rebuild. \"Now everything is more expensive. There are more people and the soil quality is worse because it has to be constantly cultivated.\"</p> <p>On the radio, people hear how the US has suffered as a result of Sandy and they sympathise. But, although it was the same storm, its impact seems to have played out in two different worlds.</p> <p>Reports that electricity was slowly being restored in New York contrasted here with villages that had no electricity to begin with.</p> <p>Dieula Geffrard lost her home and her husband in the 2010 earthquake. The refugee tent she and her four children moved into afterwards was destroyed by a storm the same year.</p> <p>Her portable home in Kafou Desruissaux, about an hour's drive from Port-au-Prince, has now been inundated with mud.</p> <p>\"My home wasn't strong enough to withstand the floods, which took away my bed, clothes and shoes,\" she says.</p> <p>She counts herself lucky, though, to be alive. After the waters subsided , she found the body of her neighbour, the town tailor. \"This place has been forgotten,\" says Geffrard, \"Please help us.\"</p> <p><em>Additional reporting: Jean-Daniel Delone</em></p>",

Local IRA members were blamed for the attack.</p> <p>A detective told Belfast magistrates court on Friday that although Wilson was not charged directly in connection with the murder of McCartney, the charges related to an internal investigation by the IRA following the murder.</p> <p>The magistrate said her concern was that Wilson could interfere with witnesses who include McCartney's sisters. Wilson was remanded in custody for four weeks.</p> <p>The murdered man's sisters launched an international campaign to bring his killers to justice, accusing the local IRA of helping to clean up all the forensic evidence from the bar and then intimidate witnesses.</p> <p>Wilson was and remains a key supporter of Sinn F\u00e9in's peace strategy and after his release from jail for a time was the party's international affairs director. During his incarceration in the Maze prison he met the late Dr Mo Mowlam as part of delicate negotiations aimed at winning the IRA inmates' support for the Good Friday agreement.</p>",

  "<p>The <a href=\"http://www.fco.gov.uk/en/travel-and-living-abroad/travel-advice-by-country/middle-east-north-africa/egypt\" title=\"\">Foreign Office has raised its terrorism warning</a> for visitors to Egypt from medium to high, particularly urging Britons against travel to the Sinai region, after a recent spate of militant attacks.</p> <p>The change comes on the same day that a report revealed that police in Egypt had foiled a plot by al-Qaida-linked militants to attack tourists in the popular Red Sea coastal resort of Sharm el-Sheikh. The <a href=\"http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/sharm-el-sheikh-terror-plot-foiled-1412228\" title=\"\">Mirror said</a> the attack, involving firearms and rocket-propelled grenades, had been planned for Christmas.</p> <p>A Foreign Office spokeswoman said she could not comment on any link, adding that changes to travel advice were based on \"a number of sources\".</p> <p>While Sharm el-Sheikh is on the southern tip of the Sinai peninsula, it and other nearby resorts, Taba, Nuweiba and Dahab, are excluded from the Foreign Office advice against travel to the region.</p> <p>The Foreign Office spokeswoman said: \"We can confirm that on 2 November we amended our travel advice for Egypt. Our advice makes clear that there is a high threat from terrorism in Egypt.\"</p> <p>Its website says: \"Although security is tight throughout the country, especially in resort areas, there remains a high risk of attacks, which could be indiscriminate, including in public places frequented by expatriates and foreign travellers such as hotels and restaurants.\"</p> <p>The advice warns against all travel to north Sinai, where there have been <a href=\"www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/17/egyptian-soldier-killed-sinai-attacks\" title=\"\">attacks on security forces near the border</a> with Gaza and Egypt, including one which killed 16 soldiers.</p> <p>The advice says that even in south Sinai security has deteriorated this year, with a number of hijacks and kidnaps away from resort areas.</p> <p>Egypt has been trying to rebuild its tourism industry after last year's widespread unrest ended the long rule of Hosni Murbarak as president.</p> <p>Last month the antiquities minister, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-19912940\" title=\"\">Muhammad Ibrahim, reopened the restored pyramid of Chefren</a> and six tombs at Giza, using the occasion to stress the country's safety for tourists.</p>",
  "<p>When London Metropolitan University's right to sponsor foreign students was revoked this autumn, university and student bodies reacted with outrage. Thousands of international students had their university places snatched away from them \u2013 and, despite being <a href=\"http://\" title=\"\">granted a temporary reprieve</a>, the university faced a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2012/sep/03/london-metropolitan-university-ukba-student-visa-rules?intcmp=239\" title=\"\">\u00a330m hole in its budget</a>.</p> <p>This week another institution, Bilston Community College, had its highly-trusted sponsor status revoked.</p> <p>Located in the Black Country, and with a far smaller intake than London Met, the plight of its overseas students is unlikely to provoke the same media furore. But when the news is reported abroad it will make future students think twice about coming to the UK to study, says Duncan Lane of the UK Council for International Student Affairs.</p> <p>\"It will be a great worry to students who are deciding whether or not to study here \u2013 and to their parents.\"</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-birmingham-20178483\" title=\"\">Speaking to the BBC</a>, Phil Page, a Wolverhampton city councillor for Bilston North, who also acts as a director for the college, says he's been told the college is appealing against the UK Border Agency's decision.</p> <p>All current students can remain at the college until 20 December, when an application for a judicial review about the college's visa status will be held.</p> <p>Lane says the revocation of Bilston's licence will provoke anxiety among the country's education providers, adding that he has \"great sympathy\" with institutions who fall short of UKBA regulations.</p> <p>\"It's difficult to see how anyone could safely comply with every element of the system \u2013 and it's ever-changing.</p> <p>\"When the system was being introduced in late 2008, the idea was that it would provide a transparent, simplified system \u2013 we've ended up with something far more complex.\"</p> <p>Kris Hall, principal of Isis Language School, says bureaucratic regulations have already caused a drop in the number of overseas students enrolling at his college.</p> <p>\"I feel we are the victims of an ill-thought-out policy that was designed to appease concern about immigration problems but, in fact, has had little effect on migrant workers as most of this influx is from the EU where visas are not required anyway.</p> <p>\"This is damaging to business interests at a time when the economy needs help.\"</p> <p>A report published by the Higher Education International Unit found the UK is cheaper than the US and Australia in terms of fees and living costs \u2013 with appropriate controls in place, says Hall, these benefits should be used to attract more students.</p> <p>Lily Shen, immigration adviser at Study Group, says that the UK's points-based system is relatively simple compared to some countries' application processes.</p> <p>\"As a points-based system, there is little emotion or subjectivity involved \u2014 if you have enough points, you qualify.\"</p> <p>But it's not hard to find students who are unhappy with the regulations. Computing student Aminul Haque Robin says his first experience of the UK visa system was good, but he experienced delays when transferring university, causing him to miss the start of his course. He received no explanation for the delay.</p> <p>The media has been awash with stories of British inefficiencies this summer, with UKBA delays leaving hundreds of international students stranded without identity documents, and staff shortages forcing many others to queue all night to register with the police.</p> <p>But if students miss deadlines or struggle academically, they can be excluded from their institution. And although the right of appeal exists, students are granted only a 60-days grace period in which to remain in the country and pursue their case.</p> <p>The body to which students may appeal, the Office of the Independent Adjudicator, can take months to decide.</p> <p>Margaret Hodge MP, chair of the Committee of Public Accounts says the way international students are treated by immigration services is in need of drastic change. She suggests that, as a starting point, students should be counted separately from other immigration groups.</p> <p>Until then, computing student Robin says applicants should ensure their paperwork is faultless \u2013 and remember that the system is unpredictable. Authorities will not take into account the course start date when considering an application, so students must be prepared well in advance.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 12 November 2012 to include Lily Shen's place of work, Study Group</p>",
  "<p>So farewell then, Chicago Fire and Vancouver Whitecaps \u2013 seems like only yesterday we were talking about how far you would go in the playoffs.</p> <p>So now we have eight remaining teams \u2013 and looking at the list, they are all sides who at certain moments this season have looked like this might be their year, though San Jose Earthquakes and to a lesser extent Sporting Kansas City (unbeaten in 16 games but a little wobbly as spring turned to summer) have perhaps been the only sides to have consistently looked like they were going to top their conferences.</p> <p>But now we're into knockout soccer, and the regular-season accumulation of points begins to look less important than momentum.Chicago and Vancouver, for all they had done at certain points of the year, arrived in the playoffs struggling and were duly eliminated by Houston Dynamo and LA Galaxy.</p> <p><strong>Houston</strong> must now face <strong>Sporting KC</strong> in the Eastern semi-finals, in a repeat of last year's Eastern final, while the <strong>Galaxy </strong>move on to stage a pair of California Clasicos with <strong>San Jose Earthquakes</strong>, which should be unmissable. In the other semi-finals, we'll be back with our live coverage tonight as <strong>Real Salt Lake</strong> take on <strong>Seattle Sounders</strong> in a repeat of their semi-final last year. This time, Seattle don't have the home advantage that turned out to be not much advantage anyway.</p> <p>Speaking of home advantage, it was one of the very minor issues at stake when <strong>DC United</strong> and <strong>New York Red Bulls</strong> made the decision to switch their semi-final venues in the wake of Hurricane Sandy. The Red Bull Arena is in a low-lying part of Jersey that has been badly affected by the damage to the state's infrastructure and there is no guarantee that we'll have play there on the rescheduled Wednesday date.</p> <p>A special shout-out, then, to our New York previewers for the semi-finals \u2013 Dan Ryazansky of Metrofanatic and Dan Dickinson of Gothamist, who have been dealing with intermittent power, flooding and God knows what else this week, but still found time to set us up with their takes on the semi-finals. On the other coast, a big shout-out too to our LA contingent, for surfing off pure adrenalin from their game on Thursday night, in order to get us their semi-final previews after a big night at the Home Depot Center. Houston's crew did the same \u2013 deliriously \u2013 on Wednesday. In fact, as usual all of our fan reps, bloggers, podcasters and beat writers have been generous with their time in covering their teams, and we at the Guardian salute them. See you tonight for the next installment \u2013 <strong>Seattle Sounders v Real Salt Lake. We'll be live around 9.30pm</strong>.</p> <p><em>All semi-finals are played over two legs. Lowest-seeded team hosts first, with the exception of the DC United v New York Red Bulls game, which has been switched due to the effects of Hurricane Sandy.</em></p> <h2>Seattle Sounders v Real Salt Lake, Friday 10pm (NBCSN)</h2> <p><strong>Western semi-final</strong> </p> <p><strong>Dave Clark</strong>, <a href=\"\" http: www.sounderatheart.com \"\">Sounder at Heart</a>, Seattle:</p> <p>It was a disappointing season. After 2011's high-powered offense and a trade to make it better the Sounders scored fewer goals in 2012. There was the long winless run in the regular season after an extraordinary start. Later there would be the loss of the US Open Cup. Finally, with a strong chance at second in the West and third overall the Sounders were shutout by the LA Galaxy. That's a lot of pent up could-have and should-have-beens.</p> <p>If there's something that's awesome about the fact that MLS has playoffs, it's that the short run to end to the season offers a small correction for the unbalanced schedule and a final chance for a club to make its claim for greatness. Seattle has that chance now. Fans are hyped, without expectations. Three straight years of playoff failure weigh heavily on the souls of the Rave Green. It is a weight that could be lifted quickly with a resounding victory on Friday night, or at least removed with a run in the second season.</p> <p>Now is the time for the Sounders to seize the initiative \u2013 to be Sounders. They will only go as far as they can impose their own will.</p> <p><strong>Sam Chesneau</strong>, <a href=\"http://www.gorillafc.com/\">Gorilla FC</a>, Seattle:</p> <p>What a difference a game makes. Prior to the final match of the regular season, everybody seemed excited about what was to come. Finally a healthy starting XI, and a win over the Galaxy would've meant the third-most points and a very good chance at hosting the MLS Cup, should the Sounders be able to get through the Western Conference. But they had to play the match. Much like last year's meaningless match against Chivas USA, when Mauro Rosales went down with an injury, down went Eddie Johnson before the end of the first half in the same stadium against the other team from Carson, CA. Our leading scorer with a hamstring injury, right before the playoffs, not to mention the fact that the Carson Galaxy ended up scoring in the 83rd-minute to drop the Sounders down four places to the No7 overall seeding, thus eliminating any chance of a packed CLink in an MLS Cup unless Houston some how comes out of the Eastern Conference and the Sounders meet what is surely their expectations \u2013 winning the Western Conference. </p> <p>I say that because there are no alternatives at this point. Anything less would mean a season that yielded disappointing results with the talent that we have. From the get go, top down, our ownership and management has made it a priority to compete at the top level in <em>all</em> competitions. The only way the Sounders can continue to meet any part of that expectation is with a trip to the final, as the US Open Cup and Supporters Shield are no longer options. They face a very tough test in Real Salt Lake, a team that matches up very evenly and well with the Sounders. The part that is so frustrating at this point as a fan is knowing that anything can happen. The Sounders are more than capable of winning this series with the Lakers, with or without Eddie Johnson. After that? Not so much. I wouldn't be a supporter if I didn't genuinely believe they can do it. Seattle 2-1 in the home leg, 1-1 in the away leg is my prediction.</p> <p><strong>Denzel Eslinger</strong>, <a href=\"http://www.rslperspective.com/\">RSL Soapbox</a>:</p> <p>So Real Salt Lake heads into the playoffs with what one would have to call a mixed bag of recent results \u2013 the upside is just a single loss in their last 10 overall matches (including eight league matches). The downside is three straight 0-0 draws, including the 0-0 draw at home against CS Herediano that put them out of the Champions League. So while RSL can celebrate the fact that they have given up just three goals in the last two months, they also have to deal with the fact they have scored just two in their last four matches.</p> <p>I like to be the \"glass is half full\" guy when it comes to RSL: the reality is that RSL haven't given up a goal to Seattle in their three regular-season matches this year and RSL is building on playoff experience that has seen them play in three conference finals in the last four years. I won't focus on anything but what RSL has shown this year \u2013 team highs in wins, points and road wins \u2013 when I say that RSL will not only win the series but I think they will pick up a win on the road in the opener at Seattle, 2-1.</p> <p><strong>Matt Montgomery</strong>, <a href=\"http://underthecrossbar.com/\">Under the Crossbar</a>, Real Salt Lake:</p> <p>If you were to write a memoir on Real Salt Lake's 2012 campaign, three or four of the chapters would deal with niggling injuries that kept players out for a few weeks. The back-and-forth, swaying nature of the lineups has been a point of frustration for fans. Going into the playoffs, that's still the case, though there is a sense that it could finally lift as RSL enters the final stage of the campaign.</p> <p>That frustration is perhaps helped along by a sense that, in part because of the Concacaf Champions League exit, chunks of RSL's core squad will start breaking away and a run in the playoffs could well be the last great chance to win a second trophy and make a mark on MLS. If it is to be the last great chance, the uphill battle of the playoffs seems more daunting than usual, with San Jose and LA both presenting clear barriers to an MLS Cup final.</p> <p>There is an air of inevitability about it, though: it was through some rather steep challenges that, in 2009, Real Salt Lake won their first (and only) trophy. But with the promise of 2009 turned into reality by 2012, the lack of further success on the big stage with this group has fans ready for another big win.</p> <p>Prediction: RSL 3-2 over Seattle in a drama-packed rehash of 2011</p> <h2>DC United v New York Red Bulls, Saturday 8pm (NBCSN)</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398764267\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/30/1346333005640/6dbb1f52-df9b-4bab-9587-dc38df5d3d6c-460.jpeg\" alt=\"Dwayne de Rosario 100 goals DC United New York Red Bulls\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dwayne De Rosario, here scoring for DC United against the New York Red Bulls in August, will miss the Conference semi-final between the two teams.

This young team has adopted a slightly more conservative approach since the loss of its captain, emphasizing work rate and defensive posture over flashiness. Its worked like a charm and Ben Olsen is suddenly a dark horse for coach of the year. </p> <p>And yet despite finishing with the third-highest points total in all of MLS and far better recent results, United won't be the favorite heading into its playoff series against the New York Red Bulls. Some will look at the scoring prowess of New York's Thierry Henry, Tim Cahill, Kenny Cooper and Sebastien Le Toux and wrongfully assume that DC doesn't stand a chance. Smarter observers will instead take note of the improved defensive play of Dejan Jakovic and Brandon McDonald and the sudden emergence of Bill Hamid as an elite goalkeeper and see this as a fairly even matchup. But I'll always take the team with four stars on its shirt over the team with no trophies in 17 years of existence.</p> <p><strong>Kim Kolb</strong>, <a href=\"http://screaming-eagles.com/\">Screaming Eagles</a>:</p> <p>United, while not exactly on fire, have come out of the season getting the results they needed. Since the beginning of September, they've lost only once and have rescued a win and tie in the last two games despite falling behind early. Also, in the last nine games United has only given up more than one goal on two occasions, as the defense and Bill Hamid have taken care of their own end. The concern, of course, is over whether United can score \u2013 the cost of the disciplined defense is productivity on the offensive end \u2013 though history has shown that the playoffs lean to defensively disciplined teams, and United has been playing with that playoff mentality since Dwayne DeRosario was lost to injury. The strength of the team in this time hasn't been any one or two individual players but the team as a whole, with different players stepping up to the challenges every week. </p> <p>Due to Hurricane/Frankenstorm Sandy, the game order has been switched to United hosting the first game and NY hosting the second midweek. In reality, this change doesn't have a great effect, especially when considering the short distances and familiarity between the teams. In the two-game total goals series, it's important to get ahead in the first game, regardless of the venue. Prediction: United to win the first game in DC and tie the second in New Jersey.</p> <p><strong>Dan Ryazansky</strong>, editor, <a href=\"http://www.metrofanatic.com\">Metrofanatic</a>, New York:</p> <p>When New York entered the last game of the regular season, they knew that homefield advantage was not an option. They could finish as high as third, meaning that playing the second leg at home was impossible (even though the actual value of such \"advantage\" can be debated). And yet they got a \"gift\" from Hurricane Sandy, leading to the reversal of the two legs and DC hosting the opener.</p> <p>It looks like \"Clever\" Hans Backe has finally settled on a lineup, which means Heath Pearce (finally!) on the left, Rafa Marquez (surprisingly adequate in his last two matches) in central defense, Teemu Tainio in defensive midfield and Dax McCarty on the flank \u2013 clearly not his best position but, ever the trooper, he always finds a way to contribute. Titi Henry and Kenny Cooper were up to their old tricks again, combining for three goals in taking care of Philly. At the end this team will go as far as Titi will take them... as long as the patchwork defense holds.</p> <p><strong>Dan Dickinson</strong>, sports editor, <a href=\"http://www.gothamist.com\">Gothamist</a>, New York:</p> <p>It's been a strange final stretch for New York. In their last six they managed two landslide wins (over non-playoff Toronto and Philadelphia), two home losses (thrashings delivered by Kansas City and Chicago to blemish an otherwise spotless home record), and two draws (nearly grasping three points at New England before falling apart at the death, then a dominant draw against Kansas City). It's been an inconsistent year, and the final weeks were no exception to that \u2013 but the mixture of tough and weak opponents means that this was a good final opportunity to shake out whatever final issues were there before entering the playoffs.</p> <p>Avoiding the play-in game means NY gets to renew their rivalry with DC \u2013 they've met three times in the playoffs but NY has never made it past them. DC has been no slouch in the final stretch but it's almost entirely been against non-playoff sides. Consider everything NY has gotten through in that last month \u2013 tough competition, the death of a youth coach, Erik Soler's firing, insinuation that Hans Backe is a lame duck, injuries to Lloyd Sam and Brandon Barklage and now a hurricane that has forced their games to be rearranged. And yet with all of that going on, they slowly honed their performances and look like they might be peaking. I think they can easily grind out the series over DC \u2013 but expect United's faithful to demand asterisks be placed next to any victory NY achieves, given their sacrifice of the home-field advantage.</p> <h2>Houston Dynamo v Sporting Kansas City, Sunday 3.30pm (NBC)</h2> <p><strong>Eastern semi-final</strong> </p> <p><strong>Zach Woosley</strong>, <a href=\"http://www.dynamotheory.com/\">Dynamo Theory</a>, Houston:</p> <p>At some point I'm going to finally to remember that \"In Dom We Trust\" means \"In Dom We Trust\"\u2026 all the time. Once again, the Dynamo have gone through a season struggling to win on the road, only to become an MLS version of the Road Warrior when the playoffs start. Admittedly, Wednesday night's victory had as much to do with what Chicago didn't do as what Houston did, but all that really matters is that Kinnear set up his team to play a style of game, they executed the plan and the Fire walked into the trap.</p> <p>It's impossible not to be stupidly optimistic about a series against Sporting KC. Yes they are a great team, yes they are the top seed, but Houston has stood toe to toe with them this season and they did roll into LSP last season and beat them for the conference title. Basically, these two teams are familiar with each other and know what to expect. So what could make the difference? Ricardo Clark and Adam Moffat. Our naranja wrecking crew midfield is going to be counted on to disrupt, annoy and hopefully shut down KC's dynamic attack. The uglier the next 180 minutes of soccer are, the better for the Dynamo. The first game will be key. Houston is unbeatable at home, so a solid result on Sunday could put serious pressure on KC and that would be a good thing.</p> <p><strong>Mike Porter</strong>, <a href=\"http://texianarmy.org/\">Texian Army</a>, Houston:</p> <p>Great road performance by the Dynamo! Solid passing and posession throughout the entire match. Will Bruin took advantage of defensive mistakes and that's all she wrote. Tally Hall stepped up and commanded the box when he needed to and came up with saves to secure the win. On to Sporting KC: Graham Zusi basically plays a similiar game to Davis and I wouldn't be surprised if he finds the woodwork with some of his crosses. I believe Kei Kamara will squander a couple chances to score as he seems to lack the ability to finish plays on his own.</p> <p>I predicted a 2-1 road win in Chicago and it came true... so I expect to see a hard fought 3-1 home victory in person on Sunday. Second-half heroics from Brian Ching... we will see... more goals from Bruin, probably.</p> <p><strong>Malena Barajas</strong>, co-founder, <a href=\"http://womenunitedfc.com/\">Women United FC</a>, Sporting Kansas City:</p> <p>Sporting KC is ready to win the MLS Cup, looking strong coming into the playoffs. Facing the Houston Dynamo in the Eastern Conference semifinals is the best scenario. SKC was devastated by the loss to the Dynamo in last year's playoffs. The team crumbled at home, and there was a shakeup in the locker room with then DP Omar Bravo upset over his belief that he played too few minutes in the match. This season is different. Not only does Sporting have a better locker-room atmosphere, the team has matured into the best defense in the League. It has been after the cup since the start of the season, and revenge against the Dynamo will fuel that drive.</p> <p>The defense led by goalkeeper Jimmy Nielsen and defender Matt Besler will continue to hold it down in the back, and the very motivated goalscorers, Kei Kamara and CJ Sapong, will hold it down up top. Paolo Nagamura will be out for the next match or two, but there is a possibility that Roger Espinoza will feel ready to return. Jacob Peterson has found his rhythm, which will help fill any voids created by the absence of any of the regular starters. And with Zusi directing set pieces, the midfield is in very good shape.</p> <p>My prediction: Sporting KC will advance to the Eastern Conference Championship with a decisive win at home against the Dynamo; SKC will then face New York Red Bulls, shutting down Henry and his boys; and SKC will face and defeat the San Jose Earthquakes for the MLS Cup.</p> <p><strong>Mike Kuhn</strong>, editor, <a href=\"http://www.downthebyline.com/\">Down the Byline</a>, Sporting Kansas City:</p> <p>Sporting KC heads into the playoffs on a season-high 12-game unbeaten run, by the time they take the field against the Houston Dynamo on Sunday it will have been almost 100 days since they lost a competitive match. But to make it to 100 days, they'll have to get by a team that has been a bogey ever since they came into the league. The Dynamo have controlled the series against Sporting throughout their history, especially in Houston where KC hasn't won since their very first game there. </p> <p>The 0-1-2 record this year doesn't speak well for the matchup for KC, but they do have the revenge factor on their minds. Dominic Kinnear has had Peter Vermes' number and took him to coaching school in the Eastern Conference finals last year, when the Dynamo played KC off the park. Part of me believes that they wanted this matchup, that they wanted to take it to the team that knocked them out of the playoffs last year. Well, they would get that wish. This series isn't going to be a pretty one \u2013 it's going to be a tough, physical affair. SKC is going to have to rely on their defense and their strong defending against set pieces to see them through on the road and then take care of business at home. In Houston I'm not sure KC takes care of business, but the series as a whole I think KC finds a way past the Dynamo and through to the East finals.</p> <h2>LA Galaxy vs San Jose Earthquakes, Sunday 9pm (ESPN)</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398764268\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/11/2/1351832543128/99886ed7-5e73-49a3-a220-f0cf7b329024-460.jpeg\" alt=\"Omar Gonzalez LA Galaxy Los Angeles Galaxy Vancouver Whitecaps\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Los Angeles Galaxy's Omar Gonzalez, left, and Vancouver Whitecaps' Barry Robson contest a header during the first half of their MLS soccer wild-card game in Carson, California.

Hong/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><br><strong>Western Conference semi-final</strong></p> <p><strong>Josie Becker</strong>, editor, <a href=\"http://www.lagconfidential.com\">LAG Confidential</a>, Los Angeles:</p> <p>The LA Galaxy played better against Vancouver on Thursday night then they did the last time they faced them, getting balls in amongst the bunkered in defense. It took a second-half substitution to give the Galaxy enough manpower to overcome that wall and breach the Vancouver goal, but it was a goal that was coming as LA practiced siege warfare for almost the entire match. Almost 70% of the possession belonged to the Galaxy \u2013 and it was more than 70% in the first half. </p> <p>It's likely the Galaxy will get the lion's share of possession against San Jose as well, except the Quakes don't give you possession because they want to recreate the Seige of Harfleur, the way Vancouver does. San Jose plays a solid offense \u2013 it's always moving. They aren't interested in keeping possession, they want to push it and take shots as soon as possible. It's tough to stop and few teams have this year, and with the Galaxy in various states of fitness that's going to be a concern. </p> <p>Still, expect a firecracker of a series. </p> <p><strong>Josh Guesman</strong>, founder, <a href=\"www.thesection108.com\">The Section 108</a> blog, co-host of <a href=\"http://nasn.tv/category/corner-of-the-galaxy/\">Corner of the Galaxy</a> podcast, LA:</p> <p>If you were going to write a script for the perfect Vancouver start, it would have been to score in the opening minutes, taking advantage of an inexperienced right-back (Hector Jimenez) and then park the bus, getting all 11 men behind the ball for the next 87 minutes. Your tactic would be to frustrate your opponent. To make them think there was no way they could break down the two perfect rows of four defenders. To make them think there was no way through to the goal and that they were going to walk out of the Home Depot Center on the wrong end of an improbable upset. </p> <p>All went according to plan until Mike Magee, \"Mr Playoff,\" took a cross from Juninho in the 69th minute and volleyed home a 12-yard strike that brought the game level. The fact that Landon Donovan earned a penalty kick four minutes later, and gave LA the lead for the first time, was almost inconsequential. Once the possession and the effort paid off for the Galaxy, there was no stopping them. </p> <p>After the game, players were quoted as saying they had needed to get past this match because they \"wanted\" another shot at the Supporters' Shield winners. They wanted to rectify a 0-2-1 record against San Jose. They wanted a showdown between two teams that don't like each other. They wanted to settle it on the field. </p> <p>If I am San Jose, the last team I want to play is LA. They are hungry to defend their title and show the upstart Earthquakes where they belong. </p> <p><strong>\"Nerdy Gales\"</strong>, <a href=\"http://www.centerlinesoccer.com/\">Center Line Soccer</a>, San Jose:</p> <p>Going into the playoffs, there are many metrics by which to judge the San Jose Earthquakes' 2012 season: a Supporters' Shield-winning 66 points; Chris Wondolowski lacing up his golden boots for a career-, club- and MLS-record-tying goal tally of 27; an offensive powerhouse christened the \"Bash Brothers\" with a franchise-record 72 goals. Although many criteria for success have been met, the last and most significant task is now at hand: winning the MLS Cup. All these honors count for nothing on Sunday when the MLS Cup western bracket begins in Los Angeles. David Beckham will have to overcome his small-stadium syndrome and play for the first time at Buck Shaw next Wednesday. Of the Quakes starters, only recent arrival Mehdi Ballouchy is sidelined for the duration, so Frank Yallop has an almost full roster from which to make his selections. </p> <p>Quakes fans are optimistic that the club can go all the way to the final, and yet realistic that anything can happen in a playoff format. The unbeaten streak at Buck Shaw has invigorated the fans \u2013 manifested in standing ovations at each substitution, the beautifully assembled and inventive tifos by the 1906 Ultras and lively criticism of the fourth official as he fumbles with the electronic display for Goonie-Time at the end of each half. The hard work and never-say-die dedication of the players has spilled over into the stands and the fans have rediscovered their voice \u2013 it's louder than ever as they relish the opportunity to support the 2012 Earthquakes in their attempt to reclaim the MLS Cup. The synergy of the San Jose Earthquakes and their fans should ensure the win within the friendly confines of Buck Shaw. </p> <p><strong>Lisa Erickson</strong>, <a href=\"\" http: www.centerlinesoccer.com \"\">Center Line Soccer</a>, San Jose:</p> <p>The Supporters' Shield-winning San Jose Earthquakes are not taking for granted their need to figure out the problem with their defense. Recently, they have looked for their offense, with Chris Wondolowski, Alan Gordon and Steven Lenhart, to outscore all their previous opponents. This has led them to draw three out of four of their last matches. </p> <p>Now that the playoffs are here, Gordon stated: \"There is less forgiveness for errors. You got to tighten things up and you can't make mistakes. When you make mistakes, you're going to get punished. We have to be tuned in as a team and that's what has got us here.\" </p> <p>Defender Jason Hernandez echoed him, saying: \"Each play gets magnified. One mistake or one slip up can make the difference. It will be really important for us to focus on the details and become as close to perfect as possible in the way we play.\" </p> <p>But to look at their last games, it is also important to remember what coach Yallop states: \"Alan hasn't played. Simon [Dawkins] hasn't been fit. Both are key guys. We expect both to be fit for the weekend but you never know. For us, it's about what we've done consistently all year. Usually, if we've lost a game we won't lose two in a row. We haven't done it this year. If we lose one game, we come back and get either a tie or a win. Playoffs are a little different because there are two games, but we find a way to pick our game up and drive on. I don't see any difference with this group. Sunday and Wednesday is tough but I'd expect our players to raise our game.\"</p> <p>What is nice is to remember is the \"Goonies Never Say Die\" attitude \u2013 the Quakes have scored 40 goals after the 60th minute and most have been during stoppage time. The Quakes will have four sets of stoppage time per match up (with playing home and away), so I look to that as being a huge plus. Also, in the regular season the Quakes swept Seattle and Real Salt Lake and didn't lose to LA, so these are teams they know how to beat. I think that the Quakes will come out swinging and stay on top.</p>",
  "<p>The floods and fires that swept through our city left a path of destruction that will require years of recovery and rebuilding work. And in the short term, our subway system remains partially shut down, and many city residents and businesses still have no power. In just 14 months, two hurricanes have forced us to evacuate neighborhoods - something our city government had never done before. If this is a trend, it is simply not sustainable.</p> <p>Our climate is changing. And while the increase in extreme weather we have experienced in New York City and around the world may or may not be the result of it, the risk that it might be - given this week's devastation - should compel all elected leaders to take immediate action.</p> <p>Here in New York, our comprehensive sustainability plan - PlaNYC - has helped allow us to cut our carbon footprint by 16 percent in just five years, which is the equivalent of eliminating the carbon footprint of a city twice the size of Seattle. Through the C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group - a partnership among many of the world's largest cities - local governments are taking action where national governments are not.</p> <p><strong>Leadership needed</strong></p> <p>But we can't do it alone. We need leadership from the White House - and over the past four years, President Barack Obama has taken major steps to reduce our carbon consumption, including setting higher fuel-efficiency standards for cars and trucks. His administration also has adopted tighter controls on mercury emissions, which will help to close the dirtiest coal power plants (an effort I have supported through my philanthropy), which are estimated to kill 13,000 Americans a year.</p> <p>Mitt Romney, too, has a history of tackling climate change. As governor of Massachusetts, he signed on to a regional cap- and-trade plan designed to reduce carbon emissions 10 percent below 1990 levels. \"The benefits (of that plan) will be long-lasting and enormous - benefits to our health, our economy, our quality of life, our very landscape. These are actions we can and must take now, if we are to have 'no regrets' when we transfer our temporary stewardship of this Earth to the next generation,\" he wrote at the time.</p> <p>He couldn't have been more right. But since then, he has reversed course, abandoning the very cap-and-trade program he once supported. This issue is too important. We need determined leadership at the national level to move the nation and the world forward.</p> <p>I believe Mitt Romney is a good and decent man, and he would bring valuable business experience to the Oval Office. He understands that America was built on the promise of equal opportunity, not equal results. In the past he has also taken sensible positions on immigration, illegal guns, abortion rights and health care. But he has reversed course on all of them, and is even running against the health-care model he signed into law in Massachusetts.</p> <p>If the 1994 or 2003 version of Mitt Romney were running for president, I may well have voted for him because, like so many other independents, I have found the past four years to be, in a word, disappointing.</p> <p>In 2008, Obama ran as a pragmatic problem-solver and consensus-builder. But as president, he devoted little time and effort to developing and sustaining a coalition of centrists, which doomed hope for any real progress on illegal guns, immigration, tax reform, job creation and deficit reduction. And rather than uniting the country around a message of shared sacrifice, he engaged in partisan attacks and has embraced a divisive populist agenda focused more on redistributing income than creating it.</p> <p><strong>Important victories</strong></p> <p>Nevertheless, the president has achieved some important victories on issues that will help define our future. His Race to the Top education program - much of which was opposed by the teachers' unions, a traditional Democratic Party constituency - has helped drive badly needed reform across the country, giving local districts leverage to strengthen accountability in the classroom and expand charter schools. His health-care law -- for all its flaws -- will provide insurance coverage to people who need it most and save lives.</p> <p>When I step into the voting booth, I think about the world I want to leave my two daughters, and the values that are required to guide us there. The two parties' nominees for president offer different visions of where they want to lead America.</p> <p>One believes a woman's right to choose should be protected for future generations; one does not. That difference, given the likelihood of Supreme Court vacancies, weighs heavily on my decision.</p> <p>One recognizes marriage equality as consistent with America's march of freedom; one does not. I want our president to be on the right side of history.</p> <p>One sees climate change as an urgent problem that threatens our planet; one does not. I want our president to place scientific evidence and risk management above electoral politics.</p> <p>Of course, neither candidate has specified what hard decisions he will make to get our economy back on track while also balancing the budget. But in the end, what matters most isn't the shape of any particular proposal; it's the work that must be done to bring members of Congress together to achieve bipartisan solutions.</p> <p>Presidents Bill Clinton and Ronald Reagan both found success while their parties were out of power in Congress - and President Obama can, too. If he listens to people on both sides of the aisle, and builds the trust of moderates, he can fulfill the hope he inspired four years ago and lead our country toward a better future for my children and yours.

  "<p>On the BBC a few weeks ago the New York Times pundit David Brooks explained to his British audience that American voters are \"looking for an excuse to vote against the president\".

As hurricane Sandy roared up the US eastern seaboard, fate may have tipped the balance back in Obama's direction by showing him quietly in charge and reminding folks the government \u2013 local, state or federal \u2013 isn't always the enemy of Tea Party fantasy.</p> <p>Overnight we've also learned that New York's mayor, Michael Bloomberg, the little guy with the sign language aide at his side, soft-spoken but reassuring and on top of the detail, is backing Obama and by implication the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/nov/01/bloomberg-obama-endorsement-vote-big-government\" title=\"\">benign power of government</a>.</p> <p>That's quite a big deal, like Boris Johnson endorsing Ed Miliband \u2013 don't hold your breath, Ed \u2013 at the 2015 election here. Except that Bloomberg is an ex-Republican independent, a self-made billionaire who has the gravitas that Boris lacks, though he generally makes worse jokes.</p> <p>Hizzoner \u2013 as Americans call their big city mayors \u2013 is shrewdly political enough to praise Romney as a \"good and decent man\" who has done good things. Alas, \"he has reversed course on all of them\", including the healthcare model he created as governor of Massachusetts, the mayor noted in a statement. But the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/nov/01/bloomberg-endorses-obama-climate-change\" title=\"\">clincher for Bloomberg is Romney's hostility to climate change</a>.</p> <p>This week's devastation \"may or may not be\" a result, but the risk requires \"immediate action\", Bloomberg concludes. That's spot on too. When I <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/blog/2012/oct/30/frankenstorm-sandy-monstrous-media-hysteria\" title=\"\">mocked CNN's hysterical buildup</a> to hurricane Sandy here this week I got it partly wrong. The <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/nov/01/east-coast-normalcy-hurricane-sandy\" title=\"\">havoc and death it actually wreaked</a> \u2013 as opposed to the spine-chilling advance publicity \u2013 was more severe than I initially grasped, as we all now know.</p> <p>But one of my complaints, which remains valid, was the widespread reluctance of many Americans to concede that manmade climate change may be a crucial driver of its increasingly turbulent continental weather. The daily US weather map that most newspapers carry can be extraordinary, a Wagnerian drama which piles two feet of snow on Idaho on the same day that oranges are ripening in Florida sunshine. Floods, snow, twisters, droughts; it's never dull.</p> <p>Yet it remains an article of faith with many Americans that they can master nature as they mastered their vast land \u2013 chopped down its forests, dammed its rivers, cultivated its deserts, drilled for its oil, tamed its forest fires. Herman Melville's classic MobyDick told them otherwise \u2013 the sea always wins \u2013 but it's not a message everyone wants to hear. Obama's <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/nov/01/bloomberg-climate-change-closet-romney\" title=\"\">strategy</a> has been to let events talk for themselves.</p> <p>Bloomberg knows it \u2013 if you take a look at the storm, be careful, nature is stronger than us, he warned New Yorkers this week. After all, the great port city is surrounded by water \u2013 Manhattan, Long Island and Staten Island are just that \u2013 and the East and Hudson rivers are close to the vast Atlantic swell. The Thames Barrier, a mighty undertaking, currently protects London. It would not be enough to protect New York as water levels rise.</p> <p>The polarised ideological gridlock of Washington politics, far more severe than in post-cold-war Europe, exaggerates disagreements and damages politics: the failure to reach a compromise on federal taxes and spending still threatens the economic recovery, whoever wins on Tuesday. It needn't be that way. Just look at the courteous way Obama and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Christie\" title=\"\">Chris Christie</a>, admired Republican governor of New Jersey, have treated each other in this week's crisis.</p> <p>None of this plays Romney's way or the way Tea Party types want to see the world. I hesitate to say it's clinched re-election for the president. When Romney made his coarse assessment of the Democratic electoral base \u2013 the 47% of people who depend on benefits from the state \u2013 in September <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/sep/18/mitt-romney-video-leak-gaffe\" title=\"\">I suggested it might</a> \u2013 might \u2013 be the turning point, ensuring the challenger's defeat.</p> <p>So it might have done, but for Obama's strikingly feeble performance in the first presidential debate. It was precisely the sort of event which \u2013 to quote Brooks \u2013 gave wavering voters an excuse to vote him out. If he looked so disengaged that he didn't seem to want the job, why not let the other fellow have a go?</p> <p>After all, he had not lived up to expectations, though in fairness to Obama a kind reader on Twitter draws my attention to <a href=\"http://nymag.com/daily/intel/2012/10/barack-obama-is-a-great-president-yes-great.html\" title=\"\">this robust defence</a> of the president's record by Jonathan Chait in the New York magazine. In the later debates Obama fought back \u2013 and now the hurricane has played to his strengths.</p> <p>Does it matter who wins? At the Cambridge Festival of Ideas last weekend I heard a panel of experts on Asia \u2013 one Korean, one Japanese and one Chinese \u2013 saying there is less interest than usual in the contest on their side of the Pacific. The US focus is tilting towards China (60% of US warships are now in the Pacific, we were told) but the anti-China rhetoric \u2013 formerly anti-Japanese \u2013 over unfair trade is much quieter in 2012.</p> <p>Whoever wins won't change US policy much (whatever aggressive pledges Romney is making) seemed to be east Asia's verdict. Well, maybe.</p> <p>I'd still say it matters quite a lot. Romney may plan to govern from the centre if he becomes president and Republican forces in Congress and the country allow him to \u2013 as they denied much scope to Obama. But it is certainly not what he's been saying.</p> <p>On climate change, denial is dominant. Republicans still want to deport millions of illegal immigrants, they would cut spending on benefits for those layabout Democrats \u2013 healthcare and stuff \u2013 while increasing defence spending AND cutting taxes for everyone. A constitutional curb on gays rights, the outlawing of abortion etc etc.</p> <p>A pre-emptive attack on Iran's nuclear plants, support for more West Bank settlements, the list is a long one \u2013 and scary. What we know from the record, two Bushes and Ronald Reagan, is that Republicans are better at cutting taxes, mostly for the rich, than cutting spending the way they promise to cut it. That's why the US has a crippling debt problem, a more serious budget imbalance than our own, possible only because of the residual prestige (for now) of the dollar.</p> <p>Add all that to the superior organisational power of the Democratic machine \u2013 the Obama team's better grasp of social media as campaign tools that offset the billionaire bank-rolling of Romney \u2013 together with the changing demographics of the US, and it points me to the same conclusion.</p> <p>Obama's crowds are much smaller than in 2008, but they're multiracial. That's America's future, black, white, Hispanic, Asian. Indeed the insurgency of the Tea Party, which was forced to settle for Romney (Paul Ryan, a consolation prize who could prove an error), may be the last hurrah of the old all-white hegemony.</p> <p>If they can't beat a disappointing incumbent, they may have to come to terms with the new realities at home and abroad. Modernisation of the Republican party is long overdue. Obama to scrape home after all.</p>",
  "<p>There has never been a greater interest in African film. The Nigerian video film industry, Nollywood \u2013 now <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/filmblog/2010/sep/21/nollywood-nigerian-film-industry\" title=\"\">the second largest</a> in the world after Bollywood in terms of number of films produced \u2013 has revolutionised film production and distribution on the continent.</p> <p>Celebrating the best of these productions, the UK's largest annual festival of African cinema, <a href=\"http://www.filmafrica.org.uk\" title=\"\">Film Africa 2012</a>, opened in London on Thursday night, offering 10 days of 70 African films, film-maker Q&amp;As, professional workshops, and nine nights of African music.</p> <p>With the African-born residents of London including 105,000 Nigerians, 80,000 South Africans, 53,000 Zimbabweans, 44,000 Somalis, 39,000 Ghanaians, 25,000 Libyans, 18,000 Mauritians, 15,000 Kenyans, and 12,000 Eritreans, it is the perfect place to host the festival.</p> <p>Film Africa 2012 confronts issues that are not entirely specific to Africa, but that are explored from a uniquely African perspective. Africa is not a single, monolithic entity, however, and nor are its films. Alongside the distinctive energy of Nollywood there are also the unique flavours of African films from country to country.</p> <p>To demonstrate this, Film Africa gives special attention to certain African countries; this year it is South Africa, with 17 South African films scheduled. The programme comprises fiction, documentaries, and shorts, covering all aspects of the country: from victimisation and its inspirational overcoming; surfing and coming of age, the psychological fallout of apartheid, music and creativity, the contemporary struggles of gay people, the recent xenophobic riots, football and journeys of discovery, and the power of social movements to hold the government to account.</p> <p>This year, co-directors Lindiwe Dovey and Namvula Rennie are particularly eager to highlight the increasingly transnational nature of African film, both in its narrative content and its production values. In one of the major programming strands \u2013 continental crossings \u2013 the films have been chosen to inspire a vision of a global Africa connected to the western and the non-western world.</p> <p>Like the London film festival, Film Africa 2012 is divided into separate thematic focuses: in addition to continental crossings there is elections and democracy, Mama Africa, spotlight on sexualities, sport, and public space and citizen journalism.</p> <p>The opening night film, Nairobi Half Life, is an unlikely collaboration between leading German director Tom Tykwer (Run Lola Run, The International) and rising Kenyan film talent David Tosh Gitonga. Other notable UK premieres include: The Education of Auma Obama, a portrait of the Kenyan half-sister of US president Barack Obama who introduced him to his Kenyan roots; the multi-award winning <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2012/nov/01/call-me-kuchu-review\" title=\"\">Call Me Kuchu</a>, a devastating tribute to the Ugandan gay activist David Kato; and Sons of the Clouds, which explores the refugee camps after the colonisation of western Sahara, starring Javier Bardem.</p> <p>The festival will close with a screening of Mama Africa, a documentary about Miriam Makeba \u2013 one of the most outspoken opponents of apartheid who was also affectionately known as the empress of African song \u2013 directed with the transnational and global consciousness of Mika Kaurism\u00e4ki.</p> <p><em>Film Africa is hosted by the Hackney Picturehouse, with screenings also at the BFI Southbank, Rich Mix in Shoreditch, The Ritzy in Brixton, Screen on the Green in Islington, and The South London Gallery. It is supported by the Royal African Society and London's School of Oriental and African Studies (Soas). Film Africa 2012 runs from November 1 \u2013 11.</em></p>",
  "<p>Swing dance has well and truly swung back into fashion.

She has emerged in a nascent hip-hop scene in Afghanistan, where so far only a handful of (male) rappers have begun to garner a following. Hip-hop is often a potent voice of the marginalised, and a form that offers the chance for forceful voices to lend a public narrative to suffering. Firooz's gender makes waves in itself, drawing attention from international press as the first woman to be seen in the hip-hop scene in her country and butting heads with the fundamentalist and traditionalist elements within her own country.</p> <p>The act of making music is a radical one in itself. Afghanistan and its people have spent decades with their politics dominated by militancy and by foreign invasion, and censorship of music, along with other forms of expression, has been an intrinsic part of that long experience. The gradual evolution of music censorship can be traced back to the beginning of communist rule under <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nur_Muhammad_Taraki\" title=\"\">Nur Muhammad Taraki</a> in 1978. According to <a href=\"http://www.rawa.org/music.htm\" title=\"\">a 2001 article by John Baily</a>, the Taliban's suppression of music is rooted in the beginning of the censorship of this period, when refugee camps in Iran and Pakistan enforced a total ban on music in order to preserve a constant state of mourning.</p> <p>Firooz herself is no stranger to camps like these. The 23 year old <a href=\"http://metronews.ca/news/world/397292/first-female-rapper-debuts-in-afghanistan/#\" title=\"\">grew up in one in Iran in the 1990s</a> and spent time as a refugee with her family in Pakistan as well. They returned to their native country seven years ago. It is this life story that drives her narrative and purpose in the one song she has released, a Dari-language single composed and arranged by Afghan singer <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farid_Rastagar\" title=\"\">Farid Rastagar</a> with the lyrics written by poet Suhrab Sirat.</p> <p>This is one of the important dimensions of hip-hop and of political music generally: the element of storytelling, of relaying detailed chronicles that need to be heard. Music can make itself a platform for human stories otherwise lost, and with her single, Firooz has made use of hip-hop in just that way. It's a highly personal narrative for her, and one to which she brings authenticity and poignancy, calling for her audience to listen: \"<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Gwi7SNiTx0&amp;feature=related\" title=\"\">Hear my stories and hear/Hear my sorrows, my sadness/Hear the story of my displacement and homelessness/We were lost, we were lost, lost around the world</a>.\" Her lyrics continue with the narration of life as a refugee, dreaming of their homeland and being treated as worthless abroad, ending with a call for hope and an end to abuses, to the invading and interfering forces of the west and of Pakistan and Iran. \"From now on,\" she concludes, \"it will be Afghanistan.\"</p> <p>At the moment, Firooz has put out only this one song: titled \"Our Neighbors\" and performed in Dari. The effort put into the production may not be immediately evident, but Firooz, who lives without a great deal of financial luxury with her family in north Kabul, worked on the song's production on an old and finicky desktop computer and a donated keyboard. She also works as an actress in local soap operas. Her father left his electrical department job to accompany her as a bodyguard, fearful of the death threats she has faced.</p> <p>With this song, Firooz doesn't just join the ranks of Afghanistan's newly minted hip-hop scene, but the ranks of many Afghan women working to shine the light on poverty, women's rights, refugees' rights and the effects of war (joined by her mother, who does humanitarian work in southern Afghanistan). She has garnered international attention because of the bravery and talent she invests in what she does, but also by dint of the western fascination with the idea of an Afghan woman who does not cover her hair, making her way as a hip-hop artist and television soap actress.

  "<p>The British Antarctic Survey (BAS) has been saved from being dismantled after a climbdown from the universities and science minister, David Willetts, and the Natural Environment Research Council (NERC).</p> <p>The proposed merger with the National Oceanography Centre in Southampton would have irreparably damaged one of world's leading centres for polar research, according to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/oct/31/merge-british-antarctic-survey\" title=\"\">many critics</a>.</p> <p>\"BAS is a national and international asset that delivers world-class environmental science, and this country's strategic presence in Antarctica and the South Atlantic,\" Willetts said in a <a href=\"http://www.nerc.ac.uk/about/work/boards/council/bas-noc-outcome.asp\" title=\"\">statement to parliament on Friday</a>. \"NERC agreed that it will not proceed with the proposal for merger.\"</p> <p>\"I am delighted that the right decision has been made,\" said John Dudeney, BAS deputy director until 2006. \"But the devil is in the detail. What you don't want is want is to leave a husk of BAS that only provides logistics.\" He said ensuring science remained an integrated part of work at BAS \u2013 whose scientists discovered the ozone hole \u2013 was vital.</p> <p>\"BAS is outstanding and has always been so,\" he said, noting it was about to embark on a landmark experiment to drill into a lake hidden deep under the Antarctic ice, a feat he compared to landing spacecraft on Mars.</p> <p>The announcement was also greeted as \"fantastic news\" by Conservative MP Zac Goldsmith and Liberal Democrat MP for Cambridge Julian Huppert.</p> <p>Vicky Wyatt, Greenpeace arctic campaigner, said: \"The decision acknowledges the critical role that British science does and can play in protecting the polar regions. Right now, with the Arctic summer sea ice melting at a record rate, and growing uncertainty over the effect of climate change on the Antarctic, we need Britain's scientists more than ever.\"</p> <p>The decision ends a period of turmoil at BAS, which has been without a permanent director since February. The interim director appointed was also the director of the National Oceanography Centre with which BAS was to have been merged to save costs. Dudeney said: \"NERC needs to consider how they got into such a mess.\"</p> <p>The proposed merger met with opposition from politicians, scientists and environmentalists in the UK and abroad. Former US vice-president Al Gore defended BAS as a \"globally significant institution\", while Prof Jonathan Shanklin, one of the scientists who discovered the ozone hole in 1985, said: \"BAS is almost synonymous with the Antarctic ozone hole. Losing it would create a comparable hole in British science.\"</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/commons-select/science-and-technology-committee/news/1201031-nerc-report/\" title=\"\">House of Commons science and technology committee also condemned the merger</a> in a report published on Wednesday, the day before NERC decided to abandon the plan. \"We concluded that NERC have not made a proper case for it nor demonstrated political nous on the strong non science-related issues surrounding BAS,\" said committee chair Andrew Miller.</p> <p>Four of the UK's biggest green NGOs \u2013 Greenpeace, the RSPB, WWF-UK and Friends of the Earth \u2013 had also signalled their strong opposition to the merger.</p> <p>The plan attracted further controversy after the Guardian revealed the merger would require BAS to use its skills to help <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/oct/14/environmental-science-agencies-oil-polar\" title=\"\">\"de-risk\" investment for UK oil companies exploring the polar regions</a>.</p> <p>Environmentalist Tony Juniper, who was a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/sep/29/axing-british-antarctic-survey-juniper\" title=\"\">prominent critic of the merger plan</a>, said: \"It is a good day for polar science and very encouraging that argument has won out over dogma.\" He said NERC must appoint a new director for BAS as a matter of urgency in order to confirm that the institution was safe in its current form.</p>",
  "<p>I first met <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/oct/27/hans-werner-henze\" title=\"Hans Werner Henze obituary\">Hans Werner Henze</a> in 1970, when he directed his opera Elegy for Young Lovers at the Edinburgh festival. The conductor was Alexander Gibson, who had already programmed a number of Henze's works with the then Scottish National Orchestra.</p> <p>Moving from the management of that orchestra to the BBC in 1972, I was grateful to Henze for inaugurating, with two programmes, the studio series The Composer Conducts \u2013 and he was certainly one of those who could. Between 1975 and 1986, I scheduled several of his works at the Proms. Problematic, however, was The Raft of the Medusa, whose aborted premiere in Hamburg in 1968 had become notorious.</p> <p>I had heard a tape of the final rehearsal and was bothered by the Ho Chi Minh chants that end the piece, so I wrote to ask if he had considered an alternative ending. His reply was characteristic: \"For me, this finale represents a violent switch from past to present. I'm aware of the fact that it is crude and rude and I almost hate it. Yet it does something, at least for me...\" In the event, David Atherton's moving performance at the 1978 Proms went off without incident, the finale no longer subversively topical.</p> <p>Henze could not really understand the ridicule he encountered in Germany for voicing strongly leftwing views from a position of considerable personal comfort. But his move to Italy in 1953 \u2013 described in an unforgettably evocative radio broadcast that demonstrated not only his mastery of English but also his beguiling charm \u2013 was some sort of a liberation.</p> <p>Italian warmth of climate and character released both the sensuality inherent in his music and the manifest sensuality of his own character. At their most heartfelt, as that with the admirable Michael Vyner, his gay relationships could be creative: the works Henze wrote for Michael's London Sinfonietta now seem to be among his best.</p> <p>The move to Italy brought another bonus \u2013 friendship with another asylum-seeker, William Walton, who often welcomed him to Ischia and was genuinely interested in his development, if also envious of his gifts as self-promoter: \"Hans really does know how to manage things,\" Walton wrote in 1976. \"At his Montepulciano festival he managed to get it televised by the Italians, the Germans and BBC TV.\" And, sure enough, a letter from Henze soliciting BBC collaboration soon landed on my desk.</p> <p>In another letter, written not long after Henze had suffered a heart attack, Walton accidentally touched on the question which is surely central to any assessment of Henze's music: \"Hans is not too well \u2026 I tried to persuade him that it was quite unnecessary for him to write more music \u2013 he has done already enough for two lifetimes.\" And indeed Henze's facility was prodigious \u2013 as was his industry and the range of his achievement.</p> <p>He belonged to no school, but he tentatively explored systems, including serialism, which were fundamentally alien to him. Aspiring to an idiom both radical and communicative, he evolved, initially, a postromantic lyricism of his own.</p> <p>Later \u2013 particularly in the smaller-scale political works \u2013 he found a harder edge, though not the \"<em>con malizia</em>\" of Walton, whose orchestration he much admired. Still later, the big symphonies once again demonstrated an absolute technical mastery, but a tendency towards soft-centred prolixity which seemed to me to weaken them, however alluring their externals. Without doubt Henze was brilliantly gifted, but also bewilderingly so.</p>",
  "<p>Welcome to week nine on the NFL Talkboard. Most of you know the drill with this blog by now but for those who don't, the Pick Six competition works as follows: every week I will select six games \u2013 usually the ones I think will be toughest to call \u2013 and post my predictions. You are invited to submit your own picks below the line. We will keep track of everyone's scores over the course of the season, in order to determine an overall winner.</p> <p>Just two people got all six picks right last week. Deferential courtseys, please in the direction of our new kings: <strong>themagicman </strong>and <strong>vassago1234</strong>.</p> <p>This week's live blog is will be <strong>Miami Dolphins @ Indianapolis Colts</strong>. Kick-off is at 1pm ET/6pm GMT on Sunday, so be sure to join us for that. And join us on Monday for <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/blog/2012/oct/30/patriots-london-vick-ballard\">Five Things We Learned</a>. Now, without further ado, here are this week's games:</p> <h2>Denver Broncos @ Cincinnati Bengals (Sunday 1pm ET/6pm GMT)</h2> <p>Two teams moving in opposite directions, the Broncos having won back-to-back games for the first time this season, the Bengals coming off a three-game losing streak. But Cincinnati, who started the season 3-1, are fresh from a bye week and will be playing on their own field. Denver's Peyton Manning is dealing with a sore thumb, though he says that's a non-issue. The Bengals will certainly expect to make his life a lot more difficult than the Saints did last weekend \u2013 their 23 sacks ranking joint-third in the league. The only two teams ahead of them have each played a game more. But I'm more worried about Cincy's own quarterback, Andy Dalton, and the fact he has thrown six picks in his last three starts \u2013 as well as at least one in every game so far.<br> <strong>Broncos to win</strong></p> <h2>Miami Dolphins @ Indianapolis Colts (Sunday 1pm ET/6pm GMT)<br>Guardian live game!</h2> <p>Who honestly thought these two teams would both be 4-3 at this stage of the season? If the playoffs started today they would both be wild-card teams. With a victory on Sunday one of the two might take a significant step towards making the postseason for real. The Colts, incredibly, are 3-1 since their head coach, Chuck Pagano, found out he had leukemia and offensive co-ordinator Bruce Arians stepped into the role. The Dolphins have won three straight and last week crushed the Jets 30-9 in New York. This is supposed to be a duel between rookie quarterbacks Andrew Luck and Ryan Tannehill, though the latter's status is now uncertain, due to a knee injury. Either way, I'm taking the Colts to edge it at home.</p> <p><strong>Colts to win</strong></p> <h2>Chicago Bears @ Tennessee Titans (Sunday 1pm ET/6pm GMT)</h2> <p>Is Chris Johnson back? As noted in <a href=\"http://www.nfl.com/gamecenter/2012110403/2012/REG9/bears@titans#menu=gameinfo&amp;tab=preview\">NFL.com's preview</a>, the Titans running back has averaged 5.6 yards per carry over his past five games, but this will be a different sort of test against what is statistically the best rushing defense in the league. The Bears were poor last week, barely scraping by a mediocre Carolina team. But that could also serve as the jolt they needed.</p> <p><strong>Bears to win</strong></p> <h2>Tampa Bay Buccaneers @ Oakland Raiders (Sunday 4.05pm ET/9.05pm GMT)</h2> <p>Just as many of the world's animals prepare to go into hibernation, Josh Freeman has awoken from his year-long slumber. He became the first Buccaneers quarterback to throw for at least three touchdowns in three consecutive games as he torched the Chiefs', Vikings' and Saints' secondaries \u2013 his team averaging 34 points in those games (though they still lost to New Orleans). There is every reason to believe he can continue such form against an Oakland secondary who rank 20th in the league, though this is a long cross-country trip to face a Raiders team who are themselves coming off consecutive wins.</p> <p><strong>Buccaneers to win</strong></p> <h2>Pittsburgh Steelers @ New York Giants (Sunday 4.25pm ET/9.25pm GMT)</h2> <p>How would you not be excited about this match-up? Two of the most successful franchises in NFL history, featuring two quarterbacks \u2013 drafted together in 2004 \u2013 who each have a pair of Super Bowl rings. The nature of inter-conference scheduling means that these two teams cannot meet again, unless in a Super Bowl, for another four years. Eli Manning is up against a Steelers pass defense that ranks first in the league. Ben Roethlisberger must contend with Jason Pierre-Paul, Justin Tuck, Osi Umenyiora and the rest. I like the Giants, but if you're into omens then here's a little food for thought: the Giants have only won their ninth game of an NFL season once in eight attempts under Tom Coughlin.</p> <p><strong>Giants to win</strong></p> <h2>Philadelphia Eagles @ New Orleans Saints (Monday 8.30pm ET/Tuesday 1.30am GMT)</h2> <p>Michael Vick remains the starting quarterback in Philadelphia for now, but must justify Andy Reid's faith this weekend. If he cannot put up gaudy numbers against a Saints pass defense ranked 27th in the league then it might be time to pull the plug. New Orleans struggled to get things going on offense in Denver last week, but it will be a different story in the Superdome. Drew Brees has lost a few shootouts this year, but he'll take this one.</p> <p><strong>Saints to win</strong></p> <h2>And the rest</h2> <p>Here are the rest of this week's games. These are not included in the Pick Six, but feel free to post your picks for these as well. If you do so then<strong> please keep them separate from your Pick Six predictions</strong>, as it will make life a lot easier when tallying up your scores.</p> <p><strong>Sunday</strong></p> <p>1pm ET/6pm GMT<br>Baltimore Ravens @ Cleveland Browns<br>Arizona Cardinals @ Green Bay Packers<br>Carolina Panthers @ Washington Redskins<br>Detroit Lions @ Jacksonville Jaguars<br>Buffalo Bills @ Houston Texans<br>4.05pm ET/9.05pm GMT<br>Minnesota Vikings @ Seattle Seahawks<br>8.20pm ET/Monday 1.20am GMT<br>Dallas Cowboys @ Atlanta Falcons</p>",
  "<p>The impact of the superstorm Sandy was felt directly on the presidential election on Thursday when the popular mayor of New York, Michael Bloomberg, threw his support behind Barack Obama, citing Republican challenger Mitt Romney's failure to back climate change measures.</p> <p>Bloomberg combined his endorsement of Obama with a devastating attack on Romney for reversing his positions not only on climate change but on immigration, guns, abortion rights and healthcare.</p> <p>His endorsement came as Obama received plaudits for his handling of the storm that has devastated New Jersey and New York and also hit Connecticut and West Virginia.</p> <p>The mayor, writing about the damage caused to New York by Sandy, praised Obama for having made some progress towards tackling climate change. He noted that Romney, too, had supported climate change moves in the past but has since backed away from them.</p> <p>In a powerful passage that can only hurt Romney, Bloomberg went on to write: \"I believe Mitt Romney is a good and decent man, and he would bring valuable business experience to the Oval Office. He understands that America was built on the promise of equal opportunity, not equal results.</p> <p>\"In the past he has also taken sensible positions on immigration, illegal guns, abortion rights and healthcare. But he has reversed course on all of them, and is even running against the healthcare model he signed into law in Massachusetts.\"</p> <p>Obama said he was honoured to have Bloomberg's endorsement. \"I deeply respect him for his leadership in business, philanthropy and government, and [I] appreciate the extraordinary job he's doing right now, leading New York City through these difficult days,\" the president said.</p> <p>\"Mayor Bloomberg and I agree on the most important issues of our time \u2013 that the key to a strong economy is investing in the skills and education of our people, that immigration reform is essential to an open and dynamic democracy, and that climate change is a threat to our children's future.</p> <p>\"Just as importantly, we agree that whether we are Democrats, Republicans, or independents, there is only one way to solve these challenges and move forward as a nation \u2013 together.\"</p> <p>Bloomberg's support comes after New Jersey governor Chris Christie praised Obama for his handling of Sandy. Although Christie is a Republican and a prominent supporter of Romney, he went out of his way this week to repeatedly praise Obama's leadership in responding to the crisis.</p> <p>Bloomberg is an independent who had originally been a Democrat before switching to the Republicans in 2001. He won the mayorship as a Republican but fell out with the party in 2007.</p> <p>He considered running as an independent in the 2008 White House election and commissioned polls in all 50 states, dropping the idea after finding insufficient support.</p> <p>In his op-ed, Bloomberg brings climate change, largely ignored by Obama and Romney during the campaign, back to the fore.</p> <p>\"The devastation that Hurricane Sandy brought to New York City and much of the north-east \u2013 in lost lives, lost homes and lost business \u2013 brought the stakes of Tuesday's presidential election into sharp relief,\" he wrote.</p> <p>He added: \"Our climate is changing. And while the increase in extreme weather we have experienced in New York City and around the world may or may not be the result of it, the risk that it might be \u2013 given this week's devastation \u2013 should compel all elected leaders to take immediate action.\"</p> <p>Obama had taken major steps to reduce carbon consumption and Romney too had a history of tackling climate change but had reversed course.</p> <p>He said he was disappointed with Obama on many issues, listing among them healthcare reform.</p> <p>\"When I step into the voting booth, I think about the world I want to leave my two daughters, and the values that are required to guide us there. The two parties' nominees for president offer different visions of where they want to lead America,\" he writes.</p> <p>\"One believes a woman's right to choose should be protected for future generations; one does not. That difference, given the likelihood of supreme court vacancies, weighs heavily on my decision.</p> <p>\"One recognises marriage equality as consistent with America's march of freedom; one does not. I want our president to be on the right side of history.\"</p> <p>He concluded: \"Presidents Bill Clinton and Ronald Reagan both found success while their parties were out of power in Congress \u2013 and President Obama can, too. If he listens to people on both sides of the aisle, and builds the trust of moderates, he can fulfil the hope he inspired four years ago and lead our country toward a better future for my children and yours. And that's why I will be voting for him.\"</p> <p>The Economist, which has a wide readership in the US, said in an editorial it had backed Obama four years ago and was doing so again. It regretted that Romney was too far removed from the centre.</p> <p>\"This newspaper yearns for the more tolerant conservatism of Ronald Reagan, where 'small government' meant keeping the state out of people's bedrooms as well as out of their businesses. Mr Romney shows no sign of wanting to revive it,\" it says.</p> <p>It concludes: \"For all his businesslike intentions, Mr Romney has an economic plan that works only if you don't believe most of what he says. That is not a convincing pitch for a chief executive. And for all his shortcomings, Mr Obama has dragged America's economy back from the brink of disaster, and has made a decent fist of foreign policy. So this newspaper would stick with the devil it knows, and re-elect him.\"</p> <p>Fellow Republicans downplayed the significance of Bloomberg's endorsement. \"It's not surprising to me. Bloomberg is a very liberal political figure,\" said George Pataki, the former Republican governor of New York.</p> <p>Pataki also argued Romney would be \"far better\" than Obama in dealing with climate change.</p> <p>Pataki during his time as governor was one of the creators of a regional carbon trading system \u2013 which is in partial collapse since Christie pulled out last year. </p> <p>He said of Romney's position: \"I think he is far better than Obama, who embraced the Markey-Waxman bill. That is the fear when you allow people like Pelosi and Reid and Obama to draft national legislation that is not so much aimed at climate change but at expanding government power and government revenue. I think Romney would be far better.\"</p>",
  "<p>The UK must brace itself for a high likelihood of winter floods, the Met Office and the government's flooding watchdog have warned.</p> <p>Saturated ground around the country, and high river and groundwater levels from the wet summer, will mean that much less rainfall than usual is needed to top up water levels and cause severe flooding, according to the Environment Agency.</p> <p>There is now a significantly higher risk of flooding this autumn and winter, even with small amounts of rain, so households have been advised to check warnings for their area. One in six homes is at some risk of flooding.</p> <p>Sarah Jackson, of the Met Office, said: \"We are heading into the winter period which is traditionally the wetter period of the year in the UK. Because the ground is so wet, if we do have any prolonged heavy rainfall in any part of the country, there is going to be heightened risk of flooding.\"</p> <p>Any severe flooding this winter will also raise questions over the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/jul/14/flood-defence-schemes-unbuilt\" title=\"\">government's cuts to some proposed new flood defences</a>, some of which are now being abandoned or scaled back. Insurers have warned that they may end their long-standing agreement to provide all UK homes with flood cover. If they do so, some people will find themselves in uninsurable homes.</p> <p>Experts singled out Devon, Dorset and Hampshire in the south as being particularly at risk, because of high groundwater levels, while in the north of England and Wales the risk has been heightened from recent heavy rainfall. In the south-west, the main threat will be from rivers, especially this month and next.</p> <p>Coastal areas are braced for high spring tides occurring in the middle of this month and from 12 to 18 December.</p> <p>Paul Mustow, head of flood incident management at the Environment Agency, urged people to take action against \"the UK's number one natural hazard\". He advised: \"The most important step people can take in protecting themselves from the worst impacts is to find out if they are at risk, and sign up to our free flood warnings service.\" More than a million people are currently signed up.</p> <p>One question that the Met Office researchers are now working on is whether the unusually grim weather this year was the result of global warming. For six years in a row, the UK has suffered unusually wet summers with less sunlight than normal. This has been largely owing to the positioning of the \"jet stream\", a northern latitudes weather system that usually brings periods of settled weather to UK summers but for several years has been changing position, resulting in the opposite.</p> <p>Some experts think the positioning of the weather system has been affected by the melting Arctic. This year, the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/sep/14/arctic-sea-ice-smallest-extent\" title=\"\">Arctic ice reached the lowest extent ever recorded</a>, and there was more widespread melting of the Greenland ice sheet than seen before.</p> <p>The Environment Agency said households and businesses should check their flood risk and sign up to receive free flood warnings at <a href=\"http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/flood\" title=\"\">www.environment-agency.gov.uk/flood</a>.</p>"
