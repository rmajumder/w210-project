  "<h2><a href=\"http://encounters-festival.org.uk\" title=\"\">Encounters Short Film And Animation Festival</a>, Bristol</h2> <p>The short-film and animation communities descend on Bristol for this annual gathering, which offers networking for pros and viewing pleasures galore for punters. Most screenings are organised into bite-sized programmes, where you'll find new talent alongside familiar names like Harmony Korine (with his bizarre South African jaunt Umshini Wam), Gina McKee, plus \u2013 in animation \u2013 the cast of Aardman's Pirates feature in a gameshow.</p> <p><em>Various venues, Tue to 23 Sep</em></p> <h2><a href=\"http://berwickfilm-artsfest.com\" title=\"\">Film &amp; Media Arts Festival</a>, Berwick-upon-Tweed</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396086993\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/13/1347532894563/Here-008.jpg\" alt=\"Here\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Here</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Cinema and photography mix in unpredictable ways at this imaginative festival, which finds room for both a pastoral Swedish documentary called Women With Cows and Milla Jovovich kicking-corporate zombie ass in Resident Evil: Retribution. There are countless crossover movies, from road romance Here (between a cartographer and a snapper) to Chasing Ice, in which a photographer tracks melting polar ice, to art films by Shirin Neshat, Wim Wenders and Chris Marker. The festival's other component makes use of the border town's architectural heritage with a series of free photography installations \u2013 a time-lapse of refugees fleeing Gaddafi's Libya projected onto the Town Hall Prison Cells, for example, or techno-backed animated school photos at the Bankhill Ice House.</p> <p><em>Various venues, Wed to 23 Sep</em></p> <h2><a href=\"http://takeoneaction.org.uk\" title=\"\">Take One Action Film Festival</a>, Edinburgh &amp; Glasgow</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396086994\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/13/1347533032799/War-Witch-008.jpg\" alt=\"War Witch\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">War Witch</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The first step to saving the world is knowing where to start, and this festival (split between Edinburgh and Glasgow), connecting the local with the global, gives you a few pointers. For the bigger picture, there's Scorsese-produced documentary Surviving Progress, in which experts question the course of humanity, but there are more-focused movies, factual and fictional, serious and lighthearted. Filipino movie The Woman In The Septic Tank satirises poverty-exploitation film-making, while War Witch shows the plight of a pregnant Congolese child soldier. Other subjects this year include Arab politics, western economics, sex trafficking, WikiLeaks and wind farms, but it's not just the topics, it's the way they're presented, and what we do about them that matters.</p> <p><em>Various venues, Fri to 6 Oct</em></p> <h2><a href=\"http://brazilianfilmfestival.com/londres/2012/londres2012_en.html\" title=\"\">Brazilian Film Festival</a>, London</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396086995\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/13/1347533115381/Xingu-008.jpg\" alt=\"Xingu\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Xingu</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Brazil's big names have gone global \u2013 as shown by Fernando Meirelles's recent 360 and Walter Salles's forthcoming On The Road \u2013 but there's plenty of stories left to tell at home.

At the other end of the spectrum there's up-to-date favela comedy Totally Innocent, which satirises Meirelles's City Of God. As always, Brazil's musical wealth is strongly represented, with docs on samba at the Rio carnival and the sentimental <em>brega</em> tradition.</p> <p><em>Odeon Panton Street, SW1, Fri to 25 Sep</em></p>",
  "<p>This was supposed to be the year we would see a revolution in the way we spend our money. The idea was that we stop using notes and coins for items such as coffees and newspapers, and simply wave our plastic cards over a reader at the till. But although millions of people have been issued with debit and credit cards displaying the contactless \"wave\" symbol, early evidence suggests shoppers aren't giving up on cash just yet \u2013 and many retailers themselves still need convincing.</p> <p>In a mystery shopping exercise carried out this week, Guardian Money found that Boots, Marks &amp; Spencer and Tesco have embraced the new form of payment. But other chains such as Starbucks, Costa Coffee and the Body Shop rejected our attempts to make a contactless payment \u2013 and some shop assistants barely knew what they were.</p> <p>Contactless is for payments of \u00a320 or less, and means you don't have to key in your pin. The advantages for consumers are that they are in and out of a shop quicker, with fewer queues and no fiddling around with change; retailers (are meant to) like it because they don't have to handle large amounts of coins, and they also hope you will spend more money.</p> <p>But many shoppers worry about what will happen if their card is stolen and the thief runs up a big bill. That said, others like the idea of being able to pay without worrying about someone else behind them seeing them tap in their pin.</p> <p>In the banking industry a war of words has broken out over whether the public have taken to contactless payments. ATM operator Bank Machine <a href=\"http://www.bankmachine.com/newsroom/news\" title=\"\">recently published a survey</a> that said 51% of Britons have no idea whether or not any of their bank cards are enabled for contactless transactions, and also highlighted concerns about fraud. A few days later, <a href=\"http://www.thisismoney.co.uk/money/saving/article-2192470/Contactless-transactions-hit-million-month-milestone.html\" title=\"\">Barclaycard issued research</a> showing that 84% of the public now recognise the contactless symbol, with six in 10 people saying they prefer cards to cash for purchases up to \u00a320.</p> <p>It also emerged that across Barclaycard and Barclays, which between them have issued more than 19m new-style credit and debit cards, the number of contactless payments is now running at more than 1m a month. But some might say that is a drop in the ocean: according to the UK Cards Association, each month in Britain there are more than 800m debit and credit card transactions. The association says on its <a href=\"http://www.contactless.info/\" title=\"\">contactless.info</a> website: \"The number of contactless transactions is relatively low as we are still in the early stages of roll-out.\"</p> <p>And while London&#xa0;2012 was highlighted as a \"cashless Olympics\", with retailers at the sites able to accept contactless payments, Visa said last month (before the Paralympics began) that only 150,000 payments at Games venues were made using the technology. This represented 15% of all card payments of \u00a320 and under.</p> <p>On the other hand, many big-name retailers and banks are embracing the technology, at least to some degree. Last month <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2012/aug/09/ms-contactless-payments\" title=\"\">Marks &amp; Spencer became the latest retailer to introduce the payments</a> - initially in its 25 busiest London stores and a number of Simply Food outlets. But it is the supermarket chains that are needed to bring the phenomenon into the mainstream.</p> <p>Tesco is trialling contactless payments in only about 30 of its stores, Asda is testing it in 25 London outlets, and Waitrose has the payments system available in 10 stores, with plans to introduce it to the rest of its branches by spring 2013. The Co-op began a trial in stores within the M25 and Manchester city centre in May.</p> <p>Meanwhile, by the end of 2012 London buses will accept contactless payments, followed by the tube and the rest of the capital's transport network sometime in 2013.</p> <p>Some would say things have not been helped by the varying approaches taken by the banks. While Barclays/Barclaycard has been the undisputed leader in this field, HSBC started to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2012/may/09/hsbc-joins-contactless-payments-movement\" title=\"\">introduce the technology in May this year</a>, but doesn't expect its roll-out to be completed until mid-2015. And if you are a customer of Nationwide you may have a long wait, as it has no plans to issue contactless cards.</p> <p>Amid anecdotal evidence that relatively few people who have one of the new-style cards has used them to make a contactless payment, Guardian Money took its card, plus a shopping list for office colleagues, on a tour of the retail outlets in and around London's King's Cross and St Pancras stations. These shops are geared to serving travellers on the move, and local workers keen on quick lunch-hour shopping. In each store we took a low-cost item to the counter and handed over the card to the sales assistant. The results, as can be seen below, are a&#xa0;mixed bag.</p> <h2><strong>Pret A Manger, bag of nuts, 99p: YES</strong></h2> <p>The assistant offered me a choice between a touchscreen contactless terminal or a chip-and-pin terminal. One quick touch of my card on the former and I was done. The assistant said about one in 10 customers paying with a card were opting for contactless. \"It's quick and easy for me and works well,\" he said.</p> <h2><strong>Tesco Metro, fruit salad, \u00a32: YES</strong></h2> <p>The screen on the card terminal at the checkout gave me the option to make a contactless payment \u2013 again, simple and fast.</p> <h2><strong>Costcut Express, chocolate bar, 65p: NO</strong></h2> <p>The assistant said: \"You have to pay a&#xa0;50p fee if you want to pay for it by card instead of cash.\"</p> <p>\"Don't you do contactless payments?\" I asked. \"No, we don't,\" came back the reply.</p> <h2><strong>Starbucks, carrot cake, \u00a32.10: NO</strong></h2> <p>The assistant tried to show me how to put my card into the chip-and-pin terminal. When I asked if I could make a contactless payment, she said: \"Sorry, we don't do that.\"</p> <h2><strong>McDonald's, Big Mac, \u00a32.69: YES</strong></h2> <p>The assistant pointed out the&#xa0;card terminal. \"Do you do contactless payment?\" I asked.</p> <p>\"Yes, there,\" she said, pointing at the screen which showed the contactless symbol. I touched my card to it \u2013 done.</p> <h2><strong>WH Smith, crisps, 99p: YES</strong></h2> <p>The assistant told me to put my card in the terminal. \"Don't you do contactless?\" I asked.</p> <p>\"Oh yes,\" she said, before fiddling with something behind the counter to make the terminal accept a contactless payment.</p> <p>\"Quite a few people use this payment method, but it is not automatic on the machine,\" she said. The same applied when I wanted a receipt. She said they were only automatic if you paid by chip-and-pin, but she was able to prompt the machine to produce one at my request.</p> <h2><strong>Accessorize, umbrella, \u00a310: NO</strong></h2> <p>When prompted to put my card into the chip-and-pin machine, I asked: \"Don't you do contactless payments?\"</p> <p>\"What?\" said the assistant.</p> <p>Once I explained what I meant, she said: \"What, no pin or anything? Yes, I think I've seen that advertised. It sounds good but I'm afraid we don't do it. Sorry.\"</p> <h2><strong>M&amp;S Simply Food, salad, \u00a32.75: YES</strong></h2> <p>There was a big sign next to the terminal saying: \"Why not pay contactless today?\" So I did.</p> <h2><strong>Costa Coffee, mini chocolate cookies, 99p: NO</strong></h2> <p>When I asked if I could make a contactless payment, I was told: \"No, sorry, we haven't got it yet \u2013 maybe next year. I know other retailers are doing it. \"When I asked if many people requested it, I was told: \"Not really. You are only the second person who has asked me for it, and I've been here for a year.\"</p> <h2><strong>Boots, face wash, \u00a32.99: YES</strong></h2> <p>There were signs at the till telling shoppers they could make contactless payments for items up to \u00a320, and the sales assistant started explaining it and automatically did it for me the minute I gave him my card. He said since getting the terminals installed the assistants have told everyone with a contactless card about it.</p> <p>But when I tried a different, larger Boots to buy an item I had forgotten there were no signs and the assistant started to put my card into the chip-and-pin machine before I mentioned contactless. \"Sorry,\" she said. \"I didn't notice you had a contactless card,\" before processing it immediately.</p> <h2><strong>The Body Shop, eyeshadow, \u00a38: NO</strong></h2> <p>The sales assistant said she had never heard of contactless payments and had never been asked about it before.</p> <h2><strong>Paperchase, writing book, \u00a34: NO</strong></h2> <p>\"We don't do contactless payments, I'm afraid.\"</p> <h2><strong>Foyles, greetings card, \u00a31.99: NO</strong></h2> <p>When I asked if their card terminal would accept contactless payment, the assistants laughed and apologised. \"It took us 20 years to get these,\" one said, pointing at the chip-and-pin terminal. \"It'll take us another 20 years to get new ones!\"</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 17 September 2012. It originally said only 15% of Visa customers who could have opted to use contactless payments did so at Olympic venues. It should have said that 15% of all card payments under \u00a320 were made contactlessly.</p>",
  "<p>There's no escape: the pieces of plastic and dog-eared cardboard clutter up our wallets and purses and even overload our keyrings. It is 30 years since the UK's first high street-backed loyalty store card \u2013 Sainsbury's Homebase Spend and Save \u2013 was launched. But it wasn't until the arrival of the Tesco Clubcard in 1995 and the Boots Advantage card in 1997 that they started to gain mainstream popularity.</p> <p>This month <a href=\"http://www.nectar.com/NectarHome.nectar\" title=\"\">Nectar</a>, the UK's largest loyalty programme with 18.5 million collectors, celebrates its 10th anniversary with a series of launches \u2013 including new partnerships \u2013 which will not only reward holders for hitting the shops but also for their \"green\" behaviour.</p> <p>One announcement is a tie-up with Oxfam, allowing Nectar cardholders to cash in reward points against its <a href=\"http://www.oxfam.org.uk/shop/oxfam-unwrapped?pscid=ps_ggl_Unwrapped-Brand\" title=\"\">Unwrapped</a> range of aid gifts. These include helping to fund community education programmes, building farms and providing fresh water in developing communities. Eligible gifts start at 1,000 Nectar points, the equivalent of \u00a35 cash in line with its standardised reward points.</p> <p>A pilot scheme with Birmingham City Council, offering residents points for recycling (using barcoded boxes), is being evaluated with a view to rolling out elsewhere at a later date.</p> <p>Another trial is with the Royal Borough of Windsor and Maidenhead, offering points for paying council tax online. British Gas customers can earn points for switching to paperless billing, and at Sainsbury's (one of the four original launch partners) points are given for reusing carrier bags.</p> <p>James Frost, Nectar marketing director, said the move was key to a shift towards \"rewarding for interaction, not just transactions. We know our collectors are hugely responsive to partnerships and opportunities they truly believe in, and we are confident this latest partnership will be positively received\".</p> <p>The Nectar card has attracted three million new holders in the past three years; one is swiped 24 times a second in Britain, and in 10 years the scheme has given back almost \u00a32bn of rewards, including money off shopping, travel and general merchandise. And, as new technology forces the drive away from basic plastic and cards, more than 1&#xa0;million consumers have downloaded the Nectar app on to a smartphone.</p> <p>The American Express Nectar credit card is one of the fastest ways to collect points as it allows \"double dipping\". If you use it and the loyalty card at the same time, members can collect twice as many points.</p> <p>American Express announced this week that it is giving new Nectar credit card members the chance to receive \"many happy returns\" of their own with 10,000 bonus points, worth at least \u00a350, up for grabs. The offer is only available until 7 November and will be awarded when a member spends \u00a31,000 within three months of joining.</p> <p>And the banking arm of Sainsbury's has launched a credit card linked to the Nectar scheme, aimed at regular shoppers. It pays five times the number of points normally earned on Sainsbury's shopping for the first three months. It says this is the equivalent of up to an extra 5% back.</p> <p>Nectar has grown from a business being solely associated with rewarding loyalty points, to a tool which enables companies to better understand their customers, from identifying how retailers should organise their aisles to which promotions they offer. For example, Nectar has helped Sainsbury's organise its wine aisles by country rather than grape.</p> <p>But although Nectar claims to be the biggest reward scheme, Boots Advantage card is widely recognised as&#xa0;the most valuable. It gives four points for every \u00a31 spent, and one point is equivalent to 1p when redeemed.</p> <p>In other words it is a 4% discount card. Sign up for the parenting club and&#xa0;you earn 10 points for every \u00a31&#xa0;spent, although only on baby goods such as nappies.</p>",
  "<p>After months of searching for work since graduating in June from the University of Kent, Lindsey Kendall has had enough. Next week, the 21-year-old from Bishop's Stortford in Hertfordshire will be boarding a plane to New Zealand, leaving behind the gloom of Britain's jobless economy.</p> <p>Kendall joins an exodus of 10,000 Britons to New Zealand this year, plus many more who are heading to Australia and Canada and less-traditional destinations for emigrants, such as Germany and Singapore.</p> <p>\"The only available jobs I could see were hospitality or general low-entry jobs \u2013 nothing for a graduate. So I decided that if I'm going to work in a bar or on reception, I might as well do it in a new country as part of a new experience. I'm heading to New Zealand to start my working holiday visa, and hopefully it shouldn't take me too long to find a job.\"</p> <p>Kendall says that few of her fellow leavers have had much luck landing a graduate job. \"There's only one I&#xa0;know who has got what you might call a proper graduate job. Everyone else is still looking.\"</p> <p>Youth unemployment in the UK has reached one million and is continuing to rise, with figures this week showing 1,017,000 16-24-year-olds now claiming&#xa0;benefit.</p> <p>Sitting out the UK recession by heading to a stronger economy will give graduates new life skills and experiences that, when they return, may help them land a better job. A lucky few may also obtain high-paying graduate-style jobs in their chosen country \u2013 but don't bet on it. Online forums used by Britons on visa programmes for 18-30-year-olds warn others not to expect it easy when they arrive abroad.</p> <p>One commenter on <a href=\"http://www.backpackerboard.co.nz/\" title=\"Backpackerboard New Zealand\">Backpackerboard.co.nz</a> says: \"My girlfriend and I arrived in Auckland with just more than \u00a310,000. The accommodation costs are expensive, food is expensive too. Jobs are hard to find this year. We went everywhere in Wellington and Auckland with our CVs \u2026 I don't have a full-time job yet after one month of looking, but my girlfriend luckily does. Don't be too confident about getting jobs and don't bring too much luggage.\"</p> <p>Earnings are never going to be that high. Don't expect to get much more than \u00a310 an hour in \"hospitality\" jobs, though it may be a little more in jobs in the construction industry. After its earthquake last year, Christchurch in New Zealand is going through a rebuilding boom, although most of the vacancies are for workers in skilled&#xa0;trades.</p> <p>Many individuals, such as Kendall, are happy to head out alone, but others will want help from travel agencies that assist in putting together visas, bank accounts and accommodation. Lucy Fenwick, 20, from Hampshire, has spent a year in Australia, which was partly organised by STA Travel.</p> <p>\"I started in Sydney and worked in a restaurant as a waitress for a few months, which gave me the chance to see the city through the eyes of a local. I moved from Sydney and worked behind a bar in Melbourne and in a clothes shop in Brisbane.</p> <p>\"I loved feeling part of the community rather than just another young Brit passing through on her travels, and the experience has totally boosted my confidence. I've got a far broader outlook on life and hopefully it will make me stand out a bit from the other thousands of graduates.\"</p> <p>But although Australia and New Zealand play host to the bulk of Britons heading abroad for short-term work \u2013 not least because they speak English and offer more generous working visa programmes than other destinations \u2013 other countries may provide just as many opportunities, and will prove to employers you're not just a semi-permanent gap-year traveller.</p> <p>Canada's economy is relatively strong: it didn't suffer the banking crash that affected Europe and the US, and young British people can work there for two years on the <a href=\"http://www.canadainternational.gc.ca/united_kingdom-royaume_uni/experience_canada_experience/index.aspx?view=d\" title=\"\">International Experience Canada</a> programme.</p> <p>According to the Canadian high commission, the programme has been very popular this year. \"There are opportunities in a number of sectors for graduates, specifically in the hi-tech gaming industry, and there is always a high demand for workers in construction and hospitality,\" a commission spokeswoman says.</p> <p>Visa restrictions effectively make the US off-limits to British graduates seeking work, and elsewhere job seekers will run up against language barriers. One traditional route is to obtain a Teaching English as a Foreign Language (Tefl) certificate, then head to Spain, Italy or Japan for work.</p> <p>But there is a sting in the tail for already debt-laden graduates heading overseas: many countries demand evidence that you have enough money&#xa0;in the bank to look after yourself. Japan wants to see \u00a32,500 in cleared funds before admitting you, while in New Zealand you need to have NZ$350 per month of your stay. This represents around \u00a3180 a month. Staying for a year would require more than \u00a32,100.</p> <p>So what are the rules and prospects for young people heading abroad? Guardian Money looked at some of the leading, and less obvious, destinations</p> <h2>Australia</h2> <p><strong>Visa restrictions</strong> Up to 12&#xa0;months for people aged 18 to 30 interested in a working holiday. Apply online (A$280/\u00a3190 fee) at <a href=\"http://www.immi.gov.au/e_visa/working-holiday.htm\" title=\"\">immi.gov.au</a>. You can do any kind of work in Australia, but can only be with the same employer for six months. You may be asked on arrival to prove that you have&#xa0;\"sufficient funds\", which is assessed on a case-by-case basis. Anything less than A$3,000 (\u00a31,950) is considered risky.</p> <p><strong>Jobs</strong> The greatest demand is in Western Australia, home to the mining boom. A cafe job in Sydney will pay about A$18 (\u00a311) an hour. Head to the outback to try your hand as a jackaroo (boys) or a jillaroo (girls) working on a sheep or cattle farm. Roles may include caring for livestock, maintaining the cleanliness of the farm or even \"mustering\" (rounding up) on horseback. Full-time work could pay as much as \u00a3300 a week and accommodation is often provided.</p> <p><strong>Cost of living </strong>For a one-bed apartment you might pay between \u00a3750 and \u00a31,000 a month depending on if you are in a city centre or not. Generally, the cost of living is slightly higher in Australia than in the UK, something that is worth considering.</p> <h2>New Zealand</h2> <p><strong>Visa restrictions</strong> There are two options: a 12-month visa or a 23-month visa for UK citizens aged 18 to 30. Apply at <a href=\"http://www.immigration.govt.nz/migrant/stream/work/workingholiday/unitedkingdomworkingholidayscheme.htm\" title=\"\">immigration.govt.nz</a>. With either option you are only entitled to work for 12&#xa0;months, and each is based on certain&#xa0;requirements \u2013 one being access&#xa0;to \u00a3180 (NZ$350) per month of your&#xa0;stay.</p> <p><strong>Jobs</strong> The usual hospitality roles in Auckland, Wellington and Queenstown. Construction jobs in Christchurch. Seasonal fruit-picking is ideal temporary work and can be done all over the north and south islands. It is hard-going and not especially well paid, but you could earn up to \u00a310 an hour for your toil. On the upside, agricultural work is a chance to get up close and personal with the stunning landscapes of New Zealand.</p> <p><strong>Cost of living</strong> The New Zealand dollar, as with the Australian dollar, has soared in recent years against sterling, so food and drink is on a par with, or indeed above, the UK. But rents are still affordable: accommodation in the form of a one-bed apartment might be about \u00a3450 a month.</p> <h2>Canada</h2> <p><strong>Visa restrictions</strong> Working visas available to adults aged 18 to 35 under the International Experience Canada programme. Apply at <a href=\"http://international.gc.ca/experience/\" title=\"\">international.gc.ca/experience</a> (\u00a390 fee). Unfortunately, applications for 2012 have already closed (there was a quota of 5,350 for the UK), but will open for 2013 later this year. You will also need to demonstrate cleared funds of C$2,500 (\u00a31,600).</p> <p><strong>Jobs </strong>The usual hospitality and construction jobs, but the high commission in London says jobs in the hi-tech gaming industry are aplenty.</p> <p>If you want a job in the public sector you will need decent French language skills. And don't be put off by the cold winters; you could turn it into&#xa0;an opportunity. A ski instructor in&#xa0;Whistler \u2013 a job with perks such as a free&#xa0;lift pass \u2013 might earn you up to \u00a3500 a month with food and accommodation included.</p> <p><strong>Cost of living </strong>Canada is another country whose currency has appreciated strongly in recent years. Vancouver often appears in lists of the most expensive cities in North America.</p> <h2>US</h2> <p><strong>Visa restrictions</strong> Very stringent. There is no working holiday visa programme of the type UK citizens enjoy in Australia and New Zealand. You need to have a job offer in place before even applying for a visa.</p> <p><strong>Jobs </strong>One option is the \"J-1\" visa, which allows those between the ages of 18 and 26 to work as an au pair for up to 12&#xa0;months, with the possibility of an extension if all goes well. You will be provided with food and board to work at least 45 hours a week, but must also complete certain courses before you are eligible.</p> <p><strong>Cost of living </strong>Generally, the cost of living is similar to that of the UK, but it can be cheaper depending on where in the US you are. Accommodation costs are extremely varied. A one-bed apartment in suburban New York will be well over \u00a31,000 a month, and \u00a32,000 in town, but elsewhere in the country will be much lower.</p> <h2>Germany</h2> <p><strong>Visa restrictions </strong>None. All EU nationals, including those from Britain, have the right to look for work in Germany. The country is a much better bet than Spain or Italy (suffering from high youth unemployment) or the Nordic nations (which suffer from high&#xa0;living costs).</p> <p><strong>Jobs</strong> Unemployment is lower than Britain, at about 7%, but while jobs are available they could not be described as plentiful. Search for work at the <a href=\"http://www.arbeitsagentur.de/\" title=\"\">arbeitsagentur.de</a>, Germany's job centres. Head to Bavaria where unemployment is less than 4% rather than the old East Germany where unemployment is widespread.</p> <p>Speaking German helps \u2013 so why not perfect your German as a tour guide? There are plenty of travel companies that will be happy to have you, and your job will undoubtedly expose you to some of Germany's finest attractions. Don't expect to get rich, though: rates of pay will not be much higher than \u00a310 an hour.</p> <p><strong>Cost of living</strong> Less than in the UK, and surprisingly so in high-profile places such as Berlin. A one-bed flat can be in the region of \u00a3300 a month.</p> <h2>Japan</h2> <p><strong>Visa restrictions </strong>Under the Working Holiday Scheme, a limited number of British citizens aged 18 to 30 may be granted a visa that allows them to enter Japan and work for up to a year. You must have \u00a32,500 in cleared funds and have the last three months' bank statements to hand to show to immigration officials.</p> <p><strong>Jobs</strong> The official <a href=\"http://tokyo-foreigner.jsite.mhlw.go.jp/english.html\" title=\"\">\"Hello Work\" job centres</a> in Tokyo, Osaka and Nagoya help foreigners find jobs.

  "<p>We quite often talk, colloquially, about the written language having \"evolved\". As the linguist David Crystal's new book demonstrates with some panache, almost exactly the opposite took place. In evolution, a series of random variations gives rise to something that appears orderly and designed. In the history of English spelling, though, we can trace a whole series of purposive, thought-through and often ingenious practical decisions \u2013 made over the years by scribes, compositors and lexicographers \u2013 whose net result is a complete flaming boggins.</p> <p>Crystal sets out to explain how these decisions were made and why, and why the results after hundreds of years are so messy and confusing. He does so with great brevity and clarity, starting with the first Christian missionaries jerry-rigging the Roman alphabet to make sense of Anglo-Saxon vocables (that buzzing noise made with the tongue and the top teeth: how are we going to spell \"<em>that\"</em>?) right up to the likelihood that the internet's unending babble of \"rhubarb rhubarb rhubarb\" will, within a decade, more likely be \"rubarb rubarb rubarb\".</p> <p>He shows a brisk impatience with the tradition that likes to pretend that English spelling is senseless. The famous suggestion that you could spell \"fish\" \"ghoti\" (<em>gh</em> as in \"rough\", <em>o</em> as in \"women\" and <em>ti </em>as in \"motion\") is a witticism often ascribed to George Bernard Shaw but, Crystal says witheringly, has been doing the rounds since the middle of the 19th century. It is, he argues \"complete naughtiness. The spelling <em>ti</em> is NEVER used with this sound at the end of a word in English, and the spelling <em>gh</em> is NEVER used with this sound at the beginning of a word.\"</p> <p>It doesn't do, then, to simply throw your hands up and say: \"Isn't our language mad?\" The real story is much more interesting than that. That \"aberrant\" has one B and \"abbreviate\" has two, for instance, isn't capricious or illogical at all \u2013 if you consider the sources of those words. \"Ab + breviate\" gives us the double B; whereas \"ab + errant\" doesn't ask for it.</p> <p>The use of the silent E, for instance, makes very good sense: scribes were trying to find a way of indicating a long preceding vowel sound: that gives us the difference between \"run\" and \"rune\". Approaching from the other direction was a monk named Orrm at the turn of the 13th-century. He suggested doubling consonants up to indicated a preceding short vowel: \"hopping\" as opposed to \"hoping\". When scribes were being paid by the inch, maximalism could be profitable. Why write \"run\" when you could write \"runne\"? Kerching!</p> <p>Spelling has been influenced by a whole range of complicated but perfectly decipherable factors. It has been influenced by the source languages of loanwords or by the mother-tongues of the scribes writing things down (French scribes after the conquest didn't like Anglo-Saxon words that ended in \u2013s, for example, so they substituted \u2013ce, giving us \"mice\", \"lice\" and \"ice\" among others). It has been influenced by analogy (sometimes sensible, sometimes mistaken) with other words already in the language \u2013 \"could\", for instance, acquired its \"l\" because of its association with \"would\" and \"should\". It has been influenced by ease of writing (which explains why Z, despite being an incredibly common sound, is a rare letter), by ease of reading, or by the need to mark words out from already-established homophones.</p> <p>\"Stake\", for a pointy bit of wood, was already in the lexicon when the slab of meat came along in the 15th century. So after experiments with \"steike\", \"steyke\", \"styke\", \"steke\" and \"steake\" it took its present form, and is now the only \"-eak\" word to rhyme with \"break\". The thing on the end of your foot used to be called either \"toe\" or \"too\" in Middle English \u2013 but since one heard the word \"too\" too often (it having already amicably separated from its homophone \"to\") it made sense to make that too \"toe\".</p> <p>What of the H in \"ghost\"? The word in Anglo-Saxon didn't have it: the Holy Ghost was a \"Hali Gast\", and Chaucer's ghosts remained, likewise, H-free. But when William Caxton set up shop in London he needed compositors, and, of course, there weren't any English ones available. So he imported them \u2013 among their number the splendidly named Wynkyn de Worde \u2013 from the continent. They spoke Flemish, so \"if a word reminded them of its Flemish counterpart, why not spell it the Flemish way?\" A Flemish spook was called a \"gheest\" \u2013 and so \"ghost\" came in as a variation. By the end of the 16th century, \"ghost\" had seen off \"gost\" \u2013 and \"aghast\" and \"ghastly\" had seen off \"agast\" and \"gastly\". Crystal salts his work liberally with such good examples, and is able to argue that English spelling makes sense without feeling obliged to pretend that's the same thing as being simple. More than one chapter ends with words to the effect: \"If you think that's the last of the exceptions, brace yourself ...\"</p> <p>Crystal's practical burden, set out in two short appendix chapters, is that spelling can be, and would be better, taught in linguistic context: if you can explain why \"accommodate\" came to be spelt like that, it stands a better chance of sticking in the mind. And yes, he says: spelling can be fun. I agree. James Joyce transcribed the noise a cat makes as: \"Mrkgnao\". That is surely something that everyone from dame-school prescriptivists to the most freewheeling of linguistic fieldworkers can agree is obviously \u2026 well, correct.</p> <p>\u2022 Sam Leith's <em>You Talkin' to Me?</em> is published by Profile.</p>",
  "<p>Portland didn't become the US capital of cool overnight. The city was a centre for independent music for decades before the press got wind of it. If a hipster is a person who wants to seem creative without actually creating anything, there's a serious lack of hipsters in this city. The music and art being made here are world-class.</p> <p>But it's not just the music scene in Portland that makes a trip to the north-western state of Oregon worth a journey: its coast is spectacular, too, and, unlike neighbouring California, its beaches are almost empty. You can immerse yourself in the music scene then spend a week on some of the US's most beautiful shoreline. Portland residents today flock to pretty villages such as Cannon Beach \u2013 sometimes called Portland on Sea, as it has so many art galleries \u2013 and Manzanita.</p> <p>Cannon Beach is a pretty warren of independent bookshops, cafes, galleries, and record shops. I travelled there recently while spending my summer in Oregon with my boyfriend, who plays in Portland indie-folk band Brothers Young. In front of us, the Pacific glittered all the way to the horizon. Great rock formations rose from the sea into the sun, black against a burning blue-bronze sky.</p> <p>We had a beachfront dinner of bouillabaisse, oyster shooters and local wine with some friends at Mo's Restaurant (<a href=\"http://www.moschowder.com\" title=\"\">moschowder.com</a>) down the road in Tolovana Park. Later, at the Treehouse \u2013 a one-bedroom cabin in evergreen forest, high above Cannon Beach \u2013 we talked and sank beers on the deck as the ocean turned pink and grey through the darkening treetops.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396174240\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/pictures/2012/9/13/1347552322744/Cannon-Beach-by-night-001.jpg\" alt=\"Cannon Beach by night\" width=\"460\" height=\"277\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cannon Beach by night. Photograph: Corbis</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Corbis</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Mornings, the only sound was the scuffle of falling pine cones through the open windows. Downstairs, there was a cast-iron stove, a sofa, a telescope and a hand-built kitchen. Up here, there was just our bed and a glass wall view of the ocean. Blissful: watching the waves from the duvet; reading on the deck; moseying down through the village shops to curl up on a rug on the beach in the evenings.</p> <p>When Cannon Beach began to feel just a little too perfect, we drove a few miles up the coast to the resort of Seaside \u2013 all concrete hotels and exuberant kitsch. We had a ball on the fairground rides \u2013 then decided maybe we actually preferred Perfect, after all.</p> <p>We had spent several days further south at Yachats \u2013 a sleepy village of wooden houses hugging a sparkling inlet dotted with surfers. I'd been talking a lot to our friend Trevino Brings Plenty, who is Native American (about 40,000 Native Americans live in Portland), and kept thinking about how this beautiful spot had been the legal home of the Alsea tribe until an unratified treaty created the Coast Range Reservation in the 1850s. Road-diggers turned up Alsea graves in the 1930s when they built the coastal highway. Everywhere we went had two histories, and one of them lay under blowing sand. But Yachats means \"little river with a big mouth\". That's a good description of any half-buried past. It speaks eventually.</p> <p>Our cottage there stood on the long beach between Yachats and Waldport. I swam in the Pacific in the mornings, and wrote, and wished I could stay forever \u2013 or at least long enough to write a book. Ocean wind blew through our curtains, flowers in our garden grew sideways, and in the brilliant glare of the midday sea, the distant spume of whales caught the sunlight. Most days, our beach was empty. South of Yachats, vast dunes sweep for 50 miles from Florence to Coos Bay; the most impressive rise over 150m, at Umpqua.</p> <p>Just north of Yachats, at the mouth of the Alsea river, we went crabbing at midnight with gear from the bait shop by the pier. The tide towed our trap away from us to the muted strains of Country &amp; Western from a radio belonging to crabbers just along the shore. A full moon shone on the harbour and on the slick heads of seals, streaking them silver.</p> <p>When Michael hauled our trap in it was clattering with Dungeness crabs. I liked the waiting times in between: looking out at that black racing water, knowing we might have something underneath it. Conversation was just ripples on the peacefulness. At two in the morning, we wedged our bucket of crabs in the bed of the rental truck, drove home down the starlit highway, and feasted.</p> <p>The drive from Yachats to Cannon Beach is a glorious road trip. We stopped first in the bustling town of Newport for a whale-watching tour. Boats were unloading albacore tuna on the quay. The shadow of the huge 1930s steel bridge eased over us as we slid further out, past pelicans on stone jetties, into the ocean. Grey whales dived close, their tails making giant wishbones that dripped against the lush green shores.</p> <p>Back in dock, we bought takeaway clam chowder plus saltwater taffy \u2013 chewy coastal candy \u2013 for the car. We stopped again at Yaquina Head, part of the <a href=\"http://www.fws.gov/oregoncoast/oregonislands/\" title=\"\">Oregon Islands national wildlife refuge</a>, and ate our chowder on a bench beside the lighthouse. A cliff path led down to a black lava cobble beach scattered with bone-white driftwood. Starfish and turban snails clustered in the tide pools. I lay down on the cobbles in the hazy heat, and watched a colony of guillemots.</p> <p>The coastal highway carried us on over narrow creeks and wide reedbeds. Pines clung to cliffs that tumbled down to the sea; dark gold sand sliced the roadside. Always there was the Pacific, racing and shining beside us, flickering behind red alders. We drove with the windows down and the music up, passing Lincoln City, where the Confederated Tribes of Siletz Indians now operate the Chinook Winds Casino.</p> <p>In the Siuslaw National Forest a pair of eagles circled above the Douglas firs. In the town of Tillamook, whose dairies process milk from the fertile grasslands of the Tillamook, Nestucca and Nehalem valleys, we stopped at the cheese factory (<a href=\"http://www.tillamook.com\" title=\"\">tillamook.com</a>). We gorged on cheddar samples, and nearly left after consuming half our bodyweights in lactose \u2026 but then found the ice-cream counter, with flavours from wild blackberry to root beer. It was evening when we finally pulled in to Cannon Beach.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396174241\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/pictures/2012/9/13/1347552248915/Dunes-by-the-Siuslaw-Fore-008.jpg\" alt=\"Dunes by the Siuslaw Forest\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dunes by the Siuslaw Forest.

The city is heaven for music lovers, but it actually exceeds its own hype. Tiny joints such as Valentines (232 SW Ankeny, <a href=\"http://www.valentineslifeblood.blogspot.com\" title=\"\">valentineslifeblood.blogspot.com</a>) host bands that, in the UK, would instantly be hailed as the Next Big Thing. Rontoms (600 East Burnside, <a href=\"http://www.rontoms.net/\" title=\"\">rontoms.net</a>), over the river, puts on free concerts every Sunday with local and touring musicians that would be hard to catch for any price back home. The Secret Society Ballroom (116 NE Russell St, <a href=\"http://secretsociety.net/\" title=\"\">secretsociety.net</a>), formerly home to various underground Victorian brotherhoods, puts on big gigs in its velvet-draped concert space, complete with a wood-panelled cocktail bar.</p> <p>I stayed with Michael in Sellwood, a suburb to the south-east, where vintage cars roll past art deco shopfronts and retro bars. Division is another great south-east neighbourhood, home to the Bluebird Guesthouse, a 1910 villa filled with vintage furniture. We browsed the Sellwood antique stores, swam off the docks and caught a movie at the tiny 1920s Moreland Theatre on SE Milwaukie Avenue. There are excellent food carts in the district: in Sellwood, the best are on the corner of SE 13th &amp; Lexington; in Division, they're at SE 48th &amp; Division. I liked blueberry soup and emmental toasties from a cart called Chowdah.</p> <p>We treated ourselves to a night of luxury at the Heathman. Like a Hollywood actress trying to live down a sex-tape scandal, this classy hotel was politely trying to downplay its starring role in Fifty Shades of Grey. It has a lending library for guests, stocked with signed first editions and staffed by a sommelier. I reclined on the chaise longue, reading DBC Pierre. All very Heathman, but it didn't last. A few hours later, we were down by the river in the Star Bar (639 SE Morrison Street, <a href=\"http://star-bar-rocks.com\" title=\"\">star-bar-rocks.com</a>) a punk hunk of old ungentrified Portland, drinking whiskey while the Ramones blasted out on to the street.</p> <p>Independent record stores thrive in this city; Crossroads Music (3130 SE Hawthorne, <a href=\"http://www.xro.com/\" title=\"\">xro.com</a>) also sells beautiful collectible gig posters by Portland artist <a href=\"http://chrisbigalke.tumblr.com/\" title=\"\">Chris Bigalke</a>. I couldn't resist the world's biggest independent bookstore: Powell's City Of Books (<a href=\"http://www.powells.com/\" title=\"\">powells.com</a>) on West Burnside, with 1.6 acres of new and used volumes. I would have got completely lost in here without Michael, but there are worse places to lose your way than somewhere between Sherman Alexie and Mark Twain.</p> <p>Rock &amp; Rose (616 East Burnisde, <a href=\"http://www.rocknroseinc.com/\" title=\"\">rocknroseinc.com</a>) is a vintage clothing store that also stocks gorgeous leather bags from <a href=\"http://martinesatchels.tumblr.com/\" title=\"\">Martine Satchels</a> in which to stash your lastest Palahniuk novel. For clothes, there are heaps more vintage stores, plus local designer shops such as <a href=\"http://www.isaachers.com/\" title=\"\">Isaac Hers</a> and <a href=\"http://communionpdx.com/\" title=\"\">Communion</a>. But I preferred to buy from <a href=\"http://pdxguide.org/browse/outer-southeast/thrift-stores/bins-the-aka-goodwill-outlet/\" title=\"\">The Bins</a> (1740 SE Ochoco St) \u2013 a pay-by-weight used clothing free-for-all \u2013 and from neighbourhood yard sales.</p> <p>Brothers Young were playing a gig in Michael's hometown of Bend, on the edge of the desert, so we made a trip of it. The three-hour drive from Portland winds over Mount Hood and through dusty canyons and the Warm Springs Indian Reservation, to the high desert plateau. Sagebrush spreads silver over open spaces and snow-capped volcanic peaks break the flat horizon.</p> <p>Once a rough lumber town, Bend has reinvented itself as an outdoor activities centre: with mountain biking and abseiling, rafting and snowboarding. We canoed on the Deschutes river, through overhanging willow and clouds of ducks, and swam by the old timber mills. Beneath Broken Top mountain, I hiked past waterfalls in the Tumalo gorge, the towering white water-knives cool among the juniper, then sat down on a gravel bank to read Steinbeck.</p> <p>In downtown Bend, I shopped at Ranch Records (831 Wall Street) and the lovely Between The Covers bookstore (645 NW Delaware Ave) with its shelves of old-school candy. We had drinks on the firelit patio of McMenamins hotel and bar, where I became quite attached to the house-made wildflower wheat beer. We played ping-pong and Keno in late-night bars whose names I can't remember. Bend is 1,100m above sea level, so maybe it was the altitude that fogged my memory.</p> <p>What remain clear in my memory of Portland and Oregon are moments of sheer happiness. Lying across laps in the back seat of a car crossing Burnside, warm night air and streetlights racing past. The dazzle of the ocean. Moonlight on harbour water. The scent of the forests, and swimming from docks. The music that came from the desert expanse, from roadsides of roses and half-forgotten histories.</p>",
  "<p>Scrambling up on the rocky outcrop was not easy. The stones were loose and crumbling, the bushes thick and unyielding. Most of all, I was alone. I kept telling myself that: I'm alone on a 4,000m mountain plateau in the heart of Africa, and I have wandered off the path.</p> <p>At the top, I sat down on a flat rock and enjoyed the spectacular view across the Aberdare national park. The sky was a miraculous deep blue, broken only by the silhouette of an Augur buzzard cruising along some invisible air current. I scanned the grasslands below: no elephants or lions to be seen.</p> <p>For many years, most tourism in Africa has had a very simple arc: you drive in a 4x4, bouncing up a track, then sit and watch a group of animals. Then you do it again. It is a model that evolved out of the colonial-era hunting experience, the guns being replaced with cameras (though not entirely \u2013 big game hunting is still going on).</p> <p>But Africa is changing, and fast. Old ways are being dropped. And nowhere more so than in Kenya, a country with double-digit economic growth and an expanding population with rising economic expectations. Change has also come to the Aberdares, a mountain massif 50 miles north of Nairobi. In particular there are new campsites and nature trails that allow visitors to do what was previously unthinkable: walk for several days across a reserve where lions, elephants and buffalo roam. For anyone who has known the sheltered world of guides and 4x4s, this is a revolution.</p> <p>I was in the Aberdares as part of a team making a film about urgent botanical work going on in Kenya, but I was determined to sample the delights of walking through the bush. Fortunately, in the higher altitudes of the range, the more dangerous animals are very rarely seen; they prefer to stay in the forests below. I had left the team rhapsodising over some strange tiny plants in a mountain stream and taken off along the ridge, heading south. There was a clear path, but I had found the lookout hill irresistible.</p> <p>Although the primary draw of Kenya is almost always its wildlife, in the Aberdares the plant life runs it a close second. East Africa has a handful of isolated high-altitude ranges, including Kilimanjaro, Mount Kenya and Mount Eldoret. On each of these a unique vegetation has evolved to cope with blistering daytime sun and freezing night-time temperatures.</p> <p>That evolutionary challenge has resulted in some bizarre and wonderful creations: four-metre-tall groundsel trees whose leaves ooze an anti-freeze solution, and shaggy lobelia trees standing like Easter Island statues in the grassy slopes. With global temperatures rising, these giants are retreating up the mountains and are now on the very tops, with nowhere to go. Only the previous day we had stopped our Land Rover a short distance below the summit to collect seed from a type of wild tomato, a species only discovered a year before but already endangered. With an estimated one-in-four plant species now threatened with extinction, this environment is at the front line of the battle to save genetic material that could be vital to agriculture and medicine.</p> <p>I left my secluded mountaintop and clambered back down to the path, then wandered on into a sunny dell where the giant groundsels were clustered together. In Europe, the plant is a common weed and these trees had an oddly familiar look. It was like walking through my own untended allotment after eating the wrong kind of mushrooms.</p> <p>The path reached a ridge line and for the next hour I had magnificent views all the way to Mount Kenya, 50 miles away. When Europeans first saw this peak it was a snow-capped wonder, but now there was no sign of ice at all.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396242936\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/pictures/2012/9/12/1347468007673/The-Fisherman-s-Lodge-is--001.jpg\" alt=\"The Fisherman\u2019s Lodge is one of only two lodges in Aberdare park\" width=\"460\" height=\"277\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Fisherman\u2019s Lodge is one of only two lodges in Aberdare park</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>That night I rejoined the film team to sleep at Fisherman's Lodge, one of only two lodges within the Aberdares. It's a pair of sturdy cottages with broad verandas, a living room with large fireplace, a couple of spacious bedrooms and a caretaker-cum-cook, Francis. You can book these places independently and drive yourself through the park, though you'll need room for an armed wildlife scout to accompany you through the lower forested areas, where elephant and leopard roam. Having said that, dealing with the Kenya Wildlife Service can be like negotiating with the Ottoman Empire on a bank holiday. Phones and emails are, in my experience, answered only very patchily. We organised our trip at the local KWS office in Nyeri, the nearest town to the Aberdares. Another possibility is to use a trekking company in Nairobi.</p> <p>At sunset, a small group of reedbuck came gently towards the cabins to drink from the dripping outside tap and to pass the night close to humans, who offer a modicum of protection from predators. There is also a campsite nearby. When I checked it out the reedbuck were there too, grazing quietly, and a grey duiker, a small, secretive deer, bolted away.</p> <p>As night fell, we marvelled at the tranquility and the stars, listened to a distant lion roar, then the yelping cry of a hyena. Then, as the fire crackled and the whisky went down, our botanists, Paul Kirika and Tim Pearce, together with deputy game warden Mwangi, who had come up to see us, reminisced about close encounters in the bush. Apparently there's nothing tranquil about being a botanist in Kenya: elephants charging, snakes suddenly appearing, and always the big danger, the rogue male buffalo, most feared of the animals because of his irascible, short-sighted aggression.</p> <p>One of the scouts up on the Aberdares had been chased, had fallen over, and the buffalo had charged right over him: he miraculously survived with no more than cuts and bruises. As Mwangi reminded us, however, it is the humans who represent the real threat. With its populations of rhinos and elephants, the park is a draw for professional poaching gangs, a resurgent menace all over Africa.</p> <p>Next morning I walked with Tim, taking the trail out of Fisherman's Lodge down through some bushes and across the stream. The air was cold and there were crusts of shining ice in the shadows. Once you are on foot in Africa, animals become far more elusive and difficult to spot, though any encounter you do manage is far more exciting than from a vehicle.</p> <p>A brace of white-faced vultures flapped away from the rosewood trees; a pair of waterbuck snorted and trotted off. Misty green light came dancing through the lichens that festooned the trees. Tim had his head down, magnifying lens in hand, absorbed in the tiny worlds of seed and leaf. In the mud behind him, very clear and large, was a fresh leopard print.</p> <p>Mwangi came up the track after us with a scout carrying a rifle.</p> <p>We made a steep descent to a stream and searched for the simple footbridge. \"When the Britishers came, they put trout in these rivers and built the lodge.\"</p> <p>\"Can you still fish here?\"</p> <p>\"There are places to fish \u2013 people do eat the trout.\"</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396242937\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/pictures/2012/9/12/1347467940181/Sykes--monkeys-are-common-001.jpg\" alt=\"Sykes\u2019 monkeys are common in Aberdare national park\" width=\"460\" height=\"277\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sykes monkeys are common in Aberdare national park</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Much of these upland Kenyan areas must have reminded those old colonials of northern Britain: the moorland and the dark rushing streams. At Embu, a small town on the slopes of Mount Kenya, there's even a lovely hotel called the Izaak Walton, after the 17th-century English pioneer of angling writing.</p> <p>We dropped down to a stretch of moorland, stopping to watch some distant buffalo. \"Isn't it dangerous?\" I asked Mwangi, \"to let hikers wander around?\"</p> <p>He shook his head. \"The trail is marked and carefully designed to keep to safe areas.\"</p> <p>For the rest of the day, however, Mwangi complained about our bad luck at not seeing elephants.</p> <p>\"It's great to see them when you are on foot, but of course you must be very careful and never approach too close.\"</p> <p>We spotted giant forest hogs, rare animals only discovered in 1904. This is surprising since they are so huge: males weigh in at a quarter of a tonne. There were warthogs, buffalo and monkeys, too, but no elephants. Reluctantly, on our last night, we had to pack our bags in the Land Rover and descend from the clouds to the world below.</p> <p>The Aberdares, however, had one more surprise for us. Rattling along the track, we slowed to let a bush hare cross. There was a wild swishing in the trees, a brief and sudden trumpeting, then a group of five elephants were dashing across too, their trunks high and waving wildly. For once, I had to admit, it was good to be inside a vehicle.</p>",
  "<p>In 1902, the caustic American satirist <a href=\"http://www.ambrosebierce.org/\" title=\"\">Ambrose Bierce</a> \u2013 who once reviewed a book by observing that its covers were \"too far apart\" \u2013 proposed a&#xa0;new social convention. Modern life, he complained, involved being introduced to far too many people: you'd meet a friend in the street, then a friend of <em>his </em>would stroll by, and before you knew it you'd have a new, unasked-for acquaintance, with all the obligations that entailed. Bierce blamed the democratic spirit of the 20th century: in the older, more formal days, stricter rules governed who could form acquaintanceships with whom. \"It is to be wished,\" Bierce wrote, \"that some great social force, say a billionaire, would set up a system of disintroductions.\" He imagined a generous gent, a&#xa0;Mr White, resolving to disintroduce two friends of his, Mr Black and Mr Green. \"Mr Black,\" he might say, \"knowing the low esteem in which you&#xa0;hold each other, I have the honour to disintroduce you from Mr Green.\" Mr Black (bowing): \"Sir, I have long desired your unacquaintance.\" Mr Green: \"Charmed to unmeet you, sir.\" Mr White: \"I'm sure you will become very good strangers.\"</p> <p>It's probably best, for Bierce's sake, that he never lived to see <a href=\"http://blog.facebook.com/blog.php?post=15610312130\" title=\"\">Facebook's People You May Know.</a> Ever since the widespread adoption of email in the 1990s, in fact, the phenomenon he bemoaned has reached a scale he could never have imagined. Technology exposes us to vastly more opportunities for making social connections, and far more effortlessly than even a stroll down the street and a handshake. Yet an etiquette for terminating those links, should they outlive their mutual benefit \u2013 if they ever had any \u2013 remains as absent as ever. Even \"unfriending\" someone on Facebook, the closest equivalent to Bierce's proposal, feels like delivering a slap in the face (and not even a well-timed slap, since you can't be sure when they'll find out). Facebook itself hates unfriending, for commercial reasons, and thus makes it easy to hide updates from tiresome contacts without their knowing \u2013 a deeply unsatisfactory arrangement that leaves you at constant risk of meeting someone face-to-face who assumes you must already know they've got engaged, or had another baby, or been dumped, or fired, or widowed.</p> <p>The result \u2013 at least for anyone who can still recall friendship before the social media age \u2013 can be an awkward hodgepodge. There are Facebook friends with whom you want to share everything, those you've grown apart from, and those you've barely heard of. (You can assign them to different lists, but then you've introduced a whole new layer of decisions: who belongs where? What qualifies someone to be switched from one list to another? And so on.) There are Twitter followers with whom your acquaintance is strictly professional, those you know from school, but didn't necessarily like, and those who are your dad. Not long ago, I realised, with a feeling of dismay, that I'd started to think of some of these contacts \u2013 not most of them, but some \u2013 as clutter.</p> <p>If that sounds a heartless way to think about other people, consider the parallels. Physical clutter, as a widespread problem, is only as old as modern consumerism: before the availability of cheap gadgets, clothes and self-assembly furniture, it wasn't an option for most people to accumulate basements full of unwanted exercise bikes, games consoles or broken Ikea bookshelves. We think we want this stuff, but, once it becomes clutter, it exerts a subtle psychological tug. It weighs us down. The notion of purging it begins to strike as us appealing, and dumping all the crap into bin bags feels like a liberation. \"Friend clutter\", likewise, accumulates because it's effortless to accumulate it: before the internet, the only bonds you'd retain were the ones you actively cultivated, by travel or letter-writing or phone calls, or those with the handful of people you saw every day. Friend clutter exerts a similar psychological pull. The difference, as Bierce understood, comes with the decluttering part: exercise bikes and PlayStations don't get offended when you get rid of them. People do. So we let the clutter accumulate.</p> <p>Or most of us do. Last year, a writer of romance novels from Illinois named <a href=\"http://arlynnpresser.com/\" title=\"\">ArLynn Presser</a> embarked upon what you might call an audit of her so-called friends \u2013 the social equivalent of picking up each old gadget and scrutinising it, before keeping it or throwing it out. She was recently divorced, and her adult children had left home \u2013 \"If your kids don't call you a lot, that's a&#xa0;sign you've done a good job,\" she told me \u2013 and she was spending hours every day on Facebook. \"I was keeping up with everybody's news, noticing what they were doing, staying up to date, and I&#xa0;began to think, 'Seriously though, who <em>are </em>these people? If&#xa0;I was in college with you, and we weren't particularly good friends then \u2013 why are you suddenly someone I message back and forth with at least once a day?'\" Politeness, she knew, was the reason she'd accepted some of her online friends: \"Say someone sends a request and you look at your mutual friends and you wonder, 'Wait \u2013 were you the person I was talking to at that wedding?' You don't want to ask, 'How, exactly, do I know you, and why would I want to be your friend?'\" Presser had 325 Facebook friends, a little money stashed away, and a fear of flying that she wanted to overcome, so she decided to combine all three: she made a New Year's resolution to visit them all, to find out why \u2013 or, indeed, whether \u2013 they were friends.</p> <p>\"I don't think I realised,\" Presser says, \"that it was going to be quite as big a deal as it was.\"</p> <p>To recognise that friend clutter is a problem, it should be emphasised, doesn't mean condemning online friendship per se. It's commonplace, these days, to encounter the concern that social media might be making us lonelier \u2013 that online bonds can't be as fulfilling as \"real-life\" ones. The sociologist Sherry Turkle, author of the recent book <a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9780465010219\" title=\"\">Alone Together</a>, worries that \"we have sacrificed conversation for mere connection. Email, Twitter, Facebook, all of these have their places\u2026 but no matter how valuable, they do not substitute for conversation.\" One frequently cited statistic, based on research among Americans, is that between 1985 and 2004 the number of people who said they didn't have a single \"confidant\" \u2013 someone to whom they could talk about anything \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/30038995?uid=3739920&amp;uid=2129&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=70&amp;uid=4&amp;uid=3739256&amp;sid=21101038109423\" title=\"\">rose from 10% to 25%</a>. A further 20% had only one such person. It might seem hard to avoid the conclusion that all the time we spend online, superficially connected but in a more profound sense isolated, must be to blame.</p> <p>Except that, according to an ever-growing body of evidence, social media <em>isn't</em> making us lonelier or less deeply connected. Instead, study after study endorses the idea of \"media multiplexity\": people who communicate lots via one medium, it&#xa0;turns out, are the kind of people who communicate lots via others as well. <a href=\"http://www.pewinternet.org/Reports/2006/The-Strength-of-Internet-Ties/01-Summary-of-Findings.aspx\" title=\"\">Regular emailers are more likely also to be regular telephoners</a>, one study found; people who use Facebook multiple times a day, according to another investigation, have <a href=\"http://www.pewinternet.org/Reports/2011/Technology-and-social-networks/Part-3/SNS-users.aspx\" title=\"\">9% more close ties in their overall social network, on average, than those who don't</a>. Social media builds social capital, rather than degrading it: regular users of Facebook, LinkedIn and Twitter, one major survey last year concluded, <a href=\"http://www.pewinternet.org/Reports/2011/Technology-and-social-networks/Summary.aspx\" title=\"\">are 43% more likely to vote</a>. Even that chilling statistic about more Americans lacking a confidant now looks dubious: a new analysis by the sociologist <a href=\"http://www.bostonreview.net/BR37.3/claude_s_fischer_loneliness_facebook.php\" title=\"\">Claude&#xa0;Fischer</a> <a href=\"http://orgtheory.wordpress.com/2012/09/03/america-is-not-getting-lonlier/\" title=\"\">concluded that the finding arose because of a change in how the questions were asked</a>. There's little other evidence to suggest that more people are feeling lonelier. Which makes it tricky to maintain that the new modes of friendship are&#xa0;eroding friendship itself.</p> <p>None of this means that friendship isn't being transformed by social media, though. It's just that the problems aren't those of isolation \u2013 of the replacement of face\u2011to\u2011face contact with screen-gazing in darkened rooms \u2013 but those of scale. The anthropologist and evolutionary psychologist Robin Dunbar famously calculated \"<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2010/mar/14/my-bright-idea-robin-dunbar\" title=\"\">Dunbar's number</a>\" \u2013 the notion that the largest number of meaningful social relationships that any one person can maintain is somewhere around 150. Before the internet, we kept things manageable by natural attrition: if there were people you didn't want to see any more, then by and large you didn't see them. \"It's unnatural for us to drag all our past relationships with us into our future, as we do with Facebook,\" says Anjali Mullany, social media editor of <a href=\"http://www.fastcompany.com/\" title=\"\">Fast Company</a> and writer of its \"social media agony aunt\" column. \"That's not how things have worked, in terms of friendship, for thousands of years.\"</p> <p>Online networks have a tendency to obliterate the nuances between different kinds of relationships. Despite Facebook's lists, privacy settings and the rest, Mullany points out, \"ultimately, somebody is either your friend on Facebook or they're not. In real life, we're very political about our friendships, and I don't mean that in a bad way.\" There are friendships we'll let fade to nothing; others for which we'll put on a&#xa0;facade for a few hours at Christmas; or friendships of necessity, where we'll give the impression of intimacy without the reality. In contrast, \"Facebook essentially doesn't allow us to be political.\" Its founder, Mark Zuckerberg, makes no secret of his belief that everybody sharing everything with everybody else would be Facebook's ideal state. (The site's more nuanced levels of user control are provided, his statements imply, only as a grudging concession to old\u2011fashioned attitudes that will soon die out.) It's no coincidence, of course, that maximal sharing means maximally lucrative opportunities for advertising. But this flattening of relationships is unlike anything we've called \"friendship\" before.</p> <p>When Presser set out to meet her Facebook friends, one of the first things she discovered was that about two dozen of them had no intention of letting her visit, which certainly answered the question of what kind of friends they were. More revelations were in store. Some people proved overly demanding, such as the woman with whom she'd grown up and who had moved to a&#xa0;remote part of Turkey \u2013 she said Presser could visit so long as she brought her a Mac computer and a printer. When Presser offered to help her have the equipment shipped instead, she says, she found herself unfriended. Then there was the childhood acquaintance with whom, Presser realised, she'd stayed Facebook friends mainly to&#xa0;avoid giving the impression that she had a&#xa0;problem with his having undergone gender reassignment surgery to become a&#xa0;woman. But when they met, they still didn't get along: \"I&#xa0;didn't like her any more than I had done as a&#xa0;child.\" Another Facebook friend, whom she visited in Boston, seemed friendly enough: they went to a yoga class together and said warm goodbyes at the airport. Waiting for her flight, Presser blogged about the yoga class in a slightly facetious manner. \"By the time I got off the plane,\" she recalls, \"I'd been defriended and blocked.\"</p> <p>Presser is at pains to point out that her expedition, which she plans to use as the basis for a&#xa0;book, was a largely positive experience. In a&#xa0;remote corner of Alaska, she rekindled an old friendship; near Beachy Head, she was served a&#xa0;splendid Sunday dinner by people she'd never met; again and again, she was moved by the generosity of people \"who, after all, hadn't signed up to my resolution\". But her year of friend\u2011auditing was clarifying, too. The realisation that she didn't have much in common with certain Facebook \"friends\" meant they no longer needed to weigh on her mind; she could focus on the other ones instead.</p> <p>Not that it would be accurate to give the impression that Presser reduced her number of Facebook friends. Mentally, she had decluttered. But thanks to the publicity her quest attracted in the US media \u2013 and her seeming inability to decline new requests \u2013 her friend count stands at 5,000. Facebook won't let her add more.</p> <p>The more profound truth behind friend clutter may be that, as a general rule, we don't handle endings well. \"Our culture seems to applaud the spirit, promise and gumption of beginnings,\" writes the sociologist <a href=\"http://www.gse.harvard.edu/directory/faculty/faculty-detail/?fc=440&amp;flt=l&amp;sub=all\" title=\"\">Sara Lawrence-Lightfoot</a> in her absorbing new book, <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Exit-Endings-That-Free-Lawrence-Lightfoot/dp/B008LXBEG2/ref=sr_1_cc_2?s=aps&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1347362178&amp;sr=1-2-catcorr\" title=\"\">Exit: The Endings That Set Us Free</a>, whereas \"our exits are often ignored or invisible\". We celebrate the new \u2013 marriages, homes, work projects \u2013 but \"there is little appreciation or applause when we decide (or it is decided for us) that it's time to move on\". We need \"a language for leave-taking\", Lawrence-Lightfoot argues, and not just for funerals. A&#xa0;terminated friendship, after all, needn't necessarily signal a horrifying defeat, to be expunged from memory. One might just as easily think of it as \"completed\".</p> <p>Mullany recommends a friend-decluttering exercise that she admits sounds \"weird\", but that she predicts will become more and more widely accepted. She advises making a public proclamation on Facebook in which you specify the criteria by which you'll henceforth be defining people as \"friends\". Maybe you'll resolve only to remain Facebook friends with people you've met at least once in real life, or maybe you'll use a&#xa0;stricter standard, such as whether you'd invite that person to your wedding. Explain, in the same proclamation, that the consequent defriending shouldn't be taken personally, and that you're doing it to a number of people at once. Then start clearing out the clutter. Increasingly, Mullany argues, social media will force us to evaluate our friendships in this way \u2013 to take stock of our connections, so as to reserve our energies for those who matter most. She equates this to drawing up the guest list for a wedding: \"It's stressful but, for many people, making that list is a really important, meaningful moment.\"</p> <p>A person involved in the music industry whom I'll call Andrew \u2013 because telling you his real identity would defeat all his efforts to manage his online presence \u2013 recalls the moment he realised he'd need two Twitter profiles: one for his public existence and one for his actual friends. (The problem is somewhat different on Twitter, since followers don't need to be approved.) \"You forget that there's an audience,\" he says. \"I'd be saying something to a friend, and then someone I&#xa0;didn't know would chip in, furiously angry about what I'd&#xa0;said. I thought, 'I can't be fucking bothered with this.' It was like dragging a&#xa0;busload of people behind you wherever you went.\" Andrew left Facebook for similar reasons. \"Somebody I'd been at school with when I was 10 sent me a message to say, 'Are you still really into Adam And The Ants?' Of course I'm not. I'm in my 40s, and we knew each other when we were 10.\"</p> <p>If Zuckerberg's insistence that everyone should be friends with everyone prompts us, out of necessity, to winnow our lists to a smaller group of people we truly cherish, he'll have done something admirable, even if it's the opposite of what he intended.</p> <p>And what of Bierce, who was longing for a new convention of disintroductions as long ago as 1902? He handled his own exits unconventionally, to say the least. In 1913, at the age of 71, he took off for Mexico, telling friends he wanted to witness the revolution underway there. Some time later, he is supposed to have written, in a letter to a&#xa0;friend, \"I leave here tomorrow for an unknown destination\", though the letter has never been found. Then he vanished. There were rumours \u2013 one involved his execution by a Mexican firing squad \u2013 but nothing was ever confirmed. Gradually, it began to dawn on Bierce's friends that, one way or another, he'd disintroduced himself from them all.</p>",
  "<p>To Victor Moses, the images have a dream-like quality. The Nigeria winger had prayed since the beginning of July for the completion of his transfer from Wigan Athletic to Chelsea and there had come a point when he feared that it would not happen.</p> <p>But, in a whirlwind week at the end of August he signed for \u00a39m, was introduced to the Stamford Bridge crowd before the Newcastle United game, felt his eyes widen and his stomach flip during his first training session and then, the finale, watched the European Super Cup against Atl\u00e9tico Madrid as an unused substitute.</p> <p>Moses speaks in shy, hushed tones but they do not disguise the awe and excitement that he feels. His arrival at Chelsea marks a significant staging post in his quest to reach the game's summit, even if it pales in comparison to his broader journey from the depths of personal tragedy. His parents were murdered in Nigeria and Moses fled to England as an 11-year-old asylum seeker. He feels that they look down on him with pride.</p> <p>Moses's focus is on the future and the opportunities that he intends to grasp. He hopes to make his debut at some stage of the grudge fixture at Queens Park Rangers on Saturday, although to give it such billing feels crass in the light of what he has lived through.</p> <p>The 21-year-old bristles with quiet determination. He was Chelsea's final attack-minded signing of the summer, following Eden Hazard, Marko Marin and Oscar, who joined at a total cost of \u00a360m, and with Juan Mata and Ramires also vying for prominence in Roberto Di Matteo's line of three behind the main striker, the competition for places is ferocious.</p> <p>It is reasonable to wonder whether Moses, who was Wigan's main man last season and is becoming something similar for Nigeria, will enjoy the minutes that a talent like his wants and needs. He had no hesitation, though, in signing up for the challenge.</p> <p>\"I don't really know if it was Di Matteo or if it was the chairman or whoever but I knew that Chelsea were interested in me and that was it, really,\" Moses says. \"For a club to come and get you, they are going to use you at some stage. I know that there are a lot of players at Chelsea but if I do get my chance, I just have to grab it.\"</p> <p>Moses already has Chelsea stories to tell. He smiles when he recalls standing on a chair in Monaco, in the build-up to the Super Cup final, and being ordered to sing and dance for the amusement of his team-mates. The initiation routine for new recruits has become a feature at many clubs. \"I was nervous,\" Moses says. \"I thought: 'What am I going to sing?' because when I stood there, I literally didn't know what to sing.\"</p> <p>For the record and the grime fans out there, Moses \"kind of sang a Skepta song\". \"It's a little bit embarrassing,\" he says, \"\u2026 &#xa0;everyone watching me, thinking: 'What is he singing?' But it was all right.\"</p> <p>Moses has needed more than the occasional superlative of late. \"The first training session was unbelievable \u2026 seeing JT, Ashley Cole, Torres and people like that, it was incredible, kind of crazy,\" he says. \"And the Super Cup, when I was watching it, I was thinking to myself: 'I can't actually believe that I'm here.' I didn't get on but I still got a [runners-up] medal.\"</p> <p>Moses's appetite for precious metal, though, has been fired by a different encounter. \"I saw the Champions League trophy the other day, it was at the training ground,\" he says. \"Everyone was having their picture taken with it but not me. It was the players that played in the Champions League. I just walked away, although I did touch it. I thought to myself: 'Hopefully, we will win it again this year.'\"</p> <p>Moses's single-mindedness and strength of character is evident and it is easy to connect it with the manner in which he has coped with his childhood trauma. His father, Austin, was a Christian pastor in Kaduna, and his mother, Josephine, helped with his work.</p> <p>Violence, though, was depressingly familiar between the Muslim majority and the Christian minority and when riots erupted in 2002, Moses's parents, who were obvious but unflinching targets, were attacked in their home and killed. Moses was given the news as he played football in the street. He became a target, too, and, after being hidden by friends for a week, he was sent to England, where he was placed with foster parents in south London. Upon his arrival in the country, he knew nobody.</p> <p>\"Definitely, wherever they are at the moment, they should be proud of me, looking down being proud,\" Moses says of his parents. He is not ready to open up publicly about the bereavement and the gamut of emotions that he has run, but he does reflect on the work ethic that has guided him and been in place from the outset.</p> <p>\"It has been a long journey [from Nigeria] and I just want to keep strong and work hard for myself, whether it's football or not football,\" Moses says. \"I have to thank God for being where I am, it's like a dream come true and, if I keep working hard, who knows, I'll probably end up in Barcelona one day.\"</p> <p>Moses has fond memories of the street-football days in Nigeria \u2013 \"No boots, just in your bare feet, a little ball got chucked in and we started playing\" \u2013 and, also, the English after-school equivalent. He always wanted to be a professional footballer and he was spotted by Crystal Palace as he kicked a ball about in Norbury Park. They brought him into their academy and recommended him to Whitgift, the fee-paying school in Croydon where he could benefit from the superb facilities.</p> <p>He was a prodigy, utterly prolific in front of goal, a man among boys. He led the Whitgift under-14 team to the FA Youth Cup in 2005; they beat Grimsby school 5-0 in the final, with Moses scoring all five. Grimsby played in red shirts, which prompted the Grimsby Evening Telegraph into the first of many bible-based headlines for the player: \"Holy Moses \u2013 wonder player parts red sea.\"</p> <p>He made his Palace debut at 16 and was called up by England at every youth level. He won the Golden Boot at the European Under-17 Championship in 2007, in which England lost to Spain in the final, but his momentum was checked at Under-21 level. Stuart Pearce fielded him only once, against Uzbekistan in 2010, and the manager substituted him at half-time. Moses was not called up for the next game. \"I played for England Under-16s, 17s, 18s, 19s, 20s and then 21s \u2026 then \u2026 I just decided to make the decision to play for Nigeria,\" he says.</p> <p>Moses based the decision, in part, on where he felt full international opportunity would knock. He was conscious, he says, of the \"great players\" that England produce. \"Every year,\" he adds, \"you can see young players coming up and doing really well.\"</p> <p>His declaration for Nigeria has thrilled fans across Africa, where the Premier League is revered, although it did prompt Pearce into a hurried phone call to ask him what he was doing. Moses has his eyes on the Africa Cup of Nations that takes place in South Africa from 19 January-10 February next year, at which Nigeria will compete if they can see off Liberia in the second leg of the final qualifying round. They drew the first leg 2-2 in Liberia last Saturday, with Moses setting up both of his team's goals. The return is in Calabar on 12 October.</p> <p>\"When I got to Nigeria [last week], everyone seemed to support Chelsea,\" Moses says. \"It was a good experience to see Chelsea fans in Nigeria, screaming my name and stuff. When I got to Liberia as well, it was the same thing. They watch the Premier League everywhere in Africa.\"</p> <p>The topsy-turvy nature of Moses's recent existence is epitomised by his having played more matches this season against his current employer than for them. He completed the 90 minutes for Wigan against Chelsea on the opening weekend, which was a test of his professionalism, particularly as he says he knew Chelsea had made a bid for him before the kick-off. \"Wigan must have rejected it,\" he says. They rejected four bids in total, starting with \u00a33.5m in early July.</p> <p>Moses is desperate to impress and he says that he has no preference about where he plays. \"I feel comfortable anywhere up front,\" he says. \"Left wing, right wing, behind the striker. I thought that the transfer wasn't going to happen because it did drag on a bit but I'm delighted that everything is sorted. I just want to enjoy myself and play football.\"</p> <p><em>Victor Moses spoke at the launch of Battlefield 3 Premium Edition, which is out now in the UK for Xbox 360, PlayStation 3 and PC</em></p>",

  "<p>Two days isn't nearly enough time to get to grips with the current Liverpool Biennial, which opens on Saturday.</p> <p>I hurried through the John Moores Painting Prize exhibition, now in its 50th year. Very little rubbed off on me. Lost in the exhibition City States, which takes us from Birmingham to Gdansk, from Greenland to Taipei, and occupies a vast acreage of Liverpool's former postal sorting office, I could have been anywhere. Here I spent about half an hour circumnavigating a humongous inflatable black pillow, wedged between floor and ceiling, by a collective from Vilnius. The bloated black form might signify the big sleep.</p> <p>Around a corner are versions of Morris Louis's 1960's drip-and-pour paintings, executed, inexplicably, by North Korean weavers. Why, you ask. The answer is very long indeed.</p> <p>Every few hours, I slipped down to the waterfront, to check if Anthony McCall's much anticipated column of cloud had yet ascended across the Mersey. Wind and weather and technical glitches have meant that this, the most spectacular of the biennial's works, has yet to take off. Of such mysteries and expectations biennials are made, from Liverpool to Sydney.</p> <p>Since its inception in 1999, the Liverpool Biennial has itself struggled to take off. Under the new artistic directorship of Sally Tallant, it is trying to refocus. The overall theme, hospitality, is more complex than it sounds, though whether it helps us cross and recross the city in search of its roster of 242 artists in 27 locations, is moot.</p> <p>Better to sit in a room and think. But not perhaps in Finnish artist Markus K\u00e5hre's fake hotel suite, on the 1st floor of the Monro pub. Everything, from the table lamps to the windows, walls and doors, is a perfect simulacrum, fabricated by the artist. We take it all as real, until we look in the mirrors on the wall, which reflect everything except ourselves. This is disturbing and uncanny, unless you happen to be a vampire or a ghost. Even the daylight is fake.</p> <p>K\u00e5hre's work is perfectly in tune with the title of the biennial's main exhibition, The Unexpected Guest. In art, we are used to expecting the unexpected, though genuine surprise is rare. Biennial after biennial, the same fashionable names with their familiar stratagems appear. Here comes Dora Garcia, who's always everywhere, there goes Argentinian Jorge Macchi, who \"questions our ability to locate ourselves in space\", by way of bent iron bars, which intend to simulate the effects of refraction in water. It doesn't work. I much prefer the games room set up by Pedro Reyes at FACT. Somehow, I ended up playing a sexed-up version of snakes and ladders with the Mexican cultural attach\u00e9, while small children milled about, whacking each other in a pillow fight.</p> <p>Sometimes I felt less a guest, more an ingrate, especially as I queued to get into the non-existent nightclub behind Elmgreen and Dragset's freestanding VIP door in the Liverpool ONE shopping precinct. A genial but unmovable doorman tells anyone who asks that they're not on the guestlist.</p> <p>There are plenty of such lighthearted works here, from the multi-coloured plastic pigeons roosting at the entrance to the Walker Art Gallery (a work that rips-off Maurizio Cattelan's stuffed pigeons that have been in at least two Venice Biennales), to Superflex's Liverpool To Let, a bunting of estate agents' signage, which festoons part of the enormous ground floor space of the Cunard Building, which few artists occupy with any real presence.</p> <p>Althea Thauberger's video staging of Peter Weiss's 1963 play Marat/Sade, and Sylvie Blocher's video reworkings of speeches by the likes of Angela Davis and Karl Marx, had a real spring and surprise. Marx has never sounded so good as declaimed by a semi-clothed Russian punk rapper.</p> <p>We are less guests than voyeurs to Japanese photographer Kohei Yoshiyuki's famous but rarely seen The Park, at the Open Eye Gallery. These 1970s images of public sex in a Tokyo park, at night, are more funny than salacious, and shown in a blacked-out room. You search for the images with a torch, and become one with the furtive spectators spying on all the goings-on.</p> <p>People like to watch, and others like to be watched, and some like to listen. Doug Aitken's The Source, in a building especially designed by David Adjaye, presents a series of interviews with major creative figures about the sources of their creativity. The sound levels are too low and the videos are screened simultaneously about the circular space. It is almost impossible to concentrate on William Eggleston's ruminative mumble, or to focus on Mike Kelley in probably his last interview before his suicide earlier this year. The interviews are great, but Aiken has turned them into a sort of cocktail party babble.</p> <p>The best work in the biennial is undoubtedly John Akomfrah's The Unfinished Conversation, a three-screen video based on the life, work and talk of the incomparable Jamaican-born thinker Stuart Hall, at the Bluecoat Gallery. Much more than biopic, Akomfrah juxtaposes archive news footage, readings of William Blake, Dickens and Virginia Woolf and most of all Hall's own voice, to describe the world's tumbling. Hall's thoughts about identity, immigration and selfhood, evolve through a roar of telling images. Akomfrah's film, like the essence of Hall's work, is about the conundrum of being in the world, and is as unexpected as it is brilliant.</p>",
  "<p>In Jamaica <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/12/clover-graham-obituary\" title=\"\">Clover Graham</a> was the eyes and ears of the United Nations refugee agency. As honorary liaison for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), her passion for justice and human rights filled a needed gap in the legal infrastructure in Jamaica. She not only advocated for and counseled asylum seekers, assisted with refugee status and resettlement procedures but she also kept tabs on how refugee families were doing and helped instill a sense of safety and community.</p> <p>\"To all who knew her, Clover was a selfless humanitarian, a passionate human rights activist, a leader who constantly inspired others to take action, combining her legal expertise and intellectual depth with human kindness,\" wrote the high commissioner for refugees, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, in an all staff announcement about <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-19338826\" title=\"\">Clover's murder</a> last month.</p> <p>Before her untimely death on August 18th, Clover was a dedicated law professor who contributed to the development of the legal aid system in Jamaica. From her days with Brixton Black Women's Centre to her work with refugees, Clover never gave up advocating for those in need of legal assistance.</p> <p>From 1998 Clover worked on behalf of UNHCR with a group of Haitian refugees who fled political violence associated with the coup d'etat that ousted President Aristide in 1991 and his return to power in 1994. Like all refugees, they feared for their lives and sought safety on the shores of Jamaica. Clover worked with the authorities to make refuge possible. At the time of her murder, she was in the process of advocating for the naturalisation of over a dozen Haitian refugees.</p> <p>Clover made it her personal mission to ensure no refugee or asylum seeker was left without protection. This is how she met a former child soldier from Sierra Leone. Clover advocated that this young refugee be moved from Trinidad to Kingston, Jamaica, so he could pursue his musical education. Like so many people Clover assisted, she welcomed him into her extended family.</p> <p>In 2007 Clover's son, Taiwo, and his girlfriend were murdered. Shortly following this horrible loss Clover continued her dedicated and inspired work with UNHCR finding solace in seeking justice for refugees. Clover was also a UK citizen and could have lived a more comfortable life but she stood by her country with its grand beauty and devastating weaknesses.</p> <p>According to the <a href=\"http://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/data-and-analysis/homicide.html\" title=\"\">UN Office on Drugs and Crime</a>, Jamaica has the highest murder rate in the Caribbean. In 2011, of the thousands of murders in Jamaica, 1125 were reported, and few led to sentencing. In the report, <a href=\"http://www.genevadeclaration.org/measurability/global-burden-of-armed-violence/global-burden-of-armed-violence-2011.html\" title=\"\">Global Burden of Armed Violence: Lethal Encounters</a>, Jamaica is ranked third in countries most affected by violence, behind El Salvador and Iraq. In spite of these terrifying statistics, Clover pursued justice with a single-edged sword working tirelessly for vulnerable refugees and fellow citizens by providing legal aid and basic assistance \u2014 often from her own pocket.</p> <p>In one of the last correspondence our office received from Clover in June, she sent us an article about the men convicted of the murders of her son Taiwo and his girlfriend. The email was titled \"Finally\" and you could sense that Clover was finally at peace after a four year battle she fought to have some of the perpetrators prosecuted. Clover was one of the few voices that rose above and demanded justice for their deaths. She was a courageous person. Following her death, UNHCR is now among the chorus of voices that have taken up Clover's cause and continue to urge the authorities to do everything they can to bring the perpetrators of her murder to justice.</p> <p>While in Jamaica last week we were pleased to learn that the authorities are trying to identify the perpetrators, and that this murder, as well as many others affecting the Jamaican society, will not go unpunished. We hope that as the spotlight turns away from her death to competing demands that the authorities spare no effort until justice is done.</p>",
  "<p>A madness is taking hold. In the same week as Arctic ice cover is <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/sep/14/arctic-sea-ice-smallest-extent?intcmp=122\" title=\"\">recorded at its lowest ever extent</a>, two major countries decide to reduce or eliminate their use of the only proven source of low-carbon power that can be deployed at sufficient scale to tackle our climate crisis. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/14/japan-end-nuclear-power\" title=\"\">Japan plans to phase out nuclear entirely by 2030</a>, its prime minister announced today. The French president has just revealed a plan to dramatically reduce the country's reliance on nuclear, which currently gives France some of the cleanest electricity in the world.</p> <p>Let me be very clear. Without nuclear, the battle against global warming is as good as lost. Even many greens now admit this in private moments. We are already witnessing the first signs of the collapse in the biosphere this entails \u2013 with the Arctic in full-scale meltdown, more solar radiation is being captured by the dark ocean surface, and the weather systems of the entire northern hemisphere are being thrown into chaos. With nuclear, there is a chance that global warming this century can be limited to 2C; without nuclear, I would guess we are heading for 4C or above. That will devastate ecosystems and societies worldwide on a scale which is unimaginable.</p> <p>Given the trauma the Japanese people have suffered since the earthquake and tsunami of 11 March 2011, it is understandable that major questions are asked of domestic politicians. But we must never forget that Fukushima has killed no one. More people in Japan recently died from an <em>E coli</em> outbreak due to eating contaminated pickles. Scientists also agree there will never be an observable cancer increase in the Japanese population attributable to Fukushima.</p> <p>But in response to the nuclear shutdown, oil and gas imports to Japan have doubled, and carbon dioxide emissions soared by more than 60m tonnes. Any environmentalist who celebrates this outcome is not worthy of the name.</p> <p>Japan is already backing away from its own climate change targets. As a participant in the UN climate negotiations last year, I watched this happen. Under the 2009 Copenhagen accord, Japan pledged to reduce CO<sub>2</sub> emissions by 25% by 2020. The plan was to increase nuclear to half of national electricity in order to facilitate the carbon cuts, supported by an increase in renewables to 20% by 2030. To reach the same targets without nuclear is impossible; wind and solar combined meet barely 1% of electricity production today in Japan, and there is no way they can be deployed at sufficient scale to meet the gap. So the climate targets will be dropped, as Japan re-carbonises its economy.</p> <p>It is nothing short of insane that politicians around the world, under pressure from populations subjected to decades of anti-nuclear fearmongering by people who call themselves greens, are raising our collective risk of catastrophic climate change in order to eliminate the safest power source ever invented.</p> <p>More people die each day from coal pollution than have been killed by nuclear power in 50 years of operation, and that is even before factoring in the impact on global warming. That such populist irrationality should guide public policy in so many countries \u2013 and on such an important issue as energy \u2013 is nothing short of a disaster.</p> <p>All is not yet lost. 2030 is a long way away, and as Japan watches its heavy industry shut down and relocate offshore due to rising energy costs and supply shortages, there may be a rethink. France may decide to keep its nuclear stations as it watches Germany's much vaunted dash for solar dissolve in a cloud of coal smoke. But ultimately energy policy must be responsive to public opinion, and as long as people across the world get it so wrong on nuclear risk and continue to ignore the real and rising risks of climate change, the planet is in very serious trouble.</p>",
  "<p>Sea ice in the Arctic has shrunk to its smallest extent ever recorded, smashing the previous record minimum and prompting warnings of accelerated climate change.</p> <p>Satellite images show that the rapid summer melt has reduced the area of frozen sea to <a href=\"http://\" title=\"\">less than 3.5 million square kilometres this week</a> \u2013 less than half the area typically occupied four decades ago.</p> <p>Arctic sea ice cover has been shrinking since the 1970s when it averaged around 8m sq km a year, but such a dramatic collapse in ice cover in one year is highly unusual.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2007/sep/04/climatechange\" title=\"\">A record low in 2007</a> of 4.17m sq km <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/aug/27/arctic-sea-ice-shrinks-lowest-extent\" title=\"\">was broken on 27 August 2012</a>; further melting has since amounted to more than 500,000 sq km.</p> <p>The record, which is based on a five-day average, is expected to be officially declared in the next few days by the <a href=\"http://\" title=\"\">National Snow and Ice Data Centre</a> in Colorado.

This is an indication that the Arctic sea ice cover is fundamentally changing. The trends all show less ice and thinner ice,\" said Julienne Stroeve, a research scientist with the NSIDC.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396182754\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Environment/Pix/pictures/2012/9/14/1347636881754/Arctic-sea-ice-loss-001.jpg\" alt=\"Arctic sea ice loss\" width=\"460\" height=\"400\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Arctic sea ice loss  Photograph: guardian.co.uk</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: guardian.co.uk</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The shrinking of the ice cap was interpreted by environment groups as a signal of long-term global warming caused by man-made greenhouse gas emissions. A <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/jul/26/arctic-climate-change\" title=\"\">study published in July in the journal Environmental Research Letters</a>, that compared model projections with observations, estimated that the radical decline in Arctic sea ice has been between 70-95% due to human activities.</p> <p>\"We are on the edge of one of the most significant moments in environmental history as sea ice heads towards a new record low. The loss of sea ice will be devastating, raising global temperatures that will impact on our ability to grow food and causing extreme weather around the world,\" said John Sauven, director of Greenpeace UK.</p> <p>Sea ice experts on Friday said they were surprised by the collapse because weather conditions were not especially conducive to a major melt this year. The ice is now believed to be much thinner than it used to be and easier to melt.</p> <p>Arctic sea ice follows an annual cycle of melting through the warm summer months and refreezing in the winter. The sea ice plays a critical role in regulating climate, acting as a giant mirror that reflects much of the Sun's energy, helping to cool the Earth.</p> <p>David Nussbaum, chief executive of WWF-UK, said: \"The disappearance of Arctic ice is the most visible warning sign of the need to tackle climate change and ensure we have a world fit to pass on to the next generation. The sheer scale of ice loss is shocking and unprecedented. This alarm call from the Arctic needs to reverberate across Whitehall and boardrooms. We can all take action to cut carbon emissions and move towards a 100% renewable economy.\"</p> <p>Ed Davey, the UK climate and energy secretary, said: \"These findings highlight the urgency for the international community to act. We understand that Arctic sea-ice decline has accelerated over recent years as global warming continues to increase Arctic temperatures at a faster rate than the global average.</p> <p>\"This Government is working hard to tackle climate change and we are working closely with our international partners not to exceed 2 degrees above pre industrial levels. I am calling for the EU to increase its emission target from 20% to 30% and will be taking an active lead at the UNFCCC Climate change talks in Doha later this year, where I will push for further progress towards a new global deal on climate change and for more mitigation action now.

  "<p>Our planet is waving the white flag of surrender. But as the polar flag becomes ever more tattered, with holes scorched by hotter ocean waters, humanity pumps ever more globe-warming gases into the air.</p> <p>The story of the Arctic ice cap is the story of modern environmentalism. In 1968, as satellites began to document the vast ice field blanketing the north pole, the iconic <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earthrise\">Earthrise image</a> was beamed back to the ground. It revealed a planet of awesome beauty, deep blue oceans, verdant continents and crowned with at least 8m square kilometres of gleaming ice. The image kickstarted the global green movement. </p> <p>In 2007, a <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2007/sep/04/climatechange\">new record was set</a> for the minimum summer sea ice cover in the Arctic had halved. This furious flag waving attracted attention. That year, the world's scientists declared the end of any doubt that our addiction to burning fossil fuels was changing the face of the planet. Al Gore expounded his inconvenient truth and the world seemed set to act.</p> <p>Today, that <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/sep/14/arctic-sea-ice-smallest-extent\">2007 record is smashed</a> and the shredded white flag is now flickering rathering than flashing. But the danger is greater than even, even if the alarm signal is frayed.</p> <p>The last great global ice melt the planet witnessed came 11,700 years ago at the end of a deep ice age. As glaciers retreated, a benign and balmy climate emerged in which the human race has flourished. Our entire civilisation is built on the warm soils left as the ice sheets melted.</p> <p>This new great melting heralds the polar opposite: the gravest of threats to civilisation. Removing the lid from the pole will release heat equivalent to <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/sep/14/decline-sea-ice-arctic\">fast-forwarding human-caused climate change by two decades</a>, say scientists. </p> <p>Will this be the first great <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tipping_point_%28climatology%29\">tipping point</a> to tumble the world into a new and hostile climate regime, as the cooling, reflective ice vanishes? Will the new, warm Arctic radically alter the temperate weather enjoyed by Europeans, for whom global warming has seemed a distant concern?</p> <p>We seem to be <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2011/may/29/carbon-emissions-nuclearpower\">prepared to take that chance</a>. The shrinking ice has not opened new leads for decisive global action to tackle climate change. Instead, in a vicious irony, the new channels are being exploited for oil and gas exploration, unearthing more of the very fuels driving the warming.</p> <p>Decades from now, will today's record sea ice low be seen as the moment when our Earthly paradise gave up the ghost and entered a hellish new era? I sincerely hope not, but with this global distress signal failing to attract attention, I fear the worst.</p> <p><em>\u2022 You can add your <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/blog/2012/sep/14/sea-ice-climate-change\">comments on our live blog</a></em></p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 27 September 2012.

  "<p>We are a few hundred miles from the north pole. The air temperature is -3C, the sea freezing. All around us in these foggy Arctic waters at the top of the world are floes \u2013 large and small chunks of sea ice that melt and freeze again with the seasons.</p> <p>Arne Sorensen, our Danish ice pilot, is 60 feet up in the crow's nest of the Arctic Sunrise vessel. Visibility is just 200 yards and he inches the 1,000-tonne Greenpeace ice breaker forward at two knots through narrow passages of clear water. The floes are piled up and compressed in fantastic shapes and shades of grey and blue; they crack, rumble and groan as we nudge them aside or climb over them. Two polar bears on our port side lift their heads but resume hunting.</p> <p>Sorensen has sailed deep into ice at both poles for 30 years, but this voyage is different, he says. The edge of the Arctic ice cap is usually far south of where we are now at the very end of the melt season. More than 600,000 square kilometres (sq km) more ice <a href=\"http://nsidc.org/arcticseaicenews/2012/09/arctic-sea-ice-falls-below-4-million-square-kilometers/\" title=\"\">has melted in 2012 than was ever recorded by satellites before</a>. Now the minimum extent has been nearly reached and the sea is starting to refreeze.</p> <p>\"This is the new minimum extent of the ice cap,\" he says, the \"frontline of climate change\".</p> <p>\"It is sad. I am not doubting this is related to emitting fossil fuels to a large extent. It's sad to observe that we are capable of changing the planet to such a degree.\"</p> <p>The vast polar ice cap, which regulates the Earth's temperature and has been a permanent fixture in our understanding of how the world works, has this year retreated further and faster than anyone expected. The previous record, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2007/sep/04/climatechange\" title=\"\">set in 2007</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/aug/27/arctic-sea-ice-shrinks-lowest-extent\" title=\"\">was officially broken on 27 August</a> when satellite images averaged over five days showed the ice then extended 4.11 million sq km, a reduction of nearly 50% compared to just 40 years ago.</p> <p>But since 27 August, the ice just kept melting \u2013 at nearly 40,000 sq km a day until a few days ago. Satellite pictures this weekend showed the cap covering only 3.49m sq km. This year, 11.7m sq km of ice melted, 22% more than the long-term average of 9.18m sq km. The record minimum extent is now likely to be formally called on Monday by the US National Snow and Ice Data Centre (NSIDC) in Colorado.</p> <p>The record hasn't just been broken, it's been smashed to smithereens, adding weight to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/oct/15/arctic-survey-ice-melting\" title=\"\">predictions that the Arctic may be ice-free in summer months within 20 years</a>, say British, Italian and American-based scientists on board the Arctic Sunrise. They are shocked at the speed and extent of the ice loss.</p> <p>The Cambridge University Sea ice researcher Nick Toberg, who has analysed underwater ice thickness data collected by British nuclear submarine HMS Tireless in 2004 and 2007, said: \"This is staggering. It's disturbing, scary that we have physically changed the face of the planet. We have about 4m sq km of sea ice. If that goes in the summer months that's about the same as adding 20 years of CO<sub>2</sub> at current [human-caused] rates into the atmosphere. That's how vital the arctic sea ice is.</p> <p>\"In the 1970s we had 8m sq km of sea ice. That has been halved. We need it in the summer. It has never decreased like this before\".</p> <p>\"We knew the ice was getting thinner but I did not expect we'd lose this much this year. We broke the record by a lot\", says the NSIDC scientist <a href=\"http://nsidc.org/research/bios/stroeve.html\" title=\"\">Julienne Stroeve</a>.</p> <p>\"The acceleration of the loss of the extent of the ice is mostly because the ice has been so thin. This would explain why it has melted so much this year. By June the ice edge had pulled back to where it normally is in September,\" she says.</p> <p>\"The 2007 record was set when you had weather conditions which were perfect for melting. This year we didn't have those. It was mixed. So this suggests the ice has got to a point where it's so thin it doesn't matter what the weather is, it's going to melt in the summer. This could become the new normal,\" says Stroeve.</p> <p>In the past Stroeve has shown that ice melt has been happening far faster than the models predicted. Her new research, <a href=\"http://www.agu.org/pubs/crossref/2012/2012GL052676.shtml\" title=\"\">published last month</a> in the journal Geophysical Research Papers, shows humans may have been responsible for most of the ice loss in recent decades.</p> <p>\"It suggests 60% of the observed decline in ice extent in Septembers from 1953-2011 was due to human activity. The decline is linked to the increase in temperatures,\" she says.</p> <p>\"This year is significant. At the moment the [ice extent] is below what the next Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report will show in 2014. We are on the extreme edge of the models, suggesting that ice loss is happening much faster than the models suggested,\" says Stroeve.</p> <p>All over the Arctic the effects of accelerating ice loss and a warming atmosphere are being seen. The ecology is changing rapidly as trees and plants move north, new beetles devastate whole forests in Canada, Siberia and Alaska, and snowfall increases. Inuit and other communities report more avalanches, the erosion of sea cliffs and melting of the permafrost affecting roads and buildings. Whole coastal communities may have to be moved to avoid sea erosion.</p> <p>With the ice loss has come <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/jul/05/oil-supplies-arctic\" title=\"\">a rush by industry for Arctic resources</a>. Oil, gas, mining and shipping companies are all expanding operations into areas that until only 20 years ago would have been physically impossible. They bring new opportunities for trade, but new threats to the environment. On Monday, a historic first drilling operation by Shell in the Chukchi Sea off Alaska <a href=\"http://www.adn.com/2012/09/10/2619205/shell-halts-chukchi-sea-drilling.html\" title=\"\">was halted after sea ice was seen moving towards the oil company's drill ship</a>.</p> <p>Other new research suggests that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/mar/14/met-office-arctic-sea-ice-loss-winter\" title=\"\">the loss of ice could be could be affecting the path and speed of the jet streams</a>, possibly explaining why extreme weather in the northern hemisphere is lasting longer.</p> <p>\"There is evidence of stronger and more intense north Atlantic storms and extreme weather, says Stroeve. \"We are thinking we are entering a new climate state. Until we get the next push and reach a new equilibrium.\"</p> <p>From now on until June, the Arctic sea ice will refreeze. First it will be glassy, thin \"shuga\", \"grease\" or \"pancake\" ice, unable to bind the floes together. But within weeks, the whole icecap will visibly reform, growing up to 100,000 sq km a day until the melt season begins again next year.</p> <p>But, says Toberg, because of the massive melt this year, there will be less old, or multiyear, ice which is thicker and less prone to melting. The new ice formed this winter will be weaker and more vulnerable to melt, hastening the loss of ice next year. \"It is preconditioned to melt\", he says.</p> <p>Now, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/jan/05/climate-change-feedback-loops\" title=\"\">\"feedbacks\"</a> are thought to be hastening the ice retreat. In recent summers, say ice experts, Arctic sea surface temperatures have been well above normal, partly because there is less ice to reflect heat back into the atmosphere. The darker open waters now absorb more solar radiation, accelerating the melt.</p> <p>\"The ice is weak so it opens up water and allows more sunlight in which warms the water more which makes the ice break up more \u2013 so it accelerates the melt. There is hardly any old, multi-year ice left, so first year ice is now dominant. We are seeing less and less old thick ice,\" says Toberg.</p> <p>The longer term implications of the great melt of 2012 are hard to call, say climate scientists who caution that more research is needed. Sea ice plays a critical role in regulating climate, acting as a giant mirror that reflects much of the sun's energy, helping to cool the Earth.</p> <p>What is suspected is that the formation of the sea ice produces dense salt water which sinks, helping drive the deep ocean currents. Without the summer sea ice, many scientists fear this balance could be upset, potentially causing major climatic changes.</p> <p>\"The Arctic ice cover is a lid on the planet that regulates the temperature. By taking it off you are warming it. Temperatures [everywhere] depend on it,\" says Toberg.</p> <p>Sea ice extent has varied naturally over the decades with some Russian data suggesting similar or even greater ice loss in some local areas in the 1930s. But the models are clear, says Stroeve. If you omit the observed records, keeping CO<sub>2</sub> levels at pre-industrial levels, then none show a decline of ice cover. When you do put CO<sub>2</sub> into the models, they all show a decline, she says.</p> <p>\"Just because there was possibly less ice in some areas at other times, that doesn't mean it's not human-induced now\".</p> <p>\"We can expect the Arctic to be ice-free in summer within 20 years, she says. \"The ice won't go away the whole year. It will still be cold enough in the Arctic to freeze in winter. But by 2030 I'd say we will have an ice-free summer Arctic. That does not mean that natural ice variability cannot bring it back again, but the trend, we think, will be downward.\"</p> <p>\"This is a defining moment in human history,\" said Kumi Naidoo, director of Greenpeace International in Amsterdam. \"In just over 30 years we have altered the way our planet looks from space and soon the north pole may be completely ice-free in summer.</p> <p>\"Fossil fuel companies are still making profits despite the fact that climate change is so clearly upon us. Our politicians are putting corporate interests above scientific warnings and failing in their duties to the public\".</p>",

Conservationists attribute the penguins' decline to food shortages, both because of use of large amounts of fish caught commercially and the eastward shift of their main food sources of anchovy and sardines.

  "<p>Ready for your close up? A new era begins on Saturday as NBC broadcast the first network television MLS game, and seeing as it's <strong>Portland Timbers</strong> hosting <strong>Seattle Sounders</strong>, it should do the league proud, spectacle-wise. There's also a Cascadia Cup at stake for a Timbers side with precious little else at stake this season, while Seattle will be trying to stay on the heels of a <strong>San Jose</strong> team facing a very winnable trip to <strong>Chivas USA</strong> later that evening.</p> <p>The third member of the Cascadia triumvirate, <strong>Vancouver Whitecaps</strong>, are struggling to get over the play-off line, but could do themselves a lot of favors by beating <strong>Dallas</strong>, while over in the other conference, <strong>Chicago Fire</strong> could do themselves and some of their Eastern rivals a favor by beating <strong>Montreal Impact</strong>. </p> <p>Most of the intriguing clashes are in the East this week. On Friday night, leaders <strong>Sporting KC</strong> host a <strong>Houston Dynamo</strong> side who edged them in last year's conference final, while behind them N<strong>ew York Red Bulls </strong>face a tricky tie against <strong>Columbus Crew</strong> - still the side most likely to crash the play-off party despite their surprise loss to New England last week. <strong>New England</strong> travel to <strong>DC United</strong> on Saturday evening - the first of a series of games that the DC faithful will see as key to stabilizing their faltering play-off charge. </p> <p>One side for whom the play-off race is finally, officially, mathematically over is <strong>Toronto FC</strong>. They're hosting a <strong>Philadelphia Union</strong> side who may not yet technically be in the same boat, but are surely playing for pride at this point. Ditto <strong>Colorado Rapids</strong>, who must travel to the Home Depot Center on Friday night to face an <strong>LA Galaxy</strong> side, who may find it hard to empathize with their struggles - even given their own early season travails. The champions are making their run for play off position and looking comfortable.</p> <p>Also looking comfortable - our cast of fan reps, bloggers, beat writers, podcasters and assorted ne'er do wells, who had a weekend off for the international break, but were rudely interrupted by the excited squawks of the Guardian carrier pigeons outside their executive boxes, demanding game previews for the resumption of MLS hostilities. You can see their game previews below, then have your say in our comments section.</p> <p><em>All kick off times are EST</em></p> <h2>Sporting KC vs Houston Dynamo, Fri 8.30pm (NBCSN)</h2> <p><strong>Malena Barajas</strong>, co-founder, <a href=\"http://womenunitedfc.com/\">Women United FC</a>, Sporting Kansas City:</p> <p>This Friday night, Sporting KC looks to extend its four-point lead in the East Conference against fourth place Houston Dynamo. In SKC's last match nearly two weeks ago, the team came back with a 2-1 win over bottom-of-the-table Toronto FC \u2013 a match not expected to be close, but earning SKC it's fifteenth regular season win. SKC will need to win Friday to match its 2000 regular season win record (16 wins) and to keep on the heels of the San Jose Earthquakes on the race to the Supporter's Shield.</p> <p>Graham Zusi, who played exceptionally well in the second leg of the USMNT's World Cup Qualifiers against Jamaica, and Kei Kamara, return from national duty. No doubt many will watch if Zusi's form will carry into the match against Houston. Houston had four players on international duty \u2013 two with Jamaica \u2013 and all will be available Friday. Thankfully, midfielder Jacob Peterson has recovered from a shoulder injury, and will be available for this match. Don't count on him playing 90 minutes, though. Defender Aurelien Collin will also be back after serving a game suspension as a result of a red card.</p> <p>This is the third meeting between Sporting KC and Houston Dynamo this season. Sporting KC's record is a draw at home and a loss away. In both those matches, Sporting out-shot Houston. In the loss, Sporting played a man short after Peterson was ejected in the 47th minute. Look for Sporting KC to be aggressive on the attack.</p> <p><strong>Zach Woosley</strong>, <a href=\"http://www.dynamotheory.com/\">Dynamo Theory</a>, Houston:</p> <p>The Dynamo won! It wasn't pretty, but it was the last game of a tough stretch that included the added hurdle of missing three starters and a key sub to international duty. It took a stoppage time penalty that capped off a night of really questionable officiating (bad officiating in MLS? WELL I NEVER!) and a lot of frustration, but it was a win and three huge points for Houston. </p> <p>At last the roster is back together and everyone has had a little time to breath, well except for the guys on international duty. Houston needed this after a roller coaster adventure through August and early September, so now there's the chance to refocus and get ready to for the playoff run. This weekend's match against Sporting KC is a big one. This is a team you'll need to beat in the playoffs and if you really want to improve your chances, beat now to try to get ahead of them in the standings. Look trips to KC are never easy but the Dynamo know how to get results there. I think they'll be able to get at least a draw and that would be just fine by me.</p> <h2>LA Galaxy vs Colorado Rapids, Fri 11pm (Univision)</h2> <p><strong>Josie Becker</strong>, Editor, <a href=\"http://www.lagconfidential.com\">LAG Confidential</a>, Los Angeles:</p> <p>The Galaxy form has been much improved as of late, goals are coming fast and furious and the defense has improved tenfold since Omar Gonzalez returned to the club. His emergence with the removal of David Junior Lopes has the Galaxy back line back to where it was last year; keeping clean sheets. The offense has kept up it's hot streak, even with Landon Donovan nursing a knock he picked up in Mexico City. David Beckham and Juninho have stepped up big in the midfield, taking some of the pressure off Robbie Keane up top to create by himself. </p> <p>This weekend the Galaxy host Colorado Rapids, who aren't making the playoffs which means they're playing for pride. That can easily be a trap game, but with the team playing well without Donovan, and the possibility of Landon Donovan and Christian Wilhelmsson coming off the bench (I doubt either of them start) the Galaxy should be able to sustain at least two strong waves (one to start and one after the subs) that Colorado will just have to pray through. So long as the Galaxy aren't looking ahead to the match in Puerto Rico, LA should be able to dust Colorado with relative ease. </p> <p><strong>Richard Bamber</strong>, COO, <a href=\"http://www.bulldogsupporters.com\">Bulldog Supporters Group</a>, Colorado Rapids:</p> <p>The Rapids were last in action in a home and home series against Portland Timbers. In the first game, despite an assured debut from new signing Hendry Thomas in midfield and Matt Pickens winning save of the week, the Rapids left the Rose City empty-handed, going down 1-0. Therefore it was vitally important we got back to winning ways in the rematch at Dicks Sporting Goods Park 5 days later. This the Rapids did in fine style with a thumping 3-0 win which sent the Rapids fans into the international break full of hope that the poor run of results is finally over.</p> <p>Tonight we head to California to face the Galaxy in a game we must win if we are to keep our slim play off hopes alive. Despite their league position the MLS champions are not a bad team and it will be a very very tough game. One notable absentee will be Wells Thompson, who many Rapids fans will remember marking David Beckham out of the game two years ago. Wells was traded to Chicago earlier in the week and his departure marks the loss of another key member of the 2010 team - the&#xa0;so-called \"thugs\" who won MLS Cup.</p> <h2>Toronto FC vs Philadelphia Union. Sat 1pm (TSN, RDS)</h2> <p><strong>Sonja Missio</strong>, <a href=\"http://www.90minutesofhopp.com\">90 Minutes of Hopp</a>, Toronto:</p> <p>BMO Field was a different atmosphere on Wednesday night than from the last time two soccer teams played there. Granted, the last match was a World Cup Qualifier, but speak to anyone who attended that game, and they will tell you that it was the best atmosphere BMO has had all year. Especially compared to Wednesday, when the only fanfare before the 79th minute goal was in the traditional 24th, when BMO rang with Danny Dichio's name. However, instead of sounding like a rally, it sounded more like a taunt; a bittersweet reminder of the once enthusiastic fans, who are now outnumbered by empty red bucket seats.<br> Simply put, on Wednesday night, Chicago played better. It was no surprise, Toronto has had more injured players than winning games this season and a game so close to an international break was bound to leave some holes. The first Chicago goal was scored in the 13th minute and the follow up right before the half, which was unfortunate, as it came right after a massive save from new-father-of-triplets, Milos Kocic. However, it wasn't all bad; Eric Hassli provided Toronto with their only goal, which woke up a sleepy BMO. With the loss officially eliminating TFC from playoffs, it will be interesting to see if Toronto will bounce back with a we-no-longer-have-to-care optimism against Philadelphia this coming Saturday. With only three more regular season home games (including Saturday), the team owes their fans at least one win. And maybe the once deafening chant of \"T-F-C\" will return to the house on the Lakeshore.</p> <p><strong>Dan Walsh</strong>, editor, <a href=\"http://phillysoccerpage.com/\">Philly Soccer Page</a>:</p> <p>Philadelphia Union played to a scoreless draw against New England in their last match on Sept. 1, controlling much of the game's flow but failing to finish their chances. That continued a pattern for the Union, who have scored just three goals during a six-game winless streak. The Union took 18 shots, but they just couldn't find the back of the net. Freddy Adu started at central attacking midfield with Michael Farfan moving to a wing, and the duo proved an active and dangerous pair in one of the game's few bright spots. However, unless the Union's young strikers finish their chances, all the creativity in the world won't matter.</p> <p>This week, the Union travel to Toronto to take on the last place Reds in a battle of the Eastern Conference's 9th and 10th place teams. The Reds are coming off a tough 2-1 loss Wednesday to Chicago and haven't won in eight games. The Union haven't played in two weeks, and no MLS team has played fewer games than the Union this year. A key spot to watch will be whether Farfan and Adu deploy in the same roles, because like a few other Union players, Adu is probably playing for his job next year. They'll face a Toronto defense that looks a bit more stabilized since the addition of center back Darren O'Dea, but make no mistake, this isn't a good team. Each club really needs a win. The question is who wants it more.</p> <h2>Portland Timbers vs Seattle Sounders, Sat 3.30pm (NBC)</h2> <p><strong>Roger Anthony</strong>, <a href=\"http://www.timbersarmy.org\">Timbers Army</a>, Portland:</p> <p>Portland goes into the weekend with one final chance to semi-salvage a disastrous season. By beating archrival Seattle on Saturday, the Timbers can stake a claim on the Cascadia Cup, emblematic of the unofficial Pacific Northwest championship contested by Portland, Seattle and Vancouver. You can make a case that the Timbers are perfectly poised to steal the silverware: The Sounders, after all, have bigger fish to fry, with a Supporters Shield in sight and a CONCACAF match four days following the showdown in Portland. On top of that, if Sounder coaches show their squad tapes of the Timbers' last match \u2013 Sept. 5 at Colorado \u2013 the boys in Barf Green will be full of overconfidence. The Rapids cruised to an absurdly easy 3-0 win. In their short MLS history, the Timbers have fallen behind 3-0 in every match at Colorado, and have scored only once in three visits over two seasons. </p> <p>Among the questions being carried into Saturday's match is whether the there will be revisions to the suddenly stabilized lineup. With an interim coach calling the shots and no hope of a playoff spot, some might expect the season's final months to be a learning lab for the club's young players. Instead, interim coach Gavin Wilkinson has locked in on a back four of Kimura-Mosquera-Horst-Smith, playing them steadily regardless of (wildly inconsistent) results. That will change Saturday, as LB Smith will be sidelined due to yellow-card accumulation.</p> <p>It will be loud 'n' rowdy Saturday. Given Portland's penchant for defensive meltdowns early and late \u2013 and the recent crunch-time wizardry displayed by Freddy Montero and Eddie Johnson \u2013 odds are the Cascadia Cup won't need engraving by Sunday morning.</p> <p><strong>Sam Chesneau</strong>, <a href=\"http://www.gorillafc.com/\">Gorilla FC</a>, Seattle:</p> <p>Its hard to complain about another 3 points for the boys after a home win against the struggling Chivas. Two goals from Eddie Johnson off wonderful service from designated players Christian Tiffert and Fredy Montero, respectively. This offense is clinking at the right time, and it appears despite the embarrassment of riches their is a slight chance we might be adding even more to the arsenal with Eidur Gudjohnsen. However the front office has made it known they expect to participate in CONCACAF each and every year which means some silverware is still needed. The Sounders remain tied for 3rd in the supporters shield race and have an away trip against the lowly Timbers to take back control of the Cascadia Cup will help them keep the pressure on San Jose and Kansas City and force them to continue to come away with results.</p> <p>The Sounders are psychologically a completely different team than the last time they faced the Timbers, having gone 7-1-4 since the 2-1 loss at Jeld-Wen with the lone loss a last second defeat against league leading San Jose on the road. The Timbers on the other hand, have since lost their coach, their dignity and their owner lost his marbles. Since there is no pity in Rose City, we'll save the drama for another day and taste their tears after a 2-0 loss in front of that poor Timbers Army that still lack any kind of history that includes winning anything significant. This is once again, their game of the year, since the playoffs are pretty much out of the picture, the only hardware they can obtain is a cup that would give them 2 chances at home against us to get, so salute to our little brothers with special needs across the Columbia river.</p> <h2>New York Red Bulls vs Columbus Crew, Sat 7pm</h2> <p><strong>Tim Hall</strong>, author of \"The view from 101\" for <a href=\"http://www.firsttouchonline.com\">First Touch</a>, New York:</p> <p>After the long international break, the Red Bulls are back to business on Saturday, and they've got a pretty clear path laid out before them, even if it's not an easy one. Seven games remain on the campaign, five of which are at home (and the only road games are at New England and Philadelphia, not exactly long flights). New York sits third in a tightly packed Eastern conference, four points behind the leaders Sporting Kansas City. Fortunately New York can control their own destiny with two games against KC still on the schedule.</p> <p>First things first, at home Saturday against Columbus, who hold the final playoff spot in the East and will be keen to solidify that position with a result in New York. But the Red Bulls are still yet to lose at home, and with the team rested will look to climb back closer to the top. The big questions revolve around a packed lineup, including the returning Rafa Marquez. Where the Mexican fits in the lineup with Dax McCarty being the defensive midfielder of choice will be interesting. That is a sterling example of the lineup troubles that have plagued New York all season, and now, they've only got seven games left to nail it down before the playoffs - or even make the playoffs in the first place.</p> <p><strong>Ben Hoelzel</strong>, <a href=\"http://crewunion.com\">Crew Union</a>, Columbus Crew:</p> <p>So, the Month of August saw the Crew go streaking. The Men in Yellow plodded through a grueling schedule of 7 league games in 22 days. It started off with two draws and then four straight victories before the good times finally came to an end with defeat at New England a week and a half ago. It was bound to happen. The boys looked tired, emotionally drained, and ready for a break. And playing on a horrendous synthetic pitch didn't help matters. But, there is a lot to feel good about in that seven game stretch, mainly the new look Crew offense spearheaded by the sublime playmaking of Federico Higuian and finishing of Jairo Arrieta. The two combined for six goals and seven assists in the six games leading up to New England, and just like that the Crew are in the thick of the playoff race.</p> <p>Now, with over a week off, everyone gets a chance to see how good this New Look Crew can be with time to practice and run with fresh legs (ironically, this weekend kicks off a stretch of 3 games in just 8 days). New York is the perfect litmus test. They sit just four points ahead of the Crew in third place in the East. Of the top six teams battling for the playoffs in the East, NY has scored the most goals (46) but have also conceded the most (39) as their Jekyll and Hyde season continues. In April, NY thrashed the Crew 4-1. However, there will be no less than 6 changes to the Crew's starting XI this weekend since that game. This is a whole new team. Can the Crew's new found offensive prowess keep it going, and will a recharged defense be a dominant force once again? Who&#xa0;knows? Let's predict a draw.</p> <h2>D.C. United vs New England Revolution, Sat 7.30pm</h2> <p><strong>Martin Shatzer</strong>, <a href=\"http://www.blackandredunited.com/\">Black and Red United</a>, DC:</p> <p>Before the international break, D.C. United just wrapped up a ridiculous stretch of five games in 14 days. Although the team's record during that streak was only 1-2-2, it could have easily been significantly better if not for some fatigue/injuries (the 1-0 loss to Real Salt Lake), unlucky breaks (Wilman Conde of the Red Bulls scoring the goal of his life), and unexplainable refereeing (what up, Mark Geiger). United played well enough to win four out of the five games. That may seem encouraging, but it doesn't mean much when you're looking at the standings.</p> <p>Fortunately, United's schedule is about to get easier, with the next five matches coming against teams that are currently outside of the playoff race. Unfortunately, United may have to do it without Dwayne De Rosario, who suffered an apparent MCL injury during his time with the Canadian National Team earlier this week.</p> <p><strong>Christopher Camille</strong>, <a href=\"http://www.midnightriders.com/\">Midnight Riders</a>, author of NE tactics blog <a href=\"http://soccertheory.wordpress.com/\">Soccer Theory</a>:</p> <p>The Revs have finally made some changes in the back, bringing in Darius Barnes and Flo Lechner, that has allowed the club to play a bit more confidently and press further up the field. I still wish that Heaps would play with more true midfield width but at least this current tactical set up is perfect for allowing Diego Fagundez to impose himself on the game and he has done very well.</p> <p>On the opposite end of the spectrum, Benny Feilhaber has hit a new low with the Revs. He played for the Revs reserves last week after only making a late cameo for the Revs against Columbus. I just can't picture him featuring much the rest of the season or for the Revs next year. I expect a trade, and possible the changing of the guard with Juan Toja set to soon make his club debut.</p> <h2>FC Dallas vs Vancouver Whitecaps, Sat 8.30pm</h2> <p><strong>Gina Zippilli</strong>, <a href=\"http://the-inferno.net\">The Inferno</a>, Dallas:</p> <p>We had a bye for the last game, so not a lot to report other than a friendly against Leon FC that went to penalties and gave us the sight of Bruno Guarda out-backflipping the player who'd scored the penalty before his. Other than that, everyone except Ugo Ihemelu is fit for the run-in, and the Panamanian contingent and Brek Shea are due back from national team duty. At one point in the season this would have looked like a routine game, but now, if we win this, we're one point behind them in the play off standings.</p> <p>Vancouver tend not to do very well when they play us - both times we've played at BC Place we've beaten them fairly easily, so you'd think that at home etc etc. But I've been following this time for too long to get too optimistic. I hope the players appreciate the magnitude of the situation and get the job done. If we beat them the play-offs are attainable.</p> <p><strong>Brenton Walters</strong>, Communications Director, <a href=\"http://vancouversouthsiders.ca/\">Vancouver Southsiders</a>:</p> <p>I can't remember the last time the Whitecaps won a game, or even got a point. It feels like it's been eons. Amazingly we're still in a play-off spot, and even in a decent position to stay there. Our 2-0 loss to LA away was expected, as we rotated a number of starters and hadn't been playing well for a while. We didn't even get a shot on net, which is starting to feel normal. The one positive to take from the game was that our defence looked solid: Juninho and Beckham scored brilliant goals (1st and 2nd in MLS Goal of the Week voting), but we restricted LA to mostly shooting from outside the 18, and keeper Brad Knighton didn't have a particularly busy night. </p> <p>We're away to our play-off rival Dallas this Saturday. An away game, the heat, and a traveled strike force (Mattocks, Richards and Miller all featured for their national teams) potentially means an impotent attack. DeMerit and O'Brien will have to keep Dallas' renewed offence at bay, and Robson, Koffie and Davidson will have to be careful about giving players like Perez and Ferreira too much time on the ball. Lee shut down the dangerous Brek Shea last time and he'll have to be sharp again on Saturday.</p> <p>What is encouraging is that over the period of their resurgence, Dallas have only kept one clean sheet. Unfortunately that was against us in that dreadful loss in August, but it means that we should have opportunities to score. It's just a matter of whether we can take advantage of those. I'm guessing the heat and our form will be too much to overcome. </p> <h2>Chicago Fire vs Montreal Impact, Sat 8.30pm</h2> <p><strong>Dan Martin</strong>, <a href=\"http://www.section8chicago.com/\">Section 8</a>, Chicago:</p> <p>The Fire returned to league play against Toronto on Wednesday after an extended break. Given TFC's cellar status and the game in hand that the original Men in Red held over several of their Eastern Conference foes, the game was really a must-win. The club did just that, with two goals in a thoroughly dominant first half (and, if I'm being honest, some scrambling to hold on to the advantage despite a TFC goal in the second half). A win on the road is a win on the road, though, and I don't think there's a Fire fan in the world that would look at the standings post-game and not feel good about seeing Chicago listed at second place in the east, just 3 points behind Kansas City.</p> <p>Saturday at Toyota Park presents another golden opportunity to make up ground, albeit against a slightly more threatening Canadian opponent. I'd expect the Fire to start a very similar lineup to those that took the field at TFC, though perhaps with a speedier forward lineup to try and take advantage of Montreal's experienced, but aged, backline. Dominic Oduro has been silent in the goals department for a while now, and this could be his night to end that streak. Oduro has been used primarily as a super-sub since the arrival of Sherjill MacDonald, but I would not be surprised to see him in the starting lineup this weekend. He scored the club's first goal of 2012 in the season-opener at Montreal -- if he can repeat the feat in front of the home fans (and if the defense can shore up its occasional poor positional play) it will help greatly towards another 3-point haul and with a little help, who knows? First place in the East? After the past two seasons, do Fire fans dare to dream big?</p> <p><strong>Sofiane Benzaza</strong>, <a href=\"http://www.mountroyalsoccer.com\">Mount Royal Soccer</a>, Montreal:</p> <p>After a 2-week break, the Montreal Impact is back in action this weekend, against the Chicago Fire. Not finishing on a good note before the break, the 2-1 loss against the Columbus Crew was frustrating but the Impact is still in the playoff race. With no injuries and suspensions to hinder the team, Jesse Marsch will have an almost full squad and his choices for the end of the season will be crucial.</p> <p>The Chicago Fire is another hot team in the Eastern Conference, showing consistency and a killer instinct to win games. Led by Chris Rolfe, the offensive sector is full of threats even with Marco Pappa leaving to the Netherlands. Alvaro Fernandez is settling in very nicely and the Fire's strong overall play will be a challenge for the Impact.</p> <p>Facing challenges has been the story of the Montreal Impact all season and they have met them very well as the club is still in the playoff race. A strong center back line with Alessandro Nesta at the helm should help the team handle threats in the box. One issue might come from playing 3 center backs in a 4-man defense, something that Jesse Marsch will look at renewing against the Fire.</p> <h2>Chivas USA vs San Jose Earthquakes, Sat 10.30pm</h2> <p><strong>Alicia Ratterree</strong>, <a href=\"http://www.thegoatparade.com/\">The Goat Parade</a>, Chivas USA:</p> <p>Last week, Chivas USA attempted to right the ship and see if heading up to Seattle to face the Sounders would cure their recent woes. Despite getting off to a terrific start with an early goal from Nick LaBrocca, the Goats allowed an equalizer and then a late winner by Eddie Johnson to lose 2-1. The loss leaves Chivas winless in their last six games, and only earning two points in that span has meant that any hopes of making the playoffs are long gone. Now, the question is whether they will win again in 2012.</p> <p>The bad news is that Chivas are set to face the San Jose Earthquakes this weekend. Both teams met up two weeks ago, and Chivas lost 4-0, giving up multiple set piece goals in the process. Prior to that game, they hadn't allowed a set piece goal all season, but such is the depth of this team's slump at the moment. Optimism certainly can't be high for a team that allows a massive amount of goals and still has trouble scoring, but it has to be remembered that this is indeed MLS, and there are no guaranteed results in this league. Chivas certainly need to pick up their form for the entire match if they have any hope of getting a result against the league's best team, but this team showed for much of 2012 they indeed have what it takes to get results. The question is whether we will see any kind of revival in form on Saturday.</p> <p><strong>\"Nerdy Gales\"</strong>, <a href=\"http://www.centerlinesoccer.com/\">Center Line Soccer</a>, San Jose:</p> <p>The San Jose Earthquakes are the first team to make the 2012 MLS playoffs, and in the past fortnight, the journey to that destination has been through Chivas USA. The convincing 4-0 home win before the international break was a cool and controlled performance. The Quakes squad apparently found its free kick touch with three in the victory over Chivas USA: one Bend-It-Like-Bernardez 35-yarder, and two for skipper Ramiro Corrales. It's just another example of how this year's team confidence is translating into a change in fortune for a club who had only two goals directly from free kicks in the past three seasons. Spurs loaner Simon Dawkins scored the fourth and several spectacular saves by Jon Busch preserved the shutout. </p> <p>The upcoming weekend's away trip sees Quakes fans anticipating more of the same against The Goats. Bernardez and Chavez return from international duty, where both scored for Honduras. Some shine returned to Wondo's golden boots when he recovered his scoring ways, albeit in an international friendly against San Luis FC (and in stoppage time, naturally). Seattle's victory over Chivas USA in the only match last weekend ensured a playoff spot for the Earthquakes, with the next destination the Supporters' Shield. The Earthquakes have a league high, and club record, 56 goals this season, and with The Goats shaky defense the smooth ride should continue this weekend \u2013 I'm predicting a Earthquakes victory by a couple of goals.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.mlssoccer.com/standings\">MLS Standings</a></p>",
  "<p>An independent UK aid watchdog has defended the British government's response to the famine and food crisis in the Horn of Africa. The Independent Commission for Aid Impact (ICAI) said the Department for International Development (DfID) could have done more to anticipate and respond to the emergency, but still performed \"relatively well\".</p> <p>Governments and aid agencies came under fire earlier this year for failing to react more swiftly to warnings of a likely emergency in the region, where more than 12 million people were affected by food shortages after rains failed in late 2010 and early 2011.</p> <p>Oxfam and Save the Children <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jan/18/east-africa-drought-disaster-report\" title=\"\">criticised the delayed response</a> to the crisis, saying swifter action could have prevented the deaths of tens of thousands of people.</p> <p>But <a href=\"http://icai.independent.gov.uk/2012/09/14/icai-report-on-the-uk-emergency-response-in-the-horn-of/\" title=\"\">an ICAI report published on Friday</a> awarded the UK government's \u00a3200m emergency response a \"green-amber\" rating, signifying that it performed \"relatively well\" against criteria for effectiveness and \"value for money\".</p> <p>The report acknowledged that DfID should have been better prepared and could have done more to anticipate the emergency, but argued future crises will be better handled only if weaknesses in the global humanitarian system are addressed and donors work more closely with national governments.</p> <p>DfID and other donor agencies were faulted for lacking flexibile mechanisms to release funds and scale up programmes in response to crises. This, said the report, meant that by the time DfID responded to the unfolding emergency, \"the focus had to be on protecting lives and livelihoods\".</p> <p>The report said DfID's humanitarian staff spent too much time and effort working on press releases and review documents for Andrew Mitchell, the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2012/sep/04/andrew-mitchell-justine-greening-uk-development\" title=\"\">former UK development secretary</a>, who had to sign off all emergency spending.</p> <p>\"The UK made a real and positive difference to the lives of millions of women, men and children in dire need in the Horn of Africa. DfID now need[s] to address the recurring crisis in the region and build sustainability and resilience to work towards longer term solutions,\" said ICAI chief commissioner Graham Ward.</p> <p>However, the report pushed back against previous criticisms of the humanitarian response, arguing the situation on the ground was \"more complex\" than agencies have suggested and that there were \"varying views about the quality and coherence of early warning indicators\". To rectify this, it called on DfID to push for a more effective and coherent early-warning system, drawing together the various sources of information available.</p> <p>At the same time, the report suggested that donors shouldn't always act immediately.</p> <p>There is a \"challenging trade-off\", it said, between acting quickly to save lives and pushing for national governments and other donors to take some responsibility for the crisis response, which would help to ensure UK taxpayers get value for money.</p> <p>\"Our view is that it was appropriate to push for national ownership before significantly scaling up,\" said the report's authors. \"Earlier action could have undermined the government and perpetuated a culture of donor dependency. Once national ownership was secured, however, DfID was likely to have had more impact by taking the lead rather than waiting to get other donors on board.\"</p> <p>ICAI evaluators spent two weeks in Kenya and Ethiopia assessing DfID's work but, due to security concerns, did not visit Somalia or the refugee camps near the Somali border.</p> <p>Set up last year by Mitchell, ICAI has published 13 evaluations of different programmes. It has awarded eight green-amber ratings but no green scores.</p> <p>A DfID spokesperson said the agency is \"already working to strengthen early-warning systems and help people to cope with regular droughts across the region and beyond,\" but added: \"Britain cannot do this alone. We will use this valuable report to strengthen our own work, and press the international community to avoid future crises.\"</p> <p>While the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/feb/03/famine-somalia-over-says-un\" title=\"\">UN formally declared the famine in Somalia over</a> in February, more than 2 million people are still thought to be in crisis. \"Overall, despite the recent improvements, the humanitarian situation in Somalia remains critical and must remain on the global agenda to avoid the risk of reversing the gains made,\" Jens Laerke, of the UN Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs, <a href=\"http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5jv_BdHkABObQuEibSGk2u5rby1Rw?docId=CNG.f0d83e805c19d696138adbc8d99f2154.6e1\" title=\"\">told reporters</a> this week.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 24 September 2012.

  "<p>There's trouble brewing in Canada.</p> <p>It's difficult to perceive on first glance. In Toronto, the air is clean, crime rates are low and healthcare is universal. Yet an undercurrent of anxiety courses through the country's public discourse and its media; it dominates conversations in coffee shops and university hallways. A volley of recent polarising political developments has led many Canadians to ask whether their country's reputation as a tolerant, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/sep/05/canada-carbon-emission-targets\" title=\"\">environmentally conscious</a> international peacemaker is suddenly in doubt.</p> <p>A harsh crackdown on illegal immigrants has belied the notion of a country open to incomers. Quebec has elected a separatist provincial government, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/05/quebec-separatists-election-victory-shooting\" title=\"\">triggering political violence</a>. The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/feb/20/canada-eu-tar-sands\" title=\"\">extraction of oil from the vast tar sands</a> of Alberta has proven hugely controversial, as has the marginalisation of the country's First Nations indigenous people. In foreign policy, Canada is increasingly toeing the US line, most recently <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/08/iran-hostile-canada-severs-diplomatic\" title=\"\">cutting diplomatic ties with Iran</a>. And its Afghanistan deployment has been tainted by allegations of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/nov/20/canada-allegations-complicit-torture-afghanistan\" title=\"\">complicity in the torture of detainees</a>.</p> <p>Some, though not all, of this tendency has been blamed on the country's conservative leadership, which gained a parliamentary majority in May last year. The prime minister, Stephen Harper, has tightened immigration policy, struck a hard line in the Middle East and adjusted environmental policy to encourage controversial oil extraction programmes in the country's vast northern hinterlands.</p> <p>\"Everybody knew that Harper would have a different agenda from that of the Liberals,\" said Herb Grubel, a professor emeritus at Simon Fraser University and former member of parliament. \"What he has been doing is putting into effect some of these ideas.\"</p> <h2>Immigration</h2> <p>Canada is one of the few countries in the world that still looks to immigration as a tool for nation-building \u2013 <a href=\"http://maytree.com/policy/research-reference\" title=\"\">20% of Canadians were born abroad</a>, and new immigrants add 0.8% to the country's population each year. Multiculturalism has been a formal policy since 1971; it's taught in the country's elementary schools.Yet over the past year immigration authorities have radically adjusted the criteria for successful applications and cut resettlement programmes en masse. In June, Ottawa provoked a firestorm of controversy \u2013 and sparked a spate of doctors' protests \u2013 when it eliminated all but the most basic healthcare for certain refugee groups. Last week, immigration minister Jason Kenney announced that <a href=\"http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/ottawa-revoking-citizenship-of-more-than-3000-after-fraud-investigation/article4532222/\" title=\"\">3,100 people would have their Canadian citizenship revoked</a> for hiring immigration consultants to falsify their documents. Eleven thousand aspiring citizens are still under investigation.\"There's a lot that we need to fix pronto, otherwise the message goes out to the world that we're not a welcoming place,\" said Ratna Omidvar, president of Toronto-based immigration foundation Maytree.</p> <p>Since 2006, the <a href=\"http://www.thestar.com/news/canada/politics/article/1147060--canadian-citizenship-rejections-have-more-than-doubled-since-2006\" title=\"\">refusal rate for Canadian citizenship</a> applications has doubled; the number of immigrants from Asian countries such as <a href=\"http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/Immigration-applications-to-Canada-drop-in-Asian-countries/articleshow/13165547.cms\" title=\"\">China and India has halved</a>.</p> <p>Some analysts say the changes point to a deep-rooted, yet widely ignored undercurrent of racism in Canadian society. In late August, news leaked that the Bank of Canada had removed an east Asian-looking woman from preliminary designs of its new $100 bill, <a href=\"http://mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/08/21/canadians-ask-why-design-of-100-bill-replaced-asian-woman-with-white-one/\" title=\"\">replacing her with a caucasian</a>. Chinese groups were outraged, causing the bank to issue a public apology.</p> <p>\"Fighting racism in the States is like punching a brick wall, but fighting it in Canada is like punching a marshmallow \u2013 it always melds back to the same shape,\" said Minelle Mahtani, a professor at University of Toronto Scarborough. \"We live in an ostrich-head-in-the-sand-like denial that racism exists in this country, and yet systemic discrimination is the norm.\"</p> <h2>Quebec</h2> <p>Intolerance is also rife in francophone Quebec, which elected the separatist Parti Quebecois leader <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/06/quebec-elections-minority-government-shootings\" title=\"\">Pauline Marois as premier</a> on 4 September. Marois's ascent to power has been shadowed by violence: a man shot two people at the Montreal convention centre where her party was celebrating its victory, killing one and leaving the other in a critical condition. \"The English are waking up!\" the man shouted in French during his arrest, eliciting widespread soul-searching about the depth of the province's linguistic divide.</p> <p>Quebec was already reeling from a spring full of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/may/24/canada-student-fee-protest-arrests\" title=\"\">huge student-led street demonstrations</a>. The movement, often referred to as the \"maple spring\", began as a smattering of peaceful protests against tuition fee hikes. But when the then incumbent Liberal administration passed an emergency law to crack down on demonstrators, simmering discontent exploded into full-blown dissent. At the height of the movement, almost 1,000 protesters were arrested in a 400,000-strong Montreal march, some of them as young as 15.</p> <p>Analysts say that Marois is unlikely to hold a referendum on independence \u2013 she is fighting from a minority position and popular support for secession has waned since Quebec's last referendum in 1995.</p> <p>Yet she has invited controversy by proposing measures that would <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/05/parti-quebecois-shooting-fears\" title=\"\">restrict freedom of language and religion</a> in the province. Her promise to strengthen Quebec's French language charter would restrict access for some groups to English junior colleges. Her \"secularism policy\" would ban religious symbols such as headscarves, skullcaps and hijabs in public offices. Yet it would allow crucifixes, which, according to Marois, symbolise traditional Quebec culture.</p> <p>\"There is still a large group of ethnic nationalists who believe that Quebec should be for the pure-wool francophones who founded this province,\" said Bruce Hicks, a professor of political science at Concordia University in Montreal. \"Pauline Marois, out of deference to this more extremist group in her party, sort of pandered to that.\"</p> <h2>Tar sands</h2> <p>Almost 4,000km away from Montreal, the vast plains of northern Alberta province lie at the heart of another national debate. The region contains 140,000 sq km of \"<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/oil-sands\" title=\"\">tar sands</a>\" \u2013 a mixture of sand, water and clay the texture of cold molasses \u2013 which contain copious amounts of highly viscous petroleum. Over the past decade, technological developments and soaring oil prices have made its extraction economically viable, making it a prime destination for major international oil companies.</p> <p>Critics say that Harper's environmental policy favours these companies over the long-term wellbeing of Canada's natural environment. Last month, Ottawa cancelled almost <a href=\"http://www.ottawacitizen.com/technology/Federal+government+cancels+environmental+reviews+pipelines/7136029/story.html\" title=\"\">3,000 environmental reviews</a> on proposed development projects across the country, many of which involved tar sands oil extraction.</p> <p>The Canadian government has approved a 730-mile pipeline from the Alberta tar sands to the shores of British Columbia, where it will be loaded on to oil tankers and shipped to Asian markets. Environmental groups have launched a united stand against the project, claiming that Enbridge \u2013 the Calgary-based company at its head \u2013 has been <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/aug/20/enbridge-canada-tar-sands-alberta\" title=\"\">dishonest about the risk of potential oil spills</a>. In 2010, an Enbridge pipe burst in northern Michigan, leaving a <a href=\"http://www.fox17online.com/news/fox17-kalamazoo-river-enbridge-oil-spill-still-a-concern-to-residents-20120911,0,2076893.story\" title=\"\">still-visible oily sheen on the area's rivers</a>.</p> <p>\"Canada has always been a natural resource extraction country \u2013 it's logging, it's hydro-power, it's mining, it's oil and gas,\" said Susan Casey-Lefkowitz, international director at the Natural Resources and Defence Council. \"But the tar sands is such a big resource, and it drew such major players, that it's really reshaped the way the government has dealt with environmental issues.\"</p> <h2>First Nations</h2> <p>Tar sands oil extraction has also underscored an already fraught relationship between the federal government and Canada's nearly 700,000 indigenous people, called First Nations. For decades, resource extraction on First Nations land and chronically underfunded schools have left many of these communities mired in poverty, alcoholism and disease.</p> <p>Gerald Amos, former chief of the Haisla Nation in coastal British Columbia, said that while his community used to survive by catching oolichan fish \u2013 a type of smelt \u2013 in the nearby Kitamaat river, this traditional way of life is long gone. Toxic dumping has destroyed the river, driving the fish to the brink of extinction. Amos fears that the Enbridge project will consume what's left of the wilderness near his home, where the pipeline will meet the coast.</p> <p>\"I think that the big issue for a lot of communities \u2013 one that really hasn't been grappled with yet \u2013 is the cumulative impact of what we call progress,\" he said. \"And that's something that I think communities are going to have to start grappling with very quickly.\"</p>",

  "<p>As Apple's marketing chief Phil Schiller ran through the specifications of the new iPhone 5 on Wednesday, talking of A6 processors and IPS displays, there were three letters that some people were eagerly waiting to drop from his lips: NFC.</p> <p>They were disappointed: the new iPhone does not include Near-Field Communications technology, which almost certainly means that the prospective payment system will struggle for at least another year to gain traction and users.</p> <p>EBay's chief executive, John Donahoe, often quotes a merchant saying NFC stands for \"Not For Commerce\" \u2013 and dismisses the prospects of NFC being used to turn mobile phones into mobile wallets.</p> <p>Apple's failure to include it seemed to support that view, even though many rival smartphone makers, including Samsung, HTC and Sony, do put NFC in some models.</p> <p>NFC proponents had hoped Apple would endorse the technology, which passes encrypted data between devices at close range without contact. The idea is that instead of swiping a credit card, shoppers can simply wave their phones at a checkout terminal to pay for their goods.</p> <p>But its absence in Wednesday's launch left some thinking it will sit in the doldrums until the next iPhone revision. \"Anyone hoping NFC would be a reality soon is disappointed,\" said Sanjay Sakhrani, an analyst at Keefe, Bruyette &amp; Woods. \"Many in the industry were hoping inclusion in the iPhone would be a springboard for more adoption. This takes the impetus away.\"</p> <p>Tudor Aw, KPMG's European head of technology, commented that \"the lack of an NFC chip to enable mobile payments is perhaps the biggest surprise and disappointment \u2026 The interesting question is whether this omission will mean further delay in mobile payments taking off or if it presents an opportunity for its competitors to take a lead in this field.\"</p> <p>Fred Huet, managing director of Greenwich Consulting, thinks it's the latter: \"The decision to omit NFC in the iPhone 5 could cost Apple. It is just a matter of time before the smartphone replaces the plastic card, and by skipping this technology, Apple may have missed a valuable opportunity to take the lead in this market. With over 400m active credit card accounts on file, Apple had a prime opportunity to convert its customers using a sleek mobile payment system tied to the iPhone. Instead they could find that they have fallen behind closest rivals Samsung, Nokia and indeed Motorola, all of whom introduced the technology into their devices last week.\"</p> <p>Apple did not include NFC because it is not clear the technology solves any current problems, Schiller told AllThingsD on Wednesday.</p> <p>Instead of embracing NFC, Apple is developing Passbook, a mobile app that pulls together QR-based and smartcode-based loyalty cards, tickets and coupons on the new iPhone. Many analysts consider this an early version of a digital wallet, except Passbook does not let users link their credit and debit cards yet.</p> <h2>No adoption<br></h2> <p>Meanwhile, there's no evidence yet of rival phones driving NFC's use, says Benedict Evans, who follows the smartphone and tablet business for Enders Analysis. \"NFC has been around forever \u2013 and gone nowhere.\" </p> <p>He says \"there might be half a dozen to a dozen NFC-capable smartphones on the market - Samsung Galaxy S3, new Nokia Lumias, Google Nexus range the new Sony Experia, maybe a couple of others. The key issue for a developer is that you have literally no idea how many of these have been sold.\" And the figure for all NFC-capable smartphones compares with 950 Android devices on sale worldwide in the second quarter of the year, according to figures from research company IDC.</p> <p>\"Nobody knows which device does have it and which doesn't,\" says Evans. \"If you're an Android developer, do you target it in the device in the expectation it will be there, or not? Of course not.\"</p> <p>He contrasts that with Apple's single-device approach: \"For the iOS [iPhone, iPad and iPod Touch software] developers, if Apple has it in the iPhone, they know there will be <strike> 35m </strike> 100m phones with NFC in a year's time. And all the people who might be interested in a new technology like that will have bought new phones. So for the developer, there's a clear value proposition once Apple includes it as a feature.\"</p> <p>In fact, the number of credit cards tied to Apple's iTunes account is a whopping 430m, according to Eddy Cue, Apple's head of internet software and services, speaking at the iPhone 5 launch. Apple is one of the 10 biggest holders of credit card details online, alongside PayPal, Microsoft's Xbox service, Sony's PlayStation Network, and Amazon.</p> <p>But even though NFC technology is backed by the largest US carriers and credit card companies, it has failed to take off in the US because merchants have been reluctant to spend money to upgrade their checkout terminals until NFC is more widely adopted.</p> <p>Evans says that the key point about Apple's unified approach \u2013 where each successive generation of iPhones and iPads gets all the features of the preceding ones \u2013 helps developers: \"Apple provides a stable target for developers, and a stable product that consumers can adopt knowing it won't disappear.\"</p> <p>He says: \"Other companies are just putting things into the phone to see if it will work. It means nobody has any confidence in that feature. But people know that if Apple puts NFC in the next iPhone, it'll be in the next iPad too. Compare Samsung, which has NFC in the Galaxy S3, but not the Note 10.1 tablet. The people at Apple, by contrast, doesn't put a piece of technology in unless they know what people are going to do with it. They don't just put a front camera in the phone until they have their own video calling system (Apple's FaceTime system) that they know will work.\"</p> <h2>Experimental Android<br></h2> <p>Android companies have more freedom to experiment, Evans says. \"They'll put the technology in a phone and hope there might be some software support in time. The problem with something like NFC, though, is that to be worth having, it has to be consistent. So just sticking it in doesn't work.\"</p> <p>NFC (which has uses beyond mobile payments) is being backed in the US as a payment solution by Isis, a mobile wallet joint venture in the US between Verizon Wireless, AT&amp;T and T-Mobile on the carrier side, and financial companies including American Express , JPMorgan Chase and Capital One Financial.</p> <p>But like many new technologies, NFC is hampered by a chicken-and-egg problem. Mobile-phone makers like Apple are reluctant to take on the extra cost and engineering effort of embedding NFC chips because many merchants can't accept payments this way yet. Meanwhile, merchants won't install NFC until more consumers have the technology on their phones.</p> <p>After the new iPhone arrived \u2013 without NFC \u2013 Isis said it was delaying the launch of its NFC mobile payments service for the second time this year.</p> <p>\"Isis has placed a massive bet on NFC,\" says David Evans, founder of Market Platform Dynamics and an adviser to companies in the payments business. Apple's continued deferral \"is another reason to believe that Isis doesn't have much promise of getting off the ground.\"</p> <h2>Driving the market<br></h2> <p>Some might find the idea that Apple can drive or hold back a smartphone technology, when it only comprises about 20% of worldwide sales, ludicrous. Yet Google included NFC in its Nexus S phone, released in December 2010, and spoke then of the possibilities of payment systems, which it is building into its Android mobile software. Other digital wallets have already been developed by companies including eBay's PayPal and Visa \u2013 with the latter pushing their use at the Olympic and Paralympic games in London this summer. Widespread adoption has not followed.</p> <p>The latest digital wallets, though, aim to bring together credit and debit cards, bank accounts, loyalty cards, rewards and coupons in one place so that shoppers can pay for purchases mostly online, but increasingly in stores, too.</p> <p>NFC's advocates argue it eliminates plastic and cash and can be more secure than magnetic strips. But that alone will not persuade consumers to stop using credit cards in stores because plastic is already so convenient, experts say.</p> <p>\"It is a new technology and one that is unfamiliar to users. So that opens up new possibilities for abuse and naivety,\" says Charlie Miller, principal research consultant with Accuvant. But he says NFC allows for interesting security options that traditional credit cards don't, such as account numbers that change dynamically.</p> <p>PayPal is betting other services that make digital wallets more useful will encourage consumers to switch \u2013 it is designing a digital wallet that helps consumers do as many things as possible from one place, including buying flight or movie tickets, sending money to other people and tapping coupons, rewards and loyalty cards.</p> <p>\"Technology is not what's going to win this digital wallet war. It's going to be about the consumer value proposition,\" says Carey Kolaja, senior director for PayPal's product team.</p> <p>Others argue NFC still has potential, partly because merchant incentives from Visa and MasterCard are expected to spark a wave of payment terminal upgrades in coming years. These upgrades will include NFC capability.</p> <p>\"It is difficult to buy a new terminal that doesn't already have NFC technology, and soon it will be impossible,\" says Rick Oglesby of consulting firm Aite Group.</p> <p>But the software and service providers behind the terminals will also have to be ready to accept and process payments that come with coupons, loyalty cards and rewards programs.</p> <p>At the moment, most terminals can handle the amount of the transaction and the card number and not much else, Oglesby said.</p> <p>Until this is all sorted out, Apple will likely wait to enter the payments business aggressively, Oglesby and others say. Apple took a similar approach to 4G LTE wireless technology, waiting until coverage was wide enough this year to unveil an iPhone that uses it, Oglesby notes.</p> <p>\"They won't do something until they know a lot of their customers will use the service,\" he says.<br><em><br>This article was updated: Apple has 430m credit card details, not 43m; Benedict Evans says that his estimate of how many iPhones would have NFC within a year is 100m, not 35m; he did not suggest that 200 Android models have NFC. The article has been corrected to reflect this.</em></p>",
  "<p>Exporting overseas can be a key opportunity for small firms to win new business. After all, as Richard Jeffery from Business Growth Hub pointed out in his recent <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/small-business-network/2012/jun/12/exporting-your-product\">blog post</a>, why limit yourself to domestic trade when the UK makes up just 1% of the world's population?</p> <p>Here at the Guardian Small Business Network we have seen some really inspiring examples of small businesses who've successfully gained a foothold in the global marketplace. SMEs have exported the best of British around the world:<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/small-business-network/2012/jun/22/networking-locally-power-business-globally\"> top-quality food from an idyllic Lake District</a> base, timepieces from a Derby clockmaker, and ice cream from Somerset.</p> <p>Keen to follow in their footsteps?

Was it conceived in the smoke-filled back rooms of London pubs or did it leap fully formed from the dive bars of New York?</p> <p>Few would imagine the genre that revolutionised music was actually born at a cinema matinee in the Peruvian capital of Lima.</p> <p>Almost a decade before the Ramones, the New York Dolls or the Sex Pistols struck a chord in anger, the Peruvian band Los Saicos (the Psychos) were screaming, speeding and drinking their way to local notoriety. Now, thanks to an upsurge of interest and a recent documentary, the band \u2013 all in their sixties \u2013 have reformed and found their biggest following in half a century.</p> <p>Their signature tune, Demolici\u00f3n (Demolition) has been revived as an anthem for political protesters and, reportedly, - for drug barons. In the Lima district of Lince, a marble plaque has been erected with the provocative claim etched in marble: \"The global punk movement was born here. Demolish!!!\"</p> <p>Los Saicos burned brightly and briefly in the mid-60s, performing together for a few years and recording no more than a dozen songs. They were inspired by Elvis and the Beatles to play rock'n'roll but thanks to a frenetic effort to make up for a lack of training and equipment (Roland Carpio made his own guitar), with energy and attitude they ended up with a sound that was 10 years ahead of its time.</p> <p>Demolici\u00f3n <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haVaaDLwWvI\" title=\"\">starts slowly with a typical 60s guitar and drum intro</a>, then jolts a decade into the future as lead man, Erwin Flores, screeches \"tatatatayayayaya\", followed by an anarchic exhortation to \"Smash down the train station!\"</p> <p>Their claim to a place in history was bolstered in December when they were listed as the world's first punk band in the Spanish Dictionary of Punk and Hardcore published by Zona de Obras.</p> <p>\"They are the first to play what later became punk. There was no name for that at the time, but the riffs are definitely punk,\" said Jos\u00e9 Beramendi, the producer of <a href=\"http://www.saicomania.com/\" title=\"\">Saicomania</a>, a documentary about the band. \"You expect this sound from North America or Europe, but it's not something you expect to hear in the 1960s in Latin America.\"</p> <p>It is a controversial claim. There were no safety pins, no mohicans and, according to the band, no drugs beyond cigarettes and alcohol. But they were undoubtedly breaking the mould.</p> <p>Los Saicos were raised on a musical diet of Harry Belafonte, Peruvian <em>criolla</em> and classical waltzes in the conservative and hierarchical society characterised in the early novels of Mario Vargas Llosa. Elvis and the Beatles changed their lives.</p> <p>Their early shows were at cinema matinees, where bands were hired as an extra draw for the screenings. Most groups performed covers of syrupy pop songs, but Los Saicos revved up the energy by mixing original love ballads with hoarse, souped-up tracks about prison breaks, funerals and destruction.</p> <p>\"Compared to other bands of the time, we had a bad-boy image. They turned up with their aunts, we had girls on each arm,\" <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/video/2012/sep/14/los-saicos-peru-1960s-punk-video\" title=\"\">recalls the drummer Pancho Guevara</a>.</p> <p>They were detained several times by the police, mostly for speeding but also for taking a sledgehammer, axe and fake TNT to the railway station for a record cover photo shoot.</p> <p>After a few frenetic years of celebrity, which saw them host a daily TV show, the band moved on. Flores relocated to the US and became a Nasa scientist. C\u00e9sar \"Papi\" Castrill\u00f3n switched from bass to retail sales, Carpio died and Guevara started a construction company.</p> <p>But their music slowly built up a cult following and is now moving into the mainstream. The band reformed in 2010 after a 45-year gap, their records were re-released in Spain and they performed overseas for the first time \u2013 in Spain, Mexico and Argentina. They are in talks to play in the US next year.</p> <p>Demolici\u00f3n has become a rebel anthem \u2013 and not just for the politically disaffected. \"I heard a report from Mexico that the bosses of drug cartels drive into town in trucks with speakers playing it at full volume. That's cool,\" said Guevara, though he insisted the band were more naive than anarchic.</p> <p>Perhaps because he is now a pillar of the Lima business community, Guevara claims the song was originally a joke about trainspotting. \"Leftwing groups use it as a protest song, but we were never interested in politics. There was just nothing much to do in those days so I used to go to the station and watch the trains coming and going. I talked about it endlessly, which really irritated Erwin. That's why he wrote Smash the Train Station. It was his way of telling me to shut up about the trains.\"</p> <p>It will take more than a plaque and a box-set to convince rock historians that Los Saicos were the first punks. In the early 60s, bands such as the Trashmen and the Sonics were thrashing out similarly furious tracks and Iggy Pop had formed his first group.</p> <p>But Guevara said the label was unimportant. \"I don't know what 'punk' is,\" he said. \"We wanted to play rock'n'_roll but this is the sound that came out. I don't know where it came from. It was just something that emerged when we started playing.\"</p>",

Hopefully these lofty words do not reflect Santana's own prose style. \"Being recognised by all who hear a single note is a God-given miracle,\" the statement continues. \"This gift has been bestowed on a select few: Bob Marley, John Lennon, Michael Jackson, Jimi Hendrix, John Coltrane, Alice Coltrane, Stevie Ray Vaughn, John McLaughlin, and, of course, Carlos Santana.\"</p> <p>Santana, who is 65, has promised stories of Miles Davis, BB King, Eric Clapton, Buddy Guy and many others.

  "<p>The record loss of Arctic sea ice this summer may mean a cold winter for the UK and northern Europe. The region has been prone to bad winters <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/mar/14/met-office-arctic-sea-ice-loss-winter\" title=\"\">after summers with very low sea ice, such as 2011 and 2007</a>, said Jennifer Francis, a researcher at Rutgers University.</p> <p>\"We can't make predictions yet \u2026 [but] I wouldn't be surprised to see wild extremes this winter,\" Francis told the Guardian.</p> <p>This year's ice melt has broken the 2007 record by an an area larger than the state of Texas.</p> <p>Polar ice experts \"thought that it would be many years until we again saw anything like we saw in 2007\", said Mark Serreze, director of the <a href=\"http://nsidc.org/\" title=\"\">National Snow and Ice Data Centre</a> in Colorado.</p> <p>The unprecedented expanse of ice-free Arctic Ocean has been absorbing the 24-hour sun over the short polar summer. The heat in the water must be released into the atmosphere if the ice is to re-form this autumn. \"This is like a new energy source for the atmosphere,\" said Francis.</p> <p>This heat and water vapour will affect the all-important jet stream \u2013 the west-to-east winds that are the boundary between cold Arctic and the warm mid-latitudes. Others researchers have already shown that the jet stream has been shifting northwards in recent years. Francis and colleagues have recently documented that the jet stream is also slowing down.</p> <p>\"The jet stream is clearly weaker,\" said Francis. That means weather systems, be it rain or dry conditions, are slow to move on and last longer. Ultimately this can result in \"blocking\" events, such as the conditions that produced the terrible heatwave in western Russia during the summer of 2010, she said.</p> <p>This summer, Greenland experienced a similar blocking anti-cyclone, resulting in a record surface melting of its ice sheet. It is not possible to directly connect that block to the prolonged US heatwave and drought this summer, Francis said. However \"blocks act like a traffic jam, slowing down weather patterns elsewhere\".</p> <p>These changes are happening much earlier than scientists thought, said James Overland, an oceanographer and researcher at the University of Washington.</p> <p>\"We've only had a little bit of global warming so far,\" Overland said.</p> <p>As the sea ice continues to decline, the jet stream will likely continue to slow more, and shift further north \"bringing wild temperature swings and greater numbers of extreme events\" in the future he said. \"We're in uncharted territory.\"</p>",
  "<p>I spent yesterday at a conference in Cambridge on the theme of \"<a href=\"http://\" title=\"\">reputation in the age of protest</a>\", sponsored by the YouGov polling organisation and addressed by speakers as diverse as British and US government officials, corporate CEOs and Wael Ghonim, the Egyptian blogger who was nominated for the Nobel peace prize for his role in the Arab spring.</p> <p>In a world where, so several people reminded the audience, reputations acquired over 20 years can be lost on Twitter in a careless five minutes, the session was a mixture of optimism and occasional alarm bells. How could it be otherwise on a day when the Hillsborough coverup was finally exposed (a Leveson scandal before Leveson!) and when a tawdry and provocative Islam-bashing US film had provoked an ugly and deadly response, equally foolish, in the Middle East?</p> <p>On a lighter depressing note, we woke this morning \u2013 the conference, co-sponsored by the Guardian, continues today \u2013 to find that <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2012/sep/14/kate-william-furious-topless-photographs\" title=\"\">snatch-photos of a topless Duchess of Cambridge are being published in a French magazine</a>. Odd in a country whose ferocious privacy laws protected the likes of Dominique Strauss-Kahn, but serving no evident public interest. Alas, as with Prince Harry's willie, we will hear more spurious claims about the public right to leer from slow learners in Fleet Street.</p> <p>In Cambridge yesterday all sorts of people said that governments and corporations can't control the new social media (or can they? warned others) and had better get with the programme, responding as rapidly to individual consumer complaints aired online as BP did to the Deepwater oil rig disaster, only more adroitly.</p> <p>Likewise diplomats, who need to adapt to ever-faster news cycles in different time zones \u2013 which also means embracing Twitter and Facebook. But the likes of Ghonim also wondered if the flipside of a binary online world (good/bad with few nuances), where brutal online ridicule and loathing is widespread, might have quashed the noble aspirations of an Abraham Lincoln or a Martin Luther King at an early stage.</p> <p>Fascinating stuff, but all tough stuff too, underpinned by the way globalisation is reinforced by internet technology at a time when the west's leadership in that globalising wave is being challenged by a resurgent Asia. But \"Globalisation 2.0\" also sees what Joel Rogers, director of YouGov Cambridge, calls \"transnational forces of public opinion\", which make it all much harder to manage in traditional ways.</p> <p>In other words, individuals are more empowered by the internet, and a new global middle class can make its influence felt against tyrannical or merely incompetent government \u2013 most visibly across the Middle East since 2011 \u2013 as can society's discontented, those who have lost their jobs and prosperity thanks to globalisation's shifts of production or who can see on TV and their smartphones what others have and want it too. In the wake of global financial meltdown extremes of right and left return to challenge the politics of centrism.</p> <p>Parts of yesterday's exchanges were of a familiar kind, almost pre-internet. Thus General Lord (Richard) Dannatt, former chief of the general staff, spoke of Britain's lingering postcolonial obligations in many parts of the world, but also how the risks of military intervention had often been understated since the Falklands war of 1982 revived the fashion. Politicians, solders and diplomats focus too much on immediate problems instead of horizon-scanning to nip potential problems in the bud.</p> <p>The conference was backed by global polling which the Guardian has been reporting in the past few days: predictable mistrust of Mitt Romney in Europe, for example, and the divergent views on the state and social policy on the two sides of the Atlantic, but also lingering mistrust of Britain for its receding imperial role in the Middle East and north Africa to offset more positive attributes such as democracy and the rule of law. British education is a conspicuously successful feature of its \"soft power\" in 2012.</p> <p>Politicians get a predictable kicking in terms of public trust and reputation, though someone \u2013 a corporate, not a politician \u2013 pointed out that fewer than one in three MPs were compromised by the MPs' expenses scandal and that this had not been sufficiently pointed out. Quite so. Less predictably, Gary Hoffman, the Barclays banker who stepped in to sort out tottering Northern Rock in 2008 \u2013 he was going off Barclays at the time \u2013 said he did so because he was impressed by customer loyalty.</p> <p>Even as they took their savings out in panic they said they wanted to put them back again when things settled down. Yes, you can change corporate culture and correct past error, including corrupt practices but \u2013 said someone else \u2013 you have to spend more time on low-probability/high-risk problems than the less important high-probability/low-risk kind that firms tend to focus on.</p> <p>And yes, you need to have established good relations with the government \u2013 or media \u2013 before a crisis breaks. It's too late when it's already under way. That was one of BP's problems in the Gulf of Mexico, compounded by CEO Tony Hayward's decision (his advisers told him to) to go on US TV in person \u2013 a Brit with an unfortunate accent and smirk \u2013 instead of putting up one of BP's tough Texan oilmen.</p> <p>It's all about adaptation to change in ever-faster circumstances. The British army thinks the US army is too \"kinetic\" \u2013 too hyperactive \u2013 and that its own experience in Northern Ireland would allow it to run Basra with ease. But the Americans adapted more quickly and created General David Petraeus's \"counter-insurgency army\" to defeat al-Qaida and force the Saddamist Sunni insurgents to negotiate with the Shia majority, said Sir Robert Fry, a clever former marine general. In Syria it is the Sunnis who are the repressed majority \u2013 a mirror-image situation which is encouraging renewed militancy in Iraq.</p> <p>I could write much more. Let's end on a negative note and a positive one. Fry said that the invasion of Iraq broke a 200-year British consensus about the utility of force: that the government of the day would only fight when it had to and that the military would eventually do the job honourably and well with public support.</p> <p>I thought that verdict overlooked all sorts of controversy and incompetence, from the Crimean and Boer wars to the Kenyan and Malayan emergencies, but we can see that there will be fewer such interventions in future. Chinese strategic thinkers cannot believe how incompetent the US and its British allies have been in recent deployments, said Fry, unleashing forces they did not understand with awful consequences.</p> <p>The day's closing session was more optimistic. Ghonim, jailed in Cairo during the Egyptian revolution, spoke of the internet as a tool which made it harder for repressive regimes to deny inconvenient facts or sweep protest under the carpet (how can it when the photos are on Facebook?) and insisted that the wisdom of crowds \u2013 \"the masses always outsmart the politicians\" \u2013 can prevail.</p> <p>Would the Egyptian revolution have occurred without the internet? Yes, but differently and more slowly, Ghonim suggested. Are the Muslim Brotherhood and other Islamist forces a threat to the openness and reform which the Globalisation 2.0 world seeks? The Brotherhood is in power now, not simply criticising from the sidelines. That makes it more realistic and will make its supporters more realistic over time, he seemed to suggest.</p> <p>With all the dismay evident among Muslim speakers at the murder of Chris Stevens, the sympathetic US ambassador to Libya \u2013 the provocative film is so ridiculous that it amounts to a promotion for Islam, Ghonim explained \u2013 it was hard to pretend that the road ahead would be easy. After all, Egypt and Algeria almost came to blows after online abuse between supporters of their two sides before a World Cup qualifier.</p> <p>But Ghonim was warm and wise, a good speaker with whom to end the day.</p>",
  "<p>Should the Large Hadron Collider ever take a break from accelerating particles to probe the mysteries of the universe it could do worse than examine another puzzle which continues to baffle mankind, namely the Fifa world rankings which at present rate England third behind Spain and Germany while Brazil are 12th, behind Greece.</p> <p>While Roy Hodgson was entitled to feel pleased about some aspects of England's performance in Tuesday's World Cup qualifier against Ukraine, there cannot have been many who believed that they were watching the world's third-best team.</p> <p>Yes, Hodgson's players did show patience and were less inclined to hoof the ball vaguely upfield but the defending was sloppy, the finishing haphazard and the Ukrainians were better organised all round.</p> <p>In terms of effort, maybe England did deserve to be rescued by Frank Lampard's late penalty which brought them a 1-1 draw and considering the makeshift nature of the team Hodgson put out after losing so many players to injuries and stomach bugs, it was not that bad a result.</p> <p>But any notion that England were going to stroll to the 2014 World Cup in Brazil was banished not only by the splendid shot from Yevhen Konoplyanka which gave Ukraine the lead but also the clumsy fashion in which Joleon Lescott gave the ball away a few seconds earlier.</p> <p>Poland and Montenegro will be equally swift in punishing similar errors. Anyone who thought this was a boring, predictable qualifying group after watching England stroll past a Moldova side that would struggle to stay in the top half of the Blue Square Bet Premier League was forced to think again.</p> <p>Steven Gerrard may genuinely believe England can win the next World Cup. After all, if the captain did not think so there would not be much point in competing. But at least one English World Cup winner, Bobby Charlton, cannot see an England side winning a major tournament in the foreseeable future.</p> <p>So what is the national team's true standing in world football? The Fifa rankings are based on a side's performance over the previous four years, with recent results and significant matches carrying more weight in order to reflect their current form.</p> <p>It is a complex exercise. The present system involves, among other things, an opposition-strength factor based on team rankings which produces an opposition-strength multiplier. It is doubtful whether Hodgson's last words to his players before they took the field on Tuesday included a warning about Ukraine's opposition-strength multiplier. Or maybe this was preying on Lescott's mind when he gave them the ball.</p> <p>Away from statistical gymnastics the present England team are not on a par with Brazil, Spain, Germany, Italy, Argentina, Holland or France in terms of World Cup potential. In 1970, when Sir Alf Ramsey took the then World Cup holders to Mexico, England were rightly regarded as second only to Brazil and proved as much when they lost a classic encounter narrowly to the team of Pel\u00e9 and Tost\u00e3o in Guadalajara.</p> <p>Now they are more on a level with Turkey, who ran Brazil close in the 2002 World Cup semi-finals (closer certainly than Sven-Goran Eriksson's team had done in the quarters) before losing to a goal from Ronaldo but, like England, very rarely reach the last four let alone a final.</p> <p>England are to play Brazil twice next year, at Wembley in February and again in June as part of a brief South American tour, games which could become exercises in machismo or masochism depending on how Hodgson's players perform. The last time England went to Rio was in 1984. A week earlier fans at Wembley had spat on Bobby Robson after his team lost 2-0 to the Soviet Union. Now the nation rejoiced as John Barnes dribbled through the Brazil defence to put England ahead and Mark Hateley's header completed a morale\u2011boosting victory.</p> <p>Hodgson will trust that his team are equally capable of turning things around in similarly dramatic fashion should the need arise, although when an England manager is forced to give inexperienced Premier League wannabes full international caps in World Cup qualifiers the shallowness of his options becomes painfully obvious. After Tuesday's brush with reality, talk about winning anything will remain idle speculation until England have actually qualified. And even then it will merely be gossip unless the possibility of reaching the final gains serious momentum, as it did in 1990.</p> <p>Then the Fifa rankings would start to make more sense.</p>",

  "<p>The UK is to go ahead with a mass removal of Tamils to Sri Lanka next week despite mounting evidence from human rights group that many of them could be tortured on their return.</p> <p>At least two and possibly three chartered flights are scheduled to leave the UK from Wednesday carrying an unknown number of Sri Lankan Tamils whose pleas to remain in the UK have been refused. The UK Border Agency (UKBA) refuses to discuss such flights until they have landed.</p> <p>The Home Office says it only removes people who face no risk of torture, but <a href=\"http://www.freedomfromtorture.org/\" title=\"\">Freedom from Torture</a> and Human Rights Watch both argue that the government has severely underestimated this possibility when it comes to returned Tamils, many of whom are routinely arrested and questioned about links with the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) and activities in the UK, with torture often playing a part.</p> <p>Such removals were halted while the Sri Lankan government fought a brutal civil war with the Tamil separatist group but resumed after the LTTE's military defeat in 2009.</p> <p>In June <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/jun/05/tamils-deported-sri-lanka-torture\" title=\"\">the Guardian interviewed one man who recounted being beaten</a>, hung and asphyxiated after being forcibly returned from the UK, testimony supported by a mass of scarring.</p> <p>Despite the concerns, the UKBA is believed to be planning its biggest removal yet of Tamils, with two or possibly three flights leaving on successive days.</p> <p>David Mepham, the UK head of <a href=\"http://www.hrw.org/europecentral-asia/united-kingdom\" title=\"\">Human Rights Watch</a>, said the organisation had documented a series of cases of returned Tamils facing mistreatment.</p> <p>He said: \"Given the very serious risk of torture facing many Tamils returned from this country, the UK should immediately impose a moratorium on these returns, pending a thorough review of UK policy in this area and the introduction of new risk assessment guidelines.\"</p> <p>Freedom from Torture has put together perhaps the most comprehensive study yet of the perils faced by Tamils returning to Sri Lanka from the UK. It tracked 24 cases of mainly young Tamils living legally in Britain who travelled back to Sri Lanka voluntarily, for example to visit family, and said they were detained and tortured. In half these cases the Tamils, once back in the UK, were referred to charities by NHS staff after they sought treatment for injuries, particularly burns caused by cigarettes or other heated objects.</p> <p>The organisation's 16-page report noted: \"This rate of referrals involving torture following return from the UK to a particular country is, to the best of our knowledge, unprecedented since Freedom from Torture was founded in 1985.\"</p> <p>Such cases, the group concludes, show that even Tamils with LTTE associations who were previously allowed to leave Sri Lanka safely for the UK faced risks if they returned. It said: \"The cases demonstrate that the fact the individuals did not suffer adverse consequences because of this association in the past does not necessarily have a bearing on risk on return now.</p> <p>\"It is a combination of both residence in the UK and an actual or perceived association at any level with the LTTE which places individuals at risk of torture and inhuman and degrading treatment in Sri Lanka.\"</p> <p>Many of those who voluntarily returned were detained within days and questioned at length about their activities in the UK, indicating Tamils who had lived in Britain possibly faced an increased risk of mistreatment.</p> <p>Types of torture commonly employed, according to testimonies, included beatings with cement-filled plastic pipes or clubs, whipping with cable, burns, partial asphyxiation using petrol-filled plastic bags, and sexual assault, including rape.</p> <p>The 24 people were examined once back in the UK, with a majority of them showing significant physical signs of torture. One group had an average of 17 scars each which could be attributed to probable torture.</p> <p>In the interview in June, the Tamil man, who was among two dozen asylum seekers deported by the Home Office the previous year, said he had been tortured over 17 days. His torturers accused him of passing on to British officials information about previous beatings at the hands of state officials and other human rights abuses, to ruin diplomatic relations between the two countries, he said.</p> <p>A UK Border Agency spokesman said: \"The UK has a proud record of offering sanctuary to those who need it, but people who do not have a genuine need for our protection must return to their home country.</p> <p>\"We only undertake returns to Sri Lanka when we are satisfied that the individual has no international protection needs. The European court of human rights has ruled that not all Tamil asylum seekers require protection.\"</p> <p>The Sri Lankan high commission in London did not respond to a request for comment.</p>",
  "<p>In accounts of all-consuming passions, the details can often overshadow an understanding of motivation. Adventure literature, in particular, is susceptible to this problem. The scale, risk and sense of awe involved in crossing oceans and polar ice caps or climbing mountains can make it hard to grasp why such feats are attempted in the first place. In the past decade or so a few mountaineering books have avoided this trap to tell us often unsettling things about the psychology of top climbers. Among them have been <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/sportandleisure/9780898868876/kiss-or-kill-confessions-of-a-serial-climber\" title=\"\"><em>Kiss or Kill</em></a>, the bleakly existential and angry memoir of self-described \"punk-alpinist\" Mark Twight, Johnny Dawes's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/sportandleisure/9780957030800/full-of-myself\" title=\"\"><em>Full of Myself</em></a> and Andy Kirkpatrick's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/sportandleisure/9780099519522/psychovertical\" title=\"\"><em>Psychovertical</em></a>. If there is a thread linking these accounts, it is the depiction of a kind of awkwardness, the feeling of being out of step with the expectations and demands of ordinary life, usually experienced first at school. A gap filled by climbing.</p> <p>This memoir from <a href=\"http://nickbullock-climber.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Nick Bullock</a> is the latest addition to this short, if not exhaustive, list: an unusual and powerful story that is as remarkable for its depiction of the author's life as a prison officer in one of the country's toughest jails, Gartree, as for his prodigious achievements on the mountains. One of the world's best mountaineers (a fact confirmed by his recent ascent, the first by a British climber, of the dangerous and extremely demanding \"Slovak route\" on Denali, Alaska this summer), Bullock writes with a rare candour not just about his climbs but also about his political education in a violent world.</p> <p>It is a book that grasps the attention immediately, as Bullock describes, in the shocking first few paragraphs, cradling a man's broken head in his hands, with \"strings of cerebral fluid\" making his knuckles wet. The scene is ambiguous just for a moment as the reader wonders if he is describing a climbing accident. But this is no accident. The man he is holding is a prisoner who has been struck on the head with a dumbbell in the gym after his drug-dealer training partner discovered he was a paedophile.</p> <p>The story of Bullock's life and climbing career will come as a surprise to anyone whose notion of mountaineering has been informed by the British media over the past few years. For his is the antithesis of the usual tales of wealthy people being guided up Everest. Born into a working-class family in the Potteries, he struggles at school. His first job, as an underkeeper on a Welsh estate, leads to what sounds like a kind of breakdown, his teenage confidence brutally undermined by an episode of psychological bullying.</p> <p>A series of dead-end jobs follow before he sits his entrance exam for the prison service. It is only then, in his 20s, that he discovers climbing, which acts as a liberation from the closed, hard world of the category A prison.</p> <p>Not so long ago I heard a climber in his 50s talking about the notion of being a \"lifer\" \u2013 still going into the mountains well into middle age. And in an arresting section of this book, Bullock asks an uncomfortable question: what similarity is there between the recidivist criminals he encountered and climbers such as himself, who repeatedly court huge risks? \"I wanted climbing,\" he writes. \"I was prepared to put in the time and effort to gain the experience. But then, for repeat criminals, there's also the thrill of the chase, the uncertainty, the tension, the excitement \u2013 how much is that part of their drive? Crime or climb? Were they just two intoxicating drugs to get some of us through the sterility of modern life, the consumerism we learn in our schools, from parents and on TV?\"</p> <p>Indeed, as Bullock belatedly makes the transition from prison officer to full-time climber, he borrows images from prison to describe his climbs and uses his experiences of danger in the mountains as a metaphor for the violent life he encounters in the British jail system. In this, Bullock echoes the poet and critic Al Alvarez who, in his <a href=\"http://\" title=\"\">1988 biography</a> of his friend and sometime climbing partner, Mo Anthoine, talked of \"feeding the rat\" \u2013 borrowing Anthoine's own idea about climbing as a kind of self-medication.</p> <p>This is a book driven by contrasts between the closed, enervating world of prison and the growing awareness and confidence Bullock feels on the mountains. In the end, the narrow scrapes, the friends Bullock loses and the exhilaration he feels on his solo winter climbs are all signposts on his road to self-liberation: the day he felt strong enough to resign from the prison service and walk out of jail for the last time.</p>",
  "<p>After an excellent summer of arts in Manchester, three students plan to further expand the musical and artistic landscape of the city.</p> <p>For the social butterflies amongst us, summer has been wonderfully rammed with artistic excitement. Organisations like <a href=\"http://www.blankmediacollective.org/\">Blank Media Collective</a>, <a href=\"http://www.cornerhouse.org/\">Cornerhouse</a>, <a href=\"http://contactmcr.com/\">Contact</a> and <a href=\"http://www.z-arts.org/\">Z-Arts</a> \u2013 to name just a few \u2013 have held extensive festivals and programmes involving institutions large and small. Stretching across the city, they have included a number of non-traditional venues - pubs, car parks, night-clubs - and have attracted a wider audience as a result.</p> <p>Autumn sees this innovation expand into the classical music world with <strong><a href=\"http://figurerefractionground.wordpress.com/\">Collectives and Curiosities</a></strong>. Established by Jacob Thompson-Bell, Michael Betteridge and Emma-Ruth Richards \u2013 three composers and <a href=\"http://www.rncm.ac.uk/\">Royal Northern College of Music </a>students \u2013 the project aims to take classical music out of the concert hall to involve more art forms. As Jacob Thompson-Bell explains:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The concert hall is only one context in which to hear music; there's nothing inherently wrong with it but it shouldn't be the only setting. Surroundings do a lot to form people's impressions of an experience; we want to present our music in as many different ways as we can.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396182836\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/14/1347599578284/flyers.jpg\" alt=\"manchester\" width=\"460\" height=\"326\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Who could resist \"a series of lively events\"?</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: guardian.co.uk</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><br> Following on from the success of their initial night held at the Brodsky Bar in the RNCM building, their second installment, || : figure refraction ground : || is an extensive five installation to be held at <a href=\"http://www.blankmediacollective.org/events/exhibitions/blankexpression_2011_blankspace_launch\">Blank Space</a>, Hulme St&#xa0;. Running from 25 \u2013 29 September it involves a collaboration between the musicians and a wide array of visual artists including Debbie Sharp, Joanne McClung and Hayley Andrew who will work alongside singers, a string quarter and solo wind performers. Betteridge says:</p> <blockquote> <p>Musical performances last for a certain period of time, then they're gone. With physical sculptures and photographs, the same artwork can be revisited again and again. This installation uses sound recorded throughout the event, and a whole range of visual responses from the artists and Collectives and Curiosities, to combine the two. We want to show visual arts in a context that changes over time, and music as part of a physical exhibition that remains.</p> </blockquote> <p>The artists and musicians have a fully interactive experience planned and all those who visit Blank Space will become a part of the installation itself: Anyone who enters will be recorded by the numerous microphones in the building, these recordings will be then mixed down and filtered through the gallery. On a larger level, audiences can make active choices about their interaction with events, in terms of how much, or little, they listen to or engage with it.&#xa0; Elsewhere, there will be a comments board, interactive scores and participatory events that will ensure our audience is entirely active in the production of this work.</p> <p>Emma-Ruth Richards adds her view:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>People that would never come to hear a contemporary piece for string quartet will likely come because they have been invited to see an art installations and visa versa. As everyone who visits will contribute towards the final piece, the outcome is, as yet, completely unknown. </p> </blockquote> <p><em>For more information and to take part visit the || : figure refraction ground : || <a href=\"http://figurerefractionground.wordpress.com/\">blog here.</a></em></p>"
