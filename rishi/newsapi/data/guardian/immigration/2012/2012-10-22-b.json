Both call for sanctions on Iran; both believe in the drone program; Romney even seems to agree with the president's plan to withdraw from Afghanistan in 2014, although that hasn't stopped him from criticizing the president for naming a date.</p> <p>One policy area where the two may differ is on the use of \"enhanced interrogation techniques\" to question terror suspects. President Obama shut down Bush's CIA \"black sites\" and prohibited the torture tactics Dick Cheney argues for to this day.</p> <p>Romney appears to favor the use of torture in some cases. His team of advisers includes figures from the Bush administration who were among the most aggressive advocates of torture.</p> <p>\"A Romney administration would risk a return to the immoral, illegal, and counterproductive policies of President George W. Bush,\" writes David Cole in the <a href=\"http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2012/nov/08/election-2/?page=2\">New York Review of Books</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We were painfully reminded of this prospect on September 27, when <em>The New York Times</em>&#xa0;reported on a leaked memo, written by Romney\u2019s national security advisers, urging him to advocate restoration of the&#xa0;CIA\u2019s \u201cenhanced interrogation techniques,\u201d i.e., to return us to the \u201cdark side\u201d of professionally administered torture and physical cruelty.</p> <p>Romney did not write the memo himself, of course, and we do not know precisely how he reacted to it. But it is consistent with his public statements, in which he has criticized President Obama for ending the \u201cenhanced interrogation techniques,\u201d and has maintained, against precedent and common sense, that waterboarding is not torture.</p> <p>The Romney torture memo is unsigned, but was written by members of a committee of Romney national security advisers that included Steven Bradbury, Cully Stimson, David Rivkin, and Lee Casey. These may not be household names, but they should cause alarm among those who care about the United States\u2019 commitment to the rule of law.</p> </blockquote> <p>Read Cole on Bradbury's work for Bush <a href=\"http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2012/nov/08/election-2/?page=2\">here</a>.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-508585ab58f96784ee2908d8\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-22T17:43:07.664Z\">6.43pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Giant glaring metaphor alert:</strong> A blimp-like aircraft with a huge Romney ad on the side got into trouble in high winds in South Florida last night and crash-landed.</p> <p>\"After all it isn't every day you see something this large looming below the treeline,\" the reporter says, helpfully.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWo7G22zcEw\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/wWo7G22zcEw?wmode=opaque&fs=1&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>  </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-50857ef358f96784ee2908d7\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-22T17:14:27.232Z\">6.14pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here's one for the <strong>conspiracy theorists</strong>: the CBS affiliate in Arizona broadcast a graphic Friday afternoon showing that Barack Obama had been reelected president of the United States.</p> <p>The twist: the election hasn't happened yet.</p> <p>The explanation: the station was just practicing.</p> <p>The suspicious detail: why not practice with a graphic showing that Mitt Romney won?</p> <p>If you have the stomach for this sort of thing you can visit <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?pid=11103719&amp;l=d0a2d0b7dd&amp;id=24718773587\">Sarah Palin's Facebook</a> page to sample the outrage, such as this witticism from commenter Jorge Lopez Jr: \"Goes right along with their name, 'see BS.'\"</p> <p>Michele Wallace of KPHO told <a href=\"http://dailycaller.com/2012/10/21/cbs-news-affiliate-calls-2012-presidential-race-for-barack-obama-weeks-ahead-of-election/#ixzz2A33rRQGU\">The Daily Caller</a> it was a mistake with a test graphic:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>On Friday October 19th during a test of KPHO- CBS 5\u2019s election returns software we inadvertently aired a test graphic for about 15 seconds in an episode of Peoples Court.

Here are the final two paragraphs:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The choice is clear. The Romney-Ryan ticket represents a constricted and backward-looking vision of America: the privatization of the public good. In contrast, the sort of public investment championed by Obama\u2014and exemplified by both the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act and the Affordable Care Act\u2014takes to heart the old civil-rights motto \u201cLifting as we climb.\u201d That effort cannot, by itself, reverse the rise of inequality that has been under way for at least three decades. But we\u2019ve already seen the future that Romney represents, and it doesn\u2019t work.</p> <p>The re\u00eblection of Barack Obama is a matter of great urgency. Not only are we in broad agreement with his policy directions; we also see in him what is absent in Mitt Romney\u2014a first-rate political temperament and a deep sense of fairness and integrity. A two-term Obama Administration will leave an enduringly positive imprint on political life. It will bolster the ideal of good governance and a social vision that tempers individualism with a concern for community. Every Presidential election involves a contest over the idea of America. Obama\u2019s America\u2014one that progresses, however falteringly, toward social justice, tolerance, and equality\u2014represents the future that this country deserves.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-10-22T14:35:09.411Z\">at 3.35pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-508550a658f96784ee2908c5\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-22T14:09:46.434Z\">3.09pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Good morning and welcome to our Monday live blog politics coverage.

  "<p>A pregnant woman in a wheelchair was tipped up and had her feet held by staff from G4S, the firm behind the Olympics security shambles, as she was forcibly removed from the country. The disclosure comes in the first report into conditions at a new centre designed to hold families facing deportation from the UK.</p> <p>Nick Hardwick, the chief inspector of prisons, and his team made an unannounced inspection of Cedars, the UK Border Agency's new pre-departure accommodation near Gatwick, where families are housed for the final 72 hours before they are removed from the UK.</p> <p>Nick Clegg promised in the Liberal Democrats' 2010 manifesto that he would put an end to the detention of children. Replacing the controversial Yarl's Wood detention centre with Cedars was at the heart of the coalition's family-friendly removal policy.</p> <p>Hardwick said the unit is \"an exceptional facility [which] has many practices which should be replicated in other areas of detention.\"</p> <p>\"It is to the considerable credit of staff at Cedars that children held were, in general, happily occupied and that parents were able to concentrate on communication with solicitors, family and friends,\" he added.</p> <p>But inspectors also said unacceptable force was used when a pregnant woman was given a wheelchair in the departures area. When she resisted \"substantial force\" was used by G4S staff and the wheelchair \"was tipped up with staff holding her feet\".</p> <p>\"At one point she slipped down from the chair and the risk of injury to the unborn child was significant,\" the report said. \"There is no safe way to use force against a pregnant woman, and to initiate it for the purpose of removal is to take an unacceptable risk.\"</p> <p>Inspectors also reported that although most work from family escort staff was commendable, they \"observed unprofessional behaviour by an officer on a different escort in the hearing of children\".</p> <p>The report also said that although \"considerable efforts were made to avoid force at the point of removal, it had been used against six of the 39 families going through Cedars\".</p> <p>Judith Dennis, policy officer at the Refugee Council, said: \"The numbers of children in detention are increasing. The government acknowledged then how harmful this practice is for children, so why are they still continuing to do it?</p> <p>\"Amongst its praise for the new facility the report reveals the shocking use of 'substantial force' on a pregnant woman, which is completely unacceptable,\" she added.</p> <p>Cedars can accommodate up to nine families at a time in self-contained apartments, with a range of activities provided by Barnardo's \u2013 which campaigns for an end to child detention \u2013 and G4S delivering security and facilities management.</p> <p>Families are referred to Cedars on the advice of the Family Returns Panel, an independent body of child welfare experts. They stay for no more than 72 hours before their departure from the UK. With ministerial authority, this can be extended to one week.</p>",
  "<p>The news that Labour enjoys an eight-point lead in Tuesday's Guardian/ICM poll and has only a four-point deficit on the economy, compared with a 21-point gap not long ago, will do little to calm the growing nerves on the Tory backbenches that something structural, as well as political, is leading David Cameron to misfire so frequently.</p> <p>The prime minister called for calm, urging his backbench MPs not to get distracted by media ephemera.</p> <p>\"We need to focus on the big picture,\" Cameron said. \"What actually happened last week is that unemployment fell, inflation fell, waiting lists in our hospitals fell, crime fell, the right decision was made about [refusing to extradite] Gary McKinnon. Those are the important things that are happening in an economy where we've created a million private sector jobs in the last two years. There will always be people that will go on endlessly about process and processology and Kremlinology and all the rest of it, what actually matters is what is happening out there.\"</p> <p>By Thursday, he could have added, the economy will come out of recession.</p> <p>But the worrying aspect for Tory MPs is \"what is happening out there\" is being obscured by what is happening in No 10. The lack of grip was underlined by a rare interview with Cameron's deputy chief of staff, Oliver Dowden. \"Most of my time is spent on day-to-day crisis management,\" he cheerfully conceded.</p> <p>Dowden added that \"we are not permanently in crisis\" before admitting he only discovered the daily political agenda by listening to BBC Radio 4's Today programme. \"Often you'll get surprised by what's going on \u2026\"</p> <p>Asked when he was last surprised, he replied: \"I'm surprised on a day-to-day basis. There is no accounting for the conduct of individuals.\"</p> <p>More broadly, this may reveal a greater truth about the permanent structure of No 10. One gently described the structure as \"very flat\", code for meaning that a lot of people can go to the same meeting. Another said: \"It is an interesting question who people report to and who they answer to.\"</p> <p>This thesis suggests there is a three-dimensional structural problem \u2013 within the Conservative party itself, between coalition parties, and between the political class and the civil service \u2013 that leads to so many mistakes.</p> <p>Andrew Cooper, the modernising director of strategy at No 10, annoys the right because he openly challenges their thesis that the Conservatives could have won the 2010 election outright but for modernisation.</p> <p>Writing recently in a memoriam for the Labour pollster Philip Gould, Cooper ridiculed rightwing revisionism for saying \"a Conservative majority was there for the taking if only the leadership had pressed harder with robust Tory messages on tax and Europe, and above all immigration; if, in other words, it had refought the 2005 campaign or its 2001 campaign.\"</p> <p>It is the chorus of a cadre of culturally estranged Tory activists committing what Michael Portillo has described as 'the worst error you can make in politics': to presume that the electorate thinks the same as you\".</p> <p>So when senior Tories attack No 10's grip, they are often attacking its politics, or the way in which its politics remain unresolved in the personality of Cameron.</p> <p>Some of that grip is weakened by tensions between the coalition partners. It is hard to prove this, but the sense is that apart from a very small group at the top of the coalition, political, as opposed to personal, relations between the two parties are deteriorating. The tensions created around the absence of growth is pulling the two parties apart.</p> <p>Cameron was left to look foolish over energy prices for 24 hours because the Department of Energy, a Lib Dem fiefdom, refused to come out and help him. Bigger disputes await over Europe, welfare and civil liberties that will make coherence harder to project.</p> <p>The interface between the civil service and the political wing of the coalition is mixed. Steve Hilton, No 10 strategy adviser, left partly because he could not stand civil service delay any longer. In what an observer described as simultaneously \"the best and worst meeting I have ever attended\", Hilton lost it with education department officials when he realised they had made insufficient progress on a zero-based budget review.</p> <p>At points, relations between Tory politicians and the civil service plunged so low that Sir Bob Kerslake, head of the civil service, has suggested a Royal Commission to review its role. The idea has been rejected.</p> <p>Cameron has nearly two years to turn all this round, aeons in politics, but the worry is whether he is ready to accept there is a problem to resolve.</p> <p>There are some short-term some personnel issues, too. The communications department is in transition, with the prime minister's steady spokesman, Steve Field, about to take a new job at the IMF. Cameron's press secretary, Gabby Bertin, will leave soon for maternity leave and, as luck would have it, the No 10 communications director, Craig Oliver, has been in America studying the US television presidential debates during much of the furore over the chief whip, Andrew Mitchell, who was forced to resign on Friday after a month-long controversy over what he said to a police officer at the gates of Downing Street.</p> <p>That in turn may have led to small confidence-sapping errors, such as the conflicting advice issued on Friday on whether a replacement for Mitchell, was to be announced that night (it was).</p> <p>The dank and grey mood around No 10 and the government will hardly be lifted by another poll commissioned by the Tory peer Lord Ashcroft suggesting Labour has stretched its lead in the Corby and East Northamptonshire byelection to 22 points.</p> <p>His numbers show a 13% swing since the 2010 election, and a doubling of the Labour lead since Ashcroft last polled the constituency in August in the immediate wake of the resignation of Louise Mensch.</p> <p>Labour has every confidence that it will hold all four of the other byelections caused by the death of MPs or resignations to stand as police commissioners. Those police commissioner elections due on November are likely to have such low turnouts that the main winner will be apathy, rather than the Conservatives, the pre-eminent party of law and order.</p> <p>Both the Corby poll and the Guardian/ICM poll indicate a substantial Labour majority at the next election.</p>",

Official campaigns and Super Pacs are spending record sums to saturate swing state airwaves \u2013 but neither side packs a killer punch, he said.</p> <p>\"Dukakis in a tank is still remembered. It was iconic. But now there's nothing that tugs at the heart strings, nothing that makes you laugh.\"</p> <p>Earlier this month the advertising count in Las Vegas, which is key to Nevada and its six electoral college votes, passed 73,000 so far this year, a national record. Including congressional commercials Nevada is up to an estimated 10,000 ads per week, with 98 different ads in rotation, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/16/us/politics/never-to-be-outdone-vegas-sets-record-for-political-ads.html?_r=0\">the New York Times reported on Monday</a>.</p> <p>All, said Rogich, to negligible effect. \"It's so overdone. I don't think it's impacting. None are memorable.\"</p> <p>That the Obama and Romney campaigns are waging all-out fundraising efforts for last-minute advertising blitzes suggests they believe otherwise. It will be left to political historians to decide the impact.</p> <p>Rogich, who worked with Roger Ailes and Lee Atwater on Ronald Reagan's 1984 campaign, as well as Bush's Sr's in 1988 and 1992, said the negativity of 2012 was hardly unprecedented. Vicious insults and calumnies flew since the days of Theodore Roosevelt and earlier. \"There has always been rancour; just now it's more visible.\"</p> <p>The problem, he suggested, was the accelerating cycle which compressed news and campaigns into ever faster, smaller clips.</p> <p>An exception to that rule was debates. Rogich's office is adorned with a handwritten note from the former boss he used to prep: \"By God, I've got it: 'Eye contact \u2013 smile \u2013 don't scratch'. Sincerely with thanks, George Bush.\"</p> <p>Rogich said Obama was talented but hamstrung. \"He's eloquent and has a great ability to articulate. But there's an annoyance to his cadence. If I was advising him I'd tell him to be conversational. He needs to talk to people.\"</p> <p>Romney, he said, had made a welcome move to the centre and would prove a pragmatic president if elected but still risked losing the vast majority of Latinos because of his party's anti-immigrant rhetoric. \"It sucks. We better find a reasonable immigration policy because in 30 years we'll have north of 70 million new Hispanic (voters). If we're still viewed as anti-immigrant from a perception standpoint then there won't be a Republican party.\"</p>",
  "<p>The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/22/foreign-policy-debate-romney-obama-live\">third presidential debate tonight focusing on America's foreign policy</a> will probably not have much impact on the race, two weeks before election day \u2013 and with an electorate much more concerned about economic prospects close to home than when exactly did Barack Obama acknowledge that the Benghazi 9/11 attack was an act of terror rather than a spontaneous reaction to the anti-Islam video. Debate moderator Bob Schieffer's decision to devote half the debate to Middle East-related issues (two-thirds if you include also the 15 minutes on Afghanistan/Pakistan) may also seem rather disproportionate, while China, with its major influence on the US economy, is only to be discussed in the final segment. And the eurozone and Mexico, both arguably affecting ordinary Americans lives to at least as great a degree as the Arab uprisings, are not even in the line-up.</p> <p>But one issue to be debated in Boca Raton has the potential to play big in the election \u2013 just not the American one. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/22/barack-obama-israel-settlements-palestine\">Israeli politicians and strategists will be anxiously watching the third debate segment</a> (entitled Red Lines \u2013 Israel and Iran). But it won't be for any inkling of how Obama in his second term or a new Romney administration would handle Iran's nuclear project \u2013 they know that election rhetoric has little relation to foreign policy once the campaign dust settles. Besides, they are in daily contact with both camps in Washington and know the current thinking. Their concern is much more immediate.</p> <p>This will most likely be the last chance to hear a clear statement from either candidate, not only before Americans go to the polls on 6 November, but also in advance of Israel's general elections exactly two and a half months later. Never has an Israeli election been held so close to an American one, and the results of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/oct/22/third-presidential-debate-swing-romney-obama\">electoral college</a> are likely to have major implications on the tone and perhaps the outcome of the Israeli campaign. The strategic teams of the major Israeli parties, Likud and its rivals from the center-left, will be on the lookout for any usable quote that demonstrates either closeness or the slightest of differences between either of the candidates and the government in Jerusalem. Depending on the identity of the victor in two weeks, these quotes will be used accordingly in the ensuing campaign.</p> <p>All the polling in Israel currently points to a clear victory for Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu, with the coalition of rightwing and religious parties upon which he can rely for support winning at least 60% of the vote. The center and leftwing parties are at war among themselves and none of their leaders is seen as a viable challenger to Netanyahu. Each of the parties is trying to attack Netanyahu and Likud on a different front \u2013 social inequities, bellicosity on Iran, religious special interests, the deep-frozen peace process \u2013 but none of these seem for now potent enough to prise enough voters away from the Likud and its partners to break Netanyahu's coalition-lock (a third of Israeli voters describe themselves as centrists). </p> <p>American voters are in the position to give them a crucial lever.</p> <p>In a recent poll carried out by the Maagar Mochot polling company for Bar-Ilan University on Israelis' attitude towards America, 69% said that the United States is Israel's loyal ally, opposed to only 10% who disagreed. An even more overwhelming 93% of Israelis agreed that the close relationship with the US is crucial for Israel's security. This unanimity among the general public is reflected also in closed briefings with senior military and diplomatic officials, who refer to the alliance with the Americans as \"Israel's No 1 strategic asset\", bar none.</p> <p>But there is a slight cloud on this horizon. While 30% of Israelis believe that a President Romney would improve the two countries' relations, should he win next month, only 8% expect Obama to improve ties if awarded a second term. That doesn't mean Israelis dislike the president: 38% said in the poll that they have a positive attitude towards Obama; a similar proportion said they were neutral; and only 23% described their feelings towards him as negative. Just 15% feel he has been unfriendly to Israel during his first term. </p> <p>The great majority of Israelis do not seem to think that Obama has something against them, quite the opposite. This is despite the bombardment of anti-Obama propaganda they have been under for the last five years, ever since the foundation of free newspaper Yisrael Ha'Yom (Israel Today), a well-financed daily that has become the country's most widely-read paper. The slavishly pro-Netanyahu paper, founded and bankrolled by casino mogul Sheldon Adelson, has been telling readers, basically from its first edition, that Israel cannot rely on the pro-Palestinian Democratic party. This is despite the current administration deepening security coordination and intelligence-sharing with Israel and financing Israel's new missile-defense system, the Iron Dome.</p> <p>Adelson is estimated to have spent around $100m on his Israeli paper (political donations in Israel are capped by law, but a private newspaper is a convenient loophole). That is similar to the sum he has pledged the Republicans in their attempt to beat Obama. But it isn't just the mega-donor who connects Netanyahu to his GOP allies. Israel's prime minister, since the time he spent as a diplomat in the 1980s in the US, has been a trusted member of conservative circles.</p> <p>He shares much of their worldview and fiscal principles, is beloved of Christian evangelicals and in his first term in office (1996-1999) incessantly quarreled with Bill Clinton. The last four years have been spent openly differing with the Obama administration, first on freezing settlement-building, and when Obama eased on that, shifting focus from the Palestinian issue to Iran. Netanyahu did not miss a single opportunity to belittle Obama's attempts to dissuade Tehran from pursuing a nuclear weapon through diplomacy and sanctions.</p> <p>While Mitt Romney's reception in London this summer was hardly enthusiastic, on his next stop in Israel, he was accorded a head of state's welcome. And that included an intimate dinner with Prime Minister Netanyahu, each accompanied by his wife.</p> <p>To date, Netanyahu's forceful policy on Iran has not harmed his popularity with Israeli voters. At the same time, successive polls indicate that the majority of Israelis do not support a military strike against the administration's wishes. While the differences between Jerusalem and Washington have been widely reported, Israelis do not fear for now that the relationship is in any way at risk. An open rift could be a potential game-changer. </p> <p>It won't happen, of course, if Romney wins in two weeks: a Republican win could seal also Netanyahu's claim to electoral victory. Netanyahu would be free to bask in the shared glory after betting on the challenger when no one gave him a fighting chance.</p> <p>A re-elected Obama, freed from campaign restraint, is another matter. He wouldn't have to change his policy even, just adopt a more censorious tone towards Netanyahu for a few weeks. </p> <p>The prospect of re-electing a prime minister who is putting Israel's crucial strategic alliance at risk will make many Israelis think twice. Netanyahu, who is acutely aware of this possibility, has brought the elections forward to the earliest possible date, in the hope that two and a half months would not be enough time for Obama, facing the fiscal cliff, to launch new diplomatic initiatives.</p> <p>Over the last two decades, the Israeli electorate has swung back and forth between right-, left- and centrist-led coalitions six times. At present, the opposition seems too fractured and leaderless to win over the centrist voters and unseat Netanyahu in this election. But the prospect of diplomatic isolation could lend them a rallying call \u2013 and perhaps, the only slim chance they are going to get.</p>",
  "<p>When <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2006/jul/14/syria.israelandthepalestinians2\" title=\"\">Israel was bombing Beirut during the war of 2006</a>, a colleague and I sat drinking a beer after a long, hard day, listening to the explosions coming every few minutes from the southern suburbs. \"Is this what it felt like to be somewhere in central Europe in the 1930s?\" he mused. Comparisons are never exact, but I saw what he meant. Lebanon, and the region, was dogged not just by the violence of that year's war but also by a gnawing feeling that the future could contain something even worse.</p> <p>In Lebanon, one of the strongest counterweights to the predictions of bad times ahead is the memory of bad times in the past. <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-14647308\" title=\"\">Fifteen years of civil war in the 70s and 80s</a> left many scars. Lebanon has managed to survive a succession of serious crises since the assassination \u2013 by Syria, bereaved supporters say \u2013 of the former prime minister, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-13978635\" title=\"\">Rafik Hariri</a>, in 2005. A year later there was a war with Israel; in 2007 a protracted battle with jihadists in a Palestinian refugee camp; and there was a mini-civil war in 2008. The list goes on.</p> <p>For every Lebanese person I have spoken to in the last few days, the assassination on 19 October of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/19/lebanon-divide-assassination-security-chief\" title=\"\">General Wissam al-Hassan</a> \u2013 the most important security official in the country \u2013 is every bit as serious, and could have even greater consequences. In his elegant apartment high above Tripoli, Lebanon's second city, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-13767064\" title=\"\">Faisal Karami</a> \u2013 one of Lebanon's rising politicians, the son and nephew of past Lebanese prime ministers who has been talked about as future leader himself \u2013 did not try to play down the seriousness of what has happened. \"He was killed right in the middle of Beirut. It's one of the most dangerous moments for Lebanon since independence in the 1940s,\" he said calmly as gunfire crackled periodically outside. In the slums of Jabal Mohsen and Bab al-Tabbanneh a few miles away, Sunni gunmen were trading bullets with Lebanese Alawites, from the same Shia sect as President Assad and his fervent supporters. \"We've already got a mini-civil war going. People are being shot in the streets.\"</p> <p>In every recent crisis, despite dire predictions, Lebanon's leaders, often with foreign help, have found a way to restore a certain sense of quiet in a country that has never been properly stable. What makes it harder this time is the civil war in Syria, a short drive away, and the uncertainty right across the Arab Middle East. In the region plenty of people have no idea what will happen a month from now, let alone next year.</p> <p>Lebanon's curse is that it does not control its own fate. Throughout its short history as a small and weak independent country, it has been at the mercy of its stronger neighbours. Lebanese leaders depend on the alliances they make with powerful foreigners. Inevitably that makes them party to their patrons' quarrels and wars too.</p> <p>The alliances are partly based on sectarian sympathy, and plug Lebanon into one of the region's most basic conflicts, between the allies of Saudi Arabia and the west, and those who look to Iran. The leader of Lebanon's Sunnis, Saad Hariri, is the client of Sunni Saudi Arabia, which is doing all it can to unseat the Assad regime in Syria. The Assads, with Shia Iran, are the patrons of Hezbollah, the Shia movement of fighters and politicians that is the most powerful force in Lebanon.</p> <p>With conflict in the region these days comes sectarianism. The Lebanese are the Middle East's experts on the subject. They know what it is like to co-exist \u2013 which is why you can see bikinis and beer on Beirut's beaches and black chadors in the city's southern suburbs \u2013 and they know too what happens when communities fall out. Power has always been parcelled out in Lebanon on sectarian lines. Sometimes the system works, but when it breaks down people reach for their guns.</p> <p>As the Middle East goes through an historic transformation, sectarianism is emerging as one of the strongest features in the political landscape. It is not a new phenomenon. The faultline that divides Sunni and Shia Muslims goes back to the dawn of Islam. But it has been sharpened by the events of the last decade, starting with the American-led invasion of Iraq in 2003.</p> <p>For societies that are overwhelmed by political uncertainty, with economies that do not provide enough for young populations, sectarianism is a form of friction they don't need. Using and abusing sectarianism is a good way to manipulate, to mobilise, to consolidate power, to spread chaos in the hope of gaining the upper hand.</p> <p>Nationalism had a similar role in Europe in the 20th century. Sectarianism in the Middle East&#xa0;is as divisive, and perhaps potentially as dangerous, as nationalism used to be, and sometimes still is, for Europeans. Arab&#xa0;countries, and Iran, are not \u2013 yet \u2013 as militarised as the Europeans were. This is not a prediction of catastrophe. But dangers, serious ones, lie ahead.</p>",
  "<p>We're officially over the debate hump \u2013 three down, one to go. What a strange trip it's been. Along the way we've reconnected with our friend Big Bird, revived that old-fangled word \"malarkey!\" and, much to our surprise, been told that professional women can best be found in binders.</p> <p>In all seriousness, we have also learned quite a bit about how these vaunted debates work. Before it's too late and the final presidential match is upon us, we think it's worth taking a look back. Using what we've learned from producing our <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/17/obama-romney-town-hall-debate-decoder\">post-debate decoders</a> \u2013 features that track the questions moderators ask and how candidates answer them \u2013 we've penned this quick list.</p> <h2>1. Debates <em>can</em> make a difference</h2> <p>Before the first match of the 2012 season, there was an outpouring of opinion on how debates \"<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/sep/27/presidential-debate-myth-gamechanger\">aren't game-changers</a>\" and that they \"<a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/wp/2012/10/03/what-political-scientists-know-about-debates/\">don't really matter</a>\". But then Romney went and unexpectedly won the first debate, and the crowds went wild \u2013 or at least the media did.</p> <p>That first match \u2013 which was watched by <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/envelope/cotown/la-et-ct-nielsen-67-million-people-watch-first-obama-romney-debate-20121004,0,7322457.story\">67.2 million people</a> around the country \u2013 gave Romney a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/oct/08/pew-research-poll-bombshell\">four-point bump in the polls</a>, a dramatic swing. How much of that bonus can be chalked up to his performance, and how much to the flood of media chatter is another question entirely, but the bottom line: debates can matter.</p> <h2>2. Only 17 questions have so far been asked of the next president</h2> <p>It's been an eternity since the first presidential debate of this election cycle \u2013 or at least it seems like one. Yet, only 17 questions (not including follow-ups) have been asked of the presidential candidates so far, and nearly two-thirds of them came from <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/17/obama-romney-town-hall-debate-decoder\">Tuesday's town hall</a>. </p> <p>Jim Lehrer, for his part, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/04/obama-romney-debate-decoder\">asked only six questions</a> in the first debate, and those covered just four topics: the economy, healthcare, the role of government, and \"governing\", as he broke it down. <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/blogs/media/2012/10/foreign-policy-debate-topics-138341.html\">Another six questions are expected to come out of the final debate</a>. </p> <p>The town hall format did better. Besides asking more questions overall, audience members' phrasing was more personal and more unexpected. Questions included one on gun rights, one on immigration, and one on women's rights in the workplace.</p> <p>The final question count should be 23, if we take tonight's upcoming debate into account, and that seems meager \u2013 especially since candidates don't always even answer them. </p> <h2>3. Questions on domestic policy have outplayed foreign</h2> <p>Over two presidential debates so far, 16 questions have been asked about domestic policy, and one exclusively on foreign. Another six foreign policy questions should come out of the final debate. </p> <p>Since the first and last debates are dedicated to domestic and foreign policy respectively \u2013 with the same number of questions in each \u2013 it's the second debate, the town hall, that can tip the equation towards domestic or foreign issues. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/17/obama-romney-town-hall-debate-decoder\">Out of the 11 questions asked during the town hall debate</a> on Tuesday night, only one \u2013 on the recent controversy over the Benghazi attacks \u2013 was squarely focused on foreign policy. The other 10 covered domestic issues, from gun rights to immigration to jobs and taxes.</p> <p>In an election that <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2012/10/this-one-economic-indicator-not-the-debates-might-decide-the-election/263260/\">remains tightly tied to the state of the economy</a>, it may come as little surprise that it was the most talked about issue of the two presidential debates so far. In fact, the subject was dedicated three questions in each debate \u2013 including the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/12/biden-ryan-vp-debate-decoder\">vice-presidential match-up</a>. That's the most question any one category was allotted by a wide margin. Subtopics included jobs, entitlements, taxes, and more.</p> <h2>4. Attacks take up most of the candidates' time \u2013 and ours</h2> <p>\"Attack dog\" may traditionally be the VP candidate's role, but we found that Romney and Obama weren't averse to some mudslinging of their own. In the first debate we saw the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/04/obama-romney-debate-decoder#responsegraph\">president clock in 11 jabs to Romney's 16</a>. The town hall setting of the second debate should have arguably been less attack-friendly since the candidates have to answer real audience members in real time, but that wasn't the case. </p> <p>Both Romney and Obama about doubled their attack counts this Tuesday: <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/17/obama-romney-town-hall-debate-decoder#responsegraph\">Obama coming in with 27 hits and Romney with 25</a>. The veeps took their attacking seriously too, each putting in a whopping 30+ individual attacks during their first and only showdown. </p> <h2>5. The candidates have been light on details</h2> <p>Martha Raddatz pushed the two VP candidates for \"specifics\" many times during the vice-presidential debate \u2013 but her performance turned out to be more of an exception than a rule. In the second presidential match, Candy Crowley's follow-ups were more clear and forceful than Lehrer's in the first as she attempted to get at nuances between the candidates. But the challenges to provide detailed plans largely came from the candidates themselves in the form of attacks \u2013 though these arguments hardly made up for the lack of \"specifics\" we got from both sides.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/ezraklein/posts/165161553607752\">The Washington Post's Ezra Klein posted to Facebook</a> that we shouldn't interpret Obama's vague responses to mean that he doesn't have a plan for a second term. \"It's just a hard one to campaign on,\" he wrote. \"After promising in 2008 to bring about a new era of co-operation in Washington, they're campaigning in 2012 knowing that, if re-elected, they will start their second term with a brutal, economy-shaking showdown with Republicans over spending and taxes.\"</p> <h2>6. No one is really in charge </h2> <p>Presidential debates are presented as almost platonic models of the democratic process \u2013 with clear-cut rules and processes. The debate commission sets the stage (both figuratively and literally) \u2013 making sure the candidates arrive, shake hands, exchange ideas, and the moderator gives them a slap on the wrist if they get out of line. In the end, one of the two men on stage is declared the winner. That's how it works theoretically. In reality, each and every debate is an ongoing negotiation among the moderators, debate commission, campaigns and candidates. </p> <p>Just take look at the moderators: the three so far \u2013 Lehrer and Crowley in presidential and Raddatz in the VP debate \u2013 have delivered very different performances. Lehrer was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/04/obama-romney-debate-decoder#talk\">largely criticised</a> for his light-handedness with the candidates. Raddatz's more forceful push for \"specifics\" <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/12/biden-ryan-vp-debate-decoder#talk\">earned her quite a bit of praise</a>. Crowley fell somewhere in between. She suffered many interruptions by an aggressive Romney and Obama, but kept on fighting to keep pace. She also made headlines with a live fact-check, though this move received mixed reviews. But no matter how any of the moderators did, all three seem to struggle with the same problem: it's hard to establish and keep control, especially since no one really has to play by the rules.</p> <p>The irony, is, of course, that the candidates sign off to <a href=\"http://www.scribd.com/fullscreen/110073567?access_key=key-22or579qflh51vnl1a09\">the commission's debate rules</a>, which include taking turns to answer a question rather than interrupting, and not asking each other direct questions. </p> <p>The moderators, topics, and locations are decided by the campaigns in advance of the debates. Just take a look at the <a href=\"http://thepage.time.com/2012/10/15/the-2012-debates-memorandum-of-understanding-between-the-obama-and-romney-campaigns/\">official debate memorandum</a> obtained by Time's Mark Halperin. On page eight is where the campaigns agreed that during the 16 October debate the moderator should not ask follow-up questions.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/oct/16/us-presidential-debates-us-elections-2012-candy-crowley-obama-romney\">As Jay Rosen put it</a> in a recent piece for the Guardian: \"No one is really in charge of the presidential debates. The situation is in charge.\"</p>",
  "<p>With seismic changes planned for school exams and undergraduate fee increases still fresh, the government might have hoped to keep postgraduate issues tucked safely away in a study. But it would do so at the UK's peril, suggests a report to be published next week.</p> <p>In it, the Higher Education Commission, a cross-party group of MPs and representatives from business and academia, paints a dire picture of the country's economic future and global position unless postgraduate education is \"brought in from the cold\" and treated as part of a holistic vision for education.</p> <p>It describes postgraduates as \"the new frontier of widening participation\", arguing that while postgraduate qualifications are increasingly becoming the norm for many professions and careers, higher undergraduate fees and banks' unwillingness to offer loans make this level of study less and less accessible for poorer or debt-averse students.</p> <p>\"If we don't pay attention \u2026 this area of education will be closed to some people because of cost and accessibility,\" says Graham Spittle, chair of the commission. \"We will probably not be able to grow the indigenous talent we need to staff our universities, which, if you like, are the factories that groom the next generation. We are probably hindering ourselves from getting the strong technical leaders and entrepreneurs that society is going to need \u2013 that we're all going to need \u2013 in the future.\"</p> <p>The commission, he says, found clear evidence that students did not want to increase their level of debt by going on to postgraduate study and some had already decided against it for that reason.</p> <p>Referring to postgraduate education as a \"social-mobility timebomb\", the report echoes Alan Milburn, former Labour minister, now government adviser, who called last week for universities to make more efforts to help students from disadvantaged backgrounds. Milburn used the same phrase in an <a href=\"http://www.hecsu.ac.uk/current_projects_graduate_market_trends.htm\" title=\"\">interview with the Higher Education Careers Services Unit's magazine</a> earlier this year, adding: \"Everyone agrees that nobody should be barred from undergraduate education because they can't afford fees, and yet we completely accept this barrier when it comes to postgraduate education. The fact is, postgraduate education is not a luxury for the individual, it is a necessity for our economy and wider society.\" His fear was that the problem required money and there was not much of that around.</p> <p>The commission's report says to avoid spending on postgraduates would be a false economy, warning that \"education and skills is one of the key fronts on which the battle to maintain competitiveness will be fought\", with India, China and South Korea proving an increasing threat.</p> <p>Spittle says: \"Some of this will cost money, but the opportunity cost is unbelievable given that we want to become a skills-based economy. I think we have no choice but to pay attention to this area. It doesn't all have to be funded out of the public purse, but we need to strategically make choices as a country about what we are doing here and not just let market forces take their effect.\"</p> <p>The report agrees with Milburn's proposals last week that some kind of postgraduate loan scheme is needed, and goes further, calling for a taskforce to be set up immediately to look into how it might work, reporting by December next year with a view to having something in place by September 2015, when the first undergraduates to pay \u00a39,000 tuition fees will be graduating. This should please students, who have been looking for clear recognition that financial help for postgraduates is urgently needed.</p> <p>There are even suggestions of different loan schemes that could be considered, including one drafted by Tim Leunig, now an adviser to the education secretary, Michael Gove, which could help propel the idea through parliament.</p> <p>In the long term, the report suggests, undergraduate and postgraduate funding should be integrated. It also proposes that future postgraduate applications should be processed, like those of undergraduates, through the Universities and Colleges Admissions Service. This would make it easier to monitor admissions data, including information about the socio-economic backgrounds of students.</p> <p>This idea of a more seamless sector is perhaps not surprising from a commission specifically set up to take a broad, strategic view. This is its first report and it will decide at a meeting this week what to tackle next.</p> <p>Postgraduates were chosen as the first area to look at because they were seen as a neglected part of the sector, in spite of a review carried out just over two years ago by Adrian Smith, now vice-chancellor of the University of London. This identified a need for more information about postgraduates and called for Lord Browne to consider how they should be funded in his report on student finance, then in the pipeline.</p> <p>In the event, Lord Browne's report hardly touched on this part of the sector, and the Smith review was largely overtaken by a change of government and the impact of higher undergraduate fees, although there has been much more emphasis since on postgraduate data collection.</p> <p>Spittle says that nothing in the commission's report contradicts Smith's review but \"the world is a very different place\". \"We refer to a perfect storm facing students today. And that is something that is new and was not around three years ago.\"</p> <p>What has also changed is the government's stance on immigration, with tougher visa regulations making it harder for postgraduates to stay on after they finish their studies and the government's pledge to reduce immigration to \"tens of thousands a year\".</p> <p>The commission warns that the higher education sector would be \"significantly damaged, particularly at postgraduate level,\" were this pledge realised, with many courses in strategically important disciplines relying on international students to remain viable. It predicts course and even departmental closures and long-term damage to British research capacity and competitiveness, and calls for students to be removed from the immigration cap completely.</p> <p>Recent proposals by the universities minister, David Willetts, to produce disaggregated immigration figures for students are not enough, it says, warning of a \"climate of uncertainty for prospective and current international students which does not inspire confidence for those considering investing in a British university education\", not helped by 14 changes to student immigration regulations since 2009. It is also concerned that making it harder for postgraduates to stay on after their degrees means the UK is in effect training its competitors, becoming \"the education outsourcing capital of the world\".</p> <p>The commission has strong words for the government but there remain question marks over whether it will have any teeth. Spittle says he has spoken to Willetts about the report and, while he is non-committal about the minister's reaction, says he is \"optimistic\" that it will lead to action because of the broad spread of opinion it reflects \u2013 from politicians on all sides of both Houses of Parliament, students, universities and business \u2013 and the degree of consensus reached.</p> <p>He also believes the time is right. \"I&#xa0;think we have to look at the whole system end to end, starting with young children, all the way through their schooling, through university, to right at the high end of that process,\" he says.</p> <p>As chief technology officer of IBM and a former chair of the Technology Strategy Board, with an MA in geography from Edinburgh University, Spittle says systems thinking shows that actions taken early on in a cycle have a significant impact down the line. \"I don't think this is a minority game,\" he says. \"I think this is a very important part of the UK economy. I think it's also a very important part of social mobility.\"</p>",
  "<p>DNA samples have confirmed that the man killed in a shootout with Mexican marines earlier this month and whose body was removed from a funeral home the following day was Heriberto Lazcano, the head of the Zetas drug cartel, a senior US diplomat said on Monday.</p> <p>Mexico said it intends to exhume the druglord's parents to verify the genetic match, but William Brownfield, the US state department's top drug policy official, said Washington was already sure that the dead man was Lazcano, and that his killing reflected the Zetas cartel's implosion and a possible turning point in the war on drugs in Mexico.</p> <p>\"We know they got this guy because they were able to pull enough DNA off the body before the body was retrieved from the funeral home where it was obviously not carefully secured,\" ambassador Brownfield, the US assistant secretary of state for the bureau of international narcotics and law enforcement affairs, told the Guardian during a visit to London. \"So there is near 100% certainty that he is gone.\"</p> <p>\"The Zetas are on the run,\" Brownfield said. \"They are being pounded by the Mexican government which has devoted a lot of attention to the Zetas because, among organisations that are incredibly vicious and bloody the Zetas are probably the worst of them.</p> <p>\"Second, the Zetas are being devoured by the two other principal cartels, the Gulf cartel and the Sinaloa cartel who, in a marriage from hell, have got together to decimate the Zetas.\"</p> <p>Brownfield said that as a consequence of this two-sided assault, the most formidable narcotics organisation in Mexico, is now in its death throes.</p> <p>\"I lived through this with the Medellin and the Cali cartels and I think I know what the death throttle of a dying drug cartel sounds like, and it sounds like indiscriminate killing and ... a decapitation of your command and control so 19 year-old kids with virtually no education whatsoever are making decisions. It sounds like parts of the organisation turning on other parts of the organisation,\" the US diplomat said.</p> <p>Brownfield, a long-serving ambassador in Latin America, predicted that a rival cartel would now wrest the Zetas' dominant position in the drugs trade, and that US and Mexican policy would then be to target the usurper, and so on, until the trafficking gangs were forced elsewhere.</p> <p>\"You take them down one by one. You don't try to take on all organised crime at the same time and you whittle them down until the target has been neutralised and to a large extent killed off by fellow criminals. And then you pick your next target and you do that two or three times and then eventually the law of market economics come into play and the criminal organisation says [this is getting] really expensive \u2026 and they say let's go do business somewhere else,\" Brownfield said.</p> <p>\"That is when Mexico will become a much more peaceful and livable country. My own view is we are already crossed the point of return. It will probably be two years before we know for sure, but my own view is that we hit that turning point during the course of this year in Mexico.\" He said that cocaine consumption in the US had dropped 40% over the six years and Colombian cocaine production has dropped by more than a half over roughly the same period.</p> <p>Adam Isacson, of the independent Washington Office on Latin America agreed that the drug wars were becoming less bloody but cautioned that the flow of drugs northwards has been largely unaffected, with marijuana and heroin taking the place of cocaine as American tastes change. \"The violence statistics are beginning to go down and in a few years they may be substantially down, but I would be surprised if the flow of drugs through Mexico are very different from what they are now..</p> <p>\"What is happening is that you are seeing less violence often through the different configuration of the cartels who are choosing to go about their business in a different way. It is a grim grinding war of attrition, but it shows you can change the cartels' behaviour to be more pacific, more discreet, using bribery for example more than violence.\"</p> <p>Colombia still supplies the overwhelming bulk of cocaine bound for the US. Most is flown out through Honduras, from where it is sent on by river and road through Mexico, making the country's lawless northern jungle the new front in the drug war.</p> <p>Brownfield compared the battle to close the flow of drugs into the US to squeezing a balloon. \"In 2000, we squeezed the balloon hard in Colombia. One impact thereof was to push trafficking organisations to move their operations to Mexico.</p> <p>\"Four years ago, we began to squeeze that balloon hard in Mexico and the logical result is a transfer of their operational bases to Central America. Beginning this year we are beginning to squeeze pretty hard in the northern triangle of Central America: Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras.\"</p> <p>Brownfield said that pilot schemes in Guatemala and Honduras, in which community aid and police support are focused on \"model precincts\" had been proven to be effective. But US joint operations in Honduras have been suspended after the Honduran air force shot down two small planes, and US counter-narcotics agents got involved in firefights in which civilians were alleged to have been killed. \"They jumped out of the gate a bit fast and now they have had to put it on hold,\" Isacson said.</p> <p>Brownfield said: \"I agree it takes time. At the end of the day the one thing I would suggest is: we don't have to create paradise in Central America to drive the traffickers away. We only have to increase their costs of doing business by about 10% and at that stage the law of market economics takes over and they'll move their business away.\"</p>",
  "<p>The Green party's presidential candidate has called Barack Obama a \"climate denier\" for failing to talk about climate change during the elections.</p> <p>On the eve of the third and final presidential debate, the Green party's <a href=\"http://www.jillstein.org/\" title=\"\">Jill Stein</a> said Obama's failure to speak out about environmental concerns made him virtually identical to Republicans who deny the human causes of global warming.</p> <p>The absence of climate change from the elections, after a year of record temperatures, wildfires and drought, has hugely frustrated environmental campaigners.</p> <p>Obama and Mitt Romney, who has expressed doubt about the human causes of climate change and the viability of renewable energy such as wind power, have failed to address the issue in their last two presidential debates.</p> <p>But no campaigner has gone as far as Stein, who said Obama was \"another climate denier who basically sold out with just a little bit of window dressing\".</p> <p>When challenged about the use of the word \"denier\", Stein said: \"We sure didn't hear him talking about climate in his debate. In either of these debates we don't hear him talking about climate and the devastation of it. Whether he is a denier or just a silencer, he has certainly silenced any discussion of the issue that would motivate real solutions.\"</p> <p>Stein, a Harvard-trained doctor, <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/10/16/hofstra-debate-jill-stein-arrested-green-party_n_1971960.html?utm_hp_ref=elections-2012\" title=\"\">was arrested trying to gain entry to last week's presidential debate</a>. Her arrest has focused attention on the exclusion of third-party candidates from such events.</p> <p>The Green party is on the ballot in 38 states, but is still polling at only about 2%. It is still viewed negatively by many on the left for its role in costing Al Gore the 2000 election.</p> <p>When the third and last presidential debate takes place on Monday night, Stein will be in San Francisco taking part in a virtual debate with other third-party candidates in a forum hosted by Amy Goodman's <a href=\"http://www.democracynow.org/\" title=\"\">Democracy Now</a>.</p> <p>Obama and Romney have yet to face a direct question on climate change in the debates, and they have given scant attention to environmental concerns, even during their long and heated exchange on oil drilling and gas prices during last week's debate.</p> <p>Obama, far from touting his biggest green achievement of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/jul/29/barack-obama-fuel-economy-standards\" title=\"\">raising car mileage standards</a>, used the debate to talk up his support for oil and coal.</p> <p>\"It is outrageous they will not even mention this devastating reality we are facing,\" said Stein, ticking off the growing evidence of climate change in the widespread US drought and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/sep/14/arctic-sea-ice-smallest-extent\" title=\"\">unprecedented melting in the Arctic</a>. \"The climate catastrophe that used to be generations away is rapidly closing in on us.\"</p> <p>The larger environmental groups have hesitated to criticise Obama very openly for fear of costing him votes during an increasingly close election. Environmental groups are mainly supporting Obama and Democratic candidates for Congress in these elections.</p> <p>In Stein's view that too is a mistake. Obama has failed to live up to his 2008 campaign promise to save a \"planet in peril\", she said. \"I wasn't fooled by Obama then. I was not persuaded and a lot of other people were. The talk is very different from the walk,\" she said. \"These last four years have been drill baby drill and far worse. Obama's adopted the fossil fuel policies of George Bush and done far worse,\" she said.</p> <p>A second Obama term, Stein said, would amount to \"climate devastation with a friendly face and a warm endearing personality\".</p> <p>She went on to argue that a Romney victory in November would not be that great a loss for the environment - despite the Republican's promises to do away with environmental protections and Obama's moves to curb coal plant emissions.</p> <p>Stein, who is from Massachusetts, has direct experience of a Romney administration from his time as governor there. \"Flip-flopping is his downfall, but it is also his political instinct to go with the squeaky wheel,\" she said. That suggested Romney would be little different, as president, than Obama.</p> <p>\"I think it's really important to hold Obama equally accountable, and it is an absolutely false choice to tell people they have to choose one or the other,\" Stein said. \"Obama is not going to get us out of here alive. His climate policies are just as devastating.\"</p>",
  "<p>On the three-hour bus trip from the southern port city of Xiamen to central Fujian province, you move into a landscape of largely abandoned villages, once the homes of so many departed Chinese migrants. Here, around Fuzhou and the counties of Lianjiang, Changle, Fuqing and Putian, tens of thousands of villagers have left in the past three decades, driven away by low agricultural incomes and land developments that left them without compensation or livelihood. Seeking new ways to survive, they headed in waves for Japan, the US and Europe, including the UK.</p> <p>These villages, mainly occupied by the elderly, contain a mixture of old, shabby farmhouses and new mansions, built with money sent home by undocumentedmigrant workers toiling in sweatshop factories, restaurants, takeaways and building sites. They are also the hometowns of the cocklepickers <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2004/feb/06/china.uk\" title=\"who drowned\">who drowned</a> at Morecambe Bay in 2004.</p> <p>More than 40 Chinese workers were picking cockles there in the evening of 5 February 2004, sent by their recruiter and manager, Ah Ren, who was <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2004/feb/07/china.immigration1\" title=\"facing fierce competition\">facing fierce competition</a> from other Chinese teams along the Bay. To maximise profits, Ah Ren cut out the local middleman and gangmaster who bought cockles from him and controlled the production.

They were stranded between deep, water-filled gullies. With no sign of rescue, the workers began calling their families. They cried, and said goodbye. Some drowned before their families could call back.</p> <p>The bodies of 21 men and women, aged 18 to 45, were recovered from the Bay in the days that followed. The 22nd, Liu Qinying, wasn't found until autumn 2010. One was never found. All but one of the victims were from Fujian. Their families lost husbands, wives and parents, and were left owing mountains of debt to moneylenders.</p> <p>I reported on the tragedy at the time and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2006/mar/28/comment.immigration\" title=\"researched the background to the exploitation of Chinese migrant workers\">researched the background to the exploitation of Chinese migrant workers</a>.

Liying looked frail and worn out, but was strong in spirit, as she had been in her letters and phone calls. She had supported her orphaned nephew, Xu Bin, with the income from her job as an assistant to an overseas Chinese businessman. In fact, the whole family's livelihood \u2013 her father, sister, daughter and unemployed husband \u2013 depended on her. Xu Bin had studied hard and passed the university extrance exam. He wanted to fulfill his parents' ambition for him, and was planning to go to Britain to further his studies before building a career back home.</p> <p>Liying and I went to visit a woman named Jinyun in her village near Fuqing. The winding lanes led to a semi-furnished two-storey house where she lived with her entire family. We talked on an old couch set against the concrete walls. I had been exchanging letters with Jinyun and her two sons, who were in high school when their father, Lin Guo Guang, drowned in Morecambe Bay. \"Guo Guang's first job in England was on a building site where he got paid \u00a340 a day,\" Jinyun said. \"That was why he resorted to cockling.\" Jinyun has brought up her sons on her own, working as a nanny and earning \u00a360 a month. By summer 2009, she had managed to pay off half the debt of 200,000 yuan (\u00a320,000) left by her husband (the remainder was paid by donations from the UK). \"I&#xa0;pretend he's still working in England and just hasn't sent money home,\" she said. \"It's much easier than thinking he's gone forever.\"</p> <p>Back in Putian, a town with few industries apart from the odd shoe and garment factory, Liying and I walked the dusty lanes to the local market where we met Mr and Mrs Lin, parents of Lin Zhifang, at 18 the youngest of those who drowned. They had come down from their home in the mountains to sell dragon eyes (a fruit similar to lychees) and sugarcane. Mr Lin said they had stopped working the land as the income was too small to live on. Now they depend on selling fruit in the market for a living. \"Zhifang had worked in a factory for two years before leaving. He was our eldest son, and what he wanted most was to build a house for the family,\" Mr Lin said. \"He could never have done it working in Putian.\"</p> <p>The burden of debt after Zhifang's death meant his younger brother had to work in the factory rather than go to university. Zhifang's mother couldn't speak much Mandarin but listened intently, and asked her husband to translate what she wanted to say. Several times she looked down, remembering the loss of her son, and wept.</p> <p>Zhifang's parents seemed to have swallowed the pain of losing their son in such a modest way, as if misfortunes were inevitable for those born into the life of peasants. They had moved on and toiled away for the little cash that would keep them from starving. Their endless strength was humbling.</p> <p>Liying and I then travelled to the outskirts of Fuzhou to see Yan Chun, the widow of Dong Xin Wu, who was 39 when he drowned. He had been a cobbler in Fuzhou and migrated to the UK to work for his family. Yan Chun lives in a village with her mother and mother-in-law, who suffers from dementia, and lives on state support of only 150 yuan (\u00a315) a month. The cost of medication has been a huge burden, even after a medical insurance system was introduced: \"It's a joke. Patients can only claim insurance if they are hospitalised, and then only 20% of the costs,\" a neighbour who helps look after Dong's mother told me.</p> <p>Yan Chun works as a cleaner in an insurance company, earning up to \u00a380 a month. Her son had wanted to serve in the army in Tibet, where he could earn 100,000 yuan and help clear the family's debts. (Most of the army in Tibet and Xinjiang, the \"troubled regions\", are recruited from the impoverished countryside.) But Yan Chun wouldn't let him go. She said she didn't want to lose him as well.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398165629\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/22/1350909809863/wives-of-migrant-workers--008.jpg\" alt=\"wives of migrant workers play cards\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Wives of migrant workers play cards. Photograph: Hsiao-Hung Pai</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Hsiao-Hung Pai</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For the widows and families of the drowned workers, the future of the next generation has always been the overriding consideration. Yet it is hard to see what chance of a secure livelihood their children have in Fujian \u2013 and China. Fujian has always lagged behind the country as a whole; under Mao, the province was much neglected and received less than 2% of the nation's capital investment. Agriculture was the mainstay, but less than 10% of the province was arable. In the late 70s, before Deng Xiaoping's reforms, Fujian was ranked 23rd of 29 provinces in GDP. Since then, although poverty has been reduced, development initiatives have been concentrated in coastal cities such as Xiamen, while much of the countryside remains neglected and open to random land appropriation by developers.</p> <p>What's left for the youth? As Liying and others kept saying: \"There are few real jobs around here.\" In villages and townships, the main work options are in low-paid manufacturing and service industries. Even with a university education, jobs in the public sector are difficult to get: connections are the key.</p> <p>When Jinyun's family had finally paid off its debts, she borrowed money and sent both her sons to study in Japan, where course fees are half those in the UK, to study and work in the catering trade. Her younger son met a Fujianese woman and got married. However, their plans were interrupted by the 2011 earthquake and tsunami \u2013 Jinyun was anxious and asked them to return to China. Now her younger son is working for a relative in the timber business; her elder son is jobless.</p> <p>The desire for betterment still motivates many Fujianese to migrate. Today, the immigration cap on non-EU migrants has closed off legitimate routes, while the strengthening of the EU's border controls has made overland smuggling even more expensive. Given all this, many Fujianese parents look for other ways to send their children to Britain, often as students or&#xa0;asylum-seeking orphans.</p> <p>Those who come as orphans are among Britain's most vulnerable young migrants. They leave home for the first time and arrive in a country they know little about as unaccompanied minors. They then claim asylum and are put into social care. Some may be granted refugee status; others disappear into the informal economy, where they tend to work in the lowest-paid jobs in catering and service industries and are exploited \u2013 just like their predecessors. When I look at these young men and women, I remember the tanned faces of the workers, kneeling down to rake the shiny black cockles under the sun and rain, in order to send money home.</p> <p>As a Fujianese woman whose whole family had migrated told me: \"Our migrating ancestors left us with this legacy: You mustn't sit and take what is thrown at you in life. You must always endeavour to improve your living standards. You must do better.\"</p>",

Hassan played a \u201chigh-stakes\u201d game both in investigating Hezbollah\u2019s role in the 2005 murder of former prime minister Rafiq Hariri, and the arrest that he organised in August of Michel Samaha, a minister linked to the Syrian government, over terrorism allegations.</p> <p><a href=\"http://audioboo.fm/boos/1019746-wissam-al-hassan-s-killing-could-spark-lebanon-s-combustible-mix-despite-calls-for-calm-from-future-movement-says-qifanabki\">Speaking on a noisy Skype line</a> he said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Lebanon is very combustible. This current situation is especially dangerous because of the fractiousness of the Sunni community and the lack of control that [former prime minister] Saad Hariri and his Future Movement can exert over certain elements of the population, who are very angry and want to see more a proactive stance in support of the Syrian revolution, and are fed up with assassination after assassination and by what they see as Hezbollah\u2019s military dominance. This could easily become the straw that broke the camel's back. It could lead to the kind of civil violence that everybody has been trying to prevent.</p> </blockquote> <p>But for now the opposition Future Movement is making all the right noises, Muhanna said. He was encouraged by Hariri\u2019s attempt to rein in the radical demands of some Sunni groups. \u201cHariri doesn\u2019t want to assume power at this point - given all that\u2019s happening in Syria,\" he said. But there needs to be political consensus for cooler heads to prevail, he argued.</p> <p>\u201cIf they can find a way of containing the situation and keeping [prime minister Najib] Mikati in power then they may be able to return in some ways to the status quo,\" Muhanna said.</p> <p>There is as yet no evidence pointing to a link to Syria, Muhanna pointed out. But he said there is a long history of assassination of Lebanese figures who act against Syria\u2019s interests in Lebanon.</p> <p>It is impossible to tell whether Hezbollah was involved Hassan\u2019s killing, Muhanna noted. But he added:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I think it is fair to say that Hezbollah does not gain by a situation in which Lebanon is pulled into sectarian violence. Hezbollah has really tried to insulate Lebanon from the Syrian crisis.</p> </blockquote> <p>Leaked documents have suggested that Hassan had regular contact with one of Hezbollah\u2019s security chiefs. \u201cHe was really somebody who lived inbetween the spaces between Damascus and Beirut,\u201d Muhanna said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-canonical-url=\"\" >  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;ab-player&quot; data-boourl=&quot;http://audioboo.fm/boos/1019746-wissam-al-hassan-s-killing-could-spark-lebanon-s-combustible-mix-despite-calls-for-calm-from-future-movement-says-qifanabki/embed&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://audioboo.fm/boos/1019746-wissam-al-hassan-s-killing-could-spark-lebanon-s-combustible-mix-despite-calls-for-calm-from-future-movement-says-qifanabki&quot;&gt;listen to &amp;#x2018;Wissam al-Hassan&amp;#x27;s killing could spark Lebanon&amp;#x27;s combustible mix despite calls for calm from Future Movement says @QifaNabki&amp;#x2019; on Audioboo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;(function() { var po = document.createElement(&quot;script&quot;); po.type = &quot;text/javascript&quot;; po.async = true; po.src = &quot;http://d15mj6e6qmt1na.cloudfront.net/assets/embed.js&quot;; var s = document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;)[0]; s.parentNode.insertBefore(po, s); })();&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-10-22T15:14:00.352Z\">at 4.14pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5085484cc0e343ef1abc7e24\" class=\"block is-summary\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-22T13:21:17.089Z\">2.21pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Turkish-Syrian tensions</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Turkey has rejected Israeli calls for talks on the Syria crisis, as analysts express concern about Ankara's increasing aggression towards Syria.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.todayszaman.com/newsDetail_getNewsById.action?newsId=296024\">According to the Turkish daily Zaman</a> the calls for talks came from Pinhas Avivi, a former Israeli ambassador to Turkey and current political director of the Israeli foreign ministry.</p> <p>He suggested Syria and Turkey should both acknowledge mistakes over border violence, to avoid the tension escalating further.</p> <p>Most analysts believe Turkey wants to avoid war with Syria despite Ankara's belligerent rhetoric.</p> <p>But a new paper for the International Institute for Strategic Studies predicted that increased <a href=\"http://www.iiss.org/publications/strategic-comments/past-issues/volume-18-2012/october/turkeys-frustrations-grow-with-syrian-civil-war\">military tension and even some form of intervention is still a possibility</a>.</p> <p>It said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Recent events suggest that Turkey's policy towards Syria has entered a new and more aggressive phase. Ankara appears determined to increase the pressure on the Assad regime, raising the possibility of increased Turkish aid to the FSA and even artillery support, from inside Turkey, for Free Syrian Army operations in Syria.</p> <p>The likelihood of a war between Turkey and Syria remains remote. But the new impetuousness of the Turkish approach is a cause for concern. It would be a mistake to underestimate the AKP's frustration at Assad's continued hold on power, Nato allies' refusal to play a more active role in trying to overthrow him and the emergence of a Kurdish enclave inside Syria. Although it currently appears small, there is nevertheless a danger that sustained \u2013 or even increased \u2013 military tensions could generate a momentum that could drag Turkey deeper into a highly complex conflict from which it would be hard to extricate itself.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-10-22T13:42:59.320Z\">at 2.42pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-50853a37c0e343ef1abc7e1f\" class=\"block is-summary\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-22T12:21:11.766Z\">1.21pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Lebanese army warning</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Lebanon's army has called for calm amid reports that the latest wave of violence has eased.</p> <p>Reuters reports: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Lebanon's army said on Monday the nation faced a critical phase after the assassination of a senior intelligence officer prompted violent protests across the country.</p> <p>\"We call on all political leaders to be cautious when expressing their stances and opinions,\" said a statement by the army, adding that it would take \"decisive measures\" to prevent chaos in areas of high tension.</p> </blockquote> <p>Journalists in Beirut said overnight violence, which killed at least two people, appears to be over for now.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/mitchprothero/status/260347904961687552\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Streets in <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search/%23Beirut\">#Beirut</a> reach uneasy calm but unclear if Army in control or if this is a just a break before nightfall. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search/%23Lebanon\">#Lebanon</a></p>&mdash; mitchell prothero (@mitchprothero) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mitchprothero/status/260347904961687552\" data-datetime=\"2012-10-22T11:52:32+00:00\">October 22, 2012</a></blockquote> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/javierespinosa2/status/260342863076921344\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Clashes over in <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search/%23beirut\">#beirut</a>,lots of army vehicles around Tarik al Jedid <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search/%23Lebanon\">#Lebanon</a></p>&mdash; JAVIER ESPINOSA (@javierespinosa2) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/javierespinosa2/status/260342863076921344\" data-datetime=\"2012-10-22T11:32:30+00:00\">October 22, 2012</a></blockquote> </figure>  <p><a href=\"http://www.fco.gov.uk/en/travel-and-living-abroad/travel-advice-by-country/middle-east-north-africa/lebanon\">Britain's foreign office has updated its travel advice to Lebanon</a> in the wake of Friday's bomb attack and ensuing violence.

He said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>As it stands right now, this aggressive posture doesn\u2019t appear to be stamping out some of the more militant activity. In many cases roads will be closed and then reopen later. It is just not clear right now whether there is enough security forces in Beirut to get a handle on things.</p> </blockquote> <p>There has been a heavy security presence in the areas of Qasqas, Tariq al-Jdideh, Cola Bridge, which Prothero described as \u201csectarian fault lines\u201d.</p> <p>The casualty count will be critical in the next couple of days, he said. If there is significant bloodshed there is a danger that the cycle of sectarian violence could spin out of control, he predicted. </p> <p><a href=\"http://audioboo.fm/boos/1019253-mitchprothero-says-beirut-security-forces-struggling-to-contain-syria-related-sectarian-violence-after-friday-s-bomb-attack\">Speaking to the Guardian from Beirut</a>, Prothero said: \"I fear the security forces have until this evening to get this over with, with the minimum of casualties or we could see an ongoing situation.\"</p> <p>He said the scale of the violence and uncertainty feels different from previously Syria-related sectarian tension in Lebanon.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We are used to a certain amount of sectarian tension that mimics the situation in Syria, popping off in the northern city of Tripoli where there has been a great deal of tension between pro-Syrian and anti-Syrian Sunni Muslim factions ... But what we are seeing since the killing of General Wissam al-Hassan is that this has really spread to Beirut.</p> </blockquote> <p>The Syrian government is widely believed to be behind the attack, he said. It is difficult to imagine any other suspects for the killing, given Hassan's record of investigating Syria\u2019s influence in violence in Lebanon, Prothero said.</p> <p>Sunni anger at the bombing appears to be spontaneous and leaderless, he pointed out. \"While it doesn\u2019t appear to be organised on the Sunni side it appears to be spreading all across the city, making it very difficult for the security forces,\" he said. </p> <p>The Sunni opposition lack strong leadership, he said. Exiled former prime minister Saad Hariri did not return to the country for yesterday\u2019s funeral, Prothero noted. </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>At this point he\u2019s a voice on a television screen, or a Skype or <a href=\"https://twitter.com/HaririSaad\">Twitter accoun</a>t. Thus not really connecting with the Sunni streets.</p> </blockquote> <p>For its part, the militant Shia group Hezbollah has stayed quiet since Friday\u2019s attack, focusing instead on protecting their Shia neighbourhoods, Prothero reported. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-canonical-url=\"\" >  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;ab-player&quot; data-boourl=&quot;http://audioboo.fm/boos/1019253-mitchprothero-says-beirut-security-forces-struggling-to-contain-syria-related-sectarian-violence-after-friday-s-bomb-attack/embed&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://audioboo.fm/boos/1019253-mitchprothero-says-beirut-security-forces-struggling-to-contain-syria-related-sectarian-violence-after-friday-s-bomb-attack&quot;&gt;listen to &amp;#x2018;@mitchprothero says Beirut security forces struggling to contain Syria-related sectarian violence after Friday&amp;#x27;s bomb attack &amp;#x2019; on Audioboo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;(function() { var po = document.createElement(&quot;script&quot;); po.type = &quot;text/javascript&quot;; po.async = true; po.src = &quot;http://d15mj6e6qmt1na.cloudfront.net/assets/embed.js&quot;; var s = document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;)[0]; s.parentNode.insertBefore(po, s); })();&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-10-22T10:08:52.218Z\">at 11.08am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-50850f69c0e343ef1abc7e08\" class=\"block is-summary\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-22T09:18:34.028Z\">10.18am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Security raids in Lebanon</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The Lebanese army raided <a href=\"http://www.dailystar.com.lb/News/Politics/2012/Oct-22/192282-casualties-in-beirut-clashes-following-hasan-funeral.ashx#ixzz2A17DdH00\">suspected militant hideouts in several areas on Beirut\u2019s outskirts after last night's sectarian clashes</a>, the Daily Star reports.</p> <p>Its sources said fighting only stopped at about 2am when the army intervened.</p> <p>Friday's bomb attack is likely to be the <a href=\"http://www.dailystar.com.lb/News/Politics/2012/Oct-22/192291-killing-of-security-chief-raises-fears-for-lebanon.ashx#ixzz2A18mxRml\">most destabilising event in Lebanon since the 2005 assassination of former prime minister Rafik al-Hariri</a>, according to the paper's Samia Nakhoul.</p> <p>But she adds: \"Although sectarian tensions are high, Lebanese factions have no desire to return to civil war.\"</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-7909659b-9e9e-43a8-8df1-5a43eef70886\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/22/1350897495809/e2771e1a-9831-4d9b-a501-444156c3fab3-460.jpeg\" alt=\"Lebanese soldiers gather with their weapons in Kaskas, Beirut after a night of tension following the funeral of an intelligence official killed by a car bomb.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lebanese soldiers gather with their weapons in Kaskas, Beirut after a night of tension following the funeral of an intelligence official killed by a car bomb.

They consider Mikati\u2019s government to be in league with Syria over the attack.</p> <p>\u2022 <strong><a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-20024519\">US secretary of state Hillary Clinton told Lebanon that the US was willing to help investigate Friday\u2019s bomb attack, the BBC reports. </a></strong>Clinton spoke to Mikati after the funeral. A spokeswoman for the state department said: \"She noted the importance of political leaders working together at this sensitive time to ensure that calm prevails and that those responsible for the attack are brought to justice.\u201d</p> <h2>Syria</h2> <p>\u2022 <strong><a href=\"http://sana.sy/eng/21/2012/10/22/448279.htm\">President Bashar al-Assad suggested he would only back a ceasefire if western and Arab countries stopped helping the armed struggle against his government.</a></strong> After talks with international envoy Lakhdar Brahimi, the state news agency Sana said Assad insisted that \u201cany initiative or political process should be essentially based on the principle of halting terrorism and what is required in this regard from the countries involved in supporting, arming and harbouring the terrorists in Syria to halt such acts\".</p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"http://uk.reuters.com/article/2012/10/22/uk-syria-crisis-idUKBRE89K07E20121022\"><strong>Thirteen people were killed when a car bomb was set off in Damascus during Brahimi\u2019s visit.</strong> </a>&#xa0;The bomb exploded outside a police station in the mainly Christian central Bab Touma district.</p> <p>\u2022 <strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/oct/21/west-policy-syria-failure-russia-iran\">By backing one side in a civil war that neither side can win, the west's policy on Syria is failing on a monumental scale, according to former Labour minister Peter Hain.</a></strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The only way forward is to broker a political settlement, with Russia using its leverage to ensure that Assad negotiates seriously \u2026</p> <p>However unpalatable, Assad may have to be granted immunity in order to get him to sign up and stop his barbarity. All state employees, including those in the armed forces, must be allowed to keep their posts, to avoid a repeat of the chaos caused by America's de-Ba'athification in Iraq. A Yemen-type process may even figure. There, a hated president did not resign but did not stand for re-election. A coalition government of national unity could then prepare for Syrian elections, due in 2014.</p> </blockquote> <p>\u2022 <strong><a href=\"http://www.joshualandis.com/blog/?p=15984\">The US should change the balance of power in Syria by supplying rebels with anti-aircraft weapons, according to Syria watcher Joshua Landis who until now has resisted US involvement in the conflict.</a></strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The supply of portable heat-seeking missiles seems to be increasingly justified. US politicians fear that elements of the Syrian opposition may misuse ground to air missiles, but surely they cannot be misused more than Assad\u2019s jets and helicopters. Assad\u2019s air superiority, combined with his inability to rule Syria, is causing endless misery. Air power is so destructive that if it could be denied to both sides, surely fewer people would be killed.</p> </blockquote> <h2>Jordan</h2> <p>\u2022 <strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/oct/21/jordan-claims-thwarted-terror-attacks\">The authorities claim to have foiled an al-Qaida-inspired plot using arms from Syria to target western diplomats, foreign nationals and shopping centres.</a></strong> A Jordanian government spokesman Sameeh Maaytah said all 11 suspects are in police custody. He said the men had brought in arms from Syria to use them in the alleged plot and had been assisted by al-Qaida operatives based in Iraq in manufacturing home-made explosives.</p> <h2>Libya</h2> <p>\u2022 <strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/oct/21/protesters-libya-parliament-bani-walid-conflict\">Demonstrators broke into the grounds of Libya's parliament, wounding two security guards, in a protest against the continuing fighting in Bani Walid, a former stronghold of Muammar Gaddafi.</a></strong><br>Fighting in Bani Walid, 90 miles south-east of Tripoli, continued for a fifth day, with the government yet to provide proof of its assertion that Gaddafi's youngest son, Khamis, was killed in the town on Saturday.</p> <h2>Egypt</h2> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/oct/21/sonia-dridi-attacked-tahrir-square\"><strong>A journalist for France 24 has described how his female colleague was attacked and groped by a group of men while filming live during protests in Tahrir Square in Cairo on Friday night</strong>.</a> Sonia Dridi was surrounded while filming in the square, with the mob closing in on her as she was reporting.

The EU budget settlement had to be \"rigorous\", he said.</p> <p><strong>\u2022 Cameron has sidestepped questions about whether a no vote in the referendum he is proposing on a renegotiated relationship with the EU would lead to Britain leaving the EU.</strong> Although he has not formally committed himself to a referendum, he has said that he wants to renegotiate Britain's relationship with the EU and that a referendum would then be the simplest way of obtaining public consent for that. During the statement, two Tory MPs, Peter Bone and Mark Reckless, asked if a no vote would lead to Britain leaving the EU or whether it would be an \"in/in\" referendum, with a no vote endorsing the status quo. Cameron refused to answer.</p> <p><strong>\u2022 Ed Miliband has accused Cameron of weakening Britain's influence within the EU.</strong> In his response to Cameron, Miliband said <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/10/18/us-eu-britain-finland-idUSBRE89H19J20121018\">Finland's Europe minister, an Anglophile, complained at the EU summit that Britain was waving goodbye to the EU.</a></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The prime minister does not seem to realise that all his bluster about fighting for Britiain is meaningless if he alienates our natural supporters ... He really has become the guy who goes to Europe and picks a fight in an empty room - which is just as well because he normally finds himself in an empty room ...</p> <p>The reality is he has lost control of his party on Europe. We have a prime minister outside the room looking in at Britain's empty seat at the table. There's one thing that our allies in Europe and the British people can agree on: his government's a shambles and it's Britain that suffers.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>\u2022 Philip Dunne, a defence minister, has told MPs that Scotland could lose Royal Navy defence contracts if it went independent.</strong> This is what he said when he was asked about the matter at defence questions.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The UK has not built a complex warship outside these shores since the second world war; we remain committed to using UK industry to build UK warships.</p> <p>In the unlikely event that Scotland should decide to separate from the UK, the Scottish defence industry would only be eligible to bid for contracts placed by a future Scottish government, or competed for outside the UK, placed by the UK or other governments.

A law limiting maximum pay to \u00a31m a year is supported by 58 per cent. But two right-wing policies are at least as popular: 59 per cent of defectors want Britain to leave the EU, and a huge 78 per cent want \u201cnet immigration reduced to zero\u201d.</p> <p>Equally, though, activists who reassure themselves that Labour\u2019s core supporters reject such views should think again. As many as 41 per cent of loyalists also want Britain out of the EU, and two-thirds of them back zero net immigration. One of the key findings from this analysis is that Labour defectors generally hold more right-wing views than many party activists like to think\u2014but so do millions of Labour loyalists.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://dpmcbride.tumblr.com/\">\u2022 Damian McBride on his blog says David Cameron should learn from the mistakes Gordon Brown made when he tried to get his government out of crisis mode.</a></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>First, [Cameron] \u2013 like Gordon \u2013 is trying to announce his way out of the crisis, going into each Sunday morning and each PMQs with a fresh attempt to get on top of the news agenda with some random, focus group designed announcement. At its very least, this is a waste of potentially good stories and speeches which should be held back until there\u2019s a chance of them being heard; worse, it leads to the bungled announcement of half-baked policies, like the fuel bills balls-up; and worse still, it leads to ridiculous headlines like \u201cCameron: Now Mug A Hoodie\u201d.</p> <p>Second, he and his team are fighting forest fires with buckets of sand, when what they need is proper firebreaks, i.e. moments when the pre-existing political news agenda is suspended (or at least turned into a backdrop) while another issue or event comes to the fore. It could be a Budget, a Queen\u2019s Speech, a trip to Washington, a Defence White Paper: anything which obliges the political media to focus their attention elsewhere for a few days, not least \u2013 to put it crudely \u2013 if they want to get an exclusive preview. So where are the Coalition\u2019s firebreaks? The only one I can see on the horizon is George Osborne\u2019s Autumn Statement on 5th December; that feels a long time away.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/danhodges/100185933/boris-johnson-the-obama-campaigns-secret-weapon/\">\u2022 Dan Hodges on his blog says Boris Johnson is now featuring in one of Barack Obama\u2019s ads attacking Mitt Romney.</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://blogs.ft.com/gavyndavies/#axzz2A2PRFsja\">\u2022 Gavyn Davies on his FT blog explains why the latest thinking from the IMF about fiscal multipliers is so important.</a></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The [IMF] authors believe that this is because the fiscal multipliers have turned out to be higher than was assumed when the austerity programmes were designed. In fact, they suggest that the multiplier under current circumstances might be as large as 0.9-1.7, compared to the initial assumption of 0.5.</p> <p>If true, the implication of this would be critical. If the multiplier is 0.5, then an initial public expenditure reduction of 1 per cent of GDP reduces real output by 0.5 per cent. Using normal rules of thumb, this drop in output would in turn reduce taxation or increase public transfers by about 0.2 per cent of GDP, leaving the budget deficit improving by 0.8 per cent of GDP. This ratio of budget improvement to reduced growth might be just about acceptable to democratic governments.</p> <p>If, however, the multiplier is 1.7, then the same initial public spending cut of 1 per cent of GDP would reduce real output by 1.7 per cent. The second round effects of this reduction in output would reduce tax or raise transfers by 0.68 per cent. The net overall improvement in the budget deficit would therefore be only 0.32 per cent. The economy would be in recession, and the budget deficit would hardly improve at all. Even if this were acceptable to governments, it would not be acceptable for very long to their electorates.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-10-22T14:48:59.349Z\">at 3.48pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5085523a58f96784ee2908c6\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-22T14:08:09.268Z\">3.08pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>I've already posted some reaction to the David Cameron speech (or pre-reaction, because it was available before the full text of the speech was published). See 10.57am. Here's some more.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/andrew-neilson/prison-david-cameron-speech_b_1999766.html?utm_hp_ref=uk\">From Andrew Neilson, director of campaigns at the Howard League for Penal Reform</a></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It is all very well to pay providers by results but you must have a result that is meaningful in the first place.</p> <p>The Ministry of Justice is looking at paying providers on whether individuals are reconvicted or not but this is a blunt measure that does not reflect the reality of how people desist from crime. Rather than simply shift from offending to not offending like an electrical switch, people who offend tend to lead chaotic lives and slip in and out of trouble with the law.</p> <p>Sometimes progress is better measured in whether people are reoffending less seriously or less frequently than before. But that kind of progress would not be measured under current proposals, which raises questions as to what success any providers will be able to produce.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://www.rapt.org.uk/news22102012.html\">From Mike Trace, chief executive of the Rehabilitation for Addicted Prisoners Trust</a></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We welcome that David Cameron has made clear his determination to focus on \u2018making prison work\u2019 using effective rehabilitation, but this policy will only work if the government scales up its commitment to drug and alcohol rehabilitation programmes in prisons that actually succeed in reducing reoffending. It is clear from our analysis that ensuring prisoners get access to good quality drug treatment programmes will significantly help deliver the results he seeks.</p> <p>An intensive recovery approach cuts costs as well as crime. For every 100 individuals, the RAPt programme saves \u00a36.3 million on re-sentencing and re-incarcerating. This would equate to savings of \u00a3440 million a year if the programme was offered to just 10% of drug dependent prisoners.</p> </blockquote> <p>From Rhodri Davies, policy manager at the Charities Aid Foundation</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The prime minister is right that payment by results contracts have potential to help charities use their expertise to tackle intractable social problems such as reoffending.</p> <p>But ministers need to improve the way these contracts are designed so charities are not simply squeezed out in favour of large private sector providers. Most charities simply cannot afford to take on contracts to tackle social problems without up-front funding because they are not allowed to carry large financial reserves and have limited access to capital compared to for-profit businesses.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-10-22T14:13:00.309Z\">at 3.13pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-50854e4a58f96784ee2908c4\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-22T13:46:51.036Z\">2.46pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here's a Guardian video with an extract from Cameron's speech.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/video/2012/oct/22/david-cameron-crime-punishment-video\"                                data-show-ads=\"true\"                        data-video-name=\"David Cameron on crime: 'Offenders need and deserve punishment' - video\"                        > <object width=\"460\" height=\"307\"><param name=\"wmode\" value=\"opaque\"></param><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/video/embed\"></param><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\"></param><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\"></param><param name=\"flashvars\" value=\"endpoint=http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/video/2012/oct/22/david-cameron-crime-punishment-video/json\"></param><embed src=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/video/embed\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"460\" height=\"307\" flashvars=\"endpoint=http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/video/2012/oct/22/david-cameron-crime-punishment-video/json\" wmode=\"opaque\"></embed></object> </figure>  </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5085407dc0e343ef1abc7e21\" class=\"block is-summary\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-22T13:24:20.524Z\">2.24pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Lunchtime summary</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-20022794\">David Cameron has claimed that being \"tough but intelligent\" will be the hallmark of his approach to law and order</a>.</strong> In a wide-ranging speech on law and order which he used to announce the extension of payment-by-results prisoner rehabilitation, Cameron said that the best approach to criminal justice combined punishment with rehabilitation. \"It's not a case of 'prison works' or 'prison doesn't work' - we need to make prison work,\" he said.</p> <p><strong>\u2022 Cameron has dismissed some of the government's recent difficulties as \"processology\" and said that he is focusing on the \"big picture\".</strong> This is what he said when asked about claims that the government was losing its grip.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We need to focus on the big picture. What actually happened last week is that unemployment fell, inflation fell, waiting lists in our hospitals fell, crime fell, the right decision was made about Gary McKinnon. Those are the important things that are happening in an economy where we've created a million private sector jobs in the last two years. There will always be people that will go on endlessly about process and processology and Kremlinology and all the rest of it, what actually matters is what is happening out there.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>\u2022 Cameron has defended his decision to try to hang on to Andrew Mitchell as chief whip.</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It's the easiest thing in the world as prime minister to just sack someone at the drop of a hat when something goes wrong. I thought the right thing to do was to make sure there was a proper apology.</p> <p>The police didn't want to take it further but it did become apparent he wasn't going to be able to do his job so the right conclusion was reached. It takes longer to discover whether someone can or can't do their job. It's much easier just to fire people, I actually think that is not the right approach.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>\u2022 Cameron has said that the latest developtments at the BBC, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2012/oct/22/bbc-newsnight-jimmy-savile-scandal\">where Newsnight editor Peter Rippon is termporarily stepping aside over the Jimmy Savile affair,</a> are \"concerning\".</strong> Cameron said: \"The developments today are concerning because the BBC has effectively changed its story about why it dropped the Newsnight programme about Jimmy Savile.\"</p> <p><strong>\u2022 Ministers have hinted that they are backing away from plans to allow the recall of MPs.</strong> <a href=\"http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmselect/cmpolcon/646/64604.htm#a3\">In response to a report from the Commons political and constitutional reform committee, </a>which said the plan should be abandoned, the government said its plan to allow voters to trigger a byelection where an MP is guilty of serious wrong-doing was \"an entirely novel mechanism for our political landscape\".

Around 45% of the inmates are currently in drug or alcohol rehabilitation programmes. <br>The visit allowed the prime minister to view first hand a group putting into action his vision of charities, voluntary groups and private companies providing rehabilitation services to help turn prisoners' lives around and stop them reoffending. <br>Cameron insisted that a lack of money was not an issue in bringing down the reoffending rate, saying that extending payment-by-results schemes for those helping to rehabilitate prisoners would refocus existing resources. <br>In one of the prison's courtyards, the prime minister said: \"We have got to do more for less, every place here costs \u00a340,000, there are 600 staff that work in this prison - it's not a shortage of money, it's that we haven't been focusing people on what really matters, which is the results.\" <br>Asked if it was a gamble to use private companies and charities to plug gaps, Cameron said: \"We spend billions of pounds on prison and probation but we are not getting the right results. <br>\"In terms of getting charities to do more, it's happening now. I've just been sitting in a cell with a very good drug rehab charity that's working with prisoners trying to get them off drugs, get them clean. <br>\"If that works then that prisoner won't be costing us all that money, won't be robbing houses and causing chaos and won't be returning to our prison system.\"</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-9f14c585-3a7f-4311-94c3-0060b4b1aecc\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/22/1350910653478/fea47c7f-4c26-47af-a337-3c8a26077c50-460.jpeg\" alt=\"David Cameron at Wormwood Scrubs\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Britain's prime minister David Cameron (right) is escorted by prison governor Phil Taylor as he arrives at Wormwood Scrubs prison in west London on 22 October 2012.

They are expected to know what they think, and to be principled and consistent. Yet we (at least, we in the media) are also always expecting them to say something new. It's a hard ask.</p> <p>Today Cameron managed to package his thoughts about law and order into a coherent whole quite effectively. He covered most aspects of the criminal justice system. But, as a speech, it did not really pass the \"new\" test at all. Cameron has been talking about the need for better rehabilitation and the advantages of payment-by-results for years and, although he did announce a national roll-out today, the whole point of piloting these programmes is to pave the way for national implementation, and so this did not come as a huge surprise. (And, by the way, the Peterborough scheme praised by Chris Grayling this morning - see 10.09am - <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2010/mar/19/investors-pay-for-prisoner-rehabilitation\">was launched under Labour.)</a> Cameron also rattled through various \"tougher penalty\" measures, but almost all of them had been trailed before.</p> <p>Politicians can solved the consistent/new dilemma by dreaming up a fresh slogan to explain their approach and Cameron had a go at this.

rhetoric about reducing crime.</p> <p>And, while Tony Blair had all the resources of Government behind him in 1997 to deliver his tough on crime tough on the causes of crime policy, we no longer have that luxury \u2013 and even with all the resources, Blair gave us 3,000 new criminal offences, 25,000 more prisoners and he failed to address entirely the Tough on the Causes of Crime part of the policy at all.</p> <p>Blair left us with even more of the high-crime, inner-city housing estates that existed when he came to power, and with precisely the same degree of unemployment, school exclusions, poor parenting, drug misuse and gang cultures existing when he left.</p> <p>Forced by a lack of resources to fund his policy Cameron is turning to the private and voluntary sector to help him deliver his \u2018Tough But Intelligent\u2019 policy to be announced later today, relying on a \u2018Payments By Results\u2019 method of funding it \u2013 but behind the scenes I can tell you there are huge arguments about what the \u2018Payment By Results\u2019 mechanism actually means \u2013 what \u2018results\u2019 amount to \u2018results\u2019, who assesses those \u2018results\u2019 and what level of \u2018payment\u2019 are we talking about here?</p> </blockquote> <p>From Vicki Helyar-Cardwell, director of the Criminal Justice Alliance</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>This speech was an opportunity to regain the momentum promised at the start of the coalition government to drive forward a genuine rehabilitation revolution to cut crime, prioritise prevention and reduce the damaging levels of reoffending. The danger is the intelligent bit gets lost at the expense of sounding tough.</p> <p>A truly smart approach would be to focus on offenders making amends for their wrongdoing, treating drug and alcohol addictions that can fuel crime and getting ex-offenders back into real work. Much of this relies on wider society \u2013 organisations and people outside of the criminal justice system. The real strength of the Prime Minister\u2019s 2006 so-called \u2018hug a hoodie speech\u2019 is that it recognised that criminal justice and social justice are inextricably linked. Yet several years on, the criminal justice system still often picks up the pieces when others have failed, the high levels of children in care who end up in our youth justice system are a telling example of this ...</p> <p>Criminal Justice Alliance organisations, working in prisons and with offenders and their families in the community, report that prison overcrowding and budget cuts mean rehabilitation is being undermined. Making governors more accountable for what happens after prison is welcome, but this will backfire without efforts to curb huge prison overcrowding that blights much of the positive work in prisons. Overcrowding extracts a heavy price from prisoners, prison staff and voluntary sector working to cut reoffending, and ultimately harms communities to which ex-prisoners will return.</p> <p>The Prime Minister\u2019s speech comes the week after the Chief Inspector of Prisons said that in order to deliver a rehabilitation revolution, government needs to reduce numbers of people in prison or invest more in prison budgets.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://blogs.spectator.co.uk/coffeehouse/2012/10/cameron-tries-to-avoid-crisis-management-with-tough-crime-announcement/\">From Isabel Hardman at Coffee House</a></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It\u2019s clear the government has had a bad week when the Prime Minister pops up on a Monday with a crowd-pleasing policy announcement. Recent re-launches have been shared by senior Lib Dems and Tories following the collapse of Lords reform, for example, to demonstrate that the Coalition is still working well. But today, the Lib Dems are nowhere to be seen: the Prime Minister\u2019s big crime announcement is a response to a terrible week for the Conservative party, rather than the coalition as a whole.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://conservativehome.blogs.com/thetorydiary/2012/10/toughbutintelligent.html\">From Tim Montgomerie at ConservativeHome</a></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The speech is being presented by some in the media as a response to the Government\u2019s difficult week but, in reality, the speech and whole approach has long been in the pipeline. Chris Grayling was thinking about a rehabilitation revolution when he was Shadow Home Secretary. Working with Nick Herbert and the Centre for Social Justice the Tory leadership was interested in reducing reoffending rates for most of the last seven years.</p> </blockquote> <p>From Sadiq Khan, the shadow justice secretary</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There is nothing intelligent or tough about cutting frontline police officers, reducing the power of judges to give tough sentences or cutting support for innocent victims of crime.</p> <p>This is nothing more than a smokescreen to try and cover up Andrew Mitchell losing his job on Friday and 29 wasted months of dithering on law and order. This out of touch Government must think the public are stupid - it\u2019s these kind of actions that makes the public so cynical about politicians.</p> <p>Rehashed announcements, rushed legislation and ill-thought out and evidence-free policies risk undermining public confidence in our criminal justice system.</p> <p>This is empty rhetoric from a weak Prime Minister of an incompetent government, designed only to keep rebellious Tory MPs happy rather than what works in keeping our communities safe.</p> </blockquote> <p>I'm off to the Number 10 briefing now.

That is just a \"sterile debate\", he will say. See 9.07am. (Unfortunately, this passage of the speech just sounds like a pale imitation of Tony Blair's \"tough on crime, tough on the causes of crime\". Cameron might have been better just adopting that slogan wholesale.)</p> <p><strong>\u2022 He will say that criminals deserve \"retribution\".</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Retribution is not a dirty word, it is important to society that revulsion against crime is properly recognised.</p> </blockquote> <p>(The use of the word \"retribution\" is <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2220757/David-Cameron-PM-promises-seek-retribution-law-breakers-new-anti-crime-crackdown.html\">one of the elements of the speech that excited the Mail on Sunday </a>because of its Old Testament overtones, but Cameron just seems to be using it as another word for punishment.)</p> <p><strong>\u2022 He will say that prisoners need rehabilitation because \"being tough isn't a successful strategy in itself\".</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Come with me to any prison in this country.</p> <p>There you\u2019ll meet muggers, robbers, and burglars.</p> <p>But you\u2019ll also meet young men who can\u2019t read, teenagers on drugs, people who\u2019ve never worked a day in their life.</p> <p>These people need help so they can become part of the solution and not remain part of the problem.</p> <p>Recognising this isn\u2019t soft, or liberal.</p> <p>It\u2019s common sense.</p> <p>We\u2019ll never create a safer society unless we give people, especially young people, opportunities and chances away from crime.</p> <p>Prevention is the cheapest and most effective way to deal with crime \u2013 everything else is simply picking up the pieces of failure that has gone before.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>\u2022 He will say the government will extend \"payment-by-results\" as a means of providing prisoner rehabilitation.</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>When this government came to power we were spending \u00a340,000 a year just on banging people up.</p> <p>With payment by results, your money goes into what works\u2026</p> <p>\u2026prisoners going straight, crime coming down, our country getting safer.</p> <p>It\u2019s such a good idea I want to put rocket boosters under it\u2026</p> <p>\u2026indeed today I have an announcement to make.</p> <p>By the end of 2015, I want to see payment by results spread right across rehabilitation.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>\u2022 He will say that rehabilitation programmes will be offered to prisoners serving short sentences, not just to offenders who have been jailed for a year or more, as happens now.</strong></p> <p><strong>\u2022 He will say that tackling crime is part of the \"aspiration nation\" agenda he set out in his party conference speech.</strong> \"We will not rise as a country if we leave millions behind and write off whole communities,\" he will say.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-10-22T09:05:34.473Z\">at 10.05am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5084fea658f96784ee2908a0\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-22T08:07:02.151Z\">9.07am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>David Cameron is going to give a speech on law and order later today and in it he is going to complain that politicians who speak on criminal justice are either portrayed as authoritarian, bang-\u2019em-up merchants or soppy liberals.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>For many people, I\u2019m the person associated with those three words, two of which begin with \u2018H\u2019, and one of which is \u2018hoodie\u2019\u2026</p> <p>\u2026even though I never actually said it.</p> <p>For others, I\u2019m the politician who has argued for tough punishment.</p> <p>So do I take a tough line on crime \u2013 or a touchy-feely one?</p> <p>In no other public debate do the issues get polarised like this.</p> <p>On climate change you don\u2019t have to be in denial or campaigning to get every car off the road.</p> <p>Life isn\u2019t that simple \u2013 so government policy isn\u2019t that simple.</p> <p>And yet with the crime debate, people seem to want it black or white.</p> <p>Lock \u2018em up or let \u2018em out.</p> <p>Blame the criminal or blame society.</p> <p>\u2018Be tough\u2019 or \u2018act soft\u2019.</p> </blockquote> <p>Cameron will argue that this binary approach is simplistic and he will say that he wants to \u201cmove the debate on\u201d.

  "<p>HELLO! WHAT IS THIS? THE WORK OF A FEVERED MIND, TAKING A BREAK FROM FASHIONING TINFOIL HATS TO SAY SOMETHING ON THE INTERNET? WELL, MAYBE. BUT TODAY IS ALSO <a href=\"http://www.metafilter.com/121122/YAD-KCOL-SPAC\" title=\"\">INTERNATIONAL CAPS LOCK DAY</a>. O, FRABJOUS DAY \u2013 <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caps_lock#International_Caps_Lock_Day\" title=\"\">REJOICE</a>!</p> <p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caps_lock\" title=\"\">Caps lock</a>: a tiny button with the ability to entirely change the tone of whatever missive you're crafting at your word processor. What does caps lock mean? It means you are SERIOUS, that you wish to impart information of the UTMOST IMPORTANCE, that the reader WILL NOT WANT TO MISS THIS. It means you are SHOUTING, usually borderline racist nonsense beneath a YouTube video. It is largely, but not exclusively, the preserve of the unhinged in the comments section. It is a warning, a SIGN, a useful calling card: HERE BE DRAGONS.</p> <p>A quick search on Amazon throws up this $83 book, <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Control-Christian-Marriages-Priesthood-Children/dp/1425992609\" title=\"\">BIRTH CONTROL IS SINFUL IN THE CHRISTIAN MARRIAGES and also ROBBING GOD OF PRIESTHOOD CHILDREN!!</a> by Eliyzabeth Yanne Strong-Anderson. Aside from her fearlessness in using caps and double exclamation marks in the title, Strong-Anderson made the bold choice to write the book entirely in capital letters. This is either mad, or genius (reserve your judgment until you have read the book, I say).</p> <p>As someone who grew up on comics and graphic novels, I was always interested to note that the speech bubbles almost always featured all caps. Back then, there were no connotations of caps being shouty. The characters spoke only in urgent cap locks, from my favourite of all time (<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghost_Rider_%28comics%29\" title=\"\">Ghost Rider</a> \u2013 no judgment, please) to the camptastic POW! and BLAM! of the 1960s Batman series. When I saw Christopher Nolan's latest incarnation of the Dark Knight, I liked to think the growly, terse tone Christian Bale used while in costume was his way of capping it up for the screen. It was his way of saying \"BANG!\" and \"WHAMM!\" in these more straitlaced, serious times.</p> <p>Can a work of great literary value be written in all caps? Could you imagine Brideshead Revisited as BRIDESHEAD REVISITED? Could you see a quiet, contemplative book, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2004/jan/25/fiction.features2\" title=\"\">The Amateur Marriage by Anne Tyler</a>, say, written ENTIRELY IN ALL CAPS? The thought stirs up the beginnings of a migraine. It certainly works more often the other way around \u2013 from authors who stylise their names in diminutive lowercase (<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E._E._Cummings\" title=\"\">e e cummings</a>, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell_hooks\" title=\"\">bell hooks</a>, for example), to those who write entire passages in lowercase. Half of John Green and David Levithan's recent book, <a href=\"http://johngreenbooks.com/will-grayson/\" title=\"\">Will Grayson, Will Grayson</a>, is written in lowercase to delineate which of the two protagonists (both with the same name) is speaking. Humorist Don Marquis's collection of his <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archy_and_Mehitabel\" title=\"\">archy and mehitabel</a> columns were written entirely in lowercase \u2013 archy, a free verse poet, was also a cockroach, and lacked the strength to use the shift key on the typewriter.</p> <p>Caps locks are, for me, a nice, useful and occasional way of drawing attention to something. They make a noise and very quickly sit down again. They are a shorthand for drama and intense bursts of activity. International Caps Lock Day is a lovely thought, though. It's here for a short time, a good, noisy time. And then it goes away again. MARVELLOUS.</p>",
  "<p>Britain has ended a 10-year diplomatic boycott imposed on a controversial Indian politician accused of failing to stop anti-Muslim rioting that left at least a thousand people dead.</p> <p>Sir James Bevan, the British high commissioner, spent 50 minutes with Narendra Modi, the chief minister of Gujarat, in the western Indian state's capital of Gandhinagar on Monday morning. The conversation is understood to have been focused on business and investment.</p> <p>Bevan said the encounter had been \"open, positive and constructive\" and that under discussion were ways to \"develop co-operation between the UK and Gujarat across a very broad range of fields, including education, science and innovation, energy and climate change, and trade and investment.\"</p> <p>Modi, from the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata party, is a divisive figure in India. Some see him as an extremist who sided with mobs who attacked Muslims in towns and cities across Gujarat, following a lethal fire supposedly started by Muslims on a train full of Hindu pilgrims in 2002 \u2013 a charge he denies.</p> <p>Others, including some of the most powerful industrialists in India, say he is an effective, honest administrator who has introduced policies that have boosted development and reduced poverty during three successive terms as chief minister.</p> <p>The 2002 violence led to a de facto travel ban imposed on Modi by the UK, the US and some European nations, as well as the boycott by all but junior officials. In 2005, Modi was refused a US visa as someone held responsible for a serious violation of religious freedom. The British decision to break ranks was described by local journalists as \"<a href=\"http://af.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idAFBRE89A0UB20121011\" title=\"\">a major boost to the pro-business leader's quest for mainstream acceptance</a>\".</p> <p>When announcing the move earlier this month, Hugo Swire, the British foreign minister, said it was \"<a href=\"http://ukinindia.fco.gov.uk/en/news/?view=News&amp;id=821126582\" title=\"\">in line with the British government's stated objective of improving bilateral relations with India</a>\".</p> <p>Modi welcomed the announcement by posting a message on Twitter saying: \"God is great.\"</p> <p>Prof Shiv Visvanathan, a respected anthropologist involved with the legal campaign against Modi, said that the timing of the decision was surprising. \"If they had waited a bit longer, the UK's record on human rights would have been better preserved,\" he said.</p> <p>British officials in Delhi explained that a recent court decision that there was insufficient evidence to charge Modi for the violence of 2002, in which three British nationals died, had influenced the timing of the decision.</p> <p>However, Indian commentators were scathing, accusing Britain of moving in order to ingratiate themselves with a potential leader of India. Modi consistently tops polls of India's most popular politicians and is spoken of as a prime ministerial candidate for the BJP, the main opposition. National elections are not due until 2014, but could come much sooner if coalition partners of the ruling Congress party withdraw their support.</p> <p>\"Strictly speaking, the British Foreign ... Office can argue that direct complicity has yet to be established. [Modi's] lack of contrition is outweighed by his rising profile as a possible ministerial candidate. Discretion is, after all, the better part of valour,\" wrote KC Singh in Outlook magazine.</p> <p>Significant private sector investment in Gujarat from the UK and elsewhere also appears to have been a major factor. A British official in Delhi said: \"This is about Gujarat, not about who is chief minister. One reason is to broaden and advance commercial interests. There are opportunity costs to not engaging. But we are looking forward not back. There is a large Gujarati immigrant community in Britain.\"</p> <p>Bevan said he had reaffirmed \"the British government's wish to ensure justice for the families of the three British citizens who were killed in the 2002 riots\" and had raised broader questions of human rights in his discussion with Modi.</p> <p>\"This is about the power of the diaspora,\" said Visvanathan. \"However, I am confident Modi's era will close. The law of the land will prevail.\" A former member of Modi's cabinet was recently convicted of murder and jailed for 28 years for having a leading role in the 2002 violence, in which as many as 2,500 may have died.</p> <p>Witnesses described Maya Kodnani handing out swords to Hindus in the riots. She was later appointed as minister for women and child development. The Gujerati government has always maintained that the violence was spontaneous and did not involve local officials.</p>",

  "<p>Britain has now posted three consecutive quarters of declining gross domestic product \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/aug/24/uk-gdp-revised-economy-double-dip\" title=\"\">the most recent figures show the economy has shrunk by 0.5%</a>. With the latest set of GDP figures due to be released later this week, the nation remains sunk in the longest recession since the second world war.</p> <p>But GDP is also coming under a different sort of scrutiny in these days of economic woe. GDP measures all legal transactions in the financial economy \u2013 no more and no less. And yet, since its inception in the 1930s, it has become the single most important policy tool for governments, financial institutions and corporations. Governments and many people believe that only this one miraculous figure can really show whether things are getting better or getting worse.</p> <p>But GDP is a partial and misleading measure of national wealth and wellbeing. The problem is that it does not measure key goods in our economy, those unpriced but priceless services carried out by domestic workers and by nature \u2013 for example, the coastal defence of coral reefs, the pollution-filtering of wetlands, the nutrient recycling done by the soil and the unpaid work we do in our homes.</p> <p>And yet GDP does include bad elements such as pollution, crime, cigarettes and their related health costs and environmental disasters, which boost GDP and so generate economic growth.</p> <p>These omissions and inclusions generate alarming anomalies. Here are two: we are better economic agents if we eat out at expensive restaurants rather than cooking food we've grown at home; cleaning up the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/bp-oil-spill\" title=\"\">2010 BP oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico</a> was worth more economically \u2013 in GDP terms \u2013 than the carbon absorption provided by the Amazon rainforest.</p> <p>Under current GDP measures, countries that cut down forests for timber exports, dynamite their reefs for fish, pollute and degrade their soil for intensive agriculture and allow farms and factories to contaminate their waterways get rich.</p> <p>The services provided by nature and households are not included in GDP because we consider their work to be free. But these services are not free \u2013 and we are beginning to pay their hidden costs in environmental destruction and climate change.</p> <p>Conceived in Washington DC during the Depression, the GNP (as it was then) was flawed from the outset. Even its creator, <a href=\"http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/economics/laureates/1971/kuznets-autobio.html\" title=\"\">Simon Kuznets</a>, argued that it was a partial measure of national wealth, as did economist <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/john-maynard-keynes?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">John Maynard Keynes</a>, who oversaw the construction of the first British national accounts during the second world war.</p> <p>Both Keynes and Kuznets considered these figures to be temporary measures, for use only in emergencies such as wars and depressions. But they quickly became enshrined in public life, and after the second world war they were imposed on almost every nation on earth.</p> <p>The first politician to rail publicly against the GDP was Senator Robert Kennedy in March 1968: \"Too much and for too long, we seemed to have surrendered personal excellence and community values in the mere accumulation of material things. Our Gross National Product \u2026 counts air pollution and cigarette advertising, and ambulances to clear our highways of carnage.\" For Kennedy, GDP measured \"everything, in short, except that which makes life worthwhile\".</p> <p>It took 40 years for Kennedy's words to reach Washington DC: in March 2008 a US Senate committee discussed GDP's failure to measure environmental damage, poverty, income inequality, health and the quality of life. Two years later, Obama's healthcare bill allowed $70m over eight years to develop a new system of US national indicators. Economists from the group the <a href=\"http://www.stateoftheusa.org/\" title=\"\">State of the USA</a> are now working to generate 10 to 15 key measures from a set of some 300 indicators, including health, education, crime and justice, art and culture, the environment, and the economy. These new, more comprehensive measures are designed to guide US policy in an era of environmental destruction and economic downturn.</p> <p>GDP has been similarly challenged and deconstructed in Europe. In 2009, the then French president Nicolas Sarkozy recruited a team of economists \"to tear the GDP apart as they saw fit\". They too found that GDP should be replaced and that other indicators should be introduced to monitor social and environmental, as well as economic, change.</p> <p>The UN is working to value ecosystem services \u2013 or natural capital \u2013 and this year adopted a new international standard to give natural capital equal status to GDP. Speaking at the UN's conference <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/rio-20-earth-summit-diary-20-june\" title=\"\">Rio+20, Nick Clegg</a> said the UK was committed to including natural capital in its national accounts by 2020.</p> <p>One notable exception to the reign of GDP across the globe is Bhutan, which for the last four decades has used \"gross national happiness\" as the important measure, instead of GDP. With its long experience of alternative measures, Bhutan is now instrumental in current debates about national wealth and wellbeing.</p> <p>These initiatives to tear GDP apart are still in progress, but they make it clear that GDP's 80-year reign as the unchallenged measure of national wealth is at an end.</p>",
  "<p>There has been concern for a number of years about the fate of socially responsible businesses that get swallowed up by larger mainstream corporations. Do they lose their independence and radical edge, or do they help drive innovative thinking within the parent company?</p> <p>The answers are difficult to fully assess in the case of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2006/mar/18/highstreetretailers.retail?INTCMP=ILCNETTXT3487\" title=\"\">L'Oreal's takeover of the Body Shop</a> or the purchase of Green &amp; Blacks by Cadbury, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2010/jan/20/kraft-green-black-cadbury-ethical\" title=\"\">which in turn was bought by Kraft</a>.</p> <p>However, ice cream maker Ben &amp; Jerry's, owned by Unilever, says that it is now showing that a more transparent path is possible with the announcement that it has joined the rapidly expanding socially responsible <a href=\"http://www.bcorporation.net/\" title=\"\">B Corporation movement</a> in America.</p> <p>The company is the first wholly owned subsidiary to be certified by the non-profit B Lab to show that it meets rigorous standards of social and environmental performance, accountability, and transparency.</p> <p>Ben &amp; Jerry's hopes its leadership will encourage other major corporations to give some measure of independence to their more progressive subsidiaries.</p> <p>The company becomes the 635th business to join the movement, which is gaining critical mass in securing legislation to support its socially responsible business model. Eleven US states have already enacted laws supporting entrepreneurs and investors to build a more inclusive and sustainable economy, and a 12th is on the way.&#xa0;</p> <p>The legislation is needed because US corporate law effectively obliges directors to prioritise shareholder interests above all else.</p> <p>Chief executive Jostein Solheim tells the Guardian: \"As a wholly owned subsidiary of Unilever, the B Corp certification may even be a bit sweeter. When Ben &amp; Jerry's was acquired, many folks thought it would be a challenge for the company to keep its values.</p> <p>\"We're thrilled to join the movement. To undergo the process of certification, where every facet of our business is scrutinised to ensure that we're walking the talk, is rigorous but rewarding. It allows an experienced, holistic, values-led third party entity that B Lab is the chance to affirm that we remain true to our mission and look to accelerate our social impact.\"</p> <p>Solheim adds: \"We feel other businesses will learn and benefit from this.&#xa0;That position of being the first wholly owned subsidiary to become a certified B Corp is tremendous. The level of transparency and willingness to be open and honest is a testament to the relationship between Unilever and B&amp;J's, which we continually work for. It really helps put Ben &amp; Jerry's back into the pioneering realm, this time for other businesses who may find themselves in a similar setting.\"</p> <p>As part of its certification, Ben &amp; Jerry's has made its full B Impact Assessment and relevant excerpts from its governing<a href=\"http://www.bcorporation.net/benjerry\" title=\"\"> documents visible to the public</a>.</p> <p>Highlights show that 45% of the cost of goods sold go toward investing in and supporting small scale suppliers through the Caring Dairy program; its lowest paid hourly worker receives 46% above the living wage, and between half and three quarters of staff took part in an organised community programme in the last year.</p> <p>Between 65%-80% of its staff are \"satisfied\" or \"engaged\" at work, and the highest paid individual earns between 16 and 20 times more than the lowest paid full time worker.</p> <p>Only 4% of suppliers have third-party social or environmental company level certification, but this rises to 24% on the basis of materials or products purchased.</p> <p>Sensitive information that could advantage competitors or prejudice litigation, is blacked out, such as net income and the percentage of under-represented managers.</p> <p>In terms of overall performance, Ben &amp; Jerry's scored 93% of available points for its governance structure, 55% for environment and 45% for community.</p> <p>Does Solheim feel the knowledge the company gains will have an impact up the chain in Unilever?</p> <p>\"We operate in a manner of open communication and sharing,\" he says. \"As both organisations continue to pursue linked prosperity values be it in sourcing, social justice or sustainability we'll learn and succeed together.&#xa0;I've already spent considerable time with the Unilever CEO Paul Polman to discuss why we're proud of this announcement.\"</p> <p>Andrew Kassoy, who came up with the original B Corp idea five years ago with two course mates from Stanford University, said it was too early to predict what impact the certification may have on Unilever, but he is hopeful that \"the B impact assessment, as a tool to engage Unilever's supply chain on sustainability and to measure the increasingly positive impact Unilever has on the world by leveraging its enormous buying power, would be one compelling opportunity.\"</p> <p>With Ben &amp; Jerry's joining soon after outdoor clothing and equipment company Patagonia, Kassoy is hopeful that other large companies will join the fold. \"Anytime a company with a large following like Ben &amp; Jerry's joins the movement, it's a big deal,\" he says.&#xa0;\"We expect Ben &amp; Jerry's to embrace B Corp as they've embraced fair trade and that will help invite tens of millions of new consumers to be the change by supporting a better way to do business.\"</p> <p>Kassoy believes that soon others will follow. \"Larger and publicly-traded companies will begin to join the B Corp movement \u2013 some as certified B Corps, and many more will use the B impact assessment as a tool to engage their supply chains,\" he says.&#xa0;\"There are already more than 7,000 businesses using the assessment as a free and confidential management tool and we expect larger corporations to see this as a powerful way to leverage their purchasing power to engage their suppliers to measure what matters.\"</p> <p>While Ben &amp; Jerry's won the right to have an independent board of directors at the time of the Unilever acquisition more than a decade ago, the relationship has been through stormy times. In the past, the ice cream maker has accused its parent company of trampling on its values by trying to force it to follow Unilever's global policies at the expense of what it believes is right. Those tensions have dissipated since Polman took charge.</p> <p>Jerry Greenfield told the Guardian recently that there has always been \"a fascination with what the relationship is like between Unilever and Ben &amp; Jerry's. Do we have the freedom and how things have changed under their ownership? When we were over here the last time to announce our commitment to 100% fair trade, we thought we were doing this great thing, but the questions were about isn't Unilever trotting you out to make it look good and would you had done this a lot quicker if it was not for Unilever?\"</p> <p>Greenfield recalls company founder Ben Cohen admitting to the press they would have done it earlier and \"Unilever did not really like that. The difference now is that since Polman is so committed to this sustainability programme, he has managed to change the general feeling. Now there is not nearly the same level of distrust.\"</p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by </strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/guardian-professional\" title=\"\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

  "<p>When Barack Obama and Mitt Romney squared off in their second debate last week, the view from Beijing was not of a boxing match but \"a vanity fair for China-bashers competing to flex their muscles\", snapped a commentary for state news agency Xinhua.</p> <p>\"We hope the US Republican and Democratic candidates will get rid of the impact of election politics and do more things conducive to China-US mutual trust and cooperation,\" Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Hong Lei told reporters. </p> <p>But Monday's final debate is likely to see more panda-slugging; it includes a section on \"the rise of China and tomorrow's world\".</p> <p>On Tuesday Romney vowed to crack down on the world's second largest economy, complaining it had cheated and vowing to label it a currency manipulator on his first day as president.</p> <p>\"Governor, you're the last person who's going to get tough on China,\" retorted Obama, arguing Romney had backed companies that pioneered outsourcing and was currently investing in firms \"building surveillance equipment for China to spy on its own folks\".</p> <p>June Teufel Dreyer, an expert on Chinese politics at the University of Miami, said China had been salient in past races \u2013 Bill Clinton accused George H Bush of \"coddling dictators from Beijing to Bagdad\", for example \u2013 but seemed to be playing a larger role this year. She suggested that was a response to Chinese policy - including Beijing's confrontational behaviour in the South China and East China seas; continuing large trade surpluses and the skirting of WTO obligations; and attempts to stifle dissident voices.</p> <p>While Romney raised the issue first, the candidates \"seem to have been devoting approximately equal time\" to it, she added.</p> <p>Susan Shirk, deputy assistant secretary of state in the Clinton administration and now at the University of California-San Diego, thought China was perhaps less prominent this time, but the dynamic was familiar.</p> <p>\"Romney, like all challengers, tries to paint the current president as too soft on China. Because of the country's present economic pain, the focus is on China as an economic rather than security threat,\" she said.</p> <p>But Obama was somewhat protected because he has pursued trade complaints against China.</p> <p>\"And like all incumbents, President Obama is reluctant to trash relations with China to score campaign points,\" she added, saying he had attacked Bain's outsourcing rather than China itself.</p> <p>It's not only Chinese viewers who react uncomfortably to angry rhetoric.<br>\"Such talk does damage,\" <a href=\"http://www.dispatch.com/content/stories/editorials/2012/10/17/best-way-to-deal-with-china-is-to-heal-ourselves.html\">wrote John Frisbie</a>, president of the U.S.-China Business Council. </p> <p>\"It undermines support for a smarter approach to America's most important economic relationship.\"</p> <p>He noted China was a $250bn market for American companies and the third largest buyer of US exports after Canada and Mexico.</p> <p>And as Obama points out, the renminbi has risen, albeit not as far as the US would like \u2013 by 11% since 2008 and almost 30% since 2005.</p> <p>Few in China take campaign statements at face value. Even Romney supporters question whether he would actually label China a manipulator; others point out that applying the label requires no further concrete action.<br>\"Despite his aggressive rhetoric, a President Romney might actually be better for China,\" wrote Shen Dingli <a href=\"http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2012/10/17/why_china_wants_romney_to_win\">of the Centre for American Studies at Fudan University</a>. </p> <p>\"Traditionally, Republicans have favored free trade, free enterprise, and less regulation ...[and] shared concern over the economic risk of curbing climate change.\"</p> <p>Others say officials would rather deal with the president they know.</p> <p>\"I do not think that these attacks will result in any change in policy no matter who wins. US policy will respond to changes in China,\" argued Dreyer.</p> <p>The Xinhua commentary observed: \"It is an embarrassing truth that past US presidents have often toned down their tough talk on China after taking office, showing that they know the results of their tough talk going into effect would be disastrous.\"</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 25 October because it said June Teufel Dreyer was an expert on Chinese politics at Miami University.

  "<p><strong>I watched Ben Okri on TV during the Man Booker presentation and wondered if the beret was the trendy head covering for men this season? Or do you need to have won a Man Booker prize to get away with it?</strong></p> <p><em>Camilla, north London</em></p> <p>Ah oui, le beret \u2013 c'est si difficile, le beret, n'est-ce pas? Pour les femmes le beret marche mais pour les hommes? Ooh la la! (This part of today's column was brought to you by the French text book Tricolore, GCSE level.)</p> <p>At the risk of causing la grande displeasure to my various French relations, I have never been the greatest fan of the beret, either on a woman (a bit too jaunty, a bit too cutesy-wootsy) or on a man (\"Oui, je suis un extra dans 'Allo 'Allo. Pourquoi do you ask?\") Moreover, berets fail to fulfil the most basic hat function: namely, to keep one's head warm. I feel the same way about berets as I do about winter coats that do not cover one's backside: qu'est-ce que le point? A good hat should cover the whole of one's head and protect one's hair from the mizzly rain that blights this country in the winter months and plays havoc with one's Jewfro.</p> <p>But as one matures, like a fine wine or maybe just an old leather bag, one finds one's views being revised through the simple experience of that crazy ol' thing called life [last 10 words of that sentence should be read in a crinkly Texan accent]. For example, I no longer believe that one day I'll marry Andrew McCarthy. I also have come to the conclusion that a bowl of&#xa0;cereal is probably not an acceptable dinner. This is called Maturity. Similarly, I have also decided that maybe it is time to re-examine my prejudice against men who wear hats.</p> <p>I'm not talking about woolly winter hats \u2013 those are obviously fine. Heck, they're even applauded. A good thick woollen hat is invariably a fine addition indeed to a man's appearance and, with the exception of Colin Farrell's inexplicable fondness for wearing one on hot days, I cannot think of a single example of a man looking the worse for wearing one, and I have known A&#xa0;LOT&#xa0;of men [those last eight words should be read in a been-there-done-that Mae West voice, ideally while perched on a piano&#xa0;and shaking a cocktail glass filled&#xa0;with ice and mysterious liquors.]</p> <p>No, I'm talking about mannered hats, fussy hats, look-at-me hats. Things like boaters and fedoras and, yes, berets; hats that basically scream: \"Look at me! Look at me! I wish I lived in another centuryyyyyy! Wheeee!!\" Yeah, those hats! For special occasions, fine. But on a casual daily basis? No. Seriously, have you seen Johnny Depp recently? I&#xa0;repeat,&#xa0;no.</p> <p>Before anyone cries sexism, I&#xa0;used to feel a similar scepticism about women's hats before being&#xa0;won round by British milliner Stephen Jones, who showed me that hats needn't be fussy pleas for attention but can be (if they are made by Jones) amazing outfits in themselves, ones that can turn even the most tuneless among us into, for&#xa0;a&#xa0;brief&#xa0;moment, Grace Jones.&#xa0;Not&#xa0;even Harry Potter's sorting&#xa0;hat could achieve that trick.</p> <p>But what works on a woman does not always work on a man and, fine, you can now cry sexism all you want, dudes. But look at it this way: on the one hand, I don't think you should wear hats. On the other, you don't have&#xa0;to give birth. Swings and&#xa0;roundabouts.</p> <p>Yet, as I said, in my aged and hard-won wisdom, I have come to learn that life is more complicated than one thinks in one's youth and that a prejudice that is unexamined is a&#xa0;prejudice based on ignorance and fear. So I have been re-examining my hats-on-men prejudice of late and these are the conclusions I have drawn:</p> <p>1. Fedoras, panamas and top hats&#xa0;are, in certain circumstances, acceptable. But Depp needs to cool it as&#xa0;he is entering the Land of Self-Parody from which there is no return.</p> <p>2. Gentlemen should be given more leeway than I have heretofore granted them when it comes to hats because a&#xa0;balding pate needs extra coverage in&#xa0;the chilly winter.</p> <p>3. A beret on a man is ridiculous.</p> <p>Look, I'm not criticising Ben Okri personally. The man won a Booker; I&#xa0;write a fashion column. I&#xa0;think that's all that needs to be said. All I will add is that, as a general rule, I cannot approve of such headwear. I shall leave you with the words of that noble sage Bobby Ewing that the one thing a man should never be is \"all hat&#xa0;and no cattle\".

  "<p>At the eastern tip of the Israeli settlement of Ariel, cranes and earth-movers are at work on the college campus, which stretches across a hill overlooking the villages and valleys of the West Bank. Eleven miles from the internationally recognised Green Line separating Israel from the Palestinian Territories, construction is under way of buildings to accommodate a projected growth from 13,000 to 20,000 students over the next 10 years.</p> <p>In September, the college passed a significant milestone when the Israeli cabinet voted to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/09/israel-west-bank-ariel-university-upgrade-row\" title=\"\">upgrade the college to a university</a> as a matter of \"national importance\". Backing the move, prime minister Binyamin Netanyahu told the cabinet that Ariel was \"an inseparable part of Israel\" and would remain so in the future.</p> <p>The decision, concerning a settlement which is illegal under international law and whose future is a key determinant of a viable Palestinian state and the peaceful resolution of a decades-old conflict, was not universally acclaimed. Urging Israel to reconsider, British foreign secretary William Hague said it would \"deepen the presence of the settlements in the Palestinian territories and will create another obstacle to peace\".</p> <p>Deeper inside the West Bank, a few miles east of Ariel, construction workers are also busy. Earlier this year, Israel approved <a href=\"http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/news/west-bank-settlement-of-shiloh-gets-initial-approval-for-600-new-homes-1.414215\" title=\"\">plans for 600 homes</a> in the settlement of Shiloh and its outpost, Shvut Rachel. \"This community has doubled in size in 20 years, and there is no question that there will be further growth. The demand for homes is much greater than supply,\" said Shiloh's former mayor, David Rubin.</p> <p>Further south, Israel a year ago announced plans for a settlement across the Green Line close to Jerusalem. The 2,600 homes of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/oct/16/israel-settlement-isolate-arab-jerusalem\" title=\"\">Givat Hamatos</a>, plus expansion of neighbouring Gilo and Har Homa, will increase the separation of Palestinian areas of the city from the West Bank, reducing the likelihood of East Jerusalem becoming the capital of a future Palestinian state.</p> <p>These three places illustrate a pattern of settlement growth that mocks Barack Obama's demand, issued early in his presidency, that Israel should halt expansion as an impediment to peace.</p> <p>Entrenchment of \"facts on the ground\" has led a growing number of people, on both sides of the conflict, to declare that creating a Palestinian state alongside an Israeli state to resolve the conflict is now impossible. The \"two-state solution\", they say, is dead.</p> <p>In June 2009, less than six months into his presidency, <a href=\"http://www.time.com/time/politics/article/0,8599,1902738,00.html\" title=\"\">Obama addressed the Israeli-Palestinian conflict</a> in his keynote speech on the Middle East in Cairo. Restating US commitment to a two-state model, he said the Palestinians must abandon violence, and develop their capacity to govern. By most reckoning, the Ramallah leadership has ticked both boxes.</p> <p>On the Israeli side, Obama said the US did not accept the legitimacy of Jewish settlements. \"It is time for these settlements to stop,\" he said bluntly.</p> <p>There followed protracted negotiations between the US and Israeli governments which resulted, in November 2009, in Netanyahu reluctantly acceding to a temporary construction freeze in West Bank settlements. East Jerusalem was exempt, with the completion of any buildings whose foundations were already laid. In anticipation of the moratorium, the number of construction starts rose significantly in the run-up to November.</p> <p>Critics denounced the freeze as a farce, but the settlers were incensed and relations between Netanyahu and Obama nosedived. Relations between the two allies were \"in the state of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/jun/27/israel-us-relations-tectonic-rift\" title=\"\">a tectonic rift </a>in which continents are drifting apart,\" Michael Oren, Israel's ambassador to the US, memorably said in mid-2010. The freeze ended in September 2010, despite US efforts to secure an extension. Direct talks between Israel and the Palestinians swiftly broke down as settlement construction resumed, since when the \"peace process\" has been in a catatonic state.</p> <p>Obama was heavily criticised for his early focus on settlements. But, according to one observer, \"the problem was not Obama's identification of the settlement issue as a critical obstacle to the resumption of talks and, beyond that, to the two-state model itself \u2013 it was his failure to stick with it in the face of Netanyahu's intransigence\".</p> <p>In the past two years, US officials have issued routine condemnation of settlement expansion plans but real pressure from Washington has eased. In June, Israel's Central Bureau of Statistics reported that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jul/26/jewish-population-west-bank-up\" title=\"\">the number of Jewish settlers in the West Bank</a> had risen by 15,000 over the previous 12 months, to a record 350,000. Most of the growth was in small hardline settlements deep inside the West Bank. An additional 200,000 Jews live in settlements in East Jerusalem. In the New York Times, s ettlers' leader Dani Dayon <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/26/opinion/israels-settlers-are-here-to-stay.html\" title=\"\"> pronounced the Jewish presence across the Green Line \"an irreversible fact\"</a>. Predicting the numbers in Jewish colonies in the West Bank would top 400,000 by 2014, he wrote: \"Trying to stop settlement expansion is futile.\" The international community should relinquish its \"vain attempts to attain the unattainable two-state solution\".</p> <p>He said: \"Our presence here has now passed a point of non-return. It's irrevocable, a fait accompli.\" The status quo, while not ideal, was \"immeasurably better than any feasible alternative\".</p> <p>In the face of the \"facts on the ground\", others are proposing alternative courses of action. Some on the Israeli right have called for annexation of the West Bank. The Palestinian population can either accept living under Israeli rule with limited rights or leave, they say. Critics say this would be akin to apartheid and make Israel a pariah state.</p> <p>Others have called for a more modest, but unilateral, annexation of the 9.4% of the West Bank which will lie between the Green Line and Israel's separation barrier when it is complete. Defence minister Ehud Barak recently proposed that settlers outside the three main blocs \u2013 Ma'ale Adumim, Gush Etzion and Ariel \u2013 should be evacuated or choose to live under Palestinian rule. The barrier would become what its critics have always charged \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.israelhayom.com/site/newsletter_article.php?id=5880\" title=\"\">Israel's new border</a>. \"It would be best to reach agreement with the Palestinians but, barring that, practical steps must be taken to begin the separation,\" he said in a newspaper interview.</p> <p><a href=\"http://bluewhitefuture.org/\" title=\"\">Blue White Future</a>, a relatively new organisation, also argues for \"constructive unilateralism\", by which it means Israel withdrawing to the security barrier, with voluntary evacuation and compensation for those in settlements beyond. \"Once Israel announces it has no sovereignty claims east of the fence, most [settlers] will move westwards,\" said Orni Petruschka, co-chairman.</p> <p>Some have even suggested the \"cantonisation\" of the West Bank. The Palestinian Authority would be given autonomy in five cantons around the main West Bank cities of Ramallah, Jenin, Nablus, Bethlehem and Hebron, with Israeli sovereignty over the rest of the territory.</p> <p>There are also growing Palestinian voices declaring the end of the two-state model. \"The two-state solution died long ago, with Israel's refusal to confront the settlement movement,\" said Palestinian analyst Diana Butto. \"Unless this colonial project is addressed completely, there cannot be two states, only apartheid.\" The battle now, she said, was for universal rights within the one state that is in de facto existence.</p> <p>Among those still fighting for a two-state model are European diplomats in Jerusalem who have identified a handful of West Bank and East Jerusalem settlements as \"game changers\". Significant growth in these places would signal crossing a red line, they say. \"There's a year, or 18 months maximum, before it's over,\" said one.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.molad.org/\" title=\"\">Molad</a>, a young leftist Israeli thinktank, says it is fighting an \"irreversibility thesis\". According to director Avner Inbar, \"talk of the end of the two-state solution is irresponsible. The two-state solution is not only the best framework, it's the only one that will work. None of the advocates of one state talk of the likely consequences. It would result in dramatic and possibly catastrophic violence.\"</p> <p>Barring the unexpected, the most likely course is continuation of the status quo \u2013 Netanyahu's preferred option and so, it seems, Republican candidate Mitt Romney's, judging by a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/18/mitt-romney-israel-palestinian-solution\" title=\"\">recently leaked video</a>. But as many analysts and diplomats point out, the \"status quo\" in practice means the entrenchment and growth of settlements.</p> <p>A reinvigorated second-term Obama presidency could change that. In an interview with ABC in July, the president was asked if there was anything he believed he had failed at, that \"has you desperate to get that second term to atone for?\" There were \"a bunch of things that we didn't get done that I think were important,\" replied Obama. On foreign policy, he said, \"I have not been able to move the peace process forwards in the Middle East in the way I wanted\".</p> <p>Faith, as well as time, has been lost. \"Obama has learned this is not an issue that will win him any votes. I am not someone who believes a second-term president will act any differently that he did in his first term,\" said Butto.</p> <p>According to Dayon, \"Obama has learned the limitation of his powers to make change here. President Obama of 2012 will not be the same as President Obama of 2008 because he now realises he cannot deliver.\"</p> <p>Back in Ariel, students are hurrying between classes at the start of term. At the Moskowitz School of Communications, named after the US bingo magnate Irving Moskowitz, who has spent millions of dollars funding the settlement enterprise in the West Bank, 24-year-old Adi said she was thrilled at the institution's new university classification. \"It will give graduates better status and better job prospects. Yes, of course, we are situated in the middle of a conflict, but a city like Ariel is very valuable to Israel. We cannot give it up.\"</p> <p>Down the road in Shiloh, David Rubin dismissed the idea of evacuating any settlements. \"We're supposed to hand over our heartland? This is my country, where my roots are, where my history is, where my destiny is, where the Jewish people were born, exiled from and returned to. This community will never be destroyed. There will never be a deal with the Palestinians.\"</p>"
