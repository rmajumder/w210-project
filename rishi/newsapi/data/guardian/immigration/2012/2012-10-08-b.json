  "<p>Roy Hodgson alone will determine whether Ashley Cole plays for England in Friday's World Cup qualifier against San Marino after the Football Association ruled out the possibility of banning the full-back for describing the governing body as a \"bunch of twats\" on Twitter.</p> <p>Cole, who has linked up with the national squad ahead of Tuesday's official opening of St George's Park, was charged with misconduct by the FA's governance department on Monday and is likely to be fined for bringing the game into disrepute. That sanction, together with an anticipated fine of two weeks wages \u2013 around \u00a3240,000 \u2013 to be imposed by Chelsea for breaching the club's own code of conduct on social media, could see the England defender forking out as much as \u00a3300,000 for the message tweeted on Friday afternoon.</p> <p>The player is consulting with his representative and his lawyer before deciding whether or not to request a personal hearing \u2013 he has until 4pm on Thursday to respond \u2013 but is expected to accept the FA charge having already issued a public apology for the outburst through his solicitors. The FA will take that into account, together with the fact he deleted the offensive message, albeit after it had been re-tweeted over 19,000 times, when determining the size of the fine to be imposed.</p> <p>Yet, when combined with the money to be docked from his wages by his club, the misdemeanour appears destined to cost Cole far more than the \u00a3220,000 John Terry must pay, pending a potential appeal, after the independent regulatory commission found him guilty of racially abusing Anton Ferdinand.</p> <p>It was the publication of their reasoning for that decision that had prompted Cole's furious reaction and suggestions the FA might seek effectively to suspend him from Friday's game against San Marino when he might otherwise have earned a 99th cap.</p> <p>However, the governing body is anxious to retain a distinction between disciplinary matters and the England national team, with the precedent on off-field cases such as this \u2013 Rio Ferdinand was fined \u00a345,000 for re-tweeting a message that described Cole as a \"choc ice\" after Terry's trial in July \u2013 a monetary sanction. That policy is set to be maintained.</p> <p>That will leave Hodgson to decide whether or not to pick England's most-capped left-back against the team ranked joint 207th in the world, an event that would see Cole shaking hands with the FA chairman, David Bernstein, and other dignitaries in the pre-match pleasantries.</p> <p>The national manager had already given thought to resting the player for the fixture, conscious as he is that the 31-year-old can struggle with ankle complaints immediately after games and with England due to play Poland in a far more daunting fixture on Tuesday in Warsaw.</p> <p>Leighton Baines, who has started against Italy, Moldova and Ukraine in England's fixtures this season, could therefore play against San Marino with Cole in contention instead for the game against the Poles, who will be without their captain, Jakub Blaszczykowski, after he sustained his own ankle injury.</p> <p>Hodgson, as expected, has called up Cole's club-mate Ryan Bertrand to replace the injured Kieran Gibbs with Jonjo Shelvey, the uncapped Liverpool midfielder, also linking up with squad that convened at St George's Park on Monday evening as cover for Frank Lampard. The 20-year-old is suspended for the first leg of the under-21s' European Championship play-off against Serbia at Norwich and will train instead with the seniors. A decision will be taken at the weekend as to whether he drops back down to Stuart Pearce's junior side for next week's second leg in Krusevac.</p> <p>Cole arrived at the new national football complex outside Burton-on-Trent still digesting the charge laid upon him by the FA \u2013 the governing body having visited the vast majority of league clubs this year to discuss the potential pitfalls of Twitter with players \u2013 and will be part of the squad who meet the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge at the site's official opening on Tuesday. Chelsea have confirmed they will pursue their own disciplinary procedure against the player, but will not be reviewing their overall policy on social media in the wake of the outburst.</p> <p>They are in regular dialogue with their staff about the use of Twitter, encouraging players to interact with the club's support, and recognise Cole's error of judgment as a relatively isolated incident where their own code of conduct on social media has been breached. It remains to be seen how the furore affects negotiations over a new contract. The left-back's current deal expires next summer and, while a one-year extension has been mooted, talks remain at an impasse with Cole seeking to secure a longer-term agreement and Paris St-Germain, managed by the former Chelsea coach Carlo Ancelotti, monitoring his potential availability.</p>",

Over the gates of the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solovki_prison_camp\" title=\"\">Solovetsky camp</a> in Lenin's gulag: \"Through Labour \u2013 Freedom!\". Over the gates of the Ngenya detention camp, run by the British in Kenya: \"Labour and Freedom\". Dehumanisation appears to follow an almost inexorable course.</p> <p>Last week three elderly Kenyans established the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/05/kenyan-mau-mau-veterans\" title=\"\">right to sue the British government for the torture</a> that they suffered \u2013 castration, beating and rape \u2013 in the Kikuyu detention camps it ran in the 1950s.</p> <p>Many tens of thousands were detained and tortured in the camps. I won't spare you the details: we have been sparing ourselves the details for far too long. Large numbers of men were castrated with pliers. Others were raped, sometimes with the use of knives, broken bottles, rifle barrels and scorpions. Women had similar instruments forced into their vaginas. The guards and officials sliced off ears and fingers, gouged out eyes, mutilated women's breasts with pliers, poured paraffin over people and set them alight. Untold thousands died.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/apr/18/britain-destroyed-records-colonial-crimes?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">government's secret archive, revealed this April</a>, shows that the attorney general, the colonial governor and the colonial secretary knew what was happening. The governor ensured that the perpetrators had legal immunity: including the British officers reported to him for roasting prisoners to death. In public the colonial secretary lied and kept lying.</p> <p>Little distinguishes the British imperial project from any other. In all cases the purpose of empire was loot, land and labour. When people resisted (as some of the Kikuyu did during the Mau Mau rebellion), the response everywhere was the same: extreme and indiscriminate brutality, hidden from public view by distance and official lies.</p> <p>Successive governments have sought to deny the Kikuyu justice: destroying most of the paperwork, lying about the existence of the rest, seeking to have the case dismissed on technicalities. Their handling of this issue, and the widespread British disavowal of what happened in Kenya, reflects the way this country has been brutalised by its colonial history. Empire did almost as much harm to the imperial nations as it did to their subject peoples.</p> <p>In his book Exterminate All the Brutes, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/jun/22/sven-lindqvist-life-in-writing\" title=\"\">Sven Lindqvist</a> shows how the ideology that led to Hitler's war and the Holocaust was developed by the colonial powers. Imperialism required an exculpatory myth. It was supplied, primarily, by British theorists.</p> <p>In 1799 <a href=\"http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/1006895/Charles-White\" title=\"\">Charles White</a> began the process of identifying Europeans as inherently superior to other peoples. By 1850 the disgraced anatomist Robert Knox had developed the theme into fully fledged racism. His book The Races of Man asserted that dark-skinned people were destined to be enslaved and then annihilated by the \"lighter races\". Dark meant almost everyone: \"What a field of extermination lies before the Saxon, Celtic and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarmatians\" title=\"\">Sarmatian</a> races!\"</p> <p>Remarkable as it may sound, this view soon came to dominate British thought. In common with most of the political class, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Winwood_Reade\" title=\"\">W Winwood Reade,</a> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/science/2012/sep/27/recognition-alfred-russel-wallace-darwin\" title=\"\">Alfred Russell Wallace</a>, <a href=\"http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/spencer/\" title=\"\">Herbert Spencer</a>, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederic_Farrar\" title=\"\">Frederick Farrar,</a> <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Galton\" title=\"\">Francis Galton,</a> <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Kidd\" title=\"\">Benjamin Kidd</a> and even Charles Darwin saw the extermination of dark-skinned people as an inevitable law of nature. Some of them argued that Europeans had a duty to speed it up: both to save the integrity of the species and to put the inferior \"races\" out of their misery.</p> <p>These themes were picked up by German theorists. In 1893 Alexander Tille, drawing on British writers, claimed that \"it is the right of the stronger race to annihilate the lower\". In 1901 Friedrich Ratzel argued in Der Lebensraum that Germany had a right and duty, like Europeans in the Americas, to displace \"primitive peoples\". In Mein Kampf, Hitler explained that the German empire's eastward expansion would mirror the western and southern extension of British interests. He systematised and industrialised what imperial nations had been doing for five centuries. The scale was greater, the location different, the ideology broadly the same.</p> <p>I believe that the brutalisation of empire also made the pointless slaughter of the first world war possible. A ruling class that had shut down its feelings to the extent that it could engineer a famine in India in the 1870s in which between 12 million and 29 million people died was capable of almost anything. Empire had tested not only the long-range weaponry that would be deployed in northern France, but also the ideas.</p> <p>Nor have we wholly abandoned them. Commenting on the Kikuyu case in the Daily Mail, Max Hastings charged that the plaintiffs had come to London <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-2174549/The-folly-judges-vulture-lawyers-nation-addicted-masochism.html\" title=\"\">\"to exploit our feeble-minded justice system\"</a>. Hearing them \"represents an exercise in state masochism\". I suspect that if members of Hastings' club had been treated like the Kikuyu, he would be shouting from the rooftops for redress. But Kenyans remain, as colonial logic demanded, the other, bereft of the features and feelings that establish our common humanity.</p> <p>So, in the eyes of much of the elite, do welfare recipients, \"problem families\", Muslims and asylum seekers. The process of dehumanisation, so necessary to the colonial project, turns inwards. Until this nation is prepared to recognise what happened and how it was justified, Britain, like the countries it occupied, will remain blighted by imperialism.</p> <p>\u2022 Twitter: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GeorgeMonbiot\" title=\"\">@GeorgeMonbiot</a></p> <p>\u2022 A fully referenced version of this article can be found at <a href=\"http://www.monbiot.com/\" title=\"\">www.monbiot.com</a></p>",
  "<p>An MP has led calls for a ban on drinks made with liquid nitrogen after surgeons removed the stomach of one of his teenage constituents who drank a cocktail made with the ingredient.</p> <p>Gaby Scanlon, 18, complained of breathlessness and gastric pain after having the drink in Oscar's wine bar during a night out with friends in Lancaster city centre on Thursday and was taken to hospital, where she was diagnosed with a perforated stomach.</p> <p>\"I would like to see these drinks banned from sale so we do not see anyone else's son or daughter injured or even killed,\" said David Morris, the Tory MP for Morecambe and Lunesdale.</p> <p>When exposed to air, liquid nitrogen creates a dense fog and is used by bartenders and chefs to add an element of visual drama to dishes or to freeze things quickly, such as ice cream.</p> <p>It is also used for removing warts and has industrial uses. Contact with flesh can cause cryogenic burn or \"frostbite\". A number of witnesses at the wine bar are being interviewed by police and the premises has stopped selling drinks containing the chemical. A Lancashire police spokeswoman said: \"Medical opinion is that this would have proved fatal had the operation not been carried out urgently.</p> <p>\"The investigation is still in its early stages and we are still interviewing witnesses to establish the full facts.</p> <p>\"The premises involved have fully co-operated with all agencies and have suspended drinks involving liquid nitrogen.\"</p>",
  "<p>At ease in a party gripped by conviction, the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2012/oct/08/george-osborne-tory-conference-video\" title=\"\">chancellor spoke with candour</a>: \"Beneath the sound and fury of daily debate a quiet revolution is taking place.\" In the throes of economic turmoil, here is \"the most radical and reforming period of government this country has seen for a generation \u2026 I am the chancellor who is cutting the size of government faster than anyone in modern times.\" And so he is.</p> <p>There is a nonchalance about George Osborne, that grim smirk suggesting he doesn't much care about present calamities so long as he drives on with that great state-cutting purpose. At the conference his party's thinktanks, cabals and caucuses agonise in one fringe after another over \"How to Win\": no government has increased its <a href=\"http://www.politicsresources.net/area/uk/percentvote.htm\" title=\"\">share of the vote</a> in modern times, let alone by an impossible 6% \u2013 and David Cameron doesn't look to them like the man to do it. They may be wrong: Labour certainly isn't counting any chickens.</p> <p>For Osborne, legacy is what matters now. He would not \"wake up like Tony Blair did, after a decade in power and discover he didn't achieve anything\", he said. Finding it easy to uproot much that Labour did, their focus now is on what they leave behind after just one term. That means permanent change to the state, not just taking a wrecking ball to its fabric, but planting anti-state knotweed in the national mind. \"We're Conservatives, not anarchists\" he felt the need to say \u2013 but these demolitionists are conserving as little as they can. In the NHS, schools admissions, Whitehall, council services or social security, all of it is, he said, \"a state that had become too expensive to pay for\".</p> <p>What does the public make of a chancellor in deep crisis proclaiming \"the economy is healing\"? His economic policy has collapsed, debt is rising and he has missed his deficit targets by miles. Yet with devil-may-care breeziness he announced more of the same: tighten the screw, cut deeper. He was blush-free about his budget's avoidable absurdities and accidents. The Whitehall axe has left the Treasury greatly depleted in numbers and skills and state finances in the perilous hands of inexperienced officials. Expect the great train bid disaster to be replicated often, with too many people lacking the expertise to write complex contracts as slabs of the state are outsourced. Wait for over 200 clinical commissioning groups in the NHS to go live: most have weak capacity to sign good contracts to cover their entire population. But this chancellor and cabinet seem alarmingly unconcerned, so long as the ideology is right.</p> <p>Not a voice is raised here against a <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-19865692\" title=\"\">further \u00a310bn</a> of benefit cuts. Morally and ideologically right, this is seen as the undisputed winning ticket. Pollsters say people want more of it and opposition from Nick Clegg and Iain Duncan Smith has evaporated. Though hitting the poorest hardest, Osborne calls it fair. \"Where is the fairness for the shift-worker leaving home in the dark hours of the early morning who looks up at the closed blinds of their next door neighbour sleeping off a life on benefits?\" Yet again, he asserted that those in work get less than the idlers: not true, as sleight of hand with his benefit cap compares an out-of-work family's benefits with a working household's pay, conveniently leaving out all the credits and benefits the working family gets. But few will ever know.</p> <p>This despicable and mendacious bullying may not work indefinitely. Osborne never mentioned the unemployed, not once; no word about six million people desperately looking for full-time jobs, with more long-term workless than since Thatcher's day. In Birmingham this week when <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-18973393\" title=\"\">Jaguar Land Rover advertised 1,100 jobs</a>, over 20,000 applied. Are all the 19,000 who were turned away slackers \u2013 or does the tide of opinion start to turn? Trying to reclaim \"one nation\" from Ed Miliband, it takes some nerve to say, \"We're not going to get through this as a country if we set one group against another, if we divide, denounce and demonise.\"</p> <p>Next April, Disability Living Allowance cuts will provide a shock when <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/sep/03/paralympians-fears-disability-living-allowance\" title=\"\">Paralympians campaign</a> against people losing essential support. That month council tax benefit cuts also come in: soon poll tax bailiffs will try to collect from the poorest. Half the population will <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/sep/22/living-standards-report-divided-britain\" title=\"\">still be worse off in 2020</a> than they were pre-recession. Pitting the hard-up against the unemployed and the sick may not work for long.</p> <p>This feels like a party lost to common sense. Unlike the old days, Labour people were exceedingly sensible, no one said anything mad, but here psalms to free-market extremism and chants about grinding down the feckless idle ring out at most fringes. They bark for a referendum on Europe, against gay marriage, against public workers, for tax cuts and for less state. At a serious event about infrastructure, a speaker from the Institute for Economic Affairs astonished the construction industry with his remedies: to avoid public spending on road building, rip out cycle and bus lanes. To solve train capacity, use standing-room only carriages.</p> <p>Fondness for American Tea Party politics has led them to dip a toe into US culture war politics by stirring up the abortion issue. Some even echo Romney's notorious 47% gaffe by claiming half of the British population makes no net contribution to the state, once you take into account their benefits and use of education and health services. Calls for bonfires of everything from maternity leave to redundancy pay were echoed by Osborne with his plan to let employers offer <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/oct/08/george-osborne-shares-rights-scheme\" title=\"\">up to \u00a350,000 worth of shares</a> to buy out workers' rights. They used to boast they were the party of hard-headed realism \u2013 but now they are lost in clouds of ideology. Ideas matter more than facts, so when Tories claim they will \"get Britain building\" by deregulating planning, Birmingham council replies it has 2,200 large projects with planning permission, but the construction firms lack investment funds. But Osborne never used the word growth.</p> <p>A few voices urge David Cameron back towards the \"compassion\" he promised seven years ago: he may try, but it's far too late now. As every cabinet minister vies with one another for the nastiness crown \u2013 on Europe, immigration, Travellers' sites, crime, shoot-to-kill burglars and another \u00a310bn in benefit cuts, compassion is nowhere to be found. Nastiness alone is never a winner \u2013 and Osborne offered no better future. The only gleam in his eye is to leave behind a state shrunk beyond recognition.</p>",
  "<p>Dr Charlotte Cowie is welcoming a group of journalists eager to test the elite medical facilities at St George's Park, the National Football Centre. \"It is the first time we've had a group of non-sports teams doing some of the routines so you're unique,\" says Cowie, the clinical director of a joint venture between the Football Association and Perform.</p> <p>St George's Park opens officially on Tuesday but we are here for a preview and about to hit the anti-gravity treadmill, Wattbike, Technogym and Batak board, have a turn on the body composition analyser, take biomechanical assessments and then recover in the hydrotherapy suite, which houses an ice bath.</p> <p>Cowie, a former head of medicine at Fulham and Tottenham, as well as working with the GB taekwondo team, says: \"This morning will be very much around performance, earning your lunch, working quite hard.\"</p> <p>With lunch already sounding enticing we head to the Wattbike. Five of us line up on the machines for a 1,000m race that is displayed on computer screens with our names in the lanes. As a runner of 9km each morning to warm up before uncovering the earthy truths of the Manchester football beat, I admit I am confident. The stamina I have built up plus the sprint finish means I am a cert to be among the contenders.</p> <p>The bike can measure 39 parameters including power, speed and pace. And it also shows who trails in last and that is me, long seconds after the rest of the field. I laugh it off but I am not happy.</p> <p>Roy Hodgson's England squad arrived at the 330-acre site on Monday to use it for the first time before the World Cup qualifiers with San Marino and Poland. Steve Kemp, the elite physiotherapist who helps advise Hodgson's players, says: \"My role is strategic as well as being on the ground. I assist Gary Lewin with the senior team and act as a coordinator for the other [23] England football teams that come through SGP.</p> <p>\"The other role is for Perform. [Regarding] elite athletes from other sports, or professional footballers from Championship clubs or League One, we build a programme and hopefully rehabilitate them and send them back with information and assessment details of where we think they can improve and reach full fitness.\"</p> <p>After the bike I am happy to take part non-competitively, in the anti-gravity treadmill. This involves wearing special shorts hooked into the waist-deep chamber that gradually inflates as your bodyweight is altered. Developed by Nasa, it allows quicker and safer rehab due to pressure being relieved from joints. The sensation as you run is like bouncing on marshmallows.</p> <p>For Lewin, the England physio who was at Arsenal for 28 years, state-of-the-art medical care can have a direct impact on individual performance and team results. \"Medical education is as important as coach education and this place will be the centre of excellence for medical education in all aspects: physiotherapy, doctors, sports science, physiology,\" he says.</p> <p>\"Not only is it important that the standard of coaching improves. What's more important to me is that we improve the coach knowledge of medicine.\"</p> <p>Next I try the body composition analyser, where Cowie assesses my weight (77.9kg), body fat (21.2%), fat mass (16.5%), muscle mass (58.3kg) and body mass index (24). All are within the ideal parameters and, as my metabolic age also reads as the 40-year-old I am, Cowie is content, though she warns that for a full medical I need blood tests to determine my cholesterol levels.</p> <p>While this probably means all the late-night kebabs will point to a heart attack in a few weeks, the Technogym is cruel. There are the conventional weight machines and a range of other killer activities, one of which involves holding a container filled with water while star-jumping.</p> <p>Hot and sweaty we adjourn for a balanced lunch complete with isotonic drinks before the Batak is taken on. This is a rectangular metal frame with flashing lights and numbers that tests hand-eye coordination. Guess who finishes bottom of the pile again?</p> <p>After a test of balance it seems I have the equilibrium of a man after eight pints \u2013 and we move to the hydrotherapy suite. Here pool depth can be altered, the HydroWorx treadmill has cameras that film underwater to monitor recovery and the ice bath's temperature can also be changed. My casual stroll through this soon speeds up as it feels freezing despite the water being 11C.</p> <p>So ends the day at a medical complex that is not only impressive but is also being billed as accessible for all. As Julie Harrington, the managing director, says. \"One of the things we want to achieve as an organisation is to be more open. We took a strategic decision that there isn't a big gatehouse that says 'You can't come in, it's England's training camp.' It's really important this is considered an open site and people are welcomed in, so other sports people and the general public can use the facilities.\"</p>",

Here are a few thoughts:</p> <p>\u2022 More people will turn up to David Cameron's speech on Wednesday - partly because it will be held in a much bigger hall. But the reception and atmosphere tonight was less like a political speech and more like some form of live entertainment: Boris was cheered and applauded to the rafters, and the scenes when he arrived in the middle of the crowd and made his way to the stage, with heads turning and people leaping up from their seats, bordered on megalomania. All this for a politician. Cameron's reception will be nothing like that. I think Boris showed tonight beyond doubt that in terms of his public image he is one of a kind, and is gathering strength. His conference speech last year was well-attended and well-received, but the fuss and buzz was nothing like this. Unbelievably, he is scheduled to speak again in the main hall tomorrow morning. The conference organisers could not have planned this better to build momentum for the mayor at the expense of Cameron.</p> <p>\u2022&#xa0;Boris was conspicuously loyal, praising Cameron and the coalition and attacking Labour and Eds Miliband and Balls. But wasn't it strange to say that \"while I am mayor\" Labour could get back into power - something surely designed to conjure up the image of himself as the leading anti-Labour force? And his firm opposition to a third runway at Heathrow seemed to be aimed squarely at the coalition: \"Move off that idea. It's not going to happen. We need a better solution.\" The supposed point of this rally, his passing on of advice on how to beat Labour, was skipped over speedily - perhaps because his own experience in London is almost completely irrelevant to the national Tory party's attempt to win in 2015.</p> <p>\u2022 He used all his usual rhetorical tricks: he was funny, irreverent, self-deprecating, multilingual, anti-French, policy-light, and a political clothes-stealer, even at one point making a slight dig at Margaret Thatcher, when he said: \"The 103 bodies that can dig up the roads - basically under Thatcherite legislation put down when very few private utilities existed \u2026 We have finally got to grips with the consequences of that legislation.\" To put it mildly, even this kind of timid criticism of Thatcher is unheard of here. But the crowd showed no objection, something as impressive and unexpected in its way as Boris's achievement in getting the London Olympic parade to cheer the name G4S.</p> <p>\u2022 I've learned one other thing too.

Before previous elections, \"that kind of talk, meetings like this, seemed awfully interesting \u2026 but when the election actually came it was judged by history to have been decided by quite different factors.\" The party the Tory party most had to fear was the Tory party itself, he said.

Hunt said: \"It's clearly a setback. It's a massive unfairness in the system.

But he could get more money from top rate taxpayers more easily.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It's pretty hard for any government to make serious savings without doing something on welfare. [Osborne has] ruled out a higher rate of income tax ... he's ruled out this big extra increase in housing taxation. What does that leave? It sort of depends on what you mean by the rich.</p> <p>You might mean by the rich that top 1% who pay 50p tax at the moment. If he's not going to do anything with that tax rate then beyond avoidance and evasion measures, there is not a lot you can do unless you're going to do something with wealth or housing.</p> <p>But if by rich you mean the four million or so of us who pay the 40p, then clearly you can do a lot more, including increasing that, increasing national insurance contributions, increasing other bits of council tax.</p> <p>[Osborne] didn't define what he meant by rich which makes it very easy for everyone to think I'm not rich, someone else is going to pay.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Nick Pearce</strong>, the director of the&#xa0;Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR), said the Treasury could over time achieve huge savings by raising benefits in line with earnings rather than inflation.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Earnings growth has been weak this year, and using the relevant three-month average figure to July 2012 would mean benefits are uprated by 1.5%, rather than the 2.5% expected level of CPI.</p> <p>This might not look like much, but it will be applied to a baseline of some \u00a350bn of spending, depending on how wide the chancellor casts his net, and the new baseline will then be lower for the uprating in subsequent years - such that, by 2016/17, the government will be making quite large benefit savings.</p> <p>This kind of fiscal drag for the poor is a favourite Treasury manoeuvre to cut social security spending.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-10-08T15:59:48.592Z\">at 4.59pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5072ddc4c0e361310bc6c9e0\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-08T14:05:56.899Z\">3.05pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here's some more reaction to the George Osborne speech.</p> <p>From <strong>Craig Bennett</strong>, Friends of the Earth policy and campaigns director:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Generous shale gas tax breaks show the chancellor clearly isn\u2019t listening to the increasingly vociferous warnings from leading politicians, businesses and climate experts about his reckless dash for gas.</p> </blockquote> <p>From <strong>Paul Kenny</strong>, the GMB general secretary:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Slashing people's employment rights under the guise of ownership schemes won't create jobs and it won't create growth.</p> <p>His attempts to dupe the electorate that he knows what he is doing have been rumbled. George Osborne has as much knowledge about economics as a stick of rhubarb.</p> </blockquote> <p>From <strong>John Longworth,</strong> director general of the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC):</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Osborne was right to acknowledge that the country must face up to the challenge of global competitiveness through enterprise, effort, aspiration and a real sense of urgency. We face a choice of becoming a Ruritanian museum or a dynamic and prosperous economy, which could be uncomfortable for some in the Conservative party.</p> <p>The chancellor's announcement of a new form of business ownership, with individuals swapping greater employment flexibility for an equity stake in the company, could be a useful option for some new and fast-growing businesses. It is an innovative and imaginative proposal that deserves to be tried out, but it is unlikely to be a game-changer.</p> </blockquote> <p>From<strong> Len McCluskey</strong>, general secretary of Unite:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>George Osborne's repetition of 'we are all in this together' is an insult to millions of families struggling to make ends meet and meaningless to the one in seven children who regularly go without a hot meal. His cuts will turn decent people into desperate people.</p> </blockquote> <p>From <strong>Helen Barnard</strong>, programme manager for poverty at the Joseph Rowntree Foundation:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Cutting benefits for groups who receive little public sympathy may make for a good conference speech, but it risks increasing poverty and hardship. And unless there is a follow-up masterplan for creating more and better jobs, massively increasing access to them and sorting out the housing crisis, it's not likely to do as much as those advocating further cuts are hoping to reduce the deficit or people's dependency on the state.</p> </blockquote> <p>From<strong> Campbell Robb</strong>, chief executive of Shelter:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Most under-25s who can live with their parents already do so. Being under 25 is being used as shorthand for people who don\u2019t have responsibilities or adult commitments, whereas in reality more than half of young people who claim housing benefit already have a family of their own. Others have left home to get married, move for job opportunities, or escape serious problems in their family home.</p> </blockquote> <p>From <strong>Sarah Jackson</strong>, chief executive of Working Families, a work-life balance charity:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Employers beware. Offering owner employee contracts - where employees effectively sell their employment rights for shares - is unlikely to deliver the highly motivated, engaged workforce you need.</p> <p>Few men or women with family responsibilities would want such a contract and we would advise callers to our free legal helpline to think long and hard before accepting such a one-way deal. Shares can go down as well as up. You could end up with no job security or employment rights and worthless shares.</p> </blockquote> <p>From <strong>Fiona Weir,</strong> chief executive of Gingerbread, the charity for single parents:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>This announcement [the proposed welfare cuts] comes at a time when families are already struggling, and risks plunging even more children into poverty. It\u2019s vital that we separate fact from fiction. The vast majority of people who receive government support do so because they can\u2019t earn enough to support their families, or even find a job in the first place.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-10-08T16:05:57.920Z\">at 5.05pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5072d5db58f91d7bbadac0b7\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-08T13:32:11.866Z\">2.32pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Nick Clegg</strong> has been talking about the welfare cuts being floated by George Osborne.

(<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/interactive/2012/sep/25/liberaldemocrats-clegg-cameron-miliband-interactive\">You can also see that in this graphic of Guardian/ICM polls since the election</a>.)</p> <p>\"The budget was the worst received budget since the late 1990s,\" said Ipsos Mori's Gideon Skinner. \"Across all ages, across all social classes, across men and women, the Conservative vote has fallen,\" he said. \"They have gone to the left, to the right. You've lost votes to Ukip, but the same number [5%] to Labour. It's not gone just to one wing or one demographic group. The fall is just as much among urban voters as it is among rural.\"</p> <p>\"David Cameron's ratings are falling as well,\" he added. Showing graphs comparing the popularity of incoming prime ministers, he said: \"Cameron's ratings are not a million miles away from where Gordon Brown's were at the same time.\"</p> <p>Ed Miliband, meanwhile, \"has at least steadied the fall\" in his ratings - but all these figures were compiled before the conference speech Miliband made last week that has been widely hailed as an important move towards improving his image.</p> <p>Skinner said of the 2012 budget: \"The rhetoric, the story of 'we're all in it together', it just doesn't resonate with people.\"</p> <p>One chink of light for the Conservatives was that the economy remained the public's number one concern. \"It's all about the economy, the economy, the economy and jobs,\" Skinner said, and the Tories still have a lead over Labour on that issue - albeit only one of 30-25.</p> <p>Fraser Nelson of the Spectator said the budget had been so disastrous for the government not because it was harsh, \"but because it was so comically, shambolically delivered. People just got the general sense that the government doesn't know what it's doing.\"</p> <p>Skinner mentioned in passing that Europe remained low on the public's list of concerns, but Rory Stewart, the Penrith and the Border MP with a colourful background in Iraq and Afghanistan, expressed scepticism about this, given that Cameron's EU \"veto\" in December 2011 had bumped up his personal ratings.</p> <p>\"Let's just focus on Europe for a second,\" he said (in truth, it's never far from the surface here), going on to say that there was a strong argument for an EU referendum given that \"since the 1970s people have not become comfortable with Europe and the politicians have not given people a chance to express that, and this is fundamentally unjust\". He conceded though that this didn't really matter much if people didn't feel strongly about this \"crisis of legitimacy\", as the polls suggest.</p> <p>My impression was that he didn't quite believe the polls on this point, however, and Nelson backed him on this, saying: \"They do [care about Europe]. They care about it a lot.\"</p> <p>Skinner said of Cameron's anti-EU poll boost: \"It was a one-off.

But Osborne said the sentiment still applied.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>On the eve of the election, I told this conference: we're all in this together.</p> <p>It was more than a slogan. It spoke of our values and of our intent ...</p> <p>Three years later, my message remains the same:</p> <p>We're not going to get through this as a country if we set one group against another, if we divide, denounce and demonise.</p> <p>We need an effort from each and every one.</p> </blockquote> <p>In another passage in the speech he insisted that the Conservatives were the real one-nation party, although he defined one-nation almost entirely in terms of the group also being defined as \"strivers\".</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We modern Conservatives represent all those who aspire, all who work, save and hope, all who feel a responsibility to put in, not just take out.</p> <p>Whether it's the owner of the corner shop staying open until midnight to support their family.</p> <p>Or the teacher prepared to defy her union and stay late to take the after-school club.</p> <p>Or the commuter who leaves home before the children are up, and comes back long after they have gone to bed, because they want a better life for them.</p> <p>Or the pensioner, who has saved all their life, and doesn't want to spend it all as they want to pass something on to their children.</p> <p>Or the entrepreneur who doesn't cash out and pack up, but devotes their flair and energy to building the next success story.</p> <p>They are all part of one nation, one nation working together to get on.</p> <p>That is the nation we represent.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>\u2022 He said that, as the government tried to find savings worth \u00a316bn in the next spending round, he wanted 80% of the money to come from spending cuts rather than tax rises (as happened in the last round of spending cuts).</strong></p> <p><strong>\u2022 He said that he and Iain Duncan Smith had agreed to reduce welfare spending by \u00a310bn by 2015 and he identified three areas where there would be cuts: indexing benefits in line with inflation; housing benefit for the young; benefits for families with several children.</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>For how can we justify the incomes of those out of work rising faster than the incomes of those in work?</p> <p>How can we justify giving flats to young people who have never worked, when working people twice their age are still living with their parents because they can't afford their first home?</p> <p>How can we justify a system where people in work have to consider the full financial costs of having another child, whilst those who are out of work don't?</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>\u2022 He said that he had increased taxes overall on the very richest in every budget he had introduced.</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>In every single year of this parliament the rich will pay a greater share of our nation's tax revenues than in any one of the 13 years that Labour were in office.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>\u2022 He said that when it came to getting the wealthy to pay more, his priority would be dealing with tax evasion and tax avoidance.</strong></p> <p>He would continue to insist on those with \"the broadest shoulders\" paying the most, he said.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>When it comes to the richest, the first place I will look is to those who are still not paying the taxes we expect them to pay today.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>\u2022 He said it was unrealistic to cut the size of the public sector any faster than it is already being cut.</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We're reducing the size of government, from almost 50% of our national income to 40%, in just five years.</p> <p>I just don't think it's realistic to cut a great deal faster than that.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>\u2022 He said that the government would not abandon its economic strategy.</strong></p> <p>Edward Heath did in 1972, and the result was \"more inflation, more strikes and the three day week\". Margaret Thatcher held firm in 1981 and she succeeded. Osborne said the government would follow Thatcher.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Today, in the face of the great economic challenges of our age we resolve: we will press on and we shall overcome.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>\u2022 He said the government was \"the most radical and reforming\" for a generation.</strong></p> <p><strong>\u2022 He said that some western countries would become \"poorer and poorer\" in the face of global competition.</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Western democracies like ours are being out-worked, out-competed and out-smarted by these new economies.</p> <p>The question for countries like Britain is this: are we going to sink or swim?</p> <p>And the truth is some western countries won't keep up, they won't make the changes needed to welfare and education and tax, they'll fall further and further behind ...<br>&#xa0;<br>... they'll become poorer and poorer.</p> <p>I am determined that will not be the Britain I leave to my children, or you leave to yours.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-10-08T15:37:58.637Z\">at 4.37pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5072cbcdc0e361310bc6c9d0\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-08T12:49:17.705Z\">1.49pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here's reaction to Osborne's speech from <strong>John Cridland</strong>, the CBI director general.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The chancellor was right to remind Britain that there is no real alternative to deficit reduction.

None of us wants to make the lives of the less well-off even more difficult.</p> <p>To achieve this, we need to deliver better public services at lower cost and, in my view, the government needs to be bolder in bringing in charities and companies with innovative ways of serving the public.</p> </blockquote> <p>This is what he said about the employee-owner scheme.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>In some of Britain's cutting-edge entrepreneurial companies, the option of share ownership may be attractive to workers, rather than some of their employment rights.

And he failed to mention growth or set out any policies to deliver the jobs and growth we need to get the deficit down.</p> <p>The reason why George Osborne has been forced to talk about billions more cuts into the next parliament is because his failure to deliver economic growth means he will break his promise to balance the books by 2015. There do need to be savings in the welfare budget, but the benefits bill is soaring under this government because unemployment is so high.</p> <p>He will never be a one nation chancellor when he is pressing ahead with a tax cut for millionaires while asking millions of pensioners and families to pay more.

Our members know what it's like to take tough decisions in order to succeed, and he is right to stick to that path.</p> <p>The IoD applauds his innovative proposal on employee ownership, which could make a real difference to jobs and shareholding. This scheme has the potential to reduce the employment law burden on companies and make employees better off at the same time. The key to the success of the idea will be in encouraging employers and workers to make use of it.</p> <p>The chancellor is also right to hail the potential of shale gas. As we have argued, shale gas represents a really valuable asset, right on our own doorstep.</p> </blockquote> <p>From <strong>Chris Leslie</strong>, a shadow Treasury minister:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>To hear the chancellor of the exchequer you\u2019d think that all was rosy in the garden, growth was motoring ahead. He didn\u2019t mention unemployment, he didn\u2019t really confront that issue about borrowing actually quite significantly higher \u2013 22% higher this year. Surely what our task is now, before we get to 2015, is to focus on job creation.</p> </blockquote> <p>From <strong>Rhian Beynon</strong>, head of policy at Family Action:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>George Osborne is scraping the barrel for cuts that do not make good economic sense. Removing housing benefit from under 25s will make it even more difficult for hard pressed young people to find employment and move on. It is not the answer. Neither is punishing children because a parent is out of work. There is already a welfare cap coming in which places limitations on benefits for large families. These further cuts to the welfare budget could spell disaster for the children and families we support.</p> </blockquote> <p>From <strong>Ceri Goddard</strong>, the Fawcett Society\u2019s chief executive:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>If the government pursues yet another massive swath of welfare cuts it will be critical, and a legal requirement, that they properly assess and are upfront about how this could further disadvantage women far more than men.</p> <p>If, as seems likely, women will be yet again worst hit when it comes to a further reduction in welfare, the government will either have to properly and publicly justify this or tell us how they intend to mitigate the effects of such a such a skewed impact.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-10-08T13:28:53.744Z\">at 2.28pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5072c1d6c0e361310bc6c9ca\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-08T12:06:46.216Z\">1.06pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><a href=\"http://www.cpc12.org.uk/Speeches/George_Osborne.aspx\">The full text of Osborne's speech is now on the Conservative party's conference website.</a></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-1859f4f6-5ab7-4e59-a15e-d17f73f11a64\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/8/1349701628188/George-Osborne-010.jpg\" alt=\"George Osborne\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The chancellor in full flow.

Priti Patel (<a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Britannia-Unchained-Global-Lessons-Prosperity/dp/1137032235\">one of the rising stars of the Tory right wing</a>), said that if the European commission president Jose Manuel Barroso \"wants to press ahead with a treaty change before 2015 that is going to be a real wake-up call for our prime minister and our government\".</p> <p>She added: \"We cannot sit back and watch some shoddy deal \u2026 without giving the British public a say.\" This was a \"tremendous opportunity for a British prime minister to rebalance our relationship and put Britain first\".</p> <p>Daniel Hannan, the Tory MEP and popular anti-EU lightning rod, also called for a referendum. He pointed out that in May the combined GDP of the Commonwealth overtook that of the eurozone, and lamented: \"We are obliged to restrict trade with the growing bits of the world in the way that we didn't do in the 1930s.\" Meanwhile, \"Europe is now spiralling down as it mulishly does all the things that have caused it to be in its present predicament.\"</p> <p>The ubiquitous ConservativeHome editor Tim Montgomerie warned that it would be more difficult to win an EU referendum than many anti-Brussels campaigners thought. \"The polls are not as wide in our support as some of us would like to believe. From the AV referendum we know that the British people tend to prefer the status quo unless there is a very good reason to change, and I think that would be the case with either renegotiation or leaving.\"</p> <p>All that was before the anti-EU side had to grapple with the opposition of business and the media and before the EU could make \"cosmetic\" changes to try to head off a UK exit.</p> <p>He added: \"Are we organised for the moment if David Cameron finally - or some other person - gives it to us? Probably at the moment the answer to that question is no.\"</p> <p>Hannan and Patel agreed with all that, but Patrick O'Flynn of the Daily Express, also on the panel, demurred, saying: \"There is no status quo. We're having a fiscal union created.\"</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Correction:</strong> The zombies were anti-euro, not anti-Tory.

And that is where his problem lies, because he does not have that evidence. And this audience knows it. They don't want Miliband bashing - or not much of it.

Labour, or his Tory critics, would be foolish to underestimate him. Gordon Brown made that mistake when he became Prime Minister, regarding his opponent as a chinless wonder and privileged weakling. In October 2007, in the week of the infamous election that never was, Mr Cameron bounced back with another powerful peroration: \u201cCall that election. We will fight. Britain will win.\u201d</p> <p>But the reminder of that speech, made five years ago last week, illustrates Mr Cameron\u2019s dilemma. By now his party is used to these last-minute rescue jobs. It knows that Mr Cameron excels at giving speeches in a crisis, when his back is against the wall.

Here are the main points. I've taken the quotes from the Press Association and <a href=\"http://www.politicshome.com\">PoliticsHome.</a></p> <p><strong>\u2022 Osborne has conceded that austerity could last until 2018.</strong><a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2b77439c-0f0d-11e2-9343-00144feabdc0,Authorised=false.html?_i_location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ft.com%2Fcms%2Fs%2F0%2F2b77439c-0f0d-11e2-9343-00144feabdc0.html&amp;_i_referer=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ft.com%2Fworld%2Fuk\"> Today the Financial Times (paywall) is splashing on a story saying that, based on its own calculation, Britain will not get the deficit under control until then. </a>Asked about this timetable, Osborne said: \"I'm saying, yes, the road is longer than anyone hoped. We've got to find more cuts.\" In a separate interview, when asked about the FT story, Osborne blamed Labour.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Look, who is responsible for creating these debts? I didn't rack up these debts. Ed Balls, who actually wants to take my job, is the man who racked up these debts.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>\u2022 Osborne said the Tories wanted some of the savings to come from welfare and that this was a dividing line with Labour.</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Let me be clear, those with the broadest shoulders must bear the broadest burden but our perception of fairness - and this is perhaps where we differ from the Labour party - also extends to the welfare system.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>\u2022 He accused some people of abusing the welfare system.</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We also think it is unfair that person leaves their home early in the morning and they pull the door behind them and they are going to do their job and they look at their next-door neighbour, the blinds are down and that family is living a life on benefits. That is unfair as well and we are going to tackle that as part of tackling this country's economic problems.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>\u2022 He said he wanted a public debate on whether it was fair to limit child-related benefits available to the unemployed.</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\"When you are on benefits you automatically get extra money when you have a child, so, you can be better off ... We are just asking the question, does that work? Is that the right value we have in our society?\"</p> </blockquote> <p>He also questioned whether it was fair to pay housing benefit to people who go straight from school onto the dole, and he said the government would propose specific policy measures over the next few months to address these issues.</p> <p><strong>\u2022 He said that advocating a 50p top rate of tax was \"a phoney conception of fairness\".</strong> Under the coalition, the rich were paying more in tax than under Labour, he said. But he abolished the 50p rate because it was making Britain \"uncompetitive\".</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The people who were paying the price for that phoney 50p rate were actually the poor looking for work, not the rich. So I found other ways to tax the rich. We\u2019re clamping down on tax avoidance in a way that has never been done before in this country.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-10-08T09:13:05.706Z\">at 10.13am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5072835958f93d334375427c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-08T07:40:09.442Z\">8.40am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>AntiAstroturfer in the comments has spotted a wonderful typo in an earlier post.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>At 0814, a great typo:</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>Q: Shouldn't you admit that you will miss your target to have debt falling by 2015?</p> <p>Osborne says he has cut the budget deficit by 25%.

All of this will require some tough choices, but those choices will be guided by clear principles and a vision of what the welfare system should be.</p> <p>It should be a support for those who need our help but also a system that always requires those who are out of work to make the same kind of choices as those in work.</p> <p>Now we must pose some of the questions we need to answer.

  "<p>A personal milestone may be in sight for one of Newmarket's hottest properties should Moohaajim be able to supply Marco Botti with a first British Group One winner in Saturday's Middle Park Stake.</p> <p>At a time when other trainers in the town are feeling the pinch and scaling back, the Italian Botti recently opened a new yard on the Snailwell Road that will accommodate up to 95 horses, with yearlings and those out of training remaining at his existing Green Ridge base on the other side of town.</p> <p>Along with Moohaajim Botti has other important targets in the weeks ahead, with Joshua Tree heading to Woodbine for this weekend's Canadian International, while Jakkalberry is already in quarantine in Australia ahead of his planned runs in the Caulfield Cup and Melbourne Cup.</p> <p>But Moohaajim represents an interesting new link for the trainer, as the first horse he has trained for Sheikh Mohammed Bin Khalifa Al Maktoum, a cousin of Sheikh Mohammed who owns the Abington Place stables in Newmarket and a number of horses, many of whom race for Mike de Kock in South Africa and Dubai.</p> <p>Botti was approached by representatives of the sheikh before April's Breeze-up sales in the town and this colt, purchased by the trainer for \u00a3210,000, was the result.</p> <p>\"I liked him a lot and so did David Redvers, who was the underbidder, but I think he did the fastest or the second-fastest time of the whole day and he was a good-looking horse, with the pedigree to suggest he would make a three-year-old,\" said Botti.</p> <p>A winner on his debut, Moohaajim finished only fifth in the Prix Morny next time out behind Reckless Abandon, with whom he will renew rivalries on Saturday. But he still looked very much in need of the experience that day and subsequently impressed when taking the Mill Reef Stakes at Newbury last month.</p> <p>Botti confirmed that Adam Kirby, who rode Reckless Abandon to the first two wins of his career, will retain his partnership with Moohaajim.</p> <p>\"I didn't really go into the details but Adam has told me he is going to ride and he knows the horse well,\" said the trainer. \"I'm hoping we don't get soft ground. Good to soft will be OK but soft ground would be frustrating. He's a good mover.\"</p> <p>Given his owner's keenness to tackle Dubai's big prizes in the past, Botti might have expected that the UAE 2,000 Guineas would be on the agenda for Moohaajim but instead the colt will remain with Botti over the winter to be aimed at next spring's European Classics.</p> <p>His pedigree gives hope that one mile could be within his stamina range and Botti believes as much himself, saying: \"There was no reason why we couldn't have run him at seven furlongs this season but, with the Dewhurst [over seven furlongs] on the same day [as the Middle Park], we thought it best to stick with the stiff six.\"</p> <p>Such comments once again highlight the confusion over Newmarket's calendar which since last year has seen two similarly prestigious championship contests for colts shunted to within 35 minutes of each other.</p> <p>It is with some justification that Newmarket bill the meeting as Future Champions Day, given the horses that have won both races in the past, but common sense dictates that it is surely worth taking another look at the running order.</p> <p>With three further championship contests for two-year-olds \u2013 the Cheveley Park Stakes, Fillies' Mile and Royal Lodge Stakes \u2013 also taking place a fortnight earlier at the Cambridgeshire meeting, Newmarket's racing programme has become jumbled since the Champion Stakes and other contests were removed to create Ascot's Champions Day card.</p> <p>Newmarket's managing director, Amy Starkey, described herself as \"a big fan of Champions Day\", as might be expected given that Jockey Club Racecourses, Newmarket's parent company, are the biggest shareholder in British Champions Series Ltd.</p> <p>But, caught between trying to maintain some of the old chronology for these contests and facing up to the fact that a race such as the Fillies' Mile deserves better than to take place in front of a moderate Friday crowd, Starkey must consider the possibility of further changes to the programme.</p> <p>\"We are always looking at how we can we move things forward\" was her diplomatic comment but her decision to offer all students with ID free entry to Saturday's meeting as part of the 'Racing For Jobs' initiative shows that she understands the importance of getting bums back on seats at the track.</p> <p>Moohaajim was one of 12 entries for the Middle Park at Monday's five-day confirmation stage, with Aidan O'Brien leaving in a team of four as he searches for his first British two-year-old winner of the year. The unbeaten New Approach heads the 15 left in the Dewhurst.</p>",
  "<p>BP is <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/sep/19/bp-close-sale-texas-city-refinery\" title=\"\">close to reaching its $38bn disposals target</a> after selling its Texas City refinery, where 15 people died and 170 were injured in an explosion in 2005, to Marathon Petroleum for $2.5bn (\u00a31.55bn).</p> <p>The sale brings to an end a sorry chapter in BP's history: it had to pay $13m in July to settle 409 safety violations found by the US Occupational Safety and Health Administration following the disaster, which was the worst industrial accident in the US for a generation. It happened when workers overfilled a container with volatile chemicals, sparking an explosion.</p> <p>The settlement removed a major hurdle for the disposal of the refinery, which turns 475,000 barrels of oil a day into petrol and jet fuel. Two years ago, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2010/aug/12/bp-texas-city-explosion-fine\" title=\"\">BP was fined a record $50.6m</a> for failing to fix hazards at the site south-east of Houston, Texas, and agreed to spend at least $500m on safety improvements. BP said it paid out well over $2bn in civil claims, fines and penalties relating to the 2005 explosion.</p> <p>Texas City refinery manager Keith Casey said the site had been transformed through an increased focus on safety and in recent months returned to profitability. \"It does not, however, fit with the long-term strategic direction of BP's global refining portfolio,\" he said.</p> <p>The sale price is made up of $600m in cash, $1.2bn for inventories and $700m that Marathon will pay BP over the next six years in an \"earn-out\" arrangement based on the refinery's future operation and margins.</p> <p>The 2,200 people working at Texas City are expected to transfer to the new owner, a \"downstream\" company (ie involved in selling and distributing natural gas and crude oil products) which already has a small refinery in Texas City.</p> <p>BP initially embarked on a $23bn selling spree to raise cash for liabilities and fines after the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010, then last year it raised the target amount it wanted to raise from selling \"non-core\" assets to $38bn.</p> <p>The sale of the Texas City refinery, which also includes liquified natural gas pipelines and four marketing terminals in the south-east US, comes after the recent offloading of BP's Carson refinery in California and brings the total disposals to $35bn.</p> <p>BP has been keen to scale down its refining operations, where profit margins are thin. The company is confident of reaching its $38bn target by the end of next year, although it has not hoisted the \"for sale\" sign over any other assets.</p> <p>BP took a $38bn charge related to the Gulf of Mexico disaster. So far it has spent $14bn cleaning up the oil spill; paid out more than $8bn in claims; and agreed a <a href=\"http://www.bp.com/genericarticle.do?categoryId=2012968&amp;contentId=7073667\" title=\"\">settlement with the Plaintiffs Steering Committee</a> \u2013 which represents affected individuals and small businesses \u2013 which is expected to cost the company another $8bn.</p> <p>The US department of justice has said it expects to find BP guilty of gross negligence in a court case which restarts in January. If the government can prove gross negligence it can triple the damages BP may have to pay to $21bn.</p> <p>\"Today's announcement is the second major milestone in the strategic refocusing of our US fuels business,\" said Iain Conn, chief executive of BP's global refining and marketing business. \"Together with the sale of our Carson, California refinery, announced in August, the divestment of Texas City will allow us to focus BP's US fuels investments on our three northern refineries.\"</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/aug/13/bp-sells-californian-refinery-carson\" title=\"\">energy giant sold its Carson refinery</a> to Tesoro for $2.5bn but is investing heavily in three core US sites: Whiting in Indiana, Cherry Point in Washington and Toledo in Ohio. Last month it disposed of oil and gas fields in the Gulf of Mexico to Plains Exploration for $5.5bn.</p>",
  "<p>Having your stomach removed isn't the best way of celebrating your birthday. This, nevertheless, was how 18-year-old Gaby Scanlon spent her coming of age. Out on the town in Lancaster last weekend, <a href=\"http://www.itv.com/news/2012-10-07/teenager-has-stomach-removed-after-drinking-liquid-nitrogen-cocktail/\" title=\"\">Scanlon perforated her stomach wall after drinking a cocktail prepared with liquid nitrogen</a>.</p> <p>Liquid nitrogen was once just an obscure chemical used in a completely different context by high-end chefs such as <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/ferran-adria\" title=\"\">Ferran Adri\u00e0</a> and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/hestonblumenthal\" title=\"\">Heston Blumenthal</a>. They used it to flash-freeze food \u2013 a technique now mimicked in restaurants across the UK.</p> <p>Should we be worried? Not if you're in a restaurant, says <a href=\"http://www.thisisscunthorpe.co.uk/Flavour-boosting-liquid-nitrogen-technique-comes/story-15130887-detail/story.html\" title=\"\">Colin McGurran, chef proprietor of Winteringham Fields, Lincolnshire</a>. \"When liquid nitrogen is used to make cocktails, it remains as an active ingredient,\" says McGurran. \"But in a kitchen, we just use it as a cooling mechanism.\"</p> <p>Nitrogen boils at -196C \u2013 so once it is released from its container, it turns immediately into a vapour, before disappearing completely. The vapour is extremely cold: when sprayed on food, the food freezes in an instant. One chef, Spaniard Dani Garcia, <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2010/07/17/cooking_with_liquid_nitrogen/\" title=\"\">uses it to create icy balls of frozen oil</a>. Others, such as McGurran, like to make ice-cream or sorbet: <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utjdLDojbCw#t=1m27s\" title=\"\">the flash-freezing creates smaller, smoother ice crystals</a>. \"It simply helps the sorbet cool down quickly \u2013 faster than it would in a freezer,\" says McGurran. \"Ice crystals don't get to set, so the sorbet tastes more like a smooth puree.\"</p> <p>In this context, liquid nitrogen is still dangerous \u2013 it can be too cold to touch \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.thelocal.de/society/20090713-20575.html\" title=\"\">while one German amateur lost his hand in an explosion</a>. But because the chemical is used as a tool rather than an ingredient, diners themselves don't have much to worry about.</p> <p>That's not necessarily the case in some bars. It's not yet known what kind of cocktail Scanlon drank, but McGurran advises against drinking anything mixed with liquid nitrogen or containing nitrogen ice-cubes. The icy liquid might corrode your insides directly \u2013 or start to boil, expand rapidly, and then put too much pressure on your stomach.</p> <p>As for Scanlon, happily she has survived \u2013 probably with her oesophagus sewn directly to her intestine. She can still eat normally, just in smaller portions. \"Maybe 'stay off the liquid nitrogen' is not a fucking funny thing to say to me,\" she tweeted. \"I nearly died.\"</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 9 October 2012. The original said that a German amateur lost his hand after lighting liquid nitrogen by mistake. Liquid nitrogen is not flammable.</p>",

Allowing gay marriage would cause deep divisions in society \"without giving gays a single right they do not have in civil partnership\", he said.</p> <p>At a Coalition for Marriage rally on the fringe of the Conservative conference in Birmingham on Monday, Carey joined David Burrowes, the backbench MP for Enfield Southgate, and former MP Ann Widdecombe in protesting that neither the Lib Dem nor Tory 2010 manifesto included a pledge to legalise gay marriage.</p> <p>Carey claimed that in some countries where same-sex marriage had been made legal \u2013 including Mexico, Brazil and the Netherlands \u2013 it had led to unforeseen consequences such as three-person marriages.</p> <p>Asked about opponents of gay marriage being described as \"bigots\" \u2013 on one occasion by Nick Clegg, the deputy prime minister \u2013 Carey said: \"Let us remember the Jews in Nazi Germany. What started against them was when they started to be called names.</p> <p>\"And that was the first stage towards that totalitarian state. We have to resist them. We treasure democracy. We treasure our Christian inheritance and we want to debate this in a fair way.\"</p> <p>Widdecombe said: \"This is not an anti-gay rally. It is defending marriage.\"</p> <p>Outside the town hall rally, attended by about 400 people, gay rights protesters accused the platform of promoting \"marriage apartheid\" by denying the right to marry on equal terms.</p> <p>Cameron has joined the US president, Barack Obama, in endorsing same-sex marriage and is poised to report on the results of a 12-week consultation before proceeding to legislate. All main parties, including the SNP government in Edinburgh, now endorse the change.</p> <p>Burrowes urged ministers to stage a referendum on the issue, as has been done in 32 US states with mixed results. He said there had been no pressure for a change to civil partnership before the election \u2013 \"no letters, emails or tweets\" from voters \u2013 but MPs' postbags were now full of the controversy. \"If the government can think again about pasties and caravans it can certainly do so about the important issue of marriage,\" he said.</p> <p>Widdecombe, a former Home Office minister, said such consequences would include the replacement of cherished liturgy and names such as \"mother\" and \"father\" with \"progenitor A and progenitor B\" or \"partners to the marriage\". Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, the French president, was proposing to use the word \"carers\", she said.</p> <p>Carey argued that teachers, doctors and other professionals might be forced out of their jobs if they refused to embrace the proposed change to the law, an intolerant restriction on free speech that Widdecombe said could make the Church of England force disestablishment.</p> <p>\"I know, David Cameron, that is not the sort of Britain you want,\" she said.Carey hinted that the prime minister might have conceded the policy on \"pragmatic\" grounds to sustain his coalition with the Lib Dems \u2013 \"the very worst of reasons\".</p> <p>Ben Summerskill, the chief executive of gay rights group Stonewall, said: \"We're deeply saddened that Lord Carey seems to be resorting to student union abuse. The reality is that gay people are very well aware of the consequences of the Holocaust, for obvious reasons, and when someone descends to this level of rhetoric it suggests they don't think they have very powerful arguments to rely on.</p> <p>\"Lord Carey is perfectly entitled to his view and we respect that. It's the view of many people of his generation and we accept that, but to compare Cameron to Hitler is just sad as well as being entirely inappropriate.</p> <p>\"It's extraordinary that he should resort to this sort of invective and profoundly unchristian. There will be gay people of faith who are very disturbed by what he has said.</p> <p>\"The argument is lost already but that doesn't mean the battle won't be a rough one when the time comes. But it is surprising they couldn't come up with a more persuasive argument for this, the apex of their campaign for which they have had had plenty of time to marshall their arguments.\"</p>",
  "<h2>BORN SLIPPY</h2> <p>We live in a world where language is slippier than a Tory chancellor dodging questions about Britain's tanking economy while ice-skating on a banana. Up to 100,000 badgers aren't at risk of being shot or murdered, merely 'culled' \u2013 which makes getting a bullet through the head sound as yeahwhatever as reducing your friends' list on Facebook. And these days footballers aren't guilty of diving or cheating, or tumbling to the grass like a foal at the first scent of spring, but 'simulation'. Which is a nothing word. A pathetic word. A word probably dreamed up by a grey Fifa suit on a grey day in his grey office while trying to be as inoffensive as possible.</p> <p>Well, it failed. The Fiver finds itself crazily offended by the word simulation. Yes, below the line crazy. What a pathetic, spineless, unnecessary creation of a word! Grow a pair, Fifa! It's diving, pure and simple \u2013 and two of the finest exponents, Luis Suarez and Gareth Bale, were at it again yesterday, Louganising themselves across the turf to the fury of all-right-thinking people everywhere. And Stoke manager Tony Pulis, who says he is \"concerned\". \"It's a tough enough job as it is,\" he sighed. \"For professional footballers to be doing that is just not right. Give [Suarez] three games and he will stop falling over.\"</p> <p>Sadly, there is more chance of the Football Association making Pulis its next director of one-touch passing than bringing in retrospective video evidence. It's commonly assumed that Fifa, a body with Women's Institute levels of conservatism, would disallow such a bold manouevre but that's not necessarily the case. The MLS, for instance, now has an anonymous five-man disciplinary committee that doles out fines and suspensions for diving. To do the same in England it just needs the small matter of the FA and its stakeholders, the Premier League, Football League, Uefa, Fifa, the PFA, the LMA, and the PGMO, which represents match officials, to agree on the need to change the current rul \u2026 ah, no need to go on, is there?</p> <h2>QUOTE OF THE DAY</h2> <p>\"Some of the signings have been garbage.

Three \"cutting-edge thinkers and activists from the frontline of the battle for cyberspace\" are listed as co-authors: US-based Jacob Applebaum, Jeremie Zimmermann from France and German Andy M\u00fcller-Maguhn.</p> <p>The text is largely based on a transcript of <a href=\"http://digitaljournal.com/article/329576\" title=\"\">an interview Assange conducted</a> with the three others for an episode of his TV show, The World Tomorrow, broadcast in June on the Russian state-funded channel RT, Zimmermann told the Guardian. But he said there would be \"plenty of added content\".</p> <p>\"We covered a wide range of issues: from surveillance to data protection, from corporate influence over politics to citizen participation and action, transparency and accountability, from liberalism to anarchism, from copyright enforcement to culture, from flying killing robots (drones) to representation of crime scenes depicting abuse of children (child porn),\" he added in an email.</p> <p>Zimmermann, the co-founder and spokesman for the citizen advocacy group La Quadrature du Net, said he had insisted on a bottle of whisky and some cigars during the interview, \"to make the discussion more fluid, cosy and friendly\".</p> <p>The announcement comes a year after the publication of <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Julian-Assange-Unauthorised-Autobiography/dp/0857863851/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1349704976&amp;sr=1-1\" title=\"\">Julian Assange: The Unauthorised Autobiography</a>, which was issued by the publishers Canongate against the Australian's wishes after he withdrew from his contract but failed to return his advance.</p> <p>Last week Canongate <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-business-19841184\" title=\"\">blamed the collapse of its deal</a> with Assange, reportedly worth a total of \u00a3930,000, for operating losses of \u00a3368,000 last year.

The format of the book had evolved in discussions, he said, but more than half of it was new material.</p> <p>\"The issues they are discussing \u2013 how do you create an internet where secrecy by governments and powerful institutions is minimised and privacy for ordinary people is guaranteed? \u2013 are complicated questions,\" he said.</p> <p>Assange had received an advance for the book, he said, though he declined to reveal how much.</p>",

Couples take happy snaps with giant virility figures, and unabashed shoppers fondle realistic sex dolls (though not, this year, inflatable Obamas). The wealthiest can even choose a 100,000 yuan (\u00a310,000) solid gold \"pleasure object\" \u2013 the kind of high-class product that appeals to shoppers usually found in Louis Vuitton or Dolce &amp; Gabbana, a sales assistant said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397375164\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/8/1349705104501/Chinese-sex-fair-catwalk-010.jpg\" alt=\"Chinese sex fair catwalk\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Men photograph semi-clad models on a catwalk at the fair.

Women have hymen restoration surgery so their husbands will believe they are virgins. Two years ago, an academic was jailed for hosting sex parties.

Are they prudish about sex or are they incredibly liberated?\" asked Richard Burger, whose new book, Behind the Red Door, chronicles the history of sex in China.</p> <p>He argues that for centuries China's leaders have swung between sexual openness and repression. In the Tang dynasty, prostitutes were registered; the late Ming saw explicit novels such as The Plum in the Golden Vase.</p> <p>At times, homosexual love has been celebrated. At other times, erotic books have been burned.</p> <p>In the west, the sexual revolution was part of a wider movement of personal liberation and challenges to authority.

  "<p>Julian Assange's supporters have been ordered to forfeit \u00a393,500 in bail money after the WikiLeaks founder sought political asylum in the Ecuadorean embassy in London.</p> <p>A court ruled on Monday that the payments must be made within a month by nine friends and backers who in 2010 pledged \u00a3140,000 to guarantee Assange would abide by bail conditions during a failed legal challenge to extradition proceedings brought by authorities in Sweden, where he faces allegations of rape and sexual assault.</p> <p>Vaughan Smith, the former British army captain who hosted Assange at his Norfolk home while he was on bail throughout 2011, and had promised to pay \u00a320,000 if Assange skipped bail, was ordered to pay \u00a312,000, while Philip Knightly, a veteran Australian investigative journalist who exposed the British traitor Kim Philby as a Russian spy, was ordered to pay \u00a315,000, \u00a35,000 less than he originally pledged.</p> <p>Making the ruling at Westminster magistrates court, the chief magistrate, Howard Riddle, said he accepted that the sureties \"acted in good faith\", but said the system of sureties for defendants who want to remain at liberty would be undermined if cash was not forfeited.</p> <p>\"I accept that they trusted Mr Assange to surrender himself as required,\" he said. \"I accept that they followed the proceedings and made necessary arrangements to remain in contact with him. However, they failed in their basic duty, to ensure his surrender.\"</p> <p>Assange broke his bail conditions in June this year when he took refuge in the Ecuadorean embassy in Knightsbridge after he lost a supreme court challenge to the validity of the European arrest warrant that demanded his return to Sweden for questioning. He was due to be sent to Sweden within days when he took up residence in the diplomatic mission, where he was granted political asylum.</p> <p>Assange's colleagues in the WikiLeaks organisation, Joseph Farrell and Sarah Harrison, were ordered to pay \u00a33,500 each after originally pledging a combined \u00a310,000. Sir John Sulston, a Nobel-prize-winning biologist, was ordered to pay \u00a315,000 of the \u00a320,000 he pledged. Tracy Worcester, a model turned environmental campaigner, had to pay \u00a37,500 while Prof Tricia David, an educationalist, had to pay \u00a310,000 of the \u00a320,000 she promised. Caroline Michel, at one time Assange's literary agent, was ordered to pay \u00a315,000 of the \u00a320,000 she had promised.</p> <p>The forfeitures came after the nine sureties last week pleaded for leniency in a statement to the court read out by Smith. He had argued the sureties were powerless over Assange's decision to evade a European arrest warrant because it had become an \"unprecedented\" matter of diplomatic and inter-governmental concern.</p> <p>He also said they could not ignore the perceived risk that if Assange was extradited to Sweden he could end up in a US prison \"under unjust conditions\" and that to have urged Assange to give himself up would \"render us mercenary and contemptible individuals of great weakness of character\".</p> <p>In his ruling, the chief magistrate said he understood this final point and took \"some account of their integrity\", but dismissed the argument that Assange feared that he would be subsequently extradited to the United States and even Guant\u00e1namo Bay.</p> <p>\"It is not new and should have been taken into account by the sureties when entering into and maintaining their obligations,\" he said.</p> <p>\"What is undoubtedly unique is that the defendant sought, and has apparently been granted, asylum by Ecuador,\" the chief magistrate said. \"It was suggested that the defendant is simply seeking an alternative legal process. However, in principle I see no difference between seeking refuge in the Ecuadorean embassy, and taking flight to that country.\"</p> <p>He accepted that it was different in that \"this could take place without the need for travel documents, advanced flight arrangements and so on\".</p> <p>\"Secondly,\" he agreed, \"there remains the hope, expressed by all the sureties, that discussions between the relevant governments will lead to a solution, and in particular the solution of Mr Assange surrendering to the police here.\"</p> <p>He said he also took account of the sureties' means.</p> <p>\"Professor David is a pensioner and the sum of \u00a320,000 comprises a substantial portion of her savings jointly with her husband,\" he ruled.</p> <p>\"Sarah Saunders has also provided details of her financial position and I am satisfied that she is of comparatively limited means. Mr Vaughan Smith tells me that if he forfeits the \u00a320,000 surety it will have a significant impact on the welfare of his family and his employees.\"</p> <p>Smith said he was disappointed at the ruling and felt the sureties were being punished despite providing \"a public service\" in ensuring Assange met his bail conditions for 18 months until he entered the Ecuadorean embassy.</p> <p>\"We feel we've done our bit, but the ball has moved into another court now,\" he said. \"We feel there are many in this country who are sympathetic.\"</p> <p>He said he would have to borrow the money. \"I rely on an income from a farm and from my journalism and I don't have \u00a312,000 sitting in the bank,\" he said.</p> <p>It is understood that a separate group of Assange supporters, thought to include the film-maker Ken Loach, the writer and campaigner Jemima Khan, the journalist John Pilger and the magazine publisher Felix Dennis have already forfeited bail cash worth \u00a3200,000 following a court order earlier this year.</p>",
  "<p>France's first lady, Val\u00e9rie Trierweiler, has used diplomatic channels to send presents to a French woman who was jailed for 60 years in Mexico after being convicted of kidnapping.</p> <p>Books, beauty products and chocolates were sent to Florence Cassez in jail last week, according to Le Parisien newspaper, which says Trierweiler will send a similar parcel every month until she is freed.</p> <p>Struggling to find a role in a position that does not formally exist, Trierweiler's choice of worthy cause will find favour in France, where Cassez is widely viewed as a victim of Mexican injustice. Even the opposition will find it hard to criticise her choice; <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/feb/17/nicolas-sarkozy-mexico-florence-cassez\" title=\"\">the former president Nicolas Sarkozy's public support of Cassez triggered a diplomatic spat between France and Mexico</a>.</p> <p>\"It's a precious gesture that Florence much appreciated,\" Jean-Luc Romero, president of Cassez's support committee. \"Pressure from the Elys\u00e9e is important. It shows that France is still behind her and hasn't dropped her. She has been through difficult times recently.\"</p> <p>Cassez, 37, was sentenced to 60 years in jail in 2009 for taking part in kidnappings, associating with criminals and being in possession of illegal weapon. She has always maintained her innocence.</p> <p>Cassez was arrested in 2005 with her then boyfriend, Israel Vallarta, head of a notorious kidnapping gang. The long-running legal battle centres on how police handled the arrest and on evidence from kidnap victims who were blindfolded and never saw their captors, but claimed to have recognised Cassez's voice.</p> <p>Sarkozy made her plight a cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre, regularly telephoning her. But his blistering criticism of the Mexican authorities and decision in 2011 to \"dedicate\" a joint cultural year to Cassez led to Mexico pulling out of the event and a diplomatic crisis.</p> <p>His Elys\u00e9e successor, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, who has spoken to Cassez' parents by telephone \"several times\" according to reports, is determined to be more subtle, believing insulting the Mexican legal system will not help free her.</p> <p>A French diplomat in Mexico said Paris had decided to \"go carefully\" and let Mexican justice do its work. \"Any new attempt at pressure will be very badly seen. We have to treat lightly,\" the diplomat said.</p> <p>Romero, who accompanied the French president to Mexico for the meeting of G20 leaders in June, added: \"Hollande asked us what was the best way to proceed to avoid anything that might be seen as a provocation. We have learned the lesson.\"</p> <p>In March, Mexico's supreme court ruled 3-2 against releasing Cassez, but agreed to study her appeal after admitting her rights had been violated and claims of irregularities in her trial. It is expected to make a final decision whether to uphold or quash Cassez's conviction, or order a retrial, early in 2013.</p> <p>Cassez's French lawyer, Frank Berton, has called the situation \"a massive judicial impasse\". In Mexico, where kidnappings by criminal gangs are common, her case elicits little public sympathy and relatives of the kidnap victims have expressed outrage at her \"special treatment\" and possible release.</p> <p>Trierweiler's involvement has unfortunate echoes of the former first lady C\u00e9cilia Sarkozy's trip to Libya in 2007 to save a group of Bulgarian nurses jailed under Muammar Gaddafi. Nicolas Sarkozy claimed the release was a great success while European Union officials who had been working behind the scenes to secure the nurses' release accused the then French president of taking the credit for their work.</p> <p>Cassez's family and supporters hope Hollande will raise her case when he receives Mexico's new president Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto, who takes up office in December, at the Elys\u00e9e next week. At the same time, Trierweiler will have lunch with the Mexican first lady, Ang\u00e9lica Rivera.</p>",
  "<p>I suspect another cunning plot from our government. Jeremy Hunt calls for no abortions after 12 weeks on purpose, because he knows it's such a ghastly, bonkers idea that Maria Miller's and Nadine Dorries' desire for no abortions after 20 weeks, if you ignore science and what pregnant women want, sounds comparatively reasonable, and you might, in a panic, vote for these creatures.</p> <p>That is if you want more unwanted children around. I would have thought we have enough already. There are loads of them starving away, neglected, orphaned, wandering around the streets and rubbish tips of the world. Why can't Hunt, with his Christian values, concern himself with these unfortunates? I know many of them live abroad, and charity begins at home, but I thought the world was now meant to be a global village.</p> <p>Anyway, we've already got people starving here, queuing up for free food. A baby starved to death last week in Westminster. His mother was sick and destitute. Women for Refugee Women could probably find you some more examples, and who knows, with a few more years of benefits cuts, we'll probably have hungry, grubby children scrabbling over landfill sites and dumps to survive, just as they do in other less fortunate countries.</p> <p>This Thursday, the charity <a href=\"http://www.smallstepsproject.org/\" title=\"\">Small Steps Project</a> will be auctioning swanky celebrity shoes to raise money for children living on filthy, stinking distant dumps who have no shoes at all. Or enough food, clothing, shelter or schooling. All right, I own up. It's my daughter's charity, but once you realise how many children everywhere need help, it seems more sensible to concentrate our efforts on the ones we've got already, rather than the ones who are barely here.</p> <p>But Hunt is unlikely to do that. He's just another man from the dark ages, obsessed with a silly idea, who doesn't know what he's talking about, but is still telling women what to do. In a sane world, we could ignore him, but we can't, because he's in charge. Of health. Heaven help us all. I like to have a laugh, but I can't.</p>",

Ireland no longer has any university in the top 100 universities globally; Scotland still has one, Edinburgh, in the top 100 (and rising), but other Scottish institutions have fallen, in some cases significantly.</p> <p>\"Outside the golden triangle of London, Oxford and Cambridge, England's world-class universities face a collapse into global mediocrity, while investment in top research universities in Asia is starting to pay off,\" rankings editor Phil Baty<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/2012/oct/03/british-universities-set-collapse-mediocrity\" title=\"\"> told the Guardian</a>.</p> <p>While there is some drift, the prediction of a British collapse into mediocrity may be a bit premature. It is absolutely right that some of the emerging countries have made major investments in higher education, as one would expect. But this has not produced any instant challenge for global leadership. This latest top 20 contains only one university not in the US or UK, and it is in Switzerland.</p> <p>Furthermore, the success of universities in China, Singapore, Korea and Japan (and only a very small number of the thousands of Asian universities make it into any <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/higher-education-network/table/2012/sep/11/top-200-qs-world-university-rankings-2012\" title=\"\">university rankings</a>) is largely based on these institutions 'westernising' their educational and research methods and pouring in money. That hasn't just started last year \u2013 it has been a phenomenon of the past decade, and while the results are certainly there, they are not startling.</p> <p>It is obvious enough that as some countries make a transition into a more developed economic state, their universities will benefit from more investment and higher levels of ambition. But actually, it is rather remarkable that this has not had a much greater impact on the rankings.</p> <p>This is not to say that there aren't issues here to be addressed. The uncertainty about university funding in these islands has certainly had an impact, but so have other factors, including <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/2012/oct/05/student-visa-row-image-overseas-lse\" title=\"\">the inconsistencies and peculiarities of migration policies</a> as they affect student movement, and the trend for major companies to seek university links away from the more traditional set.</p> <p>What may be much more interesting, however, is this: a hint in the rankings that the university of the future is no longer necessarily the ancient, classical, blue-skies-research institution. The new leader, depending on rankings consulted either the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/2012/sep/11/mit-cambridge-harvard-top-university\" title=\"\">Massachusetts Institute of Technology</a> or California Institute of Technology, may be a more focused, networked and translational university. Other institutions that also reflect this profile have climbed up the rankings. As we try to work out what the role of higher education is to be in the future, this may be the more interesting trend.</p> <p><em>For the QS Top 200 World University Rankings, analysis and subject breakdown, </em><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/higher-education-network/world-university-rankings\" title=\"\"><em>visit our rankings site</em></a></p> <p><em>Ferdinand von Prondzynski is vice-chancellor of </em><a href=\"http://www.rgu.ac.uk/\" title=\"\"><em>Robert Gordon University</em></a><em> in Aberdeen.

  "<p>Never has there been a more egalitarian item in our wardrobes than the trainer. Worn by everyone from infant school pupils in PE classes to elite athletes on the Olympic rostrum, from rock'n'roll legends to royalty, from supermodels to supermarket workers, the sneaker \u2013 as it is known in America \u2013 is the shoe that keeps everyone's feet on the ground.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397347479\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/8/1349688978146/Rapper-Snoop-Dogg-wears-A-001.jpg\" alt=\"Rapper Snoop Dogg wears Adidas Superstars trainers\" width=\"220\" height=\"413\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rapper Snoop Dogg wears Adidas Superstars. Photograph: Buzz Foto/Rex Features</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Buzz Foto/Rex Features</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The trainer, in all its guises, is so ubiquitous that an exhibition dedicated to exploring its place in society opens next week in London. Sneaking into Fashion \u2013 Tracking the Trainer's Journey through Popular Culture examines how the functional sports shoe became not just the everyday wear for the most sedentary of couch potatoes, but aspirational attire for the image-conscious elite.</p> <p>\"The unique collection I've chosen for this exhibition tells the story of the development of trainers from simple generic plimsoll to fashion staple; a cornerstone of popular culture, sport and style,\" says Tory Turk, the 28-year-old curator, who personally favours Nike Air Max in sorbet shades.</p> <p>The 40 exhibits include Mo Farah's Nike Volts, worn at London 2012, and the yellow Asics Onitsuka Tiger Mexico style worn by Uma Thurman in the film <em>Kill Bill</em>. There's a pair of Liam Gallagher's Adidas plimsolls, which symbolised the terrace culture of football fashion and Britpop, plus a pair of Buffalo platform trainers worn by Mel B of the Spice Girls at the 1998 Brit awards.</p> <p>Today, even though we all have a pair, trainers have become a 21st-century status symbol, ranked according to their brand, style and rarity value. President Barack Obama has a bespoke pair of red, white and black Under Armour basketball shoes with the presidential seal emblazoned on the tongue, while Michelle Obama caused controversy when she handed out meals at a Washington DC food bank in Lanvin satin pumps that carried a $540 price tag.</p> <p>Elle Macpherson does the school run in neon pink Nikes, while the Duchess of Cambridge showed her support for Team GB this summer in Adidas Supernova Glide 4 Running Trainers in red and metallic silver. Kanye West designs his own limited-edition Air Yeezy 2 range for Nike (a pair of which sold on eBay this year for more than $90,000), while the late Steve Jobs made workaday trainers his trademark.</p> <p>Though many are content with a cheap, anonymous pair from the supermarket, trainer connoisseurs seek out rare \"deadstock\" \u2013 unworn styles from the 1970s and 1980s \u2013 which are sartorially superior for those in on the secret.</p> <p>Daniel Savory, co-founder of fashion brand Trainerspotter, has been collecting deadstock Nikes for more than 20 years and has a passion for the heritage-rich brand. \"I grew up with Nike, and experienced the boom of American pop culture in the 1980s and early 1990s,\" he says. \"It was aspirational: even David Hasselhoff wore Nikes in <em>Knight Rider</em>. Nike was also developing state-of-the art technology, staying one step ahead, which gave it one-upmanship status over other brands.\"</p> <p>For many, the classic \u00a325-a-pop Green Flash Dunlops are perfectly functional (they have sold 25m pairs), while for others the \u00a3120 version, customised by Anya Hindmarch, is the only shoe to be seen in. Yohji Yamamoto, Jeremy Scott, Alexander McQueen, Hussein Chalayan, Liberty of London and Comme des Gar\u00e7ons have also collaborated with brands to create limited-edition designs that are snapped up on pre-order and can fetch a fortune on eBay.</p> <p>\"Trainers have always been popular in different sectors of society, such as the street scene or the music industry,\" says Turk. \"But they are having a 'high fashion' moment now, in particular with wedge trainers. They aren't particularly new \u2013 Vivienne Westwood put a version on the catwalk back in 1983, for example \u2013 but they've reached a critical mass this time around.\"</p> <p>Designer Isabel Marant was a catalyst in the latest incarnation of the wedge trainer with her \u00a3400 Bekket and Willow styles, each featuring a hidden heel, paraded by Beyonc\u00e9 and Miranda Kerr. But it is an Italian brand, ASH Footwear, which brought its take on the Sport Luxe trend to the high street, with the likes of Victoria Beckham and Lindsay Lohan all adopting its suede Bowie style, with hordes following suit.</p> <p>\"We would normally order about 15,000 pairs, but for summer 2012 we added an additional 30,000 to meet demand,\" says Claire O'Connor, head of sales at ASH. \"This is definitely more than a passing fad: the metallic trims are more of a seasonal look, but the Bowie has appealed to lots of age groups and women who might not normally wear trainers. We've included lots of versions for spring 2013, and the Bowie will almost certainly become a staple in our collection now.\"</p> <p>While wedged trainers have become a widespread hit, in-the-know fashion editors are sporting the Nike Flyknit, a high-performance, super-light (160g) running shoe with an upper crafted from a single piece of \"techno-fabric\" knitted from recycled polyester/PET bottles.

  "<p>American companies and its government should avoid doing business with China's two leading technology firms, Huawei and ZTE, because they pose a national security threat to the US, the House of Representatives' intelligence committee will warn in a report to be published on Monday.</p> <p>The Republican-controlled panel also says US regulators should block mergers and acquisitions in the US by the two companies, which are among the world's leading suppliers of telecommunications gear and mobile phones.</p> <p>The panel's report will cause transatlantic friction over the role of the Chinese companies. In the UK, Huawei is a major supplier to the telecoms provider BT, and has supplied infrastructure being used in the new 4G superfast mobile network built by Everything Everywhere \u2013 the merged Orange/T-Mobile. Huawei provides access to its source code for GCHQ specialists who have reportedly examined it for threats and passed it as safe for use.</p> <p>Huawei is a private company founded by a former Chinese military engineer, and has grown rapidly to become the world's second largest supplier, behind Sweden's Ericsson, of telecommunications network gear, with operations in more than 140 countries. ZTE is the world's fourth largest mobile phone manufacturer, with 90,000 employees worldwide, and fifth-largest maker of telecoms equipment.</p> <p>While both companies' sales of mobile devices such as smartphones have grown in the US, espionage fears have proscribed any move into network infrastructure sales.</p> <p>ZTE has also enjoyed growth in its sale of mobile devices, although in recent months it has faced allegations about banned sales of US-sanctioned computer equipment to Iran. The FBI is probing reports that the company obstructed a US Commerce Department investigation into the sales.</p> <p>The intelligence panel says ZTE refused to provide any documents on its activities in Iran, but did provide a list of 19 individuals who serve on the Chinese communist party committee within the company. ZTE's citing of China's state secrecy laws for limiting information it could release only added to concern over Chinese government influence over its operations, the report says.</p> <p>Reflecting growing US governmental and commercial concern over cyber-attacks traced to China, the report also recommends that US government computer systems not include any components from the two firms because that could pose an espionage risk.</p> <p>\"China has the means, opportunity, and motive to use telecommunications companies for malicious purposes,\" the report says. It also raises the diplomatic temperature by warning that \"Huawei and ZTE have failed to assuage the committee's significant security concerns presented by their continued expansion into the US \u2026 In fact, given their obstructionist behaviour, the committee believes addressing these concerns have become an imperative for the country.\"</p> <p>But Huawei's US vice-president for external affairs, William Plummer, hit back: \"Baseless suggestions otherwise or purporting that Huawei is somehow uniquely vulnerable to cyber mischief ignore technical and commercial realities, recklessly threaten American jobs and innovation, do nothing to protect national security, and should be exposed as dangerous political distractions from legitimate public-private initiatives to address what are global and industry-wide cyber challenges,\" he said. Huawei is a \"globally trusted and respected company,\" he said, insisting that it had cooperated with investigators.</p> <p>ZTE said it \"profoundly disagrees\" with the committee's claims: \"ZTE should not be a focus of this investigation to the exclusion of the much larger western vendors,\" it commented in an open letter.</p> <p>The recommendations are the result of a year-long probe, including a congressional hearing last month in which senior Chinese executives of both companies testified, and denied posing a security threat. The most recent hearing, in September, was titled <a href=\"http://intelligence.house.gov/press-release/hpsci-hold-open-hearing-national-security-threats-posed-huawei-and-zte\" title=\"\">\"Open hearing on national security threats posted by Huawei and ZTE\"</a>.</p> <p>The bipartisan report is likely to become fodder for a presidential campaign in which the candidates have been competing over their readiness to clamp down on Chinese trade violations. The Republican candidate Mitt Romney, in particular, has made it a key point to get tougher on China by designating it a currency manipulator and fighting abuses such as intellectual property theft.</p> <p>The committee made the draft available to reporters and wire services in advance of public release on Monday, but only under the condition that they not publish stories until the broadcast Sunday of a CBS 60 Minutes report on Huawei. In the CBS report, the committee's chairman, Republican Rep Mike Rogers, urged American companies not to do business with Huawei.</p> <p>\"Find another vendor [than Huawei] if you care about your intellectual property; if you care about your consumers' privacy and you care about the national security of the United States of America,\" Rogers said in comments broadcast on the programme.</p> <p>The panel's recommendations are likely hamper Huawei and ZTE's ambitions to expand their business in the US. Their products are used in scores of countries, including in the west. Both deny being influenced by China's communist government.</p> <p>\"The investigation concludes that the risks associated with Huawei's and ZTE's provision of equipment to US critical infrastructure could undermine core US national-security interests,\" the report says.</p> <p>The report says the committee received information from industry experts and current and former Huawei employees suggesting that Huawei, in particular, may be violating US laws. It says that the committee will refer the allegations to the US government for further review and possible investigation. The report mentions allegations of immigration violations, bribery and corruption, and of a \"pattern and practice\" of Huawei using pirated software in its US facilities.</p> <p>An unclassified version of the report will be released at 15:00 BST, though a classified annex with \"significantly more information adding to the committee's concerns\" will remain redacted.</p> <p>Similar concerns have led <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/mar/29/huawei-ban-cyber-cold-war\" title=\"\">the Australian government to ban Huawei</a> from bidding as a supplier to the A$38bn National Broadband Network (NBN). And in November 2011, the US online security company Symantec dissolved a joint venture in which it was the 49% minority partner with Huawei because it feared being shut out of US government business.</p> <p>However, \"Huawei has not and will not jeopardize our global commercial success nor the integrity of our customers' networks for any third party, government or otherwise,\" senior vice-president Charles Ding testified to the committee in September, suggesting it would be corporate suicide to do so.</p> <p>The report says the companies failed to provide responsive answers about their relationships and support by the Chinese government, and detailed information about their operations in the US. Huawei, in particular, is criticised for failing to provide thorough information, including on its corporate structure, history, financial arrangements and management.</p> <p>\"The committee finds that the companies failed to provide evidence that would satisfy any fair and full investigation. Although this alone does not prove wrongdoing, it factors into the committee's conclusions,\" it says.</p> <p>In Washington, Huawei executive Plummer said on Friday that the company co-operated in good faith with the investigation, which he said had not been objective and amounted to a \"political distraction\" from cybersecurity problems facing the entire industry.</p> <p>All major telecommunications firms, including those in the west, develop and manufacture equipment in China and overlapping supply chains require industry-wide solutions, he added. Singling out China-based firms wouldn't help.</p> <p>Plummer complained that the volume of information sought by the committee was unreasonable, and it had demanded some proprietary business information that \"no responsible company\" would provide.</p> <p>In justifying its scrutiny of the Chinese companies, the committee contended that Chinese intelligence services, as well as private companies and other entities, often recruit those with direct access to corporate networks to steal trade secrets and other sensitive proprietary data.</p> <p>It warned that malicious hardware or software implants in Chinese-manufactured telecommunications components and systems headed for US customers could allow Beijing to shut down or degrade critical national security systems in a time of crisis or war.</p> <p>The committee concluded that Huawei likely has substantially benefited from the support of the Chinese government.</p> <p>Huawei denies being financed to undertake research and development for the Chinese military, but the committee says it has received internal Huawei documentation from former employees showing the company provides special network services to an entity alleged to be an elite cyberwarfare unit within the People's Liberation Army.</p> <p>The intelligence committee recommended that the government's Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, or CFIUS, bar mergers and acquisitions by both Huawei and ZTE. CFIUS is a multi-agency regulatory panel chaired by treasury secretary Timothy Geithner, and screens foreign investment proposals for potential national security threats.</p> <p>Last year, Huawei had to unwind its purchase of a US computer company, 3Leaf Systems, after it failed to win CFIUS approval. However, Huawei employs 1,700 people in the US, and business is expanding. US revenues rose to $1.3bn in 2011, up from $765m in 2010.</p>",
  "<p>Something odd has happened to Android. </p> <p>While its growth rate continues to grow (yes, a second-order change; sales are accelerating), we aren't seeing the changing of the guard from the older version to the newer one that we have over the past two years - such as the end of 2010, when \"Froyo\" (version 2.2) replaced \"Eclair\" (version 2.1) and then the end of 2011 when Froyo was replaced by \"Gingerbread\" (version 2.3).</p> <p>Going by the statistics shown on <a href=\"http://developer.android.com/about/dashboards/index.html\">Google's platform versions</a> page (which shows the version of Android being used by devices connecting to Google Play in the two weeks up to 1 October, and is revised monthly), Gingerbread has been the most-used version of Android since November 2011. At that point it was running on 42% of devices connecting to Google Play (then the Android Market), just passing the 40.9% using Froyo.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397380741\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Technology/Pix/pictures/2012/10/7/1349642090318/android-market-oct-460.png\" alt=\"Android market by version to Oct 2010\" width=\"460\" height=\"320\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Versions of Android accessing Google Play to October 2012. Click for larger version. Source: Google, Wayback Machine</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: guardian.co.uk</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As I forecast around the end of last year, this has been <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2011/dec/29/android-versions-2011-froyo-gingerbread\">the year of Gingerbread</a>: it has been by far the leading version, peaking in June at 65% of devices. And now, as has happened in the past, its share is starting to fall, as the next version, \"Ice Cream Sandwich\" (4.0, hereafter ICS) starts to appear on newer devices, and older ones get updated via carriers.</p> <h2>Can't catch the Gingerbread, man</h2> <p>Except the difference now is that Gingerbread isn't dropping off as fast as predecessors. Go back a year: at the start of October 2011, Froyo was down to a 45.9% share (from a high of 65.9% in May 2011) and Gingerbread had risen to 36%, and was adding about 6 percentage points every month. Similarly, by October 2010 Eclair was at 40.4% (down from a high of 59.7% in August) and Froyo was at 33.4%, and adding 4 to 5 percentage points per month.</p> <p>Now look at today: Gingerbread is falling, down from that 65% in June to 55.8% at the start of October - but ICS is at just 23.7%, and has risen by only a couple of percentage points. True, if you add in \"Jelly Bean\" (4.1) then you bump up the 4.x figure to 25.5% . But that's still a long way adrift.</p> <p>What that adds up to is that unless something changes quite dramatically in the next couple of months, Gingerbread will remain the dominant Android version for quite a while. It's only losing a couple of percentage points per month, while ICS/Jelly Bean gain about the same. With a 30% gap between the old and the new variants, it could take another year before things changed.</p> <h2>Drawing breath</h2> <p>At this stage, we need to make a few points. First, looking at the numbers in this way masks the enormous growth in the total number of devices actually accessing Google Play. The latest figure given by Eric Schmidt, at the start of September, was 480m Android devices. That compares to 190m announced in Google's Q3 earnings on 13 October 2011. So in less than a year, the number of devices (almost all handsets) has more than doubled.</p> <p>In turn, that means - <em>if</em> we accept that the number of devices accessing Google Play is proportionate to the ratio of devices in the wild (though there's no way to know that; only Google really knows) - that:<br>\u2022 in October 2011 there were 68.4m devices running Gingerbread<br>\u2022 in October 2012 there were 268m devices running Gingerbread, and 122.4m running 4.x.</p> <p>In other words, there are more devices running 4.x now than there were running Gingerbread a year ago. So even while it might appear that 4.x (ICS and Jelly Bean) hasn't made much progress, it has - but that's obscured by the huge growth of Android.</p> <p>A couple of things to note from those numbers:<br>\u2022 ICS/Jelly Bean went <strong>from nowhere to 122.4m in a year</strong></p> <p>\u2022 Gingerbread <strong>grew by 200m devices in the same period</strong>, to that 268m figure. It looks like many manufacturers are still using it because it's a known quantity.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397380742\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Technology/Pix/pictures/2012/10/7/1349642255365/android-by-version-460.png\" alt=\"Number of devices running Google to Oct 2012\" width=\"460\" height=\"406\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Estimated number of devices running different versions of Android to Oct 2012.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: guardian.co.uk</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><br>So now there are nearly 360m devices out there which are running versions of Android <em>before</em> 4.x. It's unlikely that a significant number of them will be upgraded; yes, some might here and there, but it's not actually in manufacturers' interests to provide an endless upgrade path for Android phones, because if you keep using a phone, they can't sell you a new one. (Apple offers long upgrade paths because it sells services on older handsets such as music and apps, and those keep people tied into its ecosystem. Android handset makers don't have the same breadth of services; most of what comes on Android is via Google, rather than say Samsung or HTC specifically. It's noticeable that Samsung is making significant efforts to move into services through extras such as <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S_Voice\">S-Voice</a>.)</p> <h2>What does it all mean?</h2> <p>Gingerbread isn't going away. About 200m of those handsets are one year or less old, so they're going to continue for at least another year - possibly two or three.</p> <p>ICS/Jelly Bean is growing fast in absolute numbers, but even if a million a day <em>solely</em> running ICS/Jelly Bean are added, then it will take about 100 more days before 4.x overtakes 2.3. That's some time in January. However, it's unlikely that's going to happen - because the numbers suggest that Gingerbread devices are being added even more quickly than ICS/Jelly Bean ones. </p> <p>Again, though, what does that mean? If Gingerbread persists, does anyone lose out?</p> <p>According to Google, the <a href=\"http://developer.android.com/about/versions/android-4.0-highlights.html#DeveloperApis\">benefits of 4.x for developers</a> include a \"social API\" which can \"store standard contact data as well as new types of content for any given contact, including large profile photos, stream items, and recent activity feedback\", and a \"calendar API\" that makes it easier to add calendar services to apps, a visual voicemail API, Android Beam (for NFC-powered data transfer), \"low-level streaming multimedia\" (for DRM-based media), and a whole slew more. </p> <p>If you're not using Android 4.x, those aren't available to you, and they're not available in any apps you might get. Of course, it doesn't matter to the handset makers, who have got paid by the carriers; doesn't matter to the carriers, which have sold a phone; doesn't much matter to Google, which has another customer. So who does it matter to? </p> <p>Only, perhaps, to app developers which can't offer higher-grade apps (and so can't get people to spend more on those new apps); to some of the media companies which can't take advantage of DRM-enabled streams.; and of course to users who might have heard about the benefits of ICS/Jelly Bean, but can't get them because their handset isn't being upgraded.</p> <p>The number of devices that get updated, relative to the total number out there, is likely to be minimal. The reason that Gingerbread isn't falling away faster is because handsets are still being shipped with it on (though there's no way of telling, it's possible that many of those are in China, where Android ran on 80% of the handsets shipped there in the second quarter). </p> <h2>An update on the Update Alliance</h2> <p>For those who want an upgrade from Gingerbread to ICS or Jelly Bean, the situation is much the same as it ever was: it might happen, or it might not. The Android Update Alliance, <a href=\"http://androidandme.com/2011/05/news/google-partners-with-manufacturers-and-carriers-to-speed-up-android-updates/\">announced at Google I/O in May 2011</a> with carriers including AT&amp;T, T-Mobile, Vodafone, Sprint, and Verizon, and handset makers HTC, LG, Samsung, Sony Ericsson, and Motorola, was dead within months. Its promise that \"any new Android phone would receive timely OS updates for at least 18 months following launch\": when <a href=\"http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2397729,00.asp\">PC Mag followed up in December 2011</a> it was almost entirely ignored, and by June this year <a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2012/06/what-happened-to-the-android-update-alliance/\">Ars Technica found no mention at all</a>. </p> <p>But in many ways that's not surprising. The <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2012/aug/10/samsung-apple-tablet-phone-sales-revealed\">figures for US sales of Samsung phones</a> (released in the Samsung-Apple patent trial in July/August) showed that phones had a brief life cycle: they'd appear, sell well for a few months, and vanish, to be replaced by another model.</p> <p>For the handset maker and carrier, the hassle of writing and checking OS updates for a phone that might not even be on sale any more (or if it is has already been overshadowed) isn't outweighed by any other benefits. It doesn't bring any extra sales (indeed, it might slow up sales of new handsets with whizzy new features, because you'd get those features on the new OS). </p> <p>Updating certainly brings extra support calls - and you can guarantee that the number of support calls that follow a new Android OS update will far exceed the number of support calls <em>before</em> an update asking where it is. Possibly that's part of the reason why Motorola has reneged on its promise to update a number of handsets, <a href=\"http://news.cnet.com/8301-1035_3-57526994-94/android-users-outraged-over-motorolas-broken-promise/\">to the annoyance of users</a>.</p> <p>If updating won't bring the handset maker or the carrier any extra money (and might even cost both), you can see why they'd be reluctant to do it. Only the pressure of seeing rivals doing so will impel them to do that - which is where Google, with its Nexus line, needs to be leading the charge. If it can push out updates, that might drive more updates. But don't hold your breath, because (as the Samsung trial figures showed) Nexus devices don't sell in huge numbers; you have to look to Samsung for that. </p> <p>So that's the thing about Android. It's getting so big that the inertia of its existing installed base ihas just begun to act as brake on the arrival of new OS-based features in the broader market. While Google wants to push its new products - Google Currents, Google Now - which require the new APIs, and while those might be attractive for users, the interests of the handset makers and carriers's aren't necessarily aligned with them. And this isn't going to change any time soon.</p>",

Rest in Alvar Aalto's Finlandia Hall cafe (<a href=\"http://www.finlandiaravintola.fi/en/cafe-veranda\" title=\"\">finlandiaravintola.fi</a>) or spend a quiet moment in the Kamppi Chapel of Silence. For older architecture, the The <a href=\"http://www.nba.fi/en/museums/seurasaari_openairmuseum\" title=\"\">Seurasaari open-air museum</a> is the perfect place to enjoy the autumn colours. For evening entertainment, take advantage of the Finnish National Opera's low prices (as little as \u20ac14, <a href=\"http://www.opera.fi/en\" title=\"\">opera.fi</a>) and enjoy The Magic Flute, Don Carlos or Tosca. <br><strong>hattivatti</strong></p> <h2>Edinburgh</h2> <p>Walking hand in hand down the old cobbled ginnels (alleyways) of the old town or sipping cocktails on any number of rooftop terraces like that of Harvey Nichols, the place is full of romantic possibilities. There is plenty of culture, from the newly refurbished Scottish National Museum and Scottish National Portrait Gallery to theatres and concerts, not to mention fine dining from the likes of Tom Kitchin and Mark Greenaway. And Edinburgh must be unique in that in the middle of the city there is not only a castle sitting on a volcanic plug but a little patch of the Highlands in the shape of Arthur's Seat and Salisbury Crags. <br><strong>kickw</strong></p> <h2>Glasgow</h2> <p>There's a stunning range of colours in Kelvingrove Park, Maxwell Park, Queen's Park and Pollok Country Park (<a href=\"http://www.glasgow.gov.uk/en/Residents/Parks_Outdoors/Parks_gardens/\" title=\"\">glasgow.gov.uk</a>). Spend some time at the Glasgow University cloisters, <a href=\"http://www.glasgowlife.org.uk/museums/our-museums/kelvingrove/whats-on/exhibitions/Pages/home.aspx\" title=\"\">Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum</a> or, to the south of the city, the <a href=\"http://www.glasgowlife.org.uk/museums/our-museums/burrell-collection/Pages/home.aspx\" title=\"\">Burrell Collection</a>. When it gets darker and chillier find a table at cosy Kember &amp; Jones on Byres Road (<a href=\"http://www.kemberandjones.co.uk/\" title=\"\">kemberandjones.co.uk</a>) for coffee and cakes to die for.<br><strong>danapt</strong></p> <h2>Budapest</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397233817\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Late_offers/pictures/2012/10/4/1349351955820/View-over-Parliament-and--001.jpg\" alt=\"View over Parliament and Danube, Budapest   \" width=\"460\" height=\"277\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">View over Parliament and the Danube, Budapest   Photograph: Linda Nylind for the Guardian</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Linda Nylind/Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Escape the busy streets and walk in the woods of Gell\u00e9rt-hegy, or Gell\u00e9rt Hill. It is easy to get to and gives the most amazing panoramic view of Budapest. There are benches and conkers, and it just feels and smells of autumn. Then walk back to Pest and have a nice meal or a cuppa in V\u00e1ci utca or R\u00e1day utca, two of the city's best restaurant streets.<br><strong>greatplaingirl</strong></p> <h2>Stockholm</h2> <p>The best thing to do when it's nippy is go for a long walk to get a flush in your cheeks, then curl up in a cosy cafe and drink coffee. With its many islands, quiet cobbled streets and hipster hangouts of Sodermalm, Stockholm is made for walking. My favourite cafe is Gildas Rum (Sk\u00e5negatan 79) \u2013 eccentric design, great cakes and overlooking a little city park.<br><a href=\"http://www.visitstockholm.com\" title=\"\"><em>visitstockholm.com</em></a><br><strong>gingersnap</strong></p> <h2>San Francisco</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397233818\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Late_offers/pictures/2012/10/4/1349352215203/San-Francisco-skeleton-pu-001.jpg\" alt=\"San Francisco skeleton puppet\" width=\"460\" height=\"277\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Skeleton puppet at the day of the dead parade in San Francisco.

Garfield Park is filled with altars made by the community; there's a walking procession, music, dancing and a lot of dressing up. Grab some amazing vegan Mexican food at Gracias Madre (<a href=\"http://www.gracias-madre.com/\" title=\"\">gracias-madre.com</a>) on Mission Street. San Francisco is great in autumn \u2013 mainly because it's no different to summer. The fog still rolls in, you still need a jumper, but there are fewer tourists, the colours are beautiful and the sun just seems softer.<br><a href=\"http://www.sanfrancisco.travel/neighborhood/mission-district/\" title=\"\"><em>sanfrancisco.travel</em></a><em>, </em><a href=\"http://www.dayofthedeadsf.org/\" title=\"\"><em>dayofthedeadsf.org</em></a><br><strong>thelmalives</strong></p> <h2>Kyoto</h2> <p>Kyoto is beautiful in October, when palace and temple gardens are ablaze with autumnal colours. It is also when the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jidai_Matsuri\" title=\"\">Jidai Matsuri</a> (Festival of the Ages) takes place \u2013 a feast of incredible colour and elegance, involving 2,000 participants wearing costumes from the Heian to the Meiji periods. The procession starts at noon, heading from the imperial palace to the Heian shrine, but don't wait until then. Go to the palace early in the morning when it's quiet and watch the performers getting ready. The samurai are happy to chat and pose, and you can snap close-ups of ladies in beautiful kimonos.<br><a href=\"http://handsonkyoto.com/jidai-matsuri/\" title=\"\"><em>handsonkyoto.com/jidai-matsuri</em></a><br><strong>troutiemcfish</strong></p> <h2>Poitiers, western France</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397233819\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Late_offers/pictures/2012/10/4/1349352435295/Poitiers-FUTUROSCOPE-001.jpg\" alt=\"Poitiers FUTUROSCOPE\" width=\"460\" height=\"277\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Futuroscope theme park near Poitiers, France.

So if the weather is not so hot, you can shop, visit the cathedral, bars and restaurants without getting splashed by passing traffic. If you are there for more than a day or two also take time to visit Futuroscope (<a href=\"http://en.futuroscope.com/\" title=\"\">en.futuroscope.com</a>). It's better than Disney and suitable for all ages \u2013 we've taken our seven year-old daughter and my 80 year-old mum and we all had a great time.<br><strong>PLeslie</strong></p> <h2>Tallinn</h2> <p>Tallin's beautiful buildings silhouetted against the autumn skies take your breath away when looking westwards from the numerous vantage points along the old city walls. Towers, domes and turrets glow with the colour of the sunset skies. Eat outside around the old square, under heaters and wrapped in the fleeces and sheepskins provided, and watch the magic of the old town light up, while eating a hearty stew. Then stroll around the ancient streets and alleyways to cosy basement bars, fires blazing.<br><a href=\"http://www.tourism.tallinn.ee/eng\" title=\"\"><em>tourism.tallinn.ee/eng</em></a><br><strong>pmartini</strong></p> <h2>Delhi</h2> <p>In autumn, the weather in Delhi is perfect: the monsoon rains have passed and the temperature is in the high 20s. There are some lively festivals at this time of year, including Navaratri (16-23 October), with 10 days of street festivals, dancing, plays and finally the burning of giant effigies of the god Ravana. The largest autumn celebration is Diwali (13-17 November this year.) To celebrate the Hindu new year and the triumph of good over evil, the city is filled with glittering lights \u2013 tiny clay lamps flicker from every window \u2013 and fireworks fill the skies. Delicious sweets such as the milky <em>burfi</em> are sold on street corners and the roads are strewn with marigold and rose petals or colourful patterns made from coloured sand or chalk. Indian families prefer to stay with relatives during this special period, so hotels offer discounts. Shops have sale bonanzas of up to 40%.Last Diwali we were practically the only guests at the Radisson Blu hotel (+91 114 639 9999, <a href=\"http://www.radissonblu.com/hotel-newdelhipaschimvihar\" title=\"\">radissonblu.com/hotel-newdelhipaschimvihar</a>, doubles from \u00a370)<em> </em>in the Paschim Vihar district, so we were thoroughly spoiled with cakes, fruit and sweets.<br><a href=\"http://www.delhitourism.gov.in/delhitourism/index.jsp\" title=\"\"><em>delhitourism.gov.in</em></a><br><strong>bowbankGuard</strong></p>",
  "<p>David Cameron's attempt to reach out to the \"strivers\" in society, with a series of measures to be unveiled at the Conservative conference this week, received a cautious welcome in the party on Sunday.</p> <p>The prime minister is reported to be planning to use his conference speech on Wednesday to appeal to people who \"work hard and want to get on\", regardless of their social background, he told the Sunday Times.</p> <p>Cameron's choice of language has echoes of previous politicians from across the political spectrum. Last year the Labour leader, Ed Miliband, used his speech to stand up for society's \"grafters\".</p> <p>But while \"strivers\" became an instant buzzword around the party conference in Birmingham, Cameron's aides said the word itself might not be used in his speech, though they insisted \"it's not one we'll run away from\".</p> <p>The change of tone, away from an emphasis on the \"squeezed middle\", was reflected in the first two policies briefed for the conference start: a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2012/oct/07/rail-fares-capped-lower-david-cameron\" title=\"\">cap on regulated rail fares for commuters</a>, and a freeze on next year's council tax bills.</p> <p>They were the first sign of what appears to be part of the Conservative response to Miliband's audacious move into Tory territory last week, when he <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/oct/02/ed-miliband-one-nation-speech1?CMP=twt_gu\" title=\"\">rebranded his party as One Nation Labour</a>.</p> <p>The potential weaknesses of Cameron's argument were highlighted by Labour's immediate response, mocking any attempt by him to shed the party's \"posh boy\" image, which polls increasingly identify as a key bar to more popularity.</p> <p>\"[David Cameron] says one thing, but time and again does another,\" said Michael Dugher, Labour's shadow minister for the Cabinet Office. \"He says those at the top will need to pay more but he is the man whose top priority is to cut taxes for millionaires, giving 8,000 people earning over \u00a31m a tax break of \u00a340,000 this April.\"</p> <p>Pressure for the shift from within the party, however, was reaffirmed on Sunday by a YouGov poll for the news and opinion website ConservativeHome.</p> <p>The poll found that only 1-8% of people did not vote Tory because of issues such as its strong views on crime and immigration, or because of attitudes to women and minority groups. However, 28% of those polled agreed that Conservatives did not \"care enough about the very poor and vulnerable\", and 28% said Tories did not \"care enough about the NHS and other public services\".</p> <p>The main problem, said 41%, was that the Tories were \"the party of the rich\".</p> <p>Boris Johnson, in an article in the Daily Telegraph, called for more help for the \"struggling middle\" \u2013 working families with incomes ranging from \u00a330,000 to \u00a364,000 \u2013 particularly regarding issues like housing. \"They are not being helped,\" he wrote. \"They are feeling utterly and understandably ignored. It is time to help them.\"</p> <p>ConservativeHome's founder and editor, Tim Montgomerie, has set up an internal campaign group under the banner \"strong and compassionate\", arguing that to win its first majority for 20 years the party had to have \"a radical overhaul of \u2026 message, manifesto and machine\".</p> <p>Based on its polling, the party should be on the side of aspiration or \"strivers\", said Montgomerie, but it must not be to the exclusion of those who cannot strive, in the economic sense at least.</p> <p>\"Once we have got a more focused welfare state we should be proud of looking after people who can't look after themselves,\" added Montgomerie.</p> <p>The shift was welcomed by Mark Reckless, an MP who is not afraid to criticise the government. He said that the idea of strivers was an improvement on the \"infinitely elastic term, squeezed middle\".</p> <p>However, Reckless acknowledged that the new approach would be judged by policies, not by the language. The cap on commuter fares to only 1% over inflation was particularly useful for his constituency in Kent, said Reckless.</p>"
