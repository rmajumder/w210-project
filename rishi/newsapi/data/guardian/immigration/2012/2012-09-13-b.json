[
  "<p>There are traditions to be observed when a minister addresses the annual gathering of vice-chancellors at the Universities UK (UUK) conference. Firstly, they like to keep their audience onside by announcing new funding (universities minister David Willetts did that today with <a href=\"http://www3.imperial.ac.uk/newsandeventspggrp/imperialcollege/newssummary/news_13-9-2012-12-23-38\" title=\"\">\u00a33.8 million for research into cybersecurity</a>). Next there will be a justification of the government's record on universities (there was much of this) before finally announcing some eye-catching <a href=\"http://www.bis.gov.uk/news/speeches/david-willetts-uuk-conference-2012\" title=\"\">new policy initiatives</a>. Perhaps, the most significant of these initiatives was the announcement that overseas student numbers would be disaggregated from net migration figures.</p> <p>The announcement is timely. Last week <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/blog/2012/aug/30/lmu-student-recruitment-teaching-learning\" title=\"\">London Metropolitan University</a> had its highly trusted status (its ability to recruit non-EU international students) revoked by the UK Border Agency. Some 2,700 London Met students were given 60 days from the receipt of 'curtailment letters' to either find another sponsor (i.e. university course) or face deportation. The financial impact on London Met, whose student population is made up of 15% international students, will be enormous and the university is seeking a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2012/sep/11/london-met-legal-challenge-visas\" title=\"\">judicial review</a> of the decision, now set for the 21st September.</p> <p>At present international students are included within the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/blog/2011/nov/03/immigration-policy\" title=\"\">net migration figures</a> that government wish to reduce to the 'tens of thousands'. This year applications for <a href=\"http://www.telegraphindia.com/1120521/jsp/nation/story_15512974.jsp#.UFIWp7_MGIY\" title=\"\">student visas have fallen by 30%</a>. The immigration minister responsible for the London Met decision, Damian Green, was reshuffled soon afterwards.</p> <p>So today Willetts announces that he wishes to publish disaggregated figures within migration statistics, which will identify \"students in the emigration flows\", so that \"the debate can be better informed\". On the face of it, Willetts announcement will do nothing to change the problems caused by the current policy. He is only promising to publish, through the Office of National Statistics, the sort of <a href=\"http://www.ippr.org/articles/56/9118/another-voice-how-ministers-are-gaming-the-net-migration-target\" title=\"\">analysis already available</a> through the Institute of Public Policy Research (IPPR).</p> <p>The issue is not that the debate is ill-informed by poor data. Instead, it is that the policy of including students in a radical reduction of migrants, and then asking universities to police it, is plain wrong. And this is just the first discrepancy. Mr Willetts went on to say something very interesting. He said: \"I want to make clear the attitude of the government. There is no limit on the number of legitimate students from overseas studying at British universities.\" This is not at all clear. On the one hand students are still part of net migration (to be reduced to the tens of thousands as previously stated) and on the other hand, \"there is no limit\" on the number of students UK universities can recruit. While there is a difference between immigration and emigration, these two statements, under the current visa culture, are fundamentally incompatible.</p> <p>There are two options here. Either, logic is not the minister's strong suit and what is on offer is an unseemly fudge of words to placate his audience at the University of Keele. Or, he is genuinely announcing a de facto change in policy in which there will be two sets of migration statistics: one that includes student visas and one which will be the actual target to be reduced. If that is the case then we have the extraordinary situation of a BIS minister announcing a change to a Home Office policy.</p> <p>Is this the first policy U-turn of the reshuffled cabinet: an '<a href=\"http://www.newstatesman.com/blogs/politics/2012/04/origin-omnishambles\" title=\"\">ominshambles</a>' 2.0? It's all in the semantics. To paraphrase the words of <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw9oX-kZ_9k\" title=\"\">Gary Coleman's character</a> in the 1970s sit-com Different Strokes: whatchoo talkin' bout Willetts? Can the minister please clarify his statement? Either way, the statement did not seem in any way to alter the onerous visa regulations (the famous 'red tape' of Tory nightmares) placed on universities, of which London Met fell foul, and has been criticised for varying reasons by the Public Accounts Committee, the BIS select committee, and the National Union of Students.</p> <p>The organisers of the conference at which Willetts spoke, UUK, did not themselves seem to think that the minister's statement indicated a genuine change in policy. In a <a href=\"http://blog.universitiesuk.ac.uk/2012/09/13/david-willetts-student-immigration/\" title=\"\">statement on their website</a> they say: \"We want the government to go further and remove students from government targets to reduce net migration\". Eric Thomas, vice-chancellor of the University of Bristol and president of UUK, was unusually forthright in his speech to conference stating that the <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2012/09/13/london-met-foreign-students-failed-uk-overseas-vias-eric-thomas_n_1880610.html\" title=\"\">UK had failed London Met's overseas students</a>, not only as students but as human beings and that the policy on international students invited ridicule upon the country.</p> <p>To appease a crowd worried about the fallout from the London Met debacle, Willetts also announced a \u00a32 million hardship fund for displaced \"legitimate\" London Met students, before adding that he and Thomas would \"jointly author an article to offer to key newspapers in our target markets explaining that overseas students are welcome here\". All of which is recognition of the enormous damage that these immigration policies are inflicting on the international reputation of British universities and their contribution to the UK economy. The question is, does any of it amount to a change in policy? The London Met judicial review will begin to test the meaning of David Willetts announcement.</p> <p><em>Martin McQuillan is dean of the faculty of arts and social sciences at Kingston University, London.

  "<p>No British government ever wishes to be seen as soft on immigration. That's particularly true of a government that is trailing consistently badly <a href=\"http://d25d2506sfb94s.cloudfront.net/cumulus_uploads/document/tkdi1n6ngn/YG-Archives-Pol-Sun-results-120912.pdf\" title=\"\">in the opinion polls</a> and whose reputation on immigration is one of <a href=\"http://d25d2506sfb94s.cloudfront.net/cumulus_uploads/document/yqhb16pj0b/YG-Archives-Pol-Trackers-Issues1-210812.pdf\" title=\"\">its few remaining strong suits with the voters</a> \u2013 both of which are true of David Cameron's government. This basic \u2013 and base \u2013 political calculation provides the background explanation for \u2013 even if it does not excuse \u2013 the coalition government's general determination to slash <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2011/jun/13/foreign-student-visa-numbers-cut\" title=\"\">student visa numbers</a> and its specific preference for a zero tolerance approach towards the 2,700 overseas students caught by last month's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/aug/31/foreign-students-editorial\" title=\"\">sudden ban on the teaching of non-EU foreign students by London Metropolitan University</a>. The callous treatment of those students is a disgrace both to the government and, more worryingly, to Britain's wider reputation as a world-class university destination.</p> <p>It is no secret that both the general issue of student visas and the specific one about LMU have caused major rows within the government. In both cases, the business department has been pitted against the Home Office, and in both cases, the Home Office has prevailed. On Thursday, however, the business department announced a more sensible and less fear-driven long-term approach to overseas student numbers. As a result, perhaps some good may come from last month's bad decision over LMU, though that may be little consolation to those caught up in the consequences.</p> <p>Both <a href=\"http://www.bis.gov.uk/news/speeches\" title=\"\">the business secretary Vince Cable and the universities minister David Willetts</a> have addressed this week's Universities UK conference at Keele University, and both have tried to strike a more positive note. Both have a difficult task. The international reputational damage caused by the LMU ban and its consequences for the universities are very bad. This has been particularly serious in both India and China, where the distinction between LMU and London University is not always understood. As a result, the impression that foreign students are unwelcome in London as a whole has been particularly damaging, just at the time when the Olympics have done so much to make the capital so attractive.</p> <p>The damage is not just reputational but financial. Foreign students pay average fees of about \u00a310,000 a year and spend at least that amount while they are here. They bring in almost \u00a38bn a year to the UK. A large cut in foreign student numbers would not just be damaging to the finances of Britain's universities. Almost all rely on a significant income from overseas fees. A cut would increase the financial pressure on home-grown students too, as the colleges struggled to offset their loss of overseas income. Be clear also that cutting foreign students makes this country more boring, more insular and more ignorant \u2014 as Mr Willetts himself said.</p> <p>This is a big public issue. Encouragingly, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-19579923\" title=\"\">Mr Willetts told the university heads something they wanted to hear</a>: that the government wants to \u2013 wants to, note, not will \u2013 publish disaggregated immigration statistics that make clear the difference between students entering and leaving the UK for legitimate educational reasons, and other categories of migrants. This may seem a dry proposal at first sight. But it could pave the way for a more informed debate and, better still, for a clearer differentiation that may safeguard universities and their legitimate students. Labour should back Mr Willetts on this.</p> <p>That foreign students should have proper visas, should attend proper courses in proper colleges, should speak decent English and obey the terms of their immigration status ought to be common ground. But so should the principle that Britain and its universities should be able to recruit students on merit. The LMU debacle has been a miserable episode and much remains to be done to help LMU's foreign students and protect the reputation of foreign student programmes here more generally. But there was some hope on Thursday that, having lost a battle, the business department may eventually win the war.</p>",
  "<p>Deep voter disillusionment with the Liberal Democrats' influence over a range of coalition policies is reflected in a new poll, which shows that on political reform, one of the party's central planks, half the electorate think Nick Clegg's party has made no difference at all.</p> <p>Even among Liberal Democrat supporters, 42% believe the party has made no difference in reforming the political system.</p> <p>The poll conducted by YouGov typically shows that over a range of issues no more than about 15% of voters think the Liberal Democrats are making a positive difference. Only 10% of Labour voters see them as a positive moderating influence on coalition policy.</p> <p>It appears that the Liberal Democrats are most strongly associated with cutting tax for the low paid. Nearly 23% think the party has made a positive difference in this area, 21% a negative difference and 43% no difference. On this and all the questions, a number of respondents replied \"don't know\".</p> <p>The findings underline the extent to which Clegg faces an uphill battle in the next two years to persuade the electorate that the party has truly shaped the direction of coalition policy.</p> <p>Labour voters' scepticism about Lib Dem influence on the coalition suggests Clegg may be right to think the best hope of boosting his share of the vote at the next election will come from Conservative voters. Such Tory voters are much more evenly balanced as to whether the Lib Dems are making a positive or negative difference, suggesting the party may be becoming a centre-right brand.</p> <p>The poll shows 49% of all voters think the Lib Dems are making no difference over environmental protection, and 21% believe it is making a negative difference. The same figures apply to Liberal Democrat influence over civil liberties.</p> <p>It appears that the party's advocacy of a pupil premium to help the poorest school children has also not impressed voters. A total of 48% of voters believe the Lib Dems have made no difference over investing in education of poorer children, while 22% think they have made a negative difference. Only 15% believe they have made a positive difference.</p> <p>The findings are bound to lead to further calls for the party to do more to differentiate itself from its coalition partners in the second half of the parliament.</p> <p>With their conference starting in Brighton next week, the Lib Dems are set to debate how and when the two parties should disengage ahead of the election.</p> <p>The poll has worrying findings for Labour, in that it is still not building a lead as the best party to oversee the economy. Despite a double-dip recession, and the collapse of many Treasury forecasts, 27% think the Conservatives are the best party on the economy and 26% say Labour. Labour has a 28%-24% lead on taxation.</p> <p>Labour remains behind the Conservatives on crime and immigration but it enjoys only a lead over the Conservatives on education and schools.</p> <p>\u2022 The research was prepared for the YouGov-Cambridge forum this week at which the Guardian is the media partner. The survey was carried out online between 9-10 September 2012. YouGov questioned 1871 GB adults. The figures have been weighted and are representative of all GB adults (aged 18+).</p>",
  "<p>In the spirit of full disclosure, we must begin this week with a&#xa0;confession. Lost in Showbiz would never pretend to be any kind of expert in what it fears we must term \"body art\". Tattoos and tattooing represent a foreign country to&#xa0;Lost in Showbiz, something that was brought home to it quite forcefully when it walked past a tattoo parlour in Brighton and noticed it was touting for business by displaying in its window what was presumably an example of its recent work: a large depiction of Harry Hill pulling a face, with which a customer had decorated his right buttock. The message seemed to be: if you're the kind of person who wants to spend the rest of their life walking around with a drawing of a primetime comedian pulling a face on your backside, we're very much your go-to guys. Not LiS's idea of a winning business pitch, but then they presumably know their market. For all LiS knows, it may be standing room only in there and a waiting list like <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/2012/may/06/jay-rayner-restaurant-review-dabbous\" title=\"\">dinner at Dabbous</a>. Customers might be trampling each other to death in the crush to get to the counter and ask: can you do Dom Joly poking out of the top of my pants?</p> <p>To compound matters, LiS would especially never pretend to have a grasp on the enigmatic subsection of body art pertaining to hip-hop and R&amp;B stars. Here is a world where the rapper Gucci Mane celebrated his release from a mental health facility <a href=\"http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/what-does-gucci-manes-ice-cream-cone-tattoo-mean-20110113\" title=\"\">by having his right cheek emblazoned with an enormous ice-cream cone</a> featuring two lightning bolts coming out of the top and the word \"brrrr\" across it, apparently confident that few things say \"I am a man in full possession of my mental faculties\" quite like having a big ice-cream cone with the word \"brrrr\" across it tattooed on your face. \"It's a reminder to his fans of how he chooses to live his life. Cool as ice. As in: 'I'm so icy I'll make you say \"brrrr\",'\" offered his spokesman in explanation.</p> <p>And finally, LiS would never presume to offer guidance to singer, rapper and the world's favourite domestic abuser Chris \"Breezy\" Brown, on the grounds that all evidences suggest he has something of a quick temper. But, in the admittedly unlikely event that LiS were called upon to offer advice to Brown on what he should have tattooed on his neck, it would say this: Chris Brown, you are an international superstar. You have sold millions of records and had umpteen Grammy nominations. You get whatever you want tattooed on your neck. But if it may be so bold, LiS would suggest one tiny little caveat. Look at the design and ask yourself: regardless of what this is supposed to look like, does it in any&#xa0;way whatsoever resemble the horrifying photo taken of my former girlfriend Rihanna following the globally famous incident in which I&#xa0;savagely beat her? If the answer to that question is: \"You know what? It does have a certain something about it&#xa0;that recalls the aftermath of that time I left her with major contusions on either side of her face, a bloody nose, a split lip and bite marks on her arms and fingers\", then it may be best to give it a swerve.</p> <p>Use that as a general rule of thumb. Looks nothing like the globally infamous photo of Rihanna's face after I beat her: fill your boots! Get \"ink\" \"done\" to your heart's content! Definitely has a ring of the globally infamous photo of Rihanna's face after I beat her: get something else \u2013 I hear an enormous ice-cream cone with the word \"brrrr\" across it is considered quite the thing these days. Because if it&#xa0;does look like you've had a tattoo based on your former girlfriend's beaten face a) it will be the single worst tattoo design in history, and LiS speaks as someone who has seen a man with Harry Hill's face on his arse, and b)&#xa0;people might tend to think you're even more of a loathsome misogynistic knobshiner than they already do: no,&#xa0;LiS wasn't 100% certain that was possible either, but apparently it is.</p> <p>But let us not be too quick to judge Brown's tattoo. His spokesman pointed out that <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2012/sep/13/chris-brown-tattoo-rihanna?\" title=\"\">the tattoo was supposed to be of a sugar skull</a>, a symbol associated with the Mexican Day of the Dead. Before you say: \"Well, it doesn't look like a Mexican sugar skull, does it? It looks like Rihanna after he beat her up\", it's perhaps worth checking out a&#xa0;photo of the unfinished tattoo that appeared on a website called <a href=\"http://thechrisbrownblog.com/\" title=\"\">thechrisbrownblog.com</a> last month, with the caption: \"No clue what it's supposed to be but I'm sure it'll look dope once completed.\" How wrong, you wonder, can a man be?</p> <p>In fairness, it just looks like a woman's face, which rather begs the question: what happened in the interim? Perhaps it was altered on Brown's instruction, but LiS prefers to imagine that the tattooist just got a bit carried away, largely because it likes to imagine the conversation that took place between tattooist and client when the latter saw the finished piece. \"So \u2026 happy?\" \"Oh, for CHRIST'S SAKE, this is EXACTLY WHAT I DIDN'T WANT TO HAPPEN!\" \"What are you talking about? It's a Mexican sugar skull! With embellishments!\" \"It does NOT look like a Mexican sugar skull! You've made it look like MY EX GIRLFRIEND AFTER THE INFAMOUS INCIDENT IN WHICH I SAVAGELY BEAT HER, you great CACK-HANDED BERK.\" \"No it doesn't. Look, I still want paying, if that's what this is about.\"</p> <p>Either way, while LiS wouldn't presume to offer advice to a global R&amp;B superstar about what to wear, it feels impelled to draw Brown's attention to&#xa0;the reasonably priced selection of polo-neck jumpers currently available in TK Maxx.</p>",
  "<p>The boss of British Airways has claimed that the question of hub airport capacity needed resolving urgently if UK citizens were to \"sustain a decent standard of living in decades to come\".</p> <p>Keith Matthews, chief executive of the national flag carrier, said that BA itself was now in an enviable position after the acquisition of bmi gave it 42 slots at Heathrow, and could \"get on with what we need to get on with it\".</p> <p>But, he added: \"This is an issue not for aviation but the UK.\"</p> <p>Referring to the new commission set up by the government to address airport capacity, led by Sir Howard Davies, he said: \"However relaxed the deadlines set for him, time is not on the country's side.\"</p> <p>Williams, who took over after the merger with Iberia saw former BA chief Willie Walsh take the helm of the newly formed IAG, has been seen as a more conciliatory figure after Walsh's clashes with unions. But in a speech to the Aviation Club in London he hinted that the era of BA cost-cutting was far from over.</p> <p>He said the industry had \"added capacity beyond sustainable levels \u2026 and failed to bring our costs into line\".</p> <p>\"There are welcome signs of a returning sense of discipline and also realism about the challenges ahead. British Airways was not \u2013 and is not today \u2013 immune from these challenges.\"</p> <p>Williams also claimed the BA brand was \"getting back to where it belongs\" and pointed to \"accolades\" for its TV commercial urging people to support the home team and not to fly during the Olympics \u2013 despite some in the industry querying the wisdom of the key message. Passenger numbers at Heathrow, where BA is the dominant airline, fell during July and August, while other airports reported gains.</p> <p>Williams praised the Heathrow Olympic operation but fired a warning shot to the UK Border Agency after signs that passport queues \u2013 which all but disappeared during the Games \u2013 were starting to return to the levels that garnered unfavourable global headlines earlier in the year. Citing passenger complaints of renewed waits at immigration, he said: \"If that [Olympic] performance is not maintained, we will do something about it, and tell the public.\"</p>",
  "<p>With <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/11/catalan-independence-rally-barcelona\" title=\"\">Catalan secessionism on the march</a>, as well as debates about Scottish independence and a looming referendum, the question of EU membership for possible new states has become politically charged. By <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/sep/12/barroso-doubt-scotland-eu-membership\" title=\"\">declaring that any state seceding from a member state would not automatically become a European Union member</a>, EU commission president Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso has dealt a serious blow to a key part of the SNP's plans for a \"soft\" form of Scottish independence.</p> <p>EU membership is vital to the SNP's plans in several ways. Automatic membership would emphasise the ease of the transition from being part of the UK to being an independent state, ensure continuity for Scotland's economy and the business world and simplify negotiations with the UK government over independence. While an application for EU membership by an independent Scotland ought to be relatively straightforward, it would mean that the new state would have to spend two or three years outside the EU. Those negotiations might be complicated if Scotland were seen as a precedent for other \"discontented\" regions like Catalonia or Flanders, and perhaps by issues like the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schengen_Agreement\" title=\"\">Schengen accord</a>.</p> <p>In international law, Scottish membership of the EU would depend on the question of which state or states are successor to the present UK. There are three answers to that question: that the \"rump UK\" of England, Wales and Northern Ireland is the successor state, but a newly independent Scotland is not; that both states are; or that neither is.</p> <p>The last answer is the least likely and least credible \u2013 somewhere, there has to be at least one successor. The balance of views among international lawyers supports the view that the rump UK but not an independent Scotland would be a member, but that is by no means universally held and many disagree. On the international law argument, the position is far from clear, and is unlikely to provide the comfort to Scottish voters that the SNP seeks.</p> <p>Greater help is to be found in a separate line of argument, arising from the <a href=\"http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:C:2010:083:0013:0046:EN:PDF\" title=\"\">nature of EU citizenship</a>. This was established by the Maastricht treaty in 1992, as something belonging to citizens of a member state and emphasising their shared rights to live and work across the whole of the EU. Initially, many viewed it with scepticism, as a largely meaningless add-on.</p> <p>Thanks partly to extensive academic work, and partly to judgments of the European Court of Justice, it has come to be seen by lawyers as something much more substantial and meaningful, sitting alongside and complementing national citizenship.</p> <p>Recent decisions by the European Court of Justice \u2013 notably <a href=\"http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:62008CJ0135:EN:HTML\" title=\"\">Case C-135/08 Rottman</a> and <a href=\"http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:62009J0034:EN:HTML\" title=\"\">Case C\u201134/09 Ruiz Zambrano</a> \u2013 have affected thinking about when and how that citizenship can be acquired or lost. In the former case, an Austrian man who moved to Germany to avoid criminal prosecution could not have his German naturalisation cancelled if that would leave him stateless and deprive him of his EU citizenship. In the latter, the Colombian parents of children born in Belgium and so Belgian citizens could not be deprived of rights to remain or work in Belgium, given their status as ascendants of EU citizens. These judgments might be regarded as \"<a href=\"http://eudo-citizenship.eu/citizenship-forum/254-has-the-european-court-of-justice-challenged-member-state-sovereignty-in-nationality-law?start=6\" title=\"\">judicial avant-gardism</a>\", but they are also clearly part of the body of EU law.</p> <p>All this bears on the Scottish debate because, if Scotland were to cease to be part of the EU and had to apply for membership, that would involve stripping EU citizenship from people who are current EU nationals.</p> <p>European court judgments make it clear how hard it is to remove that citizenship, so if a member state breaks up it is unclear whether that takes away EU citizenship. This has led to a legal argument running against the \"international law\" argument, that if an independent Scotland were outside the EU, this would unlawfully deprive Scottish EU citizens of their rights. That argument <a href=\"http://eutopialaw.com/2011/11/14/685/\" title=\"\">has been made most clearly by Aidan O'Neill QC</a>.</p> <p>In an <a href=\"http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getAllAnswers.do?reference=E-2012-007453&amp;language=EN\" title=\"\">August answer to a question in the European parliament</a>, Barroso sought to rebut the \"citizenship\" argument, repeating the treaty's language that \"EU citizenship is additional to and does not replace national citizenship (that is, the citizenship of an EU member state)\", and that \"in the hypothetical event of a secession of a part of an EU member state, the solution would have to be found and negotiated within the international legal order\".</p> <p>He reiterated the strongly \"statist\" approach in his remarks on Wednesday. This overlooks the jurisprudence of the European court and the scholarship surrounding that; Barroso sees the EU in a more conventional way as simply a club of states, which triggers ancillary rights for individuals only as a side-effect, rather than putting them at the core of what the EU is now about, as the court and many scholars have.</p> <p>Barroso's position looks like a powerful rejection of that line of reasoning, and an assertion of a more conventional realpolitik. While the \"citizenship\" argument bolsters the SNP's claim to EU membership, that cuts little ice among EU-level politicians. At the very least, the uncertainty this creates about the position of an independent Scotland further complicates the SNP's task in an independence referendum.</p>",
  "<p>Where is the ice? We are now at 83.20N which is very close to the north pole yet still there is no continuous ice cover (<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/blog/2012/sep/06/history-sea-greenpeace-arctic-sunrise\">head here for more on</a> my journey through the Arctic). We are mostly among small, thin, one- and two-year-old floes, with very little of the older, harder and more resilient \"multiyear\", or permanent ice that you would expect in these latitudes.</p> <p>Our ice pilot, Arne Sorensen, went up in the helicopter and found little change even as far north as 83.50 \u2013 just 350 miles from the pole. Just finding an ice floe big enough to moor the 50 metre-long Arctic Sunrise for the scientists aboard to conduct their experiments has proven harder than expected \u2013 something that many think is almost unheard of at this latitude.</p> <p>The obvious inference is that the ice has retreated far further this year than before and we will need to check previous years' satellite data to confirm this. But there may actually be far less ice in the Arctic than the satellite figures suggest.</p> <p>In winter when the sea surface is frozen up here, scientists can be pretty sure how much ice there is. But in the summer months when the ice is melting and there's much more water around, the satellite can become confused.</p> <p>It can think that melt water sitting on the ice floes is open water; it may not be able to tell the size of the floes or the distance between them; it can have problems \"seeing\" the ice because of clouds and fog.</p> <p>In short, the melting effect makes it much harder to quantify the amount of ice there is and the satellite tends to see more ice than there actually is. That's why monitoring groups such as NSIDC or the university of Bremen try to compensate with weather filters or by calculating the ice extent over a number of days rather than on individual ones.</p> <p>We know, here on the ship, how misleading the satellite data can be.</p> <p>Here, possibly only 50% of the sea is covered in ice. Yet the data is telling the scientists that there is continuous ice cover at this latitude.</p> <p>That's why Julienne Stroeve, ice expert from NSIDC the folk expected to flag the record minimum ice extent record in a few days' time \u2013 has been filming the ice conditions every few hours.</p> <p>When she returns, she hopes to match her real-time observations of the ice conditions with the satellite data. She speculates that the low fog conditions we have experienced could be making it seem there is more ice than there actually is.</p> <p>Either way, the situation is deadly serious. Both satellites and human observation suggests that the ice is now so thin over much of the arctic that it doesn't matter how much it freezes in winter, because it will melt in the summer. That would mean ice-free summers in the arctic coming far sooner than the models have predicted.</p> <p>Strangely, what we are beginning to see is just what the old Arctic explorers and visionaries such as Elisha Kane, Isaac Hayes, Captain W E Parry and Sir John Barrow hoped to find. It was widely believed from the 16th century that there was a tepid lake at the north pole, and that another continent lay beyond the ice. The problem facing explorers then was to get beyond the icepack which barred the route. It was this prospect of Arcadian lands that spurred these adventurers.</p> <p>Today, the prospect of an ice-free Arctic and easy access to the other side of the world has become the dream of oil, mining and shipping companies. The profits they see inn in the ice free sea are similar to those seen by the British from a clear passage over the top of the world to China and the east.</p> <p>But as Shell found off the coast of Alaska this week, nature bites back. No sooner had the company started preliminary drilling for oil in the Arctic Chukchi sea <a href=\"http://www.adn.com/2012/09/10/2619205/shell-halts-chukchi-sea-drilling.html\" title=\"\">it had to abandon the work because of freezing conditions</a>.</p>",
  "<p>The universities minister, David Willetts, is to launch a global drive to \"protect Britain's reputation\" and spread the message that it remains open to students from overseas in the wake of the government's curbs on student visas.</p> <p>He is also to set up a \u00a32m hardship fund to help \"legitimate overseas students\" at London Metropolitan University, who face extra costs as a result of the<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2012/sep/05/london-metropolitan-university-protest-foreign-students\" title=\"\"> home secretary's decision to strip it of its licence to sponsor overseas students</a>.</p> <p>But Willetts stopped short of demands from vice-chancellors to remove overseas students from the government's drive to reduce net migration to below 100,000 by the next election.</p> <p>Instead, Willetts told a universities conference in Keele that the Office for National Statistics would publicise statistics that made clearer the separate contribution of overseas students to immigration and try to improve estimates how many go home at the end of their studies.</p> <p>The university lecturers' union said it appeared the government was finally recognising the damage its student visa policy was doing to Britain's international reputation.</p> <p>Willetts's olive branch to the higher education sector over the government's drive to curb numbers of students from overseas came as 21 September was fixed as the date for the high court to hearing for London Met's legal challenge to the revocation of its Home Office sponsorship licence.</p> <p>The minister also suggested it was necessary for higher education to develop a longer protection scheme for foreign students \u2013 similar to the Abta guarantee when travel agents fail \u2013 should other universities face a similar situation.</p> <p>Universities UK said it welcomed the setting up of the \u00a32m London Met hardship fund and would take part in talks over a protection scheme. While it welcomed changes to the immigration figures to show what contribution students were making to reductions, it wanted the government to go further and remove students from the net migration target entirely.</p> <p>The University and College Union's general secretary, Sally Hunt, said: \"It appears the government is finally recognising the damage its student visa policy, coupled with threatening to deport thousands of fee-paying overseas students, is doing to our international reputation.\"</p> <p>The National Union of Students said the immigration statistics already gave details of overseas student flows in and out of Britain, and criticised the \u00a32m hardship fund as offering \"scant relief\" to students who faced an average bill of \u00a34,610 each as a result of moving university.</p> <p>Willetts told the universities conference that the London Met issue must not be allowed to jeopardise the success story of the 400,000 overseas students who bring in almost \u00a38bn a year in export earnings. He said it was necessary to take short-term action \"to protect our international reputation\" beyond the London Met hardship fund and the mini-clearing operation that will start next Monday.</p> <p>\"We have already used our Foreign Office posts to signal that we remain open to overseas students,\" Willetts said, before announcing a joint publicity drive with Universities UK in key newspapers \"in our target markets\", explaining that overseas students are welcome in Britain and reminding them of what a great opportunity it is to study in the UK.</p> <p>Willetts acknowledged that the public did not regard overseas students as immigrants and saw \"someone coming to study for a time and then going back home as different from someone permanently coming to Britain as a migrant\".</p> <p>But the minister made clear that they would not be removed from the overall net migration count: \"We will publish disaggregated figures. We will disaggregate the headline totals for net migration so that people can see the student element within that. We are not removing students from the totals. We are improving the quality of data on students leaving the country.\"</p> <p>Home Office ministers argue that the international definition of an immigrant covers anyone who goes to a country for more than 12 months and that removing them from the net migration statistics would look like the government \"fiddling the figures\" to meet their 'below 100,000' target. The latest net migration figure shows that 216,000 more people to live in Britain in 2011 than emigrated abroad. Students accounted for 232,000 of the 566,000 who were classified as long-term immigrants to Britain in 2011.</p>",
  "<p>As scientist <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jared_Diamond\" title=\"\">Jared Diamond</a> has made clear, it is most often lack of water that brings kingdoms to their ends. The ancient Jordanian city of Petra stands as a reminder that civilisations cannot easily withstand desertification. The medieval textile producers and traders of Bruges did not know that the greatest threat to their business came not from Florence or Antwerp, but from the falling water levels in the river Zwin, a threat they were powerless to halt. Can businesses now do better than the burghers of Bruges or the treasurers of Petra?</p> <p>Throughout the hottest North American summer in memory and the worst drought in 56 years, industries from shipping, food production, manufacturing and insurance have lost money, products, customers and access to markets.</p> <p>Some of these losses have been in industries where we expect to see an impact. The drought has threatened the livelihood of Midwest farmers, whose corn and soybean crops have been devastated. Bloomberg reports that yields in Ohio are expected to be lower than normal by 29% (corn) and 12% (soy). Purdue University predicts that Indiana will see its worst corn and soybean yields in the past 75 years.</p> <p>The precipitous rise in the cost of corn has had less obvious results as well. The nascent US ethanol industry faces <a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10000872396390444082904577605763027744608.html?mod=googlenews_wsj\">calls to waive</a> the regulatory supports that mandate the use of corn for fuel. The drought is already having an impact on the retail food industry. <a href=\"http://www.inc.com/issie-lapowsky/drought-threatens-small-businesses.html\">Magnolia</a>, a cupcake bakery chain in New York City that does not use corn, faces far higher costs for its wheat flour and for trucking its supplies. Unfortunately, the drought has not increased the amount its customers' are willing to pay.</p> <p>Perhaps the most dramatic consequence of this drought is the failure of the most important inland shipping route in the United States.</p> <p>The Mississippi River has dropped 3.6 metres (12 feet). The water level is so low that sections are now impassable for the barges that for decades have moved ore, manufactured goods and crops from the central USA to the Gulf of Mexico to be shipped to markets throughout the world.</p> <p>On 20 August, 97 vessels were stranded near Greenville, Mississippi. Shippers are losing tens of thousands of dollars as their vessels remain stranded. According to the American Waterways Operators, 566 million tons of goods are shipped on the river annually. Barges haul $180bn worth of goods. To keep traffic (and the US economy) moving, the coastguard is directing barges through the reduced stream, and the Army Corps of Engineers is dredging critical channels.</p> <p>Manufacturers have depended on the Mississippi for generations. For now, the barges are likely to get through \u2013 though carrying less, costing more and moving achingly slowly. But there is more risk and less certainty than there was a year ago. Such risks demand costly redundancies in systems and reduce the margins within which businesses must operate.</p> <p>Companies deal with unmanageable risk by buying insurance, and insurance companies buy reinsurance. The scale of this year's drought damage has overwhelmed them, too. Crop insurers stand to lose more than $5bn because they underestimated the risks of such a massive failure. Reinsurers are affected, too: Munich Re recently announced that it had lost nearly $200m because of the drought.</p> <p>Sustainable businesses have attempted to mitigate their long-term risk by implementing conservation measures, closed loop operations and more accountable sourcing of raw materials. But these aren't answers to sudden environmental change. Our supply chain-based models of sustainable business are most useful when the degradation of the environment is measurable, predictable and observable. We are learning to find new and better suppliers and to convince our customers of the value of more sustainable inputs. But little of this is valuable when the building blocks of commerce, such as roads, rivers and electrical power, become unstable and uncertain.</p> <p>Managers cannot always look outside the box in order to prepare for threats; there is simply too little extra time to worry about century storms and disastrous droughts. After the political failures of climate change conferences in Copenhagen, Johannesburg and Rio, world leaders have urged business to collaborate with other sectors to reduce the threat of global warming. The partnerships they advocated among thinktanks, environmental NGOs and industry associations can help businesses anticipate Black Swan events, and to think the unthinkable.</p> <p>Such initiatives are already underway. For instance, a number of large companies have partnered with the World Resources Institute to create the <a href=\"http://insights.wri.org/aqueduct/welcome\">Aqueducts project</a>, a water risk-management tool. By working with government data and the WRI's scientists, these companies have helped make useful forecasts widely available. These consortiums have yet to address the risk of catastrophic or sudden change.</p> <p>Sustainable businesses might be able to reduce their footprint, pilot better technologies, or bring fair trade commodities to broader markets. But to remain sustainable, they must also stay in business when rivers silt up. To carry on, businesses will need to work with their partners both to assess risks and to prevent future harm. Together with their partners, businesses can identify and advocate for policies to mitigate new risks. It may no longer be enough to be responsible purchasers and careful risk managers. Businesses and their partners may need to look at mitigating large, systemic risks, such as the impact of climate change on shipping and agriculture.</p> <p>No longer can we imagine that we live in a world in which the only victims of environmental damage are rare owls, subsistence farmers and island nations. This summer, we have discovered that not only the richest farmers but the biggest manufacturers in the US are vulnerable to drought risks. Firms identified with sustainability will assume a bigger role in society's discourse about environmental decline. We must not imagine we are powerless to stop it.</p> <p><em>Alison Kemper teaches management at York University and has worked with the Michael Lee-Chin Institute for Corporate Citizenship at the Rotman School since 2005.

  "<p>Moves to scale back the most widely drawn counter-terrorism powers left in the police \"stop and search\" armoury have been initiated by the home secretary, Theresa May.</p> <p>An <a href=\"http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/publications/about-us/consultations/schedule-7-review/\" title=\"\">official consultation</a> was launched on Thursday on the future of random \"stop and detain\" powers, which have been used by police special branch officers to question 70,000 travellers a year going through Britain's airports and ports.</p> <p>The move follows criticism from the government's own official terror laws watchdog and within Muslim communities that people from an Asian background are 42 times more likely than white people to be targeted for these random counter-terrorism interrogations.</p> <p>The national security powers, introduced under schedule 7 of the Terrorism Act 2000, allow the police and immigration officers to detain any airline, ferry or train traveller for up to nine hours to determine if they are involved in terrorism.</p> <p>People can be targeted by special branch under the powers without the need for reasonable suspicion that they are involved in any crime. Those who are stopped currently have fewer rights than suspects detained at a police station; they have no access to publicly funded legal advice and failure to answer questions is a criminal offence. They can also be strip-searched and have intimate DNA samples taken from their body.</p> <p>David Anderson, the official reviewer of terrorism legislation, has highlighted the negative impact of these powers on some Muslim communities, with many of those stopped feeling they were targeted as Muslims in order to build up a profile of Muslim communities. He has described their effect as \"bubbling under the surface&#xa0;\u2026 eroding trust\".</p> <p>The Home Office consultation document published on Thursday shows that the numbers stopped under the powers have dipped in the last few years from 87,218 in 2009-10 to 69,109 in 2011-2012. The latest figures also show that 60% of those stopped are from a minority ethnic background, with 29% Asian or British Asian. This proportion rises to 45% of those who were detained. A further 47% of those detained were from a black, Chinese or other non-white background. Only 8% of those detained were white.</p> <p>A total of 2,240 people were examined for more than an hour under these powers in the last year, of whom 681 were detained, nearly all of whom had DNA samples taken. In the last three years Home Office figures show that 2.8% or about 6,440 people have been examined for more than an hour, with 42 of them held for more than six hours.</p> <p>The consultation says the options being considered include reducing the legal nine-hour detention limit, introducing a \"reasonable suspicion\" test, increasing the rights to legal advice, limiting the use of strip-searches and repealing the power to take intimate DNA samples.</p> <p>The Home Office says use of these powers directly led to about 20 prosecutions a year for terrorist-related offences between 2005 and 2009 and that a number of key individuals had been convicted as a result of a port stop.</p> <p>The home secretary said the use of these schedule 7 counter-terrorism powers formed an essential part of Britain's border security arrangements helping to protect the public from those travelling across borders to plan, finance, train for and commit terrorism.</p> <p>\"Examining people at ports and airports is necessary to protect public safety, but we want to ensure these powers are used proportionately, and are effective. This consultation seeks the views of the public to help ensure we get this right,\" said May.</p> <p>Corinna Ferguson, legal officer for the civil liberties campaigning group Liberty, said: \"This review is welcome but limited and long overdue. Like discredited stop and search powers, schedule 7 doesn't require suspicion of wrongdoing, but even worse \u2013 allows people to be detained for nine hours and have their DNA taken and property seized. Most have been non-white, causing understandable community resentment. The court of human rights will soon hear Liberty's case challenging this power \u2013 so the Home Office may have to go much further than it has today.\"</p>",

Tunnelling through the turquoise waves, he dives past brightly coloured fish and coral, until he reaches the sandy bottom of the seabed, 20 metres deep, where he begins scouring for tonight's dinner.</p> <p>He wears no mask, no fins, and no diving tank. He prefers sarongs and button-down shirts decorated with seashell and starfish motifs but the most startling thing about him underwater is his eyes. They are wide open.</p> <p>Ngui, 30, belongs to the Moken, a nomadic, seafaring tribe of hunter-gatherers who live in the southern seas of Burma and Thailand. Little is known about their origins, but it is believed they descended from migrant Austronesians who set sail from southern China around 4,000 years ago. Spending eight months of the year at sea, the Moken roam in small flotillas of <em>kabang</em> \u2013 boats fashioned from a single tree and shared by a nuclear family \u2013 and return to land only to barter fish and shells for essentials such as rice and petrol, or to wait out the monsoon season in temporary shacks. It is a way of life that has existed, unchanged, for centuries \u2013 but one that may not last for much longer.</p> <p>The 2004 tsunami greatly depleted the source of the Moken's only livelihood: the ocean's once-abundant array of seafood. International fishing boats are now wiping out the little that's left. Those Moken who have moved ashore are often forced to take dangerous jobs for menial pay. Those who stay at sea are sometimes arrested for lacking papers or permits. Others return to land after months afloat only to find their huts destroyed and luxury tourist resorts built in their place.</p> <p>\"The sea has changed and life has changed,\" explains Ngui's father, Jao. \"Things we used to do we can't do any more. Places we used to go we can't go any more. Life isn't fun any more.\"</p> <p>It would be difficult to find a family that represents the changes wrought on the Moken as well as Jao's. He was born on a boat and spent his childhood at sea. He married at 16 and nearly pursued a traditional, aquatic lifestyle \u2013 until he and his wife decided to settle on land.</p> <p>\"Life was hard being illiterate,\" says Jao in the cramped house in Kuraburi they now share with a 13-member extended family. \"I wanted my children to go to school and have options.\"</p> <p>Education is still a relatively new concept to the roughly 2,000 Moken who live in the waters around Burma and Thailand, most of whom are stateless. A recent push by various charities and the Thai government to issue Thai identity cards has granted some access to state-run schools and healthcare, but claiming full-blown citizenship \u2013 by proving that they, or a parent, were born in Thailand \u2013 is a complex issue for a nomadic people who hardly use numbers and mark the date according to the tide, not the Gregorian calendar.</p> <p>Even getting children to school can prove trying, said Sumana Sirimangkala, headteacher at the only school on Koh Lao, an island of 50 Moken families on the Thai-Burmese border. \"Moken lack supplies like clothes, food, stationery, textbooks, shoes, raincoats, lifejackets, umbrellas \u2013 all the things that are necessary for children to come to school,\" she says.</p> <p>\"Moken can't afford any of these things, so the school has to provide it all \u2013 otherwise they don't want to come.\"</p> <p>Moken children regularly drop out to help their parents earn money, students say. Some boys as young as eight are sent to work in construction, while others help their mothers dig for shells \u2013 backbreaking labour in the hot sun.</p> <p>Nearly all the men on the island are hired by Thai fishing boats to plant explosives on the seabed, or to dive for expensive and exotic rarities such as sea cucumber. Sometimes they are sent down with air run through thin plastic tubes hooked up to a spluttery, diesel-run compressor; other times they dive without any air at all. Many succumb to decompression sickness (the bends) from ascending too quickly; some don't return at all.</p> <p>\"I'm afraid of being killed, it's so risky,\" admits a 30-year-old Moken who has just returned from a fish-bombing expedition. \"We wire together four to five dynamite sticks, connect another explosive wire that hooks up to the boat, and then I dive down to the bottom of the sea. When I come back up, the sticks are ignited with a battery.\"</p> <p>Sitdit, a Moken elder whose son died from decompression sickness during a job in the Nicobar Islands, says risks such as these are increasingly part and parcel of a new way of life.</p> <p>\"We are running out of resources, so our skills have to be adapted to the new challenges,\" he says simply. \"Sometimes the big boats get caught by the Burmese military and Moken are arrested. I had four relatives arrested by the Burmese military and they all died in jail.\"</p> <p>Apart from a handful of researchers who had studied their language and customs \u2013 notably the French father-son anthropologist duo Pierre and Jacques Ivanoff \u2013 the Moken were a relatively unknown lot until the tsunami, when headlines described the mysterious \"<a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/2100-18560_162-681558.html\" title=\"\">sea gypsies [who] saw signs in the waves</a>\". Charities and religious groups poured in with free supplies \u2013 food, petrol, boats and building materials \u2013 at such a velocity that some communities were left bewildered by the handouts.</p> <p>\"We had to become Christian to qualify for a boat, so I became a Christian \u2013 I even became a church leader!\" explains Sitdit, his charity-built, two-room stilt house facing the \"church\", an empty wooden structure with a simple roof. \"All we had to do was follow the gospel and sing songs. But then the church [group] cheated us, and now nobody goes to church any more.\"</p> <p>Today, a different kind of communion is going on, one where Moken women in sarongs while away the afternoon heat with card games and whisky so strong it makes the eyes burn. When the men return from their jobs at sea, they too take to drinking and gambling.</p> <p>\"There's an issue with their drinking a lot of alcohol \u2013 it's everywhere,\" says Jitlada Rattanapan of <a href=\"http://plan-international.org/\" title=\"\">Plan Thailand</a>, a charity working to support Moken children.</p> <p>At Baan Tung Wah, a Moken village of around 70 families in the mainland resort town of Khao Lak, children with snotty noses and dirty T-shirts beg for sweets while elders take shots of strong drink. Most of the parents are away doing menial day jobs \u2013 working in construction, spraying insecticides, or scavenging for recyclables along the beaches and streets \u2013 leaving the children to play among puppies and chickens in the rubbish-filled streets.</p> <p>\"Everyone in this village drinks \u2013 they hit their kids, too,\" says a shopkeeper, Kong Kwan, 35, who spends all day selling sweets and crisps to Moken children and petrol and whisky to Moken elders. \"Sometimes the police come, but they can't be bothered to deal with it.\"</p> <p>The community's 20-year-old youth leader, Big, says that life in the village can be stifling, forcing many youths to look for a way out.</p> <p>\"We're restricted to living in this area only \u2013 about five acres [2 hectares] \u2013 and because of the influx of hotels and resorts around here, the sea has been polluted,\" he says. \"That makes it difficult to go fishing. So a lot of young people just choose easier jobs, like working in hotels or at 7-Eleven.\"</p> <p>Big adds that the Moken youth have pretty much \"assimilated seamlessly\" into Thai society, so much so that \"whatever 'bad Thais' do, Moken do now too\", he notes. \"Drugs, stealing, marijuana, glue-sniffing. We never saw this before, and it's getting serious.\"</p> <p>The village is trying to counter such behaviour by offering classes in Moken language and customs to the children, many of whom are unaware of their traditions. Other classes, directed at teens, offer training as tour guides.</p> <p>The community leader, Hong, who heads the classes and created the village's Moken museum, hopes that turning Baan Tung Wah into an ecotourism destination may help get people back on track.</p> <p>\"Moken are supposed to travel, to be nomadic, to travel freely. So if we cannot travel freely, we are dead, culturally at least,\" he says. \"Moken children use mobile phones, study English and choose to be educated. We've abandoned our old traditions so much we risk losing them entirely.\"</p> <p>While many charities working for the Moken promote education and citizenship as giving new \"options\" to such a vulnerable group, Narumon Hinshiranan \u2013 a cultural anthropologist at Chulalongkorn University who speaks fluent Moken and has studied the group for the past decade \u2013 says this kind of \"one-size-fits-all development \u2026 limits their nomadic background\".</p> <p>\"I don't see education as an 'option', I see it as integration into Thai society \u2013 so that they are essentially cut off from their roots.\"</p> <p>Those who have pursued this new kind of life \u2013 such as Jao's 23-year-old daughter, Kang, who is so far the only Moken to have graduated from university \u2013 may determine what choices the Moken make next.</p> <p>\"I see myself as a bridge between the Moken community and the outside world,\" says Kang, who this month starts her first job, as the only Moken teacher at the school on Surin island.</p> <p>She will be living with her brother Ngui, along with some 200 other Moken villagers, but they will be parallel lives in what seems like a parallel world.</p> <p>\"I like to be out doing things,\" says Ngui, thrusting a hand out to the sea to explain why he chose not to stay in school. \"I dive to collect seafood, gather it up bit by bit, and sell it to shops. It's enough to make a living for now.\"</p> <h2>The Moken<br></h2> <p>\u2022 The Moken are one of many sea gypsy tribes across south-east Asia: there are the Orang Laut of Indonesia; the Bajau of Malaysia, Indonesia, Brunei and the Philippines; and the Salone (Moken) of Burma</p> <p>\u2022 Thailand is home to an estimated 12,000 sea gypsies, divided into three groups: the Moken, the Moklen and the Urak Lawoi</p> <p>\u2022 A 2003 study by Lund University in Sweden found that the underwater vision of Moken children was twice as good as that of their European counterparts</p> <p>\u2022 Food sourcing is subsistence-based: men traditionally spear fish, or use nets or traps, to find seafood, while women catch crabs and oysters by hand, or dig for shells. They also engage in basic agriculture</p> <p>\u2022 The Moken are often described as sincere and peace-loving, preferring to flee trouble than engage in disagreements</p> <p>\u2022 Traditionally animist, the Moken perform a large spirit-offering festival in the fifth lunar month and celebrate death by singing, dancing and drinking</p> <p>\u2022 Though the Moken give themselves only one name, the Thai monarchy has created surnames for them, among them \"Klatalee\" (\"brave person of the sea\")</p> <p>\u2022 A bucket of sea cucumbers, which the Moken dive for, earns about $10 a day. A small dish of the stuff sells for $30 or more in Taiwanese restaurants</p> <p>\u2022 Moken are often called \"dirty islanders\" by Thai people, a phrase that has encouraged many Moken youth to adopt Thai fashion and haircuts to fit in</p> <p>\u2022 Surin island, home to a large Moken settlement, was turned into a national marine park by Thailand in 1981, rendering illegal traditional Moken activities such as fishing and logging (in order to make boats)</p> <p>\u2022 Burma has been rumoured to be looking to permanently resettle many of its Moken and has already turned one Moken island into a military base.</p>",

It clearly shows a woman's face, distorted with curlicues and crosshatching: although she happens to resemble Rihanna, it does also recall the traditional makeup for the Day of the Dead.</p> <p>In February 2009, Brown assaulted Rihanna in his car, punching and biting her in the face and limbs. The singer required stitches. Brown later pleaded guilty to the assault and was sentenced to one year's probation. \"I just felt like he made that mistake because he needed help,\" Rihanna said in August, during an interview with Oprah Winfrey. \"He was my first love. Now we're very close friends. And that's not anything we're going to try to change.\"</p>"
