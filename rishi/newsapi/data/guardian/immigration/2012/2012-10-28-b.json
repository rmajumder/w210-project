  "<p>There is a glaring paradox about <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/jul/30/pussy-riot-trial-vladimir-putin\" title=\"\">the crackdown</a> Vladimir Putin has launched since being elected president for a third term. If Putin commands majority support \u2013 a recent poll found that more than 33% want Putin to stay beyond 2018 for a fourth term \u2013 and if the opposition that filled the streets of Moscow and St Petersburg almost a year ago is by its own admission unable to present an alternative, why is Putin resorting to methods of repression unseen since Soviet days?</p> <p>Methods such as this: an <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/ukraine-fire-russian-activists-abduction-17561490#.UI0bo7_YeIY\" title=\"\">activist who had fled to Kiev</a> to seek political asylum was kidnapped, maltreated for two days and told that if he did not sign a confession implicating fellow leaders of the socialist Left Front, Sergei Udaltsov and Konstantin Lebedev, his children would be killed. Udaltsov and Lebedev are being investigated for \"plotting mass unrest\" and face up to 10 years in prison. Other more Machiavellian methods are used. The prison <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/aug/17/pussy-riot-sentenced-prison-putin\" title=\"\">sentences meted out</a> to the feminist punk band Pussy Riot amounted to such an operation. At first there seemed to be little logic to it: the general prosecutor took no action when one of the jailed women, Nadezhda Tolokonnikova, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/25/putin-pussy-riot-western-hypocrisy\" title=\"\">took part in the group orgy</a> in Moscow's natural history museum in 2008. And yet when the same woman performed an anti-Putin song in a near-empty Moscow cathedral late at night, hell's fury was unleashed.</p> <p>Someone in Putin's inner circle sensed an opportunity to turn the tables on a protest movement fired up by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/dec/04/russia-elections-putin-editorial\" title=\"\">rigged parliamentary elections</a> last year. A conflict which had until then pitted the young, urban middle class against an ageing, corrupt and super-rich bureaucracy, was diverted into the challenge of a fringe group against a self-defined moral majority. Of Russians recently polled by the Levada Centre, <a href=\"http://vaticaninsider.lastampa.it/en/world-news/detail/articolo/russia-rusia-ortodossi-orthodox-christians-ortodoxos-18966/\" title=\"\">fully 79% described themselves as orthodox believers</a>. Part of the church that had started to air unease about Putin suddenly turned against the protest movement and Pussy Riot became a gift for him. Putin also weakened the opposition by appearing to give it what it wanted: allowing parties to be formed without artificially high <a href=\"http://valdaiclub.com/politics/48662.html\" title=\"\">registration hurdles</a>. The result was to swamp recent regional elections in spoiler parties which splintered opposition support. The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/15/vladimir-putin-hails-russia-election\" title=\"\">incumbent governors were re-elected</a> in each of the five regions in which they were held.</p> <p>The conflicts Putin has generated since his re-election \u2013 youth versus the orthodox church, liberals versus conservatives, westerners versus nationalists \u2013 all stoke the motor of anti-Americanism. America is officially a partner. Putin says so both publicly, and privately to Barack Obama when they last <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jun/18/obama-putin-syria-meeting\" title=\"\">met at Los Cabos</a> in Mexico. Those are words, but as far as deeds are concerned, the US representatives in Russia are treated like the enemy within, their motives suspect, their aid agency closed, their diplomats subject to intrusive surveillance.</p> <p>These are tactics, and Putin is a tactician, not a master strategist. But none of them answer the real question: why go to these lengths? Why shut down the internet when the opposition were inviting votes for a body intended to serve as a collective leadership, its Co-ordination Council? The <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-20037209\" title=\"\">process garnered fewer than 100,000</a> votes nationwide. Why not take such an embryonic movement in its stride? Putin's crackdown has Russia watchers scratching their heads. There are conflicting theories: he is vindictive; he is bored, disengaged and out of touch; he is more insecure than he seems.</p> <p>The last thesis bears scrutiny. It goes like this: the real struggle being played out is not the visible war against activists in the courts, but the invisible internecine tussle between rival groups of advisers in his circle. As the stability Putin managed to achieve in his first two terms turns to stagnation in his third, his authority is being challenged from within. A crackdown, selectively applied, skilfully manipulated, is Putin's temporary and tactical answer. But it will do nothing to tackle the source of his problems \u2013 a corrupt, inflexible, unreformable system of government to which his name and fate are inextricably attached.</p>",

  "<p>We all love George Alagiah; we just have different ways of showing it.</p> <p>A good many of us recognise him in the street. And he has noticed that when the spotters are white British, they probably hang back for a while; ponder the proprieties of invading his space. Minorities, however, do it differently. He shows us how: smile a foot wide, arms outstretched, booming voice, all forward motion. \"Hellooooo Geeereorge. How you doing. Come here; meet my wife. Come meet my mother.\" These aren't requests; these&#xa0;are givens.</p> <p>It could be tiresome but he doesn't feel it is. \"They feel they own me,\" he says. He is his own success; but he is their success. He is their forward motion. If he is doing well, they are doing well. But the opposite is also true. If he does badly, they do badly. More joy in this encounter perhaps, but undoubtedly, more pressure.</p> <p>If am seen as a success, says George, that's really only half of the story. My family came to Britain from Sri Lanka via Africa, and worked hard. But they could have worked hard to no effect. The other essential element was Britain. \"I am what I am not just because my family worked hard, but because of the opportunities we had in Britain,\" he says.</p> <p>The alchemy of successful migration. Why don't we talk about it? After all, the Americans use the same materials to concoct a sustaining narrative. They have Ellis Island: \"America's Golden Door\", through which passed more than 12 million immigrants from 1892 to 1954. Now it stands as a museum of migration. Where's our Ellis Island?</p> <p>George isn't just being wistful. There's method here, for as he speaks in the plush dining room of an accountancy firm overlooking the Thames, the plan of those who have invited him is to garner financing and support for Britain's own <a href=\"http://www.migrationmuseum.org/\" title=\"\">Museum of Migration</a>. Led by the former immigration minister Barbara Roche, the initiative is in its early stages. There would be an educational charity and a museum crafted within shipping containers, capable of being transported around the country. The project has initial funding. Ultimately, it needs \u00a33m. But that would be money well spent. High time we celebrated ourselves.</p>",
  "<p>The year after David Cameron became Tory party leader, he did something party leaders normally never do: he spoke at a fringe meeting of his party conference, such was his passion for the subject under discussion. I remember it well, since I asked him to do the debate and chaired the event.</p> <p>The issue was the environment. Cameron disarmed an audience filled with green activists, impressing them as he batted back questions.</p> <p>This was, after all, the cause so central to his drive to decontaminate the Conservative party image; remember those husky pictures, the green logo, the exhortations to \"<a href=\"http://www.metacafe.com/watch/1251723/david_cameron_launches_vote_blue_go_green_and_save_money/\" title=\"\">Vote Blue, Go Green</a>\".</p> <p>Within days of taking office, Cameron declared his coalition would be \"<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/apr/26/david-cameron-greenest-government-ever?intcmp=239\" title=\"\">the greenest government ever</a>\". For all the froth of his detractors he can confidently back up this claim, the tone set from the start with support for the 10:10 campaign. Labour argued it was impossible to meet the target yet Whitehall exceeded it; within one year, it cut emissions by 13.8%.</p> <p>It is logical for Conservatives to set the pace on the environment; it is about conservation of resources, after all, while reducing Whitehall's carbon footprint cut government spending with lower energy bills. Margaret Thatcher, a scientist by training, <a href=\"http://richardwillisuk.wordpress.com/2009/02/20/margaret-thatcher-%E2%80%93-climate-change-pioneer/\" title=\"\">was admirably far-sighted on this subject</a>, warning 24 years ago of the danger greenhouse gases posed to the planet. By painting his party green, Cameron was true to her legacy.</p> <p>With each passing day, evidence grows that Lady Thatcher was right to raise the alarm. Most worrying was the extent of Arctic ice melt this summer, outpacing even the most dire predictions. <a href=\"http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/global-warmings-terrifying-new-math-20120719\" title=\"\">September was the 331st consecutive month</a> in which the globe's temperature exceeded last century's average; the odds of this happening by chance are greater than the number of stars in the universe.</p> <p>Given this rising tide of evidence and the overwhelming strength of scientific opinion, it is strange the Conservatives appear to be developing cold feet. There is a growing internal backlash against the green agenda, one threatening to torpedo both the public trust in politicians and the party's stuttering modernisation project.</p> <p>Most visible was the promotion of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/oct/11/owen-paterson-environment-guardian-profile\" title=\"\">Owen Paterson</a> to the environment portfolio \u2013 a man hailed by ConservativeHome editor Tim Montgomerie as the only senior British Tory who could easily win election as a US Republican. If that is not enough evidence against him for this job, he claims to be a \"realist\" on global warming, opposes wind farms and wants to cancel green energy plans.</p> <p>After hearing Paterson's risible speech to party conference earlier this month \u2013 which failed to mention climate change \u2013 one green-minded minister said to me: \"Well, at least the battle lines are clear now.\" But his was not the only alarming move: John Hayes, who has also opposed wind farms, was moved to energy minister while Peter Lilley, one of the most hardline sceptics, was appointed last week to the Commons energy and climate change committee.</p> <p>Meanwhile the chancellor George Osborne is leading attempts to cut subsidies for renewable energies, abandon decarbonisation targets and embark on a huge expansion of gas power plants and shale gas development. The dispute inside the coalition over the forthcoming energy bill is so heated there has already been one special meeting of the \"quad\" group of senior ministers, with another pencilled in for this week.</p> <p>To his credit, Cameron mentioned green issues three times in his conference speech \u2013 unlike Ed Miliband, who despite being a former climate change minister ignored them in his own party address. But the prime minister is supporting Osborne on the energy bill, hoping a ban or tax on plastic bags will underline sufficiently their green credentials (although even this minor measure is causing concern that it might be seen as adding to the cost of living).</p> <p>Ill-informed loudmouths have long opposed policies to tackle climate change. Sadly, their views appear to be gaining ascendancy, such is the Tory leadership's desire to appease the right, combined with the fear of appearing elitist by endorsing measures that might affect the cost of living. \"It has become a totemic issue,\" said one senior Tory. \"Either you are a tough Essex man in touch with the people or you are dismissed as an effete metropolitan toff.\"</p> <p>The environment is far from the first concern of focus groups, although there is clear support for green policies. But if you believe humans are causing climate change, there can be no issue of comparable importance. Regardless, the debate has moved on in recent years: it is no longer about shackling business but about supporting a booming green economy that employs more people than the car and telecom industries combined, with huge export potential to the fastest-growing parts of the world.</p> <p>China alone is investing \u00a31 trillion in the low-carbon economy over the next five years; little wonder foreign secretary William Hague has emerged as an unlikely cabinet champion. Meanwhile such is the political prevarication, global energy giants are threatening to withdraw massive investment in Britain. To be anti-green now is to be anti-growth.</p> <p>Cameron has not given a speech on the environment since taking office. Yet along with health, this was the issue most personally identified with his transformation of the Tories. We saw the damage caused by bungled health reforms; imagine the dismay and distrust caused by shooting badgers, stopping wind farms, supporting airport expansion and strangling the green economy.</p> <p>There is a danger the short-term search for favourable headlines blows away any long-term sense of strategy. This is why the prime minister must demonstrate his continuing passion for green politics, which played such a prominent role in making him his party's first prime minister for a generation. Whether politically, economically or scientifically, it would be senseless and self-defeating to give ground on this crucial cause.</p>",
  "<p>The Vatican is locked in a bitter dispute with one of South America's top universities in a row that has resurrected ideological differences within the Catholic church long thought to have been consigned to cold war history.</p> <p>At stake is the seemingly obscure issue of whether the <a href=\"http://www.pucp.edu.pe/content/index.php\" title=\"\">Pontifical Catholic University of Peru</a> in Lima can any longer describe itself as either Catholic or pontifical \u2013 ie, papal. The dispute has highlighted lingering antipathy between Roman Catholic conservatives and proponents of liberation theology, which in the 1970s and 1980s created a bridge in Latin America between radical priests and leftwing&#xa0;militants.</p> <p>This summer, Pope Benedict XVI's most senior official, Cardinal Tarcisio Bertone, issued a decree stripping the university of the right to use either word in its title. The decree said the stance of the university, known as La Cat\u00f3lica or La Pook (after its Spanish initials, PUCP), was no longer \"compatible with the discipline and morals of the church\".</p> <p>Students and faculty have refused to accept the decision \u2013 and some claim there is more to the affair than misgivings over their university's liberalism.</p> <p>As the decree made clear, the Vatican has been wrangling with the PUCP for more than 20 years.</p> <p>The university has been closely linked to liberation theology since <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gustavo_Guti%C3%A9rrez\" title=\"\">Gustavo Guti\u00e9rrez</a>, the liberation movement's Peruvian founder, taught there in the 1960s.</p> <p>The row burst into the open less than three weeks after Benedict <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/jul/03/pope-appoints-watchdog-marxist-links\" title=\"\">named a lifelong friend of Guti\u00e9rrez to head the Vatican department that enforces doctrinal orthodoxy on the worldwide Catholic church</a>. Monsignor Gerhard Ludwig M\u00fcller, the new prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith (CDF), even co-authored a book with Guti\u00e9rrez.</p> <p>But, said Father Gianpaolo Salvini, a former editor of the Jesuit review La Civilt\u00e0 Cattolica and expert on the Latin American church: \"I do not think that M\u00fcller's appointment signals a re-evaluation of liberation theology. The term includes several, heterogeneous currents of thought. Some of its followers were perfectly orthodox.\"</p> <p>Father Nicola Bux, a consultor (adviser) to the CDF, agreed. Liberation theology, he said, only became unacceptable to the Vatican \"at the point at which it is argued that man's salvation can be resolved by means of justice to be attained in this world\".</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398482177\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2012/10/9/1349798510228/Gustavo-Guti-rrez-the-fou-001.jpg\" alt=\"Gustavo Guti\u00e9rrez, the founder of liberation theology, taught at La Cat\u00f3lica in the 1960s.\" width=\"200\" height=\"290\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Gustavo Guti\u00e9rrez, the founder of liberation theology, taught at La Cat\u00f3lica in the 1960s. Photograph: Bettmann/Corbis</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph:   Bettmann/Corbis</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>During the cold war, while Latin America was undergoing enormous upheaval, doctrinal issues took on a political dimension, said Salvini. \"Jesus became a social agitator and the poor, as referred to in the gospels, came to be equated with the proletariat as defined by Marx. That alarmed the Vatican. And the great fear was of the export of the Cuban revolution. John Paul II, a pope born in Poland, a Communist country, could not in any way go along with that.\"</p> <p>In Nicaragua, priests inspired by liberation theology took an active part in the 1979 Sandinista revolution against Anastasio Somoza's rightwing dictatorship. The philosophy also influenced leftist rebels in Mexico and Colombia, where one of the main guerrilla factions was led for nearly 30 years by a former priest.</p> <p>The Vatican never condemned either Guti\u00e9rrez or his writings. But he was repeatedly called to Rome, and in 1999 became a monk, apparently to escape the scrutiny of his diocesan superiors.</p> <p>The rector of the PUCP, Marcial Rubio, said that, in a letter to the Peruvian bishops' conference, Bertone expressed consternation at the teaching of Guti\u00e9rrez's works at the university. \"Bishop Muller says that Father Gustavo Guti\u00e9rrez is very important in the development of Catholic theology,\" Rubio said. \"How is it that it is wrong to read the books of Gustavo Guti\u00e9rrez here?\"</p> <p>Some at PUCP suspect the battle over the university's name is not about liberation theology, but power and perhaps money.</p> <p>Months before Guti\u00e9rrez fled into the Dominican order, Pope John Paul II made Cardinal Juan Luis Cipriani the archbishop of Lima. A member of the conservative Opus Dei fellowship, Cipriani has been campaigning to put the PUCP firmly under the control of his archbishopric. He has the support of conservative groups in Peru who fear the university has been overrun by professors with liberal views towards homosexuality and abortion.</p> <p>Luis Bacigalupo, a philosophy professor at the PUCP, believes the Vatican's backing for Cipriani could be inspired by other concerns. The university's campus and other real estate in Lima is worth about $300m (\u00a3186m), he said, noting the Vatican faces an economic crisis exacerbated by \"multimillion-dollar payouts\" in sex abuse lawsuits. He added: \"There are certain conservative sectors in the Vatican who are very worried about the financial future of the church.\"</p> <p>For Natale Amprimo, lawyer to the archbishop of Lima, the issue is simple: \"La Cat\u00f3lica belongs to the Catholic church. The professors must fall into line with the rules of the Holy See.\"</p> <p>Rubio said: \"We think of the university as a group of people, not the property of anyone.</p> <p>\"We're defending freedom of conscience, a plural education and freedom of speech. I think our archbishop thinks we shouldn't be that free.\"</p> <h2>Roots of liberation theology<br></h2> <p>Liberation theology is an interpretation of Christian doctrine that stresses what it sees as the church's duty to help emancipate the poor from social, political and economic injustice. Its roots go back to the 1950s, but the Peruvian priest Gustavo Guti\u00e9rrez did not coin the term until the 1970s.</p> <p>He described liberation theology as a reaction to \"a continent in which more than 60% of the population lives in a state of poverty, and 82% of those find themselves in extreme poverty\". He and other proponents of this school of thought felt the church had strayed from original Christian teaching by accepting poverty's existence.</p> <p>Guti\u00e9rrez wrote: \"The denunciation of injustice implies the rejection of the use of Christianity to legitimise the established order.\" Many of his followers went further, taking part in direct action and aligning themselves with revolutionary movements.</p> <p>In Nicaragua, priests took an active part in the Sandinista revolution that led in 1979 to the overthrow of Anastasio Somoza's rightwing dictatorship. Several also played a role in the Marxist-inspired government that replaced it.</p>",

He asked the venue's resident playwright <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/2004/dec/13/guardianobituaries.artsobituaries1\" title=\"\">Stephen Mallatratt</a> to rustle one up, with the proviso that the set and costumes couldn't cost more than \u00a31,000, adding that there was only enough money to pay four actors.</p> <p>\"He wasn't terribly impressed,\" remembers Herford, 25 years on. \"But he came back a couple of days later and said, 'Have you read <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/audio/2012/feb/28/susan-hill-guardian-book-club-podcast\" title=\"\">Susan Hill</a>'s book <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/feb/03/woman-in-black-susan-hill-book-club\" title=\"\">The Woman in Black</a>?'\" Hill's creepy novella had been published a few years earlier, in 1983. \"I read it overnight and said, 'It's a fantastic story \u2013 but it's got a dozen characters.'\"</p> <p>\"I've got an idea about that,\" said Mallatratt. His masterstroke was to make The Woman in Black a play within a play, one that needs just two speaking actors, and a backstage crew of four. Elderly Arthur Kipps brings a ghost story to a young actor; it's the story of something that happened to Kipps 30 years earlier, and the actor turns it into a drama. The older actor plays around half a dozen characters, while the other takes the role of young Kipps, a solicitor in the remote town of Crythin Gifford, who has to visit a mysterious house in the marshes to tie up a dead woman's affairs \u2013 discovering all too late why the townsfolk shrink from the place.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.thewomaninblack.com/\" title=\"\">The Woman in Black</a> sold out the first night it was staged, on 12 December 1987, and ran successfully for three weeks. A year later, it moved to the Lyric Hammersmith and finally to the West End, where it has played at the Fortune theatre since 1989. It is now one of the longest-running plays in British theatrical history, currently celebrating its silver anniversary with a parallel national tour. Its popularity has been further boosted by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/142855/woman-in-black\" title=\"\">this year's film adaptation, which starred Daniel Radcliffe</a>. Sadly, Mallatratt did not get to see it, having died in 2004.</p> <p>Term times are particularly busy: The Woman in Black is popular with school groups, since it's part of the curriculum. On the night I attend, the Fortune is full of screaming 14-year-olds, but the play is easily capable of terrifying older viewers, too. <a href=\"http://www.thewomaninblack.com/cast/arthurkipp/\" title=\"\">Ken Drury</a>, who plays Arthur Kipps in the West End production, relishes the recent memory of a man who gasped \"Fuck's sake!\" as a mysteriously locked door, central to the plot, swung open.</p> <p>So what makes The Woman in Black so frightening? \"The whole theatre is the set,\" explains Herford. \"If I'm watching something scary on the telly or at the cinema, you know it's just an image on a flat screen, and you can shut your eyes.\" From the beginning of the show, however, characters start appearing at the back of the auditorium, leaving the audience constantly feeling something could creep up on them. \"I try to preserve a sense of discomfort,\" adds Herford. \"There's no music playing, and I try to keep the air conditioning cooler than might be comfortable. The audience is slightly keyed-up.\"</p> <p>One of the most unnerving moments comes when Kipps returns to the nursery that lies behind the door and discovers an empty rocking chair \u2013 still in motion. \"It's the little things that get you,\" says <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/susan-hill\" title=\"\">Susan Hill</a>. \"Less is always more.\" And, like most of the other effects, it is simply done. \"It's fishing wire,\" says Jon Huyton, the company manager, revealing one of the secrets of a spartan set that amounts to little more than a door, some gauze, a flight of steps, a few pieces of nursery furniture \u2013 and, of course, plenty of dry ice. Sound effects are another crucial ingredient: trains, winds, tolling bells, and bloodcurdling cries all conspire to send the audience's imagination into overdrive. \"We've had screams go off in the wrong place,\" says Huyton. \"That's one to test the boys on stage, because everyone in the audience reacts.\"</p> <p>Although the play has remained essentially unchanged since its debut, it is regularly refreshed: each cast lasts for around nine months in the West End. \"Each time I do it,\" says Herford, \"I think, 'This really is a very good play.' And that's quite rare. It's a joy to direct each time, because you can let the new cast have their heads a bit.\"</p> <p>Deputy electrician Stephen Derham, who has seen casts come and go, says that one set of actors got through the play in an hour and 45 minutes, while the next cast stretched it to almost two and a half hours. Yet both, he says, \"scared the living bejaysus out of the audience \u2013 and that's the main thing\".</p> <p>Although everyone involved in The Woman in Black believes it will run and run, <a href=\"http://londonist.com/2011/04/top-10-longest-running-london-theatre-shows.php\" title=\"\">it has a long way to go before it catches up with Agatha Christie's The Mousetrap</a>, which has been in the West End for 60 years. Herford admits he has a vested interest in keeping the play fresh: like Hill, he earns a royalty. \"It hasn't made me very rich because it's a very small theatre and it's not a big percentage. But it took my son to Oxford, and it has given me a measure of security few freelance directors can enjoy. We've certainly made the government a phenomenal amount through VAT on tickets, far more than the subsidy Scarborough received.\" Hill adds: \"It's not squillions, but it's a nice pension.\"</p> <p>What of the woman in black herself? Well \u2013 and the spoiler-wary should stop reading this now \u2013 as title roles go, it is&nbsp;certainly one of the West End's strangest. There are no lines, and dance experience is preferred. \"You almost want them to float,\" says Huyton. \"We've just had someone performing it for nine months and she said at the end, 'I will come back, but I've got to do some speaking for a while.'\" Referred to as \"the&nbsp;vision\" by cast and crew, the woman is on stage for mere minutes yet manages to cause mayhem throughout the auditorium. \"From her first entrance, the kids scream like anything,\" says Huyton. \"They go ballistic.\"</p>",
  "<p>Imran Khan is, <a href=\"http://tribune.com.pk/story/401623/imran-khan-most-popular-leader-pew-research/\">according to</a> <a href=\"http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2011-08-14/pakistan/29886094_1_imran-khan-politician-american-drone-attacks\">numerous polls</a>, the most popular politician in Pakistan and <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/19/magazine/pakistans-imran-khan-must-be-doing-something-right.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0\">may very well be</a> that country's next Prime Minister. He is also a vehement critic of US drone attacks on his country, <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/today/hi/today/newsid_9757000/9757510.stm\">vowing to </a> order them shot down if he is Prime Minister and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/06/imran-khan-march-us-drone-warfare-pakistan\">leading an anti-drone protest march</a> last month.</p> <p>On Saturday, Khan boarded a flight from Canada to New York in order to appear at a fundraising lunch and other events. But before the flight could take off, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/27/imran-khan-detained-flight\">US immigration officials removed him from the plane</a> and detained him for two hours, causing him to miss the flight. On Twitter, Khan <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ImranKhanPTI/status/261913959890837504\">reported</a> that he was \"interrogated on [his] views on drones\" and then added: \"My stance is known. Drone attacks must stop.\" He then <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ImranKhanPTI/status/261916578134769665\">defiantly noted</a>: \"Missed flight and sad to miss the Fundraising lunch in NY but nothing will change my stance.\" </p> <p>The State Department acknowledged Khan's detention and said: \"The issue was resolved. Mr Khan is welcome in the United States.\" Customs and immigration officials refused to comment except to note that \"our dual mission is to facilitate travel in the United States while we secure our borders, our people, and our visitors from those that would do us harm like terrorists and terrorist weapons, criminals, and contraband,\" and added that the burden is on the visitor \"to demonstrate that they are admissible\" and \"the applicant must overcome all grounds of inadmissibility.\"</p> <p>There are several obvious points raised by this episode. Strictly on pragmatic grounds, it seems quite ill-advised to subject the most popular leader in Pakistan - the potential next Prime Minister - to trivial, vindictive humiliations of this sort. It is also a breach of the most basic diplomatic protocol: just imagine the outrage if a US politician were removed from a plane by Pakistani officials in order to be questioned about their publicly expressed political views. And harassing prominent critics of US policy is hardly likely to dilute anti-US animosity; the exact opposite is far more likely to occur.</p> <p>But the most important point here is that Khan's detention is part of a clear trend by the Obama administration to harass and intimidate critics of its drone attacks. As Marcy Wheeler <a href=\"http://www.emptywheel.net/2012/10/27/administration-continues-apparent-policy-of-harassing-pakistani-drone-critics/\">notes</a>, \"this is at least the third time this year that the US has delayed or denied entry to the US for Pakistani drone critics.\"</p> <p>Last May, I <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2012/05/18/drone_filmmaker_denied_visa/\">wrote about</a> the amazing case of Muhammad Danish Qasim, a Pakistani student who produced <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=sgkvYmelMFQ\">a short film</a> entitled \"The Other Side\", which \"revolves around the idea of assessing social, psychological and economical effects of drones on the people in tribal areas of Pakistan.\" As he put it, \"the film takes the audience very close to the damage caused by drone attacks\" by humanizing the tragedy of civilian deaths and also documenting how those deaths are exploited by actual terrorists for recruitment purposes.</p> <p>Qasim and his co-producers were chosen as the winner of the Audience Award for Best International Film at the 2012 National Film Festival For Talented Youth, held annually in Seattle, Washington. He intended to travel to the US to accept his award and discuss his film, but was twice denied a visa to enter the US, and thus was barred from making any appearances in the US.</p> <p>The month prior, Shahzad Akbar - a Pakistani lawyer who represents drone victims in lawsuits against the US and the co-founder of the Pakistani human rights organization, Foundation for Fundamental Rights - was scheduled to speak at a conference on drones in Washington. He, too, <a href=\"http://www.democracynow.org/2012/4/10/headlines/lawyer_for_pakistani_drone_victims_denied_us_visa\">was denied a visa</a>, and the Obama administration <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/apr/24/lawyer-cia-drones-visa-granted\">relented</a> only once an <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/apr/13/lawyer-victims-cia-drone-pakistan\">international outcry erupted</a>.</p> <p>There are two clear dynamics driving this. First, the US is eager to impose a price for effectively challenging its policies and to prevent the public - the domestic public, that is - from hearing critics with first-hand knowledge of the impact of those policies. As Wheeler asks, \"Why is the government so afraid of Pakistanis explaining to Americans what the drone attacks look like from a Pakistani perspective?\" </p> <p>This form of intimidation is not confined to drone critics. Last April, I <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2012/04/08/u_s_filmmaker_repeatedly_detained_at_border/\">reported on</a> the serial harassment of Laura Poitras, the Oscar-nominated documentarian who produced two films - one from Iraq and the other from Yemen - that showed the views and perspectives of America's adversaries in those countries. For four years, she was detained every single time she reentered the US, often having her reporters' notebook and laptop copied and even seized. Although this all stopped once that article was published - demonstrating that there was never any legitimate purpose to it - that intimidation campaign against her imposed real limits on her work. </p> <p>That is what this serial harassment of drone critics is intended to achieve. That is why a refusal to grant visas to prominent critics of US foreign policy was also <a href=\"http://www.aclu.org/national-security/aclu-welcomes-formerly-ideologically-excluded-scholar-tariq-ramadan\">a favorite tactic of the Bush administration</a>.</p> <p>Second, and probably even more insidious, this reflects the Obama administration's view that critics of its drone policies are either terrorists or, at best, sympathetic to terrorists. Recall how <a href=\"http://www.niemanwatchdog.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=ask_this.view&amp;askthisid=562\">the New York Times earlier this year</a> - in <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/06/world/asia/us-drone-strikes-are-said-to-target-rescuers.html\">an article</a> describing a new report from the Bureau of Investigative Journalism documenting the targeting of Pakistani rescuers and funerals with US drones - granted anonymity to a \"senior American counterterrorism official\" to smear the Bureau's journalists and its sources as wanting to \"help al-Qaida succeed\".</p> <p>For years, Bush officials and their supporters <a href=\"http://www.brendan-nyhan.com/blog/gop-dissent-attacks.html\">equated opposition to their foreign policies</a> with support for the terrorists and a general hatred of and desire to harm the US. During the Obama presidency, <a href=\"http://www.brendan-nyhan.com/blog/attacks-on-dissent-against-president-obama.html\">many Democratic partisans</a> have <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2009/10/10/prize_reaction/\">adopted the same lowly tactic with vigor</a>. </p> <p>That mindset is a major factor in this series of harassment of drone critics: namely, those who oppose the Obama administration's use of drones are helping the terrorists and may even be terrorist sympathizers. It is that logic which would lead US officials to view Khan as some sort of national security threat by virtue of his political beliefs and perceive a need to drag him off a plane in order to detain and interrogate him about those views before allowing him entrance to the US.</p> <p>What makes this most ironic is that the US loves to sermonize to the world about the need for open ideas and political debate. In April, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton <a href=\"http://www.state.gov/secretary/rm/2012/04/188008.htm\">lectured the planet</a> on how \"those societies that believe they can be closed to change, to ideas, cultures, and beliefs that are different from theirs, will find quickly that in our internet world they will be left behind,\" </p> <p>That she is part of the same government that seeks to punish and exclude filmmakers, students, lawyers, activists and politicians for the crime of opposing US policy is noticed and remarked upon everywhere in the world other than in the US. That demonstrates the success of these efforts: they are designed, above all else, to ensure that the American citizenry does not become exposed to effective critics of what the US is doing in the world.</p>",

Brandon Crawford, who had an RBI knock earlier,&#xa0;strikes out before Angel Pagan pus A-Jax on his horse in center - he hits it a mile away, but even that's not enough in the wide open spaces of Comerica Park. Jackson catches it with the heel of the glove, a little too much white there for comfort, but, an out is an out, as they say.</p> <p>Two down for Marco Scutaro, who is&#xa0;uncharacteristically&#xa0;0-2. Now he's 0-3 after grounding out to Miggy over at third, inning over.

I believe the latter, not sure about the former. Comebacks are tough when you can't score. Scherzer will have the ball tomorrow, question is, will the Tigers still be in the series by then?</p> <p>Delmon Young works the count full before drawing a walk,&#xa0;prompting&#xa0;a visit from pitching coach Dave Righetti.

Miguel Cabrera, Prince Fielder, Justin Verlander. Blah blah blah. See what a pair of sluggers, the best pitcher in baseball and a well rested ballclub get you? In this World Series, at least so far, the answer is diddley squat, and even worse, a two game hold to dig out of.&#xa0;</p> <p>It would seem on paper that Detroit is the better team, but then again, they won 88 games in a mediocre division, and perhaps we are seeing just how good the Yankees made them look. Or, maybe they just ran into a buzz saw out in San Francisco, a&#xa0;ball club&#xa0;that prides itself on being greater than the sum of its parts - they've are plenty hot, enjoying a five game playoff winning streak, stepping on hearts and eating faces.&#xa0;</p> <p>The good news for Tigers fans is that they are out of that big hot mess of a ballpark and are back home in the Motor City, where mom makes porridge for breakfast and everybody is nice. It's a much more pleasant place to play a game that isn't quite do-or-die, but rather, do-or-oh-man-we're-in-huge-trouble.&#xa0;</p> <p>With the exception of poor Jose Valverde, the Tigers pitching recovered in Game Two once that Verlander guy was out of the way, and so at least that side of the game seems to be in a better place for Detroit, especially with the Animal, Anibal Sanchez on the mound tonight. Even if he is lights out as he was as a Marlin while pitching against the Giants (3-1, 1.98 ERA, two shutouts), who cares if you can't hit?&#xa0;</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTLJ7Xl7mxI\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/kTLJ7Xl7mxI?wmode=opaque&fs=1&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>Pedro Sorrano channeled Jobu to help him hit the curve ball in Major League, but the Tigers need more help than that. They have three runs in this series, and all of them came in Game One during gar-bage time. Here comes the first class analysis you've all been waiting for - if you don't score, you can't win. Did you get that? Did you write it down? Call your buddies with the breaking news? I know,&#xa0;unforgettable&#xa0;stuff. It's true though, and how these guys are hitting .167 I will never figure out. This may sound familiar to those of you who watched the ALCS.&#xa0;</p> <p>It doesn't get any easier - Detroit face Ryan Vogelsong in Game Three, a nasty man, who has given up three runs in his previous 14 innings. Chew on that for a bit while you fold the damn laundry and cook your kid(s) dinner before the 8:07PM EST first pitch.
