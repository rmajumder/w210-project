  "<p>For the past 15 years Miguel Guerra has been living in the shadows as an undocumented Latino immigrant in the US. He kept out of view, avoided public places and never spoke his mind to anyone outside his immediate family.</p> <p>Not any more.</p> <p>Under a blazing North Carolina sun, Guerra joined almost 50 other undocumented Latino immigrants on a Sunday in a park on the outskirts of Charlotte, the North Carolinan venue of this week's Democratic national convention. It was in effect a mass coming out ceremony.</p> <p>For the past six weeks the group has been riding across the American south in a converted Greyhound bus bearing the slogan: \"No Papers No Fear\". They have stopped in about 20 cities in Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico, Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Tennessee, Alabama and Georgia before arriving in North Carolina, holding rallies and confronting anti-Latino prejudice along the way.</p> <p>\"We're no longer afraid to say we are undocumented,\" Guerra declared.</p> <p>For a busload of unauthorised immigrants to ride openly through some of these areas is no joke, even in 2012. Several of the states \u2013 notably Arizona where the journey began, Mississippi, Tennessee and Georgia \u2013</p> <p>have been at the forefront of the push across the southern states to tighten immigration laws with the express intention of driving out thousands of illegal Latinos back to Mexico.</p> <p>Guerra knows firsthand how perilous the journey was. Early on in the ride he and three other members of the No Papers No Fear group held a civil disobedience protest outside the courthouse in Phoenix, Arizona where Sheriff Arpaio, the controversial architect of harsh policing methods against undocumented Latinos, was at that time on trial for alleged civil rights abuses.</p> <p>Guerra, 36, was arrested, paradoxically handed over to Arpaio's own police department, which in turn passed him to the immigration authorities. He was detained for three days and is still immersed in deportation proceedings. Had he known that he would be arrested and potentially deported, he insists he still would have gone ahead with the bus ride. \"They want to criminalise me, but we are showing that I'm not the criminal, Arpaio is.\"</p> <p>Would he still think the protest was worth it should he be deported back to Baja California, the region of Mexico from which he came aged 21 to try his luck in the US? \"Yes. At least I know I played a part in history here, and can leave with my head held high.\"</p> <p>Organisers of the bus ride, from a coalition of the National Day Laborer Organisation, Puente and other groups, designed the journey to begin in Arizona, the state that led the anti-illegal immigrant offensive with its notorious law SB 1070. They decided to end the trip at the Democratic national convention in Charlotte, rather than in Tampa where the Republicans convened last week, because they hoped to have more impact attempting to influence the Democratic debate.</p> <p>There have been sparks during the six weeks of the ride. After the arrests in Phoenix, there was further confrontation with police in Knoxsville, Tennessee, where riders carried out a protest outside the office of Sheriff JJ Jones, who has plans to implement a deportation program known as 287(g).</p> <p>Four were arrested, including two undocumented people, though they were later released.</p> <p>The bus also stopped in Sylva in the west of the state of North Carolina. The organisers of the ride had heard that the sheriff there, Jimmy Ashe, had been erecting check points outside Latino neighbourhoods in the area where the police, backed up by immigration officials, were conducting random searches of papers.</p> <p>When the bus riders asked local Latinos to join them in rallying outside the sheriff's office, they were told that the inhabitants of Sylva were too scared of retribution to speak out in public. But by the end of the protest, many local residents had come and joined the rally.</p> <p>\"That was a microcosm of this whole bus tour is about,\" said one of the organisers, Marisa Franco. \"It's about taking the risk and showing that speaking out is more effective than hiding in the shadows.\"</p> <p>Natally Cruz, one of the riders, said that when she first joined the bus she was frightened about what would happen to her. Now 25, she came to Arizona from Mexico when she was eight years old and has lived there without authorisation ever since.</p> <p>She will be applying for deferred action under President Obama's new executive order that will allow young Latinos aged 15 to 30 who are studying in college to postpone any threat of deportation for two years and gain work permits. She is grateful to Obama for that, but calls on the president to extend the reform to include older members of her family, six of whom who have faced deportation and one of whom is currently in detention.</p> <p>She recalls the moment she joined the first sit-down protest at the start of the bus ride. \"I was scared of what they would do to me. But once I sat down and started to shout out I felt a great surge of energy \u2013 it was like a heavy stone I'd been carrying on my back had been lifted off me.\"</p>",
  "<p>This is the time of year when the house spider, Tegenaria gigantean, is most noticeable, when it has fallen in the sink or bath and is unable to scramble out. The large and hairy specimen is likely to be the male spider, having had this misadventure while roaming the house looking for a female partner. The size, hairiness, and tendency to dash across floors when disturbed makes these spiders particularly unnerving when they reach their largest size at this time of year.</p> <p>For speed they are in the Olympic class, supposed to be able to run at half a metre a second. The males have smaller bodies but longer legs, with a span that can reach up to 75mm (3 ins). Although they are most noticeable at this time of year, these spiders are almost always with us: houses, log piles, sheds and garages being their preferred habitats.</p> <p>The spiders build a flat web with a funnel into which they retreat to avoid predators and wait for their own food supply to arrive \u2013 unsuspecting insects which crawl across the web. They run out and pounce on what to humans are other unpopular house guests, beetles, earwigs, cockroaches and woodlice. In sheltered places these sturdy webs can be used for months and even years by successive generations of spiders.</p> <p>This species takes two years to mature and can survive for months without food or water and usually has to when the food supply of smaller insects disappears in the winter. When the males find a mate at this time of year they guard her until her final moult next month when she becomes sexually active. Frequent mating takes place. Contrary to popular belief the females do not eat their partners until the males have died a natural death, exhausted by their mating efforts. By providing a large meal he helps to ensure the survival of his offspring.</p> <p>The females store the sperm until the following spring and then produce up to 10 sacs containing 40 to 60 eggs, the numbers depending on the food supply. The surprising thing about these giant house spiders is that there are two distinct species in Britain, the Tegenaria gigantea and the Tegenaria saeva.</p> <p>Until 1975 they were thought to be identical, but careful study shows that the gigantean lives in the east of the country and the saeva in the west with overlapping populations around the Welsh border down to Dorset. In the north the two species co-exist and sometimes interbreed, creating a hybrid.</p> <p>This curious anomaly seems to be a result of colonisation after the Ice Age when one species arrived from the west and the other from the east and simply stopped spreading when the available habitat was occupied. The mixing further north is explained by the more gradual migration into new habitat as the weather has warmed. This process is speeding up with climate change, so this month giant spiders of both species can be found in Scottish baths.</p>",
  "<p>In an anniversary-obsessed year \u2013 with the Titanic centenary, the bicentenary of Dickens's birth (and Shakespeare's 448th), and the Queen's Diamond Jubilee \u2013 one such opportunity is largely conspicuous by its absence. Yet not everyone gets to burn down the White House after eating a fleeing president's dinner. There is even a helpful clue in the title: the War of 1812. It followed the US Congress's indignant declaration of war on 24 June against \u2013 yes \u2013 imperial Britain, a country grappling with a mad King George III, <a href=\"http://www.number10.gov.uk/past-prime-ministers/spencer-perceval/\" title=\"\">a murdered PM (Spencer Perceval)</a> and a 20-year struggle with France.</p> <p>Strange that, <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/War-1812-Continent-Cambridge-Essential/dp/0521726867/ref=sr_1_4?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1346595824&amp;sr=1-4\" title=\"\">apart from a couple of new histories</a>, the 30-month conflict on land, sea and lake has had little attention in either country, though <a href=\"http://www.vancouversun.com/business/Recalling+recognizing+1812+tough+Canadians+poll/7156919/story.html\" title=\"\">Canada pays more</a>. Its existence as an independent country with an undefended 3,000-mile land border is one of several major consequences of a silly conflict that embarrassed both sides \u2013 and still does.</p> <p>Britain had its hands full fighting Napoleon in 1812, and (as in 1914-17) Americans were cross with the way both sides' embargoes disrupted their trade. But they were especially cross with maritime Britain for seizing British-born sailors to serve in the Royal Navy, and for supporting tribal warriors like <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tecumseh\" title=\"\">Tecumseh</a> in the frontier wars.</p> <p>Expansionist politicians from the south and west (\"war hawks\" as scornful critics put it) had their eye on French and Spanish colonies on the Mississippi and beyond. Taking <a href=\"http://theweek.com/article/index/231328/americas-invasion-of-canada-a-brief-history\" title=\"\">British Canada would be \"a mere matter of marching\", ex-president Thomas Jefferson assured them</a>. James Madison, the weak fourth president, didn't want war. Nor did merchants of New York and New England. But the Senate came within four votes (18-14) of declaring war on France too. Madness. A shambolic three-pronged US invasion of Canada was repelled, not least by loyalists who fled America in the war of independence. Parts of Maine were occupied.</p> <p>It was not all one-way. The infant US navy was a meritocracy, grossly outnumbered, but its ships better designed with bigger guns, its privateers harrying British shipping in the Irish Sea. Overall Nelson's navy prevailed, but its \"sacred spell of invincibility\" was shattered, the Brits admitted.</p> <p>Once Bonaparte had been dispatched (briefly) to exile in Elba, some 14,000 of Wellington's veterans (he declined to lead them) were dispatched to deal with what London saw as the treacherous stab in the back. Britain's own three-pronged attack on New York, Baltimore (where the defence of Fort McHenry inspired <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Star-Spangled_Banner\" title=\"\">The Star-Spangled Banner</a>) and Washington fared little better \u2013 though British troops did trash Congress and burn the White House in retaliation for the burning of Toronto.</p> <p>US peace feelers had been out almost from day one and bore fruit in Ghent on Christmas Eve 1814, after London modified its arrogant terms and accepted the pre-war status quo. It left awkward matters such as fishing and the 49th parallel (today's undefended border) to be quietly resolved later. Canada remained British, America marched west, the Indians were sold out.</p> <p>After all that US blood and treasure had been wasted, the war hawks might have been in trouble, but for a stroke of luck. Before news of the treaty crossed the Atlantic, General Andrew Jackson, a future president, <a href=\"http://militaryhistory.about.com/od/warof1812/p/battle-of-new-orleans.htm\" title=\"\">thrashed the Brits (2,000 dead and wounded, three generals killed) in defence of New Orleans</a> on January 8 1815. It was a fig-leaf, but a good one for emerging national self-confidence.</p> <p>The two sides never fought again, despite some hairy moments during the American civil war (there was a UK pro-slavery lobby) and (shipping issues again) in the first world war. The balance of economic and military power remorselessly swung America's way until, in the dark days of 1940-41, Britain embraced its own subordination.</p> <p>It is a tribute to the myth-making power of selective memory that, besides the odd uneasy <a href=\"http://content.usatoday.com/communities/theoval/post/2012/03/obama-welcomes-cameron-to-the-white-house/1#.UEN2Vb9y9E4\" title=\"\">joke by David Cameron</a>, few in the Anglo-American family refer to the scandal of 1812 that almost led to divorce.</p>",
  "<p>For more than 20 years the phrase \"house of cards\" has meant something special at Westminster: Michael Dobbs's novel about intrigue in the post-Thatcher Tory party, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Cards\" title=\"\">dramatised on television</a>, produced catch-phrases and villains galore. A key part of the plot, older readers might remember, hinged on the Conservative prime minister's refusal to carry out a serious cabinet reshuffle.</p> <p>Yet for this coalition government, \"house of cards\" seems particularly appropriate, and the mood of internal intrigue is almost as sulphurous. Try to pull away the wrong card, or do it clumsily, and the whole edifice will fall.</p> <p>Shift George Osborne and the remaining shreds of economic confidence fall away \u2013 it's as good as an admission of complete failure so far. Even if he dared confront his friend, David Cameron just can't. Similarly, Nick Clegg can't sanction the demotion of Vince Cable without radically destabilising his own position as party leader just ahead of the Liberal Democrat conference. Cable may irritate Clegg, and indeed Osborne, but now that the government is moving ahead with his \"big idea\" of a national investment bank, it would look daft to oust him.</p> <p>Michael Gove, the education secretary, despite <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/sep/01/gcse-row-michael-gove-inquiry?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">the fury over GCSE grades</a>, can't be demoted because he has become a hero of section of the Tory right and is only halfway through his plans for English schools. Shift the health secretary, Andrew Lansley, and you admit that his NHS plans were a terrible botch; shift the transport secretary, Justine Greening, and that's as good as a green light for Heathrow expansion and a major U-turn. Any of these moves would trigger a wider slip of the card castle. They'd make Cameron's position look weaker, and the prime minister must know the piranhas are beginning to swirl.</p> <p>So while Cameron's advisers Ed Llewellyn and Kate Fall are hard at work scribbling lists of more junior posts for this week's much-trailed reshuffle of ministerial jobs, we already know that nothing like a game-changer is going to&#xa0;happen. Both Cameron and Clegg currently look too weak to surprise the political world.</p> <p>It matters, a bit, if Ken Clarke, the justice secretary, is finally shuffled down or out. It would certainly perk up the government to find some of the under-promoted women such as Elizabeth Truss and Margot James finally reaching big jobs, particularly if other women are to be casualties. But none of it begins to touch the depth of the problem which, if&#xa0;things continue this way, will finish both leaders for good.</p> <p>One can, if one chooses to be fastidiously neutral, feel a certain sympathy for the economic ministers. The economy is paralysed, shivering to death. But rather like the horrible summer weather, an icy jetstream of dire economic news has been hovering over Britain.</p> <p>The Tory MP David Davis, beginning the new political season with a warning blast from the Tory right, is correct to warn Osborne against blaming the euro crisis too much for his problems. But Davis's rightwing solutions, such as tax cuts for business and a destruction of Labour-era regulations, are not easily available to the chancellor \u2013 he's part of a coalition government, not a Tory one.</p> <p>Indeed, when Tory rightwingers call for a change of direction, they're baying at the moon. Reshuffles and new policies will have to be negotiated between the parties, and are therefore going to be&#xa0;balanced.</p> <p>Does it follow, then, that there is simply nothing the government can do \u2013&#xa0;that on issues of personnel as well as policies, it's stuck in the muddled middle as the weather gets worse?</p> <p>The answer, of course, is no. We're going to see an economic regeneration bill and the relaxing of planning laws, what I suspect will amount to headlines without much substance \u2013 though we can keep our fingers crossed. It all looks like a nervous stab in the right direction, a bolder charge for growth.</p> <p>The trouble is that almost all the thinking is really Labour thinking. The coalition was told its cuts were too deep and too quick, and has found \u2013 surprise, surprise \u2013 that it cannot make the cuts in&#xa0;welfare and current spending it thought it could, and has had to rely more on tax rises and cutting Labour infrastructure plans. Now, after three successive quarters of negative growth, with the economy flat on its back, ministers are starting to \"reverse ferret\".</p> <p>Infrastructure is back in fashion, a special national bank to push money into cash-starved businesses is going to&#xa0;be set up after all, the dire shortage of&#xa0;houses will be addressed, and planning will be made faster. What took them so long?</p> <p>Now, the obvious question is whether it will be done with the gusto and on the scale the government's critics have suggested, or whether the embarrassment of having to make a switch in direction will inhibit ministers from doing it fast enough, and big enough. Cameron and Osborne are going to have to fend off increasingly furious protests from the Tory right, once those MPs realise that, far from deeper cuts and the slashing of employment protection, they are heading cautiously the other way.</p> <p>Reading Cameron, and listening to Osborne, over the weekend, it seemed they'd decided to use the rhetoric of the Olympics as cover for a shift of emphasis, in a bluff \"all in it together, look what Britain can do\" way.</p> <p>My advice would be to be very careful about that. The Olympics was a Labour-won project that depended on billions of pounds of&#xa0;public money and public-sector organisation, leading private companies (some of them not quite so competent) towards a clear national objective. The message of the gold-winning Olympians and Paralympians is that public investment, properly directed, works pretty well. I'm not sure that's what the Tory conference wants to hear.</p> <p>As for Clegg, if anyone has ever had a quicker comeuppance for meaningless pre-conference verbiage than his suggestion the rich should pay more, I can't remember it. Sure, the wealthy should pay more. But if Clegg believes that, what is he doing in this coalition? If he really meant it, he'd have to resign and call for an election.</p> <p>No, I don't see that happening either. Words without purpose. I really hope that this stimulus does happen, and that it is big enough to work. But for now, all I see is a house of cards and a gusting autumn wind.</p> <p><em>Twitter: </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/JackieAshley\" title=\"\"><em>@jackieashley</em></a></p>",
  "<p>How easy it is to be Frankie Boyle, the somewhat nihilist Scottish comic, Sun columnist and specialist in the very modern trade of courting self-serving outrage \u2014 or, as the comedian Stewart Lee has said of Jeremy Clarkson, \"having controversial opinions for money\".</p> <p>The past five days have seen Boyle deliver an absolute masterclass. On Wednesday he punched his thoughts about the Paralympics into Twitter. Weirdly enough, they were not lachrymose salutes to the games' abiding spirit of hope and endeavour but, for the most part, wisecracks that might have fallen from the mouth of any marginally offensive club comedian: \"Austrian Paralympians seem a lot more able-bodied than most regular Scottish people\u2026 Apparently, the Saudi Arabian Paralympic team is mainly thieves\u2026 Sadly, our Paralympian in the high jump isn't expected to match his personal best. But I hear it doesn't count as it was 'Taliban assisted'.\"</p> <p>Compared with his most infamous stuff, this was pretty tame. But context is all and, given that the infectious sense of national togetherness that briefly flickered to life a few weeks ago has now settled into a kind of brittle smugness, it was once again the done thing to froth with outrage about a figure of relatively little significance.</p> <p>Note: Boyle is now in the midst of a nationwide tour that stretches into December (hyped up as his last, though that's an old trick), and he has a DVD out for Christmas. He must, therefore, have been thrilled when the Daily Mirror awarded him a front page: \"TV bosses lance Boyle,\" ran the headline, flagging up a \"source\" at Channel 4 claiming that the time had come to \"wash our hands\" of him. Such was a particularly rum turn in the story: the same channel that in 2010 waved through a very nasty Boyle quip about the severely disabled son of the model Katie Price, and was later censured by Ofcom, suddenly seeming to get cold feet. Put another way, it was OK with a joke about a blind and autistic eight-year-old raping his mother \u2013 \"<a href=\"http://www.broadcastnow.co.uk/c4-boss-abraham-writes-to-kate-price/5026070.article\" title=\"\">simply absurdist satire</a>\", it insisted at the time \u2013 but to crack off-key gags about the Paralympics is apparently <em>verboten</em>.</p> <p>The charity Mencap has played its time-honoured role, praising Channel 4 for its disability programming, but claiming that it would be \"disappointing if these steps were undermined by providing a comedian who has repeatedly caused profound offence to disabled people opportunities to do so again\". On the face of it, Boyle and his opponents are locked in a symbiotic embrace, whereby he gives them something to do, and they serve the notoriety that keeps him in business. If he is not around, someone else will usually take his place, as happened just before the Boyle hoo-ha, when Mencap thundered about a George Galloway tweet that had drawn on the Scots football-terrace vernacular and called someone a \"<a href=\"http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=windae+licker\" title=\"\">windae licker</a>\", and the MP for Bradford East eventually apologised. In all this, one very British thought seems to be mysteriously absent: \"Leave him \u2013 he's not worth it.\"</p> <p>But that is not the way modern Britain works. Public discourse has been largely washed of the language of ideology, social structures and the like. In its place, there stands the one shining legacy of the left's contribution to recent history: an increasingly consensual belief in the policing of language, as if rubbing out the symptoms of inequality will somehow erase their cause. Meanwhile, celebrity culture and social media elevate Boyle and his like, and you end up with a news archetype that now recurs about twice a week, when someone (usually famous, but not necessarily so) makes a questionable remark, and it all goes off.</p> <p>The stories flare into life, and then vanish just as quickly: they are not parables that might somehow change public attitudes, but silly spasms that fill a bit of space. Who now remembers Jeremy Clarkson demanding that striking public sector workers be shot, or calling for the abolition of the Welsh language? What about <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/apr/10/alan-davies-liverpool-hillsborough-disaster\" title=\"\">Alan Davies making a slightly careless point about the Hillsborough disaster</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/aug/17/rio-ferdinand-fa-choc-ice-twitter\" title=\"\">Rio Ferdinand's \"choc-ice\" (re)tweet</a>, or Ricky Gervais's infantile \"mong\" controversy? All grist to the churnalism mill, signifying precious little.</p> <p>Underneath all this, two connected issues bubble away. First, as anyone halfway conversant with social theory could tell you, there is a strong sense of these pseudo-storms obscuring real issues about people's rights, the distribution of wealth and power, and what we now call institutionalised prejudice \u2013 something neatly dramatised by the way that the Boyle hoo-ha overshadowed the inspired protest about the involvement in the Paralympics of Atos, the corporation whose contract for work capability assessments makes them a byword for the government's unforgivable treatment of disabled people.</p> <p>Second, it seems self-evident that vigilance about \"hate speech\" is in danger of curdling into a state of continuing hysteria. The police \u2013 the police! \u2013 investigate \"bullying\" on Twitter, drunken fools who issue \"racist rants\" on public transport go to jail, and, in response to such lunacies, fairly unpleasant people can easily become renowned martyrs. Put another way, while zero-tolerance comes hammering down on random targets, does Britain feel like a gentler, more accepting place? Not really. Such, perhaps, is what happens when you remove responsibility for human prejudice from the public realm and habitually call in the clunking fist of the state \u2013 which is a perverse consequence, to say the least.</p> <p>Another storm-in-a-teacup will presumably be along by the end of this week \u2013 though, over the past few days, at least one outlet has been giving plenty of space to a story that actually matters, bringing news of the anti-Atos protests and the wider issue of welfare-to-work to an audience of close to a million people. For the details, have a look at Frankie Boyle's Twitter feed. Funny,&#xa0;that.</p>",
  "<p>Oh I see, <em>that</em>'s the secret. There was a warning on the BBC previews website where I watch programmes in advance: keep the <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006q2x0\" title=\"\"><strong>Doctor Who</strong></a> (BBC1, Saturday) secret until transmission or suffer the consequences (extermination by Dalek,&#xa0;I&#xa0;imagine). It's the Doctor's new companion. We totally knew it was her, though, nice Jenna-Louise Coleman off Emmerdale, didn't we? But we weren't expecting her arrival until Christmas. Steven Moffat, who wrote this episode himself, has pulled a fast one, sprung Christmas \u2013 well, her \u2013 on us early.</p> <p>Crucially, there's an overlap. Naughty Doctor. Remember when you were still in the dating game and the next one was already lined up before the last one was completely over? (I&#xa0;was always the last one, if I'm honest.) Well, Amy Pond \u2013 Karen Gillan \u2013 is still very much around. And I'm pretty sure I still have feelings for her. Not hapless, hopeless Rory, he can go (via Dalek, Weeping Angel, who cares?).

Billie Piper too, seeing as this seems to be honesty time.</p> <p>What about this Clara Oswin girl \u2013 the character Coleman plays \u2013 then? Well, she is undeniably rather lovely, in her red dress.

Can&#xa0;there be anything scarier than a&#xa0;million mad Daleks?</p> <p>Oswin deals with what looks like a&#xa0;hopeless situation practically \u2013 by boarding up the doors, hacking into the&#xa0;Daleks' systems, and blasting out Carmen. Like it. She doesn't just know shit about computers, she's classy. You&#xa0;wouldn't catch Amy Pond listening to Bizet, would you? Never mind Doctor Who; I'm beginning to think Amy Who?</p> <p>Plus Oswin is a domestic goddess too: she bakes. The Mary Berry effect has reached even the Asylum of the Daleks. Souffl\u00e9s, mmmm. Oh, it's burnt, well she can work on that. And the souffl\u00e9 is mainly an elaborate and roundabout way for Moffat to shoehorn a laboured pun in. Eggs terminate. Pfff. Eggs actly.</p> <p>The laboured pun \u2013 yeah, like I can talk! \u2013 and the exciting new arrival aside, this is a lovely episode, overflowing with Moffatism and, well, Doctor Who-ness. It fizzes along, sparkling with life, warmth and wit. It&#xa0;looks good (love the Parliament of Daleks). It's scary \u2013 <em>quite</em> scary (maybe there is something scarier than a million mad Daleks. I'm thinking those Weeping Angels are. How about two million \u2013 or a billion \u2013 of them?). It's loopy \u2013 how can the Doctor possibly get out of this one \u2026 oh, like that. And because I'm a bit fuddled and firmly in&#xa0;my 40s, I find that a lot of the time I&#xa0;don't understand what the hell is going on. What, so Oswin is a demented Dalek too? Oh, that seems a pity, and how's that going to work out when she gets the side-kick job full-time?</p> <p>The M1A2 Abrams tank, subject of <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01mn5n6\" title=\"\"><strong>Richard Hammond's Crash Course</strong></a> (BBC2, Sunday), is possibly the nearest thing our own planet has to a Dalek right now, with its big lethal prong and its capacity for killing. Its nickname, too \u2013 Whispering Death \u2013 could easily be the title of an episode of Doctor Who.</p> <p>The Hamster (he did actually use to&#xa0;be Jeremy Clarkson's pet, did you know?) is not so moved by this machine's ability to exterminate human life, though. To him, it's a big boy's toy. 1500 horse power, more than a Formula One car, phwoar; top speed of 45.1mph; 120mm smooth-bore main gun; 240 calibre machine gun \u2026 hey this is like playing Top Trumps. Only it's Richard (I can't quite bring myself to call him the Hamster \u2013 it conjures up Hollywood rumours) who's playing.

He gets to drive, and squash cars, to fire the machine gun, and the big gun.</p> <p>He whoops and says it's awesome, unlike anything else he's even been in.&#xa0;And at the end of three days, the dudes with offensive haircuts declare what many of us have long suspected: that Richard Hammond is a total tanker.

The lord lieutenant of Clackmannanshire cited a nominee who felt he could not, in conscience, accept an honour \"named after a system his family had sought to abolish\".</p> <p>But refuseniks remain in a minority. The honours given out naturally reflect the diversity of today's British society. Often those who have become British express most pride at being recognised, as with Dame Zaha Hadid, the Iraqi-born architect of the London 2012 aquatic centre, or Sir Tom Stoppard's pride in becoming what he calls \"an honorary Englishman\", having been born Tomas Straussler in Zlin, Czechoslovakia. Those born here to parents who were immigrants often tell a similar story. Armando Iannucci has been attacked by those who feel a satirist must turn down any such recognition, yet saw his mother's pride in his OBE as helping to reconcile his own ambivalence about whether his Italian heritage was a barrier to being accepted as British.</p> <p>But even those who accept honours can share a preference for a less archaic name. So playwright Kwame-Kwei Armah said he was \"humbled\" by his own OBE this new year, which he saw as validating the \"pain, suffering and self-sacrifice\" of his parents, and the \"immigrant's dream\" of their Windrush generation \u2013 \"a dream that although far from complete, has made our country a warmer, more equitable place than it was when they first arrived on its shores\". More quietly, though, he said he'd prefer that honours were not given in the name of the empire.</p> <p>What prevents this reform is the idea that it would represent some sort of \"culture war\" between traditionalists and modernisers, where everyone must join their own camp \u2013 that which is ashamed of the empire, or that which takes pride in it \u2013 to debate whether to hold on to our past or to ditch it.</p> <p>But that stale polarisation looks increasingly out of date now. This jubilee, Olympic and Paralympic summer suggest there is no need to get stuck there, finding an inclusive sense of British pride demonstrated through a cocktail of the traditional and the modern, of our roots as a society and our future. <a href=\"http://www.opendemocracy.net/ourkingdom/sunder-katwala/feeling-british-after-olympics\" title=\"\">So 82% say</a> 2012 has made us more proud to be British and 75% that it has shown we are a confident, multi-ethnic society too. YouGov's post-Olympics polling for British Future showed a notable decline in association of the union flag with the empire, with Team GB now joining the monarchy as the flag's most prominent meaning for most people.</p> <p>Could the honours system not change in a way that reflected both its own traditions and the nature of modern, multi-ethnic Britain?</p> <p>That is the spirit of a suggestion from Bernard Jenkin, the Conservative chair of the public administration committee. If there is to be a change, he suggests the best reform would be to change empire to the Commonwealth.</p> <p>\"The transition from the empire to the Commonwealth is one of the greatest achievements of the modern monarchy and to recognise that in awards would be much more in keeping with the tradition and heritage of the honours system,\" he said. He is right that this does rather more than proposals for an \"Order of British Excellence\" to offer an organic, gradual and modestly conservative reform.</p> <p>The Queen is head of a modern 53-nation Commonwealth, which is not a \"British Commonwealth\". But it should not be impossible to find an appropriate formula \u2013 a British Order of the Commonwealth has been suggested \u2013 that would be seen by other countries as a positive way to promote the values and links of the modern Commonwealth too.</p> <p>The empire is an indispensable part of the story of the making of modern Britain. We need to talk about it, and teach the story of its creation and its dissolution in our schools. Its patterns of emigration and immigration contributed to the large British diaspora around the globe, to the multi-ethnic society we have become at home, and to the unique role of the English language around the world.</p> <p>Even as we argue about it, the empire is unavoidably central to the history our society shares. Our honours system could now tell the story, too, of how an inclusive and proud post-imperial Britain moved beyond it.</p>",
  "<!-- Block 1 --> <p> </p> <!-- Block 2 --> <p>Morning all. England have won the toss and will bowl first here at Lord's. It's a wee bit overcast in London and a no-brainer really from Alastair Cook. South Africa make one change to the side that were undone by Eoin Morgan's outstanding 73 at the Oval a few days ago. Ryan McLaren comes in for Morne Morkel, who is rested.</p> <!-- Block 3 --> <p>10.12am: We're about to get underway here as the players stride onto the hallowed grass. I hope they're more awake than I am \u2013 10.15am start! Good lord it's too early! I wonder what Old Father Time would say about this.</p> <!-- Block 4 --> <p><strong>England:</strong> Cook (c), Bell, Trott, Bopara, Morgan, Kieswetter (wk), Patel, Tredwell, Anderson, Finn, Dernbach.</p> <p><strong>South Africa:</strong> Smith, Amla, Duminy, Elgar, de Villiers (c/wk), du Plessis, Peterson, Parnell, Steyn, McLaren, Tsotsobe.</p> <!-- Block 5 --> <p>Steve Finn is going to open the bowling from the Pavilion End. Two slips in place...</p> <!-- Block 6 --> <p><strong>1st over: South Africa 6-0 (Smith 6, Amla 0)</strong> The second ball of the day is too full from Finn and Smith, as he has done all series, just pushes it through the leg side field and it runs away for four. The next ball brings a couple for Smith through the off side, a thick outside edge. 12th man is on with a couple of rags, there might be a bit of moisture out there. Michael Holding is aghast that England have not placed Ravi Bopara at square leg instead of extra cover. Think he was a point, to be fair. Finn knocks the bails off accidentally at the bowler's end with his last delivery.</p> <p>Harry Tuttle emails: </p> <blockquote> <p>\"Morning James. Bopara and Dernbach the key bowlers today. There's no need to explain why, is there? I wonder if Dernbach will develop into a Test player. Great prospect for limited overs, obviously.\"</p> </blockquote> <!-- Block 7 --> <p><strong>2nd over: South Africa 10-0 (Smith 6, Amla 4)</strong> Jimmy Anderson has the honour of the second over but his first ball is a sloppy loosener, Amla has a thwack but it doesn't come off the middle and easily fielded. Jimmy's immediately back on target though and gets one to nip away on the seam, Amla has a waft but misses it completely, encouraging for England. They actually managed to get him out at the Oval, can they get him early today? Er, in a word, no. Amla guides the final delivery through the covers with consummate ease. Four runs.</p> <!-- Block 8 --> <p><strong>3rd over: South Africa 12-0 (Smith 7, Amla 4)</strong> Tredwell and Trott are the men in the slips, and the latter has to be alert as Smith flashes at a wide-ish ball from Finn, not making proper contact and scuffing it on the bounce. A quick single from the South Africa Test captain next up, he didn't look like he enjoyed that Smith but it's a good run after a forward defensive. Finn sends a short one down the leg side and that's a wide ball, even though it almost clipped off Amla's glove.</p> <p><strong>Gary Naylor:</strong> \"Not sure that this is a day for Dernbach and Ravi's liquorice allsorts. I expect the ball(s) to swing all day and that we'll have two lots of 50 overs Test cricket. 240 might be a good score in these conditions.\"</p> <!-- Block 9 --> <p><strong>4th over: South Africa 16-0 (Smith 11, Amla 4)</strong> Anderson's line is a bit too straight and Smith gets a couple off the leg side. He moves his feet so quickly and I can't for the life of me understand why England don't move an extra man over to leg. Next up it's a jaffa from Anderson! Just outside of off stump, a low skidder with real pace that Smith misses and Kieswetter claims. And Anderson has Smith squared up trying to play through leg side, hitting it through his legs and almost trickling onto the stumps.</p> <p><strong>John Starbuck:</strong> \"James, Morning. It looks (1st over) as if Dernbach and Finn are on a converging course: Dernbach needs to get faster for his regular stuff so the mystery balls come as more of a surprise, while Finn is working on his own slower variations. Also up for discussion is which wicketkeeper will Broad want for the T20 series? Will it be someone who has a good record of taking catches off the skipper's bowling? Bairstow is already being mentioned, but I'd imagine he'll go on the next overseas tours as the spare keeper to start with.\"</p> <!-- Block 10 --> <p><strong>5th over: South Africa 17-0 (Smith 11, Amla 5)</strong> Tredwell drops a dolly at second slip! Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear! That was a chance to get Amla early and it wasn't a difficult catch, the South African edging a good length ball with decent pace outside his off stump. To be fair to Tredwell, it wasn't right in the bread basket, but England keep dropping Amla! Chance gone.</p> <!-- Block 11 --> <p><strong>6th over: South Africa 20-0 (Smith 13, Amla 6)</strong> Amla pushes one through the off side but it's well fielded by Bopara, diving low to his left. Just a single then. Smith is moving so far across his crease it's untrue, and he slashes one down to third man that rushes to the rope, only to be suddenly stopped in its tracks by a sprawling Steve Finn! Wonderful athleticism from the big man.</p> <p><strong>Keith Flett:</strong> \"The Beard Liberation Front: the informal network of beard wearers has welcomed news of new England captain Alistair Cook's beard at Lords today. It marks, a significant departure from the follicly challenged era of Andrew Strauss said BLF Organiser Keith Flett.\"</p> <!-- Block 12 --> <p><strong>7th over: South Africa 25-0 (Smith 13, Amla 11)</strong> Finn has Amla in a spot of bother in his next over...playing and missing before getting one to cut back into the top of of Amla's pad, half-hearted appeals for lbw but it was too high. Finn bangs one in short and it's pulled away for four, great shot but a needless delivery. A bit sloppy that and Amla gets a single off the next ball.</p> <p><strong>Gavin Phillipson:</strong> \"England really do need to stop dropping Amla - drop anyone but him! How many times in the series is it now - 5? Normally when you drop him he goes on to win the match for the Saffers - this time too?\"</p> <!-- Block 13 --> <p><strong>8th over: South Africa 27-0 (Smith 13, Amla 13)</strong> To be fair, there hasn't been too much swing out there this morning, just enough to keep the bowlers interested mind. Amla flicks one off his legs to third man, there is Finn again to prevent a boundary. It's another tight over from Anderson and he's bowled very well so far. England need a wicket soon you feel though.</p> <!-- Block 14 --> <p><strong>9th over: South Africa 28-0 (Smith 14, Amla 13)</strong> Smith gets a thick edge off Finn, but it's wide of gully and safe, earning the South Africa Test captain a single. Amla plays and misses the next ball \u2013 he's had more than his fair share of fortune so far today, and Finn then gets one to jag back and rap off the bearded wonder's pads. Not out says the umpire but England review the decision. It did look a bit high and hit Amla on the knee roll, and lo and behold, it is comfortably over the stumps. England lose their review and that was a poor decision.</p> <!-- Block 15 --> <p><strong>10th over: South Africa 32-0 (Smith 18, Amla 13)</strong> Change of bowler as Jade Dernbach replaces Anderson, the tattooed maestro steaming in and throwing in a few full deliveries outside off stump that Smith can't score off. A short and wide ball catches his inside edge and runs down for four \u2013 lucky for Smith as Dernbach persists with bowling way outside the line. Five balls of that over would have been given as wides had Smith left them! I know Dernbach is accommodating for Smith moving to the offside, but what happened to bowling at the stumps!</p> <!-- Block 16 --> <p><strong>11th over: South Africa 34-0 (Smith 19, Amla 14)</strong> Ravi Bopara takes the 11th over for England. Third ball of the over is hit straight back at Ravinder, who plucks it out of the air before attempting a shy at the stumps. The bails are thrown asunder but Smith was well in his crease. Still, that shows Bopara has fire in his belly today. He gets one to jag back and that looked out! Hitting Amla just below the knee roll! Not out though says Richard Illingworth, but replays show it would have knocked over the leg stump. Bopara beats Smith's edge with a wicked last delivery, great end to the over!</p> <!-- Block 17 --> <p><strong>12th over: South Africa 40-0 (Smith 20, Amla 18)</strong> Amla chips one over the leg-side infield, always landing safe though. Dernbach hurls in a slower one that Smith doesn't pick at all, giving England's bowler a wry smile in the aftermath. You get the feeling that something's got to give soon for South Africa, they're not scoring freely at the moment, Amla nudging the last ball of the over for a single on the leg side.</p> <!-- Block 18 --> <p><strong>13th over: South Africa 45-0 (Smith 22, Amla 21)</strong> Cook doesn't have a slip in place for Bopara and Amla edges one down to third man. It's a few singles here and there for South Africa to keep the strike alternating but they need to up the run rate a wee bit. To be fair, there were five easy runs off that over. You could argue either way really.</p> <!-- Block 19 --> <p><strong>14th over: South Africa 46-0 (Smith 22, Amla 22)</strong> The run-rate is 3.46 at the moment, but with wickets in hand, South Africa are in a reasonably strong position. Samit Patel comes into the attack and there's a little bit of turn out there for the left-armer. Amla's trying to play him down the ground but to no avail, before slashing one through the off-side for a single. And that's all South Africa get off that over, great start from Patel.</p> <p><strong>Philip Podolsky:</strong> \"Hey James, mind giving a shout out to the Israeli cricket team who are <a href=\"http://www.timesofisrael.com/israeli-cricket-team-bowls-off-to-greece-for-european-tournament/\">off to the International Cricket Council Europe Division 2 Championships</a>... Some seriously exciting young talent in that squad.\"</p> <!-- Block 20 --> <p><strong>15th over: South Africa 48-0 (Smith 23, Amla 23)</strong> Bopara again causing Smith a few problems, skidding it low and beating his edge. Still no slip in place and Beefy ain't happy about that! Just two runs from that over and the run-rate is now 3.20. They're going to have to up the anti, and the two batsman have a conflab down in the middle.</p> <!-- Block 21 --> <p><strong>16th over: South Africa 52-0 (Smith 25, Amla 25)</strong> So apparently if England had not let Amla off the hook with so many dropped catches this summer his runs tally would be more than 500 short of his current total! Try telling that to Tredwell. Another tight over from Patel and England are about to take the bowling powerplay.<br><strong><br>Simon McMahon:</strong> \"Morning James. 48-0 after 15 overs. It's not exactly Joburg in March 2006, is it?\"</p> <p>That it ain't, Simon.</p> <!-- Block 22 --> <p><strong>17th over: South Africa 57-0 (Smith 27, Amla 27)</strong> Finn comes back into the attack and he's coming round the wicket to Smith now, who fends a short one down the third man, with the despairing man at gully missing with his dive. OH NO! TREDWELL LETS ANOTHER DOWN! Smith edges one to slip and it's put down again, with Kieswetter perhaps distracting Tredwell with an attempted dive of his own. David Saker has his head in his hands on the balcony, and who can blame him. Catches win matches boys.</p> <!-- Block 23 --> <p>11.31am: We'll it's a drinks break and time for England to regroup. Time to take James Tredwell out of the slips? A penny for his thoughts right now.</p> <!-- Block 24 --> <p><strong>18th over: South Africa 66-0 (Smith 28, Amla 35)</strong> Amla knocks a six over Dernbach's head! It's a fraction too full and Amla just guides it over the rope beautifully, he didn't even look like he tried to hit it hard, just glorious timing. Smith then slashes one away past point and Dernbach finishes the over with a slower ball, conceding another single.</p> <!-- Block 25 --> <p><strong>19th over: South Africa 68-0 (Smith 29, Amla 36)</strong> Good over from Finn but more excellent running from these South African openers, with Amla just knocking one short and sprinting to the opposite crease. Amla then wafts at a wide and short effort, missing it completely. Two runs from the over.</p> <p><strong>Bernard Walsh:</strong> \"James, the catch that Treadwell dropped off Finn wasn't his fault at all, Kieswetter dived right in front of Tredders, totally obstructed his view yet didn't get a glove on the ball, you wouldn't expect to see a howler like that by a club cricket third eleven 'keeper. Although Kieswetter takes the occasional stunning catch his glove work is generally shoddy and i'm not sure why England persist with him.\"</p> <p>I do agree that Kieswetter put him off, but Tredwell still should have done better. It went straight through him. Thoughts everyone?</p> <!-- Block 26 --> <p><strong>WICKET! South Africa 68-1 (Smith b Dernbach, c Kieswetter 29)</strong></p> <!-- Block 27 --> <p>Poor shot from Smith but a good ball from Dernbach, banging it in short and straight. Well taken by Kieswetter high above his head. That's the breakthrough! Next in, Duminy.</p> <!-- Block 28 --> <p><strong>20th over: South Africa 72-1 (Amla 36, Duminy 4)</strong> Duminy leaves his first two but then edges one wide of Tredwell and down to the boundary for four. So unlucky for Dernbach, who is bowling excellently, and that may have carried if England had a second slip in place. Fine over.</p> <!-- Block 29 --> <p><strong>21st over: South Africa 80-1 (Amla 37, Duminy 10)</strong> Good piece of fielding from Patel at mid-wicket, who hurls one at the stumps after Amla had called a quick single off Finn. Duminy is well in his crease, though, despite the decision going to the third umpire. Duminy then fishes at a square drive, gets a thick outside edge, and it runs away for four, just evading Morgan at backward point. The left-hander then opens the face and hits it the other side of Morgan, along the ground this time, for a single.</p> <!-- Block 30 --> <p><strong>22nd over: South Africa 87-1 (Amla 39, Duminy 15)</strong> Dernbach continues to run in at full tilt and Amla drives him through the covers, but Ian Bell is quickly across to save a boundary. Next up is a short one to Duminy, who ducks underneath it and doesn't fall into the same trap as Graeme Smith. Wonderful shot from JP, whose on-drive is straight down the ground and races to the rope.</p> <!-- Block 31 --> <p><strong>23rd over: South Africa 90-1 (Amla 40, Duminy 16)</strong> Anderson takes the reins and brings some renewed pace into the attack. He gets one to jag back into Amla's midriff, with South Africa running a single. Duminy goes back to an open face with Anderson bowling round the wicket to the left hander.</p> <p><strong>Simon McMahon:</strong> \"The first drop was unforgivable for two reasons. 1 - it was 'regulation' and 2 - it was Amla. The second was understandable because the keeper went for it, diving across and putting Treadwell off. He shouldn't be too hard on himself though. England's catching has been poor all summer, he obviously doesn't want to feel left out.\"</p> <!-- Block 32 --> <p><strong>24th over: South Africa 98-1 (Amla 45, Duminy 17)</strong> James Tredwell comes into the attack. Let's hope he can put those dropped catches out of his mind and focus on his bowling. Duminy paddles one down to fine leg and the next delivery beats both Amla and Kieswetter all ends up, one into the extras column. Last ball of the over...and it's swept to the square leg boundary by Amla, wonderful shot, reaching well outside the off stump.</p> <!-- Block 33 --> <p><strong>WICKET! South Africa 100-2 (Amla b Bopara 45)</strong></p> <!-- Block 34 --> <p>Delightful inswinger from Bopara, full length and beating Amla all ends up, hitting middle and leg. Who would have thunk it?! That's a key wicket for England.</p> <!-- Block 35 --> <p><strong>25th over: South Africa 105-2 (Duminy 18, De Villiers 4)</strong> Bopara from the Pavilion End and that's a great over from him. The dismissal of Amla is obviously key, and he nearly takes the immediate scalp of AB De Villiers, who drags one inches past his stumps, running away to the backward square leg boundary for three, Dernbach diving to save the boundary.</p> <!-- Block 36 --> <p><strong>WICKET! South Africa 106-3 (Duminy b Tredwell, st Kieswetter 18)</strong></p> <!-- Block 37 --> <p>Now we're talking! Tredwell, redeeming himself for his butter fingers, drifts a lovely off-spinner that drags Duminy out of his crease, nipping away from the batsman and giving Kieswetter ample time to nick the bails away.</p> <!-- Block 38 --> <p><strong>26th over: South Africa 106-3 (De Villiers 5, Du Plessis 0)</strong> Excellent over from James Tredwell and that will have done him the world of good after those earlier dropped catches. Faf Du Plessis is next in.</p> <!-- Block 39 --> <p><strong>27th over: South Africa 112-3 (De Villiers 11, Du Plessis 0)</strong> De Villiers with a textbook drive down the ground for four off Bopara, but next up he's in a spot of bother as Bopara throws down an inswinger that clatters off his pads, always going down leg though. Six from the over and England are in a stronger position now. 270 the par score in the last five ODI's at Lord's, but this pitch looks a bit more favourable to the bowlers.</p> <p><strong>Gary Naylor:</strong> \"Another 240 par pitch being misread by batting sides too keen to get on with it. As with most things in cricket, I blame the IPL.\"</p> <!-- Block 40 --> <p><strong>28th over: South Africa 114-3 (De Villiers 12, Du Plessis 1)</strong> Tredwell is getting a lot of spin out there and there's just two from the over. A few more quick wickets and this would begin to slip away from South Africa, but there is still a lot of batting left in this side. You can see the confidence oozing from Tredwell now, what a change from earlier, when he wanted a gaping hole in the ground to gobble him up.</p> <!-- Block 41 --> <p><strong>WICKET! South Africa 115-4 (Du Plessis b Bopara, 1)</strong></p> <!-- Block 42 --> <p><strong>29th over: South Africa 115-4 (De Villiers 13, Elgar 0)</strong> This is a great spell from Bopara. He's really got the bit between his teeth and two wickets to his name now. Three wickets from 15 runs for South Africa and I'd be a bit worried if I was De Villiers. It was an awful shot from Du Plessis, a man who is horribly out of nick, attempting to guide the ball down to third man but playing on instead. Next in is David Elgar.</p> <!-- Block 43 --> <p><strong>30th over: South Africa 118-4 (De Villiers 15, Elgar 1)</strong> Great ball from Tredwell! The off-spinner drifts one in to Elgar and it spins back viciously into Kiewsetter's gloves. Elgar gets off the mark, though, cutting a short one through the off side for a single. 20 overs remaining in this innings, South Africa need to consider their tactics now. Attack, or focus on seeing out the overs?</p> <!-- Block 44 --> <p><strong>31st over: South Africa 122-4 (De Villiers 17, Elgar 3)</strong> Bopara to continue his excellent spell but still Alastair Cook doesn't put a slip in place. Surprising, says Nasser Hussain, when you consider his figures during this game so far. Another tight over from Ravi, four off it, and England are beginning to turn the screw. 7 overs, 2-26 for Bopara.</p> <!-- Block 45 --> <p><strong>32nd over: South Africa 126-4 (De Villiers 18, Elgar 6)</strong> Elgar cuts Tredwell behind square for two, it's crucial that he tries to form a solid partnership with De Villiers now. De Villiers then knocks one through mid-wicket to keep him on strike. When are South Africa going to start hitting big?</p> <!-- Block 46 --> <p><strong>33rd over: South Africa 128-4 (De Villiers 19, Elgar 6)</strong> Bopara is bowling some first class stuff out there. His length is pretty full and his tight line is not allowing the new man in Elgar any easy runs. At this rate South Africa will do well to reach 220-230, which may not be enough on this pitch. Drinks break now for the players and a chance for both teams to consider their approaches for the remaining 16 overs. Anyone think South Africa can still post a good score?</p> <!-- Block 47 --> <p><strong>34th over: South Africa 130-4 (De Villiers 20, Elgar 8)</strong> Elgar dinks one over his shoulder off Patel for one, and Cook has brought a slip up in for Patel. Vicious turn from Patel from outside Elgar's off stump, bringing it back into the left-hander. Only two runs off the over and De Villiers needs to up the ante.</p> <!-- Block 48 --> <p><strong>35th over: South Africa 136-4 (De Villiers 23, Elgar 11)</strong> England now seem to be happy with allowing South Africa long singles to the outfield. Alastair Cook, fielding at mid-on, doesn't even attempt a shy at the stumps as Elgar scampers across for one. The batsman was always favourite to make that, but that epitomises England's approach right now. Six from the over, but no boundaries. Mandatory batting powerplay for South Africa.</p> <!-- Block 49 --> <p><strong>36th over: South Africa 141-4 (De Villiers 25, Elgar 14)</strong> South Africa's run-rate is still under four an over as Patel trots in once again. The responsibility is truly with De Villiers right now, he's playing solidly outside the off stump but with Elgar at the other end, not exactly scoring freely, he may feel like cutting loose soon. Having said that, these two need to stay in and form a partnership.</p> <!-- Block 50 --> <p><strong>37th over: South Africa 145-4 (De Villiers 25, Elgar 16)</strong> Finn strides in again and Elgar plays inside the line of the first delivery. Next up and it's an away swinger, but it just moves too much and that's given as a wide. Finn is cramping Elgar up in his crease here, banging them in short and straight at an awkward height. One jumps up at he batsman who has to fend it off right underneath his nose, well done. But Finn again concedes a wide as one slides down the leg side, great take from Kiewswetter though. Finn attempts a yorker but Elgar flicks it off his pads down to fine leg, Anderson fields, but looked to have pulled a muscle perhaps, he's moving a bit gingerly.</p> <!-- Block 51 --> <p><strong>38th over: South Africa 148-4 (De Villiers 26, Elgar 18)</strong> Patel is getting a lot of turn out there and it's another good over from him, just three off it. The run-rate is 3.89 with 12 overs remaining. At the moment South Africa are on for about 210-20, but you expect them to start swinging soon.</p> <!-- Block 52 --> <p><strong>39th over: South Africa 151-4 (De Villiers 29, Elgar 18)</strong> Finn powers in and bangs a short one down, cracking the South African captain on the lower arm. That will hurt for sure, but De Villiers just gets on with it. Astonishing cricket...Finn sends a short and wide one down the off side, but AB demonstrates wonderful footwork to trot across the line and guide it back to leg. He's jumping across his stumps like a cat on a hot tin roof, but doing well at the moment. Three from the over, Finn will take that.</p> <!-- Block 53 --> <p><strong>40th over: South Africa 160-4 (De Villiers 34, Elgar 22)</strong> Elgar drags one to the wide long-on boundary off Patel but it still doesn't reach the rope, as Anderson jogs across to field. He still doesn't look altogether comfortable out there Jimmy. De Villiers edges one down to third man, it beats Kieswetter and Trott gallops down, diving well to save the four. Elgar attempts an ambitious thwack to cow corner but doesn't quite get hold of it. Still, nine off that over.</p> <!-- Block 54 --> <p><strong>WICKET! South Africa 166-5 (De Villiers b Tredwell, st Kieswetter 39)</strong></p> <!-- Block 55 --> <p><strong>41st over: South Africa 166-5 (Elgar 23, Parnell 0)</strong> That's a crucial wicket for England and nice work with the gloves from Kieswetter. Tredwell tempted De Villiers out of his crease for a booming cover drive, but he misses it completely and, after a review, is stumped. Parnell is the next man in.</p> <!-- Block 56 --> <p><strong>42nd over: South Africa 170-5 (Elgar 25, Parnell 2)</strong> South Africa's run-rate has just crept above 4, and their projected total is still looking a wee bit light. Samit Patel again keeping it reasonably tight in that over, as Wayne Parnell gets off the mark with a couple of singles. Jade Dernbach next into the attack...</p> <!-- Block 57 --> <p><strong>43rd over: South Africa 174-5 (Elgar 25, Parnell 5)</strong> Now Dernbach should be in his element, with South Africa chasing the runs, his variation could be deadly, and Alastair Cook has stuck two slips in. Mix up in the field between Bell and Trott. The Warwickshire team-mates get in a real muddle out in the field, Trott attempting a dummy slide that Bell misinterprets for the real thing. Absolute village, that. Dernbach sends one wide but then bangs one in short \u2013 Parnell attempts the pull but doesn't catch it cleanly. A slower delivery at 68.2mph next up, and Parnell can't pick it.</p> <!-- Block 58 --> <p><strong>WICKET! South Africa 174-6 (Parnell b Tredwell, st Kieswetter 5)</strong></p> <!-- Block 59 --> <p>Another beautiful piece of deceptive bowling from Tredwell. He really has shaken off that earlier disappointment in the slips. The left-hander Parnell is tempted out of his crease and attempts the off-drive, missing the ball as it spins away then and hearing the fatal sound of glove on bail.</p> <!-- Block 60 --> <p><strong>44th over: South Africa 176-6 (Elgar 26, Peterson 1)</strong> Peterson, another left-hander, to face Tredwell now. A complete mix up between the wickets! Peterson plays a forward defensive, begins to run before getting halfway and being sent back by Elgar. It looked like suicide as Kieswetter raced out to pick up the ball, but his throw back to the stumps was poor and Jimmy Anderson couldn't quite reach it low down. Peterson lives to fight another day, but that was terrible cricket all round!</p> <!-- Block 61 --> <p><strong>45th over: South Africa 178-6 (Elgar 28, Peterson 1)</strong> Dernbach is causing Elgar all sorts of trouble. The South African can barely get the ball off the square. Just as I say that he drives one through the off side and Ian Bell has to scamper across the point boundary to save the four. Half-hearted appeals for lbw as the ball hits Elgar on the knee-roll, but always too high that. Two from the over.</p> <!-- Block 62 --> <p><strong>46th over: South Africa 189-6 (Elgar 28, Peterson 12)</strong> A four! A four I say! Peterson reverse sweeps Tredwell down to the third man boundary and brings up a much needed boundary. A six! A six I say! Next up Peterson launches one over the ropes through mid-wicket! This is more like it from South Africa, as Peterson switches hands again and chips one over his leg side, it's in the air...but just short of Bell! Expensive over.</p> <!-- Block 63 --> <p><strong>47th over: South Africa 198-6 (Elgar 34, Peterson 15)</strong> England know Elgar and Peterson are trying to hit big, so they counter their attacking with solid line and length. Alastair Cook takes the slip out and it's more of a defensive field now for England. He can't prevent a four from the next delivery, though, as Edgar lifts one to the long-on boundary. Slower, fuller ball to finish and South Africa take a quick single. Three overs remaining.</p> <!-- Block 64 --> <p><strong>48th over: South Africa 209-6 (Elgar 35, Peterson 25)</strong> Dernbach is beginning to concede a few runs as Elgar and Peterson both find the boundary. Nine from the first three deliveries, but just one from the next two, that's a bit better from England's point of view. And it's just a single from the final ball of the over.</p> <!-- Block 65 --> <p><strong>48.5 overs: South Africa 214-6 (Elgar 35, Peterson 29)</strong> Finn from the Pavilion End now and Peterson flashes his blade at a short ball, that runs quickly all the way down to the third-man boundary. He's played a crucial role at the end of this innings and this is getting away from England a wee bit at the death. Peterson takes a single as the ball thumps his pads, and Elgar can't score off the next ball.</p> <!-- Block 66 --> <p><strong>WICKET! South Africa 214-7 (Edgar b Finn, c Kieswetter 35)</strong></p> <!-- Block 67 --> <p>Edgar gloves a short one behind to Kieswetter, and to be honest, he hasn't really looked settled all innings.</p> <!-- Block 68 --> <p><strong>WICKET! South Africa 215-8 (McLaren, run out, Dernbach, 1)</strong></p> <!-- Block 69 --> <p>Finally a bit of joy for England in the field! McLaren hit one onto his pads with his first ball, ran the single, but then unselfishly tried to get back for the second, only for Dernbach to produce a direct hit!</p> <!-- Block 70 --> <p><strong>50 overs: South Africa 220-8 (Peterson 31, Steyn 3)</strong> So a tight final over from Dernbach means South Africa finish with a score of 220. Steyn misses a slower ball and almost attempts a ludicrous single, only to think better of it. He does get two off the last delivery, though, with Kieswetter missing a run-out opportunity.</p> <!-- Block 71 --> <p><strong>South Africa: 220-8 after 50 overs. Changeover.</strong></p> <!-- Block 72 --> <p>Let's have a few views on that first innings please. Email me in your droves.</p> <!-- Block 73 --> <p><strong>James Debens:</strong> \"I was just wondering why Bairstow isn't playing? For all his bowling success, I don't have a lot of faith in Ravibop's batting.\"</p> <p>Indeed, his batting isn't the best, but did that earlier spell with the ball justify his selection?</p> <!-- Block 74 --> <p><strong>John Starbuck:</strong> \"James, It looks like England know what they're doing with this SA batting line-up, who might have expected to get 250 at least. Again. Some luck, good and bad, and they need to work harder on catching drills using different combinations, but you'd say England have the upper hand. Let's see if the batsmen can do the right thing, too.\"</p> <!-- Block 75 --> <p>The teams are out for the second innings. 221 to win for England and Steyn to open the bowling...</p> <!-- Block 76 --> <p><strong>0.5 overs: England 2-0 (Cook 2, Bell 0)</strong> Cook gets England off the mark with a cut that flies wide of point, and he comes back for two. Remember that Morkel isn't in this South Africa side, surely that's to the detriment of South Africa. Cook leaves one just outside the line of off stump, corr blimey, that was close to his off peg though! Only a few centimetres in it I reckon! Great judgement, or extremely lucky?</p> <!-- Block 77 --> <p><strong>WICKET! England 2-1 (Cook lbw b Steyn, 2)</strong></p> <!-- Block 78 --> <p>Oh dear oh dear. Steyn gets one to nip back in and that's plumb, going on to hit Cook's off stump, no review needed. Terrible start for England!</p> <!-- Block 79 --> <p><strong>2nd over: England 5-1 (Bell 0, Trott 0)</strong> Tsotsobe takes the next over and England are already on the ropes. However, he doesn't put the home side under any real pressure, a few looseners and byes conceded. Bell is beaten by one, the ball flying across the right-hander, before trying to chop one through point, but thwarted by the fielder.</p> <p><strong>Bernard Walsh:</strong> \"James, am I the only one who thinks that England's bowling attack since they left Bresnan out of the team looks 30% more effective? With Finn's pace and bounce, Anderson's swing, Dernbach's slower ball medley, Bopara's swinging dobbers and decent spin from Patel and Treadwell there's no obvious weak link. As a club player myself I'm not overly keen on facing any of these types of bowling but usually fill my boots against the straight up and down medium fast bowlers like Bresnan who come on to the bat at a nice speed without offering intimidating pace or swing. Bresnan has done OK against other teams but the South Africans have feasted on his bowling in all formats and I suspect the Indians will relish facing this type of bowling in home conditions. 220 looks about 30 below par to me and I expect England to win, hopefully they won't grind their way there but we'll enjoy some entertaining strokeplay from Morgan.\"</p> <!-- Block 80 --> <p><strong>3rd over: England 10-1 (Bell 0, Trott 4)</strong> Steyn is a formidable bowler. He's sending bombs down at 90mph plus and at the moment England are struggling to get to grips with him. He beats Trott's outside edge before a short one forces him to duck out of the way. What would have been the final delivery of the over slips down the leg side, though, for a wide. Trott punishes him with a cover drive that runs up the hill for four, the ball flying off the bat there!</p> <!-- Block 81 --> <p><strong>4th over: England 15-1 (Bell 1, Trott 5)</strong> Tsotsobe looked to be keeping it tight in his second over, but then he sends a wild ball down that is wide, even on the off side. Bell dabs one out to point and gets off the mark before Trott cuts one to wide third man.</p> <p><strong>Gary Naylor:</strong> \"SA suffered a bit from not knowing whether to go for 280 or 240. Every time they tried to get the scoring rate up, they lost a wicket until Peterson's shenanigans at the end. Had they gone for 240, they might have got it and, in these conditions, that's a good score. 220 is at least ten short and England know they can afford to rebuild their innings a couple of times at least.\"</p> <!-- Block 82 --> <p><strong>5th over: England 17-1 (Bell 2, Trott 6)</strong> Steyn's pace has just dropped a tad. But when I say dropped, he is still wanging them down at around 88mph. I wouldn't want to be facing him, that's for sure. Trott attempts a pull to an aggressive short ball but it comes on to him too quickly and doesn't even get off the square, falling short of mid-off! That could have gone anywhere.</p> <!-- Block 83 --> <p><strong>6th over: England 21-1 (Bell 5, Trott 7)</strong> McLaren comes into the attack for South Africa, replacing Tsotsobe. Bell skips down the pitch and pulls one well through the leg side, it won't go for four, but that's a good two. McLaren then beats his edge with the next delivery, an instant response from the bowler.</p> <p><strong>Simon McMahon</strong>: \"Consensus seems to be SA are a few runs short, James, but their bowlers could have enough to keep it interesting. Might be a close finish. Or might not. Howzaaaaaaaat for penetrating analysis?\"</p> <p>Not out</p> <!-- Block 84 --> <p><strong>7th over: England 22-1 (Bell 5, Trott 8)</strong> An 88mph leg break from Steyn, beating Trott comprehensively! Trott does a bit of gardening with the pitch but he needs to forget about that quickly, and he leaves the next two outside off stump. He then strangely plays outside one that cut back a wee bit down the hill. Steyn is flying at the moment, he's almost unplayable! A short one is fired down and Trott gets a glove on it and sprints to the non-striker's end as quickly as he can!</p> <!-- Block 85 --> <p>Jonathan Trott is in a bit of pain after that blow on the hand from Steyn, and he's receiving a bit of treatment.</p> <!-- Block 86 --> <p><strong>8th over: England 31-1 (Bell 7, Trott 13)</strong> Trott dusts himself down and gets back into the zone after that knock. He looks to be OK and he clips McLaren off his legs, through mid-wicket for four. He is still struggling with his hand, however, as McLaren gives away two wides in succession, one on the off side and another down leg. Bell then fends a short one off his hips for a couple and this is looking like an expensive over all of a sudden.</p> <!-- Block 87 --> <p><strong>9th over: England 37-1 (Bell 7, Trott 17)</strong> Trott gobbles down a couple of pain killers and will be hoping they take effect pretty sharpish. Tsotsobe comes back into the attack and beats Trott's outside edge a few times. I think Trott is really struggling out there and isn't concentrating on the ball 100%. Understandable if you're hand is swelling and you're trying to face a quicky. But he regains his composure and guides the ball to the boundary, square on the off side, lovely shot. Tsotsobe sends a wide down, even though it was very close to Trott's leg stump.</p> <!-- Block 88 --> <p><strong>10th over: England 42-1 (Bell 11, Trott 18)</strong> Trott guides McLaren's short delivery down to third man for a single, handing Bell the strike. And just as I was about to wonder if Bell was struggling to get his eye in, he expertly pulls a tame short ball through the leg side for four. Excellent shot.</p> <p><strong>Adam Czarnowski:</strong> \"James. As Mikey Holding just said of the Proteas, we've also weakened our team with some \"bits and pieces\" cricketers, Little Bo Para and the dreary, uninspiring Patel, to name but two. This and the depressing dropped catches made me think of Bob Willis priceless \"England have clambered back into the treacle-tin of their own mediocrity.\" Come back KP, all is forgiven?\"</p> <!-- Block 89 --> <p><strong>11th over: England 45-1 (Bell 12, Trott 20)</strong> Bell is using his feet really well and moving down the wicket wherever possible. He swipes one from Tsotsobe to the mid-wicket boundary before clipping a shot off his legs to the same man in the outfield. He's beginning to see the ball pretty big now I reckon.</p> <!-- Block 90 --> <p><strong>12th over: England 47-1 (Bell 13, Trott 21)</strong> Elgar, the left-arm spinner, is now brought into the South African attack. It's a strong start from him and just two off the over.</p> <p><strong>Scott Poynting:</strong> \"Re 9th over, isn't Trott taking painkillers under the circumstances using a performance enhancing drug? Perhaps he should have taken a leaf from Shane Warne's book and got them from his mum!\"</p> <p>I suppose they are helping his performance, aye! But I'm sure we can let him off this one.</p> <!-- Block 91 --> <p><strong>13th over: England 48-1 (Bell 13, Trott 21)</strong> Trott is really struggling out there, he takes off his glove and is massaging his finger to relieve the pain. Tsotsobe bangs a short one in and Trott ducks out of the way. You do wonder if he is going to retire hurt, get some ice on it and come out again later in the innings if required. Even anodyne deliveries are causing him problems.</p> <!-- Block 92 --> <p><strong>14th over: England 55-1 (Bell 16, Trott 23)</strong> Elgar strolls up to the crease again and Bell attempts a tickle down the leg side, Smith and De Villiers move to early and expect him to make the shot, but the ball beats everyone and runs down to the boundary, where Tsotsobe prevents it crossing the rope. The 50 partnership is brought up and that's a fine effort from these two after Cook's early dismissal.</p> <!-- Block 93 --> <p><strong>15th over: England 58-1 (Bell 19, Trott 23)</strong> Parnell steaming in and Bell can't score off the first three balls of the over. A shorter one next up though and Bell pulls it behind square, it's in the air, but safe and a good shot. I'm sure Trott will be grateful that he didn't have to face a ball in that over and Bell runs a single on the last, some more respite for his hand injury.</p> <!-- Block 94 --> <p><strong>16th over: England 61-1 (Bell 21, Trott 24)</strong> Peterson comes in for an over and brings the run-rate down a tad with some slow and tight bowling, drifting the ball into the right-handers. Soft hands from Bell, nudging the ball past slip for a single.</p> <p>Two cracking lines from <strong>Adam Czarnowski:</strong></p> <p>\"James, Elgar, the SA spinner, has some interesting variations, though no Enigmas thus far.\"</p> <p>\"Trott needs Anadin deliveries, not anodyne ones, surely?\"</p> <p>Wonderful Adam, just wonderful.</p> <!-- Block 95 --> <p>Drinks break</p> <!-- Block 96 --> <p><strong>17th over: England 71-1 (Bell 29, Trott 24)</strong> Two quick fours from Bell and he's cantering along nicely now. First he cuts one fine down to the third man boundary before smashing an exquisite drive through the covers. That raced to the rope. He is a wonderful player, Bell, once he gets into the groove. And he seems to have rattled Parnell, who steps over the line for a no ball, and again with his next delivery! Oh dear.</p> <p>Scathing reply from <strong>Josh Robinson:</strong> \"Afternoon Riach, afternoon everybody. Impressive as Adam Czarnowski's line was, the Elgar-Enigma Variations comment would be more impressive if it wasn't it self a variation on something that David Gower used it on Sky a few games ago. Before that it had already been used on Test Match Sofa, probably on the other TMS as well. I imagine it was also sent to the OBO, but I don't know if Smyth was ever so desperate as to publish it.\"</p> <!-- Block 97 --> <p><strong>18th over: England 73-1 (Bell 30, Trott 25)</strong> Poor communication between Trott and Bell but they get away with it, scampering for a quick single with De Villiers knocking the bails off in frustration rather than hope. Two from Peterson's over and he's having a good little spell.</p> <!-- Block 98 --> <p><strong>19th over: England 80-1 (Bell 35, Trott 26)</strong> It's looking very comfortable for England at the moment. Parnell needs a strong over but Bell again advances down the pitch and slashes one over the covers for four. A single off the next delivery, good running from the batsmen after Steyn had slightly misfielded at mid-off.</p> <p><strong>Phil Russell:</strong> \"I think all this complaining about weak Elgar puns is a bit pompous, given the circumstances...\"</p> <p>Oh yes</p> <!-- Block 99 --> <p><strong>20th over: England 88-1 (Bell 42, Trott 27)</strong> Peterson again with his left-arm spin now, it's steady stuff but all of the sudden Bell skips down, opens the face of the bat and drives one through the off side for six, hitting the boundary line on the full! Wonderful shot!</p> <p>Right that's all from me folks, Simon Burnton takes up the mantle and will guide you through to the close.</p> <!-- Block 100 --> <p><strong>21st over: England 90-1 (Bell 42, Trott 28)</strong> Hello everyone. I might as well lay my cards on the table: I got back from a fortnight in the south of France yesterday, had thought about little other than the Olympics for a couple of months before that, and have spent most of this afternoon watching football. Anyway, just two runs off that McLaren over, one of them a wide.</p> <!-- Block 101 --> <p><strong>22nd over: England 95-1 (Bell 42, Trott 32)</strong> Five from Peterson's over, and England are proceeding serenely towards their target, with Cook's early dismissal an ever more distant and irrelevant memory. Of course, it could all change...</p> <!-- Block 102 --> <p><strong>23rd over: England 102-1 (Bell 44, Trott 37)</strong> Two poor deliveries in McLaren's first six \u2013 one a bouncer that flies a yard and a half over Trott's head for a wide, and the other a loose ball that Bell thunders it away for ... a single, straight to Amla. The seventh delivery is scooped away, in the air but perfectly safe, for four by Trott.</p> <!-- Block 103 --> <p><strong>24th over: England 102-1 (Bell 44, Trott 37)</strong> A maiden over, played with very little aggression by an utterly relaxed Bell. Southampton celebrate by going 1-0 up against Manchester United, provoking a loud exclamation of \"GOAL!\" around Guardian HQ.</p> <!-- Block 104 --> <p><strong>25th over: England 109-1 (Bell 49, Trott 39)</strong> Steyn returns, and with his second ball he finds Bell's edge. It flies through the massive gap between De Villiers and first slip, neither of whom moves, and away for four.</p> <!-- Block 105 --> <p><strong>26th over: England 110-1 (Bell 49, Trott 40)</strong> That's one run from the last two Pieterson overs, in which Bell has faced 11 balls without scoring.</p> <!-- Block 106 --> <p><strong>27th over: England 114-1 (Bell 51, Trott 41)</strong> Bell dabs the ball to third man to bring up his half-century, and mistimes a pull for a last-ball single.</p> <!-- Block 107 --> <p><strong>28th over: England 118-1 (Bell 55, Trott 42)</strong> Parnell, the most expensive of South Africa's bowlers so far, attempts a fourth over. Just four runs off the over. \"One reason for Bell doing well in the shorter game is that, after being dropped for the West Indies performances, when he came back into the side we could see he'd obviously done a lot of gym work,\" writes John Starbuck. \"His shoulders and arms were massive compared with his earlier physique, so he could wield the now-requisite heavy bat so much better. The streaky shots converted into fours from light touches make a huge difference.\"</p> <!-- Block 108 --> <p><strong>29th over: England 127-1 (Bell 63, Trott 43)</strong> Tsotsobe, the least expensive of South Africa's bowlers so far, follows him and concedes nine. Bell impresses with a hefty four sent back over the bowler's head, but flirts with a run-out by attempting a risky two \u2013 a decent throw would have left him a yard and a half short of the crease. The throw is rubbish.</p> <!-- Block 109 --> <p><strong>30th over: England 132-1 (Bell 65, Trott 46)</strong> Elgar, now South Africa's most economical bowler after Tsotsobe's ugly previous over, has a go. Five singles are the result.</p> <!-- Block 110 --> <p><strong>31st over: England 141-1 (Bell 73, Trott 47)</strong> Bell is dropped! He tries to drive the ball over mid on, but doesn't get enough on it. Peterson seems to misjudge the flight of the ball, realising too late quite how high it is, and though his hands shoot upwards he never looks like holding it, and indeed doesn't. The next ball, with an air of inevitability, is violently dispatched over midwicket for four. The last is an attempted six hit back down the ground that falls six yards short, but without a fielder within shouting distance.</p> <!-- Block 111 --> <p><strong>WICKET! England 143-2 (Trott lbw b Elgar, 48)</strong> South Africa finally make a breakthrough, thanks to a review \u2013 Trott, given not out initially, is actually plumb. Given the way the match is going, and the fact that he's nursing an injured hand, it's no disaster.</p> <!-- Block 112 --> <p><strong>32nd over: England 143-2 (Bell 74, Bopara 0)</strong> So the question was, how long can Trott bat through injury. And the question now is, can Bopara rediscover some form?</p> <!-- Block 113 --> <p><strong>33rd over: England 148-2 (Bell 79, Bopara 0)</strong> Tsotsobe's third ball is dirt poor, all but demanding that Bell taps it down to long leg for four, which he does. A single off the following delivery leaves Bopara with two deliveries to face. The first he only just manages to pull away from in time, after initially being tempted into a half-hearted prod. The second he defends reasonably well.</p> <!-- Block 114 --> <p><strong>34th over: England 150-2 (Bell 80, Bopara 1)</strong> Elgar continues, and the batsmen take a run each. I've been tortured all afternoon by the knowledge that, just yards from the office where I am toiling, there is an ice cream festival taking place. An ice cream festival. A festival of ice cream. In just 55 minutes it will close, and my torture will be over.</p> <!-- Block 115 --> <p><strong>34.1 overs: England 150-2 (Bell 80, Bopara 1)</strong> It's raining, and the players have been called in.</p> <!-- Block 116 --> <p><strong>Rain delay</strong> If it doesn't stop raining \u2013 and the forecast is that it will, quite soon \u2013 England will win on the Duckworth-Lewis method.</p> <!-- Block 117 --> <p><strong>It's stopped raining!</strong> And the players are making their way back out.</p> <!-- Block 118 --> <p><strong>35th over: England 155-2 (Bell 80, Bopara 6)</strong> Some more poor fielding, from Tsotsobe, allows Bopara's pull to bounce away for four. We're told that Trott will have an X-ray on his hand, though not until tomorrow.</p> <!-- Block 119 --> <p><strong>WICKET! England 156-3 (Bopara c De Villiers b McLaren, 6)</strong> Nope, Bopara's run of poor form is not over. He brushes a ball he could have left straight through to the keeper, and now some nerves could surface for England. Enter Morgan.</p> <!-- Block 120 --> <p><strong>36th over: England 157-3 (Bell 80, Morgan 0)</strong> Another wicket soonish and this could be interesting. They haven't given up \u2013 McLaren's first ball to Morgan is played in short and only just evades the bat on its way through to the keeper.</p> <!-- Block 121 --> <p><strong>37th over: England 159-3 (Bell 81, Morgan 2)</strong> Steyn's eighth over, and England get a couple of singles off it. The last ball skids over Morgan's head as he takes a wild swing at it. We could have a fun few overs ahead, if that's going to be his attitude.</p> <!-- Block 122 --> <p><strong>38th over: England 167-3 (Bell 82, Morgan 9)</strong> Morgan's first boundary is a classy straight drive that disappears off his bat, and McLaren's next delivery pootles through mid off for three. He looks in good touch.</p> <!-- Block 123 --> <p><strong>39th over: England 170-3 (Bell 82, Morgan 12)</strong> Injury update: Trott, pictured on the balcony, isn't too injured to hold a cup of tea. Three runs from Parnell's over, all of them scored by Morgan.</p> <!-- Block 124 --> <p><strong>40th over: England 173-3 (Bell 83, Morgan 13)</strong> Three runs off the over, one of them a wide, and England's target is now less than 50 runs away. This is an ODI disguised as a Test. The run rate is low, and doesn't have to get higher. The excitement rate is low, and mightn't get much higher either. England still seem in control, and only the dismissal of Bell sometime soon can change that.</p> <!-- Block 125 --> <p><strong>41st over: England 176-3 (Bell 85, Morgan 13)</strong> Parnell bowls a full toss, and Bell swings and misses, blinking his eyes to suggest that he didn't see the ball at all. Fortunately it flies six inches wide of the off stump, and Bell recovers to score three off the remaining balls.</p> <!-- Block 126 --> <p><strong>42nd over: England 182-3 (Bell 87, Morgan 18)</strong> The highlight of Peterson's over is Morgan's brilliantly controlled pull for four. Six runs come from the over in all; the required run rate is 4.875.</p> <!-- Block 127 --> <p><strong>43rd over: England 186-3 (Bell 88, Morgan 21)</strong> This is as comfortable as an old pair of slippers or a brand new baby snow goose down duvet. It's as relaxed as a Usain Bolt v obese British under-sixes 200m sprint. Can anything change the direction of this match now? England need 35 to win.</p> <!-- Block 128 --> <p><strong>WICKET! England 186-4 (Bell c De Villiers b Steyn 88)</strong> Maybe! An excellent innings from Bell ends with a top edge that De Villiers collects one-handed, leaping.</p> <!-- Block 129 --> <p><strong>44th over: England 189-4 (Morgan 24, Kieswetter 1)</strong> Steyn makes the breakthrough that South Africa had been so desperate for, but with six overs and 32 runs to go, is it too late? As Simon McMahon boasts: \"My prediction earlier that we might, or might not, see a close finish is beginning to look rather prescient, no? Call me mad, but I'm standing by it. That's how I roll.\" Go on, stick your neck out.</p> <!-- Block 130 --> <p><strong>45th over: England 195-4 (Morgan 24, Kieswetter 5). England need 26 to win off 30 balls</strong> A brilliantly-timed drive from Kieswetter brings a boundary from the first ball of the over, and only an excellent diving stop from Amla stops Morgan emulating him two balls later. Kieswetter ends the over considerably less impressively than he started it, though, with a swing and a miss.</p> <!-- Block 131 --> <p><strong>46th over: England 207-4 (Morgan 36, Kieswetter 5). England need 14 to win off 24 balls</strong> Instead of sticking with Steyn and searching for wickets, South Africa go with McLaren and his second ball is slow but read by Morgan and tickled away for four. He relaxes for a couple of balls and then hoicks the next over long on for a one-bounce four, and swings at the last, with even a poor contact being enough to send the ball to the boundary. Twelve runs off the over, all of them boundaries, and this match is surely over.</p> <!-- Block 132 --> <p><strong>ENGLAND WIN BY SIX WICKETS! 46.4 overs: England 224-4 (Morgan 36, Kieswetter 21)</strong> Now South Africa do turn to Steyn, and it doesn't go well at all. <em>Not at all</em>. Kieswetter thumps his first delivery through mid wicket for four. The next is called wide, and after that Kieswetter takes a couple of steps and flukily top-edges the ball for another four. That leaves England needing three, and the next ball is thumped mightily back over the bowler's head and away for six to win it.</p> <!-- Block 133 --> <p><strong>England will end 2012 as the world's No1 ODI team! </strong>After that they go to India, so they should probably enjoy it while it lasts. The fielding wasn't great, but every batsman but the unlucky Cook, who got a good ball early, and Bopara, who is out of touch and looked it, impressed.</p>",
  "<!-- Block 1 --> <p>1.00pm: <strong>Hello world! </strong>So, Liverpool and Arsenal. Arsenal and Liverpool. Any fan of English football will have a head full of memories of these encounters, but here is a brief historical synopsis:</p> <!-- Block 2 --> <p>Yadda yadda yadda yadda yadda yadda yadda yadda yadda yadda yadda yadda yadda <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jiBIdtUKhs\">Michael Thomas</a> yadda yadda yadda yadda yadda yadda yadda yadda yadda yadda yadda Michael Owen yadda yadda <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-fCY4jUN_s\">2001 FA Cup final</a> yadda yadda yadda yadda yadda yadda <a href=\"http://www.dailymotion.com/video/xwve5_ian-rush-in-501-liverpool-goals_sport\">Ian Rush</a> yadda yadda yadda <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kP11UGjICCI\">until the 1987 League Cup final</a> yadda yadda yadda yadda yadda from <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXHEtpT3UL4\">Robbie Fowler's four-minute hat-trick</a> to <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLV-65aenrM\">Andriy Arshavin's four-goal blast</a> yadda yadda yadda yadda Jimmy Carter for \u00a3500,000 yadda yadda yadda <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELGFxWt7Ej0\">Charlie George's dramatic 1971 FA Cup final clincher</a>.</p> <p>There, I think that just about covers it, don't you? Though completists might want to read <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2012/mar/02/joy-of-six-liverpool-arsenal\">this Joy of Six</a> from just a few months ago.</p> <!-- Block 3 --> <p>1.03pm: The teams are in, and they look quite a bit like this. You'll notice a Liverpool debut for Nuri Sahin, who snubbed Arsenal in favour of Anfield in the summer, with Daniel Agger and Jos\u00e9 Enrique returning to the starting line-up. Arsenal start with Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, and leave Theo Walcott on the bench.<br><strong>Liverpool:</strong> Reina, Johnson, Skrtel, Agger, Jose Enrique, Gerrard, Allen, Sahin, Borini, Su\u00e1rez, Sterling. <strong>Subs: </strong>Jones, Henderson, Coates, Downing, Carragher, Shelvey, Kelly. <br><strong>Arsenal:</strong> Mannone, Jenkinson, Mertesacker, Vermaelen, Gibbs, Diaby, Arteta, Oxlade-Chamberlain, Cazorla, Podolski, Giroud. <strong>Subs:</strong> Martinez, Koscielny, Andre Santos, Walcott, Ramsey, Coquelin, Gervinho. <br><strong>Referee:</strong> Howard Webb.</p> <!-- Block 4 --> <p>1.04pm: This from @OptaJoe on Twitter:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>1 - Liverpool have won just one of their last 10 Premier League games against Arsenal (W1 D6 L3). Outgunned.</p> </blockquote> <!-- Block 5 --> <p>1.14pm: \"Given the almost universally accepted received wisdom that it's better to stick with a manager than to twist, the current situations of these two clubs suggest that the two approaches may not produce wildly different results,\" writes Gary Naylor. \"Okay, Arsenal are in the Champions League, but they look as far away from a trophy as ever over the last five years and Liverpool did win one last year and go to the final of another.\" If the only trophies that count are the league and the Champions League these teams have taken different routes to the same position, namely nowhere near winning either of them, without being a total irrelevance.</p> <!-- Block 6 --> <p>1.18pm: William Hill are offering 7/5 against Arsenal failing to score a goal again today \u2013 their fans are yet to enjoy a goal this season, in either net. Match betting: 23/20 Liverpool; 12/5 Arsenal; 23/10 Draw.</p> <!-- Block 7 --> <p>1.24pm: Get my excuses in first dept: how am I supposed to concentrate on football when there's an <a href=\"http://www.kingscrossevents.co.uk/events/kings-cross-ice-cream-festival/\">ice cream festival</a> \u2013 a <em>festival</em> of <em>ice cream</em> \u2013 taking place over the road? It looks like a rocky road ahead for me.</p> <!-- Block 8 --> <p>1.27pm: As @chipsandlager points out via Twitter, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlZhHVtDhRw\">Sahin and Lucas Podolski have a bit of handbag-based history</a>. Best keep my eyes on them...</p> <!-- Block 9 --> <p>1.28pm: The crowd are currently not walking alone. Kick-off is imminent.</p> <!-- Block 10 --> <p><strong>1 min:</strong> Peeeeeep! We're off!</p> <!-- Block 11 --> <p><strong>1 min: </strong>Liverpool kick off, going from right to left as the TV cameras look at it, and immediately give the back four a bit of stroke-it-about time, which a bit of closing down later becomes hoof-it-clear time rather quickly.</p> <!-- Block 12 --> <p><strong>4 min:</strong> It's Arsenal keeping the ball more impressively at the moment, working it rather well around midfield even if they never looked sure what was going to happen next. A Liverpool interception, was the answer.</p> <!-- Block 13 --> <p><strong>5 mins:</strong> Borini picks the ball up on the half-way line and advances with intent. By the time he's 25 yards from goal, and still hasn't been closed down, he reckons it would be rude not to shoot, and the ball zips low and wide.</p> <!-- Block 14 --> <p><strong>6 mins:</strong> Suarez takes the ball past Mertesacker and is pulled back, 30 yards from goal. The German is booked.</p> <!-- Block 15 --> <p><strong>7 mins:</strong> Su\u00e1rez slams the free-kick well over the bar.</p> <!-- Block 16 --> <p><strong>9 mins:</strong> Borini dwells on the ball, attracting several defenders, and then pokes it through to Glen Johnson, who is prevented from sprinting clear by the offside flag.</p> <!-- Block 17 --> <p><strong>10 mins:</strong> A frantic start from Liverpool. Raheem Sterling slips away from trouble on the half-way line and the ball is worked right to Borini, whose shot flies wide of the near post.</p> <!-- Block 18 --> <p><strong>12 mins:</strong> Cazorla has Arsenal's first shot, not a particularly dangerous one, that trundles into Reina's arms.</p> <!-- Block 19 --> <p><strong>13 mins:</strong> Gerrard drives in a corner, and Agger is unmarked as he rises to ... um ... totally miss the header.</p> <!-- Block 20 --> <p><strong>17 mins: </strong>\"Vito Mannone I have heard of, though I only vaguely know the Gunners. Is Martinez on the bench also a keeper? What happened to Szcsczzcsezcszcsczzcsny?\" asks Rob Moline. Wojciech Szczesny is indeed injured, and Damian Mart\u00ednez is indeed a goalkeeper \u2013 an Argentinian celebrating his 20th birthday today. So is my mum, incidentally (she's not 20, but it is her birthday). Happy birthday mum! And you too, Damian!</p> <!-- Block 21 --> <p><strong>18 mins:</strong> Liverpool attempt Rodgers' patented tap-tapping play out of defence, the move breaking down when the ball reaches Su\u00e1rez, who you would have thought would be quite good at the close-passing thing. A few seconds later, Vermaelen attempts an ambitious shot from very great distance which goes nowhere near the goal.</p> <!-- Block 22 --> <p><strong>23 mins:</strong> Liverpool break after Sahin's lovely backheel interception, and Su\u00e1rez finds half a pitch of space, but Gerrard's pass is too lofted and slightly overhit, and by the time it has been controlled Su\u00e1rez is so wide, and so many defenders have got back, that the threat is swiftly snuffed out.</p> <!-- Block 23 --> <p><strong>26 mins:</strong> Mertesacker gives the ball to Sterling, whose sprint towards the penalty area is ended when Arteta connects with his ankle. The Spaniard is booked, and Liverpool have another well-placed free-kick.</p> <!-- Block 24 --> <p><strong>28 mins:</strong> Su\u00e1rez taps the ball for Gerrard to hit, but the ball flies only into the legs of an advancing defender, and Gerrard angrily demonstrates to the Uruguayan where he actually wanted the ball.</p> <!-- Block 25 --> <p><strong>GOOOOAAALLL! Liverpool 0 Arsenal 1 (Podolski, 31 mins)</strong> Steven Gerrard gives the ball away in midfield. It's immediately worked to Cazorla, who carries it towards the penalty area before sliding in Podolski, who finishes calmly.</p> <!-- Block 26 --> <p><strong>34 mins: </strong>Self-confessed \"heretic scouser\" Paul Ewart writes: \"Stevie G needs to go. Three misplaced passes, three goals in three games. He simply does not get possession football.\"</p> <!-- Block 27 --> <p><strong>36 mins:</strong> Moments before the goal I was merrily polishing off an update about Liverpool being marginally the better of two not truly convincing teams thus far. Sterling is playing rather well.</p> <!-- Block 28 --> <p><strong>38 mins: </strong>Liverpool hit the post! Gerrard overhits another pass, though Borini does brilliantly to stop the ball from going out for a goal kick, volleying it high back into the centre. When it finally drops, Sterling takes it and slams it with his left foot, scraping the outside of the near post. \"Strolling through the TV listings last night I noted that TV Guide calls Green Acres 'a popular, broadly played hoot about a city couple enjoying life down on the farm,'\" writes Paul Taylor. \" What a great description: 'A broadly played hoot'. Remind you a Wenger presser, perhaps? For me, sadly, it sounds like my own life story.\" For me, a \"broadly played hoot\" sounds a bit like a Madonna clarinet solo.</p> <!-- Block 29 --> <p><strong>40 mins: </strong>Sterling goes down in the penalty area under Mertesacker's challenge. There's a loud appeal from the fans, but Howard Webb is not impressed.</p> <!-- Block 30 --> <p><strong>41 mins:</strong> Another shocking miss from Giroud! Arsenal break again, through Diaby, who is allowed to carry the ball a horrific distance without challenge before sliding it into the path of Giroud. From almost exactly the spot where Podolski scored the Frenchman \u2013 who to be fair is running across goal rather than towards it \u2013 spears his shot very convincingly wide.</p> <!-- Block 31 --> <p><strong>45 mins:</strong> We'll have two minutes of stoppage time here, in which Liverpool will continue to work the ball optimistically towards Arsenal's penalty area. Anyway, here's Ryan Dunne's personal all-time favourite TV listings moment: \"Personally, I'm fond of (as well as the unhinged missives in the 'You Say' bit) the Sunday Times' description of Tim Burton's rubbish Planet of the Apes remake: 'Gorillas to be missed.'\"</p> <!-- Block 32 --> <p><strong>45+2 mins: </strong>Peeeeeep! It's half-time! And Liverpool look like a good team without a striker. Funny that.</p> <!-- Block 33 --> <p><strong>Half-time: </strong>An entertaining game, played at a familiarly frantic pace. Liverpool are doing OK, but Gerrard and Su\u00e1rez are not, and they lack cutting edge. Arsenal are counter-attacking excellently when they get the opportunity, with Cazorla and, yes, Diaby excelling. Still all to play for.</p> <!-- Block 34 --> <p><strong>46 mins:</strong> Peeeeeeeep! We're off! Again!</p> <!-- Block 35 --> <p><strong>47 mins:</strong> Martin Skrtel is booked for a foul from behind on Abou Diaby.</p> <!-- Block 36 --> <p><strong>49 mins:</strong> In the first half Joe Allen succeeded with every one of his 39 passes. Olivier Giroud, meanwhile, found a team-mate with none of his six.</p> <!-- Block 37 --> <p><strong>51 mins:</strong> Gerrard slides a lovely ball into the penalty area from the right, and Su\u00e1rez would surely have got to it first had he not collapsed under pressure from Mertesacker. To me it looked like a penalty \u2013 he did appear to be pushed \u2013 but it wasn't a certainty, and a decent penalty shout is not as good as a very clear goalscoring opportunity, which is what he'd have had if he stayed on his feet.</p> <!-- Block 38 --> <p><strong>54 mins:</strong> Liverpool replace Borini with Stewart Downing.</p> <!-- Block 39 --> <p><strong>55 mins:</strong> Another Liverpool penalty shout, as Vermaelen falls over and accidentally punches the ball as he lands. Liverpool seem to think, not entirely unreasonably, that the person most likely to craft a clear goalscoring opportunity for them is Howard Webb.</p> <!-- Block 40 --> <p><strong>58 mins: </strong>Liverpool find Su\u00e1rez in plenty of space on the right edge of the penalty area. His shot is very hard but very central, and is palmed over. \"Since everyone seems to be getting aboard the Gerrard now crap bus I thought I might as well add my two cents and say that Stevie G was possibly never the awesome footballer he was made out to be, in fact he was constantly shown up as a tactically unaware and positionally clueless by Alonso, who not only had a better footballing brain but was a better ball winner and better passer,\" writes David Flynn. \"Where Gerrard made up for all this was that A - he was English, B - he was a Liverpool lad captaining Liverpool and most importantly C - he was capable of special moments that changed games and beat teams while playing not especially well for the rest of the game. These days though, through a combination of injury, age and a manager who now values passing, possession and positioning over all else, he is no longer capable of these special moments as often as in the past and his shortcomings are becoming more and more exposed. I'd also like to preempt the naysayers and point out that if in the second half he scores a net bursting 30 yard volley, it'll only prove my point.\"</p> <!-- Block 41 --> <p><strong>61 mins: </strong>Skrtel's desperate lunging intervention stops Podolski from finding Giroud in the penalty area.</p> <!-- Block 42 --> <p><strong>62 mins: </strong> Daniel Agger stings Mannone's palms with a shot from, what, 50 yards?</p> <!-- Block 43 --> <p><strong>64 mins:</strong> Downing cuts into the penalty area from the right wing, quite nicely really, but his shot is blocked. A minute later Sterling's cross finds Downing again, at the far post, but he's not much of an, um, headerer and the ball merely flicks his forehead on its way out of play.</p> <!-- Block 44 --> <p><strong>67 mins:</strong> Crumbs, this is frustrating, and I'm not even a Liverpool fan. They are doomed to spend six months, or at least until Michael Owen signs, looking to the bench with about half an hour to play and realising there's nobody there who can make anything better. Jonjo Shelvey replaces Nuri Sahin.</p> <!-- Block 45 --> <p><strong>GOOOOAAAAALLLL! Liverpool 0 Arsenal 2 (Cazorla, 68 mins)</strong> It's all over, surely. Cazorla's shot, from a fairly acute angle to the left of goal, was low and hard but distinctly saveable. Reina got most of his body to it, but succeeded only in deflecting the ball into the roof of his own net at the near post.</p> <!-- Block 46 --> <p><strong>71 mins: </strong>It looks like Oxlade-Chamberlain, who has been moving rather gingerly of late having suffered what might have been cramp, is to be replaced by Aaron Ramsey. \"It's not been all doom &amp; gloom for Reina this week as the commentators are saying,\" writes Jonny Mac. \"It was his birthday on Friday, so that was nice.\"</p> <!-- Block 47 --> <p><strong>75 mins:</strong> Shelvey shellacks a shot well wide. Since David Flynn's anti-Gerrard rant (58 mins) I've had precisely 0 messages of support for the Liverpool captain, and perhaps 20 messages of support for David Flynn. \"As a neutral (Glorious Glasgow Rangers aside) I too think Gerrard has long been overrated,\" writes Ryan Dunne. \"This was especially true when he was being contrasted to the supposedly glory-hugging Beckham; Becks, for all his off-field exploits, still had his glory years performing excellently in a defined role (being the best crosser of the ball in the world helped). If you put Stevie G in the same side as Messi, Ronaldo and Xavi he'd still try and do everything himself, to the detriment of his team\".</p> <!-- Block 48 --> <p><strong>79 mins:</strong> Liverpool have no ideas left. Arsenal are content to play deep and limit risk, of which there is very little.</p> <!-- Block 49 --> <p><strong>81 mins:</strong> Podolski, with a goal and an assist to his name, comes off, with Andrei Santos replacing him. Liverpool win a corner as Downing's dangerous shot is deflected narrowly wide.</p> <!-- Block 50 --> <p><strong>83 mins:</strong> At the other end Arsenal win a corner of their own. Cazorla whips it in, and Giroud shoulders a very presentable chance over the bar.</p> <!-- Block 51 --> <p><strong>86 mins:</strong> Shelvey's low shot from the 18-yard line is too firmly struck for Mannone to gather, but Vermaelen clears the rebound. Downing, for those who have asked, isn't playing at left back but at right midfield.</p> <!-- Block 52 --> <p><strong>88 mins:</strong> Su\u00e1rez sends a half-chance over the bar. \"It's 1986 and Manchester United were a faded giant, they hadn't won the league for over 20 years and they were regularly deluding themselves that the odd cup run was sufficient in asserting their status as a 'big club'. They were over reliant on an, often injured, central midfielder who was England captain, and a temperamental, skilful centre forward who often struggled for goals,\" writes someone called Verve. \"To arrest that slide they appointed a man who had successfully broken up the old firm duopoly and improbably taken a small provincial team to League and European glory, a man who then went on to prove his management genius.</p> <p>\"It's 2012 and Liverpool have Brendan Rodgers, who was sacked by Reading. Good luck with that.\"</p> <!-- Block 53 --> <p><strong>90 mins:</strong> Another good shot from Shelvey, from 20-odd yards out, which is arrowing towards the top corner before Mannone intervenes. And Koscielny comes on for Vermaelen.</p> <!-- Block 54 --> <p><strong>90+2 mins:</strong> We're nearly half-way through four minutes of stoppage time.</p> <!-- Block 55 --> <p><strong>90+4 mins: </strong>Peeeeeep! It's all over!</p> <!-- Block 56 --> <p><strong>Final score:</strong> A straightforward victory in the end, and Arsenal will celebrate not just the result but their defensive solidity (even with Jenkinson in the line-up) and the integration of Podolski and Cazorla, even if Giroud continues to struggle. For Liverpool today's cloud has no silver lining. None of their established stars looked at all good today \u2013 Reina was at fault for the second goal and continues to forge a reputation for fallibility; Gerrard gave the ball away to allow Arsenal to break for the first goal, and seems unsuited to the Rodgers style; and Su\u00e1rez is a creator unhappy and uncomfortable with the role of finisher. Raheem Sterling and Joe Allen played well, but are not (yet?) matchwinners on their own. Their failure to sign a striker on or shortly before deadline day has been remarked upon a million times, and will be remarked upon a million more between now and January (at the earliest).</p>",
  "<p>Just two years after The Tree of Life \u2013 hardly more than an eye-blink in terms of his usual production-rate \u2013 Terrence Malick has returned with something which could be seen as a B-side or companion piece to that film. It is a bold and often beautiful movie, unfashionably and unironically concerned with love and God, and what will happen to us in the absence of either. To the Wonder does not quite have the mad and magnificent ambition of The Tree of Life, nor a male performance to match Brad Pitt's in that picture. Malick's visual language is much in evidence: whispered narrative, a surging orchestral score, looming, circling camerawork to accompany wordless outdoor memory sequences which often take place suffused in sunsets and lens flare. (At one stage, a character actually says: \"The sun is right in my eyes.\") And yes, it is sometimes over-familiar and on occasions comes close to self-parody.</p> <p>Malick goes unhesitatingly out on a limb and the branch creaks a bit. When To the Wonder ended, there was the now traditional storm of hissing and booing at the Venice film festival. Malick gets this treatment, while the most insipid, unadventurous movies here can fade to black and roll credits in respectful quiet. I can only say that I responded to its passion and idealism.</p> <p>It is the story of a love affair doomed to failure, or at any rate doomed never quite to succeed. Ben Affleck is Neil, a stolid, handsome American engineer who has a passionate relationship in Paris with Marina (Olga Kurylenko), a sensual free spirit. Their love achieves an almost ecstatic state of happiness when they visit Mont Saint-Michel in Normandy and are all but overwhelmed by its islanded beauty. (\"We climbed the steps to the wonder,\" recalls Marina.) Easy-going, good-natured Neil gets on just fine with Marina's 10-year-old daughter from a previous relationship and offers to bring them over to live with him in picket-fence middle America. But transplanted to the US, their relationship begins to go wrong and Neil becomes aware of a childhood friend, Jane (Rachel McAdams). In parallel with this, there is a priest, Father Quintana, played by Javier Bardem, whose consciousness begins to guide the movie in its American phase, and whose crisis of faith colours how we see the painful trial of Neil and Marina's happiness.</p> <p>The locals don't know quite how to take Marina, but it is specifically Neil's work that brings him into conflict with the community. He appears to be investigating soil subsidence and problems with the water table in the surrounding neighbourhood, issues that might affect the viability of the whole district. People nearby tell him he is making them nervous; one says that even the dog is behaving strangely. Despite the vivid gorgeousness that Malick discovers everywhere, there is a fundamental problem with the American soil itself \u2013 a real crisis of faith \u2013 and Neil and Marina's existence is wilting. Malick may intend a visual rhyme with the earlier sequence at Mont Saint-Michel, in which the couple were running around in the squelching mud which seemed to ripple and bounce under their feet. There, the effect was playful and sensual, now the soil's treachery is disturbing.</p> <p>Marina's visa can't last for ever; a decision about marriage can't be delayed as they both begin to doubt if America is really for them, and here is where Jane enters the story and Malick conjures a sublime sequence in which a kind of alternative-reality love affair is played out. Would a monogamous commitment be an affirmation of trust in God and in the mysterious beauty of life, which would generate its own success \u2013 or just be a terrible mistake?</p> <p>At its best, Malick's cinematic rhapsody is glorious; during his uncertain moments, he appears to be repeating himself. But what delight there is in this film.</p>"
