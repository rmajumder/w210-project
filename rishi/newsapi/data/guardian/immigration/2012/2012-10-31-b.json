  "<p>Michael Heseltine's <a href=\"http://www.bis.gov.uk/assets/biscore/corporate/docs/n/12-1213-no-stone-unturned-in-pursuit-of-growth.pdf\" title=\"\">report on growth</a> yesterday brought a bright shaft of old-time star quality back to the all-too-grey autumn political scene. There's a real temptation, especially for those of us who wrote about him in his prime, to get all&#xa0;nostalgic about Hezza.</p> <p>But it is a temptation that should be resisted. So no Tarzan metaphors from me this time around. Nothing about the hair. Nothing about Westland. Nothing about Liverpool. Nothing about a great speech I once heard him make at the Chesterfield byelection nearly 30 years ago. What matters is whether Heseltine is right about today's problems and whether the coalition is willing or likely to listen to his many messages.</p> <p>Parts of what Heseltine says has been said by others, some of it by Labour. But&#xa0;it has not been said better. The way he makes his case is a tonic. Yes, there is&#xa0;always a recklessness about Heseltine. It is why he remains the greatest of the modern might-have-beens. But he is so clearly right about the big things. And that is what counts.</p> <p>Heseltine recognises that this economic crisis is different from the others that postwar Britain has experienced. He is right that we are living through the&#xa0;start of a large shift in global economic power that will shape our future options more than many have yet realised. And he defines the economic and political terrain of the next decade in ways that simply cannot be ignored by any politician or policy maker wishing to be taken seriously.</p> <p>He is also right to say that excessive borrowing constrains the ability of the public sector to carry the weight of a viable growth strategy. A growth strategy is also largely a private-sector strategy \u2013 another pill that is hard for some to swallow. But at the core of Heseltinism, today as in the past, is an active embrace of the role of government in stimulating and channelling that private-sector growth. The most famous thing that Heseltine ever said was that he would \"intervene before breakfast, before lunch, before tea and before dinner\". It was also where he was truest to himself \u2013 and where he was right.</p> <p>Heseltine is too practised a political operator to allow himself to be manoeuvred into the role of opposition ringleader. Anyone listening to any of his many <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2012/oct/31/lord-heseltine-money-cities-growth-video\" title=\"\">interviews and speeches</a> in the past 24 hours will have seen the old ringcraft delightfully intact.</p> <p>But there is no getting away from the&#xa0;truth on which Labour seized yesterday. Heseltine believes \u2013 is right to believe \u2013 that the UK needs an industrial strategy. The government is equivocal. So when Heseltine says that continuing as we are is not an option, or when he says that the UK lacks a growth and wealth creation strategy, all the ringcraft in Christendom cannot disguise the fact that he is saying the government is on the wrong course.</p> <p>If this is Heseltine's single most important criticism of government, it is&#xa0;far from being his only one. His report&#xa0;ranges wide, characteristically. It slices through the Whitehall turf war between the business department and the Home Office over immigration controls, making it clear that Heseltine believes that a country that declares itself open for business cannot at the same time be closed to people, especially if it takes its skills strategy seriously. Vince Cable will be quietly cheering that. Theresa May will seethe.</p> <p>Nor is Heseltine any great respecter of Eric Pickles's localism agenda, which routinely seems to take back with one hand what it gives with the other. Heseltine waxes lyrical about Victorian cities. His report has a portrait of Joseph Chamberlain on its opening page, and Hezza pointedly <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global/2012/oct/31/michael-heseltine-plan-h\" title=\"\">launched his plan</a> in Chamberlain's Birmingham yesterday. His localist vision is nothing if not bold. He wants to reverse the drift of power and money to \"London and its bureaucracies\" and he wants to transform local authorities from service providers into promoters of economic development.</p> <p>Not even Heseltine in all his enthusiasm thinks this is going to happen any time soon, or maybe any time at all, but&#xa0;the determination is exhilarating. And so is the cultural radicalism. Heseltine isn't just in favour of localism because it feels more connected and democratic. He's in favour of it because he has a job for it to do.</p> <p>Anyone who pines for a reinvigoration of civic England as part of the rethinking of the UK in the new British political landscape created by devolution to Scotland and Wales has an important ally in Heseltine.</p> <p>Chamberlain, though, was a lot more than a municipal innovator. He saw himself as a big political strategist too. And there is an echo of his later political career in Heseltine's politically charged proposal for government to police foreign takeovers of British companies so that they benefit the industrial strategy.</p> <p>It's a reminder that, just as Chamberlain turned to imperial preference to protect UK industry, so Heseltine's lifelong support for the European Union has had a similar industrial logic too.</p> <p>But will any of it happen? David Cameron sounded enthusiastic but unspecific yesterday. The Treasury will hate the report. But that doesn't mean that the whole thing is heading for the long grass. The Heseltine report will not suddenly become the coalition's book of the year. But there's a lot in it that a coalition in search of a more substantial growth strategy can run with.</p> <p>They would certainly be smart to do&#xa0;so. Heseltine is not promoting wacky&#xa0;new ideas in this report. He is promoting ideas with deep Tory roots \u2014 not just in Chamberlain but in RA Butler's important but now largely forgotten <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_Charter\" title=\"\">industrial charter</a> of the postwar era, and beyond that in the Tory tradition of Bolingbroke and Disraeli, with their belief that the state must act in the interests of the many. But he is also promoting mainstream ideas about the&#xa0;role of government in industry which are commonplace in other advanced industrial nations, not just in Europe but also in the US.</p> <p>It is impossible to read Heseltine's report and not be struck by the autobiographical quality of his writing. At times it is as though he is telling the story of a road not travelled by postwar Britain, a road along which a Heseltine premiership might have led us. The country would have been a better place if that had happened. But the road is still there if we want it and, as Heseltine puts it with potent clarity, we are still the ones&#xa0;out of step in not taking it.</p>",
  "<p>Nick Clegg (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/oct/29/proud-ending-child-detention?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">We are proud of having ended child detention</a>, 20 October) says that children detained at the border are transferred to family friendly facilities at <a href=\"http://www.ukba.homeoffice.gov.uk/aboutus/organisation/immigrationremovalcentres/tinsleyhouse\" title=\"\">Tinsley House</a>, if there is a short delay before their flight out. In fact, children continue to spend long periods in detention at Heathrow, including overnight. Border Force staff continue to try to deal with children's cases faster. However, long periods of detention are still likely when a family is not admitted to the country and has to be returned. If a family is detained in the morning, there is every chance it will remain at the airport and be removed on an evening flight.</p> <p>Those who are held in the afternoon and evening will probably not leave until the next day. By the time a family's case has been considered, accommodation allocated and transport organised, several hours may have passed. There is then the journey of 41 miles, followed by the admission procedure at Tinsley House. Detainees being removed through Heathrow on morning flights can expect to be collected from immigration removal centres very early in the morning to allow time for security procedures on arrival back at Heathrow.</p> <p>This being the case, children detained during the evening and to be removed next morning are very likely to be held overnight at Heathrow, because there is no time to get them to Tinsley House and back while allowing a reasonable time in bed. The accommodation in which some children spend many hours at Heathrow is unsuitable. Even if promised improvements are delivered, there will still be no natural light, no access to the open air and no proper sleeping accommodation in the holding rooms.</p> <p>Mr Clegg also refers to the family friendly facility at <a href=\"http://www.ukba.homeoffice.gov.uk/aboutus/organisation/pre-departure-accommodation/\" title=\"\">Cedars</a>. This is, indeed, to a very high standard. However, there is an urgent need for accommodation of a similar standard at Heathrow for the children who continue to be detained there.<br><strong>Greg Beecroft</strong><br><em>Chair, Heathrow Independent Monitoring Board </em></p> <p>\u2022 Liberal Democrat MPs keep claiming they have ended the immigration detention of children. This is simply not true: 84 children have been detained in the new immigration detention facility for children that the government has opened. It is run by G4S and Barnardo's.</p> <p>Nick Clegg describes the place as a \"decent stopping off point\" and that families are \"accommodated\" there. Families are, in fact, detained there, which is why it is inspected by HM Inspector of Prisons.</p> <p>The inspectorate reported last week that force had been used on children, that six families at the new detention facility had been detained twice, and one three times. It revealed that a pregnant woman in a wheelchair was tipped up and had her feet held by G4S staff, noting that the risk of injury to the unborn child was significant.</p> <p>The NSPCC has said: \"Locking up children like this is wrong and unacceptable. Better-quality detention is still detention, however dressed up.\" In opposition, Nick Clegg branded the immigration detention of children as \"state-sponsored cruelty\", promising to end it. David Cameron declared that his government would \"end the incarceration of children for immigration purposes once and for all\". They can and they should \u2013 today.<br><strong>Emma Mlotshwa</strong><br><em>Co-ordinator, </em><a href=\"http://www.medicaljustice.org.uk/\" title=\"\"><em>Medical Justice</em></a></p>",
  "<p>We do not know what David Cameron discussed on the <a href=\"http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm/cmregmem/110328/cameron_rt-hon-david.htm\" title=\"\">free helicopter flights</a> he accepted in the runup to the election from Noble Foods, the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/law/2012/oct/29/workers-chickens-allegedly-trafficked-beaten\" title=\"\">Happy Egg company</a>, which this week turned out to be using Lithuanian workers allegedly kept in conditions of slavery. In any case, there would have been plenty of other opportunities for the company's chairman, Peter Dean, a key Tory party donor, to discuss the importance of cheap, flexible labour with&#xa0;the Conservatives. Noble Foods <a href=\"https://pefonline.electoralcommission.org.uk/search/searchintro.aspx\" title=\"\">gave \u00a350,000 to the Tories</a> last year alone. That is the magic figure that gets&#xa0;you <a href=\"http://www.conservatives.com/Donate/Donor_Clubs.aspx\" title=\"\">dinner with David Cameron.</a> It&#xa0;must feel like happy eggs all round now, with the coalition's charge to remove the \"red tape\" of labour rights that is a such \"burden on business\".</p> <p>And while the Conservatives may talk&#xa0;tough on immigration, make no mistake, they are anything but tough on&#xa0;the causes of immigration. Their policies are one key driver of it.</p> <p>Why, when unemployment among the young and unskilled here is so high,&#xa0;do companies like Noble Foods need to turn to foreign workers supplied&#xa0;by gangmasters? The description of the life&#xa0;led by the Lithuanians who were liberated into the care of the <a href=\"http://www.soca.gov.uk/about-soca/about-the-ukhtc\" title=\"\">UK Human Trafficking Centre</a> earlier this month might offer a clue.</p> <p>They told how they were shuttled, in mini-vans, the length and breadth of the country, often sleeping in the vehicles between working shifts of up to 17 hours on farms contracted to Noble. Much of this type of work happens at night, a few hours here and a back-to-back double shift there. The flexible workforce big business says it needs is one they like to be able to turn on and off as easily as a tap.</p> <p>Few people other than recent migrants can tolerate conditions of this sort for long. They are incompatible with any sort of ordered, decent family life. The pay is rarely enough to live on. The Agricultural Wages Board set rural pay slightly higher than the minimum wage and made sure workers received basic sick pay and protection at work. The government wants to abolish it. More than 150,000 low-income workers will be directly affected, another 100,000 indirectly.</p> <p>Small farmers don't want to see the board go. They hate having to conduct individual negotiations with seasonal workers, and want a level playing field on which everyone is obliged to pay properly. It is the larger producers and agribusiness that are lobbying to get rid of it. When pay is too low to live on, local people are forced out, leaving a gap to be filled by those who are more desperate from elsewhere. Immigration becomes the wages policy, with government actually promoting its increase.</p> <p>The Gangmaster Licensing Authority has survived the bonfire of the quangos, but only just. Set up with support across the political spectrum after <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2004_Morecambe_Bay_cockling_disaster\" title=\"\">23 cockle pickers drowned in Morecambe Bay</a> in 2004, it was never funded sufficiently to carry out the level of inspection and enforcement needed to eradicate labour abuse. The sectors it covered were illogically restricted to food processing and agriculture, rather than including all those areas in which migrant labour dominates, such as catering, hotel work, construction and care homes. Labour was wedded to the flexible workforce too. But the coalition government will have slashed the GLA's already meagre resources by nearly a fifth by the end of&#xa0;this parliament.</p> <p>In response to complaints from agribusiness <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/law/2012/mar/05/gangmasters-watchdog-defra-licensing-authority\" title=\"\">it has instructed the GLA</a> to be \"lighter in its touch\" when it regulates and inspects. Providing gangs of vulnerable migrant workers you don't have to bother to pay properly to factories and farms has got easier. Life for those who want to operate legally, providing decent jobs, filled by the sort of workers who know their rights and are not so easy to exploit, has got harder. Once again, tough when it comes to rhetoric on immigration, lax on the regulation that might remove the conditions driving it.</p> <p>It was turning a blind eye to the flouting of another bit of regulation, the Sunday trading laws, that marked a turning point in economic migration from eastern Europe to the UK in the early 1990s. Big supermarkets started opening illegally on Sundays, knowing local authorities would not have the bottle or resources to take them on. They succeeded in making a change to the law \u2013 which was opposed by unions and church groups \u2013 a fait accompli.</p> <p>Touring factories, I have often been told by directors that the switch to seven-day trading with accompanying \"<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jan/06/just-in-time-business-model-disaster-risk\" title=\"\">just-in-time</a>\" ordering forced them to restructure their workforce. Where, in the past, local people had worked five days a week and enjoyed being able to supplement their incomes with overtime payments for evening and weekend work, that was no longer enough to meet supermarket demands. They had to run 24/7; it was migrants who filled the much longer unsocial hours. The Conservatives want to relax Sunday trading laws further. Ask their voters if they want longer shopping hours, and no doubt many would say yes. Tell them it could mean more migration and you might get a different answer.</p> <p>Each year the government says it wants to close down schemes, such as&#xa0;the seasonal agricultural workers programme, that allow foreign workers&#xa0;to come into sectors that need&#xa0;low-skill labour, to curb immigration and help British workers. Each year industry argues that it needs them, and&#xa0;they are reopened.</p> <p>The Conservative stance on Croatian accession to the EU next year is dog-whistle shrill. It wants restrictions to prevent access to the UK labour market by Croatian nationals. Few are likely to come, as they have much stronger ties with Germany. But why miss an opportunity to grandstand to your anti-immigration heartlands?</p> <p>The more noise made about foreign workers, the easier it is to distract people from the fact that the best way to keep British jobs is to preserve employment protection and enforce the law.</p>",
  "<p>Too many children are being forced to leave foster care or residential care at 16. Even if they hadn't already had difficult lives, they wouldn't be ready for independence, as you can see from looking at any other 16-year-old. Charities that help in this circumstance say kids often arrive without the slightest means of looking after themselves, without birth certificates or National Insurance numbers, having been allocated totally unsuitable, ramshackle accommodation miles away from their foster homes or anyone they might have known or relied on during the \"cared-for\" period of their lives. Why would a local authority be so heartless? Shouldn't kids who have been taken into care expect the local authority to act in loco parentis, in its truest sense, as if it has a meaningful, protective impulse?</p> <p>These questions are thrown up periodically \u2013 in adult social care as well as in children's care \u2013 and it always goes like this: local authorities or similar statutory agencies aren't doing enough; a major charity calls on them to do more and supports the argument with chilling case studies; it's a story, until something else happens, and then it's an ex-story.</p> <p>We don't have a particularly strong tradition, in this media trajectory, of asking what happened to the money. You can be sure money is being spent \u2013 it costs between \u00a3200,000 and \u00a3300,000 a year for <a href=\"http://www.lboro.ac.uk/research/ccfr/Research/Exploring%20costs%20and%20outcomes/costsandconsequences.htm\" title=\"\">residential care for a child</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=3&amp;ved=0CEYQFjAC&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.everychild.org.uk%2Fdocs%2FFosteringBetterCare.pdf&amp;ei=i0eRUNLyB82FhQeTuIC4BQ&amp;usg=AFQjCNGO8DSSoJC0no4QxpEdi3sYdvWuyQ\" title=\"\">\u00a330,000 to \u00a360,000 for foster care</a>. Why is it so expensive? (For comparison, it costs \u00a330,000 to keep someone in a low-security prison for year, and \u00a330,000 to send someone to Eton.) Who gets the money? It's a long story, but the answer emphatically isn't the carers or the foster family.</p> <p>After 20 years of outsourcing, the bulk of children's homes are run by private companies, with money sucked upwards into one or two private equity companies, <a href=\"http://www.gipartners.com/\" title=\"\">GI Partners</a> or <a href=\"http://www.bowmark.com/\" title=\"\">Bowmark Capital</a> or <a href=\"http://www.bairdprivateequity.com/private-equity/default.aspx\" title=\"\">Baird Capital</a>. Two-thirds of fostering provision is controlled by the private sector. Only 11% of children's homes are run by charities; the third sector started off quite big in children's care, as you'd expect, meeting local-authority contracts by spending their own reserves. Eventually, though, the private sector underbid them, and they went bust or moved into other services.</p> <p>Having whittled down the competition, the private sector became eye-poppingly expensive: \u00a3200,000 is&#xa0;actually a low estimate, based on overall&#xa0;spending of \u00a31bn on 5,000 children in residential care homes in England. In 2009, it was leaked that <a href=\"http://www.castlecaregroup.co.uk/placement.html\" title=\"\">CastleCare</a>, which runs 40 homes in Northamptonshire, was charging \u00a3378,000 a year for a residential place. This would be money well spent if the care was brilliant, but it isn't. Only 2.5% of children's homes have an Ofsted rating of \"outstanding\".</p> <p>For that kind of money, you could send them to the moon; instead, children are sent to wherever the companies across the chain can make most profit. This makes sense of what would otherwise look like perverse, bordering on cruel, decisions. Companies buy homes where properties are cheapest; this could be many miles from the child's local authority; even if it's just 20 miles away, that's still far enough for the child to lose contact with the placing authority (not to mention anybody they may have known, their extended families, their teachers and their friends).</p> <p>In 2011 <a href=\"http://menmedia.co.uk/manchestereveningnews/news/s/1587927_millions-spent-by-greater-manchester-councils-on-dumping-care-kids-miles-away-from-home\" title=\"\">Greater Manchester councils</a> placed more than 1,000 kids \"out of borough\" \u2013 \"dumping\", as some experts call it \u2013 but also received children from other authorities. In all likelihood, the number of children in residential care in the area remained the same, but the difference was that links had been severed between the child and the social worker.</p> <p>Sometimes local authorities commission responsibility out to one another, and sometimes they just keep their fingers crossed and hope they get time to do it themselves. By the time the kids are adults, they may not have had direct contact with their social work team since they were placed in residential care. It puts significant pressure on the local services of wherever they have been placed if you tot up the cost for health and mental health services, police, school interventions, the constellation of agencies that have to get involved when children in care aren't being properly cared for. But apparently this is what efficiency looks like, spending \u00a3200k-plus a year to wash problems out of your own area, so they spring up 10 times more expensively somewhere else.</p> <p>At the end of this period in \"care\", then, why are kids and young adults moved miles away from their foster homes? Why are 44% of 16-year-olds who leave care still not in education, employment or training three years later? For the same old reasons \u2013 because housing is found wherever it's cheapest.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-tees-20135248?print=true\" title=\"\">cheapest house in the UK</a> went on sale this week, for \u00a3750, in Stockton. That's also where a huge amount of asylum seekers' and post-care housing is \u2013 I know, wild coincidence! It's quite a saving, but mainly for the contractor rather than the government. Where housing is cheap, the local economy tends to be sluggish, and unemployment is generally high. Brilliant. Now you have a young person with no roots, no money and no realistic prospect of employment. I don't know why we don't just cut out the middle man and send them directly to jail.</p> <p>It's reasonable to talk about the morality of having a profit motive in this&#xa0;sector at all. You shouldn't run a home for a profit. But before we start on any of that, we need to scotch the idea that private-sector involvement has&#xa0;made any of this any cheaper.</p> <p><em>Twitter: @zoesqwilliams</em></p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 1 November 2012. The original referred to spending of \u00a31bn on 5,000 children in care. These figures relate to children in residential care homes in England. This has been corrected.</p>",
  "<p>Until violence erupted in northern Mali, the Hotel Via Via had been on the verge of expansion, scooping up tourists and business travellers who not long ago congregated in Mopti \u2013 a bustling gateway between the north and south, surrounded by the water of the Niger and Bani rivers. Since al-Qaida-linked groups seized control of large swaths of the north of the country, leaving Mopti on the frontline between the government-controlled south and the Islamist-controlled north, outside visitors have vanished, and so have the expansion plans. Instead, the hotel's half-built wings provide a discreet location for the Ganda Koya, a militia whose name means \"son of the nation\" in the local Sonrai language.</p> <p>As dusk settled over the hotel, a group of the militia scuttled between the building and a makeshift camp across the road where many rent cheap accommodation. One of them, Fatou Sissiko \u2013 a pretty, 18-year-old girl wearing a low-cut sleeveless vest and African print skirt \u2013 held a friend's baby girl on her arm as she talked quietly and reluctantly about the atrocities she witnessed in her home town, Gao, after it was taken over by the Islamist group the Movement for Tawhid and Jihad in West Africa (Mujao) in March.</p> <p>\"I left Gao because I want to fight to liberate the city,\" she said. \"I hated living under the Mujao. They are dangerous people, they don't fear death. They killed many innocent people, I saw it with my own eyes. They destroyed my school. Our parents send us money so that we can stay in Mopti and learn to fight \u2013 they support what we are doing.\"</p> <p>Sissiko is one of thousands of young people who have grown frustrated at the failure of the Mali government \u2013 which was toppled by a coup on 22 March and has been replaced by a widely despised interim regime \u2013 to protect its citizens in the north.</p> <p>Despite a United Nations security council resolution earlier this month opening the door to military intervention to end al-Qaida's hold over the northern region, residents have continued to flee.</p> <p>An estimated 35,000 internally displaced people, of whom 10,000 are living in official camps, have arrived in the Mopti region alone since the government lost control of northern Mali, one security source told the Guardian.</p> <p>Many, like Sissiko, have joined militias, prompting fears that the ranks of independent trained and armed northerners could create further problems for the country.</p> <p>Military action \u2013 which an official source insists is being pursued alongside the possibility of negotiations \u2013 is likely to begin in the new year. But civilian authorities in Mopti are already gearing up for war in the north, and are preparing emergency plans to merge the police, gendarmerie, national guard and emergency services.</p> <p>\"Militia members are in their thousands, and their numbers are multiplying,\" said the source. \"I fear the impact of their existence on the country \u2013 they are regional and ethnocentric organisations that can only further divide Mali.</p> <p>\"If people want to liberate the north they should integrate into the national forces, otherwise it risks creating a whole new problem when this war is over.\"</p> <p>Despite reports that the ranks of the Islamist groups \u2013 Mujao in Gao, Ansar Dine in Kidal, and al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb in Timbuktu \u2013 are filled by insurgents from neighbouring Algeria and Mauritania, people from those towns say that their numbers have been bolstered by Malians who have joined the groups as a means of survival.</p> <p>In a refugee camp next door to the Via Via, a slender man wearing overalls sits slumped against the wall on a low bench. The makeshift camp is another abandoned hotel, this one built as cheap overnight accommodation for the drivers who once accompanied their affluent employers on visits to Mopti. The long, single-storey buildings are crowded with scores of half-dressed children, women pounding food for the evening meal, and tents bearing the Swiss Red Cross logo.</p> <p>Oumar Ciss\u00e9, 42, was a motorbike mechanic in Douanza \u2013 a town in the Mopti region currently controlled by the Mujao \u2013 when Islamists, including people he grew up with, began terrorising the local people.</p> <p>\"Ordinary people I have known all my life, who I used to sit down and drink tea with, joined the Islamists and killed their own neighbours,\" said Ciss\u00e9. \"I cannot join them \u2013 I just want to live a normal life and educate my children. I fled here with my two wives and 11 children.\"</p> <p>Ciss\u00e9, a Bella \u2013 the ethnic name used for black Tuaregs \u2013 said conditions in the camp were almost unbearable. He is one of the minority of internally displaced people living in official government accommodation, which he said was heavily overcrowded.</p> <p>\"Now my sisters, who are teachers, have also joined us [in Mopti] because the Mujao have closed all the schools in Douanza \u2013 they don't believe in western education. During the rainy season we were 15 people sleeping in one room. We had to take it in turns to stand up at night.\"</p> <p>The refugees said they welcomed plans for a military intervention to reclaim the north, currently being drawn up in the capital city, Bamako, by the Mali government, the Economic Community of West African States and the African Union, with other international support from the European Union and the US.</p> <p>\"I am a simple man, I don't know about the details of who should do what; all I know is that I want to go home and return to my normal life, and if we do not have outside help this is not going to happen,\" said Ciss\u00e9.</p> <p>A security source, who asked not to be named, said that there were concerns that Mopti \u2013 only 30 miles (50km) from the region where al-Qaida-linked groups have held power since March \u2013 would be destabilised by the absence of the armed forces, which have a major base in the city. There are also fears that Islamist sleeper cells in Mopti and other southern cities have the capability to launch terrorist attacks.</p>",

The Home Office has argued that, as technology changes and new platforms emerge, the authorities' ability to keep track of suspects has degraded by as much as 25%.</p> <p>But peers and MPs on the joint committee raised fears that the massive increase in the storage of sensitive personal data required could lead to invasion of privacy on a new scale, and be open to criminal attack.</p> <p>A Liberal Democrat peer, Lord Strasburger, described the proposals as a \"honeypot for casual hackers, blackmailers, criminals large and small from around the world, and foreign states\".</p> <p>A former Labour minister, Nicholas Brown, said the public were frightened they \"were going to be spied on\" and that \"illegally obtained\" information would find its way to the public domain.</p> <p>He supported a call from the Information Commissioner for the enactment of powers already on the statute book to impose prison sentences of up to 12 months, and not just heavy fines, for those who unlawfully obtain personal data.</p> <p>The home secretary agreed to look at the detail of the custodial powers specified in sections 77 and 78 of the <a href=\"http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2008/4/contents\" title=\"\">2008 Criminal Justice and Immigration Act</a>, which carry a public-interest and investigative-journalism defence for those who \"blag\" access to confidential personal information. The issue is one that Lord Justice Leveson is also expected to pronounce upon.</p> <p>May also agreed to reconsider the terms of clause 1 of the bill, which would give her very widely drawn powers to make orders requiring internet and phone companies to hand over an individual's communications records to \"relevant public authorities\".</p> <p>May said that this would mainly be used for tackling terrorism, serious crime and paedophilia, but added that the government needed flexibility in the legislation to meet rapid changes in technology and ensure the bill was not outdated by the time it passed. However, the committee made clear that it was this desire to \"future-proof\" the legislation that was causing the most public alarm.</p> <p>The home secretary sidestepped questions about how she felt about Britain becoming the first democracy to use the kind of \"deep packet inspection\" web monitoring system so far only used in China, Iran and Kazakhstan.</p> <p>But May insisted it was a myth that the state was going to read everyone's emails: \"There is a limited scope for the data we want to have access to. We have been very clear about that at every stage. The police would have to make a clear case for requesting access to data when there was an investigation that required it.</p> <p>\"The aim of this is to ensure our law enforcement agencies can carry on having access to the data they find so necessary operationally in terms of investigation, catching criminals and saving lives.\"</p> <p>Police made urgent requests for communications data in 30,000 cases last year and between 25% and 40% of them had resulted in lives being saved, May said. \"I think that matters to the public,\" she told the committee.</p>",
  "<p>The Horizon Diner has always been at the heart of the community in Manahawkin, a small town of barely 2,000 people just west of Long Beach Island. But after superstorm Sandy ripped through this coastal community on Monday night the diner has become a vital lifeline for those looking for both something to eat and to keep warm.</p> <p>On Wednesday, there was an almost constant stream of people coming through the door of the restaurant, with its white and green exterior and plush red booths and long, curved bar. Like most here, the diner lost power during the storm but was one of a few buildings in the town to get electricity back on Tuesday.</p> <p>\"It's been extremely busy,\" said manager Joanne Daddetta, as she raced around serving coffee and ringing up receipts. \"There's nowhere else for people to go and eat. A lot of people don't have power at their house, the stores are closed, no electricity, no gas, so they chose to come out.\"</p> <p>Daddetta lost power herself, but said she has managed to adjust to \"walking around with a flashlight\".</p> <p>\"It was eventful, it was something I've never experienced before,\" she said. \"I have a gas stove, so with a little bit of a flame the gas worked, and we are, we had dinner, we had our coffee, so we were OK.\"</p> <p>Manahawkin itself is a small town built mostly around one street which leads down to the New Jersey coast. Most of the wood panelled houses seem to be intact, and there are people on the streets and cars on the roads, although traffic signals are still not working.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398652702\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/31/1351709116981/Joe-and-Pam-Golding-New-J-004.jpg\" alt=\"Joe and Pam Golding, New Jersey diner\" width=\"220\" height=\"132\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Joe and Pam Golding</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Joe Golding, a retired teacher, popped into Horizon on Wednesday morning with his wife, Pam, and friends George and Lois Papp, to \"get warm and get food\". The Goldings live on the bay side of Long Beach Island, so their house had some protection from the storm surge, but they were still forced to evacuate on Saturday night. They have not been able to return yet to see the damage, as police roadblocks are in place even for residents, and are worried about what they'll find.</p> <p>\"Oh it's very frustrating,\" Joe said. \"Some of the people who live in Beach Haven West have been allowed to return, but I haven't. And the people who are there, if they leave they're not allowed back.\"</p> <p>Joe and Pam, who have had a house in the area since 1979, are staying at Lois and George's place until they can return. The Papps live in Ocean Acres, farther back from the water, although the foursome have still had to make do without power.</p> <p>\"The thing I miss the most is the hot shower,\" Lois said. Joe was the only one to brave the icy water this morning. \"We're living by candlelight,\" she added. \"We still have gas, although the only heat we have is through the fireplace so that's where we congregate.\"</p> <p>\"You do what you can, make the most of the daylight hours. Our routines have changed, we eat our main meal earlier and then just have sandwiches later in the evening.\"</p> <p>Lois said they have also missed out on being able to keep updated on damage from the storm, although they have received sporadic bits of information.</p> <p>\"People have been calling in. My sister in North Carolina has been calling in to tell me what she says on TV to tell me what's happening in my own area,\" she said.</p> <p>Joe also has a \"little transistor radio\", but hasn't been having much luck with getting a signal, and entertainment has been limited.</p> <p>\"Last night was fun. We kind of played Tripoli by candlelight,\" Lois said, although the others seem to recall the experience with less enthusiasm. The board game antics came after dining on a baked ham that Lois had cooked before the storm struck, although they were now down to canned food.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398652703\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/31/1351707009600/Duke-Lang-and-Jane-Lang-004.jpg\" alt=\"Duke Lang and Jane Lang\" width=\"220\" height=\"132\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Duke Lang and Jane Lang</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Bailey/Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The majority of diners at the restaurant were without power at home, although there was mostly a stoic attitude among those the Guardian spoke with.

People have been <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/oct/17/daryl-hannah-transcanada-keystonexl-pipeline\">putting their bodies on the line</a> and risking arrest in order to protect our future, to acknowledge climate change disasters and to protect access to basic necessities such as uncontaminated water, soil and food. We are seeing an exponentially growing number of nationwide rallies, protests and acts of civil disobedience just to protect these fundamental life support systems.</p> <p>The threats are exacerbated by the looming death throes of an outdated and finite fossil fuel industry struggling to stay relevant in the 21st century, despite its current economic might. It's hard to reconcile the fact that the fossil fuel industry is struggling when their unprecedented profits make them the wealthiest of corporations in the history of mankind, even in this devastated global economy \u2013 but the times, they are-a-changing.</p> <p>As we have evidently exhausted the easier-to-access \"conventional\" fuels, Big Oil is now resorting to \"unconventional\" sources, and the industry must rely on more and more extreme extraction measures to obtain fossil fuel resources. These extreme forms of extraction come with a dangerous cost, and often a high economic cost as well. In a <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/21/business/energy-environment/in-a-natural-gas-glut-big-winners-and-losers.html\">New York Times article </a>on the grim economics of the natural gas boom, even the chief executive of Exxon Mobil, Rex Tillerson, stated, \"We're making no money. It's all in the red.\" Texas billionaire oilman T Boone Pickens said, \"shut her down\", \"quit drilling\" and \"we are stupid to drill these wells.\"</p> <p>But they won't because the leases the companies have bought came, in most cases, with \"use it or lose it\" clauses that required them to start drilling, pay royalties or lose the leases.</p> <p>Lost leases may be an economic concern to these mega-wealthy multinational corporations, but the loss of, and lethal threat to, our living systems that we depend upon for survival is of greater concern for the rest of us. These extreme extraction processes are the fossil fuel industry's last-ditch efforts to stretch their global financial dominance as far into the 21st century as they possibly can. To access oil beyond the shallow wells of the last century \u2013 which are now mostly exhausted \u2013 one process the industry has turned to is deep-water drilling, including opening up the extremely sensitive areas in the Arctic region. We have already had a taste of the devastating repercussions of this practice from <a href=\"http://thinkprogress.org/climate/2012/10/25/1091581/federal-regulators-issue-more-deepwater-drilling-permits-in-the-gulf-of-mexico-since-2007/\">BP's Deepwater Horizon disaster</a> in the Gulf of Mexico. </p> <p>Another extreme resource extraction method is a strip-mining process known as tar sands oil extraction, which destroys entire ecosystems where they lie. Tar sands oil <a href=\"http://dirtyoilsands.org/tarsands\">entails</a> a wildly energy-intensive extraction process, uses millions of cubic metres of water and the resulting material must be mixed with a poisonous cocktail of chemicals.</p> <p>Tar sands exploitation leaves behind a dead zone. It also leaves behind the <a href=\"http://newswatch.nationalgeographic.com/2011/08/17/ten-years-after-911-%E2%80%93-canadas-true-cost-of-oil/\">largest toxic unlined impoundments</a> on the planet in enormous lakes that require firing off special cannons to keep flocks of waterfowl from landing on it (risking near-certain death).</p> <p>Threatened by the planned massive expansion of Canada's tar sands operation, which would be aided by the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/oct/17/daryl-hannah-transcanada-keystonexl-pipeline\">approval of either the Keystone XL or the Enbridge Energy pipelines</a>, is the awe-inspiring magnificence of the Canadian boreal forest, which serves as our first defense against global warming as it sequesters more carbon than any other terrestrial ecosystem; and the Athabasca delta, the world's largest freshwater delta. In the United States, Utah has a proposed a 50-square-mile tar sands exploitation project of its own, which, <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-10-26/first-u-s-oil-sands-mine-proceeds-without-pollution-permit.html\">according to Bloomberg</a>, has just been approved \"without first obtaining a pollution permit or monitoring ground water quality\".</p> <p>To mine coal more inexpensively, the industry has taken to simply blowing up entire mountains in a mind-boggling practice called mountain top removal. Over <a href=\"http://www.backpacker.com/environmental_protection_agency_mountaintop_removal_mining_appalachian_mountains/blogs/1296\">500 mountains</a> of the United States' oldest mountain range, the Appalachians, have been unceremoniously eviscerated by the practice; the number awaiting the go-ahead is almost impossible to discover. According to Matt Wasson of Appalachian Voices:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"This information seems intentionally obscured, there's no one agency that can tell you how many pending permits or mine sites are slated for destruction.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>This shocking extraction method bankrupts entire communities, puts miners out of work, leaves the residents with poisoned or buried water sources, homes of no value and hosts of illnesses.</p> <p>Then, there is the breakneck boom mentality of the natural gas industry, which has moved to hydraulic fracturing, or \"<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/sep/20/natural-gas-fracking-fires-protest\">fracking\", wells</a> \u2013 literally fracturing the earth and pumping it full of carcinogenic chemical poisons to release the gas. The process also releases quite a bit of methane, which is a more potent greenhouse gas than CO2. In Colorado alone, where I <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/oct/23/colorado-fracking-free-forever-mariel-hemingway\">attended an anti-fracking/pro-clean energy rally on 23 October</a>, there are already 49,000 active natural gas wells, with thousands of new ones being permitted every year. (In 2011 alone, another 4,659 permits were approved in Colorado.) <a href=\"http://www.denverpost.com/news/ci_18881512\">According to the Denver Post</a>, oil and gas development reports say spills in Colorado reach surface or groundwater every five days.</p> <p>The people and communities that live adjacent to these projects are experiencing the negative repercussions of this corporate profit over public safety energy rush. An extensive number of ranch, farm and home wells have gone bad \u2013 in some homes, they can even <a href=\"http://www.propublica.org/article/scientific-study-links-flammable-drinking-water-to-fracking\">set fire to the \"water\" coming out of their faucets</a>, and illnesses in both humans and animals are manifesting in every region. The simple fact with this rush is that the science has not caught up to the practice; and the safeguards have not had a chance to catch up with the science.</p> <p>So, what is the rush?</p> <p>These energy sources have been sequestered deep in the earth for millions of years, and they hold a higher value to society than just digging them up and combusting them in our homes and cars. We know how to collect and store energy in much less detrimental ways. Why are we not being protected? Both Canada and the US have a self-image that is creative and forward-thinking, yet we are being left in the dust by the rest of the world when it comes to energy's evolution. China and the EU have both <a href=\"http://www.nuwireinvestor.com/articles/united-states-renewable-energy-sector-is-falling-behind-the-rest-54977.aspx\">surpassed us in renewable energy implementation</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-10-16/middle-east-pursues-150-renewable-projects-saves-oil-for-export.html\">according to the Abu Dhabi-based Clean Energy Business Council</a>, even the largest oil-producing nations in the Middle East and North Africa have stated their intentions to move to renewable energy and saving more of their oil for export.</p> <p>We know that regionally-created clean renewable energy is the path to true energy independence and energy security. We know America holds enough wind and solar potential to power our economy 100 times over. So how do we encourage the transition to an aggressive, decentralized clean regenerative energy policy? <a href=\"http://climatecommission.gov.au/about/tim-flannery/\">Tim Flannery</a>, paleontologist and chief commissioner of the Australian Climate Commission, says that incentivizing this transformation is simple: </p> <blockquote> <p>\"What we're dealing with is essentially a pollution problem, and we've known how to fix pollution problems for the last 1,000 years, since King Edward the First: you tax the polluters, get the polluter to pay.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Then why are we not doing it?</p> <p>There are a few reasons. In the US, part of the blame goes to the profoundly unethical US supreme court decision on Citizens United, which granted corporations the same rights as an individual in allowing them to donate an unlimited amount of money to finance campaigns and influence the outcome of our so-called free elections. The result of this ruling was to give an undue amount of influence to corporate polluters and, in particular, the fossil fuel industry, which is the wealthiest industry on the planet. In this year's election cycle alone, <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/blogs/charlie-mahtesian/2012/08/election-price-tag-billion-130856.html\">$6bn will have been given</a> to campaigns, politicians and political action committees. So, the chances of a strong clean energy policy coming from Washington are extremely slim.</p> <p>Then, there's the fact that we the people are all too trusting, simply buying what we are being sold. We've been inundated with incessant, well-funded advertising campaigns of misinformation and rebranding exercises. They are currently selling the public on the idea of tar sands with the more sanitized-sounding \"oil sands\", because they think it sounds less dirty (they've also taken to calling it \"<a href=\"http://www.ethicaloil.org/\">ethical oil</a>\"). Mountain top removal is sold as \"<a href=\"http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=the-dirty-side-of-clean-coal\">clean coal</a>\", and natural gas is packaged as clean, natural and renewable. And we bought it. </p> <p>But now, there are floods and drought. People are being hit by the impacts and their kids are getting sick. Now, our water is threatened, running short \u2013 or poisoned. Our survival is on the line. So we are getting informed. The sleeping giant is waking, still a bit groggy, but moving.</p> <p>The Exxon-Mobils, Chevrons and Royal Dutch Shells of the world might have the big bucks, but when we get together, we the people have the big numbers! We will hold our politicians accountable. If necessary, as a last resort, more and more people will put their bodies on the line:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"While opposition from environmentalists and some native groups was always expected, the Enbridge Northern Gateway Project has unexpectedly united British Columbians who normally are on opposite sides.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>This is what I've experienced in Texas while resisting the Keystone pipeline, in West Virginia fighting mountain top removal and now, in Colorado, standing up against fracking. It's time to take on the fossil fuel industry directly, and people of all ethnicities, political ideologies and economic strata have realized: it's up to us to take a stand. Young and old are coming together and taking action in ways that have pushed them beyond their normal comfort zones to stand up for each other and for common sense. They are seeing the connection between these precarious environmental risks and the humanitarian dangers they bring.</p> <p>Those who want to be safe from the tyranny of poison will always possess the moral authority and will stand on the right side of history. I am proud to be among them.</p>",
  "<p>Episode Seven! It has been a rumour ever since the houselights came up on the most recent Star Wars movie, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2005/may/13/starwars\" title=\"\">Revenge of the Sith</a>, in 2005. In fact, Star Wars creator <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/georgelucas\" title=\"\">George Lucas</a> had been talking about it way back in the late 1970s; he had hinted at a prequel trilogy which finally came to pass in 1999 with The Phantom Menace and also a sequel trilogy, taking the story onward from where it appeared to finish with Return of the Jedi in 1983. So we're going to get Episode Eight, Nine \u2026 and maybe more. Episode Seven is the jewel in the acquisition crown: Disney has bought George Lucas's production behemoth LucasFilm for $4.02bn (\u00a32.5bn): George Lucas gets a head-spinning payday and a big shareholding in Disney, and Disney itself gets the rights to the still-far-from-exhausted franchise goldmines such as Star Wars and Indiana Jones. The movie business wants tentpoles, guaranteed earners: rebooted, reinvented, reimagined.</p> <p>Yet that doesn't prevent a sinking of the spirits as Episode Seven begins its long opening crawl towards us, scheduled to appear in 2015. Really? Another one? It's like hearing that JK Rowling was pulling the plug on all this Casual Vacancy realism and readying another three Harry Potter movies for Warner Brothers, picking up where Deathly Hallows left off. Now, that might well be great \u2013 but still.</p> <p>We all remember the terrible letdown of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/77521/star.wars.episode.i\" title=\"\">The Phantom Menace</a>, all of us saucer-eyed nostalgists and nerds excitably gathered outside the Odeon Leicester Square in London's West End, ready for the first-ever showing, and hardly able to believe that it was actually happening. And then, oh, the disappointment at how boring it was, how dramatically obtuse, how extremely terrible the characterisation of <a href=\"http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Jar_Jar_Binks\" title=\"\">Jar Jar Binks</a>. There was something very wrong there, a sense of misjudgment that never lifted, even when Anakin Skywalker underwent his great, mythic transformation at the end of Revenge of the Sith, when all that prequel history finally came to the dramatic point. Was it just that we were all older and that we were sentimentally loyal to our younger selves, a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away?</p> <p>Maybe. And maybe the failure of The Phantom Menace, a critical failure itself extensively mythologised (though it came up smelling of roses commercially), will vanish as a new generation of fans comes to remember that as the gold-standard of their own youth. But I'll never forget my first viewing of Episode Four in a shopping mall near Boston, Massachusetts in the summer of 1977 \u2013 excitingly, months before it had been released in the UK \u2013 and freaking to that irresistibly corny, syrupy, exclamatory theme from John Williams.</p> <p>It didn't get better than Star Wars, not in 1977 it didn't, and our own jubilee looked a bit downbeat and rainy by comparison. And this was just days after I'd tasted my first proper American burger in America, from Burger King (since you ask), with pickles and American cheese and a properly ice-cold Coke. I had been used only to the horrible boot-heels and unrefrigerated fizzy drinks available from Wimpy back in Blighty. For once, that now-overused word \"awesome\" was appropriate.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-410447811\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/31/1351706723034/darthmouse.jpg\" alt=\"darthmouse\" width=\"193\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A new look for Darth Vader, as imagined by designer Barney George (www.barneygeorge.com) </span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: guardian.co.uk</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>So how will Episode Seven play out? The narrative has been thrashed out in the fan community, with hints from Lucas himself over the years, and a story arc was laid down, but now discredited, in a bestselling franchise-novel series, called the <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Heir-Empire-Star-Wars-Trilogy/dp/0553296124\" title=\"\">Heir to the Empire trilogy</a>, published by Timothy Zahn in the early 90s, set around five years after the events in Return of the Jedi. It is not known if Zahn will have anything to do with writing this new movie, but Lucas will not be directing. That will be a plum job for someone, and names such as <a href=\"http://uk.imdb.com/name/nm0083348/\" title=\"\">Brad Bird </a>and <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0004056/\" title=\"\">Andrew Stanton</a> have been mentioned online.</p> <p>But if Episode Seven is set a few decades further down the line, then we have the intriguing and actually rather exciting prospect of bringing back Carrie Fisher, Harrison Ford and Mark Hamill (respectively 56, 70 and 61 years old) in their original roles. For once, we would have some of the old-fashioned, forward-facing narrative interest that was stymied with The Phantom Menace, and our sense of having grown old with the movies will now fit, and make sense.</p> <p>It could be that this original trio will be merely an incidental gerontocracy, there to be wise and all-knowing with a younger generation. But I'd hope that the story might still revolve around them, particularly Carrie Fisher's Princess Leia, whose character could playfully mirror some of Fisher's own chequered life-story. Or perhaps we could focus on the relationship of Leia and Solo, now married, and there could be a heart-rendingly poignant study of their elderly existence together, rather like Michael Haneke's <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/147440/amour\" title=\"\">Amour</a>, but set in space. Of course, it could be that Disney and Lucas will think it more interesting to have the original characters still as their younger selves, in which case using the original cast is not workable. But it would be a shame to ditch these iconic faces.</p> <p>We live in hope. Episode Seven might well just look silly and cynical and tired. But with a new creative team in place, it could be like Sam Mendes's Skyfall \u2014 a fresh and witty new version. Just as George Lucas in 1977 was inspired by Akira Kurosawa's The Hidden Fortress, maybe the creators of Episode Seven will take something from Hayao Miyazaki's Spirited Away, or Bong Joon-ho's The Host, or Tony Jaa's Ong Bak. The Star Wars myth could regain what it had lost: force.</p>",
  "<h2><strong>Manipulating energy prices</strong></h2> <p>Threat of a \u00a3290m fine from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission for allegedly attempting to manipulate the price of electricity in California between 2006 and 2008. Barclays and four former employees \u2013 Daniel Brin, Scott Connelly, Karen Levine and Ryan Smith \u2013 were said to be buying or selling enough electricity to make the bank's positions in the swaps markets more profitable through moving the price up and down on the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE). Barclays, which is fighting the accusations, is not the only player accused of manipulating Californian electricity prices, but not for the same reasons. Constellation Energy paid a $245m (\u00a3152m) record fine in January, while Deutsche Bank faces a $1.5m penalty and JP Morgan suspension for misleading regulators during an investigation.</p> <h2><strong>Manipulating interest rates</strong></h2> <p>Barclays was the first major bank to be fined for manipulating the benchmark Libor rate \u2013 initially to boost profits and later to protect its financial position \u2013 but it is unlikely to the be last. The Financial Services Authority has admitted it is looking at seven other financial firms and as many as 16 banks. Other firms are co-operating with regulators around the world. The bank has been named in class action lawsuits in the US and the Serious Fraud Office is investigating.</p> <h2><strong>Mis-selling interest rate swaps</strong></h2> <p>Barclays has set aside \u00a3450m to cover the cost of the latest mis-selling scandal. Small businesses, including fish and chip shops, were sold sophisticated interest rate swaps as a way to protect them against interest rate rises, often as a condition attached to a loan. The rate rises did not happen. Barclays is part of an industry-wide agreement to compensate customers.</p> <h2><strong>Libor/interest rate swap mis-selling</strong></h2> <p>A <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/oct/29/bob-diamond-libor-role-court\" title=\"\">high court judge this week concluded</a> that Bob Diamond, the chief executive who quit over Libor, and other Barclays bankers should appear in court to explain what they knew about the manipulation of the key rate in a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/oct/28/barclays-libor-guardian-care-homes\" title=\"\">case brought by Guardian Care Homes about mis-selling of rate swaps</a>.</p> <h2><strong>Mis-selling payment protection insurance</strong></h2> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/oct/18/barclays-increases-ppi-provision-700m\" title=\"\">Barclays has just set aside a further \u00a3700m to cover the cost of PPI claims </a>\u2013 taking its total bill to \u00a32bn. Lloyds, which could make another provision when it reports on Thursday, has set aside \u00a34.3bn. Royal Bank of Scotland's bill stands at \u00a31.3bn, HSBC's at \u00a31.1bn and Santander's at \u00a3500m. Customers were sold PPI alongside loans to cover sickness or unemployment but the insurance was not needed and did not pay out.</p> <h2><strong>Investigation into 2008 fundraisings</strong></h2> <p>Finance director Chris Lucas and three other former and current Barclays staff are under investigation by the Financial Services Authority over the way information was disclosed during two crucial fundraisings in 2008 from Middle Eastern investors that avoided the need for a taxpayer bailout. Barclays was determined not to be constrained by government control and insists it did nothing wrong. It disclosed in August that the Serious Fraud Office was looking at the situation too.</p> <h2><strong>Potential breach of US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act</strong></h2> <p>The justice department and Securities and Exchange Commission are investigating whether the Middle East fundraisings were \"compliant\" with the act. Individuals are not involved. The bank is \"fully co-operating\".</p>",
  "<p>\"Roland Emmerich was right,\" said one screenwriter who had rung me up me excitedly to see whether my area in Brooklyn was underwater or not. She had in mind Emmerich's 2004 disaster movie, The Day After Tomorrow, which consumed New York with a giant tidal wave, although we soon fell to swapping other cine-antecedents: 1998's Deep Impact, 1933's Deluge, and Spielberg's AI with its visions of a sunken Coney Island, underwater skyscrapers, and a statue of liberty submerged but for its torch, now become the perch for seagulls. </p> <p>Such is the fate of New York, that when disaster strikes our first thought goes to the movies, so repeatedly has the city been devastated over the years, whether by tidal wave (Deep Impact), zombie plague (I Am Legend) asteroid (Armageddon), alien (Independence day), or ape (Planet of the Apes). </p> <p>It is the apocalyptic city par excellence. \"What a ruin it will make!\" HG Wells exclaimed, upon catching sight of the New York skyline, which formed one of many indelible images from Monday night \u2013 not entirely blacked out, but partially, from 39th Street and below, which meant that unlike the blackouts of 2003 and 1977, we got to see it at night, the buildings of Greenwich Village just visible in silhouette against the lights further uptown.</p> <p>The citizen in me was horrified, but I'd be lying if I said that the connoisseur of apocalypse \u2013 and since 9/11 all New Yorkers have been experts in that field \u2013 wasn't awed and fascinated at this fresh evidence of what happens to the city in extremis: what <a href=\"http://andrewsullivan.thedailybeast.com/2012/10/time-for-ruin-porn.html \">Andrew Sullivan has termed</a> \"ruin porn.\" </p> <p>Everyone compared 9/11 to a disaster flick but Hollywood would have made the fireballs the jets made when they hit the side of the World Trade Center much bigger; and scattered the debris much wider. It was, curiously, the modesty of the image that terrified: seeing that a jet makes this sized fireball when it hits a building, and casts no debris at all, instead vaporizing on contact.</p> <p>Something similar applied on Monday. What we saw was both less than and more than the hyperbolized destruction of the movies \u2013 not Emmerich's tidal waves, or Spielberg's underwater skyscrapers, but the half-submerged streets of Hoboken; cars floating down the street like flotsam against a grate; the beaches of New Jersey, relocated to the street; shuttered subways, and a rising tide of briny water. Roland Emmerich was only half right. <a href=\"http://www.vulture.com/2012/10/blockbusters-never-prepared-nyc-for-sandy.html\">As Vulture noted</a>:\u2014</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>No matter how often the eggheads told us to watch for the storm surge, not falling skies, we still expected Death From Above \u2013 because that's the apocalypse we're best rehearsed for, from Independence Day to The Avengers. The actual onslaught turned out to be far more insidious, less visible, with few celluloid precedents: a bubbling-up from below, a slow submerging of our vulnerable undercarriage and the corrosion of our centuries-old subterranean infrastructure. Sandy wasn't the cataclysm we'd been trailered; it was more slow-acting snakebite than one-punch obliteration. It could color our future shared nightmares of Big Apple Armageddon, a sector of splashy pessimism that has, for the last decade, been dominated by The Obvious.</p> </blockquote> <p>Because Sandy made landfall in the evening, most of us woke up to find out what had happened, the storm having moved on, leaving behind images whose stillness more closely resembled the eerie landscapes of fiction, rather than the movies. </p> <p>I was reminded in particular of JG Ballard's <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/The-Drowned-World-J-Ballard/dp/1857988833\">The Drowned World</a>, in which the polar icecaps have melted turning Europe is \"a system of giant lagoons\" and the American mid-west into \"an enormous gulf opening into the Hudson Bay\".</p> <p>More recently, we have had Kim Robinson's <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Forty-Signs-Rain-Stanley-Robinson/dp/0553585800\">Forty Signs of Rain</a> in which rising sea levels have turned America's cities into versions of Venice:\u2014</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>A city floored with water. Here it was quite shallow, of course. But the front steps of all the buildings came down into an expanse of brown water, and the water was all at one level, as with any other lake or sea. Brown-blue, blue-brown, brown-gray, brown, gray, dirty white \u2013 drab urban tints all. The rain pocked it into an infinity of rings and bounding droplets, and gusts of wind tore cats' paws. </p> </blockquote> <p>The comparison with old Europe is telling. For New York has taken up the position in the popular imagination that used to be occupied by London, which, in the years leading up to 1916, was subjected to repeated fictional apocalypse, in pulp novels gripped by pre-war jitters. </p> <p>\"Great wars that devastated civilizations were fought in the skies and on imaginary battlefields dwarfing those of Verdun and Stalingrad,\" writes literary historian <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/W.-Warren-Wagar/e/B001HD3402\">W Warren Wagar</a>.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Fascist dictatorships led to a new Dark Age, class and race struggles plunged civilization into Neolithic savagery, terrorists armed with super-weapons menaced Global peace. Floods, volcanic eruptions, plagues, epochs of ice, colliding comets, exploding or cooling suns, and alien invaders laid waste to the world.</p> </blockquote> <p>Sounds like a movie pitch.</p>",
  "<p>More than one in three men surveyed in the Democratic Republic of the Congo's war-torn east admits committing sexual assault, and three in four believe that a woman who \"does not dress decently is asking to be raped\", <a href=\"http://www.genderjustice.org.za/resources/doc_download/101471-preliminary-results-from-the-images-study-in-eastern-drc.html\" title=\"\">researchers have found</a>.</p> <p>Some 61.4% of men interviewed said women sometimes deserve to be beaten; 42.7% think that \"if a woman doesn't show physical resistance when forced to have sex, it's not rape\"; and 27.9% believe that sometimes women want to be raped.</p> <p>Well over 40% of the men polled asserted that a man should reject his wife when she has been raped.</p> <p>The findings show that sexual violence is much more than a weapon of war, activists said, and reflect widespread acceptance of patriarchal norms and rape myths. They also pointed to Congo's incendiary mix of conflict, poverty and weak law enforcement as causal factors in need of urgent redress.</p> <p>The study was carried out by the South African-based <a href=\"http://www.genderjustice.org.za\" title=\"\">Sonke Gender Justice Network</a> and the Brazilian non-government organisation <a href=\"http://www.promundo.org.br/en\" title=\"\">Promundo</a> in and near Goma in Congo's North Kivu province. A total of 708 men and 754 women aged between 18 and 59 took part in individual interviews and focus group discussions in June this year.</p> <p>The self-reporting of men is particularly unusual and striking. Some 34% admit having carried out some form of sexual violence in conflict, homes or other settings.</p> <p>Almost two-thirds agree with the statement that \"women should accept partner violence to keep the family together\", and almost a third endorse the view that \"a woman who is raped has provoked this by her attitude\". More than a quarter believe that \"a man can force a woman to have sex and she may enjoy it\".</p> <p>The preliminary report notes: \"In qualitative interviews, men openly shared their opinions about the 'right to have sex' with their female partner even if she refuses; most men did not consider it to be rape to force their wives to have sex with them. Other men took any 'provocation' by a woman to mean that she wanted sex.\"</p> <p>As an example, it quotes a 48-year-old man who said a girl entered his shop and asked for water: \"When a girl is asking for water in such a way, she wants sex. So I took her in the middle of my shop. I think she liked it because her body accepted me to enter.\"</p> <p>The study, part of the International Men and Gender Equality Survey, also suggests that many men are themselves victims of violence, including sexual violence, and shows a clear association between exposure to violence and increased likelihood of subsequent perpetration.</p> <p>It makes recommendations including far greater promotion of gender equality in schools and public policy and a massive campaign of psycho-social care for boys and girls exposed to multiple forms of violence at young ages.</p> <p>It is estimated that at least half a million women have been raped in eastern Congo since 1998, prompting the UN to brand it \"<a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/8650112.stm\" title=\"\">the rape capital of the world</a>\".</p> <p>Henny Slegh, Promundo's regional coordinator in the Great Lakes region and principal investigator for the new study, said: \"The whole world knows there is a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/may/12/48-women-raped-hour-congo\" title=\"\">lot of sexual violence here</a>. We want to know why. The main thing we found is there are conditions of extreme poverty and conflict and an inadequate response by the national and especially international community contributing to the cycle of violence.</p> <p>\"Gender inequalities exist everywhere but many parts of the world live under better conditions. In this environment it is clearly worse. There are not educational opportunities to change these attitudes. That's what responses and interventions must focus on.\"</p> <p>But there are grounds for optimism, Slegh added, in the honesty and engagement of respondents. \"Men and women said: 'This is the first time I got asked questions where I can tell my story.' One man said he'd raped a girl a week before because he felt it was normal. He was exchanging opinions and it helped him see it another way. The men were very open and said they would like groups discussions more often.\"</p> <p>This was also welcomed by Micheline Muzaneza, a former Congolese child refugee who now works with victims at the Sonke network in Cape Town, South Africa. \"Men accepting and saying, 'Yes, I did this,' is a big step,\" she said. \"We need to work on that.\"</p> <p>Gender inequality is handed down through the generations, she continued. \"They think a woman must be in the kitchen, that a woman is like a child. The cultural attitude is that a man can beat a woman. They grew up like that, seeing their father beat their mother. To punish a rival armed movement, they say: 'Let's go and rape their women and show we are stronger than them.' The woman becomes an object.\"</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.healafrica.org\" title=\"\">Heal Africa</a> runs a hospital for rape victims in Goma and recently<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/19/congo-rape-number-rise-rebels\" title=\"\"> reported a sharp increase in cases because of rising militia fighting</a>. Emmanuel Baabo, leader of its projects dealing with sexual violence, said: \"The attitude of the men who have been asked in this study is not acceptable. How can one think that a woman wants to be raped?</p> <p>\"But I am not surprised at the outcome of this survey. It shows the ignorance of many Congolese men and that in the Congolese culture women are still today often seen as inferior to men. This attitude is also a question of education. The more men are educated, the more they respect generally women.\"</p> <p>He added: \"The armed groups consider violence as a weapon of war. And [seeing] that the system of justice is not working correctly, the impunity makes the situation even worse.\"</p> <p>War in eastern Congo has killed and displaced millions over nearly two decades. At least half of those surveyed live below the absolute poverty line and hunger is a daily reality, with 40% of men and 43% of women having only one meal a day.</p> <p>Sonke is calling for for more engagement with men and women and a transformation of gender relations and social justice. Dean Peacock, its co-founder and executive director, said: \"On the question of whether men can change, the answer is certainly yes, including in Congo.</p> <p>\"There's also evidence that a range of interventions can speed that up: group education, mass media efforts, policy change, including the development and implementation of laws that sanction and deter violence, and disrupt the toxic combination of men's sense of entitlement to women's bodies and their sense of impunity for using violence against women.</p> <p>\"All of those interventions are needed desperately in Congo. There are fledgling efforts to engage men: the Congolese Men's Network, for instance, is working in Kivu to challenge men to speak out against men's violence. These must be supported and strengthened.\"</p>",

Six survivors were rescued by local fishermen, local activists said.</p> <p>The shipwreck is the single most lethal incident linked to the ongoing clashes between the Muslim Rohingya minority and local Rakhine Buddhists in Burma's Arakan state. The death toll has reached 80 in the last 11 days, according to official estimates. Thousands of homes have also been destroyed, along with places of worship.</p> <p>Exact details of the wreck are unclear. But there were fears it could fuel further communal violence, which itself threatens to jeopardise the reform process in Burma. Last week <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ban_Ki-Moon\" title=\"\">UN secretary general Ban Ki-moon said</a> that \"the vigilante attacks, targeted threats and extremist rhetoric must be stopped [or] \u2026 the opening up process being currently pursued by the government is likely to be jeopardised\".</p> <p>The crisis has also posed a major challenge to Nobel laureate and pro-democracy campaigner Aung San Suu Kyi, who has been criticised for failing to speak out strongly enough on the issue. Her National League for Democracy party has remained silent since releasing a brief statement on 24 October.</p> <p>\"[Aung San Suu Kyi] has an obligation to do something about the crisis but for some time she has been silent,\" said Abu Tahay, a Rohingya politician in Yangon, the country's commercial and cultural capital.</p> <p>A first round of violence in June led to 75,000 people, mainly Muslims, fleeing their homes. The clashes over the last 10 days have forced nearly 30,000 more from their villages, according to the United Nations. The vast majority are Rohingya, who are not recognised as citizens of Burma and suffer widespread discrimination. Ethnic Rakhine communities have also suffered.</p> <p>\"I am very worried about the coming weeks. The situation is very unstable. In five minutes the violence could be everywhere,\" Abu Tahay said.</p> <p>On Wednesday a standoff continued on Ramree Island, close to the centre of recent clashes, as security forces attempted to protect Rohingya villages from crowds of local Rakhine.</p> <p>About 7,000 new refugees, including many who had been living on boats for several days, landed near the port town of Sittwe on Tuesday, NGO workers said.</p> <p>Many had been forced to leave their homes in the town of Kyauk Ni Maw, where the rape and murder of a Buddhist woman, allegedly by Muslims, in May sparked the sectarian violence that engulfed much of the state the following month.</p> <p>Hundreds have taken to boats or sought refuge on unpopulated coastal islands over recent days, refugee sources said.</p> <p>Neighbouring Bangladesh, which already has an estimated 300,000 Rohingya refugees, has closed its border, an act which activists claim violates international law.</p> <p>Rohingya campaigners on the Bangladeshi side of the border contacted by the Guardian said they had seen boats full of refugees offshore which were unable to land despite running low on water and food.</p> <p>Thousands of Rohingya try to leave Burma by boat every year. Many vessels are unseaworthy and every year several sink.</p> <p>Chris Lewa, an activist who tracks the ships, said that about 7,000 made the journey from Burma to Malaysia, often via Thailand, during the 2010-2011 sailing season.</p> <p>\"They are often loaded out to sea and, though some are in better condition than others, they are all packed,\" she said.</p> <p>Refugees pay between $1,700 (\u00a31,000) and $2,000 for a place but usually only put down a $400 deposit.</p> <p>Experts say the crisis is rooted in ethnic and religious tensions that were suppressed during nearly 50 years of brutal military rule.</p> <p>Hand grenades were thrown on Sunday night at two mosques in Karen state in the east of the country, causing no casualties, domestic media reported.</p> <p>Some of those now fleeing their homes were Burmese Muslims from the officially recognised Kaman minority. \"It's the first time that we've seen the Kaman targeted. That's very worrying,\" said Mabrur Ahmed, of Restless Beings, a UK-based human rights group.</p> <p>The UN estimate there are 800,000 Rohingya in Burma. Although many have lived in the country for generations, they are considered illegal immigrants and face widespread hostility.</p> <p>In June President Thein Sein suggested the best solution to the violence was that the UN resettle Burmese Rohingya outside the country.</p>",

That was the platform for a brief take on how fantastically Americans respond to adversity. But he said nothing about the government's relief response nor did he touch on the questions dogging him about a statement he made last year saying he would scrap the Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema) which has led the post-Sandy recovery efforts and drawn praise from New Jersey's Republican governor, Chris Christie.</p> <p>But former Florida governor Jeb Bush did weigh in at the Romney rally. He said his thoughts and prayers are with those enduring Sandy's destruction but then, in what sounded a little like one upmanship, he reminded the crowd that in 2004-5 Florida was hit by eight hurricanes and four tropical storms. And that, from his experience, \"local level and state level\" is better at handling the response than Fema. The crowd liked that, a lot.</p> <p>Romney played to his crowd in part of the country where Hispanic voters could decide the issue with a promise to boost trade with Latin America, saying it's economy is a big as China's and that it doesn't cheat as much.</p> <p>And Florida's role in the space programme prompted a familiar, lengthy story about Romney, the Boy Scouts and a flag on the space shuttle Challenger when it blew up. The flag survived. The crowd aah-ed. Romney managed not to mention that the space programme is government funded. It was among the more effective parts of a speech that was long on railing against corporate tax rates and working with Democrats as governor of Massachusetts to cut spending</p> </blockquote> <p>Nice to hear <strong>Jeb Bush</strong> criticise the federal government when under the aegis of his brother George, which it would have been in 2004-05.

Here's the background to Romney's visit:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Romney is back on the campaign trail after Hurricane Sandy intruded, making three stops in Florida where he's likely to be closely scrutinised as to how he handles the politics while Obama is being presidential and supposedly above it all in New Jersey.</p> <p>Romney's been doing his best to steer clear of questions about remarks he made at a debate last year in which he said that as president he would scrap the Federal Emergency Management Agency which is at the forefront of the post-Sandy recovery efforts. Romney hasn't been helped by the Republican New Jersey governor Chris Christie's praise for Obama and FEMA during the crisis.</p> <p>Still, Romney has good reason to get back to campaigning, particularly in Florida where his substantial bounce after Obama's disastrous first debate performance has evaporated. Polls put the Republican candidate up to seven percentage points ahead a month ago but a New York Times survey on Wednesday has the president back in front, even if only by one point.</p> <p>If Romney doesn't take Florida, there's little chance of him winning the election.&#xa0;Outside the first stop at a Tampa aircraft hangar, a Romney opponent taunted supporters arriving for the rally by marking Halloween dressed up as a Republican Grim Reaper ready to slay Obamacare. The crowd mostly ignored the cries of \"Happy Halloween\" and deathly cackle.</p> </blockquote> <p>Interesting that former governor Bush is appearing with Romney today \u2013 and not current Republican governor <strong>Rick Scott</strong>.

  "<p>Here's a sentence I wish I hadn't written \u2013 it rolled out of my Macbook in May, part of an <a href=\"http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/global-warmings-terrifying-new-math-20120719\">article for Rolling Stone</a> that quickly went viral:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"Say something so big finally happens (a giant hurricane swamps Manhattan, a megadrought wipes out Midwest agriculture) that even the political power of the industry is inadequate to restrain legislators, who manage to regulate carbon.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>I wish I hadn't written it because the first half gives me entirely undeserved credit for prescience: I had no idea both would, in fact, happen in the next six months. And I wish I hadn't written it because now that my bluff's been called, I'm doubting that even Sandy, the largest storm ever, will be enough to make our political class serious about climate change. </p> <p>Maybe I'm wrong, though. Maybe \u2013 just maybe \u2013 the arrival of a giant wall of water in the exact middle of the financial and media capital of our home planet will be enough to get this conversation unstuck. Maybe that obscene slick of ocean spreading unnaturally into the tubes and tunnels of the greatest city on earth will shock enough people to change the debate. New York Governor <a href=\"http://statepolitics.lohudblogs.com/2012/10/30/cuomo-we-have-a-new-reality-when-it-comes-to-these-weather-patterns/\">Andrew Cuomo, at a press conference Tuesday afternoon</a>, allowed as how:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"There has been a series of extreme weather incidents. That is not a political statement, that is a factual statement \u2026 Anyone who says there's not a dramatic change in weather patterns, I think, is denying reality.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg added:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"What is clear is that the storms we've experienced in the last year or so around this country and around the world are much more severe than before.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Truthfully, I think I'd just as soon see statements like that as carefully thought-out endorsements of climate science. It's experience that changes people: the summer's drought left more than half of American counties as federal disaster areas, and meteorologist Jeff Masters estimates Sandy hit 100 million Americans with \"extreme weather\". Add in the largest forest fires in Colorado and New Mexico, the hottest month in US history, and the completely absurd summer-in-March heatwave that kicked off our year of living sweatily, and you can begin to understand why the percentage of <a href=\"http://www.usclimatenetwork.org/hot-topics/climate-polling\">Americans worrying about global warming has spiked sharply this year</a>. Spiked high enough that even a few politicians are willing to speak out.</p> <p>Not many. The presidential candidates avoided the topic at all their big public forums \u2013 except for Romney's Republican national convention joke about how silly it was to try and slow the rise of the oceans (which probably didn't win him many votes on the Jersey Shore this week). Obama did talk climate with MTV last week, but that venue almost defines the issue's fringe status; his other real discussion of it was with Rolling Stone \u2013 global warming is, apparently, only for people with earbuds.</p> <p>They barnstormed through the hottest summer on record, and they didn't seem to notice. One appreciates cool in a president, but there's a limit.</p> <p>If Sandy, however, begins to give a little opening for discussion, we're unfortunately at the point where we have to force the discussion. After 20 years of inaction, we're so far behind the curve that we've got to raise the bar higher than mere acknowledgement that we've got a problem. We've got to get some action from these guys.</p> <p>And that, I think, requires a truly crucial set of changes. We need to neutralize the force that's kept them quiet. It's not that our politicians didn't know about climate change: I've watched, for two decades, as the world's best scientists make the annual trek to Capitol Hill to lay out the latest data. It's that, as scary as those charts and graphs were, the fossil fuel industry was scarier still.</p> <p>As the richest industry on earth, and the biggest political player, the boys from coal and oil and gas have bought one party and terrified the other. Last week \u2013 in the very final days of the US election \u2013 Chevron smacked down the single largest corporate donation in the Citizens United era, <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/election-2012/wp/2012/10/26/chevron-donates-2-5-million-to-gop-super-pac/\">$2.5m to a GOP Super Pac</a>. There's not a congressman who didn't notice, and who didn't think: what if they came after me with ten days to go?</p> <p>If we're going to change the political equation, we're going to do it by going after the fossil fuel industry. They deserve it. As that Rolling Stone article of mine laid out, they're planning to burn literally five times more carbon than the most conservative government on earth thinks is safe. They've turned into a rogue force.</p> <p>Which is why <a href=\"http://www.350.org/\">350.org</a> sent out an email blast today, raising money for the Red Cross and raising <a href=\"350.org\">signatures for a petition</a> to oil execs asking that they stop their campaign donations and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/oct/30/superpacs-superstorm-sandy-disaster-relief\">spend the money repairing New York instead</a>. And it's why we launch <a href=\"math.350.org\">a road show</a> next week. We'll go to 20 cities in 20 nights, trying to spark a movement for divestment from fossil fuel stocks, and a new willingness to stand up to the industry. It starts next Wednesday in Seattle, and we'll do it no matter who wins the White House next Tuesday night.</p> <p>Because as important as elections are, they're not the biggest battle.</p>",
  "<p>After ballroom dancing, ice-skating, singing, cooking and sending them to live in a jungle, viewers could be forgiven for thinking there was nothing television executives had not asked celebrities to do. Think again.</p> <p>ITV1 is hoping to make a splash with a new reality show in which celebrities learn how to dive under the expert tutelage of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/aug/12/tom-daley-diving-bronze-gold\" title=\"\">Olympic bronze medallist Tom Daley</a>.</p> <p>The peak-time show, which has the working title Splash!, promises \"spectacular and hilarious prime-time fun\". It remains to be seen just how high the board will be, or how low the bar will be set to qualify as a \"celebrity\".</p> <p>Contestants will be asked to perform a dive each week live on television in an Olympic-sized swimming pool.</p> <p>Daley said it had been a \"wonderful 2012 ... What better way to round it off by becoming involved in this great new show; a dream come true for me \u2013 an entertainment show all about diving.\"</p> <p>\"I'll be helping the celebrities as they master a dangerous and exciting sport and I can't wait to get started,\" he added.</p> <p>The show will feature a panel of expert judges, with the viewing public voting for their favourite celebrities. The identities of the contestants have not yet been revealed.</p> <p>As ever with reality shows of this sort, the prospect of the contestants making fools of themselves will be at least as much of a draw as the potential for a perfect 10. Plus, viewers will get to see celebrities in their swimwear.</p> <p>The ITV director of entertainment and comedy, Elaine Bedell, said \"Splash! promises thrills, spills and a touch of comedy as famous faces take to the celebrity diving board.\"</p> <p>The format for the show originated in the Netherlands \u2013 where it was called Sterren Springen \u2013 and the rights have already been bought by broadcasters in the US, France and Australia.</p> <p>Some of ITV's most successful shows are reality formats featuring celebrities outside of their comfort zone, including Dancing on Ice and I'm a Celebrity, Get Me Out of Here!.</p> <p>But the broadcaster has also suffered a number of conspicuous flops in the genre, including <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/organgrinder/2006/nov/24/ripcelebrityloveisland\" title=\"\">Celebrity Love Island</a>, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQh4SbFZhYQ\" title=\"\">Celebrity Wrestling</a> and <a href=\"http://uk.imdb.com/title/tt0481486/\" title=\"\">Celebrity Shark Bait</a>, a 2005 show in which actor Richard E Grant (among others) came face to face with a great white.</p> <p>Mark Borkowski, an entertainment PR and branding specialist, said: \"It beggars belief, you can't make some of these things up.</p> <p>\"There is a greater pressure on broadcasters now to come up with shows that will connect and generate a big social media campaign. There was a lot of buzz after the Olympics, which generated all these contemporary icons, and arguably people do want to see more of Tom Daley on TV.\"</p> <p>BBC1's Strictly Come Dancing jumped on the Olympics bandwagon, casting cyclist Victoria Pendleton and gymnast Louis Smith in its latest series, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/oct/29/strictly-come-dancing-x-factor?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+theguardian%2Fmedia%2Frss+%28Media%29\" title=\"\">helping it to a ratings win over ITV1's The X Factor</a>.</p> <p>The challenge for the new ITV show will be that dives last a few seconds, unlike a waltz on Strictly Come Dancing, or the tortuous \"bushtucker trials\" presided over by Anthony McPartlin and Declan Donnelly on I'm a Celebrity, Get Me Out of Here!.</p> <p>The makers of the original Dutch version of the show more than compensate for this by contestants <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RRPu0bm4Ams&amp;feature=relmfu\" title=\"\">taking an age to reach the board \u2013 invariably accompanied by Tina Turner's Simply the Best \u2013 and countless replays of their often disastrous dives</a>.</p> <p>Some viewers could be forgiven a sense of deja vu. Channel 4's reality show The Games, a sort of celebrity Olympics, featured a diving round and a <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aubW4CaGaKY\" title=\"\">memorable belly flop by comedian Bobby Davro</a>.</p> <p>It remains to be seen whether Davro will be tempted back to improve on his score, or whether ITV would want him.</p> <p>The broadcaster is keeping tight-lipped about the lineup as well as the exact format of the show, or even what Daley will be asked to do. He is expected to take some sort of presenting/judging role on the show which will be given a weekend slot.</p> <p>Jeff Goldman, the co-managing director of Eyeworks Distribution, which owns the format, said: \"We look forward to now bringing it to UK, and especially with ITV and Tom where we think it is the best home for audiences to enjoy its mix of fun, suspense, daredevil stunts and touch of humour all centred around the beauty of diving and inevitably making Splash! a hit in the UK.\"</p> <p>The show will be produced for ITV1 by independent producer Two Four Television, the company behind shows including BBC1's pre-Olympics documentary Tom Daley: Diving for Britain and The Hotel Inspector.</p> <p>Two Four managing director Melanie Leach said: \"This show provides all-star family entertainment that everyone can enjoy and will no doubt feature those special moments that everyone will be talking about.\"</p> <p><em>\u2022&#xa0;To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.

All are headlines that have appeared recently in the UK press, despite it now being almost a decade since the Press Complaints Commission first heard from charities on why coverage like this should stop. And despite it now being almost a decade since the PCC issued guidance to address what it agreed was widespread inaccurate reporting.</p> <p>These headlines and others like them fail a simple test \u2013 substitute a reference to asylum status for the words \"black\" or \"Jewish\" and you begin to see why it is both irrelevant to the story and discriminatory towards the group if not the individual portrayed.</p> <p>But why does this matter? And why does it matter so much right now?</p> <p>On 6 July 2011, David Cameron, facing widespread public revulsion over the extent and depth of the News of the World phone-hacking scandal, announced the public inquiry into the culture, practices and ethics of the British press.</p> <p>Few could have predicted quite what Lord Justice Leveson's investigations would unleash over the following months; neither the political and personal dramas played out for the world to see, nor the stream of revelations seeming to lead inevitably to the conclusion that something, somewhere, in the way our newspapers are regulated is broken and must be fixed.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.redcross.org.uk/\" title=\"\">The British Red Cross</a> is not an organisation you might expect to be following these developments closely. We work on a daily basis with reporters that refuse to ignore the plight of people in crisis \u2013 in our own country and overseas \u2013 raising awareness of important issues and the work that we do.</p> <p>But while it may not be our place to take a view on what kind of regulatory framework should supplant the PCC in the coming months, we will be awaiting the publication of Leveson's findings \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/oct/30/leveson-report-late-november\" title=\"\">expected in the next few weeks</a> \u2013 with great interest.</p> <p>The 2003 PCC guidance ruled that the phrase <a href=\"http://www.pcc.org.uk/news/index.html?article=OTE=\" title=\"\">\"illegal asylum seeker\"</a> is inaccurate. The guidance also addressed the confusion between asylum and immigration and explains why it is not appropriate to describe asylum seekers as \"illegal immigrants\".</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.redcross.org.uk/About-us/News/2012/October/Call-to-set-record-straight-on-refugees-and-asylum-seekers\" title=\"\">Yet in an independent poll commissioned last month by the British Red Cross</a>, 72% of respondents said newspaper reporting about asylum seekers and refugees is negative. The poll also revealed widespread confusion between the terms \"refugees\", \"asylum seekers\" and \"illegal immigrants\" and suggests what the public most readily associate with media coverage of refugees are words such as \"scroungers\".</p> <p>The sort of coverage we regularly see unfairly stigmatises individuals and undermines the very institution of asylum. We hear from politicians willing in principle to support our calls for an end to the vagaries of a system that leaves many destitute \u2013 but feel unable to do so for fear of a media backlash and a loss of public face.</p> <p>We also see the effect of associations made in print between those that seek asylum and criminality, and a tainted public perception of the many very decent people we encounter in our work.</p> <p>Clearly the PCC guidance hasn't worked. What we would like to see is a number of small but important measures that address accuracy and fairness of reporting; with protection against discriminatory and immaterial references to asylum status in much the same way that the current code ensures reporting that is blind to race and religion.</p> <p>Instead of a regulatory code that depends upon those personally and individually slighted making a complaint, we would like to see more proactive monitoring of standards. And we feel it only right that unfair representation of groups of people can be adequately challenged.</p> <p>The Red Cross movement's unique position under the Geneva Convention means we have a duty to support those fleeing persecution. In 2010, just under 18,000 asylum applications were made in the UK and 3,480 were eventually accepted as refugees under what are relatively narrow and often hard to prove legal criteria. Not exactly the cascade suggested by much of the coverage we have seen.</p> <p>Many of the 10,000 refugees and asylum seekers we work with on an annual basis have incredible stories of tragedy and heroism to tell. Often those finally granted indefinite leave to remain can be among the most patriotic and loyal British citizens it is possible to find.</p> <p>Most individual journalists fight to tell stories that are factually and ethically robust in the face of significant pressures. But at the same time as enshrining press freedom and the upholding of the public interest, it should be possible for whatever Leveson's report ushers in to raise everyone's game on an issue of basic humanitarianism.</p> <p><strong><em>Adrian Thomas is the British Red Cross head of external relations</em></strong></p>",
  "<p>I am in a state of shock and feeling low, but the last thing I want is for someone to try to cheer me up.</p> <p>Having spent the last three weeks on the road in the US and Turkey soaking up the latest news on sustainability, there is not a lot to be positive about.</p> <p>I spoke to climate scientists, business leaders and activists, and the challenges we face appear even more gargantuan then I had thought and, by comparison, progress on addressing them infinitesimal. And that's before superstorm Sandy struck the eastern board of the US.</p> <p>Getting up close and personal to what is going on around us is something we all could do with, because without the emotional connection to what is happening in the world \u2013 it can just feel like a string of words, easy to dismiss.</p> <p>What triggered the dark feeling inside me on this occasion was speaking to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/blog/polar-arctic-greenland-ice-climate-change?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">Michael Mann, the respected American climate scientist</a> whose work contributed to the 2007 Nobel peace prize, and since coming back to the UK, Hugh Montgomery, director of the UCL <a href=\"http://www.ucl.ac.uk/medicine/human-health-and-performance\" title=\"\">Institute for Human Health and Performance</a> at University College London. Mann told me that the speed of ice melt is so great that vulnerable low-lying island states may have to be evacuated within a decade \u2013 far quicker than anyone had imagined.</p> <p>This is disastrous, but islands such as Tuvalu in the Pacific feel distant in my mind, both physically and emotionally. The havoc in New York feels closer, as I love the city and know it well.</p> <p>What really shook me up is when Montgomery raised the spectre of people starving in this country within 20 years as climate change disrupts global food supplies. Did I hear him right? In the UK?</p> <p>I have been to Africa and seen severely malnourished children and adults for myself. But somehow in my mind that's different from thinking about it up close and personal in Sussex or Nottinghamshire.</p> <h2><strong>False cheer doesn't help</strong></h2> <p>The reason I don't want someone to come along and try to make me feel better is because I know it's important to sit in this difficult place. It's not that I want to get stuck in this feeling of helplessness and grief, but I have to go to the heart of this feeling in order to burn through it.</p> <p>I remember telling a friend contemplating suicide how wonderful he was as a person and how much he had to offer. I recognised my mistake. What he truly needed was someone who could just sit with him in that place of deep pain and hold the door open to another path.</p> <p>So how best to deal with the numerous sustainability challenges we are facing?</p> <p>False cheer does not help. Having spent time in America, there is enormous optimism on the surface and a denial of the myriad of dysfunctions lurking beneath the surface. The fact that climate change did not even deserve a mention in the presidential debates is testament to this.</p> <p>I recently interviewed Giles Fraser, the former canon of St Paul's Cathedral in London, who quit for his refusal to evict the Occupy movement. He believes one reason for our level of denial is a fear of our own mortality.</p> <p>Referring to the recent financial collapse, he said: \"There weren't enough truth tellers and actually it's the idea that somehow there is a virtue in that sort of heady optimism and you're being a misery guts \u2013 negative \u2013 by being pessimistic. The truth is a real discipline and it's actually quite difficult to face the reality.</p> <p>\"In a hundred years time we'll all be dead. They're all like 'oh don't, that's a miserable thought, that's a bit depressing.' No it's not actually. It's a fundamentally liberating thought because it's about focusing what it is for us to be humans and it's not unrelated to all the stuff about growth because it's about limit. There is such a thing as limit that makes us who we are and I think what's happened with the sort of hubris that capitalism has encouraged, is it has persuaded us that there is no limit.\"</p> <p>But how do we get the balance right to not come across as doomsayers that will just make us give up altogether?</p> <h2><strong>Finding the middle way</strong></h2> <p>The best answer I can come up with is the middle way. Face up to the truth but also have an action plan.</p> <p>As a trained executive coach, I have worked with a number of clients. Invariably the moment comes when the person I am working has a lightbulb moment. Recognising the heart of the issue they are faced with and its cause, they then turn to ask \"but what can I do about it?\" This is a fundamentally important moment. If the client cannot see a way forward, this can quickly lead to a fundamental loss of hope.</p> <p>Nic Marks, who created the <a href=\"http://www.happyplanetindex.org/\" title=\"\">Happy Planet Index at the New Economics Foundation</a>, also recognises this. He told me: \"One of the things that I would be critical of in the environmental movement is that they haven't really created a positive vision about the future. They have instead just painted the worst case scenario and talked about what the disasters are and that's very good for grabbing attention but fear is not the best motivator of people. It makes people run away.</p> <p>\"What we now see is climate change scepticism increasing as the science base increases, so what's happening is people are mentally fleeing the problem because they're frightened. It's too difficult, it's too big to deal with, so they'd rather believe it doesn't exist and that scientists have got it wrong.</p> <p>\"So I think we have to work very, very hard to have a positive vision about the future \u2013 like an approach goal. All the sports psychologists know this \u2013 you have to have approach goals to motivate people and keep going and we need to motivate business, cities, nations to move towards a sustainable future.\"</p> <h2><strong>A lesson from the medical profession</strong></h2> <p>Montgomery, who is also a professor in intensive care medicine at UCL, knows more than most about the most effective way to approach people who are facing life-threatening illnesses.</p> <p>He too believes the most important first step is to tell the truth: \"There is a message in these sorts of issues that you can't tell people bad news and I've always felt that was erroneous,\" he says. \"The idea was that you had to sell the new world that was safe from climate change, sell the positive message that came with it and I felt that was duplicitous and a bad idea.</p> <p>\"If you tell people that something isn't dangerous, that's what they hear and I don't tell my patients something isn't dangerous or they're not at risk of dying. I tell them exactly that and then I try to say let's find a way through this, let's find a way out of it. And we haven't been honest I think in telling people that this is an imminent catastrophe for them and their children and that's somehow been lost.</p> <p>Montgomery adds: \"I think we can learn a little bit from other public communications. I mean if you look at any of the big appeals there's no shying away from showing people the brutal truth but what is immediately followed up with is now you can do something, just phone this number or here's your way to engage.\"</p> <p>If only Sandy were to wake up the two American presidential candidates to the error of their ways.</p> <p><em>The full filmed interviews with Hugh Montgomery, Nic Marks and Giles Fraser will be appearing on Guardian Sustainable Business over the next few weeks </em></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by </strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/guardian-professional\" title=\"\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

  "<p>No inter-family feud has captured the American public imagination quite like that fought along the West Virginia-Kentucky border <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hatfield%E2%80%93McCoy_feud\" title=\"\">between the Hatfields and the McCoys</a> in the 1800s. Spanning three decades, it resulted in lawsuits, pitched battles between the clans, 12 deaths and a mythology that continues to this day.</p> <p>Channel 5 airs the second episode of Hatfields &amp; McCoys, History's glossy three-part retelling of the tale tomorrow: Kevin Costner stars as Anderson \"Devil Anse\" Hatfield, patriarch of the West Virginian Hatfields, while Bill Paxton plays Randall McCoy, his opposite number across the border in Kentucky. The whole thing seems strangely archaic. Today, the dispute would probably be played out on Jeremy Kyle \u2013 Hatfield and McCoy sitting glumly as Kyle berated them for being scroungers and hillbillies.</p> <p>Because whether historic or modern, TV loves nothing better than two families squaring up to each other. They have long captured the attention of viewers: with the best feuds often living on long after their broadcast dates as a shorthand for interfamily warfare.</p> <p>Also set in Kentucky, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2012/jun/21/justified-season-three-finale\" title=\"\">Justified</a> offers a contemporary take on the Hatfields and McCoys: with the Bennett and Givens families locked into a dispute that runs back to prohibition. When the bootlegging Bennetts were busted by agents, they presumed it was the Givens who tipped them off \u2013 and ever since, the shootings, beatings and leg-breaking dished out have become a way of life. As Raylan Givens tells Dickie Bennett: \"This is who we are. This is who we've always been.\"</p> <p>That's exactly the kind of depressing fatalism and misguided family loyalty that drives a good feud. And there are few finer examples than <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/tv-and-radio/dallas\" title=\"\">Dallas</a>'s Barnes-Ewing feud, kicked off by Willard \"Digger\" Barnes, who dated the young Miss Ellie in the 1930s, before she married his former partner Jock Ewing to save Southfork Ranch. The wedding created a grievance that has lasted generations: the torch passed on by irrepressible Cliff Barnes and cackling supervillain JR Ewing. Pamela Barnes marrying Bobby Ewing was a historical opportunity for the beef to be squashed \u2013 an opportunity Cliff and JR completely ignored, swinging at each other like two drunks at a bar throughout the show's 14 seasons. The dispute is still going strong in <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/tv-and-radio/2012/sep/04/dallas-return-stetsons-dawn\" title=\"\">the new reboot</a>.</p> <p>With two big characters at its heart and a historical slight as the backdrop, the Barnes-Ewing feud had a sense of inevitability. And you could say much the same of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/tv-and-radio/game-of-thrones\" title=\"\">Game of Thrones</a>' Stark-Lannister conflict. The Starks, hailing from the frozen North, are well attuned to the savagery of nature, eking out an existence in the harshest environments. The Lannisters, in contrast, are synonymous with wealth, privilege and the arrogance of the ruling class in the warmer south.</p> <p>The volatile combination of their fundamental differences and fiery noble blood guarantees war \u2013 so when Jaime Lannister is caught in a compromising position with his twin sister by the young Bran Stark, it sets off a chain of events that lead to imprisonment, execution and a full-scale battle between the houses. This is feuding families on a grand scale.</p> <p>You won't find much noble blood in the London borough of Walford, but soap demands conflict, and the Beales and the Mitchells have managed to keep the hate fires burning on points of principle too obscure for outsiders \u2013 or sometimes even regular EastEnders viewers \u2013 to fathom.</p> <p>While Kathy Beale's stormy marriage to Phil Mitchell may have been the catalyst for the trouble, their rows were just an entr\u00e9e to what would follow. Grant Mitchell's affair with Ian Beale's girlfriend Jane didn't help matters \u2013 and neither, surprisingly, did Aunty Pauline's constant sniping at Peggy Mitchell. But it has been Phil and Ian who proved to be the dark heart of this particular squabble. Admittedly, given how annoying Ian can be, it has often felt as though Phil's multiple assaults on him, including one memorable restaurant set-to that ended with Ian's head down a toilet, have been largely well-earned. But Phil has often proved equally irritating: between the snide Thatcherite Beale and the arsonist adulterer Mitchell in this battle, whoever loses, the viewer wins.</p> <p>Conflict is the essence of drama and something about rival families at war taps into the voyeur in us. Whether it's Ned Stark's head on a spike or Ian Beale's head down a toilet, we can't take our eyes off people at their worst, locked mindlessly in the cycle of war, doing it all for the family.</p> <p>So who would you add to our list \u2013 and has Hatfields &amp; McCoys made it on to your must-watch viewing?</p>",

The rebel Free Syrian Army have been hesitant to enter Christian districts as there is not that much support for them in these areas.</p> <p>In general the Christians districts are in the centre of Aleppo and the FSA still hasn\u2019t reached the centre. </p> <p>Lots of Christians were in the opposition before the outbreak of the revolution. Most of them were members of the Communist party and Syrian pan-Arab parties. Many joined the Damascus declaration movement in 2005 which called for democratic change in Syria.</p> <p>At first Christians in Aleppo were hesitant to join the protests because it was unclear what would happen, and they felt insecure. Others still feel that the Assad government provides stability, security and some form of freedom.</p> <p>Four months ago, the Armenian community formed a security militia in Aleppo that co-operates with the Syrian army. Armenians believe that the revolution is supported by Turkey so they are against it. Others Christians in the city are opposed to this militia.</p> <p>More than 200 Christians activists have been arrested in Aleppo. But most were later released with the help of the influence of pro-regime Christians.</p> <p>Some Christians fighters have joined the FSA brigades, but there is not an exclusive rebel brigade of Christians in Aleppo.</p> <p>I think the revolution has given Christians hope in Syria. Christians have suffered since the Ba'athists came to power. Christians used to own vast lands in Syria, all of them have been confiscated by the regime and nationalised.</p> <p>I think Christians can guarantee their position by taking part in the revolution. They can be one of the sects who form a new regime.</p> <p>I would prefer to protest peacefully, but if we are forced bear arms, I will do so. If the regime stops bombing the cities, the revolution will become peaceful again. I have devoted myself to the revolution and I know I might be killed or detained at any time.</p> <p>There are lot of informants including Christians who report activists to the regime. Many of my friends were threatened if they continue to protest, they were told their mothers or sisters would be raped. I was summoned for interrogation at the political security branch in Aleppo. It was a psychological terror. There were endless questions like 'why are you criticizing the regime? What is upsetting you of the regime?'

As in Libya, and unlike in Iraq, intervention would enable the rebellion, not be a substitute for it.</p> <p>In military terms, this would be achieved by establishing a 50-mile no-fly zone along the Turkish-Syrian border. No allied aircraft would need to fly in Syrian airspace, as air-to-air and surface-to-air missiles fired from Turkish airspace and territory would have the necessary range to shoot down Syrian bombers or helicopters in the exclusion zone. Allied AWACS radar aircraft, operating well out of range of Syria\u2019s extensive air defences, would provide full real-time information on any regime aircraft approaching the no-fly zone.</p> <p>The zone would include Aleppo, which means the regime\u2019s bombardment of Syria\u2019s largest city would cease. Its fall, along with unimpeded access to logistical support from Turkey, would give the insurgency the upper hand.</p> </blockquote> <p>Former <a href=\"http://www.peacefare.net/?p=11869\">US diplomat Daniel Serwer is sceptical</a>. Writing on his blog Peacefare.net he says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Safe areas are target-rich environments that will attract the murderous instincts of the Assad regime. If you want a no-fly zone, it will have to be far wider than 50 miles and enforced with active patrols, as we did in Iraq. That means destruction of Syrian air defenses, and continued willingness to destroy them on a daily basis.</p> <p>Heisbourg is also hoping the Americans will rouse themselves from inaction after the November 6 election. I doubt it. More arms may flow then to the Syrian rebellion, but people in Washington is really worried about empowering more <em>jihadi </em>in ways that we will come to regret. \u201cFast and furious\u201d in the Middle East could be a lot more serious than in Mexico.</p> <p>The best bet for a decent outcome of the Syrian rebellion is a negotiated exit of Bashar al Assad, followed by an internationally supervised transition.</p> </blockquote> <p>Emile Hokayem, senior fellow at IISS, says Heibourg's proposal for limited no fly zone <a href=\"http://www.thenational.ae/thenationalconversation/comment/arm-syrian-rebels-to-make-a-political-solution-possible#ixzz2AsTEk5mL%20\">\"is proving too much for risk-averse western and Turkish policymakers\"</a>.</p> <p>And, a paper published by the Brookings Doha Centre last week said there <a href=\"http://www.brookings.edu/~/media/Research/Files/Papers/2012/10/18%20losing%20syria%20shaikh/18%20losing%20syria%20shaikh.pdf\">\"few supporters in Nato and Washington for collective efforts to </a><br><a href=\"http://www.brookings.edu/~/media/Research/Files/Papers/2012/10/18%20losing%20syria%20shaikh/18%20losing%20syria%20shaikh.pdf\">establish humanitarian zones and no-fly zones\"[pdf]</a> . It said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There have also been renewed attempts to muster support for \u201cno-fly zones\u201d; the establishment or protection of \u201csafe areas\u201d or \u201cbuffer zones\u201d along Syria\u2019s borders to protect civilians and rebels under attack from the <br>regime\u2019s aircraft; and even for Arab armies to intervene in Syria as they did in Lebanon in 1976.</p> <p>Such initiatives to protect civilians are long overdue, but the problem is that those who have been advocating them (a handful of regional powers and France) do not have the capabilities to undertake such costly and risky operations. With the United States, Russia, China, and the other emerging BRICS unable to agree even on a legal basis for such intervention, Assad knows that a more forceful international response is unlikely.&#xa0;</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-10-31T13:18:28.808Z\">at 1.18pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5091051f95cb49410b863bb1\" class=\"block is-summary\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-31T11:01:51.425Z\">11.01am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Palestinian refugees form Syrian rebel brigade</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><a href=\"http://uk.reuters.com/article/2012/10/31/uk-syria-crisis-idUKBRE89T0KK20121031\">Syrian rebels claim they have formed a brigade of sympathetic Palestinians in a Damascus district to fight armed Palestinians aligned with President Bashar al-Assad</a>, Reuters reports.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>About 150,000 Palestinian refugees live in the Syrian capital's Yarmouk camp, a sprawling area of concrete apartment blocks, where some residents support the 19-month-old uprising against Assad and others fight alongside Syrian soldiers.</p> <p>\"We've been arming Palestinians who are willing to fight ...

The National Guard, who arrived shortly before midnight on Tuesday night, after a call from the city's major Dawn Zimmer for help, are currently doing sweeps of the flooded areas. They are picking people up and bringing them to the emergency shelters, city authorities told the Guardian a few moments ago.</p> <p>A message on the city's official <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/Hoboken?fref=ts)warns\">Facebook page warns</a>&#xa0;residents not to go outside. It reads: \u201cMultiple National Guard trucks will be coming through flooded streets, first to evacuate those with true medical emergencies. Keep an eye out, go down to the lowest possible floor, but do not go outside. Signal to get their attention.\u201d</p> <p>More than 20,000 people are trapped in their homes, according to reports, without power for the third day running as many parts of the city remain under several feet of water. Residents are being urged to stay inside for safety reasons as the water has live wires and is contaminated with sewage. More than half the population of 50,000, are without power, according to <a href=\"http://www.hobokenhorse.com/\">a city website</a>.&#xa0;Water is not expected to recede for 24-48 hours.</p> <p>The mayor sent out a call on Twitter asking for local volunteers to report to City Hall at 10am on Wednesday. Two shelters have been set up on Hudson Street, and people are being asked for blankets, pillows and other items to help make the evacuated more comfortable.</p> <p>Hoboken's Facebook page has become a message board for residents and their relatives, desperate for contact with each other as well as for information.

Virgin protested, and said it would take the government to court, the government held firm, and then when McLoughlin took over from Justine Greening as transport secretary in September the whole process was scrapped. McLoughlin laid the blame \"fairly and squarely\" on DfT officials, suspending three of them.</p> <p>McLoughlin is also expected to be asked why he told MPs when he appeared before the committee in September that he was happy with the bidding process, and then scrapped it a few weeks later.</p> <p>On Monday the transport secretary published the initial findings of the report he set up to look into the whole affair, led by Sam Laidlaw. It said the DfT had been \"aware of a lack of transparency\" in an aspect of the franchise process but had decided to continue \"and to accept the risk of a bidder challenge\", the Press Association reports.</p> <p>The Laidlaw report also said the companies bidding for the franchise were not provided with adequate information, the DfT did not follow its own guidance, and the evaluation of the financial robustness of the bids was \"developed late, in a hurry and without proper planning and preparation\".</p> <p>Laidlaw said the DfT had undergone staff reductions and frequent changes of leadership, and organisational changes and the department's structure \"resulted in a lack of clarity around allocation of responsibility\" for the bidding competition. These factors raised \"potentially significant issues about the ability of the DfT effectively to conduct rail franchise competitions\".</p> <p>The government is now in discussions with Virgin about its continuing to run services for up to 14 months until an interim franchise competition is held before a competition for a full franchise.</p> <p>The route is the busiest in the country and runs from London through Birmingham and Manchester to Edinburgh.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-90011906-284d-4b81-9b8c-f4f0323fc874\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/31/1351691652148/a32e2bbf-a85a-4b29-b7b5-31d1c7cf0682-460.jpeg\" alt=\"A Virgin train passing a First Group train on the west coast mainline.

But does anyone really believe this is not, as David Cameron said, simply \"rank opportunism\" from Labour, who as a rule have been pro-EU for decades? Miliband's position makes for great tactics - this afternoon's vote will certainly put the government in a difficult position - but as genuine practical policy it's unconvincing.</p> <p>However, Miliband did come out with a new attack line which may get some traction: \"He is weak at home, he is weak abroad - it's John Major all over again.\"</p> <p>Miliband was also on stronger ground regarding Lord Heseltine's growth report, which attacks much government policy. After Miliband read out a Heseltine quote implying that the government had no strategy for growth or wealth creation, Cameron's reply that actually the former DPM thought the coalition was roughly on the right track was almost satirical. And the Davey/Hayes wind farms row meant it was a great day for Miliband to be able to quote Heseltine's specific point about the government not having a coherent energy policy. Cameron had no real answer to that, and looked evasive. </p> <p><strong>Verdict: a draw.</strong></p> <p>PS John Bercow, the Speaker, proved yet again how much of a stickler for the rules he was by telling the PM and other MPs off for breaches of parliamentary etiquette. But he does seem to be allowing Cameron to stick to his slightly childish vow not to answer any more questions from Chris Bryant until Bryant has apologised to him. I remember Tony Blair saying at his last PMQs: \"I think I'm really not bothered about that one,\" but that was just before he walked out the door. Will Bercow let Cameron continue to snub Bryant's questions? </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uZYINkajlY\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/0uZYINkajlY?start=179&fs=1&feature=oembed&wmode=opaque&start=179\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>  </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-50911a4e95cb49410b863bc9\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-31T12:32:43.092Z\">12.32pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>That's it.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-50911a1fb57986a0fe1d49b9\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-31T12:31:27.857Z\">12.31pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Jim Dobbin (Lab) is asked about upcoming child benefit cuts for high earners.

The Tories are said to accept the boundary changes will now be delayed until 2015, but they are surprised Lib Dems are backing a delay until 2018.

  "<p><strong>\"I was recently digging up the history of many cup tournaments and I found out that in </strong><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1979%E2%80%9380_Copa_del_Rey\" title=\"\"><strong>1980 Real Madrid played their reserve squad in the final of the Copa del Rey</strong></a><strong>,\" </strong>wrote Svilen Tomov <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/oct/24/player-fastest-distance-race\" title=\"\">last week</a>. <strong>\"Is this the only occurrence anywhere, or has it happened more than once?\"</strong></p> <p>Not that we know of, Svilen, but there have been a few close misses. First, though, let's take a look at that remarkable cup run of Castilla CF, Real's reserve team. They began with two-leg wins over Extremadura, Alcorcon (who a couple of years ago <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2009/oct/27/real-madrid-alcorcon-copa-del-rey\" title=\"\">embarrassed the full Madrid side</a>), and Racing Santander before taking on the big boys of La Liga.</p> <p>H\u00e9rcules (who finished 15th in the top flight) were beaten first, then Athletic Bilbao (seventh), Real Sociedad (runners-up) and finally Sporting Gij\u00f3n (who came third behind Sociedad and Real) in the semi-finals. In the final the Real first team put the upstarts \u2013 featuring a young Ricardo Gallego, who would go on to win 42 caps for Spain and feature at the 1982 and 1986 World Cups, in their ranks \u2013 firmly in their place with a 6-1 hammering.</p> <p>The adventure wasn't over, though. With Real winning the title, Castilla became Spain's entrants in the 1980-81 Cup Winners' Cup, the only reserve side ever to compete in European competition (at least until English sides started fielding theirs in the Uefa Cup). It was a brief but eventful campaign. In the first round they beat a West Ham side including Trevor Brooking <em>et al</em> 3-1 at the Bernab\u00e9u, but violence at the game meant the return leg was played behind closed doors. The Hammers won 3-1 in 90 minutes and the 262 spectators who had somehow crept into Upton Park saw David Cross score twice in extra-time to complete his hat-trick and <a href=\"http://www.rsssf.com/miscellaneous/castilla-ec.html\" title=\"\">send the English side through 6-4 on aggregate</a>. (Footage of the second leg with, oddly, crowd noise seemingly dubbed on top, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1I2HGJXeLI\" title=\"\">can be seen here</a>.)</p> <p>The club closest to matching Real's feat is the Swedish side Orgryte. \"Until 1925, the Swedish championship was decided in a knock-out tournament. In 1897 the reserves of Orgryte IS reached the final for the first time, losing 0-1 to the first team,\" reports <a href=\"http://rsssf.com/\" title=\"\">the ever-excellent rsssf.com</a> promisingly, only to put something of a damper on things by adding: \"This was, however, not much of a feat, as there had been no other entries.\"</p> <p>Ajax's second team were just a penalty shootout away from meeting their first XI in the 2001-02 Dutch Cup final, reports Tom Adams on Twitter. Having beaten De Graafschap in the third round, Twente in round four and Telstar in the quarter-finals, Ajax II's cup run came to an end against Utrecht in the last four, 7-6 on penalties after a 2-2 draw. (It was quite a young side that Ajax II had back then: Maarten Stekelenburg, Petri Pasanen, Abubakari Yakubu, Jelle van Damme, Steven Pienaar, Nigel de Jong, Wesley Sneijder, Michael Krohn-Dehli, Cedric van der Gun, Jason Culina, Johnny Heitinga and Tim de Cler all featured at various points in the season).</p> <p>Austria Vienna had a very similar tale to Ajax in the 2008-09 Austrian Cup, with the reserve team beaten by FC Admira in the semi-finals while the first XI went on to win the tournament.</p> <p>Also close were Hertha Berlin in the 1992-93 German Cup, but it was the first team that, ahem, let the side down. Hertha were dumped out by Bayer Leverkusen in the round of 16, but their reserve team battled all the way to the final, where <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1993_DFB_Cup_Final#Final\" title=\"\">they were also beaten by Bayer</a>. And also deserving of a mention are Sparta Prague B, who reached the Czech Cup semi-finals in 1970-71 having beaten the Sparta first team in the quarter-finals.</p> <p><em>More on some of the football world's best reserve sides can be found </em><a href=\"http://www.rsssf.com/miscellaneous/reserves.html\" title=\"\"><em>here</em></a><em>.</em></p> <h2>FOOTBALL'S GREATEST MARATHON RUNNERS (2)</h2> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/oct/24/player-fastest-distance-race\" title=\"\"><strong>Last week</strong></a><strong> we thought that the former Leicester City player Muzzy Izzet might be the tidiest footballing marathon runner, finishing the 2011 London Marathon in 3 hours and 22 minutes.</strong></p> <p>Not so, says Martin Axon, who sent in a link to the story of the former Exeter City utility man Barry McConnell's 2011 charity run from John O'Groats to Lands End, in which it was revealed that his best marathon finish was a spritely two hours and 58 minutes. Last summer Truro, where McConnell had been playing since 2008, gave him time off from pre-season training to complete the length-of-Britain challenge in aid of the Adam Stansfield Foundation.</p> <p>\"I don't really think that the pre-season running sessions that I would be doing quite compare to this,\" said Barry, who was proved horribly right by a knee injury that forced him to abandon the run after 126 miles, somewhere near Inverness. \"I was forced to stop, I had terrible pain in my right knee,\" he explained, having run 30 miles on the swollen joint the day before. \"I feel disappointed and devastated that I couldn't continue.\" There was some suggestion that he might try again further down the line, but we've not been able to find anything. Give us a bell if you know otherwise.</p> <p>\"Former Spanish internationals Luis Enrique (ex Sporting Gijon, Real Madrid and Barcelona), Emilio Amavisca (Racing Santander, Real Madrid) and Iv\u00e1n Helguera (Racing Santander, Real Madrid) all deserve a mention,\" reckons Dermot, who cites numerous marathons and Ironman competitions. Indeed, he <a href=\"http://miticosdelbalompie.blogspot.com.es/2009/02/futbolistas-en-otros-deportes-luis.html\" title=\"\">included this link</a>, which describes the lengths Luis Enrique went to (geddit?) in his post-football career. Having run his first marathon in three hours and 14 minutes, he dipped under the three-hour mark a couple of years later by completing the Florence marathon in 2 hours, 57 minutes and 58 seconds. He completed the Marathon des Sables (151 miles across the desert) in 2008 and is scheduled to take part in the Cape Epic (a 400-odd mile, two-person mountain bike race) early next year. We've pulled our hamstrings just thinking about it.</p> <p>\"As you might not recall, the Danish international striker Miklos Molnar decided to hang up his football boots at the age of 30, in favour of some running shoes, to start a new career as an Ironman competitor.\" This from Martin Mathiasen. \"He ran the 2005 Copenhagen Marathon in 2:59:20, although I suppose he has the distinct advantage of actually training for these things, compared to the other footballers.\" True enough, though the former Liverpool defender Sami Hyypia could do no better than three hours and 56 minutes in last year's Helsinki marathon, as Mikko Knuuttila emailed in to tell us.</p> <p>There's half-marathon news, too! Ian Rogers dug out his old copies of Shoot! to find reference in Kevin Keegan's columns to an appearance at the first Great North Run in 1981. According to the race's Hall of Fame, Keegan suffered a wardrobe malfunction about six miles in. \"Eleven year old Eddie Hope and his brother had been waiting on the roadside to see their idol, and he ended up swapping his running shoes with his hero, as the ones [Keegan] was wearing gave him blisters. Despite the trainers, Kevin finished in an impressive one hour and 26 minutes.\" Which makes him a good 23 minutes faster than Paolo Di Canio.</p> <p>Finally, we also received an email from TEN Sports' very own Joe Morrison, explaining that his studio colleague and pundit Trevor Sinclair ran the London marathon in 3 hours and 33 minutes earlier this year. \"So he tells me,\" notes Joe.</p> <h2>DELIBERATE OWN GOALS</h2> <p><strong>Last week we looked at the players to have scored deliberate own goals (</strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/oct/24/player-fastest-distance-race\" title=\"\"><strong>featuring 149 in one match</strong></a><strong>) in protest against their club, their manager or the referee. And though this email doesn't exactly fit the bill, it's an enjoyable yarn nevertheless:</strong></p> <p>\"Austria's greatest football coach ever, Ernst Happel, loved to score own goals during his playing days against his team-mate and close friend Walter Zeman,\" writes J\u00f6rg Michner. \"Both played for Rapid Vienna and the Austrian national team, Happel being a defender and Zeman obviously a goalkeeper. When Rapid was crushing the opposition, as they often did in the 1940s and 50s, Happel used to get bored at the back and occasionally took the ball, scored an own goal and taunted Zeman: \"Lucky for you I didn't hit you in the head or else you'd be dead,\" he would shout in broad Viennese at his keeper. When Austria was preparing for the 1954 World Cup against a local selection in Innsbruck, at the scoreline of 14-0 a bored Happel put the ball in his own net from 20 metres out.\"</p> <h2>KNOWLEDGE ARCHIVE</h2> <p><strong>\"There's a story doing the rounds at my local that Blackpool once resorted to using a flamethrower to thaw out their frozen pitch,\" </strong>wrote Bill Winkles back in 2007. <strong>\"Would I be right to think it's total guff?\"</strong></p> <p>Well Bill, it's not quite true, but it is closer to reality than you might imagine. The winter of 1962-63 was extremely harsh, and Blackpool suffered more than most as their pitch completely froze over to the point where they couldn't play a single home game between 15 December and 2 March. Some players even took to ice skating on the pitch, as revealed by the following gem, dug out of the West Lancashire Evening Gazette's archives by Seasiders historian Gerry Wolstenholme:</p> <p>\"At Bloomfield Road Jimmy Armfield and Tony Waiters ice skated on the pitch on 8 January 1963 and two days later they were joined by Barrie Martin, 'Mandy' Hill and two other players. On 29 January 1963 Blackpool used a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disc_harrow\" title=\"\">disc harrow</a> to try to get the game against West Ham United played on 2 February 1963 but that too proved ineffective and on 30 January 1963 the players swept a heavy fall of snow from the pitch in a vain hope that it would be clear underneath, but the ice \u2013 one to four inches thick \u2013 was 'as formidable as ever'.\"</p> <p>But it was actually Norwich who attempted, unsuccessfully, to defrost their playing surface with fire. Their scheduled FA Cup third-round tie at home to Blackpool had been postponed 11 times, and, as the same piece of archive reveals, they were willing to try just about anything by the end. \"In an attempt to get the game played, the Carrow Road pitch was treated with flamethrowers on 22 January 1963 as, according to a Norwich spokesman, 'a last desperate effort'. However they 'served no purpose whatsoever' for 'as fast as the ice melted it froze again'. An icebreaker was also used but it too proved ineffective.\"</p> <p><em>For thousands more questions and answers take a trip through </em><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/series/theknowledge\" title=\"\"><em>the Knowledge archive</em></a></p> <h2>Can you help?</h2> <p>\"In a game that was remarkable for a number of reasons, Theo Walcott was credited with goals on 45, 90 and 120 minutes for Arsenal against Reading in the League Cup, surely the only hat-trick ever scored entirely outside regulation time (including the extra half-hour - the last goal was 120+0:02),\" writes Joe Ludlam. \"Has anyone else matched or even come close to such a statistical freak?\"</p> <p>\"Sunday's game between River Plate and Boca Juniors was delayed by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/gallery/2012/oct/29/boca-juniors-river-plate-superclasico-pictures#/?picture=398509856&amp;index=4\" title=\"\">River fans holding aloft a giant inflatable pig wearing a Boca shirt</a>,\" writes Kevin Downey. \"Is this the first time a match has ever been delayed by an inflatable?\"</p> <p>\"Have there been any instances of spouses taking medals and similar football honours as part of the proceeds from a relationship with a footballer?\" asks Prashant Maharaj. \"If so, who is the most decorated former partner of a footballer?\"</p> <p>\"It seems like Russian clubs have a lot of Brazilians in their squads,\" begins Kai Helge Aalhus. \"In the match between Shakhtar Donetsk and Chelsea I counted 10 Brazilian-born players among the 36 players on the pitch and bench.

These penalty kicks, however, all derived from the same penalty. Arias blocked Universitario's first attempt to score, but he was deemed to have prematurely left his line, and the penalty was retaken. The second attempt was also saved but retaken for the same reason. Finally, his third save on Universitario's third try was deemed valid.

But between its pandering tackiness, and its polemical grandstanding on behalf of its own supposedly realist aesthetic (it starts out with a newspaper editor on his way to a restaurant called Balzac's, and devotes many pages to ridiculing non-representational art, that dreaded threat to mankind), it leaves you with the feeling that if this is what a novel is, then maybe it really is time to move on.</p> <p>The aim, squarely Victorian, is to \"do\" Miami in full cross-section: vertically from city hall to the projects, and horizontally through the principle ethnicities and subcultures \u2013 Cubans, Haitians, Anglos, Russian billionaires, Jewish retirees.</p> <p>There's a political storyline fuelled by the antics of a ripped young rooky cop, Nestor Camacho, who keeps inadvertantly triggering near-riots in various sectors of the population as his well-intentioned acts of derring-do \u2013 rescuing a would-be Cuban immigrant from the top of a mast; tackling an enormous African American crack dealer \u2013 are subjected to the warping media misrepresentation inevitable in a city where, as Wolfe would have it, \"everybody hates everybody\". The buttons here \u2013 race, immigration, drugs, gangs \u2013 are hot, and Wolfe pushes them frantically, but also perfunctorily, building his dramas with so little regard for plausibility it's hard to believe he really cares a damn about the issues themselves (certainly not in the sense that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/jul/20/television.irvinewelsh\" title=\"\"><em>The Wire</em></a>, for example, cared about Baltimore's). And beyond some touristic local colour (\"somehow all the little bakeries and diners in Hialeah used only white bags\") there's little indication he cares much about the physical textures of Miami either. At any rate, this aspect of the book falls completely flat.</p> <p>Then there's a more anthropological storyline, having to do with art, sex and status, and rigged around the question of whether some abstract paintings endowed by a certain Sergei Korolyov to the city's new art museum, and allegedly worth $70m, are in fact fakes. The linchpin in this plot is Camacho's one-time girlfriend Magdalena, all curving lips and breasts and \"perfect lissome legs\", who dumps him to trade up, first to her celebrity sex-therapist boss Norm Lewis and then to Korolyov himself. Relentlessly mean-spirited as this piece of the plot is (its key image is a photo secretly taken by the manipulative Lewis, showing the herpes-measled genitalia of a rich patient he is currently exploiting for his high-society connections), its themes do at least seem closer to Wolfe's heart, and they produce some correspondingly livelier passages, particularly in the second half of the book.</p> <p>The first half, however, is uniformly awful. There was a time when Wolfe's sharp eye and acid tongue seemed the perfect instruments for conveying the everlasting face-off between elite and street that generates so much of the theatre of American life. But in <em>Back to Blood</em> those instruments have largely been replaced by a megaphone.</p> <p>Where he once dissected, he now merely amplifies. Italics, repetition, exclamation marks, screaming caps, have become his stylistic mainstays, supplemented by laboriously spelled-out sound effects and foreign accents. \"He could just see the lubricants and spirochetes oozing into the crotches of their short short-shorts! Short short short-shorts! Sex! Sex! Sex! Sex! \u2026\" goes a typical passage. Things aren't ugly, they're \"uuuuuuug-lyyy\". A man can't just laugh, he has to go: \"AahhhuhwaaaAHHHHHock hock hock hock\" \u2013 repeatedly. Then there's the gleefully in-your-face stereotyping: thuggish Russians, indignant Cubans, kvetching Jewish <em>yentas</em>; the flaccid emphasis of \"He was a classic Americano \u2026 very proper-looking. Over-the-top proper\"; the lazy tautology of people seeing even themselves as stereotypes: \"He himself realised that Edward T Topping IV was white Anglo-Saxon Protestant to the maximum, to the point of satire\". And there's the thought-bubble inner life of the characters (Wolfe has patented a surpassingly annoying typographic device for conveying this \u2013 six sets of colons either side of a character's private observation, ie: \"::::::This place is a real piece of work!::::::\"). No doubt all this is knowingly, deliberately, \"mimetically\" crass, but so what? That doesn't amount to insight or irony, just crassness squared.</p> <p>Of course, you can forgive a book almost anything \u2013 clich\u00e9s, bad jokes, even transcribed Russian accents (\"Zey speak no Engleesh \u2026\") \u2013 if it takes you somewhere new and interesting. I can't claim <em>Back to Blood</em> does that, but about halfway through I noticed I wasn't writhing in quite such agony any more.</p> <p>It's a little hard to account for this, but I think it's partly a matter of Wolfe's determination to give you your money's worth, whether you want it or not. Never one to risk a lull in the tempo, he contrives to build the book almost entirely out of climaxes and set-pieces. There's a floating orgy, a scene of billionaires mobbing each other at Art Basel in Miami, a skanky strip club episode, a lavish party being filmed for reality TV, any number of trips to fancy mansions and exclusive islands, and then all the cop business \u2013 the drug bust, live action rides on marine patrol boats, standoffs between the mayor and the chief of police \u2026 The scenes read more like sequences from <em>Miami Vice</em> or <em>Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous</em> than anything out of Balzac or Gogol (name-checked by another restaurant). But what they lack in literary quality they make up for in a kind of attritional persistence. It's a very American, full-on, quantity-based concept of entertainment (you find it at amusement parks and certain restaurant chains). The stuff just keeps coming at you, and after a while something in you accepts it as a form of plenitude, however ersatz, and you succumb \u2013 or half-succumb.</p> <p>But it's also, more interestingly, a matter of the book's little kernel of real animus gradually revealing itself through the clutter of scattershot mockery. The two ingenues, Camacho and Magdalena, may be the official protagonists, but the governing sensibility is that of Lewis, the sex therapist. Simultaneously lecherous and revolted by the flesh, misanthropic and status-obsessed, contemptuous of Miami's glitterati while desperate to join them, he gives the book's fundamental moral incoherence \u2013 its prurient fascination with everything it purports to despise \u2013 a plausibly human face. We recognise this type of scrofuluous, self-regarding cynic, and we get a sneaky kick out of watching him in action, just as we do with Thersites in <em>Troilus and Cressida</em>.</p> <p>His big scene, leering and sneering his way through a floating party at the Columbus Day Regatta, where nubile co-eds bump and grind under a porn movie projected gigantically on a sail, is too atrociously written (\"THRUST the turgid crotch of his trunks in her buttocks RUT rut rut rut\") to qualify seriously as the apocalyptic vision of \"where Man is headed!\" that it purports to be. But in some of the later, smaller episodes, especially the ones built around the art world, Lewis's presence inflames routine caricature into something more interestingly pathological. The billionaire \"maggots\" crawling all over the pornographic art on sale at Art Basel; the naked avant-gardiste whose show, <em>De-fucked</em>, consists of her pulling lengths of sausage out of her vagina, are not subtle (Michel Houellebecq's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/fiction/9780434021406/the-map-and-the-territory\" title=\"\"><em>The Map and the Territory</em></a> covered similar ground with incomparably greater intelligence) but they give off an authentic biliousness.</p> <p>And that, finally, is what the book has to offer. Not a compelling portrait of a city. Not real satire, which requires some modicum of wit. Certainly not proof of the half-baked premise of tribal regression alluded to in its title: \"it's back to blood! Religion is dying \u2026\" No, if <em>Back to Blood</em> has anything going for it, it is a quality of unusually pure bile \u2013 an enraged loathing and envy for just about everything. It doesn't save the book, but it commands a certain grudging respect.</p> <p>\u2022 James Lasdun's <em>It's Beginning to Hurt</em> is published by Vintage.</p>",
  "<p>One of the most attractive aspects of the older politician, as Lord Heseltine perhaps needs to be described at the age of 79, is that they do not care too much what other people say about them. Another joy is that they have an institutional memory. Long forgotten and little read official reports into local government reorganisation published back in 1969 remain at their finger tips. Little is new under their sun, making it a good deal harder for a civil servant to pass off bromide as initiative.</p> <p>Both in interview, and in his blockbuster report into the absence of a coherent government growth strategy, Lord Heseltine glows with both strengths. Few features of public life, government bureaucracy, private sector managers, chambers of commerce, civil servants, Tory ideologues, local councillors, timewasting planning officers or self-serving financiers are spared the lash in his report spanning 226 pages and more than 80 recommendations.</p> <p>His conversation is also replete with references to previous doomed attempts to reorganise local government, create industrial strategies or galvanise Whitehall.</p> <p>In an eloquent personal opening passage he admits that the very words \"industrial strategy\" are controversial. \"With them comes the baggage of past attempts and past failures,\" he says.</p> <p>He also recalls how it is 57 years since he left Oxford University for London, how his first view as a businessman was that all he wanted was to get government off his back and then how his experience in government so tempered that view.</p> <p>The complexities of local government reform, the planning system. Britain's role in space, the saving of Rolls-Royce, Concorde, defence procurement, the international competitiveness agenda all made him confront the way in which other national governments, unlike Britain, aided and abetted their wealth creators.</p> <p>His views on the role of government were never so simple again.</p> <p>But that leads to the question of why David Cameron ever asked an interventionist such as Heseltine to conduct such a wide-ranging review of government growth strategy. After all, Cameron's previous favourite peer from the Thatcher era had been Lord Young of Graffham, a man who broadly believed government was a problem, not a solution.</p> <p>In interview, surrounded by two ferociously bright civil servants, Heseltine says few should be surprised by the scope or contents of his report. He explains it was Steve Hilton (Cameron's former director of strategy and a fellow Whitehall iconoclast) who \"fixed for me to see the prime minister with a view to do something broadly like this, and I outlined the view I broadly hold. The prime minister said this was something he wanted done, and would I report to the Chancellor George Osborne and to Vince Cable?\"</p> <p>It was not an invitation from the blue. Cameron had asked Heseltine to speak to the Tory conference in 2006 on city mayors, an idea that has for the moment stalled. Despite his advancing years Heseltine had been chosen by Cameron to chair the advisory committee on the regional growth fund.</p> <p>Cameron was also happy to give him an official from each department, including the Treasury.</p> <p>Little has escaped his unflinching gaze: skills policy, airport expansion, the appointment of permanent secretaries, immigration, or foreign company takeovers and finance for industry. \"I think it has been a unique experience and I think from the very beginning everyone knew of the scale of what I was doing.\"</p> <p>He knows his report will, to use one of Cameron's favourite phrases, put \"rocket boosters up Whitehall and industry\".</p> <p>\"If you want a sit rep for the status quo, well stay where you are. Will Britain become more competitive? Answer no. It is not rocket science. We ought to recognise that every other capitalist economy on Earth has adopted a local bottom-up strategy \u2013 maybe we should try it too, if only for the simplest possible reason is that it is what made this country in the first place. London did not drive the national economy in the 18th and 19th centuries, it was driven by the great buccaneer cities of the industrial revolution.\"</p> <p>Asked whether he is confident his blueprint will be implemented, Heseltine says: \"I travel with more than hope. The government is committed to localism. I am not countering government policy. I am saying 'Good, let us have another leap.'\"</p> <p>His central proposal, and perhaps biggest leap, is a plan to reorder government to make it focus on industrial growth. At the apex of this structure would be a national growth council responsible for a growth strategy, leading to further sub-growth strategies department by department, setting out how each Whitehall department will hold dialogues with its relevant industrial sectors.</p> <p>He then proposes taking \u00a349bn currently administered by central government departments, and putting this cash, plus \u00a39bn in EU funding into a single funding pot.</p> <p>The cash covers skills, local infrastructure employment support, new housing, business support services and innovation. Local enterprise partnerships, the bodies bringing together local businesses and councillors to drive growth, would be expected to bid for this cash in what he sees as a big extension of localism, or regionalism.</p> <p>He says precedents for this include the work of Howard Bernstein in Manchester with Goldman Sachs, Heseltine's own work in Liverpool and plans by Lord Adonis to galvanise the north-east economy.</p> <p>He insists the 39 Local Enterprise Partnerships (LEPs) set up by this government can be made to work, and that high-quality entrepreneurs do want to be involved in them, so shaping their city economy. He explains: \"At the moment they don't think there is an opportunity do a man-size job on these bodies and in the present circumstances, and I would agree with them.\"</p> <p>He recognises some secretaries of state may be reluctant to hand this cash into the single pot, saying: \"That is what 100 years of impoverishing the provinces have done. It is perfectly conceivable if the prime minister wants it. That is what localism is about.\"</p> <p>He accepts that 39 LEPs as may need to change their boundaries to better fit the local economic shape, and suggests Whitehall and LEPs have three months to discuss if their confines need adjusting.</p> <p>He insists that LEPs are currently shaped broadly to match city regions, the future engines of growth, pointing out that they do broadly match the boundaries set out by John Redcliffe-Maud in the late 1960s, and then rejected by the Heath government of 1970-74. He insists he is not imposing unitary councils on local government; just suggesting they are the preferred option. There are a dozen unitary councils already and they save \u00a315m a year, he points out.</p> <p>He insists he is not proposing a throwback to the era of the national economic developments councils attempted in the 60s and 70s, saying: \"Those were tripartite talking shops. They had no money. I was part of it. It was ridiculous. People turned up with their prepared statements and the conversation was designed to get nowhere.\"</p> <p>He adds that he is not interested in accusations of corporatism or picking winners, two of the phrases that have been successfully deployed by free marketeers to keep the state and industry apart. He said: \"There is an army of people in Whitehall picking winners every day. When they gave me \u00a32.4bn to spend on a regional growth fund what I am supposed to do? Pick losers?\"</p> <p>Nor will he bow at the altar of deregulation. \"Civilisation depends on regulation. The market will not regulate itself. The market knows no morality. If you allow the law of the jungle, you will get the consequences of the jungle, so governments of all persuasions create the basis of civilisation, which is stopping people doing terrible things at the extreme. You just have to get the balance right.</p> <p>\"The simple solution to growth \u2013 'get off our backs, cut taxes, deregulate' \u2013 but you would not find that solves the problem because no other government finds that it does solve the problem. Those three sentiments may have a contribution to make, but they are so simplistic.</p> <p>\"Confidence is the thing holding back the economy at the moment and who can blame anyone from feeling so. There are no signs yet that there is a way through it \u2013 maybe now just a bit \u2013 and that is we do not have the confidence to invest.\"</p> <p>Whether all this emerges to be Heseltine's last will and testament, patronised as a throwback to a failed corporatist era and so doomed to be of interest to historians, or instead the start of a new era of industrial activism, it will be for Cameron, or a future government to decide. Either way, the jungle is a richer place for having such big beasts on the roam once again.</p>",
  "<p>Lord Heseltine will on Wednesday deliver an explosive critique of the government's economic policy when he publishes a six-month study commissioned by Downing Street that dismisses deregulation as the sole path to growth and lambasts Whitehall for the lack of a coherent state led industrial strategy.</p> <p>In a no-holds-barred report, the experienced former Conservative cabinet minister warns \"continuing as we are is not an acceptable option\", adding \"the message I keep hearing is that the UK does not have a strategy for growth and wealth creation\".</p> <p>His iconoclastic proposals call for a major restructuring of local government and handing \u00a358bn of Whitehall cash to city-based engines of growth, co-ordinated by businesses and local councils.</p> <p>Among some ministers there was incredulity that David Cameron had asked such an interventionist figure as Heseltine to compile a report into every aspect of Britain's low growth.</p> <p>The Tory peer told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that he had huge admiration for the government over its decision to commission a report from him, and said the chancellor, George Osborne, had backed the initiative.</p> <p>\"You have to be very strong and very confident to ask admittedly a very long-standing friend and supporter to look at what you're doing and suggest how you could do it better,\" Heseltine said.</p> <p>Heseltine said the government was doing an \"extremely good\" job but that there were things that could be done \"further and faster\" than presently as he pressed the need for \"urgency\" in stimulating growth.</p> <p>He said he had \"told it as I see it\" and was braced for resistance from some parts of Whitehall that feared losing some of its power base.</p> <p>Heseltine said the fact that the published report appeared well-received by the union and business lobby alike underlined the \"one nation\" narrative he attributed to Cameron.</p> <p>\"I have had nothing but encouragement from the prime minister, from the chancellor and I've got baggage, they know my views, so there was bound to be in the report things that they've said, 'Oh my God, he's off again.' OK fine, but if I had done less than that, if I had tried to avoid the difficult issues, tried to sort of paper over anything that might be called a criticism, you people would say, 'What a waste of time, why did he bother to do all of that?'\"</p> <p>He added: \"So I've told it as I see it but I've told it in a way that is very supportive of the opportunity this government has got. And if I may make what I think is quite an important point: the prime minister talks of 'one nation', no one believes that more passionately than I do. We've produced a report that is supported by the CBI and the TUC. If that isn't a platform one which you can talk bout one nation, I don't know what is.\"</p> <p>The report, originally commissioned at the initiative of Cameron's then-strategy adviser Steve Hilton, challenges government policy on a vast range of specific issues such as a third runway in the south east, immigration, a wider public interest test to block foreign company takeovers, skills, and the structure of both central and local government.</p> <p>In remarks directed at Osborne that will be greeted with delight by the Liberal Democrats, he says the private sector will not invest in energy infrastructure \"without real certainty about the UK's long-term energy policy\".</p> <p>He will also infuriate the Tory right by rejecting crude deregulation or tax cuts as the fast track to prosperity, saying \"the principal void in today's investment climate is confidence \u2013 and tax changes will have only a limited effect on that\".</p> <p>He says: \"I reject the notion that regulation in itself hinders growth. Good, well-designed regulation can stop the abuse of market power and improve the way markets work to the benefit of business employees and consumers.\"</p> <p>Calling for a long-term industrial strategy, Heseltine says he does not \"believe the current structures do enough to enable the government to work together coherently to drive through the change required\".</p> <p>He added: \"Whitehall continues to approach these issues from the individual policy priorities of different departments as if economic issues can be effectively addressed in a placeless vacuum.\"</p> <p>Heseltine has consulted government ministers closely during the preparation of the report, but in an attempt to underline his independence he has largely kept the conclusions from ministers, briefing the business department only on Monday.</p> <p>Osborne is bound to find some of the remarks in the report difficult to digest, although its criticisms of Whitehall and the planning process will be welcomed.</p> <p>The communities secretary Eric Pickles strongly opposes a local government reorganisation.</p> <p>Heseltine is careful to endorse the government's deficit reduction strategy, but the wider criticisms in the report condemning the absence of a clear credible growth strategy have been seized on by Labour just weeks before an Autumn Statement that is likely to contain another downgrading of UK growth forecasts.</p> <p>Rachel Reeves MP, Labour's shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, said: \"It's a damning indictment of this government that, halfway through this parliament, a former Conservative cabinet minister is still calling for a plan for growth.</p> <p>\"Since the spending review two years ago we've had growth of just 0.6% compared to the 4.6% growth George Osborne said he would deliver. And the result of the government's failure is that families are worse off, long-term unemployment is rising and borrowing is going up.\"</p> <p>In possibly his central proposal, Heseltine suggests nearly \u00a348bn of current government cash earmarked for growth over four years in different Whitehall departments should be placed in a single funding pot for local areas. He proposes adding nearly \u00a39bn of EU funding to the pot, saying current spending of this EU cash is bureaucratic and inefficient.</p> <p>He suggests the 39 local enterprise partnerships (LEPs), the government's chosen engine of local economic growth, then bid for this pool of cash which would be diverted permanently from budgets of departments.</p> <p>But he criticises the current quality of LEPs that replaced the regional development agencies, calling for them to be strengthened saying \"they currently do not have the authority or resource to transform their locality\".</p> <p>On local government, he complains England has 353 principal authorities, some unitary and some operating as two tiers with district and county councils, a structure, he describes as \" baffling and bears no relation to modern economic activity\". Legislation preventing councils becoming unitary authorities passed by the government should be repealed, he says.</p> <p>Heseltine also suggests city mayors, largely rejected by referendums in May, should be appointed without the need for a local plebiscite. He complains that the government approach to empowering local economic communities has been complex and piecemeal. The government, he says, has \"been prepared to dip its toe, or several toes, in the water but not yet prepared to accept the full logic of its position with the confidence it should\".</p> <p>Turning to Whitehall he calls for a new national growth council chaired by the prime minister, a body that sounds similar to the national economic council set up by Gordon Brown, but abolished by the government. The council would publish a national growth plan, linked to departmental reports, and approve LEP bids for funding.</p> <p>He concedes the business department has published industrial plans but dismisses them, saying, \"put crudely, who has heard of them or changed their behaviour as a consequence?\"</p> <p>He adds: \"There is a powerful appetite in the business world for the government to lay down a vision for how we will achieve long term prosperity in the UK and a plan to ensure its implementation through all departments\".</p> <p>He complains that in the regions, \"disparate teams of civil servants from different departments are not working in a cohesive way\".</p> <p>He also lambasts departmental business plans as \"not being fit for purpose\", and says Whitehall has no management information system in place to allow ministers to know \"what their civil servants do, how much it costs, who authorised it what output measures have been set or, crucually, whether they are being met\".</p> <p>Setting out a timetable for the government to implement his plans, Heseltine says: \"Some will say there are criticisms. That is exactly the wrong approach. To invite criticism is a sign of strength, to accept it is a sign of confidence.\"</p>"
