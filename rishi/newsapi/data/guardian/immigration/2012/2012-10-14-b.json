  "<p>Cabinet Office proposals to expand the use of secret courts will create a \"secret justice system straight from the pages of a Kafka novel\", an Amnesty International report will warn on Monday.</p> <p>The report claims that proposals to extend the use of secret evidence will enable the government to \"simply play the 'national security' card whenever it wants to keep things secret\".</p> <p>The civil liberties organisation is calling on the coalition government to abandon its justice and security bill, which introduces so-called 'closed material procedures' (CMPs) into the main civil courts in England and Wales.</p> <p>The<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/law/2012/sep/25/secret-courts-the-essential-guide\" title=\"\"> procedures \u2013 already used in security tribunals \u2013 allow sensitive intelligence to be presented to a judge by officials</a> while preventing victims, or claimants, from knowing the allegations against them in full. No date has been set for the bill's next stage in the House of Lords when peers will vote on the controversial measures.</p> <p>Labour, which says it remains \"unconvinced\" of the need for reform, is asking for extra time to be made available for debate, the Guardian understands.</p> <p>Amnesty's report, Left in the Dark: the use of secret evidence in the UK, estimates that CMPs are already used in 21 different legal contexts \u2013 including appeals against the imposition of highly restrictive Terrorist Prevention and Investigation Measures [the successor to control orders], and national security deportation proceedings at SIAC, the Special Immigration Appeals Commission.</p> <p>It poses \"a real threat to the principles of fairness and open justice in the UK\", Alice Wyss of Amnesty said.</p> <p>\"It's already bad enough that secret procedures have been allowed to creep into the justice system but the government is now trying to extend secret justice to an unprecedented degree.\"</p> <p>The report includes interviews with a number of those who have experienced secret justice and still cannot be named. G, a 43-year-old who has been subject to detention under threat of deportation to Algeria over a 10-year period, said: \"I want justice: the opportunity to defend myself, in a fair trial \u2026 I am not even allowed to know the evidence the state claims to have against me.\"</p> <p>Another man, known only as BB, who has been before SIAC, said: \"The case against me? It's just a glimpse I've seen. I've never seen enough things for me to explain anything. The closed hearings, I can't go in, my lawyer can't go in.\"</p> <p>The Amnesty study concludes that relying \"on secret evidence presented to a judge behind closed doors, [runs]&#xa0;\u2026 directly counter to ordinary principles of fairness long-recognised in UK law and fundamental to international human rights standards.</p> <p>\"For people caught up in these secret procedures the consequences can be profound, from being deprived of their liberty, to being separated from their family to be returned to a country where they are at real risk of serious human rights violations&#xa0;\u2026 Despite the serious consequences at stake, closed material procedures make it incredibly difficult for individuals faced with the secret evidence to effectively respond to the government's case.</p> <p>\"Closed material procedures inevitably fail to properly respect principles of open and adversarial justice&#xa0;\u2026 If the justice and security bill becomes legislation in its current form it risks normalising a procedure which can result in violations of the right to a fair trial and the right to effective remedy for victims of human rights violations.\"</p> <p>The government argues that the use of secret courts will not result in any cases currently heard in open session going behind closed doors and enable national security disputes that are at present settled to be contested in court.</p> <p>A Cabinet Office spokesman said: \"The point Amnesty have missed is that currently no one, not the claimant, not their lawyers, nor the judge, can take into account or rely on national security-sensitive evidence.</p> <p>\"The result is that cases collapse and we never get to the bottom of serious allegations made against the state.</p> <p>\"The justice and security bill will fix this problem by allowing the national security evidence which is excluded under current rules to be heard in a closed procedure.</p> <p>\"Closed justice is never ideal but it is better when the alternative is silence.\"</p>",
  "<p>It's not exactly what you would call sticking it to the Man, but I did save myself a premium rate phone call and a few bob in subscriptions by not watching the Audley Harrison fight at the weekend. Boxing has its own channel now, BoxNation, where for a small fee you can watch pasty-faced Eastenders, or African-Americans you have never heard of, knocking seven bells out of each other any hour of the day or night, and Audley was their big attraction on Saturday night, fighting David Price for the British and Commonwealth heavyweight title.</p> <p>As a consummate professional, I felt I ought to be among those present and set about accessing it, but they needed my Sky viewing card number which would have meant taking the card out of the digital box just as the rest of the family was gathered round the set for Strictly Come Dancing and those other Saturday night family bonding programmes that have replaced the sing-song round the piano we enjoyed when I was a lad \u2013 or would have had we had a piano.</p> <p>Also, with a lot of these subscriptions the onus is on the subscriber to cancel, and I never get round to it. As a result there are direct debits on my bank statement that are a complete mystery to me. I really do not need my monthly copy of Philately and Philatelist, having given up stamp collecting some 50 years ago, and I could probably do without MUTV as well.</p> <p>Still, if you were ever curious about what political and general world views underpinned the stylish midfield play of Scottish international and Manchester United legend Pat Crerand, the channel enlightened us this week. They're running a programme called The Football League Files, in which Jim Rosenthal looks back at the history of the world, much like Andrew Marr, but with more focus on United.</p> <p>This week it was 1970, and Jim took us back to the aborted Apollo 13 space mission, on which Crerand's views were sought: \"I was always interested in the space race because I'm a great believer we're not the only ones,\" said the elegant wing-half whose ball distribution played a big part in United's&#xa0;successes in the early 1960s. \"I think there's people out there somewhere, and one of the reasons they don't make connection with us is because we're always killing each other.\"</p> <p>Paddy added that 1970 was also notable for Ted Heath's election as prime minister, \"which I wasn't happy about\". Who knew? That was a tight election, as I recall, and if Crerand had made his views known at the time, he could maybe have swung it.</p> <p>The mind was free to concentrate on such issues, with no top-flight football at the weekend. I hate those weekends: no Match Of The Day, no Ray Stubbs on ESPN with his little grey goatee beard, nothing much to laugh at at all. It is not even as if England are fun to watch, especially against teams like San Marino, where collectively they remind one of someone struggling to get into a packet marked \"tear here\" but with no proper perforations, eventually resorting to a pair of scissors \u2013 or Andy Carroll, in the case of England.</p> <p>(Mark Lawrenson, also sporting a little grey goatee \u2013 is this some charity thing I have missed? \u2013 said on Football Focus that San Marino \"should be in their own group with the Liechtensteins\", who I remember as a charming couple who ran a small delicatessen round the corner from us.)</p> <p>And so, in the absence of MOTD, to the boxing on Channel 5, who got lucky with their European super-middleweight title fight between James&#xa0;DeGale and Hadillah Mohoumadi.&#xa0;Mohoumadi is the French champion, which I gather is about as significant as being Albania's top crown green bowls player, but 5 promised us he would give DeGale a decent fight and,&#xa0;unusually for boxing, this was not just hype.</p> <p>Not that the night was entirely free of the bombast fight game fans love. Profiled before the contest, DeGale asked: \"What does the future hold for me? This maybe sounds big, but: Greatness.\" Boxers, eh, you can't help liking them.</p> <p>Tyson Fury is another British boxer not greatly troubled by self-doubt, and Channel 5 was fortunate enough to catch him in the crowd for some inter-round chit-chat \u2013 or not, depending on how active m'learned friends are in the area of banter between boxers. Despite reminders he was \"live on Channel 5\", Fury was uninhibited in his assessment of Harrison's conqueror, David Price: \"You see, you plumber from Liverpool, it's personal between me and you, and I'm going to do you some serious harm, you big stiff. They're going to need 10 plumbers to do you up, when I've finished with you.\"</p> <p>Less controversially, he described Harrison as \"the biggest bum inside boxing\". The commentator Dave Farrar added that the Harrison fight had lasted just 82&#xa0;seconds. Result: another lifetime commitment sidestepped.</p>",
  "<p>British people were half as likely as those in four other countries to cover their mouths more frequently when coughing or sneezing during the swine flu pandemic of 2009, according to <a href=\"http://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(12)70206-2/abstract\" title=\"\">a paper in the journal Lancet Infectious Diseases</a>. The researchers asked 900 randomly chosen adults in Japan, Mexico, Argentina, the US and the UK about the hygiene habits they used to reduce the spread of H1N1 swine flu. In the UK, a little more than half said they had washed their hands more frequently, compared with nearly 90% of Argentinians. Despite advice to cough or sneeze into our elbows, only a quarter of people in the UK said they did so. In Mexico, it&#xa0;was more than three-quarters.</p> <p>Now that the cold and flu season is coming round again, should we be more hygienic? The World Health Organisation estimates that 80% of all virus infections worldwide are caused by poor hygiene. The biggest concern is inadequate hand washing. So which practices work, and how can you strike a balance between careful and obsessive?</p> <h2><strong>The solution</strong></h2> <p>Most colds and flu are spread by viral droplets in coughs and sneezes or by viral particles being left on a surface, picked up on fingers and introduced into the body through the eyes, mouth or nose. Viruses and bacteria that cause vomiting and diarrhoea are also spread&#xa0;by hands.</p> <p>Keep your hands as germ-free as possible by washing them thoroughly using warm water and soap \u2013 these are more effective than just using sanitised sprays. The <a href=\"http://www.hpa.org.uk/webc/HPAwebFile/HPAweb_C/1194947384669\" title=\"\">technique recommended by the Health Protection Agency</a> involves rubbing palms together, interlocking hands and washing carefully between the fingers for 20 seconds. You should wash your hands at the flimsiest excuse to protect yourself and others, but especially after sneezing or coughing into your hands, going to the toilet, petting a dog, gardening, changing a&#xa0;nappy, preparing uncooked food, handling rubbish and taking care of anyone who is sick. Dry your hands thoroughly or the viruses and bacteria cling on. There is evidence that paper towels get rid of more germs than air hand dryers, but trials are almost all sponsored by industry, with positive results for whoever funded the research.</p> <p>If your child keeps coming home from school with tummy bugs or colds, check they are washing their hands. A&#xa0;survey by <a href=\"http://www.initial.co.uk/news/2012/hand-washing-risk.html\">Initial Hygiene</a> of 50 children in the UK aged seven to 11 found that 40% said they didn't wash their hands with soap after using the toilet, and three-quarters didn't do so before meals.</p> <p>Don't leave used hankies or tissues lying around. If someone in the house has a cold, wash communal surfaces such as door handles with hot soapy water or antibacterial cleaner. Keep your hands away from your mouth, nose and eyes.</p> <p>You also may want to choose kissing over hand shaking as a form of greeting during the winter&#xa0;months (ideally air kissing). Surveys reportedly show that shaking hands transfers germs very effectively.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 16 October 2012. The original said that 500 children were surveyed by Initial Hygiene, when in fact 50 were.</p>",
  "<p>For five years everything in Polish football was geared towards hosting Euro 2012. Hopes were high, stadiums were built and there was a giddy expectancy around Franciszek Smuda's team.</p> <p>Then the tournament came \u2013 and went \u2013 with Poland going out in the group stage. Smuda left with his tail between his legs, saying the 1-0 defeat against Czech Republic was the \"end of a great adventure\".</p> <p>And it was. Euro 2012 was Poland's chance to achieve something on the European scene. They had never won a match at a European Championship \u2013 and they still haven't. A chance missed.</p> <p>So morale was low when the 2012-13 season started. To make matters worse, all Polish clubs crashed out of the Champions League and Europa League before the summer holidays were over. All in all it was clear that the new coach, Waldemar Fornalik, needed a good result in his first game in charge to lift spirits. Sadly, he lost 1-0 to Estonia.</p> <p>Since then, Poland have played two World Cup qualifiers in Group H \u2013 drawing 2-2 against Montenegro away and beating Moldova 2-0 at home \u2013 and on Friday they won a friendly 1-0 against South Africa after a debut goal from the substitute Marcin Komorowski.</p> <p>Fornalik made his name in club football and last season he led Ruch Chorzow \u2013 who have one of the smallest budgets in the Ekstraklasa \u2013 to second place. He has freshened up the squad by calling up players such as Pawel Wszolek of Polonia Warsaw and Arkadiusz Piech of Ruch Chorzow.</p> <p>However, it is the more experienced players who seem to be causing Fornalik the most problems. The atmosphere within the squad is said to be poor with stories being leaked to the press about disharmony between the two star players Jakub \"Kuba\" Blaszczykowski and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2012/may/29/euro-2012-experts-network-poland-profile\" title=\"\">Robert Lewandowski</a>.</p> <p>Blaszczykowski, who is perhaps best known in the UK for the astonishing admission on the eve of Euro 2012 that he watched his father stab his mother to death when he was 10, is the captain of the team whereas Lewandowski, who has been linked with a move to Manchester United, is the main goalscorer.</p> <p>But despite playing for the same club side, they do not appear to be the best of friends. So for Fornalik, the fact that Blaszczykowski will miss the England game with an injured ankle may actually be good news.</p> <p>This may sound preposterous considering Blaszczykowski's form for Dortmund \u2013 including his recent performance at the Etihad Stadium against Manchester City \u2013 but the \"Kuba\" who plays in the yellow and black of Dortmund is a very different person to the one who captains Poland.</p> <p>For Poland he plays with his head down and passes only when surrounded by a wall of opponents. If he played that way for Dortmund he would be dropped by the manager, J\u00fcrgen Klopp. With Poland, though, it is different as Fornalik simply cannot afford to leave out someone of Blaszczykowski's calibre.</p> <p>Kuba's problem seems to be that he believes an advert he did for a supermarket a while ago in which the then coach Smuda said to him: \"Pass the ball, you won't win the game alone\". Kuba replied: \"Yes, I will.\" For the England game, Anderlecht's Marcin Wasilewski will captain the side.</p> <p>The match, on the eve of the 39th anniversary of the goalkeeper Jan Tomaszewski's heroics in a World Cup qualifier at Wembley, is important for Polish football not only in order to qualify for 2014, but for the future of the game and how the outcome may influence the vote for a new Polish FA president on 26 October.</p> <p>Grzegorz Lato will not be in the running after failing to get the 15 votes needed to run for re-election but three men who have the same approach as him will be \u2013 and a win against England would be huge boost for them. Otherwise the path is clear for Zbigniew Boniek, who needs no introduction, or Roman Kosecki (the former Legia, Galatasaray, Atl\u00e9tico Madrid and Nantes winger who is now a member of parliament).</p> <p>Change at the top may not be a bad thing for the future of Polish football so even if they loseon Tuesday night there may a few smiles among the home team's supporters.</p> <p>But despite all the problems there is a surprisingly optimistic mood in the country ahead of the game against Roy Hodgson's England. The former national coach Antoni Piechniczek who took Poland to third in the 1982 World Cup, was also in charge four years later when they lost 3-0 to England.</p> <p>\"It was the end of an era when we lost 3-0 in Mexico after Gary Lineker's hat-trick. We didn't qualify for another major tournament for 16 years after that,\" he told Przeglad Sportowy.</p> <p>\"I also lost against England in the 1998 World Cup qualifiers [1-2 and 0-2] but this time I'm fairly optimistic. Our potential going forward is high. We've got some problems in defence but the English defenders are inexperienced too.</p> <p>\"I think we will score two against England on Tuesday night and this match will go a long way towards telling whether I was right in backing Fornalik as the new manager.\"</p>",

  "<p>Syrian government forces have used Russian-made cluster bombs on populated areas in their effort to push back rebel advances along the country's main north-south highway, according to Human Rights Watch.</p> <p>The watchdog on Sunday pointed to <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUj0ocH87EU&amp;feature=youtu.be\" title=\"\">videos put up on the internet</a> showing bomblets from cluster munitions in Idlib, Homs, Aleppo and Latakia provinces and outside Damascus. It said interviews with witnesses backed up the video evidence and there were clear signs the weapons had been dropped from aircraft.</p> <p>The allegations came as President Bashar al-Assad's government was struggling to stop opposition forces consolidating their hold on Idlib province, on the Turkish border. The rebels were reported to have surrounded an army garrison of several hundred men at Urum al-Sughra, between the contested city of Aleppo, the country's commercial and industrial centre, and the frontier.</p> <p>\"Rebels attacked an armoured column sent from Aleppo to rescue the 46th Regiment at Urum al-Sughra and stopped it in its tracks,\" Firas Fuleifel, an opposition activist told Reuters by phone from Idlib. He said a Syrian air force jet was shot down while trying to provide air support to the column.</p> <p>Sunday's Human Rights Watch report said there were Soviet-era markings on the cluster bombs used over the past few days but it was unclear when they had been delivered to Syria. Russia continued to be Syria's main arms suppliers after the demise of the Soviet Union.</p> <p>More than 100 countries have signed a treaty banning the use of cluster bombs on the grounds that they are indiscriminate weapons and unexploded bomblets scattered across a wide area in the wake of an attack pose an unacceptable threat to civilians. Neither Syria nor Russia has signed the 2010 treaty. Nor have China and the US.</p> <p>\"Syria's disregard for its civilian population is all too evident in its air campaign, which now apparently includes dropping these deadly cluster bombs into populated areas,\" said Steve Goose, arms director at Human Rights Watch. \"Cluster bombs have been comprehensively banned by most nations, and Syria should immediately stop all use of these indiscriminate weapons that continue to kill and maim for years.\"</p> <p>Turkey closed its airspace to Syrian airliners on Saturday, four days after it claimed to have found weaponry on a Syrian Air Airbus flying to Damascus from Moscow, which Turkish warplanes forced to land on suspicion of gun-running. The Russian government insisted the plane had been carrying legal radar components in its hold, but Turkey said the consignment included missile parts. The Russian newspaper Kommersant said the consignment had been sent by a company in the Russian city of Tula, which manufactures missiles and radar equipment.</p> <p>Following the Airbus incident on 10 October, Syria accused Turkey of \"piracy\" and banned Turkish overflights on Saturday. Turkey had stopped using Syrian airspace some months previously and its foreign minister, Ahmet Davutoglu, said on Sunday: \"The Syrian announcement has no value for us.\"</p> <p>The Airbus incident was a low point in the Turkish-Russian relationship, which has been severely strained by the conflict in Syria. The Turkish prime minister, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, lambasted the UN security council at a conference in Istanbul for its failure to intervene in the Syrian conflict, in what was regarded as thinly-veiled criticism of Russia and China, which have vetoed any direct pressure on Assad's regime.</p> <p>\"The UNS security council has not intervened in the human tragedy that has been going on in Syria for 20 months,\" he said. \"There's an attitude that encourages, gives the green light to, Assad to kill tens or hundreds of people every day,\" he said.</p>",
  "<p>Some of Britain's top environmental science agencies are being told to use their skills to help \"de-risk\" investment for UK oil companies in the polar regions.</p> <p>The demands are contained in a consultation document on an already controversial move to merge the British Antarctic Survey (BAS) with the National Oceanographic Centre.</p> <p>The \"outrageous\" new strategy direction is at odds with a House of Commons committee calling on the government to stop drilling by Shell in the Arctic over safety concerns and worries that the sea ice is melting faster than ever, warn critics.</p> <p>Some banks have already decided they will not support operations in the far north, but the Natural Environment Research Council (NERC), which is pushing the tie-up between the BAS and the National Oceanographic Centre, says in its consultation brief: \"A long-term vision is needed to equip UK business and UK investors with the edge needed for de-risking major investment decisions in hostile, unfamiliar environments.\"</p> <p>The merged group would seek to exploit opportunities by \"strengthening the business and commercial expertise within a reshaped leadership team\" while \"building and broadening business engagement, particularly in the seeking of regional innovation clusters\", adds the NERC document, which was sent out ahead of a consultation exercise which ended earlier this week.</p> <p>NERC is the UK's main agency for funding and managing research in the environmental sciences and its desire to merge the two highly respected institutions has upset scientists and even some Conservative backbenchers.</p> <p>Critics presumed the real reason for the merger was the desire to cut budgets but the consultation documents suggest it could also be partly about turning the combined body into a better support system for the business community.</p> <p>Duncan Wingham, the NERC chief executive, said all scientific institutes were now under pressure to ensure they were providing value to the UK economy.</p> <p>But he denied that a more business-focused approach meant that the council necessarily supported drilling in the Arctic, although future work would provide relevant information to oil companies.</p> <p>\"It is not the function of NERC to take a policy decision but to provide scientific information upon which someone else can make such a decision. There is no question there is a perceived tension between the regulatory approach to retaining a clean environment and on the other hand our [the UK's] need to provide new energy supplies,\" he said.</p> <p>Greenpeace has recently launched a major campaign to make parts of the far north off limits to Big Oil and fears for the future of Antarctica as drilling picks up in areas such as the South Atlantic.</p> <p>\"The British Antarctic Survey is a world-renowned institution, and has done great work in helping us to understand and protect one of the most fragile and wonderful regions on the planet,\" said the Greenpeace head, John Sauven.</p> <p>\"So dismantling this leading scientific centre and using the leftovers to do the bidding of oil companies is both wrong and outrageous. BAS must not be used to make it easier to extract resources from the Arctic and Antarctic. These regions need to be protected.\"</p> <p>NERC argues that putting the Cambridge-based BAS together with the National Oceanographic Centre in Southampton should make it more dynamic and insists budgets have been protected.</p> <p>The environmental audit committee of the House of Commons warned in its report that the vulnerable Arctic region was being endangered by a misguided search for hydrocarbons.</p> <p>\"The shocking speed at which the Arctic sea ice is melting should be a wake-up call to the world that we need to phase out fossil fuels fast,\" said the committee chair, Joan Walley MP. \"Instead we are witnessing a reckless gold rush in this pristine wilderness as big companies and governments make a grab for the world's last untapped oil and gas reserves.\"</p> <p>Since the report was unveiled last month, one of the world's major oil companies, Total of France, has declared that it will not drill for oil, saying it realised a spill would ruin its corporate reputation.</p>",
