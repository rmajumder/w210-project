  "<p>It is hard to believe that Sir David Attenborough has ever mistreated a single animal in his life. This is a man for whom the natural world is sacred, after all. Yet midway through our interview, organised to promote his new television series <em>Attenborough: 60 Years in the Wild</em>, a crestfallen look crosses the great naturalist's features when I ask if he has any regrets about his career.</p> <p>\"Jumping on animals. I regret that,\" he states. I blink in disbelief. It is as if Judi Dench had admitted to glue-sniffing. Attenborough explains. \"Fifty years ago, I used to go along, chase a giant anteater and pull it by the tail so we could film it. I am sorry about that sort of thing. But those were different days.\"</p> <p>Then there was the time he and his crew were stuck in Borneo and strapped for something to film. \"I found a little crocodile and we did a cod sequence with it. We filmed it close up so that it looked like a really big crocodile. I then took off my shirt and jumped on it. Everyone thought I had a fight with a full-sized crocodile. 'God you were brave,' they told me. I wish I hadn't done that.\"</p> <p>And as for eating turtle eggs, he pulls a face. \"They were horrible, salty. I wished I hadn't done that either.\"</p> <p>As crimes against nature, these are minor transactions, it must be admitted. Yet they are informative \u2013 for it is easy to forget how attitudes to wildlife have changed since Attenborough began his career in 1952 on programmes such as <em>The</em> <em>Pattern of Animals</em> and, later, <em>Zoo Quest</em>. Wild creatures were still viewed from a Victorian perspective in those days. They were there to be tracked, captured, tied up and brought back to Britain to be goggled at. Attenborough was no different from other naturalists at the time, he admits.</p> <p><em>Zoo Quest</em> was certainly made in that mould, he believes. For the nine years it aired, Attenborough would travel with staff from London Zoo to a tropical country to capture an animal for the zoo's collection, a practice that was considered to be perfectly acceptable at the time. Attenborough's first assignment was to track down a white-necked Picathartes in Sierra Leone on the grounds that no other zoo in Europe had one or even knew what it looked like. \"I thought: 'Oooh, a bird that no one has ever even seen. I must become the first European to get one.' It was very childish really.\"</p> <p>Today Attenborough, like the rest of us, has a far more respectful attitude to animals, as the new series makes clear. Indeed, if <em>Attenborough: 60 Years in the Wild</em> has a theme it is that of transition. How attitudes to the natural world have changed and how knowledge of living things has been transformed by modern science. Not to mention the leap that has taken place in the film technology bringing the wonders of the world into our front rooms, from clockwork, wind-up cameras to stop-frame photography and thermal imaging.</p> <p>An example of these technological changes is provided in the living room of Attenborough's own elegant west London home. It is dominated, not by images of wildlife or native art, as you might expect, but by a giant 50in 3D television. Now Attenborough is certainly no geek \u2013 he can't drive and has trouble answering his mobile phone, he says \u2013 but he has pioneered a recent series of 3D programmes for Sky. He is clearly in thrall to the technology and keen to demonstrate its wonders.</p> <p>Attenborough bustles round the set, pulling out discs from a Blu-ray player, and flicking through scenes. The tasks involve a great deal of kneeling and bending over, which Attenborough accomplishes with no hint of stiffness or back pain that would leave many younger men groaning. Dressed in an open-neck light-blue shirt, chino slacks and loafers \u2013 an Attenborough uniform to judge from other interviews \u2013 he could easily pass for a man 20 years younger and is clearly determined to keep up with the latest developments in his profession.</p> <p>\"I began my career in broadcasting on the old 405 line, black-and-white TV that was broadcast from Crystal Palace,\" he adds. \"I wasn't going to say no to doing a programme in 3D that would be displayed on huge colour screens when I was offered the chance.</p> <p>\"On the other hand, as a medium, 3D TV is certainly not perfect. You are limited to what you photograph. You cannot use long focal lenses because of problems with background. And the cameras require two or three men to carry them. But oh, when you see time-lapse photography of plants flowering in 3D, the results are absolutely mesmeric.\"</p> <p>However, the real change in our perspective of the natural world is not due to improvements in TV technology but has been achieved through scientific revolutions, particularly in the fields of biology and geology. These have been the real game changers, Attenborough believes. \"We forget what we have learned in the last 60 years. At university I once asked one of my lecturers why he was not talking to us about continental drift and I was told, sneeringly, that if I could I prove there was a force that could move continents, then he might think about it. The idea was moonshine, I was informed.\"</p> <p>Yet we now know that continental drift explains a vast amount about the variation in the planet's plants and animals \u2013 for example the presence of similar families of earthworms in central Africa and in central South America \u2013 continents which were once attached to each other. Continental drift featured strongly in <em>Life on Earth</em>, Attenborough's first great series on the natural world, in 1979. What his old lecturer made of the programme is not recorded.</p> <p>Since then a host of great scientific visionaries have been interviewed by Attenborough, with Konrad Lorenz providing an unforgettable early start. Lorenz won a Nobel prize for physiology for his work on animal behaviour and had an astonishing affinity with many species, in particular greylag geese. Would he like to appear on TV and demonstrate that empathy on the air, Attenborough asked.</p> <p>Lorenz agreed and was filmed clutching a goose provided by London Zoo. \"Komm, komm, mein Liebchen,\" he murmured to the unhappy animal which, as Attenborough relates, eventually squirted a&#xa0;jet of green dung straight at the great scientist, covering his trousers. Lorenz released the goose, wiped his clothes with his handkerchief before absent-mindedly blowing his nose with it. He completed his interview, on camera, with a green smear down his face.</p> <p>Other stars to receive homage in <em>60 Years in the Wild </em>include Jane Goodall and Dian Fossey for their ape-observation work, Francis Crick and Jim Watson for their discovery of the structure of DNA, and Richard Dawkins for his ideas about the selfish gene. \"These people have completely transformed our understanding of the animal world. We see the world very differently today thanks to them.\"</p> <p>Finding ways to film these scientific visions has taken Attenborough to every conceivable place on the planet. He donned a diving suit for underwater sequences filmed for <em>The Trials of Life</em> in 1990; has been lifted to the top of rainforests by cranes; spat at by cobras; flattened by a belligerent Scottish capercaillie; and, of course, been groomed by gorillas in that glorious sequence in <em>Life on Earth</em>.</p> <p>So which spot on the planet would he recommend to give people a chance to enjoy living creatures at their best? The Gal\u00e1pagos with their iguanas? The Amazon rainforest? His answer comes as a surprise. \"People say you cannot beat the rainforest. But that is simply not true. You go there and the first thing you think is: where the hell are the birds? Where are the animals? They are hiding in the trees, of course. No, if you want beauty and wildlife, you want a coral reef. Put on a mask and stick your head under the water. The sight is mind-blowing.</p> <p>\"And that, actually, is still a mystery: why are coral reefs so beautiful and colourful? It is not immediately obvious, though the wildlife is wonderful: shell-less molluscs, crustaceans and shoals of fish that do not give a damn whether you are there or not. Your first trip to a coral reef will be one of the most transforming moments of your life.\"</p> <p>There is, of course, a downside. Coral reefs are now being destroyed at a staggering rate. Some estimates suggest around 600 square miles are lost every year, a rate double that of rainforest destruction. Reefs are dying because ocean waters are being acidified as carbon dioxide levels rise in the atmosphere as a result of human industrial activity. At the same time, rainforests are being ploughed up for farmland.</p> <p>And this takes us to the darker side of the changes that Attenborough has seen in 60 years. Just as we are learning more and more about the glories of the living world, and as new breath-taking visions are being brought into our homes, we are destroying these wonders at an accelerating rate. It is a simple question of numbers, says Attenborough. \"There is no problem on Earth that could not be solved quite easily if you could reduce world population. The reason that oil palms are being planted all over the place is because there are so many mouths, so many people in the west offering to pay for these forests to be cut down and palms planted for margarine, for plastics.\"</p> <p>Plastic refuse turns out to be a particular concern for Attenborough, who is working on a film that will highlight the crises facing our oceans. \"It is just tragic,\" says Attenborough. \"You have got an albatross that comes back to feed its young. In close-up, it regurgitates the stuff it has been collecting round the world's oceans for 10 days to feed its chicks and what comes out? Bits of plastic. And then you see the chicks swallowing this plastic. If you warm the plastic, it gives off dioxins. And the litter of this stuff. You can only get rid of it if you can burn it \u2013 and then it gets worse.\"</p> <p>It is a grim picture, though Attenborough is not without some shred of optimism. \"If I have to grasp for little threads of hope, one is that humans are going to be better informed about the state of the world than they have ever been in the planet's history. Kids in Tibet are going to be talking to people in Patagonia about what is happening to the Earth and there is a chance that a worldwide, slow protest movement will grow with younger people wanting something to be done.\"</p> <p>Much of their awareness of the living world and the perils facing its wildlife will have come from Attenborough, of course. In the past, he was criticised for not making clear his position on global warming, and for not taking on those who deny that climate change is occurring. However, in the past few years, he has been far more explicit in his warnings about the dangers our planet faces as it warms up and the polar regions melt.</p> <p>Not surprisingly, these attempts at enlightenment have brought him into conflict with those who reject the idea that the Earth is in peril. For example, in the final episode of his last major series, <em>Frozen Planet</em>, Attenborough highlighted the impact of global warming on the polar regions. He pointed out that summer sea ice cover has declined by more than 30% over the past few decades and is causing major disruptions to the wildlife.</p> <p>Nigel Lawson, former chancellor and leading climate-change denier, was unamused. \"Sir David's alarmism is sheer speculation,\" he claimed <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/jan/03/david-attenborough-frozen-planet-climate-change\" title=\"\">after the programme was transmitted last year</a>. \"When it comes to global warming, [Attenborough] seems to prefer sensation to objectivity.\" Attenborough, said Lawson, should have acknowledged that although the extent of Arctic sea ice has been declining over the past 30 years, satellite observations have also shown that, at the other pole, Antarctic sea ice has been expanding over the same period.</p> <p>Sensationalism is not an accusation that many have made about Attenborough in the past. He is a fellow of the Royal Society and was awarded the Order of Merit in 2005. He does not, generally, shoot his mouth off and many scientists were quick to jump to his defence. These included oceanographers who pointed out that yes, summer sea ice in Antarctica has increased over the past 30 years, but only slightly \u2013 by about 0.4 million square kilometres, an upward trend that may actually be no more than a reflection of year-to-year variability. By contrast summer sea ice in the Arctic has declined in extent by about 3 million square kilometres in the past 30 years: a vast decrease. Lawson was guilty of being economical with the truth, to put it mildly.</p> <p>So what does Attenborough think about climate change deniers like Lawson? What should be done to counter their highly selective views about global warming?</p> <p>\"Well, it is difficult to know what to say except that people like him have to be allowed to make these claims so that others can assess them. Any idea of suppressing their views would be disastrous. We need to be able to see just how wrong-headed they are and how selective they are in picking data to support their ideas. They pinpoint examples to say global warming cannot be happening because it got colder in some area of the planet. That is the sort of thing they say. But, of course, that completely misunderstands the global nature of the crisis we are facing. We have to keep pointing that out. Certainly I think that most people would recognise that Lawson is up a gum tree.</p> <p>\"The truth is: the natural world is changing. And we are totally dependent on that world. It provides our food, water and air. It is the most precious thing we have and we need to defend it.\"</p> <p>Attenborough: 60 Years in the Wild<em> begins on BBC2 on 16 November at 9pm</em></p>",
  "<p>At the Google campus in east London last month, an unshaven, scruffily dressed 31-year-old man took to the stage to address a packed room. Introducing the panel beside him \u2013 which included David \"Two Brains\" Willetts, the geekish minister for universities and science, and Mind Candy founder Michael Acton Smith \u2013 he remarked that the last time he'd visited the building, he'd been with George Osborne shortly after \"that budget\" and their ministerial car had been pelted with Cornish pasties (after the chancellor announced a so-called \"pasty tax\"). It's fair to say that Rohan Silva, the senior prime ministerial adviser and the person many credit with putting east London's technology cluster of startups on the map as \"Tech City\", enjoyed a rather less hostile welcome this time, as he unveiled plans to open up London's equity markets to high-growth tech companies.</p> <p>The announcement was the latest in a tsunami of initiatives to turn London's East End (according to the press release at the time) into \"a world-leading technology city to rival Silicon Valley\". The campaign began in the unlikely setting of Brick Lane's sticky-floored Old Truman Brewery, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/pda/2010/nov/04/tech-city-london-facebook-google\" title=\"\">where David Cameron sketched out his technology strategy</a>, which was, according to insiders, heavily moulded by Silva. Among the prime minister's pledges that day were that companies such as Vodafone, Google, Facebook and Intel would invest in the long-term future of the area and that the Olympic Park media centre would become an \"accelerator space\" after the games.</p> <p>Reactions from east London tech companies \u2013 which numbered around 200 at the time \u2013 were decidedly mixed. One founder <a href=\"http://designswarm.com/blog/2010/11/politicians-handbook-east-london/\" title=\"\">blogged that Downing Street should leave the East End alone</a>: \"If you fill east London with Google, Facebook and Intel, the value of property will rise and the creative people will move to Bermondsey\", while one leading US investor, John Lilly of Greylock partners, pointed out that \"<a href=\"http://www.wired.co.uk/magazine/archive/2011/02/start/silicon-roundabout?page=all\" title=\"\">tech hubs are rarely created by governments</a>\". For Charles Armstrong, CEO of Trampoline Systems, the initiative had \"got mixed in with a policy fig-leaf, which is really about this embarrassment about legacy and the Olympics\".</p> <p>Yet two years on, with an estimated five-fold increase of tech companies in the area, Silva has much to crow about \u2013 not least last week's considerable coup of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/oct/21/facebook-joanna-shields-silicon-roundabout\" title=\"\">landing Facebook executive Joanna Shields</a> to lead the <a href=\"http://www.techcityuk.com/#!/home\" title=\"\">Tech City Investment Organisation</a> (TCIO), the UK Trade &amp; Investment vehicle for growing east London's tech zone. The <em>Observer</em> understands that Shields was called at Facebook by headhunters asking whether she could recommend anyone for the role. To their surprise, she said: \"Yes. Me.\" The timing, says an insider, was serendipitous: \"After years of working for [large corporations] she wanted to do a public service role.\"</p> <p>With the departure of chief executive Erik van der Kleij, it was felt that the TCIO required a big-hitter with the profile to impress Silicon Valley \u2013 and that Shields fitted the bill. Topping last year's <a href=\"http://www.wired.co.uk/magazine/archive/2011/06/the-wired-100\" title=\"\"><em>Wired</em> 100 list</a> of UK tech influencers, Shields was previously president at AOL and chief executive of UK social network Bebo (which was acquired by AOL for \u00a3530m in 2008 and, two years later, sold on for a reported \u00a36.2m). Before joining Facebook, she was Google's MD for Europe, Russia, the Middle East and Africa.</p> <p>As he munches his way through a family pack of nuts and seeds in the Google campus courtyard, Silva says that a government has rarely moved so quickly on a range of policy and legislative fronts. With an annual budget of just \u00a32m to promote the area, TCIO has more or less \"bootstrapped\" the entire venture, he argues. Simultaneously \"the great assets of state\" have been deployed to introduce the east London tech community to corporate and venture capital big-hitters, with regular Tech City breakfasts at 10 Downing Street and events at Buckingham Palace and the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. \"We even had a Tech City event on the west coast of the US with Prince William and Kate,\" he says.</p> <p>Silva, who got married this month and has wrongly been reported to be leaving his post, points to three main achievements so far. \"The first is the global profile that east London now has. It's true to say that the majority of serious tech people around the world are now aware of Tech City. The second is a long list of government policies, which have flowed directly out of conversations with Tech City companies: 'entrepreneur visas' [a fast-track visa scheme for entrepreneurs], the <a href=\"http://www.seis.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Seed Enterprise Investment Scheme</a> [of tax breaks], the work on IPOs and opening up of government procurement contracts. Third is the building we're in now. The Google campus literally wouldn't have been here had it not been for us going to Google and saying, 'come to east&#xa0;London'.\"</p> <p>The prime minister's speech had also named a number of major companies that would invest in the area. Two years later, this, too, can too be chalked up as a success. Among others, Google, Intel, Vodafone, Cisco, Yammer and Airbnb have invested in the capital, while Facebook is opening its first non-US engineering hub. However, everyone interviewed for this article considered Tech City to be very much a work in progress. While entrepreneur visas were widely praised, there was criticism about the hardening of discourse surrounding immigration, which has been capped by the coalition and might put off overseas coding talent, which is in short supply. \"What the PM does constantly say is that the brightest and best will always be welcome in the UK, whatever the media discourse,\" counters Silva. \"Where we could do more is go to university campuses around the world to tell people about the entrepreneur visa. We want the next Sergey Brin to come to London and find a home, investment and build a business here.\"</p> <p>But the next Sergey Brin might not be overly impressed by the quality of broadband to be found in London, and the fact that start-ups have on occasion struggled to persuade providers to connect them. Silva concedes this remains a live issue. \"We've just announced \u00a325m for fibre-optic broadband for London. But we're also leaning on BT to get them to roll out their fibre faster. One of the challenges the entrepreneurs were telling us about was that even where fibre is available, you've got to sign a two-year contract, but as a startup you don't know where you're going to be in two months, let alone two years. So we've worked with Virgin on that and they're piloting switch-on-and-off fibre-broadband.\"</p> <p>As for the Olympic Park, Silva chooses his words carefully. \"Our thinking with the Olympic Park is that as a government, we inherited this thing,\" he says. \"We want to make sure companies around the world are aware that it's there and can make use of it. If the likes of Songkick and Mind Candy do turn out to be massive companies, where do they grow to? All we're saying is that there is this fantastic asset there, and if people want to move there, then great.\"</p> <p>Silva readily accepts there is still more work to do. When pressed for specifics, he says: \"There is still not a world-class computer science university in east London. I think that's something the ecosystem needs. There are also some transport things we can look at: high-speed rail links to Europe, links to City Airport and links to other clusters such as Cambridge.\" What about a third runway at Heathrow? The Downing Street adviser laughs nervously. \"I think I'll leave that for Boris [Johnson] and the PM to sort out.\"</p>",
  "<p><strong>Price \u00a324,785</strong><br><strong>MPG 50.4</strong><br><strong>Top speed 120mph</strong></p> <p>The green-walled lanes of south Devon are a beautiful place to visit for a holiday. Bursting with flowers and alive with nature, the winding tracks are the arteries that keep Mother Nature in such rude health. But for your car these lanes offer no easygoing respite from the daily grind. They are a traumatising boot camp hell bent on sending your forecourt-fresh motor home in tatters. Thorns wait to lacerate your paintwork, gaping pot holes linger ready to devour your suspension, while those velvety, moss-covered boulders loiter in the damp verges primed to sabotage your sills. A&#xa0;week in Devon puts years on your car and will send it home distressed, tired and battered.</p> <p>The car I chose to inflict such punishment on was <a href=\"http://seat.co.uk\" title=\"\">Seat</a>'s all-conquering Alhambra \u2013 a tuff mudder if ever there was one. No nonsense, economical and business-like, Seat's large MPV is used to winning. Year in year out it cleans up when it comes to award time. Earlier this year it was named <a href=\"http://whatcar.com\" title=\"\"><em>What Car?</em></a>'s back-to-back MPV champion.</p> <p>It's not that I had a personal vendetta against the Alhambra, but it promised to do everything I needed it to. Room for seven adults: check. Huge boot: check. Five-star safety rating: check. Fifty miles to the gallon: check. Decent stereo: check. Engaging drive: check. Great looks\u2026 well, OK, it's not exactly a stunner. It simply looks like what it is: a mammoth, parsimonious people carrier.</p> <p>As probably the best-value large MPV on the road, most Alhambras have little more to look forward to than a life of servitude: long days and late-night minicabbing with the odd early-morning airport transfer thrown in for variety. But those that escape the rat race \u2013 to Devon, say, or to work uncomplainingly for a multi-child family \u2013 will reward you amply.</p> <p>All cars want to play the Tardis card: small on the outside, big on the inside. But the Alhambra trumps the rest. It's biggish on the outside and absolutely vast on the inside. Its boot is a yawning maw, ready to swallow, in my case, everything from surfboards to a portable barbecue, plus luggage for seven for a week. But like a large man holding in his stomach for that terrible family beach shot, the Alhambra takes up less space than it should. Its wheels are pushed out to the corners, and the rear doors slide rather than winging open \u2013 meaning you can squeeze into the smaller parking spaces and still actually get out of the car. And inside all five of the rear seats can fold flat to create enough space for a kingsize mattress. Combined with the full-length panoramic roof, you could stretch out on your back and look at the autumn rain falling with impunity.</p> <p>The square shape means visibility is superb and Seat has the handling of a much smaller, more agile car. With vehicles built for size, driveability can only really be seen as a bonus. The Alhambra steers well, offers a cushy ride and its eager 2-litre diesel is quiet, responsive and never whines (just like my children). And 50mpg, too \u2013 come on, that's a deal-closer.</p> <p>Should you buy one? Without doubt. The only problem is that you won't want to take a car you like so much on holiday.</p> <h2>Tyres to trees <br></h2> <p>Environmentally conscious motorists are being given the chance to turn their unwanted cars into newly planted trees. <a href=\"http://ScrapCarPlantTree.org.uk\" title=\"\">Scrap Car Plant Tree</a>, which launched this week, allows motorists to donate unwanted vehicles and uses the money raised through their disposal to plant trees in a city of their choice.

Money made from each disposal will go to UK charity Trees for Cities, which plants trees and creates green spaces throughout Britain's urban areas. Scrap Car Plant Tree expects to fund the planting of 13 saplings on average per disposal which will offset around a year's carbon emissions \u2013 although some vehicles will be able to provide significantly more.

  "<p>There are some actors' names \u2013 Errol Flynn, Marlon Brando, Johnny Depp \u2013 which, even if they were not famous, would still evoke images of romance, danger, drama. Then there is Bryan Cranston. It's hard to conceive of a more prosaic appellation. It's almost perfectly anonymous. Authentic but dully inconspicuous, it's a background kind of name. A solid name for a solid character actor.</p> <p>Which is what Cranston was for almost three decades. On film and on television, he was repeatedly to be found in supporting roles, slowly building a reputation as a reliable and flexible performer who was equally adept in comedy and drama. Always in employment, he would crop up in shows such as <em>Baywatch</em>, <em>Murder, She Wrote</em>, <em>LA Law</em> and in minor parts in forgotten films such as <em>Amazon Women on the Moon</em> and <em>The Companion</em>.</p> <p>His discreet profile was raised in the mid-90s by a recurring stint on <em>Seinfeld</em>, in which he played \"dentist to the stars\" <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMLKbXuv-xA\" title=\"\">Dr Tim Whatley</a>. That led to improved supporting roles in better films and to the part as the <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_8OpmaZnc0\" title=\"\">bungling father</a> in the popular family sitcom <em>Malcolm in the Middle</em>. Despite the upturn in his career, attention and awards remained centred on his fellow actors in the show. While his face \u2013 a curious mixture of a weak mouth and resilient eyes \u2013 became much better known, even fans of the show would have struggled to put a name to it.</p> <p>What turned Bryan Cranston into a name that people began to remember, that producers sought to sign and that other actors spoke of with hard-earned respect was the part of Walter White, the mild-mannered chemistry teacher who turns to manufacturing crystal meth in the cable TV hit <em>Breaking Bad</em>. It was that rare gig in acting: a character lead, a part that not only called for detail and depth but which also propelled the action. The first series was screened in America in 2008 and Cranston won the Emmy award for outstanding lead actor in a drama series. He repeated the feat the following year and the year after that. Finally, after 30 years in the business, Cranston was an overnight star.</p> <p>I met him earlier this month in London, where he was promoting <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/sep/07/argo-ben-affleck-review\" title=\"\"><em>Argo</em></a>, a film directed by Ben Affleck that's based on the real-life story of six American embassy workers who were rescued from Iran during the 1979-81 hostage crisis. It's a slick and entertaining thriller in which Cranston plays the part of Jack O'Donnell, a wily CIA agent who oversees the \"exfiltration\".</p> <p>It's not the main part \u2013 that's taken by Affleck \u2013 but it is the kind of role, like his equally deft performance in last year's <em>Drive</em>, that wouldn't have come Cranston's way a few years ago. He knows exactly why the quality of job offers has improved in recent years. \"<em>Breaking Bad</em> has certainly raised the bar,\" he says. \"There's been an effect on my career, there's no question about that. I can't just accept anything that comes along. It has to be at a level that's different but matches the level of writing of<em> Breaking Bad</em>. It takes a tremendous amount of work because you read massive amounts of product in order to find the nugget of gold. And the nugget of gold in this case is <em>Argo</em>, which is extremely well written.\"</p> <p>He praises Affleck's skill as a film-maker and his ability to maintain focus as an actor while dealing with all the other responsibilities a director has to field. Perhaps sensitive to the criticism from some quarters that the film is an exercise in pro-American propaganda, Cranston is quick to make an unsolicited statement clarifying his and the film's liberal sentiments. \"What I appreciate about the movie is that the film-makers decided to come clean by announcing the culpability of America in our foreign policy, that we helped to orchestrate the regime change in Iran putting the Shah in power. The bad guy in the movie is really an ideology. Any kind of civil rights oppression is wrong.\"</p> <p>Mini-lecture over, he returns to the question of the <em>Breaking Bad</em> effect. \"As it's a well-told story,\" he explains, \"it attracts attention from storytellers themselves, because it's so intricate and dark and twisted.\"</p> <p>It's also the story of a man whose brilliantly creative mind has been imprisoned in mediocrity, a man who has silently acquired a lifetime's pent-up frustrations. What liberates Walter White is a diagnosis of terminal cancer. Knowing that he is soon to die, he begins to live, by using his chemical expertise to produce the purest and most potent methamphetamine the market has ever seen.</p> <p>Given the powerful conviction and credibility that Cranston brings to White's metamorphosis, it's tempting to see White's buried resentments as a metaphor for the disappointments of his own career. However it's not a temptation to which Cranston is given, at least not publicly.</p> <p>\"No,\" he insists, \"I was very happy with my career. If you have a level of expectation in your life that you have to be a quote-unquote star, whatever that means, you might be setting yourself up for failure. But my expectations were that I would be a working actor, that I could honestly say that I make a living as an actor and that was achieved when I was 24. Above that, the world doesn't owe me anything, the business doesn't owe me anything. Anything that is gained is through hard work.\"</p> <p>All of that may be true, but you only have to spend half an hour in Los Angeles to sense the atmosphere of envy and insecurity that hangs over the city like its smog. Everyone knows exactly how well everyone else is doing and no one is doing well enough. To maintain an attitude of professional contentment as a middle-ranking character actor would be an act of Zen-like forbearance, particular if you harboured ambitions, like the rest of LA's inhabitants, to be something more.</p> <p>He gives a glimpse of the inner drive that must have taken him through all those walk-on parts in the 1980s and 1990s when he says: \"In order to be an actor you really have to be one of those types of people who are risk-takers and have what is considered an actor's arrogance, which is not to say an arrogance in your personal life. But you have to be the type of person who wants the ball with seconds left in the game. The masses don't want the ball. They don't want to be responsible for not making the shot. Actors need to want that chance. Give me that chance.\"</p> <p>And that chance, as he is keen to make clear, is often a matter of chance. \"Luck is a component that a lot of people in the arts sometimes fail to recognise: that you can have talent, perseverance, patience, but without luck you will not have a successful career.\"</p> <p>Cranston's luck was to be cast as an antisemitic lunatic, terrorised by sound waves, in an <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aIj0yyvCww8\" title=\"\">episode</a> of the paranormal drama series <em>The</em> <em>X-Files</em>. The episode began with Cranston's character driving wildly into the desert. Broadcast in 1998, it was written by Vince Gilligan. Almost 10 years later, Gilligan recalled Cranston and asked him to take the lead in a drama he had conceived about a middle-aged man whose end-life crisis thrusts him into the darklands of America's illicit drug trade. The opening scene saw Cranston once more driving wildly into the desert.</p> <p>Since that moment, the drama has steadily and sometimes abruptly developed across five series \u2013 the fifth and final season is now showing in the States \u2013 into an intimate and fascinating study of character, motivation and moral choice. The first two series were broadcast on the FX channel in Britain but since then viewers have either downloaded the show \u2013 legally and illegally \u2013 or caught up with it through renting or buying series DVD sets.</p> <p>However it has been viewed, the series now demands to be spoken of in the same breathless breath as those other mammoth American dramas <em>The Sopranos</em> and <em>The Wire</em>. Although <em>Breaking Bad</em> can't rival the narrative breadth and complexity of those two television landmarks, and it has also taken more artistic licence with its plots, it does match them in terms of originality, intelligence, sense of place and dramatic engagement and certainly outdoes both in cinematography.</p> <p>When filming began, Cranston had little idea of the particulars of his character's travails, only a general sense of his moral trajectory. \"I knew Vince wanted to go from Mr Chips to Scarface,\" he says. \"I knew he wanted to go from a good person to a bad person. So it was up to me to figure out, through his writing, how to make it feel plausible and justifiable. Some people are saying recently, about some of the things he's done: that's not Walt. I say: it is now. He's a very pragmatic man, very scholarly, very exact. Chemistry is an exact science. No guesswork. But now because his emotions are gone, he's doing things that are a little erratic. He's impulsive at times.\"</p> <p>If some viewers have expressed doubts about Walt's evolution or, perhaps more accurately, devolution, plenty of others see it as an epic voyage into the American underbelly. No less an authority on storytelling than Stephen King even suggested that <em>Breaking Bad</em> had \"surpassed <em>The Sopranos</em>\". Describing the series as an \"American classic\", King said that Cranston and his co-star <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2012/oct/13/aaron-paul-breaking-bad-interview\" title=\"\">Aaron Paul</a> had \"turned in the best performances I've seen in years\".</p> <p>What's beyond doubt is that the relationship between Walter White and his former pupil and troublesome sidekick, Jesse Pinkman (Paul) is one of the great unlikely double acts of television or film, an odd couple to beat <em>The Odd Couple</em>. Squeezed into their prickly partnership are themes of youth and age, rectitude and dysfunction, love and hate, loyalty and mistrust. And the whole dynamic is balanced on a knife edge, forever teetering between black comedy and even blacker tragedy.</p> <p>Cranston speaks of Paul with obvious paternal-like affection. \"I love his parents \u2013 I know them pretty well \u2013 but he could be my son almost. I'm old enough to have fathered him and I do have fatherly feelings towards him. Occasionally I give him advice and just try to guide him to where he needs to be, at least from my point of view.\"</p> <p>In <em>The Odd Couple</em> it was Jack Lemmon who played the role of the fastidious flatmate. And it was to Lemmon that Jane Kaczmarek (Cranston's co-star in <em>Malcolm in the Middle</em>) has compared her one-time screen husband. \"He's like Jack Lemmon,\" she said three years ago, \"except now he's doing <em>Days of Wine and Roses</em> or <em>The Apartment</em>.\"</p> <p>Lemmon, it turns out, is one of Cranston's acting heroes. \"I appreciated his intensity, his zest for it. He would say: it's magic time. I have the same attitude \u2013 it's a fun adventure for me. And for Jack to go from comedy to drama so fluidly \u2013 I wish I'd had the opportunity to meet him.</p> <p>\"Dick Van Dyke influenced me a lot \u2013 you know, his physical comedy and his ability to be loose in his body. Rod Steiger was another actor I thought was immensely talented. Mark Rylance is someone I have a huge man-crush on. If I could watch him just drink tea I'd sit there for an hour.\"</p> <p>In person, there's little that's coy or comic about Cranston. He comes across as amiable but almost coolly professional and much more physically confident than he tends to appear on screen. If you look closely at his performances, there are flashes of Van Dyke in his chaotic father in <em>Malcolm in the Middle</em>, but there is something consistently Lemmon-like about his overall work as actor. It's a sort of contorted or neurotic decency that can play for laughs or tears, a perplexed, put-upon pathos that you root for in spite of everything. And in <em>Breaking Bad</em> there is an awful lot of everything.</p> <p>Taken together, it amounts to a serious challenge to the viewer's sympathies, let alone those of commissioning executives. Although American cable TV has proved itself to be remarkably open to difficult subject matter, the idea of a middle-aged, middle-class, middle-American peddling crystal meth is not what you'd call an easy sell. All the major cable networks turned it down, and although the series was developed at FX, it too passed.</p> <p>AMC, its eventual home, embraced the concept but had reservations about Cranston. Nonetheless Gilligan knew that he was vital to the show. \"Because he's so decent and likable,\" Gilligan has said, \"Bryan allows you to comprehend why he does what he does, even if you don't agree with it.\"</p> <p>Along with its setting beneath the magnificent wide-open skies of Albuquerque in New Mexico, one of the most distinctive aspects of <em>Breaking Bad</em> is the crystal meth scene. In common with Cranston, it's resolutely unglamorous. There are no sexy fringe benefits, no alluring distractions. It's either the cold science and ruthless business of the producers or the violent highs and grimy dissipation of the consumers. Although the war on drugs is depicted with all the futile death and destruction that wars wreak, it would be difficult to describe the show's message as explicitly, or even implicitly, anti-prohibitionist.</p> <p>Cranston isn't interested in getting into the politics of the situation. For him, the role of crystal meth in the series was fundamentally dramatic. \"If it was marijuana we were dealing with, no one really cares,\" he says. \"But the fact that it's this very heavy scourge-of-society type drug means there is far more at stake. It also makes it much more difficult for Walter to be able to compromise his ethics.\"</p> <p>When pressed on his views on drugs, he takes a classically liberal libertarian stance. \"I think marijuana should be legalised,\" he says. \"There should still be restrictions on being intoxicated, and there should be age limits and so on, but I think it should be legalised. I also think prostitution should be legalised. What two adults do in private shouldn't be any of my business, and in a pragmatic way you'd save millions upon millions of dollars not incarcerating these young women.\"</p> <p>Cranston has been married for 23 years to the actress Robin Dearden. They met on a TV show called <em>Airwolf</em>. He played a kidnapper and she was his hostage. \"We still love each other. She's with me now and we like to travel together,\" he says a little defensively about Dearden when I ask about his&#xa0;five-year screen relationship with Anna Gunn, who plays Walt's wife, Skyler, in <em>Breaking&#xa0;Bad</em>. He and Dearden have a teenage daughter and he divides his time between Los Angeles and Albuquerque, where for the past five years he has spent six months out of every 12&#xa0;filming.</p> <p>He grew up in the San Fernando Valley, the vast suburb that lies beyond the Hollywood Hills. His parents were both actors. \"They met in Hollywood in an acting class in 1948, after the war when everything was new and fresh and alive and full of potential and possibility. It must have been a very romantic time. And they had their romance.\"</p> <p>His mother stopped acting to raise a family \u2013 \"I think she resented the fact that she gave up that part of her life\" \u2013 and his father was often out of work. Perhaps aware of Hollywood's vicissitudes, Cranston decided to join the police. He joined a police explorer group when he was 16 and graduated first out of 111 cadets. \"I think I would have been a good policeman. They have to have a curious mind and a sceptical view, to not just believe everything they see but uncover every single element and be detail-orientated, to know protocol and keep a cool head under fire. And I think that's something I could have done.\"</p> <p>The reason he didn't, he says, is because he discovered girls.</p> <p>\"I was also taking an elective theatre class at college and the girls in theatre class were far prettier than the ones in police science class. In my job as a young actor I was supposed to kiss this girl. That was my job. I've been trying to do this all my life and now you're telling me I'm <em>supposed</em> to do this? I love this. It's like you stepped into a fantasy. So at 19 years old this was the basis of my decision-making. No more police work, I'm going to be an actor.\"</p> <p>Almost 40 years later, few would argue that he made the wrong decision. He may well have made a fine detective but in Walter White, the chemistry teacher with lung cancer, he has created one of the most memorable villains ever to don a black hat.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 29 October 2012. The original misspelled Robin Dearden's name as Robin Deardon throughout. This has been corrected.</p>",
  "<p>One of the first times that Marion Mar\u00e9chal-Le Pen took her seat in the Assembl\u00e9e Nationale, the lower house of the French parliament, she was stopped by a male politician. \"He looked at me and said: 'And whose secretary are you?'\" says Mar\u00e9chal-Le Pen.</p> <p>In June, Mar\u00e9chal-Le Pen became the youngest MP in modern French history, at the age of 22, after topping the poll in her constituency of Carpentras in the south-eastern region of the Vaucluse, with 49.09% of the vote. And yet the most disconcerting thing about her victory was arguably not her youth but her politics: Mar\u00e9chal-Le Pen is an MP for the Front National and the newest face of the French far right. Her grandfather, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/jean-marie-le-pen\" title=\"\">Jean-Marie Le Pen</a>, founded the political party which she now represents, a party which is anti-Europe, anti-globalisation and which believes in stringent immigration controls and national protectionism.</p> <p>\"Integration is no longer possible,\" she says. \"When you're the single French person in the middle of 10 Tunisians, the majority will impose their way of life on the minority.\"</p> <p>Blonde, slim and striking, Mar\u00e9chal-Le Pen talks in a fluent and engaging manner. When we meet in her small, airless office in the headquarters of the Assembl\u00e9e Nationale in Paris, her hair is swept back in a ponytail, her clothes are fashionable but discreet: a black top with zip detailing at the shoulders, tailored beige trousers, boots with a sensible heel. In a building filled with middle-aged men in grey suits, Mar\u00e9chal-Le Pen stands out.</p> <p>The fact is that she looks like a 22-year-old \u2013 albeit one in possession of an extraordinary degree of focus and ambition \u2013 and it is perhaps this that makes it difficult to believe she espouses some of the hardline views that form part of her personal and political heritage. She says she is used to people underestimating her.</p> <p>\"It happens,\" she shrugs. \"People have said I'm a puppet, an instrument of my grandfather but I think they quickly realised that I'm my own person, that I have autonomy in my actions. I think they rapidly realised I could look after myself.\"</p> <p>And yet however much she might try and distance herself from it, the Front National's grubby history casts a long shadow. Mar\u00e9chal-Le Pen was born in 1989, two years after her grandfather claimed in an interview that the Nazi gas chambers were \"a point of detail of the second world war\" and six months before Front National supporters were accused of desecrating a Jewish cemetery in Carpentras, the town that would later become her constituency.</p> <p>She grew up surrounded by far-right politics in a red-brick manor house called the Pavillon de l'\u00c9cuyer in the western Paris suburb of Saint-Cloud that is home to several generations of Le Pens. Behind the rows of oak trees and conifers which shield it from public view, the house continues to play host to the entire dynasty: Jean-Marie, the 84-year-old elder statesman, presides over events and has his office on the first floor. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/marine-le-pen\" title=\"\">Marine Le Pen</a>, the youngest of his three daughters, who succeeded him as party leader last year, lives above a former stable in the extensive grounds. Marion lives with her mother, Yann, Jean-Marie's middle daughter, on the second floor of the main house. Mar\u00e9chal-Le Pen's divorced parents are both heavily involved in the Front National: her mother organises the party's rallies and her father, Samuel Mar\u00e9chal, used to lead its youth movement.</p> <p>It is partly as a result of this curious setup that many have accused Mar\u00e9chal-Le Pen of being little more than a photogenic figurehead for a party seeking to ditch its thuggish past in search of more mainstream credibility. There are those who question whether she genuinely believes the policies she's pitching to the wider public.</p> <p>\"She speaks rather well,\" says the French cultural commentator Agn\u00e8s Poirier, \"but a little like a law student who has memorised her dissertation.\"</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398427507\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pixies/2012/10/26/1351254712427/Marion-Mar-chal-Le-Pen-004.jpg\" alt=\"Marion Mar\u00e9chal-Le Pen\" width=\"220\" height=\"330\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Marion Mar\u00e9chal-Le Pen, France\u2019s youngest MP, and the latest in the family dynasty.

Mar\u00e9chal-Le Pen's aunt, Marine, has been instrumental in dragging the image of the Front National into the modern era, moving away from racist rhetoric, reaffirming secularism and insisting that France should stand on its own two feet and leave the euro. In April 2011, Marine banned regional councillor Alexandre Gabriac from the party after a photograph of him giving the Nazi salute was leaked to the press, calling his behaviour \"intolerable\". In return, she has been rewarded with electoral success: the Front National is now the third largest party in France. When Marine stood as a candidate in the presidential elections earlier this year, she electrified the race by polling 17.9% in the first round \u2013 more than 6m votes \u2013 eventually finishing third behind Fran\u00e7ois Hollande and Nicolas Sarkozy. But it has not all been plain sailing: although her niece was elected to parliament in June, Marine Le Pen lost her bid to win a seat by 118 votes.</p> <p>The party's parliamentary hopes now rest on Mar\u00e9chal-Le Pen, who is seen as an astute, media-friendly young woman capable of mobilising widespread support and reinvigorating the immigration debate. But there are those who question her own commitment, believing that she is little more than her grandfather's mouthpiece.</p> <p>According to Matthew Fraser, a professor at the American University of Paris: \"The old man [Jean-Marie] is grudgingly fading away \u2013 and it is grudging, there is talk that he misses the spotlight. He's hardly in retirement. For now, the granddaughter is an attractive and young symbol \u2013 probably not a real power in the system.\"</p> <p>I ask Mar\u00e9chal-Le Pen if she discusses political strategy with her elders around the dining table in the family mansion. \"No, not at all,\" she replies. \"We are all able to have our private lives. We're lucky to have such a close family, with my grandfather and cousins around us. We're very blessed. I think because we've always been confronted by adversity from the outside so we've become closer because of that, because we've had to be a strong unit to withstand those blows.\"</p> <p>She says she first developed an interest in politics at the age of 16 and supported Sarkozy in the 2007 presidential elections. But she soon became disenchanted by him and, at the age of 19, started to help out with campaigning for the Front National and volunteered for the youth wing of the party. She combined standing as an MP with her postgraduate studies in public law and is still a student at Panth\u00e9on-Assas University, a traditionally rightwing institution. Her grandfather, a former paratrooper who also went on to study law, was himself once the youngest MP in French politics when he was elected in 1956 at the age of 28. Is he proud of her carrying on the family tradition?</p> <p>\"I think so,\" she says. \"I hope so. He is proud of those who seek to take back their heritage and is passionate about France and he's happy that young people are becoming engaged [Marion's electoral success was due in part to her popularity among voters aged 18-25]. I don't agree with everything he says, but I agree with the essential spirit and of that he's proud. What he hates most of all is inertia, people who are spectators.\"</p> <p>What, then, are her policies? She lists them, one by one, in rapid-fire \u2013 at one point, she is speaking so quickly that her adviser, Arnaud, has to remind her to slow down as French is not my first language.</p> <p>\"But dammit, I am speaking slowly!\" she protests and then carries on at the same breakneck pace. On the economy, she wants France to abandon the euro and readopt the franc. She wants tighter regulation for financial institutions in the wake of the banking crisis and lower taxes for French businesses in order to regain consumer confidence. She is vehemently anti-EU \u2013 a position that has found favour with republican French voters who believe the integrity of their nation is endangered by federal government. And she claims that the Front National has taken a truly \"feminist\" stance on maternity leave by devising a policy that would give stay-at-home parents a salary. Although, when I ask if she considers herself a feminist, she replies: \"No, not especially. I'm not obsessed with the rights of women, it can be a bit excessive. I want to put men and women on an equal footing. I think we are equal, but different.\" She is against positive discrimination or quota systems, believing that women should be treated on their own merits.</p> <p>\"Then, of course, we have our policies on immigration,\" she continues. \"More and more communities are asking for the introduction of their specific religious law and that is a threat to secularisation. It's particularly an issue among Muslim communities. Not all Muslims,\" she clarifies, hastily. \"Most Muslims in France are not fundamentalists. What is surprising is that the first generation of immigrants were very well assimilated. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/apr/10/france-burqa-law-kenza-drider\" title=\"They didn't wear the veil in public.\">They didn't wear the veil in public.</a> They kept their religion in the private sphere. Now whole immigrant communities are being created \u2013 because of past government policies \u2013 that are separate.\"</p> <p>In France, where the divorce of church from state underpinned the French revolution, secularisation is viewed as a basic tenet of the country's progressive thought. Since April 2011, women have been banned from wearing the burqa or the niqab in public. In this context, Mar\u00e9chal-Le Pen's comments are not especially controversial. But then she goes even further, outlining a plan to strip second-generation immigrants of citizenship if they commit a crime&#xa0;or refuse to learn French.</p> <p>\"Today, if someone is born in France, they automatically have French nationality even if they have made no effort to integrate,\" she says. \"We believe that French people should be prioritised for social housing and employment opportunities, if they have an equal competence.\"</p> <p>But what about the \"genuine\" French? If they commit a crime, will they too be stripped of their nationality?</p> <p>\"No. We're talking about people to whom we've done a favour,\" Mar\u00e9chal-Le Pen leans forward, elbows on her knees, legs apart. She maintains eye contact and talks with a kind of easy charm that could, in the right circumstances, be quite hypnotising. \"We've given them a certain number of privileges and if they haven't shown themselves to be worthy of French citizenship, then it's normal to take it back.\"</p> <p>This is all so smoothly expressed, that it takes a moment for the impact of it to hit home: that the law, under the Front National, would mean one thing for those descended from immigrants and another thing entirely for what Mar\u00e9chal-Le Pen views as the \"true\" French race.</p> <p>Isn't her stance racist? \"That accusation is largely used by our opponents to discredit us. I don't see how it's racist to prioritise French nationals. We're not talking about black or white. It's normal that French people who pay taxes should be prioritised, just as an Algerian who is naturalised will have priority [in social housing and employment].\"</p> <p>She points out that people from Martinique, for example, would not be subject to the proposed nationality restrictions because the Caribbean island is an officially designated region of France and goes on to name a number of Front National members from ethnic minority backgrounds, including Charlotte Soula, the office manager of Marine Le Pen who is of Algerian origin (and a convert from Islam to Catholicism).</p> <p>\"The racism argument is a very violent one but it works less and less,\" says Mar\u00e9chal-Le Pen. \"Now, on the ground, people don't think it any more of us. They understand it's a political tactic. Most people think we're right.</p> <p>\"It's a debate that stirs up emotions, of course it is. It's hard to talk about it because of the human dimension that affects people. We are not monsters. I have empathy, I am humane, I understand human misery. My grandfather always said: 'Don't be angry at the immigrants, be angry at the political class that created this situation.' I've nothing against people who come to France in search of a better life. If France had the means to welcome everyone, we would. We have that history [of tolerance]. But we don't have the means. We are in debt. Our welfare system is melting under the pressure. We have a colossal deficit. It's sad but we have to have the political courage to say 'stop'. And it's sad because, when we say 'stop', we are saying it to a man or a woman, but there we go.\"</p> <p>Immigration, she concedes, \"has also been good\" for France. The problem, as she sees it, is that past government policies have failed, causing resentment among those who believe their country is being overrun by \"outsiders\". She goes on to claim that a number of Muslim women, who feel pressurised into wearing the veil within their communities, are also supportive of her position.</p> <p>\"There are women who say to me, 'I can't wear a skirt,' or 'I'll be insulted if I don't wear a veil or don't go to the mosque.' There's a pressure within the community imposed by others. Those people, more and more, are calling on us to act because we are the only ones who see secularism as fundamentally important.\"</p> <p>Is the Front National becoming a political force to be reckoned with in France? The election of Mar\u00e9chal-Le Pen in June, alongside fellow party candidate Gilbert Collard, gave the party a foothold in parliament for the first time since the mid-1980s, but the first-past-the-post electoral system is still weighted against smaller parties. As a result, the popularity of the Front National \u2013 especially in impoverished, semi-urbanised rural areas where unemployment is high \u2013 might be far more ingrained than the electoral results suggest.</p> <p>As Hugh Schofield, a BBC news correspondent based in Paris, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-17824436\" title=\"\">wrote in an article last April</a>: \"In this semi-urbanised countryside, people feel the hopelessness of a life in poverty uncompensated-for by the traditions and structures that would have made it bearable in the past.</p> <p>\"Shops are now in vast out-of-town zones; no one goes to church; work is a 50km drive away. And the cost of the two staples \u2013 cigarettes and petrol \u2013 has just shot through the roof.</p> <p>\"For these people, a Front National vote offers both a protest (against the wealthy; against the EU; against the establishment), but also a claim: for an identity and the right to a traditional 'French' way of life.\"</p> <p>In urban areas, too, there are fears about mass immigration \u2013 fears that were heightened by the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2005_civil_unrest_in_France\" title=\"\">2005 riots</a> by mostly French youths of north African origin from the suburbs of Paris and other major cities. The riots highlighted chronic tensions caused by immigration and unemployment and the mainstream parties began to adopt the rhetoric of the Front National. Sarkozy, who was interior minister at the time, referred to the rioters as <em>racaille</em> or scum \u2013 a term viewed by some as having implicitly racist connotations.</p> <p>\"Sarkozy won in 2007 by shifting to the right and stealing FN votes,\" explains Matthew Fraser. \"In that sense, [Jean-Marie] Le Pen was ahead of his time \u2013 whether his views are despicable or not is a moral question, but what is certain is that they are electorally popular. And his adversaries understand this. Hence the paradox: they pretend the FN is ideologically unfrequentable, yet they steal the party's discourse and platforms to get elected. It's rather like borrowing someone's house to throw a party, but not inviting the owner.\"</p> <p>France has a long history with the far right which has traditionally been allied with the Catholic church (even the former president Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand was, as a young man, involved in conservative nationalist movements) and Marine Le Pen's attempts to decontaminate the image of the FN have not been without success. \"Today, the reality is that the extreme right is against us,\" she claimed in an interview for <em>The Nation</em> last year. \"The National Front has evolved.\"</p> <p>Despite a recent groundswell of support in provincial France, however, the party is still viewed with outright distaste among the Parisian chattering classes.</p> <p>\"In France it is acceptable, even fashionable, to espouse far-left political convictions, but absolutely unacceptable to belong to the far right,\" says Fraser. \"The explanation is largely historical. France has been living with the shame of the Nazi collaboration under the Vichy regime, after which the far right was marginalised from what are considered to be acceptable political values in France.\"</p> <p>And there are those who caution against believing that a leopard can change its spots. Alain Jakubowicz, the president of <a href=\"http://www.licra.org/\" title=\"\">Licra</a>, the international league against racism and antisemitism, puts it this way: \"Today, the party is represented by a young woman with a modern and normal appearance [but] the FN remains the same, with its xenophobic, racist and antisemitic DNA.\"</p> <p>Back in her office, Mar\u00e9chal-Le Pen insists that the Front National's transformation is not simply a superficial public relations exercise.</p> <p>\"Of course the party has evolved,\" she says. \"The problems are no longer the same, so evolution has happened naturally\u2026 When the Front National was created in the 1970s it was against the background of communism and the cold war. It was a real threat, now it's no longer the case\u2026 Now our main hobby-horse is anti-globalisation.\"</p> <p>She insists that she has only ever encountered \"a positive reaction\" on the street. \"Even people who don't share my politics, they say: 'I'm not Front National but I'm happy you're there because it creates debate.'\"</p> <p>Arnaud, her adviser, helpfully interrupts at this point to remind her that she recently went to a fashionable Parisian restaurant and was given a spontaneous round of applause by the diners. Mar\u00e9chal-Le Pen looks embarrassed.</p> <p>\"The owner was very kind and he took me around and said: 'Tonight we're welcoming Mademoiselle Mar\u00e9chal-Le Pen,' and everyone clapped,\" she says hurriedly. \"It was really kind.\"</p> <p>Does she ever receive hate mail?</p> <p>\"I've had one letter.\"</p> <p>Arnaud interjects. \"But if I get out all the ones that say how marvellous you are, how beautiful, there's no comparison,\" he gushes.</p> <p>It seems incredible that she has only ever had one piece of negative mail. I tell her that in the UK, journalists get more than that in any given week.</p> <p>\"The most aggressive people are other MPs,\" she says. \"Some of them are very aggressive, even though we've all been democratically elected.\" Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Cop\u00e9, the leader of the centre-right UMP party, has in the past refused to shake her hand. \"He might refuse to shake my hand, but his electors will gladly do so,\" is her response. Spoken like a true politician.</p> <p>I can see why Mar\u00e9chal-Le Pen is electable. In person, she has an engaging, accessible manner. There is the occasional glimpse of humour \u2013 when we are talking about her party's maternity leave policies, the subject of children comes up. Does she want a family? She guffaws. \"Yes, if I can find a suitable sperm donor.\"</p> <p>At the same time, I find her charisma unsettling because it is being deployed in the defence of some dubious beliefs. As the interview draws to a close, I tell her I have one final question and it's a personal one. She nods, encouraging me to go on.</p> <p>I am married to a man whose father came to the UK from Sudan, I say. If he lived in France under a Front National government, my husband would therefore fall into that category of second-generation immigrants who would have to prove deserving of a citizenship automatically conferred on others. Given this, I wonder what her position is on marriages between people from different backgrounds?</p> <p>Maybe it's because I'm expecting a reaction that I think I see a slight flinch in her face. It is a tiny movement: the expression of someone who has effectively masked their surprise.</p> <p>\"I'm not against it,\" she replies. \"For me, marriage is a very personal choice. The only thing&#xa0;I'd say is that I know, from people who've told me firsthand, that sadly mixed marriages can be a bit conflicted on everyday issues. For instance, the naming of children \u2013 Muslims need children to take Muslim names, often they want women to convert to Islam. The other surprising thing is that often, in a divorce, north African fathers take their children back to their country and the mother never sees them again. That causes problems. I don't judge, but it can cause conflict.\"</p> <p>And yet she has judged, making a series of sweeping assumptions on the basis of very little actual knowledge about a particular set of personal circumstances. Perhaps Mar\u00e9chal-Le Pen is right that immigration needs to be discussed and that MPs are wary of doing so in case they are accused of racism. Some of her opinions have the sheen of plausibility. She is not unlikable. But the tone of her last answer suggests a more disturbing set of beliefs at play beneath the surface: a whiff of something rotten at the core of her politics and a sense that the world is made up of people who can be divided easily into \"us\" or \"them\".</p> <p><strong>A family business: the Le Pen dynasty</strong></p> <h2><strong>Jean-Marie Le Pen</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398427508\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pixies/2012/10/26/1351256209846/Jean-Marie-Le-Pen-003.jpg\" alt=\"Jean-Marie Le Pen\" width=\"140\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Photograph: Chamussy/Sipa/Rex Features</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chamussy/Sipa/Rex Features</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>1928 </strong>Born 20 June in Brittany, the son of a fisherman.</p> <p><strong>1972</strong> Le Pen co-founds the Front National and presides over it for nearly 40 years.</p> <p><strong>1984</strong> Becomes an MEP.</p> <p><strong>1987</strong> Is found guilty of violating French law and fined 1.2m francs (\u00a3150,000) for remarks concerning the presence of gas chambers in Nazi concentration camps.

  "<p>Burma's president, Thein Sein, has admitted his country's Rohingya Muslim population has been subjected to an unprecedented wave of ethnic violence. Whole villages and large sections of towns have been destroyed.</p> <p>Thein Sein's admission follows release of shocking satellite images showing the scale of the destruction in one coastal town, where most \u2013 if not all \u2013 of the Muslim population appears to have been displaced and their homes wrecked.</p> <p>The pictures, acquired by Human Rights Watch, show destruction to the town of Kyaukpyu on the country's west coast. They reveal 14.4 hectares (35 acres) of destruction, in which some 811 buildings and houseboats have been destroyed.</p> <p>The images confirm reports of massive violence in the town over 24 hours around 24 October, three days after the first wave of attacks. The incidents in Arakan province \u2013 also known as Rakhine \u2013 have displaced thousands of people in what appears to have been a wave of ethnic cleansing pitting Arakan Buddhists against Muslims. \"There have been incidents of whole villages and parts of the towns being burned down,\" Thein Sein's spokesman said. A government official initially put the death toll at 112 but later revised it to 67.</p> <p>Thein Sein's comments follow a warning from the office of UN general secretary Ban Ki-moon that ethnic violence was endangering political progress in Burma. The latest violence in Burma comes as the government is struggling to contain ethnic and religious tensions suppressed during nearly a half century of military rule that ended last year. Inter-ethnic violence broke out earlier this year, triggered by the rape and murder of a Buddhist woman by three Muslim men.</p> <p>Human Rights Watch said it had identified 633 buildings and 178 houseboats and floating barges destroyed, in an area occupied predominantly by Rohingyas. A committee of MPs led by Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi called on Friday for security reinforcements and swift legal action against those behind the killings and destruction.</p> <p>According to Reuters, dozens of boats full of Rohingyas fled Kyaukpyu, an industrial zone important to China, and other recent areas of violence and were trying to reach overcrowded refugee camps around the state capital, Sittwe.</p> <p>Some 3,000 Rohingyas were reported to have been blocked from reaching Sittwe by government forces and landed on a nearby island.</p> <p>\"Burma's government urgently needs to provide security for the Rohingya in Arakan, who are under vicious attack,\" said Phil Robertson, deputy Asia director at Human Rights Watch. \"Unless the authorities also start addressing the root causes of the violence, it is only likely to get worse.\"</p> <p>Human Rights Watch fears the death toll may be far higher than has been given so far. Its estimates are based on allegations from witnesses fleeing scenes of carnage and the government's history of underestimating figures.</p> <p>Rohingyas are officially stateless. The government, controlled by Buddhists, regards the estimated 800,000 Rohingyas in the country as illegal immigrants from Bangladesh, and not as one of the country's 135 official ethnic groups, and denies them citizenship. But many of those expelled from Kyaukpyu are not Rohingya but Muslims from the officially recognised Kaman minority, said Chris Lewa, director of the Rohingya advocacy group, Arakan Project. \"It's not just anti-Rohingya violence any more, it's anti-Muslim,\" Lewa said.</p>",

Tech companies' success often depends on the skills of their development team. This is why both tech startups and large technology-dependent enterprises are desperate to find experienced, highly skilled software professionals. Every day, we are asked by tech startups how and where they can find good people. Our jobs board at Skills Matter is absolutely packed with vacancies advertising 'cool' projects and teams, begging people to join them.</p> <p>\"The government can help in a number of ways. Provide tech companies with funding or tax breaks to fund training in advanced technology. And relax immigration rules for the highly skilled. In the meantime, we should provide the next generation with actual programming skills (as opposed to MS Office skills) very early on \u2013 by supporting initiatives such as <a href=\"http://www.computingatschool.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Computing at School</a> and <a href=\"http://appsforgood.org/\" title=\"\">Apps for Good</a>, so that in 10 years' time, we'll be in a better position.\"</p> <h2><strong>Joe Cohen</strong></h2> <p>Founder and chief executive of&#xa0;<a href=\"http://www.seatwave.com/\" title=\"\">Seatwave</a></p> <p><strong>\"Make all of London Tech City\"</strong></p> <p>\"The government focuses on publicising Old Street and the Olympic Park \u2013 but so far the winners are all over&#xa0;London. Betfair are in Hammersmith, Spotify are in Soho, Wonga are located in Camden and Skype in Fitzrovia. Whether it's promoting London or east London [as a tech hub], from a PR point of view, wouldn't make that much difference. If you look at what's going on around Old Street, while there are certainly some success stories, you have companies at an earlier stage with a higher probability of failure.</p> <p>\"Why wouldn't you just claim the winners, wherever they are in London? History may prove me wrong when Crossrail is finished and maybe the Olympic Park [will] become a really popular place. But until that happens, I can't imagine you'll have many people who'll move into that space of their own free will, without the government twisting their arms.</p> <p>\"Broadband provisioning is also a major issue. It's amazing to me, because you would just think that market forces would solve this \u2013 but it doesn't seem to be happening. If I start a company tomorrow and ring up to get a dedicated line in, it's going to take 100 days. And that's if you're lucky.\"</p> <h2><strong>Neil Rimer</strong></h2> <p>Partner, Index Ventures</p> <p><strong>\"Lionise entrepreneurs\"</strong></p> <p>\"I'm very impressed with the way the government has positioned London as a hub for entrepreneurship. I think lionising entrepreneurs is a good thing \u2013 having educators and officials who recognise the value and importance of entrepreneurs in society. There are parts of the world where entrepreneurs are looked up to much more than here. I read about an entrepreneur here who said when he tells people he's an entrepreneur, they&#xa0;feel sorry for him, as if he can't get&#xa0;a real job. That shouldn't be the case.</p> <p>\"[Tech] is the next industrial revolution and these people are the pioneers. This is what the country needs. You can't continue to rely on natural resources, traditional goods and insurance companies for growth and job creation. Schools and universities need to do more to promote entrepreneurship as a lifestyle, a career and an ethic. They need to make sure that all children are given access to great education in maths and science and engineering so we don't end up with a lopsided employment pool. We invested in a company called <a href=\"http://www.codecademy.com/#!/exercises/0\" title=\"\">Code Academy</a>.

The way to think of London is the way you think of financial services markets in offshoot countries. Singapore and Hong Kong are vibrant markets in Asia. However, they are markets that are subservient to the two global markets that really matter in finance \u2013 New York and London. [In tech terms] London has a very good shot at becoming an offshoot market. Really what the government should be focused on is how we work in harmony with Silicon Valley. A lot of that is bridge-building between those two economies and they've not done a good job there so far.</p> <p>\"The best parallel for success, if you take this thesis, is New York. New York was by and large a nonexistent tech centre, and then a few things happened that made a material difference. One was Google set up an engineering centre. One of the best ways to bridge is exactly what New York did \u2013 get a company that is out on the west coast to open up not a sales office but an engineering centre&#xa0;here.&#xa0;The&#xa0;government needs to spend a lot of&#xa0;energy doing this, because without that depth of managerial and engineering talent, you will not get big companies in your&#xa0;backyard.\" </p> <h2><strong>Stephen Ball</strong></h2> <p>General manager of Hitachi Data Systems UK</p> <p><strong>\"Develop the next generation of coders\"</strong></p> <p>\"We all heard the prime minister's speech, but the reality is I don't know what Tech City is. I've been in this industry for 25 years and as a leader of a big [technology] company in the UK, and while I do accept that our focus isn't working with internet startups, I would have expected Tech City to have hit my radar on a regular basis.

I would have also expected [the government] to come to me to see how I could help incubate some of those skills.</p> <p>\"We could help some of these young&#xa0;companies with things like mentoring and, possibly, invest in them. But no one's asked that question of me or any colleagues in other [similar] organisations. Also, I don't see anything in the school curriculum that is going to help us create the next Google in this country in terms of coding capability. My kids aren't allowed to take their phones to school [to build apps], and while they do take ICT classes, it's all based around Windows rather than coding and social media.

Traditionally a lot of companies head to&#xa0;Silicon Valley for the large, later-stage investment, because that investment is there. Equally, when you want to float you still head to New York. Two things need to be done. The first is happening slowly anyway, which is educating the market itself. Second, the&#xa0;rules and regulations around floating are considerably more&#xa0;onerous and difficult to go through here.</p> <p>\"I've seen several companies abandon float plans in London and shift them to the Nasdaq [in New York] because of it. The government is working on that, but more needs to be done. Much more also needs to be done with government procurement. When I spoke at the launch [of Tech City], I talked about trying to build a booking system for sport. It took two years and we're finally working very closely with Sport England \u2013 and they&#xa0;wouldn't have worked with us until the government said: 'You have to work with some startups.'

It is located just west of Silicon Roundabout \u2013 an area sprinkled with fashion boutiques, up-and-coming and more established designers, and unique cafes selling vintage clothing and strong espresso to budding tech entrepreneurs.</p> <p>\"That inspiring setting is partly because of the government's effort in encouraging large digital companies such as Google, entrepreneurs and investors to set up shop in Tech City. The government was smart to see that as one of the keys to the success of Silicon Valley, but they should be looking at this as just one initiative among many to make London a global centre of tech. Additional priorities include education programmes that encourage young Brits to pursue careers as entrepreneurs, engineers and designers. Organisations such as the <a href=\"http://www.princes-trust.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Prince's Trust</a> are getting this kickstarted, but they could use help. The UK needs a group of angel investors who are eager to invest their time and their millions in helping businesses get off the ground.

  "<p>\"Public space\" is something that most people involved in the design and planning of buildings \u2013 planners, developers, architects \u2013 say is a good thing. Any development of flats or offices, above a certain size, comes with its patches of grass or granite, seasoned with bits of art or fountain and suffused with a vague ambition to be like Las Ramblas, the Piazza Navona or whatever. I have never heard anyone in the business say that public space should be suppressed and stamped out, yet it is rare for the respect it commands to be matched by a close interest in what it actually is and what makes it work.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.muf.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Muf architecture/art </a>is a practice led by the artist Katherine Clarke and the architect Liza Fior. They \"want to see what happens if you are Forrest Gumpishly literal about the claims people make\". Where others might mouth platitudes about social inclusion, or regeneration, or legacy, or public realm, they want to find out what they actually mean and realise them in practice. They choose to treat truisms as if they're true.</p> <p>I have long been sympathetic to this attitude and so I find myself on some land next to the busy tracks in and out of East Croydon station, part surrounded by works of middle-period Colonel Seifert, stubby, mannered 1960s towers from the time when Croydon aspired to be a little Manhattan. I would call this spot a wasteland, except that part of the muf philosophy is that every place has some value. Here, it turns out, there are 76 species of plant, to which attention is drawn by some winding paths and little&#xa0;hillocks.</p> <p>This spot is officially called Ruskin Square, in honour of the fact that the grandmother of the great, mad, Victorian aesthete once owned a pub here. Muf \"wanted to put the Ruskin back into Ruskin Square\", so they try to make real some of his ideas. Muf see the weedy landscape, ambitiously, as a minor version of the Lake District he loved, or at least as a recollection of his ability to see beauty in humble things.</p> <p>Muf were also inspired by Ruskin's belief that work without play is a meaningless endeavour. Their clients are the developers <a href=\"http://www.stanhopeplc.com/?page=21&amp;id=443\" title=\"\">Stanhope</a>, which wanted an open space to serve the commercial development that will arrive here some time in the future. Muf wanted to make a place that would be an asset to the area as soon as possible and thereby be richer than \"lobby landscapes and pointless trees\" when office workers eventually turn up.</p> <p>They installed two cricket practice nets, long oblongs whose mesh walls create a diverting layered effect. They are there because muf found out that Afghan refugees, who come to Croydon because the UK Border Agency is based here, like playing cricket and don't have anywhere much to do so. So there the refugees are, along with other nationalities and sometimes assisted by coaches from Surrey County Cricket Club, thwacking ball with bat, against the background rumble of trains.</p> <p>With the wind blowing through the vegetation as well, the landscape consists of several kinds of motion. The place should also be animated by a simple connection muf made, via a door in the rear wall, to the Warehouse theatre, which backs on to the site. But unfortunately cuts by the local council closed it.</p> <p>Ruskin Square exemplifies several aspects of the muf method, such as placing the human activities in a space above its physical form and therefore a belief that a project neither begins nor ends. Rather, it grows out of what is already there and creates a setting for what might happen in the future. \"The temporary inscribes the ambitions for the permanent,\" says Liza&#xa0;Fior.</p> <p>They have an ability to make unlikely connections, an associative imagination on overdrive, that manages to link Ruskin, weeds, Afghans, cricket, the theatre and a few other things in a single place. They are romantic, but also precise, and their work is based on the close observation of the sites they are given. They have a way of rearranging the cliches of their business \u2013 greenery, art, engagement with communities \u2013 such that they are not cliches any more.</p> <p>If activity comes first, this does not mean they are uninterested in fixed architecture: they scatter memorable and enticing elements about the landscape, such as a fictional ruin or a strategically placed bench, in a way reminiscent of English landscape gardens. \"Embracing the picturesque of incident\" is what they call it, \"a way of finding yourself in a place\". They create new realities out of the actual, such as the presence of the refugee cricketers, and imaginative embellishment, such as the weeds as Lake District.</p> <p>They have been working like this since the early 1990s, when Fior was teaching at the Architectural Association and Clarke was a technician there. \"We found ourselves in a gender minority,\" says Clarke, and they saw in each other \"someone with whom you could have a different conversation\".</p> <p>Each had had experiences of collective political idealism. Clarke had been part of the Greenham Common women's peace camp, and as a girl Fior had witnessed the bloodless revolution in Portugal, where her father lived. \"It showed how much a place can change,\" she says, \"but also how fragile that change is.\" Both were interested in seeing, as Clarke puts it, \"how you can democratise the power of art without losing that power\".</p> <p>Someone called Clarke, Fior and their friends \"the mufia\" and when they found themselves working together, and had to choose a name for their nascent practice, they chose muf. It's a name that still causes a certain amount of discomfort in clients and others obliged to say it (and Ruskin would have struggled with it). It declares that they are not greatly concerned with commercial acceptance and it has undoubtedly cost them work \u2013 it is horribly tempting to say that they are the Pussy Riot of architecture, but a decade or two in advance of the Russians.</p> <p>They have pursued their ideas with consistency and some obstreperousness, plugging the gaps in public patronage with their own energy. \"No one ever says do something beautiful,\" says Fior, \"so there's always an unsolicited brief. We always make research that no one pays for. It's a terrible business model.\" The main difference between their practice at the beginning and now, she says, \"is that we've got better at not getting sacked. Touch wood.\"</p> <p>All through the Blair years they seriously pursued the ideals that his government was supposed to believe in, such as social inclusion, without being greatly rewarded. Now they find themselves more in demand then ever before. London 2012 brought them work in Hackney Wick, on the fringe of the Olympic Park, and on \"High Street 2012\", the route through the East End where the marathon was going to be run and then wasn't. Now they are working with the developer <a href=\"http://about.taylorwimpey.co.uk/Information-Centre/News-and-Events/Schools-and-Community/chobham-manor.htm\" title=\"\">Taylor Wimpey on Chobham Manor</a>, the first new neighbourhood in the Olympic Park. Not long ago, it would have been impossible to imagine this happening.</p> <p>Sometimes, they're hired in a tokenistic way, in order to fulfil a public promise at minimal cost. However, Sebastian Balcombe of Taylor Wimpey shows every sign of getting the muf message. \"Their most powerful idea is that you grow a place through interim uses,\" he says. He also likes the fact that they are not the \"yes men\" he finds some of his consultants to be: \"Liza is a fantastic character, absolutely brilliant and very frustrating. They fight for their ideas. They make life difficult in a positive way.\"</p> <p>It is remarkable to hear a developer talk like this. Usually, they seek the smoothest possible path to getting the job done. It could, conceivably, be a sign that muf's ideas are at last reaching a wider audience. I hope so. In their understanding of public space, as something mobile and shaped by activity, but also as something singular and distinct in each manifestation, they have got it more right than anyone else in the business.</p>",
  "<p>My vision of what Scotland ought to look like, independent or not, does not make any outrageous demands. Well, perhaps just this: that one day we will be represented at an international football tournament by men who don't look like they have just finished a shift in a meat-packing factory. I am optimistic, though, that the rest of them can be obtained without too much upheaval.</p> <p>I simply want Scottish society to be built on the principles of social justice and to possess, at its core, a preferential option for the poor, the vulnerable and the dispossessed. The costs of pursuing this goal would be insignificant when set against the financial benefits of lifting even one in 10 of the young people whom we currently dismiss as beyond redemption by dint of their post code out of deprivation. How difficult can it be to quantify how many people from our least affluent neighbourhoods have obtained a university education in the last 20 years or a vocational course that led to a professional career?</p> <p>Would it be unreasonable to set for ourselves an objective of increasing this number by 10% by 2020? Alex Salmond has already chosen this year as the deadline by which we must deliver an assortment of eye-watering climate change targets and has set aside <a href=\"http://www.2020climategroup.org.uk/news/alex-salmond-launches-103m-renewable-energy-fund/\" title=\"\">\u00a3103m</a> to help us do so. I'm sure there is merit in these proposals. They all seem lovely, aromatic and diaphanous and will ensure that Scotland looks clean and smells nice in all its important little places. But we ought only to be worrying about the climate once we have taken care of the poverty and inequality that attack the health of our nation much more than those recalcitrant emissions.</p> <p>I also want Scotland to welcome, with arms outstretched, all the immigrants, refugees and asylum seekers that we can manage. Our nation has been blessed with a fertile and beautiful landscape, wide-open spaces and an endless coastline that, together with a small population, make this country one of the most sustainable and bountiful on the planet. To keep it to ourselves and close it off to the needy of other lands would be selfish, petty and intolerant. It would also be self-defeating because we need more immigrants to work here and to contribute taxes to help sustain our economy.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.snp.org/\" title=\"\">SNP</a> have grasped all of this more than any of their competitors. There was a motif running through their <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-20017882\" title=\"\">conference</a> in Perth last weekend that suggested to neutral observers such as me that it is becoming the only party in the United Kingdom to make an unconditional commitment to social justice and real welfare. Much of this was fuelled by the crass and foolish words of the Labour leader, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-19789324\" title=\"\">Johann Lamont</a>, when she announced her cuts commission by telling us that we must stop expecting \"something for nothing\". Those words and the SNP's response will be far more significant, come 2014, than the introspective musings on what sort of legal advice the first minister might have taken on an independent Scotland's entry into the European Union.</p> <p>There was also a little fringe event that took place just away from all the skirling and the tartan malarkey that normally takes place on a conference Saturday night. Organised by the <a href=\"http://www.bridgesprogrammes.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Bridges Programmes, </a>it sought to debate how Scotland intends to treat immigration and asylum in the 21st century. An indication of how critical this issue is to the SNP was given by the fact that <a href=\"http://www.fionahyslop.com/\" title=\"\">Fiona Hyslop</a>, Scotland's cabinet secretary for culture and external affairs, gave the main address and the meeting was chaired by J<a href=\"http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/politics/lets-take-our-chance-for-a-fairer-better-1380877\" title=\"\">oan McAlpine</a>, one of the party's rising stars. It's become clear that their party has grasped the importance of these issues to Scotland's future. For the first time in more than a century, the country's population rose this year on the back of inward migration and the nationalists have acknowledged that this will be a key mechanism in helping them reach their population targets.</p> <p>The attitude to inward migration held by the government in Scotland is very different from that held by Westminster. Immigration as a reserved matter is influenced by the pressures on the south east of England and persistent assurances by the home secretaries that Britain is full up do not represent the positions in other parts of the UK, including regions in England, Northern Ireland and in Scotland as a whole. Already, the shrill and implacable voices of the myopic right in England are urging David Cameron to tighten immigration even further. For the SNP, though, this presents a clear opportunity to develop a fair and just immigration system that will draw many potential supporters to them in Scotland's main centres of population. More importantly, it will help remove from them the stigma of being inward, narrowly focused and protectionist. It will demonstrate that Scotland is a big-hearted and compassionate country that is at peace with itself and the world.</p> <p>It was also significant that, just a few weeks earlier, a nationalist councillor in Glasgow, <a href=\"http://www.glasgowsnp.org/option,com_sobipro/sid,57:Council-candidates/Itemid,0/\" title=\"\">Feargal Dalton</a>, was responsible for persuading the city to build a long overdue memorial to the <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-glasgow-west-19589873\" title=\"\">Irish potato famine</a>. Few other events in the last two centuries have made as much cultural, social and spiritual impact as <a href=\"http://www.thegreathunger.org/\" title=\"\">An Gorta Mor</a> on Glasgow and west central Scotland in particular. In every other city in the world where Irish immigrants settled following the famine, there is already a memorial, but this one has the potential to become something special. For it can help to heal the wounds of sectarian division that have marked part of my great city's history. For the memorial will not simply be a totem for the Irish Catholics who died in the famine, but to the Protestants who died in it too, and to the Highlanders who were also blighted by its effects.</p> <p>When it is constructed, there should be no room for asking why it took so long and making empty demands for apologies. Instead, it should stand for reconciliation and a reminder of how good immigration can be for Scotland.</p> <p>Comments will be turned on later this morning</p>",
  "<p>John Carpenter's best movies are his first four or five, made between 1974 and 1980, all of them genre flicks where imagination, intelligence, wit and chutzpah were called into play by the exigencies of low budgets and short shooting schedules. The third, the hugely influential <em>Halloween</em> (made in 1978 and revived for the forthcoming trick-or-treat fest) is the ultimate refined slasher movie, a style of exploitation picture spawned by Hitchcock's <em>Psycho</em>. The opening shot, a long, virtuoso hand-held take with a subjective camera, introduces us to the five-year-old murderer Michael Myers who 15 years later escapes from the state asylum to his midwestern home town, there to don a mask and terrorise high school kids on Halloween night. His name is a tribute to the independent British distributor Michael Myers, a great Wardour Street character, who did a fine job promoting <em>Assault on Precinct 13</em>. Making her screen debut as an intrepid babysitter is future \"scream queen\" Jamie Lee Curtis, whose mother Janet Leigh played Marion Crane in <em>Psycho</em>, and Donald Pleasence is a fierce presence as the psychiatrist pursuing Myers. He's called Sam Loomis, the name of Marion Crane's boyfriend. The movie was shot in 12 days for $320,000 and took $117m worldwide. Carpenter wrote the eerie music himself, and the widescreen cinematography is by Dean Cundey, who based the night scenes on Edward Hopper's sinister painting <a href=\"http://www.wikipaintings.org/en/edward-hopper/rooms-for-tourists\" title=\"\"><em>Rooms for Tourists</em></a> with its absence of people, sharply lit facades and pitch-black night. Cundey was later to light the <em>Back to the Future</em> trilogy and <em>Jurassic Park</em>.</p>",
  "<p>One of them was born in South Africa and attended the exclusive and expensive Hilton college before coming to board at Harrow as a teenager. The other has his roots firmly planted in Sheffield.</p> <p>One of them is a 29-year-old man of the world who has scored almost 10,000 runs for two counties. The other is only 21, has made four first-class centuries, and only just passed 30 County Championship matches for Yorkshire.</p> <p>One of them has one of the most resonant surnames in British sport, never mind cricket, as his grandfather Denis made 78 Test appearances for England, as well as 60 with a bigger ball for Arsenal \u2013 and even his father, Richard, played first-class cricket for Natal. The other comes from humbler sporting stock, although his dad achieved the notable double of winning club competitions with Sheffield Collegiate at Lord's and Sheffield Tigers at Twickenham in the space of a few months in 2000.</p> <p>It is irresistible to talk up the contrast between the two candidates to open the batting with the new Test captain, Alastair Cook, when England begin the post-Strauss era this week. Yet it may also be a little misleading. Certainly, Nick Compton has had to graft for this first senior call-up, however privileged his background. And Joe Root did not exactly emerge from a mineshaft with flat cap and whippet, having grown up in Sheffield's prosperous suburbs and crossed the Nottinghamshire border to attend fee-paying Worksop college in the sixth form \u2013 a couple of years after Samit Patel, another member of this England tour squad, had left.</p> <p>Richard Ibbotson, the chairman of Root's Collegiate club who also watched Michael Vaughan rise through the junior ranks a couple of decades ago, came within an injury of getting to know Compton much better the winter before last, as the pair were due to link up on an MCC trip to Japan and Indonesia. \"I was player-manager, and Nick was supposed to be my captain,\" Ibbotson explained. \"We had a couple of chats on the phone but then it turned out he needed an operation, so he had to pull out and was replaced by Keith Medlycott.\"</p> <p>That small coincidence shows that, in some ways, Compton's rise to England contention has been as rapid as Root's \u2013 it has just come much later in his career. It's an intriguing story, too, as it has come as the result of a close working relationship with Neil Burns, the former Somerset and Leicestershire wicket keeper.</p> <p>He had moved into mentoring and mind-coaching after his retirement in 2001, reforming the London County Cricket Club \u2013 for whom in 1904 WG Grace scored the last of his 126 first-class centuries \u2013 to work on the theories he had developed during his playing career. After enjoying early success in helping to revive the career of Darren Stevens, who has since given such good value to Kent, Burns was put in touch with Compton by Gordon Lord, the England and Wales Cricket Board's head of elite coach development.</p> <p>\"Nick was having a really tough time,\" Burns recalls. \"He was only 20, and he wasn't sure if his contract with Middlesex was going to be renewed. Our relationship built slowly \u2013 we worked hard in the winter of 2005-06, when he came out to my academy in Cape Town. He then had a fantastic 2006 season, made an England A tour, and came back and opened the batting with Alastair Cook for the MCC against Sussex, the champion county.\"</p> <p>A good omen for Ahmedabad? Perhaps not. \"He nicked off for nought,\" Burns adds. \"I agreed to support him from arm's length, but Nick went through a difficult spell after that. KP was all the rage, there were lots of eye-catching players out there and that became a distraction from the signature strokes he had.\" At the end of the 2009 season, Burns helped to steer Compton to Somerset, one of his old counties.</p> <p>\"Sometimes you need that fresh start, so that people perceive you as you are today not how you used to be,\" the mentor explains. \"I thought Nick was capable of being a high achiever in cricket, with leadership potential and capable of being a Test match batsman. It was a little bit now or never.\"</p> <p>The runs began to flow more freely in Somerset \u2013 1,010 at 56 in the Championship in 2011 \u2013 but last winter Burns and Compton refocused, deliberately and strategically. \"I thought there was a niche in the market for what I call proper batting,\" he adds. \"Nick had the capability for that, so that's where the work needed to go. That's the great thing about him, his willingness to work so hard: to do his training with Somerset, then drive two hours to me at Ascot and do some more.\"</p> <p>That work was often unorthodox: Burns talks of cranking the bowling machine up to full pace and turning off the lights, as well as t'ai chi, meditation and Bikram yoga at 40C. But most importantly, \"hitting an incredible number of balls for hours at a time \u2013 the whole point being to create conditions far beyond what he was going to face in the middle\".</p> <p>\"The challenge we set him technically was to develop the best forward defensive in world cricket, the best backward defensive in world cricket, to become the most judicious leaver on fourth and fifth stump,\" Burns continues. \"We refocused goals, so instead of thinking in terms of scoring runs, it was about how many balls you faced.\"</p> <p>The results were impressive \u2013 only some badly timed Worcester drizzle denied Compton the chance to become the first batsman since Graeme Hick to score 1,000 first-class runs by the end of May. Now he has the shot at establishing himself in Test cricket that he and Burns have coveted for years. Will England plump for his experience alongside Cook at the top of the order, or give Root the chance to establish himself for years to come? The team selection for the opening tour match, against India A, which starts in Mumbai on Tuesday, will provide the first clue.</p>",
  "<p>Hans Werner Henze, who has died aged 86, created an outstanding body of musical works with theatrical and literary dimensions in the opera house, the concert hall and beyond. German-born, but long resident in Italy, he was continental Europe's leading composer of operas in the period following the second world war, during and beyond the decades when Benjamin Britten held the equivalent position in British musical life.</p> <p>One of the most prolific exponents of the genre, he composed two dozen overall, some in radically different versions, embracing full-scale grand opera, chamber opera, comic opera, a triple-bill of one-acters, concert works, radio works and hybrids with other theatrical forms such as the musical (La Cubana, 1973) and ballet (Venus and Adonis, 1997). His most recent opera, Gisela! Or the Strange and Memorable Ways of Happiness, was premiered in 2010.</p> <p>He also composed a dozen ballets \u2013 including the full-evening Ondine with Frederick Ashton for Covent Garden (1958, revived most recently in 2008), and Orpheus, to a scenario by the playwright Edward Bond (1979) \u2013 as well as incidental music to stage plays and films. His output for the concert hall ran to more than 200 separate works, including <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEXTZy7V0zE&amp;feature=related\" title=\"YouTube: First Symphony\">10 symphonies</a>, numerous concertos and <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8gFD7amdOY&amp;feature=related\" title=\"YouTube: Fantasia for Strings\">other orchestral works</a>, five string quartets and other chamber, instrumental and vocal pieces.</p> <p>The connecting thread between this <a href=\"http://www.schott-music.com/shop/persons/featured/hans-werner-henze/works/\" title=\"List of works on the Schott website\">vast array of works</a> in so many disparate genres was politics, a commitment to which never left him, although varying in degree over time. Henze adhered throughout his life to leftwing ideologies, a reaction to his youth in Nazi Germany, which left an indelible mark on his creative psyche. He was not afraid of courting controversy, even as recently as last month: \"So long as there are people living in Israel who endured the Nazi concentration camps, Wagner should not be performed there. I see no pressing reason to play Hitler's favourite music.\"</p> <p>He was born in G\u00fctersloh, North Rhine-Westphalia, the eldest of six children to Margarete Henze and her teacher husband, Franz. During the 1930s, Franz was gradually seduced to the Nazi cause, to the dismay of his son, who 40 years on wrote of how he heard his father \"in his Nazi uniform, roaming drunkenly through the woods with his party cronies, bawling out repulsive songs such as When Jewish Blood Splashes Off Your Knife. These are traumatic memories.\" Hans was forcibly enrolled in the Hitler Youth at 12.</p> <p>Around the time that he started studying at the Braunschweig state music school, he gained a fuller idea of the extent of Nazi oppression. \"If someone like myself,\" he later reminisced, \"a 15-year-old living in the depths of the country knew about the concentration camps by the beginning of the 1940s, then other people, adults, definitely knew better than me what was going on.\"</p> <p>The young composer's growing disgust with his compatriots intensified after the war through their refusal to accept responsibility for what had occurred. He observed the reactions of an audience following a performance of Hindemith's symphony Mathis der Maler: \"There was an undertone of, 'Now that <a href=\"http://books.google.co.uk/books/about/Hindemith_Hartmann_and_Henze.html?id=u-wYAQAAIAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y\" title=\"Google Books: Hindemith, Hartmann and Henze, by Guy Rickards\">Hindemith</a> can be played again, our guilt is removed, everything is right with the world, isn't it?'\"</p> <p>The continuance of much of the Nazi administrative apparatus, perpetuated by the cold war, was a development he found irreconcilable with his sense of shame over the Holocaust. On a personal level, he experienced social isolation as a homosexual in an increasingly boorish, intolerant society: on one occasion he narrowly escaped imprisonment after a dawn raid.</p> <p>By 1944 he was a radio officer with a tank division. Brief internment by the British forces introduced him to the BBC, and a wider range of music on the radio.</p> <p>After studies with Wolfgang Fortner, he became a repetiteur and conductor, especially for ballet, from 1948 in Konstanz, on the border with Switzerland, then from 1950 at the Hesse state theatre in Wiesbaden. He produced a string of short, inventive ballet scores and his first operas: The Magic Theatre (1949), after Cervantes; Boulevard Solitude (1952), a reworking of Manon Lescaut; and A Country Doctor (1951), after Kafka, originally conceived for radio and reworked 14 years later for the stage.</p> <p>Despite this burgeoning theatrical career, Henze was deeply unhappy, his disaffection underlined by a holiday in Italy with its unbombed cities, leftwing political orientation and friendly, tolerant people. When his publisher, <a href=\"http://www.schott-music.com/shop/persons/featured/hans-werner-henze/works/\" title=\"Henze's profile on the Schott website\">Schott's</a>, offered him a large advance on royalties on condition that he relinquish his conducting posts and devote himself to composition, he leapt at the chance.</p> <p>Crossing the Italian border in 1953, he kept on driving until he reached Venice. Eventually, he made his home in Marino, south-east of Rome, with his partner of more than 40 years, Fausto Moroni, whose quiet fortitude helped enable Henze to weather personal crises in the early 1970s.</p> <p>One of the earliest works from his exile to make its mark was the cello concerto Ode to the West Wind (1953), after Shelley's famous poem inspired by the Peterloo massacre of 1819. The set of Five Neapolitan Songs (1956) bears an Italianate singability unheard before in Henze's output.</p> <p>However, the major work of his first years in Italy was the fantastical opera K\u00f6nig Hirsch (King Stag, 1956), to a libretto by Heinz von Cramer after Carlo Gozzi's play. The score meant a great deal to Henze \u2013 indeed, he has written that it was a \"diary, an autobiography, which tells how I discovered music\" \u2013 and he returned to it over and again to make revisions or extracts for concert performance, including his Fourth Symphony (1955).</p> <p>The opera's premiere in Berlin was highly controversial. Its conductor, Hermann Scherchen, known to orchestral players as \"the Red Dictator\" and a dominant force in the contemporary musical scene, made many cuts of sections he felt were reactionary. The opera's intelligibility was thereby compromised, and members of the audience protested for half an hour after the premiere, holding both Henze and Scherchen to blame. The score as Henze intended it was produced in something resembling its original form only in 1985.</p> <p>Despite this disappointment, demand for Henze's music continued to intensify and he enjoyed collaborations with many leading artists, including the film-maker Luchino Visconti, who provided the libretto for the jazz ballet Maratona (1957), and WH Auden and Chester Kallman, librettists of the operas Elegy for Young Lovers (1961) and The Bassarids (1966). His orchestral Antifonie was written for Herbert von Karajan and the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra, who disliked the score and delayed performing it for two years, until 1962. His orchestrally brilliant Fifth Symphony, inspired by 20th-century Rome, was first performed by Leonard Bernstein's New York Philharmonic.</p> <p>Henze's trips to the US for that premiere in 1963 and as a visiting professor four years later were important for regalvanising his sense of political involvement, which had begun to slumber in the Italian sun. He was deeply affected by the civil rights and anti-Vietnam war movements and on his return to Europe began to take a more public stance. He campaigned for the social democrat Willy Brandt as chancellor in the 1965 election, though with a feeling of \"uselessness and impotence\", and from 1967 to 1969 more successfully for the release of the composer Isang Yun, abducted and imprisoned by the South Korean authorities.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398484272\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/28/1351456422000/Hans-Werner-Henze-008.jpg\" alt=\"Hans Werner Henze\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nadja Mchantaf and Giorgio Berrugi in the premiere production of Henze's final opera, Gisela!

Photograph: Norbert Millauer/dapd</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Norbert Millauer/dapd</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>At the same time, Henze was beginning to experience a crisis with his music. Barely 40, he was unquestionably a leading European figure. Despite severe critical misgivings, he had succeeded in fusing a style simultaneously radical but acceptable to modern audiences. He enjoyed a string of great public successes, much to the disgust of avant-garde figures such as <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2007/dec/07/7\" title=\"\">Karlheinz Stockhausen</a> and Pierre Boulez, including the premieres of the comic opera Der Junge Lord (1965) and, at the Salzburg festival the following year, The Bassarids. For all his acclaim, Henze felt he lacked direction and needed a cause. He found it in 1968 in the student protest movement. His association with the students (he even sheltered their leader, Rudi Dutschke, after an assassination attempt) was to have severe consequences for his standing in Germany. His style lost its opulence and lyricism in favour of a leaner, more angular sound, seemingly designed to be provocative.</p> <p>The crucial flashpoint occurred on 9 December 1968, at the Hamburg premiere of his <em>oratorio volgare e militare</em>, The Raft of the Medusa. The music was not heard that night, as a riot ensued when first a poster of the recently killed Che Guevara, to whom the score was dedicated, and then a red flag were in turn displayed and torn down.</p> <p>Although a studio recording was made without incident a few months later, and a public performance given in Vienna in 1971, the oratorio became infamous. Most of Henze's German friends and associates deserted him, and he became a pariah in his homeland.</p> <p>The composer's response was largely to turn his back on Germany for 15 years. His frustration and rage found expression in the deeply disturbing cantata Essay on Pigs (1968), written for the London Sinfonietta, and in a further shift to the political left. He made two highly productive visits to Castro's Cuba in 1969-70 from which emerged several important compositions: the much-misunderstood Sixth Symphony, a concerto \u2013 Compases para Preguntas Ensimismadas (Metres for Questions Absorbed in Self-contemplation) \u2013 for viola, the cantata El Cimarr\u00f3n and La Cubana. This last was one of several works Henze wrote with Hans Magnus Enzensberger, some of whose poems he included alongside texts by Cuban writers, Bertolt Brecht and Ho Chi Minh in his kaleidoscopic song-cycle Voices (1973), perhaps his most characteristic creation.</p> <p>Shortly afterwards he began an association with Bond that, as well as the Orpheus ballet, resulted in the choral cycle Orpheus Behind the Wire (1983), and the operas We Come to the River (1976, again for Covent Garden) and The English Cat (1983). All were infused by political and social comment.</p> <p>In 1975 Henze became involved as director of the music festival \u2013 <em>cantiere</em>, or workshop \u2013 in the Tuscan town of Montepulciano. This was a local, largely amateur celebration, and the influx of leading, often leftwing, lights of the European contemporary literary and musical scenes, such as Bond, the Italian writer Giuseppe di Leva and the composer Peter Maxwell Davies, caused considerable tensions, involving the composer in politics of a very different stamp. However, the <em>cantieri</em> survived, and Henze enjoyed a second spell as director in the 1990s. Former pupils of his, for example Detlev Glanert, his heir as Germany's foremost living opera composer, also carried on his work there.</p> <p>The premiere in January 1984 of his <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmRpoA74BME\" title=\"YouTube: Henze's Seventh Symphony\">Seventh Symphony</a> at last saw a public reconciliation between Germany and the composer. Commissioned by the Berlin Philharmonic, the work derived its expressive profile from the poems and life of Friedrich H\u00f6lderlin. Henze wrote of it as \"a German symphony, and it deals with matters German\". Such concerns marked much of the music in the final phase of his compositional career, as in his arrangements of Karl Philipp Emmanuel Bach \u2013 I Sentimenti (1982) \u2013 and Karl Amadeus Hartmann (1995), the chamber guitar concerto To an Aeolian Harp (1986, inspired by an Eduard M\u00f6rike poem) and the magisterial Piano Quintet (1991). There was in addition a re-emergence of settings in German \u2013 \"I can do best when I know exactly what the meaning is, without a shadow of doubt\" \u2013 for the most part in collaboration with the poet Hans-Ulrich Treichel.</p> <p>The major fruits of this partnership were the operas Das Verratene Meer (The Ocean Betrayed, 1990, after Yukio Mishima, reworked later as Gogo no Eiko) and Venus and Adonis, plus the choral-and-orchestral Ninth Symphony (1997), Henze's musical summing-up, taking its text from Anna Seghers's harrowing novel of the Nazi era, The Seventh Cross.</p> <p>He became involved in the summer academy run by his home town of G\u00fctersloh and as artistic director from 1988 of the Munich Biennial festival. During the 1990s he undertook a major revision of his catalogue, withdrawing or developing new versions of several older works, and completed an autobiography, <a href=\"http://books.google.co.uk/books/about/Bohemian_Fifths.html?id=5L6gQgAACAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y\" title=\"Google Books: Bohemian FIfths\">Bohemian Fifths</a> (1998).</p> <p>In parallel with his return to Germanic subjects, he deepened his connections with Britain, composing the set of nine \"spiritual concertos\" that made up Requiem (1993), in memory of the London Sinfonietta's director, Michael Vyner, as well as using English texts as the basis of his surrogate cello concerto Liebeslieder (1985) and, from Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream, the Eighth Symphony (1993).</p> <p>The four movements of the Tenth (2000) \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7OtCUidQZg\" title=\"YouTube: The first movement of the Tenth Symphony\">A Storm</a>, A Hymn, A Dance, A Dream \u2013 suggest an undisclosed programme resulting in a fascinating orchestral panoply that is truly symphonic. Henze's harmonic language in his symphonies may not always have pleased the purists but its always clear (if occasionally halting) flow confirms the logical and unified progression.</p> <p>The flow of original music \u2013 as opposed to orchestrations of that by others or a host of revisions of his earlier pieces \u2013 eventually slowed. Nonetheless, the importance to European culture of <a href=\"http://wn.com/hans_werner_henze_opera\" title=\"Selection of Henze opera video clips\">Henze's musical-theatrical canon</a> was underlined by his last three operas: L'Upupa und der Triumph der Sohnesliebe (The Hoopoe and the Triumph of Filial Love, 2003, to his own libretto); Phaedra (2007), echoing Britten's final cantata; and Gisela.</p> <p>Moroni died <a href=\"http://www.signandsight.com/features/1560.html\" title=\"Interview by Volker Hagedorn of Die Zeit\">shortly after the completion of Phaedra</a>.</p> <p><em>\u2022 </em>Hans Werner Henze, composer, born 1 July 1926; died 27 October 2012</p>",
  "<!-- Block 1 --> <p><strong>Preamble</strong> When you've had a chastening experience, there's nothing as comforting as comfort. It could be the zesty ingestion of 47 Big Macs, spunking money you don't have on clothes you don't want or even a home Premier League fixture. Nothing is as likely to make Manchester City feel good about themselves. Since the start of 2011, their Premier League record at the Etihad puts the 'form' in 'formidable': P32 W29 D3 L0.</p> <p>City are still the best team in the Premier League. This is worth reiterating given their status as the crisis club of English football, on a notorious losing streak of one game. They have made a slightly absent-minded start to their title defence, in part because of Roberto Mancini's think problem, but their imminent departure from the Champions League will focus those minds. All should be well with their world by 7.30pm.</p> <p>It's an important game for Swansea too, the start of a very tricky run of fixtures. In the next 10 games they play City, Chelsea, Manchester United, Newcastle, Liverpool, Arsenal and Spurs. There have been some scandalously premature judgements of Michael Laudrup's tenure. By Christmas we should have a much better idea how successful he is likely to be.</p> <!-- Block 2 --> <p><strong>Swansea's last win at Manchester City</strong> came in 1951. That's a deceptive statistic, though; they've only played six games in the 61 years since. No, I'm not really sure what the point of this entry is.</p> <!-- Block 3 --> <p><strong>Shameless plug department</strong> I wrote a chapter on Roy Keane (<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2012/oct/23/roy-keane-book-extract\">there's an extract here</a>) for <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/0956698115\">this book</a>. If everyone in the entire known universe buys a copy, I'll be so rich that I never have to MBM another game, so we all win. What are you waiting for?</p> <!-- Block 4 -->       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/2oXH8F-MGpU?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"283\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/2oXH8F-MGpU\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p> <strong>Michael Laudrup: the definitive player's player</strong> Just <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Laudrup#Quotes_on_Laudrup\"><em>look</em> at these tributes</a>, and then spend 10 minutes savouring what all the fuss was about.</p> <!-- Block 5 --> <p><strong>Team news</strong> Manchester City have recalled Carlos Tevez, Alexsandar Kolarov and Matija Nastasic. They could play a couple of formations with that XI: it might an up-yours 3-5-2 from Roberto Mancini, with Gael Clichy as the left centre-back, but it's more likely to be a 4-2-3-1 with Samir Nasri on the right of midfield. Swansea are unchanged.</p> <p><strong>Manchester City (4-2-3-1)</strong> Hart; Richards, Kompany, Nastasic, Clichy; Y Toure, Barry; Nasri, Tevez, Kolarov; Aguero.<br>Subs: Pantilimon, Lescott, Toure, Evans, Sinclair, Dzeko, Balotelli. </p> <p><strong>Swansea City (4-2-3-1-0)</strong> Vorm; Rangel, Williams, Chico, Davies; Britton, Ki; Hernandez, De Guzman, Routledge; Michu.<br>Subs: Tremmel, Dyer, Graham, Monk, Shechter, Tiendalli, Agustien.</p> <p><strong>Referee:</strong> Martin Atkinson (W Yorkshire)</p> <!-- Block 6 --> <p><strong>5.20pm</strong> \"Right, I've been disappointed by Villa and Norwich, I've been disappointed by my Quorn burgers for lunch, and I've been very disappointed by my 10-month-old son going for a nap rather than watching Star Wars Episode IV with me,\" says Matt Dony. \"This better be a helluva good MBM, Smyth!\" </p> <p>I'll bring my banter A-game.</p> <!-- Block 7 --> <p><strong>Here's a question</strong> If you have big headphones, proper headphones, and a woolly hat, how can you wear the two at the same time? You can't wear the hat on top and if you wear the headphones on top it looks like you're auditioning for the winter season of Nathan Barley. You could just go without the music, of course, but a gentleman needs his Roxette fix on a cold winter's day.</p> <!-- Block 8 --> <p><strong>1 min</strong> City (Manchester) kick off from right to left. They are in blue; Swansea are in white.</p> <!-- Block 9 --> <p><strong>2 min</strong> City (Manchester) are indeed playing a 4-2-3-1 formation.</p> <!-- Block 10 --> <p><strong>3 min</strong> \"Back when I used to spend my money on things like nice headphones, I would have two pairs, proper headphones, and then smaller headphones that would hook behind the ear which I could wear under a winter hat or on an oppressively warm day,\" says Kari Tulinius. \"Big headphones and woolly hats don't play well together.\" This head ain't big enough for the both of 'em, and all that.</p> <!-- Block 11 --> <p><strong>4 min</strong> It's been a pretty quiet start to the game, with more than a whiff of prawn sandwiches about the atmosphere.</p> <!-- Block 12 --> <p><strong>5 min</strong> Britton plays a crisp 10-yard pass straight into touch. Swansea have been good without the ball but poor with it in the first few minutes.</p> <!-- Block 13 --> <p><strong>8 min</strong> Aguero feels Williams at his back and swerves majestically around him. When he's tackled the ball breaks to Tevez in the area, and Chico makes a superb sliding tackle before Tevez can get a shot in.</p> <!-- Block 14 --> <p><strong>10 min</strong> This is all very sluggish thus far. Whatever happened to the fast start? In 2002 Arsenal seemed to be 2-0 up after 10 minutes every second week. Now teams would rather feel their way into the game.</p> <!-- Block 15 --> <p><strong>11 min</strong> \"It is for such occasions that the humble boombox was invented,\" says Ben Stanley. \"This has the additional advantage of allowing you to drown out the tinny grime emanating from some spotty teenager's iPhone speaker with a blast of Physical Graffiti.\"</p> <!-- Block 16 --> <p><strong>13 min</strong> Kompany fouls De Guzman down the left, which gives Swansea their first attacking set piece. It's swung deep by De Guzman and, although Williams was flagged offside, Hart didn't know that when he came for the ball and made a total hash of his attempted punch.</p> <!-- Block 17 --> <p><strong>15 min</strong> \"I know I'm pushing on an open door here Rob, but watching that selection of Laudrupisms just underlines how blessed are those blessed with outrageous balance,\" says Gary Naylor. \"Yet his contemporary, Preben Elkjaer, was a magnificently balanced footballer too \u2013 though in a completely different way. Elkjaer seemed always to be on the edge of falling over, always flat out to try to keep up with the ball and his footballing brain, always baffling us with how he actually did the things he did. Though Laudrup is at the extreme end of 'his' balance spectrum with the likes of Zidane, Beckenbauer and Muller, is Elkjaer on a spectrum all of his own? I can't think of many who played like him with quite that level of ability, like an ultra deluxe Ade Akinbiyi. Someone should write a book about those mid-80s Danes.\"</p> <p>Quite. <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtRdIWyU3Ic#t=9m20s\">This is a great example of his balance</a>. Elkjaer was one of those players, like Jan Ceulemans, who never gave defenders even a second's peace. One Spanish paper described him as \"the human locomotive\", which is lovely.</p> <!-- Block 18 --> <p><strong>16 min</strong> This game is a mess. Both sides have been unusually loose in possession.</p> <!-- Block 19 --> <p><strong>17 min</strong> Gareth Barry, the Englishman, palpably obstructs Angel Rangel, the foreign man, sending him flying as a result. The foreign man is booked for diving.</p> <!-- Block 20 --> <p><strong>20 min</strong> Aside from that Chico tackle on Tevez, Manchester have not even had a sniff of a chance. They aren't being helped by a seriously subdued atmosphere.</p> <!-- Block 21 --> <p><strong>21 min</strong> \"We are still in the bar, Rob,\" hics my colleague Ian McCourt, who was in the bar during the first MBM five hours ago.</p> <!-- Block 22 --> <p><strong>22 min</strong> Hernandez, on the right, swings a superb cross towards Michu, who is about to head for goal when Micah Richards comes round from the side to head away. In doing so he clashes heads with Michu, who drops straight to the ground and may well have been knocked out for a few seconds. He receives treatment before being helped to his feet by Joe Hart, and I think he'll be okay to continue. That was a great piece of defending from Richards, because Michu was only ten yards out and would surely have scored.</p> <!-- Block 23 --> <p><strong>25 min</strong> \"I can't have been the only one to see that Elkjaer clip and thought, '<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KeRlJJbtdHc\">What would Benjamin Massing do</a>?'\" says Richard Dorman.</p> <p>You know you've left a decent football legacy when your surname becomes a verb.</p> <!-- Block 24 --> <p><strong>26 min</strong> City, as Chris Waddle says on ESPN, have been far too slow in possession. I'm not quite sure why. They look like a team who are so used to going behind (and then coming back to win) that they need it to happen again before they wake up. In a daft way the worst thing Swansea could do here is score a goal.</p> <!-- Block 25 --> <p><strong>28 min</strong> This is even worse than Aston Villa v Norwich City.</p> <!-- Block 26 --> <p><strong>29 min</strong> Apart from this game, and the one earlier, what would be your nominations for The Joy of Six: Stinkers.</p> <!-- Block 27 --> <p><strong>30 min</strong> Kolarov and Nasri have switched wings. This is the extent of the excitement just now.</p> <!-- Block 28 --> <p><strong>31 min</strong> Does anyone else remember Leeds 0-0 Blackburn in 1996-97, live on a Monday night? That was the stinker's stinker, and more exciting than this.</p> <!-- Block 29 --> <p><strong>32 min</strong> <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0gb5ZlZTQUw\">If this game was a song</a> ...</p> <!-- Block 30 --> <p><strong>33 min</strong> Gareth Barry overhits a 10-yard through pass to Carlos Tevez by at least five yards. A 50 per cent ineptitude ratio, which is pretty special.</p> <!-- Block 31 --> <p><strong>34 min</strong> \"How many Stoke games are you willing to list in the JOS: Stinkers?\" says Mike. \"Switzerland v Ukraine World Cup 2006 haunts me still.\"</p> <p>I think there's a support group for people who watched the entirety of that game.</p> <!-- Block 32 --> <p><strong>35 min</strong> Clichy bombs into space down the left \u2013 and sidefoots a cross straight out of play. Is this a deliberate parody of an awful football match? If so it's note perfect.</p> <!-- Block 33 --> <p><strong>36 min</strong> Vorm, obviously bored of having bugger all to do, passes the ball straight to Aguero, 25 yards from goal. He moves it forward to Tevez in the area, where Rangel comes round to make an excellent interception.</p> <!-- Block 34 --> <p><strong>37 min</strong> Michu has a goal rightly disallowed for offside. It was a classy finish, though, clipped high beyond the advancing Hart.</p> <!-- Block 35 --> <p><strong>38 min</strong> \"Birmingham v Wolves in the Carling Cup last season,\" says Phil Booth. \"Has to be.\"</p> <!-- Block 36 --> <p><strong>39 min</strong> An actual shot on goal. No word of a lie. Tevez had a little space on the right side of the box and drilled a sharp but straight shot that was comfortably saved by Vorm. Moments later, Swansea had their first half-chance. Richards cleaned out De Guzman on the edge of the area, but Martin Atkinson played a good advantage, allowing Hernandez to swerve into the box and hit a low cross that was hoofed clear from under the bar by Kompany. When the ball went dead, Atkinson booked Richards for his earlier attempt at a tackle.</p> <!-- Block 37 --> <p><strong>41 min</strong> Hart makes a fine save to deny Michu. The chance came when he broke beyond a static defence onto a superb angled through pass from Ki. Michu's first touch was a <em>fraction</em> too heavy, and it allowed Hart to charge from his line. Michu tried to dink it over the top with his second touch but Hart had got to within a couple of yards of him and was able to block the shot. Great goalkeeping.</p> <!-- Block 38 --> <p><strong>43 min</strong> \"The 1994 World Cup final nearly killed off my nascent interest in football when I was 8,\" says Matt Roberts. \"Abysmal match.\"</p> <p>But it had Viola's 14 minutes of fame. And it was Barry Davies's only World Cup final, so it gets a pass.</p> <!-- Block 39 --> <p><strong>45 min</strong> City get a corner, their first I think, on the left wing. It's taken by Aguero, and it doesn't clear the front man's feet, never mind his head. There will be two minutes of added ambience.</p> <!-- Block 40 --> <p><strong>45+1 min</strong> \"The girls behind the bar are giving us free shots,\" says Ian McCourt. How did you swing that? Did you tell them you know Tom Lutz?</p> <!-- Block 41 --> <p><strong>45+2 min</strong> The half in miniature. City win a free kick on the right, maybe 35 yards from goal. All the big men come forward. Tevez hoofs it miles over everyone, and the crossbar.</p> <!-- Block 42 --> <p><strong>Half time: Manchester City 0-0 Swansea City</strong> We must never talk of that half of football again. Ever.</p> <!-- Block 43 --> <p><strong>Obvious half-time thought</strong> David Silva is having a good game.</p> <!-- Block 44 --> <p><strong>Half-time emails</strong></p> <p>\"The worst match I can remember is definitely Ireland v Norway in the 1994 World Cup group stage. It's hard to forget the sight of John Sheridan hoofing it 40 yards upfield every time the ball came to him, followed by John Aldridge thinking about running after it but deciding instead to trot back infield with a shake of his head\" \u2013 James Roscow.</p> <p>\"Virtually all of Alex McLeish's games in the Premier League are tripping over each other in the boredom stakes\" \u2013 Conor Seery.</p> <p>\"Micah Richards was the last man on the tackle he was booked for and should have been sent off. No one has seemed to notice though\" \u2013 Rasmus. (He was last man but I don't think it was a clear goalscoring opportunity.)</p> <p>\"Evening Rob. Pop Quiz. Who is the only man to have scored in a World Cup semi-final and the Dundee derby? That's right, Claudio Caniggia. I once met him in the Overgate shopping centre in Dundee, one of the more surreal experiences of my life\" \u2013 Simon McMahon.</p> <p>\"How tall need a player be to receive praise for his balance? With the likes of Romario, Messi, Aguero etc, I've always taken it for granted. Yet Seedorf's ability to drop his center of gravity from one leg to the other has always amazed me. Surely some kind of <em>mometer</em> is due...\" \u2013 Phil Podolsky.</p> <!-- Block 45 --> <p><strong>46 min</strong> Swansea kick off from right to left. City have replaced Aleksandar Kolarov with Mario Balotelli.</p> <!-- Block 46 --> <p><strong>47 min</strong> City have had a half-time hairdryer \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.metro.co.uk/sport/oddballs/916128-roberto-mancini-has-hairdryer-installed-at-manchester-citys-stadium\">possibly literally </a>\u2013 and have already shown more urgency in the first two minutes of the half than they did in the 47 minutes of the first.</p> <!-- Block 47 --> <p><strong>48 min</strong> \"I'm in California visiting some college buddies,\" says Eric Calhoun. \"I convinced everyone to get up for the 9:30am kick-off and watch the game over breakfast, and now I'm not allowed to make suggestions the rest of the trip.\"</p> <!-- Block 48 --> <p><strong>49 min</strong> I wonder if a team who are unbeaten in the league at the end of October have ever been under such scrutiny as City right now.</p> <!-- Block 49 --> <p><strong>51 min</strong> Balotelli has just missed a very good chance. He was put through on goal by a lovely pass by Nasri and decided to go round Vorm instead of shooting. His touch was too heavy, however, and took him almost to the touchline on the left side of the box. By the time he passed the ball back into the middle, a group of Swansea defenders had got back and one of them was able to clear. In Balotelli's defence, Vorm was out extremely quickly to him.</p> <!-- Block 50 --> <p><strong>53 min</strong> It's all City now. Tevez splits the defence with a stunning pass to find Richards in the box on the right. He eschews the shot and instead drags it across the face of goal towards Balotelli, who just can't reach the ball to put it into the open net. Balotelli claimed he was dragged down by Chico and went head to head with Williams; replays suggest he made the most of very little contact. No way was that a penalty. It was a wonderful pass from Tevez, Laudrupesque in fact. It was pretty much in a straight line, over a distance of about 30 yards, and took four players out of the game.</p> <!-- Block 51 --> <p><strong>56 min</strong> \"In 2006 I was living in the US and didn't have TV,\" says Kari Tulinius. \"However, my landlady let me go to her apartment to watch World Cup games on a Spanish-language channel. I was the only tenant who was allowed that, but then I was the only tenant who had any desire to go into her apartment, on account of her cat. That kitty was just about the most malignant, crazed feline I have ever heard of. It would jump on whomever entered the apartment and just straight-up maul them with claws extended. It would even attack its owner, but she, being ex-military police, was a tough lady and didn't mind. However, for some reason, that cat took a shine to me, which garnered me some privileges in return for taking care of the cat whenever the landlady was away. When I'd go downstairs to watch games, the cat would inevitably curl up next to me on the sofa and purr. Usually it would sleep, no matter how excited I'd get, and wouldn't pay any attention to the screen. However, during the Switzerland \u2013 Ukraine game, as it was becoming increasingly clear that extra time was upon us, the cat woke up, looked at the TV for a minute or so, and then stepped up on me and put its front paws on my chest and started kneading me. As I looked down at it, the cat put one paw on my throat. I could feel its claws on my skin. It looked up at me, as if saying: 'I can end it for you now, if that makes your pain go away.' After a second's consideration of its offer, I shook my head, and the cat took its paw away from my throat and curled up in my lap, where it stayed all the way to the end of the match. That is almost entirely a true story.\"</p> <!-- Block 52 --> <p><strong>57 min</strong> Swansea can't put three passes together. The atmosphere is still pretty subdued but you do feel a City goal is on the way.</p> <!-- Block 53 --> <p><strong>59 min</strong> Michu produces another important save from Hart. Swansea's first decent attack of the second half almost led to a goal. After a long series of short passes, Hernandez broke away on the right and clipped over a cross towards Michu near the penalty spot. He sent a diving header towards goal but it was a bit too close to Hart, who dived smartly to his right to save. Michu will probably feel he should have scored; had it been in the corner, Hart would have had no chance. He didn't get enough of a flick on the header.</p> <!-- Block 54 --> <p><strong>GOAL! Manchester City 1-0 Swansea City (Tevez 61)</strong> This is an excellent goal from Carlos Tevez. Nasri played a square ball to him, 25 yards from goal, slightly to the right of centre. He didn't have much space but had enough time to take a touch and then crunch a fine shot that dipped nastily and arrowed into the far corner. The way Tevez stunned the ball meant it wobbled a bit like a plastic ball, but ultimately it was the accuracy of the shot that was decisive. Vorm had no chance really, although he injured his groin in his attempt to save and is going to be stretchered off.</p> <!-- Block 55 --> <p><strong>65 min</strong> Play still hasn't restarted. Vorm is being helped very carefully onto a stretcher by five or six physios.</p> <!-- Block 56 --> <p><strong>66 min</strong> Vorm is finally replaced by Gerhard Tremmel, and Swansea kick off five minutes after conceding.</p> <!-- Block 57 --> <p><strong>68 min</strong> \"Like in most things, Premier League era ennui is nothing to real football era ennui,\" says Jon Millard. \"Arsenal and Coventry seemed to be both perpetually televised in the 80s, and also, like Spinal Tap's Fire and Ice, perpetually produce lukewarm water. In 86/87 they gave us a shocking 0-0, and that so impressed ITV that they let them reproduce the exact scoreline and level of tedium next year. Being the 80s, you couldn't even watch it in the pub. Great.</p> <!-- Block 58 --> <p><strong>71 min</strong> Michu's header from De Guzman's cross hits the outstretched hand of Kompany. There was a slight penalty appeal from Michu but nothing really. Kompany was only a couple of yards away from Michu, although he did have his arms raised. It would have been a pretty harsh penalty.</p> <!-- Block 59 --> <p><strong>72 min</strong> Swansea replace a midfielder, Leon Britton, with a striker, Danny Graham. Michu will drop back into the hole.</p> <!-- Block 60 --> <p><strong>74 min</strong> City still look unconvincing in defence. Nasri's pathetic clearance goes straight to De Guzman, 25 yards out. He shapes to go to the left of Hart and then sweeps a curler the other way, just past the far post. That was a fine effort.</p> <!-- Block 61 --> <p><strong>75 min</strong> Apparently the Swansea chef, who is not a svelte gentleman, has broken his seat in the dugout. Yes, this is the bit where we link to Vito Spatafore (<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNSpVvqqlJU\">warning: clip has adult language</a>).</p> <!-- Block 62 --> <p><strong>77 min</strong> City have started sleepwalking through the game again, which has allowed Swansea to get back into the game. Pablo Hernandez clearly has his shirt pulled in the area by Nastasic, but it's not seen by the referee Martin Atkinson. That should have been a penalty, <a href=\"http://d.yimg.com/i/ng/sp/empics/20091128/15/2474828724-soccer-barclays-premier-league-portsmouth-v-manchester-united-fratton-park.jpg\">although only Mike Dean tends to give them</a>.</p> <!-- Block 63 --> <p><strong>78 min</strong> Swansea make their final change, with Nathan Dyer replacing Pablo Hernandez.</p> <!-- Block 64 --> <p><strong>80 min</strong> Micah Richards is running towards his own goal when suddenly he collapses to the floor. He's beating the turf in pain, and it seems to be a knee problem. That looks pretty nasty. He had treatment for cramp a few minutes earlier but I don't think it's that. He looked in agony when it happened and now, as a stretcher is prepared, he is receiving oxygen. He may have ruptured something.</p> <!-- Block 65 --> <p><strong>84 min</strong> Richards, still receiving oxygen, is helped slowly onto a stretcher and off the field. What a strange game of football this has been; two players have been stretchered off with apparently serious injuries, both after no contact with any other players.</p> <!-- Block 66 --> <p><strong>85 min</strong> Richards is replaced by Kolo Toure. There will probably be at least 10 minutes of added time in this match.</p> <!-- Block 67 --> <p><strong>86 min</strong> Nathan Dyer is booked for a sliding foul on Gael Clichy. That seemed a little harsh.</p> <!-- Block 68 --> <p><strong>87 min</strong> He broke his seat!</p> <!-- Block 69 --> <p><strong>88 min</strong> \"Did you see Michael Vaughan's jive on Strictly the other week, Rob?\" says Simon McMahon. \"Didn't see that coming back in 2005.\" You wanna talk some jive? I'll talk some jive. <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1zGQrybWi0\">I'll talk some jive like you never heard</a>!</p> <!-- Block 70 --> <p><strong>89 min</strong> An excellent inswinging cross from the right by, er, a Swansea player just evades the leaping Graham before drifting wide of the far post. Manchester City have been really poor in the last 15 minutes and a Swansea goal wouldn't be at all surprising.</p> <!-- Block 71 --> <p><strong>90 min</strong> There will be 12 minutes of Fergie Time. That's about right in view of the injuries and substitutions.</p> <!-- Block 72 --> <p><strong>90+2 min</strong> He broke his seat!</p> <!-- Block 73 --> <p><strong>90+3 min</strong> This has been such a strange game, with an atmosphere so muted as to be almost unsettling. Dyer plays a smart one-two with Rangel and then blitzes a stunningly inept cross well wide of the near post.</p> <!-- Block 74 --> <p><strong>90+4 min</strong> When the ball goes out for a Swansea throw-in, Michael Laudrup scoops the ball up to Ben Davies. <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfDdTgM2CeU\">Which is as good an excuse as any to post this link</a>.</p> <!-- Block 75 --> <p><strong>90+6 min</strong> City make their final substitution, with Joleon Lescott replacing Sergio Aguero. It's not a switch to three in defence; Lescott has gone to centre back, Nastasic left back and Clichy left midfield.</p> <!-- Block 76 --> <p><strong>90+7 min</strong> A loose ball breaks to Ki, 25 yards out, and he blooters a half-volley miles wide.</p> <!-- Block 77 --> <p><strong>90+9 min</strong> Balotelli wins a corner with an excellent run down the right. Nothing comes from it.</p> <!-- Block 78 --> <p><strong>90+10 min</strong> Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz.</p> <!-- Block 79 --> <p><strong>90+11 min</strong> After a dodgy spell either side of the Richards injury, Manchester City have been comfortable enough in added time.

  "<p>The empty bookshelves piled up in the walkways of Nap Ford community school are a reminder of what a high-stakes business education in Florida has become; the surplus furniture is all that remains of a nearby school that closed this summer after being graded an \"F\" two years in a row.</p> <p>Jennifer Porter-Smith, principal of Nap Ford, needs little reminder. Her own school was downgraded to an F two years ago.</p> <p>\"It was devastating,\" she recalled. \"We pulled the team together and said the state is basically saying we are failing children \u2013 what are we going to do about it?\"</p> <p>For over a decade now, schools in Florida have been graded from A to F based on the performance and progress of their pupils in reading, writing, maths and science tests. A-grade or improving schools are rewarded with extra money, while schools receiving the lowest grade twice in a row face closure.</p> <p>It is a part of a package of reforms introduced under former governor Jeb Bush, which have become a model for other states and has been echoed in Barack Obama's education policy.</p> <p>The downgrading had a galvanising effect on Porter-Smith's school.</p> <p>\"We became very strategic and very focussed,\" she said. \"How do we equate what is happening in the classroom with student performance?</p> <p>\"We could have beautiful lesson plans, but are students understanding what is going on?\"</p> <p>Within a year, the school's grade had gone from an F to an A. The school's staff worked equally hard both years, the principal says, but focused more on preparation for testing in the year they were awarded the top grade.</p> <p>Since leaving office, Bush has become an advocate for education reform; setting up a non-proft foundation and touring the country to advise Republican politicians.</p> <p>In his speech to the Republican convention, the former governor emphasised the progress made by black and Hispanic children in Florida, who are now more likely to graduate from high school than their counterparts in other states.</p> <p>The racial dimension of education reform is significant; its proponents often call it the \"civil rights issue of our generation\". The appeal to conservative politicians who need minority voters is obvious.</p> <p>As well as grading schools, the Bush measures included requiring third graders to pass reading tests before they could move up to fourth grade, creating a merit pay system for teachers, and extending parental choice by encouraging the creation of independently run charter schools.</p> <p>At school level, the impact of the reforms has inevitably been messy. A school's grading has become crucial. Nap Ford is a small primary school \u2013 teaching from pre-kindergarten to fifth grade \u2013 in a tough urban setting where 98% of pupils are on free or reduced lunches, an indicator of poverty.</p> <p>\"Because we're such a small school, one child can be five or six percentage points,\" Porter-Smith said. There are 153 children in the school, but only the upper two grades take the tests.</p> <p>There is a high rate of teacher turnover. In one class a new teacher left after a single day. That particular class had six teachers in three months.</p> <p>The principal said: \"A lot of the urban community are disproportionately taught by new teachers, who are going to have a challenge managing the classroom. Children get multiple years of that.\"</p> <p>Being downgraded prompted the school to question what it was doing. But it also made life harder as philanthropic funding dried up.</p> <p>The principal said: \"When you have a year where a school gets an F, fundraising becomes harder, everybody wants to back someone who's doing well.\"</p> <p>That in turn made it impossible to pay for a longer school day, which was one of the measures the school had introduced to support its pupils.</p> <p>A study which looked at the impact of Florida's school grading found that it had a detrimental effect on teacher turnover. The research by economists Li Feng, David Figlio and Tim Sass said that: \"Schools that were 'shocked' downwards \u2013 and thus faced the most pressure to improve \u2013 lost more and higher quality teachers.\"</p> <p>The Florida model is now being imitated by states across the country, inspiring new legislation in Arizona, New Mexico, Utah and Indiana.</p> <p>Obama has praised Bush as a \"champion of education reform\", and the changes in Florida are mirrored in many elements of the president's signature education initiative Race to the Top.</p> <p>The Obama initiative is a competition for federal funds, awarded to states that embrace changes including charter schools and performance pay for teachers.</p> <p>The reforms in Florida have put greater pressure on the school system in two ways; by increasing accountability for schools and teachers, and by giving parents more options than just their local public school.</p> <p>The state has a tax credit scheme that encourages companies to sponsor scholarships at private schools for families of modest means. It has also backed the creation of charter schools. There are now over 500 charters in the state, educating nearly 180,000 students in the last school year.</p> <p>The management of charters can be contracted out, allowing private education firms to make profits from running schools. One such firm, Academica, runs nearly 100 schools in the state.</p> <p>Michael Kooi, director of school choice for Florida, suggests that charters have made a difference by spurring change in the public system.</p> <p>\"Before [charter schools] they had a captive audience and now there's competition, let's face it,\" Kooi said.</p> <p>\"In order to keep kids they've improved for one thing but also provided more options to kids as well.</p> <p>\"That might [mean] just taking more of a math focus at high school, or maybe that you take fine arts classes.\"</p> <p>During the election campaign, Obama has downplayed school choice in favour of speaking about investment in education.</p> <p>Jeb Bush, by contrast, used <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=\" nib0atmm-s8\"\">his convention speech</a> to compare choosing between schools with the freedom to shop around for flavored milk in a supermarket. \"They even make milk for people who cannot drink milk,\" he said. \"Shouldn't parents have that kind of choice in schools that best meets the needs of their students?\"</p> <p>The gap between the two parties is narrower than it seems here. In the past, Obama's administration <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/11/us/politics/11web-educ.html?_r=\" 0\"\">has lauded charter schools</a> as \"laboratories of innovation\".</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/09/10/us-usa-chicago-schools-analysis-idUSBRE8890VS20120910\">confrontation in Chicago</a> has emphasised the consensus between the parties on charters. Though never officially a part of the dispute between Rahm Emanuel and the teachers' union, the mayor is pushing to expand the number of charters in the city.</p> <p>Common to both parties is an anxiety that the US is being outpaced by Asia while politicians and teachers dispute the details of change. Bush noted that China and India are producing \"eight times more engineering students each year\" than the US.</p> <p>Obama, more emolliently as far as his public sector supporters are concerned, declared: \"I don't believe that firing teachers \u2026 will grow the economy or help us compete with the scientists and engineers coming out of Asia.\"</p> <p>Mark Pudlow, spokesman for the Florida Education Association, a teachers' union, said the state's school system has been a Petri dish for reform.</p> <p>\"Since Jeb Bush was elected governor we've been a laboratory for all kinds of corporate influence on public schools, without any input from teachers or credible education researchers,\" Pudlow said.</p> <p>Further change lies ahead. Last year, the current governor of Florida, Rick Scott, brought in new legislation which will overhaul the way teachers are paid. The Student Success Act means at least half of a classroom teacher's evaluation will be based on students' gains in standardised tests. Pay rises will be based on these evaluations, replacing a system in which teachers' evaluation is based entirely on a principal's assessment. But the statewide tests only cover reading, writing, maths and science, meaning that some teachers' evaluation will be based on subjects they have not taught.</p> <p>Pudlow said: \"Let's say you're a history teacher, there's no [standardised test] for history, but the law says you have to be evaluated on testing. If you're a history teacher you have to be evaluated by standardised tests given in subjects you don't teach.\"</p> <p>Even if school districts can evolve new tests to cover these subjects, the union argues that it will be difficult to measure teacher performance in areas such as physical education and music.</p> <p>At the heart of the argument over merit pay is a clash between the natural desire of governments to gather data and map performance, and the view of many teachers that school is a broad experience that resists being captured in test results.</p> <p>Nancy Hunter, who teaches at a high school in Leesburg, Florida, says that her subject is essentially unquantifiable. She teaches \"Freshman Foundations\" \u2013 a class in life skills that teaches children how to be \"good citizens\", Hunter said.</p> <p>\"I'm going to be evaluated on tests they're taking one day in the year and they may be kids I've never set eyes on.</p> <p>\"It's flawed in taking one day of one test rather than what I do day in and day out.\"</p> <p>Whoever wins the presidential election, the outcome is likely to disappoint teachers like Hunter. The mood in the US has shifted away from a belief in trusting professionals to one that emphasises scrutiny of schools through testing and parental choice. There will be more schools that fail to make the grade and end up as a pile of furniture in a corridor.</p>",
  "<p>Burma's president has admitted an unprecedented wave of ethnic violence has targeted his country's Rohingya Muslim population, destroying whole villages and large parts of towns.</p> <p>Thein Sein's acknowledgement follows the release of <a href=\"http://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/related_material/2012_Burma_Satimage.pdf\" title=\"\">satellite images</a> showing the severe scale of the destruction in one coastal town, where most \u2013 if not all \u2013 of the Muslim population appears to have been displaced and their homes destroyed.</p> <p>The pictures, acquired by <a href=\"http://www.hrw.org/news/2012/10/26/burma-new-violence-arakan-state\" title=\"\">Human Rights Watch</a>show destruction to the coastal town of Kyaukpyu in the country's west. They reveal an area of destruction 35 acres in size in which some 811 buildings and boats have been destroyed.</p> <p>The images confirm reports of an orgy of destruction in the town which occurred in a 24-hour period in the middle of last week after violence in the province broke out again on 21 October.</p> <p>The attacks in Arakan province in the country's west \u2013 also known as Rakhine \u2013 appears to have been part of a wave of communal violence pitting Arakan Buddhists against Muslims that has hit five separate towns and displaced thousands of people.</p> <p>\"There have been incidents of whole villages and parts of the towns being burned down in Arakan state,\" Thein Sein's spokesman said.</p> <p>A government spokesman put the death toll up until Friday at 112. But within hours state media revised it to 67 killed from 21-25 October, with 95 wounded and nearly 3,000 houses destroyed.</p> <p>The president's comments followed a warning from the office of the UN secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, that ethnic violence was endangering political progress in Burma.</p> <p>\"The vigilante attacks, targeted threats and extremist rhetoric must be stopped. If this is not done \u2026 the reform and opening-up process being currently pursued by the government is likely to be jeopardised,\" the statement said.</p> <p>The Burmese government is struggling to contain ethnic and religious tensions suppressed during nearly half a century of military rule that ended last year.</p> <p>Inter-ethnic violence broke out earlier this year, triggered by the rape and murder of a Buddhist woman by three Muslim men.</p> <p>Releasing the satellite images, Human Rights Watch said it had identified 633 buildings and 178 houseboats and floating barges which were destroyed in an area occupied predominantly by Rohingya.</p> <p>A committee of MPs led by the Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi called on Friday for security reinforcements and swift legal action against those behind the killings and destruction.</p> <p>According to Reuters, dozens of boats full of Rohingyas with no food or water fled Kyaukpyu, an industrial zone important to China, and other recent hotspots and were seeking access on Friday to overcrowded refugee camps around the state capital, Sittwe.</p> <p>Some 3,000 Rohingya were reported to have been blocked from reaching Sittwe by government forces and landed on a nearby island.</p> <p>\"These latest incidents between Muslim Rohingyas and Buddhists demonstrate how urgent it is that the authorities intervene to protect everyone, and break the cycle of discrimination and violence,\" Amnesty International's Asia-Pacific deputy director, Isabelle Arradon, said.</p> <p>The latest violence erupted as a Burmese website in Norway \u2013 the Democratic Voice of Burma \u2013 reported it had acquired a document by a group calling itself the All-Arakanese Monks' Solidarity Conference. calling for all Rohingya to be expelled from the country.</p> <p>\"Burma's government urgently needs to provide security for the Rohingya in Arakan state, who are under vicious attack,\" said Phil Robertson, deputy Asia director at Human Rights Watch. \"Unless the authorities also start addressing the root causes of the violence, it is only likely to get worse.\"</p> <p>Human Rights Watch fears the death toll is far higher, based on allegations from witnesses fleeing scenes of carnage and the government's well-documented history of underestimating figures that might lead to criticism of the state.</p> <p>The Rohingya are officially stateless. Buddhist-majority Burma's government regards the estimated 800,000 of them in the country as illegal immigrants from Bangladesh, and not as one of the country's 135 official ethnic groups, and denies them citizenship.</p> <p>But many of those expelled from Kyaukpyu are not Rohingya but Muslims from the officially recognised Kaman minority, said Chris Lewa, director of the Rohingya advocacy group, Arakan Project.</p> <p>\"It's not just anti-Rohingya violence anymore, it's anti-Muslim,\" she said.</p> <p>It was unclear what set off the latest arson and killing on Sunday.</p>",

  "<p>Imran Khan, the former Pakistan cricket captain turned politician, was taken off an international flight from Canada to New York and questioned by US immigration officials over his views on drone strikes and jihad.</p> <p>Khan, who has been at the forefront of a high-profile campaign as leader of the Pakistan Movement for Justice party (PTI) to end US drone strikes in northern Pakistan, had been in Canada to give a speech and was on his way to a fundraising dinner in the US on Friday.</p> <p>Khan recently attempted to lead a high-profile march into south Waziristan which included US peace activists from the Code Pink group with some 15,000 of his supporters.</p> <p>He claims that the drone strikes kill large numbers of innocent civilians \u2013 a claim denied by the US.</p> <p>\"I was taken off from plane and interrogated by US Immigration in Canada on my views on drones. My stance is known. Drone attacks must stop,\" Khan tweeted yesterday after his questioning.</p> <p>He added: \"Missed flight and sad to miss the fundraising lunch in NY but nothing will change my stance.\"</p> <p>A US state department spokeswoman confirmed Khan's questioning. \"We are aware that Imran Khan was briefly delayed in Toronto before boarding the next flight to the United States,\" she told Pakistani media.</p> <p>\"The issue was resolved. Mr Khan is welcome in the United States.\"</p> <p>US immigration authorities refused to comment on Khan's case but a spokeswoman quoted by the Toronto Sun newspaper said: \"Our dual mission is to facilitate travel in the United States while we secure our borders, our people, and our visitors from those that would do us harm like terrorists and terrorist weapons, criminals, and contraband,\" said CBP spokesman Joanne Ferreira.</p> <p>\"Under US immigration law, applicants for admission bear the burden of proof to establish that they are clearly eligible to enter the United States. In order to demonstrate that they are admissible, the applicant must overcome all grounds of inadmissibility.\"</p> <p>Some Canadian commentators have speculated that Khan's questioning was because of groups who have been protesting his visit to the US, including a group called the American Islamic Leadership Coalition which reportedly wrote to US secretary of state Hillary Clinton asking her to revoke the US visa granted to Khan.</p> <p>\"The US embassy made a significant error in granting this Islamist leader a visa,\" the group said in a statement.</p> <p>\"Granting individuals like Khan access to the US to fundraise is against the interest of the people of Pakistan and the national security interests of the US.\"</p> <p>Ali Zaidi, an official in Khan's party demanded \"a prompt and thorough inquiry into this sordid episode\" and \"an unconditional apology from the US government\".</p>",
  "<p>There are 11 days left in the presidential election, and the picture is static. Mitt Romney and President Obama remain knotted in the national vote. Obama, however, maintains an edge in the all-important electoral college. The lead is small, but seemingly solid.</p> <p>I have written about <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/oct/16/romney-routes-victory-battleground-states\">three paths for Romney</a> to win this election. These paths all assumed that Romney wins Colorado, Florida, and Virginia.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2012/president/co/colorado_romney_vs_obama-2023.html\">Colorado</a> is a toss-up at this point. The Real Clear average has the race dead even. So, Romney can't really count on that state. <br> <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2012/president/fl/florida_romney_vs_obama-1883.html\">Florida</a> is a state where I feel fairly confident that Romney will win. He holds a near 2-point lead in the Real Clear Politics average. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2012/president/va/virginia_romney_vs_obama-1774.html\">Virginia</a> is a tougher state. The Real Clear average has Romney ahead by about a point, and the conventional wisdom is that Romney is doing well.</p> <p>That leaves us with an electoral vote score of 248 for Romney and 238 for Obama.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398434640\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/26/1351289209512/map1_460.jpg\" alt=\"electoral map 10/26\" width=\"460\" height=\"346\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Even if Romney were to carry Colorado, I'm fairly convinced that he's likely done in <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2012/president/nv/nevada_romney_vs_obama-1908.html\">Nevada</a>. There has only been one Silver State poll this entire year with him in the lead. Nevada <a href=\"http://www.ralstonflash.com/blog/democrats-extend-lead-clark-36000-voters#.UIr9AL9nFE4\">early voting numbers</a> look fantastic for Obama. He leads by 2.5 in the Real Clear average, and in every poll in the average.</p> <p>The fact that Romney can't win in even a single poll in Nevada is a key point. There have been five presidential state contests where all the averages (Pollster.com, Real Clear, etc) were wrong since 2000. That translates to a 97% success rate; the equivalent conversion rate in 2004 and 2008 was 98%. You can say, though, that averages do occasionally get the result wrong.</p> <p>The chance of every single poll getting the result incorrect in a general election is far less likely. In all presidential state contests except one since 2000, there was at least one poll where the eventual winning candidate led even as the average had him behind. That was <a href=\"http://www.duke.edu/~rml5/RA/Aldrich/wh2000gen_state3.htm\">New Mexico in 2000</a> where two of the polls showed a tie and the other one had a small Bush lead. Bush lost that contest by less than 400 votes.</p> <p>Thus, in only one in 150 of the state contests in the last three presidential elections was there an instance of a candidate winning a state where he didn't hold the edge in at least a single poll in the closing weeks of the campaign.</p> <p>This is a major problem that's plaguing Romney in multiple spots.</p> <p>There are a few more examples of a candidate winning out of nowhere in Senate and gubernatorial contests, but these include either third-party candidates (such as the Illinois gubernatorial election in 2010) or large Spanish-speaking populations (such as the Nevada senatorial in 2010). Only the latter factor applies in one of the states Romney needs (Nevada), and effective exclusion of Spanish-speaking voters in polls is likely to benefit Obama, not Romney.</p> <p>If Romney doesn't win in Nevada, then, he must win either <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2012/president/oh/ohio_romney_vs_obama-1860.html\">Ohio</a>, or <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2012/president/wi/wisconsin_romney_vs_obama-1871.html\">Wisconsin</a> and New Hampshire, or Iowa. </p> <p>Obama's advantage in Ohio is only 2.3 points in the Real Clear average. Again, Romney doesn't lead in a single poll in the average. The best he can do is a tie in 11 polls conducted over the last week. Candidates in this position almost never win. </p> <p>Wisconsin is the same exact story. Romney hasn't been ahead in a single poll since August, even though the current average has him down only 2.3 points.</p> <p>Taking these states together and too-close-to-call races in Colorado, <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2012/president/ia/iowa_romney_vs_obama-1922.html\">Iowa</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2012/president/nh/new_hampshire_romney_vs_obama-2030.html\">New Hampshire</a>, my current map, if the election were held today, looks like this:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398434641\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/26/1351289317547/map2_460.jpg\" alt=\"electoral map 2, 10/26\" width=\"460\" height=\"345\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>On that showing, Obama wins with at least 271 electoral votes. </p> <p>That's not to say the map won't look different in a few days. I believe Romney can win in Ohio and/or Wisconsin on election day. He doesn't even need to be ahead in the averages at the end of the campaign. History suggests, however, that he's got to be leading in at least one of the polls in these two contests. That's why I'm waiting for a poll, any poll, not sponsored by a political action group that has Romney with an edge in either the Buckeye or the Badger State. </p> <p>Now, there's always the chance that <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/oct/13/baseball-politics-st-louis-cardinals\">this year is different</a> than every other year; I don't doubt that possibility. That's why you won't hear me say this is a shoo-in for Obama even if his state leads stay steady right until election eve.</p> <p>But it's very difficult to look at the success rate of polling over the last few years and conclude that it's anything but a long shot for Romney \u2013 if the polls hold as they are.</p>",
