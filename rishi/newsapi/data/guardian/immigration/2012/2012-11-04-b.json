  "<p>Is that it? Seriously? A few cups of tea and some scones at a cricket match and that's what you're going to leave us with? This was a giant serving of anti-climax, dolloped out with bouillon spoons.</p> <p>There was no obvious cliff-hanger. Thomas was going and then he wasn't and then he was and then he wasn't. There was the bizarre introduction of a new character who went nowhere (Rose). And we had only a tantalising sniff of Her Ladyship's soap. Too fleeting! Seasoned, jaded viewers who have stuck with this sequinned turkey of a series through burnt kidney souffles, the death throes of eclampsia and tingle-free impotence deserved more, far more, than Molesley and his sticky wicket.</p> <p>There was something of a literary sheen to tonight's series finale, however. Miss O'Brien was referencing Oscar Wilde. The costume department was channelling Brideshead Revisited. And there was a frenzied depiction of something that can only be described as Fifty Shades of Bates.</p> <p>We zoomed in on Bates several times with various soft focus, Vaseline-lens shots. See how he collapses, winded, on to the sofa! See how the drops of paint splash on to his face as he does his manly home-decorating! We had a real, gruff, Mellors line of dialogue: \"You being in the room is enough to make it nice. Come here.\" Bates fans might have needed to be locked in the cold meat cupboard to cool down.</p> <p>I rather loved the decadent scenes in the Blue Dragon, and Rose, the flighty, young, blonde Helena Bonham Carter. But she felt like a refugee from the decommissioned Upstairs Downstairs. What was her presence supposed to signal? Other than, \"You'd better give us at least one more series.\"</p> <p>And as for the gentleman editor (who looks exactly like Edith's previous doomed suitor) with his Mrs Rochester lunatic wife ... Couldn't we at least have waited a bit longer to find that out? Still, excellent use of \"telephone as Wikipedia\" from Edith.</p> <p>The costumes deserve special mention in tonight's episode, especially Cora's embroidered number and the lilac colour palette. But so frequently the painstakingly recreated aesthetic of the series has only served to point up the weaknesses in the plot.</p> <p>Most disappointing thing tonight? A complete absence of Isis. She would have loved the cricket! She was obviously being punished for stealing every scene last week. And the most delicious irony of all? The gentleman editor's explanation of his wife's condition. \"A lunatic is not deemed the innocent or guilty party ...\" And once you're involved, you're simply tied to the madness and unable to escape. Heavens. It's just like being a Downton viewer.</p> <h2>Random subplot alert</h2> <p>Mary and Matthew's failure to secure the succession is becoming tedious. And the mention of the \"little prince\" was toe-curling. \"Now we can start making babies.\" Haven't they said essentially the same thing every episode for the past eight weeks? As has been noted many times in the comments on this blog, they have gone from the hottest couple in Christendom to lacklustre and chummy. Maybe that's aristo marriage for you.</p> <p>How did Mary manage to go off and have an operation without anyone noticing, by the way? And why are we spared the details of the mysterious procedure when we were forced to endure every cramp and whimper of Sybil's womb? Plus, as usual, the whole business was discussed as if we were sitting on Oprah Winfrey's sofa: \"I'm not sure blame is a very useful concept in this area.\" I'm still waiting for Mr Pamuk to have a hand in all this. And my only hope for future series is that he will return to haunt us \u2013 and Mary \u2013 in some way. Come back, Kemal, all is forgiven!</p> <h2>Golden eyebrow award of the week \u2013 and the series</h2> <p>Carson's consideration of Thomas' \"condition\" caused mammoth eyebrow action of the most impressive order. \"I cannot hide that I find your situation revolting. You have been made by nature into something foul.\" I cannot hide that I find it unlikely that in a 1920s household so many people would have 21st century insights into sexuality ... But never mind.</p> <p>And just when you thought the butler's brow couldn't jump any further off his forehead, the Earl of Grantham went ahead and promoted Jimmy to first footman without so much of a by-your-leave. \"What?!\" harrumphed Carson.</p> <p>And so \u2013 please sound the fanfare \u2013 the Golden Eyebrow goes to Carson for a third time, crowning him Golden Eyebrow Series winner. A pair of gold-plated tweezers will be making their way to the offices of the theatrical agent of Jim Carter. Or if I can't find any, I will make some out of cardboard and paint them with gold nail varnish. No expense spared for this accolade.</p> <h2>Surprise character development</h2> <p>Suddenly the whole denouement of the entire series is supposed to depend on the fact that suddenly Alfred grows a backbone? Oh, come on. The whole business with Thomas became too complicated, despite brilliant performances from Rob James-Collier and Siobhan Finneran. One minute Carson's going to make Thomas sorry. Then Jimmy is. Then Alfred is. In the end, everyone ended up being promoted apart from Bates. And we never got to witness Thomas's face in triumph, which would have been a picture.</p> <p>Once again, the Oprah-style understanding of Thomas's \"situation\" seemed completely anachronistic. Although it was worth it for the earl's priceless line: \"If I shouted blue murder every time someone tried to kiss me at Eton, I'd be hoarse within a month.\" Too. Much. Information. Note: Uncle Julian was not educated at Eton but at Ampleforth. So this might have been a bit of a dig.</p> <h2>Sorry, could you just repeat that awkward line of dialogue?</h2> <p><strong>Cousin Violet:</strong> \"The thing is to keep smiling. And never look as if you disapprove.\" That's right, Cousin Violet. You could never look as if you disapprove.</p> <p><strong>Matthew:</strong> \"Married men who wish to seduce young women always have horrid wives.\" So true.</p> <p><strong>Edith:</strong> \"I find the idea of a married man flirting with me wholly repugnant.\" Er, you didn't say that when you were cosying up to the farmhand in series two.</p> <h2>Next week</h2> <p>There is no next week! No more laying out of bouillon spoons. No more waddling of Isis's backside up the front drive. No more chandelier being feather-dusted. Until series four. The announcement of which is, I suspect, imminent. And there's always the Christmas special. Until then, souffle fans! *waves flesh-coloured leather-gloved hand of doom*</p>",

I was in Atlanta, Georgia that day and I remember the line snaking right round the school where the polling station was set up; on and on it went. This year I truly didn't expect to see anything nearly as impressive, what with the mood of the country being so sour and the economy still so sluggish. But I've just seen one of the longest lines I've ever seen at the polling station in downtown Cleveland. It was so long it went round the block and around another block. I walked all the way along it and counted my steps \u2013 400 full paces of voters queuing up dutifully in the cold to cast their ballot. You'd have to be pretty cynical not to find that impressive.</p> <p>The line is 90% African American, I'd say, and every one of the people I spoke to were intending to vote for Barack Obama. This is Souls to the Polls day when black churches encourage their congregation from all over the city to come to the polling station and vote. I've come down here with a black church from the suburbs, God's Tabernacle of Faith. Pastor Thomas Eppinger finished his Sunday service, then piled his congregants into two vans and brought them to the polling station.</p> <p>It takes some determination on a cold day like this to join the very back of the queue. But that is what Barbara Dixon, 39, had just done when I spoke to her just now. She said she was happy to wait \"as long as it takes because I want to make sure this election is won by a president who has values that I care about\". She's got at least two hours to go before she gets to the voting booth, but really she didn't seem at all bothered.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-dd51ea76-1ff1-4d58-8dfd-c591cc8ca906\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/11/4/1352064233397/-460.jpeg\" alt=\"voters queue in Cleveland, Ohio\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">People in Cleveland, Ohio, waited in long queues to cast early votes.

Saturday night was bitterly cold in Bristow, Virginia, but that didn\u2019t stop thousands coming to a rally addressed by the two best orators their party has produced since Robert Kennedy. \u201cIt\u2019s once in a lifetime,\u201d Jennifer Rodriguez, a nurse who\u2019d made the journey from Richmond, told me.</p> <p>Of course Bill Clinton has to play the support act these days, but he does so with huge heart. He bounded on stage in brown leather bomber jacket, wrapped up far less warmly than his audience, and delivered what was largely a reprise of his Charlotte showstopper, when he wowed the Democratic convention with a masterclass in substantive rhetoric, patiently laying out the policy-based reasons why the American people should re-elect their president. His voice was so hoarse, you wondered if it would give out. But the crowd stayed with him, lapping up the unarguable simplicity of lines such as \u201c\u2019We\u2019re all in this together\u2019 is better than \u2018you\u2019re on your own.\u2019\u201d And he can still work a rally like the most seasoned Catskills comic. Of Mitt Romney\u2019s multiple positions on the auto-bailout, Clinton said: \"He\u2019s tied himself up in so many knots, he could be hired as the chief contortionist of Cirque du Soleil.\u201d</p> <p>There were two moments of almost imperceptible tension. One came early, when Clinton confessed himself \u201cmore excited\u201d about supporting Barack Obama \u201ceven than I was four years ago.\u201d It brought a fleeting reminder that in early 2008, Bill Clinton was devoting all his red-faced energy to dismissing the Obama candidacy as a \u201cfairytale.\u201d Later the former president spoke of the ailment known as Romnesia, the habit of forgetting the Republican\u2019s past record. I\u2019m pretty sure I heard him add, as an aside, that \u201cHis opponent may even have got a bit of it.\u201d That sounded like a reference to Obama himself, an apparent dig at the president\u2019s failure, especially in the first debate, to nail Romney\u2019s many contradictions.</p> <p>If that's what it was, few noticed it. Instead, the crowd cheered for Obama when he come on to high-five and hug his predecessor - and cheered louder as he delivered a strong, confident and, at times, stirring performance. He lavished praise on Clinton, saying his team \u201ccalls him the Secretary of Explaining Stuff\u201d. He added that \u201cthe only person working harder than he is is Hillary.\u201d</p> <p>When the speeches were over, the two men worked the ropeline together to the sound of Clinton\u2019s old anthem, Don\u2019t Stop Thinking About Tomorrow. Yesterday the Clintons were Obama\u2019s foes. Today they are two of his most useful friends.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-4904d4d3-5714-4a5d-998e-7e76eee714bb\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/11/4/1352038483183/f647848e-9104-48a6-b46d-7885295c6730-460.jpeg\" alt=\"Bill Clinton and Barack Obama in Virginia\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bill Clinton and Barack Obama at their joint appearance in Bristow, Virginia, on Saturday night.

  "<p>On both sides of the Atlantic there's precious little sign of confidence in leaders' ability to create jobs, whether with another round of fiscal stimulus, or promised waves of business start-ups. in Britain, the sectors that created most jobs in recent years are now shedding them fast \u2013 from disappearing high-street chains such as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/nov/04/surviving-retailers-stagger-high-street-day-dead\" title=\"\">Clinton Cards, Blacks and JJB Sports</a>, to a shrinking public sector and a voluntary sector where an estimated 10% of jobs are going each year. Even the most optimistic forecasts on manufacturing recognise there's unlikely to be much net jobs growth \u2013 except for robots.</p> <p>Yet economies do create jobs, and most past forecasts of jobless growth were wrong. So where will the jobs come from? Economies are complex beasts that need people to do an extraordinary range of tasks. But it is possible to spot the patterns; what's strange is how little the UK is doing to make the most of the opportunities.</p> <p>The first big area of likely jobs growth is care, and health more generally. Care is now one of the least rewarded and lowest-status sectors of all, with most workers on zero-hour contracts (which offer no guaranteed hours, but require people to be available at short notice). But the effect of an ageing society will be a jobs boom. As people get richer, they spend a disproportionate share of their income on care and health (and education). It's no coincidence that half of the jobs created in recent decades in the US have been in healthcare, and most forecasters there expect the trends to accelerate. Yet Britain is hopelessly unprepared for this.</p> <p>There are hardly any apprenticeships in care; hardly any schools preparing teenagers for jobs in care; and few signs that politicians know what to do to raise the status and rewards for what will soon be one of our most important industries.</p> <p>The second area of likely jobs growth is computers. In <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/36264/graduate\" title=\"\">The Graduate</a>, Dustin Hoffman has an awkward conversation with a middle-aged man who tells him his future lies in plastics. Today he'd be advised to go into data. It's estimated that half a million jobs have been created in the US just producing apps. We at <a href=\"http://www.nesta.org.uk/about_us\" title=\"\">Nesta</a> predict a steady growth in jobs across the economy in manipulating and managing data \u2013 indeed, this will become ever more important for every business. Here too, the UK is unprepared. Standards of maths haven't improved much in schools, and there are still too few opportunities for bright teenagers to learn how to programme and play with big data sets.</p> <p>The third opportunity is globalisation, often seen as a scourge of jobs, which may now be working in our favour. <a href=\"http://www.nesta.org.uk/news_and_features/news/assets/features/nesta_research_challenges_the_myth_that_foreign_investment_is_hollowing_out_the_uks_economy\" title=\"\">Foreign-owned businesses raised their share of UK jobs</a> from 11% in 1997 to 19% in 2010 \u2013 that's 1.6m more jobs. As capital flows in from firms such as Tata, this trend is likely to continue. Generally it will be good for us, because these businesses also invest more in innovation and do more to drive up the quality of supply chains than British ones.</p> <p>That's a strong argument for remaining open to the world. Yet the recent moves to cut off inward migration signal an economic nationalism that is working against our interests on jobs \u2013 whether it's putting off oil specialists in Aberdeen, internet entrepreneurs in Manchester, or Chinese students wanting to stay on in London. Immigration isn't always good for the economy or jobs. But there's been an overcorrection that will probably be bad for today's teenagers.</p> <p>In the big scheme of things, forecasts of the end of the job are as suspect today as they were 30 years ago. The jobs market has done a lot better than many expected at the start of the downturn. But why do we find it so hard to be strategic? Why does political rhetoric so often talk about jobs in the abstract, rather than about specific sectors and opportunities? And why can't we do more to make our own luck rather than just hoping things will turn out OK? The US election hasn't answered any of these questions. In the run up to our next one, let's hope that we do better.<br></p>",
  "<p>It is not hard to spot the most enticing fixture in the second round of the FA Cup \u2013 assuming both MK Dons and AFC Wimbledon win their first-round replays against Cambridge City and York City respectively. It would be the first time the two clubs have met since MK Dons were controversially created in 2004, nine months after Wimbledon's relocation to Milton Keynes.</p> <p>Wimbledon fans, who watched their club fall into administration, strongly opposed the move and the subsequent renaming of the side and instead founded a new club, AFC Wimbledon. The two sides have nearly met in the second round before, only for MK Dons to lose a first-round replay against Stevenage.</p> <p>However, while the tie would be billed as a grudge match in some quarters, Wimbledon fans would not necessarily welcome it, given their fury at the way their club was destroyed by the move to Buckinghamshire.</p> <p><strong>Chelmsford</strong>, who play in the Blue Square Bet South, have been rewarded for their victory over Colchester United with a trip to <strong>Crawley Town</strong>. Crawley, who beat the Metropolitan police 2-1 on Saturday, are third in League One and will fancy their chances of reaching the third round having made it as far as the fifth round last season.</p> <p>Paolo Di Canio said he wanted to fine his Swindon Town players after their shock 2-0 defeat at home to non-league <strong>Macclesfield Town</strong> and the Italian's mood will hardly have been improved by Steve King's side being handed a relatively comfortable draw against either Guiseley or Barrow. Equally <strong>Harrogate Town</strong>, who upset League Two's Torquay United, will be pleased with a home draw against <strong>Hastings United</strong>, who play in the Isthmian Premier Division.</p> <p><strong>Hereford United</strong>, who entered FA Cup folklore when Ronnie Radford's stunning goal beat Newcastle United in 1972, pulled off another upset on Saturday, beating League One's Shrewsbury Town. However, the Blue Square Bet Premier side face a daunting trip to <strong>Cheltenham Town</strong>, who are third in League Two. They were 3-0 winners at home against Yate.</p> <p>Micky Adams, who was <strong>Sheffield United</strong>'s manager when they were relegated from the Championship in 2011, will face his old club to Bramall Lane. The Blades, who were beaten on penalties by Huddersfield Town in the League One play-off final last season, won 2-1 at Bristol Rovers, while Adams' <strong>Port Vale </strong>won 3-2 at Forest Green.</p> <p>Adams joined Vale after leaving United following their relegation to the third tier of English football. His Port Vale side are currently second in League Two, five points behind Gillingham, but Adams will probably expect a frosty reception from fans of his old club.</p> <p>Slough Town are the lowest side left in the competition but will have to beat Mansfield in a replay at home to set up a tie against either Lincoln City or Walsall, who drew 1-1 at The 12th Imp Sincil Bank Stadium.</p> <p><strong>Dorchester Town</strong>, who play in the Blue Square Bet South, produced another upset when they beat League Two's Plymouth Argyle on Sunday. Jake Gosling, who was released by Plymouth when he was 16, settled the tie for the home side. It was a miserable afternoon for Plymouth, who were reduced to 10 men inside the first 10 minutes following Conor Hourihane's red card. Dorchester will play either Luton Town or Nuneaton Borough next.</p> <p>Gloucester City and Leyton Orient's match as well as Braintree's encounter with the League One leaders Tranmere were both postponed. Alfreton and Chesterfield await the respective winners of those ties.</p>",

Andrew Luck, was superb - completing 30 of 48 for 433 yards and two touchdowns, as well as showing a startling composure in the clutch. Ryan Tannehill was not too shabby either, going 22 of 38 for 290 yards and one score, but this time it was not enough.

Once again it was a penalty which might have dealt the critical blow for Miami - a false start from Pouncey turning third-and-10 into third-and-15.With one time-out left, they can technically still get the ball back here, but they wouldn't have a lot of time left.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5096da0295cb1506d2444892\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-11-04T21:11:30.726Z\">9.11pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Two minute warning: Dolphins 20 Colts 23</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Miami didn't take long getting back up to halfway, Tannehill hitting Fasano, Hartline and Gaffney to take his team to the 50-yard line before the TV time out.

The former Indianapolis Colts head coach's incredulous response to a question about his then 4-6 team's playoff prospects in 2001 would become a viral sensation - spawning a million different parodies, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwq7BYOnDrM\">generating millions of YouTube hits</a> and <a href=\"http://jimmoraplayoffs.com/\">even getting its very own website</a>. Unfairly, but inevitably, <a href=\"http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/7302157/jim-mora-reflects-playoffs-moment\">many fans remember him for that one outburst above any of his career achievements</a>.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwq7BYOnDrM\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Qwq7BYOnDrM?wmode=opaque&fs=1&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>Mora was right to be sceptical, of course. \"Playoffs?! I just hope we can win another game,\" he exclaimed, and in the event they would win just another two. At the end of the season, he would be fired.</p> <p>The Colts would not miss the playoffs again for a decade - riding Peyton Manning to nine consecutive posteason berths. That was until last year, when the quarterback's neck surgery caused him to miss the entire year. When he was traded away to Denver in the offseason to make room for the rookie pick Andrew Luck, the assumption for many fans was that it would be at least another year before they returned.</p> <p>Luck might have been the No1 overall pick, but this team had won just two games without Manning the year before. And rare are the rookie signal callers who have been able to step in and win games immediately in the NFL. Even Manning had gone 3-13 in his first year in the league.</p> <p>But if the odds seemed stacked against Luck then they were even higher against Miami's Ryan Tannehill. Drafted eighth overall by the Dolphins, he was the third quarterback chosen behind Luck and Robert Griffin III. Although the team he joined had won six games the year before, they had also traded away their most talented offensive playmaker - Brandon Marshall - in the offseason.</p> <p>And yet, after eight weeks of the NFL season, both of these rookies have succeede in positioning their teams as legitimate playoff contenders - each with a 4-3 record. Were the postseason to start tomorrow, each would be in as a wildcard team. Whether they can maintain such form remains to be seen, but in a clustered AFC, the winner today will certainly be well positioned. Even the loser need not share Mora's doubt.</p> </div>   </div>",

He called for \"self-deportation\" \u2013 a euphemism to make life so miserable for the undocumented they leave the United States \u2013 and appointed <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/david-leopold/mitt-romneys-kris-kobach-_b_1903051.html?utm_hp_ref=\" immigration-reform\"\">Kris Kobach</a>, the architect of Arizona's draconian immigration law, as an adviser.</p> <p>Romney recognised the damage. Back in April reporters overheard him at a private fundraiser in Florida warning that Obama's lead among Latinos \"<a href=\"http://colorlines.com/archives/2012/04/mitt_romney_not_winning_latino_vote_spells_doom_for_us.html\">spells doom for us</a>\".</p> <p>Republican strategists concluded Romney did not need to match George W Bush's 44% Latino support in 2004 but that he needed to do significantly better than John McCain's 31% in 2008.</p> <p>Romney dispatched his son Craig, a former missionary in Chile who speaks fluent Spanish, to tour swing states. And in September the candidate appeared on Univision, the Spanish-language TV behemoth, to be grilled by Mar\u00eda Elena Salinas and Jorge Ramos, the Walter Cronkite of Latino media.</p> <p>Republican organisers packed the audience with whooping supporters and Romney acquitted himself reasonably well but commentary focused on his unusually deep, orange-tinted tan which <a href=\"http://univisionnews.tumblr.com/post/32196711271/its-not-an-oompa-loompa-its-mitt-romney\">triggered mocking accusations</a> of cosmetic pandering to Latinos.</p> <p>\"Too bad the oompa loompa population dwindled 25 years ago,\" said one tweet.</p> <p>Romney aides said he had been campaigning in Florida sunshine before the show.</p> <p>With Latino numbers not improving the GOP and Super Pac backers like Crossroads GPS spent about $4.6m on Spanish-language television stations in Colorado, Florida and Nevada, according to Kantar media.</p> <p>The ads were mostly translated versions of Romney's English-language ads, tweaked to include references to his father's Mexican heritage and the \"Soy Mitt Romney\" sign-off at the end.</p> <p>He hammered the theme he would be a better economic steward. \"Our economic recovery needs the success of the Hispanic community, but President Obama's misguided policies are dragging down businesses.\"</p> <p>Another ad showed euphoria for Obama in 2008, followed by Latino voters detailing broken promises. Another ad lamented Latino poverty and unemployment. \"When Obama and his Democratic allies tell us 'Yes we can,' we have to tell them, 'We can't take anymore,'\" says the narrator.</p> <p>The Obama campaign, however, spent twice almost as much, $8.9m, and the president, who like Romney does not speak Spanish, mastered phonetics for a 30-second spot of passable Spanish.</p> <p>\"In the young people known as the Dreamers I see the same qualities that Michelle and I try to instil in our daughters,\" he intones, referring to young undocumented immigrants seeking citizenship. Images show the Obama family, followed by studious Latinos. \"As a father, they inspire me. And as president, their bravery has reminded me that no obstacle is too large, and no road is too long.\"</p> <p>Another spot features Cristina Saralegui, a television presenter dubbed the Latina Oprah, endorsing Obama in colloquial, rhyming Spanish. \"Pa'tras? De eso nada! Pa'lante \u2013 con Obama!\" Going backward? None of that. Forward \u2013 with Obama!</p> <p>The president scored additional points in May by phoning in to the popular Denver-based KBNO radio show, La Voz del Pueblo, to josh with the host Fernando Sergio about, among other things, the Broncos. Romney declined invitations to do likewise. Last week <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jason-salzman/fernando-sergio-obama-endorsement_b_2006681.html\">Sergio endorsed Obama</a>.</p> <p>The president also appeared on the same Univision forum as Romney (on a separate day) for the requested hour, unlike his rival who gave only 30 minutes. Pressed by the hosts over the lack of immigration reform, Obama said it was his term's biggest failure, a devastating admission were it not for Romney's vulnerability on the issue.</p> <p>\"Some of Obama's ads go too far, they hint that the <a href=\"http://www.dhs.gov/deferred-action\">deferred action process</a>is a path to citizenship when it's not, but Romney has no credibility with Latinos. We can tell when we're being attacked,\" said Jessie Ramirez, 31, a high school career guidance counsellor at a Democratic rally in Denver.</p> <p>A <a href=\"http://latino.foxnews.com/latino/politics/2012/11/01/obama-has-almost-identical-lead-with-latinos-as-2008-poll-says/\">Fox News poll </a>on Friday showed Obama leading Romney among Latinos by 66% to 28% \u2013 a whopping margin keeping him competitive in Florida, Ohio, Nevada and New Mexico.</p> <p>Seguro, the analyst and pollster, said the Republican strategy, based on attack ads, now seemed to be discouraging Latinos from voting. \"My sense is they've given up on trying to persuade and are trying to suppress by making people think, a pox on both your houses.\"</p>",
  "<p>HSBC will set aside an extra \u00a3500m to cover fines for alleged money laundering by its US arm when the bank releases its third-quarter results on Monday.</p> <p>The provision is more than double the \u00a3445m allocated by the bank in July to cover punishments by US regulators.</p> <p>The development will prove hugely embarrassing for the chief executive, Stuart Gulliver, who has tried to distance HSBC from scandal-hit rivals since taking the top post last year.</p> <p>The bank, the UK's most valuable, is known for its financial strength. It burnished a reputation as one of the more conservative financial institutions in the runup to the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008.</p> <p>But its US operations, primarily the lender Household, were caught cold by the sub-prime mortgage crash and plunged the UK listed firm into years of write-offs and regulatory probes.</p> <p>The revised estimate of the bill for fines and charges by US regulators will underline the growing seriousness of investigations into the activities of UK bank subsidiaries.</p> <p>Standard Chartered has also come under scrutiny for allowing terrorists and criminals access to its banking facilities, while Barclays admitted playing a part in the Libor rigging scandal. Royal Bank of Scotland is expected to be fined for its part in the Libor scandal. Barclays faces another potential fine, following claims it rigged the price of electricity in the US.</p> <p>Gulliver has already apologised for \"shameful\" system breakdowns, which failed to stop the bank from laundering money for terrorists and drug barons through operations in Mexico.</p> <p>In the summer the bank set aside $700m (\u00a3445m) for potential fines in the US and another \u00a3900m for mis-selling financial products in the UK.</p> <p>Gulliver conceded that the eventual fine from the US authorities could be \"higher, possibly significantly higher\", after a Senate report found that its US arm had allowed it to launder money for terrorists and drug barons because of its \"pervasively polluted\" culture.</p> <p>At the time he refused to say how much more money would have to be set aside. Many shareholders, however, were braced for regulators insisting on a much larger sum, given the strength of feeling in the US against lax controls at UK banks.</p> <p>Gulliver, who took the helm last year after 30 years at the bank, lastly as head of the investment banking division, said at half-year results that the bank was reforming its \"federation structure\" to try to avoid a re-run of the problems in the US.</p> <p>\"I very much regret HSBC's past failures and very much apologise for them,\" he said. \"What happened in Mexico and the US is shameful, it's embarrassing, it's very painful for all of us in the firm.\"</p> <p>Executives responsible for the Mexican business have since left the bank. It is understood staff at the London HQ, on the Isle of Dogs, London, are preparing to claw back millions of pounds in bonuses paid to senior officials, who allowed billions of illegal dollars to be funnelled through the financial system.</p> <p>The bank, which is expected to announce quarterly profits of \u00a35bn, has confidently informed shareholders that it is no longer run as an operation with a presence in 80 countries \"where the country head is king\" but as an integrated business with four global heads to centralise standards and controls through a beefed-up compliance operation.</p> <p>Insiders say it will take Gulliver longer to reform structures that have dominated the bank for decades and provided a power base for many valued senior executives.</p> <p>The bank is also caught up in the Libor rigging scandal, along with several US and Swiss banks. They are accused of artificially inflating interest rates ahead of the crash to increase profits, and massaging them down in the wake of the crisis. This made it appear that their reputation was unharmed and they could access cheap funds in the market.</p> <p>However, Gulliver, whose bonuses are tied to the bank's reputation, did not make provision for any fine or legal cases. Barclays has been fined \u00a3290m for Libor manipulation.</p> <p>Since the summer HSBC has hired Preeta Bansal as its global general counsel for litigation and regulatory affairs, adding a third Obama administration official to support damage limitation efforts.</p> <p>Bansal will help manage litigation and regulatory risk, and report to the chief legal officer, Stuart Levey, the former sanctions official in the Bush and Obama Treasury offices, who was appointed in January. In August, the bank hired Robert Werner, a former head of the Treasury department's trade and economic enforcement arm, as head of global standards assurance.</p>",
  "<p>Europe has become the place where nothing quite happens. David Cameron goes to Brussels demanding a freeze in the EU budget, while the European commission and parliament want a hefty 5-6% increase. It should be a storming confrontation, vetos threatened, walkouts happening. But we all know that, somehow, life will go on. It always does.</p> <p>Yet Europe is also the issue in British politics that is changing more than any other. Icy hostility is hardening. Those who want to leave are growing ever more numerous and implacable. Never has the pro-European voice been weaker and less certain.</p> <p>It isn't simply the opportunism of the parliamentary Labour party trooping through the lobbies after MPs <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/nov/04/andrew-rawnsley-tory-eu-rebellion-cynical\" title=\"\">Reckless</a> and <a href=\"http://www.europeanfoundation.org/\" title=\"\">Cash</a>. It isn't just the radical shift among Tory MPs, with pro-Europeans cowed and isolated. (I'm not even sure the phrase \"Tory pro-Europeans\" is still plural; is it only Ken Clarke now?)</p> <p>It's the shift among voters. According to polling in Cameron's own Witney constituency, 68% of Tory supporters there want a referendum on Europe and 29% would consider switching parties to get one. There's no secret about where they would go. National opinion polls show a steady rise in the Ukip vote; the most recent, for the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/nov/03/labour-tories-observer-opinion-poll?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">Observer, puts Ukip third</a> nationally, ahead of the Liberal Democrats. Cameron is promising a major speech on Europe soon. But what can he say?</p> <p>This momentous shift is partly the result of the slow-motion car crash inside the eurozone, itself caused by the glaring differences between northern and southern economies. As Iain Duncan Smith admitted on Sunday, British politicians are <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/bsp/hi/pdfs/4111202.pdf\" title=\"\">waiting to see how the eurozone deals with its deep problems</a> before deciding how to react themselves \u2013 nervous bystanders by the crash site, watching the emergency services argue.</p> <p>So it may seem unfair to say that the second reason for the strong anti-EU tide flowing through the UK is an absence of pro-European leadership in Britain. Until people know what it is we're going to be part of, how can they make the case?</p> <p>Yet I would argue that this failure of leadership is fundamental and affects both the major parties. Cameron and his senior team are frankly scared stiff of the rising Euro-rejectionist tendency, too frightened to confront them. For Labour, sitting back and watching Tory turmoil has been too enjoyable to resist. It may even be an effective electoral strategy. Depending on how the numbers fall, it is not impossible that Ukip may deliver a Labour majority in 2015. The trouble is that all this opportunistic, tactical game-playing allows the argument for a complete break to grow, perhaps to the point where it becomes irresistible.</p> <p>A Labour party that has declined to pick a fight on the European issue with its natural enemies may find that the game has changed. Almost nobody is speaking up. The Gordon Brown camp's legendary hostility to the euro is morphing into general appeasement of the anti-EU mood. What <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/nov/02/labour-expels-denis-macshane-expenses\" title=\"\">Denis MacShane</a> did in his expenses fiddling was unforgivable, but his departure from politics removes one of the few outspoken Europhile voices in national politics. Certainly no other Labour MP comprehends the European project so well.</p> <p>I can understand Cameron's lack of leadership. Ideologically, Tory free-marketeers have a deep problem with a single economic union. There isn't a great deal of space left for him to occupy between Brussels federalism and Tory Atlanticist anti-Europeanism. If you really think the City of London is Britain's last economic card then, yes, you'd be scared stiff of new EU-wide banking rules.</p> <p>Labour's lack of leadership is odder. Yes, there are populist tricks to be won on immigration and even on the EU budget. But if you look at Labour's developing domestic vision for Britain, what do you see? A major drive on technical training, regional industrial policy, the living wage and a rebalancing of the economy away from financial services and towards engineering, combined with business banks structured to invest for the long term.</p> <p>And what does that sound like? Germany. If Labour's vision of a better-grounded, fairer and more sustainable economy isn't quite a copy of modern Germany, it is at least remarkably close to the social democratic capitalism that has evolved under parties of different stripes across much of northern Europe. Ed Miliband's one-time guru Maurice Glasman could tell him as much.</p> <p>The German dilemma just now is about the depth of sacrifice Germans, and northern Europeans generally, should make to save southern economies that they regard as unreformed (and which they fear are unreformable). That is a domestic crisis for the eurozone, which isn't much helped by off-stage heckles from outsiders.</p> <p>But as Labour tries to define its new identity, after the neoliberalism and bust financial capitalism of the Blair years, many European economies still provide the best examples of what to aim for. When Labour argues for real, knowledgeable, locally based banking and training, supporting high-end companies, plus a fair tax system designed for citizens, not global parasites, it's arguing for a European future.</p> <p>It's obvious. Voters aren't stupid and they would get it. But it's something that needs to argued for. Soon it may be too late. Europe often seems a policy area where nothing happens; it's quite possible that Britain will vote for a neoliberal exit. And Labour should remember this: you cannot win an argument you haven't made.</p>",

  "<p>Drama depends on moral dilemmas and for that we need maximum information. I welcome the fact that this first full-length play by Shamser Sinha deals with the perils facing young asylum seekers, but I also want to know more about the legal technicalities: it's a lively, vivid piece of writing but it assumes more knowledge than most of us possess.</p> <p>The basic situation is clear. Khadija is a young Afghan refugee sharing social services accommodation in Hackney, east London, with Liza, who hails from eastern Europe. Both girls are 17 when the play&nbsp;starts, both attend college and both are worried about achieving residential status. But each has problems. Liza frets about her poor English and fears that the authorities will discover that the baby she is nursing is not her own. Khadija, meanwhile, is financially reckless and heavily involved with a young black guy, Ade, by whom she gets pregnant at the very time when her temporary visa is due to expire.</p> <p>There is a lot to like about the play. Sinha has spent 10 years working with asylum seekers and clearly writes from experience. The laddish, competitive backchat between Ade and his bullish African-Caribbean mate, Sam, rings true, especially the latter's resentment of new waves of Arab immigrants. Khadija's relationship with Liza, with its&nbsp;mixture of mutual dependence and sexual jealousy, also cannot be faulted. Like Rachel De-lahay's <a href=\"http://www.royalcourttheatre.com/whats-on/the-westbridge\" title=\"\">The Westbridge at the Royal Court</a>, London, the play&nbsp;tells us what life is like today in&nbsp;multicultural Britain. To fully understand Khadija's problem, however,&nbsp;we need to know more about the demands placed on young asylum seekers. Without that, it's difficult to decide whether Khadija is the victim of&nbsp;a punitive legal system, or of Ade's failure to take contraceptive precautions.</p> <p>Fly Davis's design could also do more to indicate where each scene is set, but Tim Stark's production has real energy and is very well acted by its young cast. Aysha Kala is chippy and vulnerable as Khadija, and her scenes with Victor Alli's Ade have a nice air of&nbsp;resentful affection. There is equally good work from Katherine Rose Morley as the sexually lonely Liza, and Damson Idris as the seemingly confident Sam. Sinha packs a&nbsp;lot into 90 minutes, but still leaves me&nbsp;wondering how much statutory aid asylum seekers receive from solicitors, and what they have to do to prove their entitlement to stay. We can find all that out from Google, but a play also has a duty to give us the necessary&nbsp;facts.</p> <p><em>What have you been to see lately?

  "<p><strong> </strong></p> <p>The Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, is facing widespread condemnation and anger in the Palestinian territories and abroad after he publicly waived his right to return to live in the town from which his family was forced to flee in 1948, a repudiation of huge significance for Palestinian refugees.</p> <p>After his image was burned in refugee camps in Gaza, Abbas rejected accusations that he had conceded one of the most emotional and visceral issues on the Palestinian agenda, the demand by millions of refugees to return to their former homes in what is now Israel.</p> <p>He insisted that comments made in an interview with an Israeli television channel were selectively quoted and the remarks were his personal stance, rather than a change of policy.</p> <p>Abbas told Channel 2 he accepted he had no right to live in Safed, the town of his birth, from which his family was forced to flee in 1948 when Abbas was 13.</p> <p>\"I visited Safed before once, he said. \"But I want to see Safed. It's my right to see it, but not to live there.\"</p> <p>Referring to the internationally-recognised pre-1967 border, he went on: \"Palestine now for me is '67 borders, with East Jerusalem as its capital. This is now and forever ... This is Palestine for me. I am a refugee, but I am living in Ramallah. I believe that the West Bank and Gaza is Palestine and the other parts are Israel.\"</p> <p>The comments sparked protests in Gaza, where people in refugee camps burned images of the Palestinian president. Abbas was denounced on Twitter by pro-Palestinian activists.</p> <p>Ismail Haniyeh, the Hamas ruler in Gaza, said the issue was not about Abbas's right to return to Safed but \"the rights of 6 million Palestinians\".</p> <p>He said in a statement: \"No one has the right, whoever he is \u2013 a common man or president, organisation, a government or authority \u2013 to give up an inch of Palestinian land.\"</p> <p>Sami Abu Zuhri, a Hamas spokesman, said the president's statement did \"not represent in any way the views of the Palestinian people\".</p> <p>The \"right of return\" is one of the most intractable issues in talks between the Israelis and Palestinians for a resolution to their decades-old conflict. The Palestinians have historically demanded that all those who fled or were expelled from their homes in the period around the formation of the state of Israel in 1948, and their descendants, must be allowed to return to their former homes.</p> <p>About 5 million Palestinians are registered as refugees in the Palestinian territories and abroad.</p> <p>Israel rejects their demand, saying that such a move would spell the end of the Jewish state.</p> <p>Most international diplomats and observers believe that a settlement to the conflict is likely to involve a symbolic number of Palestinian refugees being given the right to return.</p> <p>Following the broadcast of the interview, Israel's president, Shimon Peres, said Abbas's comments were a \"brave and important public declaration\". In a statement, he said Abbas had shown he was \"a real partner for peace\" and that he understood \"the solution to the Palestinian refugee issue cannot be in Israel's territory and to the detriment of Israel's character\".</p> <p>Israel's defence, minister Ehud Barak, described Abbas's remarks as courageous and clear.</p> <p>But Israel's prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu. dismissed the comments, saying that the Palestinian president had different messages for different audiences. \"There is no connection between [his] statements and his actual actions,\" he said, calling for Abbas to return to negotiations.</p> <p>Palestinian sources played down the row, saying Abbas's comments had been misconstrued. One suggested the president had been ill-prepared for the interview and it had been a mistake to agree to conduct it in English, a language in which Abbas is not fluent.</p> <p>Ghassan Khatib, an academic at Bir Zeit university in the West Bank and a former Palestinian Authority spokesman, said Abbas had not suggested a change in the official position. \"This is an optional right. If an individual refugee does not wish to return, he will be free not to return. We all know that all Palestinians are not going to return. Some understand this, some do not.\"</p> <p>In the interview, Abbas also said that, while he was president, there would be \"no third armed intifada [uprising against Israel]. Never.\"</p> <p>He said: \"We don't want to use terror. We don't want to use force. We don't want to use weapons. We want to use diplomacy. We want to use politics. We want to use negotiations. We want to use peaceful resistance. That's it.\" He has said that Palestinian negotiators are willing to resume talks with Israel following the submission of a request, expected later this month, to the UN general assembly for recognition as a \"non-member state\".</p> <p>Israel and the US are vehemently opposed to the move, which is expected to be passed by a majority of the UN's 193 member states.</p>",
  "<p>Veronica Romero was belting it out for Mitt Romney. Her band, Punto y Coma, flipped between Cuban and Puerto Rican numbers for a crowd of Republican supporters in Kissimmee, a central Florida town next to Disneyworld where a surge in Hispanic residents since the last presidential election is shaking up old assumptions about the Latino vote in an important swing state.</p> <p>The Cuban songs played to a community that has for decades defined Latino politics in Florida as solidly pro-Republican. The Puerto Rican music was an acknowledgement that hegemony is increasingly under challenge from Latino migrants whose votes are up for grabs.</p> <p>Romero is Puerto Rican and for Romney. But when she talks about the election she sounds much like a Barack Obama supporter four years ago.</p> <p>\"We are tired of the same old. We are looking forward,\" she said. \"We were looking for a change and we didn't get it. Especially the economy. We need more job opportunities. We are looking to work.\"</p> <p>Opinion polls show Obama commanding a sizeable lead among Latino voters across the US who support him about two to one against Romney. But Florida is different.</p> <p>The bulk of the Hispanic population in US border states to the west has Mexican roots. Florida's Latino politics has for half a century been dominated by Cubans who fled Fidel Castro's rule and their descendants, and they have generally been solid Republicans because of their hostility to communism.</p> <p>But years of immigration from South and Central America, and more recently migrants from Puerto Rico, has not only contributed to a dramatic change in demographics \u2013 with Latinos rising from one-tenth of the state's population 30 years ago to nearly one quarter today \u2013 but has shifted the ground in this year's presidential election. And unlike many other new arrivals in Florida, people born in Puerto Rico are Americans citizens and can vote, even if their island is not a US state.</p> <p>\"The Puerto Rican vote in Florida is up for grabs,\" said Puerto Rico's Republican governor, Luis Fortuno. \"Puerto Ricans in Florida tend to be very conservative socially. If they are second or third generation moving south from New York, that's different. Those coming straight from Puerto Rico are social conservatives for whom issues such as high taxes are very important.\"</p> <p>Democrats say some of that is true. \"The Puerto Ricans like Romney because they are conservative,\" said Nicole Murillo, secretary of the Democratic party's Hispanic caucus in Kissimmee. \"They don't like abortion. They don't like gay marriage. But Romney as a person who can fix the economy \u2013 very few believe in that.</p> <p>\"When I hear from Latinos that they're not going to vote for Obama because he hasn't fixed the economy, I say: are you going to vote for Romney who only cares about the rich? I say look at it this way: they're both bad but you have to look at the one that is less bad. They say that makes sense.\"</p> <p>There are about one million Cuban Americans in Florida. <a href=\"http://www.miamiherald.com/2012/10/28/3070930_p3/miami-dade-commission-term-limits.html#storylink=cpy\">Opinion polls show about three out of four of them back Romney</a>, in large part because they do not believe Obama has been tough enough on Cuba's communist leadership.</p> <p>But there are also now about 850,000 Puerto Ricans resident in Florida. Many of the new arrivals have settled in Orlando and neighbouring Osceola County, where Kissimmee is the largest town. Latinos now make up 40% of residents and the sharp rise in the number of Puerto Ricans led to the area getting a new congressional district this year.</p> <p>Tammy Celeste, the chair of Kissimmee's Republican party, said that knocking on doors campaigning, she hears a lot of disillusionment with Obama.</p> <p>\"The guy promised them change. He promised them the world and they fell for it,\" she said. \"There's a lot of them that's changing their politics. Mostly they are conservative. They believe in what we believe in \u2013 less government, family. But they just need to be told in Spanish what we stand for. There are those who are much more favourable to [Obama] but they're the ones who don't want to work.\"</p> <p>Murillo, an immigrant from Colombia and a substitute teacher, said she, too, hears the distress over jobs when she's campaigning on streets lined with closed restaurants and shops plastered with \"For Rent\" signs. But that does not necessarily translate into support for Romney.</p> <p>\"In this area, Disney is the biggest employer. They've been cutting a lot of people,\" she said. \"Most of the time we worry more about jobs; how we are going to provide for our families. One of the things that is happening in central Florida, people are having two jobs. That was difficult but now some people have three or four part time jobs in order to provide for your family. People don't look at Romney and think he is going to bring more secure jobs or better pay.\"</p> <p>The Romney campaign is hitting the unemployment issue hard in adverts targeted at Latino voters. It has also bought blocks of air time on a Spanish-language liberal talk radio show during which surrogates get to argue the Republican candidate's case with a sceptical host and Obama supporter, Fernando Miguel Negron.</p> <p>Obama scored points with some Puerto Ricans in particular, and Latinos in general, by appointing Sonia Sotomayor, who is of Puerto Rican heritage, to the US supreme court. Two former Democratic party governors of Puerto Rico, Carlos Romero Barcel\u00f3 and Rafael Hern\u00e1ndez Col\u00f3n \u2013 who are renowned as bitter rivals on the island \u2013 joined forces in Kissimmee to endorse the president.</p> <p>Obama has tried to woo the Cuban American community with an endorsement from Cristina Saralegui, a talk show host sometimes described as the Oprah Winfrey of Spanish-language television in Florida. Saralegui, who arrived in Florida as a child refugee from Cuba, says she is backing Obama because he \"understands the Hispanic community and has supported it unconditionally\".</p> <p>Saralegui joined Michelle Obama in an advert where the first lady said it was important to reelect her husband because of the promise of immigration reform and preserving achievements such as healthcare and widening access to higher education.</p> <p>But while immigration plays significantly as an issue with Latino voters in other parts of the US \u2013 and Obama said in an interview with Spanish-language television that his failure to pass comprehensive immigration reform is his biggest failure to date \u2013 it does not have the same weight in Florida.</p> <p>Puerto Ricans, who have automatic American citizenship, have the right to vote if they live in the US, and most Cubans who make it to Florida are generally granted legal residence.</p> <p>But Republican leaders' attitudes toward immigration do have an impact in Florida, where Latinos are generally more sympathetic to the plight of the undocumented even if it is not so much of a voting issue. Murillo said Republican-sponsored legislation, such as anti-immigrant statutes in Arizona and Alabama, reinforce the perception that the party is hostile to minorities.</p> <p>\"I haven't heard people talking about immigration,\" she said. \"It's not a big issue. But people do talk about the Republicans and how they want self-deportation and to bring the Arizona laws to Florida. They want to make the only language English, but we raise our kids bilingual,\" she said.</p> <p>Romero said that while immigration is not a voting issue for her, she thinks the Republicans have called it wrong. \"People have sympathy for illegal immigrants. I don't see them lying in a hammock, getting a suntan. Many of them work three times as hard as an American,\" she said.</p> <p>Which puts her at odds with Romney's views. \"I think it's fair to say there's always room for change. We need to continue to review the policy,\" she said.</p>",
  "<p>President Obama has run one of the most secretive administrations in history. His commitment to a free press and free speech in the digital age is, at best, limited. Yet, Mitt Romney's record tells you that he'd make Obama look like a paragon of openness.</p> <p>Let's start with Obama, whose performance has been just north of abysmal on these matters. Let's give him credit for one major initiative that has been on the positive side: the administration's <a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/open\">\"Open Government Initiative\"</a>, which was a polar opposite to the Bush era's default condition of secrecy. While it hasn't remotely kept his 2009 promise of \"creating an unprecedented level of openness in government\", it has led to the public availability of more data than we've seen in the past. And <a href=\"http://sunlightfoundation.com/blog/2011/12/06/data-released-via-the-open-government-directive-has-been-put-to-good-use/\">that data has been used in any number of ways by any number of people and organizations</a> to shine some light on our society and its government.</p> <p>But the Sunlight Foundation, which focuses exclusively on opening data for public use, has <a href=\"http://sunlightfoundation.com/blog/2011/12/07/obamas-open-government-directive-two-years-on/\">made clear how many departments and agencies have blown off the White House directives</a>, and how there's been no penalty for their obfuscations. At best, as the foundation puts it, the administration's record is mixed.</p> <p>On secrecy in other respects, the Obama crowd has not been significantly different from the George W Bush administration, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/nov/02/obama-civil-liberties-history\">as Glenn Greenwald has described</a>. The White House and agencies have taken an even more expansive view of their right to withhold even the most basic information about what government is doing in our names and with our money. Two examples among many: American drones, which are killing people in a variety of undeclared war zones, don't officially exist. And the Obama justice department has made the breathtakingly Orwellian argument that the <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/29/opinion/surveillance-and-accountability.html\">public can't go to court over government's illegal, pervasive electronic surveillance because it's a state secret</a>.</p> <p>When pressed hard on free speech and a free press, the Obama administration takes a dim view of both. The logic of <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2010/12/06/war_on_speech/\">its attacks on WikiLeaks</a> \u2013 public and secret \u2013 could be used against any major journalism organization that solicits and publishes leaked information. The <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/12/sunday-review/a-high-tech-war-on-leaks.html\">Obama government has prosecuted more leakers, or whistleblowers,</a> than all the previous ones combined, and has spied on journalists in the process.</p> <p>Free speech in a digital era is about data networks. Here, too, the incumbent has, at best, a mixed record. The White House has talked a reasonably good game, as well, on keeping the internet open and not letting the telecom industry, Hollywood and other corporate interests lock it down to serve their own narrow purposes. In almost every case that matters, however, the administration's actions don't support those words.</p> <p>The Federal Communications Commission (FCC), with its Democratic majority, adopted rules promoting network neutrality \u2013 the idea that the broadband duopoly of cable and phone companies should not be allowed to favor one kind of data traffic over another, with a few exceptions aimed at network management. But the FCC's rules for mobile data, which is increasingly the way people use the internet, allow the carriers to manipulate and limit traffic pretty much at will, and the regulations for wired lines \u2013 which the industry has challenged in any case \u2013 are full of loopholes.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the Obama government has almost always sided with the \"copyright cartel\" in its wish to take control of the internet. There's been one notable exception: the administration's belated, but welcome refusal to support the odious Sopa (Stop Online Privacy Act) earlier this year. But the government has repeatedly acted in ways that threaten free speech online, including its theft \u2013 this is the right word \u2013 of any number of domains it has decided to take down from the internet (after \"intellectual property\" holders complain and with no input from the alleged offenders).</p> <p>One was a hip-hop blog that got its domain back a year after its theft by the government, with <a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/news/2011/12/ice-admits-months-long-seizure-of-music-blog-was-a-mistake.ars\">not even a pretense of an apology</a>. And the administration has supported \u2013 in many cases, as the principal author \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2012/10/ceta-replicates-acta\">secretive</a> <a href=\"https://www.eff.org/issues/tpp\">treaty</a> <a href=\"https://www.eff.org/issues/acta\">negotiations</a> that would create Sopa-like, and worse, laws via backdoor methods.</p> <p>At the same time, the Obama justice department has repeatedly made clear that it wants ever more surveillance powers. This what every government does, no matter who runs it, but Obama once claimed to be in favor of civil liberties \u2013 and then broke almost every promise in this arena (with the one exception of gay rights).</p> <p>All of this \u2013 and there's much more \u2013 would make someone who believes in open government, free speech and an open internet long for a better candidate. Unfortunately, the other major-party candidate this year would almost certainly be worse in every way.</p> <p>Romney's penchant for secrecy goes beyond his refusal to disclose his own finances \u2013 thereby denying voters a chance to see how the man who claims his business record would make him a good president has actually behaved with his money. He and his associates hid or disposed of documents that would shed light on his two other major professional achievements: <a href=\"http://www.boston.com/news/politics/articles/2012/07/24/after_romney_pledged_transparent_olympics_key_documents_were_destroyed/?page=full\">his Olympics leadership in Utah</a> and <a href=\"http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2011/12/06/questions-raised-about-romneys-disposal-of-records/\">his administration as governor of Massachusetts</a>. </p> <p>Romney is against network neutrality \u2013 in favor of an internet that big companies control for their own purposes. His party wants to wage a war on pornography, even though that would be a proxy war on free speech itself. And he's even more hostile to civil liberties \u2013 except the right create home arsenals of firearms \u2013 than Obama, which is saying something.</p> <p>I wish the press had paid more attention to these matters in the past few years, or at least during the campaign, but in an era when journalists have abandoned even the pretense of doing their jobs, that's a forlorn hope. I'll have much more to say on the performance of the media in my next column.</p>",

  "<p>Leading Republicans in a key Florida battleground have condemned Mitt Romney's campaign for writing off African American voters and attitudes toward minorities that they say have cost the party crucial support.</p> <p>Art Wood, chairman of the Republican party in Hillsborough County, a diverse area of about one million people and one of the most heavily contested regions of the state, said his party's presidential candidate failed to even try to win over black voters.</p> <p>\"Romney did a really poor job with minorities. That was my greatest disappointment. You'd go on to his website and he'd have a column for outreach. You clicked on that and there was Catholics for Romney, Democrats for Romney, fishermen for Romney. You never saw blacks or African Americans for Romney until four weeks ago,\" Wood said.</p> <p>\"I think it's the big frigging smart guys at the top who think they know how to run a campaign, and they probably just wrote off the African American vote. Romney did a really poor job with the African Americans. They're in many ways like Hispanics. They favour traditional marriage, they go to church regularly, they're suffering worse from unemployment.\"</p> <p>Wood was backed by a Republican contender for the US Congress in the area, EJ Otero, who is not even including his party affiliation on his election posters and literature because he thinks it will harm his chances.</p> <p>\"I think it's true but not only with the Romney campaign. That's a problem with the Republican party as a whole, and not just with African Americans. Hispanics, too. The Republican party has written off African Americans and Hispanics for the past 20 years and it needs to change,\" he said.</p> <p>Otero, a former air force colonel who served in Iraq and is of Cuban descent, said part of his party's problem is how it discusses issues that are important to minorities such as immigration and welfare.</p> <p>\"I do believe we've got to get off the emotional argument of: the border, the border, the border. We need to control the border so white slavery stops and narco trafficking. But when it comes to the people, we're talking about community,\" he said. \"There's also this myth that all poor people want here is handouts. They don't. All they want is the jobs they used to have.\"</p> <p>Otero acknowledged that he has distanced himself from his own party. \"I put my ideas. Nowhere in there does it say I'm a Republican. That's not helpful,\" he said.</p> <p>African American and Latino voters waiting outside the C Blythe Andrews library in Tampa to cast their ballot in early voting said Republican attitudes towards the less well off, and even \"fear\" of a Romney presidency, is driving people in the area to the polls.</p> <p>\"This is a serious election,\" said Tonya Lewis who runs a charity, Children With A Vision, to help underprivileged young people in school. \"There's been so much negativity from the Republicans. Mitt Romney scares the hell out of me. Romney can't relate to the people, he has no connection to the people. People are really afraid because if you get somebody whose worth millions of dollars, how can they know?\"</p> <p>Betty Reed, a Democratic party representative in the Florida legislature, said that turnout for early voting in the area is so high that she was arranging buses to move people to less busy polling stations.</p> <p>\"Voters in this area support the president but they're turning out to keep Romney out. His campaign played a big role. He went to the NAACP meeting and he talked about how he wanted to get rid of Planned Parenthood, things that are good for poor people. He didn't talk about what he would do for us,\" she said. \"Race is also a part of it. There's more than one issue but we know some people did not want Obama to be successful as president and we know why.\"</p> <p>Vivien Warren, who was brought from Cuba to the US as a child, was among those at the library voting for Obama. She said that the Republican-controlled Florida legislature's cutting in half of the number of days early voting, along with attempts to introduce new photo identification requirements at polling places that were struck down by a federal court as discriminatory, also drove people to vote.</p> <p>\"There's been a lot of talk among people about voter suppression. People are angry. How dare they? They're trying to prevent us from voting,\" she said.</p> <p>\"People are also angry that Romney and the Republicans have been disrespectful of the office of the president. The way Romney talked to him at the debate. People think that's about race. They don't want a black person in the White House.\"</p> <p>The legislature's removal of the last Sunday before the general election as an early voting day \u2013 a day when many African Americans went to the polls after church \u2013 mobilised religious leaders to launch a campaign, Souls to the Polls, to get black people to vote the previous Sunday instead. Vote monitors say it was successful and that turnout in minority districts will at least match that of 2008.</p>",
  "<p>The campaign is nearing an end. The final polls are being conducted. Soon enough, we'll all be sitting and watching actual votes being counted.</p> <p>For election junkies like myself, we always have a lot of data in our minds. We know a state's voting history and what to expect from it. What I've done here is try and put you inside the head of someone like me. I've laid out, as clearly as possible, what I believe are the key states in the presidential race on election night, along with key details on each state including <a href=\"http://www.thegreenpapers.com/G12/closing.phtml?format=gc\">closing times</a> (note that no state will be called until the last closing time for a given state), <a href=\"http://www.ismittromneythepresident.com/\">polling average</a>, <a href=\"http://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/\">voting history</a> and the key swing counties in each state.</p> <p>The assumptions made here are pretty simple. We start with an electoral map where President Obama holds a 237 to 206 electoral vote lead. This leaves eight swing states listed below. You might notice that some of the peripheral swing states such as North Carolina and Pennsylvania are not listed. If either Obama carries North Carolina or Romney wins in Pennsylvania, this election is likely to be over very quickly. They are not swing states in my opinion.</p> <p>So, here are write-ups on the key swing states in chronological order of poll closings.</p> <p><strong>Virginia (7pm ET)</strong></p> <p><em>Real Clear Politics average:</em> Romney +0.5 points</p> <p><em>2008 result:</em> Obama won by 6.3pt</p> <p><em>2004 result:</em> Bush won by 8.2pt</p> <p><em>Swing counties with 50k+ population (in every case, percentage points more Democratic than state in 2008):</em> Henrico (+5.9), Loudoun (+2.0)</p> <p>No state better represents the old v the new south. The northern part of the state surrounding Washington, DC is filled with highly-educated Democratic supporters, while most of the rest of the state's white population is Republican. Obama also benefits from a large African-American population in the south-east. Virginia had not voted for a Democrat for president since 1964 until it voted for Obama in 2008. The polls show the state to be dead-even, so expect this race to take hours for the networks to call as northern Virginia is usually the last to report.</p> <p><strong>Ohio (7.30pm ET)</strong></p> <p><em>Real Clear Politics average:</em> Obama +2.3pt</p> <p><em>2008 result:</em> Obama won by 4.6pt</p> <p><em>2004 result:</em> Bush won by 2.1pt</p> <p><em>Swing counties with 50k+ population:</em> Hamilton (+2.2), Lake (-3.7), Montgomery (+1.6), Portage (+4.4), Stark (+0.9), Wood (+2.5)</p> <p>No Republican has ever won the presidency without winning Ohio. This year will likely not be an exception. Obama is buffered by a large African-American population surrounding Cleveland, as well as old conservative Democrats along the state's eastern border. Romney benefits from evangelical support in the more rural areas in the western and southern sections of Ohio. Romney's strength with white working-class voters has been slowed in Ohio because of Obama's support of the auto bailout and Romney's lack thereof. Obama holds a small lead in the polls: don't expect the state to be called by the networks for at least four hours after closing.</p> <p><strong>Florida (7pm ET for eastern part of state; 8pm ET for the west)</strong></p> <p><em>Real Clear Politics average:</em> Romney +1.2pt</p> <p><em>2008 result:</em> Obama won by 2.8pt</p> <p><em>2004 result:</em> Bush won by 5.0pt</p> <p><em>Swing counties with 50k+ population:</em> Duval (-0.9), Hernando (+0.7), Hillsborough (+4.4), Pasco (+0.8), Sarasota (-2.9), Volusia (+2.9)</p> <p>George W Bush won the state by 537 votes and, with it, the White House in 2000. Much of the northern two-thirds of the state is filled with residents whose families have lived in Florida for generations. These folks are Romney's strength, along with Cubans in Miami. Obama will do very well with a growing non-Cuban Hispanic population around Orlando, black voters and Jewish retirees in the southeast. Look at the I-4 corridor in the central part of the state from Orlando to Tampa: whoever wins the I-4 will likely win the state. Polls give Romney a slight edge, although it is too close to call.</p> <p><strong>New Hampshire (7pm ET for most of state; 8pm ET for a few bigger cities)</strong></p> <p><em>Real Clear Politics average:</em> Obama +2.0pt</p> <p><em>2008 result:</em> Obama won by 9.6pt</p> <p><em>2004 result:</em> Kerry won by 1.4pt</p> <p><em>Swing counties with 50k+ population:</em> Hillsborough (-5.9), Merrimack (+4.2)</p> <p>New Hampshire was the only state to vote for George W Bush in 2000 and John Kerry in 2004. It supported Obama in 2008, but did a U-turn and voted three Republicans to the federal government in the 2010 midterms. The state is nearly all-white, yet it has a unique mix of old-time Libertarians, tax escapees from Massachusetts (note there's no income or sales tax in New Hampshire) and social liberals on the state's western edge. New Hampshire only has four electoral votes, but they could play a big role in a number of electoral scenarios. The race here is too close to call, with perhaps a slight edge to Obama.</p> <p><strong>Colorado (9pm ET)</strong></p> <p><em>Real Clear Politics average:</em> Obama + 0.9pt</p> <p><em>2008 result:</em> Obama won by 9.0pt</p> <p><em>2004 result:</em> Bush won by 4.7pt</p> <p><em>Swing counties with 50k+ population:</em> Arapahoe (+4.0), Jefferson (+0.1), Larimer (+0.8)</p> <p>This state is ground zero for the newer parts of the Democratic formula to win, despite losing working-class whites. Latinos, along with a growing highly-educated white suburban population around Denver, have shifted this former Republican stronghold into a state where either party can win. Republicans still run strong in the exurbs of Weld and the strongly religious El Paso County, home to the Christian conservative group Focus on the Family. Jefferson County, which is the basis for the comedy South Park, is likely to mirror the state's vote. Polling in the state indicates that the race is a true toss-up.</p> <p><strong>Wisconsin (9pm ET)</strong></p> <p><em>Real Clear Politics average:</em> Obama +5.0pt</p> <p><em>2008 result:</em> Obama won by 13.9pt</p> <p><em>2004 result:</em> Kerry won by 0.4pt</p> <p><em>Swing counties with 50k+ population:</em> Kenosha (+4.2), Outagamie (-2.3), Racine (-6.7), Winnebago (-2.3)</p> <p>No state is perhaps more partisan than the Badger. It was here where a recall drive against the state's controversial Republican governor failed in June. Each candidate is pretty much locked in, with 47% of the vote no matter what. Obama can count on Milwaukee with its black population, socially liberal whites around the University of Wisconsin and old-time Democrats in the west. Romney must crush in the Milwaukee suburbs, which are among the most conservative in the nation. The area around Green Bay in the northeast matches the word \"swing\" perfectly. If Romney doesn't win Ohio, he must win here. Polls give Obama a small lead.</p> <p><strong>Iowa (10pm ET)</strong></p> <p><em>Real Clear Politics average:</em> Obama +2.0pt</p> <p><em>2008 result:</em> Obama won by 9.4pt</p> <p><em>2004 result:</em> Bush won by 0.7pt</p> <p><em>Swing counties with 50k+ population:</em> Polk (+5.1), Scott (+5.0), Woodbury (-10.0)</p> <p>This state is where the primary season begins, and it likes to keep Americans guessing. It's a mix of old heartland liberals in the east and very conservative evangelicals in the west. This was one of only two states that voted for Al Gore in 2000 and George W Bush in 2004. No state has better mirrored the national vote since 1992 than Iowa. Early voting suggests a tight race, while polling gives Obama a small advantage. Obama won his first victory outside of Illinois here and would like to win where his national candidacy began. Iowa has historically not been decided until very late in the evening.</p> <p><strong>Nevada (10pm ET)</strong></p> <p><em>Real Clear Politics average:</em> Obama +2.7pt</p> <p><em>2008 result:</em> Obama won by 12.5pt</p> <p><em>2004 result:</em> Bush won by 2.6pt</p> <p><em>Swing counties with 50k+ population:</em> Washoe (+0.1)</p> <p>There is perhaps no better example of the gaining influence of Latinos in the American south-west. Combined with Jewish retirees, blacks and white casino workers, Latinos form the Democratic base in and around Las Vegas. Democrats, led by Senate Majority leader Harry Reid, have been registering voters at an incredible pace. Mitt Romney is relying on a base in the rural areas, including a large Mormon population. Washoe County in the north-west is a swing county and usually votes with the winner. Early voting suggests that Obama will carry the state, with polling mostly agreeing: Obama will likely win Nevada by a small margin.</p>",
  "<p>Hurricane Sandy caused chaos across the Caribbean and America, bringing disruption to the presidential campaign (due to take place on Tuesday) and devastation to the lives of those affected in the towns and cities it has passed through.</p> <p>I was caught in the path of a hurricane once.

  "<p>First one body appeared, floating in the waters of the Bay of Bengal, then another, and another, until those on board the little fishing boat that had gone to their rescue began to lose count.</p> <p>Those bobbing lifeless among the waves had set out the night before, so desperate to escape the growing sectarian violence in Burma that they were prepared to risk boarding the dangerously overcrowded boat.</p> <p>At least 130 had clambered aboard, but the boat foundered \u2013 whether it capsized because of the weight of bodies or because it struck rocks remains unclear.</p> <p>The sinking last week was the worst reported incident resulting from the outbreak of violence between Rakhine Buddhists and Rohingya Muslims in western Burma. The death toll is continuing to rise amid reports of a deepening humanitarian crisis.</p> <p>\"The situation is dire. The UN is doing its best, but it is trying to find more funding to help them,\" said Chris Lewa, director of the Arakan Project, an NGO working with the Rohingya.</p> <p>With at least 32,000 people displaced by the latest violence \u2013 and at least 107,000 since trouble broke out in June \u2013 thousands have sought safety in refugee camps around the Burmese town of Sittwe. Those camps are at crisis point, according to Refugees International, which estimates that nearly a quarter of children were malnourished.</p> <p>\"Conditions in these camps are as bad, if not worse, than ones in eastern Congo or Sudan,\" said Melanie Teff, a researcher with the charity who visited Sittwe in September. \"Child malnutrition rates are startlingly high. There's an urgent need for clean water and food. If further aid does not come through, there will be some unnecessary deaths.\"</p> <p>In Baw Du Pha relief camp, where several thousand Rohingya refugees from Sittwe are surviving on rations and are severely short of medical care, Laila, 20, a mother of four, said: \"I cannot give my baby rice when she needs it. We are suffering. When my daughter gets sick we have no money for medicine.\"</p> <p>Compounding the need for essentials such as rice, water and oil, aid workers said refugees were facing a mounting psychological toll, with children bearing the brunt. \"They lost their houses in the fires. Children cannot be left alone like before. So they're depressed,\" said Moe Thadar, a local Red Cross worker.</p> <p>The death toll and fear of further violence have prompted many of the Rohingya to look for sanctuary in neighbouring Muslim countries. Many have concluded that the only realistic escape route is by sea. Thousands are reported to have been waiting for the end of the rainy season to put to sea. Those that have tried to get away have found that those countries are unwilling to accept them. Lewa said at least two boats had been turned back by Bangladesh last week and had returned to Sittwe.</p> <p>\"On Wednesday, we heard that about 7,000 people had arrived in Sittwe from Kyaukpyu [on the coast to the south] and Pauktaw [inland and to the east]. There were still about 900 of them sitting on the beach in Sittwe, while others had moved to camps or villages.\"</p> <p>The UN has urged the Burmese government to tackle the causes of the conflict, prompting authorities to order people to turn in their weapons to police. It also urged Burma's neighbours to not to close their borders, but the appeal brought no immediate change of heart.</p> <p>Some of those who have fled, such as the victims of last week's sinking, headed for Malaysia, where people-smugglers will take them for a fee. Others are looking closer to home \u2013 to Bangladesh and Thailand \u2013 but neither country wants them. Bangladesh is already home to around 300,000 Rohingya and is concerned about rising numbers. It has said that it will turn away boats, although people near Cox's Bazar, close to where last week's accident happened, said that some had made land and gone into hiding. Thailand does not want them and has been accused of forcing refugee boats back out to sea when they have tried to land. The latest assessment from the Burmese government \u2013 which regards the Rohingya as illegal immigrants \u2013 said 89 people had been killed in clashes between 21 and 30 October, with another 136 injured and 32,231 made homeless. At least 5,000 houses had been burned down. Activists say the true figures are likely to be higher.</p> <p>\"The villages have been burned down and some people have fled. A few have remained in the area, but others have tried to flee to the camps in Sittwe,\" said Lewa. \"In some villages quite a lot of people have been killed, but we are still trying to find out how they died. Some died in the fires and some were attacked by Rakhine [Buddhists]. We also heard that the army shot at some of the Rakhine people. We heard about 170 people killed in one village alone.\"</p> <p>Teff said the outlook for peace was grim. \"There is a total lack of hope for the Rohingya. They have been rejected by many countries,\" she said. \"The only way out is for the international community to act on the current situation.\"</p>",
  "<p>After a decade in which Italian politics was dominated by showgirls and sleaze, Beppe Grillo's brand of web-based democracy and anti-corruption campaigning has been taking Italy by storm, and his movement became Sicily's biggest party in regional elections last weekend and came second in nationwide polls.</p> <p>But the tousle-haired comedian and blogger has now been dragged into a very familiar sounding Italian row after he was accused of being a \"medieval\" sexist and no different to politician Silvio Berlusconi.</p> <p>At first glance, Grillo appears the antithesis of the permatanned former prime minister, who packed his TV shows and his cabinet with showgirls and passed around a phallic statue to break the ice at his famous bunga bunga parties. But the comedian's non-sexist credentials were called into question when Federica Salsi, a local councillor representing his Five Star Movement in Bologna, appeared on a TV talk show, ignoring Grillo's strict instructions to his councillors to stay off TV and stick to the internet.</p> <p>Reacting angrily to her appearance on TV, Grillo likened the lure of television to \"the G-spot, which gives you an orgasm in talk-show studios. It is Andy Warhol's 15 minutes of fame. At home, your friends and relations applaud emotionally as they share the excitement of a brief moment of celebrity.\"</p> <p>Forty-year-old Salsi was quick to fight back, calling Grillo's outburst \"disappointing\", adding: \"He has shown himself to be a victim of the Berlusconi culture \u2026 a chauvinist like the others.\"</p> <p>Grillo's reference to the G-spot, she said, gave \"a negative connotation to a quality women have\" \u2013 and that, she concluded, \"is medieval, really degrading\".</p> <p>Salsi was backed up by another Five Star councillor, Raffaella Pirini, who said: \"She did well, she said the right things.\"</p> <p>The row vividly recalled the years in which Berlusconi's TV channels featured leering male game show hosts flirting with semi-naked dancing girls, while the tycoon-turned-politician's cabinet ministers appeared in public with attractive young women on their arm.</p> <p>Since Berlusconi stepped down last November, replaced by a government of technocrats led by sober academic Mario Monti, lewd TV advertising has been toned down, Miss Italy contestants have been ordered to show less flesh and the new, female, head of the state TV network demanded daytime hosts put a stop to endless discussions of plastic surgery.</p> <p>Grillo's visceral loathing of the rowdy talk shows aired nightly on Italian TV is based on the idea that they give visibility to the caste of professional politicians his movement is seeking to oust. Grillo himself was banned from state TV in 1987 after joking about government corruption, prompting him to take his routine to live audiences and build his blog into one of the world's biggest.</p> <p>But his belief in online democracy, where policy is shaped by his supporters in web forums, could be challenged as more of them gain elected office and are tempted by invitations from chat shows.</p> <p>Fifteen more took office as regional councillors in Sicily after regional elections last weekend, which saw Grillo's movement poll 285,000 votes to become Sicily's largest party, even if it lost out to a coalition between the centre-left and centrist parties.</p> <p>After swimming the Strait of Messina to kick off a series of rallies across Sicily, Grillo told a crowd: \"The police vote for us because they are fed up with driving politicians to do shopping or have sex.\"</p> <p>Compared with a 2008 election on the island, Berlusconi's party lost 654,000 votes in the election, which came two days after he was convicted of tax fraud.</p> <p>Grillo's leading candidate in Sicily said the movement would not now be tempted by backroom alliances with other parties, preferring to be \"bitter spinsters who never have boyfriends\". He also announced that he and his fellow councillors would hand back a portion of the inflated salaries that local politicians in Sicily are paid.</p> <p>Now, with one pollster predicting that the Five Star Movement could become the biggest party in Italy, Grillo will be eagerly awaiting regional elections due in Lazio and Lombardy, where the reputations of the local authorities have been ravaged by corruption scandals.Then, next spring, national elections are due as Monti steps down. Grillo has not stood for office himself to date but, in a video posted on his blog this week, he called himself a \"political leader\" of the movement for the first time and added: \"We are about to confront something extraordinary.\"</p> <p>Sitting at a desk covered in piles of paper in front of a guitar propped against the wall, the comedian warned: \"It will be an epochal change, tough, and we will make mistakes, I will make mistakes, you will accuse me of everything.\"</p> <p>But, he asked, \"instead of hammering us, give us advice, a hand, we need both\".</p>",
  "<p>Last year, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2011/nov/06/observer-graphic-short-story-prize-greenberg\" title=\"\">Isabel Greenberg</a>, the winner of the <em>Observer</em>/Jonathan Cape/Comica&#xa0;graphic short story competition, bagged the prize on her third time of trying. But <a href=\"http://corbanwilkin.com/\" title=\"\">Corban Wilkin</a> has gone one better than that, having won the 2012 prize \u2013 the sixth in its history \u2013 on his fourth go. How does it feel to have pulled it off after so long? Pretty good: after all, he beat 200 other cartoonists along the way. \"The only thing I'm sad about is that I won't be able to enter again. I've loved doing it over the past few years. The brief is tricky \u2013 a very limited format and yet complete freedom of subject matter \u2013 but it's a challenge I relished. Once you enter, your writing improves pretty quickly. Four pages is a small space in which to tell a proper story.\"</p> <p>Wilkin, 22, who is originally from Colchester, studied illustration at Middlesex University; his influences include the great Canadian cartoonists <a href=\"http://www.dootdootgarden.com/\" title=\"\">Craig Thompson</a> (\"his drawings are spot on\") and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seth_(cartoonist)\" title=\"\">Seth</a>. His winning entry, \"<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/interactive/2012/nov/04/observer-graphic-story-winner-but-i-cant\" title=\"\">But I Can't</a>\", is a story of friendship, obsession and alien landings. The judges (Hannah Berry, author of the graphic novel <em>Britten and Br\u00fclightly</em>; Paul Gravett, director of <a href=\"http://www.comicafestival.com/\" title=\"\">Comica</a>; Dan Franklin, publisher of Jonathan Cape; Suzanne Dean, Random House's creative director, and yours truly) liked Wilkin's use of colour; he uses Indian ink and watercolour, which he applies with a brush. But we were also impressed by the way he takes his characters, Lucy and Harriet, from childhood through to adulthood in just four scant pages. Where did this eerie story come from? \"When I was about seven, I had a friend who lived nearby and we were both into UFO sightings,\" says Wilkin. \"We went through a brief but memorable phase of sending signals in to space with a walkie-talkie. Years later, I tried to imagine what it would be like if someone somewhere was to cling on to that childhood interest, only for it tear them from their increasingly sceptical friends.\"</p>  <figure class=\"element element-audio\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.scribd.com/embeds/111775935/content?start_page=1&amp;view_mode=scroll&amp;access_key=key-sbzdds56j1mhmctf5bh\"> <a title=\"View on Scribd\" href=\"http://www.scribd.com/doc/111775935/\" style=\"margin: 12px auto 6px auto; font-family: Helvetica,Arial,Sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; font-size: 14px; line-height: normal; font-size-adjust: none; font-stretch: normal; -x-system-font: none; display: block; text-decoration: underline;\"></a><iframe class=\"scribd_iframe_embed\" src=\"https://www.scribd.com/embeds/111775935/content?start_page=1&view_mode=scroll&access_key=key-sbzdds56j1mhmctf5bh\" data-auto-height=\"true\" data-aspect-ratio=\"0.759950248756219\" scrolling=\"no\" id=\"doc_40092\" width=\"100%\" height=\"600\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Wilkin knew he wanted to draw comics from the age of 16, when he read the rather fantastic <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Understanding-Comics-Invisible-Scott-McCloud/dp/006097625X\" title=\"\"><em>Understanding Comics: The Invisible Art</em></a> by Scott McCloud. \"Until that point, I always thought I'd illustrate novels. But then I became crazy about comics and have been ever since.\" What will he do next? \"Finish my graphic novel, which should take about a month. It's called <em>Breaker's End</em> and it's about a couple who live in a tent in the woods. Hopefully, winning this is going to help me to find a publisher for it. After that, I'll start another one. Repeat until death.\" The prize money (\u00a31,000) is, he says, extremely welcome. \"To be honest, this has come at the right time. I'm broke. Unfortunately, it may have to go on rent. But I'll stock up on art materials, too. My brushes are expensive.\"</p> <p>Though the standard for entries was perhaps a little lower than in previous years, it was still tricky to choose a runner-up. In the end, we went for \"I, Yeti\" by Steve Tillotson, a gorgeous tale of loneliness and ice, starring a very large, very hairy yeti. Tillotson never intended to be a writer of comics; having done an MA in print-making at the Royal College of Art, he always thought he would be what he calls a \"proper\" artist. Gradually, though, his work became ever more driven by narrative and in 2005 he started writing his <a href=\"http://www.banalpig.com/blog/\" title=\"\"><em>Banal Pig</em></a> comics. His influences include <a href=\"http://danielclowes.com/\" title=\"\">Daniel Clowes</a> and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Ware\" title=\"\">Chris Ware</a>, but also the comics that he grew up with: the<em> Beano</em>, the<em> Dandy</em>, <em>Buster</em> and <em>Whizzer and Chips</em>.</p> <p>Like Wilkin, he has entered the competition before. \"Twice. My plan was to keep entering every year until I won. [But even being runner-up] is surprisingly vindicating.

  "<p>It would be fair to say that measured restraint or delicate, whispered nuance have never held too much interest for Tom Wolfe as a writer. He likes his America extremely loud and incredibly close. Now, at 81, the most vivid literary huckster of our times seems more thrilled than ever to crank up his volume. <em>Back to Blood</em> often reads like a novel for the hard of hearing, megaphone meets ear trumpet. You hesitate to say it is a rage against the dying of the light, since, having invented this register 50 years ago in his wonderful pyrotechnic journalism, Wolfe has been writing in it pretty much ever since. Still, this book is certainly among the shoutiest \u2013 and just possibly the last \u2013 of his comic bullhorn broadsides against soft-spoken liberal pieties.</p> <p>The novel is more than 700 pages long, though you guess about 100 of those are taken up with punctuation. To his familiar bulimia of exclamation marks, Wolfe gorges here unexpectedly on colons, often throwing in a couple of dozen at a time, just because he can. Even for seasoned Wolfe-readers it takes a little while to reacclimatise to the exclamatory style \u2013 like being woken up at three in the morning in a strange hotel room by a blaring shock-jock talk show. The opening paragraphs add a new contender to the author's personal top 10 of headbanging intros: a speedboat is ripping across the harbour in Miami, and the description and talk of the three cops on board is interrupted every half a dozen words by the repetitive SMACK of the hull on the water. It's a typically self-conscious reader's health warning: hold on tight, Wolfe loves to yell, theatrically grinning from the wheel above the frothy tumult of his sentences, it could be a wild ride.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/jan/20/fiction.tomwolfe\" title=\"\">I interviewed the author</a> in his hushed and punctilious Manhattan apartment when he was setting out on the journey of this novel four years ago. He had not long returned from one of the first of his white-suited fact-finding missions to Florida and was full of excited talk of Miami's racial politics out of which <em>Back to Blood</em> would emerge. \"I'm still convinced that if you went to live anywhere in this country for 30 days you would see sides of life you didn't think possible!\" he suggested. His curiosity clearly remained on full-wattage in subsequent visits to Miami but for all his closely reported detail \u2013 the novel, as ever, takes great pride in its observation of the tribal fashions of his characters, the particular $29.99 CVS shades favoured by river police, or the slang of brattish yacht-partying thong-worshipping teens \u2013 Wolfe likes to work with big themes.</p> <p>The high-rev engine of this book engages with the implications of the great migration of Cubans to America's southernmost metropolis, and the reversion of white \"anglo\" culture to a dwindling minority voice, drowned out also by robust African American and Haitian and incoming Russian inflections. This politically fraught recipe \u2013 which gives the insistent bloodlines of the title \u2013 is salted with sex, which is no great respecter of cultural divides and which drives the action forward.</p> <p>From the large cast of characters on which Wolfe's eye lights \u2013 the city's Hispanic mayor, its black police chief, the wimpish and sweating editor of the desperate <em>Miami Herald</em> and the inevitable Russian oligarch \u2013 his narrative comes to focus on a particular young second generation Cuban emigr\u00e9, Nestor Camacho. Comacho is a young cop who barely speaks a word of his parents' Spanish but nevertheless inhabits an America quite distinct from his \"americanos\" colleagues; it is a divide that begins with body-shape: his toned gym fitness contrasts with their walrus bulk. In two televised acts of adrenaline-pumped heroism, Camacho inadvertently succeeds in turning whole sections of the city against him. First, in rescuing \u2013 and arresting \u2013 a Cuban refugee from the top of the mast of a tall ship, he manages to alienate the entire Hispanic community, and second in apprehending a 300lb black crack dealer he risks inciting race riots when footage of their struggle is posted on YouTube.</p> <p>Though Comacho is a more convincingly human Wolfe creation than most \u2013 you at least root for him to spring fully to life \u2013 you are never really persuaded that he is more than an intensively researched, brilliantly expressive caricature among many, another cartoon of wild and whirling interiority. His adventures are played for laughs and drama but the reactions to them feed into the author's long-standing agenda of making mischief out of political correctness. As in <em>Bonfire of the Vanities</em>, his stage-managed ethical dilemmas once again get somewhere near pressure points of American anxiety about multiculturalism. Almost every conversation and interaction is seen to be filtered subconsciously through racial sensitivity of one kind or another, though \u2013 in Wolfe's eyes \u2013 this is a reality that dare not speak its name. Into this minefield Nestor Camacho blunders courageously.</p> <p>There is something ritualistic about Wolfe's return to these familiar satirical hunting grounds, first established in his skewering of \"radical chic\" in the 70s. The money and pretension of modern art, a pet subject since <em>The Painted Word</em> of 1975, gets another amusing going over, in particular in a long bravura scene at Miami-Basel art fair, where billionaires stampede blindly for schlocky Hirst and Koons lookalikes. He has more to say, too, about the packaging and corporatisation of teenage lust, the ostensible subject of his last novel <a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9780099479024\" title=\"\"><em>I&#xa0;Am Charlotte Simmons</em></a>. One strand of this book is concerned with a creepy TV psychiatrist at a porn-addiction clinic, though once again the authorial voice itself sometimes seems fixated by what Wolfe insists on referring to as the \"mons veneris\" of his female characters, (or sometimes the \"lubricious mons pubis\"). After the infamous \"rutrutrutrutrut...\" sex of <em>Charlotte Simmons</em>, however, Wolfe tends to keep himself out of the bedroom here.</p> <p>Intimacy has never been his strong suit. He is, still, at his best in the thick of a crowd, a master of group dynamics, at once in breathless close-up and sudden wide-angle. You don't necessarily go to his writing any more for fresh truth about American life but you can still marvel \u2013 and laugh \u2013 at many of these scenes, full of expertly realised grotesques, and the sheer chest-thumping compulsion of language that tries to do them justice.</p>",
  "<p><a href=\"http://judychicago.com\" title=\"\">Judy Chicago</a> isn't a great one for false modesty \u2013 or modesty of any kind, come to that. When she talks about her work, words such as \"monumental\" and \"major\" fall quickly and easily from her lips. As a young woman, she says, she wanted not only to paint and draw, but to \"set her sights on history\" \u2013 her aim was to bag herself a place in the canon. As for her elaborate 1979 megasculpture <em>The Dinner Party</em>, a provocatively feminist work which celebrates the lives and work of 1,038 notable women, you can forget what the critics say (the late Robert Hughes called it: \"Mainly clich\u00e9\u2026 with the colours of a Taiwanese souvenir factory\"; Hilton Kramer of the <a href=\"http://nytimes.com\" title=\"\"><em>New York Times</em></a> called it: \"Very bad art\u2026 failed art\u2026 art so mired in the pieties of a cause that it quite fails to capture any independent artistic life of its own\"). They're just plain wrong. \"I've watched it change people's lives,\" says Chicago. \"And the fact that the <a href=\"http://brooklynmuseum.org/eascfa/\" title=\"\">Elizabeth A Sackler Center</a> [for Feminist Art, where <em>The Dinner Party</em> is permanently housed] accounts for a third of all the traffic to the <a href=\"http://brooklynmuseum.org\" title=\"\">Brooklyn Museum</a> is testament to the importance of it.\"</p> <p>To be fair, this is what a life spent working with your back against the wall does for a girl: either you crumple and disappear, or you develop a Teflon exterior, a shiny veneer of undentable confidence. Chicago is 72. She began her career in the 60s, long before political correctness and women's studies classes were invented, and her \"dinosaur\" professors at the University of California, Los Angeles, pretty much hated what she was doing right from the start.</p> <p>Her early working life was lonely and she was mostly broke. \"I didn't make myself an outsider,\" she says. \"The art world made me an outsider. Of course, isolation is essential to the creative act. You have to be with yourself, with your ideas. Virginia Woolf talked about it as fishing: you sit on the shore, you drop your line, and you wait for the fish to jump. But I&#xa0;also had to protect myself from the craziness, all the antagonism, around me. It was difficult. I'm not going to say it was anything else. Not everybody could have managed it.\"</p> <p>What did she sacrifice along the way? \"Children. There was no way on this earth I could have had children and the career I've had. But you know what? I&#xa0;don't care how much I had to give up. This was what I wanted. You have to make choices. You&#xa0;can't have everything in life.\"</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398778590\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/11/2/1351886112170/Bigamy-Hood-by-Judy-Chica-008.jpg\" alt=\"Bigamy Hood by Judy Chicago\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Judy Chicago<br/>Bigamy Hood<br/>1965/2011 Photograph: courtesy of Donald Woodman</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: courtesy of Donald Woodman</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Chicago is speaking to me from her home in New Mexico \u2013 a historic railroad hotel that looks like it has come straight out of an old western \u2013 and the delay on the line is contriving to make our conversation sound even more earnest than it would be if she was sitting opposite me. A portentous pause precedes her answers; jokey comments (on my part) are out of the question, being more likely to misfire than cheap Catherine wheels.</p> <p>We're talking ahead of what you might call her British moment. Next month will see no fewer than three shows of her work in the UK. The biggest of these will be at the Ben Uri Gallery in north London \u2013 better known as the London Jewish Museum of Art \u2013 which will house the first British museum survey of her work, featuring pieces from Chicago's personal archive as well as loans from public collections in the US. Meanwhile, there will be two smaller shows at Riflemaker in Soho (Deflowered, an exhibition of early work including <em>Birth Hood</em>, <em>Flight Hood</em> and <em>Bigamy Hood</em> \u2013 depictions of male and female genitalia sprayed in automotive lacquer on to a car hood) and The Black-E in Liverpool (<em>Voices from the Song of Songs</em>, a&#xa0;series of paired prints).</p> <p>Is she thrilled by this interest? Yes, in her own somewhat cool way. \"One of my goals since the permanent housing of <em>The Dinner Party </em>in 2007 has been to develop an awareness that it is only one piece in a really large body of work. In the UK there's not a lot of understanding of my work, except for <em>The Dinner Party</em>.\"</p> <p>This is certainly true. But with Chicago, all roads lead inevitably to <em>The Dinner Party</em>, the monumental installation she created between 1974 and 1979, with the help of numerous volunteers and at a cost of about $250,000. This is what she will be remembered for, and she knows it. The piece consists of a triangular table, 48ft long at each side (the triangle is a&#xa0;symbol of equality). The table is laid with 39 place settings, each one designed to reflect the accomplishments of the woman whose name is embroidered on the runner beside it \u2013 among the women included are Hildegard of Bingen, Mary Wollstonecraft and Virginia Woolf. Beneath the table is a \"heritage floor\", the names of a further 999 women (Catherine of Aragon, Colette, Clytemnestra) inscribed on its tiles. It sounds uncontroversial, celebrating, as it does, the history of women through applied arts such as embroidery and china&#xa0;painting. But then you look at the plates. Each one is decorated with a&#xa0;symbol that resembles a vulva. Depending on your point of view, this is either reductive, vulgar and semi-pornographic, or it's celebratory, taboo-breaking and bracingly political.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398778592\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/11/2/1351886458194/Judy-Chicago-The-Dinner-P-008.jpg\" alt=\"Judy Chicago: The Dinner Party \u2013 Detail Mary Wollstonecraft Placesetting\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Judy Chicago<br/>The Dinner Party \u2013 Detail: Mary Wollstonecraft Placesetting Photograph: collection of the Elizabeth A.

Sackler Center for Feminist Art Brooklyn Museum of Art</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Is Chicago tired of talking about it? Not at all. Her abiding relationship with <em>The Dinner Party</em> is, for her, simply another aspect of its legacy. \"It's unusual for an artist to stay involved with a work after they've finished it for as long as I did. It took 26 years to find a&#xa0;permanent home for it, but unless that happened, it was in danger of repeating the story it recounted\u2013 by which I&#xa0;mean the repeated erasure of women from history. I was not released from the piece until it was housed.\"</p> <p>And since it went to Brooklyn, have attitudes to it softened? In 1979 some galleries refused to show it at all. \"Well, it doesn't have the charge it had for the dinosaur critics of my generation,\" she says. \"<em>The Dinner Party</em> marks the moment when history changed, and we reclaimed the right to deal with our own subject matter, in our own way \u2013 and young people take all that for granted.\"</p> <p>This doesn't mean its work is&#xa0;done. \"I read Caitlin Moran's <em>How to Be a Woman</em>,\" says Chicago, her twangy voice rising indignantly. \"There's a chapter where she says: let's admit it, girls, for the last 100,000 years women have basically done fuck all. I'm like: excuse me? She's a smart girl and yet so ignorant. So, yes, there's been change, and no, there hasn't been change.\"</p> <p>Art-world statistics, in particular, still make for depressing reading. Work by women artists comprises just 3-5% of major permanent collections in the US and Europe. \"It's alarming. In our institutions, women are still an add-on to a male-centred curriculum,\" she says.</p> <p>Chicago was born Judith Cohen in \u2013 you guessed it \u2013 Chicago (she changed her name in the 60s by way of a feminist statement, though it was galling to discover that she required her husband's signature for this to be legal). Her father, Arthur, worked nights at the post office; her mother, May, was a secretary. Arthur was active in the Communist party, and in the 50s found himself a victim of McCarthyism.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398778593\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/11/2/1351887453854/Judy-Chicago-Birth-Hood-008.jpg\" alt=\"Judy Chicago Birth Hood\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Judy Chicago<br/>Birth Hood<br/>\u00a9 Judy Chicago, 1965 (finished 2011) Photograph: Donald Woodman</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Donald Woodman</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\"Starting out, several things sustained me. One was my burning desire to make art. Another was when I realised what women before me had gone through in order for me to have the opportunities that I had. When I felt rejected, I thought about Elizabeth Blackwell [the first woman in the US to receive a medical degree]. At medical school, no one spoke to her for two years. Women used to spit on her in the street. I thought: if she can do it, I can. But the most important thing was the family. I had a&#xa0;wonderful father, with wonderful values. He believed it was possible to change the world. Yet at school, children's newspapers portrayed people like him as evil. There was a contradiction between my experience and what the world was saying, and I had to learn to trust my experience.\"</p> <p>At three, she began to draw. At five, she started attending classes at the Art Institute of Chicago. She studied for her degree at UCLA, but it wasn't until graduate school that the themes that have dominated her work since began to emerge. Her professors were dismayed-bordering-on-horrified by works such as <em>Bigamy</em>, in which an abstract penis was \"stopped in flight\" before it could unite with its vaginal equivalent (this work connected to the death of her first husband, who had died in a car crash).</p> <p>Chicago, though, was not to be put off. She did exactly what she wanted to do. Her career is categorised not only by its content, but by the way she jumps from medium to medium (she went to car-body school to learn how to use an airbrush; more recently she has worked in glass). \"I'm not like most artists,\" she says. \"I'm not career driven. Damien Hirst's dots sold, so he made thousands of dots. I would, like, never do that! It wouldn't even occur to me.\" Nor would it occur to her to minimise the importance of those who help her in the studio. \"The difference between me and other artists is that I acknowledge the people who work with me. Henry Moore had hundreds of 'assistants'. But they were really collaborators. They brought their skills and knowledge, but when he was interviewed, he made them leave while he jumped in front of the best sculpture in the room. It's a whole unexamined area of the art world, this hidden collaboration.\"</p> <p>Before we hang up, I must ask: has she read <em>Vagina</em>, Naomi Wolf's new book? \"Yeah, I've read it. The reviews were so vitriolic, I wondered: what in God's name did she say that set off such a firestorm? It was exactly the same kind of vitriol that met <em>The Dinner Party</em>.\"</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398778591\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/11/2/1351887540025/Judy-Chicago-Aging-WomanA-001.jpg\" alt=\"Judy Chicago Aging Woman/Artist/Jew\" width=\"220\" height=\"246\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Judy Chicago<br/>Aging Woman/Artist/Jew<br/>From Retrospective in a Box  Photograph: Donald Woodman</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Donald Woodman</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>And what did she think? \"It could have been an important book. Some of the issues she raises about how women view their bodies are important, and some of the fury about that comes out of shame. But it's not an important book because she completely avoided the subject of genital mutilation.\"</p> <p>Is she likely to return to the subject of the vagina herself? \"Probably not. I say this all the time. When I was young in the 70s, we cast the dialogue entirely around gender. We assumed all women were our friends and all men were our enemies. That was a completely erroneous assumption. It has to do with values, not gender. Some of the best feminists are men. Gender is part of a larger structure of oppression and injustice.\" A dry laugh. \"I guess you could say that my eyes were lifted from my vagina.\"</p> <p><em>Judy Chicago is at the Ben Uri Gallery (</em><a href=\"http://benuri.org.uk\" title=\"\"><em>benuri.org.uk</em></a><em>) in London from 14 November 2012 to 10 March 2013; at the Riflemaker in Soho (</em><a href=\"http://riflemaker.org\" title=\"\"><em>riflemaker.org</em></a><em>) from 13&#xa0;November to 22 December; and at Liverpool's The&#xa0;Black-E (</em><a href=\"http://theblack-e.co.uk\" title=\"\"><em>theblack-e.co.uk</em></a><em>) from 8-30 November</em></p>",
  "<p>It's 9am on a lovely autumn morning at Cern, the European Organisation for Nuclear Research, just outside Geneva. The sun shines on to an open vista of fields and mountains, glistens off nearby lakes. It's an ideal day for cycling, walking, picnicking; almost anything other than messing around with computers in the dark.</p> <p>I am standing in the dark, watching people mess around with computers. Scruffy young men take cables out of plastic carrier bags and plug them into the back of television screens. They connect up keyboards, slot in SD cards, bung long leads into USB jacks. Parcel tape is slathered over stray cords to stick them in place. Somehow, I thought that Cern, the closest thing to a Bond lab on the planet, would be more sophisticated than this.</p> <p>Still, it's not Cern that we're checking out. We're here for something far more basic, and even more exciting. Take a closer look.</p> <p>You will notice that near every terminal sits a small green circuit board. Slightly bigger than a credit card, with cables sprouting out of it like twisted limbs, it resembles a rectangular spider. In fact, it's a computer, busily driving and connecting all the disparate elements around it to create\u2026 well, whatever the geeks want it to. Say hello, ladies and gentle-nerds, to the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/raspberry-pi\" title=\"\">Raspberry Pi</a>.</p> <p>The Raspberry Pi is a robust, cheap (about \u00a325), low-powered programmable computer. It is a British invention that went on sale for the first time in February this year and has been a science sensation, the computing equivalent of tickets to Glastonbury or the Rolling Stones: everyone wants one, not just hardcore fans. Before it even launched, demand for the Pi outran supply, and the day the first 10,000 became available, the distributing websites all crashed. The first ever BBC online video of the RPi \u2013 a preview of it, before it went on sale \u2013 got more than 800,000 views in a matter of days. Since then, the RPi has shifted almost 500,000 units and is on target to top 1m by Christmas \u2013 topped up by purchasers from South America and China who haven't been put off by the import costs which turn the RPi from bargain to just cheapish. It's been used to take photographs of the Earth from near space and snaps of birds in back gardens. And it has united the science community, from primary school teachers to particle physicists, in joyous enthusiasm; mostly because they hope its price, size, software and sturdiness (you can shove it in your pocket without damaging it, supposedly) will make it appeal to kids, and thus lead children into computer programming.</p> <p>So let's see, shall we? From 9am until 5pm, an unremitting stream of young kids wander into the dim room at Cern, look around for a free monitor, and sit down in front of it. They spot a small cat in the right hand top corner of the screen. Someone \u2013 an adult, another child \u2013 tells them they can make the cat move if they program it to do so. And then the kids do so.</p> <p>Mickal, who's six, is as charming an advert for the RPi as you will ever meet. \"Watch the cat,\" he says. \"He can dance.\" He drags and drops commands across the screen. The cat walks and turns around in circles. Later, he shows me that he can switch some tiny lights on and off using the RPi. \"Press N and enter,\" he says. \"Now N, space and enter.\"</p> <p>Nancy, seven, is also enjoying herself. She's given the cat a friend, a horse who makes odd noises, gallops into walls and bounces back. \"We don't have a computer at school, except sometimes for maths. I don't play computer at home either. I like drawing. And I like this.\"</p> <p>Nearby, Thomas, seven, is having a go too. Is he enjoying himself? \"I like it a little bit,\" he says. \"It's fun, but sometimes when you get a bit stuck, it gets annoying, and you want to do something else.\" He looks a little wistfully at the door, and at the bright sunshine beyond.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398873310\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pixies/2012/11/2/1351876984854/Raspberry-Pi-001.jpg\" alt=\"Raspberry Pi\" width=\"220\" height=\"127\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Six-year-old Mickal and his father show Miranda Sawyer a few of the Raspberry Pi\u2019s tricks at the Cern programming event.

The <a href=\"http://www.raspberrypi.org/\" title=\"\">Raspberry Pi Foundation</a> is a charity whose sole aim is to promote the study of computer science in schools; the Raspberry Pi was born from that aim. If the foundation had been a business rather than a charity, the original six could have retired by now.</p> <p>The geek buzz around the RPi \u2013 let's not forget it's been around less than a year \u2013 has been phenomenal. Now there are events like the one at Cern held all over the place: Manchester, Machynlleth, Silicon Valley, Singapore. Called Raspberry jams (do you see?), and not officially endorsed by the foundation, they're essentially just local people getting together and sharing knowledge about the RPi. Here at Cern, on the Swiss-French border, organiser Dr William Bell is concerned with the lack of computer science in local schools (his kids attend a French primary which, at the moment, doesn't have a working computer for the children to use). Thus his jam involves teachers, kids and parents. Others have been more grown up, with lectures and demonstrations, people standing in front of large screens, making jokes in computer code.</p> <p>The jams are just one of the RPi-inspired offshoots that have sprung up since the launch. The point of the RPi is that, contrary to most of today's computers, it doesn't come bundled with everything you require. To make it work, you need a keyboard, a screen, an SD memory card, a vast array of cables\u2026 So RPi packages have become available, enabling you to buy all those accessories in one go. And if you don't want to program the operating system on to the memory card, there are pre-programmed ones available. If you don't like the idea of it knocking about without a case, several people have designed those.</p> <p>More interestingly, there are now add-on boards that expand the Pi's capabilities, to make it easier to use for physical computing and give it functions like driving motors, making lights flash, turning your Lego man into an actual moving robot. These include the Gertboard, designed by a member of the Raspberry Pi Foundation team (called Gert). And <a href=\"http://pi.cs.man.ac.uk/interface.htm\" title=\"\">Pi-Face</a>, which is similar, though slightly easier to use (no soldering required), and is the baby of Dr Andrew Robinson of Manchester University.</p> <p>Robinson, a friendly, funny man, tells me about the bird box some of his students have designed using an RPi and Pi-Face; the box has an infrared light beam, so the RPi knows when a bird is coming in and out and can activate a camera or send you a message. Robinson also uses his RPi outside work; at the moment he has one at the centre of a theatre show. The RPi syncs interactive projections with lighting and sound, which all respond to the movements of the dancers.</p> <p>What else? Manchester University is running the Great British Raspberry Pi Bake Off, a competition for kids to design an exciting use for the RPi; it's sending out RPis and Pi-Faces to the developing world, places like Bangalore and Kenya, where the RPi has caused a sensation but has been hard to come by. \"I don't think the Pi is going to change the world,\" says Robinson. \"But it has opened stuff up, and created an excitement around programming that I've never seen before.\"</p> <p>The creators of the RPi are of a generation that played <em>with</em>, rather than o<em>n</em>, computers. Their first consoles were BBC Micros, Commodore 64s, Spectrum ZXs: beige boxes with limited power that offered limited built-in entertainment. In order to really enjoy yourself, you had to tinker about with what your computer could do: change some of the coding and see what happened. If you could do that, you could bring that programming skill to any other computer. But once computers improved, became more powerful and better to play games on, they became harder to program. The tinkering aspect was lost, and this affected swaths of schoolchildren: they just didn't come into contact with programming, even though they had more access to computers, better games consoles, lessons in ICT.</p> <p>Eben Upton, a friendly, upbeat man (everyone involved with the RPi is friendly) is a designer of microchips for <a href=\"http://www.broadcom.com/\" title=\"\">Broadcom</a> and the main designer of the RPi. In the early- to mid-2000s, he was in charge of undergraduate admissions to computer science at Cambridge. He noticed a massive drop-off in the numbers and, especially, quality of undergraduates between 1996, when he graduated, and 2005.</p> <p>\"The students just couldn't program, and that's because they hadn't been in the presence of programmable hardware,\" he says. \"It's not so much an education as an environment thing. I was self-taught, so were all of my friends. But in the consumer device world we're in today, where the majority of devices are tablets and phones and set-top boxes and games consoles\u2026 these are all machines that you can use to consume, but most of them won't let you produce.\"</p> <p>Everyone I speak to about the RPi is insistent that anyone can code, whether or not you're good at maths. Bell, at Cern, says it's like messing around with a motorbike. \"You spend your time taking it apart, putting it back together. Only by doing that will you understand how the engine works.\"</p> <p>Upton defines programming as \"breaking problems down into manageable pieces\", and the RPi, when you boot it up, has a couple of programming languages already in place: Scratch, which is the basic one with the cat, and the more sophisticated Python, which, once you've mastered it, leads you to pretty much any programming language you want. \"The Pi isn't just a magic box that does stuff,\" says Eben. \"You can start Python, enter six letters and straight away, you're in a programming environment.\"</p> <p>All of which sounds terrific, and terrifically exciting. Modern kids love computers, so why wouldn't they love programming? Well\u2026 The most identifiable characteristic of the computing genius is that he (it's usually a he) is Other. In the new Bond film <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2012/oct/28/skyfall-james-bond-review\" title=\"\"><em>Skyfall</em></a>, Ben Wishaw's Q is as cute as can be, with his specs and wayward fringe, but he is, essentially, the lofty opposite of hero Bond. Q sits in a dark room looking at a screen; Bond runs around hitting people and snogging.</p> <p>This divide isn't new; it's in every school you go to. The nerds hang in the computer room during break time and make obscure jokes; the jocks run around hitting things and trying to chat up girls. There are other cliques \u2013 those who cluster in the art room, the alternative music crew \u2013 but it seems to me that, admirable though the foundation's intentions are, they'll find it hard to convince many teenagers that programming is for anyone other than geeks. Even if they do get RPis in there early.</p> <p>Eben admits that this is something he and his compadres think about a lot. He (and the rest of the foundation) is aware that, so far, about 80% of RPis have been sold \"to geeks like me\".</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398873311\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pixies/2012/11/2/1351876106322/Raspberry-Pi-011.jpg\" alt=\"Raspberry Pi\" width=\"220\" height=\"327\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Raspberry Pi was designed to be cheap enough that all youngsters might have a chance to learn programming. Photograph: Phil Fisk for the Observer</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Phil Fisk/Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\"We don't want to end up entrenching all the advantages that are already there,\" he says. \"There is a fixed-size pie \u2013 sorry, but it's the best word \u2013 which consists of white, male, middle-class people who are good at maths. Let's say that pie is divided up into particle physicists, investment bankers and computer scientists, which are all careers that are dominated by white, male, middle-class people who are good at maths. If you're not careful, then all you're doing is moving the dividers around that pie of people. What we need to do is expand the pie itself.\"</p> <p>In his day job, designing computer chips at Broadcom, Upton insists that he doesn't use a tremendous amount of maths: \"My job is more of a craft.\" And he thinks that emphasising the craft element of programming might help with that stubbornly non-expanding pie \u2013 particularly with girls. What the Raspberry Pi Foundation doesn't want to do is what he calls \"painting it pink\" \u2013 meaning trying to appeal to girls in a trivial way.</p> <p>There's another pie-growing aspect, he thinks, within the vast sector of teenage boys who love computer games. \"There are loads of boys between 12 and 16 who would love to step up to the next level and actually create their own games. But there's no obvious route, and I say that as someone who set up a computer games company straight out of university.\" Now, he would just tell such lads to go and get an RPi, play around with it for a couple of years and then take their portfolio to a games company.</p> <p>Another tricky thing about the Raspberry Pi is teaching. It has been pretty convincingly proven that the ICT classes of the 1990s did nothing much more than produce students who would make good secretaries; today's emphasis on online isn't useful either. (As Eben puts is: \"The not particularly helpful skill that students have has changed from being able to use PowerPoint to being able to build a website.\") But how can teachers teach students computer programming if they don't know how to do it themselves?</p> <p>\"It's ridiculous to ask teachers to teach stuff they don't feel confident about,\" agrees Eben. \"We need to make teachers feel comfortable.\" Yet, he admits, if teachers are trained to be great programmers, then they'll just leave teaching and go and earn loads more money. \"So we have to find a way to make this stuff deliverable by non-specialists.\" To this end, the foundation \u2013 along with many other associations, such as <a href=\"http://www.codeclub.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Code Club</a> \u2013 has been encouraging computer engineers to help enthusiastic teachers set up after-school&#xa0;clubs.</p> <p>And what about parents? I'm white, female, middle class and studied maths and further maths (not very well) at A-level: I wouldn't have a clue what to do if my kid came to me with a programming problem. Upton admits that here, too, the RPi isn't perfect, yet.</p> <p>\"At the moment, we can deliver a really satisfying educational experience in a supervised environment, say where an adult or older child who really knows about computing is looking over a young child who doesn't. The real challenge is delivering to people like you, people who aren't natural-born computer programmers who can answer every question a kid has without even thinking about it. The Pi has to work in a computer-phobic environment. I think it's doable. And it's absolutely key.\"</p> <p>The Raspberry Pi isn't perfect, but that's a decision made by its creators. As much as it can be, the RPi is open: its software is open, and so is its attitude \u2013 unlike, say the closed, smooth perfection of Apple. The RPi's creators welcome suggestions, and understand that this is a work in progress that can only be moved along by the contributions of other enthusiasts.\"</p> <p>Upton tells me to wait a few months before buying an RPi, because in that time, the foundation will overhaul the software that comes bundled with it, especially Scratch, so that it is faster and more stable. (They've already put more RAM into the RPi, increasing it to 512MB; and recently announced that every piece of RPi software is now open source, meaning unhidden and accessible.) Also \u2013 and this seems key to me \u2013 RPi will be bringing out teaching materials.</p> <p>In the end, though, you can lead kids to the RPi, but you can't make them all code. And that's fine. Because some will become obsessed. One of the many, many online videos on RPi was made by George, nine, who has a blog called <a href=\"http://talkietoaster.tumblr.com/\" title=\"\">My Journey With Java</a>. He made it in August and it shows him putting leads into his RPi and talking through what each one does. As he puts in the power cable, he breaks off a shiny silver part of the Pi. If George were my child, I'd hand him some Blu-Tak. George just tweets the video to the Pi Foundation and they get back to him and tell him what to do.</p>",
  "<p>Open your kitchen drawers and cupboards and the chances are that you will see there are a spectacular array of implements. Slicers, mashers, peelers, crushers and parers are only the start of it: there are also those cumbersome white elephants that once promised a healthy, more authentic culinary experience, such as the breadmaker, the juicer and the pasta maker.</p> <p>In her wonderful new book, food writer Bee Wilson unpacks the paraphernalia of the average kitchen and shows that at the heart of the batterie de cuisine there are few basic requirements. Fire, a pot and a knife are all that's needed to create food \u2013 a spoon will help with eating it.</p> <p>Divided into sections, the book examines these basic elements and others \u2013 among them \"measurement\", \"ice\" and \"grind\". Attached to each one is a short reflection on a single piece of cooking apparatus. But like all the best books on apparently simple everyday commodities, this is of course really a gripping story of millennia of human ingenuity. Over the centuries the need to eat has led us to develop an astonishing plethora of niche skills and equipment, has made of eating itself a highly sophisticated act of pleasure as well as survival.</p> <p>Each era brings its own fashion for now forgotten delicacies and the means to prepare and enjoy them. Current fads include freeze-drying and canisters of liquid nitrogen, but who now uses the marrow spoons and celery goblets of the fashionable Edwardian chef?</p> <p>Wilson shoots off down alleyways and unexpected tangents. She gives us disquisitions on the evolution of human teeth \u2013 how archaeological remains can tell us of the necessity of chewing for survival. The Chinese, we learn, chopped their food (having developed superior knife-making skills) well before humans in the west and consequently their jaws evolved the overbite so crucial to the intake of soft food nearly 1,000 years earlier.</p> <p>I had no idea it was as late as the Renaissance that eggs were discovered to be a raising agent. She examines the extraordinary transformations that raw ingredients make when they are combined with others, the effects of heat and cold, of beating, whisking and boiling. She looks at the thousands of years of pot development that has taken us from the crudest (but effective) clay to Teflon (easy to clean but not always so effective to cook in). The Icelandic tradition was to dangle ingredients in hot geysers; in Ireland and Polynesia they filled a hole in the ground with water and filled it with raw food and stones heated on a fire. The earliest recipes on record simply advised: \"Assemble all the ingredients in the pot\".</p> <p>Heat is the single vital component that transforms things you can eat into cooked food. Wilson takes us from the open fire, through the spit, the hearth, the clay oven and the range, to the modern stove. But she is right to point out that although an electric oven does the job well enough, a hob really should be gas fired \u2013 the ring of blue flame under a pan a reminder of the primal pleasures of cooking.</p> <p>Wilson writes: \"Our kitchens are filled with ghosts. You may not see them but you could not cook as you do without their ingenuity: those potters who first enabled us to boil and stew; the pioneers of gas and electric ovens; the scale-makers; the inventors of egg-beaters and peelers.\" The introduction of the fork, made for genteel spearing and nibbling, made the simple, unpretentious spoon look uncouth and&#xa0;sloppy. Clarence Birdseye, who commercialised the frozen meal, was inspired by what he observed of food preservation during his long winters in northern Canada working as a fur-trapper, to \"reproduce the Laborador winter in New England\". A section on grinding resistant ingredients to a palatable consistency, includes not only the pestle and mortar but the wonders of the food processor.</p> <p>Witty, scholarly, utterly absorbing and fired by infectious curiosity, <em>Consider the Fork</em> wears its impressive research lightly; Wilson has given us a long view on everyday life \u2013 the early experiments of our primitive ancestors cast a long and complex shadow over the meals we eat. As we kit out our kitchens with every conceivable culinary device, it's salutary to be reminded that behind the shining chrome and plastic, the elemental components of human eating are still a pot, a fire and a knife.</p>"
