[
  "<p>Sir Alex Ferguson is hopeful that Robin van Persie and Wayne Rooney will prove to be a great partnership after they combined on their first start together for both Manchester United goals to beat CFR Cluj 2-1 in the Champions League.</p> <p>United had fallen behind to a 14th-minute opener from Pantelis Kapetanos before Van Persie's equaliser looped off his shoulder from a Rooney free-kick just before the half-hour mark. The Dutchman's winner came four minutes into the second half when he deftly finished a clever Rooney ball over the top.</p> <p>The pair had waited more than six weeks to be named in the same side due to Rooney's injury lay-off and match fitness concerns. Asked if they could be a great partnership in the making, Ferguson said: \"It is difficult to say. I hope so. That was always going to be an issue. Everyone thought it was going to be a miracle combination.</p> <p>\"The best thing about them is they can both turn a game and that's an important feature of them both. It doesn't matter if they have a personal combination with each other, it's their ability to finish moves off whether it's from [Tom] Cleverley, Nani or [Antonio] Valencia. With the players we've got in the forward positions we've got a good bunch there. There are great combinations all over our side, the strength of our squad is in our attacking positions.\"</p> <p>Of Van Persie's second he added: \"The pass and the finish, both were equally as good. It was a fantastic finish but what a nice ball that Wayne has dropped in. I actually thought it was a bit too far but Robin did well to get on to it.\"</p> <p>Van Persie also praised Rooney's contribution for the winner. \"Everything starts with a good pass, so I have to thank Wayne for that. Not many players can make a pass like that. When it came to him I knew he could see that pass and give it the way I wanted it,\" he said. \"I think it is the first time we have started together, we were both really pleased with that. We did it together tonight.\"</p> <p>Asked if his second goal was the best of his nascent United career, Van Persie said: \"Maybe, I have to look at it again. It felt good.\"</p> <p>Rooney said: \"It was a nice goal by Robin, a nice finish. But it was tough tonight, a tough pitch. We had to fully concentrate on our passing and our first touch but thankfully we managed to hold on and get the win.\"</p> <p>The result was tempered by Jonny Evans having to be replaced late on. An ice pack was attached to the Irishman's leg due to a recurrence of the dead leg he suffered in the weekend's 3-2 home defeat by Tottenham Hotspur. If Evans cannot recover for Sunday's trip to Newcastle United, then Ferguson will have only Rio Ferdinand of his recognised central defenders available.</p> <p>Ferguson said of Evans: \"He got injured on Saturday with a dead leg. He's got five days now to recover for Sunday and hopefully he'll be OK.\"</p> <p>The manager was unhappy with how his side conceded the goal to Cluj. He told ITV at half-time: \"We are doing most things correct in terms of passing but losing that goal the way we did is a shocker. An absolute shocker.</p> <p>\"In general I thought our possession of the ball was good and you have to be that way in Europe. When you give it away it's harder to get it back. But I was pleased with that part.\"</p>",
  "<!-- Block 1 --> <p><strong>Preamble:</strong> Brothers and sisters, we are gathered here tonight to celebrate this thing called CFR Cluj v Manchester United in the Champions League. It's the second Group H game for each side and both can consider themselves lucky to have three points on the board in the wake of less than impressive openers. </p> <p>While they'll happily take it, only the most blinkered United fan would claim their side's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/sep/19/champions-league-manchester-united-galatasaray\">win against Galatasaray at Old Trafford</a> was not mired in good fortune. The Turkish side will remain mystified by the referee's decision not to award them a penalty for Nemanja Vidic's blatant foul on Umut Bulut in a match that will otherwise be remembered for <a href=\"http://www.101greatgoals.com/gvideos/michael-carrick-manchester-united-v-galatasaray/\">Michael Carrick's composure</a> in front of goal, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFmTs4puoSc\">Nani's lack of it</a> and the welcome return to action from illness of Darren Fletcher.</p> <p>Boasting considerably less Champions League pedigree than their visitors tonight, Romanian champions CFR Cluj got their campaign off to a winning start with a heroic <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/sep/19/braga-cfr-cluj-champions-league\">2-0 away win over FC Braga</a>. Brazilian midfielder Rafael Bastos availed of his counter-attacking side's only two shots on goal to bag a brace against his former club. They'd probably gnaw your hand off if you offered them a point in the DR Constantin Radulescu Stadium tonight, but are an outside bet to get one.</p> <!-- Block 2 --> <p><strong>CFR who?</strong> You may not know a great deal about them, but <a href=\"http://www.cfr1907.ro/en/\">CFR Cluj</a> are no <a href=\"http://www.felingwmpottery.co.uk/Mugs/mugs-grp.jpg\">mugs</a>. They've won their last five Champions League matches (including qualifiers), but have been less than impressive on the home front and are currently lying sixth in <a href=\"http://uk.soccerway.com/national/romania/liga-i/20122013/regular-season/\">the Romanian top flight</a>, nine points off the pace being set by Steaua Bucharest after 10 games. Even though they hammered Gloria Bistrita 5-1 at the weekend, it would be a big surprise if they were to nick even one point from tonight's match.</p> <!-- Block 3 --> <p><strong>The Cluj manager speaks:</strong> CFR have a few players with experience in the Champions League and we have the whole of Romania behind us,\" said Cluj manager Ioan Andone in the build-up to this evening's fixture.\" I hope our enthusiasm will make a difference. If we manage to score, we will have a chance. I don't think you can speak about fear against United. If we won it would bring prestige and six points in the group, which is very important. It would be huge for Cluj and Transylvania too.\"</p> <p><strong>The Manchester United manager speaks:</strong> \"I watched the games against Basel and Braga and I would pick out Rafael Bastos [as the main threat],\" said Sir Alex Ferguson in his pre-match presser. \"CFR are a team who defend quickly and get plenty of bodies behind the ball. Their main strength is the counter-attack, as they showed against Braga. Counter-attacking is very important in European football these days. Their strongest point is they have got three points. They play us tomorrow and then two games against Galatasaray. They need secen more points from five games and they will qualify.\"</p> <!-- Block 4 --> <p><strong>Manchester United team news:</strong> Sir Alex Ferguson makes six changes from the team that was beaten by Spurs on Saturday. David De Gea is in goal, but the somewhat porous back four of Messrs Da Silva, Ferdinand, Evans and Evra remains intact. Anderson, Tom Cleverly and Darren Fletcher are named in a three-man midfield, while Wayne Rooney joins Robin van Persie and Javier Hernandez in a front three that could fill their boots against a side that's conceded in 10 of their last 12 games.</p> <!-- Block 5 --> <p><strong>CFR Cluj-Napoca:</strong> Mario Felgueiras, Sepsi, Cadu, Rada,<br>Ivo Pinto, Sougou, Aguirregaray, Muresan, Camora, Bastos, Kapetanos. <br><strong>Subs:</strong> Stancioiu, Diogo Valente, Nicoara, Maftei, Piccolo, Bjelanovic, Luis Alberto.</p> <p><strong>Manchester United:</strong> De Gea, Da Silva, Ferdinand, Evans, Evra, Cleverley, Anderson, Fletcher, Rooney, Hernandez, van Persie. <br><strong>Subs:</strong> Lindegaard, Nani, Welbeck, Powell, Kagawa, Buttner, Wootton.</p> <p><strong>Referee:</strong> Alberto Undiano Mallenco (Spain)</p> <!-- Block 6 --> <p><strong>Interesting trivia (depending on your point of view):</strong> There are 13 different nationalities represented in tonight's starting 22: Brazil, England, France, Greece, Mexico, the Netherlands, Northern Ireland, Portugal, Romania, Scotland, Senegal, Spain and Uruguay. </p> <p>Manchester United field one Spaniard, two Brazilians, three Englishmen, a Frenchman, a Scot, a Mexican, a Dutchman and a Norn Ironer. CFR Cluj's line-up comprises four Portuguese, three Romanians, a Uruguayan, a Senegalese, a Greek and a Brazilian.</p> <!-- Block 7 --> <p><strong>An amusing start to the evening:</strong> This match is being broadcast on ITV and presenter Adrian Chiles and his analysts Gareth Southgate and Lee Dixon are standing pitchside. As they discussed the line-ups, somebody had the bright idea of the turning on the pitch sprinklers behind them. Sadly, they appeared to be standing <em>this much</em> out of range and managed to avoid a proper soaking, although they did get liberally sprayed.</p> <!-- Block 8 --> <p><strong>Some reader emails: </strong> \"Alphabetised countries - the true sign of the obsessive,\" writes John out in China. \"Fine work, sir.\"</p> <p>\"Some interesting points in your preamble, but I can't help feeling you're missing the truly important information,\" writes Matt Dony. \"Exactly what <em>did</em> Fergie make of the Ryder Cup win?\"</p> <p>\"Not to be stereotypical, but given that one of the greatest Romanian exports is <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Count_von_Count\">this fellow</a>, is anyone else hoping that the stadium announcer takes tonight's attendance manually and says 'A ha-ha!' after each number?\" asks Ryan Dunne.</p> <!-- Block 9 --> <p><strong>Click-clack! Click-clack! Click-clack!</strong> The teams emerge from the tunnel and ITV immediately cut to an advert break.</p> <!-- Block 10 --> <p><strong>1 min:</strong> Manchester United kick off playing from right to left and with their players wearing white shirts, shorts and socks. Cluj's player's wear burgundy coloured shirts with white triangles under the arms, burgundy shorts and burgundy socks.</p> <!-- Block 11 --> <p><strong>2 min:</strong> Manchester United concede the first corner of the match and Rafael Bastos prepares to swing it in from the left. His delivery to the near post is excellent and Modou Sougou leaps highest to send a header flashing wide of the far post off Darren Fletcher.</p> <!-- Block 12 --> <p><strong>3 min:</strong> Bastos takes the second corner and sends this one towards the far post in a bid to pick out the centre-half Cadu. He does exactly that, but the ball's a mite too high for the Portuguese defender and he sends it high and wide under pressure from Rio Ferdinand.</p> <!-- Block 13 --> <p><strong>6 min:</strong> Manchester United ping the ball around the edge of the final third trying to find an opening past the 10 men CFR Cluj have behind the ball. A rogue pass gifts possession to the home side and they attempt to attack on the break.</p> <!-- Block 14 --> <p><strong>8 min:</strong> I can see a theme developing here. As expected, CFR Cluj have dug in on the edge of their own penalty area and are showing no inclination to take the match to Manchester United. It's fairly understandable, considering their success against Braga, when they won 2-0 after having two shots on goal compared to their opponents' 38.</p> <!-- Block 15 --> <p><strong>12 min:</strong> Modou Sougou, who wears the No99 on his back, has gone down injured inside his own half after coming out second best from a challenge with Anderson. Apart from the two corners, that's been the highlight of the opening 10 minutes.</p> <!-- Block 16 --> <p><strong>GOAL! CFR Cluj 1-0 Manchester United (Kapetanos 13)</strong> Manchester United go behind to asn early goal once again. From inside his own half, Rafael Bastos picks out Sougou on the right flank with a marvellous long diagonal pass. With Patrice Evra nowehre near him, the right-winger crosses low and hard into the centre, where the unmarked Antelis Kapeanos sweeps the ball into the bottom left-hand corner from eight yards or so.</p> <!-- Block 17 --> <p><strong>15 min:</strong> United's defence pick up where they left off on Saturday, standing off an opposition striker and allowing him too much time when they should have closed him down. Alone and without help in front of Evans and Ferdinand, Kapetanos was given far too much time on the ball before scoring. The only resistance he met was a lazy leg waved in his general direction by Evans when he was unleashing his shot past De Gea.</p> <!-- Block 18 --> <p><strong>18 min:</strong> Fletcher and Rooney combine well on the edge of the Cluj penalty area and the latter fires off a shot from just outside the D. Goalkeeper Mario Felgueras puts it out for a corner, from which Manchester United win another one.</p> <!-- Block 19 --> <p><strong>19 min:</strong> From the second corner, the ball breaks to Hernandez in the Cluj penalty area with his back to goal. He plays it back to Anderson, who tries to pick his spot and side-foots the ball a couple of feet past the left upright.</p> <!-- Block 20 --> <p><strong>21 min:</strong> Another enterprising attack down the right flank from CFR Cluj, with defensive midfielder Matias Aguirregaray picking out Sougou with a long pass. The winger is unable to keep his footing and slips, allowing Manchester United to clear.</p> <!-- Block 21 --> <p><strong>23 min:</strong> United attack down the centre, with Tom Cleverley picking out Robin van Persie with a first-time ball that takes four defenders out of the equation. With his first touch, Van Persie sends the ball skidding not too far wide of the left upright.</p> <!-- Block 22 --> <p><strong>25 min:</strong> CFR Cluj substitution: Modou Sougou off, Luis Alberto on. The provider for the opening goal is forced off with an injury sustained in a collision with Anderson some minutes ago. \"I don't think Patrice Evra will be shedding any tears to see the back of him,\" says Andy Townsend on ITV.</p> <!-- Block 23 --> <p><strong>26 min:</strong> More patient build-up play from Manchester United's players as they try in vain to find a way through the packed Cluj defence. Nobody could mistake them for Barcelona as it all looks a bit slow and ponderous. The home fans are whistling relentlessly, presumably in a bid to get the referee to blow for half-time a bit early.</p> <!-- Block 24 --> <p><strong>GOAL! CFR Cluj 1-1 Manchester United (Van Persie 29):</strong> Manchester United win a free-kick on the left flank, which Wayne Rooney whips into the penalty area. Standing unmarked, Robin van Persie leaps and misses the ball with his head, but gets a lucky break when it hits his shoulder, loops over the goalkeeper and drops under the crossbar and into the back of the goal.</p> <!-- Block 25 --> <p><strong>32 min:</strong> Good play again from Cleverley, who picks out Javier Hernandez on the edge of the penalty area. The Mexican unleashes a snap-shot that's on target, but not hit with enough venom to trouble Mario Felgueiras in the Cluj goal.</p> <!-- Block 26 --> <p><strong>34 min:</strong> Possession stats: CFR Cluj 30%-70% Manchester United. Cluj get the ball out of their own half and it's whipped into the Manchester United penalty area from the left. Pantelis Kapetanos is the only player within 30 yards of it, but it doesn't go anywhere near him.</p> <!-- Block 27 --> <p><strong>35 min:</strong> Hernandez dinks the ball between centre-back and right-back for Robin van Persie to chase and the Dutchman shjoots low and diagonally from left to right. Goalkeeper Felgueiras stays on his feet and blocks the shot.</p> <!-- Block 28 --> <p><strong>37 min:</strong> Darren Fletcher links up with Cleverley and Anderson before sending a cross to the far post towards Van Persie. Cluj right back Ivo Pinto heads clear.</p> <!-- Block 29 --> <p><strong>39 min:</strong> \"I think Andy Townsend may have spoken too confidently re Evra (25 min),\" writes Hugh Collins. \"If Celtic can win an away game in the Champion's League, then I wouldn't be that surprised to see an adult defender reduced to tears by the sight of an opponent's back.\"</p> <!-- Block 30 --> <p><strong>42 min:</strong> Manchester United win a corner off Ivo Pinto and Wayne Rooney sends it towards Robin van Persie at the far post. He's beaten in the air and CFR Cluj embark on another of their trademark counter-attacks, only for Gabriel Muresan to to drag a shot wide of David De Gea's goal.</p> <!-- Block 31 --> <p><strong>43 min:</strong> Another United chance, but by no means a gilt-edge one. Rafael crosses to the edge of the penalty area, where Wayne Rooney is forced to lean backwards before directing a weak header harmlessly wide.</p> <!-- Block 32 --> <p><strong>45 min:</strong> It's half-time. After falling behind once again, Manchester United go in all square at half-time courtesy of a Robin van Persie fluke. They've been vastly superior to CFR Cluj, but have looked anything but clinical up front or at the back. Elsewhere in this group, Portuguese side Braga lead Galatasaray 1-0.</p> <!-- Block 33 --> <p><strong>Random half-time observations</strong> </p> <p>\u2022 Wayne Rooney still looks to be carrying a bit too much timber; or at least looks very, very laboured. He's <em>pouring</em> with sweat compared to the other players, but then he has been out for a while. <br>\u2022 All Manchester United's chances have been created through the middle of the poitch, which is unsurprising considering they're playing without any wingers.<br>\u2022 Manchester United need to bring on a winger.<br>\u2022 Manchester United's defending for the goal they conceded was hideously bad. Evra was caught hopelessly out of position, which allowed Cluj winger Sougou to cross.<br>\u2022 When the cross went into the penalty area, Kapetanos got the better of both Evans and Ferdinand, when they should have been able to deal with him comfortably.</p> <!-- Block 34 --> <p><strong>Alex Ferguson's half-time interview:</strong> \"Our passing and intensity of possession has been good, but losing that goal the way we did was a shocker ... an absolute shocker. The way they play everyone is behind the ball, so it's going to be difficult to get width. They're just sitting in there and hoping we make mistakes.\"</p> <!-- Block 35 --> <p><strong>Second half:</strong> No changes on either side as the home team kicks off. If you haven't l;istened to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/audio/2012/oct/01/1\">this Monday's Football Weekly podcast</a> yet, then shame on you. It was presented by Soccer Am's Max Rushden, who left the studio to hop on a train to Manchester, from where he was flying to Cluj to support the Romanian champions in this match.</p> <!-- Block 36 --> <p><strong>47 min:</strong> Wayne Rooney tries his luck with a long-range effort which the goalkeeper puts out for a corner from which nothing comes.</p> <!-- Block 37 --> <p><strong>GOAL! CFR Cluj 1-2 Manchester United (Van Persie 48)</strong> Great goal from Manchester United, which has its origins on the right flank. With the ball at his feet and lots of time on his hands, Wayne Rooney looks up and sends a splendid diagonal pass up and under into the corridor of uncertainty between goalkeeper and back four for Robin van Persie to chase. The Dutchman beats the dithering goalkeeper to the dropping ball, cocks his left leg like a dog taking a pee on a lamp-post and dinks it into the bottom left-hand corner.</p> <!-- Block 38 --> <p><strong>53 min:</strong> Another lapse in concentration by Manchester United's defenders almost lets Kapetanos in for a second. Muresan squares the ball low and hard from the right and, with Evans and Ferdinand standing off him again, the Cluj striker has all the time in the world to slash it high over the crossbar. If he'd hit the target there, who knows what might have happened?</p> <!-- Block 39 --> <p><strong>55 min:</strong> \"While we're on the subject of random observations, did you know that basic gingerbread is a mixture of flour, brown sugar, golden syrup and cinnamon?\" asks Simon McMahon. \"And that Grasmere in Cumbria is considered the home of gingerbread? Yes, I'm having to watch the great British Bake-Off and follow the footie on the minute-by-minute.\"</p> <!-- Block 40 --> <p><strong>56 min:</strong> If Manchester United's players are trying to wind up their manager and ensure a long, fraught trip home from Romania, they're doing a very good job. Cluj win a corner, the ball's sent in from the right and Cadu rises completely unmarked at the back post to send a bullet header flashing wide of the left upright. He runs back into position with his head in his hands, berating himself for not doing better.</p> <!-- Block 41 --> <p><strong>59 min:</strong> United earn some respite after a five-minute period of sustained Cluj pressure, when Rafael Da Silva wins a free-kick wide on the right flank from his namesake Rafael Bastos in the Cluj side.</p> <!-- Block 42 --> <p><strong>59 min:</strong> From the edge of the final third, Matias Aguirregaray tries to play Pantelis Kapetanos through for a one-on-one with De Gea with a stabbed pass along the deck for the striker to chase. Rio Ferdinand makes a crucial interception.</p> <!-- Block 43 --> <p><strong>60 min:</strong> CFR Cluj substitution: Goalscorer Kapetanos off, to be replaced by Croatian one-cap wonder Sasa Bjelanovic.</p> <!-- Block 44 --> <p><strong>64 min:</strong> Decent enough play from United, who carve Cluj open down the right flank, before Anderson squanders possession by sending a deep looping cross way too near the goalkeeper.</p> <!-- Block 45 --> <p><strong>65 min:</strong> Cleverly tries to play Javier Hernandez through on goal with a ball through a gap between two players in the Cluj defence, but the Little Pea is flagged for offside.</p> <!-- Block 46 --> <p><strong>68 min:</strong> With nothing else going on, fancy getting strafed with my stat gun? It's not as unpleasant as it sounds. Passes completed: Cluj 152-473 Manchester United.</p> <!-- Block 47 --> <p><strong>70 min:</strong> Excellent play by Manchester United, with Rooney linking up beautifully with Tom Cleverley down the inside left. The midfielder plays a weighted pass along the deck for Rooney to pull back towards Van Persie, who stretches out a leg and misses making contact by <em>this</em> much.</p> <p>\"Shouldn't basic gingerbread contain ginger?\" asks Daniel Stauss in response to Simon McMahon (55 mins). \"Isn't that the whole point of gingerbread? If you type the word ginger enough times, your fingers lose all sense of feeling.\"</p> <!-- Block 48 --> <p><strong>74 min:</strong> Evra goes to ground in the Cluj penalty area while trying to get on the end of a pull-back from Robin van Persie. The referee gestures to the Frenchman to get to his feet. While I can't be certain it shouldn't have been a spot-kick without seeing a replay, it didn't look like one on first viewing.</p> <!-- Block 49 --> <p><strong>76 min:</strong> After coming in from the left flank, Hernandez plays the ball out of the penalty area to Rooney, who tries to pick out Robin van Persie with a dinked ball over the top. There isn't quite enough weight on his pass and Cluj clear.</p> <!-- Block 50 --> <p><strong>78 min:</strong> Pass. Probe. Pass. Pass. Pass. Pass. Probe. Lay off. Pass. Pass. Probe. Lay off. Pass. Probe. Clatter. Peep! Free-kick.</p> <!-- Block 51 --> <p><strong>79 min:</strong> Having made his debut for Manchester United in the Capital One Cup against Newcastle last week, Scott Wootton now makes his Champions League bow. The 21-year-old from Birkenhead replaces Jonny Evans, who has been nursing a dead leg all evening.</p> <!-- Block 52 --> <p><strong>80 min:</strong> Cluj substitution: Matias Agiurregaray off, 24-year-old left-footed midfielder Viorel Nicoara on. He's not from Birkenhead.</p> <!-- Block 53 --> <p><strong>83 min:</strong> Manchester United substitution: Little Pea off, Danny Welbeck on.</p> <!-- Block 54 --> <p><strong>84 min:</strong> With just seven minutes to go, this match is being played at a very pedestrian pace. Manchester United are looking very comfortable in possession, but are just one gaffe or long-range howitzer away from having to share the points here. That would be calamitous, despite them have been drawn in a group that looked even easier than the one they usually get.</p> <!-- Block 55 --> <p><strong>85 min:</strong> I've been very impressed with Tom Cleverley tonight. His performance was no-frills and efficient, while his movement has been good and his short passing has been very neat and effective. Rio Ferdinand gets booked for a high challenge on Rafael Bastos, who he hoofs in the stomach as the pair contest a 50-50 ball.</p> <!-- Block 56 --> <p><strong>88 min:</strong> David De Gea wins a free-kick after being clattered by Sasa Bjelanovic with a late challenge as he plucked the ball from the sky. He did well to hold on to that ball despite the mid-air collision. Remember the amount of abuse and ridicule he was subjected to by assorted armchair goalkeeping experts, who were very quick to write off a 21-year-old off because he occasionally looked dodgy under a high ball? I do. </p> <!-- Block 57 --> <p><strong>90 min:</strong> Manchester United win a throw-in deep in Cluj territory, but their hosts win possession back and launch another counter-attack. Ivo Pinto gets in a cross from the right and David De Gea saves brilliantly from a Rafael Bastos bullet-header after the Brazilian steals in unmarked at the near post. Corner for Cluj ...</p> <!-- Block 58 --> <p><strong>90+3 min:</strong> After his comments on Saturday, we can only presume that Sir Alex Ferguson is <em>delighted</em> with all this injury-time the referee is playing; Cluj are certainly trying to make the most of it. United fail to clear the corner properly, the ball falls kindly for Ionel Rada on the edge of the penalty area and he pulls the trigger only to see his effort blocked by a desperate Rafael lunge.</p> <!-- Block 59 --> <p><strong>Peep! Peep! Peeeeeeep!</strong> It's all over. Manchester United do just enough to hold on for the win against a very limited team who will consider themselves unlucky not to have stolen a point in the dying seconds of injury time. While Alex Ferguson will be relieved to get out of Romania with the win, must be seriously concerned with his side's many shortcomings in defence.</p> <!-- Block 60 --> <p><strong>On a far more important note:</strong> \"Daniel Stauss is probably right,\" writes Simon McMahon of the great ginger-free gingerbread debate. \"I think the ingredients I listed are those required for the basic dough to which the ginger is then added. It would certainly be a bit strange if ginger was absent from gingerbread. I wasn't really paying attention to be honest. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Hollywood\">Paul Hollywood</a> can rest easy.\"</p> <!-- Block 61 --> <p><strong>Elsewhere in Group H:</strong> Braga have beaten Galatasaray 2-0 in Istanbiul, which means Manchester United are top with six points from two games, Cluj and Braga next on three points each and Galatasaray are whipping them in on no points.</p>",
  "<p>For most analysts, the political regimes of Venezuela and Brazil are very different. Some governments, such as Barack Obama's, suggest the two regimes are opposites, even conflicting. But the solid alliance between the two countries, overlooked by the media, does not mesh with these simplistic analyses.</p> <p>The Venezulean government of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/29/chavez-revolutionary-fear-defeat\" title=\"\">Hugo Ch\u00e1vez</a> is accused of being populist and authoritarian, because the state plays a central role in the economy and society, and the regime of showing a dangerous tendency towards single-party politics that makes it very similar to that of Cuba.</p> <p>The Brazilian governments of <a href=\"Luiz In%C3%A1cio Lula da Silvhttp://www.theguardian.com/world/luiz-inacio-lula-da-silva\" title=\"\">Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva</a> (2003-10) and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/dilma-rousseff\" title=\"\">Dilma Rousseff</a>, on the other hand, support private companies and have a good relationship with the opposition, to the extent that half a dozen parties, ranging from communist to centre-right, make up the government led by the Workers party. The leading players in Brazilian media, such as <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rede_Globo\" title=\"\">Rede Globo</a>, do not mention the existence of censorship in the country.</p> <p>One of the main differences between the two countries is the relationship between the state and civil society. In Brazil, social movements such as <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landless_Workers%27_Movement\" title=\"\">Movimento dos Trabalhadores Sem Terra</a> (Landless Workers' Movement), arose against the state. In Venezuela, they were created to a great extent by the state after Ch\u00e1vez got to power.</p> <p>The conservative media consider Venezuela to be a potential danger for the security of the US and a threat to democracy and its neighbours. We should remember that the George W Bush administration assigned Brazil the role of \"moderating\" Venezuela's alleged radical impulses. What these analyses fail to explain is why two regimes that are meant to be opposites and incompatible with one another have established the most solid strategic alliance in the region, as solid or more so as that of Brazil and Argentina.</p> <p>After Lula's arrival in government, the quality of Brazil's relationship with Venezuela leapt. In 2003, the trade between the two countries amounted to $800m. By 2011, this figure had gone up to $5bn. The two countries tightened institutional links through consultancy on public policies and training courses for leaders provided by the prestigious Brazilian research centre Ipea (Institute of Applied Economic Research) and Embrapa (the Brazilian Agricultural Research Corporation), which opened offices in Caracas.</p> <p>In 2005, Lula and Ch\u00e1vez signed the Brazil-Venezuela strategic alliance and in 2007, they started holding quarterly presidential meetings \u2013 an unheard-of regularity \u2013 to accelerate the integration of infrastructure, which continued until 2010</p> <p>In May 2011, Ipea, which is dependent on Brazil's ministry of strategic affairs, published two important studies that highlight the progress made on integration, involving areas such as the road, river and air transport systems. A \"common economic area\" is being created, stretching from the north of Brazil to the south of Venezuela.</p> <p>Brazil contributes to the industrial development of Venezuela to help it reduce its dependency on oil exports and the import of 70% of all food consumed. Venezuela has started to supply industrial consumables to north Brazil, creating complementary industrial chains in the border area, in sectors such as the metal mechanics industry and agro-industry.</p> <p>Brazilians emphasise \"the quantity and quality\" of the region's resources. Venezuela has the <a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052702303795304576454251217542830.html\" title=\"\">largest oil reserves in the world</a>, having displaced Saudi Arabia, the third-largest bauxite reserves, the fourth-largest gold reserves, the sixth-largest natural gas reserves and the 10th-largest iron reserves. The Brazilian state of Roraima, on the border with Venezuela, holds the world's biggest reserves of gold, niobium and tin, in addition to important deposits of thorium, cobalt, molybdenum, diamonds and titanium.</p> <p>However, the main goals of Lula and Ch\u00e1vez were geopolitical. Samuel Pinheiro Guimar\u00e3es, the most influential diplomat in the Brazilian chancellery, explained that Brazil's strategy sought to prevent the \"removal\" of Ch\u00e1vez through a coup, to block the reincorporation of Venezuela into the North American economy, to extend Mercosur with the inclusion of Bolivia and Ecuador and to hinder the US project to consolidate the Pacific Alliance, which includes Chile, Colombia, Mexico and Peru.</p> <p>This high level of contact and co-operation shows that the analysts who believe these two nations represent opposites in their approach to the politics of the left are wrong. The friendly relations forged by Ch\u00e1vez and Lula have continued under Rousseff. They present a challenge to those seeking to undermine Venezuela by promoting a so-called \"Brazilian\" way: in fact the two models are closer than we are led to believe.</p>",
  "<p>The public editor of the New York Times has defended her refusal to stop using the term \"illegal immigrant\" against accusations that the term is inflammatory.</p> <p>After consulting widely in the wake of a speech made last month by journalist and activist Jose Antonio Vargas, in which he called on the Times and the Associated Press to stop using the term, Margaret Sullivan<a href=\"http://publiceditor.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/10/02/readers-wont-benefit-if-times-bans-the-term-illegal-immigrant/\"> said in a blogpost on Tuesday</a> that she thought banning it would not be helpful. She wrote:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It is clear and accurate; it gets its job done in two words that are easily understood.

Vargas, who declared his undocumented status in a powerful article in the New York Times in 2011, said in an email: \"Though I am glad a conversation about the imprecise and politicized term 'illegal immigrant' is happening in newsrooms, I am disappointed at Sullivan's defense. Describing immigrant as 'illegal,' as I've noted before, is imprecise, inaccurate and inflammatory.</p> <p>Vargas has also called out the Associated Press, whose style book is widely accepted as the standard for journalistic style in the US. </p> <p>The AP style book uses \"illegal immigrant\" but in an email to the Guardian the director of media relations Paul Colford said that its journalists use a range of terms.</p> <p>\"Though the term is in the AP style book because it reflects a legal reality, we believe there are alternatives,\" Colford wrote. \"AP reporters understand that it's not the only way to refer to individuals in a host of different circumstances.\" </p> <p>Some news organizations have adjusted their policy in the past decade to use the term undocumented immigrant instead, including the Huffington Post, the Miami Herald and the San Antonio Express News. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/mlcalderone/status/253157426050777089\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>FYI: HuffPost uses \"undocumented immigrant\" when referring to the person; \"illegal immigration\" referring to action.

  "<p>Mitt Romney will use Wednesday's presidential debate with Barack Obama to try to get across a clear, unequivocal message after weeks in which he has been accused of leaving voters confused by frequently chopping and changing.</p> <p>Romney, in an <a href=\"http://www.denverpost.com/nationalpolitics/ci_21676605/romney-wont-deport-young-illegals-who-have-temporary\">interview with the Denver Post</a> and at a late-night rally in Denver on Monday, offered a preview of his line of attack for the 90-minute debate. Central to his strategy will be to attempt to undo some of the damage caused by the secret video in which he dismissed 47% of Americans as freeloaders. </p> <p>He will list damning statistics showing the extent to which Americans have become dependent on the federal government, from food stamps to unemployment benefits.</p> <p>He will also attempt to work into the debate, even though it is supposed to be devoted exclusively to domestic policy, accusations that the White House obfuscated over the killing of US ambassador Chris Stevens and three other Americans in Benghazi, Libya.</p> <p>In a sign that Republicans have not yet given up on Romney with five weeks left to election day, one of the biggest of the conservative Super Pacs, American Crossroads, which is run by, among others, Bush's former adviser Karl Rove, announced Tuesday it had bought $16m in television and radio ads for a week-long blitz in the eight presidential swing states and in four Senate contests.</p> <p>If Crossroads had decided the election was now unwinnable, it would have shifted the bulk of the money to the Senate races. Instead, it is spending $11m on the presidential race and $5m on the Senate races.</p> <p>Romney's campaign team has been engaged for days over what strategy to pursue in the debate and in the weeks left to election day: whether to stick rigidly to the economy, as his main strategist Stuart Stevens advocates, or seek to exploit questions over Obama's handling of the Middle East.</p> <p>The internal debate remains unresolved, with campaign advisers briefing journalists that Romney is to adopt a scatter-gun approach in the coming weeks, tackling a range of issues across a broad spectrum. The Romney campaign has had three relaunches in as many weeks.</p> <p>In contrast with Obama, who is facing no criticism from Democrats over the way he is running his campaign, Republican politicians and conservative commentators have rounded on Romney for what they label a policy vacuum and sought to fill it with conflicting advice, ranging from offering specific policy points to switching to foreign policy.</p> <p>Ed Gillespie, one of Romney's campaign advisers, denied that the regular switches in messaging over the last few weeks reflected chaos and insisted it reflected the range of issues facing voters.</p> <p>In the Denver Post, Romney predicted that after the debate the lines between him and Obama would be clearer. \"I think what's going to happen in this debate is each of us will get the opportunity to describe our pathway forward for America. And for the last several weeks and months, the president has dramatically distorted my own views. I look forward to the debate so people will understand what I actually believe.\"</p> <p>The main line from Romney, according to his campaign advisers, will be that the last four years have been disastrous and that voters don't want another four years of the same.</p> <p>At the rally in Denver on Monday night, Romney rehearsed his response to the secret video, arguing that the 47% were dependent on federal aid because of Obama's policies. The Republican candidate ran through a series of statistics: the number of people on food stamps had risen by 15 million; one in six live in poverty; 23 million are looking for work; and for 43 straight months, unemployment has stood above 8%.</p> <p>\"The economy is not in recovery. We're not seeing a real recovery. The president's policies have not worked,\" he said.</p> <p>Conservatives hope that the election will eventually tighten and that the US media, keen to see a dramatic election finish, will jump on the slightest sign of recovery by Romney as a comeback. </p> <p>But the latest poll, from Quinnipiac University, shows no shift yet in Obama's lead, putting him at 49% to Romney's 45%. It records he has an 18% lead over Romney among women, 56% to 38%, and 94% to 2% among African Americans. Romney has a lead among men 52% to 42% while white voters back Romney 53% to 42%.</p>",

But one simple question remains: can Blaine die?</p> <p>\"I hope not,\" says the 39-year-old from New York, where <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/ultrabookexperience\" title=\"\">Electrified</a>, his latest piece of performance art, is staged. \"The dangers are the things you don't anticipate.\" Blaine has not performed a big stunt for more than three years \u2013 his last was clowning around with great white sharks in 2009 \u2013 because of his 20-month-old daughter. When his girlfriend, Alizee Guinochet, became pregnant, he postponed a gulf-stream-assisted voyage across the Atlantic in a bottle because it might take eight months. Surprisingly, he admits to being \"a little more cautious about the long-term effects\" of his stunts since becoming a father.</p> <p>While Blaine is protected by his suit, which conducts electricity, if he reaches through the open cage-style helmet around his head to scratch an itch, he will electrocute himself. \"It's only the equivalent to seven Tasers,\" says Blaine in a somnolent drawl. \"But it's continual \u2013 snap, snap, snap \u2013 and then you go into cardiac arrest. At the same time, I have a chance of surviving.\"</p> <p>If he is electrocuted, technicians will instantly shut down the tesla coils, which stream the electricity around him. Blaine is also supported by a pole so he won't be thrown by the charge on to the pavement below \u2013 another concession to fatherhood, he says.</p> <p>Despite the abusive interactivity of his previous stunts \u2013 crowds tormented him by dangling burgers before his glass box \u2013 he is a glutton for punishment. <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/ultrabookexperience\" title=\"\">Electrified</a> will be <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/electrified\" title=\"\">streamed live on YouTube</a> in partnership with Intel, and at pop-up locations in London, Beijing, Toyko and Sydney where \"fans\" can direct the metallic orbs shooting electricity around Blaine. So, basically, he is inviting trolls to torture him? \"I'm torturing myself,\" he says. \"In London I more or less provoked their interaction. This time, I'm forcing their interaction. They can shoot more electricity at me, they can turn it down, they can play music. The people being able to do all that is a nice distraction.\"</p> <p>His biggest fear is not malevolent internet crowds but hallucinating from sleeplessness, rubbing his eyes and giving himself a shock. He hopes his daughter in the crowds will help keep him alert. \"She's so smart, she comes to some of the rehearsals and she totally gets it,\" he says.</p> <p><em>\u2022</em> David Blaine's performance will be projected live at The Truman Brewery, London E1, from 7pm this Saturday; visitors will be able to control 1m volts of electricity and communicate with David Blaine from 9pm - 10pm.</p>",

And now, if I could give you only one word of advice, it would be this: relax. Don't think about the fact that Wednesday is unequivocally the most important night of your entire career \u2013 definitely don't think about that! Just slip into your jeans, crack open a cold one (caffeine-free Coke) and self-deport to your happy place. In Denver, I want to see the graceful, easeful, flowing Mitt. The Mitt who floats like a butterfly. Mitt the <em>dancer</em>.

No zinger six.

And if anyone's got the \"people skills\" to pull that off, it's you<br> S</p> <p>PS. Visualisation tip, based on a book I've been reading about public speaking: imagine that your whole audience is plutocrats at a fundraiser (so you feel comfortable) \u2013 but plutocrats who've just lost millions of dollars as a result of a failed private-equity deal (so you show empathy).

  "<p>Genius \u2013 right up there with billionaire \u2013 is one of only a couple of words that tells the world you're at the peak of your game. King of the hill, top of the heap. Plus, chances are, really, really brainy.</p> <p>And idiosyncratic. Possibly nerdy. Definitely dedicated. Sometimes creative. Occasionally no more than a nose to the grindstone worker bee.</p> <p>On Tuesday morning the John D and Catherine T MacArthur Foundation <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/news/nation/nationnow/la-na-nn-macarthur-genius-grants-20121002,0,27582.story\">announced its 2012 fellows.</a> The $500,000 spread over five years, widely known as \"genius grants\", are given to \"individuals who show exceptional creativity in their work and the prospect for still more in the future\". If you didn't win one this year, never mind. Here's how to improve your chances down the line.</p> <p><strong>1. Be American</strong> \u2013 or at least have a green card. The grants are only given to citizens or residents of the United States. But don't try to run the country. Although public service awards are frequently given, the MacArthurs have a thing against politicians and won't give a grant to those who hold \"elective office or advanced positions in government\".</p> <p><strong>2. Don't blow your own trumpet</strong> \u2013 even if you're a brilliant brass band player. The foundation won't take applications or unsolicited nominations. Instead, get to know someone in the foundation's \"constantly changing pool of invited external nominators\" and convince him or her of your talent. There are some clues how to go about finding these people in Who Are The Nominators? <a href=\"http://www.macfound.org/fellows-faq/\">here</a>.</p> <p><strong>3. In fact forget the trumpet altogether</strong> \u2013 be connected to a cooler instrument. This year's winners include the solo flutist Claire Chase, the mandolin player Chris Thile and stringed-instrument bow maker Beno\u00eet Rolland.</p> <p><strong>4. Be good at science.</strong> The largest group of recipients this year were in the sciences, with nine awards going to range of people from a pediatric neurosurgeon to a physicist/astronomer. Medicine was better represented than the environment. But this reflects the current focus of the country. In general if you want to do well as a scientist, go to medical school.</p> <p><strong>5. If you want to be a 'genius' journalist, don't blog</strong>. Sadly, short blasts of brilliance like this one are often overlooked in favor of the old-fashioned long-form pieces. Washington Post journalist David Finkel won his award for his \"finely honed methods of immersion reporting and empathy for often-overlooked lives yield stories that transform readers' understanding of the difficult subjects he depicts\". In addition, two grants went to documentarians Laura Poitras and Natalia Almada.</p> <p><strong>6. Photos are cool.</strong> I know \u2013 we're all photographers now with our cellphones and stuff. But if you want to win a MacArthur award you're going to have to push the boundary a little. The conceptual photographer Uta Barth won her award for photographing the same mundane objects in nondescript surroundings that we all do. Only she did it this way: \"By manipulating curtains in her home, she created lines and curves of light that expand from a sliver to a wide ribbon across a sequence of large-scale, dramatically cropped images that evoke the subtle passage of time while also highlighting the visceral and intellectual pleasures of seeing.\"</p> <p><strong>7. In the arts it doesn't hurt to be famous already</strong>. Anyone heard of Junot Diaz? Anna Deavere-Smith? Twyla Tharp? Susan Sontag? Julie Taymor? I rest my case.</p> <p><strong>8. It's OK to be a blacksmith.</strong> Or a farmer. I know they didn't win this year. But they have in the past.</p> <p><strong>9. Follow your high school passion. </strong>Many recipients \"work outside of conventional disciplinary categories\", say the MacArthurs. Over the years awards have been given for paper-making, gospel-music, sculpting, stage-lighting, poetry \u2013 all the things students love but tend to drop as their course loads become heavier. Stick at it people.</p> <p>You might not get the $500,000 but your life will be richer anyway.</p>",

It's all faraway vocals and spacious, elongated melodies. But there's something very special about the sky-scraping Ice Light, the duo's debut single. Built around their dual lead vocals, the song starts with a minimal drum beat and an undulating guitar figure before the first verse slowly careens into the gargantuan chorus, which arrives like an iceberg breaking through the fog. For the video \u2013 premiered here \u2013 the song's chilly atmospherics are anchored by the fact the band appear to be performing behind frosted glass and wafts of dry ice, as if ghosts. With just a handful of songs to their name \u2013 including a minimal reworking of Lauryn Hill's classic The Ex-Factor, which will be included on their forthcoming EP \u2013 the band have been busy working with Guillaume Briere from French disco patrons the Shoes and Sam Duckworth, aka Get Cape. Wear Cape. Fly, on their debut album. Keep an ear out for these two.</p> <p>\u2022 The Ice Light EP is released on 12 November.</p>",
  "<p>Mitt Romney has softened his position on immigration, promising for the first time to honour changes introduced in the summmer by Barack Obama that offer temporary visas to undocumented young people brought into the US by their parents.</p> <p>In an interview with the Denver Post before the first presidential debate in Colorado on Wednesday, he pledged that he would not revoke Obama's executive order and that undocumented young people who were brought to the US before their 16th birthday will not be deported.</p> <p>Romney has avoided answering the question of what he would do with Obama's order if he won the election, saying only that the issue had to be addressed by long-term reforms. His shift, on the eve of the debate and five weeks before the White House election, is aimed at cutting into Obama's commanding lead among Latino voters, who, though a minority, could tip the balance in some swing states.</p> <p>Romney told the paper: \"The people who have received the special visa that the president has put in place, which is a two-year visa, should expect that the visa would continue to be valid.\"</p> <p>He added: \"I'm not going to take something that they've purchased. Before those visas have expired we will have the full immigration reform plan that I've proposed.\"</p> <p>His change came the day before the first presidential debate, being held in Denver, and five weeks before the White House election.</p> <p>Romney took a hard line on illegal immigration during the Republican primaries and caucuses, saying he would pursue tough policies that would lead to \"self-deportation\". But he now faces electoral arithmetic that shows Latinos backing Obama by at least two to one \u2013 and that could make a difference in swing states such as Colorado, Nevada, Virginia and Florida.</p> <p>When Obama introduced the change in June with an order that bypassed Congress, Romney criticised the president for failing to go through the legislature. Faced with questions at the time about what he would do about the visas if he won the election, Romney opted for ambiguity, saying the order would be \"superseded\" by what he said would a comprehensive immigration reform package.</p> <p>There are an estimated 11 million or more undocumented migrants in the US, making immigration an emotive issue. Some diehard Republicans favour deporting those immigrants without papers, but Democrats, and some moderate Republicans, argue this is impractical and needs a more humane approach.</p> <p>Obama won the support of Latinos in the 2008 election, but disillusionment crept in with his failure to deliver on immigration reform combined with a continuing high number of deportations.</p> <p>In an interview last month with Spanish-language network Univision, he described the lack of immigration reform as the biggest failure of his first term. His order lifting the threat to undocumented children rallied Latinos behind him again.</p> <p>Romney and some of the other Republican presidential candidates alienated many Latinos during the primaries and caucuses with their anti-immigrant rhetoric. Only Newt Gingrich and Rick Perry took a different line. </p> <p>Since becoming the Republican presidential nominee, Romney has tentatively tried to woo Latinos, with a series of Spanish political broadcasts and appearances on Spanish-language TV stations.</p> <p>Romney had been working on an immigration reform plan with the Florida senator Marco Rubio, but abandoned it when Obama announced his order.</p> <p>In the Post interview, Romney said he would introduce immigration reform in his first year in office but did not go into specifics.</p> <p>\"I will propose a piece of legislation which will reform our immigration system to improve legal immigration so people don't have to hire lawyers to figure out how to get here legally,\" Romney said. \"The president promised in his first year \u2013 his highest priority\u2013 that he would reform immigration, and he didn't. And I will.\"</p> <p>As well as voting for the president in November, Colorado will also vote on whether to legalise marijuana, allowing people to possess small amounts for recreational purposes, the first state in the US to allow this. At present, it is available over the counter in the state for medicinal uses.</p> <p>The change is backed by some Republicans as well as Democrats.</p> <p>A recent poll showed 51% in favour of the change in law but Romney expressed his opposition.</p> <p>\"I oppose marijuana being used for recreational purposes and I believe the federal law should prohibit the recreational use of marijuana,\" he said.</p>",

It is up to them to think about where their skills and knowledge may offer the most in terms of exchange to the host institution while also giving the opportunity to work on their own professional development.</p> <p><strong>The self-directed nature of a PhD makes it harder to build in international mobility</strong>: There is more structured funding for undergrads simply because those are structured programmes so are easier to plan in advance whereas a PhD course is very much more individual and depends on your research ideas and your individual supervisor.</p> <p><strong>Be aware of cultural differences that could disadvantage your CV:</strong> One of the other aspects to consider when looking for research positions in other countries is the format and content required in your resume or CV depending on the country.

Health insurance and language courses queries are also high. The European Commission is trying to address these issues and has set up the <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/euraxess/\">Euraxess network</a>; a network of more than 200 centres across 40 European countries whose aim is to make it easier for researchers to move country.</p> <p><strong>Visa regulations shouldn\u2019t stop you:</strong> Sometimes it\u2019s a question about knowing which type of visa to apply for. For instance, if you wanted to come to the UK as a visiting academic for a short period of time, not as an employee, you could be able to get a visitors visa, without going through the points based system. See <a href=\"http://www.britishcouncil.org/new/euraxess/euraxess-living/euraxess-living-entry-regulations/\">here</a> for more information.</p> <p><strong>Different life stage, different problems - a women disproportionately disadvantaged?</strong> It gets harder to move as researchers get older and have partners and families to look after and move with them. I\u2019d be interested to know if this affects women more than men, and if so, whether this could be one of the reasons that there are less women in higher academic positions than men \u2013 if international mobility is associated with higher productivity then this could be a factor. At the moment only 13% of heads of HEIs in Europe are women, and only 12% of European Research Council advanced grants went to women in 2011 (encouragingly this is up from 9.4% in 2010).</p> <p><strong>Resources:</strong></p> <p>\u2022 Royal Society <a href=\"http://tiny.cc/9o58jw\">knowledge networks and nations report</a> shows that citations increase with numbers of international authors.</p> <p>\u2022 Research collaboration schemes can promote mobility without leading to brain drain.</p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.access4.eu/\">Access4EU website</a>, has detailed information on funding opportunities from 11 countries outside the EU (Australia, Brazil, US, China, Canada, India, Mexico, New Zealand, Russia, South Africa and South Korea)</p> <p>\u2022 Department of Business Innovation and Skills (BIS) report: <a href=\"http://tiny.cc/fm58jw\">International comparative performance of the UK research base - 2011</a></p> <h2><strong>Paul Spencer, researcher development manager, </strong><a href=\"http://www.uwe.ac.uk/graduateschool\"><strong>University of the West of England</strong></a><strong>, Bristol </strong></h2> <p><strong>Researchers should capitalise on what they are already good at \u2013 networking with peers:</strong> It is important for doctoral students to take advantage of any opportunity to present their work at international conferences, to make connections and collaborate. The good news is that there are an increasing number of digital tools that are making this aspect of things easier to do. Many universities will also support researchers to present work (as opposed to just attending) with some funds and most conference organisers have discounted schemes and/or bursaries available for doctoral students. This should be raised with the students the day they start a doctoral programme.</p> <p><strong>The length of doctoral study in the UK makes international experience difficult to get:</strong> Doctoral training in the UK is highly regarded by others but it is not without fault, in part as a consequence of the short timescale within which doctoral students are expected to complete. At doctoral level it is hard enough to get researchers to take a few days/weeks to engage in career development activity let alone engage in an exchange scheme. There is little time for doctoral students to gain exposure to other environments and that\u2019s a shame.</p> <h2><strong>Madeline Paterson, career transition coach, </strong><a href=\"http://www.symmetrycoaching.co.uk\"><strong>Symmetry Coaching</strong></a></h2> <p><strong>An online presence is valuable for a research career:</strong> Postdocs and early career researchers will benefit from developing an online profile that is distinct from their current employer. It does take an investment in time to create one\u2019s own \u2018personal learning environment\u2019 but networks such as <a href=\"http://www.linkedin.com\">LinkedIn</a>, <a href=\"http://www.researchgate.net\">ResearchGate</a> and <a href=\"http://academia.edu/\">Academia.edu</a> are ways to connect with international peers and boost your research profile.</p> <p>These days it is not just about who you know, it is about who knows you. We should all start by Googling ourselves and seeing what we are telling the world (or not) about what we do, what we are working on and what we are looking for right now. If an individual only shows up on their university\u2019s website and random publication references, they are missing a trick. I sometimes recommend buying one\u2019s own name domain (which is fairly low cost) in order to actively manage one\u2019s professional profile.

This is partly a result of an awareness of the globalised nature of academic research but also a product a kind of academic \u2018colonial cringe\u2019: \u201cOur universities aren\u2019t all that good, allegedly, so good doctoral students must prove themselves abroad\u201d. The problem with this practice is that good research students tend not to stay at home for their PhD degrees \u2013 which means the best students aren\u2019t working on research projects in their own countries. At the same time, universities benefit from the contacts and experience built up by returning academics.</p> <h2><strong>Lorraine Tracey, chair of the board of directors, </strong><a href=\"http://www.nationalpostdoc.org/\"><strong>National Postdoctoral Association</strong></a><strong> (NPA)</strong></h2> <p><strong>Getting away is not a high priority for lab researchers:</strong> I have seen it time and time again whether it be career development seminars or opportunities to get involved at their institution on committees, or travel to benefit their research, many lab researchers become entrenched in the 10000 experiments they have in mind and just simply don\u2019t see how doing anything else outside their own lab could benefit them. There is a constant pressure to get results and publish, and often the message coming down from supervisors is \u201cknuckle down and get on with it - forget these distractions and work hard\u201d. On the part of supervisors there is a perverse incentive to encourage graduate students or postdocs to just get on with their work \u2013 they need their students to publish and to push their work forward in order to continue obtaining grants and funding</p> <p><strong>Do not rely solely on the inward flow of international researcher:</strong> A global research community it needs to be a two-way street.

  "<!-- Block 1 --> <p><strong>Morning all</strong>. Australia have won the toss and will bowl first. They're unchanged, while Pakistan have brought in Abdul Razzaq in place of Yasir Arafat.</p> <p><strong>The clear-as-muddy-mud Group 2 Super Eight situation:</strong> Pakistan need to win. Probably. Australia have afford to lose. Maybe. In truth, only a hammering would put Australia's semi-final place in doubt, while Pakistan's situation is a little more complex: Mohammad Hafeez's side could win and go out or lose and go through.</p> <!-- Block 2 --> <p><strong>1st over: Pakistan 5-0 (Hafeez 4, Nazir 1)</strong> Xavier Doherty kicks things off on what has become an a surface that isn't just friendly to spin, but increasingly puts its arms around spin, gives it a huge bear hug then takes it off to the pub for a couple of pints and some Scampi Fries. Hafeez drives through the covers for a couple and there's nothing more spectacular than three scrappy singles to add other than that.</p> <!-- Block 3 --> <p><strong>WICKET! Hafeez lbw b Starc 4 (Pakistan: 5-1)</strong> It's Mitchell Starc and his lolloping left-arm pace from the other end and he's struck first ball. It's pitched up and swinging viciously towards leg. The Pakistan captain looks to whip it away but misses, gets wrapped on the pad and the finger goes up.</p> <!-- Block 4 --> <p><strong>2nd over: Pakistan 8-1 (Nazir 1, Jamshed 3)</strong> Jamshed should be gone second ball but he's horribly shelled at first slip by Maxwell after edging a full, wide one. That should have been 5-2, instead it's 8-1 after a very fine over from the left armer.</p> <!-- Block 5 --> <p><strong>3rd over: Pakistan 12-1 (Nazir 1, Jamshed 7)</strong> Shane Watson, increasingly looking to have added an armour-plating to his beefy frame, replaces Doherty and offers Jamshed the juiciest of full tosses. The batsman, unforgivably really, can only pick out the man at cover. Indeed Jamshed is looking about as comfortable as a mouse who has found his way into an owls-only nightclub - that's five dots in a row from Watson, the second of which was another ropey Jamshed edge that this time dropped well short of slip. Last ball he finally shows that he knows what he's doing with a bat in his hand, creaming an overpitched delivery away for four.</p> <!-- Block 6 --> <p><strong>4th over: Pakistan 15-1 (Nazir 3, Jamshed 8)</strong> Starc loops it about once more, varying his pace nicely, and (typically of left-armers in my experience) generally making himself a right pain in the backside to get off the square. Nazir is thwocked on the pad - the inside edge dons the cape and flies to the rescue to prevent an lbw, and the roles are reversed to stop the stumps clattering away. Another fine over.</p> <!-- Block 7 --> <p><strong>5th over: Pakistan 28-1 (Nazir 14, Jamshed 9)</strong> Imran Nazir finally finds the boundary as Cummins drifts to leg and three balls later he plays the shot of the day thus far, rocking back and carving the bowler through the covers for four of the best. Thirteen from the over.</p> <!-- Block 8 --> <p><strong>WICKET! Nazir 14 c Bailey b Watson (Pakistan 29-2)</strong> Yuk! Watson, having conceded just four from his opening over, swaps ends and again is on the money. Halfway through the over, he's reached seven dots from his nine ball, and from his 10th of the day he gets a wicket. It wasn't a wicket-ball, though - he's helped out by an ugly toe end from Nazir, who was looking to clip away to leg but ends up caught by the Australian captain at mid-off.</p> <!-- Block 9 --> <p><strong>6th over: Pakistan 31-2 (Jamshed 11, Kamran Akmal 1)</strong> Kamran Akmal gets off the mark immediately, but this match already has an ominous tone for Pakistan, particularly given the form of the Australian top order, who'll think nothing of chasing 140, 150.</p> <!-- Block 10 --> <p><strong>7th over: Pakistan 37-2 (Jamshed 14, Kamran Akmal 4)</strong> Glenn Maxwell arrives for his shift of occasional off-spin. Single, single, single, single, single \u2026 and, yep, a single. Australia will be happy enough with that.</p> <!-- Block 11 --> <p><strong>8th over: Pakistan 41-2 (Jamshed 16, Kamran Akmal 6)</strong> Pakistan need to turn the tide of this one and soon. Brad Hogg flops up a thigh-high full toss that Jamshed, still looking edgy and unsettled at the crease, can only tap away for one. That's been a big part of Pakistan's problem so far - Australia have bowled well, but even the bad balls haven't been punished adequately. Four from the over.</p> <!-- Block 12 --> <p><strong>9th over: Pakistan 49-2 (Jamshed 20, Kamran Akmal 10)</strong> \"I can't take a player named after a place to store a sweet sandwich filler seriously,\" chuckles Samuel Fox. \"Has there ever been a better named international cricketer?\" Well, Marmalade Greenhouse was a useful middle order batsman for England back in the 1910s*. Pakistan put a little fizz into proceedings with plenty of scurrying singles and doubles, but still not boundary and just eight from the over. </p> <p>* Marmalade Greenhouse was of course not a useful middle order batsman for England back in the 1910s. He was a rubbish No3.</p> <!-- Block 13 --> <p><strong>10th over: Pakistan 60-2 (Jamshed 25, Kamran Akmal 16)</strong> Akmal shows some intent by thumping Brad Hogg away for four wide of mid-off, the first boundary for four overs. Then a slice of luck - Jamshed pushes gently towards the mid-off boundary where Maxwell is jogging round to collect, but a huge bobble off the turf sends it over his hands and through his legs for four. Hogg responds by zipping one past the outside edge.</p> <!-- Block 14 --> <p><strong>11th over: Pakistan 70-2 (Jamshed 32, Kamran Akmal 19)</strong> Finally Jamshed gets his mojo working with a crunching smite for six off Cummins. That went flying into the (rather sparse) crowd at square leg. There's definitely a sense that Pakistan have decided it's time to go, though not other swipe finds the boundary rope or beyond. Still, 10 from the over.</p> <!-- Block 15 --> <p><strong>12th over: Pakistan 79-2 (Jamshed 41, Kamran Akmal 19)</strong> OOF! Jamshed has now deposited Doherty into the stands, with a stride down the wicket and a heave over the border between wide long on and cow corner. A lofted drive that drops short of mid off brings up the 50 partnership off 36 balls. It's a decent over other than that from Doherty, with just three more runs from the remaining five.</p> <!-- Block 16 --> <p><strong>13th over: Pakistan 89-2 (Jamshed 46, Kamran Akmal 23)</strong> Watson (2-0-7-1) returns and finds himself lofted back over his head by Jamshed. That was a glorious shot, straight as the line run by a hungry hedgehog heading towards a bowl of whatever hungry hedgehogs particularly like to eat. Ten from the over.</p> <!-- Block 17 --> <p><strong>14th over: Pakistan 103-2 (Jamshed 52, Kamran Akmal 31)</strong> Akmal sweeps Hogg hard for a single, Jamshed drives uppishly for likewise. These two, while they've given Pakistan a chance of setting something testing here, still haven't really looked comfortable. They've not dominated at all. A I type that, Jamshed plays a shot of some authority - a flat-batted drive past the bowler for four. And Akmal goes one, or in fact two, better, mooing the bowler away for six down at cow corner.</p> <!-- Block 18 --> <p><strong>WICKET! Jamshed c Warner b Doherty 55 (Pakistan 108-3)</strong> A forgettable innings pockmarked by a couple of glorious thwacks comes to an end. Jamshed misses a full toss, then connects with a drive only to send the ball sailing to the meaty palms of Warner at long on.</p> <!-- Block 19 --> <p><strong>15th over: Pakistan 108-3 (Kamran Akmal 32, Umar Akmal 0)</strong> Jamshed, having struck that shot, simply walked off, so it's the new batsman who faces the final ball of the over. It is, unsurprisingly, a dot.</p> <!-- Block 20 --> <p><strong>WICKET! Kamran Akmal c White b Starc 32 (Pakistan 108-4)</strong> Things are unravelling for Pakistan here as Akmal picks out the fielder with a low drive.</p> <!-- Block 21 --> <p><strong>16th over: Pakistan 114-4 (Umar Akmal 0, Abdul Razzaq 6)</strong> So Pakistan have to start again. Razzaq thunders a pull away for four second ball then drives Starc away for two more. It's tight stuff again from Starc though, who ends the over with figures of 3-0-12-2.</p> <!-- Block 22 --> <p><strong>17th over: Pakistan 123-4 (Umar Akmal 1, Abdul Razzaq 14)</strong> Umar Akmal tries his best to run out his partner, watching Razzaq charge halfway down the track and then sending him back. There probably wasn't a run there to be fair, and there definitely isn't next ball as Razzaq goes for the classic swipe, miss, charge-down-the-track-knowing-youre-completely-safe-but-well-the-other-bloke-might-be-in-bother. Akmal isn't having any of it, so from the final ball of the over Razzaq heaves Cummins away for a huge six.</p> <!-- Block 23 --> <p><strong>18th over: Pakistan 130-4 (Umar Akmal 4, Abdul Razzaq 17)</strong> In vaguely related news,<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/oct/02/pakistan-abdur-rehman-drugs-test\">Pakistan spinner Abdur Rehman has tested positive for recreational drug</a> while playing for Somerset. Over in Colombo, Pakistan could do with another 30 off these final three overs. Watson concedes just three from his first four balls as Razzaq looks for, and fails to find, a big hit. Then he blots his copybook by sending down a wide outside off stump. A top-edge from Razzaq drops safe, but they charge through for a couple and pick up another single from the final ball. Seven from the over</p> <!-- Block 24 --> <p><strong>WICKET! Razzaq c Watson b Cummins 22 (Pakistan 136-5)</strong> Cummins, who has probably been the weakest link in the Australian attack, returns for his final over. Razzaq breaks the shackles with flat drive over extra cover, the ball escaping George Bailey by little more than a yard, but then next up he's back in the hutch. An airy cut flies lazily to Watson out in the deep. A decent effort though \u2013 22 from 17 balls.</p> <!-- Block 25 --> <p><strong>19th over: Pakistan 140-5 (Umar Akmal 9, Shahid Afridi 0)</strong> Umar Akmal came to the crease in the 15th over. We're now in the middle of the 19th and he's faced only five balls - that tells you something about Pakistan's failure to rotate the strike (and also, I suppose, Akmal's failure to score anything other than singles). Finally he finds the boundary with a somewhat sliced cut, then he wafts hopelessly at the last.</p> <!-- Block 26 --> <p><strong>WICKET! Afridi b Starc 4 (Pakistan: 144-6)</strong> Mitchell Starc to Shahid Afridi, this should be fun \u2026 but we have to wait a moment as Akmal has backed up at full tilt and is almost at Afridi's side when Starc reaches the crease. That's ludicrous. Starc starts again, and Afridi wallops back over his head for four. Then he's clean bowled, leg stump cartwheeling away as the batsman looked to clip one away behind square. That was short and furious: Starc v Afridi, two balls, one four, one wicket.</p> <!-- Block 27 --> <p><strong>20th over: Pakistan 149-6 (Umar Akmal 10, Shoaib Malik 4)</strong> Losing Razzaq and Afridi in the space of five balls has probably scuppered a potential 160ish total. Starc jags in the yorkers. Pakistan dig and dab. Malik clips a couple away from the penultimate ball and can only mistime a swipe away for a single from the last.</p> <!-- Block 28 --> <p><strong>Pakistan: 149-6. Australia will require 150 for victory.</strong></p> <!-- Block 29 --> <p><strong>It's not enough, is it?</strong> Pakistan will look to strangle with spin, but it's hard to see Watson, Warner, Hussey or White getting themselves becalmed in the way that Pakistan were at various points during their innings. This is going to be a stroll for the Aussies.</p> <!-- Block 30 --> <p><strong>(Fate, consider yourself tempted \u2026)</strong></p> <!-- Block 31 --> <p><strong>1st over: Australia 7-0 (Watson 1, Warner 5)</strong> Australia, I'm reliably informed, need 112 to be certain of qualifying for the semi-finals. Hafeez, with perhaps the most scurrying run-up in cricket followed by one of the most staccato delivery strides, opts for himself to open the bowling. Watson baseball bats the second for a single, Warner clumps the third for four. Seven from the over all told.</p> <!-- Block 32 --> <p><strong>2nd over: Australia 11-0 (Watson 5, Warner 5)</strong> Raza Hasan, the impressive young left-arm spinner, starts his spell with three confidence-boosting dots to Watson. Make that four. This is good stuff from the 20-year-old. His fifth ball isn't a bad 'un either, but Watson somehow manages to create enough space to cut away for four. That was a quite sensational shot, one of a man in glorious form.</p> <!-- Block 33 --> <p><strong>3rd over: Australia 13-0 (Watson 7, Warner 6)</strong> Hafeez again and he offers Watson a leg-stump full toss, juicy as a freshly plucked plum. Watson's eyes light up like a fruit machine, but his pull his superbly stopped by the tumbling Shahid Afridi. Hafeez thwocks Warner on the pads with the last ball and roars an appeal. Not out says the umpire, very out indeed says Hawkeye. The ball would've smacked into leg stump. An early escape for Warner.</p> <!-- Block 34 --> <p><strong>WICKET! Watson lbw b Raza Hasan 8 (Australia 14-1)</strong> Watson fails! Seas boil! Horsemen ride! Warner escaped with one last over, but there's little doubt that this one is rattling into the stumps. It was an attempted slog-sweep and Watson was simply beaten by the spin.</p> <!-- Block 35 --> <p><strong>4th over: Australia 16-1 (Warner 7, Hussey 1)</strong> A tumbling stop by Umar Gul in the field denies Warner a boundary. Pakistan look properly up for this.</p> <!-- Block 36 --> <p><strong>WICKET! Warner lbw b Hafeez 8 (Australia 19-2)</strong> Well, well, well. Warner falls in similar fashion to Watson. He missed with a slog-sweep and was caught bang in front. What a start this is for Pakistan.</p> <!-- Block 37 --> <p><strong>5th over: Australia 19-2 (Hussey 3, Bailey 0)</strong> Warner had been picking out the fielders at the moment, while at the other end Hussey was shown him the way with three singles from three balls faced. That final slog was a failure on his part to adapt to the situation. So, the captain's in a lot earlier than he would have envisioned.</p> <!-- Block 38 --> <p><strong>6th over: Australia 21-2 (Hussey 4, Bailey 1)</strong> Saeed Ajmal into the attack and it <em>is</em> an attack. Pakistan are going for the jugular. Just two from the final over of the power play.</p> <!-- Block 39 --> <p><strong>7th over: Australia 29-2 (Hussey 6, Bailey 7)</strong> Here comes Boom Boom in Spin Spin mode. He's tight for the first couple of balls but then drifts too wide and Bailey finds the gap very neatly. Australia needed that boundary \u2013 remember there first target is 112. Pakistan, to give themselves a chance of reaching the semi-finals, at least need to avoid defeat inside the first 17.4 overs. \"Why?\" I hear you ask. Well, [INSERT COMPLEX RUN-RATE EXPLANATION HERE]</p> <!-- Block 40 --> <p><strong>8th over: Australia 34-2 (Hussey 10, Bailey 8)</strong> Here's Shoaib Malik. Pakistan have used five different bowlers thus far, all of them spinners. Hussey sweeps fine for a couple, but Malik keeps things tourniquet-tight. Five from the over.</p> <!-- Block 41 --> <p><strong>9th over: Australia 43-2 (Hussey 12, Bailey 15)</strong> Bailey is the latest to miss at a slog-sweep. Afridi watches his delivery zip just outside the off stump. Hussey is then beaten by a googly. Pakistan are bowling quite wonderfully. And Australia respond \u2013 that's a mighty blow from Bailey, blasted into the stands at midwicket for six.</p> <!-- Block 42 --> <p><strong>WICKET! Bailey lbw b Ajmal 15 (Australia 44-3)</strong> Kamran Akmal appeals like he's trapped his fingers in the car door as Ajmal thwacks Bailey on the pad. Nothing doing that time, but next up his yelps turn to cheers as the finger goes up. Bailey becomes the third Australian trapped lbw when trying to blast the ball over midwicket.</p> <!-- Block 43 --> <p><strong>10th over: Australia 45-3 (Hussey 13, White 1)</strong> Australia really haven't played this spin very smartly. \"Aussies playing spin like school boys,\" suggests Narayana Rao. I think it might be worse than that \u2013 they've played it in England-esque fashion. At the halfway point, then, Australia are in considerable trouble.</p> <!-- Block 44 --> <p><strong>11th over: Australia 48-3 (Hussey 13, White 3)</strong> \"So could this be 20 overs of slow bowling in an innings?\" notes Gary Naylor. \"All slow attacks are coming to T20 - that'll be a shame, as all forms of cricket need variety.\" Can't argue with that, but then neither you can't argue with Hafeez's thinking here. Raza Hasan returns. White attempts a Dilshan shovel-sweep, but can only flick the ball off his wrists and into his own chest. Kamran Akmal, who's been untypically inconspicuous behind the stumps, joins the party \u2013 Hussey attempts a reverse sweep, misses, Akmal misses with his gloves, gets whacked on the inside of the calf and goes hopping away in pain as the batsmen scurry a single.</p> <!-- Block 45 --> <p><strong>WICKET! White c Nazir b Hafeez 12 (Australia 58-4)</strong> The fightback was just beginning but that is another huge wicket. Hafeez offers White a full toss that he can only put away for two. A dot only adds to the pressure then White unfurls that slog-sweep that has been the downfall of all three batsmen thus far. White, though, connects with the middle of the meat of the middle and sends a glorious six flying away over midwicket. There's no such joy a couple of balls later \u2013 another great smite goes flying up into the Colombo sky and drops into the hands of Imran Nazir in the deep.</p> <!-- Block 46 --> <p><strong>12th over: Australia 58-4 (Hussey 13, Maxwell 0)</strong> And that's over. Eight overs to go, 54 runs needed in effect.</p> <!-- Block 47 --> <p><strong>13th over: Australia 63-4 (Hussey 16, Maxwell 3)</strong> Afridi goes rattling through another over, conceding just the five singles.</p> <!-- Block 48 --> <p><strong>WICKET! Maxwell c Hafeez b Hasan 4 (Australia 65-5)</strong> The run rate for victory is up over 12, but that is more relevant to Pakistan than it is to Australia really. The real required rate for the Aussies is seven, but even that is looking steep now. Maxwell flails Raza Hasan pretty hopelessly into the hands of Hafeez at point.</p> <!-- Block 49 --> <p><strong>14th over: Australia 68-5 (Hussey 18, Wade 2)</strong> Matt Wade comes in for his first knock of the tournament \u2013&#xa0;that's how dominant Australia have been until today. They're in huge trouble now. The 20-year-old Raza Hasan ends with figures of 4-0-14-2</p> <!-- Block 50 --> <p><strong>15th over: Australia 82-5 (Hussey 31, Wade 3)</strong> It really does look like we're going to have no pace bowling here at all. Umar Gul and Abdul Razzaq's job will simply be to chase the thing in the field. Shoaib Malik comes back in, an attempt to sneak a quiet over from the part-timer through while Australia are still reeling. He drops a touch short and Hussey pounces on it with steel-nerved intent. That's four and the very next ball goes the same way, but on this occasion into the stands for six.</p> <!-- Block 51 --> <p><strong>16th over: Australia 90-5 (Hussey 33, Wade 9)</strong> Australia are now within 30 runs of the semi-finals. This could end up being the worst possible result for India and South Africa. But this pair haven't given up on victory yet. Wade sweeps Ajmal away for four more.</p> <!-- Block 52 --> <p><strong>17th over: Australia 101-5 (Hussey 43, Wade 10)</strong> Afridi comes in for his final over. Hussey plants another boundary back over his head. Wonderful shot. Another loose ball down the leg side gets a clever little clip away for four more. This has been a superb innings from Mike Hussey.</p> <!-- Block 53 --> <p><strong>18th over: Australia 105-5 (Hussey 46, Wade 11)</strong> A change of pace at last. Umar Gul comes into the attack, but the change is really enforced by Shoaib Malik's vulnerability. He couldn't really bowl again to Hussey. So, Pakistan feel the need for speed. Gul beats Hussey first up, concedes a couple of singles, then beats Wade with a full delivery outside off. Fine bowling. Superb bowling, in fact. Just four from the over.</p> <!-- Block 54 --> <p><strong>WICKET! Wade b Ajmal 13 (Australia: 110-6)</strong> A Pakistan win puts South Africa out. Australia need seven to save themselves and 45 to save the Saffers. Just 12 balls remain. Saeed Ajmal returns for his final over. A doosra drifts down leg, Akmal and Ajmal appeal and the fingers go up \u2026 in fact the whole arms go up to indicate a wide. The bowler keeps the batsmen honest, but they're not looking to win this now. 112 is the only target they're interested in. And two runs short of that target they've lost another wicket \u2013&#xa0;Wade cleaned up by another Ajmal doosra.</p> <!-- Block 55 --> <p><strong>WICKET! Cummins lbw b Ajmal 0 (Australia: 110-7)</strong> Ooh, hello. Cummins is bamboozled by Ajmal. He'll be on a hat-trick in the semi-finals (or at his next Twenty20 international if they don't make it.</p> <!-- Block 56 --> <p><strong>19th over: Australia 110-7 (Hussey 46, Starc 0)</strong> That's over. Australia need two more to go through, but Hussey will be on strike.</p> <!-- Block 57 --> <p><strong>20th over: Australia 117-7 (Hussey 53, Starc 1)</strong> Hussey carves Gul's first ball away for four. Hussey celebrates his 50 and an innings that has almost single-handedly taken Australia through. It feels like they should pull the stumps up and troop off. But there's five not entirely irrelevant balls to go. The fewer runs Pakistan concede, the greater the margin of victory India will need against South Africa. In all they concede a further three, which they'll be happy enough with.</p> <!-- Block 58 --> <p><strong>Pakistan beat Australia by 32 runs</strong> Well played, Pakistan. Well bowled, at least. They'll now go through to the semi-finals if South Africa beat India or if India don't manage a pretty emphatic victory. Australia are through to the last four.</p>",
  "<p>And he's off. After spending more than half his life as a McLaren employee, Lewis Hamilton has announced he will walk away from his $22m a year contract in order to take up a $24m a year deal with Mercedes, where he will fill the seat of retiring geriatric great Michael Schumacher. \"I will be forever grateful for the opportunity McLaren gave me,\" Hamilton yawned, presumably while reclining on a gold-leaf chaise longue wearing a boiler suit woven entirely from high denomination bank notes. Mexican tyro Sergio P\u00e9rez has already signed up to replace him.</p> <h2><strong>England crash out of T20</strong></h2> <p>The ICC World Twenty20 continues to provide cut-price firework displays, oddly homemade-looking podium dancers and more rustic scythes than a Cotswold tourist pub \u2013 all without offering, as yet, any real clue as to who might win it. The notable exception to that rule being reigning champions England, who were dumped out of the tournament unceremoniously after defeats by West Indies and holders Sri Lanka.</p> <h2><strong>Another historic victory </strong></h2> <p>Football: never knowingly underblown. \"We wrote history for our team,\" was the verdict of skinny-tied touchline dreamboat Andre Villas-Boas after Tottenham's 3-2 win at Manchester United, a result that leaves his former club Chelsea three points clear at the top of the Premier League. In Italy Juventus continue to dazzle: a 4-1 cuffing aside of Roma means the league leaders are now 45 matches unbeaten in Serie A. And in La Liga, Barcelona remain practically perfect in every way after coming from two goals down to beat Sevilla 3-2 and maintain their 100% record.</p> <h2><strong>US sporting haplessness </strong></h2> <p>Meanwhile American sport continues to explore its own self-destructive take on industrial relations. Lockout #1 update: the NHL remains in chaos as players and owners negotiate the divvying up of their $3.3bn purse. The start of the regular season next week could yet be an ice hockey free zone. Lockout #2 update: referees in the NFL have finally agreed a new deal, ending a walkout most notable for the efforts of a bunch of enthusiastic but often spectacularly hapless amateur stand-in refs over the last three weeks. Which is, at the very least, an excellent idea for a sporting-comedy blockbuster, probably starring Will Ferrell.</p>",
  "<p>In-laws in films are generally used to comic effect. In the work of <a href=\"http://www.clarissehahn.com/\" title=\"\">Clarisse Hahn</a> they could form the basis for half a dozen tragedies and as many historical epics. The director's life-partner, Oktay Sengul (credited as assistant director), belongs to a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/kurds\" title=\"\">Kurdish</a> family from eastern <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/turkey\" title=\"\">Turkey</a>. His parents emigrated to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/france\" title=\"\">France</a> and regularly return with their children to the little town where the clan settled after its village was razed. In the course of various visits Hahn has built up a meticulous family portrait, betraying deep affection but also a form of lucid effrontery.</p> <p>Watching the great-grandmother in the first real sequence of <a href=\"http://en.unifrance.org/movie/30028/kurdish-lover\" title=\"\">Kurdish Lover</a> it is immediately apparent this is no ordinary family album. Far from being a fairy godmother, the old woman is more like a wicked witch: mean, cruel to her daughter-in-law, capriciously tormenting her brood.</p> <p>In the confined space of the house Hahn picks up the forces working on the family: jealousy, frustration, enduring inequality between men and women, but above all the miseries of war and exile. None of this is said; it is all filmed, with very little commentary. For example, Hahn offers no explanation of the refugee situation, so if you know nothing about Kurdish history, you may find it confusing.</p> <p>Hahn tends to focus on moments of violence and doubt, ranging from a break-up on Skype to the ritual sacrifice of a lamb. The apparent modernity of the online strife is compensated by the complete lack of privacy, with the whole clan sitting around while one of the youths struggles to come to terms with the demands of his western European girlfriend.</p> <p>We almost learn more about Hahn than her partner, supposedly the subject of the essay. She is often hailed directly by the people she so persistently films, sometimes prompting resentment. But the switch back and forth between a contemplative gaze and more invasive probing is quite in tune with the chaotic life of Kurdistan, a country that refuses to go away, despite having never really existed.

  "<p>The remark by the RIM chief executive that \"we have a clear shot at being the number three platform on the market\" in smartphones is under threat in Europe. New research from Kantar Worldpanel ComTech has found that low-cost phones from Nokia are driving up market share of Microsoft's Windows Phone, which is starting to challenge the BlackBerry for third place in Europe.</p> <p>In Italy, Windows Phone achieved a 10.4% share in the 12 weeks to 2 September 2012, the first time the platform has hit double digits for market share in a single country. RIM's BlackBerry, by contrast, saw its share fall from 4.8% in the same period a year ago to just 3.5% this time.</p> <p>Market share reflects a snapshot of sales, not the proportion or number of devices in use, known as the \"installed base\". The Kantar figures also reflect consumer, and not corporate sales. </p> <p>Across the \"big five\" EU countries \u2013 the UK, Germany, Italy, Spain and France \u2013 Windows Phone now shows a 5% share, up one point from a year ago, while RIM's has almost halved from 12.2% to 6.4%.</p> <p>But the challenge for both the smaller platforms is thrown into stark relief by data showing that in the US, Android and iOS combined had 93% of all smartphone sales in the period, which precedes the launch of the iPhone 5. In the \"big five\" European countries, Android plus iOS had an 82.5% share, of which the majority was Android, with 68.5%, while iOS had a 14% share. </p> <p>Samsung is crushing the rest of the smartphone market, with a market share of 48% across the \"big five\" European countries, says Kantar. Sony is also doing well in the region, with its new Experia phones outselling both the Nokia and BlackBerry models in Spain, German and France, Kantar said.</p> <p>Other data shows Android strengthening its market share in every territory except, unusually, the US, where its share fell from 62.9% a year ago to 59.6% now; only the iPhone showed market share growth there, up from 24.6% to 33.6%.</p> <p>Elsewhere, Android dominates. In the UK, Android had 62.5% of sales, up from 49.9% a year ago; in Germany, 78.6% (from 51.4%); in France 61.5% (47.8%); in Italy 58.7% (37.2%); in Spain 84% (55.2%); in Australia 65.8% (48.8%).</p> <p>Android is also taking over in emerging markets where Nokia's now-deprecate Symbian and RIM's BlackBerry had dominated. </p> <p>In Brazil it had 47.1% of sales, compared to 19.6% a year ago \u2013 and zoomed past Symbian, which last year had 64.5% of sales for the 12-week period. That has dropped to 26.7%, although Windows Phone has jumped to 12.2%, suggesting that Nokia has a total market there of 38.9% \u2013 almost certainly bigger than any single rival. RIM increased its market share from 2.5% to 4.1%, in line with its general growth in emerging markets in the past quarter.</p> <p>In Mexico, Android leads with a 37.3% share (19.4% last year), overtaking the former leader RIM's 34.4% share at the same time last year. Though Symbian is dropping there, it still has a 20.2% share \u2013 and together with the 2.7% share suggests that Nokia has a 22.9% share in the country, while RIM has a 29.7% share.</p> <p>A total of 57.6% of British mobile phone users have smartphones, which made up 80.4% of all sales here in the 12-week period, Kantar said.</p>",
  "<p>The Hippocratic oath isn't something Gregory House necessarily agrees with: he's more than happy to do harm to a patient \u2013 physically, mentally and emotionally \u2013 if it gets him one step closer to solving a case. The murderers might be microbes, but he's far more detective than doctor. Healing the sick is a perk of House's career; his real motivation is learning the truth. And even if the disease wins, he doesn't give up. Working out what killed a patient is no less compelling to House than trying to save a life.</p> <p>Happily for the patients at Princeton-Plainsboro teaching hospital, House usually pre-empts their deaths. He solves the case just in time, often after making the symptoms drastically worse to prove his thesis or rule out a possible cause. It's the only way he can stay on the hospital payroll, given his rudeness, unprofessionalism and deeply shoddy ethics.</p> <p>The parallels between House and his quasi-namesake, Sherlock Holmes, are obvious. For a start, House lives in a building numbered 221. Then they're both drug-users: while Holmes self-medicates with cocaine to alleviate his ennui and depression, House doses up on Vicodin to dull the pain in his damaged leg.</p> <p>Holmes has his Watson, House has his Wilson. And the show enjoys paying homage to its Victorian inspiration: the pilot episode sees him treat schoolteacher, Rebecca Adler (played by Robin Tunney, before she went on to disapprove of Patrick Jane in The Mentalist). The reference to Irene Adler in the first Holmes short story (A Scandal in Bohemia) is no accident. Nor is the fact that House is shot in the season-two finale by a former patient: Jack Moriarty.</p> <p>Finally, and please skip this paragraph if you haven't yet watched the final episode of House but are planning to, both men fake their own deaths. In the case of Holmes, it's a necessary security measure. Moriarty may be dead, but his lieutenants are still marauding the underbelly of London, waiting to slaughter our hero with a crossbow. And House fakes his death to avoid jail and spend Wilson's final few months with him.</p> <p>House could easily have been a thoroughly pedestrian formula show. The fact that it survived for eight seasons is thanks to Hugh Laurie, who imbues the title role with so much complexity that he can still surprise us after 177 episodes. His misanthropy is legend. His catchphrase is: \"Everybody lies.\" Yet he is still capable of astonishing generosity, as Thirteen (Olivia Wilde) discovers in the final season.</p> <p>House is a man who loves with a great passion: his on-off romance with his boss, Lisa Cuddy (Lisa Edelstein), is a driving force throughout the show, and his meltdown when she leaves him propels him through the final season. He is a man who will marry a prostitute he just met out of pure spite (and her need for a green card), but will then fall in love with her, and never say so.</p> <p>In the beginning, the main reason to watch the show was to see Laurie being American and grizzled and modern, and generally the opposite of the Prince Regent in Blackadder the Third. Gradually, the shock of seeing him switch from foppish fool to genius sex-symbol was replaced by the joy of watching him think. Hugh Laurie thinks better than virtually any actor alive. His eyes and creased forehead betray every step of his thought process \u2013 having an idea, considering it, finding fault with it, dismissing it, replacing it with a new idea. We see every flash of inspiration, every moment of despair.</p> <p>The measure of any detective must be that if something happened to you or your loved one, would you want this person to be on the case? If you were murdered, you would surely die hoping Columbo would soon be standing over your still-warm corpse asking difficult questions of your urbane, gin-swilling killer. And with House, that is doubly true: you might not want to buy him a drink, but you definitely want him checking over your medical notes.</p> <p><strong>Iconic</strong>? House is the ultimate doctor-detective. And the show's flashy production values count for a lot too.</p> <p><strong>Duffers</strong>? I have already blanked out his doctor-assistants from the final series. Also, Amber Tamblyn looks exactly <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russ_Tamblyn\" title=\"\">like her dad</a>, yet no-one thought to do a number from Seven Brides for Seven Brothers while she was there? Badly done.</p> <p>\u2022 In answer to last week's quiz, thank you for your heroic attempts to guess the truly obscure detective show in which I appeared as an extra (they filmed a scene at my school). I'm afraid the prize goes unclaimed, as no-one suggested Kinsey \u2013 a show so lame it <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinsey_(TV_series)\" title=\"\">has a shorter Wiki entry</a> than I do. I'm pretty sure Minnie Driver played Kinsey's daughter in the episode I'm in, but it isn't on her IMDB page, so either I am a crazed fantasist, or it has been removed, Trotsky-like, from the record.</p> <p>I will be saving my Monk tie-in novel (by Lee Goldberg) for another, easier quiz.</p>",

The film shows the stomach-churning adventures of two French friends, Tancr\u00e8de and Julien, as they combine BASE-jumping (throwing yourself off buildings, bridges and cliffs, using a parachute to break your fall) with slackline and tightrope walking among the skyscrapers of Paris and the natural playgrounds of the Verdon gorge and the fjords of Norway. In fact they push the limits of their sport so far, they are credited with inventing a new one altogether: BASE-lining \u2013 even more terrifying than its sister activity.</p> <p>All of this heart-stopping action \u2013 and how the pair feel about it (scared) \u2013 is captured on I Believe I Can Fly, one of 15 films being screened during the Thrillseekers Adventure Film Festival, a UK-wide event starting next week.</p> <p>The films vary widely in subject and style, from the daredevil French friends somersaulting over Norwegian cliff edges to the more cerebral musings of Mickey Smith, a surf photographer who describes his passion for ocean photography over shots of the harsh but spectacular Irish coast.</p> <p>There are epic journeys, including a gruelling trek across 1,140km of ice to the South Pole, and back, unassisted. The epic Antarctic journey is tackled by Australians James Castrission and Justin Jones who battle frostbite, hypothermia, crevasses and extreme hunger in their quest. And more personal journeys, such as the one seen in Chasing Water by Pete McBride whose experience of growing up on a cattle ranch with the Colorado river running through his 'backyard' inspired him to follow the \"American Nile\" 1,500 miles from mountains to the sea. The film captures the beauty of the river from above, in aerial shots taken by his pilot father, and from the water level as his filming partner Jon Waterman paddles the entire length of the river. From both views the frightening effects of environmental damage on the river are clear to see.</p> <p>The Grand Canyon is one of the most iconic natural sights of the world, yet there are parts of it that are barely discovered. In Last of the Great Unknown a group of canyoners set out to explore the steep gorges that lie hidden within its rocky folds.</p> <p>Clips of these five films can be seen in <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/travel/video/2012/oct/02/adventure-film-festival-video\">our video round-up</a>.

He writes:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The city centre, then, must be a place for much more than shopping - it has to be a place to live life. And life, in all its excitement and challenges and peculiarities, is something a shopping centre can only pretend to offer.<br>Cities should be places of discovery and unpredictability. Using empty spaces to exhibit local talent is a start. But there needs to be a more welcoming and open attitude to people who want to make things happen.<br>In Copenhagen, I heard this week, the city employs a team of people who are just there to say yes to people. In the UK, local authorities and property owners are far more likely to say no. That's why we need to free up institutions and attitudes as well as spaces - the behaviour makes as much difference as the opportunity.</p> </blockquote> <p>\u2022 Toby Blume's <a href=\"http://tobyblume.posterous.com/milibands-normal-education-reference-shows-ho#\" title=\"\">response to Ed Miliband's comments in his party conference speech</a> about attending a \"<strong>bog standard comprehensive</strong>\". Blume argues that the comments <a href=\"http://tobyblume.posterous.com/milibands-normal-education-reference-shows-ho#\" title=\"\">highlight how out of touch our political class is from the vast majority of people</a>, adding:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The upper echelons of our society are dominated by people who went to private schools. Some have suggested we now have a classless society, but perhaps someone forgot to tell those at the top. The evidence speaks for itself - pay for your children's education and they are far more likely to become an MP, business leader, judge or find success in some other prestigious and high earning career. Given the strong link between the earnings of parents and their children, we are simply allowing privilege and wealth to pass from one generation to the next. <br>I believe wholeheartedly in comprehensive schooling. Perhaps Ed Miliband does to. But if he really wants to show the public that his commitment runs deeper than political point scoring then he needs to find ways to tackle the inherent inequality in education that currently exists. That's not an easy fight to take on. There's huge vested interest (and deep pockets) in maintaining the privileged position of private schools, but taking it on would silence critics who ask when we will get to hear what Miliband stands for.</p> </blockquote> <p>\u2022 Schoolgirl blogger<strong> Martha Payne</strong>, who sparked a national \u2013 and international \u2013 debate about school meals with her <a href=\"http://neverseconds.blogspot.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Never Seconds blog</a>. Martha hit the headlines in June when Argyll and Bute council <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2012/jun/15/girl-photos-school-meals-blog?intcmp=239\" title=\"\">tried to ban her from taking photos of her lunches</a> for the blog.

Martha and her family are <a href=\"http://www.marysmeals.org.uk/songs-of-joy-welcome-martha/\" title=\"\">in Malawi at the moment</a>, seeing how that money has been spent.</p> <p>\u2022 An intriguing question, posed by the 24 Dash website: Could <strong>public toilets </strong><a href=\"http://www.24dash.com/news/housing/2012-10-01-Could-public-toilets-provide-answer-to-UKs-housing-crisis\" title=\"\">provide answer to UK's housing crisis</a>?

  "<p>Choosing where to live at university can seem like a minefield of tricky decisions with the potential to make or break a student experience \u2013 catered or non-catered, town or campus, large flat or small, ensuite or shared bathroom?</p> <p>Vivienne Robinson, accommodation manager at Newcastle University, advises new students not to sweat the small stuff: \"Provided you can afford the accommodation, try not to get too fixated on one specific residence \u2013 you'll have a great student experience at whichever site you're allocated to.\"</p> <p>That said, it's not a choice to take lightly. Research, says Robinson, is key; find out all that you can on university websites, in brochures and, ideally, on visit days. Bear in mind that photography can be misleading, and there's really no substitute for seeing the rooms for yourself.</p> <p>Narrow down the big questions first. Mixed-gender accommodation isn't for everyone, and if you'd rather stick with your own sex, that might make your decision for you. Keep your budget in mind \u2013 ensuite bathrooms and proximity to university will push prices up. If you couldn't bear to share a bathroom with strangers but it wouldn't phase you to get a bus into lectures every morning, then you know what to&#xa0;prioritise.</p> <p>When it comes to catering, cost is less of an issue, explains Robinson, as there will likely be little difference in price between buying your own food and paying for it inclusively. Instead, go with what appeals to you more \u2013 catered students don't have to worry about grocery shopping, cooking or all the extra cleaning, which can be a blessing for those with heavy timetables or during exam time. But for students with dietary requirements or who particularly enjoy cooking, self-catered is a great, flexible option.</p> <h2><strong>Standards</strong></h2> <p>Try not to listen to horror stories about the state of university accommodation. Yes, the quality does vary across the board, but all halls of residence have to meet a national code (UUK or ANUK), so you're assured of a certain standard. Besides, there are plenty of advantages university accommodation has over privately renting in your first year. It's where you'll forge your first friendships with other students, and most will have facilities onsite \u2013 anything from a laundry room and a vending machine to bars and recreation rooms. Most universities offer an inclusive rent, which makes it easier to budget as you won't suddenly be hit by a whopping great electricity bill just as the student loan is running dry.</p> <p>Importantly, for most students it's the first time they've moved away from home, so it's nice to know that there's always security on hand or a friendly ear close by.</p>",

  "<p>I joined the Conservative party as a 20-year-old student. It was May 2008, the recession was just starting to hit and I just felt like it was time for a change.</p> <p>But I am very much in a minority. In the 2010 general elections only 16% of black and Asian voters backed the Conservatives. And black people in particular are not only less likely to vote, but we are also much less likely to vote Conservative than other ethnic minority communities. For many people who share my heritage, the Conservatives are seen as being out of touch, sometimes racist, and only caring about the rich. I think they're wrong, but I also think the Tories need to recognise this strength of feeling, and respond to it.</p> <p>Black people are becoming an increasingly large political force within the UK, and are becoming more organised, particularly within faith communities. A first step in attempting to reach new communities would be for the party to stop using the rhetoric of blaming immigration for seemingly every problem that the country is facing.</p> <p>We know that every race equality policy passed since the second world war came under the Labour government. Sometimes it appears that the Tories' sole passion when it comes to race is on immigration. History has taught us that many people love to blame those not born here for their problems. Even during the premierships of Tony Blair and Gordon Brown, Labour talked tough on immigration so that voters who were unemployed, in a small house with a big family, or couldn't get the school they wanted for their child, could blame someone else. Refugees were accused in the media of being given mansions, and there was a growing though misplaced perception that asylum seekers were entitled to the same level of benefits as UK citizens.</p> <p>The ambitious pledge to reduce migration from over 100,000 to tens of thousands is a clear sign that the party feels immigration is a natural vote winner.</p> <p>But for the Conservatives to ever be able to attract a significant level of votes from Britain's growing minority population, their courting of this blame culture must stop. Recent figures suggest that the UK economy will lose around \u00a31bn because of the fall in the number of international students, and the problems with London Metropolitan University will further affect how Britain is perceived abroad by potential students, tourists, and ultimately investors. This cannot be seen as good news during such challenging economic conditions. Immigration does need to be controlled but it isn't the only reason for the economic mess that we are in today.</p> <p>Alongside this, the Conservative party should do more to recognise the massive disparity in stop and search, which has been an issue within the black community for years. Disproportionate unemployment, and major funding cuts to community groups, must also be addressed sympathetically. We must not be so lazy to think that because budgets are tight we cannot find solutions.</p> <p>The world is becoming increasingly global, and the same migrants who are vilified today could one day be the dual nationality citizens who will help to build relationships with emerging markets. In the years to come Conservatives, like myself, should not be saying the same things we are today; instead I hope to see a political system that has a more diverse representation. It's the best thing for everyone. Under David Cameron, much work has been done to broaden the Conservatives' appeal, but there is still some way to go.</p>",

Sudan is the country on the west of the Red Sea, and Saudi Arabia lies to the east. Over Sudan, the dust blended with the land surface below, discernible only by its fuzzy outline (upper left corner). Dust was thick immediately off the Sudan coast, but thinned slightly toward the southeast (visible in the high-resolution images). On either side of the Red Sea, the Sahara Desert and the Arabian Peninsula rank among the world's most prolific dust-producing regions. The dust in this image originated in northeastern Africa, where a network of impermanent rivers has created fine sediments that can be easily lofted into the air</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: MODIS/Aqua/NASA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396858936\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/27/1348767420252/Meeting-of-the-Waters-010.jpg\" alt=\"Satellite Eye: Meeting of the Waters\" width=\"400\" height=\"430\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Encontro das Aguas in Brazil, or the 'Meeting of the Waters'. The coffee-coloured water, rich with sediment, runs down from the Andes Mountains - the Solim\u00f5es. The black-tea water from the Colombian hills and interior jungles is Rio Negro, nearly sediment-free and coloured by decayed leaf and plant matter. Where the two rivers meet, east of Manaus, Brazil, they flow side by side within the same channel for several kilometers. The cooler, denser, and faster waters of the Solim\u00f5es and the warmer, slower waters of the Negro form a boundary visible from space and from the water surface itself. Turbulent eddies driven by the faster-moving whitewater eventually mix the two, as they merge to become the Lower Amazon River</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: NASA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396858984\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/28/1348842147263/Drought-Kansas-006.jpg\" alt=\"Satellite Eye: Drought, Kansas\" width=\"728\" height=\"480\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Drought, Kansas. The Cheyenne Bottoms Wildlife Wetlands area in central Kansas, the largest interior marsh in the United States, has been dramatically impacted by the drought besetting large areas of the western US in 2012. There was sufficient water in the wetland area as recently as 18 June 2010 (left), but the levels began to diminish as seen on 6 June 2011 (middle). By  2012, virtually all the water had evaporated. The area has provided a resting place for millions of migrating birds every autumn, and wildlife officials are using satellite images like these to help them determine what actions to take to sustain a habitat for the nesting waterfowl</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: USGS/NASA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396858940\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/27/1348767423781/Istanbul-at-Night-011.jpg\" alt=\"Satellite Eye: Istanbul at Night\" width=\"720\" height=\"480\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Most of Istanbul\u2019s Asian suburbs (image right) appear in this night view from the International Space Station, but only about half the area of the city on the European side is visible. The margins of the metropolitan area are clearly visible at night, more so than in daylight images. The Bosporus strait famously separates the two halves of the city and links the small Sea of Marmara (and the Mediterranean Sea) to the Black Sea. The strait is 19 miles long, most of which is visible in this view. Apart from the Sea of Marmara and Black Sea, the other dark areas are wooded hills that provide open spaces for the densely populated city\u2014one of the largest in Europe at 13.5 million inhabitants. The old city of Istanbul occupies the prominent point at the southern entrance to the strait.

A river flowing down a steep slope follows a pretty straight path, with gravity exerting a tremendous pull on the water. But a river flowing over a flat landscape can meander left and right, occasionally abandoning river channels to become oxbow lakes or to take a shorter route to the sea. In the past few centuries, the Horton River in northwestern Canada stopped wandering and assumed a more direct route to the sea. Situated about 260 miles east of the Alaska border, the modern Horton River empties into Franklin Bay; but as this image shows, it once followed a different path</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: ALI/EO-1/NASA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396858965\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/28/1348842140185/Extensive-agricultural-us-004.jpg\" alt=\"Satellite Eye: Extensive agricultural use in western Russia\" width=\"549\" height=\"480\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Extensive agricultural use in western Russia, with roads and rivers cutting through the cropland.
