  "<p>\u2022 Two ways to deal with political turbulence. One is to take immediate action: sack someone; set up an inquiry. The other is to opine, as James Callaghan never quite did: \"Crisis? What crisis?\" Amid mounting concerns about the elections to find the new cadre of elected police commissioners, policing minster Nick Herbert has opted for the latter. \"Forget the carping about police and crime commissioner elections,\" <a href=\"http://conservativehome.blogs.com/platform/2012/08/fromnickherbertmp.html\" title=\"\">writes the man with the plan on the website ConservativeHome</a>. \"It's the summer silly season and the media are landing on anything they can to whip up a story. So \u2013 shock, horror \u2013 candidates will be disqualified if they have convictions for an imprisonable offence. Just imagine the BBC's sanctimonious reaction if they'd discovered someone standing with a conviction.\" Which would be a reasonable line of defence if the only malcontents were to be found within the media. But, in truth, there is disquiet expressed by Labour types, independents and Conservatives, all of it documented in detail, not least by the admirable website <a href=\"http://topofthecops.com/\" title=\"\">topofthecops</a>. Isn't shooting the messenger a firearms offence?</p> <p>\u2022 Yes, crisis, what crisis? We should all jolly well be ashamed of ourselves, implying that all is wrong when all is right. But before donning that hair shirt, let us compare and contrast. On one hand, we have Labour's candidate in Avon and Somerset <a href=\"http://bobashford.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Bob Ashford</a>. He has had to withdraw because, nearly 50 years ago \u2013 aged 13 \u2013 he trespassed on a railway embankment and was fined \u00a35. Ashford later became head of strategy for the Youth Justice Board and enjoyed Home Office security clearance. No place for Bob. Whereas Kevin Carroll \u2013 he of the English Defence League, who was convicted of a public order offence in 2010 and given a conditional discharge after hurling abuse at Muslims the previous year in Luton, ordered by a judge to pay \u00a3175 costs and then another \u00a3330 costs <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-beds-bucks-herts-10731035\" title=\"\">when his appeal was thrown out</a> \u2013 can stand with the government's blessing. His was not an imprisonable offence. So as you see, it's all going very well.</p> <p>\u2022 And the jobless figure released this week \u2013 down 46,000 to 2.56 million \u2013 would seem to give further reason for optimism. The total is the lowest this year. \"Benefits Britain is learning how to work again,\" according to the Sun. And there is brand new opportunity courtesy of Tesco. The supermarket behemoth is looking for buyers. Not just anybody. Required, according to the ad, <a href=\"http://www.tesco-careers.com/job.cfm/reference/2317/source/BOND/\" title=\"\">are people who \"achieve their targets\" by \"getting someone else to pay\"</a>, \"buying for less\" and \"re-engineering\", which many translate as screwing farmers. Perhaps they're getting in quick before the introduction of the new code of practice which will ensure that they do the right thing by suppliers. It won't be a perfect arrangement, but then, every little helps.</p> <p>\u2022 We instinctively feel it's going well; and here we are guided by Nadia Cenci, a Tory councillor in Ipswich, and also a \"qualified confidence and performance coach and licensed neuro linguistic programming practitioner\". She has an approach commendable to any politician. \"Why I don't listen to experts (or facts and figures),\" was the subject of <a href=\"http://ipswichpolitics.blogspot.co.uk/2012/08/why-i-dont-listen-to-experts-or-facts.html\" title=\"\">Nadia's blog posting last week</a>. \"I have not needed anyone to tell me that global warming is a sham. I knew that years ago. The same as my gut instinct told me that the so-called ice age in the 70s was a load of old rubbish.\" Nadia foresaw the financial crash before Vince Cable, \"I just sensed it\". She also dreamed her roof would blow off in a hurricane the night before it did. \"My then boyfriend called me a witch,\" writes Nadia. Ipswich turned municipally to Labour at the last election. Can't think why.</p> <p>\u2022 And to end, a prayer. This from our scary friends in the fundamentalist group <a href=\"http://www.christianvoice.org.uk/?p=3832\" title=\"\">Christian Voice UK</a>. \"Thank God for the Russians and the Chinese,\" they say. Let us pray \"that&#xa0;Britain will pull back from its unqualified support of the Syrian rebels and realise that the Assad regime, with all its faults, remains the last protector of the Christian and Alawite minorities in Syria. Pray for more even reporting of&#xa0;the conflict. Pray that the Russians and Chinese will stand firm against western and Saudi duplicity.\" One man's&#xa0;hero really is another's villain.</p> <p><em> Twitter: </em><a href=\"http://twitter.com/hugh_muir\" title=\"\"><em>@hugh_muir</em></a></p>",
  "<p>The Olympic excitement is over, the Paralympics are yet to begin \u2013 we must turn instead to the methadone of fictional drama. <strong>The Best of Men</strong> (BBC2) was based on the true story of Dr Ludwig Guttman, a neurologist and Jewish refugee from Germany who arrived in 1944 at Stoke Mandeville's ward for soldiers with spinal injuries and, in the course of transforming their care and treatment, founded those very Paralympic Games whose 13th incarnation opens in two weeks' time.</p> <p>By all accounts, Guttman worked fast, though possibly not as fast astelevision's necessary narrative compression had him work last night. The good doctor (played by Eddie Marsan) hadn't been there two minutes minutes before he was throwing open curtains, hacking off plaster casts, decatheterising all those whose urethras could take it, sluicing out bedsores and generally waging a one-man war against a medical and wider culture that told the injured that their lives not just as soldiers but as men were over.</p> <p>Marsan managed brilliantly to humanise a character who was, in performance terms, hopelessly unflawed: a great doctor, great family man, great shouter only at those who needed to be shouted at \u2026 A lesser actor would have struggled \u2013 and left us to struggle \u2013 to get a purchase on him. But \u2013 and this is despite being lumbered with what 'Allo 'Allo, Blackadder and countless other sitcoms and films have for ever rendered The Comedy German Accent \u2013 Marsan somehow made him real, even ven he vas encouraging his patients to \"Gif it some velly!\" at the proto-Games.</p> <p>Newcomer George MacKay played the paraplegic Private William Gardiner, so young and pale a stripling that you would have thought his bones would bend, not break, and Rob Brydon \u2013 playing Corporal Wynn Bowen, a wisecracker on the ward who was consumed with fear at the thought of going home to his wife and family \u2013 proving that there is no mix of comedy and tragedy, or rendition of Men of Harlech (sung after a successful night with Mrs B), that he cannot pitch just right.</p> <p>There are a number of dangers \u2013 apart from the German accent \u2013 inherent in telling such a story, and The Best of Men sidestepped few of them. Most of the main characters were thinly written and the minor ones a parade of cliches we have come to expect from a medical drama set in the good old bad old days \u2013 the seemingly unbending but soon-converted ward sister, the hapless bureaucrat, befuddled parents and the arrogant, paternalistic surgeon representing All That Is Wrong With The British Establishment who is eventually bested by the interloper and the patients he had once written off.</p> <p>But it had heart and it had soul and if the story rather than the characters was the thing \u2026 well, what a story. And any lingering doubts dissolved in the haze of tears that rose unstoppably during the final montage of shots from all the Paralympic Games since, each one suggesting that while there is still much to be done there has at least been progress in our attitudes to disability. The next four years may undo every last bit of it, if Cameron has his way, of course, but let's just leave things there for now.</p> <p>The world can always be divided into two types of people \u2013 those who like board games, for example, and those who don't. Those who thrill to the news that a fancy dress party is in the offing and those who shrink from it like paper from a flame. Those who will listen politely to accounts of other people's dreams and those who will beat the teller to death with the nearest stick. But none of these divides comes close to that which separates horsey people from the non-horsey. They stare at each other from across an unbridgeable chasm.</p> <p>Jennifer Saunders is from the former camp, I am from the latter and should therefore probably recuse myself from reviewing last night's opening episode of <strong>Jennifer Saunders: Back in the Saddle</strong> (ITV1), the story of Saunders' attempt, after a 20-year break from riding, to get ready to compete in the Grassroots Championship for elite amateurs at Badminton. It was the most profoundly boring programme I have ever seen, skimming over every opportunity to show us what it is that fascinates people about horses, or to allow them to demonstrate their expertise. The Irish horse breeders and agents particularly could and should have been given a much longer canter round their lifetime's work and passion. Instead we got Saunders gazing lovingly at tack and telling non-stories about her childhood pony. Harrumph, as I believe the disgruntled beasts themselves would put it. Harrumph, harrumph.</p>",
  "<p>As defined by the <a href=\"http://www.unhcr.org/pages/49da0e466.html\" title=\"\">United Nations convention on refugees</a>, a refugee is a person who \"owing to well founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion, is outside the country of his nationality and is unable or, owing to such fear, is unwilling to avail himself of the protection of that country\". A little later on, the text of the convention specifically states that refugee status \"shall not apply to any person with respect to whom there are serious reasons for considering that \u2026 he has committed a serious non-political crime outside the country of refuge\".</p> <p>Whatever views one may have about Julian Assange as a WikiLeaks activist, it is clear that in legal and moral terms he cannot properly be described as a refugee. To be a refugee is to be in need of very specific protection, desperately won and deservedly cherished. Refugee protection does not apply to Mr Assange and it is wrong of him to claim it. As Charlie Chaplin said when a Nazi newspaper reporter once asked him in Berlin if he were Jewish, he does not have that honour. But the inappropriate nature of the claim goes further. Since Mr Assange is wanted by the courts in Sweden for the specific and proper purpose of answering two allegations of sexual assault, which is in anyone's language a serious non-political crime, it is also clear that he is specifically disbarred from being treated as a refugee.</p> <p>None of this fundamental aspect of Mr Assange's status was discussed in any serious way on Thursday by the Ecuadorian foreign minister, Ricardo Pati\u00f1o, in his long statement on the case in Quito. Mr Pati\u00f1o made plenty of other points before confirming Ecuador's decision to grant asylum to Mr Assange. Most of these were based on the claim that the United States wants to get its hands on Mr Assange because of WikiLeaks, that it may torture him, that his deportation to Sweden by the UK would bring this closer, and that Ecuador has a right to protect him.</p> <p>No one should be na\u00efve about the US, but this is a fallacious chain of reasoning. The US has not said whether it wants to detain Mr Assange, though it has had plenty of time to do so. If it wanted his extradition, the US might logically be more likely to make use of Britain's excessively generous extradition treaty with the US \u2013 which has not happened \u2013 rather than wait until he was in Sweden, when both Sweden and the UK would have to sign off on any extradition application. And neither Sweden nor the UK would in any case deport someone who might face torture or the death penalty. Ecuador's own human rights record is also far from exemplary, as <a href=\" http://www.hrw.org/world-report-2012/world-report-2012-ecuador\" title=\"\">Human Rights Watch</a> has made clear.</p> <p>Yet two wrongs do not make a right. Just as Ecuador is wrong to pretend that Mr Assange is a refugee, so Britain is wrong to threaten to enter Ecuador's London embassy. The Foreign Office may have been factually entitled to remind Ecuador this week that <a href=\"http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1987/46/pdfs/ukpga_19870046_en.pdf\" title=\"\">a 1987 act</a> allows it, if permissible under international law, to enter the premises. But the<a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/aug/16/julian-assange-diplomatic-status-ecuador-embassy\" title=\"\"> reminder</a> is more trouble than it is worth, and risks being massively counterproductive to this country's interests in places where fewer scruples apply. The threat was a mistake, allowing Ecuador to shift the argument away from the Swedish criminal charges. Our diplomats in hostile or failing states would be put at unacceptable risk if this threat were carried out.</p> <p>Thursday's events do not change the realities of the Assange extradition case. Mr Assange remains in this country. He is the subject of an extradition order that has been issued under due process. He cannot leave the embassy without being arrested \u2013 an embassy car is not diplomatically protected. Ecuador has found a way to tweak the tail of the imperialist lion, but the law is not on Ecuador's side and, in the end, the law should be upheld. Mr Assange should be extradited to answer Sweden's criminal allegations. In the meantime, Britain should concentrate on being patient and doing the right thing.</p>",
  "<p>While Ecuador might be surprised by the UK's reaction over the Ecuadorean embassy situation in London, it is one that is likely to be used politically by president Rafael Correa, who is likely to run for election again next February.</p> <p>Earlier this year, Correa boycotted the Summit of the Americas, a meeting of heads of state from across the Americas, because of the refusal by the United States and Canada to allow a declaration of support for Argentina's claim to the Falkland Islands. He called the United Kingdom a colonial power and also suggested imposing sanctions against the country for not wanting to negotiate with Argentina over the islands.</p> <p>On Thursday, foreign affairs minister Ricardo Pati\u00f1o said the UK's reaction amounted to a strong threat: \"It is basically saying, 'We are going to beat you savagely if you don't behave \u2026 but if you behave, we may not beat you savagely,\" he said.</p> <p>Pati\u00f1o has been foreign affairs minister since 2010. He represents one of the hardliners within Correa's government, who is pushing for a Venezuela-like line. Pati\u00f1o was involved in a scandal at the beginning of Correa's administration in 2007, and had to resign from his post as finance and economy minister at the time. Some videos showed him meeting investment bankers discussing how the bankers and Ecuador could profit from threatening to default on debt \u2013 a decision that Ecuador took in 2008.</p> <p>Since Correa came to power, Ecuador has become an increasingly polarised country and this is reflected in the reaction to the decision.</p> <p>For many supporters of Correa, granting Assange asylum was positive and gave the government strength vis-a-vis foreign governments.</p> <p>\"This is the decision of a country that does not ask for permission to the Brits to react, of a country that does not care about fear or intimidation that the foreigners are trying to impose on us about this decision,\" Rosanna Alvarado, a congresswoman from Correa's party, told state-run paper El Ciudadano.</p> <p>Some hardliners protested outside the UK embassy in Quito on Wednesday night and many cheered outside the foreign affairs ministry when Pati\u00f1o made the announcement.</p> <p>Even people that are somewhat critical of Correa were in favour of Ecuador's position.</p> <p>\"The United Kingdom and other developed countries don't usually allow small countries like Ecuador to challenge their decisions,\" said Marcelo Rom\u00e1n from his home in northern Quito.</p> <p>\"Ecuador's decision is a sovereign decision and foreign governments have to respect it.\"</p> <p>Rom\u00e1n said that even if Correa uses the situation to garner more political support at home, it is important for Ecuador to assert itself internationally.</p> <p>But others in the country are worried.</p> <p>Business people are worried about the possible reaction that could come from the United States in light of a trade agreement that is up for renewal between the two countries.</p> <p>Bernardo Acosta, professor of economics at Quito's San Francisco University and former vice-president of the Ecuadorean Chamber of Industries, said this decision might affect Ecuador's trade relations with both the European Union and the United States. Ecuador is currently negotiating a new agreement with the EU and a trade pact with the US is also up for review.</p> <p>Ecuador's main exports are oil, shrimp and bananas and the US and the EU are Ecuador's main trade partners.</p> <p>\"This might be the last straw,\" said Acosta.</p> <p>\"Ecuador is a small country with a small internal market and it needs a strong export policy. But such decisions can lead to more isolation and close off more markets,\" he told the Guardian.</p> <p>There are also worries within diplomatic corps. There has been a spat between Correa's political appointees and career diplomats within the foreign affairs ministry. The latter feel that Pati\u00f1o is pushing a political line without taking into account the rules of diplomacy.</p> <p><a href=\"http://elcomercio.com/jose_ayala_lasso/caso-Assange_0_740326145.html\" title=\"El caso Assange\">In an editorial for El Comercio newspaper</a>, former foreign affairs minister and former head of the UN High Commission for Human Rights, Jos\u00e9 Ayala Lasso, said there would be \"political effects\" if Ecuador were to grant Assange asylum.</p>",
  "<p>As refugees from General Pinochet's Chile in 1973, when many friends sought refuge in the Swedish embassy in Santiago, with the active help of the then Swedish ambassador, Harald Edelstam, we are horrified that the British government is threatening to use force to enter the Ecuadorian embassy in London to arrest Julian Assange (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/aug/16/julian-assange-ecuador-embassy-asylum\" title=\"\">Assange's fate in the balance as Ecuador claims UK threatened to storm embassy</a>, 16 August).</p> <p>Even Pinochet and his military gave safe conduct for the thousands of Chilean refugees in the Swedish and other embassies in September 1973, after the military coup against Chile's legitimate President, Salvador Allende. They respected the inviolability of a country's embassy and thousands of Chileans were allowed to leave and start new lives in the country whose embassy they had fled to.</p> <p>Now Sweden is apparently prepared, together with the UK, meekly to do the bidding of the US.</p> <p>If the British government is allowed to get away with this, it will be the end of the universally accepted principle of the inviolability of a nation's embassy on foreign soil. <br><strong>Kate Clark and Ricardo Figueroa</strong><br><em>Stretton, Derbyshire</em></p> <p>\u2022 In the tussle over the fate of Julian Assange, the precise scope of the European arrest warrant is yet again in danger of being forgotten. The warrant is an essential crime-fighting instrument in its correct application, which is \"for the purposes of conducting a criminal prosecution\". This must mean an imminent charge. But the suggestion that it can be used at an earlier, investigative, stage of proceedings keeps coming back. You quote a Foreign Office spokeswoman as saying that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/aug/15/uk-arrest-julian-assange-wikileaks-ecuador\" title=\"\">\"the UK has a legal obligation to extradite Mr Assange to Sweden to face questioning over allegations of sexual offences\"</a> \u2013 whether or not this was a slip of the tongue, it is still an unfortunate mistake.</p> <p>Eurosceptics who oppose the European warrant on illusory grounds of sovereignty are giving a free \"never get into jail\" card to gangsters and traffickers. But misuse of the warrant feeds anti-EU prejudice. It is therefore vital that the national authorities in the EU avoid mission-creep, by using the proper instruments for investigation and evidence-gathering, and reserving the warrent for when matters are ready for prosecution. <br><strong>Sarah Ludford MEP </strong><br><em>Liberal Democrat European justice and human rights spokeswoman </em></p> <p>\u2022 I am alarmed at the suggestion that the UK may use force to enter the embassy of Ecuador. The clarification by the Foreign Office, \"drawing the Ecuadoreans' attention to relevant provisions of our law\", is far from reassuring. The consequences of such an action would open the way for similar action to be taken against our own embassies \u2013 an enormous backward step in international relations. We do not always extradite where we consider that the individual concerned has some legitimate fears and the Ecuadoreans have made the very reasonable suggestion that the Swedish authorities could interview Mr Assange in their embassy. Acting as impartial observers, the Ecuadoreans could surely judge whether the evidence warranted that Mr Assange should be returned to Sweden.<br><strong>Francis Westoby </strong><br><em>Hitchin, Hertfordshire</em></p> <p>\u2022 It is impossible to believe that the government would threaten the Ecuadorian embassy without massive pressure from the US. In the UK we have the <a href=\"http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1998/23/contents\" title=\"\">Public Interest Disclosure Act 1998</a> to protect whistleblowers. To storm the embassy to arrest Julian Assange would be to act in the manner of the worst dictatorship and would shame us all. As, indeed, does the threat to do so. <br><strong>Jim McCluskey </strong><br><em>Twickenham, Middlesex</em></p> <p>\u2022 Britain should stop bullying Ecuador and grant Mr Assange safe passage to Quito, where he should stand trial on any legitimate Swedish criminal charge. <br><strong>Dominic Shelmerdine</strong><br><em>London</em></p> <p>\u2022 The government must be appalled by Ecuador's support for the rights of the individual in the face of demands from a powerful bully. That's not how things are done in <em>this</em> country. <br><strong>Angus Thomson</strong><br><em>Streatley, Berkshire</em></p>",
  "<p><strong>Hello, </strong><a href=\"http://www.alanis.com/\" title=\"\"><strong>Alanis</strong></a><strong>. Where are you?</strong></p> <p>I am at home in Los Angeles.</p> <p><strong>What can you see?</strong></p> <p>I see my husband's sink. I'm in his little area.</p> <p><strong>Do you each have your own sink?</strong></p> <p>We have our own sinks. It keeps our marriage quite lovely. I think space is tantamount to keeping harmony going.</p> <p><strong>How do you think you are perceived by the general public in 2012?</strong></p> <p>My whole thing is to stay the course. I&#xa0;see the movement in terms of the 60s&#xa0;and 70s being all about social and political commentary around the Vietnam era, and the 80s were really about entertainment. And then the 90s was about emotional landscape commentary and I was a big part of that <strong><i>(1)</i></strong>. The 2000s were all about entertainment again with the economy doing what it was and I think people wanted a break from the inward-looking, quandary-esque approach<strong><i> (2)</i></strong> and then now, not a moment too soon, I see us segueing back into a more psychological, emotional, spiritual commentary movement in music.</p> <p><strong>I read a reference to you as \"the former angry young woman\". Does that label annoy you?</strong></p> <p>When someone says that I'm angry it's&#xa0;actually a compliment. I have not always been direct with my anger in my relationships, which is part of why I'd write about it in my songs because I had such fear around expressing anger as a woman. I thought I would be retaliated against or physically hit or vilified. Anger has been a really big deal for women: how can we express it without feeling that, as the physically weaker sex, we won't get killed. The alpha-woman was burned at the stake and had her head chopped off in days of old.</p> <p><strong>Some of your new songs deal with equality in marriage. If, for example, your husband <i>(3)</i> had a snack, perhaps a sandwich, but didn't clean up after himself, would you do it and note that it's his turn next time?</strong></p> <p>I definitely wouldn't do it for him, but I&#xa0;also think that part of the beautiful, masculine quality is single-mindedness. So I wouldn't interpret it as a direct affront to me.</p> <p><strong>Maybe he was just busy</strong>.</p> <p>Yeah, he must have been in the solution mode and saw something else that needed solving and he went and did that.</p> <p><strong>There's also a song on your album called Celebrity, which features the line: \"I am a tattooed sexy dancing monkey.\" Is it about Paris Hilton?</strong></p> <p><em>(Laughs)</em> No comment. But, you know, I&#xa0;think fame became exciting for me in the late 90s because I could actually use it as a means to an end. I could actually have it help me serve my vocationfulness <strong><i>(4)</i></strong>. I could offer comfort and upliftment <strong><i>(5)</i></strong> and be a leader and take on that responsibility, rather than see it as this daunting thing. Fame became a great tool. But I still have PTSD from the Jagged Little Pill era. It&#xa0;was a profound violation. It felt like every millisecond I was attempting to set a boundary and say no and people were breaking into my hotel rooms and going through my suitcase and pulling my hair and jumping on my car.</p> <p><strong>How bored are you by people saying there's nothing ironic about Ironic <i>(6)</i>?</strong></p> <p>I wouldn't say bored, I would say interested because I love to get to the underbelly of why things bug people so&#xa0;much. People must be very at odds with the idea of being profoundly stupid. I mean, malapropisms; big fucking deal. It's kind of like in traffic when you're yelling at someone for cutting you off and you're cutting someone off too.</p> <p><strong>Pre-Jagged Little Pill, you toured with Vanilla Ice. What was he like?</strong></p> <p>I was instructed not to look him in the&#xa0;eye.</p> <p><strong>What?</strong></p> <p>I ended up never really being near him so I didn't have to apply my restraint. Bless him, I think he was in the middle&#xa0;of the mayhem and it can be overwhelming.</p> <p><strong>Did you have any moments of&#xa0;mayhem?</strong></p> <p>There was a period of time during the Jagged Little Pill era where I don't think I laughed for about two years. It was a survival mode, you know. It was an intense, constant, chronic over-stimulation and invasion of energetic and physical literal space.</p> <p><strong>Do you still practise iyengar yoga? </strong></p> <p>Parts of it, yeah. I'm the integrator. I have an aspiration for full integration, so I do hatha and iyengar and I know it's unpopular sometimes to integrate bikram with everything, but I also do ashtanga <strike> . </strike></p> <p><strong>Blimey. The Iyengar one sounds a bit mad. Doesn't it involve belts and blocks?</strong></p> <p>It's beautiful. It's probably the best experience I've ever had using ropes and dangling from things.</p> <p><strong>That might look weird out of context.</strong></p> <p>(Laughs) \"She uses pulleys and levers in bed.\" Please protect me from that pull quote.</p> <p><strong>What was Madonna like as a boss <i>(7)</i>?</strong></p> <p><em>(Hesitantly)</em> It was an interesting dynamic. It was kind of like back to the antiquated system of 80% record company and 20% artist. There was an inherent win-lose quality to that dynamic, so less a boss and more a psuedo-partnership, but it wasn't really a partnership because that's win-win or no deal, right?</p> <p><strong>I'm guessing she wasn't that hands-on?</strong></p> <p>We met a couple of times and she was&#xa0;actually quite lovely with me \u2026 early on.</p> <p><strong>You played God in Dogma and in your new video you're an angel figure.

  "<p>\"I'm that annoying bloke who goes on and on about The Exorcist,\" Mark Kermode told Radio 2 listeners at the start of <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01lssm3#synopsis\" title=\"\"><em>Mark Goes To Memphis</em></a> (Radio&#xa0;2). He is also, he added, a devotee of roots, bluegrass, rockabilly and jug-band music. When he was five, he formed a skiffle band with his brother; for 15 years he has played bass in a band called the Dodge Brothers. They went to the legendary Sun Studios in Memphis to record their second album.</p> <p>It was a great, rather surprising listen. Best of all, it was a decent history of the music and city, rather than a travelogue or simply a vehicle for Kermode to do what we know and treasure him for. There was one film reference (a quirky bar referred to as \"clearly a set of a David Lynch movie\"), but otherwise we heard a different Kermode: reflective, a bit nervous about playing in such a hallowed place, relaxed. He was still funny, though, describing his home town of Barnet as \"the least bluesy place on the planet\". Wisely, the programme was about the music, and the reality of recording an album.

  "<p>Beneath a whirl of police helicopters, freedom of information campaigners and the world's media gathered around Ecuador's embassy in Knightsbridge on Thursday to watch the next extraordinary scenes from Julian Assange's life unfold.</p> <p>The 41-year-old founder of WikiLeaks, whose notoriety and ability to polarise rarely fails to draw a crowd, was waiting to hear whether he would be granted asylum. He had already spent 54 days in the building as he sought to avoid extradition to Sweden to face questioning over allegations of sexual misconduct.</p> <p>His supporters had claimed that any such move could result in him facing a further trial in the United States, and maybe the death penalty, for releasing thousands of damaging internal government documents via his campaigning website.</p> <p>The decision to grant him asylum came in a televised address by Ricardo Pati\u00f1o, the foreign minister, who supports Assange's fears of political persecution, and was greeted with cheers.</p> <p>\"Asylum is a fundamental human right,\" Pati\u00f1o said. \"The Ecuadorean government is defending its right to protect Assange and we have decided to grant him political asylum.\"</p> <p>Assange, quick to spot an opportunity for drama, emerged from his room for the first time in weeks to thank officials and journalists, before adding: \"Things will get more stressful now.\"</p> <p>Ecuador's decision leaves the country at loggerheads not just with Britain \u2013 which has threatened to revoke the embassy's diplomatic status and raid the building \u2013 but with Sweden, which summoned the Latin American state's ambassador in protest.</p> <p>The story began in August 2010, at a time when Assange was beginning to be seen as an important player by activists campaigning for greater freedom of information. His WikiLeaks website was yet to release 251,000 diplomatic cables, which were later printed in a select few media outlets, including the Guardian.</p> <p>However, he had already been responsible for disclosing footage of airstrikes on citizens in Baghdad and was being lauded as a major figure in international journalism.</p> <p>On 11 August 2010, Assange arrived in Sweden on a speaking trip partly arranged by \"Miss A\", a member of a political party. He had never met her before, but had arranged that he would stay in her apartment while she was out of town. Days later, they reportedly had sex.</p> <p>Three days later and still in Sweden, Assange met another woman, \"Miss W\", at another seminar. Again, he went back to her home and again, they are said to have had sex.</p> <p>The two women then made contact and discussed aspects of the encounter. Both women reportedly said that what started as consensual sex became non-consensual and that Assange had deceived them about the use of condoms.</p> <p>On 20 August 2010, Sweden issued an arrest warrant for Assange. Karin Rosander, head of communications for the prosecutor's office, said there were two separate allegations \u2013 one of rape and one of molestation.</p> <p>Campaigners for Assange claimed that there was a possibility of a bigger conspiracy at work. One message on the WikiLeaks Twitter feed said the group had been warned to expect \"dirty tricks\" \u2013 an allegation that lawyers for the two women say is offensive and wrong.</p> <p>Soon afterwards, the arrest warrant was temporarily withdrawn, prompting an appeal by lawyers for the two women. In September, the case was reopened, prompting further claims of conspiracy by Assange's supporters.</p> <p>The same month, the Stockholm district court approved a request to detain Assange for questioning on suspicion of rape, sexual molestation and unlawful coercion. Assange's British lawyer, Mark Stephens, said his client offered to be interviewed at the Swedish embassy in London or at Scotland Yard or via video, but that the offer had not been taken up.</p> <p>Two months later, police issued an international arrest warrant for Assange; Interpol soon issued a \"red notice\" for his detention. Assange was forced to give himself up to police in London and was remanded in custody.</p> <p>Following the publication of the diplomatic cables in November 2010, Assange's cause attracted high-profile supporters willing to pay for his defence and bail. Socialite Jemima Khan, film director Ken Loach and publisher Felix Dennis posted bail totalling \u00a3200,000 to Westminster magistrates court, with a further \u00a340,000 as promised sureties, to secure the WikiLeaks' founder's freedom when he first faced extradition proceedings in 2010.</p> <p>In February 2011, a UK judge ruled that Assange should return to Sweden.</p> <p>Assange's team fought the ruling through successive courts until this June this year when the supreme court dismissed Assange's bid to reopen his appeal against extradition, branding it \"without merit\".</p> <p>The following week, Assange surprised and angered many of his former supporters by walking into the Ecuadorean embassy and applying for political asylum in breach of his bail conditions.</p> <p>Khan, who had given \u00a320,000 towards his bail, said on Twitter that the women deserved a response to their allegations.</p> <p>\"For the record, in response to those asking about Assange &amp; bail money \u2026 I personally would like to see Assange confront the rape allegations in Sweden and the 2 women at the centre have a right to a response,\" she wrote.</p> <p>Ecuadorean officials say its government has been engaged in ongoing discussions in Quito and London with the British government over Assange's fate since he entered their embassy. They claim they have sought assurances that he will not be handed over to the US by Sweden or Britain \u2013 assurances which have not been given.</p> <p>On Wednesday, they claim that the British government issued a threat to enter the Ecuadorean embassy to arrest Assange. The Foreign Office says it reminded Ecuador that it has the power to revoke the diplomatic immunity of an embassy on UK soil and says Britain has a legal obligation to extradite him.</p> <p>The decision to grant asylum is unlikely to end the stand-off over his future as Assange, having breached the terms of his bail, faces arrest as soon as he steps outside the embassy premises.</p>",
  "<p>Julian Assange's circus has pulled off another breathtaking stunt: <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/aug/16/julian-assange-political-asylum-ecuador\" title=\"\">he has won&#xa0;political asylum in Ecuador</a>. Assange's flight from Sweden, a decent democracy with a largely excellent justice system, takes ever more absurd&#xa0;forms. After the decision of Ecuador's foreign minister, Ricardo Pati\u00f1o, the Swedish Twitterverse filled&#xa0;with mocking jokes.</p> <p>Assange has few fans left here. On the contrary, his unholy alliance with Ecuador's political leadership casts a shadow over what was, despite everything, his real achievement: to reveal shattering news through the revolutionary medium of WikiLeaks.</p> <p>Pati\u00f1o praised Assange as a fighter for&#xa0;free expression, and explained that&#xa0;they had to protect his human rights. But Ecuador is a country with a <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/americas/in-tiny-ecuador-populist-president-restrains-press/2012/01/23/gIQAHBmQNQ_story.html\" title=\"\">dreadful record</a> when it comes to freedom of expression and of the press. Inconvenient journalists are put on trial.&#xa0;Private media companies may not&#xa0;operate freely.</p> <p>President Rafael Correa is patently unable to tolerate any truths that he does not own. <a href=\"http://en.rsf.org/\" title=\"\">Reporters Without Borders</a> has strongly and often criticised the way that media freedoms are limited in Ecuador. Assange is a plaything for the president's megalomania.</p> <p>Most of the women in Sweden who dare to report experiences of sexual assault to the police, despite the exposure that this brings, will find that the case is dropped because it is her word against his, and the other evidence is slight or non-existent. That is quite probably what would happen in this case, if Assange only dared come to Sweden for questioning. There is no reason to believe the fantastic conspiracy theories which say that the women's accusations are just a way to get at Assange.</p> <p>The press chief of the Swedish foreign ministry said on Thursday that the fear of Ecuador's foreign minister that Assange would be sent on to the US by the Swedes, and even be executed, are utterly groundless. Both Swedish law and Sweden's obligations under the European convention on human rights mean Assange could not be extradited to the US if he were wanted for a crime which might lead to the death penalty.</p> <p>There is a Swedish extradition treaty with the US, but the process of extradition is long and very complicated. So far there is not even a charge against Assange in the US, which would be the first step in the process. We don't even know that the American justice system wants to try Assange.</p> <p>Ironically enough, it would probably be easier for the Americans to get&#xa0;Assange from England, since the two&#xa0;countries are much closer to each other in many ways. But it's been a very&#xa0;long time since Assange did anything sensible.</p> <p><em>This article was translated by Andrew Brown</em></p>",
  "<p>Ecuador has granted the WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange political asylum \u2013 but he cannot leave the country's embassy in London without risking arrest.</p> <p>So what happens next?</p> <p><strong>Could Ecuador give Assange a diplomatic passport?</strong></p> <p>Such passports are supposed to facilitate travel but do not confer immunity from the laws of other states.</p> <p><strong>Could Ecuador grant Assange diplomatic status?</strong></p> <p>This would be a bold move by Ecuador, and would ratchet up the crisis. Article 29 of the Vienna Convention states that those with diplomatic status are immune from prosecution. It reads: \"The person of a diplomatic agent shall be inviolable. He shall not be liable to any form of arrest or detention. The receiving state shall treat him with due respect and shall take all appropriate steps to prevent any attack on his person, freedom or dignity.\"</p> <p>But there is a countervailing obligation on Ecuador to respect the laws of the UK and not to interfere in Britain's internal affairs.</p> <p>Joanne Foakes, a former Foreign Office lawyer now based at the international think tank Chatham House, said: \"In principle, a state can freely appoint anyone as a member of its mission, apart from its head of mission. But if they were to seek to do so now, it would be an obvious device to evade the laws of the receiving state, the UK. In these circumstances the UK may feel justified in repudiating such an appointment.\"</p> <p><strong>Could embassy officials put Assange in a diplomatic vehicle and drive him to the airport?</strong></p> <p>Diplomatic vehicles are immune from searches from the receiving country, in this case the UK. But even if Assange managed to get into an embassy car without being arrested, he would at some stage have to get out to board a plane. At that point he will have lost the protection conferred by being technically on Ecuadorean soil, and would be back under UK jurisdiction and liable for arrest.</p> <p><strong>Could he be smuggled out \u2013 or placed in a crate or bag that has diplomatic protection?</strong></p> <p>As far-fetched as this sounds, it has been tried before in the UK.</p> <p>In 1984 an attempt was made to abduct a Nigerian politician, Umaru Dikko, from Britain <a href=\"http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1984/jul/06/mr-umaru-dikko-abduction\" title=\"\">by placing him in a crate and attempting to ship him back to Nigeria</a>. Those involved tried, but failed, to label the crate correctly as a diplomatic package or bag.</p> <p>The Vienna Convention says: \"The diplomatic bag shall not be opened or detained.\"</p> <p>But such a package is not immune from scanning, or from thermal imaging, which would pick up body heat from inside any such package. In such circumstances, UK authorities may be entitled to open the package and seize the concealed Assange.</p>",

  "<!-- Block 1 --> <p><strong>Preamble</strong> We need to talk about cricket. At a few seconds past 11am (they're never on time these days), a gentleman will shout 'play'. Another gentleman will bowl a lump of leather as fast as possible, and a third gentleman will attempt to repel it with his trusty willow. Briefly, all will be well with the world. Cricket regularly provides respite or sanctuary \u2013 whether it's from work, life, your inability to stop whistling Pocket Full of Sunshine by Natasha Bedingfield, or the nagging fear that the spot on your face is much more visible to your chosen sex than you would like (yes, it is). Today we need cricket to provide respite from <em>cricket</em>, or at least the increasingly dispiriting events of the last fortnight. For the next five days, we can concentrate on the good stuff: bat 'n' ball rather than tweets 'n' texts. And woe betide the first person who mentions Piers Morgan.</p> <p>It's almost been lost in the shadow of what must never, ever, ever be called textgate or KPgate or Badgergate or anything with a gate, but this is a rather important Test match. In fact it's huge, so huge that, were Blackadder a cricket fan, he'd be off on one about Hugh McHuge, who's just been appointed professor of hugeness at Oxford University. </p> <p>England have no option but to win. If they do, they stay No1 in the world and their decision to drop Kevin Pietersen will be seen to be vindicated (even though, in reality, the result of this match has nothing to do with whether it was the right decision or not). If they don't, South Africa become officially the best side in the world.</p> <p>It's England's biggest match at home since the final Ashes Test of 2009, when a team without Pietersen \u2013 and, as now, given approximately no chance by many pundits \u2013 famously beat Australia to regain the Ashes. It's crazy to write off their chances here, although a good start is essential and they will have a helluva job taking 20 wickets on a pitch that usually saps bowlers' souls for kicks.</p> <p>Perversely, taking precisely no wickets on the first day \u2013 by winning the toss, batting first and batting long \u2013 would be the best place to start. After all the nonsense of the last 10 days, watching every last forward defensive of a Jonathan Trott marathon would feel positively orgiastic.</p> <!-- Block 2 --> <p><strong>A special guest will ring the bell for the start of play at Lord's today</strong>. It's not Piers Morgan. It's not, as was suggested, Usain Bolt. It's not Jessica Ennis. It's not even Natasha Bedingfield. But it is Yohan Blake, and that's pretty cool.</p> <!-- Block 3 --> <p><strong>A quick message to Andrew Strauss ahead of his 100th Test</strong></p> <p>1. Congratulations. You're one of the classier human beings to have played the game, and were a seriously good player before the captaincy started to have its inevitable impact on your batting and your hairline. We all love you dearly.</p> <p>2. Winthetossandbatwinthetossandbatpleasewinthetossandbat.</p> <!-- Block 4 --> <p><strong>South Africa have won the toss</strong> and will bat first. That's not good news for England on what looks a cracking wicket. Mind you Andrew Strauss, who knows almost as much about cricket as me, says it's \"not a bad toss to lose\" because of a green tinge to the pitch.</p> <p>England make two changes, with Jonny Bairstow replacing Kevin Pietersen and Graeme Swann coming in for Tim Bresnan. I'd have gone for five bowlers, but it was never likely to happen. South Africa \u2013 horror, shock \u2013 are unchanged. </p> <p><strong>England</strong> Strauss (c), Cook, Trott, Bell, Taylor, Bairstow, Prior (wk), Broad, Swann, Anderson, Finn.</p> <p><strong>South Africa</strong> Petersen, Smith (c), Amla, Kallis, de Villiers (wk), Rudolph, Duminy, Philander, Steyn, M Morkel, Tahir.</p> <!-- Block 5 --> <p><strong>The Tom Maynard Trust</strong> A couple of months on, the death of Tom Maynard still makes no sense at all. His family have launched the Tom Maynard Trust, as Jon Surtees at Surrey CCC explains.</p> <p>\"<a href=\"http://bit.ly/MYao3s\">The Tom Maynard Trust</a>, a charity organised by Tom's family in his memory, is being launched next week at the Kia Oval. As part of the launch, his father Matthew is leading a sponsored peloton of cyclists from Cardiff to London \u2013 also including Andrew Flintoff, Steve James and Surrey Chairman Richard Thompson \u2013 arriving at the Kia Oval shortly before the match between Surrey and Glamorgan on Tuesday (August 21) that will act as the launch of the charity.</p> <p>To raise awareness and boost the launch, we are hoping to bring together members of the cricketing community from around the world to tweet the same message simultaneously at 11am (GB Time) on Monday August 20th. We are looking to get as many fans, players, coaches, organisations etc.. as possible to back this so it really takes over the feeds of cricket fans and raises awareness on a massive level.</p> <p>The message is as follows: Tom Maynard was a great man and a great cricketer.

Where were you two weeks ago, eh. Even Gary Naylor deserted me. You sicken me, all of you.</p> <!-- Block 8 --> <p><strong>It's a proud day for both captains</strong>. <a href=\"http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/stats/index.html?class=1;filter=advanced;orderby=matches;page=2;template=results;type=batting\">Andrew Strauss becomes the 57th man to play 100 Tests</a> (and the first to do so having made his debut after his 27th birthday), while Graeme Smith jumps above another granite-willed southpaw Pom-basher, Allan Border, <a href=\"http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/stats/index.html?captain=1;class=1;filter=advanced;orderby=matches;template=results;type=batting\">to become the most capped captain in Test history</a>.</p> <!-- Block 9 --> <p><strong>Woe betide Emma John department</strong> \"I've recently emerged from an Olympics-induced hypersleep to discover that somehow Piers Morgan is involved in the KP affair. Just how long was I out? Did I miss a leadership coup at the ECB?\"</p> <p>Yeah, the England captain Piers Morgan is playing his 100th Test in the match between Europe and Australasia at the Kentucky Fried MCG today. How long have you been asleep?</p> <!-- Block 10 --> <p><strong>The good news for England</strong> is that there's a bit of cloud cover in north London. <a href=\"http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/stats/index.html?class=1;ground=10;orderby=batting_average;template=results;type=batting\">The bad news is that Graeme Smith averages 84 million on this ground</a>. Yohan Blake becomes the first non-cricketer ever to ring the bell at Lord's, and now it's time for some actual cricket.</p> <!-- Block 11 --> <p><strong>1st over: South Africa 1-0 (Smith 1, Petersen 0)</strong> It'll be Anderson to Smith, with three slips, a leg-side ring and only one man in front of square on the off side. England have had more theories for Graeme Smith in this series than George Costanza had for meeting women. His were <strike> more successful </strike> less unsuccessful. There's some encouraging early inswing for Anderson, and Smith gets off the mark with a single into the covers.</p> <p>\"What do you think about Jonny Bairstow coming in, Rob?\" says Jonathan Wood. \"Surely his (limited) Test chances so far suggest he's too green for this match. I'm not sure where else you'd go, though \u2013 I presume Bopara's 'personal reasons' mean he's still not available? Collingwood would have fitted the bill nicely right now.\" I'd have picked five bowlers but, as I said, that was never going to happen. Bob Willis advocated Rob Key on Sky the other night. Bob Willis is a wise man.</p> <!-- Block 12 --> <p><strong>2nd over: South Africa 4-0 (Smith 2, Petersen 2)</strong> Stuart Broad needs to bowl as he did on the final day at Headingley, with fire, brimstone and a full length. Petersen drives a couple through the covers before being beaten by a fine outswinger.</p> <p>\"I'm probably alone, but I don't think not winning this match and the consequent losing of #1 status is necessarily a bad thing,\" says Andy Smith. \"Seems we're a bit too keen to say we're No1 than get on the pitch and prove it, what is it? Four wins in the last 11 Tests? Maybe having to go out and regain top dog status might be a good thing.\" I know what you mean. Three wins in ten this year. You do wonder if there's something in the English sporting psyche that struggles to cope with the expectation of success. I mean look at the Olympics! I hope England win here, though, because if they fail to win, and then lose in India, an era could end pretty quickly. Look what happened to the 2005 side that was supposed to take over the cricket world, cure baldness and ensure we all live happily ever after.</p> <!-- Block 13 --> <p><strong>3rd over: South Africa 5-0 (Smith 3, Petersen 2)</strong> There is encouraging swing for both bowlers, and Petersen's attempted on-drive ends with a leading edge towards mid off. Early wickets are so important, psychologically as much as anything. If South Africa are 80 for none at lunch, England will find it pretty hard not to feel sorry for themselves.</p> <p>\"Look can we just not mention him?\" says Rory Taylor. \"I could fill a library with how much I despise him but he is such a sick, psychotically dependent, attention junkie that he would actually shrivel up &amp; die if we all ignored him. So it goes without saying what we should all do.\" Look, that's no way to talk about Rob Key. Honk! Honk with me now. Honk!</p> <!-- Block 14 --> <p><strong>4th over: South Africa 10-0 (Smith 4, Petersen 6)</strong> Smith takes a really dodgy single down the ground, slowly revving up his big unit as Finn runs round from mid on to collect and throw underarm at the stumps. Had he hit, Smith would have been gone. England have to take those half chances. Okay it's probably more a three-eighths chance but that doesn't exactly roll of the tongue does it. Petersen drives a Broad outswinger through mid off for the first boundary. England won't mind that; they have to take the risk of inviting the drive early on.</p> <!-- Block 15 --> <p><strong>5th over: South Africa 11-0 (Smith 5, Petersen 6)</strong> Petersen inside edges a big inswinger from Anderson onto his pads. This is a big hour for England because the ball is doing a fair bit. Another inside edge plops safely on the leg side. There's no short leg although it wouldn't have gone to him anyway. Anderson completes an outstanding over by beating Petersen with a sensational outswinger.</p> <p>\"So, will the England performance be able to step out from the shadow of the selection controversy that is plaguing the side before play has started?\" says Josh Robinson. \"I'm talking, of course, of the indirect dropping of Tim Bresnan for Steven Finn. Was Swann only 'rested' at Headingley so that this decision could be made in the guise of two tactical changes? I think we should be told.\" I'll text some of the lads in the dressing room to find out, although I'll be sure to couch the question in some banter just in case.</p> <!-- Block 16 --> <p><strong>6th over: South Africa 14-0 (Smith 7, Petersen 7)</strong> Broad swings a shortish delivery back in to Smith, who wears it in the breadbasket. He doesn't rub it, although I think I saw the ball wince.</p> <p>\"I respect Graeme Smith greatly (he'll be delighted to know this),\" says Steven Pye. \"He is a tough cricketer, an impressive captain, but must he make my life a total misery? Can't he just get out quietly one day whilst scoring a scratchy 3? Every time he walks out to bat against us I automatically assume he is going to make an unbeaten double hundred. I've had enough.\" The odd thing is that his record v England in South Africa isn't that great \u2013 he averages a <em>pathetic</em> 43.50&#xa0;\u2013 but over here he is as grimly inevitable as banter on a chat show.</p> <!-- Block 17 --> <p><strong>7th over: South Africa 20-0 (Smith 13, Petersen 7)</strong> Anderson is bowling beautifully, but it would seem Dame Fortune has a cob on with him for some rason. Smith is beaten by a monstrous outswinger, edges another along the ground for four, and is beaten again off the last ball of the over.</p> <p>\"With all the brouhaha about Pietersen in the build-up to this test match there hasn't been much coverage of how SA feel about potentially becoming the No 1 side,\" says Max Tant. \"Has there been any mention of their perceived, or otherwise, tendency to choke when on the cusp of glory? Will it affect them in a Test match environment? What will happen if they need one run to win with only one wicket left (not likely now they're batting first, but who knows)?\" </p> <p>It feels a bit different this time. They look calm and ready, although they have had some daft collapses in the last year. They have actually been No1 before, but only for four months in 2009. They lost the No1 ranking without playing a game. <em>Bottlers</em>.</p> <!-- Block 18 --> <p><strong>8th over: South Africa 22-0 (Smith 14, Petersen 8)</strong> England have got to get rid of Smith. He's such a distraction, and so intimidating, that psychologically it would be worth a lot more than one wicket.</p> <p>\"Thought Patrick Eagar the photographer once rang the bell at Lord's?\" says Dom O'Reilly. \"He's not a cricketer.\" Ah, you might be right. As with 99.94 per cent of the OBO, I nicked that off Sky.</p> <!-- Block 19 --> <p><strong>WICKET! South Africa 22-1 (Smith c Prior b Anderson 14)</strong> The beast has been slain! Graeme Smith is out! He chased a wide, very full delivery from Anderson \u2013 the first bowled from around the wicket \u2013 and England were certain he snicked it to Matt Prior. The umpire Kumar Dharmasena said not out and, although England reviewed straight away, it seemed the relevant noise was bat on ground rather than ball. Smith's bat <em>did</em> hit the ground \u2013 it bashed it, in fact \u2013 but he outside edged the ball almost simultaneously. Some wickets are bigger than others. That is a very big wicket.</p> <!-- Block 20 --> <p><strong>9th over: South Africa 22-1 (Petersen 8, Amla 0)</strong> \"When was the last time we had two unproven (say having played collectively less than 10 Tests) batsmen in our top six?\" says Matt Biss. \"In a funny way it might help Taylor and Bairstow that the other's there; neither will have to shoulder the burden of being the new kid on what is circumstantially a pretty pressurised block, feeling like the solitary rabbit in the headlight.\" Good question. Bopara and Shah in the Caribbean in 2009? The last time at home \u2013 and in a really big Test \u2013 might have been the 2005 Ashes, with Bell and Pietersen.</p> <!-- Block 21 --> <p><strong>10th over: South Africa 26-1 (Petersen 12, Amla 0)</strong> Petersen is content to drive despite the swinging ball, and puts Broad away for another boundary through mid off. Broad has a huge shout for LBW later in the over. Simon Taufel says not out and, although Broad is desperate to review \u2013 he's almost like Renton in Trainspotting; I JUST NEED ONE MORE REVIEW, YOU \u00a3*&amp;! \u2013 Strauss and Prior think otherwise. Hawkeye shows they were right, as it was missing. An eventful over concludes with a jaffa that swerves past Petersen's defensive push.</p> <p>\"<a href=\"http://andrewsullivan.thedailybeast.com/.a/6a00d83451c45669e20120a5ddcabc970c-500wi\">England fielders celebrate the wicket of Graeme Smith</a>,\" honks Daniel Harris. Honk with him now. Honk!</p> <!-- Block 22 --> <p><strong>11th over: South Africa 26-1 (Petersen 12, Amla 0)</strong> Finn replaces Anderson. This is a big match for him because he hasn't been at his best in his two Test appearances this summer. He starts with a sharp maiden, including a fine delivery that jags back sharply to slam into Amla's stomach.</p> <p>\"Vic Marks' piece in the Guardian yesterday had several hundred comments below it in support of KP,\" says Brett. \"Many reckon there is one rule for him, another for the likes of Swann and Broad. Would love to hear your thoughts on this.\" I don't really have many thoughts, about anything. It's such a difficult thing to judge without knowing all the facts, so I can't quite understand why so many people have been so strident. Things I do think: it's very sad and pretty unseemly, Twitter is evil, KP has been a fool but is surely not the only one at fault, and Strauss and Flower have behaved publicly with a class and dignity I'd quite like to call my own. That's about it. Ultimately, I'm sitting on the fence and citing ignorance.</p> <!-- Block 23 --> <p><strong>12th over: South Africa 26-1 (Petersen 12, Amla 0)</strong> Petersen has a disgusting windy woof at an inviting wide outswinger from Broad. Fresh air flies for four; the ball goes through to Matt Prior. A maiden.</p> <p>\"Morning Rob, morning sportsfans,\" says Nick Barrett. \"All this talk about getting Smith out is right. South Africa are essentially a one-man team and he has certainly carried them through this series. Amla is essentially an No8 batting up the order at No3 and after him we are into their tail of Kallis, de Villiers et al who are infamously easy to skittle...\" The West Indies team of the 80s had Greenidge, Haynes, Richardson, Hooper and Logie but the wicket of Viv was still worth two or three psychologically.</p> <!-- Block 24 --> <p><strong>REVIEW! South Africa 27-1 (Petersen not out 12)</strong> Finn has started really well and has a big shout for LBW against Petersen, crabbing around a nipbacker. It looked high and Andrew Strauss decides not to review. Hawkeye supports Strauss's judgement again. There's a much better shout next ball from a similar but slightly fuller delivery. Kumar Dharmasena thought about it for ages before saying not out \u2013 and England have reviewed it. Here comes the replay ... and it was going over the top. Bah. That's always the danger with a giant like Finn.</p> <!-- Block 25 --> <p><strong>13th over: South Africa 27-1 (Petersen 12, Amla 1)</strong> A fine start from Finn: 2-1-1-0. \"Strauss needs to grow up,\" is the subject of Tim Cadman's email. \"Anyone else think Strauss and England are being hugely over-sensitive about Pietersen and his texts? Sure he said a few bad words about 'Straussy', but is that enough to refuse to pick by far the best batsman in the country? They're not paid to like each other, they're paid to win and they have a much better chance of doing that with Pietersen in the team.\" Nup, because I don't know the full facts. I'm pretty sure it's about a lot more than a couple of text messages though.</p> <!-- Block 26 --> <p><strong>14th over: South Africa 31-1 (Petersen 12, Amla 5)</strong> Anderson switches ends to replace Broad. His second is driven masterfully through the covers for four by Amla. The response is a peach that swings past the edge. This is terrific cricket.</p> <p>\"A slight correction to Brett's description of the comments on the online version Vic Marks's piece in the comic yesterday,\" says Josh Robinson. \"Glancing at those comments reveals a frenzy of the tinfoil hat brigade, seeing in everything a conspiracy on the part of Strauss and Flower to force Pietersen out of the team, the nadir arguably being the claim that someone in the ECB or England hierarchy wanted to make sure that it was Cook rather than Pietersen who beat Gooch's record. A longer look (for it made oddly compelling reading) revealed that regularly someone would come in and express a relatively considered view that expressed some criticism of Pietersen, often also of other parties, only to be set upon by the horde of conspiracy theorists, and then leave the discussion. Meanwhile, the nutjobs would congratulate themselves on the fact that everyone was in agreement, and that they'd reached the definitive conclusion. It's a good job this sort of behaviour is confined to the comments threads on blogs, and that human beings don't ever act like that in other walks of life.\" With the obvious exception of the bits where people say how great I am, comment sections on the internet have largely been a disaster.</p> <!-- Block 27 --> <p><strong>15th over: South Africa 39-1 (Petersen 20, Amla 5)</strong> Petersen gets consecutive boundaries off Finn, flicking full-length deliveries from backward square leg and midwicket. </p> <p>\"It's nice to read a journalist admitting that we don't know know all the facts behind the KP stuff to form an opinion one way or the other,\" says Richard Gardham. \"However, we do know that an England captain (Stuart Broad) was following a Twitter account of one of his friends (which he joined some 90 minutes after it was started) that mocked in a quite personal way one of his team-mates. If England are going to be consistent over this 'dressing room harmony' line that we keep hearing, quite how has Stuart Broad got off scot free on that one by simply issuing a 'not me guv' statement? This tone of this message has nothing to do with the fact that my wife fancies Stuart Broad more than she fancies me, by the way.\"</p> <p>What would Fred Trueman make of all this? One thing about that parody account is that apparently KP retweeted some of the stuff as well. I don't know: are we really saying a player should be punished for having a joke at the expense one of his team-mates? You could argue it was spiteful (again, we don't know the facts so I wouldn't say that), but even then, this is a sport dressing room, not a shelter home for delicate souls. Whatever happened to Gary Cooper? The whole thing is a horrid mess.</p> <!-- Block 28 --> <p><strong>16th over: South Africa 43-1 (Petersen 20, Amla 9)</strong> That's another lovely cover drive from Amla, skimmed for four when Anderson overpitches a fraction. Anderson gets his length just right two balls later and again goes past the outside edge. England could easily have had three wickets this morning.</p> <p>Here's Gary Naylor. Honk with him now. \"Yes KP this and yes KP that, but don't England need to keep bowling jaffas? Especially against batsmen who are particularly susceptible, having grown up in an Orange Free State.\" Honk!</p> <!-- Block 29 --> <p><strong>17th over: South Africa 44-1 (Petersen 21, Amla 9)</strong> \"Okay, so we don't know all the facts re: KPGate, and we're never really likely too \u2013 which is okay, we can and will all make our own judgements,\" says David Horn. \"But I think that there is one thing we can all agree on here: Piers Morgan is a twonk. True, such a statement could stand on it's own any time before or after KPGate, but in these uncertain times it's handy to hold on to any absolute truths.\" He didn't write twonk, obviously. 'Ne'er-do-well' was the word he used I think.</p> <!-- Block 30 --> <p><strong>18th over: South Africa 49-1 (Petersen 22, Amla 13)</strong> Anderson is too straight to Amla, and you know what that means: death by whirring wrists, with the ball pinged deliciously through square leg for four. Shaun Pollock reckons England are straining a touch too much for a wicket, with the result that we've had five boundaries in as many overs.</p> <p>\"Come on Rob,\" says Ryan Dunne, \"internet comments sections aren't that bad! Before they were invented, what would gentlemen who enjoy spending all day discussing supposed plot holes in Batman movies have done to fill the time? Talk to girls?!\" I'm going out on a limb here, but you've watched a lot of Seinfeld, haven't you?</p> <!-- Block 31 --> <p><strong>WICKET! South Africa 49-2 (Petersen c Prior b Finn 22)</strong> England get rid of Petersen. Honk. That joke doesn't really work does it, what with his name being spelt differently and all. Anyway, Alviro gloved a short one from Finn down the leg side, with Matt Prior taking a good diving catch. It looked routine, except replays suggested Petersen's hand might have been off the bat when he gloved it, just like Michael Kasprowicz at Edgbaston in 2005.</p> <!-- Block 32 --> <p><strong>WICKET! South Africa 50-3 (Amla b Finn 13)</strong> What a jaffa from Steven Finn! He has cleaned Amla up with a stunning delivery. It came back off the seam down the slope, roared through the gate and into the top of off stump. What a beauty or, as Bill Lawry would say, <em>BAAAAAAAHD 'IM</em>! Finn has two wickets in four balls and England have something in their nostrils.</p> <!-- Block 33 --> <p><strong>19th over: South Africa 50-3 (Kallis 1, de Villiers 0)</strong> I suspect Petersen's hand was off the bat when he was dismissed, although it was desperately close. He stopped on his way off having seen the replay, although by then it was too late to review. I don't think the decision would have been overturned anyway as it was really tight.</p> <!-- Block 34 --> <p><strong>20th over: South Africa 52-3 (Kallis 3, de Villiers 0)</strong> A few umbrellas are going up, which is more than a little frustrating because England are one wicket away from a very happy place. </p> <p>\"As the kind of England fan who roars with uncontained glee at every opposition wicket (including Smith's just now) and stays up listening to TMS on headphones all through the night when we are playing a dead rubber in New Zealand, it saddens me to find that I actually hope England are just pipped in this match with Jonny Bairstow making a golden pair,\" says David Sherwin. \"Like KP, I grew up in SA and when I started playing village cricket in England was astonished at the 'let's all just get along, including with the charming oppo' attitude. In time, I came to accept that maybe this had a place in the village leagues but cannot comprehend how this attitude appears to have inveigled itself into the England establishment. The job, surely, is to win at all costs, even if you are hating every last moment of it due to the company you are forced to keep. One of my colleagues is an horrendously unpleasant Scot, but by God is he good at his job so I admire rather castigate him; time for England to do the same re KP.\"</p> <p>The key distinction that has been made in the last few days is that you don't have to like your team-mates, but you do have to trust them. Whether that's what England feel, I don't know. What I would say is that there will always ve a line which, once crossed, means two people (or ten people and one person) cannot play together, so in that sense I don't see how anybody can criticise the England selectors. You might criticise them for their judgement of where that line is \u2013 except we can't do that because we don't know all the facts.</p> <!-- Block 35 --> <p><strong>WICKET! South Africa 54-4 (Kallis c Prior b Finn 3)</strong> Well well. England are risking their last review. Did Kallis glove Finn down the leg side? This is close. I think he'll get away with it. He appears to glove it, but his hand was almost certainly off the bat when he did so. The third umpire Rod Tucker is having a long look but he surely can't give this out. <strong>He's given him out</strong>! What the hell has happened there? South Africa have the face on. \"That is a poor decision,\" thunders Mikey Holding on Sky. The only thing I can think is that Rod Tucker thought it hit the left glove, which was on the bat handle, rather than the right. It didn't, and Kallis has every right to be royally radged off. <em>On</em> the plus side, England have taken four wickets before lunch. I told you they should have won the toss and batted.</p> <!-- Block 36 --> <p><strong>21st over: South Africa 58-4 (de Villiers 1, Rudolph 5)</strong> That looks an appalling decision. If the on-field decision had been 'out' I'd still have reversed it, but to reverse a 'not-out' decision beggars belief. Some would say it's delayed payback for the Daryl Harper/Graeme Smith business in the fourth Test of 2009-10 I suppose, but it does look a stinker. It hit the glove \u2013 Hotspot now confirms that \u2013 but the glove was definitely off the bat handle when it did so. Snickometer confirms that was the case. There's a very small chance that both gloves were touching, with the left hand touching the bat as the ball hit the right hand. Would that count as a chain, like in, er, Shooting Fish, and thus be out? I'm not sure it would, and even so there's only a small chance that the gloves were touching. Kallis will feel like he's been strangled <em>and</em> sawn off.</p> <!-- Block 37 --> <p><strong>22nd over: South Africa 59-4 (de Villiers 1, Rudolph 5)</strong> Broad swings a full-length delivery onto the pads of Rudolph, bringing another big LBW shout. It was swinging down leg. Simon Taufel knew it. Andrew Strauss knew it. Stuart Broad probably didn't. A maiden. \"Saffers, meet Karma; Karma, meet Saffers,\" says Daniel Harris. \"This is what you get...\"</p> <!-- Block 38 --> <p><strong>23rd over: South Africa 63-4 (de Villiers 5, Rudolph 5)</strong> Ah, well. Nasser Hussain tells us that the gloves do count as a chain, so you <em>can</em> be given out that away. However, it seems the gloves almost certainly weren't touching. Either Rod Tucker is a genius from the future, who sees things we can't see, or he's had a shocker.</p> <p>\"Speaking of Kasprowicz in 2005, can you imagine the situation if reviews had been in place then,\" says Jamie Jermain. \"Australia would have reviewed the decision on the off chance he didn't glove it, the third umpire would have picked up that his hand was off the bat and Australia would have clipped the winning runs to mid wicket. Cue no wild celebrations, no Freddie and Lee and a horrible anti-climax.\"</p> <!-- Block 39 --> <p><strong>24th over: South Africa 65-4 (de Villiers 5, Rudolph 7)</strong> The final ball of the session is a snorter from Stuart Broad that swings through Rudolph's gate and bounces just over the stumps. The rain is getting heavier as the players wander off. What a morning it's been for England. Andrew Strauss said it wasn't a bad toss to lose, and Steven Finn backed him up with three wickets in seven balls on his home ground. The third was a gift \u2013 Jacques Kallis was never out \u2013 but England won't have too much sympathy. They are in a fantastic position and, better still, everyone is talking about events on the field.</p> <!-- Block 40 --> <p><strong>LUNCH</strong></p> <!-- Block 41 --> <p><strong>1.07pm</strong> It's pouring down.</p> <!-- Block 42 --> <p><strong>1.08pm</strong> \"Rob,\" says Oliver Smiddy. \"You said: 'Are we really saying a player should be punished for having a joke at the expense one of his team-mates?' Isn't that exactly what the ECB have done with KP? Wasn't he having a joke at the expense of a team-mate with his friends? And more to the point, doing so entirely privately, whereas Broad and co were doing so IN PUBLIC. I don't mind the ECB asking for an apology etc but there needs to be consistency.\"</p> <p>Surely it's impossible to have a notion of consistency when there are degrees of abuse/humour/banter/whatever. I thought KP was supposed to have used a derogatory word. More to the point, this is about a lot more than those text messages. England clearly decided that enough was enough ahead of such an important Test match. Without knowing all the facts, I don't see how we can criticise them for that.</p> <!-- Block 43 --> <p><strong>1.26pm</strong> \"And with that Rod Tucker 'dismissal' this Test has become a sham,\" says Luke Smith. \"Kallis is our '50/3 in a stitch and need a gutsy 100' go to man. At 50/3 with him in, we were always still in with a fight. Now? Well, if we make 200 I'll be surprised. Disgusting umpiring that will undoubtedly affect the match and series. Also defending it as karma is probably the sorest excuse yet. Graeme Smith's 'dismissal' at Headingley wasn't enough was it?\"</p> <p>It was a shocker, and can't be defended, but I'm not sure it makes the Test a sham or will overshadow the result if England do win. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2010/jan/15/graeme-smith-sabc-third-umpire\">Remember this</a>? Most people don't. <strike> They're not special like me. </strike> They remember Steyn and Morkel <a href=\"http://www.espncricinfo.com/rsaveng09/engine/current/match/387573.html\">routing England by an innings to square the series</a>, and quite right too. Even the Ian Bell/MS Dhoni incident last summer almost became a footnote by the time England had thrashed India a day later.</p> <!-- Block 44 --> <p><strong>1.30pm</strong> The sun is shining now, and play will restart at <strong>1.55pm</strong>.</p> <!-- Block 45 --> <p><strong>1.35pm</strong> \"According to CricInfo and the podcast on TestMatchSofa at least two independent SA journalists confirmed that he called Strauss a 'Box' in Afrikaans according to what they've seen,\" says Andy Cronk. \"It's hardly derogatory (even if it is slang for idiot) and really is no more than Broad, Swann, Anderson and Bresnan openly laughing at him and the tweets of @KPGenius. If he doesn't get a new central contract prepare the lawyers as constructive dismissal and workplace bullying are all options.\"</p> <p>No chance. And it seems most people think it refers to something a loot stronger than 'idiot'.</p> <!-- Block 46 --> <p><strong>1.39pm</strong> A great line from Mike Atherton on Sky. \"It's a very modern saga, with press releases, Tweets and so on ... I tell you how this would have been sorted in the Lancashire dressing-room 20 years on: someone would have got clouted and we'd have moved on.\"</p> <!-- Block 47 --> <p><strong>1.40pm</strong> \"Morning Rob,\" says Richard Craig. \"It's not often I feel compelled to congratulate someone for sitting on the fence, but well done. I think Vic Marks' piece went in a similar direction, which is perhaps why it became a haven for the people who think KP has been getting the rough end of all this. My question to you though is, do you think the press coverage has been fair? An awful lot of those comments were criticising the cricket media for uncritically towing the ECB line, and often not asking sufficiently searching questions. I tend to agree with this point of view, and I wonder if more people would be perched atop your fence were they reading more balanced reporting...\"</p> <p>Hmm, I think the reporting has been excellent. The proper journalists know the background to the story, and a lot more about what has happened over the past week, even if they can't necessarily publish all of that, so their judgement comes from a position of greater authority than ours. Except that ne'er-do-well Booth, obviously, who is no better than Stanford.</p> <p>Anyway, shall we call it a draw and ban KP talk for the rest of the day? Let's do that. It's getting a bit boring, and more to the point it's overshadowing what is shaping up to be a wonderful Test match.</p> <!-- Block 48 --> <p><strong>25th over: South Africa 65-4 (de Villiers 5, Rudolph 7)</strong> The justified fuss over Kallis's dismissal has diverted attention from the fact that England are in a sensational position, only two wickets away from a longish tail. Steven Finn starts after lunch and beats AB de Villiers second ball with a very full delivery that zips past the edge. I think de Villiers lost sight of it, and if it had been straight he'd have been in big trouble. He's really struggling and loses sight of a short ball later in the over that hits the face of a horizontal bat and lands safely on the off side. That could have gone anywhere. They don't like it up 'em!</p> <p>\"It's all a bit quiet at Lord's isn't it? I'd forgotten sport could be like this. don't we need a blast of muse to get the juices flowing? Boom! Boom! Boom!\" That's Emma John, the Guardian Olympic Vet who may or may be suffering from PostEuphoric Stress Disorder.</p> <!-- Block 49 --> <p><strong>26th over: South Africa 66-4 (de Villiers 5, Rudolph 8)</strong> A quiet over from Broad, who is swinging it a little but only at around 80mph. At the moment Broad is almost filler while we wait for another Finn over. </p> <p>\"I'm pleased that South Africa are in this situation,\" says Mark Hughes. \"They would certainly make a worthy No1, but the accolade demands that they should demonstrate steel and determination when under pressure. The three-match series threatened to let them leave these shores without ever having been under the cosh. Let's see what they're made of.\"</p> <!-- Block 50 --> <p><strong>27th over: South Africa 71-4 (de Villiers 9, Rudolph 9)</strong> The sun has gone back in at Lord's, although the chaps on Sky reckon the forecast is decent. Finn has Rudolph on strike when he would probably prefer another crack at de Villiers. A single off the fifth ball allows him a solitary delivery at de Villiers: shortish, wide and slapped crisply to the cover boundary.</p> <!-- Block 51 --> <p><strong>28th over: South Africa 72-4 (de Villiers 9, Rudolph 10)</strong> Rudolph can't decide what to do with a short ball from Broad, eventually wearing it on the arm. That prompts England to bring in Taylor at short leg. I'd be tempted to get Swann on ahead of schedule against Rudolph, who was dismissed twice in three balls by Him at Headingley.</p> <p>\"This morning, I caught a little of England's match in the Under-19s World Cup,\" says Gary Naylor. \"Ben Duckett looked a lot like Eoin Morgan at the crease with invention to spare and an eye like a dead fish. Nepal's fielding was excellent, but some naive bowling left their batsmen with an er... mountain to climb and England ran out easy winners. Quarter-Final on Sunday vs The Saffers \u2013 should be fun!\" It'll be lovely to see the future England Test players on both sides.</p> <!-- Block 52 --> <p><strong>29th over: South Africa 79-4 (de Villiers 9, Rudolph 13)</strong> Finn swings one down the leg side for four byes before Rudolph welts him through the covers for three. In other news, want to look at some pictures? <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/gallery/2012/aug/16/andrew-strauss-100-england-test-in-pictures\">Here's a nice gallery of Straussy's 100 Tests</a>.</p> <!-- Block 53 --> <p><strong>30th over: South Africa 79-4 (de Villiers 9, Rudolph 13)</strong> As Broad gets through another maiden, the camera cuts to Alice Cooper in the crowd. Alice Cooper at the cricket! That's magnificent. \"He looks a bit lived-in...\" says Bumble on Sky. He must be one of the more unlikely figures to appear at a Test match. Who would be top of the list? <a href=\"http://www.espn.co.uk/onthisday/sport/story/358.html\">Eisenhower would be up there</a>.</p> <p>\"'Two wickets away from a longish tail'?\" sniffs SB Tang. \"I dunno about that one \u2014 you might be tempting fate! Philander's got two first-class tons and a first-class batting average of 24.87. And Steyn, with his solid technique and temperament, can be a real Gillespie-like, crease-occupying pest down the order.\" Hence longish rather than long. <a href=\"http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/current/match/63844.html\">This is a long tail</a>. I wouldn't underestimate either of them, <a href=\"http://www.espncricinfo.com/ausvrsa2008_09/content/story/384431.html\">and we all remember Steyn's 76</a>, but I still think Philander is a Test No9 and Steyn a Test No10.</p> <!-- Block 54 --> <p><strong>31st over: South Africa 87-4 (de Villiers 17, Rudolph 13)</strong> A glorious shot from de Villiers, who times a half-volley from Finn through midwicket for four. Two balls later he flaps a short ball through square leg for another boundary. I don't think he saw that properly either. Thanks, incidentally, for all the emails explaining what 'doos' (box) actually means. I've amended the earlier reference.</p> <!-- Block 55 --> <p><strong>32nd over: South Africa 87-4 (de Villiers 17, Rudolph 13)</strong> This is a good move, with Graeme Swann replacing Stuart Broad. He's armed with a haircut, a history of getting wickets in his first over and the knowledge that Rudolph fell twice in three balls to off spin at Headingley. He survives the a full over here, if not entirely comfortably. A maiden.</p> <!-- Block 56 --> <p><strong>33rd over: South Africa 97-4 (de Villiers 27, Rudolph 13)</strong> A low full toss from Finn is eased through the covers for four more by de Villiers. That's the seventh boundary he has conceded today and the third in five balls. Make that four in nine balls, a whirling pull round the corner off a very poor delivery. It's been a mixed bag from Finn (12-2-48-3) and it's probably Jimmytime at that end.</p> <p>\"Most unlikely figure to appear at a Test?\" says Ben Powell. \"KP! Honk!\" I'm going to allow it.</p> <!-- Block 57 --> <p><strong>34th over: South Africa 99-4 (de Villiers 27, Rudolph 15)</strong> Swann loves having a tentative left-hander to work with, and he is mixing up his pace and flight. Rudolph works a couple to leg and defends the rest.</p> <p>\"For fans of the old glam rocker, I've just heard that Alice Cooper is going to be on TMS at tea,\" says Clare Davies. \"I always thought golf was his thing, but obviously cricket ranks too.\"</p> <!-- Block 58 --> <p><strong>REVIEW! South Africa 99-4 (De Villiers not out 27)</strong> De Villiers survives a huge shout from LBW by Anderson and England again decide to review the decision. This is extremely close. Did he get outside the line? That's the only thing that can save him I reckon. There's a mark on Hotspot but I suspect that's bat on pad. He played defensively down the wrong line at a good delivery that ducked back in. They are still looking at Hotspot over a possible inside edge, but I'd wager all my nostril hair on that being bat on pad rather than ball. This is even before we see whether it was hitting the stumps. It's all irrelevant because de Villiers has survived. The ball was hitting the stumps but the point of impact was 'umpire's call' and Rod Tucker, controversially, presses the correct button. That was ridiculously close. Approximately 49 per cent of the ball hit the pad in line with the stumps and 51 per cent outside the line. So the on-field decision stands \u2013 as it would have done had Kumar Dharmasena given it out \u2013 and England are out of reviews.</p> <!-- Block 59 --> <p><strong>35th over: South Africa 99-4 (de Villiers 27, Rudolph 15)</strong> <br>\"I was fairly surprised,\" begins Paul Stephens, \"to see Billy Corgan at a Test match in Wellington, New Zealand.\" You've been eating some very special cheese. <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHtq7rP4se0\">Hang on, it really, really, really did happen</a>.</p> <!-- Block 60 --> <p><strong>36th over: South Africa 105-4 (de Villiers 27, Rudolph 21)</strong> Excellent stuff from Rudolph, who chips Swann confidently over midwicket for four.</p> <!-- Block 61 --> <p><strong>37th over: South Africa 105-4 (de Villiers 27, Rudolph 21)</strong> A maiden from Anderson to de Villiers. South Africa could have sulked after that Kallis decision and given this away \u2013 and a few good South African teams of the past 20 years might have done so \u2013&#xa0;but these two have played with impressive calmness and determination since lunch. The conclusion you would draw from this series is that nothing comes easily against this lot, which makes some of their collapses in the past year or two particularly hard to fathom.</p> <!-- Block 62 --> <p><strong>38th over: South Africa 105-4 (de Villiers 27, Rudolph 21)</strong> Rudolph has faced every delivery from Swann so far and defends another maiden.</p> <!-- Block 63 --> <p><strong>WICKET! South Africa 105-5 (de Villiers c Cook b Anderson 27)</strong> Gone! De Villiers, having survived that Spandex-tight review on 27, falls without adding to his score. That's a huge breakthrough for England. Anderson lured him into an expansive drive with a very full delivery that nipped away just enough to take the edge, and Cook at third slip moved smartly to his left to take a sharp two-handed catch.</p> <!-- Block 64 --> <p><strong>39th over: South Africa 105-5 (Rudolph 21, Duminy 0)</strong> Crikey, what a position are England are in now. Duminy survives a biggish LBW shout third ball. There have no reviews left but it was going over anyway. Anderson, the pick of the attack by a distance, has figures of 12-4-24-2.</p> <!-- Block 65 --> <p><strong>40th over: South Africa 105-5 (Rudolph 21, Duminy 0)</strong> Now Swann has two left-handers to work with, and from memory he has given Duminy problems in the past. For now it's Rudolph, and it's another maiden, the fourth in a row.</p> <!-- Block 66 --> <p><strong>41st over: South Africa 107-5 (Rudolph 21, Duminy 2)</strong> There's a bit of excitement when Duminy appears to inside edge Anderson onto the pad and just short of gully, but in fact the ball hit both pads. \"Alice Cooper's management got in touch and asked if we wanted to do anything with him,\" writes Paul King of Sky. \"But they admitted he didn't know much about cricket so I declined. Baseball and golf are his thing I gather, but he likes sport generally.\" Insert your own 'you need a knowledge of cricket to appear?' joke here.</p> <!-- Block 67 --> <p><strong>42nd over: South Africa 113-5 (Rudolph 27, Duminy 2)</strong> From here, England will hope to dismiss South Africa for under 200. South Africa? They will try to sneak up to around 300 and then tell Dale Steyn that the entire England team called him a doos. This partnership is vital. Obviously. Rudolph cuts Swann confidently for four. He has faced every one of Swann's 36 deliveries today, and he's played him almost as well as Livia Soprano played Uncle June at the end of season one.</p> <!-- Block 68 --> <p><strong>43rd over: South Africa 118-5 (Rudolph 31, Duminy 3)</strong> Duminy drives Anderson wide of mid off, where Broad saves three runs with an excellent diving stop. England have been sharp in the field. It's almost as if they want to make a point. No fielder can do anything later in the over when Rudolph clouts a very wide, very full delivery over cover for four. The next ball swings past Rudolph's loose drive. \"That's rubbish from the batsman,\" says David Gower on Sky.</p> <!-- Block 69 --> <p><strong>44th over: South Africa 119-5 (Rudolph 31, Duminy 4)</strong> Swann gets his first bowl at Duminy, who comes down the track to drive the fourth ball pleasantly for a single. \"What's a good score on this wicket?\" says Jonathan Sexton. \"I'm always a bit reluctant to get too giddy before both sides have had a bat.\" No idea. Around 350-400 maybe, although as always a lot depends on the overhead conditions. It could easily turn into a 230 plays 260 dogfight.</p> <!-- Block 70 --> <p><strong>45th over: South Africa 123-5 (Rudolph 31, Duminy 8)</strong> Duminy pushes Anderson classily down the ground for four. Although he is yet to fulfil <a href=\"http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/player/44932.html?class=1;template=results;type=batting;view=innings\">his early promise in Tests</a>, he is a helluva talent to have coming in at No7. And Graham Onions is a helluva talent to have on the bench. <a href=\"http://www.espncricinfo.com/county-cricket-2012/engine/current/match/542534.html\">Look what he's up to today</a>.</p> <!-- Block 71 --> <p><strong>46th over: South Africa 123-5 (Rudolph 31, Duminy 8)</strong> The first jaffa of Swann's spell spits sharply past Rudolph's defensive push. Another maiden. This is such a crucial little spell before tea. If England get one more that ice-cool Gatorade will taste real good.</p> <p>\"Am I the only one who feels like this series is just starting to warm up?\" says Mike Jakeman. \"Ignoring the growing tedium around KP, England seem to be at the races for the first time this summer. The next two matches are going to be huge. There's nothing like the slowly unfolding narrative of a five-Test icon series. I can't wait.\" Yep. We've said it before, but whoever did this should be mirror-averse for a long time.</p> <!-- Block 72 --> <p><strong>47th over: South Africa 127-5 (Rudolph 31, Duminy 12)</strong> Duminy again drives Anderson through mid off for four. \"Re: the 45th over,\" says Ian Stubbins. \"C Mustard B Onions. Is there any more delicious way to lose your wicket?\"</p> <!-- Block 73 --> <p><strong>48th over: South Africa 131-5 (Rudolph 35, Duminy 12)</strong> <br>Rudolph continues to take Swann. It might be coincidence or he might be protecting Duminy. Either way, he blazes an emphatic drive over mid off for four. Fetch that! Rudolph has face 43 of Swann's 48 deliveries thus far.</p> <p>\"Makes me chuckle to think of each English cricket fan turning to their Saffer friend to call him a 'doos',\" says Richard Spry, \"when the correct pronunciation is, of course, 'doos' ...\" No wonder Graeme Swann isn't developing a doosra. In this age of faux outrage he'd probably be hounded out of the team.</p> <!-- Block 74 --> <p><strong>49th over: South Africa 136-5 (Rudolph 35, Duminy 17)</strong> Broad comes on for Anderson (16-4-39-2). His third ball is a miserable piece of filth \u2013 short, wide, 80mph and belaboured through the off side for four by Duminy. His pace is a long way down today, in the low 80s. Either that or the speedgun is knacked. An early speedgun, for the 1996 Lord's Test, reckoned Mark Ealham was faster than Wasim Akram. And a bloody good speedgun it was.</p> <p>\"Cook c Mustard b Onions,\" says Alex Marsh. \"Nothing particularly witty, I'm a lazy man. Just some more cricketing combos that <a href=\"http://www.espncricinfo.com/magazine/content/story/577060.html\">Cricinfo came up with but three days ago</a>.\"</p> <!-- Block 75 --> <p><strong>50th over: South Africa 141-5 (Rudolph 35, Duminy 22)</strong> These two are almost in block/thwack mode against Swann, and Duminy pumps him down the ground for four more during an otherwise quiet over. This is turning into a useful partnership. \"Looking at that link you posted of the scorecard where Graham Onions is running rampant, it looks like Durham are playing with 12 men?!\" says Kat Rowles. \"They are all out, but with Onions down as 'did not bat'. How does that work then...? Or am I having a blonde afternoon and have missing something \u2013 entirely possible, I'm running on only one coffee today...\" Yeah tey changed the rules a few years ago so that a 12th man from a Test could replace a player during a county match. I think James Kirtley was the first, but I can't find the relevant link. <a href=\"http://www.espncricinfo.com/england/content/story/131515.html\">Ah, here we go</a>.</p> <!-- Block 76 --> <p><strong>51st over: South Africa 141-5 (Rudolph 35, Duminy 22)</strong> Broad bowls a maiden to Duminy. Is that tea? Apparently not; presumably they've put it back to 3.55pm or 4.10pm.</p> <!-- Block 77 --> <p><strong>52nd over: South Africa 148-5 (Rudolph 40, Duminy 24)</strong> Trott replaces Swann, a pretty surprising move but one that almost produces a wicket. Rudolph and Duminy got in a mix up over a possible leg bye, and Rudolph was three-fifths of the way down the track by the time he was sent back. The throw to the bowler's end was poor, however, and Rudolph was able to get back.</p> <!-- Block 78 --> <p><strong>53rd over: South Africa 150-5 (Rudolph 41, Duminy 25)</strong> Duminy takes his eye off a short ball from Broad that hits him on the back of the arm. Given his perceived weakness against the short ball it's slightly surprising that Finn hasn't had a spell at him, although I'm sure he will after tea.</p> <p>\"I think that Ian Austin was the first player to be substituted during a county match in 1998,\" says Graeme Thorn. \"<a href=\" http://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/66/66337.html\">The scorecard here</a> says that RJ Green substituted for Austin when he was called up to play in the ODIs.\"</p> <!-- Block 79 --> <p><strong>54th over: South Africa 151-5 (Rudolph 41, Duminy 26)</strong> Trott. Duminy. One run.</p> <!-- Block 80 --> <p><strong>55th over: South Africa 151-5 (Rudolph 41, Duminy 26)</strong> Swann switches ends to bowl the last over before tea. Nothing happens. It's been South Africa's session, with 86 runs scored for the loss of AB de Villiers, although England are still in an excellent position. James Riach has just been presented with a keyboard by Lawrence Booth and will make his OBO debut after tea. You can email him at <a href=\"mailto:james.riach.casual@theguardian.com\">james.riach.casual@theguardian.com</a>. See you tomorrow.</p> <!-- Block 81 --> <p><strong>TEA</strong></p> <!-- Block 82 --> <p>4.06pm: Afternoon folks. Been a good day for England so far, although Duminy and Rudolph were beginning to look pretty settled out there before tea. Let's see how the evening unfolds...</p> <!-- Block 83 --> <p>4.11pm: Yohan Blake has been chewing the fat with Michael Holding and Ian Ward. \"I'm a better cricketer than a runner,\" he claims. Don't know about that, but I certainly wouldn't want to be at the other end with the Beast steaming in, that's for sure.</p> <p>He also thinks Twenty20 cricket should be part of the Olympics. Thoughts everyone?</p> <!-- Block 84 --> <p>4.15pm: Players are out for the evening session...</p> <!-- Block 85 --> <p><strong>56th over: South Africa 153-5 (Rudolph 42, Duminy 27)</strong> Trott continues after tea, don't know if he'll stick there or England want to swap Finn to the Nursery End. Either way it's a pretty tight over from him, just the two off it. Blake in the Sky commentary box, says he can bowl around 89-90mph. I reckon this young maverick is pulling our leg a wee bit.</p> <!-- Block 86 --> <p><strong>57th over: South Africa 163-5 (Rudolph 42, Duminy 33)</strong> It is Finn who takes the reins now and he beats Duminy's outside edge with a beaut. Next delivery is too full though and is driven through the covers for four. Lovely shot from Duminy, who picks up another couple on the off side. Four leg byes from the last ball, an expensive over.</p> <p>Guy Hornsby says: \"Listening to Alice Cooper on TMS is wonderfully surreal. I could listen to him chat all day, he's such a softly-spoken gent for his stage reputation. And having him at Lord's, chatting to Aggers about snakes, having brought a cake in to TMS, I never thought I'd see the day. I can imagine some of the MCC chaps choking into their pink gins. Sir Geoffrey made himself scarce, possibly so someone couldn't take a photo and tweet it. I'd have paid good money to see that. \"</p> <p>Think Geoffrey was probably perturbed by the whole thing.</p> <!-- Block 87 --> <p><strong>WICKET! (Rudolph, b Swann 42)</strong></p> <!-- Block 88 --> <p>Rudolph won't be happy with that, straight through the gate from Swann, who replaces Trott and has an immediate impact. Bit of a half-tracker that came off the inside edge, onto the pad before clattering the stumps. Vernon Philander next up...</p> <!-- Block 89 --> <p><strong>58th over: South Africa 164-6 (Duminy 33, Philander 1)</strong> Great over from Swann, England nearing the tail now.</p> <!-- Block 90 --> <p><strong>59th over: South Africa 172-6 (Duminy 33, Philander 9)</strong> Finn with a bit of late movement and catches Philander's outside edge, but that runs for four with no third man. Dead ball next up as Finn accidentally knocks off the bails with his leg when releasing. Lovely cover drive from Philander takes him quickly to nine, again Finn going too long. To compensate he bangs in a short one.</p> <!-- Block 91 --> <p><strong>60th over: South Africa 177-6 (Duminy 34, Philander 13)</strong></p> <p>Swann gets punished with the last ball of the over as Philander smashes one to the leg-side boundary. Something for the South Africans to cheer about. </p> <p>On the Olympics debate...</p> <p>Alex Walker: \"There's enough micky mouse sports already there and it wouldn't be the pinnacle of the game. Football, tennis and golf in Brazil, should all be taken out. The Olympics is for sports that don't have a bigger stage. There's a reason Murray won the semis and final in straight sets.\"</p> <p>John Starbuck: \"They began talking about T20 as an Olympic sport a couple of years ago, when it became clear it really worked as a short-form competition, but it will have to wait awhile as all the new sports are already sorted for Rio and anyway you have to replace another sport, like kitesurfing for windsurfing. Mind you, one of the new ones is golf, so obviously the bar is set pretty low.\"</p> <!-- Block 92 --> <p><strong>61st over: South Africa 178-6 (Duminy 34, Philander 13)</strong></p> <p>Finn with a better over, just the one off it as Duminy pats a short one down on the leg side.</p> <p>Phil Sawyer says: \"Afternoon James, welcome to the seat of power. Use it, don't abuse it. Mind you, the last time someone said that to Smyth \u2026, well, questions were asked in Parliament and Gary Naylor was left with a permanent twitch. Anyway, I digress. What time can today's play go on until, bearing in mind the short rain delay? Just trying to work out whether it's worth legging it home from work to catch an hour or so's play.\"</p> <p>Think close will be between 6.30pm and 7pm tonight. I do feel incredibly powerful right now, it has to be said. This is the pinnacle.</p> <!-- Block 93 --> <p><strong>62nd over: South Africa 180-6 (Duminy 37, Philander 13)</strong> A couple off the over from Swann. Far more interesting, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/cricketanalyst/status/236123567639633920/photo/1\">this picture on Twitter courtesy of Simon Hughes</a>.</p> <p>I challenge you not to laugh at that. <strong>Caption competition... what is Geoffrey thinking?<br></strong></p> <!-- Block 94 --> <p><strong>63rd over: South Africa 183-6 (Duminy 38, Philander 15)</strong> Chance for a catch at deep square leg as Philander doesn't catch his pull quite right...but it falls short of Bell. Finn looks on with disappointment, but there was no way that was ever going to reach. He's getting some really fierce bounce out there and it's causing problems. Wonder if Bairstow is looking on with concern.</p> <!-- Block 95 --> <p><strong>64th over: South Africa 188-6 (Duminy 39, Philander 18)</strong> Change of bowling and it's Anderson who takes over from Swann, a good move in my opinion. A few loose ones to begin with that are dispatched for singles, but there's still plenty of swing for Jimmy to play with, moving it away well from the right-hander Philander. That rolled off the tongue very nicely. Ooh. Hard hands from Philander and he edges one to second slip...but it falls short of Swann.</p> <!-- Block 96 --> <p><strong>65th over: South Africa 191-6 (Duminy 40, Philander 21)</strong> Tight over from Swann but England will be keen to not let these two settle down...</p> <p>Tom Bonsel says: \"James, see if you can't use your new found power to depose the Rob Smyth. Perhaps send a few scurrilous rumours bouncing round the press-box that Rob has been sending derogatory text messages to other Gruanaid staffers......\"</p> <p>I know for a fact that he called John Ashdown a box behind his back this morning.</p> <!-- Block 97 --> <p><strong>66th over: South Africa 192-6 (Duminy 40, Philander 22)</strong> That's an absolute jaffa from Anderson to Philander, cutting away off the seam and beating the bat by a country mile. Although he's walking a bit gingerly at the moment, stretching and rolling his ankle. Looks like he'll be OK to soldier on and his next delivery shows no signs that he is suffering from too much pain.</p> <!-- Block 98 --> <p><strong>67th over: South Africa 193-6 (Duminy 40, Philander 23)</strong> Great fielding at mid-wicket from the captain, diving to his left well. A single next up from Philander though who pads one past Ian Bell at short leg. Oh that's a snorter from Swann! He drifts one in to Duminy but it turns viciously off the pitch, beating the bat and finding Prior's gloves. Duminy tries to then cut one away but doesn't get it off the middle.</p> <p>Caption competition, for this <a href=\"https://twitter.com/cricketanalyst/status/236123567639633920/photo/1\">wonderful photo</a>.</p> <p>Gary Naylor: \"Bah gum! Dennis Lillee is more frightening now than at Perth in<br>1971!\"</p> <p>Joseph Surtees: \"Welcome t' my nightmare\"</p> <p>David Wright: \"I could play the bassline to \"Poison\" on a stick of rhubarb lad\"</p> <p>Luke Williams: \"'Alice? Alice? Who the f* is Alice?\"</p> <!-- Block 99 --> <p><strong>68th over: South Africa 195-6 (Duminy 40, Philander 24)</strong> Half a chance of a run-out as Philander tickles one to mid-wicket, but it's Trott in position who isn't the quickest in the field. \"He won't be challenging the Jamaican sprint team,\" opines Beefy.</p> <p>A shout for lbw next against Duminy but that pitched just outside the line and was rising over the stumps. Not a serious appeal.</p> <!-- Block 100 --> <p><strong>69th over: South Africa 198-6 (Duminy 42, Philander 25)</strong> Three from the over, with Swann keeping it relatively tight. 11 overs until the new ball so Anderson is going to have a little rest and Broad will be up next.</p> <p>\"Eeeee, there's nowt s' queer as folk\" is Jonathan Sexton's caption attempt...</p> <p>\"Sir Geoffrey's cheeky grin is leading me to try and think up some kind of pun involving \"corridor of uncertainty\" but at present I'm drawing a blank.\"</p> <!-- Block 101 --> <p><strong>70th over: South Africa 201-6 (Duminy 44, Philander 26)</strong> Broad charges in and his first ball is slightly over-pitched, Duminy drives and thinks he's beaten Trott in the field, a mistake, and he has to quicken his running to make ground, making it relatively comfortably in the end though. Broad then counters with a shorter effort which Philander edges and balloons up in the air, but it falls safe. That was a let off but the 200 comes up for South Africa and there is a ripple of applause around Lord's.</p> <p><strong>DRINKS ARE SERVED</strong></p> <!-- Block 102 --> <p><strong>71st over: South Africa 205-6 (Duminy 47, Philander 27)</strong> Nicely played from Duminy off Swann, tickled through the off side for two. This is a good battle between the right-arm spinner and the left-hand batsman, who flicks one off his legs to give Philander the strike. He drops onto the back foot and plays the ball to the covers for a single. Swann ends the over with a full toss but Duminy can't score.</p> <!-- Block 103 --> <p><strong>72nd over: South Africa 217-6 (Duminy 50, Philander 36)</strong> Philander slices one off Broad and that beats the man at point and runs away to the boundary for four. That wasn't textbook by any stretch of the imagination but effective nonetheless. Broad then sends a short one down but Duminy plays it beautifully, guiding it down to third man to bring up his 50 and the 50 partnership. Philander smacks one down the ground to the long-off boundary for four. Oh dear Stuart.</p> <!-- Block 104 --> <p><strong>73rd over: South Africa 218-6 (Duminy 51, Philander 36)</strong> This partnership is beginning to get a bit worrying for England but the new ball is available in seven overs \u2013 that will be the key. One off that over from Swann.</p> <p>James Dale: \"Graham Onions has all 8 Notts wickets up at Trent Bridge and is on for the first 10fer in first class cricket since....?\"</p> <p>Great performance from Onions it has to be said, driving back up to Nottingham this morning after not being selected for this game. <strong>He has in fact taken nine wickets and the other one was a run-out! Staggering!</strong></p> <!-- Block 105 --> <p><strong>74th over: South Africa 220-6 (Duminy 53, Philander 36)</strong> Swashbuckling stroke from Duminy through the covers off Broad but there is a man on the rope to stop the four.</p> <p>More captions...</p> <p>David Keech: \"Hey Lad, get thee a haircut before thee talks to me!\"</p> <p>Adam Czarnowski: \"David Lynch finally announces his controversial choice of stars to play Leland Palmer, and his evil alter-ego Bob, in the upcoming 2012 3-D remake of Twin Peaks.\"</p> <p>Phil Sawyer: \"That'll be 100 quid, lad. 200 if you want it signed.\"</p> <!-- Block 106 --> <p><strong>75th over: South Africa 223-6 (Duminy 54, Philander 38)</strong> The new ball can't come soon enough for England now. Duminy and Philander are moving their feet well and striding down the pitch to Swann at every opportunity. 60 off 105 balls for these two but here comes Mr Trott for another short burst. He had three overs earlier \u2013 can the part-timer catch South Africa off guard?</p> <!-- Block 107 --> <p><strong>76th over: South Africa 225-6 (Duminy 54, Philander 38)</strong> Goodness me Trott beats Philander all ends up, but he also beats Prior as well! His first delivery nips back through the gate but England's wicketkeeper completely misses it and that's two byes. That was precisely 1.3cm away from the off stump according to Hawkeye, mightily close. No runs scored by either batsman.</p> <!-- Block 108 --> <p><strong>77th over: South Africa 225-6 (Duminy 54, Philander 38)</strong> It's a first maiden in a while for England, Swann not giving away anything there and Duminy can't score. </p> <p>Alex Wright: \"In response to James Dale, was the last 10fer Otis Gibson, of Durham at the time, against Hampshire a few years back? I recall it because whilst he was ripping through th opposition batting order his sometime former team mates in the West Indies side were toiling badly against a rampant england batting line up.\"</p> <!-- Block 109 --> <p><strong>78th over: South Africa 227-6 (Duminy 55, Philander 39)</strong> Trott with another over of his dibbler-dobblers that are making the South African's think just a tad. There's certainly a little bit of gentle swing in the middle there and he's keeping a good line to Duminy. More confusion between the wickets between the batsmen, though, and there's a shy at the stumps ... but Philander had comfortably made his ground.</p> <!-- Block 110 --> <p><strong>79th over: South Africa 233-6 (Duminy 60, Philander 40)</strong> Lovely, delicate shot from Duminy that adds four onto his score, tickling Swann down to fine leg with a deft touch. He seems to have won the little tussle that the two were having. Philander, meanwhile, is batting sensibly, picking up ones and twos without doing anything extravagant.</p> <p>Caption from Philip Keegan: \"My mother could bite the head off a chicken with a stick of rhubarb.\"</p> <!-- Block 111 --> <p><strong>80th over: South Africa 235-6 (Duminy 61, Philander 41)</strong> Trott beats Philander's outside edge with a corker. Still England can't break this partnership, though. Jimmy Anderson is warming up and set to start a new spell.</p> <p><strong>THE NEW BALL IS TAKEN</strong></p> <!-- Block 112 --> <p><strong>WICKET! (Duminy, b Anderson c Prior, 61)</strong></p> <!-- Block 113 --> <p><strong>81st over: South Africa 235-7 (Philander 41, Steyn 0)</strong> Duminy will be furious with himself for that. Anderson strikes from the Pavilion End and the new ball does its job. A really poor shot which he top edges to Prior, and to be honest, it wasn't a great delivery - indeed, it was the widest Anderson has balled to Duminy all innings. Who cares about line and length ey? </p> <p>Dale Steyn next up for South Africa, and England have been given a lift with that. I don't think many people expected Philander to stick around for so long when he walked to the crease, but fair play to the lad, he's looked composed and accomplished throughout his innings. Broad has the next over...</p> <!-- Block 114 --> <p><strong>82nd over: South Africa 236-7 (Philander 42, Steyn 0)</strong> Broad with a vicious away swinger to Philander that is met with an air shot and gasps from the Lord's cognoscenti. The next ball is clipped away for a single so Steyn has the honour of facing with one remaining from the over. Here comes Broad... but Steyn just blocks away.</p> <p>John Tumbridge on Twenty20 in the Olympics: \"I would be worried about some of the more insignificant islands; Australia for example, being able to find a decent team of eleven.\"</p> <p>Meow John</p> <!-- Block 115 --> <p><strong>83rd over: South Africa 243-7 (Philander 43, Steyn 6)</strong> Fine bowling from Anderson and he beat's Philander's outside edge with a darting away swinger. Next up is a single but Philander's right boot comes off as he sets off! Don't think I have ever seen that before.</p> <p>Steyn now facing and he gets a leading edge...which runs down to third man for four, but he had no idea about it. Anderson looking frustrated and his next delivery is shorter, chipped into the air ... but safe. Seven from the over but not what it deserved.</p> <!-- Block 116 --> <p><strong>84th over: South Africa 250-7 (Philander 44, Steyn 12)</strong> Broad clatters Steyn on the pad but he had planted his front foot forward and that looked like it was high, no real appeal from England. Steyn gets a thick edge through the off side for a couple, but is completely bamboozled immediately afterwards, driving and missing. Broad then changes the line but in attempt to go right at the stumps he pushes it just outside leg and Steyn runs it down to fine leg for four. Oh blow.</p> <!-- Block 117 --> <p><strong>85th over: South Africa 251-7 (Philander 45, Steyn 12)</strong> Short one from Anderson that climbs up on Steyn, but he defends it well on his toes. It is surely only a matter of time before he nicks one behind at this rate, though Anderson is persisting with pitching it short. \"Ragged,\" according to Michael Holding. To be fair to Anderson, this is his 22nd over over the day. Last ball now and Steyn gets a thick edge, but it bounces well short of gully.</p> <!-- Block 118 --> <p><strong>86th over: South Africa 255-7 (Philander 46, Steyn 15)</strong> Average speed from Broad today has been 80.3mph, a bit slower than earlier in the summer. \"Certainly not as quick as Yohan Blake,\" jokes Atherton. HA HA HA.</p> <p>Steyn clips him off his legs with consummate ease but only single as there is a man out in the deep. The sting seems to have gone out of England's attack despite that wicket not long ago.</p> <!-- Block 119 --> <p><strong>87th over: South Africa 259-7 (Philander 46, Steyn 19)</strong> It's looking a bit overcast and dark at Lord's and one of the floodlights has decided to pack up, hopefully that can be fixed sharpish and we'll get some prolonged play this evening. Twice in two overs Steyn sticks his arm up as some plonker in the members area gets up to put his jacket on just as Anderson reaches the crease. He's sent back and starts his run-up once again but Steyn knocks a four through the leg side. That will have infuriated Anderson and, sure enough, next up is a beauty that beats the bat. Another jaffa follows and that's too good for Steyn \u2013 so much so that he's nowhere near the ball. Last of the over and it's edged ... but short of Cook at third slip.</p> <!-- Block 120 --> <p><strong>88th over: South Africa 262-7 (Philander 46, Steyn 21)</strong> Finn is back in the saddle and steaming in with renewed vigour. Steyn is struggling to see out there and he gets one in the ribs, this could be the end of action for the day as he is having a conflab with the umpires. He doesn't look happy with the light ... and sure enough the umpires lead the players off for stumps with 87.4 overs having been bowled.</p> <!-- Block 121 --> <p>6.29pm: So that's close of play at Lord's after a first day that England will certainly be happy with. They haven't bowled brilliantly but Anderson was the pick of the bunch, he ends with figures of 3-58 off 23.</p> <!-- Block 122 --> <p>6.33pm: Phil Sawyer says: \"Apparently there's been a massive power cut. TMS are now doing an emergency broadcast from what sounds like an engineering cupboard, without any access to a scoreboard to tell them what's going on. It's strangely compelling.\"</p> <!-- Block 123 --> <p>6.35pm: Credit to Duminy for a well-played 61 and somehow Dale Steyn managed a quick 21 off 32 balls as the light faded. Vernon Philander is still there on 46 \u2013 he's the man England will target early tomorrow.</p> <!-- Block 124 --> <p>6.39pm: That's it from me then folks, messrs Smyth and Bagchi will cast their expert eyes over proceedings tomorrow.</p>",

With an iffy forecast for tomorrow, the seamers really cannot afford to get it wrong here, <em>writes Scott Oliver</em>. </p> <p>Standing in their way are Durham's two veteran middle-order batsmen, Benkenstein and Collingwood, getting on for 28,000 first-class runs between them, followed by the useful Scott Borthwick, and then the bowlers: Callum Thorp (average 15.13), Matthew Wood (21.66), Chris Rushworth (10.52) and, almost certainly, Graham Onions (12.71) \u2013 the nominated replacement for Mitch Claydon \u2013 who, having been ommited from the England XI, is no doubt on his way to catch a train from St Pancras (though not the Gravy Train, rumour has it). </p> <p>If the Durham players in the hutch make their averages, they will add 85 to the 85 already on the board. 170 plus good contributions from the two incumbents and the game will be very difficult for Notts to win. A rush of wickets, and Ian Blackwell's Bears may get twitchy.</p> <!-- Block 3 --> <p>11.04am: Eyes were on Lord's at Headingley this morning, <em>reports Richard Rae</em>. England's non-selection of Tim Bresnan means the all-rounder is heading back up the M1 to take the place of the unfortunate Moin Ashraf in the Yorkshire XI, and will in all probability be batting for his county sometime after lunch. </p> <p>He will quite possibly be in the company of Andrew Hodd, who is also here because of England's selection policy. The Sussex wicketkeeper got the offer to join Yorkshire on Sunday evening, when director of cricket Martyn Moxon learned Jonathan Bairstow would be taking the place of Kevin Pietersen at Lord's.</p> <p>The word is Hodd is here on a \"try before you buy\" basis, and if he impresses over the next few weeks he will be signed. Given the amount of rain that fell on Leeds yesterday afternoon and evening it seems incredible we will start on time, but such is the case.</p> <!-- Block 4 --> <p>12.35pm: It has been a good morning for Notts thus far, taking four cheap scalps to grab the game by the proverbial scruff and reveal an ill-conceived neck tattoo of an innings from the visitors, <em>writes Scott Oliver</em>. </p> <p>Durham's three major batting luminaries are all back in the shed, with only Collingwood blameless, as he was squared up by a Fletcher delivery that bounced and left him and could only thick-edge to gully where Lumb held the first of his team's four straightforward catches.</p> <p>Benkenstein then played a flat-footed waft at the impressive Ben Phillips (although the wicket-taking delivery itself was fairly innocuous), who was in the sixth of a 10-over spell, and tellingly trudged off at Inzi pace. It was an awful shot in the context of both the game and season, not to mention the conditions and, I suppose, in absolute terms.</p> <p>Borthwick then followed, spooning limply to point off Carter, who neglected to celebrate. Atop the Radcliffe Road Stand, Nev described the flame-haired Lincolnshire paceman as \"a bowler who brings an air of vigilante farmer to proceedings, the sort of face you might see knocking at your window in the dead of night, brandishing a pitchfork and a flaming torch and asking whether you'd been enjoying sexual congress with his kin.\" Given that Nev walks in each morning from Grantham (\"as the crow flies\"), he should know. </p> <p>Thorp then slapped a wide half-volley from Phillips to cover, a shot that screamed \"My job is bowling. Get your own flaming runs!\"</p> <p>Durham are 135 for 8 and apparently in the mire (although we must remain mindful of the Boycottism about not judging pitches before both sides have batted on them). The visitors will be hoping at least to extend their innings long enough for Onions to arrive and take the new ball.</p> <!-- Block 5 --> <p>1.06pm: It's been another satisfactory first session for Yorkshire at Headingley, <em>reports Richard Rae</em>, though Adam Lyth didn't look very happy when he returned to the pavilion, the only batsman to be dismissed all morning. </p> <p>Lyth was on 93 and an apparently sure bet to reach a century when he lost concentration, reached out and steered a wide half volley from Ross Whiteley straight into the hands of point. Otherwise Gary Ballance is on 72, Anthony McGrath 18, and Yorkshire 244-3. </p> <p>With rain forecast around tea and for much of tomorrow they'll want to crack on this afternoon.</p> <!-- Block 6 --> <p>1.52pm: It is lunch at Trent Bridge, where Durham have been dismissed for 194, one hefty clump from the Promised Land of bonus points, <em>writes Scott Oliver</em>. After playing an admirable hand in a 10th-wicket stand of 50, the highest of the innings, Mark Wood (34) was the last man to go, evidently aggrieved to be adjudged to have nicked White's left-arm spin to Read the ball after the umpires had to confer over an another appeal for caught behind, Wood essaying a huge slog-sweep and the ball ricocheting up from boot (Notts felt) or ground (Umps felt) to a sprawling Read. A possibly classic case of two-wrongs-make-a-tight logic that league players the length and breadth of the land will recognise with a weary sigh. Hard to say without TV, <em>because that makes sure every decision is right...</em></p> <p>Up in the Gods, Nev's mate 'Cyclops' (rumoured to be fairly biased) reckons they were \"both bloody aaht\".</p> <p>Finally, no sign of Onions yet, except in the canteen, where the options \u2013 I kid ye not \u2013 are: Lincolnshire sausage in onion gravy; chicken, mushroom and onion pie; green veg with tiny roast shallots; roasted potatoes sprinkled with caramelised onions; and onion gravy for the chips. The only one of them I've made up is the possible onions in the pie. The rest is true. Right, just off for some onion trifle.</p> <!-- Block 7 --> <p>3.44pm: Anthony McGrath doesn't really do 'cracking on', so I should have known better than suggest such might be Yorkshire's post-lunch plan of action at Headingley, <em>writes Richard Rae</em>. </p> <p>That said, having crawled to 50 off 121 balls he has accelerated since, and goes to tea on 78 not out off 148. He's been joined by Andrew Hodd, who was stuck on 14 for the best part of an hour, and Yorkshire are on 341-5. They've used 96 overs, so have another 14 to get to 400 and a fifth batting point. </p> <p>The wickets that fell were those of Gary Ballance, who edged a Tim Groenwald delivery that left him off the pitch to the wicketkeeper for 79, and Adil Rashid, who hit a typically flaky 12 before going back to a delivery from Wes Durston that beat the outside edge and bowled him.</p> <!-- Block 8 --> <p>3.47pm: Lachrymose Notts are sobbing all over the tattered ruins of their Championship aspirations at a happily rain-free Trent Bridge, <em>writes Scott Oliver</em>. The source of their tears? Onions. Graham Onions. Fair to say he has a <em>spring</em> in his step. </p> <p>The thinking pop star's crumpet has taken all five Notts wickets to fall, two of which (Hales and Wessels) were to grubbers offering them no chance whatsoever. Adam Voges got an equally unplayable leg-cutter that castled him and, with the ball seaming just enough both ways, Lumb was undone lbw by a nip-backer from a typically probing line. Read, so often Notts' saviour, fenced uncharacteristically at a short wide ball, as soft a dismissal as Benkenstein's earlier, to leave the innings in disarray at 50 for 5.</p> <p>Paul Franks, largely out of favour this season as his bowling has lost bite, has contributed a sprightly 31 not out thus far, while Steve Mullaney has 17. At 93 for 5, with Onions out of the attack (\"one end to be batting 'ere\u201a\" reckons Nev), there is some respite for the home team, although it is perhaps not quite yet hay-making season.</p> <!-- Block 9 --> <p>5.57pm: Having brought up a fifth batting point with three deliveries to spare, and raised his 100 with the same shot, many in the crowd probably expected Anthony McGrath to head for the pavilion, <em>writes Richard Rae</em> at Headingley. Bafflingly, however, Yorkshire captain Andrew Gale elected to bat on and saw his team lose their last five wickets for nine runs in 15 balls, losing time and gaining - well, nothing really. Not that Wes Durston was complaining - the former Unicorn picked up four of those wickets to complete his first five-fer in first class cricket.<br>All out for 420, Yorkshire were left with 11 overs to try and make inroads into the Derbyshire line-up. Six of those have gone by, and neither Tim Bresnan nor Ryan Sidebottom have made a breakthrough.<br>And may I just add I was present the last time a bowler took all ten wickets in the County Championship - Ottis Gibson, for Durham against Hampshire up at Chester-Le-Street in 2008.</p> <!-- Block 10 --> <p>6.02pm: What a day for Graham Onions. He no doubt started it with everything crossed that he might get the nod for England's crucial Test match at Lord's and instead has the considerable consolation of a career-best bowling analysis of 16.3-2-67-9. </p> <p>Heaven only knows what he ate on his way up the M1 (insert onion joke from the ever-diminishing pool). Having taken the first eight to fall \u2013 four lbws, two bowled, two edged behind \u2013 and only Fletcher and Carter in his path, the smart money was on him taking all 10, repeating the feat of former teammate Ottis Gibson, who took 10 for 47 against Hampshre at Chester-le-Street in 2007, the last man to achieve the feat in English first-class cricket. </p> <p>However, it's not for nothing that Lily Allen has a crush on him, and the 10-fer was to be denied him by his own hand when he brilliantly threw down the stumps at the bowler's end from short fine leg to run out a lumbering Luke Fletcher. </p> <p>He then used the 3-card trick of bouncer (striking the helmet), even nastier bouncer, stump-splattering yorker to knock over Andy Carter in the most emphatic fashion and earn himself a beer. A good day so far, and the night is still young \u2026</p> <!-- Block 11 --> <p>6.37pm: And that's it for the county liveblog for the day, with Graham Onions' heroics for Durham the undoubted highlight.

  "<p>Immigrant rights groups are gearing up for a legal and political fight in Arizona after the state's hardline Republican governor issued an order that bans young immigrants, spared deportation under a new federal initiative, from getting driver's licences and other state benefits.</p> <p>Jan Brewer, the state governor, is determined to curtail the rights of people in her state who qualify for the new rules, which give young undocumented migrants the right to work and spares them from the threat of deportation.</p> <p>The Referred Action for Childhood Arrivals scheme, which came into force on Wednesday, is expected to benefit more than one million people under 30 who can prove they arrived in the United States before they turned 16.</p> <p>Tens of thousands of undocumented youths have thronged to information events held across the United States in the past two days hoping to benefit from an executive order issued by Barack Obama that gives them the right to work and spares them from the threat of deportation.</p> <p>But in Arizona, as many immigrants in the state celebrated their newfound eligibility for a reprieve from the threat of deportation, Brewer signed an executive order on Wednesday directing state agencies to deprive them of ID cards, such as driver's licences, and healthcare benefits.</p> <p>The edict stated that \"allowing more than an estimated 80,000 Deferred Action recipients improper access to state and local public benefits\" would have \"significant and lasting impacts on the Arizona budget its healthcare system and additional public benefits that Arizona taxpayers fund\".</p> <p>As such, she ordered that \"the issuance of Deferred Action employment authorisation documents to unlawfully present aliens does not confer upon them any lawful or authorised status and does now entitle them to any additional public benefit\".</p> <p>A spokesman for Brewer told the Arizona Republic that the executive order was designed to clarify that the new federal guidelines do not give lawful status to individuals eligible under the scheme.</p> <p>But campaign groups said the decision to make the order on a day when hundreds of thousands of young people were celebrating was mean-spirited and smacked of politicking. \"She has stuck her nose in for political reasons and has become the skunk at the garden party,\" said Frank Sharry, executive director of America's Voice, an advocacy group promoting immigration reform.</p> <p>The federal scheme is open to undocumented immigrants under the age of 30 who can prove they arrived in the United States before they turned 16. Those living in the country at least five years and are in school, have graduated or served in the military can apply for work permits. The initiative is designed to help hundreds of thousands of young people on the way to citizenship. Obama signed the order earlier this year after the Dream Act, which he supports, stalled in Congress.</p> <p>Many of those left frustrated by the Brewer's counter-measure descended on the state capitol on Wednesday in protest against the executive order. Local <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TheADAC/status/235917503828746240/photo/1\">reports suggest that up to 200 people took part in the protest</a>, organised by the Arizona Dream Act Coalition.</p> <p>Advocacy groups are preparing for a possible courtroom battle against the executive order. \"There will no doubt be a battle fought on legal grounds as well as legislative and political,\" Sharry said.</p> <p>As the order came into force on Wednesday, huge crowds flocked to events designed to give information to potential applicants. Forms must be submitted by mail, and there is no appeal from rejected applications, so it is important that those who wish to record their status get their documents in order.</p> <p>In Chicago, some 13,000 people lined up for a workshop led by immigrant rights advocates on how to file the paperwork for their new status. It was a similar scene in Los Angeles. \"It's something I have been waiting for since I was two years old,\" said Bupendra Ram, a 25-year-old communications graduate student in Fullerton, California: \"This offers us an opportunity to fulfill the dreams I've had since I was a child.\"</p> <p>Of the one million people expected to file an application under the first year of the new guidelines, the department of homeland security estimates about 890,000 will be eligible.</p>",
  "<p>The standoff between Britain and Ecuador has raised the prospect of a major diplomatic incident <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/aug/15/uk-arrest-julian-assange-wikileaks-ecuador\" title=\"\">if British police force an entry into the building</a>.</p> <p>Ecuadorian officials say that any such decision would be an outrageous breach of international law. British officials insist that if they did so, it would be within British law.</p> <p>Under international law, security forces across the world are not allowed to enter an embassy without the express permission of the ambassador \u2013 even though the embassy remains the territory of the host nation. The 1961 Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations codified the \"rule of inviolability\", which all nations observe because their own diplomatic missions are otherwise at risk elsewhere.</p> <p>However, the Foreign Office told Ecuador that it had the power to revoke the embassy's diplomatic status under the Diplomatic and Consular Premises Act 1987. This act was passed by Parliament in the wake of the Libyan embassy crisis three years before, when <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/yvonne-fletcher\" title=\"\">PC Yvonne Fletcher was shot dead</a> from inside the embassy.</p> <p>Such a step might set a dangerous precedent by encouraging other governments to justify entering embassies to arrest dissidents seeking diplomatic asylum.</p> <p>If Ecuador challenged a revocation, ministers would have to argue at the high court that the mission, by harbouring Assange, had itself fallen foul of international law. The government used the power in 1988 to deal with squatters in the Cambodian embassy.</p> <p>The 1961 convention stresses that missions must respect local laws and not interfere in the host nation's internal affairs. The Metropolitan police says it has the power and right to arrest Assange for breach of bail if he steps outside the embassy.They have also delivered a letter to the embassy demanding that Assange surrender himself.</p> <p>A legal source at the Ecuador embassy claimed yesterday that the 1987 Act was established to stop a major threat such as terrorism or a nuclear threat.</p> <p>\"The law was established after the shooting of a police officer and would be invoked if the public are under threat. In this case, no one could argue that Assange's presence in this embassy is a threat to the British public,\" the source said.</p>",
  "<p>When Paul Ryan arrives in Tampa Bay on his first visit as the newly announced junior half of Mitt Romney's White House ticket this weekend, he will feel the heat. But it won't be anything to do with Florida's blistering summer temperatures. </p> <p>Instead, he faces a barrage of awkward questions over his much-publicised and controversial plans for the future of the nation's healthcare programme for retirees, and demands for proof from many among the state's 3 million plus seniors that he is not, in fact, the Republican Party's devil in disguise.</p> <p>Since Romney tapped the Wisconsin congressman last Saturday as his running mate for November's presidential election, the political debate in Florida over the nomination has centered on one issue \u2013 Medicare.</p> <p>To many, Ryan is one of two things: the conservative architect of a budget-slashing master plan that will effectively kill off the existing system and leave the elderly carrying the can for the cost of their own healthcare; or the brilliant tactician behind an overdue and enduring reconstruction of the popular social welfare programme that has the additional benefit of helping reduce the burgeoning national debt.</p> <p>Whoever you believe, his comments at a $2,500-a-head Republican fundraiser on Treasure Island, near Tampa, on Saturday, and at a rally for supporters in the Villages, a sprawling complex for well-heeled retireees 100 miles to the north, earlier in the day, could define the race for Florida's 29 electoral college votes and determine whether he helps Romney's chances in the state or hinders them.</p> <p>\"Any talk of changing Medicare or making cutbacks is a scary thing for seniors in Florida and for those approaching retirement age. It'll be up to Ryan and Romney to respond to those attacks and repeat their message over and over,\" said Aubrey Jewett, professor of political science at the University of Central Florida and a co-author of the book Politics in Florida.</p> <p>Jewett points out that John McCain, the losing Republican candidate in the 2008 general election, scored a significantly higher share of the vote from Florida seniors than Barack Obama and that Romney starts off with a solid core of support.</p> <p>\"One of the pluses [of the Ryan pick] is it will help the conservative base rally more enthusiasm about him than Romney. In that sense the base was always going to turn out for Romney, not because they like him, but Ryan can help motivate that base.\"</p> <p>With more than 3.3 million voters over 65, and senior citizens making up 17.3% of its population according to the 2010 census, Florida has an older electorate than any other state. In fact, more than half its registered voters are over 50 so it was inevitable that the candidates' policies on healthcare would become a central plank of the election debate.</p> <p>A survey this month by the American Association of Retired Persons (AARP) showed that 48% of respondents aged 50 to 64 and nearing retirement worried about unaffordable health expenses and that 63% said they felt neither Obama nor Romney had made a good job of explaining their plans for Medicare.</p> <p>\"The message from voters 50-plus is clear,\" said Nancy LeaMond, executive vice-president of the AARP, in a statement. \"In a razor-tight election, candidates have a major opportunity to reach key voters by speaking about their plans on Social Security and Medicare, and they are making a huge gamble if they ignore them.\"</p> <p>Senior Florida Democrats wasted little time after Saturday's announcement in attacking Ryan over his \"Path to Prosperity\" budget, particularly his plan for a gradual conversion of Medicare from a costly federal programme into a voucher-based private system.</p> <p>\"Ryan is the architect of Romney's extreme budget plan which would end Medicare as we know it, increasing the healthcare costs for Florida's seniors by thousands every year,\" said Rod Smith, chairman of the Florida Democratic Party.</p> <p>\"Romney and Ryan share a vision for America where the wealthiest few are prioritised over the middle class, students and seniors. That's not a vision which will move our state or country forward, and it is a vision which Floridians will wholeheartedly reject.\"</p> <p>Smith's views cut little ice with Irving Rabiner, a 69-year-old retired retail worker from Delray Beach and a registered Republican voter who believes Ryan was the perfect choice. \"Some of the old people started getting scared by the Democrats' lies, that their money will be taken away from them,\" he said. \"What they need to do is sit down and look at what this really says, that nobody over 55 will have anything done to their Medicare. Attacking Ryan and Romney over this is the only chance the Democrats have got, they can't muster anything else other than attacking Romney for that fake banking stuff.\"</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-394821367\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/16/1345133266566/romney-campaign-florida-010.jpg\" alt=\"romney campaign florida\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A woman at a Romney campaign event in Miami on Monday reminds the candidate of another key topic among Florida voters. Photograph: Michele Eve/Corbis</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Michele Eve/Corbis</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Republican strategists, too, are convinced that Ryan can handle any attack directed at him from Obama supporters in Florida, where his mother was revealed this week to be a condo-dwelling resident on Medicare in the small oceanfront town of Lauderdale-by-the Sea. \"If he pushes back as he has done, and as he is uniquely qualified to do, then Medicare quickly collapses as an argument for them,\" said Rick Wilson, a Tallahassee-based political consultant.</p> <p>\"Ryan is a young, articulate, smart conservative. He's going to be down here a lot, and there is no fear over putting him in front of a room full of seniors. Florida's seniors are concerned over Obamacare, they don't like it and it's never polled well, and over 58% opposed it. So this is not a conversation being held in a vacuum. There are other issues. Economic concerns drive voter behaviour.\"</p> <p>Among the other issues to have gained headlines in Florida since Ryan's nomination was his stance on Cuba, and his support a decade ago for the lifting of the US trade embargo with the communist country.</p> <p>More than 70% of Miami's registered Republican voters are Cuban-American and most favour the embargo, so Romney, in the city earlier this week, sought to assure them that Ryan changed his views many years ago and voted in 2007 for maintaining restrictions.</p> <p>\"A lot has been made of that,\" said Dan Smith, professor of political science at the University of Florida. \"The Obama campaign will choose Ryan's comments from as late as 2009 saying we should open trade with Cuba, and will be running Spanish-language ads in south Florida to soften support for Romney.</p> <p>\"Younger Cuban-Americans don't see the embargo as importantly as their parents or grandparents, and Romney will be making efforts to court those younger voters.\"</p> <p>Smith added that another factor in Florida voters' minds will be that state's unemployment and foreclosure rates remain among the highest in the nation. \"It's still the economy driving the Florida narrative but the Ryan budget helped to change that narrative,\" he said.</p> <p>Jewett, the University of Central Florida analyst, agrees. \"The polls in Florida are very close and I would expect it to stay that way,\" he said. \"In the long term, the focus won't be on Ryan so much, but you can be sure the Democrats will be bringing up the Ryan plan over and over.\"</p>",

  "<p>The prospect of police breaking into the Ecuadorean embassy in London any time soon to arrest Julian Assange and extradite him to Sweden for questioning on allegations of sexual offences does not seem very imminent.</p> <p>Despite the dramatic announcement on Thursday by Ecuador's foreign minister, Ricardo Pati\u00f1o, that his <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/aug/16/julian-assange-political-asylum-ecuador\" title=\"\">country granted asylum to the WikiLeaks founder</a>, little in reality has changed. Assange is unable to leave the embassy as he would still face immediate arrest.</p> <p>Instead, the latest episode of the Assange stalemate is only responsible for a deepening <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/aug/16/julian-assange-ecuador-embassy-asylum\" title=\"\">diplomatic row between the UK and Ecuador</a>, with London claiming it has a \"legal duty to extradite\" Assange and Ecuador claiming that means London is threatening to break in and grab the Australian.</p> <p>With both sides boxed into their respective corners what is likely in the short term, as legal experts have been quick to make clear, is recourse again to the courts.</p> <p>What have changed significantly, however, are the diplomatic implications, less importantly for Britain's relationship with Ecuador, than for the fact that London will want to avoid setting an international precedent that might be used one day against one of its own missions abroad. But the British government is facing a catch-22 situation, being equally anxious \u2013 as former diplomat <a href=\"http://www.lrb.co.uk/blog/2012/08/16/oliver-miles/why-havent-they-asked-for-him/\" title=\"\">Oliver Miles pointed out in the London Review of Books</a> \u2013 to avoid setting the opposing precedent of allowing Assange to remain as a fugitive within the embassy in defiance of a European arrest warrant.</p> <p>This very prospect was raised by Britain's former ambassador to Moscow, Tony Brenton, in an interview with the BBC.</p> <p>\"I think the Foreign Office have slightly overreached themselves here,\" he said. \"If we live in a world where governments can arbitrarily revoke immunity and go into embassies then the life of our diplomats and their ability to conduct normal business in places like Moscow, where I was, and North Korea becomes close to impossible.\"</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/aug/16/julian-assange-ecuador-embassy-asylum-live#block-502cd7d495cb03723d6abd04\" title=\"\">letter sent by the British embassy</a> in Quito to the Ecuadorean government \u2013 and disclosed by Ecuador \u2013 makes reference to the \"legal base\" under which the British government believes it could arrest Assange. It refers specifically to the Diplomatic and Consular Premises Act 1987, a dry and technical piece of legislation governing the law of how ministers should handle the designation of both diplomatic premises and former premises. Indeed, it has been used before to evict squatters from a Cambodian embassy building.</p> <p>Significantly, it details how \u2013 although not in what circumstances save for issues of public safety and national security \u2013 the foreign secretary can \"de-recognise\" a mission. Ecuador has said it would regard such an act as \"hostile and intolerable\".</p> <p>\"You need to be aware,\" the letter says, \"that there is a legal base in the UK, the Diplomatic and Consular Premises Act 1987, that would allow us to take actions in order to arrest Mr Assange in the current premises of the embassy.</p> <p>\"We sincerely hope that we do not reach that point, but if you are not capable of resolving this matter of Mr Assange's presence in your premises, this is an open option for us.\"</p> <p>As law lecturer <a href=\"http://www.headoflegal.com/2012/08/15/julian-assange-can-the-uk-withdraw-diplomatic-status-from-the-ecuadorian-embassy/\" title=\"\">Carl Gardner blogged on Wednesday</a>, while the act gives ministers the \"power of de-recognition\" \u2014 which would allow Assange's arrest in the embassy regardless of whether Ecuador grants him asylum \u2013 quite how that process could play out is uncertain.</p> <p>According to that law, \"the secretary of state [can] withdraw his acceptance or consent in relation to land\", meaning \"it&#xa0;\u2026 ceases to be diplomatic or consular premises for the purposes of all enactments and rules of law\".</p> <p>The catch, however, is to be found in the following section, which states that any de-recognition must be consistent with international law \u2013 in this case the 1961 Vienna convention on diplomatic relations which Ecuadorean sources at the embassy say they have acted in accordance with.</p> <p>In other words, any attempt to de-recognise the embassy would in all likelihood need to be tested in the courts or by judicial review, a costly and lengthy process.</p> <p>The same point was made by lawyer and New Statesman legal blogger David Allen Green.</p> <p>\"As the UK government will be purporting to be exercising a statutory provision \u2013 in this case a power under the Diplomatic and Consular Premises Act 1987 \u2013 then any executive action is in principle amenable to the jurisdiction of the high court for judicial review. Here it would be Ecuador challenging the UK government in a case that would raise complex points of domestic and international public law.\"</p> <p>What is not clear, either from the act itself or the letter, is on what grounds the British government would feel it had for de-recognition to allow Assange's arrest, although the letter makes clear that the Foreign Office believes Ecuador is in breach of the 1961 Vienna convention.</p> <p>One possibility is that the British government could attempt to invoke the convention's preamble, which insists that the specific purpose of \"the immunities and privileges\" that it lists are \"not to benefit individuals but to ensure the efficient performance of the functions of diplomatic missions as representing states\".</p> <p>That argument has not been tried before in the few instances where people have sought refuge in embassies.</p> <p>However the convention \u2013 while accepting that the UK can declare members of the mission, or all of them, persona non grata \"without explanation\" \u2014 also insists in Article 22: \"The premises of the mission shall be inviolable. The agents of the receiving state may not enter them, except with the consent of the head of the mission.\"</p> <p>And so Assange stays put for now.</p>",
  "<p>\"It's really hot but it's got air-conditioning,\" says Doom, when asked if his mask might make things a bit stuffy on a hot day like today. \"It sits a little bit away from my face,\" he adds, and this is important because it means he can still drink beer during the interview. \"That,\" he adds with a chuckle, \"is the main thing.\"</p> <p>Daniel Dumile, AKA Doom, might have a reputation as hip-hop's harvester of sorrow, but right now, he couldn't be happier. Living in London, as he has for two years, allows him to escape his past. \"I spent 35 years growing up in the US, and it had its ups and downs,\" he says, brightly, \"but this is a new place for me. I have no friends here apart from the dudes at my record label, and I didn't go to school with no one. Nobody knows me \u2013 I'm incognito. It's all new, all fun.\"</p> <p>The rap outsider does have some friends in the capital. There are cameos from <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2011/mar/17/thom-yorke-collaboration-rapper-doom\" title=\"\">Thom Yorke</a>, Damon Albarn and Beth Gibbons of Portishead on his latest album, Key to the Kuffs, a superb collaboration with experimental producer Jneiro Jarel. The high-profile guests are a sign of the regard in which he's held: unusually for someone who has been in the game for more than two decades, his current work is as eagerly lapped up as his \"classics\". He&#xa0;is the only Golden Age rapper to have figured high in lists of <a href=\"http://blog.rhapsody.com/2009/10/hiphopdecade.html\" title=\"\">albums of the noughties</a> \u2013 his team-up with <a href=\"http://observer.guardian.co.uk/omm/reviews/story/0,13875,1219526,00.html\" title=\"\">producer Madlib for 2004's Madvillainy</a> was considered by many to be the decade's best.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-audio\" data-canonical-url=\"https://player.soundcloud.com/player.swf?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Fplaylists%2F2356624%3Fsecret_token%3Ds-5CDfN&amp;amp;show_comments=true&amp;amp;auto_play=false&amp;amp;show_playcount=true&amp;amp;show_artwork=true&amp;amp;color=000000\"> <object height=\"360\" width=\"100%\"> <param name=\"movie\" value=\"https://player.soundcloud.com/player.swf?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Fplaylists%2F2356624%3Fsecret_token%3Ds-5CDfN&amp;show_comments=true&amp;auto_play=false&amp;show_playcount=true&amp;show_artwork=true&amp;color=000000\"></param> <param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\"></param> <embed allowscriptaccess=\"always\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://player.soundcloud.com/player.swf?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Fplaylists%2F2356624%3Fsecret_token%3Ds-5CDfN&amp;show_comments=true&amp;auto_play=false&amp;show_playcount=true&amp;show_artwork=true&amp;color=000000\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" width=\"100%\"></embed> </object>   <span>JJ DOOM 'KEY TO THE KUFFS' ALBUM PREVIEW by <a href=\"http://soundcloud.com/lexrecords\">LexRecords</a></span> </figure>  <p>He plays down his heavy reputation, saying: \"Really, it's about the wordplay, the beat choices and the songwriting skills.\" But he can see how he acquired it. His early career, as a member of New York trio KMD, peers of the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Native_Tongues\" title=\"\">Native Tongues</a> posse, foundered when his brother \u2013 KMD's Dingilizwe \"Subroc\" Dumile \u2013 was killed in a traffic accident in 1993. After run-ins with his record company over the <a href=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_NN9CR1aNmvc/TBJ1ircV38I/AAAAAAAAArY/FWUe0ZBEOJk/s1600/kmd.jpg\" title=\"\">title and sleeve</a> of their second album Black Bastards, he went to ground, apparently spending the next five years living rough in New York. He re-emerged in 1999 for the album Operation: Doomsday as MF Doom, a character based on Marvel comics supervillain Dr&#xa0;Doom, sporting a metal-face (hence \"MF\") mask. A series of critically acclaimed albums, either as MF Doom or under other guises including King Geedorah and Viktor Vaughn, culminated in Madvillainy, and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2005/oct/14/popandrock.shopping5\" title=\"\">DangerDoom</a>, a 2005 collaboration with Brian Burton, alias Danger Mouse. By this point Dumile had accrued near-mythic status, to the extent that he was featured on the cover of a magazine alongside the title The Mask of Sorrow, the attendant interview trailed as \"the saddest hip-hop story ever told\".</p> <p>\"I don't think it's a sad story at all \u2013 it's really a story of success,\" he says. \"About how you can come from the bottom and be raised to the highest levels you can imagine.\" As for the idea of the avenging angel confronting an industry that mistreated him, and a world that robbed him of his sibling, this is a journalistic conceit, not a carefully cultivated persona.</p> <p>\"Doom is a classic supervillain, akin&#xa0;to the Phantom of the Opera,\" he explains. \"It's not about revenge so much as like: 'I'm back \u2013 now watch this!' It all boils down to the music. The mask is a slight theme, for people to enjoy, and it adds mystery.\"</p> <p>Doom's music has always been murky, his samples dusty from all those <a href=\"http://www.cratekings.com\" title=\"\">crates</a>, his voice gruff, his raps torrential bursts of elliptical wordplay too dense and jerkily delivered to be described as \"flow\", but it's not as forbidding as the metal face suggests. People, he says, miss the humour in his work, and the delight in mischief-making. A couple of years ago, he allegedly sent <a href=\"http://www.futureproducers.com/forums/music-genres/rap-hip-hop-r-b/mf-doom-sends-fake-impersonators-216220/\" title=\"\">\"fake\" Dooms</a> to perform on his behalf at gigs. Even the hardcore faithful were incensed, when really it was an inspired device designed to subvert the notion of rap ego.</p> <p>There is humour of the trenchant kind on Key to the Kuffs, with colloquial allusions to Blighty in Rhymin' Slang and Guv'nor, the odd reference to the likes of My Big Fat Gypsy Wedding, and songs about everything from selling out (Bite the Thong) to <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2010/sep/14/seasonal-affective-disorder-stigma\" title=\"\">seasonal affective disorder</a> (Winter Blues). This track also expresses the feelings of longing experienced by Doom, or rather Dumile, an ocean away&#xa0;from his wife. He compares its marvellous murk to Marvin Gaye.</p> <p>\"It's not about sexual intercourse,\" he laughs. \"It's like an old-school love song, about someone who feels: 'I&#xa0;need&#xa0;to touch you.'\"</p> <p>Has Mrs Doom heard it? \"She loves it,\" he says, and one imagines him smiling beneath the mask. \"It's her favourite song.\"</p> <p>He considers Key to the Kuffs a departure, even by his standards. There is even a track called Wash Your Hands, about germs. Does Doom have OCD? \"Doom can be paranoid, conspiracy-laden, super-sensitive and, yes, OCD-esque,\" he replies with a chuckle. \"They're all aspects of the character's character. But I don't judge him. I just watch him.\"</p> <p>Credited to JJ Doom (Jarel handles the loops and mangled electronics, Doom the complex verbiage), Key to the Kuffs details Doom's arrival and extended stay in the UK during which the supervillain \"did his best to blend in\", as the track Borin' Convo has it, dealing with the pressures, temptations and pitfalls of life in&#xa0;London.</p> <p>The US underground/alternative hip-hop maven was actually born in the capital (his parents, originally from Rhodesia and Trinidad, emigrated to the States when he was a baby), which is why he has a British passport. He moved here after a mix-up at customs in America, during which he was refused entry back into the country in which he's resided for most of his 41 years. Mention of this prompts a 10-minute rant about airport authorities, although you can see his point \u2013 his contact with his wife and three children has been reduced to Skype communiques and the occasional visit.</p> <p>\"It's red tape, or whatever,\" he says, flustered. \"Do I have a green card? I don't know about that shit.\"</p> <p>Still, even alienation from his family and homeland can't darken his mood. Is he always this cheery? Is Doom not in touch with the anguish he must have felt in the wake of the events of the early 90s?</p> <p>\"We all go through things in our lives,\" he muses. \"I'm trying to promote that way of thinking. Instead of thinking about things as happy or sad, I see them as events and experiences. You have to step back and be neutral. Am I the same guy now as I was then? Nah, I'm the same. Motherfuckers called me Doom&#xa0;then! I just didn't have the mask yet.\"</p> <p>Doom is in an enviable position. The rapper/producer emerged alongside the sampladelic likes of De La Soul, but the music he's making now is likely to be assessed alongside the latest leftfield electronica.</p> <p>\"Who do I consider my peer group?\" he ponders, before heading back into the sun, mask on face and beer in hand. \"To me there is no time dimension. There's just an ever-expanding now now now now now. When I listen to hip-hop I listen to Just Ice, Boogie Down Productions, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t_vSGkS3tCQ\" title=\"\">Ultramagnetic MCs</a>. I grew up in that age, and it was memorable. But I'm down with all of it. Chuck D or <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2012/apr/02/new-band-danny-brown\" title=\"\">Danny Brown</a>? I feel comfortable with all of them. Word up, kid! Word up, man!\"</p> <p><em>Key to the Kuffs is released on 20&#xa0;August by Lex</em></p>",
  "<p>Ecuador has now made its decision: to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/aug/16/julian-assange-ecuador-embassy-asylum-live#block-502ce9b8b579b8532ead409f\" title=\"\">grant political asylum to Julian Assange</a>. This comes in the wake of an incident that should dispel remaining doubts about the motives behind the UK/Swedish attempts to extradite WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange. On Wednesday, the UK government made an unprecedented <a href=\"http://www.ecuadorembassyuk.org.uk/announcements/ecuador-shock-at-threats-from-british-government\" title=\"\">threat to invade Ecuador's embassy if Assange is not handed over</a>. Such an assault would be so extreme in violating international law and diplomatic conventions that it is difficult to even find an example of a democratic government even making such a threat, let alone carrying it out.</p> <p>When Ecuadorian foreign minister Ricardo Pati\u00f1o, in an angry and defiant response, released the written threats to the public, the UK government tried to backtrack and say it wasn't a threat to invade the embassy (which is another country's sovereign territory). But what else can we possibly make of this wording <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2188946/UK-Government-extradite-Wikileaks-boss-Julian-Assange.html\" title=\"\">from a letter delivered by a British official</a>?</p> <blockquote> <p>\"You need to be aware that there is a legal base in the UK, the Diplomatic and Consular Premises Act 1987, that would allow us to take actions in order to arrest Mr Assange in the current premises of the embassy. We sincerely hope that we do not reach that point, but if you are not capable of resolving this matter of Mr Assange's presence in your premises, this is an open option for us.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Is there anyone in their right mind who believes that the UK government would make such an unprecedented threat if this were just about an ordinary foreign citizen wanted for questioning \u2013 not criminal charges or a trial \u2013 by a foreign government?</p> <p>Ecuador's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/aug/16/julian-assange-ecuador-embassy-asylum-live#block-502ce9b8b579b8532ead409f\" title=\"\">decision to grant political asylum to Assange</a> was both predictable and reasonable. But it is also a ground-breaking case that has considerable historic significance.</p> <p>First, the merits of the case: Assange clearly has a well-founded fear of persecution if he were to be extradited to Sweden. It is pretty much acknowledged that he would be immediately thrown in jail. Since he is not charged with any crime, and the Swedish government has no legitimate reason to bring him to Sweden, this by itself is a form of persecution.</p> <p>We can infer that the Swedes have no legitimate reason for the extradition, since they were repeatedly offered the opportunity to question him in the UK, but rejected it, and have also refused to even put forth a reason for this refusal. A few weeks ago the Ecuadorian government offered to allow Assange to be questioned in its London embassy, where Assange has been residing since 19 June, but the Swedish government refused \u2013 again without offering a reason. This was an act of bad faith in the negotiating process that has taken place between governments to resolve the situation.</p> <p>Former Stockholm chief district prosecutor Sven-Erik Alhem also made it clear that the Swedish government had no legitimate reason to seek Assange's extradition when he testified that the decision of the Swedish government to extradite Assange is \"<a href=\"http://www.scribd.com/doc/48396086/Assange-Case-Opionion-Sven-Erik-Alhem\" title=\"\">unreasonable and unprofessional, as well as unfair and disproportionate</a>\", because he could be easily questioned in the UK.</p> <p>But, most importantly, the government of Ecuador agreed with Assange that he had a reasonable fear of a second extradition to the United States, and persecution here for his activities as a journalist. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/jun/20/julian-assange-right-asylum\" title=\"\">The evidence</a> for this <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/aug/02/julian-assange-right-fear-prosecution\" title=\"\">was strong</a>. Some examples: an ongoing investigation of Assange and WikiLeaks in the US; evidence that an indictment had already been prepared; statements by important public officials such as Democratic senator Diane Feinstein that he should be prosecuted for espionage, which carries a potential death penalty or life imprisonment.</p> <p>Why is this case so significant? It is probably the first time that a citizen fleeing political persecution by the US has been granted political asylum by a democratic government seeking to uphold international human rights conventions. This is a pretty big deal, because for more than 60 years the US has portrayed itself as a proponent of human rights internationally \u2013 especially during the cold war. And many people have sought and received asylum in the US.</p> <p>The idea of the US government as a human rights defender, which was believed mostly in the US and allied countries, was premised on a disregard for the human rights of the victims of US wars and foreign policy, such as the 3 million Vietnamese or <a href=\"http://www.justforeignpolicy.org/iraq\" title=\"\">more than one million Iraqis</a> who were killed, and millions of others displaced, wounded, or abused because of US actions. That idea \u2013 that the US should be judged only on what it does within its borders \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2009/mar/11/state-department-human-rights\" title=\"\">is losing support</a> as the world grows more multipolar economically and politically, Washington loses power and influence, and its wars, invasions, and occupations are seen by fewer people as legitimate.</p> <p>At the same time, over the past decade, the US's own human rights situation has deteriorated. Of course prior to the civil rights legislation of the 1960s, millions of African-Americans in the southern states didn't have the right to vote, and lacked other civil rights \u2013 and the consequent international embarrassment was part of what allowed the civil rights movement to succeed. But at least by the end of that decade, the US could be seen as a positive example internally in terms of the rule of law, due process and the protection of civil rights and liberties.</p> <p>Today, the US claims the legal right <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/is-the-united-states-still-the-land-of-the-free/2012/01/04/gIQAvcD1wP_story.html\" title=\"\">to indefinitely detain its citizens</a>; the president can order the assassination of a citizen without so much as even a hearing; the government can spy on its citizens without a court order; and its officials are immune from prosecution for war crimes. It doesn't help that the US has less than 5% of the world's population but almost a quarter of its prison inmates, many of them victims of a \"war on drugs\" that is <a href=\"http://www.globalcommissionondrugs.org/reports/\" title=\"\">rapidly losing legitimacy</a> in the rest of the world. Assange's successful pursuit of asylum from the US is another blow to Washington's international reputation. At the same time, it shows how important it is to have democratic governments that are independent of the US and \u2013 unlike Sweden and the UK \u2013 will not collaborate in the persecution of a journalist for the sake of expediency. Hopefully other governments will let the UK know that threats to invade another country's embassy put them outside the bounds of law-abiding nations.</p> <p>It is interesting to watch pro-Washington journalists and their sources look for self-serving reasons that they can attribute to the government of Ecuador for granting asylum. Correa wants to portray himself as a champion of free speech, they say; or he wants to strike a blow to the US, or put himself forward as an international leader. But this is ridiculous.</p> <p>Correa didn't want this mess and it has been a lose-lose situation for him from the beginning. He has suffered increased tension with three countries that are diplomatically important to Ecuador \u2013 the US, UK and Sweden. The US is Ecuador's largest trading partner and has several times threatened to cut off trade preferences that support thousands of Ecuadorian jobs. And since most of the major international media has been hostile to Assange from the beginning, they have used the asylum request to attack Ecuador, accusing the government of a \"crackdown\" on the media at home. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2010/jan/08/ecuador-press-freedom-media\" title=\"\">As I have noted elsewhere</a>, this is a gross exaggeration <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/jul/21/rights-groups-lost-plot-ecuador\" title=\"\">and misrepresentation of Ecuador</a>, which has an uncensored media that is mostly opposed to the government. And for most of the world, these misleading news reports are all that they will hear or read about Ecuador for a long time.</p> <p>Correa made this decision because it was the only ethical thing to do. And any of the independent, democratic governments of South America would have done the same. If only the world's biggest media organisations had the same ethics and commitment to freedom of speech and the press.</p> <p>Now we will see if the UK government will respect international law and human rights conventions and allow Assange safe passage to Ecuador.</p>",
  "<p>When I was a little girl, a long time ago, we would go camping in the Black Hills of South Dakota. We had to pay, just as tourists do, to camp there and enjoy the beauty of the Black Hills or, in Lakota, of the Paha Sapa&#xa0;or He Sapa. When I say we had to pay, I always remember someone griping about having to pay to camp in our sacred hills.&#xa0;But perhaps the way we enjoyed the Black Hills was a little different than the way the average tourist experienced them.</p> <p>We felt at home, at peace, as content as a soul could feel, unless, otherwise, in heaven. We were taught to walk with care among the soft pine-needle beds and treat every living being from the smallest of creatures to the tallest of trees with respect. We breathed deeply of the pine-scented air and appreciated how the sun would find us, even through the thick veil of trees. We were taught how to pray and give thanks there,&#xa0;and as children, we ran and played among the hills without fear.</p> <p>Even to this day, you can ask any member of the Oceti Sakowin, or Sioux Nation, how their hearts feel when in the Black Hills: there, they find a mood of melancholy and an inner peace that some people seek all their lives.</p> <p>And then, we would go home to the reservation. What some people on the reservations refer to as modern-day prison camps that were given to us after the United States whittled Indian land down to only nine reservations from the whole western half of South Dakota and parts of Nebraska, Wyoming, Montana, and North Dakota, which was the territory originally negotiated in the <a href=\"http://www.archives.gov/education/lessons/sioux-treaty/\">Fort Laramie Treaty</a> of 1868. The reservations broke up all the bands of the Sioux Nation; some say this was part of a campaign to weaken us.</p> <p>Our reservation has been in the news many times for the poverty and deprivation that most people are shocked to find exist right here in America. So, for us to go from the beautiful Sacred Paha Sapa back to the reservation was always a downer.&#xa0;Especially when you learned from your parents that not only are the Black Hills sacred and that they belong to us, but they were stolen by the United States after the discovery of gold.</p> <p>The Fort Laramie Treaty granted the Black Hills to the Sioux Nation, and prohibited white settlement of the land. At first, in his <a href=\"http://lbha.org/?tag=lakota-war\">exploratory expedition in July 1874</a>, General Custer deemed the Black Hills worthless \u2013 maybe good for agriculture but \"infested with Indians\". That assessment changed, just weeks later, when gold was discovered in the hills, in August of 1874.</p> <p>The Sioux peoples' treaty rights were constantly violated by gold prospectors, who kept crossing the reservation border. When they were attacked by our people defending their land, the United States government seized the Black Hills, in 1877 \u2013 illegally. This occurred just one year after Custer and the 7th Cavalry were defeated at the Battle of Greasy Grass, in which our ancestors were defending their land and their way of life. And so the Black Hills were stolen from us.</p> <p>The battle for the Black Hills has been going on ever since, for as long as I can remember. Nearly a century after the expropriation, in 1975, the US court of claims described the US government's conduct thus:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"A more ripe and rank case of dishonorable dealings will never, in all probability, be found in our history.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>But it wasn't until June 1980, in the case&#xa0;United States v Sioux Nation of Indians, that the United States supreme court upheld an award of $15.5m for the market value of the land in 1877, along with 103 years worth of interest at 5%, for an additional $105m in damages. Today, that sum is over $1bn \u2013 and remains untouched <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2007/aug/19/usa.features\"> \u2013 as Paul Harris called it in the Observer, in 2007</a>, \"a heroic, some might say unfathomable, act of defiance\". In the same article, my mother explained:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"They should not touch it [the financial compensation]. Then white America will never own the Black Hills.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>But we are tired of waiting for the government to come through, realize they are in the wrong and restore our land rights. We are tired of the promises: our President Barack Obama gave us hope in 2009 by telling the Native American population that \"You deserve to have a voice\", and \"You will not be forgotten as long as I'm in this White House.\" We hadn't received a presidential nod like that since President Clinton \u2013 and we had hope.</p> <p>Just this year, United Nations&#xa0;special rapporteur&#xa0;James Anaya&#xa0;conducted a 12-day tour of Native American land, to determine how the United States&#xa0;is faring on the&#xa0;<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Declaration_on_the_Rights_of_Indigenous_Peoples\">United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples</a>, a survey endorsed by the Obama administration&#xa0;in 2010. Anaya met with tribes in seven states on reservations and in urban areas, as well as with members of the Obama administration and the&#xa0;<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senate_Committee_on_Indian_Affairs\">Senate committee on Indian affairs</a>. The UN special rapporteur tentatively recommended the return of lands to some tribes, including the Black Hills to the Sioux. His full official report with recommendations is due in September 2012.</p> <p>We still have hope, but we know such encouragement has come and gone before. But we know in our hearts that the Black Hills, or what we call Cante Wamakaognake (\"the heart of all that is\"),&#xa0;because we belong there, because we come from there.&#xa0;Our origin, our beliefs, our entire way of life all revolve around the Black Hills. It is because of the history we have with this sacred land and the stories passed down from our elders that we know who we are. While the United States government labeled us savages long ago, claiming we needed to be civilized, they had no idea that we had astronomers, philosophers, doctors, teachers, midwives, artists, warriors, and more among us. This is the same land we fight for today. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-394809799\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/16/1345126375757/pesla_220.jpg\" alt=\"Pe' Sla, sacred site to the Sioux in the Black Hills, S Dakota\" width=\"220\" height=\"157\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pe' Sla, in the Black Hills.

You may see the irony that the Sioux Nation, having put aside the $1bn offered in compensation for the original theft, is now trying to buy back the land we believe always belonged to us. All the same, that is what we're doing: raising money to buy back our birthright.</p> <p>Whatever I do in this life and whoever I become, I know in my heart that I belong to that land, as my ancestors did and my children do. This is why we must do this. The Black Hills are, for us, the heart of all that is.</p> <p>\u2022 See <a href=\"http://www.indiegogo.com/PeSla-LakotaHeartland\">here for more information about the fundraising campaign to buy back Pe' Sla for the Sioux Nation</a></p>",
  "<p>Watch out, here comes Boris, John Bercow and, yes, it's <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2012/aug/15/richard-branson-railways-virgin-empire\" title=\"\">Richard Branson</a>, all waving their \"look at me\" placards. It's mid-August and a familiar cast of silly season characters is finally free to fight its way into the headlines after frustrating weeks behind the enormous barrier of the London Olympics.</p> <p>The Olympics had its own silly season sub-plots aplenty, but at least it was a real event with a real narrative drive, one which might have turned out badly \u2013 tragedy or farce \u2013 but became an unexpected triumph. The row over expat cricket star Kevin Pietersen's <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2012/aug/15/kevin-pietersen-andrew-strauss-warning\" title=\"\">text messages</a> \u2013childish and disloyal \u2013 ahead of the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2012/aug/16/england-south-africa-live-obo\" title=\"\">Lords Test</a> is also a proper yarn, though England supporters could have done without it. We're not quite in the new football season yet.</p> <p>None of which can be said of Boris's latest <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2012/aug/15/boris-johnson-pm-pussyfooting-london-airport\" title=\"\">\"stop pussyfooting around\"</a> message to David Cameron and George Osborne (it's the lead story in today's Times) let alone Mr Speaker Bercow's most recent outburst, courtesy of Radio 4 on a slow news day, against his \"embittered\" critics on the Tory benches at Westminster and their \"low-grade, sub-standard, low music hall drivel\" allies in the media.</p> <p>It's not that Mayor Johnson didn't have a point in his London Evening Standard interview. So does Speaker Bercow. But the objects of their scorn have counter-points to make. If it was easy to locate a new London airport in crowded south-east England someone would have done it over the past 40 years of public agonising. Ditto kick-starting a flatlining economy. Everyone from Beijing to Berlin via Chicago is trying, but they're all stuck. Boris gets gold for his motor-mouth.</p> <p>As for Bercow he is often correct in his efforts to raise parliament's game. But his many enemies are also correct when they complain that he and his wife, Sally, don't know how to behave with dignity appropriate to high public office. The pair display grotesque egotism and are serial offenders. Bercow's World at One interview was toe-curling.</p> <p>Of course, there was no need for other media to make a fuss over their predictable ravings \u2013 the Guardian tucked away short reports sensibly on its inside pages. And what could be more predictable than Richard Branson crying \"foul\" after the government finally took his advice to be less risk-averse in the awarding of public contracts by handing his Virgin Rail franchise to rival FirstGroup.</p> <p>Who's right? It's impossible to say at this stage and even the rail experts disagree. But Branson, who has done very well at both feuding in public and liposuctioning taxpayers' money (Northern Rock is his latest target), is a notoriously bad loser, shamelessly milking the public's love of an underdog even though he's been an alpha male overdog for decades.</p> <p>Of course, these things are highly subjective. For years I've been amazed how reflexively fawning a press that Gore Vidal enjoyed in leftish, Yank-bashing quarters for his arrogant and increasingly off-target assaults upon the United States and all its works. So I was grateful to his former prot\u00e9g\u00e9, Christopher Hitchens (no wallflower himself), for the kicking he gave Vidal in 2010, <a href=\"http://www.standard.co.uk/lifestyle/london-life/the-late-christopher-hitchens-ive-no-wish-to-assassinate-vidals-character-but-8001300.html\" title=\"\">posthumously republished</a> this month after the old rogue died.</p> <p>Vidal had become a reactionary and a very familiar kind of American isolationist, Hitchens concluded. Which is not to say he wasn't a brilliant essayist and phrase-maker. That's the trouble with real talent, as biographers so often discover once they've drilled beneath the hagiography. Evelyn Waugh may have been a bit of a shit, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graham_Greene OM\" title=\"\">Graham Greene</a> a very difficult customer, but they wrote some novels that will last.</p> <p>In any case, good people can be annoying too. I am afraid I have ceased to read interviews with <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doreen_Lawrence\" title=\"\">Doreen Lawrence</a>. She suffered a grievous loss in the murder of her son Stephen at that bus stop in 1993 \u2013 he was just a few days older than one of my children, now 37 \u2013 and has campaigned gallantly for justice ever since, rightly honoured at the Olympic opening ceremony. But I feel I now know what she has to say.</p> <p>Today's other headline junkie is a very different case. The government of distant Ecuador was placed in an awkward position when Julian Assange, the Wikileaks champion, sought political asylum in its London embassy. Overnight it has worked itself up into a state over <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2012/aug/16/julian-assange-ecuador-embassy-asylum\" title=\"\">a letter from the Foreign Office</a> which points out that the 1987 Diplomatic and Consular Premises Act may \u2013 may, since the legal point is disputed \u2013 allow the Metropolitan police to arrest Assange inside the modest Knightsbridge premises if William Hague unilaterally chooses to end its diplomatic status.</p> <p>\"Britain threatens to seize Assange\" is the Times headline on Thursday, the Guardian is sensibly more precise in saying that's how Quito chose to interpret the reminder as it geared up to announce its decision on whether to grant Assange's request. It sounded like <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/video/2012/aug/16/ecuador-julian-assange-threats-britain-video\" title=\"\">a bogus over-reaction</a> and a distraction worthy of a Branson.</p> <p>The legislative background is understandable. Back in the 80s, so a lawyer explained on air this morning, the Iranian embassy had been seized, as had the Cambodian one by squatters. And PC Yvonne Fletcher had been murdered by a diplomat from inside Libya's People's Bureau in central London. Margaret Thatcher, no less, had to let him go.</p> <p>But the 1987 act \u2013 passed in haste just before a general election - was designed to rectify problems of terrorism, not extradition. Experienced and retired diplomats are saying it would be unwise to use it to collar Assange. Not that the FCO said it would, only that it had the power to do so. Presumably the government of President Rafael Correa knows it would have a problem getting its VIP guest to Heathrow and out of the country anyway.</p> <p>The real problem for supporters of Julian Assange is that they want to believe in him, as they did in his publications of those WikiLeaks cables allegedly leaked by <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bradley_Manning\" title=\"\">Bradley Manning</a>, the American soldier now facing a fearsome prison sentence for numerous offences. But what people do \u2013 whether it's as writers or as political activists \u2013 is not always matched by who they are as private individuals.</p> <p>So the Assange-ites have been placed in the awkward position of claiming that their man is a persecuted journalist (he's not, he's an activist) upholding free speech who fears that, if he goes to Sweden to fight those allegations of sexual misconduct, he will be whisked off to an American jail with a death penalty hanging over him. Ecuador, whose government does lock up uppity hacks, is deemed a better bet.</p> <p>It's a big ask which requires people who might otherwise fiercely defend the rights of women not to suffer sexual abuse without redress to dismiss the charges made by his Swedish accusers. Tricky stuff, which is why it may be better for Assange to take his chance in a court inside one of the most reputable countries in the world, its due process well able to provide justice and stand up to any arm-twisting from the US attorney general's office. Better than us, did I hear you whisper.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Julian Assange joins Boris, Bercow and Branson on my silly season list. Mind you, it's not all silly season gloom and doom. Have you been following Gillian and Adrian Bayforth, the couple from Haverhill in Suffolk, who won \u00a3148m on the lottery? They seem a very grounded couple and determined to stay that way. Yesterday they flew off on a holiday break, by easyJet from Stanstead to a caravan park in Angus where Mrs B's parents live. They plan to share their good fortune. Good for them. I could tolerate hearing more about the Bayfords. Not all Bs are B for B******s.</p>",
  "<p>Even by large-living hip-hop standards, a night out at a New York club could prove to be an expensive one for Drake and Chris Brown.

Section 1(3) <a href=\"http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1987/46/section/1\" title=\"\">says</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"In no case is land to be regarded as a state's diplomatic or consular premises for the purposes of any enactment or rule of law unless it has been so accepted or the secretary of state has given that state consent under this section in relation to it; and if \u2014 <br>(a) a state ceases to use land for the purposes of its mission or exclusively for the purposes of a consular post; or <br>(b) the secretary of state withdraws his acceptance or consent in relation to land, <br>it thereupon ceases to be diplomatic or consular premises for the purposes of all enactments and rules of law.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>On the face of it, then, the secretary of state (in practice a foreign office minister) could now simply withdraw consent, and with one bound, police would be free to make an arrest.</p> <p>But it's not quite as simple as that. You'll note that section 1(4) says</p> <blockquote> <p>\"The secretary of state shall only give or withdraw consent or withdraw acceptance if he is satisfied that to do so is permissible under international law,\"</p> </blockquote> <p>and that according to section 1(5), in deciding whether to withdraw consent, the minister:</p> <blockquote> <p>\" \u2026 shall have regard to all material considerations, and in particular, but without prejudice to the generality of this subsection \u2014<br>(a) to the safety of the public;<br>(b) to national security; and<br>(c) to town and country planning.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>The \"compliance with international law\" requirement may present a problem, since <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/372400-vienna-convention-on-diplomatic-relations.html\" title=\"\">article 21 of the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations</a> requires the UK to facilitate the acquisition by Ecuador of premises necessary for its mission, or assist it in obtaining accommodation. It's not obvious this allows the UK to just de-recognise the current premises without helping arrange something new.</p> <p>Section 1(5) is interesting because, in spite of the way the drafting clearly intends to preserve ministers' ability to take account of anything they think relevant, I've no doubt lawyers for Ecuador could argue that the list of three particular concerns colours the scope of ministers' considerations, the result being that only some particular difficulty relating to safety or to the premises themselves could justify withdrawal.</p> <p>More importantly, they could argue that Assange's presence in the embassy and Ecuador's conduct in sheltering him is not a material consideration; and that since that clearly lay behind the withdrawal, ministers would in deciding to withdraw consent, have taken into account an irrelevant factor.</p> <p>In addition, there'd be a potentially strong argument to be made that ministers had exercised their power for an improper purpose not intended by parliament when it enacted the 1987 legislation \u2013 their desire to arrest Julian Assange.</p> <p>Ecuador could judicially review any proposed withdrawal: I think the effect on Assange means this is the type of case in which, as Lord Sumption <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;q=cache:UTaPeLlNEeEJ:www.supremecourt.gov.uk/docs/speech_120514.pdf+&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=uk&amp;pid=bl&amp;srcid=ADGEESgnkNCdbcQYeHaZ0wwD-ZbVVAoH2OZZ1KCr6TTwwNW3FpdHk0daasauVVNduS8dwyWEDc1SREPrZWSFlBXRGko05fSKKPK6Ofi9YhQ5A-RiN0be-xm79G1LFni9xrYTbI_rGMkb&amp;sig=AHIEtbSZEaffk6KOU2Ju-BJoUfiInYIN2w\" title=\"\">explained in a recent speech</a>, the courts would consider intervening in a foreign policy decision. Perhaps Assange could obtain an injunction on judicial review, preventing any arrest pending the outcome of proceedings. Of course, if the government successfully fought off that judicial review, the arrest could go ahead. But I don't think a defence would be easy, and at the very least, a judicial review would create further delay \u2013 which probably suits Assange fairly well. I'm not sure giving him a hook to hang one on would be the best tactical move for the government.</p> <p>The Quito letter from the UK to Ecuador went on apparently to say:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"We need to reiterate that we consider the continued use of the diplomatic premises in this way incompatible with the Vienna Convention and unsustainable and we have made clear the serious implications that this has for our diplomatic relations.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>If I were advising the government, I think I'd say that, if ministers are determined to allow the arrest of Assange, it might be better simply to cut off diplomatic relations with Ecuador, send the ambassador home, close the embassy and arrest Assange after that. Ending diplomatic relations is the major sort of foreign affairs decision I doubt the courts would interfere with. But that'd be a major diplomatic call.</p> <p>\u2022 This piece first appeared on Carl Gardner's blog, <a href=\"http://www.headoflegal.com/\" title=\"\">Head of Legal</a>.

  "<p>If the crowd's ecstatic reaction to the Queen's cameo alongside James Bond at the Olympics opening ceremony is anything to go by, the latest blockbuster featuring the fictitious spy will be a smash hit. Or, at least Cineworld hopes so.</p> <p>The UK's biggest cinema chain, with 79 across the country, is pinning its hopes on the latest 007 instalment due out later this year as the company reported a 21.5% jump in half-year operating profits to \u00a315.8m from \u00a313m.</p> <p>Box office admissions were down 0.8% in the six months to end of June, but revenues were up slightly to \u00a3165.4m from \u00a3163.6m thanks to an increase in ticket prices by 5% to an average of \u00a35.15.</p> <p>However, sales in popcorn and other snacks were down, with the average spend per customer dropping 2% to \u00a31.65.</p> <p>The profit boost has come courtesy of a strong roster of films including the Amazing Spiderman, Ice Age 4 and the final Batman instalment The Dark Knight Rises, while upcoming movies including The Hobbit, the third Twilight film and James Bond's Skyfall, are expected to maintain strong revenues, the company said.</p> <p>Cineworld chief executive Stephen Wiener said: \"The timing of these releases means that trade is expected to be strongest in the last two months of the year.\"</p> <p>Box office revenues were spread across a number of films in the first-half, with the top 10 highest grossing films accounting for roughly 40% of Cineworld's total box office, while 3D films accounted for 15% of admissions, down from 17% in 2011 due to fewer 3D releases.</p> <p>Wayne Brown, analyst at Cannacord Genuity, said:</p> <blockquote> These results are encouraging, as the first half of the year was up against tough comparatives and set against a period containing global sporting events and a weaker film slate when compared to last year. </blockquote> <p>Shares are up 7.3p, 3.2%, at 230.5p.</p>",

For people like Omar, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/global-development/video/2012/aug/16/somali-refugee-sweden-video\" title=\"\">the Somali refugee featured in Rain is Beautiful</a>, a new government in Mogadishu is unlikely to mean much as most of the country will continue to be plagued by insecurity long after the government has assumed power.</p> <p>Many of the estimated 5,000 people living in Tunisia's Choucha refugee camp and Egypt's Saloum camp are, like Omar, refugees two times over. Having fled persecution in their country of origin \u2013 be it Somalia, Eritrea, Ethiopia or Sudan, to name a few \u2013 they travelled to Libya to find a safe haven and means to support themselves and the families they left behind.</p> <p>As the government of Muammar Gaddafi fell, many migrants became victims of xenophobic attacks, and again sought refuge in these makeshift camps. Despite new authorities in Libya, their problems have not ended; the Choucha camp remains insecure, and violence involving local residents, refugees, and security forces has occurred. In May 2011, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/may/25/libya-refugees-gaddafi-regime-attacked\" title=\"\">a large part of the camp burned to the ground</a>.</p> <p>With no possibility of making a life in Libya, returning safely to their home country, or settling in Tunisia or Egypt, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/global-development/2012/aug/16/campaign-refugee-resettlement-europe\" title=\"\">the refugees look to Europe for safe haven</a>. But most European countries are not interested in taking them in. After <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/jun/02/refugees-feared-drowned-tunisian-coast\" title=\"\">risking their lives</a> by boarding small boats to sail towards Europe, many end up in Malta, where they are held in detention; a Human Rights Watch report last month called on Malta to review its \"<a href=\"http://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/reports/malta0712ForUpload.pdf\" title=\"\">arbitrary detention policy</a>\". Similarly, Greece last week rounded up more than <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/aug/07/greece-crackdown-illegal-immigrants-arrest\" title=\"\">7,000 foreigners presumed to be illegal migrants</a>.</p> <p>These countries are among the most common entry points for refugees and economic migrants (many people are both), and justify their actions by pointing to the disproportionate burden they bear compared with countries in northern Europe that \u2013 because of their geography and the sophistication of their border control bureaucracies \u2013 are harder for asylum seekers and migrants to reach.</p> <p>EU legislation known as the <a href=\"http://europa.eu/legislation_summaries/justice_freedom_security/free_movement_of_persons_asylum_immigration/l33153_en.htm\" title=\"\">Dublin II regulation</a> stipulates that asylum applications must be processed in the first country where an individual arrives. This provides a justification for other European countries to refuse to engage in burden sharing. There is little political will within the EU to revisit this regulation, despite evidence that it encourages unfair treatment of asylum seekers and other migrants in these entry-point countries.</p> <p>UNHCR, the UN refugee agency, has called on European countries to resettle 2,000 of the total caseload of 5,000 refugees in Tunisia and Egypt (the US has agreed to accept 3,000). Fewer than 900 places have been offered by Belgium, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Ireland, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal and Sweden. The UK has not offered to accept any of the refugees, despite the active role it played in supporting regime change in Libya.</p> <p>There is little public support for opening doors to those who have been further displaced as a result of the Arab spring. The dismal state of the EU economy has helped to fuel anti-immigrant sentiment, based on the widespread belief that social services will be unduly stretched and jobs taken from unemployed nationals. In addition, many feel that human rights obligations, which EU countries are legally required to uphold, are overgenerous.</p> <p>\"Double-refugees\" and migrants-turned-refugees in Tunisia are among those who have suffered most from the Arab spring. What has emerged in Tunisia and Egypt is a protection vacuum, with the large numbers of refugees trapped in camps likely to remain there indefinitely.</p> <p>Without options for <a href=\"http://www.amnesty.org/en/refugees-and-migrants/resettlement\" title=\"\">safe resettlement</a>, more people will defy the grim odds and try to enter Europe illegally by sea. Many will perish on the journey; at least 1,500 died this way last year. Those who succeed in reaching a safe shore may find themselves locked up for months or years before being accepted somewhere or deported. European governments and the EU can and should do more to help the inadvertent victims of the Arab spring, expanding resettlement for Somalis and other double refugees, and offering them the security that many have lacked for years.</p>",
  "<p>The home secretary is blocking cabinet moves to make it easier for Chinese visitors to get visas, warning it would pose a national security risk and blaming poor visitor numbers on tourism chiefs not promoting Britain's natural beauty properly.</p> <p>Theresa May's opposition is revealed in a leaked letter sent by her private secretary to Downing Street which emerged only a day after the culture secretary, Jeremy Hunt, tried to build on the Olympic success by unveiling an \u00a38m marketing strategy to treble the number of Chinese visitors to Britain by 2015.</p> <p>The issue appears to have sparked a clash between ministers at the highest levels of government. Hunt, backed by the business secretary, Vince Cable, and the chancellor, George Osborne, has led calls to simplify the visa regime for Chinese visitors after repeated and sustained complaints from the Chinese business community.</p> <p>Chinese tour groups are currently able to apply for a single European Union visa, covering the 25 Schengen countries including France and Germany, but have to get a separate visa to visit Britain. Hunt said he want to use the Olympics to \"turbocharge\" Britain's tourism industry and told reporters one option was to design a \"parallel process\" whereby tour groups could apply for a British and EU Schengen visa at the same time.</p> <p>But May is blocking any such move arguing that visa checks in Europe \"do not match the UK decision quality\" and claiming that British visa controls are a \"key tool in protecting the public against significant harm\".</p> <p>Her<a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/immigration/9478258/Theresa-May-blocks-Chinese-visa-plans-over-organised-crime-fears.html\" title=\"\"> letter leaked</a> to the Daily Telegraph points out to Downing Street that there were already 400 Chinese criminals awaiting deportation and 1,000 asylum applications from Chinese citizens last year.</p> <p>\"The proposal \u2026 is not acceptable to the home secretary for national security reasons. At cabinet the issue of asylum claims was discussed,\" says the letter from May's principal private secretary, Katharine Hammond. \"We also face significant challenges with foreign national offenders and organised crime, including drugs, money laundering, criminal finances, intellectual property, immigration and cybercrime.\"</p> <p>May blames VisitBritain for failing to market Britain's scenic natural beauty and insists that the current visa system is not to blame for the UK's lack of popularity amongst Chinese visitors.</p> <p>The home secretary criticises Hunt for using \"selective statistics\" to back up his claims that the visa system is to blame and says the costs involved are insignificant compared to the price and availability of hotels.</p> <p>The Home Office declined to comment on the leaked letter but pointed out it had already made improvements to the Chinese visa services by introducing more staff, VIP facilities, an online application process, and translated guidance.</p> <p>Sebastian Wood, the British ambassador in Beijing, wrote to May in June complaining that the UK visa system was seen in China as a \"fortress\" that was putting off tourists. The application forms are in English rather than Mandarin and cost nearly \u00a3100 to obtain compared with \u00a355 to get permission to go to Spain.</p> <p>The government is particularly keen to attract Chinese tourists because they are estimated to spend an average of three times more than other overseas visitors, but France receives 25-50% more Chinese tourists than the UK.</p>",
  "<p>In the days that followed the August 2011 disturbances that hit Birmingham last year, we sat down with our staff, customers and partners to talk about what went wrong and look for answers.</p> <p>Many of the neighbourhoods that our tenants live in were affected by rioting. These are fantastic areas where people of all ages, religions and races live together \u2013 diverse communities which don't want to be defined by rioters. Yet youth unemployment, feelings of alienation and a disconnection from community life and society were all found to be part of the problem.</p> <p>Housing associations have a major responsibility in addressing these issues. I would argue that it is part of our DNA. The social housing sector is already helping to rebuild and support many vulnerable families and individuals.</p> <p>In Birmingham, we responded by setting up a programme called Back on Track. It helps young people that have faced significant challenges in their lives but only need the right opportunities, guidance and support to prove their full potential.</p> <p>At the heart of the programme is an apprenticeship scheme which provides the anchor and motivation from which our trainees can build their skills and resilience and develop a stake in society. What makes it work is the system of support that wraps around the apprenticeship; it provides a really important safety net to catch any issues which may affect their chance of success, offering intensive family support and staff mentors, housing and money advice and help with immigration.</p> <p>Birmingham's community leaders, the probation service, police, youth offending service and training providers have all been essential in the project's success. Our apprentices live within the areas where we work as a landlord and bring an insight to these communities. This is invaluable for us.</p> <p>Some of the trainees are already four months in and, though we will soon have the results of a formal interim evaluation, we know it works as we have seen self-esteem and confidence bloom over a matter of weeks. These young people are at the start of an exciting future. One remarked recently that this is a dream and he doesn't want to wake up. \"You probably think I'm exaggerating, but if you knew how my life was before \u2013 all the hustling and struggling \u2013 you would see how important this is to me,\" he explained.</p> <p>Local businesses have a huge responsibility in creating opportunities for young people. They need to think differently about how to engage those that are harder to reach and how to work with them.</p> <p>Young people need to have hope and a chance to make changes to their lives. Just by simply taking notice, saying well done, showing someone where they fit into society and how their work adds value can build confidence and a sense of belonging.</p> <p>The results are truly inspiring: by investing in our young people we are in turn investing in their families, their neighbours and our wider communities.</p> <p><em> Ruth Cooke is chief executive of </em><a href=\"http://www.midlandheart.org.uk/\" title=\"\"><em>Midland Heart</em></a></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by Guardian Professional. </strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/housing-network/2011/oct/10/join-guardian-housing-network\" title=\"\"><strong>Join the housing network</strong></a><strong> for news, views and best practice direct to you</strong></p>",

Speaking to reporters later, he said: \"The government of Ecuador is considering a request for asylum and has carried out diplomatic talks with the governments of the United Kingdom and Sweden. However, today we received from the United Kingdom a written threat that they could attack our embassy in London if Ecuador does not give up Julian Assange.</p> <p>\"Ecuador, as a state that respects rights and justice and is a democratic and peaceful nation state, rejects in the strongest possible terms the explicit threat of the British official communication.</p> <p>\"This is unbecoming of a democratic, civilised and law-abiding state. If this conduct persists, Ecuador will take appropriate responses in accordance with international law.</p> <p>\"If the measures announced in the British official communication materialise they will be interpreted by Ecuador as a hostile and intolerable act and also as an attack on our sovereignty, which would require us to respond with greater diplomatic force.</p> <p>\"Such actions would be a blatant disregard of the Vienna convention on diplomatic relations and of the rules of international law of the past four centuries.</p> <p>\"It would be a dangerous precedent because it would open the door to the violation of embassies as a declared sovereign space.\" Under international law, diplomatic posts are considered the territory of the foreign nation.</p> <p>The Foreign Office was quick to downplay the drama. A spokesman said Britain had merely sought to \"clarify its position\", according to international law.</p> <p>\"Throughout this process we have drawn the Ecuadoreans' attention to relevant provisions of our law \u2013 for example, the extensive human rights safeguards in our extradition procedures, or the legal status of diplomatic premises in the UK,\" a spokesman said.</p> <p>\"We are still committed to reaching a mutually acceptable solution.\"</p> <p>Ecuador revealed that it would announce its decision regarding Assange's asylum request on Thursday at 1pm.</p> <p>A Foreign Office spokeswoman said: \"We have consistently made our position clear in our discussions with the government of Ecuador. The UK has a legal obligation to extradite Mr Assange to Sweden to face questioning over allegations of sexual offences and we remain determined to fulfil this obligation.</p> <p>\"We have an obligation to extradite Mr Assange and it is only right that we give Ecuador the full picture.</p> <p>Correa has said Assange could face the death penalty in the US, and for that reason he considers the asylum request a question of political persecution.</p> <p>Analysts in Ecuador expressed doubts that Britain would raid the embassy.</p> <p>Professor Julio Echeverria of Quito's Flasco University said Britain \"has a long-established tradition in Europe of respecting diplomatic missions\", which under international law are considered sovereign territory.</p> <p>A former Ecuadorean ambassador to London, Mauricio Gandara, told the Associated Press: \"I refuse to believe in this threat because if asylum is granted the British government will not grant safe passage and Mr Assange could be in the embassy for a long time.\"</p> <p>Assange denies the allegations against him, but fears he will be sent to the United States if he goes to Sweden. An offer to the Swedish authorities by Ecuador for investigators to interview Assange inside the London embassy was rejected.</p> <p>A former computer hacker, Assange enraged Washington in 2010 when WikiLeaks published secret US diplomatic cables, has been taking refuge in the Ecuadorian embassy since 19 June.</p> <p>If Ecuador does give Assange asylum, it is difficult to see how the WikiLeaks boss could physically leave the closely watched embassy and head to an airport without being arrested by British police.</p>"
