  "<p>\u2022 It would be suicidal for the government to seek to pluck Julian Assange from the Ecuadorean embassy, says President Correa. And the problem is, he's right. Silly even to have floated the idea. But in part understandable, because the whole Assange-Ecuador-asylum thing definitely has the authorities discombobulated. Yesterday we told of how a police officer accosted a blameless rail traveller in west London, his enthusiasm fired up by the belief that he was spearheading the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/aug/20/hugh-muirs-diary-julian-assange\" title=\"\">capture of the man who leaked the secrets</a>. Today, we can reveal a bit more about the debacle. The guy who was required to prove that he was not Assange was Nick Potter, one of the country's leading consultant osteopaths and the son of a former high court judge. He is blond, whereby Assange has the platinum locks we have come to know. They are not particularly alike. \"He said 'I have reason to believe you are a suspect we have been looking for',\" Potter told us. \"I said,&#xa0;'what am I supposed to have done'. He said 'I have reason to believe you are Julian Assange'. Everyone went quiet.\" And&#xa0;here is the really interesting bit. \"I said 'I thought he was in the Ecuadorean embassy'. And he said 'we have strong reason to believe he is at large'.\" Which suggests that just by staying where he was but keeping his head down, Assange had them fearing that he had already flown the nest. Isn't that typical? He should climb the balcony each day and give us a wave.</p> <p>\u2022 For we crave reassurance. That is why many worry about the <a href=\"http://www.bl.uk/reshelp/inrrooms/readingrooms.html\" title=\"\">questionnaire being handed out to users of the reading rooms at the British Library</a>. It's \"your chance to support our future\", it says. But it all becomes a bit disturbing. We are funded by taxation, it says. \"In the unlikely event that this funding ceased to be provided, would you be willing to pay an amount?\" Of course, it is not going to happen. We just want to \"capture the value that you place on the reading room and its services\". By the way, how much would you pay \"to support the continuation\"? It won't happen; perish the thought. \"There is no indication that public funding will end.\" But while we're here, just talking and thinking the unthinkable; if we stopped issuing reader passes but allowed you to rent out your reader pass, how much would you want for it each month? Don't worry. It's just another attempt to \"capture the value\". Hmm.</p> <p>\u2022 So what will they do now, we asked with reference to the Scientologists who were busy during the Olympics <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/aug/13/hugh-muir-diary-papua-new-guinea\" title=\"\">handing out anti-drug booklets that nowhere mentioned Scientology</a>? We should have known they would surface somewhere. And sure enough, an eagle-eyed reader spotted a batch on offer around his local Tesco in south-east London. Something to do between now and the Paralympics.</p> <p>\u2022 Much amusement to be had, meanwhile, from the <a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9781849543194\" title=\"\">memoirs of the former home secretary David Waddington</a>. He always presented as a dry stick, but given free rein and away from Baroness Thatcher's gaze, he emerges as a seasoned gossip. There is a tale of the late Sir Alan Glyn, the former <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Glyn\" title=\"\">Tory MP for Windsor and Maidenhead</a>, who \u2013 ever the model of proactivity \u2013 summoned a group of young Tories to go canvassing with him. \"They duly turned up, but there was no Dr Glyn,\" recalls Waddington. \"Eventually a search party went up to his room. There was no immediate sign of him, but there was an old-fashioned wardrobe lying face down on the floor \u2013 and the team set about restoring it to an upright position. Underneath it they discovered the good doctor. In the middle of the night, he had set off to go to the lavatory, but instead of going through the door into the bathroom, he had found his way into the cupboard. The cupboard had fallen over, trapping him inside \u2013 and he had spent the rest of the night there.\" He should, perhaps, have called for help. But the good Tory fends for himself.</p> <p>\u2022 Finally, we hear from <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ian_Bone\" title=\"\">Ian Bone</a>, founder of Class War. He's off to the cricket. \"Forty years ago I was protesting the Springboks rugby tour,\" he says. On 31 August, he'll convene a gathering at the Oval to meet the South Africans, a protest at the mining massacre at Marikana. Same fire in his belly. Less hair.</p> <p><em> Twitter: </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/hugh_muir\" title=\"\"><em>@hugh_muir</em></a></p>",
  "<p>Can Prince Philip perhaps be forgiven a little? For being such a rude bugger, and not always saying the right thing? No, no excuses?</p> <p>But he did have a difficult childhood, as we learn in <a href=\"http://www.channel4.com/programmes/the-queens-mother-in-law\" title=\"\"><strong>The Queen's Mother in Law</strong></a> (Channel 4). Philip's mum, Alice of Battenberg, was a bit German and a bit British (Queen Victoria was her great grandmother) and she married Prince Andrew of Greece and Denmark (lord knows why they came as a package). It was different in those days \u2013 there was no Mahiki or wherever they now go to meet potential partners, so the royal houses of Europe paired off among each other, even though they were all cousins. And because they were so inbred they were too stupid to get into St Andrews University so they couldn't meet fit commoners/non-rellies that way. It was a difficult cycle to break out of. Alice, incidentally, was congenitally deaf.</p> <p>Anyway, after the Greco-Turkish war, Andrew and Alice were kicked out of Greece with their five children \u2013 four girls, who would marry Germans who later served under Hitler in the second world war. And Phil the Greek, who served in the British navy, before copping off with our Brenda. Oh, and Alice was back in occupied Greece during the war, rescuing Jews from the Nazis, a kind of mini-Schindler, albeit with a much shorter list. Complicated huh? Like one of those Liverpool families that is half red, half blue \u2013 possibly even more complicated.</p> <p>That's jumping the gun, though. Because first Alice has to go mad. Which she did with gusto and aplomb. She thought she was having sexual relationships not just with Jesus Christ but with Buddha too. Husband Prince Andrew (of Greece and Denmark, keep up), unprepared to share his missus with the founders of any major world religions \u2013 and also because he's a bit of a cad, to be honest \u2013 legged it to the French Riviera for a lazy life of sunshine and mistresses. And Alice \u2013 on the instructions of her mother \u2013 was locked up in an asylum. Here, on the recommendation of Sigmund Freud, she had her ovaries X-rayed, because they thought that accelerating the menopause would cure her. These same people were also transplanting the testicles of gay men, in order to cure them of their gayness. Bloody idiots.</p> <p>Back to poor Philip then. He came home from a picnic one day to find that his deluded mum had been locked away, and his dad had skedaddled. So he was sent to boarding school in England, and was passed around among aristocratic rellies in the holidays, before joining the navy to fight against the Nazis who were married to his sisters. Then he met the future Queen of England, his future wife (and third cousin).</p> <p>They were reunited later, Philip and his mother. Alice, now a nun and (marginally) less mad, came to live in Buckingham Palace, where she wandered the corridors, sucking on a Woodbine. \"Wonderful, isn't it?\" says Giles Brandreth. It is, yes, all of it, an amazing story. Also wonderful are all the old trouts who come out from under their rocks to talk about it. Not just Giles, but also Countess Mountbatten, Lady Pamela So-and-So etc. Lovely.</p> <p>It's a shame that Jack Whitehall has thrown everything at his own character in <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p00vrlrh\" title=\"\"><strong>Bad Education</strong></a> (BBC3), and more or less forgotten about everyone else. Michelle Gomez, star of Green Wing and such a hilarious physical comic actor, is unforgivably underused. I'd also like to see more of some of the kids who are brilliant \u2013 Chantelle the slag, camp Stephen, Grayson the bully (love the way he says \"shut up\"). That would give it more layers, more depth. It's all Jack's Alfie though. I guess that's what happens when the writer is also the star. Me me me me me.</p> <p>BUT \u2013 and it's a big, upper-case but \u2013 Bad Education is still fabulous, a very silly half-hour of anarchic inappropriate joy. With some lovely situations, and some lovely lines. \"Make a noise, like a girl having a crap,\" teacher Alfie orders pupil Joe, cowering in the girls' toilets, when the deputy goes into the next cubicle to empty a confiscated bottle of cider.</p> <p>Crucially, and probably because it's the creation of one guy, Bad Education has heaps of personality. It may be a flawed baby, but it's Whitehall's baby.</p> <p>The other new school-based sitcom, <a href=\"http://skyliving.sky.com/gates/sneak-peek-gates-episode-1-preview-video\" title=\"\"><strong>Gates</strong></a> (Sky Living) is the creation of five people. I know that can work with slick American shows, but this isn't one of them. It feels like comedy by committee, where compromises have been reached, and middle paths found. The result is it has almost zero personality. It's not awful, it's just a bit bland. Not joyous, not anarchic, not funny.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 22 August 2012 because an editing error led to Battenberg being misspelled as Battenburg. It was further amended on 24 August 2012 because the footnote appended on 22 August 2012 erred in saying that the original article had referred to Gordonstoun as a boarding school in England. In fact the original article referred only to Prince Philip being sent to boarding school in England. This is correct \u2013 he attended Cheam school, a boarding preparatory school then in Surrey, before becoming a pupil at Gordonstoun in Scotland \u2013 and so the reference to England has been restored to the article.</p>",
  "<p>Considering he made his name with the biggest leak of secret government documents in history, you might imagine there would be at least some residual concern for Julian Assange among those trading in the freedom of information business. But the virulence of British media hostility towards the WikiLeaks founder is now unrelenting.</p> <p>This is a man, after all, who has yet to be charged, let alone convicted, of anything. But <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/jul/21/rights-groups-lost-plot-ecuador\" title=\"\">as far as the bulk of the press is concerned</a>, Assange is nothing but a \"monstrous narcissist\", a bail-jumping \"sex pest\" and an exhibitionist maniac. After Ecuador granted him political asylum and Assange delivered a \"tirade\" from its London embassy's balcony, fire was turned on the country's progressive president, Rafael Correa, ludicrously branded a corrupt \"dictator\" with an \"iron grip\" on a benighted land.</p> <p>The ostensible reason for this venom is of course Assange's attempt to resist extradition to Sweden (and onward extradition to the US) over sexual assault allegations \u2013 including from newspapers whose record on covering rape and violence against women is shaky, to put it politely. But as the row over his embassy refuge has escalated into a major diplomatic stand-off, with the whole of South America piling in behind Ecuador, such posturing looks increasingly specious.</p> <p>Can anyone seriously believe the dispute would have gone global, or that the British government would have made its asinine threat to suspend the Ecuadorean embassy's diplomatic status and enter it by force, or that scores of police would have surrounded the building, swarming up and down the fire escape and guarding every window, if it was all about one man wanted for questioning over sex crime allegations in Stockholm?</p> <p>To get a grip on what is actually going on, rewind to WikiLeaks' explosive release of secret US military reports and hundreds of thousands of diplomatic cables two years ago. They disgorged devastating evidence of US war crimes and collusion with death squads in Iraq on an industrial scale, the machinations and lies of America's wars and allies, its illegal US spying on UN officials \u2013 as well as a compendium of official corruption and deceit across the world.</p> <p>WikiLeaks provided fuel for the Arab uprisings. It didn't just deliver information for citizens to hold governments everywhere to account, but crucially opened up the exercise of US global power to democratic scrutiny. Not surprisingly, the US government made clear it regarded WikiLeaks as a serious threat to its interests from the start, denouncing the release of confidential US cables as a \"criminal act\".</p> <p>Vice-president Joe Biden has compared Assange to a \"hi-tech terrorist\". Shock jocks and neocons have called for him to be hunted down and killed. Bradley Manning, the 24-year-old soldier accused of passing the largest trove of US documents to WikiLeaks, who has been held in conditions described as \"cruel and inhuman\" by the&#xa0;UN special rapporteur on torture, faces up to 52 years in prison.</p> <p>The US administration yesterday claimed the WikiLeaks founder was trying to deflect attention from his Swedish case by making \"wild allegations\" about US intentions. But the idea that the threat of US extradition is some paranoid WikiLeaks fantasy is absurd.</p> <p>A <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2011/06/09/wikileaks_27/\" title=\"\">grand jury in Virginia</a> has been preparing a case against Assange and WikiLeaks for espionage, a leak earlier this year suggested that the US government has already <a href=\"http://ccrjustice.org/newsroom/press-releases/ccr-condemns-reported-sealed-indictment-against-wikileaks-founder-julian-assange\" title=\"\">issued a secret sealed indictment against Assange</a>, while Australian diplomats have reported that the <a href=\"http://www.smh.com.au/technology/technology-news/us-targets-wikileaks-like-no-other-organisation-20111202-1obeo.html\" title=\"\">WikiLeaks founder is the target of an investigation that is \"unprecedented both in its scale and its nature\"</a>.</p> <p>The US interest in deterring others from following the WikiLeaks path is obvious. And it would be bizarre to expect a state which over the past decade has kidnapped, tortured and illegally incarcerated its enemies, real or imagined, on a global scale \u2013 and continues to do so under President Barack Obama \u2013 to walk away from what Hillary Clinton described as an \"attack on the international community\". In the meantime, the US authorities are presumably banking on seeing Assange further discredited in Sweden.</p> <p>None of that should detract from the seriousness of the rape allegations made against Assange, for which he should clearly answer and, if charges are brought, stand trial. The question is how to achieve justice for the women involved while protecting Assange (and&#xa0;other whistleblowers) from punitive extradition to a legal system that could potentially land him in a US prison cell for decades.</p> <p>The politicisation of the Swedish case&#xa0;was clear from the initial leak of the allegations to the prosecutor's decision to seek Assange's extradition for questioning \u2013 described by a <a href=\"http://www.scribd.com/doc/48396086/Assange-Case-Opionion-Sven-Erik-Alhem\" title=\"\">former Stockholm prosecutor as \"unreasonable,&#xa0;unfair and disproportionate\"</a> \u2013 when&#xa0;the&#xa0;authorities have been happy&#xa0;to interview suspects abroad in&#xa0;more serious cases.</p> <p>And given the context, it's also hardly surprising that sceptics have raised the links with US-funded anti-Cuban opposition groups of one of those making the accusations \u2013 or that campaigners such as the London-based Women Against Rape have expressed scepticism at the \"unusual zeal\" with which rape allegations were pursued against Assange in a country where rape convictions have fallen. The danger, of course, is that the murk around this case plays into a misogynist culture in which rape&#xa0;victims aren't believed.</p> <p>But why, Assange's critics charge, would he be more likely to be extradited to the US from Sweden than from Britain, Washington's patsy, notorious for its one-sided extradition arrangements. There are specific risks in Sweden \u2013 for example, its fast-track \"temporary surrender\" extradition agreement it has with the US. But the real point is that Assange is in danger of&#xa0;extradition in both countries \u2013&#xa0;which&#xa0;is why Ecuador was right to offer him protection.</p> <p>The solution is obvious. It's the one that Ecuador is proposing \u2013 and that London and Stockholm are resisting. If the Swedish government pledged to block the extradition of Assange to the US for any WikiLeaks-related offence (which it has the power to do) \u2013 and Britain agreed not to sanction extradition to a third country once Swedish proceedings are over \u2013 then justice could be served. But with loyalty to the US on the line, Assange shouldn't expect to leave the embassy any time soon.</p> <p>\u2022 Comments on this article will be turned on in the morning</p> <p><em>Twitter: </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/SeumasMilne\" title=\"\"><em>@SeumasMilne</em></a></p>",
  "<p>Some wars do not end. Russian forces \u2013 Tsarist, Bolshevik, and post-Soviet \u2013 have been fighting in the North Caucasus for the best part of three centuries, and the conflict stubbornly refuses any attempt by the Kremlin to declare its mission there accomplished. What confidence can anyone have that the civil war in Syria, a land just as riven with old scores and ancient rivalries, will reach a definitive conclusion \u2013 the ousting of Bashar al-Assad and the establishment of a government committed to free elections, reconciliation and reconstruction? At the moment, very little.</p> <p>The battle taking place in Aleppo is a case in point. Syria's second city is key and by general consent will, in theory, provide the tipping point so desperately sought in a conflict that has already claimed <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jul/22/syria-death-toll-tops-19000\" title=\"\">over 19,000 lives</a>. In practice this is proving to be an elusive concept. The regime holds the west of the city, and the militias that comprise the Free Syrian Army the east. The regime has only committed troops to one front, Salaheddine district in the south-west, and is reluctant to throw in the rest of its infantry, opting to shell and bomb from the air. There are theories as to why there have been no serious attempts to recapture the city, one of them being the fear of defections if units became detached from their officers. But in theory the eastern half of Aleppo, which is being contested by only 4,000 rebel fighters, should be relatively easy for a well-equipped army to retake.</p> <p>The fight from the rebels' perspective is not going well either. As they openly acknowledge, their presence is contested by much of the city's population. The fighters are not seen here as liberators, but as harbingers of terrible suffering to come. The FSA fall between two stools. They are ill equipped to shoot down Assad's warplanes, but eminently visible enough to attract the regime's aerial firepower. Assad's warplanes are also using bigger bombs in civilian areas. If this is a deliberate strategy by the regime that has strewn the city with craters, it may be working. Aleppines blame the FSA for military operations in their city, rather than Damascus for its brutal response. Whatever the cause, the rebels are by their own admission not getting the support in the city that they got in the countryside. This is not just a function of the demography of Aleppo. Support for the FSA in Damascus also depends on whether the insurgents are local. This may change, and could be more a result of the Balkanisation of Syrian society than the product of any lingering sympathy for Assad, which surely has evaporated. If the space for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/20/pawns-syrian-conflict-await-endgame?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">non-violent protest</a> has shrunk \u2013 although there are still opposition groups who cling on to this hope \u2013 the road ahead for the armed revolt can only be long and bitter. Despite high-level defections and the deaths of four senior security figures in a bombing last month, Assad's army is intact and he retains no shortage of options.</p> <p>One of them is to make <a href=\"http://www.joshualandis.com/blog/?p=15649&amp;utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+Syriacomment+%28Syria+Comment%29\" title=\"\">a Lebanon out of Syria</a>. Assad has withdrawn his forces from Kurdish parts of Syria, and Turkey claims he has invited the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) back in. Turkey blamed a car bomb attack on a police station near its south-eastern border on the PKK and Syrian intelligence. Another sign of things to come is the bombing in <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/human-rights-watch/syria-fighter-jet-bombing_b_1789220.html\" title=\"\">Azaz</a>, only kilometres from the border, which killed 40 civilians. Assad is doing his utmost to provoke a Turkish incursion. Gun battles have broken out between rival groups in Tripoli, Lebanon's second city, as fears of contagion grow. The possibilities of exporting chaos are legion, and that is before Iran's Revolutionary Guards or Hezbollah, the two most powerful foreign forces in Assad's armoury, are deployed.</p> <p>One ethnic group fleeing the country is Syria's <a href=\"http://world.time.com/2012/08/21/circassians-flee-syria-strife-for-russia-homeland/\" title=\"\">Circassians</a>. They are part of a worldwide diaspora created when Russian troops expelled them from the North Caucasus, in what Circassians claim was a genocide. The world will be literally skiing on the graves of their forefathers in the Sochi Winter Olympics in 2014. The date of their expulsion was 21 May 1864.</p>",

Since his appointment was announced in March, the fashion spotlight has been focused on him and changes at the French brand. It makes sense. As creative director for Dior Homme from 2000 to 2007, Slimane radicalised the house and made a skinny, rock'n'roll silhouette a male ideal. He has since become a respected photographer, known for moody black and white shots of the young, edgy and gorgeous. His Yves Saint Laurent first collection was shown to buyers in June, but the rest of us have had to be content with titbits. There is a <a href=\" http://www.guardian.co.uk/fashion/fashion-blog/2012/jul/25/saint-laurent-new-logo\" title=\"\">rebranding of the ready-to-wear</a> and the studio is decamping from Paris to LA, where Slimane now lives.

  "<p>France's new Socialist government is to hold emergency talks on the plight of the country's Roma after a wave of evictions of makeshift camps prompted accusations that Fran\u00e7ois Hollande was following Nicolas Sarkozy's lead in persecuting the ethnic minority.</p> <p>Human rights groups expressed outrage at a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/09/french-police-roma-camp-repatriations\" title=\"\">recent dawn raids and forced evacuations of caravan sites</a> and squats across France. The police raids left hundreds of Roma, including many children, homeless after caravans were impounded and no arrangements for temporary housing were made. Others were persuaded to board flights home to Romania, activists in Lyon reported.</p> <p>The raids have reopened a bitter row over Roma in France. In 2010, Sarkozy prompted criticism from the European Commission and the Vatican when he linked immigration to crime and promised to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/sep/13/sarkozy-roma-expulsion-human-rights\" title=\"\">expel Roma migrants</a> and destroy illegal camps. More than 70% of illegal Roma encampments were bulldozed and families were offered a financial incentive to leave the country. Sarkozy's government was accused of discrimination in expelling Roma Gypsies to Bulgaria and Romania. Critics alluded to uncomfortable memories of deportations during the second world war. Many of the Roma simply returned to France, but, with old camps destroyed, they ended up living in deeper poverty and worse conditions than ever, amid a climate of fear and intimidation towards them.</p> <p>Hollande had promised during his election campaign that any dismantling of camps would be coupled with the promise of \"alternative solutions\". But this has not happened with the recent evictions.</p> <p>Behind a railway siding in Hellemmes, northern Lille, five extended Roma families and their children huddled under tarpaulins on a patch of land near an abandoned building. Flies circled piles of waste, mothers complained of rats and the stench of human excrement rose from a hole in the ground as well as faeces on grass near the edge of the camp.</p> <p>\"We were evicted from our camp two weeks ago, police knocked on my caravan door one morning and told me to leave,\" said Anita Proda, 27, whose five-year-old son was born in France had been due to start school in September. \"They took my caravan, I grabbed a bag of belongings, but had to leave most behind. We've got no water here, we can't wash the children.\"</p> <p>Most of the evicted Roma had put a few possessions in shopping trolleys and traipsed to this spot where a makeshift camp of six caravans already existed. They are now living in cramped, donated tents surrounded by rubbish and a burned-out car. Local volunteers had been bringing jerry-cans of water .</p> <p>\"These people are being hunted,\" said Yann Lafolie of Atelier Solidaire, which had run literacy and education projects and built wooden cabins in the long-standing camp which police dismantled earlier this month. \"Our voluntary work used to be about integration, now we're trying to handle a humanitarian crisis. This Socialist president was elected for change but there is no change here.\"</p> <p>In the centre of Lille a further 16 evicted families were sheltering temporarily in tents beside a church, where a local priest had said that suddenly seeing boys on bikes carrying jerry-cans of water was like \"being in Burkina Faso\".</p> <p>Outside Lille, in Roubaix \u2013 known as the poorest town in France \u2013 Roma at a makeshift camp in what was once a supermarket car park were nervous, fearing they would soon be evicted too. Families, including a 23-year-old mother of four suffering from cancer, lived in decrepit caravans which leaked in winter, without electricity or proper water supply, although the authorities offer rubblish collection and portable toilets.</p> <p>\"There's a growing anger, a feeling of powerlessness: you can't force people out and leave them without the least sanitary conditions,\" said Bernadette Defais, a local nursing assistant, and volunteer for a local charity La Solidarite.</p> <p>On a street nearby, Ramona Ripa, 22, a Roma mother of four from Romania, showed off her spotlessly scrubbed kitchen in a once abandoned terraced house. She and others now await a court ruling on whether they would be evicted from empty houses owned by the local authority which they had squatted for months, with the help of the French charity and activists group, Droit au Logement (Right to Housing). \"We just want to settle in one place; put our children in school and work,\" Ripa said.</p> <p>Philippe Deltombe, from Droit au Logement, said: \"By evicting these people, the government is not addressing the Roma issue, it's just shifting it on to the next location.\"</p> <p>Images of the dismantled camps and comparisons to Sarkozy's Roma-crackdown have been a PR disaster for Hollande. Measures under consideration in Wednesday's emergency government talks include the possible lifting of working restrictions for Bulgarian and Romanian nationals in an effort to provide legal status for around 15,000 Roma from those two EU countries currently living in France.</p> <p>Manuel Valls, the Socialist party's tough-talking interior minister, said his government's approach to the Roma question had \"nothing in common\" with the Sarkozy era, arguing that \"unsanitary camps\" were \"unacceptable\" and \"a challenge to community life\" in poor neighbourhoods. Officials said police had just been honouring orders made by the courts. But there has been friction within government after the Green party housing minister, Cecile Duflot, said \"dismantling Roma camps without solutions is putting people in an even more precarious situation\".</p> <p>A recent poll showed 80% approved of dismantling the illegal camps, but 73% thought it was not an effective measure as it merely \"displaced\" the problem.</p>",
  "<p>An evangelist preacher who has claimed he can cure people of their illnesses by hitting and kicking them has been banned from entering the UK by the Home Office.</p> <p>Todd Bentley, a controversial revivalist healer based in the United States, had been due to hold a series of gatherings in England, Wales and Northern Ireland in the next few weeks. But the Home Office said Bentley, a Canadian citizen, was subject to an exclusion order and would not be permitted entry to the country.</p> <p>\"We can confirm that Mr Bentley has been excluded from the UK. The government makes no apologies for refusing people access to the UK if we believe they are not conducive to the public good. Coming here is a privilege that we refuse to extend to those who might seek to undermine our society,\" the Home Office said.</p> <p>Bentley, a 36-year-old former drug addict who at the age of 13 sexually assaulted a minor, reacted angrily to the decision, writing on his church's Facebook page: \"What about all the other celebrities, musicians and others with a more colorful past than me that are permitted into the UK for shows \u2026 Is this really about my past and fear of potential violence or Freedom of Religion and attack on Faith, God &amp; Healing?\"</p> <p>Bentley has reportedly distanced himself from some of his more extreme claims, insisting on Twitter that violence was \"the furthest thing from who we are and how we minister\".</p> <p>News of the tour's cancellation will come as a relief to those who had petitioned the government against it, including Malcolm Wicks, the Labour MP for Croydon North, who earlier this month wrote to the Home Secretary, Theresa May, urging her to ban Bentley, saying: \"His visit can do nothing but harm and I would be grateful for any measures you can take.\"</p> <p>Croydon's 400-capacity conference centre was due to be the tour's first port of call for three nights from 30 August. Bentley, who has visited Britain several times before, most recently in December, was also due to visit Portadown in County Armagh, Liverpool and Cwmbran in south Wales.</p> <p>His planned visit had sparked alarm among those critical of his controversial style of preaching, which he has said often involves \"curing\" people of diseases, including cancer, by means of physical force. In <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97WA46li9s8\" title=\"\">various videos posted online</a>, the self-styled \"preacher with the tattoos\" claims he once choked a man to health; in one he claims he banged a woman's legs \"up and down on the platform like a baseball bat\" until she was miraculously healed.</p> <p>In one typical claim, he is filmed telling an audience: \"And the Holy Spirit spoke to me, the gift of faith came on me. He said, 'kick her in the face with your biker boot'. I inched closer and I went like this \u2013 bam! And just as my boot made contact with her nose, she fell under the power of God.\"</p> <p>In 2008, Bentley gained international attention when he led a series of revivalist meetings in Florida which drew thousands of people and came to be known as the Lakeland Outpouring. But his reputation as a man of God subsequently took a battering amid allegations about his private life. He was also the subject of a documentary on Nightline, the ABC news programme, which questioned the validity of his claims.</p> <p>Expressing his disappointment on the Facebook page of his church, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/freshfireusa\" title=\"\">Fresh Fire USA</a>, Bentley wrote: \"They have no legal basis for their accusation. I did all their visa process and fingerprinting and security. This decision was made before any of my application was processed. It is based on internet, media and false perception they have not followed up on. I think this is big news! USA immigration saw fit to receive me into the country. The UK government never asked our side of the story or gave any process for discussion. Disappointing but God wins!\"</p>",
  "<p>Profits at Best Buy, the US's biggest consumer electronics retailer, plummeted 91% in the second quarter, an announcement that came a day after the company named a new chief executive.</p> <p>The troubled retail chain saw sales drop both in the US and internationally, but the biggest hit came from a $91m restructuring charge, primarily related to its plans to shut down a swathe of its \"big-box\" giant retail stores. Best Buy reported a profit of $12m for the quarter ended August 4 versus $128m a year earlier.</p> <p>The company's shares hit a nine year low in early trading on the New York Stock Exchange. The shares had fallen Monday when the firm announced takeover talks with founder Richard Schulze had collapsed and that Hubert Joly, who specialises in corporate turnarounds, would take over as CEO.</p> <p>The firm has been without a full-time CEO since April when former boss Brian Dunn, 51, left Best Buy with a $6.6m payoff after what the company described as \"close personal relationship\" with a 29-year-old female employee that \"negatively impacted the work environment\".</p> <p>Joly is the former head of Carlson, a hospitality company that owns TGI Fridays among other brands. Analysts were disappointed by his lack of retail experience. Joly, who is French, is expected to start in September when his visa is secured. \"We believe that this is a herculean task even for an accomplished retail executive and believe that Mr Joly's complete lack of retail experience will be an impediment to his success,\" Wedbush Securities analyst Michael Pachter wrote in a research note.</p> <p>Joly faces a corporate as well as a financial challenge at the company. Schulze has offered to take the company private for $9bn. Schulze, who grew the chain from a single store and was its chief executive for 36 years, owns 20% of Best Buy. The talks stalled ahead of the appointment of Joly and the earnings announcement. Schultze said he was \"disappointed and surprised by the Best Buy Board's abrupt termination of our discussions.\"</p> <p>Best Buy has seen off real world rivals including Circuit City, which filed for bankruptcy in 2008, to emerge as the last large electronic retail chain in the US. But it too is struggling with increased competition from Amazon and other online retailers. Along with its real-world rivals Best Buy suffers from what retail analysts call \"show-rooming\" when potential customers try products in store then go home to purchase them cheaper online.</p> <p>In March Best Buy announced plans to shut 50 stores as part of an $800m cost saving drive. In its latest results Best Buy said it had reduced its US big box square footage by 4% year-over-year and that domestic revenue per square foot were up 1% year-over-year. </p> <p>Sales from stores, call centers and websites operating for at least 14 months \u2013 known as same-store sales \u2013 fell 3.2% in the latest period. Best Buy's US same-store sales fell 1.6%, while internationally sales dropped 8.2% with the company blaming lower sales in China, Canada and \"increased competitive conditions in Europe\". Sales of mobile devices including eReaders and smartphones soared but were offset by falling sales for notebooks, TVs, cameras and other items.</p> <p>The company declined to give any guidance on future sales but on a conference call with analysts executives said they were more confident about the second half of their financial year, traditionally the largest sales period for retailers.</p> <p>Best Buy made a $1.34bn (then \u00a31bn) investment in Carphone Warehouse in the UK in 2008 and had planned to open branches across Britain. The venture failed and it shut its larger Best Buy stores in the UK. The two companies retain a joint venture called Best Buy Europe.</p> <p>Same-store sales at Best Buy have declined for two of the last three years. The company posted a net loss of $1.23bn on revenue of $50.7bn for the year that ended in March, its first annual loss since 1991.</p>",

Is this because western media outlets have suddenly developed a new-found devotion to defending civil liberties in Latin America? Please. To pose the question is to mock it. </p> <p>It's because feigning concern for these oppressive measures is a convenient instrument for demeaning and punishing Ecuador for the supreme crime of defying the US and its western allies. The government of President Rafael Correa granted asylum to western establishmentarians' most despised figure, Julian Assange, and Correa's government then <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/aug/20/julian-assange-uk-south-america\">loudly condemned</a> Britain's implied threats to invade its embassy. Ecuador must therefore be publicly flogged for its impertinence, and its press freedom record is a readily available whip. As a fun bonus, denunciations of Correa's media oppression is a cheap and easy way to deride Assange's supposed hypocrisy. </p> <p>(Apparently, activists should only seek asylum from countries with pristine human rights records, whichever countries those might be: a newly concocted standard that was conspicuously missing during the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/apr/27/chen-guangcheng-safe-american-embassy\">saga of blind Chinese human rights activist Chen Guangcheng at the US embassy</a>; I don't recall any western media outlets accusing Guangcheng of hypocrisy for seeking refuge from a country that <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2011/03/07/AR2011030704871.html\">indefinitely imprisons</a> people with no charges, attacked Iraq, <a href=\"http://www.thenation.com/blog/163724/assassinating-awlaki-obama-can-kill-anyone-he-wants\">assassinates its own citizens</a> with no due process on the secret orders of the president, <a href=\"http://www.thebureauinvestigates.com/2012/02/04/obama-terror-drones-cia-tactics-in-pakistan-include-targeting-rescuers-and-funerals/\">bombs funerals and rescuers</a> in Pakistan, uses <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jul/25/nypd-occupy-protests-report\">extreme force and mass arrests</a> to try to obliterate the peaceful Occupy protest movement, wages an <a href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2012/06/obamas-whistleblowers-stuxnet-leaks-drones\">unprecedented war on whistleblowers</a>, prosecutes its Muslim citizens for <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2011/09/04/speech_23/\">posting YouTube videos</a> critical of US foreign policy, <a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/readout-presidents-meeting-with-king-abdullah-saudi-arabia\">embraces</a> and <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/12/world/middleeast/bahrain-us-arms-sales-to-resume.html\">arms</a> the world's most oppressive regimes, and <a href=\"http://www.democracynow.org/2007/7/19/sami_al_haj_and_bilal_hussein\">imprisoned Muslim journalists</a> for years at Guant\u00e1namo and elsewhere with no charges of any kind.)</p> <p>But this behavior illustrates how purported human rights concerns are cynically exploited as a weapon by western governments and, more inexcusably, by their nationalistic, self-righteous media enablers. Concern over a foreign regime's human rights abuses are muted, often nonexistent, when those regimes dutifully adhere to US dictates, but are amplified to deafening levels when nations defy those dictates and, especially, when it's time to wage war against them. This is why attacks on protesters by US-supported regimes in Bahrain and Saudi Arabia are typically described by western media outlets with the innocuous-sounding, both-sides-are-to-blame term \"clashes with rebels\", while villain-of-the-moment regimes in Iran, Syria or Libya are said to be slaughtering their own citizens. It's why arming Syrian rebels to enable them to defend against regime oppression is conventional wisdom, whereas arming Palestinian rebels to defend against Israeli violence is criminal.</p> <p>The classic case of this dynamic is the outburst of indignation in 2003 over \u2013 <a href=\"http://hnn.us/articles/862.html\">all together now</a> \u2013 Saddam's \"gassing of his own people\": something he had done 15 years earlier, in 1988, when the US was arming and funding him and had multiple interests in its relationship with Iraq, and thus evinced little care about any of that. It was only when it was time to demonize Saddam in order to justify the attack did western governments and their media outlets suddenly discover their retroactive rage over those crimes.</p> <p>This exploitation of human rights concerns drives even the most seemingly straightforward cases, such as the universal condemnation among All Decent People of Russia's obviously repellent punishment of Pussy Riot, the anti-capitalist, hardcore-leftwing punk rock band. As the Russian journalist Vadim Nikitin demonstrates in a <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/21/opinion/the-wrong-reasons-to-back-pussy-riot.html\">New York Times op-ed Tuesday</a>, western denunciations of Russia's disregard for free speech are shaped far more by opportunism than anything authentic [my emphasis]:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"Pussy Riot and its comrades at Voina come as a full package: you can't have the fun, pro-democracy, anti-Putin feminism without the incendiary anarchism, extreme sexual provocations, deliberate obscenity and hard-left politics. Unless you are comfortable with all that (and I strongly suspect 99% of Pussy Riot's fans in the mainstream media are not), then standing behind Pussy Riot only now, when it is obviously blameless and the government clearly guilty, is pure opportunism. And just like in the bad old days, such knee-jerk yet selective support for Russian dissidents \u2013 without fully engaging with their ideas \u2013 is not only hypocritical but also does a great disservice to their cause.</p> <p>\"A former Soviet dissident and current member of the anti-Putin opposition, Eduard Limonov, knows such cynicism too well. Thrown out of the Soviet Union and welcomed in New York as a cold war trophy, Limonov soon learned that it wasn't the dissent part that the United States loved about Soviet dissidents, but their anti-communism. A bristly and provocative anti-Soviet leftist, he got to work doing what he did best \u2013 taking on the establishment \u2013 and quickly found himself in hot water again, this time with the Americans. <em>Limonov concluded that 'the FBI is just as zealous in putting down American radicals as the KGB is with its own radicals and dissidents.'</em>\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Nikitin notes what most western media accounts have ignored about Pussy Riot: its lead singer's \"participation, naked and heavily pregnant, in a public orgy at a Moscow museum in 2008\", sponsored by a radical art group that \"had previously set fire to a police car and drew obscene images on a St Petersburg drawbridge\". Those acts, he accurately observes, \"would get you arrested just about anywhere, not just in authoritarian Russia\".</p> <p>Does anyone think that an American media that stands by complacently while excessive force and mass arrests are unleashed on the far more peaceful Occupy movement, or which says nothing about the systematic prosecution of American Muslims for core free-speech activities, possesses some sort of genuine concern for free speech and free assembly rights in Russia? As Nikitin rhetorically asks:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"Twenty years after the end of the cold war, are dissident intellectuals once again in danger of becoming pawns in the west's anti-Russian narrative?\"</p> </blockquote> <p>That's how human rights advocacy is typically used by the west's establishment media: as a thinly disguised instrument for advancing nationalistic goals and, more insidiously, for their individual and collective self-affirmation. There is a huge industry of American political and foreign policy commentators who love to prance around together flamboyantly condemning the rights abuses of other people's governments, while spending very little time and energy condemning abuses by their own.</p> <p>One of the most vivid examples of this warped dynamic is the <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2009/05/11/journalists_6/\">extremely disparate reaction</a> from the American commentariat when journalists are imprisoned by Bad Foreign Governments as opposed to their own. For seven years, the US <a href=\"http://www.cjr.org/cover_story/prisoner_345.php\">imprisoned an al-Jazeera cameraman</a>, Sami al-Haj, at Guant\u00e1namo with no charges and spent most of that time interrogating him not about al-Qaida, but about al-Jazeera. With <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/14/opinion/14kristof.html?_r=1&amp;hp&amp;oref=slogin\">very few exceptions</a>, American media figures <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2009/05/11/journalists_6/\">failed even to mention</a>, let alone condemn, the due process-free imprisonment of this journalist by their own government. The same silence characterized their reaction to the <a href=\"cpj.org/2007/11/us-says-ap-photographer-in-iraq-will-be-charged.php\">imprisonment of other Muslim journalists</a> over the last decade by the US government.</p> <p>By very stark contrast, when Iran imprisoned the Iranian-American journalist Roxana Saberi on espionage charges before releasing her five months after her arrest, countless American journalists and self-styled human rights advocates in the media were so very proud of their bold denunciation of the distant Iranian regime, turning the Saberi case <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2009/05/11/journalists_6/\">into a cause celebre</a>. Exactly the same thing happened with the <a href=\"http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1903344,00.html#ixzz24BE3S08z\">2009 conviction and imprisonment</a> by North Korea of American journalists Euna Lee and Laura Ling: American journalists so courageously condemned the tyranny of North Korea.</p> <p>Fixating on the rights abuses of distant governments while largely ignoring those committed by one's own does not only demonstrate the glaring insincerity of the purported beliefs. Far worse, it is an abdication of one's primary duty as a journalist and as a citizen: to oppose, first and foremost, the bad acts of one's own government. Noam Chomsky <a href=\"http://www.islamophobiatoday.com/2012/03/14/whats-never-trending-on-twitter-u-s-has-killed-way-more-people-than-the-lras-joseph-kony/\">put this best</a> when asked why he spends the bulk of his time on the crimes of his own government (and its client states) rather than on America's enemies:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"My own concern is primarily the terror and violence carried out by my own state, for two reasons. For one thing, because it happens to be the larger component of international violence. But also for a much more important reason than that: namely, I can do something about it. So even if the US was responsible for 2% of the violence in the world instead of the majority of it, it would be that 2% I would be primarily responsible for. And that is a simple ethical judgment. That is, the ethical value of one's actions depends on their anticipated and predictable consequences. <em>It is very easy to denounce the atrocities of someone else. That has about as much ethical value as denouncing atrocities that took place in the 18th century.</em>\"</p> </blockquote> <p>An eagerness to condemn abuses by foreign governments while largely ignoring one's own is not merely cowardly, though it is that. And it's not merely an abdication of the prime journalistic duty, though it is that, too. Worst of all, it's the media behavior that most effectively bolsters state propaganda, as it signals to the citizenry: human rights violations and civil liberties assaults are something those Bad Foreign Governments over there do, but not your own.</p> <p>I would take more seriously all of this very inspirational, newfound worry about Ecuadorian press freedoms and Russian free speech rights on the part of Western media figures if they evinced any similar interest in infringements and abuses by their own governments and their allies: ones much more difficult, though much more consequential, to oppose.</p>",

But it seems many still prefer cash: according to ATM operator Link, during the Olympics fortnight \u00a36.108bn was withdrawn from its network, an increase of 4.6% on the same two weeks in 2011.</p> <p>Visa says it is \"pleased with consumers' response to the technology\" and that it \"gained many useful insights that will help make contactless a commonplace payment method\".</p> <p>It suggests that by 2020 half of all transactions over its network will be through a mobile device and, featuring the obligatory sporting reference, a spokesperson adds: \"We recognise that the journey is a marathon, not a sprint.\" But at the moment it looks like a race where almost none of the crowd is cheering them on.</p> <p>Contactless has so far failed to ignite much enthusiasm among UK spenders, but nor do retailers seem keen to promote it. I have carried a contactless card for six months and have never been prompted to use it.</p> <p>When I visited the Olympic venues I took sandwiches, so am not sure if retailers were pushing it at all. Were you asked if you wanted to use contactless during the Games? Will it remain a minority sport, or will we look back in four years' time and wonder why we resisted?</p>",
  "<p><strong>1. How did you come to write </strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/fiction/9780857864185/the-testament-of-jessie-lamb\" title=\"\"><strong>The Testament of Jessie Lamb</strong></a><strong>?</strong><br>There were three starting points: I wanted to write about a young woman who is heroic, and to explore what her heroism might mean to those around her; I wanted to explore the moment in a child's life when the child first seriously defies her parents and becomes an individual in her own right \u2013 and I wanted to explore that from both sides, the girl's and the parents', thinking about how loss of control over a child can seem appalling to a parent; and I had a sense of an icy cold place where something terrible, some abuse of scientific knowledge, was taking place. The strange cold place was not somewhere I know; I imagined a scientific research station maybe in the Arctic, somewhere very remote.</p> <p><strong>2. What was most difficult about it?</strong><br>Getting Jessie's voice right. She had to be convincing as a 16 year old, but I didn't want to use the actual language and speech mannerisms of a contemporary 16 year old, because it would drive me mad. At the time I was writing, a faithful rendition would have involved using \"like\" every second word. I was anxious about boring the reader with very young and simple language, and in early drafts I included sections from her father's point of view because I didn't trust Jessie's voice enough to carry the whole book. What helped me with the voice was rereading <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/history/9780141315188/the-diary-of-a-young-girl-definitive-edition\" title=\"\">the diary of Anne Frank</a>; Anne's bubbly, optimistic, joyous personality shines through her writing, even though she is in a very dark place. I tried to aim for something similar for Jessie.</p> <p><strong>3. What did you most enjoy?</strong><br>I applied for an Arts Council fellowship award to work on this book at the Banff Centre in Canada, citing as one of my reasons for applying that I needed to research a frozen landscape. I was there for 12 weeks in winter and it was stunningly beautiful. I was given a warm writer's cabin in snowy woods and didn't have to think about anything but the novel, and that really kickstarted it. The irony was that in the end I abandoned the icy research centre setting because I realised that Jessie needed to be living in a much more ordinary world. All the snow and ice of the Canadian Rockies was reduced in the novel to one rather cold bus ride through blue-ish evening snow in [Greater Manchester's] Ashton-under-Lyne. I hope that maybe there is still some of the whiteness and brightness from Banff in there somewhere though.</p> <p><strong>4. How long did it take?</strong><br>Five years. I rewrite endlessly. At one point it was more than double its current length.</p> <p><strong>5. What has changed for you since it was first published?</strong><br><a href=\"http://www.themanbookerprize.com/node/949\" title=\"\">The [2011] Booker longlisting</a>, and then the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/may/03/jane-rogers-arthur-c-clarke-2012\" title=\"\">Arthur C Clarke award</a>, have drawn it to people's attention and given it higher visibility than it first had. Which has been great, since it is now published in the States and Canada, with Korean, Japanese, German and hopefully other editions to follow.</p> <p><strong>6. Who's your favourite writer?</strong><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/fyodordostoevsky\" title=\"\">Fyodor Dostoevsky</a>.</p> <p><strong>7. What are your other inspirations?</strong><br>Place, and other writers, are my two greatest sources of ideas. For all my novels there is a place and particular atmosphere that feels like some kind of key (most clearly for me, Raasay in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/fiction/9780349112299/island\" title=\"\">Island</a>. For Jessie, it was Banff). Novels that were inspirational for Jessie Lamb include <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/philiproth\" title=\"\">Philip Roth</a>'s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/fiction/9780099771814/american-pastoral\" title=\"\">American Pastoral</a> (Swede's incomprehensible, rebellious daughter), <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/kazuoishiguro\" title=\"\">Kazuo Ishiguro</a>'s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/fiction/9780571258093/never-let-me-go\" title=\"\">Never Let Me Go</a> (for the use of a parallel/future world, and the idea of self-sacrifice), and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/johnwyndham\" title=\"\">John Wyndham</a>'s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/science-fiction/9780141032979/the-chrysalids\" title=\"\">The Chrysalids</a> as a model of the type of book I wanted to write. For a brilliant plot template, I looked at <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/author/euripides\" title=\"\">Euripides</a>' Iphigenia in Aulis, which is the same story \u2013 a young girl commits to an heroic act, against the wishes of her parents.</p> <p><strong>8. Give us a writing tip.</strong><br>When you can't write, write drivel. Some days you know that every word you write is crap, but if you write it anyway, there is something to cross out and improve on the next day.</p> <p><strong>9. What, if anything, would you do differently if you were starting the book again?</strong><br>I don't know. I'd find a way to write it faster, but since every novel apart from my second one has always taken me at least four years, I guess I have to accept that my method of writing too much and then carving a novel out of it is all I know how to do.</p> <p><strong>10. What are you working on now?</strong><br>Just putting the finishing touches to a collection of stories due out in the autumn.</p> <p>\u2022 The Testament of Jessie Lamb is published by Sandstone Press, \u00a37.99. Jane Rogers appears at the Edinburgh international book festival on 25 August</p>",
  "<p>India's highest court is due to hear a case that could decide whether cut-price generic drugs for cancer and other serious conditions will continue to be available in much of the developing world.</p> <p>The long-running case, which resumes in Delhi on Wednesday, has been brought by the Swiss pharmaceutical company Novartis. It wants an Indian patent for its leukaemia drug imatinib mesylate, which has been patented as Glivec in nearly 40 countries including China, Russia, Mexico, Taiwan, Germany and the UK, and Gleevec in the US.</p> <p>Novartis says the legal move is \"about protecting intellectual property to advance the practice of medicine, not about changing access to medicines\", according to Ranjit Shahani, the vice-chairman and managing director of Novartis India. But campaigners argue that a victory for Novartis could result in the deaths of thousands of people who will no longer be able to afford the drugs they need.</p> <p>\"It would quite simply be a death sentence for us,\" said Vikas Ahuja, who was diagnosed with HIV in 1993 and is now the president of the Delhi Network of Positive People. \"I am quite sure that if Novartis wins, other multinationals will follow suit and other drugs will become prohibitively expensive.\"</p> <p>M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res (MSF) believes the ramifications of a Novartis win would be felt beyond India's borders. \"If Novartis won the case, patents would be granted in India as broadly as they are in wealthy countries and on new formulations of known medicines already in use,\" <a href=\"http://www.msfaccess.org/content/qa-patents-india-and-novartis-case\" title=\"\">MSF says in a Q&amp;A on its website</a>.</p> <p>\"India would no longer be able to supply much of the developing world with quality affordable medicines \u2026 More and more treatments will remain priced out of reach for the duration of the patent term \u2013 20 years or more \u2013 including those that are merely new forms of existing medicine and didn't deserve a patent in the first place.\"</p> <p>Indian generic medicines are among <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/poverty-matters/2012/jul/26/pharmaceutical-companies-health-worlds-poor-risk\" title=\"\">the cheapest in the world</a>, largely because India did not issue patents on drugs until 2005 after coming under pressure from the World Trade Organisation. Its size also means it has the production capacity to manufacture reliable and safe copies of branded medicines.</p> <p>As a result, India now makes one-fifth of the world's generics, such as antiretroviral medicines used to treat HIV and Aids. About half are sent abroad, mostly to other developing countries.</p> <p>Even if Novartis wins, generic versions of Glivec will still be available in India because it came on the market before 2005 and is protected under a so-called \"grandfather clause\" in Indian patent law, said Shahani.</p> <p>This week's supreme court case is the final chapter in a legal spat that has rumbled on since 2006, when Novartis first tried and failed to patent Glivec. At that time, the drug was sold at \u00a31,650 per patient per month in countries where Novartis had obtained a patent. In India, generic versions of Glivec were available for less than \u00a3127 per patient per month in 2006.</p> <p>The patent office in Chennai rejected the claim on the grounds that the drug was not sufficiently new, but a slightly modified update of an older medicine. When India finally introduced a patent law seven years ago, it included a clause which decreed that \"patentability\" shall be granted only if pharmaceutical companies can prove \"enhanced efficacy\".</p> <p>This legal provision aims to stop firms from seeking patents or extensions based on minor changes to existing treatments \u2013 a practice known as \"evergreening\" that is common in Europe and the US. The clause has allowed India to reject patents for a range of older drugs for cancer, Aids, tuberculosis, malaria and other illnesses that are made by India's generics industry.</p> <p>Given India's own poverty \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/article3013870.ece\" title=\"\">30% of the population earn less than 32p a day</a> \u2013 many argue the limits still make sense domestically, particularly as Indian patients bear at least 80% of their own medical costs. Branded and patented drugs are often 10 to 40 times more expensive than generics.</p> <p>Shahani said Novartis had brought the case to clarify India's investment environment. \"Knowing we can rely on patents in India benefits government, industry and patients because research-based organisations will know if investing in the development of better medicines for India is a viable long-term option,\" he said in an email on Tuesday.</p> <p>\"As one of the largest manufacturers of generic medicines in the world, Novartis understands the role played by legitimate generics and recognises that access to medicines is a far more complicated issue involving lack of diagnosis, infrastructure and distribution and goes beyond just making generic drugs available,\" Shahani argued.</p> <p>\"Without patents there will be no new drugs and without new drugs there will be no new generics. Governments, NGOs and companies need to work together to find innovative solutions to these issues.\"</p> <p>But those whose lives depend on affordable drugs are not reassured. \"Why do pharmaceutical companies spend so much on research that they can only make drugs rich people can afford?\" said Ahuja, whose organisation is party to the supreme court case, along with the Indian government and the Cancer Patients Aid Association.</p> <p>\"If they are only going to serve a certain class of people, they should say so in their advertising, rather than pretending to be so altruistic.\"</p>",
  "<p>Oh dear, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2012/aug/21/uk-public-finances-deficit-borrowing\" title=\"\">tax receipts were down in July and government borrowing was up</a>. That's exactly where the British economy doesn't need to be in the sixth summer of the protracted global economic crisis; the downward spiral in which remedial action merely reinforces underlying weakness elsewhere in the system.</p> <p>It raises the prospect that rival camps \u2013 those who believe in public spending cuts as the cure-all, and those who believe just the opposite \u2013 will become more frantic in their advocacy of alternatives, which are never cost-free. But there are no panaceas, and calmer voices that don't claim to have one are the wisest.</p> <p>Today's figures caught the City by surprise. Analysts had expected a \u00a32.5bn debt repayment, not borrowing of \u00a3500m, just as <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2012/aug/15/uk-unemployment-falls-olympics-temporary-jobs\" title=\"\">last week's unexpected 46,000 fall in the UK jobless total</a> caught most people by surprise and <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2190412/Iain-Duncan-Smith-BBC-Economics-Editor-Stephanie-Flanders-accused-showing-pro-Labour-bias.html\" title=\"\">enraged the tabloids</a> when the BBC's economics editor, Stephanie Flanders, was sceptical about their meaning.</p> <p>But we should always be sceptical about any one set of figures, especially when they are more volatile and unpredictable than usual as the world struggles to remember lessons from past recessions \u2013 as <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2012/aug/19/eurozone-latin-america-debt-crisis-1980\" title=\"\">Larry Elliott pointed out here on Monday</a>. Did the Olympics really boost the jobless figures, or are they plain wrong? Why did inflation edge up again when we are constantly assured the growth capacity of the economy is so feeble it can't be a serious threat? Why exactly have North Sea gas and oil tax revenues dipped so sharply?</p> <p>When we don't really know we should say so. But there's no alternative to hard slog, and smarter decisions on everything from tax rates and education to investment \u2013 not to mention disinvestment. The latter seems more popular with many British owners of capital who queue up to grab their cash from foreign buyers and run \u2013 despite getting most of the deregulation, flexible labour laws and soft tax regimes they first asked Margaret Thatcher for 30 years ago.</p> <p>For want of an alternative hero this summer the Tory panacea merchants are trumpeting Michael Gove's reforms to school structures and curriculums. On Andrew Lansley's health reforms they are strangely silent, perhaps because Gove is better at courting columnists. The Gove-ites make several good points, but they do not have a panacea.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-394997826\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/21/1345552917029/Daniel-Hannan-001.jpg\" alt=\"Daniel Hannan\" width=\"220\" height=\"348\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Daniel Hannan MEP. Photograph: Dominic Lipinski/PA</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dominic Lipinski/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Yet the most pernicious faux-panacea in sight at this dangerous juncture remains the Eurosceptic lobby, whose siren voice this month has been Daniel Hannan, the Tory MEP and publicist whose latest polemic, A Doomed Marriage (Notting Hill Books, \u00a312), has been serialised in the Daily Mail. <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2188453/The-case-Europe-MEP-Daniel-Hannan-reveals-disturbing-contempt-democracy-heart-EU.html?ito=feeds-newsxml\" title=\"\">Here</a>'s a sample \u2014 and just for luck, <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2189465/We-CAN-break-free-shackles-Brussels.html\" title=\"\">here's another</a>.</p> <p>If only Britain could break free from Brussels and restore its destiny as the outward-looking global trading nation it was before that federalist bureaucrat Ted Heath took us into Europe at the nadir of our postwar fortunes in 1973, cries Dan.</p> <p>At work, at play, in family life, the cry for freedom is often \u2013 more often? \u2013 an illusory one. Since Dan is using the matrimonial analogy he should know, as a good, cultural conservative, that divorce can be a guarantee of familiar problems bathed in regret as much as a solution. He wants Britain to be more like Switzerland, Norway or even Qatar.</p> <p>OK Dan, if you say so. But being a bit more like Germany might be nice, though I did hear a startled Portuguese who had left her family to work there saying on the radio this week that, contrary to what Germans keep telling her, the Portuguese work much harder. No panacea there either.</p> <p>The awkward fact for the Eurosceptics is that, annoying though EU regulations are, foolishly designed though the euro-currency project was, feeble though Brussels foreign policy usually manages to become, there's nothing to stop us doing most of what we want as a country \u2013 if we still have the will and capacity to do it.</p> <p>We can export all we want to India or China. No one stops us. We can give rich Chinese tourists (I've never typed that before) a better visa deal and run our own foreign policy and economy. And our banking system got into trouble with no help from those pesky Europeans. We kept our own currency (Hannan rarely credits Gordon Brown for that) and have devalued it mightily since 2007.</p> <p>Yet it still hasn't done the trick. Export statistics are disappointing too, and we can't blame Brussels for that either, only ourselves and the complacent view expressed by Hannan in the Mail that \"what matters to a modern economy is not its size but its tax rate, its regulatory regime and its business climate.\"</p> <p>If it was that simple we'd be doing a lot better \u2013 and China would be doing a lot worse. But no, George Osborne prefers to follow the austerity model being imposed on the eurozone by, yes, Germany. He doesn't have to do that either, but says he must. So much for illusory freedom in a downward spiral.</p>",
  "<h2>The winner</h2> <p>Critics have remarked that historical animated adventure <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/146821/brave\" title=\"\">Brave</a> doesn't quite boast the trademark originality of a Pixar film, but UK box-office has been pretty robust. Following 10 days in Scotland, Ireland and Northern Ireland that yielded \u00a32.22m, expansion last Monday into England and Wales saw seven-day takings across the whole region of just over \u00a36m, for a total to date of \u00a38.27m. The film grossed \u00a32.60m over the Friday-to-Sunday period.</p> <p>The eccentric release pattern makes comparisons with previous Pixar movies tricky: last summer, for what it's worth, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/142460/cars-2\" title=\"\">Cars 2</a> debuted with three-day takings of \u00a33.54m. On the other hand, there is one comparison it is possible to make: earlier this summer, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/148325/ice-age-4\" title=\"\">Ice Age 4: Continental Drift</a> opened in the same territories two weeks early, and boosted its opening tally in England and Wales with four days of previews. After 17 days of play in the Irish and Scottish territories and seven days in England and Wales, it stood at \u00a313.05m, compared to \u00a38.27m for Brave.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2012/aug/11/brave-pixar-young-female-film-leads\" title=\"\">Received wisdom in Hollywood</a> states that a family film with a female protagonist is a riskier proposition, since girls will see a film about a boy, but not so much vice versa. If Brave proves a solid performer, we should see this argument being advanced less often.</p> <h2>The runner-up</h2> <p>When Paul Greengrass and Matt Damon opted not to make a fourth Bourne movie, Universal certainly had cause for despondency. Could the studio extend the franchise with a new character? So far, with <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/147726/bourne-legacy\" title=\"\">The Bourne Legacy</a>, the answer would seem to be yes, with a \u00a34.62m opening for the latest instalment, starring Jeremy Renner as fellow rogue operative <a href=\"http://bourne.wikia.com/wiki/Aaron_Cross\" title=\"\">Aaron Cross</a>. Examine the small print, and it's a tad less impressive \u2013 four days of previews contributed \u00a32.52m of that total. Likewise, comparisons to previous Bourne movies do not flatter: <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/119889/bourne.ultimatum\" title=\"\">The Bourne Ultimatum</a> debuted with \u00a36.55m including \u00a31.24m from a single day of previews. Even <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/101541/bourne.supremacy\" title=\"\">The Bourne Supremacy</a>, with \u00a32.72m including \u00a3361,000 in previews, took a bit more over the official Friday-to-Sunday period than The Bourne Legacy.</p> <h2>The \u00a320m club</h2> <p>Seth Macfarlane's <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/148370/ted\" title=\"\">Ted</a> is the 10th release so far this year to crack \u00a320m at the UK box-office, and with \u00a322.19m is in fact 2012's seventh biggest hit. It's currently beaten by <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/144027/avengers\" title=\"\">Marvel Avengers Assemble</a> (\u00a351.8m), <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/141046/dark-knight-rises\" title=\"\">The Dark Knight Rises</a> (\u00a349.7m), <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/148325/ice-age-4\" title=\"\">Ice Age 4</a> (\u00a327.6m), <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/140156/spider-man-reboot\" title=\"\">Amazing Spider-Man</a> (\u00a325.7m), <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/145506/prometheus\" title=\"\">Prometheus</a> (\u00a324.7m) and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/142857/hunger-games\" title=\"\">The Hunger Games</a> (\u00a323.8m). However Ted has achieved its tally in just three weeks, and there's more life in the talking bear yet.</p> <p>Ted's weekend takings of \u00a32.08m meant that <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/148845/expendables-2\" title=\"\">The Expendables 2</a>, with \u00a31.99m including \u00a3435,000 in previews, landed in disappointing fourth place. Exactly two years ago, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/131950/expendables\" title=\"\">The Expendables</a> debuted at the top with \u00a33.94m, including previews totaling \u00a31.80m. Lionsgate, the film's backer, will point to the weekend heatwave experienced by much of England as an inhibiting factor, as well as a tougher competitive environment in cinemas, but it's hard not to conclude that UK audience appetite for this franchise has significantly diminished.</p> <h2>The record-breaker</h2> <p>The weekend saw <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/141046/dark-knight-rises\" title=\"\">The Dark Knight Rises</a> overtake <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/122806/dark.knight\" title=\"\">The Dark Knight</a> (\u00a349m) to become the biggest Batman movie ever at the UK box-office. It's also entered the All Time Top 20, sandwiched between Harry Potter films <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/119377/harry.potter.and.the.order.of.the.phoenix\" title=\"\">Order of the Phoenix</a> (\u00a349.9m) and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/109039/harry.potter.and.the.goblet.of.fire\" title=\"\">Goblet of Fire</a> (\u00a349.2m).</p> <p>The Dark Knight Rises was one of five films that grossed \u00a31m at the weekend (see chart, below), the first time that a quintet of pictures achieved that feat since April. Overall, there's much more strength in depth in the chart than has been observed lately, with 10th placed <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/148837/wedding-video\" title=\"\">The Wedding Video</a> grossing \u00a3333,000. This compares with just three weeks ago, when <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/146340/men-in-black-iii\" title=\"\">Men in Black 3</a> earned 10th place with just \u00a334,500, the lowest figure for a film in the UK top 10 in many years.</p> <h2>The Bollywood hit</h2> <p>Following his smash hit action comedy <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/143224/bodyguard\" title=\"\">Bodyguard</a> nearly a year ago, Salman Khan delivers another big opening with thriller Ek Tha Tiger, a globetrotting saga that sends him as a secret agent to Dublin, Istanbul, Kazakhstan and Chile. The film debuted with \u00a3543,000, including previews of \u00a3142,000. That's down on Bodyguard (\u00a3840,000 including previews of \u00a3408,000), but is nevertheless the biggest opening for a Bollywood film so far this year, eclipsing Housefull 2 (\u00a3396,000 including previews).</p> <h2>The future</h2> <p>Thanks to the arrival of Brave and Bourne, and the films' Monday openings contributing generous portions of preview takings, overall the market is 105% up on the previous weekend. However, the frame is still 22% down on the 2011 equivalent, when <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/142846/inbetweeners-movie\" title=\"\">The Inbetweeners Movie</a> contributed a colossal \u00a313.2m including previews. The coming weekend represents a huge unknown quantity for cinemas since Keith Lemon: The Film is exceptionally hard to call. Rarely has a picture been so systematically protected from assessment by professional critics. Alternatives include comedy <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/148836/watch\" title=\"\">The Watch</a>, starring Ben Stiller, Vince Vaughn, Jonah Hill and Richard Ayoade, and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/147184/three-stooges\" title=\"\">The Three Stooges</a>, the latter surely a distribution challenge in the UK. Acclaimed documentary <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/145816/imposter\" title=\"\">The Imposter</a> could make waves in a becalmed arthouse sector.

  "<p>In March 2005, when Tony Blair released the <a href=\"http://www.commissionforafrica.info/2005-report\" title=\"Commission for Africa report, downloadable\">Commission for Africa report</a> he had sponsored as prime minister, it seemed he had gathered together a winning team: a popular icon of British society, Bob Geldof; his own rival, Gordon Brown; and the best that Africa could offer by way of leaders who wanted to join Africa to the modern world \u2013 among others, South Africa's finance minister, Trevor Manuel, and Ethiopia's prime minister, Meles Zenawi.</p> <p>Meles, in particular, seemed like a younger counterpart to Nelson Mandela. Then only 50, he had been a rebel leader waging war against communist dictatorship, and was now a democrat leading Africa's oldest independent state forwards to a new age of development and modern political values. However, times change and the image of Meles at his death is a far more contradictory one. He has died aged 57 of undisclosed causes, after hospital treatment.</p> <p>Ethiopia's May 2005 elections saw protests that led to the deaths of almost 200 people with 800 wounded. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/may/26/ethiopia-election-result-meles-zenawi\" title=\"Guardian report, 26 May 2005\">European Union observers declared the elections to have failed international standards</a>, while the <a href=\"http://www.cartercenter.org/index.html\" title=\"\">Carter Centre</a>, the US-based organisation founded by former president Jimmy Carter, said they were fair notwithstanding irregularities and intimidation. The international community by and large accepted the outcome.</p> <p>Although the 2010 elections were not marred by protests of the same scale, opposition parties saw them as flawed and said the relationship between Meles's party, the Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF), and the army had created a one-party state \u2013 with opposition parties permitted only to give a semblance of democracy in order to court the west.</p> <p>From 2006 to 2009, with US assistance, the Ethiopian army mounted an invasion of neighbouring Somalia with the aim of destroying the Islamic Courts Union (ICU), the ruling Islamic militia. Fighting in Mogadishu was fierce, with many accusations of indiscriminate Ethiopian armoured tactics. But the defeat of the ICU left a space for the even more radical Al-Shabaab group, leaving the US-backed Ethiopian intervention a strategic failure.</p> <p>Meles was in the forefront of supporting the New Partnership for Africa's Development (Nepad), one of the parallel engagements between the west and Africa alongside Blair's Commission for Africa, whereby democracy would be encouraged by African peer review, and helped by western largesse.</p> <p>Meles's most prominent recent international activity was in the environmental field. He took a lead on climate change in the African Union and worked, amid great criticism from fellow African presidents, to bring African policy in line with Europe \u2013 again to be rewarded by fast-track financing from Europe.</p> <p>Zenawi was born in Adwa, Tigray, in northern Ethiopia, the son of an Ethiopian father and Eritrean mother. In his 20s, he rebelled against the Stalinist dictatorship of Mengistu Haile Mariam while a medical student at the then Haile Selassie University, Addis Ababa, and in 1975 joined the Tigrayan People's Liberation Front. He became head of its leadership committee in 1979, and of its executive committee by 1983.</p> <p>In 1991, in alliance with the Eritrean People's Liberation Front, led by Isaias Afewerki, the rebel forces swept aside the armies of Mengistu, and Meles became president of Ethiopia. He also became chair of the EPRDF, and in 1993 agreed to what seemed an amicable agreement for Eritrea to leave Ethiopia as its own independent state. But years of tension and war between the two countries were to follow. The conflict was at its bloodiest from 1998 to 2000, but the settlement of the border dispute has only ever allowed an uneasy peace.</p> <p>Meles drove Ethiopia forward with a huge range of reforms and global links. He himself, throughout the early years, found time to devote himself to study, obtaining an MBA from the Open University in 1995 and an MSc in economics from Rotterdam in 2004 \u2013 both universities sending tutors to Ethiopia to educate not only Meles but a large number of the new ruling elite.</p> <p>At the first general elections of 1995, Meles became prime minister and the EPRDF the dominant political party. He and the party were re-elected every five years subsequently. Under their government, Ethiopia has seen a dramatic lowering of infant mortality and a huge growth in education \u2013 literacy rates rose from 50% in 1997 to 65% in 2002. There has been economic growth of up to 9% per year in most of the years of the new millennium. The country has seen a huge building and housing boom. Meanwhile, controversial land-ownership policies have facilitated the agri-industry.</p> <p>The actual workings of the multi-party system have been controversial, with violence and accusations of fraud marring elections. Meles's foreign policy, while asserting Ethiopia's importance in the region and the world beyond, has had problematic consequences.</p> <p>Despite the controversies surrounding his policies, the positive elements in them were celebrated. Meles won the Norwegian Green Revolution prize, and awards for lifting much of Ethiopia out of poverty and hunger. Under his rule, Ethiopia doubled its food production.</p> <p>Perhaps the iron man who is nevertheless \"modern\", who leaves a genuine developmental legacy while making life hard for his opposition, who seeks to please the west while cementing his country's own regional interests is a necessary step on the path of African growth. Meles was pragmatic when it came to contemplating the world around him and around Africa.</p> <p>The beautiful and grand new headquarters of the African Union, opened in Addis Ababa in 2012, was financed, designed and built by Africa's new friend, China.</p> <p>Meles is survived by his wife, Azeb Mesfin, a son, Senay, and two daughters, Semhal and Marda.</p> <p><em>\u2022 </em>Meles Zenawi, rebel leader and politician, born 8 May 1955; died 20 August 2012</p>",
  "<p>Kate Bull is aptly named. She is, in the nicest possible way \u2013 bullish: determined, opinionated and single-minded. Which, when you're challenging the status quo of one of the largest industries in the country, is undoubtedly the best way to be.</p> <p>After a career in conventional retail, including spells at Marks and Spencer and running her own consultancy, Bull was determined to do things differently. In early 2010, she hooked up with two sympathisers, celebrity eco-chef Arthur Potts Dawson and regeneration specialist David Barrie, and <a href=\"http://www.thepeoplessupermarket.org/\" title=\"\">The People's Supermarket</a> [TPS] was born.</p> <p>Her retail savvy shows in TPS's choice of site. It sits in London's smartly bohemian Lamb's Conduit Street, well placed to draw passing trade from Great Ormond Street hospital staff, lawyers from nearby Chancery Lane and Gray's Inn, lunchtime shoppers exploring the various vintage shops and wine bars, and the area's large student population.</p> <p>I meet her in the basement lounge-office surrounded by sample products, papers and stock. Bull sports her branded TPS yellow t-shirt and offers me croissants with nectarine compote. These have been made by TPS's People's Kitchen chefs, who cook up beautifully-smelling food on the shop floor, with compote courtesy of one of their many local cottage-industry suppliers. There's a deliberately neighbourly feel to the place, reflecting Bull's optimistic vision of a new form of community co-op which brings shoppers, traders and local food producers together in a style more akin to a community centre than a supermarket. As if on cue, a mum and her daughters arrive and register eagerly in the weekend's bake-off competition \u2013 a fundraiser for Amnesty International, suggested by Bull's 14-year-old daughter for their second anniversary.</p> <p>As a business model, TPS is definitely one of a kind. Neither traditional co-op, nor typical wholefood store, it was quite a leap of faith opening on the back of just \u00a350,000 in start-up capital \u2013 compared to around \u00a3500,000 - \u00a3750,000 minimum for a 'normal' store. This was boosted by a \u00a3130,000 loan from <a href=\"http://www.walltowall.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Wall to Wall TV</a>, which made a documentary about the first year of the store, to secure the lease. A grant from the <a href=\"http://esmeefairbairn.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Esmee Fairbairn Foundation</a> (\u00a355,000 a year for two years) covered Bull's salary, although she reinvested most of this in the business.</p> <p>Everything else required \u2013 materials, furniture, legal advice and, above all, labour, together amounting to around \u00a3600,000 worth \u2013 was donated free of charge. At the heart of the business model is the membership scheme \u2013 currently 750-strong. Members pay \u00a325 a year for the privilege of putting in four hours work a month, receiving a 20% discount on their purchases in return \u2013 along with some training. Membership conveys \"rights, roles and responsibilities\", Bull explains, including the right to vote \"on everything \u2013 salaries, suppliers, products, management.\" There are no individual liquid returns. But the combination of job skills and a sense of enthusiastic community seem more than enough by compensation.</p> <p>Indeed, members recently voted to change their legal structure from a traditional co-op to a Community Benefit Society, which ensures that any dividends will be returned to community projects chosen by members themselves. \"There will be no fat cats!\" says Bull. Instead, \"we could buy a greenhouse for the nearby <a href=\"http://www.calthorpeproject.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Calthorpe gardening project</a> which supplies us with our salads, to help extend their season.\"</p> <p>A huge pool of voluntary workers keeps staff overheads to a minimum. There are just 17 on the payroll, all of whom are paid the minimum wage. That's an awful lot of free, or at the very least cheap, labour. But Bell counters accusations of exploitation by insisting that TPS is helping people transform their lives with the skills they've learnt. It's certainly no picnic working with members who are largely untrained in retail, change shifts every four hours and are juggling all sorts of other responsibilities. On the day I visited, members working included an international student, a High Court judge and someone who is long-term unemployed.</p> <p>If the business model is distinctive, so is the store itself. It's part normal shop, part eco-store (so Fairy washing-up liquid and tins of Whiskas stand side-by-side with Ecover and organic cat food). \"We don't judge\", says Bull, \"but we do give choices.</p> <p>\"I personally may believe Coca-Cola, for instance, is one of the most dangerous products out there\", says Bull. \"But it's one of our top 10 lines. If we didn't sell it, we wouldn't have a business. But we always offer an alternative \u2013 we also sell <a href=\"http://www.ubuntucola.org/\" title=\"\">Ubuntu</a> [Fairtrade] cola. There's actually nothing we won't sell except cheap beer and alcopops. But cheap beer has no profit margin anyway, so why would we?\"</p> <p>They discriminate in favour of locally grown, seasonal fruit and veg, but will import if they have to. \"We try to give customers a choice of three \u2013 a cheap option, a recognised brand and what we call a 'brand with values'\". This might be something organic, or locally produced, or having fewer additives. With honey, for instance, you could buy a jar of 'Frank's Honey', which a member brings in from his garden in the suburbs.</p> <p>They do, however, trumpet their success at turning any wilting fruit and veg into tasty meals in their People's Kitchen, which are then sold in the shop. \"We also get vegetables donated from New Covent Garden [wholesale market] that might otherwise be dumped \u2013 it happened this week with three large boxes of perfect green tomatoes from Mexico that were no longer wanted. We made them into lasagne and chutneys in recycled jars. What a saving of all those global resources!\" This year they calculate they saved three tonnes of waste from landfill and created 20,000 meals using surplus fruit and veg.</p> <p>So is it a standard bearer of a retail revolution? Innovations charity <a href=\"http://www.nesta.org.uk/\" title=\"\">NESTA</a> seems to think so. Mark Griffiths from its Public Services Lab applauds its \"moral purpose with commercial acumen\", and highlights its \"new forms of volunteering, new ways of organising, new ways of minimising the wastage of food\u2026\"</p> <p>Retail analyst Neil Saunders of agency <a href=\"http://conlumino.com/\" title=\"\">Conlumino</a> agrees: \"There is a backlash against the Big Four supermarkets, and this is a community-based, sustainable way of addressing the issues people don't like.\" But, he cautions that \"it does occupy a distinct niche. It has limited scope in terms of rolling out as a mainstream proposition. It's not everyone's cup of tea and doesn't fit the image of a supermarket that many people are used to.\"</p> <p>Talking to Bull on the supermarket's second birthday, she agrees it's been a roller coaster ride. The lowest point was when she talked Camden Council's bailiffs out of closing them down, when they couldn't pay their business rates this February. She negotiated staged payments over a cup of tea on their donated leather sofas and kept the doors open.</p> <p>It sounds precarious, but TPS's distinct appeal helped it raise \u00a37,000 in a week's worth of digital fundraising \u2013 with donations coming in from across the globe. Even so, it took The Fredericks Foundation to step up with a \u00a320,000 loan hours before the supermarket was going to shut.</p> <p>It was a close call which helped focus members' minds on choosing products that increase footfall or have larger profit margins. One result was a recent vote to start selling cigarettes, which Bull describes as \"the most heated argument members have ever had\". Other plans include starting an external caterers and setting up local market stalls, both as extra income streams and to promote the shop.</p> <p>There is a clear sense from everyone involved that failure is not an option. Sales, at least, are pointing the right way. In the year 2011/12, takings rose by 53%. And as Bull points out, \"In two years we've created a business with \u00a31.2m turnover from zero, with gross profits of \u00a3368,000. We started with no cash and we've never had an overdraft\u2026 This year we have a loss of \u00a392,000 after overheads, but I think next year we'll make a surplus.\"</p> <p>And the story does seem to have struck a chord. Fourteen groups in the UK are interested in setting up their own version, and Bull hopes to see them take root as franchises \"on an open source model\" \u2013 using the TPS's name and values, but without the original shop benefiting financially.</p> <p>She may have time to help realise this after she stands down as CEO, a move planned for this summer \u2013 \"this is a community, not a vehicle for any one person's ego\", she says, although the chances are she will be offered the position of Chair.</p> <p>Can she ever imagine going back to mainstream retail? I don't expect her to say yes, but she does. \"Possibly. I love it. But only if they allowed me to challenge things. I didn't like the way retail was going and I could have spent my life moaning. But [if you want change], sometimes you just have to get on and do it.\"</p> <p><em>Sue Wheat is a freelance journalist</em></p>",
  "<p>We tend to think of them as old-fashioned throwbacks to a bygone era, but in political circles Britain's seaside resorts are more important than ever. They contributed a little noticed but important part to the New Labour coalition in 1997, with once rock-solid Tory resorts like Thanet South, Hove, Brighton, Blackpool North and South, Hastings and Rye all turning red for the first time.</p> <p>Labour lost almost all of these seats in the 2005 and 2010 elections, and they will be key battlegrounds at the next election, and Labour will need to win most of them to have any hopes of gaining a majority. The question is, can Labour turn the tide?</p> <p>Since the <a href=\"http://www.culture.gov.uk/news/news_stories/9290.aspx\" title=\"\">Olympics</a>, tourism has risen higher up the political agenda than ever before. According to a recent Deloitte study for Visit Britain, <a href=\"http://www.deloitte.com/view/en_GB/uk/industries/thl/f9590b98fc001210VgnVCM100000ba42f00aRCRD.htm\" title=\"\">The Economic Contribution of the Visitor Economy</a>, the UK's tourism industry was worth \u00a3115.4bn in 2009, equivalent to 8.9% of UK GDP. Tourism contributes \u00a396.7bn to the economy in England (8.6% of GDP), \u00a311.1bn in Scotland (10.4%), \u00a36.2bn in Wales (13.3%) and \u00a31.5bn in Northern Ireland (4.9%).</p> <p>The Deloitte study found that the number of jobs that tourism supports is forecast to increase by 250,000 between 2010 and 2020, from 2.645 million to 2.899 million and that one in 12 jobs in the UK is currently either directly or indirectly supported by tourism.</p> <p>However, the decline in Britons spending their main holiday, or indeed any holiday, at the seaside is one factor that has led to a crisis affecting many resorts, even as the tourism market grows. Many are in urgent need of the lifeboat.</p> <p>A <a href=\"http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmselect/cmcomloc/351/35102.htm\" title=\"\">parliamentary report on coastal towns</a> argued that the government has no specific policy or initiatives, based upon the premise that they are too diverse to warrant such an approach. The report highlighted that resorts suffered from physical isolation, deprivation, the inward migration of older people, high levels of transience, the outward migration of young people, poor-quality housing and the nature of the coastal economy. The report said: \"Excluding their physical location, none of these characteristics are unique to coastal towns. The combination of these characteristics, however, with the environmental challenges that coastal towns face, does lead to a conclusion that they are in need of focused, specific government attention.\"</p> <p>The majority of <a href=\"http://www.coastalcommunities.co.uk/regeneration-handbook/english-seaside-towns-past-present-and-future\" title=\"\">seaside resorts</a> are essentially one-industry towns, relying on tourism, and competing against an ever-growing and better-priced alternative overseas. They are usually, by definition, in peripheral locations with what have been described as \"180-degree economies\". Tourism is also seasonal and is notorious for providing low-paid, low-skilled and low-status jobs. Of the businesses that do survive, many are national chains of pubs, hotels and shops rather than independent local entrepreneurs. Tourist spending is thus hardly guaranteed to remain in the local economy, although <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/aug/15/totnes-war-global-capitalism\" title=\"\">some towns have been fighting the trend</a>.</p> <p>Many seaside towns have relatively large dependent populations who create additional demands on health and social services. Former holiday accommodation has frequently been converted into DSS housing and, more recently, hostels for refugees and asylum seekers. Unemployment in seaside resorts is often comparable to inner-city areas, reaching, for example, more than 15% in Blackpool in the winter months. Economic decline has too often led to a crumbling local infrastructure, part of a vicious circle that makes these towns even less desirable places to visit.</p> <p>Conservative policy is to cut \"red tape\" and regulation which, they argue, harms local businesses. They have abolished regional development agencies and transferred funding and resources to local councils. This should represent a golden opportunity for the Labour opposition. Many policies close to Labour's heart, such as the minimum wage, the working time directive and improved education and training, are more relevant to the tourism industry than almost any other. Even <a href=\"http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/2085781\" title=\"\">Eric Pickles</a> seems to understand this.</p> <p>It should not be forgotten that it was a Labour government that introduced the right to paid holiday for the first time. And it was the last Labour government that brought in a scheme to boost regeneration in coastal areas through investment in culture and heritage. The Commission for Architecture and the Built Environment (CABE) introduced <a href=\"http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20110118095356/http:/www.cabe.org.uk/sea-change/about\" title=\"\">Sea Change</a> to ensure that investment in cultural projects complements and enhances wider regeneration programmes.</p> <p>Diversification is absolutely crucial for seaside resorts that can no longer rely on the traditional bucket and spade holidays. Although tourism can be the catalyst for regeneration, it is not the only, or even prime, solution in every instance. The illuminations in Blackpool have been extending the season for more than 70 years. Bournemouth and Brighton are excellent examples of seaside towns that have successfully repositioned themselves as venues for conferences, exhibitions and trade fairs. There are also opportunities to develop as heritage centres, bases to visit nearby attractions or any other number of niche markets.</p> <p>The European Union, too, could have a role to play in addressing the problems facing our seaside towns. A number of resorts are located within the EU's objective one and two, and now objective three areas, and benefit from European funding.</p> <p>Seaside resorts across the UK are in the frontline in the battle to win the next election. Labour has an opportunity to demonstrate the benefits of well thought-out social and economic policies and even, perhaps, positive engagement with the EU. If it can do this, it may win the election. And, you never know, Blackpool may suddenly seem like a good choice of conference venue once again.</p>",

And while pretty villages pepper the landscape as you drift past, accommodation each night is under the stars with wild camping spots and fireplaces adding a touch of Bear Grylls to the proceedings.<br>\u2022 <em>\u00a3161pp based on two people sharing a canoe. Price includes canoe equipment, kitchen and camping equipment, maps, lock tickets and camping permits; </em><a href=\"http://www.naturetravels.co.uk\" title=\"\"><em>naturetravels.co.uk</em></a></p> <h2>Cycling in France</h2> <p>Well it would be rude not to wouldn't it, what with the British triumph in the Tour? But if the thought of hauling yourself over col after will-sapping col doesn't appeal then Cyclomundo has a more relaxing trip on offer taking in the three main lakes of the Alps \u2013 Geneva, Annecy and Bourget. The route is on river paths so you get to experience the drama of the scenery \u2013 and the coffee shops of the towns \u2013 without having a coronary.<br>\u2022 <em>Five nights from \u20ac785 which includes breakfast, three dinners, forward luggage transfer and maps but does not include bike hire; </em><a href=\"http://www.cyclomundo.com/p_geneva_three_lakes.html\" title=\"\"><em>cyclomundo.com</em></a></p> <h2>Mountain biking in Austria</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-394732850\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/pictures/2012/8/14/1344956893788/Mountain-biking-Austria-010.jpg\" alt=\"Mountain biking Austria\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mountain biking Austria</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Maybe not the first place that comes to mind when you think of mountain biking in Europe, but Austria has some beautiful and uncrowded trails just a stone's throw from major airports (if your stone takes one and a half hours to land that is). The village of Ellmau sits proudly at 2,700ft and slap bang in the middle of both the Wilder Kaiser and the Hartkaiser ranges. Take your pick from freeride, cross country and tight singletrack all with cable cars to transport you back up should your thighs require the help. Be warned though \u2013 the folks at Uphill and Downhill love going both ways. Accommodation is on a working dairy farm meaning you do not have to worry about being well fed after a hard day on the trails.<br>\u2022 <em>Seven nights for \u20ac650 which includes full-board accommodation, bike hire and airport transfers; </em><a href=\"http://www.upanddownhill.com\" title=\"\"><em>upanddownhill.com</em></a></p> <h2>Swimming with dolphins in the Azores</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-394732851\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/pictures/2012/8/14/1344956944537/Swimming-with-dolphins-008.jpg\" alt=\"Swimming with dolphins\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Swimming with dolphins</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Inspired by the Olympic aquatics centre but feel like you'd still rather swim with real fishes? Rather than just lobbing you off the side of a boat in the open ocean, Dolphin Connection takes a real interest in marine conservation and ecosystems, encouraging guests to develop their understanding of the environment they are swimming in and offering lectures on marine biology. Its week-long swimming with dolphin trips include five boat trips as well as guidance in how to develop confidence in the open water.<br>\u2022 <em>Trips run until end of October.

Tantrum Kitesurf is based in the windy and sunny town of Tarifa on Spain's south-west coast meaning you've got ample conditions to get to grips with this fast-moving sport. A week-long immersion course includes unlimited instruction and promises to have you whizzing up the learning curve faster than you can yell \"big wave!\".<br>\u2022 <em>Eight nights from \u20ac795 including accommodation, instruction, all kit hire, transfers to the beach and insurance; </em><a href=\"http://www.tantrumkitesurf.com\" title=\"\"><em>tantrumkitesurf.com</em></a></p> <h2>Hiking in Romania</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-394732853\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/pictures/2012/8/14/1344957440992/Hiking-in-Romania-008.jpg\" alt=\"Hiking in Romania\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hiking in Romania</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Hikers looking for a more off-beat challenge than the Alps need look no further than the Fagaras range. The mountains form an incredible ridgeline offering amazing views of glacial lakes and steep valleys. Walks Worldwide has an eight-day trek with accommodation in mountain huts and including two days spent trekking in the Piatra Craiului national park, home to wolf, bear and lynx. Safe to say you'll get your outdoor fix.<br>\u2022 <em>Eight days from \u00a3655pp departing 8 September and including accommodation, all meals, mountain guide and airport transfers; </em><a href=\"http://www.walksworldwide.com\" title=\"\"><em>walksworldwide.com</em></a></p> <h2>Northern Lights in Finland</h2> <p>One for romantic types. You don't have to wait until the freezing depths of mid-winter in order to witness the aurora borealis although that may make rubbing noses seem a bit more logical. Take yourself off to the remote Finnish village of Nellim on the Russian border and spend your evenings searching the skies while your days are spent hiking through hundreds of acres of wildness, pausing for picnics created using local produce. You can even pan for gold nearby which could turn it into a very successful holiday indeed.<br>\u2022 <em>Four nights from \u00a31,345pp including return flights from London, accommodation on a B&amp;B basis, some meals, airport transfers and specified activities; </em><a href=\"http://www.theaurorazone.com\" title=\"\"><em>theaurorazone.com</em></a></p>"
