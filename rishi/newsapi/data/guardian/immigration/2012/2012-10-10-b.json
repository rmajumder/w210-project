  "<p>Forget sparkling conversation or good table manners: one of the most important qualities in a dining companion, as far as I'm concerned, is a fear of tentacles. As the late, great Alan Davidson put it, \"cephalopods are eaten less than they might be because some people are repelled by their aspect\" \u2013 a fact that works out well for me if I order a plate of calamari, <a href=\"http://www.yuppiechef.co.za/spatula/baby-squid-grilled-fried/\">puntillitas</a> or <a href=\"http://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/4592/salt-and-pepper-squid\">salt and pepper squid</a> for the table.</p> <p>Grilled over wood, stuffed and roasted, slow-cooked in a stew: I love squid in all its forms (even the mysterious giant versions are <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKUreZucnz8_\">weirdly fascinating</a>) but none is more addictive than the deep fried version most commonly known as calamari. Pringles be damned: who can leave a hot, crisp cluster of tentacles on the plate?</p> <h2>A cut above</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397625968\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/10/1349878601428/Nigella-Lawson-recipe-cal-002.jpg\" alt=\"Nigella Lawson recipe calamari\" width=\"220\" height=\"132\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nigella Lawson recipe calamari.

I'm going to stick with the squid rings that, when badly cooked, have caused calamari to be compared to rubber bands. I prefer the slightly thicker, 1cm slices suggested by Nigella to the slimmer, more elegant 5mm rings used by chef Tom Aikens and Italian cookery writer <a href=\"http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1992-11-05/features/9202270796_1_olive-oil-italian-ingredients-southern-italian-cuisine/3\">Marcella Hazan</a>: there's more squid to get your teeth into. I'm also going to chop some of the pieces into flat triangles too, a cut more commonly used for Chinese salt and pepper squid, to provide a variety of textures (not that calamari really needs much more to keep me interested.)</p> <p>A chef (whose name I sadly missed as I was shovelling squid into my mouth at the time) once told me that the best way to ensure tender squid is to freeze it first; not a problem in the many places which sell \"fresh\" stuff which actually, when you get it home, is full of shards of ice. Chewiness is rarely too much of a problem with smaller squid in any case: it's the big fellows you have to watch out for.</p> <h2>The marinade</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397625969\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/10/1349877873723/Tom-Aikens-recipe-calamar-002.jpg\" alt=\"Tom Aikens recipe calamari\" width=\"220\" height=\"132\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tom Aikens recipe calamari.

While these are all, with the possible exception of rosemary, flavours I'd pair with squid, I prefer them as an accompaniment. They do nothing to soften the meat, and I want the squid itself to taste of squid, pure and simple.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/food/techniques/cleaning_squid\">Mitch Tonks dips his squid</a> in milk before coating it in flour in his <a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9781862059290\">Fish Easy book</a>: I don't find this makes much difference to the meat although the batter is very slightly sweeter and browner, but I read online that soaking the squid in milk for an hour before cooking is thought to tenderise it. I give it a try and find that it does indeed: my calamari still have bite, but they're definitely less chewy.</p> <h2>The batter</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397625970\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/10/1349878984751/Mitch-Tonks-recipe-calama-002.jpg\" alt=\"Mitch Tonks recipe calamari\" width=\"220\" height=\"132\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mitch Tonks recipe calamari. Photograph: Felicity Cloake</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Felicity Cloake</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The main difference between calamari recipes is, of course, the coating. They range from the blissfully simple (Hazan's plain, unseasoned flour) to the very slightly more complicated. <a href=\"http://www.nigella.com/recipes/view/quick-calamari-with-garlic-mayonnaise-41\">Nigella tosses hers</a> in a mixture of semolina and cornflour, Tonks uses equal parts of corn- and 00 flour, Aikens chooses self-raising flour and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/2004/jan/25/foodanddrink.shopping7\">Slater</a> wins the prize for the most complicated with his tempura-like batter using egg yolk, mineral water and flour. And that still only takes a second to mix together. It's dangerously easy, this calamari lark.</p> <p>After much thoughtful chewing, I decide I prefer a lighter coating: Slater's voluminous batter and Nigella's slightly gritty mixture are all too much of a distraction here. The self-raising doesn't seem to add much \u2013 Hazan's plain flour is just as good, but crispest of all is Tonks', with its fine-ground and cornflour combination. After a bit of experimentation, I decide that actually, the cornflour is what makes the difference here: the 00 is a red herring.</p> <h2>The flavourings</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397625971\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/10/1349879102876/Nigel-Slater-recipe-calam-002.jpg\" alt=\"Nigel Slater recipe calamari\" width=\"220\" height=\"132\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nigel Slater recipe calamari.

Garlic in the coating, as used by Aikens, simply burns, while Slater's smoked paprika imparts a richer colour but also, as one of my testers observes, an \"odd meaty taste\". Nigella uses American Old Bay seasoning, familiar to me from <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2012/sep/06/how-cook-perfect-southern-fried-chicken\">my forays into fried chicken</a>, suggesting salt and paprika as a substitute, but I think a little salt is all the squid needs. Sprinkling them with extra salt flakes fresh out of the pan, as Hazan suggests, adds extra crunch.</p> <h2>The cooking: squid's in</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397625972\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/10/1349878002816/Marcella-Hazan-recipe-cal-002.jpg\" alt=\"Marcella Hazan recipe calamari\" width=\"220\" height=\"132\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Marcella Hazan recipe calamari. Photograph: Felicity Cloake</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Felicity Cloake</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Everyone deep fries their squid in vegetable oil, apart from Hazan, who uses just an inch, turning the rings halfway through. I can't see the benefit of this: the fewer interactions I have with hot fat, the better, and as she uses a frying pan rather than a saucepan, there's not much less oil involved.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/05/dining/05mini.html\">Mark Bittman offers some excellent tips</a> for squid frying in the New York Times, suggesting patting the pieces dry before flouring them. Although this definitely makes the squid spit less, it's hard to get flour to stick if you're too diligent: OK if you like the very minimalist coating favoured by Bittman, not so great if you prefer a bit more crunch. Not overcrowding the pan, as I do on my first few attempts, is vital for crisp results: too many squid pieces in there, releasing water, and they'll steam rather than fry.</p> <h2>Perfect calamari</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397625973\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/10/1349879668245/Felicitys-perfect-calamar-008.jpg\" alt=\"Felicity's perfect calamari\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Felicity's perfect calamari.

Put the pieces and tentacles into a bowl and cover with milk, then cover the bowl and refrigerate for up to 8 hours (even half an hour is better than nothing).</p> <p>2. When you're ready to cook, mix together the flours and salt in a shallow container. Fill a large, heavy based pan a third full with oil and heat over a medium-high flame until a pinch of flour sizzles when it hits the oil.<br> <br>3. Drain the squid well, and perfunctorily pat dry, then drag through the flour and shake off the excess. Fry in batches for about a minute, until crisp, and slightly golden. Place on kitchen paper, sprinkle with salt, and then serve each batch as soon as they're ready, with lemon wedges or garlic mayonnaise.</p> <p>Do you love or loathe our cephalopod friends?

  "<p>Mitt Romney and his running mate Paul Ryan were scrambling on Wednesday to present a coherent position on abortion amid accusations from Democrats that the Republican presidential candidate had hidden his true beliefs in an attempt to appeal to moderate voters.</p> <p>In the wake of a Romney interview with the <a href=\"http://blogs.desmoinesregister.com/dmr/index.php/2012/10/09/romney-says-abortion-legislation-isnt-part-of-his-agenda\">Des Moines Register</a> newspaper in which he said his agenda included no legislation to restrict abortion, his campaign team launched a damage limitation exercise to assure conservative voters that he remained staunchly pro-life. </p> <p>Within hours of the comments being published on Tuesday, Romney's campaign insisted that he was against abortion, telling the conservative National Review Online that Romney \"would, of course, support legislation aimed at providing greater protections for life.</p> <p>\"Mitt Romney is proudly pro-life, and he will be a pro-life president,\" said his spokeswoman Andrea Saul in a statement.</p> <p>But on Wednesday, an intervention by Ryan during a campaign stop deepened the confusion. Asked by reporters about the differences between him and Romney on the issue, Ryan, who is against abortion in all cases, including rape, incest and where the mother's life is in danger, said: \"Our position is unified. Our position is consistent and hasn't changed.\"</p> <p>As the controversy escalated, Romney himself sought to draw a line under it. </p> <p>He told reporters in Ohio: \"I think I've said time and again that I'm a pro-life candidate and I'll be a pro-life president. The actions I'll take immediately is to remove funding for Planned Parenthood. It will not be part of my budget. And also I've indicated that I will reverse the Mexico City position of the president. I will reinstate the Mexico City policy which keeps us from using foreign aid for abortions overseas.\"</p> <p>Romney's anti-abortion views are less extreme than Ryan's. While he has stated that he supports the overturning of the Roe v Wade supreme court decision, he believes there should be exceptions to a ban on abortion. </p> <p>Ryan, by contrast, has sponsored a series of bills that would either restrict abortion or access to contraception, or both. The differing views of the two men over the issue was highlighted most recently in August when Ryan's views were tied to those of Todd Akin, the Republican Senate candidate in Missouri who was abandoned by the party after comments on \"legitimate rape\".</p> <p>Two months ago, when asked a similar question about the difference on abortion between him and Romney, Ryan acknowledged the difference between them when he told reporters he was \"proud of my pro-life record\" but said that Romney set the policy.</p> <p>A call to the Romney campaign from the Guardian to clarify the position \u2013 and what Ryan's \"unified\" comment meant \u2013 was not immediately returned.</p> <p>Romney's initial remarks to the Des Moines Register were pounced on by Barack Obama campaign officials, who accused him of \"cynically and dishonestly\" hiding his true anti-abortion position.</p> <p>Stephanie Cutter, Obama's deputy campaign press secretary, told reporters: \"We're not saying that he's changed his mind on these issues. We're saying that he is trying to cover up his beliefs.\"</p> <p>She added: \"Every step of the way he has been anti-choice, against Roe v Wade.\"</p> <p>Reaction among conservatives to Romney's remarks was also critical. A comment piece in the conservative newspaper The Weekly Standard on Wednesday titled \"Did Mitt Romney forget?\" suggested that he was \"mistaken\" and had simply not realised how many issues related to abortion funding he could influence.</p> <p>\"The issue here does not appear to be that Romney is backing off his stance on abortion \u2013 indeed, he says he will use an executive order to cut off funding to groups that perform abortion overseas,\" it read. \"But he is mistaken in thinking that there aren't issues related to abortion funding are handled through the legislative process at the federal level.\"</p> <p>Romney's past commitments have included ensuring US laws reflect \"values of preserving life\". He has previously promised to: support foetal pain legislation, which bans abortion after 20 weeks, on the much-debated basis that foetuses can feel pain at that stage; end public health funds for Planned Parenthood because the group provides abortions; and support a decades-old ban on federal funds for abortions.</p> <p>He supports the reversal of Roe v Wade, but believes in exceptions for victims of rape and incest, or when the mother's life is in danger.</p> <p>Romney, who had been pro-choice as governor of Massachusetts, repeatedly asserted his anti-abortion credentials as he battled to win the Republican nomination. During a televised debate in Charleston on 19 January before the South Carolina primary, for example, he said: \"You can count on me as president of the United States to pursue a policy that protects the life of the unborn, whether here in this country or overseas. And I'll reverse the policies of this president.\"</p> <p>In his acceptance speech to the Republican convention in Tampa in August, he promised that as president he would \"protect the sanctity of life\".</p> <p>Anti-abortion groups said on Wednesday they didn't see Romney's comments as evidence of a change of heart. Tony Perkins, president of the anti-abortion Family Research Council, told <a href=\"http://2012.talkingpointsmemo.com/2012/10/anti-abortion-activists-call-romneys-new-comments-a-gaffe-not-a-change-of-heart.php\">Talking Points Memo</a> the Romney campaign called him soon after the remarks were published by the Iowa newspaper and assured him it didn't represent a shift from his support for pro-life issues.</p> <p>Romney's comments came as he sought to maintain his recent appeal to female voters in the closing stages of the presidential race. A poll by Pew this week found Romney neck-and-neck among women with Barack Obama, who has held an enormous advantage with this demographic.</p>",
  "<p>Joe Hart has described John Terry as \"an inspiration\" and expressed regret at the Chelsea captain's decision to retire from international football, with the England goalkeeper urging the next generation of centre-halves to seize their opportunity and prosper at the highest level.</p> <p>Life after Terry begins for Roy Hodgson's side on Friday in front of a sell-out crowd at Wembley, albeit only against San Marino, the joint lowest-ranked side in world football, after <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2012/sep/23/john-terry-retires-international-football\" title=\"\">the 31-year-old quit on 78 caps last month</a> having grown infuriated at a Football Association charge for using abusive language with racial connotations. Terry, who had been cleared of a racially aggravated public order offence at Westminster magistrates court in July, described his position as \"untenable\" at the time but was subsequently found guilty by a three-man panel of racially abusing the Queens Park Rangers defender Anton Ferdinand.</p> <p>\"John is a great centre-half, a great servant to his country, an inspiration and a very passionate and proud Englishman,\" said Hart. \"It's a shame we've lost him as he's still got so much ability. It's a big blow, but it's John's decision. I don't know what's going on in John's life on or off the field. I don't know his body or his frame of mind. I only know that, when I'm here with England, training and eating chicken and pasta next to him, he's a really good guy, a good person and, football-wise, an inspiration.</p> <p>\"He was someone who, when I first came to the squad, treated me just the same as he does now. When I first came into the squad as a third-choice goalkeeper with no chance of playing, he treated me the same as he does now. I can't thank him enough for how helpful he's been with me in the England squad and he's someone I respect very, very much on and off the field. He was great to me and the other players.\"</p> <p>The fall-out from the incident at Loftus Road has seen Terry first stripped of the captaincy and then reluctantly retire, Fabio Capello resign, Rio Ferdinand fined for re-tweeting a message that described Ashley Cole as a \"choc ice\", and Cole also <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2012/oct/08/ashley-cole-fa-charge-tweet\" title=\"\">charged with misconduct for an outburst on Twitter</a>. The left-back is not expected to appeal against that sanction by Thursday's 4pm deadline, and is also braced to be fined two weeks' wages by Chelsea for breaching the club's code of conduct on social media.</p> <p>Terry, meanwhile, is adamant he has been wronged by <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2012/sep/27/john-terry-verdict-chelsea-guilty\" title=\"\">the independent panel's judgment</a>, which imposed a four-match ban and a \u00a3220,000 fine, but is still considering whether to launch an appeal against the regulatory commission's verdict \u2013 he has until 18 October to respond \u2013 even if he is well aware of the damage being inflicted upon Chelsea and the image of football by the furore.</p> <p>Roy Hodgson is expected to pair Joleon Lescott with Phil Jagielka in defence, with Kyle Walker to be handed a first competitive start at right-back and Leighton Baines likely to start at left-back. The England team's medical staff continue to assess Frank Lampard's fitness \u2013 the 34-year-old has been suffering discomfort behind his knee and could only play a small part in training at St George's Park on Wednesday \u2013 and will make a late decision on his availability to captain the team in the absence of the suspended Steven Gerrard.</p> <p>Should Frank Lampard miss out then Wayne Rooney would most likely wear the armband, with Hodgson giving thought to employing the Manchester United forward in an advanced midfield role behind two strikers \u2013 a position he filled for his club at Newcastle on Sunday \u2013 against San Marino given the amount of possession the hosts expect to enjoy. The England manager has even mooted the possibility of Michael Carrick playing some part of the game as a ball playing centre-back if necessary as the home side seek to bolster their goal difference.</p> <p>That would represent a temporary arrangement, with Hart now urging the four specialist centre-backs in this squad \u2013 their number supplemented by the uncapped Ryan Shawcross \u2013 to prove they can fill the void left by Terry. \"The future's solid, and there are places up for grabs,\" he said. \"Joleon and John seemed to have the shirt, then Jags came in last time [against Moldova and Ukraine] and Gary Cahill is a great talent at Chelsea and a Champions League winner now.</p> <p>\"Ryan's been so consistent for Stoke and it's highlighted, week in week out, as a defensive unit how strong they are. John Terry has held that position down for a long time now and maybe some people wouldn't have seen the light. But, while people aren't happy to see John retire, there's an opportunity there now.\"</p>",
  "<p>\u2022 To the titanic Intelligence Squared debate in central London, with its provocative motion for discussion: London should learn to love its bankers. Ken Livingstone, speaking against, is the star attraction \u2013 but there is also <a href=\"http://www.intelligencesquared.com/speakers/jennifer-moses/\" title=\"\">Jennifer Moses</a>, the former Goldman Sachs banker whose love for banking must owe something to her own career success. Her secretary took a million quid from her; reports suggest the loss was not immediately apparent. She was in good company, for in the audience we spied <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2010/may/18/rbs-boss-cameron-never-take-bank-job\" title=\"\">Johnny Cameron</a>, right-hand man to Fred the Shred at RBS and one of the characters some blame for the crisis that envelops us. He didn't speak. He didn't have to. His very presence spoke volumes. And perhaps some sense that the tide is turning. For prior to the discussion, 305 attendees voted to love the bankers. By the end of the war of words, that figure had risen to 338. Soon the bonuses will be back. Then Bob. Then Fred. Whose idea was it to put that ducking stool away?</p> <p>\u2022 It wasn't Ken Livingstone's. But perhaps he came across as conflicted. Every speaker in favour of the motion parroted something favourable he had said about bankers while London mayor. And who can forget the sight of him being chased down the stairs after a dinner at the Mansion House by a stocky figure in a chalk-white pinstripe. \"I disagree with most of what you say,\" gushed the man-fan, dreamy eyed. \"But I luuuuve, the way you say it.\"</p> <p>\u2022 Mystery still afflicts the relationship between columnist Peter Oborne and the Tory grandee Lord Fowler. The two appeared on the <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b01nd2k2/Daily_Politics_Conference_Special/\" title=\"\">Daily Politics this week</a> when there was nothing one might describe as mutual respect. Lord Fowler held forth on the welfare system. Oborne, live from the Tory conference in Birmingham, bided his time and then launched at Lord Fowler's own record. He was, Oborne said \"probably the most pusillanimous welfare secretary since world war two, and many of the problems the welfare state faces today are down to his total failure to grasp the issue\". Addressing Fowler directly, he said: \"You were absolutely useless.\" Asked to explain the attack, Lord Fowler told Andrew Neil, \"I think this is all personal,\" which is a puzzle so far as Oborne is concerned. \"To my recollection, I have never had any personal dealings with Lord Fowler,\" he told us. \"I was just pointing out that as welfare secretary he was famously inert. It was fair comment and legitimate comment. I'd like to know why he thinks it was personal.\" We would too, but Lord Fowler's office tell us that he is abroad and, no, they have no way of knowing when he will next be in contact. The cleft stick he left behind.</p> <p>\u2022 News of Lord (Conrad) Black, who with less than eight months left on his one-year Canadian temporary resident visa, has been lavishing praise on the country of his birth. The history is a rocky one. Before receiving the controversial temporary visa while still in a Florida prison, it was thought he might be banned from Canada as a non-Canadian convicted felon. He relinquished Canadian citizenship to become a British peer. But now, ensconced in his Toronto mansion, Black casts a jaundiced eye on Britain, writing in the National Post \"how comparatively well-governed and well-functioning Canada is\". Bemoaning the state of the UK today, he quotes a Manchester Evening News reader who, asked on his tax return if he had any dependents, replied: \"Yes: 2.1 million illegal immigrants, 1.1 million crack-heads, 4.4 million unemployable scroungers, 900,000 criminals, plus 650 idiots in parliament and the whole of the European Commission.\" Conrad is glad to be away from them all. Still, most seem pretty content to be away from him.</p> <p>\u2022 The leader has spoken and finally the Tories are getting their act together. Let's consider <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/oct/09/jon-cruddas-big-picture-critique\" title=\"\">that piece in yesterday's Guardian from Tory thinker Dominic Raab</a>, co-author of the future of Conservatism document Britannia Unchained.

  "<p>The longstanding commercial relationship between BT and Huawei is being investigated by parliament's intelligence and security committee, its chairman Sir Malcolm Rifkind has confirmed to the Guardian.</p> <p>In a move that could cause disruption to major broadband and mobile phone infrastructure projects in the UK should security fears be raised about Huawei's equipment, the committee is \"reviewing the whole presence of Huawei in regard to our critical national infrastructure and whether that should give rise for concern\".</p> <p>The committee has been taking evidence in private for some months from members of the security services, and is considering whether to make some of its findings and recommendations public. A report will be sent to David Cameron before Christmas.</p> <p>\"In the background are allegations that Huawei has links to the People's Liberation Army in China, and that any Chinese company is ultimately subject to the Chinese government,\" said Rifkind.</p> <p>Huawei is a supplier to BT, which gave the Chinese company its first big contract in western Europe in 2005, using its equipment to modernise its copper broadband service. Huawei is now a big supplier to BT's national rollout of fibre-optic broadband, one of the largest infrastructure projects under way in the UK. Its equipment has also been used to build the 4G network being launched at the end of this month by EE, the owner of Orange and T-Mobile, and other clients include TalkTalk, Vodafone and BSkyB.</p> <p>\"We are looking into the relationship that has developed between Huawei and British Telecom and the implications for the UK,\" said Rifkind. \"We wanted to look at the historical background to that contract, to what extent there were security concerns at the time, whether and to what extend the British government were involved in these decisions, and whether there have been any causes for concern that have arisen since Huawei became involved in our telecoms infrastructure.\"</p> <p>A spokesman for Huawei said of the intelligence and security committee's inquiry, for which the firm has not so far been asked to give evidence: \"We have been operating in the UK since 2001 under UK scrutiny and procedures. We have regular contact with the government and welcome all discussions and questions.\"</p> <p>Two years ago, the company established a centre in Banbury where its equipment for BT and other companies can be tested and monitored, in co-operation with security services staff. A BT spokesman said: \"Huawei is one of our major suppliers. This has in no way affected our ability to ensure the security of our networks.\"</p> <p>A negative report card from British politicians would be embarrassing for Cameron, who met Huawei's founder Ren in Downing Street only last month. It could also disrupt the roll out of fibre and 4G mobile internet in the UK.</p> <p>\"If the UK takes the same stance as the US, and I would be surprised if they did, there will be all kinds of consequences,\" said Bengt Nordstr\u00f6m, chief executive of telecoms consultancy Northstream. \"It would mean that you need to agree on terms for de-commissioning, find a replacement vendor, tear out the old equipment, install the new. It's a complicated costly exercise that will delay whatever plans they have. There is an impact for the major infrastructure projects in the UK.\"</p> <p>The Shenzhen-based company has been blacklisted in Australia, where it was barred from supplying the country's new national fibre network, and the US House of Representatives' intelligence select committee this week called for Huawei and its Chinese rival ZTE to be excluded from doing business in the US on the grounds that their equipment could be used by the state or other interests in China for cyber-espionage.</p> <p>The Canadian government is indicating that it too might exclude the company from involvement in government communications projects because of potential security risks. In Brussels, the European trade commissioner, Karel De Gucht, was gathering evidence for an inquiry into both companies on the grounds that state support may allow them to sell equipment at a loss, but that was put on ice after European competitors declined to file formal complaints. A source has told the Guardian this was for fear of reprisals from China.</p> <p>At the centre of the concerns is that Huawei's networks are not secure and could be open to espionage. The US has voiced concerns that China could use equipment made by the company \u2013 whose founder, Ren, was once a technician in the People's Liberation Army \u2013 to spy on communications and threaten vital systems through computerised links.</p> <p>The chairman of the US House of Representatives' intelligence committee, Mike Rogers, himself a former FBI agent, said: \"My argument is that if this helps the Chinese government get out of the business of cyber-espionage, then that is great.\"</p> <p>Huawei denies all links with spying and cybercrime, and calls the allegations \"a monstrous, market-distorting, trade-distorting policy precedent that could be used in other markets against American companies\".</p> <p>While its US presence is limited, Huawei has used the UK as a launchpad for rapid expansion in Europe, where its rise has contributed to the fall of a number of western rivals.</p> <p>One of the first casualties was the venerable British firm Marconi, which lost its largest client when BT chose Huawei - and a handful of other suppliers - for its 21st century network copper broadband upgrade. Within a year, the telecoms and defence firm, once a bellwether of the UK economy, had been broken up and sold.</p> <p>A similar fate has befallen American vendors Nortel and Motorola, and a once bustling sector is braced for further retrenchment, with both France's Alcatel-Lucent and Finland's Nokia Siemens Networks having experienced financial turbulence.</p> <p>Unlike the state controlled oil, energy and banking groups that dominate the list of China's largest companies, Huawei is one of a select few, like the internet group Alibaba, to have a brand that is familiar to Western consumers.</p> <p>Stan Abrams, a Beijing-based corporate lawyer, lecturer and commentator, says \"reciprocity\" has been a feature of Chinese trade policy, and there could be repercussions for Western companies hoping to do business in China after Huawei's public humiliation at the hands of the US legislature.<br></p>",
  "<p>Chris Grayling as justice secretary bothers me far less than he would in almost any other department. The legal profession has many years of experience in foiling, scotching, contradicting and plain ignoring the conference soundbites of politicians. I'll worry about Grayling's tough-guy pledges when I see the lord chief justice&#xa0;with his (metaphorical) glasses steamed up, and not before.</p> <p>However, just because I'm not worried doesn't mean I'm not interested, particularly in this week's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/oct/09/tories-go-back-basics-burglars\" title=\"\">pledge to change the law to protect homeowners who overreact to an intruder</a>.</p> <p>This is number three in the chart of all-time conference classics. At two, there's the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/06/jeremy-hunt-12-week-abortion-limit\" title=\"\">abortion time-limit conversation</a>, started by people with no intention of changing the law, but who just want to self-identify as the kind of politicians who seek a controlling interest in a stranger's uterus. At number one, \"get tough on immigrants, especially the ones with cats\", Theresa May's internet-generated content that she could have got from a website called <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/sep/19/nigel-farage-tory-donors-ukip\" title=\"\">www.theNigelFarage-izer.com</a>. It's a bid to steal votes from Ukip, which in itself is classic tactics-over-strategy: people crunching numbers worry about the marginal effect of not being quite rightwing enough in closely contested constituencies with a potentially split vote. Nobody (apparently) is worrying about the more damaging effect of not being quite rational enough to appeal to the centre ground of any constituency. Anybody who wants to live out their lives without ever seeing another Conservative government will find this quite cheering.</p> <p>The intruder debate \u2013 because it is so niche, so far to the fringes of life's tapestry, so completely unrelated to meaningful policymaking \u2013 I think of as&#xa0;almost poetic, the conference season's dream sequence. Parliamentary briefings on self-defence in your own home always refer to their figures as an <a href=\"http://www.parliament.uk/documents/commons/lib/research/key_issues/Key%20Issues%20Use%20of%20force%20against%20intruders.pdf\" title=\"\">\"informal trawl\" by the crown prosecution service</a>. That's code for \"we'd love to look more closely, but frankly there are so few of them that we cannot be arsed\". Between 1990 and 2005, there were only <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-19886504\" title=\"\">seven prosecutions that resulted from a domestic burglary</a>; less than one every two years. No wonder the Daily Mail gets so excited \u2013 to them, that's like seeing a comet.</p> <p>To people who, considering its rarity, take little interest in self-defence as a political or social problem, it may come as a surprise to learn how much damage you are already allowed to inflict on an intruder. In 2009 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2010/apr/19/burglary-murder-charge-dropped\" title=\"\">Omari Roberts stabbed two teenaged intruders</a>, one fatally, and the case against him was dropped; in September a <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-leicestershire-19463707\" title=\"\">couple shot two burglars and weren't charged</a>. The law still takes a dim view of premeditated self-defence \u2013 so, for instance, if you lie in wait for a burglar, catch him, tie him up, throw him in a pit and set fire to him, you will be prosecuted. It's hard to fathom how you could, as suggested by Tory MP Priti Patel, \"<a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/9530564/Conservative-MPs-demand-greater-rights-for-householders-against-burglars.html\" title=\"\">stop treating criminals like victims and victims like criminals</a>\" in a situation like that, without having an open-door policy on sociopaths.</p> <p>If you think that sounds like an outlier, every case is an outlier. There is no normal in a crime that scarcely ever happens. At least with abortion and immigration, the figures are significant; it seems curious that a situation which so few people have ever encountered should ascend to the status of the \"hot-button issue\".</p> <p>The last party conference to be dominated by this was Labour's in 2007, when Jack Straw promised to tighten the law as a \"matter of urgency\", despite the fact that it wasn't urgent, and when it came to it (the <a href=\"http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2008/4/contents\" title=\"\">Criminal Justice and Immigration Act 2008</a>), he merely codified it according to existing precedent, of which there was hardly any. The context for that was a Brownite regime that was petrified of tabloid sensibilities and had no confidence in its own ability to argue against them, as well as being atrophied by indecision over how best to play their honeymoon period. They were casting around to be as politically inclusive as reason would allow.</p> <p>But even if Straw had changed the law to allow self-defence right up to the point where it's \"grossly disproportionate\", I doubt it would have made any practical difference. Most people don't have a gun; most people haven't been in a fight since they were at primary school. When the lord chief justice, Lord Judge, <a href=\"http://www.judiciary.gov.uk/Resources/JCO/Documents/News%20Release/lcj-press-conference-270912.pdf\" title=\"\">gave his opinion last month that the law was fine</a> as it stood, he remarked: \"I suspect if any of you have come home to find a burglar in your home, or have been in bed at night \u2013 or indeed having an afternoon snooze and found a burglar in your home \u2013 you are not calmly detached.\" Realistically, detachment aside, how fighting fit are you going to emerge from that snooze? What are the chances that your criminal opponent will be better at combat than you are?</p> <p>This is not a practical suggestion. It is no blueprint for the protection of private property, nor even a metaphorical iteration of the power balance between victim and criminal. It's a statement of individual power against the flim-flam of civilisation. \"We understand that society is all very well, but not if it comes at the price of being allowed to engage in hand-to-hand combat. We understand your God-given right to be superman, even if only in theory. We want to be superman too.\" The intruder scenario is conjured as individualistic wish-fulfilment by politicians with no confidence in the popularity and possibilities of government. It sounds bold, but it is actually insecure.</p> <p><em>Twitter: </em><a href=\"https://de.twitter.com/zoesqwilliams\" title=\"\"><em>@zoesqwilliams</em></a></p>",
  "<h2><strong>Wales 0 Scotland 2 12 Oct 1977</strong></h2> <p>Don Masson's controversial penalty and Kenny Dalglish's late second sent Scotland on their way to the 1978 World Cup in perhaps the most notorious meeting between the two sides. The Welsh FA moved the tie to Anfield in favour of higher gate receipts from the Tartan Army and the referee surprisingly awarded the visitors a spot-kick even though their striker Joe Jordan handled the ball. Masson beat Dai Davies from 12 yards to send Ally MacLeod's side to the finals in Argentina, but they went out in the group stage in spite of Archie Gemmill's memorable third goal against Holland</p> <h2><strong>Wales 1 Scotland 1 10 Sep 1985</strong></h2> <p>Rangers winger Davie Cooper came off the bench at Ninian Park to score a late penalty and send Scotland to Mexico \u2013 their fourth successive World Cup \u2013 after Mark Hughes had given the hosts the lead. But the Scots' joy soon turned to despair, as manager Jock Stein suffered a heart attack on the touchline and was pronounced dead in the changing rooms shortly after</p> <h2><strong>Wales 4 Scotland 0 18 Feb 2004</strong></h2> <p>Cardiff City striker Robert Earnshaw scored an impressive hat-trick as Hughes' side outplayed Scotland at the Millennium Stadium to pile pressure on Berti Vogts and inflict the Scots' heaviest defeat in 103 meetings between the two sides. The pacy striker gave the hosts the lead inside a minute, before bundling home Ryan Giggs' cross for his second, then slotting past a despairing Rab Douglas to register the first Wales treble since Ian Rush against the Faroe Islands in 1992. The German was sacked later that year</p> <h2><strong>Wales 3 Scotland 0 14&#xa0;Nov 2009</strong></h2> <p>Scotland's 3-0 defeat at the hands of John Toshack's young Welsh side was the final straw for the Scottish FA, who sacked George Burley just days after the embarrassing defeat at Cardiff City's new stadium. Arsenal youngster Aaron Ramsey announced himself on the international scene with a dominant display, setting up two goals before scoring one himself, as Burley's disappointing 22-month reign was brought to an end <strong> </strong></p>",
  "<p>As politicians line up to accuse Rwanda of supporting the latest armed rebellion in the east of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), the militia at the centre of the storm continues to strengthen and expand its nascent political wing.</p> <p>In Rutshuru, the unofficial capital of the territory now controlled by Congolese insurrectionists M23, civilians and armed rebels mix uneasily in the streets while spokesmen answer journalists' queries about the new movement.</p> <p>The first question is invariably the same: is Rwanda supporting the rebellion?</p> <p>\"We have never received a single gun or bullet from Rwanda,\" said the military spokesman Vianney Kazarama, who would not be drawn on any questions regarding Congo's diminutive but powerful neighbour. Rwandan officials also flatly deny the accusations, which were made in a June report by the United Nations' group of experts on the Congo.</p> <p>Some in political circles are more eager to speak, however, vigorously defending Rwanda against charges of supplying M23 with recruits, weapons and ammunition. \"Why does any malaise in Congo always have to involve Rwanda?\" said Ali Musagara, head of youth mobilisation for M23. \"We are not Rwandans. The fact that nothing in DRC works: is that the fault of Rwanda? We have no army, corruption is endemic, there is bad governance, fraudulent elections; all that, too, is the fault of Rwanda? I don't think so. These are all Congolese problems and they must be resolved by the Congolese.\"</p> <p>Benjamin Mbonimpa, head of refugee repatriation, blames the problems on a lack of effective leadership from Congo's president, Joseph Kabila. In contrast, he praises Rwanda's president, Paul Kagame, for guiding the country's recovery from the devastating genocide of 1994.</p> <p>\"Paul Kagame's leadership is very organised, focused and effective,\" said Mbonimpa. \"If the Congo had a charismatic leader like Kagame, I think we would be fortunate. But the Congolese people feel a powerful hatred for Kagame; they have a terrible reaction when they hear his name. We can't propose him to the Congolese population as a good example of the leadership we need.\"</p> <p>The rebels' evident respect for Kagame worries those who see M23 as a proxy force for Rwandan ambitions in eastern Congo. The Congolese who now live under M23 rule are certainly of this view, referring to the rebels as \"foreigners\".</p> <p>Musagara described as \"wise\" Kagame's recent refusal to join other national leaders in publicly condemning the M23 rebels, who are led by Bosco Ntaganda, indicted by the international criminal court.</p> <p>Musagara also praised Kagame and his Ugandan counterpart, Yoweri Museveni, for pursuing a negotiated solution to the crisis. \"They are two wise presidents,\" he said. \"[Rwanda and Uganda] are our neighbours; they must encourage the Congolese government to talk to us because when there is unrest in your neighbour, your country is not stable either.\"</p> <p>Congo's government has made its first tentative moves towards negotiation, engaging indirectly with the M23 delegation that has been in the Ugandan capital, Kampala, awaiting talks for several weeks. \"We are negotiating via the Ugandan government,\" said M23's political leader, Bishop Jean-Marie Runiga, speaking from the city. \"We hope to have face-to-face talks soon. It's very frustrating. We have been waiting in Kampala for a long time.\"</p> <p>M23's leadership is made up of former fighters with the Rwanda-backed CNDP (National Congress for the Defence of the People) rebellion in Congo. A 2009 peace deal integrated them into the army and granted them a parallel chain of command and a lucrative smuggling racket into Rwanda. It was the threat to smash those networks that prompted these soldiers to revolt in April and May. They say they want the full implementation of the 2009 peace deal and will fight until they get what they want.</p> <p>In towns controlled by M23, many are sceptical about whether the Kampala talks will lead anywhere. When asked about a solution to the crisis, Musagara said Congo's president would decide how the rebellion ended. \"We're ready for anything,\" he said. \"If [Kabila] wants negotiations, we are ready for that; we are also ready if he wants war.\"</p>",
  "<p>The BBC's news coverage of religion, immigration and Europe is to be scrutinised in an independent review following accusations of liberal bias.</p> <p>Lord Patten, the BBC Trust chairman, said the review was an acknowledgment of \"real and interesting\" concerns from some quarters about the impartiality of the BBC's news coverage.</p> <p>The corporation has long faced accusations of liberal and leftwing bias from politicians and other sections of the media.</p> <p>The BBC's coverage of controversial topics including immigration, religion and the European Union will come under the spotlight in the review, which is expected to be published in early 2013. It may also include coverage of Islamophobia.</p> <p>It is the fifth impartiality review by the BBC Trust, the corporation's governing body, and follows an internal 2007 report that described a \"largely unconscious self-censorship\" that led to certain opinions being routinely under-represented.</p> <p>Patten said the review would focus on immigration, religion and Europe because those are the topics that provoke most concern from the BBC's critics. He told a Broadcasting Press Guild lunch on Wednesday: \"The subjects we thought we would cover, because they are subjects we have had criticism from time to time about breadth of voice issues, are Europe, immigration and religion.</p> <p>\"It's an acceptance that these are areas where people are particularly concerned that we should get it right. We've been criticised in those areas and we think it's very important to listen to that criticism, not necessarily because it's right but because it reflects real and interesting concerns.\"</p> <p>The independent report will compare the way the BBC deals with immigration and religion now with coverage in 2007, when <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2007/jun/19/broadcasting.bbc\" title=\"\">the BBC Trust published a 12-point plan in an attempt to silence its critics on impartiality</a>.</p> <p>The review will examine whether the BBC has improved the impartiality of its news coverage since that report, called From Seesaw to Wagon Wheel. The 2007 report found no evidence of a conscious bias at the corporation, but said senior BBC figures acknowledged a tendency to \"groupthink\" which often led to an unconscious liberal slant on big issues.</p> <p>Rightwing sections of the media routinely lambast the corporation over its alleged liberal bias. A <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-2212544/A-day-shame-Civil-Service.html\" title=\"\">Daily Mail leader column</a> last week accused the BBC of double standards, claiming it \"consistently attacks Christianity (though never Islam)\" and suggested the corporation would have pursued Jimmy Savile \"remorselessly\" if he was a Catholic priest and not a former BBC presenter.</p> <p>Presenter Andrew Marr admitted in 2003 that the BBC held liberal preoccupations, but claimed the rest of the media was similarly guilty of bias. Mark Thompson, who stepped down as BBC director general in August, told the New Statesman in 2010 that the BBC had a \"massive bias to the left\" when he joined 30 years ago.</p> <p>The inquiry will be led by Stuart Prebble, the former ITV chief executive and World in Action editor. He will examine whether the BBC gives due weight to a range of opinions on sensitive topics and whether editorial decisions to omit certain perspectives have been carefully reached.</p> <p>Prebble will investigate whether the opinions of viewers and listeners who participate through phone-ins are given appropriate significance. The review will look at whether the BBC has ensured that those who hold minority views are aware they can take part in on-air debates.</p> <p>David Liddiment, the lead BBC trustee for the review, said the BBC's reputation and commitment to impartiality was in its DNA. He added: \"This review will help to ensure it continues to meet audience expectations in this area, looking at how the BBC builds an understanding of breadth of opinion into its approach to its journalism. Part of the review will look at coverage of immigration, religion and the EU \u2013 not because we are anticipating a problem there, but because they are subjects on which there are obviously a range of opinions and which will make a valuable contribution to the review.\"</p> <p>The BBC Trust has previously examined the impartiality of the corporation's coverage of business, the UK nations, science and the Arab spring.</p> <p>In 2009, the BBC came under fire for two reports by the Middle East editor Jeremy Bowen on the Arab-Israeli conflict. The corporation's editorial standards committee found that Bowen had breached guidelines on impartiality when he referred to \"Zionism's innate instinct to push out the frontier\". A report published by the BBC Trust earlier this year described the broadcaster's coverage of the Arab spring as \"generally impartial\".</p>",
  "<p>David Cameron laid out on Wednesday the Conservative party's election battleground, paring it down to welfare, education and an attack on profligate Labour borrowing, while also addressing the elitism in his own personal story by saying his mission was to spread, rather than hoard, privilege .</p> <p>Closing his party conference with a counter-attacking speech, designed to repel Labour's ideological One Nation land grab, Cameron insisted a modern, compassionate Conservative party was leading the fight against poverty in Britain. It was not the party of the better off, but the \"want to be better off\", he said.</p> <p>He said it had fallen to him to lead the mission to create an \"aspiration nation\", in which dependency on welfare was ended and the toxic culture of low expectation in schools was thrown aside.</p> <p>He said Labour was a party of one notion \u2013 more borrowing \u2013 and simply did not grasp the scale of the global forces threatening the UK from China to Nigeria.</p> <p>The decision to focus on welfare reform and low aspiration in education, as well as attack Labour on spending, was a conscious move to focus on the areas where the coalition parties believe most has been achieved. Cameron claimed: \"These are not just battle lines for Britain's future, but also battlelines for the next election\".</p> <p>Implictly acknowledging he may have allowed Labour to fill some ideological space, he said he may have erred in failing to explain himself and his modernising mission enough. He said: \"The party has a heart but we don't like wearing it on our sleeve. Conservatives think 'let's just get on with the job and help people and not bang on about it'. It's not our style.</p> <p>\"But there is a problem with that. It leaves a space for others to twist our ideas and distort who we are \u2013 the cartoon Conservatives who don't care.</p> <p>\"The reason we want to reform schools, to cut welfare dependency, to reduce government spending is not because we are the same old Tories that want to help the rich. It's because we are the Tories whose ideas help everyone \u2013 the poorest the most\".</p> <p>He said welfare reform was not working, arguing that the only route out of poverty was work, a message his pollsters insist resonates in Labour areas.</p> <p>He also tried to appropriate Labour's academies programme, claiming it was \"the old educational establishment \u2013 the leftwing local authorities, the leaders of the teachers unions, the Labour party theorists\" who stood in the way of their expansion.</p> <p>In a bid to counter the claim that he stands for elitism in education, he said he was on the side of parents demanding the discipline and rigour displayed by the academies. He said: \"Isn't the great disadvantage of all being written off by those so in hock to a culture of low expectations that they have forgotten what it is like to be ambitious, to want to transcend your background to overcome circumstance and succeed on your own terms?</p> <p>\"Its the toxic culture of low expectations \u2013 the lack of ambition for every child \u2013 which has held this country back\".</p> <p>He tried to address criticism about his Etonian schooling: \"To all those people who say 'he wants children to have the kind of education he had at his posh school', I say 'yes I went to a great school and I want every child to have a great education. I'm not here to defend privilege. I'm here to spread it'.\"</p> <p>In a speech that said next to nothing on policing, immigration, civil liberties or the European Union, issues that had dominated many cabinet members' speeches, Cameron defended the NHS, his overseas aid programmes and commitment to a socially liberal society, the classic symbols of Cameron's modernising project.</p> <p>In the most difficult passage, he addressed the state of the economy in the wake of the latest IMF report which again downgraded UK growth.</p> <p>He said: \"I know you are asking whether the plan is working and here is the truth: the damage was worse than we thought and it's taking longer than we hoped.\"</p> <p>He blamed the slowing of the world economy, especially in the EU, over the past two years, but told delegates: \"Here is the crucial thing you need to know: yes, it's worse than we thought; yes, it's taking longer, but we are making progress.</p> <p>He said \"it was a time of reckoning\", when the country would \"either sink or swim, do or decline\". Faced by global forces such as China, he said he was determined not to let his country slide, but instead to rise.</p> <p>In a typically optimistic passage, he argued: \"Aspiration is the engine of progress. Countries rise when they allow their people to rise . That is why the mission of this government is to build an aspiration nation to unleash and unlock all the promise in all our people.\"</p> <p>He gingerly suggested the economy was on the mend, citing the creation of 1m new jobs in the private sector, saying this was in net terms more than Labour managed in 10 years. In his only specific growth measure, he said Britain's planning laws would have to be scrapped so more housing could be built, vowing to scrap \"the suffocating bureaucracy\" that he said was holding economic growth back.</p> <p>He said: \"There are too many 'yes but no' people. The ones who say: 'Yes, our business needs to expand, but no, we cannot reform planning'.\"</p> <p>\"If we are going to be a winner in this global race, we've got to beat off this suffocating bureaucracy once and for all.\"</p> <p>He attacked the so-called Nimbys. It had been \"OK for his generation that had got on the housing ladder\", he said, but the average age that people bought their first home today without any help from their parents was 33.\"We are the party of home ownership. We cannot let this carry on. We have to accept we need to build more houses in Britain,\" he said.</p> <p>\"There are people who work hard year after year but are still living at home. They sit in their childhood bedroom looking out of the window, dreaming of a place of their own.\"</p> <p>He launched a number of attacks on Labour, but was silent on his Liberal Democrat coalition partners. He criticised Labour leader Ed Miliband by saying: \"While the intellectuals of other parties sneer at people who want to get on in life, we here salute you. They call us the party of the better off. No, we are the party of the want to be better off, those who strive to make a better life for themselves and their families \u2013 and we should never be ashamed of saying so.\"</p> <p>He promised: \"Those with the broadest shoulders would bear the greatest burden. With us, the rich will pay a greater share of tax in every year of this parliament than in any one of the 13 years under Labour.\"</p> <p>Previewing the attack he will mount at the next election, he said he did not think Labour had learned a single thing. \"When they were in office, their answer was always borrow more money. Now they are out of office, it's borrow more money. Whatever the day, whatever the question, whatever the weather it is, borrow more money.\"</p>",

Apparently, Trust were \"born out of desperation in the brutal Canadian winter of 2009\" when the pair \"began writing songs about nostalgia, lust, and erotomania\". We're not sure whether Postepski left owing to issues arising from the lust and erotomania part or because she felt nostalgic herself and missed doing her thing as Austra. Either way, Trust is just Alfons now \u2013 he's the one in charge of the synth arpeggios, programmed throbs, and a voice that vacillates between a low post-Iggy tone with tinges of goth and something a little more wheedling and whiny, like Kenneth Williams moaning or <a href=\"http://profile.ak.fbcdn.net/hprofile-ak-ash3/41764_1675520100_1783_n.jpg\" title=\"\">Albert Steptoe leering</a>.

Click here to listen</a></p> <p>What Trust have done, principally, is put out an album called TRST that's very much in hock not only to synthpop but also (if you want to believe it's not entirely mired in early-80s electronica) to slow techno. Some have referenced Crystal Castles in reviews, others Fever Ray and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2008/oct/01/popandrock.electronicmusic\" title=\"\">Delphic</a>. But really, the tracks on TRST sound mostly like lost classics from a nightclub playlist that might have featured 12-inch singles such as <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnTiNH5Oii8\" title=\"\">Memorabilia</a>, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XSn2K3eciSc\" title=\"\">Hard Times</a>, I Just Can't Get Enough, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LVQnFzZUITM\" title=\"\">Situation</a>, Visage, Everything's Gone Green, Der Mussolini and Chant No 1.</p> <p>This was a decade of dance, of decadence, when Euro hauteur became infused with earthly pop concerns and electronic music used the cold, Teutonic milieu to express the sort of feelings normally the preserve of rock or singer-songwriter acoustica: love and sex, deceit and longing, with an accent on sin, retribution and the dark side of desire. Alfons describes his music as \"emotional dance\" and admits to being a fan of \"heartbreaking music like Nick Drake and Brian Eno, people who have written the most unbelievably gorgeous music I've ever heard\". His lyrics are, he says, \"more about sexual repression and gazing and being not so much 'in it'. I don't think they're intentionally sexual, or overtly sexual.\" He's obviously forgetting that titles on TRST include Gloryhole, Candy Walls and This Ready Flesh.</p> <p>We've only been streaming it and don't have a finished copy, but we're hoping Trust's debut album opens with <a href=\"http://soundcloud.com/artsandcraftsmx/trust-sulk\" title=\"\">Sulk</a>. That's <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2007/apr/27/popandrock.alexispetridis\" title=\"\">a very 1982 synthpop song title</a> right there, with the requisite sense of emotional abandon amid the early-Mode pulsebeats. It is scented with eau d'goth. <a href=\"http://soundcloud.com/sacredbones/trust-candy-walls\" title=\"\">Candy Walls</a>, too, is heavy on atmospherics and metaphorical dry ice, positing Alfons, the lugubrious and lonely Canuck, as a digital <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/leonard-cohen\" title=\"\">Leonard Cohen</a>.

  "<p>Parts of the evidence against the terrorist suspect Abu Qatada are \"a bit thin\", according to the judge considering his deportation to face trial in Jordan.</p> <p>Mr Justice Mitting also questioned how the 51-year-old radical cleric could be fairly convicted if all the alleged co-conspirators in a Jordanian bomb plot had since been acquitted \u2013 which they have.</p> <p>The judge's comments were made at the opening of an eight-day appeal against extradition by Abu Qatada, also known as Omar Othman, in the special immigration appeals commission (Siac) in central London.</p> <p>The government is determined to send him to Jordan, where he was convicted in his absence of involvement in two terrorist conspiracies dating back to 1999 and 2000. He would face a retrial .</p> <p>The extradition case against Abu Qatada has been running since 2002 when he was first arrested in Britain. Since then he has either been in prison or under severely restrictive bail conditions which, at one stage, included a 22-hour curfew. At an earlier hearing it was described as \"the longest period of administrative detention as far as we know in modern English history\".</p> <p>As the hearing began, Mitting, the president of Siac, observed: \"The evidence [in one of the plots] seems a bit thin.\" He also referred to the difficulty of using evidence from alleged co-conspirators who had subsequently had their convictions quashed. In January, the European court of human rights in Strasbourg ruled that evidence of his involvement was obtained by torturing one of his co-defendants and there was a high probability it would be used at a retrial, where it would be \"of considerable, perhaps decisive importance\".</p> <p>The quality of the evidence will not, however, be a determining factor in Siac's decision about whether the Jordanian-born cleric should be removed from the United Kingdom. The Home Office is trying to persuade the commission that Abu Qatada will receive a fair trial if returned to Jordan following reassurances that no evidence obtained through torture will be used against him.</p> <p>Following several ministerial visits to the Jordanian capital, Amman, this summer, the Home Office believes it has now been provided with sufficiently robust reassurances that no evidence obtained through torture will be used against Abu Qatada and that he will receive a fair trial.</p> <p>Abu Qatada's appeal is chiefly on the grounds that the evidence extracted under torture would nonetheless be used against him in Jordan's state security court and that it was not an impartial system of justice.</p> <p>Danny Friedman, representing Abu Qatada, told the hearing: \"There are some serious issues with the allegations made against Mr Othman.\"</p> <p>Friedman denied that the aim of the appeal was simply delay. \"We are not saying two more appeals and 10 more years [of legal postponements],\" he added.</p> <p>Outline arguments presented to the hearing by Robin Tam QC, for the Home Office, state that Abu Qatada's deportation to Jordan \"forthwith\" would \"be compatible with the government's obligations under the [human rights] convention\".</p> <p>Statements previously obtained from his co-conspirators, supposedly under torture, will not be relied on in the retrial, Tam said. \"Given that [the pardoned co-conspirators] al-Hamasher and Abu Hawsher are no longer defendants before the court, [Abu Qatada] must be given the right to examine them.</p> <p>\"Accordingly, if the [Jordanian] prosecutor wishes to rely on the evidence of these former co-defendants, he must call [them] as witnesses to testify under oath in the retrial.\" In court, he said, they would not be under duress.</p> <p>Tam also raised doubts about whether one of the witnesses had actually been tortured. \"No actual allegations of torture in respect of Abu Hawsher were advanced by [his lawyer],\" he said.</p> <p>The fact that three civilian judges will sit on the court panel, without any military officers, removes the \"objectionable features\" of a military court previously identified by Siac, Tam argued.</p> <p>Suggestions that Abu Qatada might, if acquitted, be taken \"into administrative detention under the 1954 Law on Crime Prevention\" were dismissed as \"scraping the barrel\" to find excuses to avoid deportation.</p> <p>Sections of the Siac hearings will be held in secret \u2013 known as \"closed material procedures\" \u2013 where only special advocates, who have been given security clearance, and the judges can see sensitive, intelligence evidence.</p> <p>Some of the sessions are therefore referred to as being in \"open\" and other parts in \"closed\" session. At one stage lawyers referred to \"open closing submissions\" and \"closed closing submissions\" to distinguish between different sections of the hearing. The media and most of the lawyers were sent out of court for a brief period while the special advocates discussed secret evidence.</p> <p>The Home Office says videos of Abu Qatada's sermons influenced Muhammad Atta, the ringleader of the September 11 attacks on the United States. Abu Qatada has been described by a judge as Osama bin Laden's right-hand man in Europe.</p> <p>Anthony Layden, the former British ambassador to Libya who specialises in negotiating diplomatic assurances, will give evidence on Thursday. He will be followed by a Jordanian lawyer, Thaer Najdawi, who advises the British embassy in Amman.</p>",
  "<p>My oldest son is getting to the age where he is beginning to read. He is also learning that it can be a form of entertainment and has taken to reading to his younger brother each night. They both really enjoy the Dr. Seuss books, such as The Cat in the Hat, Yurtle the Turtle, and Green Eggs and Ham. But his absolute favorite at the moment is There's a Wocket in my Pocket. If you are unfamiliar with the book, here's how it starts off:</p> <p>Did you<br>ever have the feeling<br>there's a<br>WASKET<br>in your<br>BASKET?<br>\u2026Or a WOSET in your CLOSET?</p> <p>Sometimes<br>I feel quite CERTAIN<br>there's a JERTAIN<br>in the CURTAIN<br>That's the<br>kind of house<br>I live in.</p> <p>It is fun to watch them laugh at the silly words and imagine the strange world the protagonist of the book lives in. Since I've heard the book so many times, I have begun to take creative liberty in its interpretation and relate it back to enterprise mobility.</p> <p>I will often get asked how I can fit the Galaxy Note, aka the Phablet, in my pocket. Its generous 5.3-inch screen makes for a big phone. Since I really don't like much of anything in my pockets (one house key, one office key, my license, and a debit card is all I can stand) the answer is easy\u2014I don't need to make it fit. But most people do put their phone in their pocket. And the device in your pocket is an endpoint to data in your organization. It is both a risk and an opportunity.</p> <p>So the question is, do you know what is in your house? In the story, the main character has all sorts of imagined characters in his house. He is going around naming them off. But he's not quite sure what all of them are or if they even exist. This is true for many organizations and their data. They may feel quite certain they have assets to protect and use, but they have never really classified all of it. From a security perspective, there has been too much reliance on the idea that \"network\" is confined to the within the office walls; it's security by obscurity. However, mobility makes those walls disappear into thin air. From a use perspective, organizations are not bringing together all the data sets they could. Mobility allows them to deliver that insight anywhere. When it comes to data, you need to know what's in your house.</p> <p>Ask yourself this question: If you needed to take action on your data, would you even know what you have? Do you have your data cataloged? When was the last time you did an inventory? Do you do it on a regular basis? Beyond just knowing what data you have, has it been classified? Do you have a data taxonomy for your organization? Not all data is created equal. Without the ability to classify your data assets, you are left in an all or nothing position. Data identification becomes nearly impossible.</p> <p>Beyond cataloging and classifying, how fresh and relevant is your data? You should put a content management strategy in place. Data should have a life cycle and should be dispositioned correctly when the scheduled time comes. Should it be deleted, archived, or aggregated? Managing data is not only the future of security for organizations but also key to business success. Its role will only grow as computing and predictive capabilities mature. The ability to keep secure what needs to be secure and combine what needs to be combined with other data sets will mean the difference between a competitive advantage and decline.</p> <p>In the enterprise, device management is not enough. App management alone will not be enough either. As the world of mobility moves towards a seamless integrated ecosystem that eschews the traditional notions of the network, the ability to manage, track, and combine your data is not only an issue of security, but one of organizational health as well. Is your organization ready for that kind of world? What kind of house does your organization live in? Are you able to actually name all your data or do you only have an idea of what you imagine to be there? What will you do with the Data Socket in your Pocket?</p> <p><strong><em>Benjamin Robbins is a principal at Palador \u2013 he blogs regularly at remotelymobileblog.com and can be followed on Twitter @PaladorBenjamin</em></strong></p> <p><strong><em>This content is brought to you by Guardian Professional.

  "<p>The BBC's coverage of religion, immigration and Europe is to be scrutinised in an independent review led by former ITV chief executive Stuart Prebble.</p> <p>Lord Patten, the BBC Trust chairman, said on Wednesday that the review \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/aug/02/stuart-prebble-lead-bbc-impartiality-review\" title=\"\">first announced in August</a> \u2013 was prompted by complaints that the corporation's coverage of world and religious events is not always impartial.</p> <p>\"It's an acceptance that these are areas where people are particularly concerned that we should get it right,\" Patten told a Broadcasting Press Guild lunch in London.</p> <p>\"We've been criticised in those areas and we think it's very important to listen to that criticism, not necessarily because it's right but because it reflects real and interesting concerns.\"</p> <p>Prebble's review will examine whether the BBC gives due weight to a range of opinions on controversial topics, including immigration, Islamophobia, and the EU.</p> <p>It is the fifth impartiality review by the BBC Trust and follows John Bridcut's 2007 report, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2007/jun/18/broadcasting.digitalmedia?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">From Seesaw to Wagon Wheel</a>. It will compare BBC news coverage from five years ago with today. The report is to be published in early 2013.</p> <p>The inquiry will examine whether editorial decisions to include or omit certain perspectives from news coverage have been carefully reached and with consistent judgment across the corporation.</p> <p>Prebble will investigate whether \"due weight\" has been given to a range of opinions, but the BBC Trust stressed that minority views should not necessarily be given equal prominence as the prevailing consensus.</p> <p>The BBC Trust has previously examined the impartiality of the corporation's coverage of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2007/may/25/citynews.broadcasting?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">business</a>, the UK nations, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/science/2011/jul/20/bbc-climate-change-science-coverage\" title=\"\">science</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/jun/25/bbc-trust-coverage-arab-spring\" title=\"\">the Arab spring</a>.</p> <p>In 2009, the BBC came under fire for two reports by the Middle East editor Jeremy Bowen on the Arab-Israeli conflict. The corporation's editorial standards committee found that Bowen had breached guidelines on impartiality when he referred to \"Zionism's innate instinct to push out the frontier\". A report published by the BBC Trust earlier this year described the broadcaster's coverage of the Arab spring as \"generally impartial\".</p> <p>Prebble, the former ITV chief executive and Grumpy Old Men producer, will lead the review. He said he would examine how the BBC views its own commitment to impartiality given the pace of change in technology, including the rise of social networks such as Facebook and Twitter.</p> <p>The BBC trustee David Liddiment said: \"The BBC's reputation for and commitment to impartiality is part of its DNA. This review will help to ensure it continues to meet audience expectations in this area, looking at how the BBC builds an understanding of breadth of opinion into its approach to its journalism.</p> <p>\"Part of the review will look at coverage of immigration, religion and the EU \u2013 not because we are anticipating a problem there, but because they are subjects on which there are obviously a range of opinions and which will make a valuable contribution to the review.\"</p> <p><em>\u2022 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.

It was a promotion in title, not pay. Relocating to New Jersey from California was good for me, I was happy. Settling into a new life was refreshing. I voted for Obama mostly because I knew he could handle the evolving economic crisis better than McCain. I did not expect the world economy to recover from the crisis at all. I'm surprised that we are not in a depression today and I believe Obama and Bernanke are responsible for keeping depression at bay. </p> <p><strong>NOW:</strong> Today, I still work at the same job I started in 2008, after surviving multiple layoffs. My pay is lower due to \"pension reform\". The reduction in take home pay due to increased health benefit costs and the loss of collective bargaining rights forced me into bankruptcy a year ago.</p> <p>I joined Occupy Wall Street on day one. I consider myself an activist against Wall Street now. I think about income inequality on a daily basis; being confronted with it in NYC is hard.</p> <p>I am voting for Obama because I see him as a firewall. He is able to block some efforts from corporations and investment firms to erode our lifestyle and freedoms even more than they already have.</p> <h2>'I'm disappointed in Obama', Tom Weber, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397603949\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/10/1349878158765/Tom-Weber-002.jpg\" alt=\"Tom Weber\" width=\"64\" height=\"64\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tom Weber Photograph: Tom Weber/Custom</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tom Weber/Custom</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>THEN:</strong>In 2008 I was fully employed as a college teacher. I voted for Obama because he appeared to be a progressive candidate who supported the things that I did \u2013 universal healthcare through a single-payer system, a ratcheting down of military spending, more money for education and the arts. <br> <strong>NOW:</strong> I have been unemployed for over a year, despite having a PhD, 25 years of teaching experience, and many relevant professional skills. I am watching full-time teaching jobs disappear and be replaced with low-paying part-time positions. The gap between the super-rich and the rest of us has widened, enabled by public policies that are bought and paid for by elite individuals and corporations. I am disappointed in Obama, but the alternative is unthinkable. </p> <h2>'My salary is almost back to where it was', Rachel, Portland, Oregon</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397603950\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/10/1349878847377/Rachel-Fossy-002.jpg\" alt=\"Rachel Fossy\" width=\"64\" height=\"64\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rachel Fossy Photograph: Rachel Fossy/Custom</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rachel Fossy/Custom</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>THEN:</strong> In 2008, I lived in a red state. There was a lot of poverty, a lot of bible thumping, and not very much compassion for the less fortunate. I was concerned about the lack of access to real health care for many Americans, and about how many were under-insured. I voted for Obama because, primarily, I hated the direction the country was going in, particularly for the poor. </p> <p><strong>NOW:</strong> This recession hammered my family \u2013 job loss, loss of value on our home, seven months unemployment, lengthy job searches. Three years after being laid off, my salary is finally back where it was. I will be voting Obama again. I also think Obama has been a great president, has a good grasp on economic matters, and cares about the little guy (more than the reps anyway). </p> <h2>'No president can truly fix a bad economy,' Robert Foster, Williamsburg, Virginia</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397603951\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2009/11/10/1257875916743/Avatar-green-001.jpg\" alt=\"Avatar green\" width=\"60\" height=\"60\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Avatar green Photograph: guardian.co.uk</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: guardian.co.uk</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>THEN:</strong>We both worked and were financially comfortable. We lost a lot money from our portfolio in the crash of '08, but that's been recouped. We voted for Obama more for the social and environmental issues. He hasn't turned out to be quite the man we had hoped he was, but considering the awful alternatives I'm satisfied that we voted the right way. A black president still makes me feel good (I'm white). </p> <p><strong>NOW:</strong> Nothing much has changed materially. Nobody got laid off or fired. We will both vote Obama. No president can truly fix a bad economy, but he can ameliorate it's negative effects if he has a willing Congress. So, it's down to the social issues again. We are concerned about the make-up of the Supreme Court. We fear what might happen to reproductive rights under Romney. We think corporations and wealthy individuals have too much control over our government.</p> <h2>'The impoverishment of the middle class includes those who service them', James Montgomery, New York, New York</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397603952\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/10/1349878293297/James-Montgomery-002.jpg\" alt=\"James Montgomery\" width=\"64\" height=\"64\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">James Montgomery Photograph: James Montgomery/Custom</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: James Montgomery/Custom</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>THEN:</strong> In 2008 I voted for Obama because I believed in health care reform and wanted the two wars to end. My verdict on Obama's first term is that it has been very mediocre. </p> <p><strong>NOW:</strong> Since 2008 I have certainly seen my disposable income fall. I am self-employed and my clients are largely individuals and small firms. With the general impoverishment of the middle class also comes the impoverishment of those who service them. I feel that Obama has looked after the huge corporations and banks, that he has been weak and vain and above all cares about how he will be seen by history.

I was interested in economic politics as they pertained to college students, things like student loan rates and funding for education. I'm firmly pro-choice and also an LGBTQ ally, so I wanted a candidate to reflect that. I really wanted to vote for Hillary Clinton, and did so in my State's primary, but in the end I voted for Barack Obama. </p> <p><strong>NOW:</strong> Since 2008 I have graduated from my undergraduate college and have received a master's degree from a UK university. While I am still concerned with the same issues from 2008, I am also acutely aware that the job market is not favorable. I'm pretty sure I'm receiving rejections from jobs before I've even submitted my application. I don't think Obama is as strong on economics as I would like in a candidate, but Mitt Romney's proposals are far worse. In truth, my middle class parents have had a very good turn with their jobs since Obama took office four years ago. I will be voting for Obama again this year. </p> <h2>'I have never voted, and probably never will', Sean, Boston, Massachusetts</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397603954\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2009/11/13/1258123322843/avatar-blue-001.jpg\" alt=\"avatar blue\" width=\"60\" height=\"60\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Avatar blue Photograph: guardian.co.uk</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: guardian.co.uk</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>THEN:</strong> I was let go from my job in August in 2007. I supported myself (paying rent and the MA health insurance mandate) by playing online and live poker, and collecting unemployment insurance benefits while sending out 15-20 resumes a week. I didn't vote because I live in MA, and Obama was going to win anyway. He talked tough on big banking and promised to hold the financial sector accountable.</p> <p><strong>NOW:</strong> I've had a job for 2.5 years, but it pays crap and the benefits are very poor. I still play live poker, but Obama's DOJ and the Republican Congress banned online poker from the USA, so 25%-50% my potential life earn was scrapped. Obama's Administration, littered with banking lobbyists (after saying he wouldn't do so), has given Wall Street criminals immunity.</p> <p>I don't plan to vote again because it won't change the fact I can't afford to finish college (or get a loan for it) and I can't afford to cut into the remaining debt I already have. The fact is: my situation won't change no matter who I vote for, as well as for most of my peers (minus a few ancillary details).

  "<p>The <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2004/jun/28/uselections2004.usa\">first time I met Susan Aylward</a>, in 2004, she had just emerged from the opening night of Michael Moore's Fahrenheit 9/11 in Akron, Ohio, and was shooing away John Kerry supporters who wanted to give her a sticker. She intended to vote for him and she even campaigned for him, but she had no intention of bragging about it. \"People don't love Kerry because they're not sure what he stands for,\" she said. \"But I'm going to vote for him because he's not Bush.\"</p> <p>Four years later she was positively excited at the prospect of an Obama presidency. \"I had high hopes,\" she says. \"After having to live for 8 years through Iraq and all of that stuff I really wanted Obama to be the counterpoint to that. He was a brilliant speaker. Pretty much everything about him made you hopeful. He reminded me of JFK.\"</p> <p>When we met at her house for breakfast <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2008/nov/01/us-elections2008-barack-obama\">just a week before the 2008 election</a> she was eager to contain her excitement. \"After the last two times I just don't want to jinx it,\" she said. \"Everything looks good. But I won't believe it until it actually happens.\" When he won she made her two-year-old granddaughter, who's mixed race, sit with her and watch the festivities. \"We kept saying: 'It's history, Sasha'. We wanted her to be able to say she saw it that day, even if she didn't really know what she was seeing.\"</p> <p>This time around she feels deflated. You can hear it in her voice as she works through her mixed emotions. It's almost as though she cast a vote for Barack Obama and got Kerry instead. \"It's not going to change my vote,\" she says. \"But I just wish he could have been better. I don't even know how exactly. If you're going to be president then I guess you obviously want to be in the history books. So what does he want to be in the history books for? I don't quite know the answer to that yet.\"</p> <p>There is a peculiar quality to the disappointment among Democrats <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/video/2010/oct/18/gary-younge-america-obama-mania-video\">when it comes to talk of Obama's first term</a>. Most feel it but few will own it. Some project it, others deflect it. Many are in denial, some are in mourning. They struggle with it, qualify it, rationalise it, <a href=\"http://www.thenation.com/article/167344/what-do-we-see-obama\">calibrate it and question it</a>. </p> <p>Did he raise expectations too high or were unreasonable expectations imposed upon him? Was he <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/oct/13/barack-obama-cool-to-cold\">too compliant with the Republican Congress</a> or was he trying to fulfill his promise to be more consensual? They wanted more and they're not sure whether their aspirations were reasonable, feasible, justified or deluded. They wish the disappointment wasn't there. And they can't avoid it.</p> <p>For this is one emotional toll that could have electoral consequences. In a tight race in which there are few undecideds both sides have to galvanise their bases. The Obama campaign has tried trying to manage it, lest the disappointment <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/sep/17/barack-obama-election-gary-youngeturnout\">depress enthusiasm and harm</a>. In Charlotte <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/2012/09/06/160713941/transcript-president-obamas-convention-speech\">Obama told the convention</a>: \"While I'm proud of what we've achieved together, I'm far more mindful of my own failings, knowing exactly what Lincoln meant when he said: \"I have been driven to my knees many times by the overwhelming conviction that I had no place else to go.\"</p> <p>Republicans are keen to leverage it, in the hope that with a show of empathy they can win over some precious waverers. Mitt Romney spoke over the heads of his convention-goers to disaffected Obama supporters: \"You know there's something wrong with the kind of job he's done as president when the best feeling you had was the day you voted for him.\" Now <a href=\"http://hotair.com/archives/2012/10/06/new-romney-ad-presses-obama-disappointment-theme/\">they are running ads</a>, mostly featuring women, to appeal to swing voters. \"I'm disappointed in Barack Obama as my president,\" says Melanie McNamara, who voted for him in 2008. \"He promised to bring us all together so we could prosper, and I don't see the prospering.\"</p> <p>Given the excitement at Obama's election some measure of disappointment was inevitable. The combination of both the historic nature of both his candidacy and the economic crisis during which it emerged virtually ensured it. The first black president elected during the steepest downturn since the Great Depression <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2008/nov/24/barack-obama-nic-hillary-clinton\">set the nation on contradictory paths</a>. In Harlem people were dancing in the street even as, at the other end of Manhattan, Wall Street was sending the economy into free fall. The month he was elected \u2013 two months before he took office \u2013 he had a 61% approval rating while only one in six believed the country was heading in the right direction, and it was unlikely one person could correct the course of a tanker the size of the US economy.</p> <h2>'I never thought things could become more divided'</h2> <p>After <a href=\"http://www.thenation.com/article/believers-great-men-think-alike \">rereading The God That Failed</a>, in which six ex-Marxists voice their disaffection with communism, the late Palestinian intellectual Edward Said questioned the very premise in the title. \"Why as an intellectual did you believe in a god anyway? And besides, who gave you the right to imagine that your early belief and later disenchantment were so important?\" One might say the same of some Obama supporters whose investment in him was rooted in an unreasonable belief that the presidency endowed Obama with superhuman powers. \"This is not some academic exercise,\" Obama told supporters in Philadelphia in 2010. \"Don't compare us to the Almighty; compare us to the alternative.\"</p> <p>That's why Susan believes people must, to some extent, take responsibility for their disappointment. \"That's what we're taught to believe from an early age,\" she says. \"That one man should be able to fix everything. Abe Lincoln, George Washington, Ronald Reagan \u2013 history's told as though it were all down to them. The world is way too complex for that, and we know that but we still have those expectations that we were raised with.\"</p> <p>And while some of the expectations may have been unreasonable some were just plain unfounded. On election night in 2008 <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2008/nov/06/uselections2008-usa\">I watched the result come in</a> the President's Lounge on the South Side of Chicago. As Obama was announced the winner a woman at the bar started cheering. \"My man's in Afghanistan. He's coming home.\" Quite why she thought that wasn't clear. But it wasn't true. Afghanistan was the one war Obama had pledged to continue and which he would eventually escalate. Where she'd got the impression otherwise is not clear. But her disappointment was guaranteed and had little to do with him.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397516241\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/10/1349879439048/obama-younge-america-010.jpg\" alt=\"obama younge america\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">One of Obama's first acts in January 2009 was to sign an executive order closing the prison at Guantanamo Bay.

Photograph: J Scott Applewhite/AP</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: J Scott Applewhite/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Indeed one of the sources of disappointment, particularly from abroad, is that people mistook the fact that his election marked a radical departure from the previous eight years as <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/cifamerica/2010/jan/17/barack-obama-one-year-on\">an indication that he was a radical</a>. He wasn't. His record both as a state senator and on the national level, where he voted with Hilary Clinton 90% of the time, was of a centrist Democrat. Unlike black presidential candidates of the past, who were unlikely to get white support, he was not standing to advance a broader cause <a href=\"http://www.thenation.com/article/obama-effect\">but to get elected</a>. \"The civil rights generation saw politics as the next step in the struggle for civil rights,\" said Salim Muwakkil, a Chicago-based journalist who has known Obama for many years. \"Their aim was to get their agenda taken up by whoever won. But this new generation do not conceive politics as the next step, but just as what it is \u2013 politics. Their aim is to win.\"</p> <p>But the fact that he didn't stand on a radical platform doesn't mean people were deluded to imagine that he would govern as a radical. In January 2007 I <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2007/feb/10/usa.uselections2008\">saw him speak at George Mason University</a> to a 1,000-plus crowd where he quoted Martin Luther King: \"The arc of justice is long but bends towards justice.\" He promised his presidency would be transformative and in campaign speeches he invoked abolitionists, suffragettes and labour activists and then Will.I.Am <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjXyqcx-mYY\">set it to song</a>. \"Nothing can stand in the way of the power of millions of voices calling for change,\" he said. \"We have been asked to pause for a reality check. We have been warned against offering people of this nation false hope.\" One could be forgiven for thinking he wasn't just talking about marginal tax rates and cap and trade.</p> <p>Such were the nature of the aspirations and potential disappointments, both projected onto him and which he projected himself, before he even took office. Then <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2009/jan/19/obama-inauguration\">there is his record</a>. Pretty much everybody has their pet disappointment here: a specific thing they'd wanted to see but haven't or, conversely, wished he hadn't done. Most frequently mentioned are failing to close Guantanamo Bay, political polarisation, drone attacks, comprehensive immigration reform, kill lists and<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/jul/15/democrats-romney-firing-obama\"> failing to oversee stronger regulation of the financial sector</a>. It is intriguing how many Obama loyalists explain these problems away with a mixture of psychoanalysis and Donald Rumsfeld's \"unknown unknowns\". </p> <p>\"I know he's smart. I know he's caring,\" says Bobbi Watson, who was with Susan the night I met her outside the cinema eight years ago. \"But when I think about the drone attacks, which trouble me, I think he's making decisions on the basis of information that I couldn't possibly know.\"</p> <p>Many redirect their disappointment in politics in general,<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2011/mar/27/obama-no-credible-republican-challenger\"> pointing to the Republican stonewalling in Congress</a>. \"I never thought things could become more divided, and there be more fighting,\" said Ann Trinkel, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/oct/01/younge-america-return-roanoke\">who I met in Roanoke recently</a>. \"But oh my gosh it's just \u2026 gridlock. And I guess that's what sort of lessened the hopefulness for me, and made me a bit more cynical, is all the money.\" It is certainly true that in a system where seats are openly gerrymandered, 40% in the upper house can block almost anything, lobbyists are everywhere and you need vast sums of money to get elected there is a limit to how much <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/oct/07/americans-deserve-better-choice-election\">progressive change one can really expect</a>. Susan's husband, Michael who backed Obama last time, isn't voting. He's had enough of all of them.</p> <p>Some are just in denial. One person said to me when I raised the escalation in Afghanistan: \"You don't know what's in his heart.\"</p> <p>\"True,\" I replied. \"Only his cardiologist can know that. But that knowledge would make little difference to the people of Afghanistan.\"</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397516242\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/10/1349879038034/obama-younge-america--010.jpg\" alt=\"obama younge america \" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The enthusiasm of Obama supporters \u2013 so prevalent on election night in 2008 \u2013 has waned in the last four years.

In any case, every president has these. So long as they are not full on reversals \u2013 as when George Bush senior said: \"Read my lips: no new taxes\" and then put up taxes \u2013 then they are rarely fatal. Obama hasn't opened another Guantanamo Bay facility, and it is understood that presidents don't get everything done that they promise to do.</p> <p>But that does not mean they are not grounds for disappointment. Obama ran claiming he was going to change the way Washington operated, and there was much he could not control. But it was his choice to leave in place George W Bush's secretary of defence and to draft of Bill Clinton's former treasury secretary, Larry Summers, to guide his economic policy. With those appointments there's only so much 'change' one can reasonably expect. Moreover, <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/OTUS/guantanamo-bay-open-promises/story?id=16698768\">if someone who says</a>: \"I have said repeatedly that I intend to close Guantanamo, and I will follow through on that,\" and promises it'll be closed within a year and it's still open, then by any measure people are entitled to feel let down.</p> <p>But left there all of these particular disappointments would have remained just that \u2013 particular letdowns that disillusioned discrete groups of people. What morphed them into a broader narrative of disappointment was the one thing over was the key issue of the economy over which he had limited power \u2013 and gridlock in Congress.</p> <p>In September 2010 he was <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBfCco9BOTA\">challenged at a town hall meeting</a> by a black woman, Velma Hart, who said: \"I'm exhausted. I'm exhausted of defending you, defending your administration, defending the mantle of change that I voted for, and deeply disappointed with where we are right now.\"</p> <p>With poverty rising, unemployment stubbornly high and wages still stagnant the economy was both a material problem in itself \u2013 people have been struggling to make ends meet \u2013 and became an emblem for a broader disaffection. The country was stalled. And whatever it was they were expecting from his presidency it wasn't this. They wanted more and, many believe, he promised more.</p> <h2>'It seems like there's no good way out'</h2> <p>Jodie Delamatre has no time for this. She is no stranger to disappointment. I <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2004/nov/03/uselections2004.usa2\">followed Jodie around on election day in 2004</a> as she knocked on doors to get out the vote. I saw her in the polling booth press her pin down hard to avoid through the punch card for Kerry to avoid any Florida-like shenanigans. \"I've got to make sure it counts,\" she said. \"I don't want to leave anything to chance.\" That night when the polls closed they thought they'd squeaked a victory in Ohio and therefore the nation. When I called her the next morning she was devastated.</p> <p>This time around she wished Obama had done more about the banks. But she thinks those who dwell on their disappointments are self-indulgent. \"People <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2008/nov/10/barack-obama-supporters-campaign\">ask what has he done and I think well what did you do</a>? You can't just have things given to you all the time. You have to go out and get them. And look at the things he has done. In four years he's introduced healthcare reform, stabilised the economy, stopped a war, killed Bin Laden, saved the auto industry \u2013 give me a break.\" When Obama was inaugurated <a href=\"http://www.google.com/publicdata/explore?ds=z1ebjpgk2654c1_&amp;met_y=unemployment_rate&amp;idim=county:CN391530&amp;fdim_y=seasonality:U&amp;dl=en&amp;hl=en&amp;q=summit+county+oh+unemployment\">unemployment in Summit County</a>, where Akron sits, was 8.8%; today it is 6.5%. In 2009 the poverty rate is 14.9; today it is 13.8%.</p> <p>It is true that if you ask most people what they thought would happen their hopes are as heartfelt as they are vague. \"I definitely think it's about me,\" says Susan. \"I hoped he would give us a vision of where we were going. Just one big idea. But it doesn't seem as though he has one. I did hope that he would be that person who would pull it off. Because otherwise it seems like there's no good way out.\"</p> <p>Obama's election forced a reckoning between what a large number of Americans wanted to happen and what was possible to achieve through the American polity as it stands. The hard truth is that <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/cifamerica/2010/oct/24/obama-never-room-for-radical-change\">with few exceptions</a> the most transformational advances in US political history have their origins either in the streets or the courts \u2013 not the ballot box.</p>",
  "<p>The Palestinian-born cleric Abu Qatada will resist a fresh attempt to deport him at a hearing of the special immigration appeals commission (SIAC) in central London on Wednesday.</p> <p>The terror suspect, whose real name is Omar Othman, was first arrested in Britain in 2002. Since then he has either been in prison or under severely restrictive bail conditions which, at one stage, included a 22-hour curfew.</p> <p>The government is eager to extradite Qatada to Jordan, where he was convicted in his absence of being involved in two terrorist conspiracies in 1999 and 2000 to carry out bomb attacks.</p> <p>But in January the European court of human rights in Strasbourg ruled that evidence of his involvement was obtained by torturing one of his co-defendants and there was a high probability it would be used at a retrial, where it would be \"of considerable, perhaps decisive importance\".</p> <p>Following several ministerial visits to the Jordanian capital, Amman, this summer, the Home Office believes it has now been provided with sufficiently robust reassurances that no evidence obtained through torture will be used against Qatada and that he will receive a fair trial.</p> <p>The SIAC hearing is expected to last seven days before a three-person judicial panel. Qatada, who was born in Bethlehem at a time when it was part of Jordan, is not due to be in court for the proceedings. In May a judge ruled that granting him bail during the Olympics Games, pending a full hearing, would be \"exceptionally problematic\".</p> <p>The Home Office says videotapes of Qatada sermons influenced Mohamed Atta, the ringleader of the September 11 attacks on the United States.</p> <p>A Home Office spokesperson said: \"Qatada is a dangerous man and we intend to remove him as quickly as possible. We are confident the assurances we have secured from the Jordanians will allow us to do this. This is now a matter for the courts.\"</p>",

His clear message was that Britain could do anything if it was determined enough. In an Olympic year in which our athletes delivered golden glory and the whole country delivered both organisational efficiency and magical settings it was a believable message.</p> <p>Cameron didn't stop with his optimism, however. People expect Tory governments to be bold and energetic. People expect the party of Margaret Thatcher to be in favour of aspiration and enterprise. What they also want from modern government is a sense of compassion and decency. In was in this respect that Cameron succeeded. He reasserted his commitment to the NHS, disabled people, the aid budget and gay rights. He might not have persuaded huge numbers yet but he signalled his determination to stay true to compassionate conservatism. He'll go into the next election fighting Labour for the moral high ground; arguing that his vision of a good society \u2013 built around better schools, stronger families and job creation \u2013 is superior to Labour's unthinking reliance on a bigger and bigger state.</p> <p>Ed Miliband did nothing last week to address Labour's biggest weakness \u2013 the sense that his party hasn't learned any lessons from its mistakes. Miliband did nothing to convince people that another Labour government wouldn't plunge the economy back into debt. Cameron showed today that he does get it. He understands that he must convince the British people that the Conservative party is as compassionate as it is tough. He hasn't succeeded in that task yet but at least, unlike Miliband, he's started to face up to his challenge.</p> <p>\u2022 Tim Montgomerie edits Conservativehome.com</p> <h2>Stewart Wood: To whom does 'sink-or-swim' refer?</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397506877\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/1/9/1326133501065/Stewart-Wood-003.jpg\" alt=\"Stewart Wood\" width=\"140\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Stewart Wood Photograph: Stewart Wood</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stewart Wood</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Tories have spent their conference in response mode to Ed Miliband's \"one nation\" speech last week. David Cameron's speech today took this defensiveness to new heights. But it also revealed the limits of his ability to meet both the challenge Ed laid down, and the public's demand for change.</p> <p>I was struck by Cameron's central metaphor of Britain facing a \"sink or swim\" moment. All parties must recognise the tough choices the economic moment requires. The first demand of a government in tough times is an economic strategy that works. But as growth continues to stagnate and debt rises, we all know that Cameron's plan is not working. Waving the spectre of decline in the face of the British public does not an economic strategy make, and does not excuse their refusal to talk about growth and jobs all week.</p> <p>My strong suspicion remains that \"sink or swim\" is not just Cameron's motto for how Britain competes internationally, but also for the kind of economy and society that he wants to see at home in Britain. His challenge was to prove that his vision for the country is one that can extend to everyone rather than simply holding promise for the few. Today's speech failed that test, just as his mission to modernise the party has gone into reverse since he was elected prime minister.</p> <p>It has been a Tory conference dominated by the dictates of party management, with a series of scattergun announcements designed to keep different parts of the Tory fold happy. What today's speech confirmed was that Cameron is either unwilling or incapable of being a one-nation prime minister, and of delivering the kind of radical change that Britain needs.</p> <p>\u2022 Stewart Wood is an adviser to Ed Miliband in the leader's office</p> <h2>Ian Birrell: Modern conservatism that unites the party's left and right</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397506878\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/2/13/1329122986331/Ian-Birrell---new-003.jpg\" alt=\"Ian Birrell - new\" width=\"140\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ian Birrell</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ian Birrell</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>David Cameron will never be an orator whose barnstorming speaking rouses a hall to its feet. He strikes out the flashier phrases, the more flowery paragraphs proposed by his speechwriters, as not being true to his character. But this year's conference speech, for all its earnest delivery, was his best since he saw off the Gordon Brown election attempt in 2007. Not just because it contained a handful of memorable zingers \u2013 the best of which was the return volley to Ed Miliband, saying Labour was \"the party of one notion \u2013 borrowing\". Not just for the genuinely moving mention of what the Paralympics meant to him as the father of a child with disabilities. And not just for the skillful and self-deprecating way in which he deflected issues such as his background and his school.</p> <p>No, it worked because Cameron clearly set out his vision of compassionate Conservatism. For too long, this narrative has been lying almost dormant amid the focus on the deficit. It was explained not just with the simplistic lines that his party was one that welcomed anyone whether they were black or white, gay or straight. Instead, there was a clear argument that there has to be tough action to reform the welfare state so it works for those most in need. And that in doing so, tackling the \"toxic culture of low ambition that has held our country back\", Britain would be better placed to fight the challenges of fast-rising nations such as Indonesia and Nigeria as well as the likes of China.</p> <p>In the best modernising tradition, there was little mention of Europe and no mention of conference crowd-pleasers such as crime and immigration. Instead, there was a definition of modern conservatism that unites the left and right of the party while challenging the shallow one-nation rhetoric of his rivals. As he drives back to Downing Street, Cameron can reflect on a job well done at the end of a conference in which his party rediscovered its confidence after an abysmal six months. Then comes the harder bit of ensuring all his government's actions match these fine words, as reforms such as those to disability benefits start to bite.</p> <p>\u2022 Ian Birrell is a former speechwriter for David Cameron</p> <h2>Frances O'Grady: His claims about job creation don't stack up</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397506879\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/7/25/1343230313175/FrancesOGrady.jpg\" alt=\"Frances O'Grady\" width=\"140\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>This was an empty speech from a prime minister unwilling to accept that his economic policies are failing to deliver the jobs and growth that hard-pressed families desperately need. The speech was light on solutions. And with the UK still in a double-dip recession, living standards continuing to fall and record numbers still out of work the UK needs more than half-baked aspirations.</p> <p>There were some things the prime minister was right about. I agree that our economy desperately needs investment. It's a shame that his government has cut capital spending by 50%.</p> <p>He's also right about needing to get the deficit down. What the prime minister failed to mention was that his austerity strategy is causing borrowing to rise, with the deficit now back to around where it was in 2010.</p> <p>Everyone agrees we need more good and sustainable jobs. But his claim to have created a million private sector jobs doesn't stack up. Full-time employee jobs are only up 130,000. Meanwhile we have an under-employment crisis \u2013 over 3 million people needing more hours to make ends meet and 2.5 million people out of work altogether.</p> <p>The prime minister has a cheek to claim that cutting people's benefits is a good way to force them into work when there aren't enough jobs for them to do. And proposing cuts in housing benefit for young families isn't compassionate \u2013 it's inhumane.</p> <p>This wasn't a speech with new thinking on the big challenges for the future. It was more of the same old ideas that didn't work the first time round.</p> <p>\u2022 Frances O'Grady is general secretary designate of the TUC</p>",
  "<p>A repeat of this year's washout summer is the last thing most people want from the English weather \u2013 but more of the same could be on the way, and could become the norm, a new study has warned, thanks to human activities warming the climate.</p> <p>Ice melting in the Arctic has been linked to duller, wetter English summers in a much-anticipated study <a href=\"http://www.agu.org/journals/gl/gl1219/2012GL053268/\" title=\"\">published online on Wednesday in the journal Geophysical Research Letters</a>.</p> <p>Last month, the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/sep/19/arctic-ice-shrinks\" title=\"\">extent and volume of the ice reached a record low</a>. Experts <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/sep/17/arctic-collapse-sea-ice?intcmp=239\" title=\"\">warned that the Arctic could be free of sea ice in summer within this decade</a>. Satellite pictures of Greenland, where the ice sheet rests on land, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/jul/24/greenland-ice-sheet-thaw-nasa\" title=\"\">showed more widespread melting than ever recorded</a>.</p> <p>Scientists from the Universities of Sheffield in the UK and Rutgers and Washington in the US, with the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, have established what they say is a clear link between the shrinking ice and more extreme weather in lower latitudes, through weather effects such as the \"Arctic amplification\" and shifting wind patterns.</p> <p>Edward Hanna, co-author of the study at Sheffield University, said the research should alert people in the UK to the reality of global warming: \"It really puts global warming in the public eye. It's virtually impossible to predict the weather for any particular summer but we could have cooler, wetter summers on average in the UK because of this effect. That's not to say we won't get hot, dry summers but just that these might not be as frequent as you might expect from a straightforward global warming effect. There seems to have been a new regime in summer 2007 that has more or less stayed in place since.\"</p> <p>This year's weather broke records in England, for a dry spring followed by the wettest ever April to June, and June had the second lowest sunshine on record. For most people, the weather was a disappointment as one dull and rainy day followed another. But for others, the pain was even greater \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/oct/10/food-prices-rise-wettest-summer\" title=\"\">farmers suffered the worst weather combination</a>, with drought followed by a disastrously damp spell that first withered and then waterlogged crops. Retailers and the leisure industries were also hurt, with people eschewing barbecue food and tourists and holidaymakers avoiding attractions.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Greenlanders and inhabitants of some of the most northern isles of the UK enjoyed glorious sunshine.</p> <p>This weather pattern was linked to the position of the jet stream, which normally brings settled weather to the UK in the summer but has been shifting in position for the past several years. The past six summers have been duller and wetter than the long-term average, according to the Met Office.</p> <p>For the new study, researchers examined data from the past six summers. They found west- to east-flowing winds in high latitudes have been replaced by a wavier pattern in those years, which contributed to the dull weather further south.</p> <p>Many people in the UK assume that global warming would bring them hotter and drier weather \u2013 a \"Mediterranean climate\", according to common predictions. This study shows that the reality may be much less pleasant.</p> <p>Hanna said: \"While global warming itself may pass unnoticed by many, its complex interactions with ice and snow in high latitudes are expected to alter atmospheric circulations that contribute to enhanced Arctic warming, further melt, and an increased probability of extreme weather events both in the Arctic and in mid-latitudes.\"</p> <p>One of the factors behind this year's record ice melt was stronger winds flowing from the Bering Straits in the Arctic, across the north pole and over the Atlantic, transferring heat from the south to further north and pushing sea ice further north across the Arctic, according to the research. Over Greenland, unusually high pressure led to the record melting across nearly the whole of the land ice sheet.</p> <p>If Arctic ice continues at low levels in future summers, more extreme weather is likely in future, the study found.</p>",
  "<p>Are rising bills at the supermarket checkout turning out to be the first tangible impact of climate change on the daily lives of all Britons? It very much seems so.</p> <p>The damage wreaked by the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/oct/10/food-prices-rise-wettest-summer?intcmp=122\">dismal summer of 2012 on UK harvests</a> was revealed on Monday and will push food prices up. In these austere times, with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/aug/21/councils-invest-food-banks-welfare-cuts\">food banks</a> feeding the hungry, that is going to hurt.</p> <p>There are two lessons to be learned. First, the UK is not going to gradually warm into a pleasant Mediterranean climate, with sunny resorts on the coast supplied by burgeoning English vineyards. The heating of the climate system leads to greater extremes in weather and greater damage. Second, with much of our food imported from around the world, the totals we tot up at the tills is at the mercy of global warming's impact on the whole globe.</p> <p>The UK has suffered a run of sodden summers over the last half dozen years or so. Untangling the influence of humanity's carbon dioxide pollution from natural variations in a complex and chaotic weather system is not easy, but a fast growing number of studies are beginning to make firm links.</p> <p>Warmer waters in the North Atlantic were <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/science/2012/oct/07/north-atlantic-ocean-wet-summer\">linked to wet UK summers</a> in a study published on Monday, with its authors stating \"there is lot of evidence to show that climate change is changing the timing and magnitude\" of natural cycles. New research published today links a change in <a href=\"http://www.agu.org/pubs/crossref/2012/2012GL053268.shtml\">summer Arctic wind patterns to the ice melted by global warming</a> and to an increase in unpredictable UK weather. Edward Hanna, at the University of Sheffield, led that study and said: \"While global warming itself may pass unnoticed by many, its complex interactions with ice in high latitudes are expected to contribute to ... an increased probability of extreme weather events both in the Arctic and in mid-latitudes.\" The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/science/2012/aug/08/shape-of-british-summers-to-come\">meandering of the jet stream</a>, which usually shepherds rainstorms to the north of the UK, is a key factor.</p> <p>Around the world, the damage global warming can cause to food production is becoming clearer. A heatwave in Russia this summer has destroyed a third of its vast grain crop. A similar devastating heatwave in 2010 has been <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/feb/21/climate-change-russian-heatwave\">directly linked to global warming</a> by scientists, who concluded the chances of it happening had been tripled by our fossil fuel burning. Another study predicted that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/mar/17/deadly-heatwaves-europe?INTCMP=ILCNETTXT3487\">\"mega-heatwaves\" in Europe</a> will become five to 10 times more likely over the next 40 years.</p> <p>In the US this summer, the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/jul/23/us-drought-global-food-crisis\">worst drought in 50 years</a> has destroyed almost <a href=\"http://www.hsbcnet.com/gbm/global-insights/insights/2012/less-bread-for-your-dough.html\">half the corn crop and a third of the soya bean crop</a>. It will take time for scientists to elucidate the link to climate change here, but more heatwaves are exactly what are expected in a overheating world.</p> <p>The message of the UK's dreadful harvest is clear, according to Prof Richard Tiffin, director of the Centre for Food Security at University of Reading. \"It should be a major warning that climate change is increasingly having a global impact on the food supply. If the problems in Russia, the UK and the US this year were combined with a failure of the Indian monsoon, we could see a major global food crisis that would have an enormous impact on food prices and badly affect poor people in the UK and around the world.\"</p> <p>If anything, Tiffin's warning should be even starker: 50 civil wars since 1950 have been <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/aug/24/el-nino-cycle-deadly-conflict\">triggered by climatic changes cutting food production</a>, and some research suggests soaring food prices was a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/damian-carrington-blog/2011/aug/25/food-price-arab-middle-east-protests\">key trigger in the Arab Spring</a> uprisings.</p> <p>In 2009, the UK government's chief scientific adviser, Sir John Beddington, warned the world faced a<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/science/2009/mar/18/perfect-storm-john-beddington-energy-food-climate\"> \"perfect storm\" of food, water and energy problems</a>, due to <a href=\"http://www.bis.gov.uk/go-science/news/speeches/the-perfect-storm\">global warming and the rising world population</a>. The UK has experienced soaring energy bills, droughts and floods, and now crop failures. Beddington predicted his storm would hit in 2030.

  "<p>The ground shook around Jewel and he crashed into the frame of the metal box. He cartwheeled like a seasoned gymnast just as the crane came crashing down, cutting through the top of the control cabin.</p> <p>It was snowing heavily and the ice froze Jewel's unprotected head. The whole mine had split apart from the explosion. Half of it had crumbled like dissolving salt. The rest was cracked and uneven. Most of it tilted down into the giant cavern that had once been the mining pit. The red lights blinked on as the shriek of the emergency alert cut through the cold air.</p> <p>Very slowly, a giant figure was rising out of the pit, as if making use of his limbs for the very first time, like a baby. Jewel barely glanced at the miners, rushing about in fear. He thought of the operation that had been assigned to him five days ago, and how it had come to this.<br><strong><br>7 Days Ago:</strong></p> <p>Doomus's heels made sharp clicking noises as he walked on the blood-dyed marble. It was made of the hardest skulls, as had been said by the owner of 'HELL HALLS Inc.' He regretted the gift he had presented to his father for his 4.55 billionth birthday.</p> <p>He crossed a dark courtyard adorned with beautiful blood-bloomed roses. The sky was blazing red. Crows and vultures looked down from their perches on the dead trees. He opened a shadow door with a shadow key and cautiously tip- toed into his father's library.</p> <p>His father was quite famous in the world of humans for all the wrong reasons. He was the devil. He was known by many names but 'Devil' was his original identity. A strong palm on his shoulder suddenly pulled Doomus back. He whirled around to find his father staring at him with his dark, deep red eyes. He was a muscular hell-man. He had muscles the size of femurs, as hard as diamond. He wore a suit with his long, trident shaped tail jutting out, which he used on his enemies. He had the horns of a goat, not of a bull.</p> <p>He stared at Doomus, disappointed by what he saw. Doomus had no muscles, but was thin and weak. He didn't have horns and had weak eyesight. He steered Doomus clear off the wall and dragged him (unknowingly dragged) into a chair.</p> <p> \"Doomus. I need your help. You are smart. You can open the core of the earth with your sorcery.\"</p> <p>Doomus replied,\" I will try father.\" </p> <p>The core contained a mysterious trophy. This trophy could help them take over the world!</p> <p><strong>5 Days Ago:</strong></p> <p>Jewel knew that he should not have accepted the assignment. But D.T stood in front of him, staring past his head, looking at an unknown destination. Jewel knew he was calculating risks, going over the plan, looking for loopholes.</p> <p>The plan was this:</p> <p>There had been illegal mining taking place in Russia. The miners were causing a major threat to the Russian government. Jewel was supposed to go and find a way to stop the mining. This sounded ridiculous, but nothing was ridiculous in front of D.T's eyes. Especially since the miners were carrying guns, grenades and Flash Grenades. They must have had something to hide.</p> <p>Jewel was sucked back into reality when his helping hand, a Siberian husky called Gem nudged him with his snout. Gem was white in colour with flashing grey stripes on his back. He was a very clever specimen of Siberian huskies. Gem nudged him again, this time more persistently. D.T was staring at him, with his eyebrow raised like a question mark. </p> <p>\"Well?\" he asked. </p> <p>\"I accept\", replied Jewel in a grim tone. This was his fifteenth mission. </p> <p>Jewel was to be kitted with the translator Bluetooth communications headset; Pulse, heat, x-ray and thermal vision; SR-98 sniper rifle, Walther P99 and a helmet with complete arctic warfare gear.</p> <p>Jewel slept through the ride on the giant Hercules airplane. It had a modified Jet engine and was able to hover on the spot, which it did as soon as it was time for Jewel and Gem to parachute into the mountains. Jewel was nervous to jump off when the ramp opened up. He took a running leap and dived off, expecting to feel the rush of wind on his face but the mask and goggles repelled it all. The next thing he knew, his parachute opened with a jerk,<br>pulling him up as the air got trapped in. He landed next to a metal box. The lookout point! He rushed through the blizzard and opened the front door.</p> <p>It was surprisingly warm inside. A fire glowed brightly in the hearth. A set of snug sofas and chairs stood around a 'SAMSUNG 52 POLEGADAS 1080 3D TOUCH SCREEN' television set. An XBOX was connected into the panel behind it. A boy stood in the room, examining a set of 3d blueprints on the TV. He turned around and gave Jewel a bright smile. </p> <p>\"Hello Jewel. I'm Keshav, but you can call me Snipes. This is my helping hand, Dash!\" He pointed to a dog in a camouflage suit, sitting at his feet. He was a chocolate brown Miniature Pinscher. \"Come in. I'll give you something to eat. Would you like Indian or Chinese cuisine?\" </p> <p>Two hours later, Jewel was seated on a comfy sofa. He was watching the screen. Keshav was giving an explanation on how the mine worked. </p> <p>\"The workers are under a spell. I can guarantee it. I think that the spell works from the bottom of the mine. If we can get to the control room, we can break<br>the charm and help the miners. There's something we're not being told but don't ponder over it tonight and have sweet dreams.\"</p> <p><strong>1 Day Ago:</strong></p> <p>They had been scouting the mine for four days. Now, it was time to move in on the target. They were kitted up again. Keshav and Dash led Jewel and Gem into an underground bunker where the weapons were stored. It was sealed with a passcode. Jewel was surprised by the amount of crates that were stacked around him. Keshav opened one to reveal two white snowmobiles that were packed with emergency gear. A walk ahead revealed an armored jeep. This was their escape transport system. </p> <p>He jumped in and closed the door to reveal a warm interior. Keshav got in beside him.</p> <p>\"I'll drive,\" said Jewel. He typed the coordinates into the SATNAV. They got to see the mine from the close mountain. Jewel held up binoculars and looked through to reveal a closer view of the complex. There was a ski jump leading to the control room. There were many heavy cranes and buildings. The area was crawling with guards. Keshav extracted the snowmobiles and they set off into the blizzard that formed around them.</p> <p>They rode silently to the ski jump, dropping any of the guards that came by. They were soon streaking down a sparkling white set of stairs. They ditched the mobiles and snuck up to the door of the control room. Keshav kicked it open and ran in, screaming orders in Russian. Jewel hefted his Dragunov and followed. He was surprised to find the control room filled with people. A red man sat in front of them. A smaller version of this man sneered at them from behind him. </p> <p>\"Hello, Welcome to the room of hell! I'm Devil, your host for tonight. You must be the boys that Dump Thump sent me!\"</p> <p>Jewel was tied to a chair and was forced to listen to the man's words. Gem was thrown onto his chest and against the man's wishes; it provided him a small comfort. The man looked at them. He took a breath and began to speak.</p> <p>\"I was born 4.55 billion years ago. I was an interesting child. I was able to do evil things. They called me De Vilan. That's old world talk for the 'Judge of Life.' That is what I became: Devil. I have planned something great for the world. It is the greatest calamity of all. I have always wanted to be king!\" He paused and spoke again. \"I could not rule a living world. Now I will rule a dead world!\" He laughed like a maniac. </p> <p>That was when a worker interrupted, \" Sir! Our magic level is going down in the pot. Please do something!\" </p> <p>The young devil walked to an oozing cauldron beside him and said some gibberish. The metal vessel filled again. </p> <p>\"Sir! The mine is vibrating! It is beginning!\" </p> <p>\"Yes!\" screamed Devil. He walked to the bank of computers on the side. Then the world exploded!</p> <p><strong>Present Time:</strong></p> <p>Jewel woke up. It had been almost 24 hours since he had been wounded. Chaos was all around him. He got to his feet, only to lose his center of balance again. Keshav was standing over him. He pulled Jewel onto his shoulder. Dash did the same for Gem. They were off.</p> <p>A figure was coming out of the pit, spitting fire. The iced edges of the mine had melted. Keshav supported Jewel to a nearby lift and helped him in. Jewel was relieved when he saw the bright light of the outside world. He got to his feet and struggled to the door. The miners ran up and down. Jewel realized that he was on a platform high above the mine. The C4 they had planted at ground level had exploded, ripping the mine apart. The noise of screaming men scared him. He pushed through the crowd and to the exit of the mine. </p> <p>The young devil appeared in front of him. </p> <p>\"This is your fault! My father is dead! I will kill you!\" </p> <p>He lunged forward, dagger in hand. Jewel dodged him. The boy changed his form into that of a bull. An imaginary voice rang out behind Jewel's temple: <em>Senores, Senoritas! Witness the battle to death!</em> The bull lunged towards him. </p> <p>\"Nobody can stop me unless my brain is blown out!\" And his brain was blown out. Good thing. Bad thing, it was scrambled on the white, icy ground (and unfortunately onto Jewel's protective suit). Keshav had fired from his gun! The boy (bull, same thing) fell. His dagger slipped away. </p> <p>Keshav resumed his journey to the Snipes' Mobile. As he passed the mine pit, he threw all the last bags of C4 into it. They came into contact with the figure and exploded. He screamed in pain and began to sink back down into the earth. Jewel was in the car before he knew it. He drifted into a dream world as the car started up and drove away. He knew that every turn of the wheel would lead him away from the horrible pit.</p> <p><strong>7 Days Later:</strong></p> <p>Keshav was a little nervous. They were sitting side by side in Dump Thump's study. The kangaroo himself sat in front of them.</p> <p>\"I know you are wanting an explanation. The giant creature in the mine was a Contonenta. He was one of the seven. He was one of the last too. The red man was Devil. He was the cause for the horrible carelessness of the humans. Now that he and his son are dead the world is going green again. You have restored peace to us. Devil planned to raise the Contonenta so that he could destroy the world. You have ended a war since the start of time. Your missions are over for now. Our department will close down. Goodbye!\" He shook their hands. They were escorted outside.</p> <p>D.T smiled to himself. He had set it all up. It was the only way to end the pollution and his tiresome job. He had schemed with the Devil. He had sent him to the core of the earth and he had brought back the key to open the door to the Contonenta. He had not disclosed to him the end result. Dump Thump allowed himself another gleeful grin. He merrily began to shut down the Globe through his computer. The happy days were just about to begin!</p> <p>D.T was thought to be a kangaroo aiming for world domination. The truth is that he was actually trying to save the world from the distribution of toxic waste and greenhouse gases that mingle with the earth's atmosphere. These are the tools that cause global warming. </p> <p>We must always remember that the world is the only life-bearing planet, but its resources are fast being consumed. We must be aware and try to maintain the planet. Many natural species such as trees give us oxygen. If we fell forests and set up mines, oil-rigs and other industries like these, we are draining the earth, polluting it and endangering animals and humans alike. </p> <p>All living things have a right to live, and just because we are stronger and often more intelligent, it doesn't mean that we should destroy their natural habitats to create new ones for us. If this happens to us, we would think it to be an act of robbery and crime.</p> <p>Krazy Kesh's Perspective:</p> <p>Prevent<br>Protect<br>Preserve</p> <p><strong>Are you a budding writer or poet? <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/childrens-books/2011/mar/02/how-do-i-get-involved-guardian-childrens-books\">Join the site</a> and send us your scribblings!</strong></p>",

The land ethic articulated by <a href=\"http://www.aldoleopold.org/AldoLeopold/almanac.shtml\" title=\"\">Aldo Leopold in A Sand County Almanac</a> and the visionary transport of <a href=\"http://books.google.co.uk/books/about/Pilgrim_at_Tinker_Creek.html?id=e_Na1k1CoR8C&amp;redir_esc=y\" title=\"\">Annie Dillard's Pilgrim at Tinker Creek</a> (both also essential reading) are prefigured here, as are elements of the radical, progressive and compassionate agenda of environmentalism at its best. \"We are acquainted with a mere pellicle of the globe on which we live,\" writes Thoreau, \"We know not where we are.\" Walden remains an essential companion on the journey of discovery.</p> <h2>4. <a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9780140439120\" title=\"\"><strong>On the Origin of Species by Charles Darwin</strong></a> (1859)</h2> <p>One of the masterworks of civilisation. It shows how, when sufficient pain is taken, precise observation and close reasoning can, cumulatively, lead to a revolution in our view of nature of world-historical significance. The reality into which Darwin plunges us is bracing \u2013 \"the birds which are idly singing round us mostly live on insects or seeds, and are thus constantly destroying life\" \u2013 but refreshing too.</p> <p>There's no denying that much of the Origin is a far-from-easy read \u2013 \"..as the chelae of Crustaceans resemble in some degree the avicularia of Polyzoa, both serving as pincers, it may be worth while to show that the with the former a long series of serviceable gradations still exists...\" \u2013 but it is absolutely worth the effort. (The annotated edition, edited by <a href=\"http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674060173\" title=\"\">James T Costa</a>, is a help). \"We see through the eyes of theory,\" writes the physicist <a href=\"http://193.189.74.53/~qubitor/people/david/David.html\" title=\"\">David Deutsch</a>, quoting Karl Popper.

With its fascinating illustrations of transformation and fine prose, this pioneering work is, among other things, a ringing celebration of what Pliny called Magna <em>ludentis naturae varietas</em>, \"the great variety of nature at play\", and it continues to inspire artists, scientists and nature lovers.</p> <h2>6. <a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9780007457465\" title=\"\"><strong>A Land by Jacquetta Hawkes</strong></a> (1951)</h2> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/may/11/rereading-a-land-jacquetta-hawkes\" title=\"\">Robert Macfarlane has described this book</a> in ways that cannot be bettered: \"It appears at different points to be a short history of Planet England; a geological prose-poem; a Cretaceous cosmi-comedy; a patriotic hymn of love to Terra Britannica; a neo-Romantic vision of the countryside as a vast and inadvertent work of land-art; [and] a speculative account of human identity as chthonic in origin and collective in nature \u2026 Its tonal range is vast. It possesses echoes of the saga, shades of the epic, and tassels of the New Age. It brinks at times on the bonkers \u2026 I can imagine it reperformed as a rock opera.\"</p> <h2>7. <strong>Molecular Structure of Nucleic Acids: A Structure for Deoxyribose Nucleic Acid by James Watson and Francis Crick</strong> (1953)</h2> <p>Literary types tend to be a little spooked by scientific papers. Pity. We should at least make an effort, if only as a Labrador does when, sensing that something important is going on without quite understanding what, it howls along to the sound of a piano. Watson and Crick's paper on the structure of DNA is a good place to start. This magnificent insight into the staggering beauty at the heart of life is fractionally over a page in length. Its consequences are huge but, as we increasingly appreciate thanks to the ENCODE project and more, even now we are only a few small steps towards understanding how life works. <a href=\"http://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CCcQFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Fnature%2Fdna50%2Fwatsoncrick.pdf&amp;ei=UT91UIDvJ-rR0QWht4GABw&amp;usg=AFQjCNF7s-1Cvzjp3jrfJS6rMPgV_ed9cQ&amp;sig2=psL3NMNClE_Q_TQLQBJ9Hg\" title=\"\">Download it and stick it on your wall [PDF]</a>.</p> <h2>8. <a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9780007455935\" title=\"\"><strong>The Lorax by Dr Seuss</strong></a> (1971)</h2> <p>The Gospel according to Theodore Seuss Geisel tells you all need to know: \"Unless someone like you cares a whole awful lot, nothing is going to get better.

Few if any have matched Thomas, a physician who died in 1993 leaving six collections of essays. The Lives of a Cell, dating from around the time of the first photograph of the Earth from space and the discovery that whale song consists of complex organised patterns, is among the best. \"We are not the masters of nature that we thought ourselves; we are as dependent on the rest of nature as are the leaves or midges or fish.\" And again, \"We are alive against \u2026 stupendous odds \u2026 You'd think we'd never stop dancing.\"</p> <h2>10. <a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9781860465833\" title=\"\"><strong>Arctic Dreams by Barry Lopez</strong></a><strong> </strong>(1984)</h2> <p>It's taken until the last slot to get to a book that is by most definitions \"proper nature writing\" in the sense of sustained descriptive writing about the natural world affectionately satirised by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/jun/01/william-boot-evelyn-waugh\" title=\"\">Evelyn Waugh in Scoop</a> with \"Feather-footed through the plashy fen passes the questing vole\". But Arctic Dreams: Imagination and Desire in a Northern Landscape is the real McCoy: a work of tremendous ambition that combines description of natural forms and processes in an environment that is among the bleakest and richest on Earth with profound thought on human dwelling and alienation. Arctic Dreams is all the more remarkable in that, though published less than 30 years ago, the spectre of human made climate change is absent from its pages.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9781847081728\" title=\"\">Caspar Henderson's The Book of Barely Imagined Beings</a> is published by Granta</p>",

  "<p>Jack Straw, the former foreign secretary, and Sir Mark Allen, a former senior MI6 officer, have been cited as key defendants in court documents that describe in detail abuse meted out to Libyan dissidents and their families after being abducted and handed to Muammar Gaddafi's secret police with the help of British intelligence.</p> <p>The documents accuse Straw of misleading MPs about Britain's role in the rendition of two leading dissidents \u2013 Abdel Hakim Belhaj and Sami al-Saadi \u2013 and say MI6 must have known they risked being tortured. They say British intelligence officers provided Libyan interrogators with questions to ask their captives and themselves flew to Tripoli to interview the detainees in jail.</p> <p>They recount how Belhaj was chained, hooded, and beaten; his pregnant wife, Fatima Bouchar, punched and bound; how Saadi was repeatedly assaulted; his wife, Ait Baaziz, hooded and ill-treated; and their children traumatised, as they were abducted and jailed in Libya following tip-offs by MI6 and the CIA in 2004.</p> <p>Belhaj and Saadi were leading members of the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group, which opposed Gaddafi. Belhaj became head of the Tripoli Brigade during last year's revolution and is a leading Libyan political figure. They are suing Straw, Allen, MI6, MI5, the Foreign Office, the Home Office, and the attorney general, for damages for unlawful detention, conspiracy to injure, negligence, and abuse of public office. It is believed to be the first time such action has been taken against a former British foreign secretary.</p> <p>The court documents, served by the law firm Leigh Day and the legal charity and human rights group, Reprieve, allege:</p> <p>\u2022 MI6 alerted Libyan intelligence to the whereabouts of Belhaj and his family. They were held in Malaysia and Thailand and flown to Libya in a CIA plane.</p> <p>\u2022 The CIA and MI6 co-operated in the rendition of Saadi and his family from Hong Kong to Libya via Thailand.</p> <p>\u2022 Straw and his co-defendants knew that torture was endemic in Gaddafi's Libya.</p> <p>\u2022 British intelligence officers sent detailed questions to the Libyan authorities to be used in Belhaj and Saadi's interrogations.</p> <p>\u2022 Straw did not tell the truth when he told the Commons foreign affairs committee in 2005 that Britain was not involved in any rendition operations.</p> <p>\u2022 Evidence by Sir John Scarlett, the head of MI6, to the parliamentary intelligence and security committee (ISC) in 2006 that his agency did not assist in any rendition to countries other than the US or the detainee's country of origin was incorrect and misleading. Bouchar is Moroccan, and Baaziz is Algerian, and neither had been to Libya before their abduction.</p> <p>\u2022 Evidence by an MI5 witness to the Special Immigration Appeals Commission about the renditions was untrue and misleading.</p> <p>\u2022 According to the US flight plan rendering Belhaj and his wife to Libya, the plane would refuel at the American base on the British Indian Ocean territory of Diego Garcia. If it had done so it would contradict assurances made to MPs by the former foreign secretary David Miliband. Referring to the coalition government's plans for secret courts, Khadidja al-Saadi, who was 12 when she was abducted, said: \"I tried writing to Ken Clarke [former justice secretary] about my case \u2013 I told him that having a secret court judge my kidnap was the kind of thing Gaddafi would have done.\"</p> <p>Her father said: \"After my rendition I spent years in Gaddafi's jails, and a secret 'court' sentenced me to death. Even now, after everything that happened, I hope and pray British justice will serve me better than this. My family has asked the government to apologise, and the government has refused.\"</p> <p>Cori Crider, Reprieve's legal director, said: \"The public have every right to know just how high the plot to kidnap these families went. Did it stop at Allen and Straw? Or did Tony Blair know what was going on in a torture chamber down the road while he hugged Gaddafi in a tent? You won't find the answer in Straw's book [Last Man Standing].\"</p> <p>If the justice and security \"secret courts\" bill, passes \"we will never know\", Crider added.</p> <p>The abductions took place after the Blair government embraced Gaddafi following the Libyan leader's promise in 2003 to abandon nuclear weapons. Allen developed close relations with Gaddafi's intelligence chief, Moussa Koussa, documents unearthed in Tripoli show.</p> <p>Whitehall sources say that in their dealings with Gaddafi MI6 was carrying out \"ministerially authorised government policy\" and were given assurances by the Libyans that the detainees would not be tortured. The Guardian has asked Straw about the renditions. He has said he cannot comment because of a police investigation into the affair.</p> <h2>Timeline</h2> <p><strong>18 March 2004:</strong> \"Most importantly, I congratulate you on the safe arrival of [Behaj] This was the least we could do for you and for Libya to demonstrate the remarkable relationship we have built over the years.
