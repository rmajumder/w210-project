[
  "<p>When Queen performed at the closing ceremony of&#xa0;the Olympics \u2013 Freddie Mercury, towering over the crowd in canary-yellow jacket, leading a call-and-response from beyond the grave, Brian May, crowned in his wonky halo of grey curls, squalling his way through the guitar solo from Brighton Rock, and drummer Roger Taylor, with guest Jessie J, thundering into a rendition of We Will Rock You \u2013 they did what they always managed to do so spectacularly live: unite a stadium in belting out an&#xa0;anthem.</p> <p>They \u2013 well May \u2013 also&#xa0;managed to do something new: infuriate a significant percentage of the populace. The trouble was his outfit: a characteristic combination of dark trousers, trainers and long frock coat, except from one sleeve peered the head of a fox; from the other, the black and white snout of a badger.</p> <p>\"He's politicising the Olympics!\" came the cry, from those who made the connection between his attire and his campaign against the government's then imminent approval of <a href=\"http://www.naturalengland.org.uk/about_us/news/2012/170912.aspx\" title=\"\">pilot badger culls in Gloucester</a> and Somerset. \"To the farmers struggling against bovine TB and&#xa0;fox predation,\" harrumphed the Countryside Alliance, \"a millionaire rock star using a global sporting celebration to undermine their way of life really stuck in the craw.\" A spokesperson for May said his jacket was in keeping with Danny Boyle's Isles of Wonder theme, including, as it did, a hedgehog, a buzzard, two herons and an adder, \"most of which are protected or in decline\" \u2013 which was plausible, up to a point.</p> <p>For it is true that May is on a mission. \"All the available scientific evidence points to the fact that the cull probably will not work,\" he says now, sitting in a hotel bar in Kensington. \"It will not save a single cow. It might do, but it's a huge unknown \u2013 a huge extrapolation, and extrapolation of scientific evidence is a very dangerous game.\" His voice is soft, languid in the way of someone accustomed to being listened to. \"If you talk to any expert on cows and bovine TB in Britain, bar a couple who work for Defra [Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs], you will get the same answer, including from Lord Krebs.\" Krebs led the only major scientific trial of culling, a \u00a350m study known as the randomised badger culling or Krebs trial, which culled 11,000 badgers over five years and found that if certain conditions were met, culling could reduce disease incidence by an average of just 16% over nine years. \"Krebs said culling is a crazy idea, we shouldn't be doing it, we should be vaccinating,\" adds May. \"So I'm not a lone voice. I'm not a&#xa0;renegade hippy.\"</p> <p>On Friday afternoon, <a href=\"http://epetitions.direct.gov.uk/petitions/38257\" title=\"\">a petition he has launched with Team Badger</a>, a coalition of various animal rights groups, had more than 134,000 signatures, well in excess of the 100,000 required to get a debate considered in parliament. (The coalition includes May's own anti-animal cruelty organisation, established when he realised, in 2010, that David Cameron would try to repeal the anti-hunting act. It is called, with the unapologetic sentimentality that imbues the songs he wrote for Queen, Save Me, and marked the end of his life-long support for the Tory party.)</p> <p>May is working on the campaign around the clock, talking to scientists, emailing activists, doing interviews, updating his website. \"It's threatening my life, it's utterly consuming my life. It makes it difficult to continue a proper family life, it makes it difficult to continue music, to continue astronomy, to continue my stereoscopic adventures.\" May is, famously, unusual in the rock firmament in that he possesses a PhD in&#xa0;astronomy, and has written books about it (the most recent, <a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9781847326195\" title=\"\">The Cosmic Tourist</a>, written with Patrick Moore and Chris Lintott, will be published next month) and another obsession, stereoscopy. \"So I suppose I&#xa0;solve the problem by not sleeping very much.\" He says his friends, largely, support his campaign, but that his wife, Anita Dobson \u2013 though helping with the petition, \"has at times made me question whether I should be spending this much time on it\".</p> <p>As we talk, his eye is suddenly caught by a scene behind us, and his voice hardens. \"Sorry, excuse me, are you having trouble, Anne?\" Anne is Anne Brummer, of Harper Asprey Wildlife Rescue Centre in Surrey, who has rescued thousands of animals over the past 25 years and has released many of them on to his land. A waiter has been trying to explain to Anne that the bar is not yet open. \"Who says? Can we talk to your manager please?\" The gentle tone is suddenly gone; in its place is the full force of rock star high-handedness.</p> <p>He turns back to me. \"Sorry, I hate people who say things can't be done.\" His tone is avuncular again, expansive. \"It must be in my upbringing.\" In what way? \"Well, my parents thought we were middle class\" \u2013 his father, who when May was a teenager helped him build the guitar he still uses out of motorbike valve springs, a mahogany fireplace, a bike saddle, and mother-of-pearl buttons from his mother's button box, was an electronics draughtsman in the civil service \u2013 \"but we were very poor. They had a pride in doing things well. Life is too short for people who don't want to do their job well.\"</p> <p>Speaking of jobs, it's understandable, isn't it, if farmers feel that it is all very well for someone in a comfortable position \u2026 \"I'm not in a comfortable position,\" interjects May. \"This is killing me!\" I look for a trace of irony, but it doesn't appear to be there. \"Yeah, yeah, yeah. Rock stars shouldn't have anything to say about farming. Well, sorry, it's time to wake up. Farming, like every other industry, including mine, has to be open to change or it dies. \u2026 [And] if the price of my glass of milk on the table, or my cheese is the death of possibly hundreds of thousands of badgers, I don't want it. I like me milk, I&#xa0;like me cheese, but the day the first shot is fired by the government against the badgers, I will never drink another drop of milk unless I know it's come from a humane farm.\"</p> <p>But that, as even some anti-cull activists admit, is just punishing farmers further. \"No, it's not. It's giving people the right to choose who to support.\"</p> <p>What is it about him and animals, exactly? Where does this passion come from? \"It's a childhood thing, but it's been reinforced by the life I've led. I'm an astronomer.\" Even when he was touring the world with Queen, May kept up with the academic journals. He has an asteroid named after him, has spent months chasing eclipses from Mexico to Outer Mongolia, and periodically appears on the Sky at Night with his friend Patrick Moore. \"For a thousand years the Ptolemaic system was believed all round the world. The system says that the Earth is at the centre of the universe. It turns out not to be true. But this idea that we are the centre of creation lingers on \u2013 where is the justification to say we are the central piece of evolution? There is nothing to tell us that whatsoever. So why would we use that to justify our exceedingly bad behaviour?\"</p> <p>In fact, he said, a couple of years ago, that he would rather be remembered for his animal rights work than for music or astronomy. Really? \"Yep. I won't be remembered in 1,000 years anyway, but I would like to leave this planet knowing that I did what I could to make it a better place, a more decent place, a more compassionate place.\"</p> <p>Having said which, he doesn't seem to find this campaigning lark that fulfilling. \"People say: 'Are&#xa0;you enjoying it?' No. I love my music, I love my art. And I'm quite good at it.\" Rolling Stone last year ranked him as 26th of the 100 best guitarists of all time. \"So really I should be making music \u2013 I <em>have</em> to have time \u2013 because if I lose music from my life, I lose my self.\"</p> <p>He is about to embark on a short tour with Kelly Ellis, accompanying her on&#xa0;acoustic guitar and performing by candlelight. \"It's almost like a reaction to the music that made Queen famous, though if you look at it some of it's very simple. We Will Rock You is very simple. Millionaire Waltz is highly complex.\"</p> <p>It is perhaps instructive \u2013 or maybe not \u2013 that May wrote We Will Rock You, while Freddie Mercury wrote The Millionaire Waltz: for all his obvious intelligence, there is something of the emotional bludgeon about May and his&#xa0;lyrics: they are obviously wildly effective \u2013 in 2006, Queen's Greatest Hits became the best-selling album ever \u2013 but relatively uncomplicated (unlike his guitar solos): We Will Rock You. The Show Must Go On. I Want It All.</p> <p>Musically, he and Mercury dovetailed brilliantly, but did he ever feel overshadowed and resentful of his flamboyantly gifted frontman? \"No, we actually pushed him forward. It was me who designed that first cover and put him on [it]. That was my vision of what Queen's image would be. Because Freddie was born to it. Though he was very democratic. People often said, in interviews, 'This is your band' \u2013 and he'd say, 'Don't be stupid, darling.'\" May's voice alters subtly, suddenly there's another person in the room. \"This is a&#xa0;<em>band</em>.\"</p> <p>What was it like, performing with Mercury again, albeit in the form of a&#xa0;hologram? \"It was nice. I mean, Freddie's with us the whole time, really. Freddie's spirit is very strong and we spent so much of our lives together, I&#xa0;can't imagine a day where I wouldn't refer to him in some way. I'm very comfortable with that now. I wasn't in the beginning.\" In fact, he was so grief-stricken by the loss of his friend and colleague, which came at about the same time as the breakup of his first marriage and the death of his father, that he slipped into a severe depression. \"It was quite a long grieving process, but I'm comfortable with it now. He lived life to the full, he created magnificently, from his soul. He was fearless.\"</p> <p>During another period of depression, a suicidal episode, May went to a clinic in Arizona. \"They said, 'What is your religion, what is your spirituality?' I said: 'I'm not sure.' And they said: 'Well, we need your spirituality to be a centre for your recovery. And I kind of floundered around for a while and in the end it was looking at the stars that gave that feeling back to me.</p> <p>\"There's a great thing called The Serenity Prayer,\" he says. \"It's taught in all kinds of clinics \u2013 it starts off with the word God, but you can say Higher Power \u2013 'God, give me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, the courage to change the things I can, and the wisdom to know the difference.'\"</p> <p>He delivers the homily as if it is not cross-stitched and stuck up on wall after wall throughout the world. \"To me that's incredibly empowering and very often if I get to a sort of trough, that's what I look at. It focuses you on the things which you can change.\" And he stands up to his full 6ft 2in, plus a good five inches or so of hair, and wanders off to be photographed. From the lapel of his frock coat, a badger winks.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 3 October 2012.

In a similar way, shtupping Skrillex may have made this singer tougher. Anything Could Happen sounds like an Ellie Goulding track, but it's an Ellie Goulding track that talks about \"supersets\" and has six chicken breasts and a protein shake for lunch. Her lyrics are more assertive, too: \"I'll give you everything you need,\" Ellie trills, \"But I don't think I need you!\" For once, she doesn't sing it like she's swallowed a butterfly, either.</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gn_7roOj07k\" title=\"\"><strong>David Guetta Feat Sia</strong></a><strong> </strong><br><strong>She Wolf (Falling To Pieces) (EMI France)</strong></h2> <p><strong> </strong></p> <p>The slow bits on this track are David Guetta doing emo.

Rubbish. Without wrinkling my forehead, I can think of three places this song fits like feet in slippers. One, in a smug vegan coffee shop where asking for \"milk from an animal\" is a faux pas. Two, soundtracking a Natalie Portman romcom, but a low-budget one, where she doesn't pluck her eyebrows. Three, on Stella McCartney's next perfume advert.

  "<p>It was the world's worst offshore oil spill: <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/bp-oil-spill\" title=\"\">5m barrels spewing from the BP-run Deepwater Horizon rig into the Gulf of Mexico</a>, killing 11 people, marine life and devastating hundreds of miles of coastline. From a Cessna floatplane 3,000ft above the Louisiana coastline, photographer Daniel Beltr\u00e1 captured the carnage. It was only from this height, he said, that the magnitude of the spill \u2013 and the futility of the clean-up operation \u2013 became apparent. \"It was like trying to clean an Olympic pool full of oil while sitting on the side using Q-tips.\"</p> <p>An environmental specialist who often works for Greenpeace, Beltr\u00e1 prefers aerial photography, because it offers a humbling perspective, shrinking the scale of the planet to more human proportions and thereby revealing its fragility. This lofty viewpoint often shows the beauty of the natural world: in the case of a&nbsp;disaster, though, that can be unsettling. Here, the surface of the ocean is marbled with spectacular, iridescent blue and flashes of orange that resemble molten rock, and the rig, at first glance, might be a Hindu temple.</p> <p>In the two years since the wellhead was sealed, the fallout has continued.

  "<p>It wasn't so long ago that goat's cheese had a rather hippyish image, while fresh&#xa0;goat's milk was almost&#xa0;impossible to get hold of. But now all things&#xa0;goaty have gone mainstream. Far from being the preserve of specialist healthfood shops, goat's milk and all its related products are flowing into supermarkets in an ever-increasing stream \u2013 you can buy goat's yoghurt, goat's butter, even goat's ice-cream. And very delicious they can be, too. We have a&#xa0;lot to thank our nannies for.</p> <p>But as the caprine dairy industry has flourished, so has its dubious back story. For a start \u2013 and belying the gentle, wholesome image of goat's cheese and milk \u2013 most of our&#xa0;dairy goats are raised in zero-grazing systems, which means they're kept indoors without being&#xa0;able to graze or browse outside. In fact, commercially farmed dairy goats are far less likely to be allowed outside than dairy cows. So, choosing goat dairy products is not, in itself, a way of supporting more ethical farming. To&#xa0;do that, you have to look for organic goat's milk products, or a&#xa0;producer whose herd is free-range.</p> <p>In addition to these welfare issues is the problem of the billies. For a&#xa0;nanny goat to lactate, she must produce kids. Female young are useful, of course \u2013 they become the next batch of milking goats \u2013 but&#xa0;the billies are simply a&#xa0;by-product. The dairy industry has&#xa0;no use for them, in the same way that bovine dairy farmers don't need&#xa0;male calves, and most are killed within a few days of birth and the carcasses destroyed. I&#xa0;don't see this necessarily as a welfare issue \u2013 the humane slaughter of a very young goat is no more or less \"cruel\" than that of an adult \u2013 but it is a&#xa0;massive waste issue. And waste really gets my goat.</p> <p>There are a couple of valid consumer responses to this. You can, of course, eschew the products&#xa0;of the dairy industry altogether, but if, like me, you're prepared to accept the farming of animals for food, you can cast a&#xa0;positive vote for a more holistic approach to goat farming.</p> <p>There's been a renaissance of our&#xa0;veal industry, as many people have woken up to the fact that eating male calves \u2013 provided they've been raised in a high-welfare&#xa0;system \u2013 is a&#xa0;saner option than having them slaughtered and incinerated. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2012/may/30/should-eat-more-goat-meat\" title=\"\">Exactly the same thing&#xa0;can be said of billy goats</a> \u2013 why&#xa0;destroy these animals when a&#xa0;few months of roaming about outside turns them into tender, toothsome meat?</p> <p>Goat is often thought of as tough, pungent and best for long-cooked curries. That may be true of the flesh from mature beasts, but the meat of&#xa0;a young animal \u2013 a kid goat that's&#xa0;been milk-fed and then given&#xa0;access to outdoor grazing for&#xa0;a&#xa0;couple of months \u2013 is amazingly yielding and mild. Near&#xa0;me on the Devon/Dorset border, James Whetlor, an enterprising chef (and, as it happens, a former River Cottage colleague), has been championing this cause. With his partner, Jack Jennings, he has set up <a href=\"http://www.CabritoGoatMeat.co.uk\" title=\"\">Cabrito</a>, raising billies from local dairy herds of toggenburg, saanen and anglo-nubian goats, then selling their meat.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.cabritogoatmeat.co.uk/our-clients.shtml\" title=\"\">The restaurants James supplies</a> always come back for more, and I'm not surprised. It's good stuff. It's a&#xa0;bit of a cop-out to describe the flavour of goat as \"a bit like lamb\", but it does have a similar savour. It's leaner, though, and a bit more herby. Kid needs no more cooking than lamb, and is hugely versatile: it goes with everything from green beans, tomatoes and herbs (especially thyme) to the sweet-spicy flavours of curries and tagines.</p> <p>Of course I don't want you to take my word for it, hence this week's recipes, but for most of you, buying the key ingredient will not be a&#xa0;matter of nipping down to the local shops. While goat and kid are easy to source on the internet, much of it comes from animals specifically raised for meat (often from the boer breed), which does nothing to address wastage in the dairy industry.</p> <p>What I'd like to see is one of our big supermarkets starting to stock free-range, dairy goat meat \u2013 high-welfare \"goat veal\", if you like \u2013 in the same way that some now sell British rose veal. UK supermarkets rake in decent profits from the goat's&#xa0;cheese, butter and milk they sell. It would be good to see them taking responsibility for all the animals involved in its production.</p> <h2>Kid chops with tomatoes and olives</h2> <p>A lovely way to enjoy tender young kid chops \u2013 I usually use the small chops or cutlets from the front of the animal, but use larger chump chops if you prefer. Serves four.</p> <p><strong>400-500g cherry tomatoes</strong><br><strong>100g good black olives, stoned and roughly chopped</strong><br><strong>1 tsp fresh rosemary, chopped</strong><br><strong>3 tbsp olive oil</strong><br><strong>8-12 kid chops, depending on size</strong><br><strong>Sea salt and freshly ground black&#xa0;pepper</strong></p> <p>Start with the tomatoes: cut them into eighths (or, if using large tomatoes, into similarly small pieces). Combine with the chopped olives, rosemary and oil, and season to taste. Cover and set aside.</p> <p>Preheat the grill to medium-high. Season the chops all over and place under the hot grill. I start by propping them on their sides with the fat side uppermost, to crisp it up for a&#xa0;couple of minutes, before placing the chops flat. After crisping the edges, cook them for three to six minutes on each side, or until done to your liking \u2013 but don't overdo it: they are best when still a little pink. Leave to rest in a warm place for five minutes.</p> <p>Serve with the tomatoes and olives, a green salad and bread, or perhaps some waxy little potatoes.</p> <h2>Goat tagine with almonds and apricots</h2> <p>Goat lends itself wonderfully to rich spicing and punchy aromatics, as this North African-inspired dish demonstrates. It's particularly good if made ahead of time and reheated a day or two later. Serves six.</p> <p><strong>1 tsp cumin seeds</strong><br><strong>1 tsp coriander seeds</strong><br><strong>2 cloves</strong><br><strong>12 black peppercorns</strong><br><strong>2-3 tbsp olive, rapeseed or sunflower&#xa0;oil</strong><br><strong>1kg trimmed shoulder of kid or goat,&#xa0;cut into large chunks around 5cm square</strong><br><strong>2 onions, peeled and chopped</strong><br><strong>\u00bd a cinnamon stick</strong><br><strong>2 cloves garlic, peeled and grated or&#xa0;finely chopped</strong><br><strong>1 thumb-sized piece fresh ginger, peeled and grated or finely chopped</strong><br><strong>1 tsp hot, smoked paprika</strong><br><strong>1 tin plum tomatoes, crushed with&#xa0;your hands (remove and discard any white stalky bits)</strong><br><strong>250g unsulphured dried&#xa0;apricots</strong><br><strong>100g whole, blanched almonds</strong><br><strong>1 small bunch fresh coriander, picked and chopped</strong><br><strong>Sea salt and freshly ground black&#xa0;pepper</strong></p> <p>Heat a large frying pan over a&#xa0;medium heat, add the cumin and&#xa0;coriander seeds, the cloves and&#xa0;peppercorns, and toast lightly for a few minutes, stirring often so they don't burn. Transfer to a&#xa0;pestle&#xa0;and mortar.</p> <p>Heat a tablespoon of oil in the same frying pan, add half the meat and brown all over. Transfer to a dish and repeat with the remaining meat, adding more oil to the pan if need be.</p> <p>Heat a tablespoon of oil in a large saucepan or casserole over medium-low heat. Add the onion and fry gently for 10 minutes or so, until tender. Pound the toasted spices to a powder, add them to the onions with the cinnamon, garlic, ginger, paprika and some salt, and cook for a couple of minutes more. Add the browned meat to the pot and any juices that have seeped from it.</p> <p>Deglaze the frying pan with a glass&#xa0;of water, letting it bubble while you scrape up the caramelised bits from the base of the pan, and add all this to the meat pot. Tip in the crushed tomatoes, and pour in enough water just to cover the meat. Bring to a simmer, than half-cover with the lid and cook at a very low, trembling simmer for 45 minutes if using kid meat, an hour to 75 minutes if using goat. Add the apricots and almonds, and cook for a further 45 minutes, or&#xa0;until the meat is tender. Taste and add more salt and pepper as required. Stir in the coriander, leave to stand for 15-20 minutes, and serve with couscous, rice or flatbreads.</p> <h2>Leg of kid baked in hay</h2> <p>The sweet scent of hay is a lovely way to perfume kid meat, and the grass also helps keep the meat very moist. If you don't know a&#xa0;friendly farmer, buy small packs of hay from a pet shop. Serves four to six.</p> <p><strong>Several large handfuls of clean, sweet-smelling hay</strong><br><strong>1 leg of kid, around 1.2kg</strong><br><strong>100g soft, unsalted butter</strong><br><strong>1-2 cloves garlic, peeled and crushed</strong><br><strong>1-2 tbsp chopped rosemary</strong><br><strong>Sea salt and freshly ground black&#xa0;pepper</strong></p> <p>Put the hay in a large bowl or clean bucket, soak it in cold water for 20 minutes or so, then drain.</p> <p>Heat the oven to 220C/gas mark 7. In a small bowl, combine the soft butter with the garlic, rosemary and&#xa0;some salt and&#xa0;pepper.</p> <p>Now take a large roasting dish into which the kid leg will fit and line the base of it with two-thirds of&#xa0;the hay. Smear the flavoured butter all over the leg and place it on&#xa0;top of the hay.&#xa0;Lay the remaining hay on top of&#xa0;the joint, then pack it around the&#xa0;meat (bring some up from the sides of the dish), so that the entire leg is&#xa0;encased in a roughly even layer of hay. Cover the dish with a close-fitting lid, or cover tightly with foil.</p> <p>Roast for an hour and a half, remove from the oven, leave to rest for 20 minutes, then uncover. Carefully scrape away the hay, and the meat is ready to carve.</p> <p><strong>\u2022 For the latest news from River Cottage HQ, go to </strong><a href=\"http://www.rivercottage.net\" title=\"\"><strong>rivercottage.net</strong></a></p> <p>Hugh's new book, Three Good Things, is published by Bloomsbury at \u00a325.

  "<p>What an astonishing place <a href=\"http://www.thewappingproject.com/\" title=\"\">the Wapping Project</a> gallery is. This hulking Victorian brick building, a&#xa0;former hydraulic power station, squats in its neglected, scrubby grounds like the setting for a&#xa0;particularly gothic melodrama. Inside, its restaurant is even lovelier, if your tastes run to the monolithic and vaguely ruined. The combination of concrete, soaring ceilings and cracked tiles with iconic modernist furniture can render even the jaded restaurant-goer temporarily speechless. Vast hooks on chains dangle from the ceiling. And, in the evening, abandoned machinery, its peeling paint mottled with rust, twinkles with candles, a bit like&#xa0;draping Godzilla in fairylights.</p> <p>OK, I'm gushing. But I'm a huge fan of Wapping Food and its creator, the clever and slightly scary theatre director and curator <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2001/jan/20/features.jobsmoney18\" title=\"\">Jules Wright</a>. So much so \u2013 full disclosure \u2013 that this is where I had my wedding party. Wright is given to tinkering with her giant baby \u2013 furniture might change overnight, or it might sprout a book-stuffed greenhouse \u2013 but the open kitchen has been remarkably consistent, run for several years by the talented Cameron Emirali. His departure earlier this year \u2013 to run his own place, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2012/feb/26/jay-rayner-restaurant-greek-street\" title=\"\">10 Greek Street</a> \u2013 left a hole as niggling as a missing tooth.</p> <p>So I'm here to check out new chef Matthew Young, his CV a mix of London names-to-drop (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2012/aug/19/margot-henderson-rochelle-canteen-interview\" title=\"\">Rochelle Canteen</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2003/nov/15/restaurants.restaurants\" title=\"\">Anchor &amp; Hope</a>) and New York big-hitters (<a href=\"http://elevenmadisonpark.com/\" title=\"\">Eleven Madison Park</a>, <a href=\"http://ilbuco.com/\" title=\"\">Il Buco</a>). It looks as if he might be a bit of a star turn. His menus zip along without waffling, but are lively with curiosities: coco beans, za'tar, cow's curd. They're not just there for effect: he knows what he's doing.</p> <p>With the exception of an assembly of lardo with black figs and rocket \u2013 fine ingredients, but nothing to bind or cohere \u2013 every dish we try is as exhilarating as the setting. Young uses n'duja to add musky heat to plump palourde clams with octopus;&#xa0;and sumac to deliver a hit of refreshing sourness to a slab of cod, its Basque-style pil-pil sauce daringly slicked with dill oil.</p> <p>Duck \"two ways\", a familiar combo of crisp confit leg and ruby-rare slab of breast, comes with a dense puree of carrot and hazelnut, ripe and autumnal. I do wish chefs would stop that trick of dragging the spoon through the sauce (though it's still preferable to my other plate-dressing bete noir, the \"skidmark\").</p> <p>The killer dish is a starter of tempura borage, the lemon-scented leaf battered and fried with the lightest of hands. The crunch of herb paired with clean-tasting, sweet white crabmeat, the thick creaminess of labneh and fleeting impression of liquorice from fennel fronds is one of my mouthfuls of the year.</p> <p>Truthfully, if Young's cooking hadn't been up to snuff, I wouldn't have written about it: yep, I love Wapping Food that much. But he's a&#xa0;worthy successor to Emirali, sharing his willingness to let ingredients tell their own story, but happy to give it a bit of playfulness. He has an instinct for things that wind up being more than the sum of their parts: I'm still dreaming about a&#xa0;limpid chicken broth, its savoury depths intensified by mushrooms and nubbly wheat grains with the genius addition of wafer-thin foie gras on top. It's a&#xa0;murky rockpool of gorgeousness. And there's something to be said for a&#xa0;restaurant that invites you to lie in&#xa0;an asylum-style metal bed in disturbing gloom, 3D glasses on, watching a writhing, naked woman projected on to the ceiling by way of&#xa0;post-prandial entertainment.</p> <p>Wapping Food is never going to be&#xa0;everyone's cup of matcha: too cerebral and uncompromising. Even&#xa0;the wine list refuses to countenance anything that doesn't come from Wright's native Australia, but it's rammed with well-priced dazzlers, so who's complaining? Its cool, arty constituency would never dream of anything as cheesy as going down on one knee, but I think it shimmers with edgy romance.

  "<p>More a literary gumshoe detective than a conventional biographer, <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/bios/tom_reiss/search?contributorName=Tom+Reiss\" title=\"\">Tom Reiss </a>has written the last of a trilogy of enthralling biographies. His first book was <em>F\u00fchrer Ex</em>, co-written with a young East German, Ingo Hesselbach, who was involved in the neo-Nazi \"scene\" before repenting and shopping his erstwhile comrades. As a Jewish outsider, Reiss was well-placed to tell this story, as he was for his next book <em>The Orientalist</em>, the fascinating<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lev_Nussimbaum\" title=\"\"> tale of Lev Nussimbaum</a>, aka Kurban Said, a Jewish Azeri writer and wheeler-dealer who assumed the identity of a Muslim in Hitler's reich and Mussolini's Italy.</p> <p>Now he tells a long-hidden story that sheds light on racism and the damage it does. And, although this time his research was conducted chiefly in rural France, it had its share of thrills. Reiss persuaded a French small-town official to blow open a municipal library's safe when the librarian \u2013 the only person knowing the combination \u2013 suddenly died.</p> <p><em>The Black Count</em> is a study of a hitherto obscure historical figure, General Alexandre (Alex) Dumas \u2013 not the famous Alexandre Dumas p\u00e8re, author of <em>The Three Musketeers</em> and <em>The Count of Monte Cristo</em>, nor the novelist's playwright son, who wrote<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lady_of_the_Camellias\" title=\"\"> the classic <em>La dame aux cam\u00e9lias</em></a>. Reiss's subject is the first Alexandre Dumas, who proves to have had a stranger life than many portrayed in his son's and grandson's fictions.</p> <p>Dumas was born in 1762 in the French Caribbean colony of Saint-Domingue (modern Haiti). It was not an auspicious start. Dumas was a \"<em>batarde</em>\" - the product of a relationship between his aristocratic French father, Marquis Alexandre Davy de la Pailleterie, and a freed slave, Marie-Cesette Dumas. (Her surname, meaning \"of the farm\", was bestowed on her because managing a sugar plantation was her occupation as a freewoman.) Reiss is excellent on the colonial attitudes to race exemplified by Alex's father, who, after Marie-Cesette died when the boy was 12, though proud of his strapping son, sold him into slavery to pay for his passage back to Normandy. After six months of Alex's servitude, the marquis purchased his freedom and duly shipped him to France, to commence an education befitting a gentleman.</p> <p>Alex proved adept at the skills expected of a young French aristocrat: especially fencing and horsemanship. His father remarried, however, and, possibly ashamed of his mulatto son, cut Alex off without a centime. Undaunted, the young man joined the army. During the French revolution he fought alongside other black men in a unit called the African Legion.</p> <p>Dumas's military abilities were quickly recognised and he rose through the ranks from corporal to general in a little over two years, commanding a division of 53,000 soldiers when he was just 30. He fought in the many wars waged against revolutionary France and captured a key fortress in the Alps from the Austrians, who dubbed him <em>Der schwarze Teufel</em> (the \"Black Devil\") after he scaled an ice-covered rock wall in boots he had fitted with crampons. He was also noted for showing unusual moderation in the savage civil war against Catholic royalists in the Vend\u00e9e. By the time Napoleon Bonaparte had emerged as the strong man from the chaos of revolution, Dumas was a dangerous rival.</p> <p>Napoleon took Dumas on his disastrous Egyptian campaign as his cavalry commander, where the two generals fell out and Dumas quit his command. When he was shipwrecked off Italy en route home from Egypt, he was imprisoned by the Bourbon king, Ferdinand I of Naples and Sicily. Reiss suggests that it was deliberate foot-dragging by a spiteful and jealous Napoleon that delayed his rival's release. Ferdinand attempted to&#xa0;poison&#xa0;Dumas with arsenic and by the time he was finally freed, the man who could reputedly lift his own horse off the ground was a half-blind, half-deaf wreck. Dumas went back to the small town of Villers-Cotter\u00eats where he had met his devoted wife Marie-Louise, and fathered the future&#xa0;novelist.</p> <p>The France to which Dumas returned was utterly changed. Napoleon's military autocracy had extinguished the last sparks of revolutionary zeal. In the most poignant change of all Napoleon reintroduced slavery in Dumas's native&#xa0;Haiti, and crushed the republic of former slaves established by the Haitian hero <a href=\"http://www.historywiz.com/toussaint.htm\" title=\"\">Toussaint L'Ouverture</a>. This even though Napoleon's first wife,&#xa0;Jos\u00e9phine, was a West Indian Creole, from Martinique. (Earlier, Dumas had refused to command the expedition France sent against L'Ouverture, who ended his days in a&#xa0;Napoleonic jail.)</p> <p>The story of Dumas's imprisonment&#xa0;and death in 1806 from stomach&#xa0;cancer exacerbated by arsenic&#xa0;(the same disease that would kill Napoleon) was told in <em>The Count of Monte Cristo</em>. Reiss has written a swashbuckling tale of his own.</p> <p>Nigel Jones's <em>Tower: An Epic History of the Tower&#xa0;of&#xa0;London</em> is published by Hutchinson.</p>",
  "<p>The department of homeland security has agreed to consider same-sex partners as being in a \"family relationship\" during immigration proceedings, in a move that may spare undocumented immigrants in long-term partnerships with US citizens the grief of forced separation.</p> <p>The concession, enshrined in writing in a letter from the DHS secretary, Janet Napolitano, softens one of the most bitterly resented aspects of the Defence of Marriage Act (DOMA), the 1996 federal law that defines marriage as the union of a man and woman. Under DOMA, immigration rights that are extended to bi-national heterosexual couples are not similarly offered to gays and lesbians.</p> <p>\"One of the most painful aspects of the Defence of Marriage Act is when couples are separated. So we are happy to see the DHS acting on this,\" said Victoria Neilson, legal director of Immigration Equality, a group that advocates for changes in US immigration laws relating to the LGBT community.</p> <p>Napolitano's letter is the latest move by the Obama administration to use its procedural powers to ameliorate some of the harshest aspects of immigration law without having to face political opposition in Congress. In June the administration allowed young undocumented immigrants who had come to the US as children and were in education to apply for a deferral of any threat of deportation for two years. More than 80,000 people have applied for deferred action so far.</p> <p>The procedural shift on deportations of gay partners is much smaller in its likely reach. It is estimated that there are about 24,000 gay and lesbian couples in the US where one partner is a national of another country, though how many of those are without immigration authorisation is not known.</p> <p>The DHS has been saying for more than a year that it wanted to focus its resources on priority cases for deportation, such as those with criminal records. It has made clear that it would treat favourably anyone with strong family or community ties in the US, though until now it left the status of gay relationships unclear.</p> <p>Napolitano's letter removes the ambiguity. She writes that guidance will now be sent to all immigration officers in the field, to clarify for them that \"family relationships includes long-term, same-sex partners\".</p> <p>The DHS secretary has been coming under mounting pressure to do something about the status of gay couples facing immigration problems. In July, a group of 84 members of Congress wrote to her, asking her to put into writing the equal position of gay couples in terms of deportation proceedings.</p> <p>One of the authors, Michael Honda of California, told NBC News: \"No one should have to choose between their spouse and their country, and no family should be left out of the immigration system.\"</p> <p>Immigration Equality has tried to persuade the DHS to grant what would in effect be temporary visas to undocumented immigrants. DOMA prohibits LGBT partners of American citizens from applying for green cards that would grant them resident status.</p> <p>Under the Immigration Equality proposal, people could apply for the cards and their applications would then be put on hold, pending the repeal of DOMA which the Obama administration has indicated it supports. While their applications were on hold they would be granted temporary permission to stay in the country, although they would not have the right to work.</p> <p>The DHS, however, has indicated that it is not likely to implement such a proposal.</p>",
  "<p>Greece's far-right Golden Dawn party is increasingly assuming the role of law enforcement officers on the streets of the bankrupt country, with mounting evidence that Athenians are being openly directed by police to seek help from the neo-Nazi group, analysts, activists and lawyers say.</p> <p>In return, a growing number of Greek crime victims have come to see the party, whose symbol bears an uncanny resemblance to the swastika, as a \"protector\".</p> <p>One victim of crime, an eloquent US-trained civil servant, told the Guardian of her family's shock at being referred to the party when her mother recently called the police following an incident involving Albanian immigrants in their downtown apartment block.</p> <p>\"They immediately said if it's an issue with immigrants go to Golden Dawn,\" said the 38-year-old, who fearing for her job and safety, spoke only on condition of anonymity. \"We don't condone Golden Dawn but there is an acute social problem that has come with the breakdown of feeling of security among lower and middle class people in the urban centre,\" she said. \"If the police and official mechanism can't deliver and there is no recourse to justice, then you have to turn to other maverick solutions.\"</p> <p>Other Greeks with similar experiences said the far-rightists, catapulted into parliament on a ticket of tackling \"immigrant scum\" were simply doing the job of a defunct state that had left a growing number feeling overwhelmed by a \"sense of powerlessness\". \"Nature hates vacuums and Golden Dawn is just filling a vacuum that no other party is addressing,\" one woman lamented. \"It gives 'little people' a sense that they can survive, that they are safe in their own homes.\"</p> <p>Far from being tamed, parliamentary legitimacy appears only to have emboldened the extremists. In recent weeks racially-motivated attacks have proliferated. Immigrants have spoken of their fear of roaming the streets at night following a spate of attacks by black-clad men on motorbikes. Street vendors from Africa and Asia have also been targeted.</p> <p>\"For a lot of people in poorer neighbourhoods we are liberators,\" crowed Yiannis Lagos, one of 18 MPs from the stridently patriot \"popular nationalist movement\" to enter the 300-seat house in June. \"The state does nothing,\" he told a TV chat show, adding that Golden Dawn was the only party that was helping Greeks, hit by record levels of poverty and unemployment, on the ground. Through an expansive social outreach programme, which also includes providing services to the elderly in crime-ridden areas, the group regularly distributes food and clothes parcels to the needy.</p> <p>But the hand-outs come at a price: allegiance to Golden Dawn. \"A friend who was being seriously harassed by her husband and was referred to the party by the police very soon found herself giving it clothes and food in return,\" said a Greek teacher, who, citing the worsening environment enveloping the country, again spoke only on condition of anonymity. \"She's a liberal and certainly no racist and is disgusted by what she has had to do.\"</p> <p>The strategy, however, appears to be paying off. On the back of widespread anger over biting austerity measures that have also hit the poorest hardest, the popularity of the far-rightists has grown dramatically with polls indicating a surge in support for the party.</p> <p>One survey last week showed a near doubling in the number of people voicing \"positive opinions\" about Golden Dawn, up from 12% in May to 22%. The popularity of Nikos Michaloliakos, the party's rabble-rousing leader had shot up by 8 points, much more than any other party leader.</p> <p>Paschos Mandravelis, a prominent political analyst, attributed the rise in part to the symbiotic relationship between the police and Golden Dawn. \"Greeks haven't turned extremist overnight. A lot of the party's backing comes from the police, young recruits who are a-political and know nothing about the Nazis or Hitler,\" he said. \"For them, Golden Dawn supporters are their only allies on the frontline when there are clashes between riot police and leftists.\"</p> <p>Riding the wave, the party has taken steps to set up branches among diaspora Greek communities abroad, opening an office in New York last week. Others are expected to open in Australia and Canada. Cadres say they are seeing particular momentum in support from women.</p> <p>With Greeks becoming ever more radicalised, the conservative-led government has also clamped down on illegal immigration, detaining thousands in camps and increasing patrols along the country's land and sea frontier with Turkey.</p> <p>But in an environment of ever increasing hate speech and mounting tensions, the party's heavy-handedness is also causing divisions. A threat by Golden Dawn to conduct raids against vendors attending an annual fair in the town of Arta this weekend has caused uproar.</p> <p>\"They say they have received complaints about immigrant vendors from shop owners here but that is simply untrue,\" said socialist mayor Yiannis Papalexis. \"Extra police have been sent down from Athens and if they come they will be met by leftists who have said they will beat them up with clubs. I worry for the stability of my country.\"</p> <p>Seated in her office beneath the Acropolis, Anna Diamantopoulou, a former EU commissioner, shakes her head in disbelief. Despair, she says, has brought Greece to a dangerous place.</p> <p>\"I never imagined that something like Golden Dawn would happen here, that Greeks could vote for such people,\" she sighed. \"This policy they have of giving food only to the Greeks and blood only to the Greeks. The whole package is terrifying. This is a party based on hate of 'the other'. Now 'the other' is immigrants, but who will 'the other' be tomorrow?\"</p>",
  "<p>Originally released on PC back in 1997, The Last Express was one of the true classic point-and-click adventure titles, plunging gamers into an intriguing tale of death an conspiracy aboard the Orient Express. Set in the final days before the First World War, the game features a unique real-time clock, which gives the player a set period within which to solve the mystery. Meanwhile, the large cast of secondary characters all have their own agendas, moving around the train as the plot progresses.</p> <p>Critically acclaimed at the time, the game has now been scrupulously updated for iPhone and iPad, with original creator<a href=\"http://jordanmechner.com\"> Jordan Mechner</a> overseeing the process alongside French developer, DotEmu. We spoke to Mechner, who also created the hit Prince of Persia series, about the game and the challenge of updating it for a whole new generation.<br></p> <p><strong>Can you tell us how you originally came up with the idea of the Last Express? There seem to be lots of literary elements in it including Agatha Christie of course, but also spy novels and Hitchcock movies...</strong> <br>A man on the run, accused of a crime he didn't commit, stuck on a train with no escape... yes indeed, Last Express owes a huge debt to adventure thrillers like Graham Greene's The Third Man, Hitchcock's The Lady Vanishes and North By Northwest, with a bit of The Maltese Falcom, and even Indiana Jones. Basically, if you're going to steal, steal from the best. </p> <p>The higher-brow ingredients, like Rebecca West, Russian fairy tales, and Yeats poetry, got stirred into the soup thanks to my late co-writer Tomi Pierce, who is the best-read person I've ever known.</p> <p>Also, a train is an ideal setting for an adventure game because it's a confined space, but it's moving. You've got to do such-and-such before the train stops in Munich, or you're dead. And this may be heresy, but I personally find Murder on the Orient Express the most boring train movie ever filmed, because the train is stopped dead for two hours. Cinematically, we'd much rather be accused of stealing from Hitchcock than from Christie.</p> <p><strong>The game looked beautiful - I loved the rather stately visual design, which sort of had elements of Toulouse-Lautrec but also Bande dessin\u00e9e comics. And the character animation was done using rotoscoping wasn't it? What do you remember about the process? </strong><br>We wanted to achieve the effect of a pen-and-ink drawing come to life. As a player, I've always felt that the moment you see full-motion video of actors in a game, it kills the illusion of interactivity. It's easier to suspend your disbelief when you're playing a cartoon. </p> <p>And yes, we were inspired by the Art Nouveau style that was popular in the era of our game: Toulouse-Lautrec, Alphonse Mucha... So we rotoscoped it. We did a three-week live-action, blue-screen film shoot in San Francisco, with over sixty actors, a small child and a large dog \u2013 and costumes, makeup and crazy wigs specially designed to be rotoscope-friendly. We also had a separate film shoot with miniature model trains. We shot on 16mm film and spent two years digitally rotoscoping the footage to create over 40,000 inked and coloured frames of animation, using a semi-automated process which we developed in-house and patented. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396876794\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/28/1348856913503/express1.jpg\" alt=\"Last Express\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong>And all the time, in the background, the game plays out to this beautiful soundtrack. How did that come about? Will it be replicated in the iOS version?</strong><br>The Czech film composer Elia Cmiral (Ronin) gave us a fantastic score. He managed everything, including recording with real string musicians, which was unusual for a game at the time, but important for us because a key character, Anna Wolff, is a violinist and this becomes central to the plot.</p> <p>The complete original soundtrack is retained in the iOS version, including a major setpiece in which passengers gather in one of the train cars for a violin and piano recital that lasts over an hour. As the player, you can take this opportunity to explore other parts of the train, the music continuing while you duck in and out, or, if you prefer, you can stay and watch the characters perform Cesar Franck's A Minor sonata in its entirety.</p> <p>Oh and here's a piece of trivia: If you visit the piano car in the middle of the night and eavesdrop outside the door, the pianist you hear on the recording is actually my Dad, who composed the music for my first games, Karateka and Prince of Persia.</p> <p><strong>How have you updated or altered the game content for the new format? Are there any new features or story elements?</strong><br>The game is complete and identical to the original - including all graphics, sound, and dialog - but we have added some features for iOS. There's a new three-tiered hint system, so that any time you're stuck, you can get a hint; and if you're still stuck, you can get a hint that's somewhat more explicit, and finally one that tells you straight out what to do. </p> <p>Purists and die-hards of the original game may want to resist the temptation, as much of the fun of Last Express is in exploring and discovering alternative paths that don't necessarily lead you closer to winning. But with five to 20 hours of game play, we recognise that many iOS gamers would prefer a more streamlined experience, so we've made the hints available.</p> <p>For iOS, we've also added GameCenter achievements, unlockable character biographies when you meet a new character, and the ability to replay unlocked cinematic sequences \u2013 whether to refresh your memory for clues, or just to replay favorite game moments.</p> <p><strong>How did you re-think the controls for touchscreen devices?</strong><br>We've redesigned the original point-and-click interface for the touchscreen. All the same actions are available to the player as in the original game, but the element of scanning with the mouse pointer to find them has been eliminated. You simply tap the desired action. It took us a bit of experimentation to arrive at such a straightforward solution, but it's very satisfactory. Even if you're used to the PC version like me, it's surprising how quickly you get used to playing this way. I actually prefer it now.</p> <p>Certain other elements, like the inventory screen, have been redesigned to be more iOS-intuitive.</p> <p>One really nice thing is that on the iPhone, the game now plays vertically. In the original PC game, we depicted narrow train corridors and compartments in portrait mode to create a sense of the confined space in these areas of the train. That struck some people as an eccentric decision, since it left two-thirds of the screen black. On iPhone, it's perfect. When you step into a larger room, such as the restaurant car, you can swipe with your finger to scan the room horizontally. On iPad, the game plays horizontally, as on the PC.</p> <p><strong>How challenging has the whole process been? And has it been interesting to rediscover the game again? Has it reminded you of the original development process?</strong><br>This was a big project for DotEmu, certainly bigger than they realized at the start. I think that's the nature of the Last Express beast \u2013 few iOS games have this much content, let alone so many alternative paths and different ways to play. It took a lot of playtesting and extra QA to iron out all the little quirks and details, much as we did 15 years ago. DotEmu did a terrific job, diligent and conscientious. I could only sympathize. </p> <p>Then again, the original Last Express game was supposed to take eighteen months but ended up taking four years. So by that standard, the iOS port was a piece of cake.</p> <p>Personally, it's been a great pleasure for me to replay Last Express after 15 years. Not only was I relieved to find that the original game holds up well, but as an even happier surprise, iOS is now my favorite way to play it. Maybe because the rhythm of TLE is somewhat meditative, more like reading a novel than playing a typical game, it just feels natural playing it on a comfortable couch instead of sitting in front of a computer. Of course, nothing beats playing it on an actual train, or long plane flight, with headphones.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396876795\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/28/1348856953117/express2.png\" alt=\"Last Express\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong>It's interesting that Last Express is returning just as Revolution Software has had such success with Broken Sword on iPhone \u2013 it seems there is a new audience hungry for adventure games. What is the appeal of this genre in the modern era?</strong><br>I hope you're right. Game studios and publishers have operated for three decades on the assumption that their audience will choose a game with better technology, higher resolutions or frame rates, over one with, say, better plot construction. And this assumption has been largely self-fulfilling, at least on console and PC. But there's always been the occasional wild card success like Tetris, and more recently, the huge boom in simple games like Temple Run, that suggests there's a potentially even bigger public out there that doesn't care that much about the bells and whistles \u2013 they just want an experience.</p> <p>I'd love to think this huge mass of iPhone owners is hungry not just for the next quick addictive fix, but also for games that engage them with stories and characters they can care about, an experience that's different from reading a novel or watching a TV show, but potentially just as meaningful. I don't know if that's true, but I hope it is.</p> <p><strong>Can you tell us how your remake of Karateka (Mechner's first game \u2013 another classic) is coming along - how different is that process for you?</strong><br>Karateka is nearly finished and is due out later this year. I don't want to take away from the TLE release, so I should save most of what I have to say about Karateka until we're closer to the date \u2013 but one big difference is that whereas TLE is a straight port, Karateka is a ground-up reinvention of the original 1984 Apple II game. And whereas TLE is a complex, multi-layered story, rich with the ironies of 20th-century history, and full of opportunities for meandering, reflection and exploration, Karateka was and is extremely compact and linear. You're in medieval Japan, the evil warlord has kidnapped your true love, and you set out to rescue her by fighting an army of karate warriors. Karateka is a straightforward challenge that anybody, young or old, can pick up immediately, grasp what's going on and start playing and having fun.</p> <p>As different as they are, TLE and the new Karateka are both romantic adventures grounded in a historical time and place \u2013 each with a distinctive atmosphere and visual style, and using sound and music in an innovative way.</p> <p><strong>Have you ever thought of producing a follow-up to Last express? It feels like it could so easily be a series... </strong><br>I love these characters and their world and I've certainly thought of revisiting them. Story-wise, [lead character Robert] Cath being the kind of guy he is, and the 20th century being what it was, there's no doubt he would go on getting into trouble and probably landing on the losing side of more struggles \u2013 during the war, after the war... A certain promise is made at the end of the game; it would be interesting to find out what happens with that. Or a prequel involving Cath and Tyler's younger adventures, like the one that ended so badly in Cuba \u2013 or was it Mexico?</p> <p>The thing is, the original TLE was such a huge, ambitious undertaking \u2013 technically, artistically, logistically \u2013 it would be virtually impossible to fund an adventure game on that scale today. The challenge would be to find a way to do it that is smaller, but still builds on the original game in a way that's new and interesting. It would have to be done with the internet and mobile in mind from the beginning.</p> <p><strong>There was such a beauty to Last Express and Price of Persia - they had such a unique visual style, so graceful and artistic. Do you think games have lost something in their quest for photorealism?</strong><br>Thanks for that. The drive toward photorealism has pushed technological advances that all games can now benefit from. But yes, absolutely, games that strive for photorealism pay a price, both literally, in that they're expensive to make, and artistically, in the constraints that come with this choice. The closer we get to photorealism, the more we notice the ways the scene falls short. The ;uncanny valley' is a terrible place to live, yet so many games choose it.</p> <p>But the future is bright. Looking at most of the big console releases over the past few years has sometimes felt a bit like walking through a 17th and 18th-century painting gallery \u2013 room after room of giant canvases, beautifully rendered and lit, yet taken together, depressingly uniform, dark and oppressive. Great if you like that sort of thing. </p> <p>Then suddenly in the next room there's the Impressionists and this fantastic explosion of color and different styles. I think gamers are increasingly willing to embrace a wider variety of distinctive art styles, and mobile and downloadable games are only accelerating this.</p> <p><em>\u2022 The Last Express is available now <a href=\"http://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/the-last-express/id508049561?mt=8\">on the App Store</a> for \u00a32.99</em></p>",
  "<p>They called themselves Dongas, lived outdoors through a bitter winter, threw themselves in front of bulldozers, got beaten up by security guards and sent to prison, and eventually failed to stop the M3 being carved through chalk downland outside Winchester. But the 15-20 urban youths <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twyford_Down#Protest\" title=\"\">who camped out to try to defend Twyford Down in 1992</a> are recognised to have fired up British environmental protest and kickstarted a major shift in green attitudes in both government and the public.</p> <p>On Saturday, some of the Donga \"tribe\" \u2013 named after the Matabele word for gully, which had been given by local people to hollows above Winchester \u2013 return to the scarred hillside with hundreds of others to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the protest with a night under a full moon. They warn that the 40 or so <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/jul/11/government-infrastructure-spending-boost-economy\" title=\"\">new road schemes</a> planned by the government will increase traffic and add to environmental destruction and carbon emissions.</p> <p>They will barely recognise Twyford Down, but they accept that they too have visually changed. Instead of grungy, unemployed kids with painted faces living in squalor, most have settled down, got \"proper jobs\" and have married. A few have died, others are musicians, and some are professional environmental campaigners.</p> <p>The downland was one of Britain's most ancient, protected landscapes, but the Conservative government of the time was prepared to sacrifice it to save motorists an estimated three minutes on the road between London and Southampton, says Becca Lush, now a mother and pillar of the corporate establishment with a cosmetics company. In 1993 she was one of seven Twyford protesters sent to prison for breaking an injunction. \"We didn't know what the fuck we were doing, only that we were doing something.\"</p> <p>\"We were totally naive. We thought we would just go there and save the hill,\" said Alexandra Plows, <a href=\"http://www.bangor.ac.uk/so/staff/plows.php.en\" title=\"\">now a researcher at Bangor University</a>, who recalls how the Dongas tried everything from casting magic spells and running around naked in front of the security guards, to enacting rituals and playing music to keep the road builders away.</p> <p>\"I was very much on a spiritual warrior quest then. We would weave spells, use chants, incantations and rituals. Protection spells for the Down were made up on the spot during drumming and chanting sessions,\" she said. \"We had some excellent big rituals and parties.\"</p> <p>Much of the \u00a312bn road programme planned by the Thatcher government in the 1980s was later abandonned as a direct result of the many road protests that followed Twyford, but the coalition is planning to build hundreds of miles of new roads, says the <a href=\"http://www.bettertransport.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Campaign for Better Transport (CBT)</a>.</p> <p>\"They are being planned despite evidence that new roads generate more traffic and congestion and emissions. Government and local councils want to spend billions of pounds on dozens of new roads over the next few years, and new 'growth' funds and devolved spending powers for local councils threaten to add more projects to this list,\" said a CBT spokesman.</p> <p>Of the new schemes approved in the budget by the Department of Transport, the \u00a3100m Bexhill-Hastings Link Road (BHLR) planned to start in the new year, is expected to have the most traffic, and therefore highest carbon emissions. \"Runaway climate change is one of the greatest threats we face. Yet the government are sponsoring a new wave of road-building across the country, using money that would be much better spent on improving public transport,\" said Abby Nicol, a spokesperson for the <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/combehaven.defenders\" title=\"\">Combe Haven Defenders</a>, who have organised a protest camp near Hastings.</p> <p>The Dongas say they have been proved right. \"Everything that we warned people about 20 years ago is now happening. I remember sitting around the fire and saying that if we did not act, there would be no ice left and great changes in the weather. Well it's here now,\" said Plows.</p>",
  "<p>Liverpool is best known for its two great football clubs, Everton FC and Liverpool FC, with Tranmere Rovers just 'over the water' in Birkenhead.</p> <p>The rivalry of the reds and blues is a central feature of life in the city, but in recent years, efforts have been made to get its homeless population involved in football.</p> <p>Liverpool Homeless Football Club (LHFC) has been in existence for five years, and is linked to the Homeless FA, led by Gareth Parker, who recently visited Liverpool to attend a training session at the Power League in the Pits area.</p> <p>While initially the focus was solely on homeless men, in recent months women have begun to get involved.</p> <p>Two local women, Jess Lomax from Huyton and Becca Mushrow from Toxteth, have been selected as part of the England team which will be involved in the World Homeless Games in Mexico City, starting on 6 October until 14 October.</p> <p>LHFC, which is chaired by John Finnegan, works closely with Everton in the community, and when you visit a training session, you will see that the women are dressed in the club's strip.</p> <p>In addition to Everton, other clubs around England which support the initiative in their own areas are Manchester United, West Bromwich Albion and Arsenal.</p> <p>Henry Mooney, engagement officer of Everton in the Community, said that the project gave the women a chance to qualify for Community Sports Awards. He stressed that it gave them greater confidence and helped them make friends.</p> <p>Last year's games were won by Scotland, which is entering again this year, while Wales is entering for the first time. There is no team from Northern Ireland, though there is one from the Republic of Ireland. In all, over 50 countries will be represented at the Mexican games.</p> <p>One of the players, Gillian Velkoza, said she started playing just six weeks ago, and is hoping to get a team organised in Liverpool's Whitechapel Centre. Her sister (they are, in fact, two of triplets), Louise, got involved at the same time, and says she is 'excited' about getting involved, and wants to train as a football coach.</p> <p>Jess Lomax has been playing football since she was 10, but only got involved in LHFC four months ago. She hopes to become a professional player.</p> <p>Becca Mushrow has also played since she was a child and is looking forward to a 'once in a lifetime experience' in Mexico. </p> <p>She adds she is 'lucky to be coached by Rachel and Fara', referring to Rachel Brown and Fara Williams.</p> <p>Brown, a goalkeeper with Everton's ladies' team, has also played for England and was on Team GB during the Olympics. She has been a patron of LHFC for the past six years and is full of praise for its work.</p> <p>Williams, who is a national patron of the Homeless FA, has been an England captain, and has personal experience of homelessness. </p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.homelessworldcup.org\">Homeless World Cup Foundation</a> explains that it: \"uses the power of football to attract homeless people and offer them the chance to change their lives.</p> <p>Homelessness can force people into isolation, which affects their ability to share, communicate their thoughts and work with others. Day-to-day survival needs take priority over longer term planning - often resulting in a chaotic lifestyle.\"</p> <p>It adds: </p> <blockquote> <p>\"When a homeless person gets involved in football they communicate and build relationships with others; they become team mates, learning to trust and share; they have a responsibility to attend training sessions and games, to be on time and prepared to participate. They feel part of something.</p> <p>These skills and attributes are all transferable to daily life and therefore help homeless people see that they can change their lives.</p> <p>Our national partners provide, or provide access to, the professional services needed - educational, employment, health or legal advice. They also run tournaments and trials to select the eight players who make the journey to the annual tournament, and support them in making the most of this experience on their return afterwards... moving on in their lives and becoming the models and ambassadors for other homeless people in their countries.</p> <p>Whilst the national teams are important and the players go on to have a life-changing experience, they are only the tip of the iceberg and represent only a small proportion of the people positively impacted by our work.\"</p> </blockquote>",
  "<p>The news that the British have built far more schools and hospitals in Helmand province <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/27/afghan-schools-clinics-built-british-close\" title=\"\">than the government of Afghanistan can afford to run</a>, exposes a lie about our intervention in that country that is in many ways as insidious as the lies that surrounded the invasion of Iraq.</p> <p>Afghanistan was always different from Iraq, both in terms of legal authority and in the manner in which the intervention was carried out. Most significantly, Afghanistan was not \"invaded\" by the west. Or if an invasion took place, it happened in 2006 or else in 2009.</p> <p>The US-led Operation Enduring Freedom, which ousted the Taliban 10 years ago, was carried out by a handful of special forces who flew into the country with suitcases full of cash. They bought the allegiance of selected warlords and then called in air strikes against the Taliban hold-outs. Crudely put, we backed one side against another in a brutal civil war that had been going on since the fall of the previous externally imposed government of President Najibullah.</p> <p>An international conference in Bonn, Germany, legitimised the process in December 2001 and selected Hamid Karzai as president basically because he was the most prominent Pashtun that could be found who spoke good English. The UN mission sent to help oversee the process was deliberately given a \"light footprint\" with no executive authority and extremely few resources. A token international military force was also deployed consisting of 4,000 soldiers.</p> <p>At the same time a larger number of humanitarian aid workers arrived to help with the postwar reconstruction. I was one of them and lived in the country for a year-and-a-half between 2003 and 2004 so had a ringside seat of the resulting debacle.</p> <p>The Taliban regrouped in Pakistan and gradually stepped up their cross-border attacks. International aid workers were among the softest targets to attack, and I lost count of the number of friends and colleagues who were killed and injured during this time. Part of the reason we were attacked was a decision by western governments to tie the delivery of aid into a counter-insurgency strategy that was essentially developed to make up for the lack of troops (who were by then increasingly bogged down in the fighting in Iraq). Aid became increasingly viewed as instrumentalist, a means of buying hearts and minds, isolating the insurgents, or to \"shape, hold, clear, and build\" as the counter-insurgency terminology puts it.</p> <p>That this strategy was not working was obvious to everyone on the ground, and convinced the British and Canadian governments to significantly ramp up their military deployments in Kandahar and Helmand in 2006. However, rather than publicly admitting that they were being sent in to fight counter-insurgency campaigns, these were dressed up in humanitarian language. The UK defence secretary at the time, John Reid <a href=\"http://www.channel4.com/news/articles/uk/factcheck%2Ba%2Bshot%2Bin%2Bafghanistan/3266362.html\" title=\"\">said</a>: \"We're in the south to help and protect the Afghan people to reconstruct their economy and democracy. We would be perfectly happy to leave in three years time without firing one shot.\" A Canadian diplomat subsequently admitted to me that this was the only way of selling the operations to a sceptical public.</p> <p>For a couple of years, discussions on Afghanistan took on an Alice in Wonderland dimension where words became devoid of their usual meaning. Observer columnist Nick Cohen wrote perhaps the most <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/nov/11/comment.afghanistan\" title=\"\">extraordinary article</a> ever on the subject when he blamed the lack of delivery of aid projects for a failure to consolidate the military defeats that were supposedly being inflicted on the Taliban. In fact the problem was the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2009/jun/09/war-lies-liberal-left-humanitarian-aid\" title=\"\">exact opposite</a>. There has never been a lack of aid, but a lack of security, which at root is a governance problem and for which counter-insurgency can never be a substitute.</p> <p>The 2006 \"surges\" are now widely recognised to have been catastrophic failures. The larger \"Obama surge\" of 2009 has had some successes due to sheer weight of numbers and firepower, but as the increasing number of \"green on blue\" attacks show, it cannot make up for the wider strategic failure.</p> <p>Alternative options were on offer back in 2001. As <a href=\"http://www.lucymorganedwards.com/\" title=\"\">Lucy Morgan Edwards</a> has convincingly argued, the hardline elements in the Taliban leadership could probably have been overthrown internally, leading to a genuine reconciliation process to bring an end to the country's civil war. We had a chance to genuinely help the Afghans build a better country. Instead we are going to leave them with not much more than a bunch of empty buildings.</p>",
  "<p>Pakistan has rejected claims that it deliberately clears military aircraft from the skies of its border region to allow US drones to operate freely.</p> <p>\"There can be no question of Pakistan's agreement to such attacks,\" the foreign ministry said in response to <a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10000872396390444100404577641520858011452.html\" title=\"\">a report in the Wall Street Journal which claimed the US believed it regularly received consent</a>.</p> <p>According to the newspaper, the CIA sends a fax \"about once a month\" to the ISI, its counterpart in Pakistan, outlining the areas and targets where the unmanned aircraft will operate.</p> <p>The ISI has not replied to the faxes for more than a year, the newspaper said. Nonetheless, US government lawyers regard this as tacit approval, because Pakistan responds by what is called \"de-conflicting\" its airspace \u2013 preventing aircraft from flying in the areas concerned.</p> <p>A government spokesman rejected the insinuation made in the report and reiterated Pakistan's position on drone attacks: \"Drone attacks are illegal, counterproductive, in contravention of international law and a violation of Pakistani sovereignty.\"</p> <p>Diplomats and security analysts believe Pakistan continues to give its consent for the drone strikes.</p> <p>Confidential diplomatic cables released by WikiLeaks revealed that, in 2008, Pakistan's army chief, General Ashfaq Kayani, asked the US for \"continuous Predator [drone] coverage\" in part of South Waziristan.</p> <p>In the same year, former prime minister Yousuf Raza Gilani told the US ambassador that he did not care about the US programme \"as long as they get the right people\".</p> <p>Despite the history of co-operation with the US, drones are very unpopular in Pakistan where politicians, particularly the former cricketer Imran Khan, have gained support by lambasting what many see as the routine violation of Pakistani sovereignty.</p> <p>Underlining the government's delicate balancing act on the issue, the foreign minister, Hina Rabbani Khar, said on Thursday that Pakistan supported the aims of the programme.</p> <p>\"What the drones are trying to achieve, we may not disagree\u2026 If they're going for terrorists \u2013 we do not disagree,\" she said in New York. \"But we have to find ways which are lawful, which are legal.

  "<p>Ecuador is prepared to set up an operating theatre in its London embassy if Julian Assange needs urgent medical attention and the UK is not prepared to guarantee his safe passage to a hospital and back, according to the Ecuadorean foreign minister.</p> <p>As the WikiLeaks founder spent his 100th day in the Ecuadorean embassy, where he has sought refuge from extradition to Sweden to face allegations of sexual crimes, the country's foreign minister met his British counterpart, William Hague, to ask about contingency plans should Assange fall ill.</p> <p>Hague told Ricardo Patino that he would consult officials and lawyers and respond within a few days, but a British official commented: \"Maybe the Ecuadoreans should have thought of that before they granted him asylum.\" The official added that British police were under obligation to arrest Assange as soon as he stepped out of the embassy.</p> <p>\"One thing we have proposed is to have an ambulance parked outside,\" Patino told the Guardian in an interview in New York. \"What we have said, if such a case should happen, we should be ready to install an operating theatre inside the premises, unless Mr Hague responds, as he promised in the next few days, that he [Assange] would be able to go to a hospital.\"</p> <p>The Ecuadorean foreign minister said that the Australian government had offered to help organise Assange's healthcare during an indefinite stay in an embassy apartment, given the diplomatic impasse over his fate. Ecuador offered him asylum last month, saying he faced political persecution in the US, but the UK insists it has a legal duty to arrest him and extradite him to Sweden to face questioning. Australian officials have not confirmed Patino's claim that Canberra had offered medical help.</p> <p>When Assange addressed diplomats at the UN general assembly this week, via a satellite link from the London embassy, he appeared pale, with dark rings under his eyes. His voice was hoarse and his sniffed frequently.</p> <p>Patino said he was not aware of any immediate health concerns for Assange but added: \"We know that anyone who lives in these conditions of confinement may easily suffer from health issues, not only physical but also psychological. Imagine you have to stay in a room for three months. Imagine if you are going to be five years in this confinement.\"</p> <p>In November 2010, a Swedish court ordered Assange be detained for questioning after allegations by two women that what had started as consensual sex had turned non-consensual.</p> <p>This week, Amnesty International called on Sweden to provide a guarantee that if Assange travelled there to answer questions over the sex-crime allegations, he would not be sent on to the US for charges connected to WikiLeaks' publication of thousands of US diplomatic and military cables.</p> <p>A spokeswoman for the Swedish foreign ministry said the country's legislation did not allow any judicial decision like extradition to be predetermined. The UK, which would also have to permit an extradition to the US, has given the same response but Hague stressed to Patino at their New York meeting that the European Convention on Human Rights sets strict limits on such extraditions, forbidding them, for example, if the charges in question carry the death penalty.</p> <p>\"The foreign secretary described the extensive human-rights safeguards in UK extradition law. He requested the government of Ecuador to study these provisions closely in considering the way ahead,\" a foreign office spokesman said.</p> <p>Officials said that the treatment of the alleged source of the WikiLeaks US cables, Bradley Manning \u2013 an American soldier whose lawyers say was subject to brutal and humiliating treatment and who has so far spent more than two years in jail without trial \u2013 would be taken into account if and when any future extradition decision was made.</p> <p>However, Patino said that it was too late for such assurances, since Ecuador's decision to offer asylum was irrevocable.</p> <p>\"When we hadn't yet granted asylum, we could talk about guarantees,\" the foreign minister said. \"Now that we have granted asylum we are under the obligation not to surrender Mr Assange.\"</p>",
  "<p>When it comes time to celebrate 50 years of the James Bond franchise on Friday \u2013 Dr No was released on 5 October, 1962 \u2013 I hope we recall the half-forgotten man of the whole enterprise: the man who, after reading Goldfinger, discerned the potential movie fortune lying dormant in the novels of Ian Fleming; the man who made Sean Connery a star, and sealed Michael Caine's future by giving him his own spy franchise; the man whom one-time producing partner Tony Richardson called \"a huckster, a sublime huckster\". I hope we remember Harry Saltzman.</p> <p>Saltzman was, by all accounts, the ultimate caricature of the movie producer: warm, loud, crass, a consummate gambler with the requisite rackety past, a keen eye for the main chance and a tight fist around the purse strings. For all that, Saltzman ended up being behind some of the most important movies in 1960s British cinema.</p> <p>He was part of the large and largely undocumented influx of creative Canadians that landed in London in the late 1950 and early 60s (culminating with CBC's Sydney Newman's arrival at the BBC's plays department in 1962). Unlike those who arrived direct from Toronto and Montreal \u2013 including actors Donald Sutherland and John Vernon, novelist Mordecai Richler and director Ted Kotcheff \u2013 Saltzman had stayed on in Europe after the second world war, and had a yen for the theatre, his true love.</p> <p>As a theatre impresario he was a washout, but in England he joined Woodfall Films, the production outfit of Tony Richardson and John Osborne, then intent upon replicating on the screen their revolutionary achievements in West End theatre. Their Look Back In Anger adaptation was a flop but Saltzman and Woodfall caught the fleeting zeitgeist \u2013 and hit paydirt \u2013 with Saturday Night And Sunday Morning, making a star of Albert Finney. Saltzman dropped out of Woodfall before its 1963 mega-hit Tom Jones, but James Bond was just over the horizon. Saltzman superintended the writing, sculpting the character and the essence of the franchise \u2013 accentuating the Englishness of it all \u2013 and pushed for the roughneck Sean Connery as Bond over the effete James Mason-ish toffs mulled by Fleming and producer Cubby Broccoli.</p> <p>Once Bond got going, Saltzman, ever contradictory, produced his own anti-Bond franchise from Len Deighton's spy novels, starting with The Ipcress File in 1965. Here, the Bond glitz was displaced by Saltzman's other favoured ethos, kitchen sink realism, and some kind of 60s circle was made complete. He also, bless him, backed Welles's Chimes At Midnight.</p> <p>Saltzman seems to have stepped straight out of one of Mordecai Richler's novels about blazingly nervy and alive Canadian-Jewish bluffers and gamblers.

  "<p>In case you haven't noticed, there's a big problem in the GOP. If the primaries didn't establish this (see Michele Bachmann, Herman Cain, et al), then Mitt <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-503544_162-57517589-503544/noonan-romney-campaign-is-a-rolling-calamity/\">Romney's so-called \"rolling calamity\"</a> of a general election campaign certainly has. In the midst of an incredibly important election to determine the future of America, the Republican party is in the throes of an identity crisis.</p> <p>To be sure, Romney is an imperfect messenger. But he's not entirely to blame for this inability to articulate a sufficiently compelling narrative beyond the \"Not-Obama\" position.&#xa0;In many ways, he's a victim of the times. The Republican party has spent years suffering from unaddressed, systemic problems.</p> <p>It boils down to a lack of leadership, vision and unity. This is, of course, interrelated: visionary leaders use rhetoric to inspire unity, and a party or movement that lacks visionary leaders will quickly spiral out of control \u2013 into a negative cycle of infighting, score-settling and petty vindictiveness. As <a href=\"http://www.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/ryan-were-going-to-beat-him-il6vfi7-170909701.html\">Paul Ryan lamented earlier this week to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"I think that's just the nature of conservative punditry is to do that \u2014 to kind of complain \u2014 about any imperfection they might see.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Perhaps indicative of this remark, <a href=\"http://www.rightwingnews.com/conservatives/matt-lewis-on-the-sell-out-punditry-of-david-frum-and-michelle-malkin/\">Michelle Malkin and David Frum recently engaged</a> in precisely the kind of feud characteristic of a movement that is very unhappy about its position and looking for someone to blame. Conservative&#xa0;commentary today is essentially bifurcated between the red meat-hurling carnival barkers who pander to the base and the mainstream media quislings who cater to the Georgetown cocktail circuit and the cable TV bookers looking to book a \"token\" conservative to fill out their Sunday morning panel.</p> <p><a href=\"http://dailycaller.com/2012/09/23/no-apology/\">As I recently noted in a Daily Caller column</a>, both sides are destructive in their own ways. The quislings undermine our Republican candidates today by criticizing them, while the demagogues ensure the long-term structural changes aren't addressed. Just try to talk about comprehensive immigration reform as a Republican and see how long you last.</p> <p>But to blame Republican opinion-formers for not being positive enough about the party they inhabit is surely a case of shooting the messenger. Robust debate can be a sign of intellectual self-confidence, but this sort of divisiveness between conservative pundits is symptomatic a larger crisis of identity and ideas. It's time for Republicans to ask the big questions that <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKpX-5jQjQ0\">Admiral Stockdale made famous</a> in that debate so many years ago:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"Who are we \u2013 and why are we here?\"</p> </blockquote> <p>The GOP is running on fumes. Like a copy of a copy of a tape, conservatives have been living off the legacy of Ronald Reagan for decades.</p> <p>The cold war was the glue that united the conservative movement. Each leg of the stool \u2013 social conservatives, fiscal conservatives and national security conservatives \u2013 had their own reasons for uniting to defeat the Communists. Reagan benefitted from this unity, as well as from his own ability to inspire, and knew how to play it.</p> <p>But George W Bush managed to put the final nail in the coffin of the decades-long \"Reagan era\", and so it's time to start anew. Bush invented a new Republican brand, but then ensured it couldn't be used again.</p> <p>The \"compassionate conservatism\" that helped get him elected in 2000 ended up being overlooked by an administration distracted by the neoconservative overreach of two foreign wars, combined with increased spending that blew out the deficit and helped create an economic crisis for which many voters still blame President Bush, rather than President Obama. </p> <p>Today's GOP is in need of serious&#xa0;intellectual renewal.&#xa0;For one thing, it's mostly the fiscal leg that supports the three-legged stool these days. The <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/25/opinion/brooks-the-conservative-mind.html\">New York Times's&#xa0;David Brooks makes a good point</a> about the GOP's current focus on economic issues:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"The Republican party has abandoned half of its intellectual ammunition. It appeals to people as potential business owners, but not as parents, neighbors and citizens.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>And this lack of inclusiveness underpins a lot of the Obama campaign's success in tagging Romney as a private equity guy who's only going to look after the prosperity of the super-rich elite. It's been hard for out-of-work \"Reagan Democrats\" in places like Ohio to identify with Mitt Romney.</p> <p>This is not to say economics can be ignored, but Republicans have to articulate the <em>moral case</em> for free markets. It can't be framed negatively, as necessary \"austerity\", or explained in purely wonkish terms. Too often that happens. As one GOP official, giving advice to Mitt Romney, <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2012/09/26/politics/romney-ohio/index.html\">recently told CNN.com</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"Don't make your campaign about marginal tax rates. Make it about your children and your grandchildren and the future of this country.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Some of this is messaging. But there are other not-obviously-ideological ideas that could. </p> <p>Why not support an e-Congress that would allow members of Congress to vote electronically from their districts? Republicans could carry the torch of putting a man on Mars by 2019. And pledge to pass legislation to make eradication of cancer the nation's top national health priority.&#xa0;Or how about championing the kind of education reform that we've seen in films like \"Waiting for Superman\" and \"Won't Back Down\"?</p> <p>Whether it's finding a way to fix education, deal compassionately with immigrants, or other bold and visionary conservative ideas, America can once again be that \"shining city on a hill\" Reagan famously spoke of. It's time for Republicans to once again be the party of the future \u2013 and of the middle class.</p> <p>But vision is not just about policy; it's time for conservatives to rediscover poetry. My guess is that one of the reasons speechwriters like Peggy Noonan have been so critical of Mitt Romney's campaign is that it has lacked any romance or poetry.</p> <p>Conservatives must have a leader who can inspire and can be afforded the luxury of introducing new, unorthodox ideas. In this regard, I'm partial to Senator Marco Rubio, who can eloquently talk about the American Dream, and we have a fresh crop of inspirational possible future leaders: besides Rubio, Representative Mike Pence (a gubernatorial candidate in Indiana) and New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, to name but three.</p> <p>But leaders come and go, and leaders will be found. First, conservatives need to rediscover why it is they want to govern in the first place.</p>",

  "<p>A couple <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/sep/27/uk-flooding-wrexham-couple-drowned?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">drowned on Thursday</a>, possibly while trying to rescue one of their five dogs from the dangerously flooded River Clywedog. We may never find out what exactly happened: perhaps one of them slipped and fell into the river and the other tried to help, and it was nothing to do with the dog at all. But tragic accidents where owners die while trying to rescue their pets are far from rare: in August a c<a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2191591/Hampton-Ponds-Tragedy-married-couple-drowns-trying-save-pet-dog-jumped-lake.html\" title=\"\">ouple in Massachussetts</a> drowned in the Hampton Ponds after their dog Sady had jumped into the water. And every winter there there are stories of dog owners who have died trying to save a dog that has fallen through ice.</p> <p>People who have no pets of their own often listen to such stories with dismay. Why would anyone risk their life trying to save a dog? I would. Your dog's part of your family, and part of your life. You love it. If you have no family, partner or children, you possibly love your dog even more. It's your companion: a reason to get up in the morning. Your life revolves round it, and if you see it in any sort of serious trouble, then you will, usually, try and save it, just as you would try and save anyone else that you love. (I'm saying \"any<em>one</em>\" on purpose here. Anyone who owns a dog does not regard it as a \"thing\". Hopefully.) It's a flash decision. If your dog's being swept away in a flood, you don't have time to think about danger, you don't stand on the bank wondering whether or not that would be a sensible move.</p> <p>Dog owners like me have been told a million times that you should never intervene in a dog fight: plunge in and try and wrench the dogs apart, and you may easily end up getting ripped apart yourself. But that's easier said than done. What are you meant to do when your dog's pinned to the ground by its throat, screaming, blood everywhere? Just stand and look? Some people manage to do just that. They think that the dogs will eventually sort things out for themselves, and often they're right.</p> <p>Personally, I have found it impossible to just stand back in a situation like this. My dog was having a go at a giant poodle in some bushes. In I went to pull them apart. But dogs thrash about while fighting and it's difficult to get hold of the right collar. I couldn't really see what was going on, and suddenly I felt a horrid popping sensation as the poodle's teeth went through my hand. Afterwards, I was thinking: that served me right, I probably shouldn't have done it. But then I'd do it again.</p> <p>I also once pulled a friend's puppy out of a pond. I saw its nose sticking up, the puppy paddling like mad, exhausted and sinking, my elderly friend's behind me panicking. What was I meant to do? Watch it drown? I know a poodle isn't a pitbull, and this was only a pond and not dangerous, but with a more obviously dangerous dog and in a flooded river the situation would be more desperate and you'd have even less time to think.</p> <p>I am not expecting that this will convince anyone who's never had a dog. Many people are outraged if you compare an animal to a child. But if a helpless creature that you love is in serious trouble, possibly about to die, it doesn't really matter if it's a dog, a cat, a horse or a beached whale. You're going to go on jumping into rivers, oceans, fights and fires to save it, whatever anyone else thinks.</p>",

  "<p>Lewis Hamilton has been told by his employer at McLaren, Martin Whitmarsh, that he has made a mistake in joining Mercedes. As Mercedes confirmed that Hamilton would replace Michael Schumacher on a three-year deal from next year, Whitmarsh said: \"Mercedes is a great partner of ours and they are a great team. But for anyone leaving McLaren, and he wants to win, I think that's a mistake because I have faith and belief in this team.</p> <p>\"Whether you measure it over the last four races, four years or 40 years, we're a fantastic team. So I would say to any driver who wanted to win in this sport: 'Come and join McLaren and aspire to join McLaren'. I wouldn't advise anyone to leave McLaren if they want to win, but I've got to respect Lewis's decision and really wish him well.\"</p> <p>Whitmarsh, who has filled the vacancy with the exciting Sauber driver Sergio P\u00e9rez from Mexico, said that Hamilton had informed him of his decision to leave two days previously, and had since phoned him again. McLaren appeared confident of retaining Hamilton when the team left Singapore last weekend, having won their fourth pole position in a row.</p> <p>Whitmarsh said: \"I know we made a very big financial offer, bigger than I believe any Formula One driver is enjoying today. That is something that I am comfortable with. But ultimately we move forward now.\"</p> <p>But McLaren's original offer was believed to be just two-thirds of Hamilton's current deal. The contract with Mercedes is more lucrative at \u00a315m a year and gives the driver potential to earn more commercially than he did at the Woking-based team.</p> <p>Hamilton spoke on Friday of \"a fresh challenge\" and added: \"\"I have been incredibly fortunate to have been part of McLaren and Mercedes since I was 13 years old, and I even remember signing my first contract with them. I will be forever grateful for the opportunity that they have given me and for their support throughout the years.</p> <p>\"I have had the pleasure of working with a fantastic team of genuine people and would like to thank them all for their hard work and support.\"</p> <p>McLaren, at least, have saved millions by agreeing a three-year deal with P\u00e9rez, worth \u00a320m over that period.</p> <p>Whitmarsh said: \"We have selected Sergio because we think he is one of the best talents in Formula One. He is very young and undeveloped and yet he has had some stunning performances.</p> <p>\"There are a lot of people who have supported Sergio and they are excited by the prospect of him joining a great team like McLaren. We have an exciting young Mexican who can add a new dimension to this team and to the sport.\"</p> <p>Perez said: \"\"I'm under no illusion I've made a very big step \u2013 as it would be for any driver \u2013 but I'm ready for it.\"</p> <p>The challenge facing McLaren, for the remaining six races of the season, is maintaining a good professional relationship between Hamilton and Jenson Button as they attempt to win the constructors' championship for the first time in 14 years. That will not be easy, especially as Hamilton still has a chance of winning the drivers' title.</p>",

  "<p>Three decades of European Commission-funded best practice projects and billions of euros later, Britain has a problem. We know that there are many excellent examples of urban and rural public transport, cycling, car sharing, air quality strategies, freight and logistic strategies and other successes that improve quality of life for local residents in Denmark, Sweden, Germany and the Netherlands. But we do not imitate, adapt and develop the best practice examples at home.</p> <p>There is no learning process underway for local authorities that interrogates this best practice and adopts the best ideas. On a recent trip to Germany, I checked into my hotel in Wuppertal and was given a free public transport pass. If you visit a tourist destination in the Black Forest in southern Germany and stay in a hotel or holiday let, you will be given the same kind of card. This encourages tourists to leave their cars at home, helping cut congestion and pollution. This does not happen even in the busiest UK tourist destinations, such as the Lake District. After several decades of worry, reports and debates about sustainable transport in the Lake District, a helpful policy modelled on the Black Forest case has still yet to be put into practice. Many parts of the region are blighted by the volume of cars, carparks, noise and pollution.</p> <p>This is not just a transport matter. A report from ITDP in New York, published last year, presents an <a href=\"http://www.itdp.org/library/publications/europes-vibrant-new-low-carbon-communities-desktop-printer-version/\" title=\"\">analysis of eight communities</a> that have adopted \"smart urban growth\" policies that encourage walking, cycling and public transport, high-quality housing, bringing derelict sites back into use and creating high-quality living space with less pollution, fewer greenhouse gas emissions and a positive impact on public health.</p> <p>Given the emphasis in British political, economic and planning debates on the need for new homes, the need to defend the green belt and the very large amount of brownfield land available for development, it is surprising that Greenwich is the only British community in this study.</p> <p>There is nothing on the scale of Freiburg, with its 15,500 residents in high quality car-free areas, Hammarby Sjostad and its 17,000 population and Vastra Hammen and with a community of 4,300. There is ample scope in the UK for dozens of areas like this \u2013 but it is not happening.</p> <p>Why does the UK have such a large implementation deficit? There are a number of possible explanations. The UK has moved in the direction of the US and expects markets to sort things out, at the same time as we experience repeated examples of market failure.</p> <p>Markets have not sorted out banking and finance and markets do not work well in organising and delivering high-quality, totally integrated public transport systems. Similarly, markets don't seem ready and willing to sort out smart urban growth, re-use of brownfield sites and housing that can match <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/housing-network/2011/feb/09/passivhaus-technology-housing-associations-climate-change?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">German Passivhaus standards</a> of energy use.</p> <p>Relying on markets is partnered by a reduction in the power and funding for local government to take action that would improve quality of life. A close look at Malmo (population 302,000) or Gothenburg (population 522,000) show how local authorities in Sweden have more powers and budgets to make change happen at local level without going cap in hand to the centre.</p> <p>The small Swedish city of Lund (population 82,000) has implemented a world-class transport, land use, housing and economic development strategy that can only be dreamed about in similar UK cities. When local authorities get more power and more money to make things happen, they attract politicians with a stronger determination to produce real change.</p> <p><em>John Whitelegg is a member of the </em><a href=\"http://www.sei-international.org/\" title=\"\"><em>Stockholm Environment Institute</em></a><em>, visiting professor of sustainable transport at Liverpool John Moores University.

  "<p>At the Lib Dem conference this week I bumped into an old chum, a financial consultant who was as keen as Nick and Vince to blame Gordon Brown and Ed Balls for Britain's debt hangover. My friend also remains an enthusiast for the euro, but there's not much we can do about that. What worries me more is that the banking crowd have shown even less repentance than the shadow chancellor for what went wrong.</p> <p>Patrick Wintour <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2012/sep/27/labour-public-spending-ed-balls\" title=\"\">interviews Balls</a> for Friday's Guardian. He's always interesting, though his insistence on spartan spending discipline remains hard to square with his and GB's expansive record at No 11. Never mind, more important is the continuing fallout from the misconduct of the banks \u2013 for which two prime pieces of evidence float to the surface again.</p> <p>One is what looks like a bold attempt \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2012/sep/28/libor-riggers-jailed-fsa-regulator\" title=\"\">here's Jill Treanor's report</a> \u2013 to restore confidence in the London interbank offered rate, better known as Libor, the amount banks charge each other to lend money, which turns out to have been manipulated for corporate or personal gain during the City's wild west decade. Instead of the system being sponsored by the British Banking Association (BBA), an independent regulator will do the job.</p> <p>Good. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Wheatley\" title=\"\">Martin Wheatley</a>, hired from Hong Kong, where he was securities regulator in that very sophisticated market, to head the new Financial Conduct Authority \u2013 part of the breakup of Brown's flawed regulatory regime \u2013 seems to have adopted a robust approach, as outsiders often find it easier to do.</p> <p>He was made redundant at the Financial Services Authority (FSA) in 2004 and acquired a tough reputation chasing insider trading in Hong Kong. Now he's back, let's hope he keeps it up. This was a serious failure of cosy BBA governance \u2013 not to mention FSA and Bank of England regulation \u2013 in the face of concerns being expressed about Libor's probity. Wheatley's report proposes criminal sanctions. Good again.</p> <p>Far less important in the big numbers end of the business \u2013 Libor is at the <a href=\"http://www.economist.com/node/21563743\" title=\"\">heart of $300 trillion worth</a> of churning transactions \u2013 but more interesting because it affects so many more people directly is the Guardian report (I can't find it elsewhere, even in the banker-bashing Daily Mail) that <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/money/2012/sep/27/ppi-complaints-double\" title=\"\">complaints to banks have grown by nearly two-thirds </a>in the first six months of 2012.</p> <p>This is nothing to do with investment banking, the Las Vegas side of the business, but is about the way its poor ethical sense seems to have seeped into the retail arm of banking, what used to be the staid and respectable high street bank \u2013 <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dad%E2%80%99s_Army\" title=\"\">its Captain Mainwaring </a>side. As with pensions mis-selling in the deregulated financial services industry since the Thatcherite Big Bang of the mid-80s, pressure to make profits at any cost leads to shortcuts and bad behaviour. The customer suffers.</p> <p>Yet, seriously successful business leaders \u2013 like leaders in most walks of life \u2013 know that putting the needs of the customer first is the way to sustain profitability, growth and long-term stability. That's what those boring middle-sized German firms are so good at, boring British ones too.</p> <p>Lisa Bachelor's <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/money/2012/sep/27/ppi-complaints-double\" title=\"\">Guardian report</a> is pegged to a survey by Which?, the consumer watchdog, which reports that 12,000 complaints a day (or 2.2m between January and June 2012) related to payment protection insurance (PPI), which was widely mis-sold with the result that the courts have ruled that any policy on which it would have been <em>impossible</em> to claim should warrant a refund. Hence the stampede.</p> <p>For its part, Which? is warning that the \u00a310bn which the big banks \u2013 Lloyds, HSBC, RBS and Barclays, all tainted one way or another by the wave of post-bust scandals \u2013 have set aside to deal with the problem may not be enough. No wonder they're not keen to lend to small businesses and others needing funds to help keep the economy afloat.</p> <p>I recently had a minor run-in with Barclays, my own bank since 1963. The details are boring (not to me, of course), but they bounced a savings cheque I'd written on the last day of this financial year because they didn't like the look of my signature. One perfunctory check call was made to my home phone number (we still have one!) \u2013 no answer \u2013 but none made to the Barclay staffer supposed to look after my affairs who later told me the signature looked fine.</p> <p>The money which was supposed to move from Barclays to an Isa stayed with Barclays. I suppose every little counts. I got the brush-off and it wasn't a life-and-death issue as it can be for a struggling small business. At least my complaint was heard \u2013 I expect they know what I do for a living \u2013 and I was told I could take it to the FSA. \" I'd rather chop my arm off,\" I think I replied. The FSA now has 650 staff dealing with PPI claims alone, I'm not going to add to its burdens.</p> <p>Yet I have a niggling bit of sympathy for the banks here. Why? Because in most black-and-white stories with an obvious villain, someone usually escapes lightly. The media, for example, always lets itself off the hook. That's why <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/video/2012/sep/12/hillsborough-campaigner-kelvin-mackenzie-video\" title=\"\">ex-Sun editor Kelvin McKenzie is busy</a> demanding an apology from South Yorkshire police for misleading him into printing lies about the Hillsborough dead. They printed it because they wanted to believe it.</p> <p>In this instance, Lisa Bachelor's report notes that specialist firms \u2013 you catch them advertising on cheap daytime TV channels \u2013 are whipping up custom (just as they do with accidents at work) by dangling large payouts in front of hard-pressed people, not all of whom are deserving. The banks claim that some such claimants are found never to have banked with them.</p> <p>Well, they would, wouldn't they? But so would the lawyers and other ambulance chasers who stand to cream handy fees off the top of successful cases of mistreatment. As always, the correction of one of society's abuses \u2013 unfair dismissal, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/theguardian/2012/aug/12/davy-guy-obituary\" title=\"\">pneumoconiosis</a>, arbitrary asylum verdicts, hospital errors \u2013 creates an opportunity for all sorts of rascals to pile in behind the deserving to exploit exploitative and careless exploiters, like the banks.</p> <p>As the financialisation of daily life \u2013 <a href=\"http://richardrglover.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/financialization-of-social-life-and-the-socialization-of-finance-2010.pdf\" title=\"\">here's one explanation (pdf)</a> \u2013 creeps relentlessly forward (and more productive forms of economic activity recede in the old industrial west), we will see more such manifestations of desperation and opportunism.</p> <p>Do you remember in Victorian novels, Dickens is a good example, how some characters were always waiting for a legacy that would put their lives right? Well, nowadays it can be a PPI or personal injury claim. Fine for lawyers, but as the old question goes, \"<a href=\"http://books.google.co.uk/books/about/Where_Are_the_Customers_Yachts.html?id=CDKG3jqO6MQC&amp;redir_esc=y\" title=\"\">where are the customers' yachts</a>?\"</p>",
  "<p>Much has been said about this year's Three Under Three contest, much of it false, much of it accusatory and much of it of a vitriolic personal nature directed at myself. I would like to address some of these issues head-on, and in as straightforward and honest a manner as I can.</p> <p>In the first place, it is true that I turned 40 this year, and it is equally true that, for the 40th time, my writing did not make it into the New Yorker's \"Forty Under Forty\" issue, or Granta's \"Forty Under Forty\" issue, or the LA Times's \"Forty Faces Under Forty\" issue, or the Guardian's annual \"Forty American Writers Under Forty to Watch\", or even McSweeney's \"Forty Writers Under Forty Who Live Near Us in Brooklyn and We Hang Out With Quite a Bit or At Least Would Like To\". There are many reasons for that, not the least of which is that they are all shitty magazines dedicated to the death of writing and literature. Would I like to have been included? Of course. We all want external validation of our years of sweat and toil. But to suggest my exclusion from these lists in the last year of my eligibility for them somehow affected my judging of the Paradigm day school Three Under Three writing contest is not just baseless slander, it is armchair psychology of the very worst kind.</p> <p>To remind everyone: I was asked (without any offer of remuneration at all, mind you) to read through the many submissions and choose \"the three writers under three years of age who capture the inventiveness and vitality of contemporary American pre-school literature\".</p> <p>I shall come back to this.</p> <p>Much of the vitriol directed at me has come from the family and friends of young Zachary Goldfarb, and so I would like to address his submission first. I can understand their disappointment, but frankly, Zachary's \"story\" was nothing of the kind. Here is his submission, copied without alteration: \"David likes the snow.</p> <p>The snow is cold.</p> <p>So is ice.\"</p> <p>Well, whoop-de-fucking-doo. \"David\" (we can assume this is a fictional Zuckerman-like stand-in for Zachary himself) likes the snow. Do I need Mr Goldfarb to tell me this?</p> <p>Of what consequence can this preference for snow be?</p> <p>Where, more importantly, is the story? David simply is. He does nothing, desires nothing. He exists, if that, and nothing more. If perhaps we had been told that David did not like the snow, and the snow was cold, we could at least imagine the beginnings of a story, a conflict, a drama: perhaps David will try to find warmth (a quest of sorts)? Perhaps he will come, in the end, to like the snow? But as it is written, all we know is that David likes the snow. If there is a connection between David's appreciation of snow and the relative coldness of the snow and ice, it is left to the reader to discern.</p> <p>Should I reward this? The snow is cold, Zachary, that is true. So is the ice. And so is the world, and so is life. Get used to it.</p> <p>The second submission, from Sally Ryan, two: \"Michael is nice. He shares his toys and never hits.</p> <p>Today he was sick. I hope he feels better.\"</p> <p>Good God. Where to begin? Let's grant, for just a moment, that when Ms Ryan penned this little tale, she knew that in future chapters the obviously Jesus-like simplistic character of Michael would deepen and somehow become more complex and multidimensional. And let's also grant that the plot issue she sets up here (Michael's illness and her concomitant hope for his recuperation) will be resolved in the pages to come. Let's grant all that. But shall we also grant that this is fiction, which the contest expressly limits itself to? Shall we just ignore the fact that there is in fact a Michael in Ms Ryan's class, a Michael who is known the school over for sharing his toys and never hitting and had, at the time of the writing of this \"story\", a very nasty flu? What lesson would we be teaching Sally if we let her win a fiction contest with a clearly non-fictional work? What we have here in Sally Ryan is our very own <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/james-frey\" title=\"\">James Frey</a>, but rather than faking reality, she has chosen to fake fiction. I, for one, am sickened.</p> <p>And so we come to the winner: \"Harley was our dog. She is dead now. I want to get a cat.\"</p> <p>At last. This is art. This is pathos. This is story. And yes, this is also my own entry. But can you not see the difference between this small gem and&#xa0;the earlier (failed) attempts of Mr Goldfarb and Ms Ryan? Here we have sadness and rage and pain and even, yes, in the very last sentence, a flicker of hope for the future. A beginning: Harley was our dog. A middle: She is dead now. An ending, a ray of light: I want to get a cat. A simple story, but a deceptive one, for the main character has changed, has he not? He is hardened now, slightly older and more knowing of the vicissitudes of life.</p> <p>He loved a dog, and yet still, he wants a cat. He can't go on, he goes on. Is that not the modern Everyman? Falling, in our humanity, in love; witnessing, in our mortality, death; and rising, thanks to our damned humanity, to love once more. I read this story and hope, despite myself, for the future of literature. I looked, as I had been instructed, for \"the three writers under three years of age who capture the inventiveness and vitality of contemporary American pre-school literature\", and I found not three. I found not even one. And so I submitted my own. If that annoys some of the other entrants, or their parents, perhaps they should think of literature before themselves.</p> <p>Thank you.</p> <p>(The award ceremony will be held at Skytop Bar and Lounge, Saturday night, 9pm.)</p> <p>\u2022 Picador's 40th birthday celebration is on Monday 1 October at King's Place, York Way, London N1.

  "<p>With <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/sep/19/arctic-ice-shrinks\" title=\"\">melting sea ice</a>, extreme weather and continued warnings from leading scientists on the need to tackle climate change, it beggars belief that the coalition government persists in pushing though policies that will increase the nation's reliance on dirty and increasingly expensive fossil fuels.</p> <p>But with the <a href=\"http://www.labour.org.uk/annual_conference_2012\" title=\"\">Labour party conference</a> starting on Sunday, it's also time to ask; why isn't the opposition doing more to champion the environment?</p> <p>Last week Ed Miliband \u2013 a man who really understands the issues - <a href=\"http://www.google.com/hostednews/ukpress/article/ALeqM5j8Z5M4Jl4E7CHFB-N-SodVgaXnrw?docId=N0312291348225380480A\" title=\"\">made a timely and extremely welcome intervention on the debate</a>. He gave his backing to the <a href=\"http://www.theccc.org.uk/\" title=\"\">government's official climate adviser</a> and said that the forthcoming <a href=\"http://www.decc.gov.uk/en/content/cms/legislation/energybill2012/energybill2012.aspx\" title=\"\">energy bill</a> must contain a clear commitment to decarbonise the UK power system by 2030.</p> <p>This is a crucial contribution that challenges government policy - championed by the chancellor, George Osborne - for <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/sep/28/gas-fired-power-stations-uk\" title=\"\">a new dash for gas</a> that would leave the UK hooked on this costly fossil fuel for decades. It will also increase pressure on the Liberal Democrats, and help solidify <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/sep/26/nick-clegg-lib-dem-green-promises\" title=\"\">Nick Clegg's resolve to hold the Conservatives to their promises on the environment</a>.</p> <p>Despite <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2010/may/14/cameron-wants-greenest-government-ever\" title=\"\">David Cameron's pledge to lead the greenest government ever</a>, the past two-and-a-half years have seen environmental policies shunted into the margins of policy-making.</p> <p>The coalition would find it harder to disregard the environment and the need to build a strong low-carbon economy if Labour put the issue high on the political agenda. During the last parliament, Cameron's support for the Climate Change Act was pivotal in persuading the then Labour government to put their weight behind it. If we really are going to build the low-carbon future that we so urgently need, it's time for Labour to step up to the plate.</p> <p>For Labour, championing the environment is a real opportunity to drive an electoral juggernaut into the political space left by a right-lurching Conservative party and a Liberal Democrat party so far failing to hold the line on environmental action.</p> <p>Yet Labour's Treasury team has woefully failed to challenge Osborne's flawed economic strategy. As the chancellor has steadily undermined the green economy and shown increasing support for gas and oil, the silence from Ed Balls has frequently been deafening.</p> <p>Where has the shadow chancellor been when Osborne has pushed for policies that prop up the discredited broken carbon-dependent economy of the last century and undermine investment in a cleaner future?</p> <p>Earlier this year, <a href=\"http://www.cbi.org.uk/media-centre/press-releases/2012/07/green-or-growth-is-a-false-choice-%E2%80%93-cbi-chief/\" title=\"\">the CBI calculated</a> that the green economy provided one-third of all growth in 2010, and estimated that it could add 0.5% to growth in 2012 if only the government \"put the right policies in place\". With the Bank of England forecasting zero growth this year, 0.5% is not to be sniffed at.</p> <p>But that potential 0.5% is also a better type of growth \u2013 one that provides firm foundations for future prosperity. Investing in wind, waves and sun, and energy saving would create tens of thousands of new jobs and business opportunities right across the country, not just in a few favoured locations. And weaning the nation off expensive gas and reducing energy demand will help cash-strapped households struggling with rocketing fuel bills - unlike just making it easier for them to build conservatories.</p> <p>Balls would find an easy win if he used his despatch box attacks to really get Osborne on the ropes over the misleading economy versus environment narrative \u2013 and his failure to support a green economy that's currently growing in its own right at over four per cent each year. Surely, the green economy is an extraordinary political opportunity for Labour?</p> <p>But, rather astonishingly the CBI appears to be more outspoken on the need for green growth than the shadow chancellor.</p> <p>Earlier this year CBI boss <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/jul/05/green-growth-false-choice-cbi\" title=\"\">John Cridland attacked the lack of government support for the growing green economy</a>:</p> <blockquote> \"The UK has made a great start tapping into green economic opportunities but mixed signals from the government are setting the UK back. If we can't be sure that the policies of today will still be the policies of tomorrow, we simply won't build business and consumer confidence or secure the investment we need.\" </blockquote> <p>We will never capitalise on the promise of our burgeoning green economy or avert the worst excesses on climate change, unless politicians are prepared to stand up and be counted both in opposition and in government.</p> <p>Tackling climate change isn't a luxury, it's a necessity \u2013 and with the key levers of government power in the hands of a proudly anti-green chancellor we desperately need Labour to be the greenest opposition ever.</p>",

  "<p>Kenyan troops have launched an amphibious assault on the port stronghold of Somalia's Islamist al-Shabaab militants, landing forces on Kismayo's beach in a long-heralded attack meant to deal a fatal blow to the rebels.</p> <p>Residents, many of whom were hunkered down in their homes as the battle continued, said the attack came from the air and sea at around 3am local time. Some expressed fears the assault would signal the start of a wider battle for control of the strategic port among rival clan militias.</p> <p>\"It was an amphibious assault, delicate and&#xa0;\u2026 meticulously planned,\" Colonel Cyrus Oguna, a spokesman for the Kenyan military, said. \"We have so far encountered minimum resistance,\" he added, saying there had been no casualties among the Kenyan troops or their Somali National Army (SNA) allies. The Kenyan army has also been supported in its campaign by Ras Kamboni, a local militia.</p> <p>Abdi Buule, an elder in Kismayo, said Kenyan and Somali forces had pushed deep into the city.</p> <p>\"The people are worried. No one could go outside this morning, even the people could not cook their breakfast. The fighting is now going on,\" he said by telephone.</p> <p>Al-Shabaab, which is linked to al-Qaida, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/aug/07/somali-troops-mogadishu-rebels-out\" title=\"\">withdrew from Mogadishu in August last year</a> after fierce fighting with the Ugandan and Burundian troops of a 17,000-strong African Union peacekeeping force \u2013 Amisom.</p> <p>Since then, the militants, who include foreign fighters as well as Somalis and who have imposed a strict form of sharia law in the areas they control, have been forced further into the south of the country.</p> <p>Kismayo is their last major stronghold, and a key source of revenue: the militants are heavily dependent on earnings from charcoal exports through the port, and taxes levied on businesses.</p> <p>\"We heard roars of heavy guns and aeroplanes flying over us. I fled from home with my two children to the other side of town,\" Aamina, 34, said by telephone from Kismayo.</p> <p>She said she had seen four bodies on Friday morning, including those of civilians. The elder, Abdi Buule, said around 160 people had been arrested by the Kenyan forces, who feared the militants would try to hide among the population.</p> <p>Oguna said Kenya used most of its naval assets in the operation, and that ground forces, which had been massing for an attack from the other side of Kismayo, were moving in, with some having already entered the city.</p> <p>He said the operation was carried out mostly by Kenyan forces and fighters from the SNA. \"The operation is dynamic. We have been there for only a couple of hours. It is too soon to predict how long it will take,\" he said. A lot of infrastructure had been destroyed, he added, and al-Shabaab fighters had been killed although he could not give a number.</p> <p>Al-Shabaab said heavy fighting was continuing on Friday morning.</p> <p>\"Ships have brought Kenyan troops on our Kismayo beach last night. Fierce fighting between us and them is going on now,\" Sheikh Abdiasis Abu Musab, al-Shabaab's spokesman for military operations, told Reuters.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/oct/17/somali-islamists-threaten-kenya-attack\" title=\"\">Kenyan forces crossed the border into Somalia in October last year</a> to pursue the militants officials blamed for a series of kidnappings and cross-border raids. They joined Amisom in June.</p> <p>In the days before the beach-front assault, Kenyan jets attacked al-Shabaab logistic centres in the port, raising fears among aid groups that many civilians might be killed and injured in a final battle for the city.</p> <p>Human Rights Watch (HRW) reported in August that <a href=\"http://www.hrw.org/news/2012/08/23/somalia-protect-civilians-kismayo\" title=\"\">at least three civilians had been killed in shelling by Kenyan navy ships</a>. HRW and the UN called on Kenyan troops to do more to protect Somalis during the military advance. Thousands of residents were reported to be fleeing the city in the past few weeks.</p> <p>The assault came less than a month after activist and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/10/somalia-chooses-new-president-elections\" title=\"\">professor Hassan Sheikh Mohamud was elected president in Mogadishu</a>, the first leader to be chosen inside Somalia since the 1991 overthrow of dictator Mohamed Siad Barre.</p> <p>His inauguration raised hopes that Somalia might be entering a new era, although optimism was tempered by a series of deadly suicide bomb attacks in Mogadishu, including one targeting the new president.</p> <p>Analysts have pointed out that even if Kismayo falls, al-Shabaab fighters may melt into the sparsely populated countryside, harassing the Amisom forces and local population with guerrilla-style hit-and-run attacks.</p> <p>Some have also raised concerns about a possible power vacuum opening up. It is unclear who would ultimately control Kismayo, a lucrative source of income that has been fought over by Somali clans in the past.</p> <p>There have been reports of local militias arming themselves, and even of a former warlord travelling to the city from Mogadishu in the past few weeks.</p> <p>Abdi Buule, the elder in Kismayo, echoed these fears.</p> <p>\"Every person is thinking what will happen in the next days. Al-Shabaab officials escaped but their fighters are still in the town&#xa0;\u2026 People here are very worried over the militias [fighting] alongside with Kenyan forces, who can create new inter-clan rivalry&#xa0;\u2026 Kismayo&#xa0;\u2026 is a very strategic town and so now every clan militia is getting ready to have its role in the town,\" he said.</p> <p>The fall of Kismayo will also intensify fears of retaliation within Kenya where security is already very tight. Kenyan youths are known to be fighting with al-Shabaab and there have been a series of grenade attacks on bars and churches in Kenya since the country's troops crossed into Somalia.</p> <p><em>\u2022 Additional reporting by Abdalle Ahmed in Mogadishu</em></p>",
  "<p>Some years ago, a friend drove me up the Mississippi on a tour of the plantation mansions that still stud the landscape between New Orleans and Baton Rouge. Towards dusk, we drove past the impressive approach to the Oak Alley mansion. Its pillared fa\u00e7ade gleamed in the approaching dark, then a wedding party appeared from the shadows of the oaks, as perfect a moment as if it had been choreographed just for us.</p> <p>For a minute, the glamorous clich\u00e9 wiped away the discomfiture that had plagued me all day. The opening of <a href=\"http://www.atticalocke.com/\" title=\"\">Attica Locke</a>'s second novel does precisely the opposite. She begins with an unsettling moment of fear and drama that tells us very clearly we're not in Tara any more. There is, literally, a snake in the garden of Eden.</p> <p><em>The Cutting Season</em> is set in the fictitious Belle Vie plantation, where the magnificent antebellum mansion sits uneasily cheek by jowl with the restored slave quarters. Like its inspiration, Oak Alley, Belle Vie is a combination of museum and venue for parties and conferences. Local African Americans enact the roles of slaves in a sanitised interpretation of the plantation's dark history.</p> <p>In one of the book's many compelling ironies, in its current iteration Belle Vie is managed by a black woman, Caren Gray. It's her job to make sure everything runs smoothly, from maintenance of the grounds to the historical tableaux staged for the public. It's a job for which Caren is overqualified, but she's a single mother with limited options in a struggling economy.</p> <p>For Caren, Belle Vie's history is more than just another chapter in the tormented past of the American south. Her own mother worked at the house when it was still the family home of the Clancys. But the past has a longer reach than that \u2013 Caren is directly descended from Belle Vie slaves, notably a notorious runaway called Jason.</p> <p>These days, the plantation's existence is precarious. Income doesn't match outgoings, and the conglomerate whose sugar-cane operation surrounds the now-meagre acreage have plenty of cash to tempt the Clancys to walk away from their history and sell up.</p> <p>But when murder comes to Belle Vie, it appears to have nothing to do with anyone connected to the plantation. When the groundsman discovers a woman in a shallow grave by the property boundary, Caren soon discovers that the brutally murdered victim was a migrant worker on the cane-cutting operation on the other side of the fence. Her determination to make sure the woman's death is taken seriously becomes the engine that propels her into levels of danger she has never imagined.</p> <p>Locke was shortlisted for the Orange Prize for her first novel, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/nov/28/attica-locke-thriller-review\" title=\"\"><em>Black Water Rising</em></a>, which similarly concerned itself with the black experience in recent American history. So it's no surprise that the slave past is a vivid part of the present-tense investigation. Locke is too subtle a writer to draw our attention to the parallels, but they're clear in the way the inquiry into the murder unfolds.</p> <p>For Caren, it's like being the ribbon on a tug-of-war rope. Her loyalties are in conflict, her instincts pull her away from her best interests, and at the heart of it all lies threat. Her child, her future and her own life are cast into jeopardy as she tries to negotiate a safe path through the complicated jungle of Belle Vie's history.</p> <p>It's a novel rich in atmosphere, strong in story, but at its heart <em>The Cutting Season</em> hinges on human complexity. The tangled rope of some kind of history has a stranglehold on everyone at the heart of this book, and their relationships give it a texture that reminds us why we come to fiction rather than the historical account. There are solutions here but no easy answers for Caren Gray, or for the rest of us.</p> <p>At the close of this book, I couldn't help remembering the souvenir shops in the showpiece plantation houses. How we've managed to bring frivolity to places that were home to so much human misery. And I felt ashamed. Irresistibly reminiscent of Faulkner's resigned maxim, \"The past is never dead. It's not even past\", <em>The Cutting Season</em> does what the best crime fiction is can do: it illuminates our present in the light of our past and explains us to ourselves. On this evidence, Attica Locke is more than capable of that. And also of leaving us on the edge of our seats, hearts in our mouths.</p> <p>\u2022 Val McDermid's <em>The Vanishing Point</em> is published by Little Brown.</p>",
  "<p>The Niger government took the brave decision last year <a href=\"http://www.trust.org/alertnet/news/niger-warns-of-looming-food-crisis\" title=\"\">to sound the alarm early on hunger</a> \u2013 the rainy season, from July to September, had been well below average and a drop in food production looked likely.</p> <p>One year later, the picture is very different. This time the alarm is being raised by NGOs <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/global-development/gallery/2012/aug/24/niger-floods-in-pictures\" title=\"\">to help an estimated 500,000 affected by flooding in Niger</a>. \"[It's] the last thing Niger needed,\" said Samuel Braimah, Oxfam's country director.</p> <p>Despite the flooding, the rains are welcome news for approximately 15 million people in six countries in the Sahel threatened by <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/global-development/graphic/2012/mar/09/sahel-food-crisis-map\" title=\"\">a food crisis</a> sparked by drought last year. Across the region, above average rainfall has been recorded in 2012. Predictions for southern Mali by Fewsnet, the US early warning system, suggest at least 93% of the millet crop will be successful. Although there have been pockets of drought, and the rains may be in danger of petering out before October in some regions, anecdotal evidence suggests prices in local markets are starting to ease.</p> <p>But good news on the rains risks signalling that everything is back to normal. Oxfam is trying to stop donor and media attention turning elsewhere, saying: \"The food crisis is far from over and an increase in aid is still needed to help farmers and herders overcome the triple challenges of recurrent droughts, persistent poverty and political instability.\"</p> <p>The Sahel crisis is about much more than rain, or lack of it. Yes, in the years when the rains fail more people are pushed into hunger, but the NGO message is that this is something that will take years to fix. \"Deep-rooted change is what is needed, not just a good harvest,\" says Denise Brown, head of the World Food Programme (WFP) in Niger.</p> <p>Three droughts since 2005 have left millions of families locked out of the food-production cycle. Almost everyone in the region has lost animals, and many have been unable to buy seed for replanting. When crops fail, some families are unable to find the cash to buy supplementary food on the market as prices have been pushed so high. It is thought that the long-term development of millions of children is being affected by \"stunting\", caused by a poor diet over many years.</p> <p>These chronic problems need sustained solutions. Efforts to change farming practices to promote irrigation and protection of water sources must go hand in hand with education, the promotion of women's rights, teaching people about child nutrition, and long-term efforts to promote drought-resistant crop varieties and the creation of grain stores. Initiatives such as Niger's <a href=\"http://reliefweb.int/report/niger/national-strategy-against-famine\" title=\"\">Trois N</a>'s are homegrown attempts to tackle chronic food security in all its aspects.</p> <p>\"One good harvest doesn't lead automatically to self-sufficiency in food production,\" says Mamadou Diop from Action Against Hunger, ACF International in Bamako. \"It's hard to explain to donors that there are people who have basically been living with malnourishment for many years, even when the harvest has been 'normal'.\"</p> <p>And while things may be looking fairly positive in Niger \u2013 where the government of President Mahamadou Issoufou, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/mar/22/niger-election-tandja-issoufou-chatelot\" title=\"\">in place since April 2011</a>, has tried to show itself to be committed to tackling food insecurity \u2013 the picture is not so rosy elsewhere. The political crisis in neighbouring <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/jul/13/international-response-mali-inadequate\" title=\"\">Mali has only compounded the hunger problem</a>. More than 300,000 people have been displaced in the Islamist takeover of the north, leaving behind animals and untended fields and fleeing to refugee camps, where they depend on handouts.</p> <p>\"Displaced people cannot plant their seeds, and have no access to money to buy food,\" says Mbacke Niang, Oxfam's country director in Bamako. \"Security and logistics for us in the north have become so much more complicated since the collapse of government authority there.\"</p> <p>Overall, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/global-development/2012/mar/09/urgent-action-sahel-humanitarian-emergecny\" title=\"\">the donor response to the 2011-12 Sahel appeal</a> has been quite good. Nearly 60% of the funds required have been provided so far. Although there has been an obvious peak in the number of malnourished under-fives being treated in hospitals across the whole region, anecdotal evidence suggests the numbers have been below the 1 million severely acutely malnourished babies predicted by NGOs earlier in the year. The worst of the lean season is now over, and the first harvest is about to be collected.</p> <p>This seeming success may be attributable to aid agencies sounding the alarm early at the end of 2011 \u2013 in part because many had been <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/global-development/2012/feb/16/east-africa-crisis-response-effective-not-fast\" title=\"\">stung by criticisms of a late response to last year's famine in Somalia</a>. And, according to Brown, the aid effort was co-ordinated. \"Everybody played their role \u2013 there was no squabbling between NGOs, and the parameters of intervention were clear. High-level visits are still going on, and donors can see a glimmer of hope here.\"</p>"
