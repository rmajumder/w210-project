  "<p>The cash machines in Santiago are running out of money, but it is not a run on the banks; shoppers in Chile are simply spending peso notes faster than the automated tellers can provide them. New skyscrapers are rising up in Bogot\u00e1 to create the office and retail space needed by a growing economy. Mexico \u2013 the new darling of foreign investors \u2013 is outstripping GDP forecasts. Brazil, which overtook the UK as the world's sixth biggest economy last year, has just announced a $66bn (\u00a342bn) stimulus plan in addition to the money it will splash out in preparation for the 2014 World Cup and the Olympics in 2016.</p> <p>The economic mood music in Latin America for most of this year could hardly have been more of a contrast from that of the EU, mired in financial crisis, depressed by austerity, and dipping back into recession.</p> <p>Latin America is now being retuned, as most nations expect slower but still solid growth, and some prepare to tap extensive reserves to spend their way out of a global downturn.</p> <p>Their ability to withstand the coming storm will have long-term implications for perceptions of a region that was until recently a byword for financial turbulence, irresponsible spending and whimsical policies. Recently, many of the region's governments have been praised by the UN, IMF and World Bank for building strong reserves and maintaining generally low levels of public debt.</p> <p>This gives them more scope to open the fiscal stimulus taps when the economy starts to flag, as Brazil did on Wednesday with the announcement of a R$133bn (\u00a342bn) stimulus package. If they can avoid the worst impacts of the international crisis without sinking into debt \u2013 as most nations here did in 2008 \u2013 it would reinforce a growing reputation for prudent economic management.</p> <p>Several strong years of growth in the strongest performing economies have created a visible momentum. In Santiago, soaring housing prices, hundreds of new restaurants and thickets of cranes on the skyline suggest the Chilean economy has coasted through the early stages of the latest crisis. Car sales soared so high last year that at one point the government ran out of licence plates and was forced to issue cardboard substitutes while hastily stamping out another round of metal license plates.</p> <p>With an estimated GDP growth this year of 4.5%, plus hefty government reserves, Chile is prepared to weather potential fallout from Europe. \"We have a pretty comfortable position to face challenges in 2012,\" budget director Rosanna Costa told reporters in Santiago this year. The government sits on an estimated $14bn stabilisation fund that can be used to stimulate the economy via public works projects or cash infusions, as needed.</p> <p>Peru is also enjoying steady expansion, while Venezuela, buoyed by oil sales and a pre-election spending binge by Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, is expected to grow by more than 5%, though its ability to pay its bills will depend on high oil prices.</p> <p>There are some significant exceptions to these trends. Argentina's economy has ground to a halt in the wake of the nationalisation of local assets owned by Spanish oil company YPF, indicating the still strong influence of global financial markets in Latin America.</p> <p>Even so, the region is expected to grow by 3-4% this year \u2013 a bonanza compared with the depression that afflicts the Latin nations in the old world. Portugal, Spain and Italy were among the worst-performing nations when the EU announced this week that the GDP of the eurozone fell 0.2% in the latest quarter.</p> <p>The contrasts are striking. While Spain has been begging for bailouts, Juan Carlos Echeverry, the finance minister of its former colony Colombia, this year boasted his government \"didn't need more revenue\". Thanks to rising rates of inward investment, falling&#xa0;unemployment and annual growth of 4.5% for more than a decade, his state's finances are thought to be in good shape to withstand the fallout from Europe.</p> <p>Although the mood has darkened in recent months, new symbols of affluence are being built. Colombia is erecting its tallest skyscraper, the 66-storey BD Bacat\u00e1 building, which will house a shopping mall, office space and up-market apartments.</p> <p>The Spanish property tycoon behind the project, Venerando Lamelas, said he was moving with the times. \"The European market is not doing well. Latin America is very important and within Latin America the best market is Colombia,\" he told a local newspaper.</p> <p>Others are following the opportunities across the Atlantic. Gonzalo Rodriguez recently gave up his job in Spain as a bond-market trader and moved to Brazil to work for an energy company designing power transmission lines for wind farms.</p> <p>\"I'm not earning as much here as I did in Spain, but I'm thinking five years ahead,\" the 25-year-old said in Copacabana. \"There is 100% more growth potential in Brazilian energy than in Spanish banks. There are lots of talented people in Spain not finding jobs. Here, it is the opposite. They don't have enough qualified people.\"</p> <p>Such optimism will be tested in the months ahead. Brazil has been hit harder than any other country by the downturn overseas \u2013 particularly weakening Chinese demand for commodities. It is likely to grow more slowly this year \u2013 about 2-3% \u2013 than any of the other big regional economies, prompting President Dilma Rousseff to unveil Wednesday's hefty stimulus package.</p> <p>Unlike in the past, however, it has the money to spend. Brazil's international reserves have swollen from $38bn in 2002 to more than $370bn, which is a substantial war chest to fend off global crisis.</p> <p>\"In years past, when the world sneezed, we caught pneumonia. That's no longer the case,\" Rousseff said this year. \"I can assure you, Brazil is 100%, 200%, 300% ready.\"</p> <p>Many economists question whether Brazil and the region as a whole will prove as resilient this time. Strong demand from China for soy, oil, copper and other commodities helped Latin America coast through the 2008-09 crisis. This time, with China slowing, it will have to dig deeper into its reserves. Although government finances are far stronger than they were in the 80s and 90s, the big question is whether it has invested enough in human capital.</p> <p>\"Important jobs here in Brazil are now being filled by Europeans, especially from Spain and Portugal,\" said Nelson de Sousa, a finance lecturer at management school Ibmec. \"We have not put enough into education and training. That is our great difficulty and one that is very different from the problems faced by Europe.</p> <p>\"The Brazilian government spends a lot, but badly. Dilma is aware of that, but there is a big difference between knowing what to do and being able to do it.\"</p> <p>If she \u2013 and other leaders in the region \u2013 succeed, however, a lot more than the Olympic torch may pass this year from Europe to Latin America.</p> <p>\u2022 The headline was changed on 16 August 2012</p>",
  "<p>Britain has told the Ecuadorean authorities it believes officials can enter its embassy in London and arrest Julian Assange, the founder of WikiLeaks, according to Ecuador's minister for foreign affairs, Ricardo Patino.</p> <p>The development came two months after Assange walked into the embassy in a bid to avoid being extradited to Sweden where he faces allegations of sexual assault.</p> <p>At a news conference on Wednesday, Patino said Ecuador would announce its decision regarding Assange's asylum request at 7am (noon GMT) on Thursday.</p> <p>Patino also released details of a letter he said was delivered through a British embassy official in Quito, the capital of Ecuador.</p> <p>The letter said: \"You need to be aware that there is a legal base in the UK, the Diplomatic and Consular Premises Act 1987, that would allow us to take actions in order to arrest Mr Assange in the current premises of the Embassy.\"</p> <p>The letter added: \"We need to reiterate that we consider the continued use of the diplomatic premises in this way incompatible with the Vienna Convention and unsustainable and we have made clear the serious implications that this has for our diplomatic relations.\"</p> <p>An Ecuadorean government spokesman said: \"We are deeply shocked by the British government's threats against the sovereignty of the Ecuadorean embassy and their suggestion that they may forcibly enter the embassy.</p> <p>\"This a clear breach of international law and the protocols set out in the Vienna Convention.</p> <p>\"Throughout out the last 56 days Mr Julian Assange has been in the Embassy, the Ecuadorean government has acted honourably in all our attempts to seek a resolution to the situation.</p> <p>\"This stands in stark contrast to the escalation of the British government today with their threats to break down the door of the Ecuadorean embassy.</p> <p>\"Instead of threatening violence against the Ecuadorean embassy, the British government should use its energy to find a peaceful resolution to this situation which we are aiming to achieve.\"</p> <p>A Foreign Office spokeswoman said: \"We have consistently made our position clear in our discussions with the government of Ecuador.</p> <p>\"The UK has a legal obligation to extradite Mr Assange to Sweden to face questioning over allegations of sexual offences and we remain determined to fulfil this obligation.</p> <p>\"We have an obligation to extradite Mr Assange and it is only right that we give Ecuador the full picture.</p> <p>\"Throughout this process we have drawn the Ecuadoreans' attention to relevant provisions of our law, whether, for example, the extensive human rights safeguards in our extradition procedures, or the legal status of diplomatic premises in the UK.</p> <p>\"We are still committed to reaching a mutually acceptable solution.\"</p> <p>Assange denies the allegations against him, but fears he will be sent to the United States if he goes to Sweden.</p> <p>An offer to the Swedish authorities by Ecuador for investigators to interview Assange inside the London embassy was rejected.</p>",
  "<p>This week should be a time for sighs of relief and back slapping in Australia's parliament. After almost a year of political stalemate on asylum seekers, federal politicians <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/13/australia-asylum-seekers-pacific-islands\" title=\"\">have agreed to send</a> those who try to reach Australia by boat to Nauru and Papua New Guinea. The vote passed the house of representatives today and is expected to pass the Senate on Thursday. But despite prime minister Julia Gillard declaring that \"this house has risen above the politics of this issue and taken clear action to save lives,\" many Australians feel deflated and a bit embarrassed by their parliament.</p> <p>Australia has seen \"unauthorised boat arrivals\" sky rocket in recent months. So far this year, more than 7,900 people have arrived in Australian waters. This compares to about 4,500 people for the whole of 2011. It also compares to the handful of boats that arrived after former prime minister John Howard's government instituted tough border protection measures in 2001 \u2013 including \"offshore processing\" (measures Labor took great pleasure in dismantling after it won office in 2007). More worrying has been the number of people who have died when their boats failed to make the journey from Indonesia to Australia.</p> <p>While progressives have argued for years against sending asylum seekers offshore \u2013 with concerns about detention standards and human rights protections \u2013 many now agree that people must be discouraged from making what is a proven risky journey to Australia on boats. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jun/22/asylum-seekers-missing-boat-capsizes?intcmp=239\" title=\"\">An estimated 90 people died when their boat sank in June</a>. A week later, an estimated four people died when another boat ran into trouble.</p> <p>And Australians are still chilled by images of a boat that disintegrated off the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/dec/15/asylum-seeker-boats-capsizes-australia-christmas-island\" title=\"\">coast of Christmas Island</a> in December 2010, killing about 50 people. After the second June boat disaster this year, parliament sat into the night trying to legislate its way to a response. Indeed, politicians from all sides earnestly agreed that something needed to be done. In extraordinary scenes, some even broke down in tears as they told stories about the plight of asylum seekers. Yet, when parliament rose in late June for a six-week winter break, it had failed to agree upon a solution.</p> <p>In a nutshell, the Labor government wanted to send boat arrivals to Malaysia, which it had been advocating for more than a year. The opposition said it would only send asylum seekers to countries that were signatories to the <a href=\"http://www.unhcr.org/pages/49da0e466.html\" title=\"\">UN refugee convention</a>, such as Nauru and Papua New Guinea. The Greens, who hold the balance of power in the Senate, were opposed to offshore processing full stop. Labor then said it would agree to Nauru and Papua New Guinea (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2012/aug/13/australia-refugees-offshore-processing-video\" title=\"\">Manus Island</a>) on top of Malaysia, but the coalition refused to compromise on Malaysia.</p> <p>So much for all the special meetings, sombre press conferences, cross-parliamentary groups and emotional speeches. Needless to say, the Australian public was disgusted. A poll in July found that people blamed all parties for the standoff. Another poll found that only 11% of respondents thought politicians were \"genuinely concerned\" about asylum seekers.</p> <p>To break the impasse, Gillard commissioned an independent report, headed up by respected former defence chief, <a href=\"http://www.heraldsun.com.au/opinion/report-gives-our-leaders-a-fail/story-e6frfhqf-1226449573681\" title=\"\">Angus Houston</a>. In the meantime, both the government and the opposition kept blaming each other over boat arrivals, which continued at a steady pace. This week, Houston handed down his report, which among other things, recommended offshore processing on Nauru and Manus Island. It didn't recommend Malaysia for now, saying the government needed to do more work to boost human rights protections.</p> <p>Everyone claimed the findings as a victory. But (as the government hoped) it has been enough to see parliament finally reach a compromise. In some ways, it is a victory to have any form of agreement. But that hasn't stopped the bitter politicking. The coalition has not wasted the opportunity this week to have a go at Labor \u2013 holding up the vote in the lower house so some 40 speakers could criticise Labor for \"backflipping\" on border protection and for not adopting more of the coalition's policies.</p> <p>The opposition leader, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Abbott\" title=\"\">Tony Abbott</a>, has also suggested that Gillard was responsible for the deaths that occurred at sea. Meanwhile, almost five years after John Howard was voted out of office, Australia is clamouring to reinstall (some of) the policies that made him so unpopular. Refugee advocates are furious. As the Asylum Seeker Resource Centre's Pamela Curr said: \"People will still drown\u2026 It's just that we won't see them drown.\"</p> <p>And yet, the sheer number of boats and the risks that involves, means Australia has to try something different. Even if it is eerily similar to what we've done before.</p>",
  "<p>Despite her best efforts, Zahia Dehar is still best known in France as a footballer's birthday present. The 20-year-old surprise new muse and protege of the fashion designer Karl Lagerfeld was not long ago a teenage, underaged prostitute who met clients in VIP bars around Paris's Champs-Elys\u00e9es while her mother apparently thought she was at sleepovers with schoolfriends, and was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/14/ribery-benzema-underaged-prostitution-trial\" title=\"\">paid for sex by one of France's most famous football stars</a>.</p> <p>In 2009, she was flown to Munich for a night in a luxury hotel by the French international football star Franck Rib\u00e9ry, allegedly as&#xa0;a birthday treat for himself to mark his 26th. At the time, he was a&#xa0;winger for Bayern Munich earning a stratospheric salary, a French national hero with a seemingly unshakable image back home as a funny, ugly Mr Wholesome, who had dragged himself up from a deprived early life on one of the poorest estates in northern France, was disfigured by a&#xa0;childhood carcrash, married his childhood sweetheart, was a good dad and an observant convert to&#xa0;Islam who symbolised the mixed identities of France. Then it emerged that Dehar had been quietly flown over to Germany to order by Rib\u00e9ry when she was aged only 17. Paid-for sex is illegal below the age of 18 in France.</p> <p>Birthdaygate, revealed as part of a police investigation into alleged pimping, became part of one of the biggest sex scandals ever to hit French sport, tarnishing French football and hindering the French team during its fraught South Africa World Cup in 2010. But the case is back on the front pages this week as Rib\u00e9ry, and his French team-mate, the Real Madrid star striker Karim Benzema, who allegedly paid for sex with Dehar on another occasion, have been ordered to stand trial for soliciting an underage prostitute. Also in the dock will be an array of men and women, some accused of \"aggravated pimping\".</p> <p>The case is the latest high-profile inquiry involving celebrities and the&#xa0;issue of paid-for sex in France. Dominique Strauss-Kahn, former head of the IMF and one-time presidential hopeful, is currently under formal investigation over complicity in a pimping operation after women linked to a suspected Lille prostitution ring were allegedly procured for orgies he attended. The inquiry has been extended to examine alleged group rape over the question of whether one sex-worker was forced. Strauss-Kahn's lawyers argue he did not know the women were paid. He denies any violence.</p> <p>As for Rib\u00e9ry and Benzema, the judge's order that their case should go&#xa0;to the criminal court has shocked France. Last November, the state prosecutor recommended charges be dropped, stating that neither man had known Dehar was under 18. The trial promises to lift the lid on a disturbing world of money, minors and paid-for sex just as the new French women's minister stresses her ambition to \"abolish\" prostitution from France. But the saga is also an insight into modern-day celebrity culture in France, the grim underbelly of Champs-Elys\u00e9es bars, modern immigration and young people from the rundown suburbs who make it big.</p> <p>Perhaps the strangest element of all is Dehar herself, who is now so famous she is known only by her first name. Since the story broke, she has been taken under the wing of Lagerfeld and&#xa0;other big fashion and art names, encouraged in a new career path as a luxury lingerie designer, staging elaborate catwalk shows in Paris fashion week. Her pieces are crafted by the top haute-couture artisans, and French actors have taken frontrow seats to watch models emerge from fridges and&#xa0;cupcakes, or ironically wrapped in&#xa0;ribbons as gifts, and Dehar herself emerging as a giant Barbie clone from a plastic box. She has been photographed by the artists Pierre et Gilles and David LaChapelle and held exhibitions of works inspired by her, including metal mouldings of her body. With a shock of peroxide blonde hair extensions, she has made the cover of international magazines, styled like an Algerian-born reinvention of Brigitte Bardot. She has also starred in a <a href=\"http://www.fhm.com/girls/news/exclusive-weird-and-sexy-zahia-dehar-video-81265\" title=\"\">short film as a Frankenstein's monster-like sex-object</a> invented by men in white coats.</p> <p>Lagerfeld says she is so fascinating precisely because she is a reminder of France's 18th-century courtesans, the paid mistresses of the rich and powerful, \"a purely French tradition that the whole world admired and copied\".</p> <p>All this poses a quandary for feminists. On the one hand, why shouldn't a former sex-worker be able to launch a fashion career and move on? But then her constant packaging as pneumatic sex-doll seems to glamorise and glorify what the trial could starkly reveal as illegal pimping and underage sex. Designers and gallery owners insist she&#xa0;embodies \"French gallantry\" and \"her body is a language\".</p> <p>As Dehar tells it, at 5pm one day in April three years ago, police officers arrived at her mother and stepfather's modest home in a grey, nondescript suburb of Paris, asking to question her. For months, the vice squad had been investigating allegations of pimping at one of the bars around the Champs-Elys\u00e9es, the Zaman Cafe, when they realised one of the women on their radar, Dehar, was a minor. Prostitution is legal in France but, as in the UK, activities around it \u2013 pimping, soliciting, brothels and running organised networks \u2013 are not. In the case of prostitution, a young person is a minor until&#xa0;18.</p> <p>Police had placed men suspected of pimping under phone surveillance and told Dehar they knew details of her \"activity\". Her mother and stepfather apparently did not. Born in the Algerian town of Ghriss, Dehar arrived in France with her mother and one of her brothers when she was 10, speaking no French, after her parents' messy divorce. She has hinted at difficult years with nowhere to stay at first and \"sad moments\" at the hands of \"bad, cruel\" family contacts in France, <a href=\"http://next.liberation.fr/mode/01012388449-les-1001-vies-de-zahia\" title=\"\">once telling Lib\u00e9ration</a>: \"If I talk too much about it, I'll come over as a depressive.\" In Algeria, she enjoyed primary school and wanted to be a pilot; in France, she bunked off, quit school and enrolled in a beauty course. She began going to bars off the Champs-Elys\u00e9es at the age of 14. She <a href=\"http://www.parismatch.com/People-Match/Sport/Actu/Exclusif-Zahia.-L-interview-integrale-182834/\" title=\"\">told Paris Match</a> her first paid-for sex was with a client celebrating his birthday; she had celebrated her 16th shortly before. She said she charged \u20ac2,000 a night or \u20ac500 for a \"moment of pleasure\". She said she thought of herself as \"an escort girl, not a prostitute\", arguing she was \"never part of a&#xa0;network. I don't give my money to anyone. I do what I want, I have paid or&#xa0;unpaid sex with who I want. No one makes me and when I don't want to, it's no.\" She referred to men who pointed her towards \"big clients\" not as pimps, but friends.</p> <p>She told police her first football star client was Benzema, who was born to Algerian parents and grew up on an estate in Lyon. She said they met in a Paris nightclub when he was 18. The alleged paid-for sex took place in 2008 when she was 16 and he was 20. Benzema's lawyers say he is \"innocent\" and would explain himself in court.</p> <p>Dehar said Rib\u00e9ry had first flown her to Munich, paying for flights and a hotel for his birthday night, and then met her twice again in France when, she told Paris Match: \"It was hard to get him to pay me, but he did all the same.\" Asked by the magazine whether he had been \"kind\" to her, she said: \"I gave him what he wanted. He wasn't particularly gallant, nor polite, nor even that nice. I&#xa0;came to do my work.\" He was \"a client like any other\".</p> <p>Crucially, Dehar told investigators neither footballer had known her age.</p> <p>Rib\u00e9ry's lawyer this week said that sending the case to trial was \"surprising and unfair\", arguing that Rib\u00e9ry did not know Dehar was underage at the time. During the investigation, Rib\u00e9ry, whose image has suffered hugely and who complained his family had been hurt by the case, told the German paper Bild he wasn't scared about his future or career because: \"I never knowingly did anything wrong.\"</p> <p>When the announcement of the trial came this week, Dehar's lawyer said it was \"neither good nor bad news\" for her. She had moved on. Her first underwear collection \u2013 the production of which was funded by an Asian investment company \u2013 will go on sale in January. More exhibitions are planned. And the French actor Isabelle Adjani wants to make a documentary film about her, declaring herself firmly \"in the camp of those who want to love her\" and saying Dehar's path to fame had been \"moving and troubling\".</p> <p>Her latest press release describes her as \"Zahia, an artist, a stylist, a muse, and soon an icon\". She is promoted as a quintessential example of the best of \"made in France\". Over the past few weeks, she has tweeted pictures of her body in a red bikini in southern France. Earlier this year, sitting in her plush rented Paris apartment on a sofa shaped like a pair of red lips for an interview for Lib\u00e9ration, she came across as shy, soft-spoken and only really relaxed in the presence of her lapdogs. She and her PR consultant brushed aside questions about whether some kind of rich benefactor is funding her new life. She&#xa0;said her two years selling sex were firmly over. Asked why she did it, she paused and replied: \"For the money\". Her agent interjected: \"But also for the social advancement, eh, Zahia? A way to get on in life?\" The journalist asked if she was irritated by always being reduced to sex, to being a sex symbol. Dehar replied: \"Me, I&#xa0;don't know what&#xa0;I am, in fact. It's&#xa0;other people who know \u2026\"</p>",
  "<p>Throughout its Olympics coverage the BBC kept slipping in long trailers for its autumn schedules between events. The message was implicit: we know we're serving up a whole load of dross right now to anyone who isn't interested in sport, but stick with us and after the Games you will be in for untold treats. How quickly those promises are broken; when the highlight of the evening is a new series \u2013 the ninth \u2013 of <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b007t575\" title=\"\"><strong>Who Do You Think You Are?</strong></a> (BBC1), then you know the feelgood factor is already starting to flag.</p> <p>When it started back in 2004, the genealogy series felt fresh, offering unusual insights into the backstories of well-known personalities; but now it all just seems rather formulaic and manipulative. We know there are going to be whoops of joy and tears of sadness, as the production team has already done its research and eliminated any celeb whose ancestry is just too dull for television. So rather than going on a journey of discovery into the past with someone, it feels more like being led by the nose into a number of contrived set-pieces.</p> <p>Last night's episode had plenty of whoops and tears as Samantha Womack \u2013 best known as Ronnie Mitchell in EastEnders \u2013 found out that her great-grandfather had been jailed for nicking a cornet (the instrument, not the ice-cream) before being wounded in the first world war, and that her great-grandmother had been put in an orphanage after her mother went to America, but little sense of reward for anyone but her. Womack just isn't important enough to me to get emotionally involved with her great-grandparents for an hour. This isn't her fault, but it is a problem.</p> <p>I also couldn't help feeling that the most fascinating aspects of Womack's life were to be found in her more recent past. What made her change her stage name from Samantha Janus to Samantha Womack? What part of her life did she want to forget? For a programme that trades on disappearance and reinvention, these seemed like reasonable questions to expect some answers to.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p00w5plf\" title=\"\"><strong>The Flowerpot Gang</strong></a> (BBC1) was nominally a brand new show, though it felt like one I had seen dozens of times before and wasn't in any hurry to see again \u2013 a hybrid of Challenge Anneka and Ground Force, in which Anneka Rice, looking so similar to how she did 20 years ago that I wondered if she was a hologram, reprised her role as the country's jolly hockey-sticks head girl. Joe Swift did the garden design, while Phil Tufnell came along for the ride and made a few jokes that were beyond&#xa0;feeble.</p> <p>Over the course of the programme, the gang, along with some local volunteers, transformed the garden of a Sheffield care home for people with dementia into an accessible outdoor space, so it feels somewhat mean-spirited to be too critical. But it was a desperately dull hour of padded-out TV; the sort of programme that might just do as a Sunday afternoon filler, but had no place on a weekday primetime slot. Not that I want to deter television personalities from getting involved in worthwhile community projects; I would just rather they did so when there are no cameras around.</p> <p>No matter how many documentaries I watch about the Nazi death camps, they never lose the power to shock, partly because of the subject matter but also because filmmakers are always looking for new ways to tell similar stories. <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01m1l9w\" title=\"\"><strong>Death Camp Treblinka: Survivor Stories</strong></a> (BBC4) gave a voice to the two remaining survivors, Kalman Taigman and Samuel Willenberg, of the 875,000 Jews and Gypsies who were sent to Treblinka in 1941-2. That they are both in their 80s and may not be around much longer only made their testimonies more compelling.</p> <p>As so often, though, it was the passing details that had the most impact: Willenberg finding the coats of his two younger sisters among the personal effects of the dead he had been made to sort through by the Nazis; being asked by a wounded fellow escapee to kill him rather than let him be recaptured \u2013 and doing it. Unbearable. Perhaps the most disturbing footage, though, was the film shot by the Nazis themselves as a record of daily life in Treblinka \u2013 not for what it showed, so much as what it implied: that the Holocaust would one day be seen as something to be celebrated, not hidden.</p>",
  "<p>Moving from Auntie Beeb to the Gray Lady may have a pleasing ring. But that Mark Thompson can swap the director general's chair of the BBC for a Manhattan chief executive's office also marks a significant, generational shift: it is the moment when global and technological convergence has reached the point where it is possible for the leader of Britain's public-service broadcaster to land a $5m-a-year job as boss of the company behind the New York Times, the most famous newspaper in the US.</p> <p>The appointment also represents a substantial personal endorsement of the 55-year-old Briton and his stewardship of the BBC. While enjoying the benefits of guaranteed licence-fee funding to the tune of \u00a33.6bn a year, he has nevertheless proven able to develop the corporation digitally (selling Doctor Who episodes via iTunes overseas), maintain quality on screen despite lapses over phone-ins and taste, and navigate constant political pressure led by the Murdoch press.</p> <p>Not since Sir William Haley left the BBC in 1952 to become editor of the Times has a DG quit for a job in newspapers \u2013 and none has gone to America. The early days of broadcasting might have seen senior executives moving between the two, but as television developed, the fissure between print and broadcast widened \u2013 until the internet turned everything on its head.</p> <p>Today, the lines of competition have blurred. The BBC's generously funded website competes with a press trying to embrace multimedia \u2013 and the cash available at the BBC has helped give its executives a digital background that newspapers can only eye with jealousy.</p> <p>It was once felt that the BBC was closer to publicly funded arts organisations than red-blooded commercial media: a decade ago, Tony Hall left BBC News to run the Royal Opera House. Now, though, life after the BBC looks very different. Last year, another former senior BBC manager, Ashley Highfield, who led the development of the iPlayer, which had transformed the viewing habits of a nation, became the chief executive of Johnston Press, the newspaper group that owns the Scotsman and the Yorkshire Post.</p> <p>When Thompson arrived at the top of the BBC eight years ago, it was at a high-profile national organisation in some peril, with both its chairman and his predecessor, Greg Dyke, having resigned. The New York Times occupies a similar position in the US imagination, and faces financial pressures that have forced it to sell regional newspapers and stakes in sport clubs, including Liverpool FC, to concentrate on a handful of brands \u2013 the New York Times itself, the Boston Globe and the International Herald Tribune.</p> <p>Thompson's final interview was in early July, to give him plenty of time to concentrate on the Olympics. At the heart of his pitch for the job was to emphasise the importance of video journalism, and of taking a professional approach to its production. Print, he believes, will still be the New York Times's principal means of transmitting information, but with 509,000 online subscribers to serve, a newspaper now needs to tell stories using cameras and the techniques of a John Simpson or Jeremy Paxman. In time, perhaps, the newspaper may create its own TV channel \u2013 transmitted, perhaps, via YouTube rather than over cable or satellite.</p> <p>It was part of what Arthur Sulzberger, the chairman and controlling shareholder in the New York Times Company, wanted to hear. The New York Times also wants to extend its brand overseas \u2013 the paper has just launched a digital edition in Mandarin, following an online version aimed at India the year before \u2013 and having a non-American in charge is one way to ensure that the paper develops from its roots as a big city newspaper into a news brand with a global reach and audience to match. Although recently overtaken by the celebrity-heavy Daily Mail as the world's leading online newspaper, the New York Times remains, by some distance, the most-read upmarket title.</p> <p>Journalists on the ground say they couldn't care less that Thompson is not from their side of the Atlantic. David Carr, a media columnist at the New York Times, says: \"The days of provincialism around geography, or platform for that matter, are long past. The NYT is in the global information business, this guy has shown an ability to build and manage news enterprises at that scale, so his background seems relevant to the task at hand\" \u2013 even if, he adds, the new leader pronounces the word \"schedule\" differently.</p> <p>Those close to the selection process in New York say that there was no single factor that swung the decision in Thompson's favour. The critics were quick to point out that the BBC man has not had any experience running a profit-making company, apart perhaps from a short stint running state-owned, advertiser-funded Channel 4 in the early part of the last decade. But Thompson's allies point to the rapid growth of BBC Worldwide, the commercial arm that exploits BBC brands for profit, and in particular its digital revenues, which amounted to \u00a3139m last year.</p> <p>Digital, for BBC Worldwide, also sees content being streamed into the US, meaning that BBC content is becoming gradually more visible in that country too. BBC Worldwide also distributed E4's Misfits, which became a surprise hit on Hulu, a US internet television service, last year. For his part, Thompson believes that his most important challenge at the New York Times will be to replace declining print advertising revenues with digital income, at a time when the number of web subscriptions and page views demonstrate the audience for journalism is, if anything, growing.</p> <p>The outgoing BBC boss, meanwhile, believes that the corporation's coverage of the Olympics, through 24 dedicated digital channels and bespoke apps to stream Games video to tablets and mobiles, represents the apotheosis of his achievement at the corporation. Opinion polls even suggest that public approval of the BBC rose as a result of the Games \u2013 by a higher proportion than the Queen, Boris Johnson or even the city of London itself \u2013 and while Thompson acknowledges that he cannot easily take credit for any specific aspect of the Olympics broadcasts, he was a keen enthusiast of ensuring that every moment of sporting action was covered live.</p> <p>That meant the BBC striking a commercial deal with its traditional rival Sky, a deal in which the Murdoch-influenced satellite broadcaster ended up promoting the corporation's Olympic content on and off air.</p> <p>But Thompson was being wooed well before the Olympics. His first contact with Sulzberger was in January, just as it emerged he was planning to leave the BBC later in the year later in the year. His relationship with the 60-year-old chairman will be critical, not least because, as publisher of the New York Times, Sulzberger has a hand in editorial appointments that Thompson himself will be denied. But with the Briton no stranger to navigating complex internal governance, he is hopeful that he can strike up a relationship that will allow him to have an impact. As a start, Thompson has already met with other key members of the Sulzberger family, before his final interview with the company's board took place in the early part of last month.</p> <p>The decision, though, did not come through until the middle of the Games, perhaps as the first British athletics gold medals came through \u2013 although final negotiations over pay ensured that his appointment was kept quiet long enough for the closing ceremony to conclude and the Briton to fly over to New York on Tuesday. The distance between London and New York, just as between television and newspapers, public and private media, has never felt closer.</p> <h2>Media stars who shine brightly across the Atlantic</h2> <p><strong>Lucian Grainge, chief executive, </strong></p> <p><strong>Universal Music Group</strong></p> <p>Once described as the \"killer shark\" because of his competitive instincts, Grainge runs the world's biggest music company from Los Angeles rather than the company's traditional HQ in New York. Chief executive Doug Morris, who now runs rival Sony Music, was eased out by Universal's owner to clear the way for Grainge, an Arsenal fan, in 2011. Grainge, 52, is now embroiled in a battle to complete the \u00a31.2bn takeover of EMI Music and is locked in negotiations with European and US regulators.</p> <p><strong>Anna Wintour, editor in chief, Vogue</strong></p> <p>The eldest daughter of Charles Wintour, a former editor of the London Evening Standard, Wintour has edited Vogue for 24 years and is the most influential \u2013 and best known \u2013 name in fashion journalism. The demanding personality of the so-called \"ice queen\", now 62, was fictionalised in The Devil Wears Prada, but her energetic fundraising efforts for Barack Obama have led to reports that she could be named US ambassador to London if the president is re-elected.</p> <p><strong>Tina Brown, editor in chief, the Daily Beast and Newsweek</strong></p> <p>Journalist Brown moved to New York with husband Harold Evans after he left the Times. She edited a succession of magazines, starting with Vanity Fair and the New Yorker, before founding the short-lived Talk.

Thirty years at CBS saw him rise to the top before he switched to run Sony's US interests \u2013 its film studio and music company \u2013 in 1997 and earned the title of the most influential Briton in Hollywood. Stringer, 70, was chief executive of Sony between 2005 and 2012 and remains chairman.

  "<p>A country born out of crisis and hewn ever since by uncertainty takes a lot to unsettle. But more than 20 years after its civil war ended, Lebanon is again being forced to confront one of its most pervasive fears: sectarian kidnappings.</p> <p>More than 20 people were kidnapped on Wednesday including a Turk, a Saudi and several Syrians, by members of a prominent Shia family, the Mikdad clan, from the Bekaa valley, not far from the Syrian border.</p> <p>The men were seized in retaliation to the kidnapping in the past few days of one of their own inside Syria, Hassan Salim al-Mikdad. His captors insist <strong> </strong>Mikdad is a member of the Lebanese militia and political bloc Hezbollah, a claim the group has strongly denied.</p> <p>The Mikdad family also confirmed it had kidnapped a Turkish national soon after he arrived at Beirut airport. The man's passport was later given to a local TV station, which broadcast an image. However, Turkish officials are yet to shed light on the claims.</p> <p>Saudi Arabia, Qatar, the UAE and Kuwait responded to the mass kidnapping by telling their citizens to leave Lebanon immediately.</p> <p>Wednesday's developments, and the forced videotaped confessions that accompanied them, have stirred the ghosts of a past that most Lebanese are trying hard to forget. The turmoil in neighbouring Syria is showing that the civil war-era enmity, long since disavowed in Lebanon, remains more of a problem than many here want to acknowledge.</p> <p>And so, too, do the issues that have plagued Lebanon since its own savage 15-year conflict ran out of steam: a political class that remains implacably divided, a government that cannot assert its sovereignty and an entrenched system of sectarian patronage that cannot allow a representative nation state to rise from the ruins of war.</p> <p>\"I don't want it to become like 1985 again,\" said Sajida Fahm, in central Beirut. \"People want the Sunnis and the Shia to fight again. We can't be led around like this. Where is the state?\"</p> <p>As the Syrian uprising has morphed into full-blown civil war, Lebanon has been fruitlessly looking for ways to safeguard itself from what many people believe will be an inevitable spillover. The giant police state to the east was seen by some Lebanese as a pillar of stability \u2013 despite the enormous influence that was inevitably yielded to Syrian officials.</p> <p>With Syria now teetering, there is a growing fear among all layers of Lebanese society that nothing can be done to save the country from turmoil. And this time, say many Lebanese from all walks contacted in recent weeks, it feels different to the lead-up to the civil war, or any phase of it from its eruption in 1975 to its gradual end in 1990.</p> <p>Even members of the Lebanese establishment, long accustomed to the byzantine ways of the region and the vagaries of life in a rough neighbourhood, say a potentially historic \u2013 and dangerous \u2013 shift is underway.</p> <p>\"This is the unravelling of the Sykes-Picot agreement,\" said Walid Jumblatt, the leader of Lebanon's Druze sect, in reference to the secret agreement between the British and French in 1916, which carved up the Levant into spheres of influence in the wake of the Ottoman empire's demise. \"We are seeing the end of what was created 90 years ago. The consequences will be very, very, grave unless they are managed properly.\"</p> <p>Syria was stitched together as a nation state between the end of the first world war and the start of the second. And Lebanon's development as a country followed roughly the same timeframe.</p> <p>However, neither state \u2013 and especially Lebanon \u2013 has ever been truly comfortable in its own borders, or skin. Both are patchworks of sects that have often been at odds with each other and which are very much affected by regional dynamics.</p> <p>\"These agreements are breaking down,\" said Jumblatt. \"The Alawites could move into the north of their country and establish a homeland near Latakia and that would change the situation in Lebanon hugely.\"</p> <p>Lebanon's Shias, for decades a minority but now more of a demographic force, are aligned to Syria's Alawites, who are regarded as an offshoot of Shia Islam. Hezbollah, the political bloc that represents most of Lebanon's Shias, is heavily invested in the survival of Syria's leader, Bashar al-Assad, as is the regional Shia heavyweight, Iran.</p> <p>A potential partition of either country would be a seismic change in the regional dynamic. \"There needs to be urgent action,\" Jumblatt said. \"If it doesn't happen, who knows what the consequences could be.\"</p> <p>From Beirut's elite, but now largely empty, downtown shopping district to south Lebanon's Shia villages,, it is difficult to find anyone who does not fear what the next six months hold for Lebanon, or to find agreement on who is to blame.</p> <p>\"Something is coming,\" said Tamir Ali, in the southern city of Tyre. \"It will have to break somehow. It could be the Israelis, it could be the Americans, who knows?\"</p> <p>A senior political adviser in Beirut said he feared that Lebanon's much-vaunted resilience may not be able to withstand many months more of tension \u2013 let alone a rewriting of the region's boundaries.</p> <p>\"The Shias and Sunnis don't want to fight each other,\" he said. \"I'm convinced of that.</p> <p>\"But where is this leading us? And who can slow the momentum?\"</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 21 August 2012. The original referred to the Sykes-Picot agreement between the British and French in 1919. That should have been 1916, and has been corrected.</p>",
  "<p>Selling food on the street has always been a tough business, and the signs are that it is not getting any easier. Recently, in the Lancashire town of Blackburn, a turf war for control of the lucrative local ice-cream business allegedly <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlPxbowJlXg&amp;feature=youtu.be\" title=\"\">led the driver of a Mr Yummy van to smash the&#xa0;window of a rival Mr Whippy</a> with&#xa0;a&#xa0;tyre iron.</p> <p>Of course this incident is nowhere near as alarming as Glasgow's notorious ice-cream wars \u2013 a campaign of violence, intimidation and arson that resulted in a number of deaths in the 1980s. However, a burgeoning interest in British street food has contributed to rising tensions between newcomers and established local businesses.</p> <p>For many people running a street food operation is an attractive proposition. Start-up costs and pitch fees are low. Unlike restaurants or cafes, street food vendors pay no rent or rates. Meanwhile, the profit margin on gourmet products is greater than it&#xa0;is on a traditional roadside hotdog or burger.</p> <p>Traders such as Yianni Papoutsis of <a href=\"http://www.themeatwagon.co.uk/\" title=\"\">the Meatwagon</a> in London and Claire Kelsey of <a href=\"http://www.gingerscomfortemporium.com/\" title=\"\">Ginger's Comfort Emporium</a> in Manchester have helped create a buzz that has spread around the country. But as the recession bites, these differences are causing problems.</p> <p>Take for example <a href=\"http://www.yorkshireeveningpost.co.uk/news/latest-news/top-stories/angry-leeds-city-centre-traders-claim-market-events-are-costing-them-thousands-1-4697122\" title=\"\">the clashes at a new market on Briggate</a> in Leeds, home to the city's branch of Harvey Nichols and an array of luxury brands.&#xa0;One street food trader says that he had a parcel of fish guts dumped on his van.&#xa0;Another claims to have been told that, if she dared&#xa0;to come back, she would be blockaded in. The police were contacted and now the council is trying &#xa0;to&#xa0;pick up the pieces.</p> <p>At the <a href=\"http://www.picklesandpotter.co.uk\" title=\"\">Pickles &amp; Potter Deli Cafe</a>, by the new market, Lorna Potter, who was not involved in either incident, pays more than \u00a350,000 rent a year, plus rates. She insists that her objection to street food vendors isn't born of snobbery. \"Street food just doesn't give&#xa0;the right message \u2026 It's like putting a sewage treatment works right&#xa0;next to a beautiful organic farm,\"&#xa0;she says.</p> <p>Andrew Critchett, who runs the stall <a href=\"http://www.fishand.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Fish&amp;</a>, offers high-end, sustainable seafood at the market. He disagrees: \"City centres need to become more community and experience-focused. Street-food markets lend a real vibrancy that adds to the independent spirit in Leeds city centre.\"</p> <p>Street traders argue that they do not use the same facilities as restaurateurs so shouldn't pay the same rates. They are, they say, simply delivering restaurant-quality food at takeaway prices, regenerating city centres and&#xa0;showcasing diversity.</p> <p>Mark Laurie, director of the <a href=\"http://www.ncass.org.uk\" title=\"\">Nationwide Caterers Association</a> \u2013 the&#xa0;trade body for Britain's street food&#xa0;industry \u2013 agrees that \"street food&#xa0;can sit happily alongside bricks and mortar&#xa0;restaurants, as has been proven across London. In instances such as Leeds, the idea behind street food and regeneration has not been sold or explained to the local businesses effectively.\"</p> <p>Over in Saltburn-by-the-Sea, North Yorkshire, a similar story is playing out. Dave Rawson, who sells seasonal British specialities from <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/thegreedybassetskitchen\" title=\"\">the Greedy Bassets Kitchen</a>, says the council offered him an idyllic pitch on the end&#xa0;of the pier. He is now in dispute with other traders over the spot and there is ongoing friction with several local food outlets.</p> <p>Rawson wonders why his tiny business is seen as such a threat. But as he sears his local catch of the day, one possible answer may be in the line that's building up for lunch.</p>",
  "<p>Last week, and not for the first time, Juan Manuel S\u00e1nchez Gordillo found himself in the Spanish headlines. Dubbed \"Robin Hood\" by El Pais, S\u00e1nchez Gordillo, the mayor of a small town in rural Andalusia, led farm labourers into supermarkets <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/spain/9467635/Spanish-mayor-hailed-as-modern-day-Robin-Hood.html\" title=\"\">to expropriate basic living supplies</a>: they filled trolleys with pasta, sugar, chickpeas and milk, left without paying, and distributed the loot to local food banks. His reasoning was blunt: \"The crisis has a face and a name. There are many families who can't afford to eat.\"</p> <p>It's hard to overstate how close to the brink Spain is at the moment. Unemployment is at 25% nationally (higher than Greece), 34% in Andalusia and 53% for 16-to-24-year-olds; miners in Asturias are firing homemade rocket launchers at riot police; repossessions and the collapse of the construction industry have left 800,000 empty homes, and, last May, the 8 million-strong <em>indignados</em> protest movement, a forerunner of Occupy, announced its total lack of faith in parliamentary democracy to solve any of these problems. And this is just the phoney war: <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/jul/19/spain-austerity-protest-bank-bailout-bond\" title=\"\">last month, the prime minister, Mariano Rajoy, announced spending cuts of \u00a465bn (\u00a351bn) over the next two years</a>.</p> <p>In the heart of it all, like Asterix's village in Gaul implausibly holding out against the Romans, is S\u00e1nchez Gordillo's town, the self-described communist utopia of Marinaleda. With a population of 2,600, the town has virtually full employment, communally owned land and wage equality. Over the past three decades, the townspeople have built 350 family homes with their own hands. Residents pay a \"mortgage\" of just \u00a415&#xa0;a month towards their homes, but&#xa0;have no opportunity to profit from selling them on.</p> <p>When you first arrive, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marinaleda,_Spain\" title=\"\">Marinaleda</a> looks the same as any small town in rural Andalusia, with olive groves stretching towards a dusty horizon, children kicking footballs against worn stone walls and parasols fluttering gently outside tapas bars. Soon, you begin to notice the little differences: the lack of advertising or brand names, the streets named for Ferm\u00edn Salvochea, the 19th-century anarchist mayor of Cadiz, and for Salvador Allende, Federico Garc\u00eda Lorca and Pablo Neruda.</p> <p>In the mayor's office hangs a framed portrait of Che Guevara, along with three flags: one for Andalusia, one for the Spanish Second Republic (the elected government displaced by Franco's military coup), and one sporting the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Bandera_de_Marinaleda_%28Sevilla%29.svg\" title=\"\">red, white and green of Marinaleda itself</a>; it's very clean, and endearingly untidy. In one corner is a flip-chart covered with semi-legible marker pen scribbles, bullet points and wonky arrows; this, it transpires, is the town's budget.</p> <p>S\u00e1nchez Gordillo was born in Marinaleda in 1949; back then, he explains, it was a town of migrant workers. \"They would go to Germany, or France; or for two months a year, to the wheat fields to the north, to look for work. Otherwise, they were unemployed. It was misery. The surroundings were all huge expanses of private land. Andalusia is like Latin America: 2% of property owners own 50% of the land.\"</p> <p>After Franco's death in 1975, Marinaleda began struggling towards its own definition of freedom. Organising around a new trade union, a new workers' party, and with weekly mass meetings, the townspeople began occupying some of the land around the village, owned \u2013 and unused \u2013 by the Duke of Infantil. The police would arrest or evict them, and they'd start all over again. They blocked roads, broke into and shut down Malaga and Seville airports, marched on Madrid, and went on mass hunger strike. S\u00e1nchez Gordillo has been to jail seven times, and survived two assassination attempts by rightwing extremists.</p> <p>After 12 years of persistent struggle, with 1992's Seville World Expo just round the corner and the regional authorities' resolve finally weakening, incredibly, they won, securing 1,200 hectares of the duke's land for their farming cooperative.</p> <p>\"Our union gathers people of many political stripes,\" S\u00e1nchez Gordillo explains, \"but we carry the torch of anarchism's direct action.\" He cites 5,000 years of Andalusian struggle for land, and thinks for a moment. \"Even the weekly assembly is direct action.\"</p> <p>The town's relationship with the state is complicated. They are still subject to Spanish electoral law (S\u00e1nchez Gordillo is re-elected with a huge majority each time), but have abolished their police force. \"By law, due to the number of inhabitants we have here, we should have around four to seven cops,\" he tells me. \"But we don't want police here. Because we have our voluntary work, because we fight together, because we make our lives together, there is a high degree of coexistence. When we plant trees, we do it together too.\" S\u00e1nchez Gordillo's articulation of what \"community\" can mean is striking, when you consider how blithely the word is used by politicians across the west.</p> <p>\"Utopias aren't chimeras, they are the most noble dreams that people have. The dream of equality; the dream that housing should belong to everyone, because you are a person, and not a piece of merchandise to be speculated with; the dream that natural resources \u2013 for instance energy \u2013 shouldn't be in the service of multinationals, but in the service of the people. All those dreams are the dreams we'd like to turn into realities. First, in the place where we live, with the knowledge that we're surrounded by capitalism everywhere; and later, in Andalusia, and the world.\"</p> <p>Leaving the gleaming white town hall building and departing into the dusk, you find a metal arch spelling out the slogan <em>OTRO MUNDO ES POSIBLE</em>. Another world is possible. In Marinaleda, the words represent not an aspirational mirage, but a statement of fact.</p> <p>\u2022 Adapted from <a href=\"http://bit.ly/utopia2012\">Utopia and the Valley of Tears: A journey through the Spanish crisis</a>, an ebook available from amazon.co.uk from 20 August.</p>",
  "<p>In the week before the release of his latest movie, the Twilight heartthrob Robert Pattinson had a choice. Given some recent <a href=\"http://jezebel.com/5928865/kristen-stewart-cheats-on-vampire-boyfriend-with-married-human-father-of-two\">indelicate publicity </a>surrounding his girlfriend Kristen Stewart, he could have been forgiven for choosing to forgo his media obligations. Instead, the British actor stiffened his upper lip and headed for two of the biggest gigs in US television.</p> <p>On Monday, Pattinson put himself in front of the satirical news host Jon Stewart, who proceeded to embarrass him with a sketch in which he pretended the pair were girlfriends moping over their love lives while downing pints of Ben and Jerry's ice cream.</p> <p>It didn't go well: Pattinson just looked awkward, indulged in some forced laughter and declined to say anything about Stewart's indiscretions.</p> <p>On Wednesday, Pattinson had another go at getting his story straight on Good Morning America.</p> <p>That didn't go very well either. Pattinson just looked even more awkward, indulged in even more forced laughter, and declined once again to say anything about Stewart's indiscretions.</p> <p>His tricky position was understandable. Pattinson and Stewart have never discussed their relationship in public \u2013 her recent apology for an affair with the married director Rupert Sanders was the first time she had even publicly confirmed they were a couple.</p> <p>But in putting himself in front of the media to promote his new movie, Cosmopolis, based on a novel by Don DeLillo, the questions were inevitable.</p> <p>In both interviews, Pattinson mused on the troubles of fame and the necessity of publicity. \"The reason why you go on TV is to promote movies. That's the only way to do it,\" <a href=\" http://gma.yahoo.com/blogs/abc-blogs/robert-pattinson-not-interested-trying-sell-personal-life-131603505--abc-news-celebrities.html\">he said on GMA</a>. \"I've never been interested in trying to sell my personal life, and that's really the only reason people bring it up.\"</p> <p>On GMA, host George Stephanopoulos did not see any problem in bringing it up. \"I gotta get the elephant in the room out of the way,\" Stephanopoulos said. \"Everybody just wants to know how are you doing and what do you want your fans to know about what's going on in your personal life?\"</p> <p>As a roar came from fans clustered outside the GMA studio, Pattinson quipped: \"Well you know, they seem pretty excited about kind of whatever.\" Referring to a box of cereal Stephanopoulos had gifted him, the 26-year-old continued: \"I'd like them \u2026 I'd like my fans to know that Cinnamon Toast Crunch has only 30 calories a bowl.\"</p> <p>He had warned on the Daily Show on Monday that his \"biggest problem\" was being \"cheap\".</p> <p>\"I didn't hire a publicist,\" he said \u2013 interpreted by some to be a reference to <a href=\"http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20614722,00.html \">the apology Stewart swiftly issued to People magazine</a> in the wake of her canoodling. Stewart told the magazine she was \"deeply sorry for the hurt and embarrassment\" caused.</p> <p>\"This momentary indiscretion has jeopardized the most important thing in my life, the person I love and respect the most, Rob,\" Stewart said in a statement.</p> <p>The pair rose to fame through starring in the Twilight vampire film series, Pattinson portraying a brooding vampire high-school student opposite Stewart's initially non-vampiric, but later vampiric, high-school student.

  "<h2>Introduction</h2> <p>Probably the only sport in which sitting down well is rewarded. This bouncy branch of gymnastics was invented when a woman in 19th-century London jumped from a burning building on to a stretched-out bedsheet, only to provoke spontaneous applause from onlookers when she accidentally performed a half-twist leading into a pike. And that is a fact.</p> <h2>The basics</h2> <p>A routine consists of 10 contacts with the \"bed\", starting and finishing on the feet, with participants allowed one bounce to control themselves before landing at the end and remaining stationary for three seconds. Three postures are recognised during jumps \u2013 tucked (knees clasped to chest), piked (arms and legs straight, body bent) and straight \u2013 and you can land on your bum, feet, front and back.</p> <p>Beginners won't be concerned with any of this. The best thing about trampolining is that it's easy to start \u2013 see kids, bouncy castles \u2013 and doesn't require any special clobber. Just the big bouncy thing in the gym.</p> <h2>Health benefits</h2> <p>Trampolining improves balance, flexibility and co-ordination, as well as strengthening the leg muscles. As a low-impact sport it carries minimal risk of wear-and-tear-based injuries (unless you regularly fall off). Rebounding subjects you to twice the usual force of gravity, which can help prevent osteoporosis by working the musculoskeletal system \u2013 and there's even evidence to suggest it boosts your lymphatic function.</p> <h2>Equipment, costs and practicalities</h2> <p>Unless you want to buy your own trampoline (<a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B003BF6IO8/ref=asc_df_B003BF6IO87359247?smid=A1IAW2UHK0VK22&amp;tag=googlecouk06-21&amp;linkCode=asn&amp;creative=22218&amp;creativeASIN=B003BF6IO8\">this one</a>, for instance, costs \u00a3120, has a safety net and can be used by adults and kids), your best bet is to inquire at your local sports hall for classes, or to use <a href=\"http://www.trampolining-online.co.uk/links/trampoline-clubs.php\">this club finder</a>. <a href=\"http://www.chelmsford.gov.uk/riverside\">Riverside Ice and Leisure</a> in Chelmsford, for instance, charges \u00a384 for a 12-week adults' course. </p> <p>Training can be performed in any non-flapping sports garments.</p> <h2>Trendiness rating: 5/10</h2> <p>Trampolinists jump up to 10m in the air. Beat that, basketball.</p> <h2>Inside line</h2> <p><strong>Vera Atkinson, British Gymnastics:</strong> \"From early civilisations until the present day, this sport can be seen as a reflection of man's desire to defy gravity! At recreational level it is a source of great fun. The most modern trampoline can project a gymnast to such heights that the top stars can touch 10m-high ceilings and perform multiple somersaults with ease. As well as being a sport in its own right, it is widely recognised as a training tool for many other sports such as gymnastics, diving and freestyle skiing. It is also used by the Royal Air Force and by space agencies to acclimatise their pilots and astronauts to aerial activity.\"</p> <h2>Find out more</h2> <p><a href=\"http://www.trampolining-online.co.uk/\">trampolining-online.co.uk</a> \u2013 an online resource with a club finder, competitions, coaches and retail section.</p> <h2>You may also like</h2> <p>Diving, gymnastics.</p> <h2>You might hate</h2> <p>Fencing, football.</p> <h2>Over to you</h2> <p>Are you a trampolinist?

  "<p>Internationalisation in higher education is nothing new. For decades - before there were economic gains to be made from international student recruitment and possibly even before the term was coined - the brightest and wealthiest students from developing countries have gone to study abroad. The institutions selected have been as much a reflection of the political ties between countries, as they've been an indication of a student's personal ambitions.</p> <p>But since the development of the higher education market, the rising costs of a university education and the diminishing support of governments through the public purse, universities - old and new - are actively pursuing internationalisation strategies. The other big change of course, is that the new key players in higher education (India, China and Brazil) reflect wider geopolitical shifts.</p> <p>Still, to see internationalisation as simply synonymous with international student recruitment is both a limited approach and one loaded with concerns over neo-colonialism and imperialism. The sector now speaks more of international partnerships \u2013 from research collaborations and consultancy to academic and student exchanges.</p> <p>Engaging globally has becomes both more popular and more complex. In turn, universities are beginning to adopt a variety of approaches \u2013 often led by institution heads. </p> <p>In this brave new world, how do you go about developing a strategy that works and is embedded in your existing institutional culture? How do you pick your partners and as universities start multiple partnerships in multiple countries, how do you determine who the stakeholders are, to whom you should be accountable? And, perhaps most contentious of all, how do you assess internationalisation strategies? Should universities measure their activities or the impact of those activities? Ultimately, what does quality look like in international higher education?</p> <p>Join our panel, Friday 17 August to understand the place internationalisation strategies fill within wider higher education and share your experiences and expertise on how the best internationalisation strategies are developed.</p> <p><em>The live chat will begin at 12 BST and will be in the comment threads beneath this blog.</em></p> <p><strong>This content is brought to you by </strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/guardian-professional\" title=\"\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

  "<p>The US election campaign has descended into a particularly bitter phase, with Mitt Romney accusing Barack Obama of a willingness to \"do anything\" to stay in power and renewed controversy over a series of negative campaign ads from the president's camp.</p> <p>In an interview on CBS This Morning, Romney said the attack ads being run by the Obama team, and allied Obama-supporting Super Pac groups, had sought to divide the country.</p> <p>\"If you look at the ads that have been described and the divisiveness based upon income, age, ethnicity and so forth, it's designed to bring a sense of enmity and jealously and anger \u2026 the president seems to be running just to hang on to power. I think he'll do anything in his power to try and get re-elected,\" Romney said in the first solo interview since announcing Wisconsin congressman Paul Ryan as his running mate.</p> <p>One particularly controversial ad, produced by the Obama-supporting Super Pac Priorities USA Action, features a man claiming his wife died of cancer after losing her health insurance when his factory was closed by Romney's former firm Bain Capital. </p> <p>Despite a storm of criticism over the accuracy of its claims, the ad has now aired on a TV station in the key swing state of Ohio. However, a spokesman for the Super Pac has said the ad was aired via a \"station error\". That has cut little ice with the Romney camp. </p> <p>Matt Rhoades, Romney's campaign manager, said: \"They claim the station aired it by mistake. But if they didn't intend to air it, why would they ship the false ad to TV stations in the first place? President Obama once set the highest expectations and is now engaged in the lowest form of campaigning.\"</p> <p>The argument is the latest spat to roil a campaign been marred by fierce disputes over political attack ads and comments by vice-president Joe Biden. Speaking at a rally in Virginia, he told a mixed-race crowd that the Republicans were \"\u2026 going to put y'all back in chains\". </p> <p>That last comment led to Republican accusations that Biden had been race-baiting: something the Democrats denied by pointing out he had been talking about Wall Street and how Romney wanted to \"unchain\" the banking industry from regulations. </p> <p>But in the television interview Romney did not let the issue die down. \"These personal attacks, I think, are demeaning to the office of the White House and the comments yesterday by the vice-president, I think, just diminish the White House that much more,\" he said.</p> <p>Experts say that the 2012 campaign so far has been the most negative in recent memory in the US, spurred largely by the huge amounts of unrestrained cash flowing into the coffers of outside groups like Super Pacs. </p> <p>\"There is so much money and therefore the quantity of negative ads is so much more than we have ever seen. They know it is far more effective to tear someone down than build somebody up,\" said professor David Cohen, a political scientist at the University of Akron in Ohio.</p> <p>At the moment the negative campaigning seems to be working for Obama and his supporters. Most recent polls show Obama ahead of Romney in national polls with a narrow but firm lead. The situation in the key battleground states \u2013 where the election will be decided and where most negative ads have been running \u2013 often shows a stronger lead for Obama. </p> <p>Many experts believe that Romney's weekend pick of the firebrand Ryan as his vice-presidential candidate was a sign that the Republican believes he needed to shake up his campaign in order to stand a chance at the ballot box in November.</p> <p>But the Romney team's attempt to paint Obama as a negative campaigner may lead to allegations of hypocrisy. Romney's campaign, and the Super Pacs who back it, have not been shy of airing negative attack ads themselves. Romney also revealed a ruthless side during the Republican nomination race where he and his supporters unleashed a barrage of negative ads that helped beat off the challenges of former House speaker Newt Gingrich and former Pennsylvania senator Rick Santorum. \"Negative campaigning is very much coming from both sides,\" said Cohen.</p> <p>There are also other shadowy organisations beginning to get involved. On Wednesday a group called Special Operations Opsec Education Fund launched a 22-minute long video called Dishonorable Disclosures, a<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/15/us-special-ops-obama-bin-laden\">imed at attacking Obama for taking credit for the death of terrorist leader Osama bin Laden</a> and for security leaks from his administration. </p> <p>Though Opsec says it is an independent, non-partisan group made up of former special forces soldiers, the group's video explicitly goes after Obama. Its leader, former navy seal Scott Taylor, is also a former Republican congressional candidate. The group's formation has prompted comparisons to the Swift Boat campaign of 2004 which helped derail senator John Kerry's bid for the White House by questioning his service record in the Vietnam war.</p>",
  "<p>Celebrity Big Brother left Channel 4 with a whimper rather than a bang in 2010.

Apparently a mystery US celeb is also lined up to appear in a \"huge surprise\" \u2013 although \"official Big Brother paper\" the Daily Star is typically coy in revealing any details.</p> <p>The Daily Mail's Liz Jones is apparently another \"one who got away\" \u2013 but she has <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/2012/jul/28/samantha-brick-celebrity-big-brother\" title=\"\">reportedly been replaced by fellow confessional columnist <strong>Samantha Brick</strong></a>. It wouldn't be surprising if the former TV producer is on a mission to show the world she's not the self-absorbed creature she seems to be \u2013 but will the male housemates be able to resist the writer who claimed <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/internet/9188229/Samantha-Brick-ten-out-of-ten-men-fancy-me.html\" title=\"\">\"10 out of 10 men fancy me\" and that women hate her for her \"lovely looks\"</a>?</p> <p>Brick could turn out to be the must-watch figure this year, as paparazzo Darryn Lyons and his fake \"six-pack\" proved to be last August.

  "<h2>BERNE BABY BERNE</h2> <p>As is customary when the Fiver has an England friendly to write about, this morning $exually Repressed Morris Dancing Fiver's phone jingle-jangled in the inside pocket of his navy blue pinstripe waistcoat and put new life in to one of his left nipples. It had become flat and chafed after our jaunty cousin had spent several days trapped in the bowels of the Olympic Stadium attempting to escape the rabid attentions of someone who looked very much like Jessie J and alas, since she was still rutting against his hip singing a Queen medley in several different keys all at once, he could not take the call. Still, in this magnificent post-Olympic utopia the Fiver's Scottish cousin, Shortbread McFiver, would surely be more than willing to step in to the breach.</p> <p>Shortbread has had a torrid time of it, though, for even after knocking back the hair and the dog, he could definitely see two Roy Hodgsons! For here was Roy in a home-made FREE JT tabard (the picture was Deirdre Rachid but he had drawn an England badge on her chest) saying that he hoped the FA would forget all of that business with Anton Ferdinand and let the nation's brave removed leader return in time for the World Cup qualifiers next month. Yet here was Roy talking about all the lessons that he and his players have learned from the Olympic athletes, Jessica Whatsername and Mobot, saying earnestly: \"We can learn from the enormous grace and humility the athletes have shown.\"</p> <p>\"Ma heed!\" cried Shortbread.</p> <p>It all got a bit better after Football Against R@cism exec Piara Powar called Roy's plea for EBJT's freedom \"foolish\", mind, and everyone tried really hard to concentrate on tonight's friendly against Italy. Cesar Prandelli's side will be without Andrea Pirlo (none of the Juventus or Napoli players are involved after their Italian Super Cup exploits) but nonetheless confident of repeating the result that put England out of Euro 2012 in the Week 5 BO (all time will now be measured according to hebdomadis Olympia). On that occasion the blossoming partnership between Joe Hart and Andy Carroll was given free licence to grant England a split-second's possession in the Italian half every few minutes, but even that outlet will be closed. Hart is not playing.</p> <p>\"I don't have a magical formula that will suddenly change what we were trying to do in the Euros and revolutionise things overnight,\" said Hodgson, turning out his pockets and sending a shiny farthing spinning on to the table. England were overrun in midfield at the Euros but have the fresh-faced new partnership of Frank Lampard and Michael Carrick to orchestrate things this time around. \"In victory [the Olympic athletes] were humble and in defeat superb \u2026 let's hope football can learn from that and earn a few Brownie points,\" Hodgson added, ensuring that at least something about his Grace &amp; Humility XI would go down as 'superb' this evening.</p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football\" title=\"\"><em>Follow England 1-2 Italy with Paul Doyle from 7.30pm tonight</em></a>.</p> <h2>QUOTE OF THE DAY</h2> <p>\"Football has been my life since I was a teenage boy and it has given me so many opportunities.

Once upon a time you could head out into a gloomy cricketing day and stand a 50-50 chance of it \"turning out nice\".. No more.\u00c2 It's all well and good Danny Boyle including Michael Fish's hurricane denial in his delirious opening ceremony montage of British eccentricity (incidentally, if he was truly \"visionary\" and cutting-edge, he'd surely have included a bumptious MP tweeting about how it was all \"leftist multicultural crap\"), but surely such errors are now an archaism.</p> <p>I, on the other hand, am not quite so reliable in my prognostications and may well have been a tad premature with the assessment that overhead conditions were \"muggy\" (it could have had something to do with a sharp dash up to the press box). In fact, there's considerably \"more nip in the air than in the Notts attack\" harrumphed Nev in the top of the Radcliffe Road Stand, an imaginary curmudgeon who will hereafter be used as a device to smuggle in slightly cheeky gags to which I'm not yet prepared to put my name.</p> <p>It is thus with a tinge of regret that I report that the floodlights are on here and the sky has turned Four or Five Shades of Grey (which Nev and sidekck Len are finding far from erotic).

Derbyshire won it, and will bowl. </p> <p>The talk among my colleagues is of the weather, which has clobbered Yorkshire harder than most of the counties this season - we might be OK today, at least until tea, seems to be the general consensus. Yorkshire's director of cricket Martyn Moxon reckons Yorkshire must beat Derbyshire to stand a realistic chance of being promoted as champions \u2013 which given they start 26 points behind the league leaders and have played a game more seems an entirely uncontroversial statement.

  "<h2>Fringe amnesty</h2> <p>Some years the festival throws up distinct themes: this summer it seems to be young people and how they view the world \u2013 take for example All That is Wrong, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/2012/aug/06/morning-edinburgh-review\">Morning</a> and Chris Goode's Monkey Bars, which opens at the <a href=\"http://www.traverse.co.uk \">Traverse</a> tonight. </p> <p>Of course some festival-goers curate their fringe-going to create their own personally themed festivals. A few years ago I met a man in the queue who regularly came to the festival but only even saw shows with a scientific theme. I'm beginning to see the benefits myself this year as I'm on the panel of selectors for the <a href=\"http://www.amnesty.org.uk/news_details.asp?NewsID=20255\">Amnesty International Freedom of Expression award</a>, presented to a show that combines artistic excellence with a concern for human rights. </p> <p>It's been rather fascinating, because it means that I've been to see some shows that might not otherwise have risen to the top of my list, including the cry of pain that is <a href=\"http://www.summerhall.co.uk\">We Are Chechens</a> or Vicky Araico Casas's one-woman show, Juana in a Million at <a href=\"http://www.pleasance.co.uk\">Pleasance</a>, an engaging slice of life about the experiences of a young Mexican woman in London who dreams of getting an education and making a future for herself, only to have them snuffed out by the fact she has no immigration papers. </p> <p>Over 120 shows have entered for the award \u2013 a reminder that the fringe is not just about entertainment. It can help engender change. </p> <h2>Thinking local</h2> <p>On Sunday night, as I walked back to the centre of Edinburgh from <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/2012/aug/13/waiting-orestes-electra-edinburgh-review?newsfeed=true\">Electra: Waiting for Orestes</a> at the King's Theatre, there were hundreds of people watching the closing ceremony of the Olympics on the big screen. Last year there was a lot of concern on the fringe that the Olympic effect would keep companies away from Edinburgh this year. </p> <p>That certainly doesn't seem to be the case, but it does seem to have affected audiences \u2013 particularly the crucial local audience, which makes up around a third of fringe-goers. It seems people have been glued to their TV screens rather than dipping a toe in the fringe, with the Stage reporting <a href=\" http://www.thestage.co.uk/news/newsstory.php/37046/fringe-venues-report-slow-local-sales-due-to\">reduced ticket sales</a> and even the PBH free fringe experiencing lower audience numbers. Maybe now the Olympics are over, they'll all come out to play.</p> <h2>A mess of good writing</h2> <p>I've seldom come across a show that has divided audiences quite as starkly along gender lines as Caroline Horton's <a href=\" http://www.traverse.co.uk/whats-on/mess/\">Mess</a> at the Traverse. It's a play inspired by Horton's own experience of <a href=\"http://www.b-eat.co.uk/\">anorexia</a>, a subject that you might assume would engage female audiences most of all (not, of course, that anorexia is only a female issue \u2013 it's a growing problem for men too). </p> <p>I didn't enjoy it much myself (too whimsical, too self-consciously meta, too concentrated on symptoms rather than causes) but while I've yet to meet a woman who loves it, there are plenty of men who do. Love it or hate it, it's undoubtedly generated some of the most interesting and perceptive writing on theatre from Daniel B Yates for Exeunt<a href=\"http://exeuntmagazine.com/reviews/mess/\"> here</a> and from Andrew Haydon <a href=\"http://postcardsgods.blogspot.co.uk/2012/08/mess-traverse.html\">here</a>. Agree with them or not, both pieces of writing are a reminder that long-form criticism beats star-rated reviews every time.</p>",
  "<p>Remember Wikileaks - the phenomenon that was going to change journalism as we know it? Well, two years on, it's way off the media radar now, what with its founder, Julian Assange, holed up in London's Ecuadorian embassy (<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/aug/14/julian-assange-asylum-ecuador-wikileaks\">and looking likely to win asylum</a>). </p> <p>Even concerned governments, notably the US administration, appear untroubled by its 2010 revelations. They survived after all. </p> <p>But Charlie Beckett, director of Polis at the London School of Economics, believes Wikileaks remains of \"profound significance\" for journalism. And I'm sure he isn't just saying that just because he has a book to plug: <em>WikiLeaks: news in the networked era</em>.* <br> Beckett thinks \"WikiLeaks is the greatest challenge to journalism in the digital era\" while conceding that \"this communications comet might just burn out, torn apart by the combined strain of personal-legal problems, financial crisis, external assaults and internal inertia.\"</p> <p>But he argues that \"we should be taking notice rather than taking sides over Julian Assange's remarkable project.\" To that end, he lists three of WikiLeaks' lessons:</p> <p><em>First,</em> the \"embassy cables\" of 2010 continue to have an impact in the political life of several countries. Even if not ground-breaking, they have \"had the effect of confirming widely held suspicions.\"</p> <p><em>Second,</em> WikiLeaks was a breakthrough as an act of journalism because its \"scale and immunity\" was unprecedented. And it worked, and is working. \"It was effectively immune from censorship,\" writes Beckett. \"A barrage of financial and infrastructural assaults... have not stopped it publishing.\"</p> <p><em>Third,</em> by collaborating with mainstream media WikiLeaks ensured that its information got the attention it deserved. That's powerful networked journalism in action.</p> <p>Beckett continues by looking forward to a \"new journalism landscape\" in which refurbished journalism organisations will operate \"within the wider context of much more distributed social communications networks populated by individuals and a whole range of governmental, corporate and civic groups.\"</p> <p>Read on. There's much more in Beckett's article to appreciate. Most importantly, he sees beyond the current transitory situation that beggars so many discussions about the future of journalism.</p> <p><em>Source:</em> <a href=\"http://www.opendemocracy.net/charlie-beckett/wikileaks-and-network-era-news\">Open Democracy</a> *<em>WikiLeaks: News in the networked era</em> is published by Polity</p>",

  "<p>Harry Harrison, who has died aged 87, was a writer from the world of American comics and science-fiction magazines of the 1950s. An amazingly prolific author, who gradually took on more serious themes as he matured, Harrison is probably best known for the book that inspired the Hollywood film Soylent Green (1973). Directed by Richard Fleischer and starring Charlton Heston and Edward G Robinson, Soylent Green was an uncompromising view of a world a quarter of a century into the future, in which massive overpopulation has created a critical food shortage. The solution is an alleged soya/lentil substitute \u2013 the plot concerns the discovery of the true nature of the stuff.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-394760398\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/15/1345033344236/harry-harrison-obituary-001.jpg\" alt=\"harry harrison obituary\" width=\"220\" height=\"310\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Harry Harrison's Stainless Steel Rat series, from 1961, ran to 12 titles</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Public Domain</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The original novel was called Make Room! Make Room! (1966). Harrison said wryly that the film \"at times bore a faint resemblance to the book\". It was a serious, thoroughly researched novel, written at a time when there was little discussion of the population time-bomb. Although overpopulation was a common theme in far-future science fiction, Harrison's idea was to depict a near-future society (year 2000) that many of us, or our children, would live to see. It marked a change of direction for Harrison, although it was an early sign of a trend in his work that was not to emerge in full until some years later.</p> <p>His most popular and best-known work is contained in fast-moving parodies, homages or even straight reconstructions of traditional space-opera adventures. He wrote several named series of these: notably the Deathworld series (three titles, starting in 1960), the Stainless Steel Rat books (12 titles, from 1961), and the sequence of books about Bill, the Galactic Hero (seven titles, from 1965). These books all present interesting contradictions: while being exactly what they might superficially seem to be, unpretentious action novels with a strong streak of humour, they are also satirical, knowing, subversive, unapologetically anti-military, anti-authority and anti-violence. Harrison wrote such novels in the idiom of the politically conservative hack writer, but in reality he had a liberal conscience and a sharp awareness of the lack of literary values in so much of the SF he was parodying.</p> <p>He was born in Stamford, Connecticut, the only son of Henry Dempsey and his wife, Ria (n\u00e9e Kirjassoff). Dempsey changed his name to Harrison soon after Harry's birth, but the son did not find out until he applied for a passport, aged 30, that his own name was still Dempsey. He then changed his name legally to Harrison, but in later years sometimes used Hank Dempsey as a pseudonym.</p> <p>In 1943 he was drafted into the US Army Air Corps, where he became a sharpshooter, a military policeman, a gunnery instructor, and a specialist in the prototypes of computer-aided bomb-sights and gun turrets. One of his last literary projects was a novel based on this period. He was so bored during his service that he learned Esperanto \u2013 he was an active Esperantist for the rest of his life. But overall the army experience vested in him a hatred of the military that was to serve him well as a writer later on.</p> <p>After discharge he went to Hunter College in New York to study art. He became a student of the American painter John Blomshield, continuing to take private tuition from Blomshield after he finished college. By the end of the 1940s Harrison was running a small studio that specialised in selling illustrations to comics and science-fiction magazines. For years he thought of himself as a commercial artist rather than a writer. He then moved on to editing some of the magazines.</p> <p>As the market for comics began to shrink, and then expire, Harrison started writing for science-fiction magazines. The paltry financial rewards led him and his family (he married Joan Merkler in 1954) to want to move from New York. The chance came with what seemed at the time like a large payment from a magazine for his first full-length novel, Deathworld. He drove his family in an antiquated camper van to Mexico and remained there for a year.</p> <p>It was the first of many international moves, something that became characteristic. He went from Mexico to Britain, then to Italy, then to Denmark. He liked Denmark and stayed for seven years, seeing it as a perfect place to bring up his children, but eventually he realised that unless he made a conscious decision to leave, they could easily remain there for ever. The family moved back to the US, to San Diego, California, where he reckoned heating bills would be low, but by the mid-1970s he was back in the UK. He moved on to Ireland, where he and Joan settled for many years; because Harrison had an Irish grandparent, he was able to take out citizenship, and by taking full advantage of the Irish scheme for writers and other artists, he enjoyed tax-free status thereafter.</p> <p>A long association with the British writer Brian Aldiss allowed Harrison to express his deeper convictions about the way science-fiction literature was published, criticised and understood. In 1965 Harrison and Aldiss published the first issue (of two) of the world's first serious journal of SF criticism, SF Horizons. Together they edited many anthologies of short stories, each one illustrating the major themes of SF, and although not intended as critical apparatus the books were a way of delineating the unique material of the fantastic.</p> <p>As committed internationalists, the two men created World SF, an organisation of professionals intended to encourage and enhance the writing of non-anglophone SF. World SF was launched in 1979 in Dublin, with later meetings in countries including Sweden, Italy, Austria and Yugoslavia. The Harrison award was created to improve the international status of SF. As an editor he published the Nova series of original stories (1970-1975), and with Aldiss the anthologies Best SF and The Year's Best SF(1967-76).</p> <p>From the outside, the serious side of Harrison probably looked anomalous. For many years he remained a staunch supporter of and contributor to Analog, the SF magazine edited by John W Campbell, a doctrinaire editor who had no interest in literary values. And this was the period in which Harrison was publishing novels with titles such as Montezuma's Revenge (1972), A Transatlantic Tunnel, Hurrah! (1972), Star Smashers of the Galaxy Rangers (1973), and a book about SF art called Great Balls of Fire (1977). But, as Harrison himself once said, irony comes in many forms.</p> <p>His seriousness was manifest in more intensely felt novels such as Captive Universe (1969 \u2013 a Book of the Month Club choice in the US), Skyfall (1976), Stonehenge (1983 \u2013 written with the academic Leon Stover) and the Eden series of books, starting with West of Eden (1984). One of his last projects was to write his autobiography.</p> <p>Harrison was an extremely popular figure in the SF world, renowned for being amiable, outspoken and endlessly amusing. His quickfire, machine-gun delivery of words was a delight to hear, and a reward to unravel: he was funny and self-aware, he enjoyed reporting the follies of others, he distrusted generals, prime ministers and tax officials with sardonic and cruel wit, and above all he made plain his acute intelligence and astonishing range of moral, ethical and literary sensibilities.</p> <p>Joan died in 2002, a devastating blow which led to Harrison's full-time return to Britain. Two children, Todd and Moira, survive him.</p> <p><em>\u2022 </em>Henry Maxwell Harrison, science-fiction writer, born 12 March 1925; died 15 August 2012</p>",
  "<p>Honduran journalist Jose Noel Canales was shot to death on his way to work on Friday (10 August). His body was found inside his pick-up truck.</p> <p>Canales had worked for more than 12 years as journalist, monitoring national news for digital newspaper Hondudiario and news monitoring agency Seproc. </p> <p>Over the past six months, there has been an escalation of violence against journalists in Honduras. Last week, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/greenslade/2012/aug/07/journalist-safety-honduras\">I reported an attack on radio reporter Jos\u00e9 Encarnaci\u00f3n Chinchilla Canales</a>, which led him to seek asylum in the US.</p> <p>It is believed that Canales was the 23rd journalist killed in Honduras in the past two years. It is currently considered the second most dangerous country in the world for journalists. </p> <p>Honduras is ranked 135th (out of 179 countries) in the latest Reporters Without Borders press freedom index.</p> <p>According to the Inter-American Court of Human Rights, crimes against journalists continue to go unpunished in Honduras, despite its agreement to create special investigative bodies and protocols to respond to the attacks. </p> <p><em>Sources:</em> <a href=\"http://www.freedomhouse.org/article/killing-honduran-journalist-sign-continued-danger-media\">Freedom House</a>/<a href=\"http://en.rsf.org/press-freedom-index-2011-2012,1043.html\">RSF</a> <em>In Spanish:</em> <a href=\"http://www.cubaperiodistas.cu/noticias/agosto12/14/06.htm\">Cuba Periodistas</a></p>",
  "<p>Out go strangling tigers and selling yourself into slavery for the sake of your parents. In comes teaching them how to use the internet.</p> <p>Chinese authorities have updated an ancient morality text, as they seek to encourage a new generation to show suitable gratitude and respect to their mothers and fathers.</p> <p>The original 24 Filial Exemplars date from around the 14th century, when Yuan dynasty scholar Guo Jujing collected the tales of obedient children. They were endlessly reprinted in the centuries that followed, until the Communist party banned them as it sought to eradicate backwards thinking.</p> <p>The heroes of the work include the son who strangled a tiger to save his father and Dong Yong, a Han dynasty figure who sold himself to pay for his father's funeral rites.</p> <p>Another story, about Wang Xiang of the Jin dynasty, describes how he was mistreated by his stepmother. Undeterred in his filial duty, he lay naked on a frozen lake until the ice melted, so that she could eat carp as desired.</p> <p>The new list, promoted by the All China Women's Federation and the China National Committee on Ageing, appears more prosaic. It urges people to ensure their parents have sufficient health insurance, to take them for medical checks and to give them enough spending money.</p> <p>It urges people to listen to their parents' reminiscences and take them to see old movies, support their hobbies and call them at least once a week. They should not oppose the remarriage of divorced or widowed parents. It also suggests children can help to make their parents feel included by spending festivals with them, inviting them to visit workplaces and teaching them to use the internet.</p> <p>Changing social mores, the embryonic state of the social safety net and the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/mar/20/china-next-generation-ageing-population\" title=\"\">demographic \"timebomb\" of a fast-ageing population</a> have made officials keener than ever to promote filial piety.</p> <p>Wu Yushao, vice-president of the committee on ageing, told China Daily that it was not about blind obedience. \"It is about showing respect and love to aged parents and seniors, as ageing is an accelerating trend in China,\" he said. \"We urge adult children to provide financial support and sufficient care to their old parents.\"</p> <p>An employee of the community care campaign that drew up the modern version, who would not give her name, said: \"The essence of the new guidance has not changed. The spirit of being filial is part of our culture. We've just added the features of modern society.\"</p> <p><em>Additional research by Kathy Gao</em></p>",
  "<p>Doctor Who\u2019s series 33 opener <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asylum_of_the_Daleks\" title=\"\">Asylum of the Daleks</a> received its premiere at London\u2019s BFI on Tuesday night. And as has become traditional in these situations, that\u2019s about all we can really reveal.</p> \n<p>As soon as the closing credits rolled, and the familiar music chimed in, Doctor Who showrunner Steven Moffat made his now-familiar plea to the journalists, fans and bloggers assembled not to give away his secrets. Once again, we\u2019ll be respecting that plea \u2013 because one of the things we can tell you is that Asylum Of The Daleks will have been worth the wait.</p> \n<p>The big line with this series is \u201cmovie poster\u201d. They\u2019ve realised that quite wonderfully with the pre-publicity, a poster which indulges the sci-fi show\u2019s finest B-movie traditions: the Doctor, Amy and Rory reflected in the eye-stalk of one of Skaro\u2019s worst. And while the movie poster line is meant to mean \u201cblockbuster of the week\u201d, what it also means is \u201cno two-parters\u201d and \u201cno series long story arc\u201d.</p> \n<p>That will delight those who found last year\u2019s River Song saga too overwrought, but its actual thrill lies somewhere else. It\u2019s usually a back-handed compliment to say something was short yet felt long. But that wasn\u2019t what was going on here either.</p> \n<p>Introducing the Asylum, BBC drama boss Ben Stephenson said that this series was a Hollywood movie each week. Afterwards, Moffat told me that the intention here is compressed storytelling \u2013 90 minutes squeezed into 45. Actually, Asylum Of The Daleks manages to do a lot more than most of the classic series four-parters. It certainly manages to do more than, say, last year\u2019s The Rebel Flesh two-parter.</p> \n<p>So what can we tell you about Asylum Of The Daleks? As keen web-heads will know, it features every single model of Dalek in known existence \u2013 up to and including the Special Weapons model created for the underappreciated Sylvester McCoy story, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remembrance_of_the_Daleks\" title=\"\">Remembrance Of The Daleks</a>, and the replica that Russell T Davies had made for his hallway, for which Moffat did the ultimate favour to his predecessor in making it part of the canon.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"a6d7356c-35df-444b-aa63-782a4127441b\"

</gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>We catch a glimpse of a new planet, and a very old one. There is a choice of hairstyles from Amy Pond. Somebody gets to ask \u201cwhat colour?\u201d simply because \u201cthere are no good questions left\u201d. Amy Pond says \u201cGeronimo!\u201d and no, it still doesn\u2019t work as a catchphrase. Something has happened to the Ponds, and you won\u2019t like it. A hairdryer is used as a makeshift wind machine.</p> \n<p>It\u2019s a fun episode, as Dalek ones always need to be, but there is also burnt flesh to truly horrify. And, as it seems there always must be in Moffat Doctor Who scripts these days, there is a woman who is not all she seems. She will shake you to the core, yet as far as we know, no, she is not The Rani.</p> \n<p>So, here we are again for another year of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/tv-and-radio/series/new-doctor-who\" title=\"\">the Guardian\u2019s Who blog</a>. The same rules apply as ever; I will spoil nothing, but promise to tease everything. And you lot play nice. Last year, we not only worked the whole thing out, but debated life, the universe and everything every Saturday night. The return of that makes me thrilled and terrified in equal measure. Which is, of course, <em>exactly</em> how Doctor Who is supposed to make you feel. Welcome back...</p>",

Singer and guitarist Liza Casullo decided to go solo, but she took some time off to develop her acting career. A couple of months ago she released her first official album, Velvetbonzo. It's a great record in which a minimalistic acoustic sound blends with psychedelia, garage and folk. Rojo Lojojo is our favorite song, which we also managed to capture on <a href=\"http://www.zonaindie.com.ar/video-en-vivo-de-liza-casullo-en-ultra\">video</a> during one of her shows.</p> <p> <em>AUSTRALIA</em>: <a href=\"http://whothehell.net/\"><em>Who The Bloody Hell Are They?</em></a><br><a href=\"http://www.cogelband.com\"><strong>Cogel</strong></a><strong> \u2013 </strong><a href=\"http://whothehell.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Felusine1.mp3\"><strong>Felusine</strong></a><br>It's a guarantee that tidy string sections and pulsating drums will typically heighten melodramatic feelings of bad love and melancholy, but you can't pass over this glorious track from Sydney's Cogel. Those violins and cascading treble guitars which duck and weave out of the chorus provide a nice backdrop to the band's quieter moments and slight Arcade Fire stylings that mesh together so well. If Felusine is a pitch into the musical void, someone needs to sign these guys real soon.</p> <p> <em>AUSTRIA</em>: <a href=\"http://walzerkoenig.tumblr.com/\"><em>Walzerk\u00f6nig</em></a><br><a href=\"http://plaided.org/\"><strong>Plaided</strong></a><strong> \u2013 </strong><a href=\"http://www.unet.univie.ac.at/~a0700994/map/2012/08/Plaided%20-%20Freaks%20And%20Geeks%20%28Austria%29.mp3\"><strong>Freaks And Geeks</strong></a><br>\"Would you run run run run run run run to my place and watch Freaks and Geeks all night long?\" We totally would! Plaided is an acronym that was inspired by a Girls Rock Camp participant's band and thus matches the feminist background of Veronika Eberhart and Julia Mitterbauer. The duo will go on a US tour with Grass Widow in September and also record a 7\" record there. Freaks And Geeks is taken from their debut album Playdate, recorded by Wolfgang M\u00f6stl (of previous MAP act Mile Me Deaf).</p> <p> <em>BRAZIL</em>: <a href=\"http://www.meiodesligado.com/\"><em>Meio Desligado</em></a><br><a href=\"http://www.iconili.com.br\"><strong>Iconili</strong></a><strong> \u2013 </strong><a href=\"http://dl.dropbox.com/u/39279408/Iconili%20-%20O%20rei%20de%20tupanga%20(Brazil).mp3\"><strong>O Rei De Tupanga</strong></a><br>The fusion of jazz, experimentalism and African beats is the guideline for Iconili, formed by eight young musicians from Minas Gerais.

Besides being a couple in real life, the duo revisit the vigor of 70s garage, Phil Spector's Wall of Sound and the apathetic rage of The Jesus And Mary Chain. The music speak for itself, though, and this song Sunrise is their newest single.</p> <p> <em>COLOMBIA</em>: <a href=\"http://elparlanteamarillo.com/\"><em>El Parlante Amarillo</em></a><br><a href=\"http://plannnes.tumblr.com/\"><strong>Planes (Estudios Universales)</strong></a><strong> \u2013 </strong><a href=\"http://elparlanteamarillo.com/map/Planes%20(Estudios%20Universales)%20-%20Lonelii%20(Colombia).mp3\"><strong>Lonelii</strong></a><br>Within the new movement of pop/rock bands in Colombia, Planes (Estudios Universales) feels like a blast of fresh air.

The fact that one of the members hails from an area with a rich folk tradition seems to have seeped into their music, which has a pagan-ish, medieval quality to it. Elsewhere it is possible to detect influences as varied as The Go-Go's and The Monkees, The Doors and Talking Heads, and there is a blend of good old-fashioned \"played\" instruments and electronic drones and effects, but always the folk elements shine through.</p> <p> <em>FINLAND</em>: <a href=\"http://www.glue.fi/\"><em>Glue</em></a><br><a href=\"http://satellitestories.com/\"><strong>Satellite Stories</strong></a><strong> \u2013 </strong><a href=\"http://dl.dropbox.com/u/3135709/glue/map/satellite_stories_anti_lover_finland.mp3\"><strong>Anti-Lover</strong></a><br>Indie quartet Satellite Stories have delivered several party songs over the last couple of years to become one of Finland's most promising acts. Anti-Lover is the first single from their debut album Phrases To Break The Ice which will be released this autumn. It is three minutes of energetic guitar-based, dance-oriented indie-pop.</p> <p> <em>FRANCE</em>: <a href=\"http://yetyourefired.blogspot.com/\"><em>Yet You're Fired</em></a><br><a href=\"http://theaerial.bandcamp.com/\"><strong>The Aerial</strong></a><strong> \u2013 </strong><a href=\"https://dl.dropbox.com/u/22109319/The%20Aerial%20-%20Clarity%20%28France%29.mp3\"><strong>Clarity</strong></a><br>The Aerial are one of France's top up-and-coming bands. Hailing from Nancy, they released their first EP in April, in which each of their songs show a different influence, all while staying very danceable. In just four songs, they manage to sound like The Rapture, Foals and Foster The People. Clarity is their most electro-pop oriented song and is supported by a killer beat and an impeccable production. Don't miss unreleased single Running on <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVDDCA3Xqoo\">YouTube</a>.</p> <p> <em>GERMANY</em>: <a href=\"http://www.blogpartei.de/\"><em>Blogpartei</em></a><br><a href=\"http://www.myspace.com/wearecamera\"><strong>Camera</strong></a><strong> \u2013 </strong><a href=\"http://www.blogpartei.de/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Camera-Ausland%28Germany%29.mp3\"><strong>Ausland</strong></a><br>Let's continue our little series of new Kraut with Berlin trio Camera. Although they connect to the old Kraut by playing with Michael Rother and Dieter Moebius, their music sounds refreshing. First single Ausland keeps the typical meandering melodies and synths but brings back rock to Krautrock. Their debut album, due out this month, incorporates many more influences and will, of course, be released on Bureau B.</p> <p> <em>GREECE</em>: <a href=\"http://mysteryfallsdown.blogspot.com/\"><em>Mouxlaloulouda</em></a><br><a href=\"http://last-drive.net/\"><strong>The Last Drive</strong></a><strong> \u2013 </strong><a href=\"http://map.super45.cl/map-2012-08/The_Last_Drive_-_Child_Of_The_Sky_-_Greece.mp3\"><strong>Child Of The Sky</strong></a><br>The Last Drive are regarded as one of the most important and influential bands of the Greek underground music scene. They were formed 30 years ago and, through their explosive live performances and unique sound, became rapidly popular. After their dynamic comeback in 2007 (they split up in 1995), they released Heavy Liquid, a crafted mix of intense, raw rock 'n' roll songs, blurred melodies, addictive fuzz guitar riffs and almost primitive drums that unites disparate musical elements into blasts of noisy cohesion and howling passion. Right before the recording of their new LP, they have just unleashed News From Nowhere, an imprint of the difficult times we're living.</p> <p> <em>ICELAND</em>: <a href=\"http://rjominn.is/\"><em>Rj\u00f3minn</em></a><br><a href=\"http://www.jonassigurdsson.com/\"><strong>J\u00f3nas Sigur\u00f0sson</strong></a><strong> \u2013 </strong><a href=\"http://rjominn.is/wp-content/static/2012/07/Jonas-Sig-Thyrnigerdid-Radio-Master.mp3\"><strong>\u00deyrniger\u00f0i\u00f0</strong></a><br>This is the first single from J\u00f3nas Sigur\u00f0sson's upcoming third album, \u00dear Sem Himinn Ber Vi\u00f0 Haf (\"Where The Sky Touches The Sea\"). J\u00f3nas, who is widely considered one of the most inventive musicians in Iceland, reinvents himself yet again by introducing electronic influences to his otherwise soulful, folksy and rhythmic sound.

Previously, he shot to attention with this gorgeous cover of The Beach Boys holiday anthem Kokomo. Featuring the vocal talents of Irish stalwarts Jape and Katie Kim, the song is a modern tropical uplift.</p> <p> <em>JAPAN</em>: <a href=\"http://makebelievemelodies.wordpress.com/\"><em>Make Believe Melodies</em></a><br><a href=\"http://soundcloud.com/greeenlinez\"><strong>Greeen Linez</strong></a><strong> \u2013 </strong><a href=\"http://dl.dropbox.com/u/20197641/Greeen%20Linez%20-%20Palm%20Coast%20Freeway%20(Japan).mp3\"><strong>Palm Coast Freeway</strong></a><br>Greeen Linez take a lot of inspiration from City Pop, a style of music that was popular in Japan during the late 80s and early 90s. Palm Coast Freeway captures this luxurious sound quite well, the elegant synths and bass suitable for both a dance club and a bank lobby. Palm Coast Freeway is on the album Things That Fade, which features even more modern takes on the City Pop sound.</p> <p> <em>MALTA</em>: <a href=\"http://www.stagedivemalta.com/\"><em>Stagedive Malta</em></a><br><a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/itsheysus\"><strong>Hey Sus!</strong></a><strong> \u2013 </strong><a href=\"http://www.stagedivemalta.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Hey-Sus-The-Press-Malta.mp3\"><strong>The Press</strong></a><br>Mike and Andrew write tunes under the name Hey Sus! They try to create surfy indie-pop-folk with hip hop beats, provided by Thom.

With the influence of Native Tongues, G-funk and post-Dilla movements, they have created Al Comp\u00e1s Del Soul, a humorous and fresh album that can be downloaded for free on their website. Por Insurgentes is one of their most interesting tracks. Aside from those swell samples, they've pictured an imaginary trip on one of the most important avenues of Mexico City, Insurgentes, which happens to be the longest road that crosses the city north to south, and shows most of its contradictions and emblematic places.</p> <p> <em>PERU</em>: <a href=\"http://sideoftheblog.blogspot.com/\"><em>SoTB</em></a><br><a href=\"http://herzchenschmerzchen.bandcamp.com/\"><strong>Herzchenschmerzchen</strong></a><strong> \u2013 </strong><a href=\"https://dl.dropbox.com/u/17778857/Herzchenschmerzchen%20-%20Tic%20Tac%20%28Peru%29.mp3\"><strong>Tic Tac</strong></a><br>Herzchenschmerzchen, a word written in German and difficult to pronounce, is the name of Maria Jose Jordan's solo project.

Fortune Player was used in an official commercial for this summer's Heineken Open'er Festival (and Coke Live Festival) and caused some internet buzz thanks to its goofy <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrwBaJlvxEY\">video</a>. You may have heard dozens of pop songs based on synth hooks on MAP but what you might not realise is that this singer is white, with Micha\u0142 Ma\u015blak originally from guitar band Searching For Calm.</p> <p> <em>PORTUGAL</em>: <a href=\"http://possoouvirumdisco.blogspot.com/\"><em>Posso Ouvir Um Disco?</em></a><br><a href=\"http://papercutzed.com/\"><strong>PAPERCUTZ</strong></a><strong> \u2013 </strong><a href=\"http://map.super45.cl/map-2012-08/Papercutz_-_Where_Beasts_Die_-_Portugal.mp3\"><strong>Where Beasts Die</strong></a><br>PAPERCUTZ returns to MAP with an exclusive track. Where Beasts Die is from their new album, The Blur Between Us. Bruno Miguel's impressive project has paved its way with hard work, gathering a considerable fanbase outside Portugal.

His most recent EP boasts three layered tracks that highlight this idiosyncratic mix of influences, ranging from local acts like Superaquello to international names such as The Postal Service. En La Playa is a powerful tune featuring guest vocals by Carolina Martinez. With a dreamy pop quality that reminds us of waves slowly crashing at the beach at dusk, the song also addresses Puerto Rico's current state of affairs and the alarming apathy that seems to have taken over its inhabitants. A great lead-off track for a \"political dream-pop\" playlist.</p> <p> <em>ROMANIA</em>: <a href=\"http://babylonoise.wordpress.com/\"><em>Babylon Noise</em></a><br><a href=\"http://www.myspace.com/changingskins\"><strong>Changing Skins</strong></a><strong> \u2013 </strong><a href=\"http://dl.dropbox.com/u/12595881/map%202012/Changing%20Skins%20-%20Perfect%20Foes%20(Romania).mp3\"><strong>Perfect Foes</strong></a><br>Changing Skins is an eclectic Bucharest-based band who rock the thin line between alternative and electronic music.

Harmonium and strings shepherd Seven Hundred Birds into beautifully fragile and exquisitely precise spaces, marrying the raw intensity of Low with the melodic emotiveness of Sigur R\u00f3s. Cinematic stimulation is provided by the song's staggeringly ethereal <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFMiGK4tKpg\">promo video</a>.</p> <p> <em>SINGAPORE</em>: <a href=\"http://wakingupto.wordpress.com/\"><em>I'm Waking Up To...</em></a><br><a href=\"http://muonmagick.com/\"><strong>MUON</strong></a><strong> \u2013 </strong><a href=\"http://wakingupto.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/muon-aqua-assault-singapore.mp3\"><strong>Aqua Assault</strong></a><br>The muon is an elementary particle similar to an electron. MUON is also a musical entity that exists in Singapore, whether as one person (Nick Chan) or more (currently, Jordan, Ren and Adam). Despite its varying states of existence, MUON's music is rather akin to its sub-atomic namesake with its deconstruction of pedantic structures, but also as intelligent, intense and cryptic aural and visual forms. Always exciting and always new, MUON has been forged in its singularity, and their craft emerges through parallel universes.</p> <p> <em>SOUTH KOREA</em>: <a href=\"http://www.koreanindie.com/\"><em>Korean Indie</em></a><br><a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/pages/%EC%9D%B4%EB%9E%91/382238861802968\"><strong>Lang Lee</strong></a><strong> \u2013 </strong><a href=\"http://map.super45.cl/map-2012-08/Lang_Lee_-_Hahaha_-_South_Korea.mp3\"><strong>Hahaha</strong></a><br>Lang Lee could be likened to a Korean Daniel Johnston, but with her own crazy and quirky, sometimes delightfully whimsical, storytelling ranging from teaching Yoda enough Japanese to be able to order green tea to love stories inspired by Kurt Vonnegut.

Pajarita's style can be described as lo-fi pop, dreamy and awesomely catchy for its simpleness and discretion. Animals (ASIMO Remix), though, might be the exception that confirms the rule about her music.</p> <p> <em>SWEDEN</em>: <a href=\"http://www.jajajamusic.com/\"><em>Ja Ja Ja</em></a><br><a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/everythingtime\"><strong>Picture</strong></a><strong> \u2013 </strong><a href=\"http://dl.dropbox.com/u/76825682/Picture%20-%20True.mp3\"><strong>True</strong></a><br>Picture, aka David Kyhlberg from the enigmatic duo Sail A Whale, makes elusive, trance-inducing electronic pop that's nothing short of amazing. True, the title track and first single from his debut EP, is no exception. This is probably as close to The Tough Alliance as you can get in 2012. The EP is out now on one of our favourite labels, Cascine.</p> <p> <em>SWITZERLAND</em>: <a href=\"http://www.78s.ch/\"><em>78s</em></a><br><a href=\"http://www.biggles.ch/\"><strong>Biggles</strong></a><strong> \u2013 </strong><a href=\"http://www.78s.ch/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Let-A-New-World-Begin-Switzerland.mp3\"><strong>Let A New World Begin</strong></a><br>Sven R\u00fcf aka Biggles from Zurich is a singer-songwriter with a special talent for making music that sounds simultaneously humorous and fragile.

  "<p>Ecuador's president, Rafael Correa, has agreed to grant Julian Assange asylum, officials within Ecuador's government have said. The WikiLeaks founder has been holed up at Ecuador's London embassy since 19 June, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/jun/19/julian-assange-wikileaks-asylum-ecuador\" title=\"\">when he officially requested political asylum</a>.</p> <p>\"Ecuador will grant asylum to Julian Assange,\" said an official in the Ecuadorean capital, Quito, who is familiar with the government discussions.</p> <p>On Monday, Correa told state-run ECTV that he would decide this week whether to grant asylum to Assange. Correa said a large amount of material about international law had to be examined to make a responsible, informed decision.</p> <p>Ecuador's foreign minister, Ricardo Pati\u00f1o, indicated that the president would reveal his answer once the Olympic Games were over. But it remains unclear if Assange will be allowed to leave Britain and fly to Ecuador, or the move amounts to little more than a symbolic gesture.</p> <p>At the moment he faces arrest as soon as he leaves the embassy for breaching his bail conditions.</p> <p>\"For Mr Assange to leave England, he should have a safe pass from the British [government]. Will that be possible? That's an issue we have to take into account,\" Pati\u00f1o told Reuters on Tuesday.</p> <p>Government sources in Quito confirmed that despite the outstanding legal issues, Correa would grant Assange asylum \u2013 a move that would annoy Britain, the US and Sweden. They added that the offer was made to Assange several months ago, well before he sought refuge in the embassy, and following confidential negotiations with senior London embassy staff.</p> <p>An official with knowledge of the discussions said the embassy had discussed Assange's request. The British government, however, \"discouraged the idea\", the official said. He described the Swedish government as \"not very collaborative\".</p> <p>The official added: \"We see Assange's request as a humanitarian issue. The contact between the Ecuadorean government and WikiLeaks goes back to May 2011, when we became the first country to see the leaked US embassy cables completely declassified ... It is clear that when Julian entered the embassy there was already some sort of deal. We see in his work a parallel with our struggle for national sovereignty and the democratisation of international relations.\"</p> <p>However, on Tuesday night after the Guardian broke the story Correa wrote on Twitter: \"Rumour of asylum for Assange is false. There is still no decision on the subject. I await report from [Ecuadorian] foreign office.\" Assange retweeted the message.</p> <p>Assange took refuge in the embassy to avoid extradition to Sweden, where he is wanted for questioning over allegations of sexual misconduct. He is said to be living in one room of the diplomatic building, where he has an internet connection.</p> <p>Ecuadorian diplomats believe Assange is at risk of being extradited from Sweden to the US, where he could face the death penalty. Assange's supporters claim the US has already secretly indicted him following WikiLeaks' release in 2010 of US diplomatic cables, as well as classified Afghan and Iraq war logs.</p> <p>Correa and Pati\u00f1o have both said that Ecuador will take a sovereign decision regarding Assange. They say they are seeking to protect Assange's right to life and freedom. On Monday the state-run newspaper El Tel\u00e9grafo <a href=\"http://www.eltelegrafo.com.ec/index.php?option=com_zoo&amp;task=item&amp;item_id=49722&amp;Itemid=2\" title=\"\">confirmed that a decision had been made</a>, although it did not specify what that decision was. It said senior officials had been meeting to iron out the last legal details.</p> <p>Two weeks ago Assange's mother, Christine, paid Ecuador an official visit, following an invitation from the foreign affairs ministry. She met with Correa and Pati\u00f1o, as well as with other top politicians, including Fernando Cordero, head of Ecuador's legislature. Both Pati\u00f1o and Ms Assange appeared visibly touched during a press conference, which had to be briefly suspended when Ms Assange started crying.</p> <p>Ms Assange held several public meetings in government buildings, and in one instance she was accompanied by the head of her son's defence team, Baltasar Garz\u00f3n, the former Spanish judge who ordered the London arrest of Chile's General Pinochet.</p> <p>Other top political figures in Ecuador have been vocal about the government's support of Assange's bid. \"Our comrade the president, who leads our international policy, will grant Julian Assange asylum,\" said Mar\u00eda Augusta Calle, a congresswoman of the president's party, and former head of the Sovereignty, Foreign Affairs and Latin American Integration Commission during the 2008 Constitutional Assembly, during a meeting with Ms Assange.</p> <p>Over the past year and a half, Assange has remained in touch with Ecuador's embassy in London. In April, he interviewed President Correa for his TV show on Russia Today, the English-language channel funded by the Russian government. The interview, which lasted 75 minutes, included a pally exchange in which Assange and Correa bonded over freedom of speech and the negative role of the US in Latin America. At one point Correa joked: \"Are you having a lot of fun with the interview, Julian?\" Assange replied: \"I'm enjoying your jokes a great deal, yes.\"</p> <p>Correa has made international headlines this year for what critics have called a government crackdown on private media. Analysts say that granting the WikiLeaks founder asylum could be a way for him to depict himself as a champion of freedom of speech ahead of the February 2013 presidential elections, in which he is expected to run again.</p>"
