There was more drama in the ninth inning than there was for the first eight innings combined, but the Detroit Tigers managed to hang on to a 2-1 lead, thanks mostly to a strong eight plus inning from Justin Verlander. The Detroit Tigers now have a commanding 3-0 ALCS lead over the New York Yankees.</p> <p>It feels like all signs point to the New York Yankees getting swept tomorrow for the ALCS Game 4, but they will have C.C. Sabbathia going for them, second only to Justin Verlander in guys you want on the mound in an potential elimination game. We'll be liveblogging that game here at 8:00pm EST, not to mention Game 3 of the NLCS between the San Francisco Giants and the St. Louis Cardinals at 4:00pm EST. Hope you'll be there. That will be all from us tonight, however, so thanks to everyone who followed along with us and especially those who chose to contribute.

This is starting to bring up bad memories of the 9th inning of ALCS Game 1.</p> <p>Raul Ibanez is up in the ninth inning with a chance to tie or win the game. This is a frightening situation for Detroit considering recent events. The first pitch? Just outside, ball one.</p> <p>Think these hitters are glad to not be facing Verlander anymore? Nick Swisher is on-deck, he will pinch-hit for Russell Martin if it gets to that. Ibanez takes ball two. I wouldn't give him anything to drive either, Mr. Coke. Ibanez takes a mighty hack at 2-0, everybody knows what he wants to do. 2-1. Coke throws him a fastball out of the zone to see if Ibanez will chase, but it's too far outside. 3-1. Hitter's count on the 9th Inning Home Run Specialist.</p> <p>Ibanez fouls it off. 3-2. The Yankees are down to their last strike for their third straight batter. If they had put together at-bats like this for most of the series they would be the ones about to take a 3-0 series lead.</p> <p>Ibanez fouls off another one. Still 3-2. He swings and misses at a breaking ball and it's all over! The Tigers have won!</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-507e26a6c0e361310bc6d07e\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-17T03:31:50.942Z\">4.31am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Yankees 1- Tigers 2, Top 9th</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Jayson Nix is in to run for Teixeira, representing the tying run. Robinson Cano is in to face Phil Coke. Cano takes the first pitch for ball one. Cano just doesn't want to make the last out of the game here, forget ending any hitless streak.</p> <p>Cano takes the next pitch for a ball. Raul Ibanez is on deck, remember. The Tigers do NOT want to see him. Coke throws Cano a strike. 2-1. Cano fouls the next one to play, the rain is falling and the Yankees are again down to their finally strike. Holy crap is it LOOOOOOUD in Comerica.</p> <p>Coke gets the sign. 2-2, Cano slaps in a base hit to end a 0-29 hitless streak. There are runners on first and second for the Yankees! We have... DRAMA!</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-507e25c5c0e361310bc6d07d\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-17T03:28:05.844Z\">4.28am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Yankees 1- Tigers 2, Top 9th</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Mark Teixeira is out next. He's still representing the tying run remember. Coke starts him off with a strike as well. Teixeira takes the next pitch for a ball, and then fouls one off to fall behind 1-2. The Tigers are just a strike away, and, thankfully, are not facing the St. Louis Cardinals in this situation.</p> <p>Teixeira takes the next pitch. It's a ball. 2-2. The crowd is LOUD. The set and the pitch... and it's just outside. 3-2. The crowd is loud AND mad now. Full count, the struggling Cano on deck. Teixeira hits the next one foul. Pitcher and hitter do this again. Coke takes a sign form Avila.</p> <p>Teixeira hits a base hit to keep the Yankees alive!</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-507e24ed58f91d7bbadac75e\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-17T03:24:29.290Z\">4.24am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Yankees 1- Tigers 2, Top 9th</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Ichiro takes a strike. 0-1.

Ichiro hits a bouncing ball to Infante on the next pitch, and the Tigers are one out away from taking a 3-0 lead in the ALCS.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-507e24a158f91d7bbadac75c\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-17T03:23:14.155Z\">4.23am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Yankees 1- Tigers 2, Top 9th</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Jim Leyland wants Coke to finish up this game.

I'm just going to bring up that factoid.</p> <p>The first pitch to Brett Gardner? A strike. The crowd, buoyed by Leyland's decision, cheers this one loudly. Gardner takes a ball, 1-1, and then fouls one off, 1-2. </p> <p>Gardner is following Nunez's lead, fouling off pitches and either waiting for a mistake or trying to get him out of this game. Gardner takes the next pitch. 2-2. Verlander's at 129. Nobody is out, nobody is on. Gardner fouls off yet another pitch. He's still throwing gas at 98 mph. Gardner hits another one foul. Gardner might be ending Verlander's complete game chances in this at-bat.</p> <p>Gardner finally hits a grounder back to Verlander, who finishes the play, and that will be it for Verlander who receives the loudest ovation of the night. What a job from Verlander. I say that every start it seems, but it's true.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-507e232058f91d7bbadac75a\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-17T03:16:49.126Z\">4.16am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Yankees 1- Tigers 2, Top 9th</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>HOME RUN!</strong> Eduardo Nunez is out, and he falls behind 0-2 before I can even figure out who is hitting. The crowd is noisy-as-heck, like exactly how loud New Yankee Stadium wasn't (except for the booing). Verlander's 0-2 pitch is in the dirt. 1-2. Nunez laces the next one foul into the seats, oof hope that didn't hit anybody.</p> <p>Still a 1-2 count, Nunez fouls off another one. Just keep making him throw pitches, he's at 120. Leyland can't let him pitch into infinity. Nunez hits another screaming liner that just goes foul. Verladner throws another ball, I wonder if those line drives are a sign that he's fading a bit here. Nunez swings at 2-2, fouling off another one, a 99 mph fastball. Just a great, great at-bat from Nunez here. The Yankees want to see the bullpen right here.</p> <p>Nunez hammers a hanging breaking ball that Dirks can't catch it The crowd is stunned!</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-507e21ebc0e361310bc6d078\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-17T03:11:40.115Z\">4.11am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Yankees 0 - Tigers 2, Top 9th</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The bad news for the Yankees?

Why? I have no clue. We are on full midges alert here in Michigan. Omar Infante hits a flyball off him, but like most flyballs this evening that one's not going out. It's just an out.</p> <p>Leyland has his bullpen up just in case, I imagine he doesn't want to wait too long for going to it after the decision not to bring in Octavio Dotel in Game 1.

The last thing anybody wants is a rain out, except maybe the Yankees since that seems to be the only way they could get Verlander out of the game.</p> <p>Boone Logan is still in the game, because why mess with something that's been working, and gets Peralta to line out to Gardner who makes a nifty play in the outfield to rob him of a hit. Gardner then makes another catch on an Avila liner and that will do it for Logan. Girardi wants a pitching change, but fantastic effort by Logan to keep the Yankees in this one.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-507e1fa058f91d7bbadac758\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-17T03:01:52.466Z\">4.01am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Yankees 0 - Tigers 2, Bottom 8th</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The Kirkby Perspective:</p> <p>Quake in Maine, was to keep us all awake, where are the aftershocks New York Yankees?</p> <p>It seems that only Earthquake Valverde was enough to awaken these Yankees bats.

The New York Yankees enter tonight's Game 3 of the American League Championship Series against the Detroit Tigers at Comerica Park in a tough spot. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2012/oct/15/new-york-yankees-detroit-tigers-derek-jeter\">The New York Yankees have already dropped the first two games of the series</a> and now go on the road to face Justin Verlander, arguably the best pitcher in the game.</p> <p>The Yankees <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2012/oct/14/detroit-tigers-new-york-yankees-alcs-game-1-live\">lost their first game against the Tigers </a>despite tying it up in the ninth inning off of now-reassigned Detroit closer Jose Valverde. In the loss, first ballot Hall of Fame shortstop Derek Jeter suffered a season-ending injury, leaving the team without a captain and a flailing New York offense without one of its key contributors. His loss felt even more devastating than the Yankees dropping the series opener. The next game, thanks to a non-existent offense and one <a href=\"http://mlb.si.com/2012/10/14/joe-girardi-yankees-instant-replay-game-2-alcs/\">particularly bad blown call</a>, t<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2012/oct/14/detroit-tigers-new-york-yankees-alcs-game-2-live\">he Yankees lost 3-0</a>, blowing an outstanding outing by starter Hiroki Kuroda pitching on three day's rest for the first time in his U.S. career.</p> <p>The Yankees offense, so potent in the regular season, has sputtered so badly in the postseason that the focus isn't on how the Tigers have been managing to keep New York at bay. The turning point came in the extra innings of Game 1 after Valverde blew a 4 run lead in the most horrifically comic way possible. Detroit could have collapsed then and there, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2012/oct/13/st-louis-cardinals-washington-nationals-nlds-game-5-live\">the Washington Nationals coming unglued in NLDS Game 5</a> against the St. Louis Cardinals comes to mind, but they held on. In Game 2, even when Kuroda was holding them off the basepaths, Detroit's hitters never seemed to worry. The Detroit Tigers are playing with a lot of confidence and tonight they have Justin Verlander, who is good for a complete game shutout every time he's on the mound, while the Yankees have to rely on the still inconsistent Phil Hughes.</p> <p>As far as New York fans go, they won't have Alex Rodriguez or Nick Swisher to kick around anymore, at least not to start the game. The third baseman and the outfielder (if you want to be generous here) are out of Girardi's starting lineup against Verlander. It's a move that would seem absolutely absurd at the start of the MLB Playoffs but now is almost unsurprising. At the very least, with A-Rod and Swisher out this is the most likable Yankees lineup they've put out in eons. (And at least Nick Swisher <a href=\"http://deadspin.com/5951809/yankee-fans-are-really-harshing-nick-swishers-buzz-bro\">won't get his feelings hurt </a>today.)</p> <p>Is this a Yankees lineup that is good enough to defeat the Tigers on the road, against the best pitcher alive, and avoid falling into a 0-3 hole in the ALCS?

  "<!-- Block 1 --> <p>Barney will be here shortly. Until then here's a preview.</p> <blockquote> <p>The captain, Robbie Keane, will lead the Republic of Ireland into their must-win clash with the Faroe Islands. The 32-year-old, who missed Friday night's 6-1 home defeat by Germany with an achilles injury, has had an injection and will start the game in Torshavn.</p> <p>The LA Galaxy striker insisted in the build-up to the game that the players remain unequivocally behind their manager, Giovanni Trapattoni, whose position has been put at risk by recent poor results, and denied talk of disharmony in the dressing-room. \"Of course we are [behind him],\" he said. \"Listen, there are always going to be rifts in the camp and we certainly know that as players. The players who are not playing are going to be disappointed \u2013 that's normal. Every week since I have been playing football, every week there is one argument in the team, every week in clubs.</p> <p>\"It's normal, it's natural and it happens all the time. Unfortunately we are in a bubble here with the Irish set-up. It's a bubble and stuff gets out and that's no problem. But this happens every week in football. Last week before I left LA Galaxy, it happened; two weeks before that, it happened and when I was at Tottenham, it happened. It happens all the time.</p> </blockquote> <p><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/oct/15/republic-ireland-robbie-keane-faroe\"><br>To continue reading click here.</a></p> <!-- Block 2 --> <p>6.44pm: <strong>Hello and welcome</strong> to the clockwatch on what promises to be a night of ... Well, of football anyway. I will be here with news, goals and non-specific points arising from around Europe. You can email me your \"thoughts\", observations and spittle-flecking banter-attacks via the above address. England's initially promising, but ultimately rather meek and menadering 2-1 defeat in Warsaw kicks off in an hour and ten minutes. All the other home nations are in action, as are Ireland and most of the rest of the Euro zone.</p> <!-- Block 3 --> <p>6.54pm: Some teams coming in. Ireland play the Faroes. This Ireland: <br>Westwood, Coleman, O'Shea, O'Dea, Wilson, Brady, Andrews, McCarthy, McGeady, Keane, Walters. <br>Subs: Forde, Ward, Clark, McShane, Kelly, Fahey, Meyler, Clifford, Long, Cox,<br>Randolph. <br>It'll be fine. No, really. It. Will. Be. Fine. <br>Also, some news just in: England Under-21s have qualified for next year's European Championship after beating Serbia 1-0 in Krusevac, Jane Austen cad Conor Wickham scoring the only goal in the last minute. Danny Rose was sent off at the end after some kind of disgraceful melee. I'm hearing word that Steve Wigley was punched in the face by at least one Serbian player. Poor old Steve Wigley.... But another successful tournament qualification for international management's Stuart Pearce.</p> <!-- Block 4 --> <p>7.01pm: Scotland have made one change for the game in Brussels, James McArthur coming in for Scott Brown. And more on England v Serbia: some talk that Rose may have been provoked by something unpleasant from the crowd. \"Very unsavoury scenes\" is the word. Oh dear.</p> <!-- Block 5 --> <p>7.04pm: The England team is in too. It is: Hart; Johnson, Jagielka, Lescott, Cole; Gerrard, Carrick; Cleverley, Rooney, Milner; Defoe. I've got them in a 4-2-3-1, but then I wear the velveteen beret of the tactical sophisticate. Not a bad team at all, given, well, given everything. They look a little better equipped to hold on to the ball, a little less linear. Milner will run around a lot. It could be worse.</p> <!-- Block 6 --> <p>7.09pm: Wales and Croatia are away in Zagreb:\" it is currently goalless albeit Wales, playing in a weird Liverpool away circa 1994 green and white halves kit have hardly touched the ball, instead standing around while looking Modric has a little game on his own. Good save from Price there palming round a Srna free kick. Looks like a long night ahead.</p> <!-- Block 7 --> <p>7.13pm: A lot of talk about Steven Gerrard and Ashley Cole winning their 99th caps tonight. Does anyone really care about that kind of thing? Jeremain Lens has scored for Holland who are 1-0 up in Romania, never an easy place to go, particularly if you get chased by as pack of wild dogs, not in the mountains, not across the fields, but <em>in the main train station of a major city</em>.</p> <!-- Block 8 --> <p>7.19pm: It's still 0-0 in Torshavn. Ireland are on top, as you might expect. But. It's still 0-0. Hmm. Also 0-0 between Wales and Croatia, where Chris Coleman is stalking the touchline in his spiffy suit looking attractively haunted, like an ageing boyband member about to break into a particularly fraught and moving rain-sodden ballad.</p> <!-- Block 9 --> <p>7.24pm: Oh I say. This from the PA report just filed on England's stormy victory in Serbia tonight. It's not good: </p> <blockquote> <p>\"Players appeared to be pelted with missiles after Connor Wickham struck in injury time of the second leg to book England's trip to next summer's finals in Israel.<br>Supporters came onto the field, scuffles broke out and England's Danny Rose was sent off after the final whistle. He reacted angrily by kicking away the ball and appeared to indicate he had been racially abused as he left the pitch.<br>Steve Wigley, one of the England coaching staff, also appeared to become caught up in the trouble as the players left the field.\" </p> </blockquote> <p>That's longhand for \"got punched in the face\" by the way.</p> <!-- Block 10 --> <p>7.26pm: Lovely slaloming run by Bale in Zagreb. He's tripped and takes the free kick himself. Whips it in but unfortunately Gareth Bale can't get a head on it and neither can Gareth Bale get round the back, or pick it up and smash it in from the edge of the area. One Gareth Bale. There's only one of them. And... Oh dear. Croatia 1-0 Wales. A woeful goal to concede. Terrible back pass by Williams, awful attempted clearance by Price, charged down by Mandzukic, who then rolls the ball into the net. Abysmal defending after an encouraging half hour....</p> <!-- Block 11 --> <p>7.31pm: Holland are 2-0 up in Romania. And, as you may have already gathered, <strong>England's game in Warsaw is now in a little bit of doubt </strong>after torrential rain. The roof - because there is, to be clear, a roof - has <em>remained open</em> throughout. Amazing really. The pitch is absolutely sodden, puddles everywhere. The roof, lest we forget, has <em>remained open.</em> And we're hearing there will be a decision at 8.00pm, which is kick off time. It might yet go ahead under the roof I'm hearing. Farcical scenes.</p> <!-- Block 12 --> <p>7.38pm: Mr Roy looks absolutely steaming about all this and it really does look a bit odd that things have allowed to come to this. Surely satellite weather forecast + roof on stadium = no matches ever called off ever again. But I can't see how they can play on that swamp. NB <em>It's still 0-0 in Torsvollor. </em> Hmm...</p> <!-- Block 13 --> <p>7.41pm: It isn't going to happen. It really isn't. They can \"wait 20 minutes\" if they like but it's still going to be a paddy field. Hodgson is stomping about out there booting a ball into the puddles and shaking his head. The crowd are jeering. And well might they jeer. Romania have pulled one back at home to Holland. Bosnia are 2-0 up against Lithuania. And Paul Doyle tells me Ireland are currently under the cosh against the Faroes: \"They need half time to come\". The Faroes are launching it long into the Ireland box, while Ireland, when they can, launch it long into the Faroes box at the other end. It all sounds very nice. Half time now.</p> <!-- Block 14 --> <p>7.47pm: Half time too in Zagreb. <strong>Croatia 1-0 Wales.</strong> And some talk England may now stay another day and play tomorrow night. This also just in: <br><strong>Spain</strong> Casillas, Sergio Ramos, Arbeloa, Jordi Alba, Iniesta,<br>Xavi, Fabregas, Alonso, Busquets, Silva, Pedro<br><strong>France</strong> Lloris, Koscielny, Debuchy, Evra, Sakho, Valbuena, Cabaye, Gonalons, Ribery, Benzema, Menez<br>Oh well. Consolations, consolations...</p> <!-- Block 15 --> <p>7.54pm: Also 0-0 Belgium v Scotland, albeit Scotland haven't really had a kick yet. Never mind, though. That was always the plan. McGregor has made two incredible saves already. Keep them coming.</p> <!-- Block 16 --> <p>7.58pm: Belgium really are a good team these days, they pass the ball beautifully. Scotland look frazzled already. 13 minures gone and Steven Fletcher has just gone down with a bit of a kick on his leg to \"give everybody a breather\". Actually he looks like he might be suffering some genuine ankle-knack. And <strong>Ireland have scored</strong>. <strong>Faroe Islands 0-1 Ireland</strong>. It's a brilliant goal too from Mark Wilson, dribbling past two men and smashing in a deflected 20-yard shot. Elsewhere Germany are 1-0 up against Sweden, Miroslav Klose scoring his 247th international goal.</p> <!-- Block 17 --> <p>8.06pm: Oh. Oh right. The incumbent FIFA delegate has announced that they will \"do everything they can\" to get England's game in Warsaw going in the next 45 minutes. Which, unless they've got an enormous mattress-like 80 meter square piece of kitchen roll, isn't going to be very much. With so many fans in the stadium, TV pressure, the logistical costs they will be desperate to get it on. But it is still absolutely soaked. Germany, needless to say, are 2-0 up, Miroslav Klose scoring his 542nd international goal. And it's now <strong>Stoke 2-0 Faroe Islands</strong>. Jon Walters this time. Ireland are turning it on. Very faintly. With a tiny rumble of trapped revs.</p> <!-- Block 18 --> <p>8.14pm: Christina Melia writes: Seriously, we're playing a bunch of milkmen and sheep farmers and we can barely string a few passes together! I haven't been this embarassed to be Irish since, em, last Friday ....\" A little harsh maybe. Faroes currently being sort-of put to the sort-of sword. And <a href=\"http://www.101greatgoals.com/gvideos/connor-wickhams-goal-danny-roses-red-card-brawl-amid-racist-claims-england-u21-v-serbia-u21/\">here via 101greatgoals.com </a>is some frankly rather upsetting footage of the horrible scenes in Serbia earlier tonight. Punches, kicks, racial abuse apparently. Poor old Danny Rose, he looks very upset. Don't worry through. They'll probably get a \u00a340,000 fine.</p> <!-- Block 19 --> <p>8.21pm: Itlay are 1-0 up against Denmark, Riccardo Montolivo (adopts James Richardson \"Montoleevo\"-style voice) the goalscorer. And it's <strong>Croatia 2-0 Wales</strong>, Eduardo the scorer on what is now a really rather flaky pitch. And, oh, I say. It's Ireland 2-1 Faroe Islands. A lovely move, cross from the right, nice header from Hansen.</p> <!-- Block 20 --> <p>8.25pm: Here's a thing from Kari Tulinius who is watching Spain play France: \"David Silva was just taken off injured, Cazorla coming on instead. The French TV presenters haven't said anything about how serious it is beyond saying that this was bad news for Manchester City.\" It certainly is. If only they had a vastly over-stocked carbon-funded squad of indolent millionaire thoroughbreds on which to call when... Oh. Kari goes on: \"Spain is controlling the game like the eleven-tentacled octopus that it is, and France haven't shown themselves to be likely to do anything. That said, they are getting more interceptions than you usually see against Spain, though they haven't done much with it.\" Sounds like my kind of not much going on.</p> <!-- Block 21 --> <p>8.29pm: They're turning it on now. <strong>Ireland 3-1 Faroe Islands</strong>. A cross from Walters is volleyed home by a Faroes defender. England players have apparently got changed are about to do one in Warsaw. You can't really blame them. And it's <strong>Spain 1-0 France</strong>, the goal from soft-shoed defensive dreamboat Sergio Ramos</p> <!-- Block 22 --> <p>8.38pm: It is pretty much all over bar the waterlogged calling-off in Warsaw. Some fans now on the pitch sliding about in the puddles. Elsewhere Germany are 3-0 up against Sweden. It's 0-0 at half time between Belgium and Scotland, who have done a lot of running aorund. And Kevin Smith writes: \"Hope you can cover Canada vs Honduras, starting at 4pm EST (9pm for you). We (Canada) just need a draw to go through to the next round, whereas Honduras needs the win to eliminate us, but it's in Honduras where the fans throw bags of piss at our team and fans.\" Sadly not. But I like the bags of piss.</p> <!-- Block 23 --> <p>8.40pm: There is a lovely-looking game of football going on right now between Spain and France. Still 1-0 to <em>them Peter</em>, but France have just gone close. And Peter Corway is feeling droll. \"Own goals is an Irish international I see. Remember his blistering performance for United in the 2009/2010 season? He finished the season with 12 goals for United. I always wondered what happened to him...\" Pressure. They're a product of pressure. And fluke. Flukey pressure.</p> <!-- Block 24 --> <p>8.45pm: Spain have just missed a penalty, awarded for a comical clattering of Pedro by Laurent Koscielny. Great save by Lloris plunging away to his right. Not sure at first glance who missed it. A small dark haired man. Is that any help? Lloris then makes a brilliant double-save from Fabregas. It's all <em>Them</em> right now. Meanwhile it's <strong>Ireland 4-1 Faroe Islands </strong> the most recent goal from 1970s light entertainment impressario Darren O'Dea.</p> <!-- Block 25 --> <p>8.50pm: It was Fabregas who missed the penalty against France, although you have to say it was a brilliant save. Holland are 4-1 up in Romania with thoughts already turning to the pack of wild dogs in the hotel bar. And Osvaldo has been sent off for Italy for, of all things \"violent conduct\".</p> <!-- Block 26 --> <p>8.53pm: Ulla Weinberg writes: \"Surely the trouncing Sweden is getting from the fab German team is worth more than a one liner?! One more goal, and Klose has reached the national record!\" Presumably that's Gerd Muller's record, albeit he got them in roughly the same amount of games. <strong>Poland v England is now officially off at last.</strong> No word yet on what we're all supposed to do now. As Duncan Brown points out, you wouldn't get this problem in Qatar.</p> <!-- Block 27 --> <p>9.06pm: So, where are we then? Lots to tell this evening. <strong>England's game in Warsaw has been postponed due to a waterlogged pitch</strong> and will now be played at 4pm tomorrow. Chaotic scenes of scuffles, racism, racist scuffles and general hatefulness in Serbia as England won 1-0 to qualify. Ireland have beaten the Faroes 4-1. Scotland and Belgium are 0-0, with Scotland creeping back into things. Spain are 1-0 up against France so that's the end of that. Germany are 4-1 up against Sweden, where Zlatan has just scored. Northern Ireland are currently holding Portugal 0-0. And Wales have lost 2-0 to Croatia on a ploughed field in Osijek.</p> <!-- Block 28 --> <p>9.13pm: <strong>Belgium 1-0 Scotland</strong> and let's be honest they deserve it. Benteke with a nice header at the back post. Sweden have pulled it back to 4-2 against new, fun, freewheeling, surprisingly inefficient Germany. It's now <strong>Belgium 2-0 Scotland</strong> , Vincent Kompany with a brilliant strike. And Andy Waddington wants answers: \"Who gets the bigger fine after today's insanity? Poland or Serbia? Who is that ref in the England - Serbia game? Is it even possible that he gave Rose a yellow card for kicking the ball away *after the game had ended* ?\" Serbia. I don't know look it up. And yes.</p> <!-- Block 29 --> <p>9.18pm: Niall Mullen is cross: \"Gerd M\u00fcller's international record is a beautiful thing. 68 in 62! It's a stat that should be imprinted on a sports fan's consciousness alongside 99.97\". Yessir. I am, let me remind you, watching 23 football matches simultaneously. Italy are 3-1 up against Denmark, Mario Balotelli scoring the third goal. And get this: <strong>Portugal 0-1 Northenr Ireland!!</strong>. Niall McGinn has just scored a lovely goal and the last team to beat Spain in a qualifier are currently in the process of making Cristiano Ronaldo feel extra sad about things.</p> <!-- Block 30 --> <p>9.22pm: And, wow, this is something: Sweden have now pulled it back to 4-3 against Germany, having been 4-0 down, Johan Elmander with the latest goal. 14 minutes to go. Amazing scenes there. Jogi Low will be wrenching his neckerchief off on the touchline.</p> <!-- Block 31 --> <p>9.30pm: More scores: Hungary are 3-1 up at home to Turkey, which counts as a pretty decent scoreline for the only previously marvelous Magyars. Austria have thrashed Kazhakstan 4-0 completing a rare night of Austro-Hungarian imperial sporting dominance. Montenegro are 1-0 up in Ukraine, which isn't necessarily what England want to hear. And the piss-bag chuckers of Honduras are 1-0 up against Canada. And Joe Ludlam points out: \"Either Niall Mullen's fingers are too fat to use the numpad correctly, or someone needs to explain the significance of 99.97 in sport. MJ McCague's test bowling average?\" Bradman was, of course, 99.94. I assumed it was Alastair Cook's strike rate in T20 internationals.</p> <!-- Block 32 --> <p>9.37pm: Half time in Portugal and Northern Ireland are still 1-0 up. He he. Cristiano Ronaldo was presented with some kind of special award on the pitch before the game. Maybe, just maybe, not quite the right moment. And <strong>Scotland have finally finished losing 2-0 to Belgium.</strong> No doubt there will be calls for Craig Levein to go so that someone else can lose 2-0 to Belgium next year instead. And,... blimey. <strong>Final score: Germany 4-4 Sweden.</strong> Rasmus Elm with the last minute equaliser. Has anything like that has ever happened to Germany before? What an astonishing result. Germany were 4-0 up. Maybe they need to revamp their entire youth structure.</p> <!-- Block 33 --> <p>9.44pm: Some sour grapes in the moment of Swedish ecstasy from JR in Illinois: \"Unbelievable result in Germany but I'll just take this opportunity to mention that Sweden's last goal came as a result of a clear foul when Ibra jammed his arm into Mertesacker's face as he was trying to head the ball out of danger. Oh well, I guess.\" Oh well indeed. Nice to see the big man putting it about.</p> <!-- Block 34 --> <p>9.46pm: Montenegro have beaten Ukraine 1-0 and join England on seven points at the top of the Group. Troubling times for Roy. Nobody likes games in hand. It looks weird and somehow they never quite work out the way you want. And some incredible scenes in Spain where Olivier Giroud has scored with the last touch of the game to equalise: <strong>Spain 1-1 France</strong> is a final score, a thrilling end to a game of many - so many - short sideways passes, interspersed with the odd brilliant save from US TV medical hunk Hugo Lloris. Santi Cazorla gave the ball away with ten seconds remaining. France sprinted upfield and scored.</p> <!-- Block 35 --> <p>9.56pm: And with that it's time for me to day goodnight. Thanks for your emails. I'll be back soon. England will be back tomorrow. Barney.</p>",
  "<!-- Block 1 --> <p>Paul will be here shortly. Until then why not read Ewan Murray's blog on Craig Levein?</p> <blockquote> <p><br>It seems impossible to ignore the feeling that Craig Levein's Scotland tenure is doomed. Or, indeed, that it has now entered its closing stages.</p> <p>Friday's loss in Wales all but extended a Scottish absence from major tournaments to 16 years. For a nation which was once accustomed to appearances at World Cups and European Championships, and one which remains football obsessed, that's a tough pill to swallow.</p> <p>Levein has never been fully embraced by Scotland's fans, a matter only endorsed by the claiming of just two points from three World Cup qualifying matches.

Berra is having none of that.</p> <!-- Block 6 --> <p><strong>2 min:</strong> Scotland, who are clad in white, no doubt as a tribute to their friends south of the border, are struggling to get hold of the ball ... perhaps also in tribute to their south of the border.</p> <!-- Block 7 --> <p><strong>3 min:</strong> Oh! Scotland survive thanks to two superb saves by McGregor! After Belgian zipped the ball around the box, Caldwell made a far too feeble attempt to disposses Mertens, who skipped past him and fired at goal from close range. McGregor blocked it brilliantly and the tipped away the rebound too.</p> <!-- Block 8 --> <p><strong>5 min:</strong> Scotland are all over the shop early doors, looking nervous and, well, bad. Only last-ditch tackles are stopping Belgium from being in front already. \"It's good that Uefa have opted for a sensible and impartial Ref. A German Irish American with only loyalties to Sicillans, as well as a very cool head under pressure is just what's needed. Just hope it doesn't kick off, everyone knows Tom Hagen isn't a wartime consigliere.\"</p> <!-- Block 9 --> <p><strong>7 min:</strong> Berra and Caldwell join forces to prevent Benteke getting on the end of a well-intentioned pass. That gives Scotland a chance to string some passes together. Any minute now they may make it into the Belgian half. \"I remember when following Scotland was worth the effort,\" writes Roderick Stewart plaintively. \"I stopped revising for my finals to watch Archie Gemmill against Holland. I helped smuggle a radio into the dressing room of our school's production of The Pirates of Penzance during the 1974 world cup. I recall Archie MacPherson's \"mind your heels, Billy\" in one of his his commentaries. I (just) remember Jim Baxter claiming the world cup from England at Wembley in 1967. Where did it all go wrong? Is it too much to ask to have a team that doesn't embarrass us? Will we be any better after independence?\"</p> <!-- Block 10 --> <p><strong>10 min:</strong> McGregor to the rescue again! He hurtles off line to prevent Chadli from collecting a lovely through-ball by Kompany. It tells you how this game has been going that Kompany is joining in attack at the edge of the Scottish area in open play.</p> <!-- Block 11 --> <p><strong>12 min:</strong> I must say, I like what Marc Wilmots has done with Belgium since taking charge. They are playing with cracking pace and intensity so far, on top of the class they've had for a few years. They really look like they're getting things together. Wonder if he'd fancy replacing Craig Levein? Who would like to suggest one good reason why he should leave Belgium for Scotland?</p> <!-- Block 12 --> <p><strong>14 min:</strong> Belgium, applying what has - infuriatingly - become the convention, put the ball out of play so Steven Fletcher can get treatment for some manner of ankle injury, sustained I don't know how. On come the trainers, before he he limps off for further treatment. Ominous.</p> <!-- Block 13 --> <p><strong>17 min:</strong> Benteke flicks the ball on nicely to the overlkapping Vertonghen, who blems mercifully wide from 12 yards.</p> <!-- Block 14 --> <p><strong>19 min:</strong> Witsel tugs Maloney' shirt on the edge of the Scottish, stupidly conceding a freekick to give Scotland a chance for some respite.</p> <!-- Block 15 --> <p><strong>22 min:</strong> Wow! Scotland are proving almost cockroachesque in their survival capacity at the moment! Belgium are trying to blow them away and again came within inches of scoring just now but Benteke fails to tip the ball into the from a few yards after another lighting move by Belgium.</p> <!-- Block 16 --> <p><strong>24 min:</strong> A shot from Scotland! And a very good one, to boot! Maloney curled a delightful 25-yard freekick towards the top cotner but Courtois plunged to his right to tip it around the post.</p> <!-- Block 17 --> <p><strong>26 min:</strong> Scotland survive again! Benteke, who has linked up really well so far, laid the ball back to Chadli, who went for a dainty curler from the edge of the area but didn't quite get enough bend on it.</p> <!-- Block 18 --> <p><strong>28 min:</strong> De Bruyne scurries past three and then feeds the ball wide to Demb\u00e9l\u00e9, whose cross from the left is cut out by the excellent McGregor.</p> <!-- Block 19 --> <p><strong>31 min:</strong> Vergonghen shows impressive skill to scorch his way into the Scottish, but two defenders and Darren Fletcher converge on him to eventually curtail his run.</p> <!-- Block 20 --> <p><strong>33 min:</strong> Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 flashes a fierce shot inches wide from 20 yards. Mertens does the same within a minute. This match has so far been as uneven as the clash between Tintin and the gang of fraudsters (and their pet gorilla Ranko) when the boy reporter went to Scotland. Mind you, Tintin triumphed in the end in that ...</p> <!-- Block 21 --> <p><strong>37 min:</strong> Elsewhere in this group, Mandzukic and Eduardo have given Croatia a 2-0 lead over Wales.</p> <!-- Block 22 --> <p><strong>38 min:</strong> McGregor has been in magnificent form so far tonight ... but Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 seems to think the keeper's been fluking it so far: because he seemingly remains convinced he can beat him from distance. His latest effort flies way wide from 25 yards.</p> <!-- Block 23 --> <p><strong>39 min:</strong> Remember this Scotland fans: things could be worse. Indeed, your friends from the Republic of Ireland have emphasised taht point just now ... by conceding to the Faroe Islands. Ireland are leading 2-1, but hanging on with 20 minutes to go. Outrageous.</p> <!-- Block 24 --> <p><strong>41 min:</strong> A Belgian attack breaks down and Scotland counter quickly, before Maloney is felled. Freekick to Scotland about 26 yards out. Commons curls as decent effort on target, and Courtois punches it behind for a corner, which comes to nothing.</p> <!-- Block 25 --> <p><strong>43 min:</strong> McGregor looks fallible for the first time, as he grapples weakly for an Alderweireld cross from the right. Fortunately for Scotland, Benteke heads over from close range.</p> <!-- Block 26 --> <p><strong>Half-time:</strong> It's quite a feat for Scotland to have made it to the break without having conceded, what with Belgian having utterly dominated proceedings. McGregor is the main man to thank for that, although, in fairness, after looking in disarray early on, Scotland have regrouped and defended in quite well in the second part of the half. There's no denying the team's commitment. A break-away victory remains a possibility, albeit an extremely unlikely one.</p> <!-- Block 27 --> <p><strong>46 min:</strong> Thought the first half was tough for Scotland? Well here comes Eden Hazard, as substitute for Demb\u00e9l\u00e9. But watch out Belgium: because Scotland are throwing on Jamie Mackie! Commons has come off.</p> <!-- Block 28 --> <p><strong>48 min:</strong> Vertonghen hurls a long throw into the Scottish box, but the Scots deal with it well and launch a counter-attack ... until Maloney is upended on half-way line.</p> <!-- Block 29 --> <p><strong>50 min:</strong> Alderweireld hoists in a fine cross from the right, and Benteke jumps way above Caldwell to direct a strong header .... against the bar!</p> <!-- Block 30 --> <p><strong>52 min:</strong> Scotland half-clear a Belgian corner, Hazard collects it some 25 yards out and let fly with a ferocious volley, which Caldwell blocks at the edge of the six-yard box.</p> <!-- Block 31 --> <p><strong>54 min:</strong> It was a 4-6-0 formation that first attracted scorn for Levein and in his moment of greatest need he has all but reverted to it now: and it's frustrating Belgium.</p> <!-- Block 32 --> <p><strong>Belgium substitution:</strong> Mertens off, Mirallas on.</p> <!-- Block 33 --> <p><strong>57 min:</strong> Croatia have beaten Wales 2-0. Ireland have beaten the Faeroe Islands 4-1. Scotland are starting to piece together some offensive moves; could they really spring a surprise?</p> <!-- Block 34 --> <p><strong>59 min:</strong> Caldwell nods a long Belgian ball back to mcgregor. Are Belgian really running out of ideas already? \"Ah well, James didn't win the Bake-Off,\" sobs Simon MacMahon. \"John did. A valiant effort from the Scot, lots of effort with some moments of individual brilliance, but in the end not quite enough strength in depth and lacking in technical ability. Sound familiar?\"</p> <!-- Block 35 --> <p><strong>61 min:</strong> After Vertonghen punts a cross way out of play, Mcgregor dallies in taking the goal kick .... and is punished with a yellow card.</p> <!-- Block 36 --> <p><strong>63 min:</strong> Hazard, playing deeper than usual, is strugglign to influence the game. Lots of flitty touches but no end-product so far, thanks partially to diligent Scottish defending.</p> <!-- Block 37 --> <p><strong>64 min:</strong> Vertonnghen stretches out his left let to apply a crucial touch just as Mackie look like getting on the end of a cross at the back post. Caldwell meets the ensuing corner but can't keep his header down.</p> <!-- Block 38 --> <p><strong>66 min:</strong> Witsel runs into McArthur and is rewarded with a freekick in a dangerous position. Hazard sizes it up ... and then curls it wide from 25 yards.</p> <!-- Block 39 --> <p><strong>67 min:</strong> That's better from Belgium, but they are again foiled by valiant last-ditch defending, this time it was Hutton throwing himself in front of a shot from 10 yards. The ball was then worked back to De Bruyne, who sends in a swirling shot from 20 yards that McGregor beats away with difficulty.</p> <!-- Block 40 --> <p><strong>GOAL! Belgium 1-0 Scotland (Benteke 69')</strong> Scotland's resistance is broken! And they contributed to their own downfall their, nodding off to allow De Bruyne to tap a quick corner to hazard, who drew two defenders and then knocked it back to De Bruyne, who floated a superb cross to the back post. Benteke met it and headed an unstoppable shot into the net from close range.</p> <!-- Block 41 --> <p><strong>GOAL! Belgium 2-0 Scotland (Kompany 71') </strong> That is a magnificent goal by Kompany! He received the ball with his back to the goal at the edge of the area, then spun around, sidestepped McArthur and thundered a shot into the net from 16 yards! Obviously learned that He learned that from Joleon Lescott.</p> <!-- Block 42 --> <p><strong>73 min:</strong> Levein leaving? There is no hint of Scotland being able to get back into this. Or, indeed, being able to get the ball back at the moment ...</p> <!-- Block 43 --> <p><strong>74 min:</strong> Belgium want more and there is extra panache in their play now. A flowing move cuts Scotland apart and concludes with Hazard sending a tame low shot at McGregor from 15 yards.</p> <!-- Block 44 --> <p><strong>76 min:</strong> Who thinks this will alter the course of the match? Scotland have taken off Steven Fletcher, who barely touched the ball, and introduced Kenny Miller. \"Pah!\" blurts Audrey Andersen. \"There goes our \u00a315 bet on Scotland snatching victory from the jaws of defeat....still: 14 mins to go!\"</p> <!-- Block 45 --> <p><strong>78 min:</strong> Scotland are trying. They're sending men forward. Their intention is good, at least. Morrison sprints into the box to receive a pass from Hutton and then crosses from the by-line, but Courtois cuts it out.</p> <!-- Block 46 --> <p><strong>80 min:</strong> Scotland's last throw of the dice: Morrison off, Matt Phillips on.</p> <!-- Block 47 --> <p><strong>81 min:</strong> Chadli booked for a foul on Maloney. Scotland are putting together some decent moves here and hinting at bother for Belgium. Which, of course, also spells bother for Levein, since it prompts the obvious question: if they are capable of worrying their hosts now, why didn't they try harder to do so earlier?</p> <!-- Block 48 --> <p><strong>83 min:</strong> Scotland's brief revolt appears to have faded. The home crowd are now ol\u00e9ing as the hosts pop the ball about for fun. Elsewhere in this group, Macedonia have beaten Serbia 1-0 at home, which, of course, Scotland failed to do.</p> <!-- Block 49 --> <p><strong>85 min:</strong> Belgium are about to make another change, with 25-year-old Ilomb\u00e9 Mboyo coming on in place of Benteke to win his first cap just a few years after being released from prison. Levein does not like he will be getting out of metaphorical jail here. \"The good news of this for Scotland fans is that Levein's tenure is over,\" hurrahs Michael Bacon. \"The US phrase for a manager like him is 'player's coach' - a coach who spends too much of his time trying to be popular with the players. Player's coaches usually don't win very much.\"</p> <!-- Block 50 --> <p><strong>88 min:</strong> Hazard attempts another long-range freekick, with similar results to the previous ones. Over the bar.</p> <!-- Block 51 --> <p><strong>89 min:</strong> Our man in Brussels, Ewan Murray (@mrewanmurray), has just tweeted thusly: \"The Scotland fans, who have been terrific tonight, are now leaving in scores. One banner reads 'Strachan SOS'\"</p> <!-- Block 52 --> <p><strong>90+2 min:</strong> A token shot by McArthur poses no problem to Courtois. \"The saddest thing for me, Paul, is that I'm not even that sad,\" chirps Simon MacMahon. \"Just resigned. Right now, it doesn't feel like either of my daughters (Evie and Anna, since you ask) will ever see Scotland in a major finals. Bottom of the group. Bottom. Maybe we should all just take up baking.\" Let us eat cake, is basically what you're saying.</p> <!-- Block 53 --> <p><strong>Full-time:</strong> Two fine goals rewarded Belgian dominance by eventually piercing a Scotland team that had defended well but offered little else. Craig Levein's men are now bottom of the Group A, eight points off a play-off spot. Craig Levein's men will probably be known as someone else's men very soon ...</p>",

  "<p>Cuba will open its exit doors wider than at any time in 50 years following migration reforms announced on Tuesday that will make it easier for citizens to go overseas. Under the new government policy, most Cubans will no longer require an exit visa or letter of invitation to leave the country.</p> <p>The change raises the prospect of increased travel, particularly to the US.</p> <p>There will continue to be limits affecting certain members of society, however. Doctors, scientists and military staff could be restricted, in a government effort to prevent a brain drain of people who have benefited most from Cuba's highly regarded state education and health systems.</p> <p>The big shift in migration policy follows economic and social reforms by the president, Ra\u00fal Castro, which loosen controls on sales of private property, mobile phone ownership and hotel stays, and aim to make the island more attractive to foreign investors.</p> <p>The exit visa system dates to 1961, when the government tightened border controls to stem a flood of migrants amid tensions with the US and unease among some sectors of society about the 1959 revolution that put Fidel Castro in power.</p> <p>Abolition of the system, which will come into effect before 14 January, is likely to be popular because it will save time and money for tourists and for those who want to work overseas or visit relatives among the large diaspora in the US. Exit visas cost about $150, roughly a third of the average monthly wage.</p> <p>The change, which was promised by Ra\u00fal Castro when he became president in 2008, was announced by the Communist party newspaper Granma.</p> <p>\"As part of the work underway to update the current migratory policy and adjust it to the conditions of the present and the foreseeable future, the Cuban government, in exercise of its sovereignty, has decided to eliminate the procedure of the exit visa for travel to the exterior,\" read the notice.</p> <p>The government has also extended the time Cubans can remain overseas without losing their social security, health benefits and voting rights \u2013 from 11 to 24 months.</p> <p>The exit visa reform will have political ramifications well beyond the island's borders.</p> <p>There are thought to be more than a million Cubans in the US, which has a longstanding policy of granting citizenship to almost all migrants from the island, on which Washington imposed an economic embargo.</p> <p>Sharp economic disparities, political differences and migration controls have prompted many Cubans to migrate illegally in recent decades. Thousands travel via Mexico and other countries in central America each year, sometimes at great risk in unsafe boats.</p> <p>Under the new system, travellers should need only a passport and a visa from the country they intended to visit.</p> <p>But critics said controls on the movement of dissidents were likely to continue,.</p> <p>A dissident blogger, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/yoanisanchez\" title=\"\">Yoani S\u00e1nchez</a>, who was detained by the authorities this month, tweeted: \"The devil is in the details.\" She said that the new law could be used to prevent overseas travel by Cubans who \"organise or participate in actions that are hostile against the country's political foundation\".</p> <p>Most citizens were thought likely to welcome the change, however.</p> <p>\"There have been many expectations for many years about a new travel law. It's a big step forward that will save us money and simplify the process,\" Rafael Pena, an office worker, told Reuters in Havana.</p>",
  "<p>The US government and its intelligence agencies were influential in the UK government decision to introduce a highly controversial new generation of secret courts, the independent reviewer of terrorism legislation has told MPs and peers.</p> <p>David Anderson QC told parliament's joint human rights committee on Tuesday that he could not know whether the US was the driving force behind the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/law/2012/sep/25/secret-courts-the-essential-guide\" title=\"\">justice and security bill</a> but, after a series of conversations during a visit to America, he concluded: \"I am quite sure they had something to do with it.\"</p> <p>Anderson, who told the committee of MPs and peers on Tuesday that the bill was \"disproportionate\", added that he had been left in no doubt that US officials were genuinely alarmed by the English courts' willingness to disclose information the CIA had passed to British intelligence agencies in the case of Binyam Mohamed, the UK resident who was tortured and rendered to Guant\u00e1namo Bay.</p> <p>Anderson said he was told in Washington that the future of UK-US intelligence sharing depended upon the Britain's ability to \"sort this one out\" before more material was made public.</p> <p>\"It was said to me that there would have to be a reassessment of the intelligence relationship,\" Anderson said.</p> <p>He claimed that what angered US officials most was that an English court was prepared to overrule the view of a foreign secretary \u2013 a reference to David Miliband's evidence during the Mohamed hearings in 2008 that disclosure would damage UK intelligence relations with the US.</p> <p>The sensitive material disclosed in the Mohamed case was a report supplied by the CIA in which they <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/feb/10/binyam-mohamed-torture-evidence-paragraphs\" title=\"\">detailed the manner in which he was being tortured</a> after being detained in Karachi in 2002. It was sent to MI5, who then dispatched one of its officers to Pakistan to interrogate Mohamed.</p> <p>There was \"no rational basis\" for Miliband's claim, the high court ruled, adding that the CIA material should be disclosed \"for reasons of accountability and the rule of law in the United Kingdom\".</p> <p>Anderson was asked by the Labour peer Lady Kennedy how, under the bill, Britain could honour its obligations under the UN convention on torture, which obliges countries to act if they have evidence. He replied that \"accepting a principle\" might lead to a \"pragmatic cost\" \u2013 referring to the prospect of the US cutting on the amount of intelligence it passes to Britain.</p> <p>Anderson <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/law/2012/jun/19/secret-court-genuine-problem-disproportionate\" title=\"\">reiterated his view</a> that the bill, while addressing a genuine problem, did so in a \"disproportionate\" manner. He said judges \u2013 and not ministers, as the bill states \u2013 should have the discretion to decide whether evidence should be heard in secret \u2013 so-called closed material proceedings (CMP) \u2013 and the bill should state clearly that such secrecy should be used only as a last resort.</p> <p>Depriving judges of the discretion over whether to use CMPs would not bolster public confidence in the judiciary or the UK's intelligence and security agencies, Anderson warned, although he accepted that the proposals were about \"more than the convenience of the intelligence services\".</p> <p>The government argues that CMPs are needed to prevent courtroom disclosure of sensitive evidence from causing damage to the so-called \"control principle\" governing intelligence shared between states.</p> <p>Secret evidence, which is already used in terrorism-related immigration tribunals, allows government lawyers to rely on evidence that cannot be seen by victims or claimants, or their lawyers. The evidence can be seen by security-vetted barristers known as special advocates, but they cannot discuss what they have seen. The system is <a href=\"http://ukhumanrightsblog.com/2012/06/14/government-still-not-made-case-for-inherently-unfair-secret-trials-say-special-advocates/\" title=\"\">widely regarded as inherently unfair</a> and would inevitably lead to legal challenges.</p> <p>Anderson suggested that if the bill became law, it should be subjected to annual review. Critics of the bill warned that secret courts could be introduced in more and more cases unrelated to terrorism.</p>",
  "<p>The Vatican has distanced itself from a row over Muslim immigrants in Europe triggered by the showing at a synod of a video that claims \"Europe as we know it will cease to exist.\"</p> <p>Cardinal Peter Turkson, the president of the Vatican's council for justice and peace \u2013 and seen as a possible future pope \u2013 played the disputed video in a discussion period on Saturday during a synod attended by 262 bishops from across the world.</p> <p>Entitled Muslim Demographics, and viewed more than 13m times on YouTube since its release in 2009, the seven-minute long video claims Muslim immigration and higher birth rates means France will become \"an Islamic republic\" within 39 years.</p> <p>But many of the statistics used have been shown to be false or unproven, including a claim that French Muslim families have 8.1 children on average, and that 25% of Belgians are Muslims \u2013 the true figure is 6%. A German government official is falsely quoted as saying Germany will be a Muslim state by 2050.</p> <p>On Tuesday, a Vatican spokesman, Father Federico Lombardi, sought to distance the holy see from the video, saying: \"This video does not express the view of the synod or the Vatican. Turkson has said he is sorry if the video was wrongly interpreted since he did not intend it to be anti-Muslim, merely a comment on the nihilism in western society.\"</p> <p>Bishops who watched the video were reportedly shocked by its content.</p> <p>\"I think it would be fair to say that several in the room questioned the veracity of the facts followed by, 'who can this be attributed to?' and 'who actually wanted this film to be shown?'\" said Father Thomas Rosica during a press briefing on the synod.</p> <p>Vatican radio was more critical, calling the video \"fear mongering\", adding: \"Why one of the curial cardinals chose to show this piece of anti-Islamic propaganda is quite unclear.\"</p> <p>Pope Benedict has stressed the importance of defending Europe's Christian identity, but he has also promoted dialogue with Muslims, most recently during his visit to Lebanon last month. Last week he read out a greeting in Arabic for the first time during his weekly general audience in a bid to ease religious tensions.</p> <p>Turkson, who is from Ghana, has said over the years that theological dialogue with Muslims is impossible. Known for his strong views, the cardinal also proposed the creation of a global bank after the global economic crisis began in 2008.</p> <p>One bishop at the synod asked about the spurious video shown was less critical, telling the National Catholic Reporter: \"At least it got us talking about something more important than what order confirmation and first communion ought to be in.\"</p>",

  "<p>The first visit to the food bank is always the hardest. Michelle Venus, 52, cried. \"Not while I was there,\" she said. \"But before and after.\" Four years earlier, she'd been a homeowner in a $75,000 a year job. She'd donated to the food bank's fundraising drives. Now she was there to pick up food she couldn't afford to buy. \"It was not what I'd expected for myself or from myself. It was just a really hard day.\"</p> <p>Mark Weaver, 54, the former chairman of nearby Loveland chamber of commerce, tried to avoid the gaze of acquaintances he'd met when he attended the food bank's galas. \"It was very humiliating,\" he says. \"I used to take clients to their events, and all of a sudden I'm living below the poverty line.\" He used to earn a six-figure salary plus commission plus benefits, and also chaired the Northern Colorado Legislative Alliance, which lobbied local politicians on behalf of the business community. He made up his mind to go after a friend, a well-paid software engineer who'd also fallen on hard times, told him to: \"Get over being proud.\"</p> <p>The queue at the Larimer County food bank in Fort Collins, a town of 147,000 in northern Colorado, snakes out of the door and is mostly silent. In line there are slightly more people than trolleys. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2011/dec/09/land-of-free-home-of-hungry\">The number of families visiting here</a> has increased more than 50% over the last five years. On average they also visit more often and need more food. </p> <p>In the parking lot there are only two bumper stickers \u2013 one for Mitt Romney and one for the US navy. Inside it is set up like a grocery store. People take what they need, although there are limits for some items such as bread. From the outside, if you didn't know it was a food bank, you might think they were going to the cinema.</p> <p>People often think they know what poverty looks like until they end up here, and then they realise it looks like them and many other people that they know. Weaver lives in a nice area. The first he knew that his next-door neighbour was struggling with his mortgage payments was when his house was foreclosed on and he was moving out.</p> <p>The official poverty rate in the US has risen 19% since 2000 with just under <a href=\"http://www.gallup.com/poll/150122/americans-access-basic-necessities-recession-level.aspx\">one in seven Americans now poor</a> and one in five reporting they did not have enough money to buy food last year.</p> <p>But since the beginning of the financial crisis it is the 'precarity rate' that has really taken off \u2013 the number of people who feel economically precarious. Those who fear poverty, look it straight in the eye at the end of every month, face a constant battle to avoid it or slip in and out of it while struggling to retain every semblance of middle-class stability. People who may have high school diplomas, college degrees, pensions, good credit and mortgages, juggling aspiration and reality, who find themselves one lay-off or illness away from a steep and dizzying descent into hardship.</p> <p>More than the half the people who use the Larimer County Food Bank are working. One in 10 have at least a college degree, almost a third have no health insurance and more than half have unpaid medical bills.</p> <p>\"There's been a real difference, not only in the number of people that we serve in recent years,\" explains Amy Pezzani, the food bank's executive director. \"But also in the kind of people we serve. People think that if they're not living in poverty then they're middle class. But the official poverty level is such an unrealistic indicator of economic status. Most of the people who use the food bank are working people. These used to be referred to as 'emergency food pantries', but now it's like people are having an emergency every day. It's really just a way to exist.\"</p> <h2>'There are more people struggling that the official numbers show'</h2> <p>Last year the census bureau <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/08/us/poverty-gets-new-measure-at-census-bureau.html\">released a new measurement of poverty</a>, which takes regional cost of living, medical payments and other expenses into account and found <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/19/us/census-measures-those-not-quite-in-poverty-but-struggling.html\">a third of Americans are either in poverty or desperately close to it</a>. Half are married, almost half are suburban. \"These numbers are higher than we anticipated,\" Trudi Renwick, the bureau's head poverty statistician, told the New York Times. \"There are more people struggling than the official numbers show.\"</p> <p>This is the fragile economic terrain on which the election is being fought: the needs and aspirations of the ever-expanding numbers of America's working poor and the far larger ranks of those anxious about joining them.</p> <p>These are the people most likely to be offended by Mitt Romney's suggestion that 47% of the country see themselves as victims, who most needed the kind of change Obama promised four years ago, and have been least impressed by the apparent lack of it. These are the people at whom the ads attacking Romney's record of outsourcing and asset-stripping at Bain Capital were aimed.</p> <p>They are also the ones the Tea Party sought to galvanise through their populist message against the bailout and in defence of small business. <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/15/us/politics/15poll.html\">A New York Times poll in 2010</a> revealed that more than half of those who identified as Tea Party supporters were concerned that someone in their household would be out of a job in the next year, while more than two-thirds said the recession had been difficult or caused hardship and major life changes.</p> <p>A slim majority of Americans <a href=\"http://www.nationaljournal.com/magazine/winning-has-become-not-losing-20120927\">now define getting ahead as \"not falling behind\"</a>. That describes life for many here in <a href=\"http://larimer.org/compass/exec_summary.htm\">Larimer County</a>, where between 2006 and 2010 <a href=\"http://larimer.org/compass/median_family_income_ec_ind.htm#chart3 \">median family income</a> (adjusted for inflation) shrank by 9% leaving around a third of homeowners <a href=\"http://larimer.org/compass/homeownership_cd_housing.htm#chart4\">paying 30% or more of their income for housing</a>.</p> <p>The number of people using food stamps, and applying for heating assistance over the last six years has rocketed. Over the past 10 years the number of children getting free and reduced lunch doubled, while <a href=\"http://larimer.org/compass/higher_education_enrollment_ed.htm#chart4\">in-state tuition fees at Colorado State University</a>, which has a huge campus in town, increased 138%.</p> <p>The Fort Collins Homelessness Prevention Initiative, which provides one-time grants for emergency rent assistance, has seen a 50% increase in the number of people they are helping every year. \"We mainly serve two kinds of people,\" explains executive director Sue Beck-Ferkiss. \"One are the pay-check surfers who are used to skating by on very little. But we also see more people who are falling out of the middle class. It could be a couple who both worked on contract. The work dries up. But the world doesn't stop just because your income stops. They wipe out their savings and maybe they end up here.\"</p> <h2>'I don't think the Republican party cares about people like me'</h2> <p>Larimer County is a swing county in a swing state. It voted for Bush twice, but went for Obama in 2008. Now Colorado is on the fence and Mark Weaver is right there with it.</p> <p>Mark is one of those rare species this election. An undecided voter with genuinely eclectic views. He's an evangelical Christian who is for gun control and a more humane immigration policy, who wants to rein in the deficit, thinks unions are dinosaurs and is against abortion although he'd rather peoples' hearts changed than legislation. He voted for John McCain last time because he didn't think Obama had the experience, and was a registered Republican until July 4 when, appropriately enough, he registered as an independent.</p> <p>Both campaigns are spending millions to reach him with microtargetting on the issues they think will swing his vote their way. They're also bombarding him with ads. But all they are earning so far is his contempt. \"If you took all the money they spent on the political system and elections you could feed the world,\" Weaver says.</p> <p>He's not particularly impressed by either candidate. \"Somebody's got to fix the economy, but I don't know that either of them has the guts to do it,\" he says. \"I'm looking to vote for someone I like and trust; I've never been more distrustful of the whole thing. I wish we could vote for none of the above. I want a do-over.\"</p> <p>Mark's fortunes began to change in the summer of 2009 when was a human resources manager in a company with 1,500 employees. He was let go and replaced by a colleague 20 years his junior on half his salary. He could have found other work elsewhere in the country, but that would have involved uprooting his three children, and he didn't think that was fair. He got another job in a start-up that involved a long commute and eventually collapsed owing him money. With his mortgage paid off and no debts, the biggest expense for a family of five was healthcare. Since everyone in the family was healthy they contemplated doing without it.</p> <p>Then his youngest daughter got bitten by a rattlesnake. \"That would have been a six-figure healthcare bill,\" he says. \"If we'd gotten rid of healthcare at that point we would have been sunk.\" It was around that time he started going to the food bank. He stopped after he got a job at a major bookstore as a night-time accountant and head cashier paying just $9 an hour but with good health benefits, and is now getting a human resources consultancy practice off the ground.</p> <p>When Pezzani heard the tape of Romney referring disparagingly to the 47% of the country who don't pay taxes she was unimpressed. \"It's very difficult to see the folks that we're serving maligned in that way,\" she says. Beck-Ferkiss at the HPI has similar reservations. \"It's hard for me to believe that Romney is focused on the population that I serve,\" she says.</p> <p>Mark, however, says <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/jul/18/mitt-romney-turning-into-john-kerry-2012-election\">it just confirmed everything he already thought</a>. \"It doesn't surprise me about Romney because he's always struck me as a stuffed shirt. He's arrogant, and it's hard for me to get past that. It didn't change my mind about him because I always thought that about him. It was exactly the same as Obama saying \"You didn't build that\". Those were exactly the words I would expect to come out of his mouth.\"</p> <p>Michelle, on the other hand, was devastated. \"I was heartbroken,\" she says. \"I was highly offended. I thought he's just disrespected me personally. I just don't think the Republican party cares about people like me.\" Michelle describes herself as a lifelong Democrat. She had not long moved to the Fort Collins area when her husband was diagnosed with brain cancer. They had health insurance, but with only one salary coming in they ate through their savings just to keep afloat. \"We raided our personal accounts to survive.\"</p> <p>She got a job in marketing paying $75,000 a year and remained relatively comfortable in the 2,400 sq ft house she was buying. Then she lost that job and went into consulting. \"I just kept going,\" she says. \"I lived through recessions before, and assumed I'd come out the other side.\" But work was drying up and when her boyfriend of six years killed himself last March she struggled to keep up. \"After that I'd get up to feed my dogs but that was about it.\" When a client complained that she wasn't meeting deadlines she texted back: \"I'm just not trying to kill myself.\"</p> <p>Struggling to pay the mortgage on the house, which had been sold on from her bank to a loan company, she tried to renegotiate. In a conference call with an adviser and the lender, she was told that it made more sense to foreclose on her than change the terms of the loan. \"I stopped paying the mortgage and got the house ready to sell,\" she says. She managed to sell it for a small profit and move into a place less than half the size with her son. It was around this time she found herself crying as she prepared to go to the food bank. \"I just couldn't make ends meet,\" she says. \"I don't go every week. Just when I really need something. When I first went I was worried that I would see people I knew. \"</p> <p>Now she's starting a new career as a journalist and has scaled down considerably and muddles through. \"I have an understanding mechanic,\" she says. \"If something happens to my car and I can't pay him everything he let's me pay what I can.\"</p> <p>She thinks things are getting better, although she wishes they would improve faster. She blames the slow pace on the Republican congress rather than Obama. \"He tried to incorporate some of what they want but ever since he got in all they've wanted to do is get him out.\"</p> <p>The ramifications of the inability of the nation's political culture to engage with this <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/jul/15/democrats-romney-firing-obama\">increasingly pervasive sense of fragility</a> goes beyond the immediate election. Since the financial crisis began five years ago, the significant shift in Americans' economic wellbeing has posed a considerable challenge to both national mythology and the political rhetoric on which it is built.</p> <p>Among other things, the American dream rests on the notion of meritocracy and progress \u2013 that those who work hard will get on, that each year will better than the last and each generation better off than their parents'. Since 1977, when Gallup first asked if people thought they would be personally better off the following year, an overwhelming majority say yes every year, even though there have been four recessions. It's not a guarantee of success \u2013 indeed, quite the opposite. Inequality of wealth, and the poverty that comes with it, is tolerable on the understanding that there will be equality of opportunity. While only 2% described themselves as \"rich\", 31% thought it very likely or somewhat likely they would \"ever be rich\".</p> <p>\"Because differences in income in the US are believed to be related to skill and effort, and because social mobility is assumed to be high,\" <a href=\"http://www.brookings.edu/events/2012/09/20-middle-class-pathways#ref-id=20120920_ES_Sawhill\">argued Isabel Sawhill</a>, co-director of the Centre on Children and Families at the Brookings Institution in September, \"inequality seems to be more acceptable than in Europe\".</p> <p>But the recent downturn has delivered a severe dent to that self-image. <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/12/business/economy/family-net-worth-drops-to-level-of-early-90s-fed-says.html?_r=1\">A report earlier this year</a> showed that between 2007 and 2010 the median American family lost a generation of wealth. <a href=\"http://www.gallup.com/poll/147350/Optimism-Future-Youth-Reaches-Time-Low.aspx\">Most Americans believe it unlikely</a> that young people will have a better life than their parents \u2013 the highest on record.</p> <h2>'I still feel the American dream is available to me'</h2> <p>Meanwhile, as the National Journal's Ron Brownstein made clear recently, the sclerotic effects of class entrenchment are <a href=\"http://www.nationaljournal.com/next-economy/is-american-faith-in-upward-mobility-faltering--20120926\">becoming ever more deeply embedded</a>. In a study called 'Pathways to the middle class', Sawhill and two colleagues pointed out that nearly two-thirds of children born to parents in the bottom fifth of income stay in that category as adults, while more than three-fifths of children born into families in the top fifth remain in theirs.</p> <p>But despite that it seems the belief in the American dream remains steadfast. Eighty-five percent of Americans still believe theirs is the land of opportunity, <a href=\"http://www.allstate.com/heartland-monitor/getting-ahead-h14.aspx\">while other polls over the last four years</a> reveal a sizeable majority of Americans still believe \"the American dream is still possible and achievable for \u2026 people like you\".</p> <p>When Mark reflects on the last few years he falls back on his faith. \"This experience has definitely made me more humble. I think God's made me more authentically who I am.\"</p> <p>Having moved into a smaller home with her teenage son, Michelle now wonders why she surrounded herself with so many things she didn't need. </p> <p>\"When I was working, if I saw something I wanted I would buy it. Now I wonder if I really need it. When I see people in Target getting all these things for Halloween I think: what are you going to do with all that stuff? Where are you going to put it? I still feel the American dream is available to me. I'm not prepared to let that go yet,\" she says. \"But I no longer think it's about being a consumer.\"</p>",

Photograph: screengrab</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: guardian.co.uk</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The item in question was a <a href=\"http://bellejarblog.wordpress.com/2012/10/14/manifest-destiny-or-whoa-gap-inc-what-the-hell/\" title=\"\">cool black number with the words \"MANIFEST DESTINY\"</a> printed on the front. It was designed by Mark McNairy and formed part of the <a href=\"http://www.gap.com/products/gap-x-gq-men-C86036.jsp\" title=\"\">\"Gap x GQ\"</a> line, a <a href=\"http://www.gq.com/style/blogs/the-gq-eye/2012/09/last-night-launching-gq-x-gap-best-new-menswear-designers-in-america-2012-collaboration.html\" title=\"\">collaboration with GQ magazine</a> to showcase the \"best new menswear designers in America\". The only other slogan T-shirt in this line is a rather wan \"LIBERT\u00c9\", presumably drawing on the French revolutionary slogan.</p> <p>The phrase \"manifest destiny\" has a history. It was coined in 1845 by magazine editor <a href=\"https://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/intrel/osulliva.htm\" title=\"\">John L O'Sullivan</a>, first used with <a href=\"http://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/1837859?uid=3737848&amp;uid=2129&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=70&amp;uid=4&amp;sid=21101153343073\" title=\"\">reference to the annexation of Texas</a> and then again referring to negotiations over the boundaries of Oregon. O'Sullivan <a href=\"http://www.anselm.edu/academic/history/hdubrulle/CivWar/text/documents/doc7.htm\" title=\"\">argued</a> that other nations should not prevent \"the fulfilment of our manifest destiny to overspread the continent allotted by Providence for the free development of our yearly multiplying millions\".</p> <p>American history is littered with grandiose statements of a higher purpose for the nation, continuing from <a href=\"http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/645737/John-Winthrop\" title=\"\">John Winthrop</a>'s shining \"<a href=\"https://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/intrel/winthrop.htm\" title=\"\">city upon a hill</a>\", through to Abraham Lincoln's insistence on a nation \"<a href=\"http://avalon.law.yale.edu/19th_century/gettyb.asp\" title=\"\">dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal</a>\". But the ideal of a \"manifest destiny\" differs from these in its focus not on moral responsibilities but on rights to territory: specifically, territory that was recognised to be that of the indigenous peoples of the continent. Rhetorically, its function was identical to Hitler's \"<a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/worldwars/wwtwo/hitler_lebensraum_01.shtml\" title=\"\">Lebensraum</a>\", the racial element being pointed up by the foundation of Oregon with a \"<a href=\"http://www.blackpast.org/?q=perspectives/black-laws-oregon-1844-1857\" title=\"\">whites only</a>\" constitution.</p> <p>As American expansion unfolded, the idea of a destiny for Euro-Americans made manifest by God, in which Native American tribes were seen as inconveniences to be expunged, grew ever more popular. The principle of manifest destiny was used to <a href=\"http://www.u-s-history.com/pages/h1008.html\" title=\"\">justify the forcible acquisition of territory</a>, the <a href=\"http://www1.american.edu/ted/ice/buffalo.htm\" title=\"\">deliberate destruction of food sources</a> and events such as the <a href=\"http://books.google.com.cy/books?id=cGHGPgj1_tIC&amp;pg=PA98&amp;lpg=PA98&amp;dq=%22sand+creek%22+chivington+vaginas&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=OGBVnQ9nnG&amp;sig=dalBjRIZjyDSW5x0Lpabs6gho2w&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ynV8UOrINozU4QSV6YGYAw&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=%22sand%20creek%22%20chivington%20vaginas&amp;f=false\" title=\"\">Sand Creek massacre</a> (before which Colonel Chivington declared \"I \u2026 believe it is right and honourable to use any means under God's heaven to kill Indians\").</p> <p>America has never really come to terms with the contradiction between this bloody origin and its rhetoric of <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/style/longterm/books/chap1/americanexceptionalism.htm\" title=\"\">exceptionalism</a>, and American popular history thus remains dependent on a now largely unarticulated form of manifest destiny logic. That said, it seems astonishing that nobody during the product launch process said \"Hang on \u2026 doesn't this basically mean 'white pride'?\" <a href=\"http://twitpic.com/b4g06p\" title=\"\">Artist Gregg Deal suggests</a> the Gap should now launch \"AMERICAN IMPERIALISM\" or \"FORCED ASSIMILATION\" lines.</p> <p>Though commenters have <a href=\"http://inyourfaceradio.net/gaps-rebirth-manifest-destiny/?action=rpx_token\" title=\"\">assumed</a> that the offence was unintended, designer Mark McNairy certainly seemed aware of the term's meaning. When activists contacted him to ask for the line's removal, he responded on by tweeting \"MANIFEST DESTINY. SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST\" (the tweet has been removed, but a screengrab is archived <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10151197786087436&amp;set=o.14856729724&amp;type=1&amp;theater\" title=\"\">here</a>). This seems to show that he is quite comfortable with a social Darwinist explanation for the destruction of indigenous nations. A <a href=\"http://www.change.org/petitions/gap-discontinue-the-manifest-destiny-tshirt-and-issue-a-formal-apology\" title=\"\">petition</a> calling for his dismissal, the T-shirt's removal and a formal apology from Gap reached over 2,500 supporters (McNairy has since apologised).</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2012/10/15/gap-manifest-destiny-t-shirt-sparks-outrage-in-indian-country-140007\" title=\"\">emotions</a> sparked by this ignorant provocation have to be seen in a wider context of <a href=\"http://nativeappropriations.blogspot.com/\" title=\"\">Indian appropriation</a>, from <a href=\"http://www.apa.org/pi/oema/resources/indian-mascots.aspx\" title=\"\">sports mascots</a>, through <a href=\"http://www.spirithalloween.com/product/pocahottie-pow-wow-costume/\" title=\"\">Halloween costumes</a> to <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/may/18/native-americans-cultural-misappropriation\" title=\"\">hipster headdresses</a>. One only needs to think what the reaction would be to caricatured Chinese mascots, blackface costumes or hipster hijabs to understand just how culturally marginalised Native Americans are. Coll Thrush's <a href=\"http://naisa.org/node/586\" title=\"\">beautifully thoughtful blog entry</a> provides reasons to believe that this is changing, as does the company's decision last night to withdraw the T-shirt under pressure. Gap spokeswoman Edie Kissko states in an email that \"our intention was not to offend anyone\", which falls somewhat short of the apology requested in the petition. But the fact that such an item could go on sale at all speaks volumes about Euro-America's ignorance of its history with the continent's original inhabitants.</p>",

It is followed by jerky footage in which a young man in a blue T-shirt rides in the back of a truck with men in military fatigues, while village dwellings are ablaze and shouts are heard.</p> <p>The SSP said frame-by-frame analysis of the uniforms worn by the various forces in the video shows that at least four of the attackers, including the two camera operators, were from a police unit known as Abu Tira.</p> <p>Two Abu Tira officers, it added, can be heard firing a series of orders and questions to ascertain whether their captive is a rebel: \"Tie him down like a goat\", \"Are you a rebel?\", \"Let me just finish him\", \"No, no, no; keep him alive\".</p> <p>One of the officers can be seen wearing the Abu Tira patch on his shoulder as the interrogation continues: \"Get information from him, then kill him\", \"He doesn't know anything. He's nothing\".</p> <p>The questioning concludes with one interrogator stating: \"With this flame we extinguish the burning sedition in South Kordofan. By God, we will not give away an inch of our land.\" Men can be seen waving rifles in the air.</p> <p>The video includes a follow-up interview with the captive, whom it identifies as Naim Mohammed Hamad Yagoub, an 18-year-old student who claims he was taken away to be interrogated and tortured for 10 days by Sudanese forces.</p> <p>\"They tied me down and took me away,\" he says. \"They threw me in a truck and took me to a cave. That evening, they poured water in our mouths, noses and eyes. And they kept beating us. And then they took us outside. They beat us with rubber hoses and whips made out of used tyres.\"</p> <p>\"While they were beating us they called us 'rebel' and when we told them we're not rebels they beat us and some of them kicked us.\"</p> <p>The SSP said the video of the attack was obtained by the Sudanese news organisation Nuba Reports. Two of its journalists travelled to Gardud al Badry to collect visual evidence and eyewitness reports. They arrived on 1 August, three days after a second wave of attacks and an artillery bombardment.</p> <p>The report offers the first documented visual evidence of Abu Tira participating in, and filming, the systematic razing and looting of a village, the SSP said. It has previously reported that Abu Tira led house-to-house mass killings of Nuban people believed to support the rebel Sudan People's Liberation Movement-North (SPLM-North) in Kadugli, South Kordofan, last year.</p> <p>The SPLM-North has formed an alliance with other rebel groups to try to topple Sudan's veteran president, Omar Hassan al-Bashir, who is wanted by the international criminal court for masterminding war crimes and genocide in Darfur. The UN has estimated that around 300,000 people may have died in the Darfur conflict. Sudan has put the toll around 10,000.</p> <p>The Sudanese government accuses South Sudan, which seceded in July 2011, of fuelling rebellions in South Kordofan and Blue Nile states, charges dismissed by the South's government.</p> <p>Human Rights Watch has also accused Sudan's military of conducting indiscriminate bombings against civilians in the Nuba mountains.</p>",
  "<p>The Scottish independence debate is off and running, and officially too after Alex Salmond and David Cameron <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/oct/15/alex-salmond-scotland-referendum-deal\">signed a deal on Monday</a> giving the Scottish parliament new powers to hold an independence referendum.</p> <p>But is the debate on Nato membership at the upcoming Scottish National party conference later this week an unnecessary fly in the independence ointment or a necessary purging of demons within the nationalist cause?</p> <p>The SNP has opposed Nato emphatically for decades, rejecting its reliance on nuclear weapons. But as it faces the historic chance to win independence, Salmond and his defence spokesman Angus Robertson believe it needs to present <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/mar/01/independent-scotland-could-join-nato\">a more centre-ground stance</a> to a sceptical or undecided Scottish electorate. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.moraysnp.org/p/snp-defence-policy-update.html\">This stance</a>, still radical by comparison with anything south of the border, is to ban nuclear weapons and stay in Nato, with conditions on Scottish involvement in the deployment of international force. This proposed policy change <a href=\"http://notonatoscotland.org.uk/?page_id=264\">has divided the party</a>, including SNP members of the Scottish parliament, but the leadership is confident of winning the vote by about 2:1.</p> <p>The arguments seem to revolve around whether an independent Scotland should remain in the collective embrace of Nato, or refuse to join as the organisation requires its members to support the theory of nuclear deterrence. And there seems to be an assumption that the question of independence is inextricably linked to the question of Nato membership.</p> <p>I would beg to differ on both counts and have laid out my position <a href=\"http://www.natowatch.org/node/784\">in a new report</a> released this week. I believe that an independent Scotland would, by default of leaving the UK, have to apply for membership of Nato. And that decision could still be made after the heat of the independence vote has died down and after full consideration of the potential benefits or detriments of membership.</p> <p>The report, in essence, suggests a positive way forward for the majority of electors who have, thus far, indicated their support for an independent, non-nuclear Scotland \u2013 inside Nato. It also holds out an olive branch to all those nationalists opposed to full Nato membership by suggesting that a final decision on applying to join Nato should be deferred to a separate referendum.</p> <p>There must be a wide-ranging debate about Scotland's role in the world: after all, these islands face no short to medium term military threat. We need a very different approach to understanding security concerns and needs, primarily with non-military outcomes envisaged. </p> <p>From the twin starting points of an independent Scotland and the additional positive momentum engendered by the removal of Trident from Scotland \u2013 which would become a recognised non-nuclear weapon state under the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, much could be achieved \u2013 either inside or outside of Nato.</p> <p>While recognising that there are strongly held opinions on this issue, the debate need not be as contentious as sometime presented. An independent Scotland could both make a positive contribution to a redefined collective security as a member of Nato and, by working with other like-minded countries, challenge Nato's nuclear policy. </p> <p>Perhaps the biggest obstacle to developing a military-lighter Scottish national security strategy is the muddleheaded notion that independent armed forces are at the heart of what it means to be a sovereign country. They are not.</p> <p>Now you could argue that standing your ground until more gather around you to form a majority has got the SNP this far, so why change now?</p> <p>The answer is that the SNP and other supporters of Scottish independence don't have enough time to gather sufficient numbers to change Scottish opinions on Nato membership and by persisting with the 'Scotland out of Nato' line they damage their chances of a clear mandate for independence. Without such a mandate, forcing the rest of the UK (rUK) to remove Trident and all the potential for alternative security thinking remains a distant pipe dream.</p> <p>Most of those opposed to full Nato membership tend to be content with the existing SNP policy of being part of Nato's Partnership for Peace (PfP) programme. This 'half in and half out of Nato' compromise position is certainly a respectable one and a number of other countries are already in the same boat, including Austria, Finland, Ireland and Sweden.</p> <p>Whether it is a credible enough position not to upset the independence apple cart is another matter. Under PfP would the Scottish electorate comprehend what is being offered sufficiently and would Scotland's voice be audible inside Nato conference halls? Probably not, on both counts.</p> <p>Practical politics says play your strong card first - Trident can only be turned out of Scotland if the country becomes independent and, ultimately, Nato policy can only be influenced from within. Just imagine the impact of a strong independence vote (or even strong polls in 2013) on the rUK and within Nato. The alarm bells are already ringing in Westminster and Brussels.</p> <p>Scotland is located in one of the safest and least threatened parts of Europe. Nonetheless, it is a country with an important strategic legacy, an active role in current UK defence affairs and potentially significant future security roles both within and beyond these shores.</p>",
  "<p>Unless you were living under a rock this weekend, you're probably aware that Felix Baumgartner, an Austrian daredevil, jumped out of a balloon 24 miles above the earth.

The Guardian's Leo Hickman <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/shortcuts/2012/oct/15/felix-baumgartner-skydive-key-questions-answered\">tackled a number of questions</a>, including: what was the biggest danger that Baumgartner faced?</p> <blockquote> <p>His team identified 16 key risks that had to all be overcome for the record attempt to succeed. They included ultraviolet radiation, wind shear, landing impact, extreme temperatures, hypoxia (oxygen starvation), decompression sickness, entering a flat spin during the descent, \"shock-shock interaction\" (an explosive effect when shock waves in the air collide when passing through the sound barrier) and fire aboard the capsule. But the team said two dangers hung over Baumgartner above all others \u2013 a \"breach\" in the suit or capsule, and the accidental deployment of a parachute.</p> </blockquote> <p>And how did they know where he would fall?</p> <blockquote> <p>Given that he reached a height of 24 miles above the surface of the Earth, it seems remarkable that he was able to land with such accuracy back on the desert floor in New Mexico. His team later confirmed that his landing site was just 23 miles from where the balloon had taken off several hours earlier. Unlike an astronaut, Baumgartner remained within the Earth's atmosphere so never experienced the planet rotating underneath him as witnessed by anyone actually in orbit. His team waited for the perfect weather conditions when high-altitude winds that might have caused his balloon to drift were at a minimum. Once he exited his free-fall by deploying his parachute, Baumgartner was able to \"steer\" himself to a preferred landing spot. A beacon inside his suit meant his recovery helicopter was able to closely follow him.</p> </blockquote> <h2>Red Bull takes sponsorship to new heights </h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397824728\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2012/10/15/1350303839057/Felix-Baumgartners-balloo-010.jpg\" alt=\"Felix Baumgartner's balloon and capsule, back on earth after the jump.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Felix Baumgartner's balloon and capsule, back on earth after the jump.

Sure, it was an impressive achievement for Baumgartner and his team, but what about Red Bull? The energy drink manufacturer has set a new high bar for publicity stunts, according to the Guardian's <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/blog/2012/oct/15/red-bull-felix-baumgartner-sponsorship?intcmp=239\">Owen Gibson</a>.</p> <blockquote> <p>Sponsorship experts said on Monday that the online frenzy around Baumgartner's leap served to highlight trends that had been emerging for some time, as sponsors moved away from traditional models and towards their own bespoke spectaculars.</p> <p>\"The biggest trend in the last 10 years, and the social internet side of things has merely accelerated it, is that creating your own content has absolutely moved to the top of the agenda. The hackneyed old tickets, hospitality and perimeter boarding model is being left behind,\" said Tim Crow, chief executive of the sponsorship agency Synergy.</p> <p>Major brands have been talking for years about becoming content producers rather than simply paying media and rights owners to advertise or slap their logos on shirts and hoardings. But none have taken it as seriously as Red Bull.</p> <p>Red Bull were an early pioneer, trading in their sponsorship of a Formula One team to buy their own in 2004, for example. A couple of years later they bought the Major League Soccer team that was renamed New York Red Bulls. But most of their investment has been in extreme sport and in building up long-term links with individual athletes \u2013 funding an army of base jumpers, free runners, snowboarders, cliff divers and BMX riders for whom they could create bespoke events and completely control the content around.</p> </blockquote> <h2>Watch the entire jump</h2>      <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-397743686\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2012/10/15/1350288211444/Felix-Baumgartner-011.jpg\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/brightcove/2012/10/15/121015SkydivePress-16x9.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/ad/121015SkydivePress/121015SkydivePress.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2012/10/15/121015SkydivePress_3gpSml16x9.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/connectedTV/1280/2012/10/15/121015SkydivePress-720.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2012/10/15/121015SkydivePress_3gpLg16x9.3gp\"/> </video>",
  "<p>If you were a gamer in the 1980s, you knew Lords of Midnight. Released in 1984, first on the Spectrum and later on the Commodore 64, it was an absolutely singular adventure, a vast epic quest to destroy the evil witchking Doomdark and restore the land of Midnight to peace.</p> <p>Its designer, Mike Singleton, who died last week after having cancer, was already a veteran coder when he envisaged this role-playing fantasy classic. Originally a teacher, he started messing about on early computers such as the Commodore Pet and ZX80, discovering a talent for nippy arcade conversions, adeptly working within the ridiculous confines of these early systems. But in 1983, he approached Beyond Software with his idea for an ambitious adventure, allowing the player to control four separate characters as they traversed a desolate landscape, slaying dragons and taking on Doomdark's armies.</p> <p>The Spectrum was not capable of rendering an entire world to Singleton's vision, so he invented his own system named \"landscaping\". This involved drawing 32,000 images of the landscape, providing a view for everywhere players could look as they navigated the world, inputting simple navigational commands.</p> <p>And this considerable programming challenge was not the game's only claim to history. It was also one of the earliest titles to feature a day/night cycle, to allow control over more than one character and to successfully combine strategy and RPG elements. The protagonists could beat Doomdark in two ways; by stealthily destroying his ice crown or by defeating his armies. The former was a standard fantasy quest, the latter a military simulation. All this within thousands of times less processing power than a mobile phone.</p> <p>I was obsessed with this game. As a kid with a Commodore 64 in the early 80s, I had played countless blocky arcade game conversions by the time Lords of Midnight arrived, and I was immediately hooked by its comparative depth and ambition. The stark, stately landscapes were enormously atmospheric and somehow the loosely sketched lead characters \u2013 Luxor the Moonprince, Corleth the Fey, Rorthron the Wise and Morkin \u2013 had real stature and resonance.</p> <p>There was such a sense of literature about the whole thing. Brilliantly, your moves during the day were collated into a text commentary during the night cycle, which would detail the battles taking place throughout the realm. \"Night has fallen and the foul are abroad!\" read the text as the computer took its turn to manoeuvre Doomdark's troops against you. Such drama, such tension, and in the morning I would discover which of my armies had fallen and who had survived to wander further into the icy nothingness, searching for allies.</p> <p>The packaging, too, was beautiful. Lords of Midnight came with a lavish map and a novella written by Singleton, providing the backstory to the game. It all added to the experience and the immersive magic of the adventure. Lords of Midnight, like many fantasy titles of the time, operated somewhere between reading and gaming. It provided so much, but asked some more from the imaginative participant. Unlike today's role-playing adventures which effectively molly-coddle or batter us into a state of amazed supplication, Lords of Midnight and its sequels Doomdark's Revenge and The Citadel, required the gamer to become part of the fiction, an active interpreter, a student of the lore.</p> <p>I have also never forgotten the cruelly capricious nature of this world. The way that my mighty warriors could fight off a whole army, only to be attacked and slayed by wolves if they wandered into the wrong rocky pass. It could feel horrendously unfair, but it worked, because Singleton set out to create an uncaring world, a cruel slate, every bit as majestic and unyielding as Middle Earth or <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2012/may/10/game-of-thrones-are-you-watching\" title=\"\">Westeros</a>. It was Lords of Midnight that sent me, an unwilling schoolboy reader, to Tolkien and Ursula K Le Guin. Nobody gives video games much credit for literary stimulation, but it happens, and I think it started here.</p> <p>This story doesn't end with Midnight. Singleton went on to code games until the current era. He made the brilliantly tense post-apocalyptic adventure Midwinter, as well as jobbing on games by LucasArts and Codemasters. But he ended his career on a nostalgic note, working on an iOS port of Lords of Midnight with longtime fan Christopher Jon Wild, who has written <a href=\"http://www.icemark.com/blog/archives/2012/10/16/night-has-fallen/\" title=\"\">movingly about his relationship with Singleton on his blog</a>. The iPhone version remains unfinished and Wild is not sure now that he is up to the task.</p> <p>As a gamer of more than 30 years, there are few games I remember actually unpacking and poring over \u2013 in the same way that music fans would scour the record sleeves of new releases. Lords of Midnight is one example. I had the map on my wall, I had a notebook, in which I scribbled my tactics and discoveries; it was where I also noted my trading missions in Elite \u2013 another game that relied on the collaborative imagination of coder and gamer.</p> <p>Singleton was an archetypal games coder of the 8bit generation. He had a vision of the epic adventures he wanted to create and he refused to be limited by the hardware on offer. Instead, he constructed his own idiosyncratic systems to conjure a craggy desolate realm from nothing. The video game industry is so young, we have not had to face losing too many of our heroes. But that is what has happened this week.</p>",
  "<p>Frankie Boyle has mounted a defence of some of his most provocative jokes, telling a high court jury his Channel 4 Tramadol Nights show was intended as \"ridiculous, over the top nihilism\".</p> <p>The Scottish comedian defended a series of Tramadol Nights sketches \u2013 including jokes about Muslim women in burkhas and his comments about Olympian Rebecca Adlington's looks \u2013 at the second day of his libel action against the publisher of the Daily Mirror on Tuesday.</p> <p>Boyle told the court that his jokes about immigration were intended as a parody of \"racism at the heart of British policy\".</p> <p>He said: \"I don't think British people are racist. I think it is a top down thing. I think you have a lot of rich and Conservative people who control our country who are racist and their views trickle down through things like tabloid papers.

He also claims he was defamed by the article because it stated that he was \"forced to quit\" the BBC show Mock the Week after a joke about Adlington.</p> <p>Asked about his use of the word \"nigger\" in an episode of Tramadol Nights, Boyle said: \"Context is everything. If you use this at a dinner party to insult someone that would be a terrible hate crime. It's not a word I would use lightly.\"</p> <p>He went on to tell the court how he had written more than 100 anti-war jokes and that far-right policies on immigration are \"the opposite of my views\".</p> <p>He added: \"I think one of the things about comedy is its easy to read stories in the papers and think it's a terrible thing for someone to have said but when you see it in the context of the show it can be more easily explained.\"</p> <p>Boyle later told how he was \"completely disgusted\" at being labelled a racist comedian. He said: \"I was just absolutely shocked by it. It just went against everything I've tried to do in my life and against everything I've tried to do in my work. I was completely taken aback by it, completely disgusted.\"</p> <p>The court heard how Boyle was confronted by an Asian man about the racist claim while out with his girlfriend and children in Glasgow.</p> <p>In one sober passage of evidence, Boyle accused Tony Blair of being a \"war criminal\" for his support for the war in Iraq, and described how he had been shocked to read Noam Chomsky's essays on Britain's imperial past.</p> <p>He later went on to show remorse for his infamous joke about Adlington on BBC2 show Mock the Week in 2008.</p> <p>The comedian left the show in 2009 and has repeatedly denied he was sacked because of the joke.</p> <p>He told the court jury: \"There was no malice in the jokes [about Adlington] in particular. I was really surprised by the Rebecca Adlington thing.\"</p> <p>Boyle said he had asked Mock the Week producers not to include a segment on the Oympics before the show was recorded, because be wanted to cover more serious topics.</p> <p>He added: \"I had no idea Rebecca Adlington was as famous as she was or that she had been a huge success.\"</p> <p>Asked by his counsel, David Sherborne, whether he was forced to quit Mock the Week over the gag, Boyle said: \"Absolutely not. The idea you would be forced to quit the show for saying someone looks like they are looking in the back of a spoon, it just seems ridiculous because they just don't sack people on those panel shows.\"</p> <p>Boyle will be cross examined by Ronald Thwaites QC, for Mirror Group Newspapers, on Wednesday.</p> <p>The trial before Mr Justice Eady continues.</p> <p><em>\u2022 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.

  "<p>Whether it's scandals over unsporting behaviour at the Olympics, or recent UK Border Agency decisions about foreign students, the cry \"It's not fair!\" seems to have been heard a lot .</p> <p>The problem seems to be one of balancing different notions of fairness and justice. All too often, those who suffer from a decision feel that the outcome is unfair, while those who have to make the decision feel that they are under an obligation to dispense justice impartially. Given the news value of these problems, it seemed worth looking at how the Guardian Weekly has reported on things fair and unfair over the last decade.</p> <p>In terms of simple numbers, the word <em>fair</em> (3,579 instances) occurs far more frequently than <em>unfair</em> (890). While you might think that this is because <em>fair</em> has a wider range of meanings (as in <em>fair weather</em> or <em>fair maiden</em>) it does not look as if this is the case in this newspaper, as it most frequently collocates with words such as <em>trade, trial, share, elections, play, election, minded, hearing, game, deal</em> and <em>price.</em> It is also found in the idioms <em>fair amount</em> and <em>fair enough</em>.</p> <p><em>Unfair</em> also occurs with: <em>trade, advantage, competition, trial, election</em> and <em>terms</em>, but is also found with <em>dismissal, discrimination, treatment</em> and <em>burden</em>. So while in both cases there is a clear focus on commercial and legal matters, <em>unfair</em> also gives an insight into the different kinds of unfairness.</p> <p>Looking at these social judgments from another perspective, we see that <em>legal</em> (7,368) and<em> illegal</em> (4,649) both occur more often than <em>fair</em>, and have very different collocates. <em>Legal</em> itself goes with <em>action, system, aid, challenge, battle, advice, experts, status, proceedings, rights</em> and <em>team</em> \u2013 a strong emphasis on the system of the law itself. <em>Illegal</em>, however occurs most frequently with a range of social issues that have high news value: <em>immigrants, immigration, migrants, drugs, logging, immigrant, trade, workers, drug, occupation, activities, settlements</em> and <em>war</em>: all contexts in which claims of <em>unfairness</em> might arise.</p> <p>It seems that issues of fairness are difficult things to report. If reporters lean one way they will be accused of taking sides with the powerless; if they lean the other they're lackeys for those in power.

Maintaining an eco-lodge and ensuring the community of 422 indigenous people have a decent school, jobs and university opportunities for their children would cost a fraction of the money sought by the ITT Initiative.

Only five films so far this year had taken more after two weekends of play: <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/141046/dark-knight-rises\" title=\"\">The Dark Knight Rises</a> (\u00a330.55m), <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/144027/avengers\" title=\"\">Avengers Assemble</a> (\u00a329.85m), <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/140156/spider-man-reboot\" title=\"\">The Amazing Spider-Man</a> (\u00a318.85m), <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/148370/ted\" title=\"\">Ted</a> (\u00a317.21m) and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/145506/prometheus\" title=\"\">Prometheus</a> (\u00a315.47m). <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/148325/ice-age-4\" title=\"\">Ice Age 4: Continental Drift</a> was released in a staggered fashion, and after two weekends of full national release had reached \u00a317.66m. The original <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/125815/taken\" title=\"\">Taken</a> movie grossed \u00a36.39m over its entire run in 2008, and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/filmblog/2012/oct/09/uk-box-office-taken-2\" title=\"\">Taken 2 is clearly headed for a total at least triple that sum</a>.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/filmblog/2012/oct/15/argo-taken-2-box-office\" title=\"\">In the US</a>, the sequel has grossed $86m (\u00a353m) so far. Based on that figure, going by rule of thumb, you'd expect a UK total in the \u00a38-9m range, so it's clearly overperforming in this country.</p> <p>Likewise benefiting from a lack of fresh competition, horror film <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/149042/sinister\" title=\"\">Sinister</a> has posted a sensational hold, with a drop of just 12% from the previous weekend. After 10 days, the Ethan Hawke movie has grossed \u00a33.70m, following a very similar trajectory to 2011's <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/141338/insidious\" title=\"\">Insidious</a>, from the same distributor and producer, which opened on exactly the same number (\u00a31.44m) and then fell just 9% for a 10-day cume of \u00a33.87m.</p> <h2>The family battle</h2> <p>Although not officially released until this Friday, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/147830/madagascar-3\" title=\"\">Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted</a> enjoyed extensive previews on Saturday and Sunday, and was the top family film in the market. These takings, rumoured to be around \u00a32m, will be added in to the film's official tally next weekend. Despite this competition from the DreamWorks Animation hit, Sony's own <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/149648/hotel-transylvania\" title=\"\">Hotel Transylvania</a> debuted with a decent \u00a31.73m. Tim Burton's <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/149787/frankenweenie\" title=\"\">Frankenweenie</a> played at 24 Imax cinemas only, ahead of its full national release on Wednesday. The arrival of all these animated features saw Universal/Laika's <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/148980/paranorman\" title=\"\">ParaNorman</a> plunge by 73%, the biggest drop among films in the top 10.</p> <h2>The disappointments</h2> <p>There's been talk of an <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/142861/on-the-road\" title=\"\">On the Road</a> movie ever since its 1957 publication; Francis Ford Coppola optioned the film rights in 1979, and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/walter-salles\" title=\"\">Walter Salles</a> has been on board to direct since 2004. Anticipation has been high since production began in August 2010, and the film received a <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2012/may/23/on-the-road-review\" title=\"\">high-profile world premiere in Cannes</a> in May earlier this year, with cast members Garrett Hedlund, Sam Riley, Kristen Stewart, Kirsten Dunst, Viggo Mortensen, Tom Sturridge and Danny Morgan in attendance. For all these reasons, On the Road's debut of \u00a3219,000 from 100 sites, including \u00a346,300 in previews, seems fairly lacklustre. And considering the film took a whopping \u00a313,361 from London's Curzon Soho over the three-day weekend, compared to a site average of \u00a31,724 over the same period, it's clear that it enjoyed very mixed fortunes across the country.</p> <p>Still, On the Road is a poster child for box-office achievement next to <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/149509/ruby-sparks\" title=\"\">Ruby Sparks</a>, from <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/114024/little.miss.sunshine\" title=\"\">Little Miss Sunshine</a> directors <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2012/sep/27/perfect-couple-for-ruby-sparks\" title=\"\">Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris</a>. With just \u00a3299,000 from 308 sites, including \u00a311,800 in previews \u2013 delivering a per-theatre average of just \u00a3972 \u2013 this is another case of a film being released unsustainably wide. Little Miss Sunshine was released in September 2006 on just 114 screens (grossing \u00a3350,000), and expanded steadily over the next couple of weeks to 173 venues. After five weeks in the top 10, the sleeper hit had grossed a decent \u00a32.57m.</p> <p>Landing in disappointing 17th place, the English-language remake of Nicolas Winding Refn's Danish thriller <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/147989/pusher\" title=\"\">Pusher</a> grossed a feeble \u00a349,300 from 122 sites, including \u00a315,100 in previews. Even if you generously add the preview takings in, that's a site average of just \u00a3404. Similarly undistinguished is Dax Shepard's road comedy <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/92010/hit-and-run\" title=\"\">Hit &amp; Run</a>, with \u00a328,900 from 54 screens, and a \u00a3535 average. Both titles will struggle to hold on to their play dates this coming weekend, and will hope for better when they arrive on their natural home, DVD.</p> <h2>The live event</h2> <p>Not included in the official reporting, but rumoured to have grossed at least \u00a3170,000, is the satellite relay of the <a href=\"http://www.metoperafamily.org/metopera/liveinhd/LiveinHD.aspx\" title=\"\">New York Met Opera's production of Donizetti's L'Elisir D'Amore</a>. Kicking off the seventh season of The Met: Live in HD, the result once again confirms that audiences nationwide are willing to pay premium prices for this kind of high-end content in cinemas. The lunchtime slot in New York works perfectly for evening UK presentation, with the five-hour time difference. Verdi's Otello is next, on 27 October.</p> <p>The event created a competitive environment for all arthouse films on Saturday, but German drama <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/149279/barbara\" title=\"\">Barbara</a> once again posted a solid hold, down just 8%, and the film will expand into new screens from Friday.</p> <h2>The future</h2> <p>Thanks to those \u00a32m in Madagascar 3 previews not being included in official tallies, overall the market is 8% down on the equivalent weekend from 2011, when <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/141426/johnny-english-reborn\" title=\"\">Johnny English Reborn</a> held on at the top spot and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/143595/three-musketeers\" title=\"\">The Three Musketeers</a> and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/143302/real-steel\" title=\"\">Real Steel</a> were the top new releases. Had the Madagascar 3 previews been reported, the market would in fact be up on 2011 for the weekend. Although most schools don't break up for half-term until 26 October, cinemas are gearing into action, with Frankenweenie's expansion on Wednesday, and the official release of Madagascar 3 on Friday. Adults and teens will also have the option of Paranormal Activity 4, which arrives Wednesday and should then enjoy a good run through to Halloween. Top arthouse offering is likely to be Sundance and Cannes award winner <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/145827/beasts-of-the-southern-wild\" title=\"\">Beasts of the Southern Wild</a>.</p> <h2>Top 10 films</h2> <p><strong>1.</strong> Taken 2, \u00a33,743,046 from 510 sites. <strong>Total:</strong> \u00a314,495,284<br><strong>2.</strong> Hotel Transylvania, \u00a31,734,231 from 471 sites <strong>(New)</strong><br><strong>3.</strong> Sinister, \u00a31,259,405 from 378 sites. <strong>Total:</strong> \u00a33,698,363<br><strong>4.</strong> Looper, \u00a31,175,220 from 453 sites. <strong>Total:</strong> \u00a37,566,485<br><strong>5.</strong> <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/147832/perks-of-being-a-wallflower\" title=\"\">The Perks of Being a Wallflower</a>, \u00a3397,869 from 335 sites. <strong>Total:</strong> \u00a31,546,290<br><strong>6.</strong> Ruby Sparks, \u00a3299,382 from 308 sites <strong>(New)</strong><br><strong>7.</strong> On the Road, \u00a3218,738 from 100 sites <strong>(New)</strong><br><strong>8.</strong> ParaNorman, \u00a3212,810 from 439 sites. <strong>Total:</strong> \u00a35,617,162<br><strong>9.</strong> <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/148981/campaign\" title=\"\">The Campaign</a>, \u00a3170,286 from 266 sites. <strong>Total:</strong> \u00a32,108,212<br><strong>10.</strong> <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/149158/untouchable\" title=\"\">Untouchable</a>, \u00a3144,432 from 107 sites. <strong>Total:</strong> \u00a31,301,345</p> <h2>Other openers</h2> <p>Maattrraan, 20 sites, \u00a381,253<br>Pusher, 122 sites, \u00a334,240 (+ \u00a315,106 previews)<br>Hit &amp; Run, 54 sites, \u00a328,898<br>Aiyyaa, 16 sites, \u00a319,628<br>Bhoot Returns, 18 sites, \u00a310,278<br>Husbands in Goa: Celebration Without Wives, 1 site, \u00a3600 (+ \u00a3925 previews)<br><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/149790/private-peaceful\" title=\"\">Private Peaceful</a>, 2 sites, \u00a3491</p>",
  "<p>The new generation of secret courts that the government is proposing could hear cases based upon historic allegations from Britain's colonial past, officials have confirmed.</p> <p>With <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/05/maumau-court-colonial-compensation-torture\" title=\"\">the high court ruling that three veterans of Kenya's Mau Mau rebellion can sue</a> the British government over the abuses suffered more than 50 years ago, large numbers of similar cases are anticipated by government lawyers.</p> <p>Thousands more in Kenya are thought to be considering claims, while in Cyprus, veterans of the Eoka insurgency who were imprisoned and allegedly tortured by British forces in the 1950s are also <a href=\"http://www.cyprus-mail.com/cyprus/kenya-ruling-opens-way-eoka/20121007\" title=\"\">reported to be planning legal action</a> against the British government.</p> <p>Both the Cabinet Office and the Ministry of Justice say the controversial closed material procedures (CMPs) that lie at the heart of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/law/2012/sep/25/secret-courts-the-essential-guide\" title=\"\">justice and security bill</a> could be employed to prevent public disclosure of evidence that was deemed to be potentially damaging to national security or the national interest.</p> <p>A Cabinet Office spokesman said: \"If sensitive national security evidence is relevant then a test for CMP would be applied.\"</p> <p>A Ministry of Justice spokeswoman said: \"The intention is that the proposals would extend to all civil litigation cases where release of pertinent information would be damaging to the national interest.\"</p> <p>The Cabinet Office pointed out that no attempt had been made to withhold evidence in the Mau Mau case on national security grounds. However, most of the documentary evidence in that case remained hidden until historians working for the claimants' lawyers discovered the existence of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/apr/18/sins-colonialists-concealed-secret-archive\" title=\"\">a secret archive of colonial-era files</a> that the Foreign Office had stored in a <a href=\"http://www.hmgcc.gov.uk/about-us.aspx\" title=\"\">high-security government communications centre</a> at Hanslope Park, 55 miles north of London.</p> <p>The Mau Mau veterans' lawyer, Martyn Day, said: \"The British government has been responsible for numerous outrages over the last five to six decades. The British courts have determined in the Mau Mau case that it is right and just for our government to be held to account for those actions. Any attempt to try and use some tricky manoeuvre to escape justice would be seen by the world for the despicable act it would be.\"</p> <p>On Monday, Amnesty International <a href=\"http://www.amnesty.org/en/library/asset/EUR45/014/2012/en/546a2059-db83-4888-93ba-8b90cc32a2de/eur450142012en.pdf\" title=\"\">published a heavily-critical report</a> about the bill's proposals. The organisation condemned the bill as Kafkaesque and feared it would enable governments to \"simply play the 'national security' card whenever it wants to keep things secret\".</p> <p>While the government stresses that CMPs will be used only to protect national security, there is some evidence to suggest that the UK's intelligence and security agencies regard the disclosure of information that damages their own reputations as a potential threat to national security.

The evidence can be seen by security-vetted barristers known as special advocates, but they cannot discuss what they have seen with the claimants, with the result that <a href=\"http://ukhumanrightsblog.com/2012/06/14/government-still-not-made-case-for-inherently-unfair-secret-trials-say-special-advocates/\" title=\"\">most regard the system as inherently unfair</a>.</p> <p>Some human rights activists go further, saying the government is attempting to codify a cover-up of recent crimes or misdeeds, and <a href=\"http://www.reprieve.org.uk/investigations/secret_justice/\" title=\"\">attempting to ensure that UK complicity in torture and rendition</a> will in future be concealed.</p> <p>No date has been set for the bill's next stage in the House of Lords, when peers will vote on the controversial measures.

  "<h2>Location</h2> <p>Appropriately for a cinema that trades on its heritage, the Astor Theatre sits on the corner of Dandenong Road and Chapel Street in St Kilda, on the last of Melbourne's tram routes to still employ the city's green \"rattler\" trams.</p> <h2><strong>The building</strong></h2> <p>A single-screen cinema with a two-tiered auditorium, the Astor has been left relatively untouched since it opened in 1936, and has never been anything other than a cinema since that time.</p> <p>Externally, the Astor isn't much to look at. Though it is one of Melbourne's art deco buildings, it is also a solid brick structure with few obvious aesthetic qualities. Inside, however, is another matter. It's like walking on to the set of a Poirot episode: an expansive curved foyer with a terrazzo floor is overlooked by a huge oval-shaped balcony cut into the ceiling. The balcony and the seats in the circle (the stalls are only used for the most popular events) are accessed by a wide staircase that wouldn't have looked out of place on the Lusitania.</p> <p>Tickets are sold out of a small, glassed booth, liberally decorated with film posters. Dotted throughout the foyer and first floor are antique projection equipment and radios, cinematic memorabilia and comfy sofas, giving the place an almost museum-like quality.</p> <p>The cinema was one of the last to be built in Australia with stalls and a dress circle both, though only the upstairs circle is usually used now. The cinema itself is vast, with the circle positioned high above the stalls. Upon taking your seat, you realise that unlike most modern cinemas, you actually look down on to the screen rather than up. This can feel a bit unusual at first, although that passes once the film gets underway.</p> <h2><strong>The clientele</strong></h2> <p>Regardless of the film that is showing, there will always be hipsters chaining up their single-speed bikes outside, but the audience is not restricted to those in skinny jeans. Elderly couples reliving their younger days with a night in the cinema's evocative surroundings, fanboys wanting to see one of their favourites back on the big screen, couples on dates, families, children's parties (when an appropriate film is screening) \u2013 the Astor attracts all sorts.</p> <h2><strong>The programme</strong></h2> <p>The Astor publishes a popular quarterly calendar in poster form, listing all films scheduled for the next four months. These can be picked up from most nearby cafes and shops, as well as from the cinema itself, and find their way on to the walls and doors of many local residences.</p> <p>Each calendar reveals the same style of programming for each quarter: a mix of new and old, some classics and some not-so classics. Popular draws are the double bills \u2013 usually, two films that would appeal to a similar audience, one of which may be a current release not long out of the multiplexes, providing great value for money. Other films are scattered throughout the schedule: B-movie nights (often with commentary by a couple of local film-loving comedians); retrospectives of individual directors running on the same day of concurrent weeks; genre-specific themed nights; special events such as marathon screenings of trilogies, or singalong nights for musicals; weeklong nightly screenings of a restored classic; and the occasional special guest appearance \u2013 one of the original Von Trapps introduced The Sound of Music, while George Lazenby came by to present On Her Majesty's Secret Service.</p> <h2><strong>Further comments</strong></h2> <p>In a city probably better served than most by independent cinemas, the Astor is regarded as a treasured heirloom, and not just for its film selection and architecture. The price of admission is reasonable, which is a big deal in a country with incredibly expensive cinema tickets. No other cinema I know of has a resident cat: Marzipan, who patrols the theatre while the films are on, terrifying anyone who catches sight of her out of the corner of an eye while watching a horror. She also usually finds a perch on one of the many foyer sofas during the interval so as to maximise the amount of attention she gets. </p> <p>Alongside the usual cinematic fare, the concession stand also sells homemade cakes, adding to the quaint vibe and appeal in a way that a multiplex couldn't hope to emulate. And while most (if not all) Australian cinemas sell choc-tops, the peculiar antipodean chocolate-covered ice-cream cone that is possibly the least practical thing to eat in a darkened cinema, the Astor staff make their own version, usually while the films are screening \u2013 and you can taste the results.</p> <p>The Astor recently faced threat of closure as the building's then owners, a nearby private school, did not agree to extend the lease beyond 2015. It was suggested that the school wished to use the cinema solely for their own productions and the lobby as a uniform shop. This was met with a great deal of local resistance, and support for the Astor in the media and from the public was manifold. Happily, the Astor was saved when a local cinema-loving businessman's bid to buy the property was accepted by the school. The new owner and the cinema's management have arranged for the Astor to continue in its present form, preserving for future generations this wonderful place to watch a film.</p>",
  "<p>More than 70 million people have been forced to leave their homes because of conflict, political upheaval and disasters, as well as by climate change and development projects, and are now living as migrants, the International Red Cross said on Tuesday.</p> <p>The World Disasters Report 2012 said most forced migrants are displaced for the long term or are permanently dispossessed, requiring governments and humanitarian agencies to adopt more flexible approaches to migration and integration. The cost to the international community of forced migration is at least $8bn (\u00a34.9bn) a year, according to the report.</p> <p>\"The nature of forced displacement is much more unpredictable than in the past and much more complex,\" said Professor Roger Zetter, the report's editor. \"The headline figure of 70 million \u2013 one in every 100 people \u2013 is significant in itself. It refers not just to people displaced by general conflict but to those displaced by disaster and by development itself \u2013 the hidden losers of resettlement projects and increasingly of land grabs.\"</p> <p>The report highlights how forced migration has become increasingly \"urbanised\" as cities and urban areas become the main destinations for refugees, internally displaced people (IDPs), and those affected by disasters and conflicts. That marks a change from the 1980s and 1990s, when displacement was synonymous with camps. Now, about half of the world's estimated 10.5 million refugees and at least 13 million IDPs are thought to live in urban areas.</p> <p>\"The mere mention of the term 'refugees' invokes images of tents and camps in most people's minds, but our new report may get us to think differently as we have noted marked movements of refugees into cities. This is not a new trend, but it is one that is increasing,\" said Barry Armstrong, British Red Cross disaster response manager. \"The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/03/syrians-refugee-camp-wretched-conditions\" title=\"\">situation in Syria and surrounding countries</a> is a case in point, but there are many other places where people have left home to escape violence.\"</p> <p>In the past decade, cities and towns in Iraq, Sudan, Somalia, Kenya, Yemen and Haiti have absorbed large numbers of people fleeing conflict or disaster. In Sudan, the 40-year civil war that culminated in the declaration of South Sudan's independence last year contributed to massive urbanisation \u2013 despite the absence of industry and commerce.</p> <p>Kabul, the capital of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/feb/23/afghan-refugees-amnesty-report\" title=\"\">Afghanistan</a>, grew from about 1 million inhabitants in 2001 to 4.5 million in 2010. The increase was driven partly by returning refugees, but also by IDPs fleeing insecurity in the countryside because of the Taliban insurgency. Displaced people flee not just to capitals and megacities but to secondary cities, such as Santa Marta in Colombia, which has the world's largest IDP population after nearly 50 years of conflict. Forced displacement has affected 3.9 million people, or 8.4% of the population in Colombia.</p> <p>The report said humanitarian agencies have tried to adapt to the urbanisation of forced migration by expanding their mandate or approach beyond camps. \"Many of the approaches and tools developed for camp situations are, however, ill-suited to provide effective relief or to identify correctly the cause of vulnerability in urban areas,\" it said.</p> <p>A key challenge for humanitarian agencies in urban areas is the number of organisations they have to deal with, from community-based groups, local councils and national authorities, to local power-brokers in the slums, as well as international development bodies.</p> <p>\"Perhaps the most crucial partners in the urban areas are the government authorities themselves,\" said the report. \"Without their support, there can be little progress \u2013 and little sustainability \u2013 to programmes.\"</p> <p>The priorities in urban areas are housing, land and property, violence, legal aid and livelihoods. Integrating forcibly displaced people into the local economy is vital and, although there are successful examples, such as <a href=\"http://www.royalafricansociety.org/country-profiles/710.html\" title=\"\">Eastleigh, a suburb of Nairobi, which is home to many Somali businesses</a>, such cases are rare. In many cities, the lack of reliable livelihoods has driven people into acute poverty or made it impossible for them to overcome it.</p> <p>The report expresses concern over the \"hidden losers\", people forced to move because of infrastructure projects. It estimates that 15 million people are displaced each year by projects such as the construction of dams or urban renewal schemes that often involve clearing out a poor neighbourhood. The Metro Manila railway project in the Philippines has led to the eviction and resettlement of about 35,000 families. But a relocation programme implemented by the national housing authority has failed to prevent their impoverishment, noted Zetter.</p> <p>A concern for humanitarian groups is how to deal with long-term refugees or displaced people who are unlikely to return home \u2013 more than 20 million refugees are trapped in protracted exile. The report calls on governments to relax restrictions on the economic activities of refugees and help migrant and host populations to integrate quickly.</p> <p>States could grant permanent residency to refugees who own businesses, hold academic qualifications or can fill job shortages. Although such a piecemeal approach makes some humanitarian groups uneasy, the alternative \u2013 no solution \u2013 is worse.</p> <p>The report calls on humanitarian agencies to work more closely with governments \u2013 which are increasingly leading their own humanitarian operations \u2013 and to engage better with affected communities. It notes that improving responses to forced migration is made more urgent by climate change, which is expected to lead to more slow-onset disasters and indirectly to the movement of large numbers of people.</p> <p>\"The international system is gradually recalibrating itself for increasingly complex situations,\" said Zetter. \"The UNHCR [UN Agency for Refugees] and IOM [International Organisation of Migration] worked well together in getting migrant workers out of Libya, for example, but clearly it is a major challenge preparing for situations with new characteristics.\"</p>",

She moved to Mauritius to become Head Chef at Le Gavroche Tropiques before returning to the UK for the birth of her daughter, and she's now back at Le Gavroche working alongside her husband David, the restaurant's head sommelier.</p> <p>Her first cookbook, subtitled Simple Home Cooking, features influences from her childhood and early life in Samoa, her training as a chef in New Zealand, and other flavours and ideas inspired in part through travelling in Europe and Asia. They range from simple, quick suppers that can be put together after a day's work such as this <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/2012/oct/15/mediterranean-puff-tart-recipe\">Mediterranean puff tart</a>, to intensely flavoursome, hearty dishes such as this <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/2012/oct/15/roast-venison-with-chocolate-sauce-recipe\">roast venison with chocolate sauce and glazed chestnuts</a> which works equally well served up with cheffy flourishes or just in great dollops of homely pride. Also making an appearance in the book is this <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/2012/oct/15/pacific-island-style-cured-fish-recipe\">Pacific island style cured fish recipe</a>, a reminder that South American ceviche isn't the only way to cure spankingly fresh fish.</p> <p>There's a useful section on basics such as stocks and ice-creams, and another with some lighthearted, novel ideas: sweetcorn soup with popcorn or chocolate-coated honeycomb toffee lollipops, anyone? Overall, Monica's approach to cooking in this collection of recipes is relaxed and fun, with high-end restaurant fare rubbing shoulders companionably with quick, tasty dishes. Not perhaps the attitude you'd expect from her famously take-no-prisoners approach to the competitors on MasterChef ...</p> <p>So, whether you want some ideas for cooking taro, help with getting something basic up to the standard of a professional kitchen or some inspiration for a weekday evening, or just some of the, erm, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2011/nov/17/masterchef-the-professionals\">gentle encouragement she's become famous for</a> in the MasterChef kitchen, Monica will be here for an hour from 12:30pm on Tuesday 16 October.
