  "<p>We strongly disagree with the chief of Barnardo's comment that there is no alternative to detaining children and their families (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/sep/11/barnardos-chief-social-care-asylum-seekers\" title=\"\">In the best interests of the children</a>, 12 September). The alternative is that children should not be detained as part of the asylum process. Recent figures show that numbers in detention have doubled since a year ago, and this does not include the significant number of children here without their families who are also being detained by the UK government. We work with child refugees being held in adult detention centres because the UK Border Agency does not believe them to be the age they say they are on arrival. Our report <a href=\"http://www.refugeecouncil.org.uk/policy/briefings/2012/18052012Notaminoroffence\" title=\"\">Not a Minor Offence</a> (May 2012) highlighted the devastating impact this has on their physical and mental wellbeing, and our work continues to ensure young people in this situation are released until properly assessed. We are hugely disappointed that the government has not lived up to its pledge in May 2010 to end child detention.<br><strong>Judith Dennis</strong><br><em>Policy officer, Refugee Council</em></p>",

  "<p>Two Dutch centrist parties are preparing to stitch up a new left-right coalition following an early general election being closely watched across Europe because of its potential impact on responses to the euro crisis and the Franco-German split over austerity versus growth policies.</p> <p>At the end of a volatile campaign that has seen hard-left anti-European socialists top the polls, traditionally powerful Christian democrats wiped out, and the social democrats of the Dutch Labour party slumping, it was the latter who were making the political weather, staging a remarkable comeback to rival the main governing party as election victors.</p> <p>The campaign has revolved around Europe and austerity after the minority centre-right coalition of Prime Minister Mark Rutte collapsed in April after less than two years because of disputes over spending cuts needed to meet EU budget deficit targets next year.</p> <p>Rutte's centre-right VVD party was running neck-and-neck with the Labour party whose new leader, Diederik Samsom, has emerged as the star of the election. Pundits predicted a new coalition of Labour and the VVD with around 70 of the 150 seats at stake, requiring a third junior coalition partner.</p> <p>The hard-left socialists were tipped to come third, with the far-right anti-immigration maverick, Geert Wilders (pictured), expected to lead his Freedom party to fourth place. Both Wilders and the socialists have waged an anti-austerity, anti-EU campaign, with Wilders's anti-Muslim and anti-immigrant activism playing a much lesser role because of the domination of economic issues and budget cuts.</p> <p>Samsom has quickly emerged as a prime-ministerial contender due to his strong television performance in the campaign debates. Most polls still predict Rutte's VVD will emerge as the marginal winner, meaning he would be first choice for prime minister. Power politics in the Netherlands get under way in the wake of rather than before an election because of the coalition system and the highly fragmented party spectrum. The horsetrading will start today and the formation of a government could take months.</p> <p>If, as expected, a Lib-Lab partnership is the basis of the new government, the key sticking points will be over the pace, scale and location of spending cuts and tax rises. There could be disputes over the ongoing attempts to stabilise the euro and Holland's participation in bailing out weaker eurozone countries. Rutte received much criticism during the campaign for declaring on television that Greece would not get another euro of Dutch money.</p> <p>The outgoing Rutte government was closely allied with Germany in taking a hawkish line on austerity and dictating tough terms to bailout beneficiaries. But his minority coalition collapsed when it emerged that the Netherlands also needed to fill a huge funding gap to meet EU-set budget deficit targets by next year.</p> <p>Wilders, propping up the minority government in parliament, vetoed the welfare cuts needed to meet Brussels' targets.</p> <p>In the expected new coalition, Labour will argue for slower spending cuts than Rutte, will take a softer line on eurozone bailouts, and also seek to temper the austerity, tilting the balance of power in the eurozone towards President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande's socialists in France and away from Chancellor Angela Merkel in Berlin.</p> <p>The two biggest parties, if joined in a coalition, will need to agree on raising the retirement age, on how to reform the most generous system of mortgage tax relief in Europe, on health, social security and other welfare cuts, all to meet EU budget targets in one of the wealthiest countries in Europe with some of the lowest unemployment.</p> <p>The likeliest outcome of the election will be to demonstrate that the Dutch have turned much more wary of the EU, albeit keen to keep the union and the euro.</p>",
  "<p>If you want to win someone round to your point of view, calling them a bigot is never likely to be the best starting point. Yet that is what the deputy PM nearly did to the opponents of gay marriage. \"<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/sep/11/nick-clegg-bigots-email-marriage?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">Continued trouble in the economy gives the bigots a stick to beat us with</a>,\" ran the press-released draft of a forthcoming speech. \"Bigots\" \u2013 hastily disavowed \u2013 now reads \"some people\", which will soon be the hot euphemism. (\"My Jewish friend wanted to join a golf club, but some people blackballed him.\")</p> <p>All this is unlikely to get \"some people\" on Nick Clegg's side. For a start, the very term \"bigot\" denotes someone immune to being reasoned round in the first place. Second, put yourself in their shoes. Someone calls you a bigot, and you'll immediately think they're an asshat. Consequently, whatever case they are trying to make will, in your mind, be contaminated by asshattery.</p> <p>Already \u2013 \"bigot!\" \"asshat!\" \u2013 you've left the realm of argument and entered the misty and intuitive world of essentialisms: what someone <em>is</em>, rather than what they think or say. This distinction is well made in US radio host Jay Smooth's short video, How to Tell People They Sound Racist, where he talks about the difference between the \"'what they did' conversation and the 'what they are' conversation\". His point is that the latter, though tempting, is unprovable so actually lets them off the hook. The old Christian saw \"love the sinner, and hate the sin\" articulates the same distinction. It may be noted as a side-point that that saw has, unfortunately, provided cover for a good bit of bigotry over the years. Here, we risk swerving into deep waters.</p> <p>Aristotle, in his Rhetoric, teaches us that the starting point for any argument is the \"ethos\" appeal: that is, the way a speaker sells him or herself to his audience. Reviling your enemies helps you sell yourself to your friends. Selling yourself to your enemies, though, is the way you win an argument. The conversation about any given issue may be geared to one or the other. In politics, it's the difference between speaking to your base and reaching out to the floating voters.</p> <p>When you take turns decrying something that has offended you in the Daily Mail, you're involved in one form of identity politics: affirming your membership of the group that finds things in the Daily Mail offensive. In election terms, you're dog-whistling to your base. That's not necessarily futile: we need battle lines. And weight of numbers can translate into main force.</p> <p>But if you want to persuade someone of something, the task at hand is to stress your common ground, not emphasise your differences. Say you're trying to bring a particular stripe of Tory round to a liberal view of immigration. Calling him a racist will be much less effective than appealing to his principles: if you're so keen on the free movement of capital, why is the free movement of labour not also a liberty you should be championing? He'll have an answer: but at this stage you're in dialogue.</p> <p>In the online world \u2013 in comment threads, on blogs and in those invigorating hurricanes of competitive outrage that blow from time to time through Twitter \u2013 we see a lot more of the former. We've read plenty about deindividuation and disinhibition: the way instantaneous and often anonymous commentary makes it much easier to hurl abuse. But we should also note that social media is expressly set up to put people in touch with the like-minded: there's a structural bias in favour of the dog-whistle.</p> <p>It's a question of the audience at which you are aiming. Clegg's proposed speech was not aimed at the people he called bigots: it was aimed, largely, at people who already agree with him. \"Bigots\" was shorthand for those who don't and are never likely to. It's a dog-whistle term intended to present an ethos appeal to Clegg's own constituency. <em>We</em> are reasonable: <em>they</em> are bigots. Let's rally together to thwart them.</p> <p>When it comes to winning round the bigots, Clegg would play a subtler game. He'd seek common ground. \"Of course you're not a bigot: you're wrestling with deep doctrinal difficulties in good conscience. That guy over there \u2013 [points to foaming-at-mouth Scottish cardinal equating gay marriage with slavery] \u2013 <em>that</em> is what I'd call a bigot. Hey: why don't we isolate him and see what we can work out?\"</p> <p>Unfortunately \u2013 which is exactly what we're all still struggling to get used to in the wired world \u2013 you are less and less able to choose your audience. The bigots are online too. And they can hear you talking about them.</p>",
  "<p>Mexico's small and medium sized enterprises account for more than 99% of the four million businesses in the country, generate 52% of GDP and provide 72% of employment. The government's business accelerator programme supports these SMEs by funding institutions that can help the sector grow by improving competitiveness, business opportunities and market scalability.</p> <p>One such business accelerator is the IDEARSE Center at Anahuac University in Mexico City. The centre's business model for SME acceleration is built around CSR, incorporating environmental impacts, human rights, self-regulation, social impacts and community involvement and stakeholder engagement.</p> <p>More remarkable still is that, by working with the supply chains of big brands such as Sony, Coca-Cola and Cemex and having trained more than 150 SMEs since 2007, the SMEs achieved sales growth of between 5% and 37% and jobs growth of between 5% and 19%. At the same time SME performance across all six CSR areas has improved between 23% and 46%. These numbers debunk several popular myths, most notably that CSR is not relevant, too expensive or not incentivised for SMEs. Let's look more closely at these myths.</p> <h2><strong>Is CSR relevant for SMEs?</strong></h2> <p>The issue of relevance largely hinges on whether you adopt a very literal and narrow interpretation of CSR. Laura Spence, director of the Royal Holloway, University of London's <a href=\"http://www.rhul.ac.uk/management/cris/\" title=\"\">Centre for Research into Sustainability</a>, says that the terminology of CSR is both inaccurate (as small firms are unlikely to be corporations) and off-putting jargon for SMEs.</p> <p>\"Also since CSR practice is often associated with reporting, SMEs don't stand a chance. They are unlikely to have external financial reports, let alone the time resources or need to produce a glossy CSR report,\" says Spence.</p> <p>So first, we need to get the labels and definitions right. The IDEARSE centre, for example, describes CSR as \"a permanent and continuous commitment, voluntarily adopted by the business, to respond to the economic, social and environmental impacts of its activities, and to guarantee the sustainable and human development to all its stakeholders.\" No doubt, it helps that CSR in Spanish (responsabilidad social empresarial or RSE) translates more accurately as socially responsible 'enterprise'.</p> <h2>Explicit or implicit CSR?</h2> <p>The second issue \u2013 whether CSR is too costly \u2013 is a real concern, but once again, it depends what we mean by CSR. Work by CSR academics Dirk Matten and Jeremy Moon distinguish between explicit and implicit CSR. Explicit CSR refers to many of the formalised practices we associate with large corporates, such as CSR codes, standards, managers, systems, reports and audits. These are resource intensive and mostly not feasible for SMEs.</p> <p>Implicit CSR, on the other hand, includes informal ethical practices that are not dependent on size or financial muscle. \"If you talk about the content of a socially responsible business \u2013 integrity, reputation, caring for employees, building relationships, community engagement \u2013 that is often simply an everyday part of SME life,\" Spence says. Many SMEs, thus, are practicing social responsibility without even knowing it or needing to give it a CSR label.</p> <p>Besides these implicit CSR practices, Itzel Lopez of the IDEARSE centre says that CSR is often crucial for SMEs because it can be \"a requirement imposed, not by the law, but by the market itself.\"</p> <p>She is referring to the growing practice of large companies in demanding ethical standards of their suppliers. Nike's supplier code of conduct and Walmart's supplier sustainability assessment are two cases that increasingly illustrate the rule rather than the exception.</p> <p>There is also a middle ground between too costly (explicit CSR) and business critical (supply chain compliance). As with CSR practiced by multinationals, SMEs can often find a business case in cost savings from eco-efficiency, especially from reductions in waste, water and energy. Furthermore, Lopez believes that \"CSR strategies can lend prestige and boost consumer confidence. They can also increase productivity by motivating employees and encourage loyalty.\"</p> <h2>Collaboration, values and frameworks</h2> <p>We should also not totally discount formalised CSR practices among SMEs. One of the things I observed when visiting the sugar plantations of Guatemala was that they had formed a cooperative of farms in order to tackle CSR. Individually, they were too small to justify a sustainable business programme, but collectively, it made sense. This is one of the ways that SMEs can address CSR, through pooling their resources and collaborating.</p> <p>On the issue of incentives, as most SMEs are owner-managed, the values of the director play a crucial role. My experience has been that most SME owners live in their communities and that responsibility often comes naturally to them. After all, they usually have to personally interact with their customers every day. The exceptions tend to be when SMEs are entirely set up for export and their employees are not also their customers. This not only creates worker dependency, but also low accountability for impacts on the community and environment.</p> <p>Besides the moral orientation of SME owners, governments can also help to create incentives for CSR adoption. It is no surprise that the IDEARSE centre was selected as one of the business accelerators in Mexico, since the government developed a national CSR standard in 2004 and has subsequently adopted ISO 26000 on social responsibility as a best practice guideline. Local support is also important. For instance, some years back I observed a local government agency in Scotland that had established a dedicated unit to offer free sustainable business advisory services to SMEs.</p> <p>But there is no denying that SMEs face many barriers \u2013 from alienating definitions and weak incentives to prohibitive costs and heavy-handed supply chain audits. But at least perceptions are changing, the evidence of benefits is mounting and helpful tools are increasingly available, such as the recently launched <a href=\"http://nbs.net/knowledge/primer-business-sustainability-for-smes/\" title=\"\">Primer on Business Sustainability for SMEs</a> and ACCA's report on <a href=\"http://www.accaglobal.com/content/dam/acca/global/PDF-technical/small-business/rr-128-001.pdf\" title=\"\">Environmental Aspects of Sustainability: SMEs and the Role of the Accountant</a>.</p> <p>I look forward to the day when pioneering British economist EF Schumacher's small is beautiful idiom applies as much to sustainable business as to economic activity. If Mexico's example is anything to go by, that day may come sooner than we expect.</p> <p><em>Wayne Visser is director of Kaleidoscope Futures and senior associate at the </em><a href=\"http://www.cpsl.cam.ac.uk/\" title=\"\"><em>University of Cambridge Programme for Sustainability Leadership</em></a><em>.

  "<p>The greatest danger <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/blog/2012/sep/06/history-sea-greenpeace-arctic-sunrise\" title=\"\">up here on the Arctic ice</a> is not getting lost or separated, falling in the water or freezing, but polar bears. At this time of year they hunt across the ice floes and are likely to come close out of curiosity. Already we have seen several on floes.</p> <p>Travelling with us \u2013 with a rifle \u2013 is Roland Hansen, a recently disbanded Danish soldier who has finished 26 months patrolling Denmark's remote 3,000km coastline in northern Greenland with the unique Sirius dog sledge teams.</p> <p>Taking tents, rifles, maps, satellite phones and enough food for days, six teams of two men, each with 13 dogs, travel continuously 5,000-6,000km a year between drop-off points where they have prepositioned supplies.</p> <blockquote> \"Bears travel big distances, they can swim hundreds of miles, from Greenland as far as Iceland. They are a constant presence in northern Greenland. We know mostly where they are. In November and December it's dark so we seldom see them. The sun rises in February and then they are there. <br> \"They like to go round us about 500-1,000m away. They are curious about what we are doing. They hear the dogs and smell us. They can come too close so we scare them off with flare guns. We do everything we can to avoid confrontations. They can move 50-60kph, whereas we can only do 10kph on our sledges.\" </blockquote> <p>When a bear attacks \u2013 which is rarely says Hansen \u2013 it will often be a young one, two or three years old whose mother has left it and who cannot find food to eat. \"He may be ill, not know his limits. We only shoot them at a 15-metre distance,\" he says.</p> <blockquote> \"Each team perhaps has to shoot one only every four or five years, whereas some Inuit communities have licences to kill 30 a year for food. I have never eaten bear. <br> \"We are quite likely to see them. I will patrol the floe. I would expect to see them. They hunt on the edges of the floes.\" </blockquote> <p>What he does not have with him are his dogs. These Greenlandic huskies, he says, are remarkable for their strength, stamina and loyalty. One of his, called Armstrong, is 12 years old and has pulled sledges over 100,000km.</p> <blockquote> <br>\"They are really well looked after. We depend on them for everything. They are our way of living. Without them we could never do the 3,000km journeys we do. They enable you to go places that snowmobiles would never let you. Each team has a top dog, which is like your right arm. You are very connected to all them.\" </blockquote> <p>The relationship with the other man in the team is equally important.</p> <blockquote> \"There's just the two of you, out there in the wilderness. My buddy is my doctor, my dentist, everything. He must be able to operate on me and I on him. We need to connect.\" </blockquote>",

  "<h2>Michael Bradley gets better with every game he doesn't play</h2> <p>Call it the Omar Gonzalez factor \u2014 after the LA defender who went from key defensive player to Beckenbauer (apparently) as the Galaxy seemed to fall apart in his absence due to injury earlier in the season. With each passing game Gonzalez sat out and his team mates struggled, so his reputation was enhanced. Michael Bradley too, is currently injured and didn't feature in the team camp let alone play any minutes in the Jamaica series, but he haunted both versions of the US midfield in these two games, with the thought of what might have been had he been on the field.</p> <p>In the first game, other than the Edu through-ball that set up Gomez and Dempsey to fashion the opener in just 36 seconds, there was virtually no cohesive forward movement from the trio of American defensive midfielders, as poor possession allied with little ambition left the forwards repeatedly isolated from the men meant to fill in behind them. It left tantalizing space in the center of the park, where you might normally expect Bradley to be snarling and driving forward with the ball from box to box.</p> <p>In the second game, the US showed more ambition going forward and, until they scored, much better discipline and tempo \u2014 Williams in particular had perhaps his best game in a US shirt, before fading late on. But as the shape of the game changed and it became a different mission, the swop of Edu for Zusi, whilst a sensible precaution, just brought home the versatility of Bradley, who's as comfortable fighting a rearguard action as driving the offense forward. Without such a figure to provide continuity in different phases of the game, the US lost direction.</p> <p>In truth, just as the unfair version of events that suggested Bradley was in the team due to nepotism when his father was in charge, was never accurate, nor too is the idea that Bradley's time in Chievo and five minutes with Roma has turned him into a worldbeater. But what is undoubtedly true is that his absence hinders the US midfield, whatever they are being set up to achieve.</p> <h2>Gomez is starting on merit</h2> <p>There's an expectation, which may yet become the norm for the US side, that Hercules Gomez is best used as a late game substitute \u2013 he's made to be a handful for tired defenses and it's a role he's often performed with relish for his Mexican club side Santos Laguna. But Gomez seized his chance during the five game team camp before this qualifying tournament began, and regardless of the form of others has made a compelling case for Klinsmann to keep including him. Against Jamaica he started both games and had a hand in both goals: <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/sep/08/jamaica-usa-live#block-504a8d0958f94f441baa77ac\">running at the Jamaica defense to force the chance that fell to Dempsey for the early opener in Kingston</a>; <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/sep/12/usa-jamaica-live#block-504fe4db58f94f441baa7a9b\">putting a free kick on target to break the deadlock in Columbus</a>. His versatility was also useful in a game where he and Dempsey occasionally dropped deep to link up the US possession play, providing an ersatz version of the continuity Donovan and Bradley usually add. When those two starters return, it will be interesting to see if Klinsmann persists with Gomez playing in front of say Dempsey and Donovan, or if he'll default to the more familiar Altidore.</p> <p>Altidore had a chance to make a case for himself in these two games, but he had an anonymous and isolated time in the first game, and in the second game, as a late sub, failed to find the touch or coolness to hold the ball up as the US tried to hold their lead \u2013 poor first touches and over-elaboration turning the ball over to the visitors too easily. He's been in fine goalscoring form in Europe of course, as has Boyd \u2014 but on the empirical evidence of the US games alone, Gomez is starting on merit.</p> <h2>Torres didn't seize the day</h2> <p>So once again a combination of injuries and an underwhelming performance by his defensive midfield peers in the previous game handed Jose Torres yet another chance to convince. And while he didn't pay badly in Columbus, the fact that he was outshone by a fringe player like Zusi did the nominally creative midfielder no favours.</p> <p>After a game in which the US had suffered for their negative play the onus was on their attacking central players to prove that creativity could do what caution could not, but Torres managed only a decent game when a statement game was called for. While Zusi and Cherundolo were combining down the right, and his full back Johnson looking for overlaps to do the same with him, Torres never quite got into the game in the same way, or even set the tempo like Williams, who as the nominal deep player got forward consistently to link the play. Torres meanwhile was tidy, and to his credit made a couple of good saving challenges to nip speedy Jamaican counters in the bud \u2013 but <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/sep/12/usa-jamaica-live\">as was noted in the minute-by-minute report</a>, this was a game where the imperative was to seize the day rather than just avoid being singled out for having made mistakes.</p> <p>That said, Torres could have been forgiven for watching the example of Kyle Beckerman \u2013 who in the space of a few weeks has gone from one of the heroes of Mexico, to watching in horror as his reckless foul then trailing foot in the wall combined to let Jamaica equalize on Friday, to losing his starting spot altogether for the second Jamaica game, with perhaps limited prospects for another look anytime soon. Faced with that example, Torres may have decided that regardless of what he ended up creating, at the very least costly mistakes wouldn't be traced back to him. He didn't make any \u2013 but he didn't make much else either.</p> <h2>This is still a brittle US team</h2> <p>There was a telling moment late in the second game at Crew Stadium, where Carlos Bocanegra could be seen shouting over to his fellow central defender Geoff Cameron to calm down. Cameron had had a fine game, but the US were collectively in danger of losing their heads. Having played a confident high tempo possession game to get into a 1-0 lead, they played out the last twenty minutes or so as if they didn't know what to do with it. Suddenly we were reminded of the fact that while many of these players might play for fine club sides, several are inexperienced at international level \u2013 Cameron for example entered 2012 with just five minutes of international soccer under his belt. Despite the late hiccups on Tuesday night though, he should finish it as a starting center back for the national team.</p> <p>After the mini-camp earlier this year, and the friendly <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/feb/29/usa-beat-italy-soccer-clint-dempsey\">wins in Italy</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/aug/16/mexico-usa-live\">Mexico</a>, the team were arguably as well prepared as they could have been for this first round of World Cup qualifying, but Cameron was just one of several players the coach hopes will be key in 2014, who are getting their first tastes of just what is meant by the \"slog of CONCACAF qualifying\" \u2013 every game is a potential ambush and it's very easy for a side to drift into trouble if they don't show mental fortitude. Jamaica could tell the US that. Following the US goal they slipped from first to third in the Group A standings with two games to go. The US will need all their young players to show resolve over the full 180 minutes remaining in this qualifying campaign.</p> <p>Speaking of which\u2026</p> <h2>Don't make any plans for 16 October</h2> <p>The US still have to go to Antigua, who have shown they can live with every other team in this mini-group of four \u2013 including leading the US a merry dance in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/jun/08/world-cup-2014-usa-antigua-live\">the opening group game before eventually going down 3-1</a>. But barring major accidents there, with three sides now tied on seven points, with two places available in the next round (the so-called hexagonal), the US's final home game against Guatemala at Livestrong Park, on Tuesday 16 October, could be a very tense night. A late Marco Pappa free kick to cancel out a Clint Dempsey strike saw<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/jun/13/usmnt-usa-guatemala-live\"> the sides share the points in their first meeting</a> and we can expect another physical encounter when the two sides meet again.</p> <p>And doubtless prior to that one we'll be having yet another conversation about what message Klinsmann's midfield choices are sending out. In Kingston we had a shapeless trio of defensive midfielders conspiring to throw away a lead; in Columbus we had better tempo and invention from Williams and Zusi in particular \u2014 though the latter was helped by some sparky overlapping play from Cherundolo and the fact that the left side of defense was the weak spot for Jamaica in both games.</p> <p>The frustration is that having taken the lead in dominant fashion against Jamaica, the US then set back and courted disaster against a side they'd already given up a 1-0 lead to, and in the context of a very tight group where every goal may end up counting. Carlos Ruiz's shot from distance took Guatemala past Antigua on Tuesday night, after a 3-1 victory in the reverse victory on Friday. Should the US better that score in Antigua, they'll be in a strong position come the 16th, but the idea that they may well be going into that final fixture with one eye on the goals scored column will not make their fans comfortable \u2013 and if those fans see another defensive midfield line up sent out to face Guatemala in Kansas City, Klinsmann might find himself creating a few more sceptics for his revolution.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.concacaf.com/page/WCQ/Home/0,,12813,00.html\">Concacaf World Cup qualifying schedule and standings</a></p>",

  "<p>A while ago, a friend of mine from Lancashire asked if I knew where Alvin Stardust was born. She had a vague childhood memory of seeing a huge mural of the 70s star, the size of a whole house, on the end of a terrace in Bury. I checked and found out that Stardust \u2013 whose real name was Bernard Jewry \u2013 was <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alvin_Stardust\" title=\"\">born in London and grew up in Nottingham</a>; we decided the mural, if she hadn't dreamed the whole thing, was most likely a painting of Elvis that had gone awry.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396041361\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Observer/Columnist/Columnists/2012/9/12/1347448470308/Alvin-Stardust-by-Walter--008.jpg\" alt=\"Alvin Stardust by Walter Kershaw\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Alvin Stardust mural in Bury</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01mk8zs\" title=\"\">Radio 4 programme</a> on Thursday proves that my friend wasn't hallucinating. The Alvin mural was the work of Walter Kershaw, a Rochdale-born artist who has been hailed as Britain's first graffiti artist, and is celebrated in the documentary by writer and fellow Rochdale resident Mark Hodkinson.</p> <p>In the 70s, Kershaw's work was dotted all around Lancashire mill towns \u2013 there was the \"inside-out house\" in his home town of Rochdale, which Hodkinson remembers very clearly. \"It just seemed normal to me. When you're a kid, you don't deconstruct these things. But when you're older, you realise it wasn't normal at all.\"</p> <p>Another work was a condor over the Andes on a terrace awaiting demolition in Oldham. \"The weather up here battered them,\" says Hodkinson. \"They were gone in a few years. He knew the work was ephemeral but it didn't bother him.\"</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396041362\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Observer/Columnist/Columnists/2012/9/12/1347449228860/Walter-Kershaw-pansies-008.jpg\" alt=\"Walter Kershaw pansies\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pansies by Walter Kershaw</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Kershaw studied fine art at Durham and, while his star may have dimmed, he was a fairly regular presence on TV and radio in the 70s and 80s, interviewed by Russell Harty, Sue MacGregor and Janet Street-Porter. He has had murals commissioned in Sao Paulo, Mexico, Sarajevo and Los Angeles, but it's unlikely any of these could have had the shock value of his technicolour guerilla work on red-brick Lancashire back streets.</p> <p>He tended to start work early, at 5am in the summer, and travelled with a friend on a motorbike just in case someone objected vehemently. Hodkinson marvels \"about the guts it took \u2013 these were quite rough neighbourhoods. But people were really encouraging. They used to bring tea and butties out for him and his assistants. It was like having your house tattooed. He had a queue of people asking him to do their house next.\" Local councils were less keen, and Kershaw received a string of cease and desist letters, though no one ever pursued charges.</p> <p>None of the mill town murals survive \u2013 most were painted on slum clearance properties, which was part of their intended ephemeral nature. Kershaw still lives in Rochdale and still gets regular commissions, the most recent being the <a href=\"http://www.littleboroughcoachhouse.org/annual-arts-festival\" title=\"\">Coach House in nearby Littleborough</a>.</p> <p>\"He loves to put little jokes in his work. The coach house mural is about the history of transport, but next to this upstanding Victorian gentleman sitting on a train he's painted <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/fernando-torres\">Fernando Torres</a>,\" says Hodkinson.</p> <p>The question remains as to why he chose to sprinkle a little Alvin Stardust on a house in Bury. Apparently, Kershaw planned to paint Elvis, but didn't have a picture to hand on the morning he set out. He was off on his bike before the residents noticed.</p>",
  "<p>As anxiety around high and volatile food prices grows, global hunger is again prominent on the international agenda. Later this month, <a href=\"http://in.reuters.com/article/2012/09/11/g20-mexico-idINL1E8KBD9J20120911\" title=\"\">G20 officials meeting in Mexico City</a> will discuss global action to tackle food price spikes. On Tuesday, French president Fran\u00e7ois Hollande said he is trying to persuade world leaders to set up <a href=\"http://uk.reuters.com/article/2012/09/11/uk-france-grain-hollande-idUKBRE88A17320120911\" title=\"\">strategic stockpiles of agricultural commodities</a> as a buffer against extreme price swings. In October, the UN is expected to release <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/poverty-matters/2012/jan/26/global-hunger-fao-figures-add-up\" title=\"\">revised estimates</a> of how many people go to bed hungry each night.</p> <p>The Guardian is currently hosting an exhibition by photographer <a href=\"http://gideonmendel.com/\" title=\"\">Gideon Mendel</a>, who visited four schemes run by <a href=\"http://www.concern.net/en\" title=\"\">Concern Worldwide</a> in northern Kenya, where many of the poorest families spend up to 80% of their income on food. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/gallery/2012/sep/12/tackling-hunger-kenya-in-pictures?intcmp=122\" title=\"\">This collection of photos</a> helps capture the human dimension of the ongoing battle against hunger.</p> <p>Teso Diba lives in the dusty and barren settlement of Sahgel, around 18 miles from the mountains of Marsabit in northern Kenya. She faces a daily struggle to provide food for her children. Teso and her family are pastoralists who herd livestock and rely on their animals for food and income, but poor rainfall has depleted the herd and the remaining animals are weak and hard to sell.</p> <p>Diba's four-year-old son is being treated for severe malnutrition in Concern's outreach nutrition programme. \"My son Umuro started losing weight and getting sick, and I knew it was because I didn't have enough food in the house,\" she says. \"When Concern arrived at the village, they asked if I wanted to have my children checked and weighed and I was glad someone was seeing him finally. Now he is in the programme he is getting better and stronger, but food has really become a problem for us lately.\"</p> <p>Another programme featured in the exhibition aims to combat the effects of drought, one of the toughest problems the pastoralists have to face. A micro-irrigation project in Madowadi, a small settlement in northern Kenya by the Ethiopian border, 430 miles from Nairobi, provides pastoralists with an alternative livelihood. The programme participants are Borana \u2013 a pastoral people who have lost most of their animals to drought.</p> <p>The micro-irrigation project has now been running for two years. Before it was set up, people had to cut down trees for wood to use in construction projects, or for charcoal \u2013 hazardous work, because it is illegal to cut down the trees for charcoal. They would have to wait, entering the towns and villages when the ministry men were gone, or selling the fruits of their labour on the road outside.</p> <p>The micro-irrigation programme set up by Concern and its local partner, <a href=\"http://www.cifakenya.org/\" title=\"\">Community Initiative Facilitation and Assistance</a> (Cifa), has helped transform this settlement into an oasis of green in a usually dry landscape, providing the community with new sources of food. There are 30 households in the programme and each has a plot.</p> <p>From dawn to dusk, Jillo Dabassa, one of the programme's participants, works on her plot. \"I was divorced and left with with children, and I had to find a way of making a living,\" she says. \"I burned charcoal and borrowed money. I was looked down on in the village and no one helped me out. Then Cifa came to my community. They introduced me to farming and gave me training.\"</p> <p>Water is pumped from a pan built by Cifa and directed to tiny holes 20cm apart in plastic pipes. Plants are placed exactly where the water drips out, ensuring that the water seeps gently but effectively into the roots. Tomatoes, onions and kale are flourishing. The goal is to protect the community protect against the shock of future droughts, and building resilience is a key aim . Anne O'Mahony, Concern's country director, says: \"The problem that many of the most vulnerable people face is the uncertainty of how they will provide for their families. There are so many factors that are outside of their control. We are working out ways that address their immediate needs but, more importantly, enable people to secure their own stable futures. \"</p> <p>The exhibition, Four Stories about Hunger, is on until Thursday 20 September 2012 at the Guardian Gallery, Kings Place, London N1.</p> <p>\u2022 <em>Chris Elliott is the Guardian's readers' editor and a trustee of </em><a href=\"http://www.concern.net/en\" title=\"\"><em>Concern Worldwide</em></a><em> (UK).

  "<p>Our dear friend Clover Graham, who has been murdered in Jamaica aged 56, was a lawyer, human rights activist and since 1998 honorary liaison in Jamaica to the United Nations Refugee Agency (UNHCR).</p> <p>Born in Portland, Jamaica, she joined her father in Britain when she was six. She prospered academically, gaining undergraduate and postgraduate degrees from Kingston University and the London School of Economics as she pursued a career in law.</p> <p>Clover developed a political and social consciousness through study and voluntary work, beginning with her campaign at Norwood girls' school in south London to have the histories and achievements of black people reflected in the curriculum. She continued this work, through participation in the Brixton Black Women's group, supporting poor young mothers in the Mary Seacole craft group as they moved towards economic and psychological independence and through her unstinting support for Sabarr Books in Brixton \u2013 the first volunteer-run black bookshop in south London.</p> <p>On qualifying as a lawyer, she worked at Brixton Community Law Centre, defending the black community against discrimination. She preferred to work quietly and painstakingly behind the scenes. At a particularly difficult time, during the first Brixton uprising in 1981, she contributed to the acquittal of many defendants.</p> <p>In 1990 Clover decided she could make a greater contribution in Jamaica, continuing the work started in the UK. She worked at the legal aid clinic of the Norman Manley Law School in Kingston; lectured at the University of Technology on land law, a critical aspect of a young country's development; and worked with the UNHCR.</p> <p>All her work reflected a life in law, and most importantly in service to others \u2013 devoted to the defence of the marginalised and the dispossessed. Clover was first diagnosed with cancer in 2001, and it returned seven years later. In 2007 her son, Taiwo, was murdered in St Andrew, Jamaica. Nevertheless, she lived without bitterness and encouraged others to do so.</p> <p>She is survived by her husband, Rex McKenzie, whom she married in 1984, and two daughters, Arusha and Zakiya.</p>",
  "<p>Defence sources have dismissed as \"political posturing\" reports that soldiers will be deployed as strike-breakers.</p> <p>The military has in the past been brought in to cover for strikers, most recently in the fire service, but has done so specifically to ensure public safety. There is no appetite for troops to cover for immigration workers or tube drivers, for example, as reports suggested.</p> <p>One official source described the suggestion as \"not realistic\". Another said any proposal to bring in troops in areas not related to public safety but, for example, to prop up the economy would be entirely new territory.</p> <p>The contingency plans, said to have been discussed by David Cameron and the Cabinet Office minister, Francis Maude, appear to have come as a surprise to the Ministry of Defence.</p> <p>Officials pointed out that apart from the fire service, other groups that could have an impact on public safety, including prison officers and the police, were prevented from taking strike action.</p> <p>Ministers appear to have been impressed by the way the military came in to help control entry into Olympic venues after the failure of the private security company G4S to recruit and train sufficient people. But this was an informal, entirely voluntary arrangement.</p> <p>The Fire Brigades Union has warned the government that using soldiers as a replacement public sector workforce in the event of co-ordinated mass strikes risks politicising the army.</p> <p>The FBU's general secretary, Matt Wrack, said reports of creating an auxiliary workforce to mitigate walkouts would not be welcomed by members of the armed forces who were also facing redundancies and spending cuts. \"It starts to politicise the role of the armed forces in relation to political and industrial matters,\" said Wrack.</p> <p>He added: \"It's provocative, especially after they have made hundreds if not thousands of service people redundant, suffering the same austerity cuts as anyone else. I suspect armed forces personnel themselves may not be too happy about it.\"</p> <p>The report in the Times of a government strike contingency strategy emerged as the annual Trades Union Congress in Brighton carried a motion calling on the union umbrella body to consider the practicalities of calling a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/sep/11/tuc-to-consider-general-strike\" title=\"\">general strike</a>. A day earlier the TUC carried a motion calling for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/sep/10/tuc-public-sector-strikes-pay\" title=\"\">co-ordinated action</a> over public sector pay restraint, a scenario viewed as much more likely than a general strike.</p> <p>The TUC general secretary, Brendan Barber, who has played down the chances of a general strike, also warned that involving the armed forces in strike contingencies would politicise the army. \"The government should concentrate on resolving issues through negotiation, not through the provocative use of troops as strike-breakers,\" he said. \"It is hard to think that the armed services would be happy to used in this highly political way. It would mark the UK out from other similar advanced democracies.\"</p> <p>Help provided by the armed forces in the event of emergencies and threats to public safety are governed by Military Aid to the Civil Authorities (Maca), a term that contains specific criteria relating to maintenance of law, order and public safety. They include the principle that military intervention should always be the last resort and that the need for the military to act is urgent. Maca includes disarming unexploded bombs, air-sea rescue and mountain rescue.</p> <p>A spokesperson for the Prime Minister said: \"Of course we have contingency plans in place. Clearly I'm not going to comment on specifics of our contingency plans but those plans have not changed. Those plans are designed to take action over a range of scenarios. But the main point here is we do not think strike action is appropriate: it won't benefit anyone, we are not intending to re-open negotiations on pay and pensions, which have already been settled.\"</p> <p>A Ministry of Defence spokesman said: \"National contingency arrangements are a matter for the Cabinet Office. Established procedures for the provision of military assistance to the civilian authorities exist, which are tried and tested and were employed during both the recent Olympic Games and in preparation for a possible fuel strike earlier this year. These have not changed.\"</p>",

  "<p>The list of things that people are expecting \u2013 or perhaps hoping \u2013 to see in an iPhone 5 is growing longer and longer: 4G/LTE connectivity, fingerprint recognition, a bigger screen. But what are the things that would really be useful in the next iPhone? </p> <p>Having used an iPhone for around a year, and before that having used Android phones, and having also used Windows Phones at various points in between, here's my list of things that I really want to see in the next iPhone \u2013 though I'm not necessarily optimistic that they'll arrive. There's also a list of things that are rumoured (some more than others) but I don't expect.</p> <h2>What the next iPhone should have</h2> <p><strong>1) Better signal reception.</strong> I live in a rural area where the mobile signal is variable at best; though it's possible to get a signal in the kitchen standing at the end of the table, moving a few inches to left or right can kill it to zero. When I've tried Samsung smartphones and non-smartphones on the same network in the same location, they seem to handle it fine. </p> <p><strong>2) Longer battery life.</strong> Of course, everyone says they want this, but the iPhone is again not a great contender. The iPhone 4S in particular has <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2011/oct/11/iphone-4s-battery-life-standby\">shorter standby battery life than the iPhone 4</a>, for reasons that have never been explained (though might be due to the heftier CPU). Certainly I've found that after a day consisting of a couple of hours' music listening, in parallel with a few hours' email, web and app use plus some phone calls, that the iPhone falls gasping across the threshold as you arrive home. </p> <p>Other makers (Samsung again, and RIM's BlackBerrys, and to a lesser extent Nokia's new Lumias) do better here. Perhaps the addition of an LTE capability with a larger screen (both anticipated) will mean a bigger battery capacity \u2013 so that if you're not using 4G, you'll get more battery time. I certainly hope so.</p> <p><strong>3) Android's \"pattern unlock\" system.</strong> Since I first used it on the first Android phone (the G1), I've liked this system enormously. You have a 3x3 grid of dots: you swipe a pattern (which you decide) to unlock it. Much quicker and easier to get right than numeric pins you type in. Obviously, to offer this Apple would have to license the patent from Google \u2013 and that's unlikely to happen in a hurry.</p> <p><strong>4) A \"scripting language\"</strong> to tie together multiple functions. Sometimes you want to turn off your Wi-Fi or turn off your 3G at the same time that you start a new app, or set an alarm for 15 minutes' time unless you receive a phone call, or any number of combined actions. That's when you need to be able to chain together functions from different settings or apps. Desktop OSs have this (Apple has a language called \"Applescript\"), and Android has an app that uses it in the form of <a href=\"http://tasker.dinglisch.net/\">Tasker</a>. As smartphones get smarter, we need to make them simpler to use by putting programs together. </p> <p>There are some signs that Apple is doing something like this, with a <a href=\"http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/12/08/28/apple_patent_hints_at_situationally_aware_iphone.html\">patent on a system to change smartphone settings by location</a>, but that falls a little short. Also, the strings of actions you want to trigger aren't necessarily location-dependent; it might depend on time, or battery level, or location.</p> <p><strong>5) More control of phone functions using Siri.</strong> Though everyone was dismissive about Siri when it was introduced, I have found it increasingly effective: having a phone with a multi-digit numeric lock means that it's often faster to tell Siri \"Tell X I'm on my way over\" and have that sent as a text message than to unlock the phone, go to the Messages app, type a name and type a message. I can also walk while Siri does the hard work, which means I get there sooner. </p> <p>Voice control is surprisingly liberating once you start using it enough. Get a pair of headphones with a mic and you don't have to take the phone out of your pocket.</p> <p>But what's missing is the ability to use Siri to turn functions such as Wi-Fi on or off, <strike> or to launch apps </strike> (<a href=\"http://www.apple.com/ios/ios6/siri/\">you can launch apps in iOS6</a>), or trigger a chain of actions created by your scripting language as above. (Obviously you'd want to block: \"Siri, factory reset.\") There's a whole landscape of voice-controlled potential out there just waiting to be used. </p> <p><strong>6) A bigger screen.</strong> It's not that high on my list, but it's definitely a good thing in a phone. In time I can see phones becoming more like Samsung's Galaxy Note with its 5in screen: you control it mostly without having to see it (by voice), and then bring it out when you do want to interact with the screen, which because it's big offers the best interaction. Samsung is definitely on the right track with the Note.</p> <p><strong>7) Better use of colour</strong> to indicate status in the status bar at the top of the screen. At the moment they're monochrome; but it would be useful to know whether the phone signal is strong or weak through coloured bars (red, orange, green) as well as the number of bars; ditto for Wi-Fi and battery. It means at-a-glance understanding of what the phone's state is.</p> <p><strong>8) Less intrusive notifications.</strong> The introduction of notifications in the status bar in iOS5 (which people say copy Android, but are actually much more like Palm's webOS \u2013 because the engineer came from Palm) is great: it's a very quick way to find out what's new. But they have an annoying habit of covering navigation elements at the top of any onscreen page.</p> <p>That means that if you're in a hurry and haven't been using your phone and have a lot of notifications, they keep rolling over the element and getting in your way; you have to flick them out of the way like flies, and there's a high risk of hitting a notification instead of an element, and getting yanked over to the notifying app. This is really annoying. Perhaps a larger screen will solve this by putting more space between status bar and the onscreen elements. Here's hoping.</p> <p><strong>9) 4G/LTE.</strong> We know this is coming, but it would be good to have the option of the superfast speeds it offers, even at the cost of burning through one's battery in an hour or so.</p> <p><strong>10) Wireless charging.</strong> Nokia got here first with the Lumia 920 (and HP before that with the TouchPad tablet). It is indubitably cool to be able to dump a phone in a cradle without attachments and then grab it up when you need it. </p> <p><strong>Update:</strong> <a href=\"http://twitter.com/HmmmUK/status/245539620337627136\">one remark on Twitter</a> was \"it appears a 'Samsung Android' already answers a number of your iPhone X requirements\". That's true except in one key area: user experience. In my opinion, the iOS experience is better than Android in lots of subtle ways that cumulatively all add up. Samsung's TouchWiz slows phones down (to give juddering scrolling); HTC's interface is the nicest I've tried. </p> <p><strong>Update:</strong> Android's notifications <em>in Gingerbread</em>, still the most widely used Android OS, aren't as informative as those on iOS5; they don't have content, just the fact that you have a message. Android 4.x does provide more detail in notifications. </p> <h2>Things I'm not expecting to see in the next iPhone</h2> <p><strong>1) Fingerprint reading.</strong> I know <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/sep/09/apple-security-iphone-5-authentec\">Apple is buying Authentec</a>, but it won't have had time to incorporate it.</p> <p><strong>2) NFC.</strong> There's no indication that Apple has yet decided that it wants to take on the monster that is cashless payments just yet. Perhaps in a year's time.</p> <p><strong>3) A 5in screen.</strong> It will be bigger than the present 3.5in (measured diagonally), but not that big.</p> <p><strong>4) Face recognition/unlocking.</strong> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2011/oct/19/samsung-nexus-prime-ice-cream-sandwich\">Google has the patent on that</a>.</p> <p><strong>5) Curved screen.</strong> The <a href=\"http://www.pcworld.com/article/228395/iphone_5_said_to_have_curved_glass_screen.html\">rumours abound</a>, but it just doesn't sound like what Apple would do.</p> <p><strong>6) Haptic feedback.</strong> It's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/mar/07/ipad-3-touch-senseg-haptic\">an idea whose time will (probably) come one day</a>, but almost certainly not on phones.</p>",
  "<p>Just nine weeks into a new job that pits his critical intellect and earlier game-changing Aids treatment advocacy against the need to relegitimise a very sick multilateral institution, the most startling contradictions were laid out in front of the World Bank president, Jim Yong Kim, in South Africa. Yet during his trip, those contradictions were barely acknowledged, despite the fact that the country is screaming out for decisive leadership and moral clarity.</p> <p>Last Thursday, Kim met President Jacob Zuma, finance minister Pravin Gordhan and other cabinet ministers in Pretoria, and then, down the road in Johannesburg, he praised the World Bank's local International Finance Corporation (IFC) staff, who are dedicated to private-sector investments, and <a href=\"http://blogs.worldbank.org/voices/a-great-day-in-south-africa-for-a-development-junkie\" title=\"\">even recorded a brief video</a> while visiting Mailtronic Direct Marketing, a successful, IFC-funded small business specialising in printing and posting.</p> <p>In his blog the next day, Kim was effusive about the trip, including \"possible collaboration on an issue dear to my heart: fighting the spread of tuberculosis\".</p> <p>Really? If this is not public relations gimmickry, and if Kim genuinely wants to tackle TB, it would mark a U-turn in the bank's historic trajectory. From 1951, the bank lavishly financed the then-apartheid regime's Eskom energy parastatal, which built coal-fired power plants and transmission lines that entirely avoided black townships and villages. The majority of the country's people were left to use dirty indoor energy (paraffin, coal and wood) for cooking and warming their shelters, regardless of the profuse particles produced that could lead to or exacerbate respiratory illnesses.</p> <p>Bank-financed electricity mainly supplied South Africa's mining houses and smelters, as is still the case (the main customer of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/apr/01/medupi-world-bank-loan-vote\" title=\"\">Medupi coal-fired power station</a> currently being built will be BHP Billiton, which consumes more than 10% of the country's power to smelt aluminium). Then and now, this facilitated South Africa's notorious migrant labour system, with low pay to migrant workers who succumbed to TB in squalid, single-sex, 16-to-a-room hostels and shacks.</p> <p>Kim failed to address these historic issues, which are mirrored in his institution's current portfolio, especially the <a href=\"http://ciel.org/Law_Communities/Lonmin_17Aug2012.html\" title=\"\">IFC's controversial commitment</a> (approved by former president Paul Wolfowitz in 2007) of $150m in equity/credit lines to <a href=\"http://www.ifc.org/ifcext/spiwebsite1.nsf/0/f79e1c278b21ebc2852576ba000e2919?opendocument\" title=\"\">Lonmin</a> at the Marikana mine, as well as the $3.75bn for the Medupi plant north of Pretoria, pushed through by his immediate predecessor, Robert Zoellick.</p> <p>The 34 victims of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/16/south-african-police-shoot-striking-miners?intcmp=239\" title=\"\">Marikana massacre</a> were mainly migrants from Lesotho and the Eastern Cape. Their migrant labour status replicates apartheid, including health vulnerability in disease-ridden shack settlements.</p> <p>Many more low-income South Africans have shifted to <a href=\"http://ccs.ukzn.ac.za/files/groundwork%20WB%20and%20Eskom.pdf\" title=\"\">dirty energy sources</a> (pdf) that spread TB, thanks to electricity price increases of 128% from 2008-12, justified by Eskom's \"build programme\", which features Medupi. Worsening price and access problems, in turn, have prompted thousands of \"service delivery protests\" that often became violent. The very day Kim arrived, hundreds of Medupi workers downed tools over grievances associated with outsourcing, and protests forced <a href=\"www.allzanews.com/2012/09/06/eskom-evacuates-plant-as-protest-turns-violent/\" title=\"\">an evacuation</a> of the construction site.</p> <p>\"Coal is a difficult issue,\" Kim said at his Pretoria press conference, while promising to help with South Africa's $100bn coal-centred infrastructure expansion. Medupi alone will spew 25m tonnes of CO<sub>2</sub> annually, more than the emissions total of 115 countries.</p> <p>Then Kim's spin turned surreal. \"There was a very strong sense that this clean coal project [Medupi] was the way to go,\" he said. The very phrase evokes a shudder, considering <a href=\"http://www.edf.org/sites/default/files/9553_coal-plants-health-impacts.pdf\" title=\"\">an estimated 10,000 people die annually from multilateral-financed, coal-fired power plants</a>, according to the Environmental Defence Fund. Given the ongoing mining chaos here, including widespread acid mine drainage wrecking eastern South Africa's water, \"clean coal\" is a contradiction in terms. The renewable energy piece of the Eskom loan was acknowledged as a \"fig leaf\" by <a href=\"http://openmediaboston.org/node/1250\" title=\"\">William Moomaw</a>, a bank consultant to the Medupi loan.</p> <p>What about Kim's enthusiastic praise for Mailtronic's \"great story\"? Organised labour here valiantly opposes \"tenderpreneur\" dealings that cause state shrinkage via outsourced tenders on behalf of entrepreneurs. The World Bank pushed Pretoria to privatise after Nelson Mandela took office in 1994, and it was insensitive for Kim to promote outsourced printing when the government should be building internal mass-communications capacity.</p> <p>Equally dubious was the claim that IFC's stake in Mailtronic's junk-mail paper/packaging waste \u2013 with its promotion of rampant consumerism \u2013 contributes to fighting poverty.</p> <p>As the neoliberal Columbia University <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/economics-blog/2012/apr/27/world-bank-mistake-jagdish-bhagwati\" title=\"\">economist Jagdish Bhagwati</a> said of the US-led nomination and selection process in April, it was of a piece with the \"linguistic obfuscations that dominate American public debate\", and allowed Kim to gain presidency of the World Bank unfairly. Though I would quickly diverge from Bhagwati's agenda, Kim's visit here gives further reasons for him <a href=\"http://www.counterpunch.org/2012/04/16/why-jim-kim-should-resign-from-the-world-bank/\" title=\"\">to resign</a>, before more futile statements are uttered in defence of the indefensible at the World Bank.</p>",

In his evidence to the education committee this morning, he came close to encouraging employers should devalue Welsh exam results. Here is a summary of the main points from the hearing.</p> <p><strong>\u2022 Gove said that Welsh pupils would suffer as a result of<a href=\"http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/2012/09/11/leighton-andrews-orders-wjec-to-regrade-english-language-gcse-results-91466-31814517/\"> the Welsh government\u2019s decision to order GCSE results to be regraded </a>because in future employers would not value their qualifications as much as English ones.</strong> He said Leighton Andrews, the Labour education minster in the Welsh government, was being \u201cirresponsible\u201d.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I believe that the children who have been disadvantaged are children in Wales. I think the decision by the Welsh education minister, Leighton Andrews, is irresponsible and mistaken. And I think that he has undermined confidence in Welsh children\u2019s GCSEs and I think that he should think again having made what I regard to be a regrettable political intervention in what should be a process free from political meddling ...</p> <p>He\u2019s in the wrong and the Welsh children are suffering. The difficulty, as pointed out by Ofqual yesterday, is that the same exam by the same board was sat by children either side of the English/Welsh border. Children in Wales did appreciably worse than children in England sitting the same exam. That reinforces what every interntional survey shows, which is that children in Wales have suffered as a result of education policies put forward by Labour politicians which have abolished league tables, ended the objective assessment of children at the end of key stage two and ensured that there is less rigour in the approach towards eduction.</p> <p>Now, finding himself in a fix and his education system in the dock, a Labour politician has attempted to shift blame. I think that is irresponsible and the children who suffer are the children from Wales who when they apply for jobs in England will hand over certificates which profess to be good passes and English employers will now say: \u201cI fear, through no fault of your own - I\u2019m sure you\u2019re the right person to be employed - but I cannot count your exam pass as equivalent to this other exam pass.\u201d And I think to have made the decision that he did, with the speed that he did, without appropriate consultation with Ofqual, was irresponsible and children in Wales, not just this year but in the future.</p> </blockquote> <p>Graham Stuart, the Conservative chairman of the committee, said immediately after Gove finished these remarks that he agreed with 95% of them.</p> <p>Andrews explained his decision to order a regrading <a href=\"http://www.newstatesman.com/blogs/politics/2012/09/michael-gove-does-not-own-gcse-brand-we-do\">in a powerful post on the New Statesman blog yesterday. </a>He said that as a result of Gove's decisions the exam system in the UK was fragmenting. \"We will, inevitably now I think, end up with largely separate exam systems in Scotland, Wales, England and Northern Ireland,\" he wrote.</p> <p><strong>\u2022 He implicitly criticised the Lib Dems for refusing to accept that England already has a two-tier qualification system at GCSE.</strong> Gove wants to replace GCSEs with something similar to the old O-level, but <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/blog/2012/sep/03/cameron-cabinet-reshuffle-politics-live1#block-504496d958f956c1a416afa7\">the Lib Dems have been insisting that the single-tier system must be preserved and that there must be no return to the era of O-levels for able children and CSEs for less able children.</a> But Gove said the GCSE was a two-tier qualification.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The truth is that we already have a two-tier qualification system because of this distinction between the foundation and higher tiers ... I\u2019m not sure that many people outside the education world do know that there are two different types of GCSE, one of them the equivalent of the old CSE. You put people in for it, they cannot get better than a C, in the same way as top grade in an old CSE entitled you to an old O-level pass.

  "<p>The United Kingdom is facing forces that are trying to tear it apart. The Scottish nationalists grab most of the attention, but Wales has its own nationalist party, Plaid Cymru, and earlier this year <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/mar/23/leanne-wood-wales-plaid-cymru\" title=\"\">Leanne Wood, a 40-year-old former probation officer, became its first female leader.</a> I interviewed her at the end of last week and these are the highlights.</p> <p><strong>\u2022 Wood said Wales was not ready for independence because it was not self-sufficient economically. </strong>Although Plaid Cymru is committed to independence as a long-term goal, Wood said \"it could not happen tomorrow\" because the Welsh economy was too weak and that it would take \"a lot of work\" to get to the stage where an independent Wales would be financially viable. <a href=\"http://www.clickonwales.org/2012/07/wales-breaks-10000-spending-per-head-barrier/\" title=\"\">(One recent report said that because public spending per head is higher in Wales, and tax receipts per head are lower, Wales has a fiscal deficit of \u00a35,783 per head, compared with \u00a32,000 per head in England.)</a> Wood said Wales had to make up for the fact that its economy had been in decline compared with the rest of the UK for the last 20 years and that giving more economic powers to the Welsh assembly would put the country on the road to recovery.</p> <p><strong>\u2022 She accused Iain Duncan Smith of perpetuating \"negative stereotypes\" about the Welsh. </strong>Referring to his comment about people in Merthyr being unwilling to travel to Cardiff to find work, she said: \"When was the last time he went there and spoke to people from Merthyr?\" She also said that the Welsh in general were still sometimes subject to ridicule because of their nationality and she singled out MTV's show The Valleys as a particularly \"awful\" example of anti-Welsh stereotyping.</p> <p><strong>\u2022 Wood said she could imagine Plaid Cymru being led at some point in the future by someone who did not speak Welsh. </strong>\"I rarely use the Welsh language myself in my day-to-day work, so in some senses you could argue that they already have [a non Welsh-speaking leader],\" said Wood, who is the first person not fluent in Welsh to lead the party.</p> <p><strong>\u2022 She said Wales would benefit if it could become a multilingual nation. </strong>\"We could do an awful lot in Wales if we were eventually a multilingual nation,\" she said. \"There are a number of studies now that suggest that if people have more than one language, their minds are open to learning a third and a fourth and even more languages.\"</p> <p>We met in Wood's office at the Welsh assembly in Cardiff Bay. For me, it's a good place to contemplate long-term change because I started my career on the South Wales Echo in the early 1990s when Cardiff Bay was mostly derelict wasteland next to mudflats. Now there's a barrage, an attractive waterfront, a world-class concert hall and, of course, a mini parliament. Scotland and Wales both voted for devolution 15 years ago this month but nationalism in the two countries is very different. In Cardiff it's slow, and gradualist. Wood is not anticipating, or even demanding, full independence any time soon. But she thinks it will happen eventually. Here's what she had to say. You can decide for yourself whether you think she's right.</p> <h2><strong>Nationalism</strong></h2> <p><strong>Q: Why are you a nationalist?</strong></p> <p>A: I see Wales very much as a country which is not at the moment reaching its full potential. Wales has its own history, its own unique language and is a distinct geographic entitity; to me, it makes sense for it to be a political unit.</p> <h2><strong>Scottish nationalism and Welsh nationalism</strong></h2> <p><strong>Q: Since devolution, Scottish nationalism has done very well, while Welsh nationalism hasn't done so well. What's your explanation for that?</strong></p> <p>A: If you are talking about the success of the national parties, you've got a point. But the Welsh nationalist agenda has progressed quite significantly since the setting up of devolution. What we've seen happening in Wales is that the British parties, the unionist parties, have taken on a lot of the policies that we've been advocating. We advocated the reform of the Barnett formula, measures to defend the Welsh language, for example, and the parties have come on board, on to our territory. There's no difference between the parties on those issues. And the same goes for extending devolution, in terms of the referendum that we won last year. All parties are united around progressing that agenda.</p> <p><strong>Q: But in terms of the party, what went wrong for Plaid over the last few years?</strong></p> <p>A: What's been successful in Scotland was extending a very good settlement that they had to start with. We started from a very different position in Wales; we're obviously a different country. We started with a different devolution settlement. So there was a job of work to do to establish the principle of devolution in Wales, which did not have to happen in Scotland. But if we look at where we are now, we are in a very different place from where we were when devolution was first set up. And certainly now, since the economic crash in 2008, people's problems are very different to the ones that they were back then and, in terms of Wales's economic position, the situation is getting worse. So now we have an opportunity within this current context.</p> <h2><strong>Plaid's leadership</strong></h2> <p><strong>Q: One explanation for why nationalists have done better in Scotland might be that the SNP have got this mega-personality, Alex Salmond, and Plaid have not been able to put up a leader with that sort of charisma. Do you think that has been a factor?</strong></p> <p>A: I tend to think generally that things are mostly about politics and not personalities, to be honest with you, and what we've got to do here in Wales is get to the point where the SNP are in Scotland. And that means we've got to become the biggest party, we have got to be in a position to put these arguments, and then a referendum, to the people of Wales.</p> <h2><strong>Scottish independence referendum</strong></h2> <p><strong>Q: If Scotland were to vote for independence, what impact would that have on electoral politics in Wales and Plaid's position?</strong></p> <p>A: That would have a big impact. It would send shockwaves, really, through the entire system because the United Kingdom as it currently exists would be no more. Then it would be a matter for Wales to decide what role we wanted to have in a newly shaped United Kingdom. And I've advocated a system which looks much more like a partnership of equals so that there is a strong voice for Wales within that. We share an island. There is going to be much common ground between the counties that currently make up the United Kingdom after that eventuality. On what basis will we be working together? That's the kind of conversation I would like people in Wales to have alongside the developments in Scotland.</p> <p><strong>Q: And if Scotland votes no, is that setback for your party and Welsh independence?</strong></p> <p>A: I don't think it has to be necessarily.</p> <p><strong>Q: Why not?</strong></p> <p>A: I would prefer a yes vote to happen in Scotland. But I think there's still a debate to be had about how we govern ourselves and how we look after our own affairs. There is public support in Wales, for example, for more independence in our health service. I would argue, with the economic problems that we've got, more independence is needed in terms of looking at our fiscal levers and what we can do in terms of making changes to the economy that we need to turn it into a successful economy, not a declining one.</p> <h2><strong>Independence</strong></h2> <p><strong>Q: What model of independence are you looking at? Or, to put it another way, how independent would you like Wales to be?</strong></p> <p>A: As far as people in Wales want to go. I am of the view that everything comes back to the economy, that we can't really get to grips with the root problems of our economy unless we have more autonomy and ability to control the levers that affect these things. We have made representations to <a href=\"http://commissionondevolutioninwales.independent.gov.uk/\" title=\"\">the Silk Commission</a> that is looking at the new financial powers that will come to Wales as a result of the various changes that are happening in other parts of the UK and <a href=\"http://www.english.plaidcymru.org/news/2012/02/09/plaid-cymru-publishes-silk-commission-proposals-for-improving-nations-economic-performance/\" title=\"\">we have advocated more independence in terms of our fiscal levers</a> so that we can make those changes that we need to help.</p> <p><strong>Q: But it's sometimes been unclear, at least to me, whether Plaid are going for what they call in Scotland \"devo max\", or whether you want Wales to be a fully independent separate state, with a seat at the UN and passports and everything.</strong></p> <p>A: I've been clear that independence means full membership of the United Nations and everything that goes with that. But we are not in the same place as they are in Scotland and we are not as near to it as they are there. And the reason for that is that we have a declining economy. That has got to be the issue that is addressed first and foremost.</p> <p>I mentioned earlier on that since the economic crisis there is a new layer of problems facing people in Wales. There are a whole host of statistics that show that people in Wales are facing cuts that are worse [than elsewhere in the UK] because the public sector here is greater, and the number of people claiming benefits here is greater. And our unemployment rates are higher, which means that there is more demand on the public purse.</p> <p><strong>Q: Doesn't that then become a drag on the case for independence?</strong></p> <p>A: That's why we have to turn it round. We have to turn that situation around.</p> <p><strong>Q: But if you get independence before you've got a self-financing economy, you're in trouble, aren't you? Before you became leader, who wrote an article saying,</strong><a href=\"http://en.leannewood.com/?p=269\" title=\"\"><strong> \"Most of us who want independence for Wales accept the weak state of the Welsh economy means we would struggle to afford the current Welsh welfare bill.\"</strong></a><strong> So, if you go the independence model that you want, where would the money come from? In Scotland they've got oil.</strong></p> <p>A: This is why I've been clear that it could not happen tomorrow. We have to do a lot of work before we get to the point where we are in a position to do that. But ultimately we can go up to a point so far and then we will be constrained in how successful we will be able to become economically because we won't have the control over the levers that will be able to take us all the way there. All of our effort now has to go into job creation, so we get to a situation where we get more people contributing into the tax pot than there is money going out. That's the basis of any other country in the world. Any independent nation raises what it spends and it is not unreasonable to suggest that Wales could not be any different to any other country in the world, I would contend.</p> <p><strong>Q: So is that a prerequisite for independence? Does the Welsh economy have to get to that state before independence becomes sensible?</strong></p> <p>A: I would not say that's a prerequisite in any way, because ultimately what will decide when and how far we go will be the people of Wales.</p> <p><strong>Q: But the people of Wales are not going to vote for it if does not work economically.</strong></p> <p>A: At the moment there are low numbers of people who support the general idea of independence for Wales because of our economic situation. People understand the importance of prioritising the economy. We have to put that at the front of our agenda. And unless we can answer people's concerns about the Welsh economy then I don't think we are going to win the independence argument.</p> <p><strong>Q: You have said that independence is not something that you would want tomorrow because of these economic problems. So what kind of timescale are we talking about? Are you thinking of decades? It takes decades, or generations, to turn around an economy.</strong></p> <p>A: A report that was published by our newly set-up economy commission, <a href=\"http://www.english.plaidcymru.org/uploads/downloads/Offas_gap.pdf\" title=\"\">a report called Offa's Gap, </a>has shown that the Welsh economy has been in decline relative to the UK economy for the last 20 years. So we have got 20 years' worth of decline to turn around just to get back to where we were in around 1994, 1995.</p> <p><strong>Q: But even then, which was roughly the time I was writing for the Western Mail, Wales was a net dependent, not a net contributor to the UK exchequer. From what you are saying, you seem to suggest it could take 20 years or more to get the economy to a stage where independence becomes viable.</strong></p> <p>A: I would hope that as we gain powers and more control over the economic levers, we would be able to see success faster than we have seen decline. The effort, then, has to go into job creation. We favour new models of companies, for example, so that there would be a big push to support co-operatives and social enterprises. Those sort of companies that we'll set up will employ local people and not then up sticks and move to other parts of the world where labour is cheaper. We've got to think about ways of restructuring our economy so that jobs remain, wealth remains locked into local areas, in a way that has not happened before. So much of the wealth generated in Wales has left in the past. If we learn anything from history, we have to make sure that in the future, when we go back to making things again, that we lock that wealth into Wales and into the pockets of people in Wales.</p> <p><strong>Q: How certain are you that Welsh independence will happen? Are you 100%, bet-your-house-on-it certain that it will happen in your lifetime? Or is it more likely than not?</strong></p> <p>A: I think, to be honest, eventually it's inevitable. People will arrive at the conclusion that we can only really prosper if we do things for ourselves.</p> <p><strong>Q: And are you talking about full-blown independence?</strong></p> <p>A: It's the ability to control our economic destiny that's the key thing for me. People will realise that we can try to work within this system, we can devolve some aspects and make some changes, but ultimately we won't be able to make the leap that we need to make unless we fully control our own economic destiny.</p> <h2><strong>Tax policy </strong></h2> <p><strong>Q: In Scotland, Alex Salmond has suggested that one reason he would like control over taxes is that he can do an Ireland, lower corporation tax and bring investment into the country that way. Would a Plaid Wales be a country with lower rates than England or the rest of the UK?</strong></p> <p>A: We would look at taxation in the round. The debates that are going on within the Silk commission, some tax-raising powers look as though they will be coming to Wales. As I understand it, corporation tax is one of those that is more difficult. This economy commission that I have set up will be coming out with a raft of proposals in terms of taxation policy, so the specifics will have to wait, I'm afraid.</p> <h2><strong>Plaid and the pound</strong></h2> <p><strong>Q: In an independent Wales, would Plaid keep the pound?</strong></p> <p>A: That's a matter for discussion in the runup to the debate on independence. I know that they have got to come down with a view on that in Scotland. We are not in the same place. We don't know where the euro is going, for example, and we don't know what is going to happen to all forms of currency in the future. So I would say let's not put things in tablets of stone in terms of what currency we'd be using.</p> <h2><strong>Defence policy</strong></h2> <p><strong>Q: What about defence? Would an independent Wales have its own armed forces?</strong></p> <p>A: I would like to see a serious reduction in the amount of money we spend on defence in general. I would obviously like to see Wales's share of defence expenditure reduced and spent on useful things. I have said in the past that the amount of money spent subsidising the arms industry is unsustainable and unacceptable as well and that I think huge savings could be made to put into the public services.</p> <h2><strong>BBC</strong> </h2> <p><strong>Q: Would an independent Wales still have the BBC?</strong></p> <p>A: Again, these are matters for people to look at further down the line.</p> <h2><strong>Royal family</strong></h2> <p><strong>Q: And the monarchy. What's the party's position? Would an independent Wales keep the monarchy?</strong></p> <p>A: Our policy is that, after independence, we would put the matter as a question in a referendum to people.</p> <h2><strong>Relations with England after independence</strong></h2> <p><strong>Q: You have talked about the need, in a post-independence settlement, for a relationship with England and Scotland and </strong><a href=\"http://www.english.plaidcymru.org/the-slate/2012/06/29/another-union-is-possible/\" title=\"\"><strong>the idea of a \"neighbourhood of nations\".</strong></a><strong> What do you envisage? Are you just talking about meetings a couple of time a year? Or would the post-UK nations need to set up some kind of supra-national structure to coordinate on immigration and the environment and all the rest of it?</strong></p> <p>A: Yes. I think it would make sense for some kind of body to co-ordinate those big macro issues, and things around the sea, for example, as well. But it would have to be very much on a different basis from the current set up, where, within the Westminster parliament, the needs of England dominate. We would advocate that partnership being much more on the basis of equals.</p> <p>What happens in Scotland will determine where all of this goes. Whatever happens, there is going to be a referendum. Whether the outcome is yes or no, I would argue that there would need to be a conversation about what happens post that referendum.</p> <p><strong>Q: Alex Salmond </strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/jan/25/alex-salmond-hugo-young-lecture\" title=\"\"><strong>in his Hugo Young lecture this year</strong></a><strong> described himself as a \"staunch anglophile\". Are you an anglophile?</strong></p> <p>A: I would not say I'm not an anglophile, specifically. I'm a francophile, I like Spain, I like Scotland.</p> <p><strong>Q: But are you a francophile but not an anglophile?</strong></p> <p>A: I don't have to choose as far as I see it.</p> <p><strong>Q: No, but if you are happy to describe yourself as a francophile are you happy to describe yourself as an anglophile?</strong></p> <p>A: I would like to see myself as somebody who looks to nations all over the world. England would be one of those. But it would not be over and above any others particularly for me.</p> <h2><strong>National identity</strong></h2> <p><strong>Q: Do you think it is sensible to talk about national identity? Is there such a thing as an English national identity and a Scottish national identity and a Welsh national identity?</strong></p> <p>A: I do think there is such a thing. My approach to politics is very much as a civil nationalist. So for me Wales is about who lives here now and what contribution they want to make to building up our communities and our civic body politics, if you like. In a world that is becoming more Coca-Cola or Pepsi or McDonald's or Big Mac, people are going to want to find ways that mark their identity out as a bit different, find aspects of culture that are unusual and quirky, because I think that everything being the same is a bit boring and bland.</p> <p><strong>Q: Ed Miliband gave </strong><a href=\"http://www.politics.co.uk/comment-analysis/2012/06/07/ed-miliband-s-englishness-speech-in-full\" title=\"\"><strong>a speech earlier this year on Englishness</strong></a><strong> and he identified \"quiet determination in the face of adversity\" as a particular English trait, or the essence of Englishness. What's the essence of Welshness?</strong></p> <p>A: In terms of what's at the essence of Welsh politics, I would say that there is a public service ethos, that there is a want for politics to be done on a more co-operative basis and for the reduction of inequalities to be centred as part of our politics. The centre of gravity of Welsh politics is much nearer to those values than it is in the UK as a whole.</p> <h2><strong>Discrimination against the Welsh</strong></h2> <p><strong>Q: In </strong><a href=\"http://en.leannewood.com/?page_id=123\" title=\"\"><strong>one of the articles you wrote during your leadership campaign</strong></a><strong> you talked about the Welsh still being victims of discrimination and how it was acceptable to ridicule the Welsh? Can you give me some examples of that?</strong></p> <p>A: Jeremy Clarkson. Anne Robinson. Various snipes and jibes about the Welsh language that happen on a fairly regular basis. Then, when people complain about them, they are told that they are being over-sensitive. Those kinds of things really. I don't want to particularly dwell on those aspects because we get accused of whingeing about irrelevant things. But I do get a sense sometimes that there are some nationalities in the world, some groups of people, where it is still acceptable to ridicule on the basis that they are of a particular nationality. And, thankfully, in many other areas of life that has become unacceptable. But there is still a hangover of some being left. I think we need to move on from that.</p> <p><strong>Q: How do you feel about the way the way the Welsh are portrayed on TV? There was a Valleys comedy, Stella, on recently. Or Gavin and Stacey? Do you have a problem with those?</strong></p> <p>A: No. There's a bit of humour there. We can all laugh and enjoy programmes like that. I would be more critical of <a href=\"http://www.mtv.co.uk/shows/the-valleys\" title=\"\">the latest MTV attempt to show the Valleys</a>.</p> <p><strong>Q: I haven't seen that.</strong></p> <p>A: Don't go there. It's awful. But they tried to pluck young people out of the sleepy hamlet of the Valleys and put them in the big bright lights of Cardiff.</p> <p><strong>Q: That's one of these reality programmes.</strong></p> <p>A: It's that sort of programme. There have been lots of sheep in the publicity shots, so I can guess where that's going.</p> <p>There have been a lot of negative stereotypes out there. A lot of them have been pushed by the Conservative party, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-11605318\" title=\"\">like Iain Duncan Smith when he went to Merthyr and said people don't want to travel from Merthyr to Cardiff</a>, really stereotyping. When was the last time he went there and spoke to people from Merthyr? There are plenty of people I know who would travel, and do travel, an awful long way to find work but there isn't work out there for them. But I don't particularly want to contribute to further accusations of us just whingeing and not being able to take a joke.</p> <h2><strong>Plaid and the Welsh language</strong></h2> <p>Q: I posted<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/2012/sep/06/ask-plaid-cymru-leanne-wood?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\"> a blog inviting people to suggest questions to ask you</a> and there were quite a few comments from people [like <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/18110465\" title=\"\">showmaster</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/18111334\" title=\"\">Temulkar</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/18114609\" title=\"\">yahyah</a>] saying they were put off Plaid by the sense that it was a party only for Welsh speakers. Do you accept that's a problem for the party?</p> <p>A: I would argue that nobody is excluded from Plaid Cymru and we seek to defend the rights of Welsh-language speakers in the same context as we seek to defend the rights of other minorities who experience discrimination. So for us it's an equalities issue and an issue about rights. But the idea that people would feel excluded from being part of Plaid Cymru would concern me, to be honest. It is never something that I've felt. I've learnt Welsh and I am still in the process of learning Welsh. I can't call myself fluent in it unfortunately yet. But certainly I have never felt any discrimination on the grounds of not being a fluent Welsh speaker.</p> <p><strong>Q: But this is what</strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/18115528\" title=\"\"><strong> one woman</strong></a><strong> said: \"It put me off joining Plaid, which I seriously considered, when it was made clear that although they will try and accommodate English speakers, they prefer to communicate in Welsh at my local meetings.\" She also said: \"The feeling among a lot of people I've spoken to here is that Plaid have some good policies, but despite the nice words about inclusivity in the Plaid manifesto, on the ground there tends to be a narrow-minded, insular, corrupt anti-incomer mindset.\" Other people said similar things. Why is that perception out there?</strong></p> <p>A: In some communities there are tensions where people are perceived to have lots of money, they move in and buy up inflated-priced properties. It could be a reflection of some of those tensions within communities. But generally I would encourage people like that to contact me directly so I can have a private conversation about where these problems are arising because I am really keen to ensure that Plaid Cymru is a party open to everybody, whichever part of Wales they are in.</p> <p><strong>Q: Can you ever imagine Plaid being led by somebody who did not speak Welsh?</strong></p> <p>A: Well, yes I can. I rarely use the Welsh language myself in my day to day work, so in some senses you could argue that they already have. I'm trying to learn and one of the reasons is political. I would say for many people in Plaid Cymru who are not first language Welsh speakers, we want to learn. But, equally, there are plenty of people who are members who are not learning. And that is fine. I would say there's no pressure to learn the language.</p> <p><strong>Q: </strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/discussion/comment-permalink/18110141\" title=\"\"><strong>One person</strong></a><strong> raised education as an issue in the context of this. He or she said: \"I am a welsh speaker but you must realise that statements from you, that all children in Wales will be taught partly through the medium of Welsh, are disastrous and instantly destroy support in non-Welsh speaking Wales.\" What do you say to that?</strong></p> <p>A: I'm not convinced that this would put people off. I come at this from an education perspective, in that I think we could do an awful lot in Wales if we were eventually a multilingual nation. There are a number of studies now that suggest that if people have more than one language, their minds are open to learning a third and a fourth and even more languages. And that minds are open to other subjects as well. So, in terms of a new approach in schools to look at becoming multilingual eventually, then to start with the two that we've got here, and then introducing a third and maybe a fourth later on within the school curriculum, we should be able to create a multilingual population which would give us an economic advantage in the future.</p> <p><strong>Q: You've talked about language as a discrimination issue. Are there any circumstances where people who do not speak Welsh are facing discrimination in Wales because they apply for jobs where Welsh is a requirement?</strong></p> <p>A: I have not seen any evidence of that. The accusation is often mentioned, but I have not seen any evidence of people being barred from getting jobs. If you think of language as another skill, for some jobs you have to have a certain skill set to apply for those jobs. You would not apply for a job as a data entry clerk if you could not use computers.</p>",
  "<p>The people of Manchester Central have before them a unique opportunity to pass judgement not just on the state of their constituency, but on the state of Britain and our democracy as a whole. </p> <p>In electoral terms Manchester Central is perhaps most noticeable for having the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/constituency/1111/manchester-central\">lowest turnout</a> of any constituency at the last election, so whilst it appears a staunch Labour seat, this doesn't seem an attachment held with any great enthusiasm (unsurprising given the levels of deprivation that remain even after 13 years of Labour rule.) </p> <p>This voting history is undoubtedly also an indication of the wider malaise in British democracy and a result of the lack of any viable alternative.

No doubt I will be attacked as a carpet-bagger, but despite this I'm pretty sure what the major concerns of local electors are, and they aren't copyright law reform, unilateral nuclear disarmament or defending the Iranian Revolution. Indeed, there are few things more tragic than middle-class, left-liberal, 'intellectuals' attempting to speak for the northern working classes.</p> <p>What concerns the people of Manchester, and ordinary people across the north of England, are unemployment, crime, lack of opportunity, housing, drugs, family breakdown and, yes, mass immigration. </p> <p>On immigration in particular, they want to be able to raise genuine and legitimate concerns about the effect of this on jobs, wages and their local communities without immediately being denounced by Labour and the liberal-left as 'bigoted'.</p> <p>The PDP shares such concerns, and understands they are concerns based on resources, not race.</p> <p>We believe the people of the north are crying out for an alternative to the tired, failed, and patronising politics of a Labour Party now staffed by career politicians with little understanding of the real world.
