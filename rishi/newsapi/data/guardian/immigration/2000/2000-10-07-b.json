  "<p>It happened gradually. To begin with, 25 years ago, I was in a caf\u00e9 by Vienna's Ringstrasse, and I asked the waitress whether the fish of the day was a seafish or a river fish. \"Alas,\" she said, \"Here in Austria we have no seafish!\" That melancholy reply still haunts me. A huge empire - once it stretched from Trieste on the Adriatic, to Mostar deep in the Southern Balkans to Constantia on the Black Sea to Brody on the borders with Tsarist Russia - had been reduced to a little land-locked rump. So a compulsion was born - to cross the empire that used to be, from its gleaming centre to its dusty borderlands. </p> <p>I read novels, essays, history books - anything to conjure up those vanished kingdoms. Most of all, I read the sad ironic fiction of Joseph Roth. He described the muddy scrubby lands on the fringes of the Empire of Franz Joseph, where civilised society dissolved and young officers drank and gambled and whored away their days. </p> <p>That decided me. One day I would take trains through Transylvania and drink coffee in grubby caf\u00e9s across the road from stuffy yellow railway stations and crumbling opera houses. </p> <p>It was another 20 years before I set off on my journey, and during the intermission the Iron Curtain had crumbled and the nations and federations which replaced the Habsburg Empire had themselves disintegrated. My travels took me from Vienna, through the Slovenian Alps to Trieste and then down through former Yugoslavia to Zagreb, Sarajevo and Mostar. That was the Western Empire, much of it acquired as late as the early 1900s. </p> <p>Then I headed back to Hungary and crossed the Puszta - the great plain - to Romanian Transylvania and Bukovina, deep in the southern Carpathian mountains. My goal was Joseph Roth's birthplace of Brody, now in western Ukraine. </p> <p>As Kaiser Franz Joseph built most of the railways, I thought it only polite to travel by train. The railway networks of central Europe have had a rough time over the past century. It is a miracle that you can plot journeys through the 11 countries that once made up a single empire and still feel confident that the trains will arrive and depart on time. When the lines were built, there was no such state as Yugoslavia, Romania stopped at the Danube and Ukraine was either Russian, Polish or Austrian. </p> <p>The first world war was midwife to all these new nations and the second put most of them behind the Iron Curtain. However, for all the recent upheavals, the Thomas Cook red railway timetable only let me down once, and the Deutsche Bahn website came up trumps every time. I booked my passage as far as Zagreb through Deutsche Bahn, but the website refused to recognise Sarajevo, which is scarcely surprising as all the lines were mined or blown up during the Yugoslav war. If you care to take it, there's a daily rust bucket from the unfashionable end of Zagreb airport. The day I was due to travel, the plane was full so I hitched a lift with the United Nations, who have had a quiet time since the end of hostilities in Kosovo. </p> <p>Deutsche Bahn also had difficulty with Chernivtsi, just over the border between Romania and Ukraine, cut off by the Carpathians, but once a handsome Habsburg regional capital with architecture to equal the grandest towns in provincial Austria. It was once an extraordinary mix of Romanians, Ukrainians, Poles, Germans and Jews, but nearly all the non-Ukrainians were wiped out in the second world war and the purges. The timetables are strictly Ukrainian and insist you take a huge detour via Lviv in the north. I arrived from Transylvania in the south east. </p> <p>As it happens, there is a train across the Carpathians, but it takes seven hours to travel 100km. The reason for this is simple. Chernivtsi was Habsburg Chernovitz until 1918 and Romanian Cernauti until 1945. Then the Soviet Union grabbed it as part of the Ukrainian Socialist Republic and replaced the standard railway tracks with Russian broad gauge ones. So there is a three-hour wait at the border to lift up the carriages and slide in a new set of wheels. </p> <p>Readers of Olivia Manning's Balkan trilogy, not to mention Agatha Christie, have romantic expectation of these trains. They certainly have splendid names, but that is the only grand thing about them. I went to Zagreb on the Geneva-Simplon-Venice-Trieste-Zagreb express. It averaged 60 miles an hour, and all I could order for lunch was warm beer and peanuts. </p> <p>By the time I reached Romania, the plastic upholstery was torn, the windows were broken, and that was after I had upgraded to first class. Chickens wandered along the tracks and dogs took the word sleeper literally and curled up between the rails. </p> <p>However, railway travel was only a by-product of my quest. Early on, I promised myself that I would drink a cup off coffee in every provincial capital of the old Empire. Coffee houses were the social embodiment of the imperial principle. The western empire certainly has some splendid watering holes. If you want to have the best of both worlds, drink a cup of Italian coffee in the Viennese Caffee San Marco in Trieste, which has not only won the gold medal of the Society of Austrian Coffee Houses, but is also home from home for Trieste's finest writer Claudio Magris. </p> <p>In Zagreb, the coffee has a more political colour. Just off the central square is Charlie's Caf\u00e9, a gathering place for the political intelligentsia for the past three decades from Tito's regime, through the war to the present day. </p> <p>To the South and east, the standard of coffee drops significantly. In Sarajevo, despite the survival of the brave little Caf\u00e9 Imperial which held out throughout the terrible shelling, you will drink better coffee in the Muslim bazaar on the east side of town. </p> <p>Cluj, the capital of Transylvania, was a Hungarian town before the first war and transferred to Romania after Austria's defeat. Ceaucescu drove out much of the Hungarian population and bussed in droves of Romanians. </p> <p>Life is far from easy for Transylvania's Hungarians, but their pride and generosity and the depth of their culture belies their struggle. They have much to be proud of, and the Habsburg grandeur of Cluj is only one example. </p> <p>In the south of the province are the splendid Siebenburgen, seven towns built by earlier German speakers in the 12th century. Most visited is Sighishoara, birthplace of Vlad Dracul, the father of Vlad the Impaler. Although its fairytale towers have nothing to do with vampires or Bram Stoker, who never visited the country, the temptation for tour companies is too great and poor Vlad Dracul's house has been turned into a restaurant serving steak and chips to busloads of Spanish tourists. </p> <p>Better go north as I did, to the remote Carpathian villages of Maramures where traditional customs, dress, architecture and music are miraculously preserved. With the courteous assistance of tour guide Dan Comanescu (Nord Nord-Vest Bvd, Republicii 15/2, Baia Mare, Maramures, Romania, tel: 0040 62 226508), we were invited to a wedding in the distant hill village of Ieaud, where the bridesmaid's hair was platted with leaves and flowers and white-smocked men and bell-skirted women danced to fiddle music that had not changed since B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k composed it a century ago. </p> <p>The same is true for much of the former Eastern Empire. Centuries of geographical isolation and 50 years of communism protected it, for good or ill, from most of the 20th century. With the help of the conscientious Iryna Zub and her travel company West-Show (Office 5, 1/3 Svobody Avenue, 79000 Lviv, Ukraine, tel: 00 380 322 723 451), you will find a culture in the cities of western Ukraine which has already been erased in Vienna and Prague and is rapidly disappearing in Budapest. </p> <p>This will certainly appeal if you are nostalgic for the grim discourtesy of the old Soviet Union. Arriving at the Hotel Kiyiv in Ukrainian Chernivtsi, I was asked to pay in advance for a room with a broken bed and without toilet paper, hot water or breakfast. I immediately upgraded to the Hotel Cheremosh, which had water between 7 pm and 11 pm, a few sheets of toilet paper and was supposedly the best hotel in town. But this was a small price to pay for access to a vanished world. </p> <p><strong> Best hotels</strong><br> </p> <p> <strong> Pension Suzanne</strong> </p> <p>Walfischgasse 4, A1010, Vienna, Austria <br> <strong> Tel:</strong> 00 431 513 250 70 <strong> Fax:</strong> 00 431 513 25 00 </p> <p>An excellent, comfortable pension, two minutes walk from the opera \u00a355 - \u00a365 for a double room. </p> <p><strong> Hotel Teatro</strong> </p> <p>Capo di Piazza 1, Trieste, Italy<br> <strong> Tel:</strong> 00 39 040 366 220 <strong> Fax:</strong> 00 39 040 366 220 </p> <p>Two minutes from the sea and the opera house - \u00a330 approx for a double. </p> <p><strong> Hotel Erzsebet</strong> </p> <p>Karolyi Mihaly U. 11-15, H-1053 Budapest, Hungary<br> <strong> Tel:</strong> 00 361 328 5700 <strong> Fax: </strong> 00 361 328 5763 </p> <p>Budapest has become very expensive - Erzsebet in central Pest at about \u00a350 is as good a bet as any. </p> <p><strong> Hotel George (Zhorzh)</strong> </p> <p>1A.

  "To my mind the loveliest structure in Berlin is not the Brandenburg Gate, nor even the artfully remodelled Reichstag, but the ravishingly exotic gold-and-black dome of the synagogue on Oranienburgerstrasse. <p>Many visitors, I imagine, see it as a symbol of defiance: a shining beacon to tell the world that even here, in the city that gave birth to the Final Solution, there is still a testimonial Jewish presence. </p> <p>Until a few years ago that was indeed the case. No more than a few thousand Jews chose to remain in Berlin after 1945 and over the years their numbers crept up but slowly. </p> <p>Today, however, if the dome of the synagogue stands for anything it is not so much survival as revival. In the past 10 years Berlin's Jewish population has doubled to 12,000 as Jews have flooded in from the former Soviet Union, where open anti-semitism is rife. </p> <p>Their immigration is encouraged by the German government. Applicants receive preferential treatment similar to that given to ethnic Germans. </p> <p>The authorities would like nothing better than to see the Jewish community rebuilt, undoing one of the main effects of the Holocaust. And, for the moment, they are getting their way. </p> <p>Implausible as it may seem, Germany now has the world's fastest-growing Jewish community and the third-biggest in Europe, numbering about 85,000. </p> <p>This week, however, their leader, Paul Spiegel, asked an extraordinary question: whether it is all worth it? whether, to use his exact words, \"It is right for Jews to stay in Germany\"? </p> <p>What prompted him to voice his doubt was a string of outrages coinciding with some of the holiest days in the Jewish calender. </p> <p>It began here in Berlin last Saturday, when two naked men tried to disrupt a service for Rosh Hashana, the Jewish new year. </p> <p>The latest incident occurred on Thursday night when stones were thrown at a synagogue in the Kreuzberg district of the city, breaking two windows. In between, a synagogue in D\u00fcsseldorf was attacked and a Jewish cemetery in Potsdam defiled. </p> <p>Underlying the gloom imbuing Mr Spiegel's remarks is the fact that none of this is particularly unusual. The D\u00fcsseldorf incident earned attention because it took place as Germans were preparing to celebrate the 10th anniversary of reunification. But, according to the police, there are on average seven anti-semitic incidents every four days. </p> <p>The politicians' invariable reaction to such outbreaks is to call for more \"civil courage\". The chancellor, Gerhard Schr\u00f6der, who visited the D\u00fcsseldorf synagogue on Wednesday, used the occasion to declare: \"There can be no more looking away.\" </p> <p>But whether that historically resonant approach addresses the true nature of the problem is questionable. A couple of peculiarities stand out. One is that, whereas attacks on immigrants are concentrated in the formerly communist east, anti-semitic incidents are more evenly distributed. The other is that the number of incidents is out of all proportion to the strength of the German far right. </p> <p>It would suggest that either an anti-Jewish feeling lingers among many more Germans than are ready to vote for a return to the past or other factors are at work. The potential for publicity is an obvious candidate. An attack on a prominent Jewish site in Germany is guaranteed a notoriety far beyond the degree of violence employed. </p> <p>Not that any of that matters much to Germany's Jews. For them, normal life will not be possible while their memorials, schools, cemeteries and places of worship are under constant siege. For as long as Jews cannot live a normal life in Germany, the revival of Jewish life in Germany will be in jeopardy.</p>",
  "<p>A decade ago Timothy Mo left London for a short trip to east Asia. Since then, the thrice Booker-shortlisted author has spent no more than five months in Britain. \"At 20 I thought I'd live the rest of my life here,\" he says. \"But England isn't the centre any more. What's interesting about these times, and what I write about, is the clash of cultures, the war of civilisations.\" </p> <p>Mo, whose Cantonese father and English mother moved from Hong Kong to London when he was 10, was hailed as a rising literary star of the 1980s alongside Martin Amis, Salman Rushdie and Kazuo Ishiguro. His debut after Oxford, The Monkey King (1978), was a post-war Hong Kong comedy of manners, whose Mr Poon, with his gold stashed up a chimney, was modelled on Mo's grandfather - \"the only person I ever put absolutely from life in a novel\". His next novel, Sour Sweet (1982), trawled Hong Kong migrant life in Soho's Chinatown, and in An Insular Possession (1986), he looked at deeper Anglo-Chinese conflict in 19th-century Hong Kong. </p> <p>In his house in Holland Park, Mo says he finds Britain \"antiseptic - a slow, safe, orderly society\", and is more interested in societies \"glowing with decay ... I feel so much more at home in an Asian street: people smile, everybody's about my size - that was obviously nagging at me subliminally\". Each year he spends \"three months in Hong Kong; four split between Bangkok and Phnom Penh; and five in the Philippines\", travelling with his Filipina partner, Lisa, and their seven-year-old daughter, Marie. </p> <p>His fictional terrain has expanded partly through an evolving intimacy with Asia. The Redundancy of Courage (1991), on Indonesian genocide and guerrilla resistance in a veiled East Timor, was shortlisted for the Booker, as were his previous two novels. But it shocked some critics in abandoning what one termed \"quaint ethnic vignettes\" for \"violent polemic\". Mo attributes his leap to growing confidence, rejecting the pressure to \"stay in my box\". </p> <p>A former amateur bantam-weight boxer and fight reporter with an abiding passion for diving, he was perhaps too neatly accused of pugnacity when attacked for self-publishing his fifth novel, Brownout on Breadfruit Boulevard (1995). A Swiftian, scatological satire on corruption in the Philippines, it came out from his own Paddleless Press. Hectored for demanding inflated advances, he talked of \"casting pearls before swine\", but he has no regrets. \"I jumped before I was pushed. Multinationals will just stop publishing literary fiction. I'll never go back to being published by anyone else.\" </p> <p>His sixth and most recent novel, Renegade or Halo 2, which won the James Tait Black memorial prize, also opens in the Philippines, in the Marcos era, but grows into a 20th-century migrant's picaresque, spanning Asia, the Gulf emirates and Cuba, via Plaistow. Packed with action - much of it chillingly brutal - it is propelled less by plot than by sizzling prose. </p> <p>In its vivid tales of boat people and stowaways, the novel suggests first-hand experience of a global underclass of migrants - often the detritus of empire - who live several lifetimes in one. \"I've had to knock around with people who live strange zig-zag lives and have been marooned by the tide,\" says Mo. \"Seamen, domestics, boxers - people very much of this time.\" While Sour Sweet was compared to Dickens, Renegade nods to the \"ghosts of Fielding and Sterne\". </p> <p>Like the author, Renegade 's picaro, Rey Castro, embodies a collision of genes and histories. The Jesuit-educated, \"African-American-Filipino\" offspring of a bar girl and a black serviceman from the US naval base, he feels \"out of context\" everywhere. Yet he calls himself after a multicoloured local dessert, halo-halo: \"ingredients that shouldn't belong together but work when you combine them [like] candied napalm\". </p> <p>Mo himself feels \"mixed\" only in his work. \"If I'm with English people, I feel a little white man, while with my Chinese family I feel an Asian. But as a novelist, the parts have combined.\" Renegade 's compelling comic voice fuses American slang with pinoy patois and the Tagalog hybrid \"Taglish\". </p> <p>While Renegade won critical praise, it apparently split last year's Booker judges, the women refusing to countenance it on the shortlist, not least for a graphic rape-murder by Filipino fraternity \"Frat Brods\" in which Rey is uneasily complicit. Mo defends the scene as a \"regular occurrence, where rich sons of powerful people get together and rape, often murder, a poor girl; it's not just my warped imagination. I'm interested in moral dilemmas: the cultural imperative is you stick by your group, which Rey does but is haunted by it; [the girl's] ghost haunts the novel\". The book, he adds, is \"a critique of social culture; it's a weakness of south-east Asian societies that the rich should be able to abuse the poor\". </p> <p>Some thought the novel marred by provocative stereotypes - the pilfering Filipino, the lubricious Cubana. \"I'm not frightened of the word stereotype,\" says Mo. \"It's a survival blueprint: groups behave in predictable ways. But it's important to have an open mind and be ready to modify your opinion. Race and cultural differences are a great 20th-century taboo. But it is possible to make value judgments.\" </p> <p>While the author-publisher frets that \"the days of the physical book are numbered\", he says: \"Some say I don't have a natural readership for my themes. But I console myself I will years from now: there'll be more halo-halos like myself.\" </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,501190357,00.htm\">Buy Brownout on Breadfruit Boulevard at BOL</a><br>501190357</p>",
  "Or, as you're more likely to say, make mine a mojito, Cuba libre or daiquiri. Havana Club is the rum to use in these classic Cuban cocktails rather than the super-bland Bacardi, which is no longer made on the island. In fact, El Presidente himself endorses the brand. The basic rum to use is the lightly oak-aged Havana Club three-year-old (\u00a313.69 from larger Sainsbury's stores and Oddbins - that's about four times as much as it costs in Havana, but there you go). <p>Quick Cuban cocktail lesson: to make a mojito, crush a few mint leaves with half a teaspoon of sugar, add a generous slug of Havana Club three-year-old, the juice of half a lime and top up with ice and soda. To make a daiquiri, leave out the mint and soda, and shake the rum, lime juice and sugar over ice. Cuba libre? Lots of ice: one part Havana Club to four parts cola, plus a good squeeze of lime. After that, just download a couple of Ibrahim Ferrer tracks on to your MP3, get out that Hemingway and chill.</p>"
