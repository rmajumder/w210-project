  "Britain's trade unions yesterday urged the government to end the \"humiliating and stigmatising\" system of food vouchers for asylum seekers and to relax the stringent conditions forced on refugees. <p>Bill Morris, Transport Union leader and self-proclaimed son of a Jamaican economic migrant, denounced the voucher system after accompanying Pedram, an Iranian asylum seeker, on his weekly shop in central Glasgow. </p> <p>Pedram, a 30-year-old GP and religious refugee from Tehran who entered Britain in June, has been surviving on \u00a326.34 in food vouchers and \u00a310 in cash a week and on charities. </p> <p>\"I am single but many of my friends are married and some are being forced to live on even less than I get,\" he said. \"They wonder whether they should leave Glasgow and get a job on the black market in London in order to survive.\" </p> <p>Displaying the cheap, \"value\" goods in his shopping bag, some of them reduced because they were close to their sell-by date, he said the vouchers put a barrier between asylum seekers and the rest of the community. </p> <p>\"Sooner or later we will be members of the community so we have got to know the rules, especially as we tend to come from non-democratic countries ... we don't seek people's mercy but just their help and we don't deserve their hatred and contempt which this system of vouchers intensifies.\" </p> <p>Mr Morris, who later electrified the congress with a call to stamp out racism, including within unions, condemned the system under which asylum seekers got no change from their vouchers. </p> <p>He also criticised the system whereby refugees got \u00a38 in exchange for a \u00a310 voucher on the black market. \"Whoever dreamed up the voucher system should be forced to live on it for a year.\" </p> <p>He said: \"We have got a government which is subsidising Tesco, Asda and Sainsbury's, and that's not the redistribution of wealth I voted for on May 1 1997. This voucher system degrades our humanity and should be scrapped now.\" </p> <p>Jonathan Ellis, an Oxfam campaigns manager, said: \"It is outrageous that supermarkets are allowed to make a profit from one of the most vulnerable groups in our society.\" </p> <p>Mr Morris said Pedram (not his real name) could not afford to buy fresh fruit and vegetables, relying instead on tinned goods. At the check-out he was constantly looking over his shoulder to see who was watching him. \"The staff try to be friendly but this system is inherently stigmatising.\" </p> <p>Nick Hardwick, chief executive of the British Refugee Council, said: \"Every single day, asylum seekers are ringing us describing incidents of harassment and racism, children bullied at school, people being beaten up, houses being fire-bombed.\" </p> <p>Later, delegates were warned by John Monks, TUC general secretary, that they had a mountain to climb to combat racism within their own ranks. They reacted with shame and disgust as actors from the Theatre Royal, Stratford East, east London, read out harrowing accounts of discrimination given over the TUC's racism hotline. </p> <p>Mr Morris, introducing a motion condemning opposition leaders for fanning the flames of racism and demanding government action to abandon provisions of the 1999 Immigration and Asylum Act, won a standing ovation for his impassioned plea for the government to give asylum seekers full human rights and to work for a greater understanding of the plight of refugees. </p> <p>\"When I hear the words bogus and flooding it sends a shiver down my spine. When I hear the words economic migrant, I think of my mother who came to Britain 46 years ago after the death of my father. </p> <p>\"She was an economic migrant. We were a family of economic migrants. As I look back I hope we have contributed more than we have taken from our great country,\" he said. </p> <p>Glenroy Watson, a London Underground worker and RMT rail union delegate, said he was an economic migrant too. \"My mother didn't come here for the lovely weather but to improve her standard of living - and human beings have the right to seek improvement.\" </p> <p>The TGWU-led motion, which the union is to submit to Labour's annual conference later this month, demands the scrapping of the plan to impose a \u00a310,000 bond on those seeking UK entry from certain countries as \"morally wrong and inherently racist\".</p>",
  "The first trials in China's biggest corruption scandal began yesterday under a veil of secrecy intended to minimising the Communist leadership's embarrassment. <p>Court officers in Fujian province confirmed that proceedings had begun in the 50bn yuan (about \u00a34bn) smuggling case believed to involve up to 600 government officials, several of whom are likely to be sentenced to death.</p> <p>Some of the key figures in the scandal have fled overseas and there is widespread scepticism that others, who have close links to the leadership in Beijing, will be charged.</p> <p>The case centres on the smuggling of fuel, tobacco, cigarettes and rubber by the Yuanhua Group of Hong Kong, in cooperation with corrupt police, customs and party officials.</p> <p>The court building in Xiamen, one of the five centres where the trials are being held, was closed to everyone without official passes yesterday, including most of the court staff, in an effort to keep the proceedings secret.</p> <p>Internet chatrooms were buzzing with discussion of one of the country's biggest news stories of the year, but the mainland media were warned not to report the case without official approval.</p> <p>A duty officer at another court, in Zhangzhou, said it seemed \"very mysterious\".</p> <p>\"I heard that if they tried one person a day they would never get through this case in a year,\" a resident of Xiamen, Chen Changjian, said.</p> <p>So far the courts have confirmed very few prosecutions: six in Xiamen and a further 12 in Putian. They include Cao Xinghai, general manager of the Orient Group in Fujian, which is accused of providing the smugglers with trading documents in return for a nearly \u00a32m annual payoff.</p> <p>The head of Yuanhua, Lai Changqing, who is alleged to have spent heavily on official protection, fled China before he could be arrested and took refuge in either Burma or Canada, according to Hong Kong press reports. The deputy mayor of Xiamen, Lan Fu, reportedly made it to Australia.</p> <p>Other suspects seem to enjoy the protection of powerful patrons. When website reports linked the Beijing Communist party chief and politburo member Jia Jinglin, who is politically close to President Jiang Zemin, to the corruption investigation, the state propaganda machine was quick to clear him.</p> <p>There is no sign of any of the senior officials detained, including a former head of military intelligence, General Ji Shengde, and the immigration chief, Xu Ganlu, being brought to trial. There are unconfirmed reports that Beijing has decided to limit the political fallout by focusing on middle-rank provincial officials.</p> <p>Beijing has launched a highly publicised crackdown on corruption in recent months. President Jiang said it represents a \"life and death\" struggle for the party.</p> <p>In July a former vice-chairman of parliament, Cheng Kejie became the most senior official ever to be sentenced to death, and yesterday the state media reported that a corrupt cadre in Sichuan province had also been condemned.</p> <p>The Beijing Youth Daily predicted this week that 10 more would be executed after the latest trials. Other reports suggest that only four will face the death penalty, including a former Xiamen customs chief and a former provincial deputy director of police.</p> <p>Such an outcome will only increase the popular suspicion in China that lower-level officials are being made the scapegoats for the crimes of more senior leaders politically too well connected to be brought to justice.</p> <p>Nevertheless there is hope in Fujian that the trials will finally let the relatively prosperous province, which has benefited greatly from closer economic links with Taiwan, put away the scandal that has tainted its name.</p> <p>\"One thing I would like to stress is that Xiamen is not relying on smuggling to get rich,\" the city's new deputy mayor, Chen Conghui, said yesterday.</p> <p>\"If you cut off a branch infected with insects the health of the whole tree improves.\"</p>",
  "<b> Health service</b> <br> Alan Milburn, the health secretary, said the fuel blockade was hitting the NHS hard. \"Operations are being cancelled. Drugs, food and medical supplies are now running short. The NHS is increasingly unable to do its job properly,\" he said. <p>His department published a list of pressures on health and social services affecting every part of England. Central blood stocks will last four days. Critical points are currently Oxford and Southampton where collections are down 40%, a spokesman said. </p> <p>In the northern and Yorkshire region, the Royal Hull hospital ran out of stitches for use in operations and Dewsbury health care trust cancelled elective admissions for the rest of the week. South Tyneside and Friarage hospitals said they had serious difficulty removing clinical waste. </p> <p>In the south-east of England, hospitals said patients were cancelling appointments because of transport difficulties. Portsmouth's pharmacies were reduced to two days' supplies and Surrey's petrol-driven ambulances were expected to stay on the road for no more than 24 hours. </p> <p>Hospitals in Portsmouth were running short of drugs, particularly for renal dialysis. All elective surgery was cancelled in Milton Keynes and West Kent said problems in removal of clinical waste would soon be a health hazard. </p> <p>In the south-west, hospitals reported increased numbers of 12-hour trolley waits for patients. Many trusts said they had only two days supplies of linen left. Avon and Western Wiltshire mental healthcare trust will run out today. </p> <p>Cornwall health authority said it had three days of food left, 36 hours of laundry and oxygen was becoming scarce. United Bristol healthcare trust cancelled cardiac operations because staff could not get in to work. Across the region, beds were not becoming free because patients were not being discharged. </p> <p>In the West Midlands, Hereford, Worcestershire, Shropshire and Staffordshire declared the situation a \"major incident\". The Royal Shrewsbury hospital said it would run out of food by the end of the week. Cancellation of elective surgery was imminent. </p> <p>North of the border, the Scottish ambulance service was preparing to refuse to respond to all non-emergency calls. </p> <p>Across London, non-urgent outpatient appointments were cancelled. Guy's and St Thomas's stopped discharging patients living outside the capital. </p> <p>In the north-west, Wigan ambulance service ran out of fuel. Hospitals in Wigan, Leigh and Morecambe Bay cancelled non-emergency operations. North Mersey warned that community nursing would not be available by the end of the week tomorrow. [John Carvel]</p> <p> <b> Food</b><br> The supermarket chain Safeway was prompted to introduce rationing of bread and milk at its stores as customers continued to clear the shelves of staple items. </p> <p>Store managers were limiting purchases because they had seen evidence of increased demand for bread and milk. The amount of rationing varied from store to store at the discretion of the manager, according to a spokeswoman. </p> <p>However, deliveries were still getting through and in many cases, rationing was lifted as soon as new supplies arrived. </p> <p>Panic buying continued in shops and supermarkets across the country as it emerged that fresh food could run out by the weekend. </p> <p>Staff at Asda, which has 240 stores around the UK, said customers were buying more bread and milk than usual, but fresh food deliveries were continuing to reach its stores. </p> <p>If there were any gaps on the shelves, it was because customers were buying more food than normal. </p> <p>But food distributors Eddie Stobart, based in Carlisle, said that 700 of its 1,000 trucks had now run out of fuel. The company carries out 1,000 deliveries a day to supermarkets and said it could no longer guarantee food deliveries. </p> <p>Dale Foster, transport director of the company, said: \"We have been in touch with our fuel suppliers and we don't know when the next delivery is coming. We have very little left and will decide what deliveries take priority. </p> <p>\"We will be able to deliver supermarket supplies and other priority deliveries, but we will still be losing hundreds of thousands of pounds each day.\" </p> <p>Customers appeared to be clearing the shelves of smaller stores as well as supermarkets. Grocery chain Spar, which has 2,700 shops in the UK, said food sales had increased by 300% in recent days. The Food and Drink Federation said that many of its members had contingency supplies of raw materials and fuel. \"These measures should enable most manufacturers to carry on producing the nation's food for some time, but it is imperative that government resolve this crisis as soon as possible,\" said a spokeswoman. [Helen Carter] </p> <p> <b> Post offices and banks</b><br> Mail deliveries are already facing disruption while banks could run out of cash next week if the fuel shortage escalates. </p> <p>The Post Office yesterday sounded alarm bells over its ability to continue delivering post in the coming days. \"Unless these issues are resolved soon, we'll be facing serious disruption,\" a Post Office spokesman said. </p> <p>The Post Office, which has suspended one service guaranteeing next day delivery, is to prioritise deliveries between post offices, the spokesman said. This is designed to ensure that social security payments are not disrupted. </p> <p>The spokesman refused to specify how long the Post Office would be able to maintain deliveries of post and parcels from its 36,000-strong fleet of vehicles. \"Fuel stocks are very low,\" he said. </p> <p>Representatives of the high street banking groups were yesterday in talks with the government about ensuring that armoured vehicles were able to keep their petrol tanks full. The vehicles are needed to transport cash and cheques between bank branches and from retailers to put into banks and cash machines. </p> <p>A spokesman for Apacs, the Association for Payment Clearing Services, said the banks were dusting down the contingency plans designed for potential cash shortages during the millennium bug scare at the start of this year. [Jill Treanor]</p> <p> <b> Business</b><br> The fuel crisis is costing British business \u00a3250m a day, the London Chamber of Commerce warned last night as companies started to halt production lines and lay off workers. </p> <p>Simon Sperryn, chief executive of the Chamber, said his members understood the frustration of protesters about the high cost of fuel but called on them to let business get back to normal working. </p> <p>He said the figures of losses were based on estimates that roughly 10% of the economy's daily output was being lost through disruption. </p> <p>The Confederation of British Industry said its members were scaling back their operations. If things did not improve by the weekend \"large parts of the economy would grind to a halt\", said CBI director-general, Digby Jones. </p> <p>Kingfisher, which owns store groups such as B&amp;Q and Woolworths, admitted it would run out of fuel today although it insisted it was not yet suffering any downturn in sales at its out of town sites. </p> <p>The kinds of pressures being faced by small businesses were expressed by Dustyn Etherington, proprietor of bespoke framemaking business, Frameworx in Taunton, Devon. He said: \"People are not picking up their finished frames because they do not want to use their cars and suppliers say they have run out of fuel. I have rents and outgoings to pay and I'm not insured for any of this. Its all a bit frightening.\" [Terry Macalister] </p> <p> <b> Schools</b><br> Councils struggling to keep schools running are telling teachers to report to their nearest school if they are unable to get to their normal place of work. </p> <p>In the north-west, Rochdale council has called on employees to get to work \"any way they can\" in order to maintain services and has said it will keep schools going even if they have to be run by teachers who usually work somewhere else. </p> <p>Similar steps are being taken or being considered in Devon and other, more rural, parts of England and Wales where teachers and pupils alike are facing particular difficulties in getting to school because of the fuel shortage. </p> <p>Bus operators with school run contracts were yesterday again being told to take children to school only if they had enough fuel to be able to take them home again. </p> <p>Against expectation, Somerset managed to keep all its schools open yesterday after fears that teachers at rural primary schools would not be able to get to work. But other parts of the country are already bracing themselves for closures. </p> <p>Schools in Dewsbury in west Yorkshire may have to close tomorrow while in south Wales, Rhondda Cynon Taff expects all or nearly all of its 19 secondary schools will be closed today because of problems with school transport for 12,000 pupils. </p> <p>North Lanarkshire council in Scotland stopped all school bus services and many school services in the Borders were axed. [Geoffrey Gibbs] </p> <p> <b> Public transport</b><br> Buses and trains across the country will run out of fuel tomorrow if the government does not guarantee deliveries, transport operators warned last night. </p> <p>Stagecoach spokesman Barry Gardner said: \"Three-quarters of buses are able to transport commuters until Friday night. If fuel does not get through, we will have to remove services from Saturday.\" </p> <p>In Gwent and the Rhondda Valley, buses were stopping at 7pm and half of the services were cancelled. In Cheltenham and Gloucester, services were down by 12% and Oxford inner city buses were cut by half. Rural areas of Lancashire will have no buses this weekend. </p> <p>In Edinburgh, the main bus operator, Lothian buses, cancelled all services after 6.30pm. They will resume at rush hour this morning, but the company warned of total cancellation by tomorrow. </p> <p>Transport For London yesterday told the government the capital needs 10 tankers of emergency fuel per day to keep buses, traffic lights and underground emergency response units running. But no fuel reached London buses yesterday and between 20-25 garages were expected to run dry today. A spokesman said London buses could come to a halt early next week. </p> <p>Dennis Lovett from Virgin trains said the cross-country Aberdeen to Penzance diesel service had enough fuel to last until midnight tonight. </p> <p>But trains were crowded, with Virgin sending office staff to sell tickets and man platforms. Passengers with pre-booked tickets either failed to receive them because of postal delays, or could not get to the station because of lack of petrol. Virgin trains ran late from Edinburgh because drivers could not get to work due to blockades and First Great Western were yesterday booking hotels for staff without petrol for the trip home. </p> <p>Electric transport was also crowded. Tram passengers in Manchester were advised not to travel at peak times and Mersey Rail Electrics increased its trains from three cars to six. </p> <p>Most London taxi fleets were yesterday carrying account holders only. Manchester firms were not pre-booking and predicted an average wait of one hour. [Angelique Chrisafis]</p>",
  "Four months ago, the streets belonged to different people. May Day brought out the massed ranks of environmental protest. They dug up Parliament Square, and laid turf on the road to stop the cars going round. The essence of their case was anti-car, and they certainly hated Big Oil. <p>Coming out of the campaigns against the Newbury and other bypasses, they are the British branch of global protest against the effects of globalisation. They were in Seattle, they're now being beaten up in Australia, soon they will decamp to Prague for the next onslaught against world trade. They are passionate and righteous. Above all they've lost their faith in parliamentary democracy. </p> <p>The campaign against the price of petrol has the same rage, and reflects a similar despair. Direct action, it says, is all that works. But the purpose is entirely the opposite. The blockaders are fervently pro-truck and pro-car. They couldn't imagine a world without growth. They want more petrol, to make more journeys, in pursuit of the only kind of economy they and most of us understand. Their crude protest at the giant forces ranged against them - Opec, Big Oil, the Treasury - is the only way they think they can make known their grave frustration at not being able to pursue these objectives. They take government as their nearest enemy. They too have given up on parliamentary discourse, and the old methods of indirect democracy. </p> <p>These mirror images - the exactness of their contradiction, the equal ferocity with which the opposite opinions are held - make the textbook case for the system the protesters have given up on. The two camps don't engage, don't enter into argument. Each floats in its own world, determined to force its will on the boring old democrats. The place where argument should take place is parliament. The only place where these two extreme views can be mediated towards some kind of workable balance is in the councils of the elected government. That's what governments do. And it's the system governments have no choice but to defend. </p> <p>Up to a point, the Blair government is being successful in this. The May Day events had no discernible consequences for policy. Nothing changed. The only mark was left by a surprising failure, on the part of the royal parks or whoever, to replant the grass. The touristic centre of British democracy remains, perhaps symbolically, a wasteland. </p> <p>The oil barricades are likely to go the same way some time soon. The protesters lack some of the crucial ingredients necessary to impose their will. Though mobile phones make them better organised than they seem, they have no leader. There is no vanguard force at the leading edge of the revolution. Farmers and hauliers are developing some experience in protest, but the Leninist/Scargillite core, so essential to the sheer endurance necessary for direct action, probably does not exist. </p> <p>The objective, moreover, is unfocused. One reason why the poll-tax campaign became the most successful exercise of mass protest in living memory was that its purpose was simple. A critical mass of explosive public energy gathered to change a law. There were few dissenters from the proposition that the existing law was unjust. The streets could be occupied without much threat to normal daily life. The campaign made a passable claim to speak for a grand popular majority. </p> <p>Protest against the oil price is more convoluted, its ramifications are more puzzling. No honest observer can say the government is entirely, or even mainly, to blame. Desperate farmers and hauliers are just lashing out. Naturally, when pollsters ask motorists if they want the petrol price to come down, 90% say yes. What happened to the other 10? But such sympathies would not survive a collapse of essential services at the hands of cowardly Big Oil or self-interested small hauliers. Nor could the alleged support of the public be relied on, for more than a few days, to override the certain rage of the public at not being able to buy petrol. </p> <p>There's another difference from the Thatcher years when direct action reached its peak. The protesters this time face a strong and fairly popular government. A vital contributor to the poll-tax campaign's capacity to overturn her government's plans, and eventually herself, was Mrs Thatcher's fast diminishing credibility. The tax crystallised wider hatreds, the campaign a more general lashing-out. </p> <p> Mr Blair does not face that. On the other hand, it's here that he must be careful. So far, after slow early responses to a crisis that accelerated much faster than anyone predicted, he has done pretty well. He took the right line against an intolerable display of what one might call non-violent force. He reminded Big Oil of its responsibilities, and the police of theirs. Last night he sounded a pleading note to the protesters. But if his bold prediction of early progress towards normality comes true, he will have done what a national leader should do: taken care of the quality of daily life when it's challenged by vested interests acting against the common good. And he will not have watched Britain embrace the French way of political life. </p> <p>But he will not be hailed as a hero. That is his difficulty. For the blockades, though beatable, say something real: that the government hasn't paid enough attention to deep concerns. The lectures about Opec are not enough. The statistics showing how small is the tax element in recent price hikes cut little ice. The juggernaut of facts and promises behind which Gordon Brown has dragged the support of 415 Labour MPs for three years, justifying high and sometimes stealthy taxation, does not always carry the enthusiastic understanding of the mass public in its wake. </p> <p>At the pumps and on the roads, in other words, discontent now rages to the surface among quite a swath of middle Britain. In some circumstances it could get wider. We live in an age when allegiances are shallow, and most voters have the keenest interest in number one. They're disinclined to give governments the benefit of the doubt when they still think they're paying too much for petrol. Mr Blair, even if he wins this one, faces a troubled legacy. But worse than that, he cannot be sure that the failure of direct action will lead to a revival of faith in consultative democracy. </p> <p>A significant accessory to this is the Conservative party. Just think how present discontents ought to suit the Tories. Sierra Man and Mondeo Woman could be returning in droves. Having first voted Labour in 1997, they might not take much persuading, as they sit fuming in cars they cannot drive, that Labour had let them down. The Tory sneer that Labour is out of touch may sit oddly with Tory sarcasm that Labour spends too much time worrying about focus-group opinion, but angry footloose voters could easily overlook such contradictions. </p> <p>That, however, assumes the presence of a Tory party parked on the middle ground of politics. A centrist party would pick up support from people who trusted it to do much of what Labour is doing but better, and for whom the price of petrol was the last straw. Instead, William Hague has driven his party towards a state of unelectability. It is his gift to politics. Searching perhaps for an alternative national leadership, Sierra Man sees only an extremist sect, obsessed with Europe, talking to itself, counting mainly the votes the leader needs to keep his job after he has been smashed at the polls. </p> <p>This is not a happy context in which to be urging direct actionists to renew their faith in the choices at the ballot box. The Tories make their special contribution to democratic decline. But the main challenge is to Mr Blair and New Labour. </p> <p> He will, we may be sure, have listened to the protest. Though he cannot lower taxes just because the barricades are calling, he and Mr Brown will be sensitive in their own good time to the message they've been getting. The signal is surely received. The hint of a promise to hear the voices before November's pre-budget statement will be enough to suck back some popular support. That's the sense in which direct action can be effective. One march by the Countryside Alliance was enough to stall the abolition of fox-hunting. As an act of politics rather than force majeure, mass protest is a perfectly legitimate way of intruding into public decisions. </p> <p>But there's more to do than that. Freed by his huge majority to take parliament for granted, Mr Blair has not been an exponent of open-minded debate. The world views of the May Day diggers and the Grangemouth blockaders remain undiscussed in parliament. Controlling and single-minded, the Blair government is a poor advertisement for deliberative democracy. Arguably, no postwar government has been any better. But these are different times, when the demand to be heard is more desperate, and the deference to leaders, mercifully, less to be relied on. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:hugoyoung@compuserve.com\">hugoyoung@compuserve.com</a></p>",
  "Friday evening: dusk has fallen over the Holy Land and a three-quarter moon is rising through a cloudless sky. Israel and Palestine are preparing quietly for their very different Friday nights: the start of the Jewish sabbath; the end of the Muslim equivalent. We are driving into the West Bank city of Ramallah. <p>Suddenly, there are the kind of noises that have made the Holy Land famous in our own time: what sounds like rocket fire, glass breaking and rocks being heaved on to the road. Drivers on the dual carriageway - their instincts honed by years of practice during the intifada - screech to a halt, manoeuvre frantically and accelerate away in the opposite direction. The sounds of shouting grow closer and the rock-throwing continues. Eventually, a group of Arab youths become visible, running down the hill towards the giant Marlboro ad by the city limits. </p> <p>It takes a moment to realise that this can't be what it sounds like. There have been no Israeli soldiers in Ramallah for six years. \"What's going on?\" I ask a young man standing on the pavement. \"Man,\" he says, \"it's soooooo crazy. We get rid of the Israelis. Now we have all this shit.\" </p> <p>\"What's it about?\" </p> <p>\"Football,\" he says with contempt. </p> <p>The locals, he explains, have just played the team from the Balata refugee camp near Nablus. There is always bad feeling between the supporters. (And this was nothing, I discovered later, to what happened when a West Bank team played one from the Gaza Strip.) He stops. \"Do you want anything, you know, stuff?\" he asks. \"Or are you straight?\" </p> <p>Giant Marlboro ads, football hooligans, dope dealers . . . welcome to the incipient state of Palestine, a place that in many respects is neither more nor less holy than most of the 190-odd countries which already exist. </p> <p>Of all the weeks in the quadrennial calendar, the one with the Olympic opening ceremony is the one where shows of nationhood have most global resonance. Tomorrow in Sydney a lone athlete will carry the Palestinian flag; marching behind him will be just one swimmer. The two of them might have gone into the stadium emboldened by an official declaration of Palestine's independence. The day earmarked for this was yesterday: September 13. But the moment passed, under the pressure of world politics. </p> <p>It would have been meaningless anyway. Notionally, the Palestine Liberation Organisation declared independence 12 years ago. And a declaration this week would have been equally ignored, not only by Israel, but also by world opinion, which is sympathetic to this Israeli government's efforts to do a deal. </p> <p>But no one doubts now that independence is coming: somehow, sometime soon. The reality of impending Palestine is accepted by everyone except those on the wilder shores of Israeli politics - admittedly a fairly long stretch of coastline, but not one that any longer has the moral or physical strength to withstand the onrushing tide of historical inevitability. </p> <p>There are no trivial times in the Middle East, but the months ahead - specifically, from the end of Israel's High Holyday season in late October until Bill Clinton leaves office in January - are now crucial. Palestinian sovereignty might - just might - come in triumph, with handshakes on the White House lawn, followed by the full-hearted consent of the Israeli and Palestinian people. It might happen amid terrible bloodshed. Things being as they are round here, it will almost certainly be a mess. The arguments about Jerusalem go on but it seems to me that something has changed crucially: Israel no longer has the moral certitude that would allow it to suppress Palestine indefinitely. </p> <p>A nation-state is like an elephant: hard to define - but you know one when you see it. Every day Palestine looks increasingly like the rest of the herd, sometimes depressingly so. When Arafat returned from New York last Saturday for the meeting with his central council that took the decision to delay, he was greeted by the massed band of his security forces, headed by his personal swordbearer and half-a-dozen pipers who struck up The Road to the Isles with charming irrelevance. It could have been anywhere in the developing world. </p> <p>Every week, there are other, quieter signs. Palestine now has its own web suffix: appropriately for a country which is the world's afterthought, it is \"ps\". A few days ago, the children went back to school. And some of them, for the first time, began learning according to a specifically Palestinian curriculum, rather than one borrowed from the Egyptians or Jordanians. A new international telephone code (970 instead of the Israeli 972) is said to be imminent. There are stamps, although the money value - in non-existent Palestinian fils - has to be blacked out if the letter is being sent to Israel. </p> <p>In Gaza and the West Bank cities (excepting always Jerusalem, that most special of special cases), there is no longer any visible hint of a country under occupation. But this is in part an illusion. Arafat's jet flies in and out of Gaza airport by the grace and permission of Ehud Barak's government. And anyone else who wants to leave is allowed to do so only after checking in their self-respect with Israeli officialdom. Passengers from the airport have to be bused to the nearest Israeli border post to get an exit permit. </p> <p>Dr Mahdi Abdul-Hadi, the head of Passia (the Palestine Academic Society for the Study of International Affairs), is regularly invited to speak at international conferences, sometimes with Jimmy Carter or even Bill Clinton. \"If I want to renew my travelling document, I have to go to the Israeli ministry of the interior and start queuing at four in the mornings, sometimes two or three times, and it will cost me $150 to $200. This kind of humiliation is ongoing.\" </p> <p>The political scientist Ghassan Khatib can go to Jerusalem, because his office is there. He cannot, however, invite his wife or mother to the city for dinner. \"Dinner can only be a reason if you have good relations with the right Israeli officers.\" He needs another permit to cross Israel to visit Gaza, where the residents now complain they are currently being denied the right to go to Jerusalem even for prayer. </p> <p>The Palestine that might have called itself independent this week looks like a Rorschach test on the map, reminiscent of the old, mad South African statelet of Bophuthatswana, which the apartheid regime created out of several, unrelated bite-sized chunks. In fact, it is even more complicated than that: the land is divided into A, B and C areas, depending on whether the Palestinians have control over both administration and security (A areas), administration but not security (B areas) or neither (C areas). Even on the most optimistic assessment - and the status of Jerusalem is irrelevant here - it will always be in two parts: the West Bank and Gaza, separated by the width of Israel. </p> <p>Distances in these parts are surprisingly tiny. It takes only an hour to drive from Gaza to Jerusalem, if you don't have to endure obstructive border guards. Putative Palestine is a fraction larger than Oxfordshire. If the original Palestine had been the size of Australia or Siberia, no one would have had to fight anyone. </p> <p>The history of non-contiguous countries is not an encouraging one: witness the fate of Pakistan. And there are already signs of the two wings developing different characteristics. But Palestine and Israel have many things in common, and one of these is the sense of overriding national destiny papering over a thousand underlying fissures. </p> <p>This destiny, however, is created entirely by recent history. Less than 30 years ago, the Israeli prime minister Golda Meir could scornfully deny that the Palestinian people existed. Their sense of nationhood was barely visible before the 20s and was fully fashioned only amid the adversity of the refugee camps and the Israeli occupation. \"They now have different historical experiences, beliefs and myths from any other Arabs,\" says Dr Menahem Klein, lecturer in politics at Israel's Bar-Ian University. </p> <p>\"Palestinians are not instinctively employees, not followers,\" says Mahdi Abdul-Hadi. \"I think we are always demanding to be equal partners. Arafat is known as \"ikhtiya\", the old man, rather than \"ra-ees\", the leader. It is very different from the attitude of somewhere like Egypt, where there are millions of followers. We are talkative and argumentative.\" </p> <p>\"That reminds me of another country around here,\" I murmur. </p> <p>\"Of course,\" he says. \"We have cousins called Israelis.\" </p> <p>Ghassan Khatib agrees with this analysis. \"There is a theory that oppressed people tend to admire their oppressors because they are stronger. I think Palestinians do admire features of Israeli society, and one of them is democracy.\" </p> <p>But democracy has never flowered in the Arab world. Palestine is a cacophony of voices: the town of Nablus alone has nine TV stations. But journalists who shout too loud find that life can get difficult. \"Officially, censorship does not exist,\" says journalist Khaled Abu Aker. \"But we have started to face the need for self-censorship in order not to have problems. There are stories you can hear in Palestinian society that you don't read in the press. Not only stories that criticise the security apparatus and the president, but also social problems and, of course, corruption.\" </p> <p>The country does not feel like a dictatorship. Even the communists sit in Ramallah with the front door open and offer coffee to all-comers under a Che Vive! poster. However, their big hope is municipal elections, and these have been postponed - regularly, indefinitely and mysteriously. </p> <p>Palestine's tortuous route to independence means that the country has endured the disillusionment that inevitably follows liberation without the cathartic joy of actually getting there. The Jabalia refugee camp in Gaza was once the fieriest of revolutionary hotbeds. On the street corners where once there were gun battles, patriotism has been succeeded by a sullen cynicism. \"It was better in the Israeli times,\" grumbles one shopkeeper. \"Then, if you went to prison you knew you were there for fighting the Israelis. Now you go to prison and you don't know why. And it's very hard to get out.\" </p> <p>His voice is an unusually bitter one, but even the most optimistic scenarios for peace cannot solve Palestine's essential problem: how to make a living. \"I used to take 2,000 shekels a day,\" says Abu Ibrahim, a draper. \"Now it's barely 200.\" One of his few customers is Jasir um Mahmoud, a taxi-driver's wife and mother of 12. \"At least we don't have the Israeli army running after our kids,\" she says, \"but the economic situation is still very hard.\" </p> <p>Life is tough the world over for mothers of 12, but that is not such an unusual figure in Gaza, which has the world's highest birthrate. I saw thousands of girls emerge from one narrow primary school gate - identically dressed in striped cotton dresses with jeans underneath for modesty, and ribbons in their hair for femininity. It seemed not so much the end of a normal school day, more like the migration of the wildebeest. </p> <p>It's hard to be hopeful for these girls' future in a country that has no visible means of support. There is no serious export industry, though there is a trade in carnations - which could make the place dangerously dependent on western marriage rates. Given that there is hardly any spare land and even less fresh water, agriculture is not an enticing option. What Palestine does have is a well-educated and open-minded workforce. Arafat has talked of making the country \"the Singapore of the Middle East.\" But if he is open for business, the customers are not yet piling in. </p> <p>Palestine is still full of surprises. Ramallah has become a boom town because the West Bank administration is concentrated there; there is a casino in Jericho, which attracts the more louche kind of Israeli; Bethlehem will always be a nice little earner. </p> <p>There are some surprisingly rich people around. Gaza City is far from the unmitigated hellhole of popular imagination, and the Mediterranean is as blue here as anywhere else, with the locals packing the beaches every Friday. The latest fashion accessory for the rich Gazan is a Sri Lankan or Filipino housemaid. You just can't get the staff, apparently . . . </p> <p>But on the beachfront you have only to turn your eyes northward, and you can see - very clearly indeed - the harbour in the Israeli port of Ashdod. Palestine will be dependent on Israeli money and jobs for the foreseeable future. </p> <p>Yet the suspicion between the two sides lingers poisonously. The latest idea for Jerusalem is that it should be declared to be under divine administration. \"And does God empty the rubbish?\" one Israeli commented. It is suggested that Gaza and the West Bank should be linked with a bridge over the full width of the desert so that no Palestinians have to touch Israeli soil. Ah, yes, but who's in charge of the columns? </p> <p> At the PLO flag shop in Gaza (which sells inflatable Arafats, of the sort sometimes waved at English football matches) you can buy little lapel pins with the Israeli and Palestinian flags intertwined. They are popular with Israeli peaceniks who come over for conferences. \"Do any Palestinians buy them?\" I ask the owner. \"Never,\" he says. </p> <p>\"We know the Palestinians are preparing for a struggle,\" says an Israeli army officer. \"They are accumulating food and water. They are training their people. They have these youth camps for children aged seven to 13, teaching them to kidnap Israeli soldiers. It's so absurd.\" </p> <p>Even optimists put the chances of Barak (who has no parliamentary majority) getting a deal past the Israeli public as no better than 50/50. But in the mirror-image country on the other side of the argument, the politics are just as difficult. Arafat's popularity shot up after July, when he got tough and refused to do a deal at Camp David. </p> <p>The Israelis have many qualities but empathy is not one of them. You realise that just driving round Jerusalem: for Israeli motorists, the problems of other road-users are never their problems. They are just nuisances to be bullied out of the way. In the wider context, that's why it took them so long to understand that the Palestinians were, like them, victims of history. But the glimmering of understanding they now have is perhaps the one thing that makes another full-scale war less likely. </p> <p>Even now there won't be much charity around for the new infant: conceived amid hatred; born into poverty; with war, oppression, tyranny and terrorism deep in its genes. And yet the Israelis will give Palestine a curious birthday present: an example to emulate. \"Israel started with nothing,\" says Dr Mahdi Abdul-Hadi. \"In 1947 you had to queue for one egg a week. We are in a much better situation than they were. We don't have much and we start from scratch. But this is the Middle East, the land of miracles. It will witness the rebirth of Palestine.\" </p>",
  "<p>Efforts to protect elephants from hunters and habitat loss have been so successful that parts of Africa are in danger of being overrun with the animals, scientists have warned. </p> <p>In an effort to control elephant numbers without culling them researchers have announced the completion of successful trials of an elephant contraceptive. </p> <p>Writing in today's issue of Nature, a US-South African group said only 11 of 31 female elephants given the contraceptive had become pregnant. </p> <p>The contraceptive is a vaccine that makes the elephant's immune system produce special antibodies. These antibodies lock on to proteins on the surface of the elephants' eggs, preventing sperm from fertilising them. </p> <p>Kruger, one of a number of national parks with a surplus elephant problem, lies along South Africa's border with Mozambique. </p> <p>About the size of Israel, it can support 7,500 to 8,000 elephants without threatening the survival of other species. But with no natural predators, elephants usually live to be 60, and the population grows by 7% to 8% a year. </p> <p>Kruger has tried giving elephants away, but there are few responsible takers. So it has resorted to killing hundreds each year. </p> <p>The alternative is to see the park suffer the fate of areas of Botswana and Zimbabwe which have been turned into wastelands, their dead trees stripped of bark, thanks to the depredations of elephant herds. A single elephant eats 300 to 600 lb of food a day. </p> <p>A group of scientists from Germany tried a different elephant contraceptive technique some years ago when it fed oestrogen to females. </p> <p>This proved disastrous. Two cows remained permanently on heat and were mobbed by bulls, with the result that two calves were trampled. </p> <p>The US-South African team claims its contraceptive vaccine causes no such problems, and is easily reversible. \"Elephants are intelligent and empathetic mammals, and culling is a last resort in controlling their numbers,\" the scientists said. </p> <p>But the research, funded by US animal welfare groups opposed to culling, has drawn fire from African-based groups, who argue that it is an unnatural and selfish way to control elephant numbers. </p> <p>Anti-contraception activists say it is folly to deprive wildlife parks and local people of the chance to earn money and grow food by harvesting ivory, hides and meat from surplus elephants.</p>",
  "If the London stock market traded in reputations, it would be in the depths of a bear market. This summer the public has been asked to accept that the gilded youth who fought the Battle of Britain were class-ridden snobs and to believe that Sir Arthur Conan Doyle not only stole the plot of the Hound of the Baskervilles from a friend, but then killed him to hide the fact. Today an exhibition, South, opens at the National Maritime Museum, bringing with it a fresh verdict on Captain Robert Falcon Scott and the Norwegian rival who beat him to the south pole, Roald Amundsen. Once again the currency of reputation has been shown to be horribly volatile. <p>Not long ago the story of poor Captain Scott was taught as a simple one of ice, death and stoicism. No longer. The new Scott has been found to be a dismal leader, dismissive of good advice, wrongly equipped (not least with Indian ponies used to tropical heat, not icy blasts) and remote from his men. He even rowed with Sir Ernest Shackleton in a blizzard at 80 degrees south. Meanwhile, the new Amundsen comes over not as the devious dog-eating Norwegian of old, but as a caring, sharing team-leader whose men put on weight as they charged back from the pole and who buried stocks of spare food in ice caves. In its exhibition, the National Maritime Museum is naturally keener to proclaim the new Amundsen than the new Scott, but the sub-text is obvious. </p> <p>The lessons of such reshuffling are not all bad. As old figures are knocked down, new ones are built up to replace them. But it is tricky to know where the process is at. Napoleon's stock appears to have risen (less power-crazed butcher, more pan-European planner) while Mother Theresa's has fallen. Trading in Diana shares has been suspended pending review, but the Queen Mum remains a blue chip. Nobody's buying Titus Oates and nobody's selling Charles Darwin or Nelson Mandela. Yet.</p>",
  "<b> What's the difference between legalising something and de-criminalising it?</b> <p> * Not much. Actively repealing a law which prohibits something, decriminalises it - an example was the extension of Sunday trading by shops. By contrast, legalising something might either clarify the law where it was previously unclear - the finance acts following the budget usually both create tax exemptions and limit avoidance schemes - or introduce or extend rights, such as abortion, women's suffrage and the reduction in voting age from 21 to 18. </p> <p>Examples of confusion, discrimination and misconceptions in this area are commonplace. Sex between men is still seen by the common law (case law developed over the ages by judges) as a crime of \"gross indecency\". It is decriminalised in only limited circumstances - the men must be 18 or over, there must never be more than two involved and it must be within a very tight definition of privacy, none of which restrictions apply to sex between women and men. Notwithstanding the recent House of Lords rejections of reform, this will not long survive decisions of the European Court nor the Human Rights Act which is about to come into force south of the Scottish border (it is already enshrined in Scottish law). </p> <p>Another distinction to be made is between actual decriminalisation by law change and the practice of enforcement by the authorities. Contrary to popular belief, Dutch law still criminalises possession and dealing in recreational drugs such as cannabis. In practice certain premises - coffee shops - are licensed by councils for the purchase and consumption of small amounts; similarly in the UK it is a crime to exceed the speed limits but prosecution is rare even if the 30mph limit, for example, is exceeded by around one third. Charges of corporate manslaughter (eg following the Paddington rail disaster) are similarly exceptional. </p> <p> Chris Morley, Woodhouse, Leeds. </p> <p> <b> We have \"the Middle East\" and \"the Far East\", but where is \"the Near East\"? And what should we call the area which covers India, Bangladesh, Nepal, etc?</b> </p> <p> * \"Near East\" is the old name for Asia between Turkey and India (ie the area west of the pride of the British Empire). After the second world war, a more precise name was needed, so Israel and neighbouring Arab countries became known as the \"Middle East\". Of course, it all depends where you are standing. Many years ago, on my first visit to India, I was surprised to hear All India Radio talking about the crisis in \"West Asia\" - the Middle East from their standpoint. \"South Asia\" is the name given to the sub-Indian subcontinent, plus Nepal, Sri Lanka, etc, to distinguish it from South-East Asia, formerly Indo-China. </p> <p> Mike Broadbent, Luton, Beds. </p> <p>*In the days before British military withdrawal from east of Suez, the RAF had three separate eastern commands: Far East Air Force; Air Force Middle East and Near East Air Force. The last comprised, from what I recollect, bases on Cyprus, Malta and Gibraltar. NEAF HQ was based at RAF Episcopi, Cyprus. The building is still in use but has been re-designated as HQ Joint Services. </p> <p> Tony Cummings (ret. squadron leader), Hough Green, Chester. </p> <p> <b> My butcher told me not to worry about wasps crawling over the meat in his shop, saying \"they're completely germ free, they don't spread anything.\" Was he right?</b> </p> <p> * Before turning up in the shop, wasps are likely to have spent time either on the dead cat in the gutter, the mouldy apple cores and bits of ham sandwich in the litter bin or the cowpat in the meadow. They carry bacteria on their feet and bodies from these to the prime cuts in the butcher's window. </p> <p>Flies and bluebottles do this more visibly by disgorging digestive fluid onto their food to soften it up and also lay eggs (hence maggots) in it - but wasps are just as good at mere germ distribution.

This would explain the rectangular shapes on the millennium map - they are missile silos. </p> <p>My mother, who lives near Newbury, has always maintained that the cruise missiles, allegedly at nearby Greenham Common, were in fact based at Welford. This would make sense, if only in terms of transport logistics. Cruise missiles were designed to be mobile and capable of being launched from any part of the country. To reach the M4 from Greenham (in the 80s) necessitated driving through Newbury, whereas Welford has its own private slip road. </p> <p>Perhaps all the women who so persistently protested against the cruise missiles were actually camping in the wrong place after all. </p> <p> Jackie Nickson, Farncombe, Surrey . </p> <p>*Many Access Only roads are in fact motorway police stations and garages. A couple of years ago, I was given a lift to Luton Airport by a Met police detective. He swung off the motorway on to one of these roads promising that it would take many miles off the journey - which it did. Some way up this road, there were rectangular structures, an array of parked police vehicles and officers relaxing with tea and fags. Anyone wishing to try these shortcuts, however, should be advised that you need someone in the car who can show a warrant card. </p> <p> Graham White, Milton Bridge, Midlothian. </p> <p> <b> History books often refer to \"fountains flowing with wine\" during major celebrations. Is there any credible account of how these fountains were operated, or was the term merely an overblown way of saying that drinks were free?</b> </p> <p> * At the opening of the Melbourne International Exhibition (1880-81) by the Marquis of Normanby the fountains outside the purpose-built Royal Exhibition Building in the Carlton Gardens flowed with pink champagne. During the ceremonies, which included the performance of an interminable exhibition cantata, everybody waiting outside got drunk and rioting ensued. Buckets of pink champagne were carried off to the suburbs. I do not think similar hospitalities have since been attempted in Melbourne. </p> <p> Angus Trumble, Art Gallery of South Australia, Adelaide. </p> <p>* For centuries Exeter's citizen's were supplied with drinking water by a public conduit, an impressive edifice with taps, situated in the centre of the city at the Carfax.

During the Sagra dell'Uva, at the grape harvest in August, the celebrated Fountain of the Moors in the main square is decorated with bunches of grapes, and pumps out wine instead of water.

  "Here's a little quiz. When you are in the gym pounding away on the PowerJog, what is running through your mind. Is it: <br>a) \"Wow, there's cute\"? <p>b) \"Only 15 more minutes of this torture, then I can scoff a carton of chocolate ginger ice-cream\"? </p> <p>c) \"Ooh, look at her over there, does she really think the Lycra thong was a wise option?\"? </p> <p>d) \"Right, that's 800m in 6 minutes 38 seconds. Not long to go before I match the 2 minutes 20 seconds speed of Denise Lewis\"? </p> <p>Don't worry - unless you answered d, you are perfectly normal. No, really, you are. According to Dr Precilla Choi, a feminist psychologist based at Keele University, most women exercise in order to boost their sexual attractiveness rather than their sporting prowess. \"Physical exercise has become the latest commodity in the highly commercialised beauty culture,\" she asserts, in a paper just presented to the British Association. \"Instead of being promoted to women as a way of improving physical and psychological health, it is promoted as a way of improving their sex appeal through losing weight and improving muscle tone and appearance.\" </p> <p>She also claims that attractive sportswomen such as Anna Kournikova are putting women off taking up exercise. \"The belief that beauty will result from exercise can also translate into a belief that one has to be beautiful in order to exercise. This prevents women from exercising.\" </p> <p>This sounds like a sweeping generalisation to me. Is it really fair to blame Kournikova and her \"no bounce\" bra ads entirely for the fact that eight out of 10 British women are not taking enough exercise? After a grim day at work, when we put off going weight-training, are we doing so because, as Choi claims, we suddenly feel there is no point because we will never achieve that level of physical perfection anyway? Or are we avoiding physical exercise because we are lazy and slothful, and the pub sounds like more fun? </p> <p>Aha, I thought so. Yes, gyms tend to attract people who are concerned about their body image, but that goes for muscle-popping men as much as for hollow-cheeked women. It is true that one needs only to spend five minutes in a changing room to realise that weight loss is a major factor in some women's attendance. Female locker rooms are dominated not by personal bests but by endless diet targets. \"Only another 10 pounds to go\" is a depressingly familiar mantra. </p> <p>Yet for every dieter, there is another woman who is there because she actually enjoys the rush of endorphins a good work-out releases. Exercise isn't just about the physical body; sport has been shown to boost self-confidence and self-esteem, and to help reduce self-destructive behaviour such as compulsive eating, drinking and smoking. </p> <p>Back in 1994, a study entitled Perceptions of Female Body Shapes as a Function of Exercising found that exercisers rated themselves as more attractive, confident, healthy and popular, and had much higher body satisfaction than non-exercisers, despite being significantly heavier than the women surveyed who did not exercise. While it is regrettable that women often only think of taking up exercise because they want to lose weight, hopefully many soon ditch the diet once they begin to enjoy mastering their own speed and strength. </p> <p> Personally I love the fact that every time I run a mile, my time gets a tiny, tiny bit faster, allowing for superhero-type fantasies. Ultimately speed is far more thrilling than weight loss. Certainly, a lot of the blame for the exercise-weight loss connection lies with the people who run gyms. \"And how much weight are you wanting to lose?\" is still a stock question during many gym induction programmes, regardless of whether a woman is, heaven forbid, happy with her weight. </p> <p>This is unhealthy because, apart from anything else, it creates a culture of competition between women. \"How much have you lost?\" is such a pointless question when what locker room bonding should be about is sharing gossip and mutual support. </p> <p>In the run-up to the Sydney Olympics, much has been made of the cultural conspiracy that exists to keep women out of sport. In her controversial book The Frailty Myth, Colette Dowling suggests that physical equality is the real final frontier of women's liberation. \"Strength has a withering effect on male identity. To salvage men's failing sense of dominance (post industrial revolution), women were encouraged to scale back their own physical development. Sport is the last place that men, no longer supremely dominant, can assert their body strength and masculinity. Men need to keep women weak, off the football field and out of the boxing ring, so they can continue to feel strong.\" </p> <p>Dowling reckons it is only a matter of time before women start competing with men on the playing field. They had better watch out then. I reckon that by about 2012, I'll be fast enough to take them on.</p>",
  "Ginetta Sagan, an irrepressible human rights campaigner, who has died in California aged 75, earned her sobriquet Topolino (or Little Mouse) as an anti-Fascist partisan in Italy. Although she never grew taller than five feet, she made up for her diminutive stature with passion, courage and infectious effervescence. <p>Mussolini's Black Brigade captured her in February 1945. For three months she endured rape and torture - experiences which spurred her quest to fight oppression. In later life Ginetta Sagan was to become a leading light in Amnesty International. She set up its first branch in the western US in 1968, pioneered its direct mailing campaigns, and later became honorary chair of its board of directors. </p> <p>Together with her husband, Leonard Sagan, she helped expand the number of Amnesty US members from 700 to 70,000 between 1971-77. Her own Aurora Fund monitors human rights and supports the families of political prisoners. In 1994 Amnesty created the Ginetta Sagan Fund to honour those battling the mistreatment of women and children. It has given prizes of $10,000 to like-minded women from Bhutan, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Rwanda, Guatemala and Peru. </p> <p>In 1996 Ginetta received two of the highest civilian awards available - the Presidential Medal of Freedom from Bill Clinton and the Grand Ufficiale del Merito della Repubblica from President Scalfaro of Italy. </p> <p>Yet one incident, 50 years earlier, symbolised Ginetta's mission (it forms the centrepiece of Mary Finley's 1995 biography of Sagan, The Matchbox). A guard flung a loaf of bread into her cell as she was awaiting yet another bout of interrogation. Tearing it open, she discovered a matchbox. Inside was a slip of paper bearing the word, \"Corragio!\" Soon afterwards two Reichswehr deserters (allies of the partisans) burst into the compound and freed her. Nuns at a nearby hospital nursed Ginetta back to health. Recipients of the Sagan Award today get a little crystal matchbox to remind them that no matter how lonely and forlorn their struggle may seem, someone outside cares. </p> <p>Both Ginetta's parents had been active anti-Fascists in Milan. Her father, a Catholic physician, was arrested and shot in September 1943. Her Jewish mother, also a doctor, died in Auschwitz. Newly orphaned and aged just 17, Ginetta joined the partisan movement, Giustizia e Liberta. She soon proved agile and cunning - passing messages to the Allies, printing and distributing clandestine anti-Fascist pamphlets, and bringing food and clothing to those in hiding. </p> <p>Ginetta also smuggled some 300 Jews and other \"state enemies\" across the border to neutral Switzerland - often under the noses of Nazis, who were being entertained at diversionary parties. Comrades placed bells on goats, and guided them to holes in the barbed wire fence marking the Italian-Swiss border. Ginetta would then listen out for the telltale chimes, and lead her own flock to freedom. </p> <p>In 1948 she left for Paris, where she studied child development at the Sorbonne. There she befriended Ren\u00e9 Cassin, the French jurist and guiding light behind the International Declaration of Human Rights. She continued her studies at the University of Chicago in 1951, where she met and married Leonard Sagan. The couple lived in Washington DC, Boston and Japan, before in 1967 settling with their three sons near San Francisco. Leonard, a public health physician and environmental activist, was a pillar of strength to Ginetta until his death in 1998. The couple founded a medical committee to investigate torture in 1973. Today their fledgling outfit has grown into a global network of dedicated professionals. </p> <p>No one could accuse Ginetta Sagan of partiality. She highlighted the crimes of the military junta in Greece with a hugely successful concert in 1971 featuring Melina Mercouri and Joan Baez; revealed the extent of CIA complicity in the 1973 Chile coup; and fought to free prisoners of conscience jailed in apartheid South Africa. Yet Sagan equally castigated Communist states for their abuses. In 1983 she and Stephen Denney released an excoriating report on Vietnam's maze of \"re-education camps\". Nearly a million people vanished into this pernicious yet hitherto unknown gulag after 1975. Through persistent lobbying, Sagan secured the release of some 600 prisoners. Her report (updated in 1990) remains a model of clarity and clinical detail. </p> <p>Ginetta Sagan was one of life's natural raconteurs. Her lilting voice and ready laughter might have given the impression of levity, were it not for her preternatural ability to inspire others, and her unflinching devotion to her cause. \"Silence in the face of injustice is complicity with the oppressor,\" she once wrote. </p> <p>Sagan certainly knew the risks she was running. In 1987, while visiting dissidents in Poland, her car \"accidentally\" lost its steering and overturned, leaving her badly injured. Despite the onset of the cancer that eventually killed her, throughout the 1990s she drew attention to child victims of war and rights violations in Algeria and Tibet. </p> <p>She is survived by her three sons. </p> <p><b>Ginetta Sagan, human rights activist, born 1925; died August 25 2000</b></p>",
  "<p>The fantasy is to be there when a hurricane is forming, says Doug Parker, from the University of Leeds. He and colleague Chris Thorncroft, from Reading University, have just returned from the birthplace of hurricanes. Their aim was to discover what turns a stiff breeze into a devastating cyclone. </p> <p>Hurricanes are born over the plains and mountains of central and West Africa from what is known as the African easterly jet, a jet of air moving east to west, which can sometimes end up in America with horrifying consequences. There is a another equally important reason for investigating the African easterly jet: there is still no decent weather forecasting system that can predict when a drought or a monsoon will hit Africa, nor even how the jet affects daily weather patterns. \"At the moment we don't have much of a clue because there's so few data going in to the models,\" says Thorncroft. </p> <p>Dr Thorncroft and Dr Parker, along with an RAF crew and a team of scientists from the Met Office collected data on pressure, temperature, humidity and wind speed between Cape Verde and Niamey in Niger by dropping 110 data gathering instruments attached to mini parachutes from a Hercules aircraft called Snoopy. Each one radioed back the information; at nearly \u00a3500 a pop, it's not cheap, but they hope to generate crucial information about hurricane formation. </p> <p>The jet is spawned west of the Ethiopian highlands and is inherently unstable because of the difference in temperature of the lands it is travelling over: it could be as hot as 40 C over the Sahara, through to 26 C around coastal regions. When the cool, moist air from the Atlantic meets hot desert air, there is an unequal distribution of pressure causing waves to form. These waves are swept along by the remainder of the jet: they can be up to 3,000km long. </p> <p>There are a number of factors which change the wave from a benign weather system to something rather more sinister. One of the main factors is the temperature of the sea. If the wave is very low down, about a kilometre from the ground, it can grow by extracting energy from the warm ocean. Heat travels from the ocean to the wave, warming it and causing the wave to break off and begin to spiral in a vortex pattern. As the centre warms and increases in energy, more air is sucked in. \"It's like ice skaters bringing their arms in so that they spin faster,\" explains Thorncroft. </p> <p>The faster the cyclone spins, the more heat it draws from the ocean. The cyclone travels across the sea towards America picking up speed and energy and can grow large enough to become a hurricane. What can stop it is vertical shear - a strongdifference in wind speed between upper and lower levels. The current theory is that the temperature of the sea can be used to predict the maximum intensity of a cyclone, and although Thorncroft thinks this is a factor, he believes that the degree of vertical shear is also crucial. Once the cyclone gets to the US, it loses energy when it hits the land; even a hurricane will eventually fizzle out. Some head north and interact with weather systems from Europe. A big hurricane may reach the UK and can have a significant impact on wind and rainfall. </p> <p>The African easterly jet is also responsible for weather systems over Africa; thunderstorms swept in along the line of the wave - the amount of rain that falls is partly dependent on the temperature, and humidity of the wave itself. Little is known about individual waves since weather forecasts are based on the average wave, hence the difficulty in making accurate predictions. There is also a relationship between the rainfall in Africa and the development of hurricanes - when Africa is wet, the waves become stronger and more vigorous, and the pattern of vertical shear in the Atlantic changes: large amounts of rain reduce the temperature difference between upper and lower levels of wind, and thus change the vertical shear. As a result, wet weather reduces the difference between upper and lower levels, and this, Thorncroft thinks, is more conducive to the happening of hurricanes. </p> <p>Thorncroft and Parker hope that their data will not only help predict hurricane formation and drought patterns in Africa, but could also be used to update the current models. By making forecasts using European models with and without the data the team is gathering, it will be possible to see how accurate the models are, and if they can be improved. So far it is too early to tell, but as the data was collected, it was simultaneously broadcast back to the aircraft as well as on to the Met Office. By the time the scientists returned to their hotel, the weather forecast already incorporated the new data. Thorncroft and his colleagues flew through three storms, one of which went on to become a Hurricane Ernesto. Invaluable as this data is, collecting it was a one-off. </p> <p>\"It's the responsibility of every country to make observations and share them globally,\" says Thorncroft. \"But if our data had a major impact on hurricane prediction and on understanding tropical weather systems, would anyone want to pay to collect data routinely? It's in the interest of everyone,\" he adds.This may be, but obtaining global funding and co-operation could prove as difficult as getting an accurate weather forecast.</p>"
