  "Elderly people from the Pakistani and Bangladeshi communities in Britain are far more likely to suffer from multiple deprivation than their Indian or white contemporaries, according to a survey of the over-60s published yesterday by the office for national statistics. <p>It found 28% of older Pakistani and Bangladeshis were in households with no central heating that were more likely to suffer from dampness and condensation. And 38% lived in overcrowded homes with more than one person per room. </p> <p>They were almost three times as likely to live in a household without a phone than white, Indian or black Caribbean older people. </p> <p>The report said the ethnic dimension of social inequality among older people could no longer be overlooked. There were nearly 250,000 over-60s from ethnic minority groups, and this number was set to swell as these groups aged. </p> <p>The high point of immigration from the Caribbean was in the early 1960s. Immigration from India and Pakistan peaked in the early 1970s, and from Bangladesh and Hong Kong in the early 1980s. </p> <p>\"The proportion of older people within ethnic minority groups is expected to increase over the next couple of decades, as the first generation migrants from the different minority groups begin to retire,\" said the author of the report, Maria Evandrou of Kings College, London. </p> <p>On an index of multiple deprivation, the survey found 47% of Pakistani and Bangladeshi pensioners experience three or more types of disadvantage, compared to 42% of black Caribbeans, 26% Irish, 19% white and 13% Indian. </p> <p>Two-thirds of white elderly people live in owner-occupied accommodation, usually without mortgage commitments. Indian elders have the highest rates of owner-occupation (88%), but often with an outstanding mortgage. </p> <p>Black Caribbean, Irish and Pakistani and Bangladeshi older people were more likely to live in local authority or housing association accommodation. </p> <p>Black Caribbeans were least likely to live in a household with a car. Nearly two-thirds relied entirely on public transport, affecting ease of shopping and attending hospital. </p> <p>Just over a fifth of white and a quarter of Irish elderly people are in the bottom fifth of the income scale, compared to a third of the older black Caribbeans, half the Indians, and three-fifths of older Pakistani and Bangladeshis. </p> <p>\u0095 Shelter, the housing charity, warned yesterday that homelessness has reached record levels in England. Figures from the Department of the Environment showed the number of households living in temporary accommodation was 66,030 in the secondquarter, a rise of 11% on a year before. </p> <p>\"Households on low incomes are the innocent victims of the housing boom. As rents continue to soar thousands of households are becoming homeless. Our experience shows that temporary accommodation such as bed and breakfast hostels are totally unsuitable for nurturing stable family life,\" said Chris Holmes, the charity's director. </p> <p>Other official figures showed the number of homeless households living in bed and breakfast hostels was 8,380. </p> <p>Shelter said that while house prices were beginning to level out, soaring rents showed no signs of falling, leading to a shortage of affordable housing and homelessness for thousands of low-incomes families. </p> <p>The situation was particularly acute in London where rents have risen 62% since 1993 to an average of \u00a3285 per week for a two-bedroom flat. House prices in the capital now average \u00a3193,000. </p> <p>Shelter called for \"massive investment in decent affordable housing\". About 100,000 affordable homes per year had to be built between 2000 and 2011 to tackle the crisis, it said.</p>",
  "Leading Communist party officials went on trial today accused of smuggling and taking bribes in China's biggest corruption case in 51 years of communist rule. <p>Court officials said hearings began in five cities in the south-eastern province of Fujian. But they were unable to supply more information, as most court staff were banned from the courtrooms, while judges and prosecutors kept tight control on the proceedings. </p> <p>The secrecy illustrates the potental damage the scandal could cause to China's leaders. President Jiang Zemin, who heads the 61m-member Communist party, has declared clean government a goal of his rule.</p> <p>Among the unspecified number of defendants were the general manager of the Fujian-based Orient Group, Cao Xinghai, who went on trial in Putian. Court officials refused to specify the charges against Mr Cao.</p> <p>The Fujian scandal has tainted members of the elite ruling circle, among them one of Mr Jiang's proteges. The government has used occasional prosecutions of high-level officials to show the party's determination to end rampant corruption that has eroded support for communist rule. </p> <p>State-run newspapers today reported that the deputy head of transport for Sichuan province had received a death sentence for taking bribes and amassing wealth beyond his means. The court sentenced Zheng Daofang's wife and son to 15 and 12 years in prison and seized property worth \u00a3140,000. </p> <p>By contrast, no mention was made of the Fujian trials. At the centre of the trial is the bustling port of Xiamen and the Yuanhua Group. The company allegedly smuggled oil, cars and cigarettes through Xiamen and other ports and spent lavishly to buy official protection or silence. </p> <p>Cao Xinghai of the Xiamen-based Orient group and the 11 other defendants provided Yuanhua with certificates, seals and other \"conveniences\" allowing it to engage illegally in import-export trade, the Hong Kong Commercial Daily reported. In return, Mr Cao and the others were said to have received \u00a31.6m a year in rents and payoffs. </p> <p>Officials have called Yuanhua's web of smuggling and payoffs China's biggest corruption scandal. Homg Kong media have claimed that about \u00a36.2bn worth of goods and money changed hands illegally.</p> <p>Among those arrested in the investigation were the national police force's immigration chief, the provincial deputy police chief, two deputy Xiamen party secretaries, a vice mayor, the city's customs head and the official in charge of Xiamen's undercover police. Because of the number of defendants, the cases are being heard in courts in Xiamen, Fuzhou, Quanzhou, Putian and Zhangzhou.</p>",
  "<p>A short stroll down one stretch of the tidal reach of the Thames last Wednesday was illuminating. On the north foreshore, below the Royal Hospital in Chelsea, an eclectic group of people were gathered. Here, feet in the rising waters, keenly debating the need for land reform and the problems of the global and local environment, were the Queen's Asian chaplain, the bishop of Southwark, a Buddhist monk, a businessman, a journalist (myself), an artist, a Brazilian human rights worker, a baroness, a general and landowner, an MEP, a refugee, and the head of Amnesty International. </p> <p>With ducks looking on and the tide rushing in, the gathering of these 12 \"archetypal\" characters - under the auspices of the String of Pearls festival - was billed as the \"people's\" riposte to the UN social summit in New York. It was, most participants agreed, bizarre, symbolic and uplifting. </p> <p>The same day, a few miles downstream at Westminster, the Dome and its Thames-side were the centre of another furious political row, the doomed attraction having asked for - and been given- another \u00a347m to keep going. The government claimed the project was now about regenerating the local riverside community. </p> <p>At least one member of the Thames Waterside Regeneration project said the Dome had brought no discernible benefits for local employment or disadvantaged people, although Jenny Bates, of Friends of the Earth in Greenwich, disagreed, having seen marginal local returns of more than \u00a3750m. </p> <p>But the most optimistic view of the Thames that day came a mile downstream from Westminster, at Coin Street, the great and only central London community success story of the past 30 years. There, preparations were being made for this Sunday's Thames festival, the annual burgeoning celebration of the river and the communities who depend on it, love it or just happen to live by it. Christophe, the undisputed king pyro-artiste, following his millennium firework display on the Eiffel Tower, was in deep discussion with festival organiser Adrian Evans about how to light up the river and the city from 30 barges. </p> <p>Evans, in turn, was explaining that thousands of people, helped by artists and people from more than 78 community projects, would be walking in procession by lantern light in wild, river-related fancy costumes over Blackfriars bridge and down the embankment. </p> <p>Evans was upbeat. \"Most Londoners have a place for the Thames in their heart,\" he said. \"The river is becoming common ground. It now links London, rather than divides it. There is more respect for it by developers. It's as if we are revaluing the Thames for its 'riverness'. You can walk virtually the length.\" The Tate Modern, the London Eye, the millennium village at the Dome, the pagoda, the wibbly-wobbly bridge, and a bunch of new riverside developments allow access and have attracted people back. </p> <p>Much of this new awareness of the river as a resource for the metropolis and a source of pride, Evans and others believe, has been inspired by the great clean-up of the river. Human diversity has been found to improve when the ecology prospers. When the Thames was dead, Londoners turned away from it. Now that it is biologically alive people are flocking back like the birds. You can spot anglers, sailors, eel fishers, school parties and bishops nowadays on the river almost as easily as waders and ducks. </p> <p>It is a major reversal. Only 40 years ago a report to the Natural History Museum stated that there were no resident fish populations between Kew and Gravesend. Investment in sewage treatment cleaned up the water. Fish and wildlife began to reappear in the 1960s and the invertebrates in the 1970s. The small mammals still haven't made it, but there are 114 species of fish. </p> <p>But the river, like the Thames festival and the new cultural awareness of the river, is desperately fragile, say both the Environment Agency and Evans. The history of the Thames is for developments to extend further into the river foreshore, so further destroying its ecology. There are still few habitats along the tidal Thames. Only 1% of the tidal river now has a natural river bank and less than a third of its length has sloping, artificial banks. The rest is wall, limiting access, and increasing the river flow. </p> <p>Equally, the history of the Thames shows that human creativity has been snuffed out. Witness the depressing new housing developments along the river beyond Tower Bridge, uniformly elitist, mostly inaccessible, unwelcoming enclaves for people with several cars and huge mortgages. </p> <p>Yet improving the river, socially and ecologically, is a priority for many. The Thames has more interested par ties, watchdogs and \"owners\" than almost any other stretch of Britain. But, as river lovers point out, many institutions, councils, companies and others who want to promote access and sensitive development, are relatively powerless. </p> <p>An anonymous, undated article on the web sums up the situation. It is clearly written by someone who loves the river and knows its politics. The river, it says, is for sale. The Environment Agency, it accurately surmises, is under-staffed and under-funded, and only has power to advise. However much it may seek the agreement of developers to respect the the ecology of the river, it has weak legal status and only marginal influence on decision-makers. Many developers and councils are impervious to local opinion, have no environmental concerns, and \"pay lip-service to envi ronmental assessment, if at all\". Land owners such as Thames Water, British Gas and Railtrack, it accurately points out, still bear no statutory responsibility for ecological or social good practice. The Port of London Authority is not a statutory consultee in the planning process and as such does not see all river plans and cannot legally influence them. </p> <p>Equally, English Heritage has no remit to protect the Thames, and English Nature has very limited powers that relate only to statutory protected species. They have no overall powers regarding the cumulative impact of piecemeal development. </p> <p>Meanwhile, says Jenny Bates, of Friends of the Earth, the powerful London business community is trying to build three river crossings which would increase the traffic and intensify development in down stream riverside boroughs. \"Business argues that the river is a barrier and that London must work in a 360-degree circle,\" she says. \"They should, surely, be trying to meet local needs.\" </p> <p>So what would improve the situation? The anonymous author wants statutory protection of the Thames as a green corridor and a wildlife super-highway, and a change of planning emphasis away from the presumption to build. Educating planning officers, MPs and decision-makers is vital and there should be better cycle routes and more shore access. </p> <p>It will do for now. In the meantime, the Thames festival may have to wait a while before it can fully celebrate the return of the river to Londoners. </p> <p>\u0095 The Thames festival at the Oxo tower starts at midday on Sunday.

  "A German friend told me how she had once gone to see an English acquaintance at her workplace. <p>As she was taking off her coat she asked who the Africans were in the outer office. Her English acquaintance was nonplussed.</p> <p>\"Africans?\" she asked. \"Yes. You must know they're there - all those black people taking down files and writing out forms.\"</p> <p>\"Oh, them,\" said the Englishwoman. \"No. They're not Africans. They're British.\"</p> <p>My German friend says it was a moment that changed her whole outlook on a part of life.</p> <p>\"For the first time, I realised you could have a concept of citizenship that was completely separate from the idea of ethnic origin.\"</p> <p>Her anecdote is particularly relevant in the week in which a new commission, headed by the respected Christian Democrat politician, Rita S\u00fcssmuth, starts work on a what promises to be a lengthy review of Germany's laws on nationality and immigration.</p> <p>German, like Britain, has begun to suspect that it needs more, nor less, immigrants for its economic wellbeing.</p> <p>But in Germany, to a far greater extent than in Britain, the issue is bedevilled by the concept of citizenship which my friend had unwittingly carried around with her till the day she went to that office in London.</p> <p>But then it was only last year that a law was introduced by Gerhard Schr\u00f6der's centre-left coalition to break the bond between blood and nationality.</p> <p>It allowed foreigners to become citizens after living in Germany for eight years, provided they gave up their existing passport.</p> <p>Those who had been born in Germany of foreign parents could keep dual citizenship, but were obliged to choose which to keep by the age of 23.</p> <p>By the time it became law, the measure had been watered down in response to bitter resistance, including a petition got up by the opposition Christian Democrats.</p> <p>The new nationality law cost the Social Democrats, the senior partners in the ruling coalition, a defeat in the first regional vote to be held after their general election victory - a result which, in turn, cost them their majority in the regionally appointed upper house.</p> <p>Like my friend, Germans of all classes and persuasions had been conditioned by the fact that, for years, both main parties subscribed to the view that Germany - to use the stock phrase - was \"not a country of immigration\".</p> <p>It was thus neither feasible nor desirable for people to be both black and German.</p> <p>Or to be German and, say, Turkish or Serbian or Italian by origin. Even if you had been born in Germany and spoke accentless German, you could not be a German citizen unless your parents were.</p> <p>Yet the country was, and is, teeming with people of foreign origin. More than seven million of Germany's 82m inhabitants are what, in other countries, would be called immigrants. But not here.</p> <p>One group is made up of the workers from Mediterranean Europe who provided the cheap labour for the \"economic miracle\" and their families.</p> <p>For decades, the politicians sustained the myth that they would one day go home. They were thus not immigrants, but \"Gastarbeiter\" (guest workers).</p> <p>The other group was made up of those who had been accepted since. But they were let in as asylum seekers. The authorities knew full well that most were not genuine political refugees.</p> <p>According to official estimates, only five per cent of those who entered in the early 1990s were fleeing political persecution. But, again, the important thing was to sustain the idea that Germany was \"not a country of immigration\".</p> <p>One result is that Germans continue to refer to the seven million people of foreign origin in their midst, as \"foreigners\" or, at best, \"Mitb\u00fcrger\".</p> <p>At first, that sounds fine. Its dictionary definition is \"co-citizen\". But then, strictly speaking, \"Mitarbeiter\" means \"co-worker\", and in practice it is used as a euphemism for \"employee\".</p> <p>The unspoken tenent is that Germany's foreigners are in the country on sufferance. It is one that infuses all areas of life, as the setting up of the S\u00fcssmuth commission on immigration demonstrated.</p> <p>Until the fact was pointed out by irate leaders of the Turkish community, it had no one on it to represent the views of Germany's almost non-exisitent immigrants.</p>",
  "If all had gone according to plan, today, September 13, would have seen the birth of the state of Palestine, after a gestation period of more than 50 years. <p>But instead of a state - whose due date was delayed for the second time at the weekend - there is the birth of a strange new vocabulary, the creation of those trying to solve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.</p> <p>Their offerings include: divided sovereignty, joint sovereignty, shared sovereignty, delayed sovereignty, suspended sovereignty, functional sovereignty, custodial sovereignty and extraterritorial sovereignty.</p> <p>Because while the battle of sovereignty may seem archaic in an age of globalisation and free trade, this is the Holy Land, where religion, history and sacred sites complicate everything.</p> <p>The newly minted terminology is intended to apply to the Haram al-Sharif, as Muslims call it, or Temple Mount as it is called by the Jews.</p> <p>The site, within the walls of the old city of Jerusalem, is revered equally by Muslims and Jews, and claimed with equal passion by Israelis and Palestinians.</p> <p>The Haram, which contains the shimmering gold Dome of the Rock and al-Aqsa mosques, is the third holiest shrine in Islam, after Mecca and Medina.</p> <p>For Jews, it is the most sacred soil on the planet, the site of their temple, which was destroyed in 70 AD except for the Wailing Wall, and is visited by hundreds of worshippers every day.</p> <p>The panoply of definitions, which have come into wide circulation in the last two months, represent attempts by those trying to solve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict to strip the notion of sovereignty of its emotional charge.</p> <p>The logic behind the lexicon is to finesse the present understandings of sovereignty so that both sides can claim victory in the most intractable of their disputes, thus overcoming the single most formidable obstacle to peace in the Middle East.</p> <p>Today, Israeli radio talk shows invented yet another definition: vertical sovereignty. However, that may just be a fancy way of describing subterranean sovereignty.</p> <p>That would see the Palestinians declared the masters of the Haram al-Sharif from the ground up, granting them control of the plateau where the mosques stand, but leaving Israel in control of the ground beneath, where the ruins of the temple are believed to lie.</p> <p>Or humans could simply appeal to the almighty to take the whole dispute off their hands: divine sovereignty.</p> <p>That would grant God title to the Haram, leaving mere mortals with the task of delegating responsibility for such human concerns as policing, rubbish collection, and the issuing of renovation permits for the holy site.</p> <p>The inspiration for such creative solutions to the future dispensation of the Haram has come from some unexpected quarters - the frozen ice cap of Antarctica, a US naval base in the Caribbean, and the secessionist-minded Canadian province of Quebec.</p> <p>At one point, Israeli academics were considering the International Law of the Sea as a possible model for land-locked Jerusalem.</p> <p>The treaty assigns rights to oil, gas and fishing up to 12 miles beyond a country's shoreline - or \"functional sovereignty\".</p> <p>Then there is \"qualified sovereignty\" or \"relative sovereignty\", which describes the extra autonomy enjoyed by the Canadian province of Quebec.</p> <p>Although such ideas are engaging, many Israelis - including the former prime minister and Nobel peace prize laureate, Shimon Peres, has dismissed these efforts are word play.</p> <p>They are seen as far less benign by Palestinians, who accuse Israel of presenting these ideas as fancy formulas to prevent Yasser Arafat from exercising full sovereignty over all areas of East Jerusalem occupied by Israel since 1967.</p> <p>Some of the Israeli proposals would merely sanction the status quo, under which, Israel has exercised ultimate security control over the Haram, while the Palestinians, through the Muslim Waqf, or property trust, are in charge of daily administration.</p> <p>As might have been predicted, the welter of definitions has encouraged imitators, although some are less than earnest.</p> <p>When the idea of God's sovereignty, which was first raised by Jordan in the mid-90s was aired in the Israeli press, some commentators were less than reverential.</p> <p>\"Which God should get sovereignty? The Lord of Hosts, Allah or the father of Jesus?\" asked Zvi Barel, an Arab affairs columnist for Ha'aretz newspaper.</p> <p>\"Maybe the best idea of all would be to transfer sovereignty over the entire Temple Mount compound to the Disney company so it could build a Park of Holies there.\"</p>",
  "For a split second it looked as though a classical education in America was finally being given the respect it deserved. <p>The red carpet at the Staples Centre, home of the LA Lakers basketball champs and venue for last month's Democratic party convention, is being rolled out.</p> <p>CBS is going to broadcast the event live tonight and stars from around the world are flying in for the first Latin Grammar awards. </p> <p>At last, all those who had toiled over their Cicero and their irregular verbs are going to be honoured.</p> <p>On closer inspection, of course, this turns out to be the Latin Grammy awards.</p> <p>Recognising the enormous part that music from Cuba to Brazil and Puerto Rico to East Los Angeles now plays, Latin music is to have its first very own awards ceremony, coming hard on the heels of the Emmy television and the MTV music awards.</p> <p>The event is being organised by the three-year-old Latin Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences - it is always necessary to form an \"academy\" to bring due decorum to an awards ceremony even although no one ever studies at it.</p> <p>Those tipped for awards \"honouring musical excellence by artists performing in Spanish or Portuguese\" include everyone from Ricky Martin and Santana to Ruben Blades and Marc Anthony.</p> <p>But perhaps the choicest potential winner is in the Best New Artists Award: the Cuban star of the Buena Vista Social Club, Ibrahim Ferrer who made the recording for which he is nominated at the sprightly age of 72.</p> <p>At least he's not going to peak too early.</p> <p>Not that you need to be a Latino to win an award: the Latin refers to the genre of the music and not the ethnicity of the performer.</p> <p>But the arrival of the Latin Grammys on the scene could not have come at a more appropriate moment.</p> <p>This month for the first time since it became a state, California has a non-white majority.</p> <p>This historic and much predicted demographic shift has been accomplished mainly as a result of the arrival of immigrants from Mexico, El Salvador, Guatemala and elsewhere in Central America.</p> <p>They now account for 30 per cent of the population of California, 39 per cent in New Mexico and 29 per cent in Texas, which accounts for the fact that George W Bush now sprays his electoral rhetoric with so many \"amigos\" that he sounds like an American car salesman on his first holiday in Acapulco.</p> <p>Ten years ago there were 22m Latinos in the US. Today, there are more than 32m, a 45 per cent increase in a population of 275m. By 2050 it is estimated that there will be nearly 100m, an increase of 197 per cent.</p> <p>Since so many states - Florida, Colorado, Nevada, California, New Mexico, Texas - were originally Mexican, perhaps it is surprising that the shift has taken so long.</p> <p>Anyway, by 2050 the Latin Grammy awards may well have become the mainstream music awards.</p> <p>In the meantime, you can listen to <a href=\"http://www.calendarlive.com/latingrammy/\">audio clips</a> of the top nominees.</p>",
  "<p>As battles for control of middling-sized British corporates go, the antics surrounding the future of our glorious 200 year-old London Stock Exchange take some beating. </p> <p>Yesterday's admission that the merger with Deutsche B\u00f6rse is dead in its current un-thought-through form was inevitable. The whole idea was badly planned and terribly presented from the outset. </p> <p>With hindsight, one of the great howlers of the aborted iX deal was the idea that trading in \"growth\" companies go to Frankfurt, while blue chip trading was to reside in London. Who, one senior market man asked recently, might decide what is a growth company and what is not - since anyone who has the ability to spot them should have retired by now to somewhere warm and light on taxes. </p> <p>The deal was not thought through in advance. So it is little surprise to learn now that the exchange's management did not feel capable of fending off the hostile approach from Sweden's OM, while simultaneously selling (if that is the word) the London-Frankfurt merger to their shareholders, who also double up as their customers. </p> <p>The exchange is now a commercial business and has to play by the corporate rule-book. In turn, corporate precedent says that when a management sees its plans for the business trashed by the owners and then lands itself with an opportunistic approach from a predatory rival, the owners tend to move in and sack the managers. An experienced pair of hands is then installed who can be trusted with extracting value and/or rebuilding the confidence required to remain independent. </p> <p>In the case of the exchange, this is a bit tricky, since the new chairman, Don Cruickshank, was supposed to be the very man. (And anyway, David James is much too busy folding up that tent in south east London.) </p> <p>On the other hand, the position of Michael Marks, a board member and a grandee of the London stock market in every sense, is much clearer. It is untenable. </p> <p>Traditionally, the authorities (including the exchange itself and the financial services authority) have always frowned on City advisers who sit on the boards of corporate clients. Whatever the Chinese walls, there is perceived to be a potential conflict of interest. In the case of Mr Marks, his firm, Merrill Lynch, is the exchange's prime corporate finance adviser as well as its biggest customer. </p> <p>More to the point, whether he likes it or not, Mr Marks is credited as the architect of the iX merger. He should resign now before the shareholders vote him off the podium at Thursday's annual general meeting. </p> <p>But regardless of who sits around the exchange's boardroom table, mapping the future of this institution has not become any simpler after yesterday's events. The pressure for consolidation, in order to bring transaction costs down, is as great as ever. At the same time, there is no sign that the regulatory hurdles - where varying market rules, tax regimes, and supervisory structures in different jurisdictions make seamless cross-border equity trading impossible - are being dismantled. </p> <p>This is an area where a confident London Stock Exchange, in partnership with the FSA, should be taking a European lead. </p> <p>For all its flaws and technicalities and suspicious price movements, the London market remains rich in terms of integrity and practical experience - certainly when compared with any bourse on the continent. Sadly, rather than confidence, all any of us expect in the short term is more bureaucratic squabbling, with the occasional outburst of bluster. </p> <p><strong> Next lesson </strong><br> </p> <p>Just 18 months ago, Next's finance director David Keens declared that people who wanted to choose clothes on the internet were \"sad\". </p> <p>He dismissed the idea of putting the company's clothes catalogue online, because he thought Next's customers were too impatient to wait for pictures to download. Since Mr Keens' attack of foot-in-mouth disease, the group has put more than 1,200 pictures of shirts, skirts and jackets on the web. Next now expects more than \u00a320m of online sales this year. </p> <p>Mr Keens was guilty of underestimating the appeal of Next's unthreatening, classic clothes - even internet addicts want to get their hands on them. </p> <p>Others have made a similar mistake - it has taken the City years to come round to the company. </p> <p>Next has pulled off quite a feat by prospering while the rest of the middle-market has been suffering. Its secret is simple - each year it takes its unexciting range and just adds a few trendy twists. The company has stuck to one brand, avoiding the trap of diversifying into unknown areas. Others, such as Marks &amp; Spencer, should watch and learn.</p>",

  "The human race is set to vanish from the earth much sooner than it would naturally as a result of its destruction of other species and use of fossil fuels, a leading investigator into the history of extinction predicted yesterday. <p>Michael Boulter, professor of palaeobiology at the University of East London, told the British Association that without a catastrophic event such as the comet or asteroid strike which killed the dinosaurs 65 million years ago, mammals as a group could have expected to live for hundreds of millions of years before fading from the evolutionary scene. </p> <p>But the rate at which humankind has made other mammal species extinct since the end of the last Ice Age, argues Prof Boulter, amounts to the beginning of a catastrophic event in its own right. </p> <p>\"Humans are adding to the pace of the present mass extinction which will involve all large mammals and many other groups. We will be one of the extinguished species. The good news is that life on the planet will recover and peace will return to the environment.\" </p> <p>Prof Boulter and his group have produced a mathematical model of how groups of living organisms emerge, peak and become extinct. Typically, groups of animals diversify into multiple species rapidly, then slowly decline into extinction.This fits in with the records of fossils. </p> <p>But the recent rate - recent in geological terms, at least of large mammal extinctions was more typical of the sudden mass extinctions which have occurred five times in the earth's past. </p> <p>The two key periods in humankind's contribution to the extinction of the mammals were its hunting activities in the aftermath of the Ice Age and its recent use of fossil fuels. Asked whether humankind's unique ability to influence its destiny could be turned to save itself, Prof Boulter said: \"Look at the news. There's anger over the high price of fossil fuels. Cutting back on fossil fuels is the one thing human beings must do to stop extinction happening, but they won't do it, will they?\"</p>",
  "Thai police yesterday charged a British man for raping and conspiring to murder Kirsty Jones, the Welsh backpacker found strangled last month at a guesthouse in Chiang Mai. <p>Aram Chanphen, a police commander of the northern Thailand region, said that Andrew Gill, 32, co-owner of the Aree guesthouse, was arrested on the basis of scientific tests and witness accounts. \"We are confident we are on the right track,\" he said. \"There is no mystery any more.\" </p> <p>Ms Jones, 23, from Brecon in Powys, was killed at the guesthouse after a violent struggle on the evening of August 9. </p> <p>For overstaying his visa, Mr Gill was already in police custody in the city, 400 miles north of Bangkok.

One man said he shouted: \"Not guilty!\" as he was led from the cell he shares with more than half-a-dozen other detainees. </p> <p>General Chanphen said the police were still looking for an accomplice but did not name the suspect. Local media have reported that the other person involved is Surin Channetr, 47, the guesthouse manager. </p> <p>The arrest comes as a surprise since Mr Gill was cleared of involvement in the murder along with eight other foreigners and four locals when their DNA and hair samples did not match those found at the crime scene, Ms Jones' room in the \u00a31-a-night hotel. </p> <p>Ms Jones was found face down with a T-shirt knotted around her neck. Guests in neighbouring rooms said they heard shouting and a struggle the previous evening but dismissed the commotion as a lovers' tiff. Staff became suspicious the next morning when they found the room locked with a padlock on the outside. </p> <p>Mr Gill, who comes from south London, first attracted police attention when he disappeared the day the body was found. Witnesses said he was the last person seen with Ms Jones before she died. However, he later insisted he only ran away because he panicked about his visa. He was later fined 2,000 baht (\u00a336) for the offence and has been in custody since then. </p> <p>A British embassy spokesman said consular officials would visit Mr Gill today to ensure he had legal representation. The first court appearance may be within 48 hours. </p> <p>Mr Gill's friend added: \"This is unbelievable. There is no way Andy did this. This whole investigation has been a joke... I know Andy well, and he is just not capable [of doing it].\" </p> <p>The Thai police have been criticised for being disorganised. The senior investigating detective was sacked after a fortnight for failing to solve the case.</p>",
  "Sir John \"Jakie\" Astor, who has died aged 82 after a long battle against Parkinson's disease, won distinction in his second and third careers after being vilified in his first. He won his 1978 knighthood for contributions to agriculture, partly from the success of his 1,900-acre farm at Hatley Park, Bedfordshire, but especially as chairman of the Agricultural Research Council. <p>He won even wider plaudits for his key roles in the racing world, as a successful breeder with three establishments at Newmarket and many winners. He was a steward of the Jockey Club, and a member of the Tote and the Horserace Betting Levy Board, widely recognised for his outspoken good sense. </p> <p>Both these careers followed his rejection by the Conservative party for having been one of six Tory MPs who refused to support Sir Anthony Eden's 1956 invasion of Suez; like his older brother David, then editor of the Observer, he found it \"unnecessary and wrong\". </p> <p>Astor immediately found himself ostracised by his party and vilified by the Tory press. He discovered that the Conservatives were \"not a party but a regiment\", and announced he would not stand for the \"family seat\" of Plymouth-Sutton, which had been first occupied in 1910 by his father, William Astor, and then by his mother, Nancy Astor, the first woman to sit in the Commons. </p> <p>To be ostracised from any part of the establishment was a rare experience for an Astor. Although the first John Jacob Astor had been an 18th-century German migrant to the United States, he had made a fortune in the fur trade and invested it in Manhattan property - the basis of the Astor millions, even after his descendants transferred their affections to Britain, where they secured a barony and a viscountcy. </p> <p>Jakie himself was born at Cliveden, the youngest of the four sons of the 2nd Viscount Astor. He followed his father to Eton and New College, Oxford, where he first displayed his enthusiasm for racing. When he came of age, he received his first \u00a31m from his grandfather's will. </p> <p>He joined the Life Guards, but soon transferred to the Phantom Regiment, and later to the SAS. Although the excitement of frontline service appealed, his skills with signals equipment gave him key supporting roles in the 1942 commando raid on Dieppe, as a signals officer on a supporting destroyer. He ended the war as a major, with a military MBE, a Legion d'Honneur and a Croix de Guerre. </p> <p>On demobilisation, partly to please his mother, he agreed to fight her old Plymouth-Sutton seat. He failed by 924 votes in 1950 but succeeded by 710 in 1951, when the Conservatives returned to office. In the Commons, Jakie showed himself to be a liberal Tory, aligned with Peter Thorneycroft and RA Butler, and was one of the first MPs from his party to oppose capital punishment. He also sought to legalise gambling, and was an early pro-European. </p> <p>He married three times, first in 1944 to the late \"Chiquital\" Carcano, daughter of the Argentine ambassador; they parted in 1972. In 1976 he married Susan Sheppard; they parted in 1995. Then, in 1988, he married Marcia de Savary, who survives him, together with a son and daughter from his first marriage. </p> <p>\u0095 John Jacob Astor, farmer and horserace breeder, born August 29 1919; died September 10 2000</p>"
