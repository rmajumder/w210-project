  "Liberal Democrats are in pre-election mode. Normally a chatty and critical bunch, barely a delegate could be found in the bars last night who was prepared to pass judgement on their party leader, Charles Kennedy, in front of a journalist. <p>When pressed about Kennedy's low profile over the year and a bit since he took over from Paddy Ashdown, the most anyone conceded is that he's taken naturally to a softly-softly approach, deliberately appealing to voters who are tired of two-party squabbling.</p> <p>Well, up to a point. But while Kennedy's leadership of the party certainly hasn't been politics as usual, it hasn't exactly been all that much else, either.</p> <p>True, he's launched a leftish policy document that has gone down well with party activists and made sensible comments on asylum seekers, drugs and gay rights.</p> <p>He's also written a book (or, more accurately, had one written). But these are hardly daring moves for the leader of a progressive, reformist party. He's given little hint of what he really thinks of Tony Blair.</p> <p>So the big question underlying this week's conference is where Kennedy wants to go next.</p> <p>There are several scenarios. The rosiest is that Kennedy comes to thrive in the aftermath of the petrol crisis, appealing to voters sick of Tony Blair's apparent arrogance and unconvinced by William Hague.</p> <p>There are a lot of these and, if last weekend's opinion polls are to be trusted, the Liberal Democrats have made a start in wooing them.</p> <p>The party registered 21% in one poll, its highest rating for five years. This has thrilled delegates in Bournemouth.</p> <p>But as Kennedy admitted this morning in an emergency statement on the fuel crisis, much of this support has come by default, rather than been earned by the party.</p> <p>It's a revival of the Liberal Democrat's old role as a dumping ground for discontent. Now the party has to start winning support on positive grounds.</p> <p>And Kennedy's statement this morning did not encourage those who hope for this. After telling his party that policy should not be decided by \"who has got the loudest voice or who can bring things to a halt\", he backtracked and called for a cap on fuel prices and increased transport subsidies.</p> <p>This kind of thing points to another, less appealing, scenario for the party's future. It is of Kennedy leading a party of unfocussed protest, driven by the special interest groups such as teachers and local government councillors who already dominate much Liberal Democrat thinking.</p> <p>Still worse, he could come to be seen by the electorate as Mr Blair's stooge for more or less backing the government's line on petrol prices, and be punished accordingly.</p> <p>A strongly worded conference speech by Kennedy laying into the prime minister looks a wise move to avoid this.</p> <p>So this week in Bournemouth is make or break time.</p> <p>Kennedy could emerge as the leader of a successful radical party, cutting its way through new Labour's disenchanted support.</p> <p>Or he may relax, trusting that Tony Blair's mistakes and William Hague's unpopularity are enough to see him safely through the general election. The latter would be a mistake.</p> <p>Those who know Kennedy nonetheless wonder whether it might not be the course he chooses to take.</p>",
  "Charles Kennedy yesterday launched his campaign to woo moderate Conservative voters when he denounced William Hague for promoting a \"headcase agenda\" that merely appeals to prejudice. <p>Buoyed by a weekend opinion poll which put the Liberal Democrats on 21% - their best rating since 1995 - the party's leader believes he can repeat this year's spectacular byelection win at Romsey across southern England by sticking to his liberal instincts on key issues such as tax and Europe. </p> <p>As Liberal Democrat activists gathered in Bournemouth for their annual conference, Mr Kennedy's attack on the Tory leadership was notably more acerbic than his criticism of Tony Blair and his ministers for timidity and illiberalism since 1997. </p> <p>\"Disillusionment with the government is self-evident, but what we really must start confronting is the increasingly headcase agenda of William Hague,\" the Liberal Democrat leader told a pre-conference fringe meeting on a day when the government's trouble with petrol supplies pushed the Tories ahead of Labour in an opinion poll. </p> <p>Mr Kennedy called that a mere \"blip\" and said it was amazing the lead was not bigger. But Mr Hague had ignored a leader's duty to seek consensus beyond his own party on issues such as asylum, crime and school discipline. Instead he was \"bending to every passing crowd\", Mr Kennedy protested. </p> <p>The calculation that moderate Tories are open to Liberal Democrat wooing is a gamble since Kennedy strategists also plan to use this week to make the case for higher taxes to fund better public services. </p> <p>Yesterday Mr Kennedy said he \"does not give a damn\" if journalists say his pledge to raise income tax to 50% on \u00a3100,000 a year salaries puts him to the left of Labour. He was doing it, he told reporters, in the interests of social justice, so that health, education and pensions could be improved. </p> <p>Mr Kennedy will also embrace today's call in Bournemouth for the legalisation of gay marriage - \"civil partnership\" as the motion calls it. That, too, may alienate some Tories, although south coast resorts such as Bournemouth are increasingly keen on \"pink pound\" tourism. \"I am in favour of total equality before the law,\" he said yesterday. </p> <p>In an statement to the conference today on the fuel crisis he will offer a cap on petrol taxes - less than the cuts demanded by last week's pickets - in return for more of the revenue involved being spent on public transport and environmental improvements. </p> <p>That, too, may be a gamble with current public impatience. But Mr Kennedy said yesterday that Tory voters are as worried as anyone else about the costs of university education for their children and care for their elderly parents. \"They know you can't have something for nothing and we will get credit for being honest,\" he said. </p> <p>In skirmishes with party activists and the media in Bournemouth yesterday, he brushed aside calls for the party to quit its joint consultative committee with Labour - Paddy Ashdown's brainchild - on the grounds that not even Lord Jenkins of Hillhead now believes Mr Blair will push through electoral reform for Westminister along the lines proposed by the Jenkins royal commission. </p> <p>Mr Kennedy realises that he will not get referendums, this side of the election, on electoral reform or joining the euro. He says he believes in concentrating on \"what is attainable, rather than what is not\". </p> <p>Pressed on the euro issue, Mr Kennedy told activists during two question and answer sessions that Mr Blair had told him privately that he could take on a Eurosceptic media or a Eurosceptic public. He quoted the prime minister as adding: \"But I can't win a referendum with a Eurosceptic press and a Eurosceptic public.\" </p> <p>Mr Kennedy's answer to that was to urge the government to start winning over public opinion, as press barons such as Conrad Black and Rupert Murdoch will not budge. </p> <p>Bright sunshine and the prospect of little internal backbiting enhanced Mr Kennedy's optimism that he will get through his second conference as leader unscathed. \"The mood is upbeat and positive,\" he told delegates. </p> <p>In private session, the conference had earlier held a debate on plans to elect members of the party executive and policy making body by one member/one vote ballots, not by a vote of the conference.</p>",
  "<p><em>Tobin Michael Barnaby Bailey - Toby for short - is Northamptonshire's No.2 wicketkeeper. Last week he got a rare chance to step in for the rested David Ripley, in the Championship match at Worcester. Against a fired-up Glenn McGrath he hit 96* - his highest score, passing the 38 he made against Oxford Universities earlier this year in a game Northants lost. Bailey takes up the story</em></p> <p> \"I had a sneaky suspicion that I might be playing in the match because we had already won [the second division of the County Championship] and we had a big [National League] game against Gloucestershire on the Sunday. I had my suspicions that Bob [Carter] wanted to rest Rips [David Ripley]. Plus I'd been keeping very well in the second team and been getting a few scores.</p> <p>\"I didn't really feel nervous going into the team. I've played a few times this season and everybody is very friendly. There was a different atmosphere this time round, more of a party atmosphere. We were a bit confident - I suppose you are when you've won the second division of the County Championship. </p> <p>\"We lost early wickets to a combination of Worcester bowling and the wicket, which was a green seamer. If you've got Glenn McGrath bowling at even 75% he will bowl sides out. I had never played him before but of course you know all about him because you see him on TV. I've faced quicker than him but he is dangerous because he gets so much bounce because of his height. He doesn't bowl any bad balls either.</p> <p>\"He bowled quite a lot when I was batting. He was their trump card really and they hammered him into the ground. Worcestershire had to win to be promoted. When I first went in the ball was doing quite a lot, and myself and Tony Penberthy were just trying to survive really. We rode our luck, perhaps until we both got to about 30, then as the ball got older it became easier. Then the tailenders managed to help me get through and batted really well.</p> <p>\"My favourite moment was when Glenn McGrath had a few words with me and then tried to bowl me a bouncer and I hooked him in front of square for four. Then he set me up for the hook shot again and bowled me two four balls which I hit through the covers for four. That produced one long stare. I had played and missed a few times early on but this was just one of those days when everything came off. </p> <p>\"The only time I really thought about getting a hundred was when I was on 96. Darren Cousins was at the other end and I just thought, please hold on for another over so I can get my 100. I wasn't really disappointed at the time when he got out, but later when I thought about it, I was. It would have been my maiden century in first-class cricket. But it was more important for the side to get runs.</p> <p>\"There was a little bit of celebrating when I got in but then they knocked me down. You know what cricketers are like - just because you've got some runs don't think you can blah blah blah. </p> <p>\"I didn't make any mistakes behind the stumps and caught three good catches which was good, because you really want to show people what you can do. I've been keeping well all season, but nobody really gets to see it when you don't play on the bigger stage. </p> <p>I'd like to play for the first team next year but it is going to be very hard. David Ripley, the Northants wicketkeeper, is captain next year - so I've got my work cut out. I'll try to get runs in the second team: maybe I can get in as a specialist batsman. The Worcestershire second-team keeper [David Pipe] is playing as a batsman so there is no reason I can't do it. Would I consider changing counties? No.\"</p> <p><em>Toby Bailey was talking to Tanya Aldred.

  "The Pope reshuffled the Vatican hierarchy at the weekend, and commentators said the result favoured rightwingers who are lobbying to install a conservative successor. <p>Giovanni Battista Re, 66, a career Vatican diplomat who served as deputy secretary of state, was appointed head of the congregation of bishops, a powerful post likely to result in his elevation to cardinal. </p> <p>He replaced Lucas Moreira Neves, 75, a Brazilian who had been widely touted as the next pope before he resigned due to ill health. His departure has reduced the chance that the next pope will be from Latin America. </p> <p>Italian newspapers said the Re appointment was one of a number of signs that the right's influence was increasing as the health of the Pope, 80, steadily fails. </p> <p>The post to be held by Monsignor Re, an Italian, carries weight in conclaves, when cardinals meet in the Sistine chapel to choose a new Pope. The holder also helps to shape the future by influencing the appointment of bishops. </p> <p>Taking over from him as deputy secretary of state is Archbishop Leonardo Sandri, an Argentine who has served as the Vatican's representative in Venezuela and Mexico. </p> <p>Another sign of an emboldened conservative faction came last week when Cardinal Giacomo Biffi called on Italy's civil authorities to admit as immigrants only Roman Catholics, to preserve the national identity. </p> <p>He said: \"Italy is not a deserted land with no history or traditions that can be populated at random.\" </p> <p>Protests from leftwing politicians and some others in the church - who said the comments were rather at odds with the Pope's attempts to reach out to other religions - did not deter the Vatican from giving its backing. </p> <p>Cardinal Angelo Sodano, the Vatican secretary of state, said the comments were \"wise, very wise,\" and deserved to be \"understood, not twisted\". </p> <p>L'Avvenire, the organ of the church in Italy, also defended Cardinal Biffi.</p>",
  "<p>They call Wensleydale James Herriot country, but they are wrong. It's actually God's own country. Broad in the east, the valley of the river Ure becomes narrower as it heads westward deep into the Pennines and the best hill walking in England. But most people need a car to get there. </p> <p>It was not always so. Up until the 1950s, Wensleydale had its own railway, a branch line connecting Northallerton on the east coast line with Hawes Junction on the Settle-Carlisle line. However, the rise of the car as a form of mass transport and the decline of railways meant part of the line closed to passengers in 1954 and the rest followed in 1959. </p> <p>It is not hard to see why people living in Wensleydale are unhappy about rising petrol prices, which tend to be more expensive in the dale than in the more populous parts of the country. With no public transport alternative, higher fuel prices effectively represent a cut in living standards. This is something the local MP, one William Hague, is keen to exploit, posing as the champion of the motorist against a government that has lost touch with middle England. </p> <p>What's more, the government is worried sick that he might succeed. The rhetoric may be tough now, but there will be concessions to motorists and road hauliers in the budget. As it happens, there were concessions in the last budget - described by the AA as the best for the motorist in a decade - although that was conveniently overlooked last week. </p> <p>In the short term this may be justified by electoral politics; in the longer term a retreat from policies designed to raise the cost of pollution will be environmentally disastrous and bad for the economy to boot. </p> <p>The context for the fuel protests is not a world in which motorists are innocent victims, but one in which global warming is leading to a melting of polar ice caps and the threat that rising sea levels will lead to floods in low lying countries such as Bangladesh. Lower fuel prices mean higher demand for petrol and therefore increased C0<sub>2</sub> emissions. </p> <p>That's the bottom line, although there are other knock-on effects from rising car and truck usage - the increase in the number of cases of asthma, for example, or more deaths on the road. The car has killed more Americans than every war in US history; the protests last week appear to have been a real setback for saner environmental policies. </p> <p>There are two reasons why the government is now on the defensive - the less important being that farmers and truckers have a case. Figures show that higher prices are not that effective in cutting consumption, as demand for petrol is inelastic, with an increase in the price of 100% leading only to a 50% decline in usage. </p> <p>It is not hard to see why this is. Public transport is expensive, even when it is available. Not just in the Dales but in the suburbs as well, railway lines reflect the economic geography of the 19th century - heading in and out of city centres (especially London) rather than that of the 20th century, where people often live in one town and work across country. </p> <p>Ironically, many of those branch lines that seemed so anachronistic when Beeching axed them in the early 60s now look a lot more viable. The rail network cannot soak up demand displaced from the roads. Decades of under-investment in public transport means that train companies cannot put on extra services but have to squeeze more travellers onto the same number of trains. </p> <p>But there is a more important reason for the government having always been a bit wobbly when it comes to the environment. As Michael Jacobs, the director of the Fabian Society said in a pamphlet last year, New Labour associates environmentalism with ideas that it rejects, and believes that the majority of the public don't like them much either. </p> <p>\"As has now become familiar, New Labour identifies strongly - and wishes to be identified in the public mind - with ordinary families and their desires to get on in life. It sees environmentalism as at best an irrelevance to ordinary people, at worst as actively hostile to them. While middle England drives cars, enjoys shopping, wants material things and more foreign holidays, greens find consumption distasteful and their enthusiasm for curbing the car is symptomatic of their indifference to ordinary people's lives and opinions - something of which New Labour cannot be accused.\" </p> <p>All this might sound a bit harsh on the government. After all, it has introduced the climate change levy (albeit watered down after intensive lobbying from business), increased the fuel escalator to 6%, has introduced tax breaks for smaller and less polluting cars, and has announced a \u00a3180bn 10-year transport programme. But Jacobs is right. Deep down, the environment does not fit with the new Labour mindset. There is confusion between the sense that the environment is a big issue that over the long term cannot be ignored, and the short-term need to keep motorists, truckers and the Daily Mail off its back. That is why the transport white paper pulled its punches and proposed more road building. </p> <p>Labour's real problem, as was so blatantly obvious last week, is that it does not have a convincing story to tell. Extra billions in tax revenues have been rolling into the Treasury but the motorist and the road hauliers do not seem to have much to show for it. There has been a half-hearted attempt to show that dearer petrol means a better NHS, but absolutely nothing to suggest that it is part of a long-term strategy to make the environment an integral part of Labour's modernisation programme. </p> <p>This looks a long way off. Chris Hewett, of the Institute for Public Policy Research, said in the latest edition of New Economy that ministers are obsessed with raising labour productivity but pay for too little attention to the need for improved efficiency from natural resources. He believes the government sees \"a false trade-off between prudent use of natural resources and economic progress\". </p> <p>Far from being opposing forces, environmentalism and modernisation are two sides of the same coin. If we do not revolutionise industry to make it greener the future looks bleak. To harness new technologies to make cars lighter and use cleaner fuels - such as fuel cells - is not only environmentally sound but modern and progressive as well. </p> <p>There are signs that a revolution in the automotive industry is coming, with cars made of lightweight but ultrastrong fibres rather than metal. Far from wasting resources trying to defend the indefensible, the government should be looking at an industrial policy that would involve serious investment in sustainable technologies - set to be one of the big growth areas in the west as environmental concerns move up the agenda - and regulation policies that encourage car and energy companies to speed up the transition to leaner and greener production. </p> <p>Mr Hewett says that Britain's expertise in offshore engineering skills could be used to develop a manufacturing base in offshore wind technology, but failure to provide help to solar panel manufacturers means that energy companies are going to the continent instead. </p> <p>What are the chances of the government getting to grips with a serious environmental agenda that would see the greening of industry as an opportunity and not as a threat? About as much chance as there is of Whitehall cash for those campaigning to reopen the Wensleydale branch. Many of us nurture dreams of the day when we can change at Northallerton, potter up Wensleydale to Garsdale (the old Hawes Junction) before cruising down across Arten Gill and Dent Head on the Settle-Carlisle to Blea Moor tunnel and the Ribblehead viaduct. </p> <p>There's no harm in dreaming, because one day they may have to come true. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:larry.elliott@theguardian.com\">larry.elliott@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "The wave of arrests of suspected members of the Basque extremist group Eta spread through south-west France at the weekend with police taking into custody 11 people who are alleged to include important arms and logistical experts for the group. <p>Six of the detainees were suspected Eta members, police said. They were taken in for questioning after arrests at homes in and around the south-western town of Bayonne. Police also said they found two large weapons caches whose contents included dynamite and detonators at farms in the Landes region, and a small weapons factory at nearby town of Sare. </p> <p>The raids followed the arrest on Friday of Ignacio Gracia Arregui, suspected of being Eta's supreme leader, at a beachfront villa in Bidat, near Bayonne. Two daysearlier, police in Spain had arrested 20 people in raids in Madrid, the Basque country and Navarre. </p> <p>Eta's political aim is independence for the Basque region, but it has come to be associated with terror and extortion. Its independence campaign has claimed the deaths of nearly 800 people since 1968. </p> <p>The authorities are cracking down now because since Eta ended a 14-month truce last December, it has been blamed for 12 killings, eight of them since June. </p> <p>The French prime minister, Lionel Jospin congratulated his interior minister, Daniel Vaillant, the police forces and magistrates involved in the operation against Eta: \"They have done long and patient work which is today crowned with success. The government repeats its determination to fight against all forms of terrorism and will continue to cooperate fully with the Spanish authorities.\" </p> <p>Police sources were reported to have claimed that among those arrested on Saturday night were Eta's chief of logistical equipment, Jose-Luis Turillas Aranceta, and Angel Picabea Ugalde, said to be in charge of exporting arms over the French border into Spain. </p> <p>Two more of those held, Ignacio Santestaban Goicotxea and Jesus-Maria Zabala, were alleged to be explosives specialists. Two others were suspected Eta activists. </p> <p>Eta's notion of a Basque homeland extends beyond the semi-autonomous Basque region of Spain, into Navarre and up to the Bayonne river in France. </p> <p>The anti-Eta operation in France came just a day after police in Spain said they had foiled an apparent assassination attempt against King Juan Carlos. Eight grenade launchers were found in a wood close to the Basque town of Hernani just hours before a visit by the king, the prime minister, Jose Maria Aznar, and the German chancellor, Gerhard Schr\u00f6der.</p>",
  "You probably think the Olympic Games is a vastly important event for all of us Australians, a huge national rite that will \"put us on the map\" - the same map, presumably, on which the last Australian Olympics, in Melbourne in 1956, failed to inscribe us. Actually, despite our traditional obsession with sports, despite the coercive drumming of pre-Olympics hype, some of us don't care that much about the Olympics. We think we matter for other reasons. We suspect we're on the map already. <p>Australians tend to be natural pagans. Everything favours this: the delicious climate of the coasts; the dramatic and seductive landscapes of pounding surf and golden sand; the tanned bodies strutting; the food (some of the finest in the world); and the wines, which are superb. In such a setting, Australians have evolved a natural ethos as pleasure seekers in all areas of life. As the writer David Malouf points out, we don't even think of ourselves as hedonists, because that would be too self-conscious. Australian culture is for the most part deeply democratic, and joyously so as well. It is no longer \"provincial\", a distant and nervous response to norms generated in imperial centres. It is the result of a bloodless and slow-developing social revolution conducted over 40 years as a small society grew larger and immeasurably more complex, shook off its sense of derivative Englishness and its fear of American domination, and learned to trust its own talents. </p> <p>But a reasonable equipoise is with us only some of the time. Jingoism still disfigures the lowbrow end of our journalism. \"One of the ways in which we have matured is that we don't give a stuff about what other people think,\" blustered the columnist Susan Mitchell in the Australian, a national daily, last month. \"We no longer feel we have to explain ourselves to anyone but ourselves.\" </p> <p>This dismal, Serbian-style solipsism was actually meant as self-praise. But on some levels it is, alas, true. One sees it, for instance, in the bristling posture of denial that the Australian government recently took against UN criticism of its flouting of the human rights of aborigines. Australians still tend to be worried about what outsiders think, keep asking and then get furious if the answer is even fractionally less than flattering. </p> <p>Australia is often seen, especially in the US, as the last stand of the wild west, the place and ethos that were buried in America a century ago: a celluloid fiction, reinvented with kangaroos. In reality, Australians are among the most urbanised people on earth. They have seen their national animal, the kangaroo, only in a zoo or as roadkill on the highway. Nearly 90% of Australians live on the coast, not in the outback, wherever that elusive place may be. Our country towns are in decline. Their inhabitants keep moving to the coast. Because Australia has no fertile centre, there is no place for them in that immense, empty outback. </p> <p>So the \"typical Australian\" is not, as foreigners once thought, a bushman. He is a slightly worried guy with a tan, a bald spot, a mortgage, a mower and two kids, whose Australian dream is a double-front brick bungalow on a quarter-acre lot in the suburbs less than 30 minutes' drive from the nearest beach, with two other nice, two-kid, one-PC families on either side of him. </p> <p>And yet there are traits that do, indisputably, come down to modern Australia from the vanished days of the bush, and even from the convict era. They are wound tightly into our social history. One of these is the value set on \"mateship\". Essentially male bonding, mateship began in the harsh world of the penal settlement. It continued in the hardly less tough environment of labour that was the lot of most men in the bush: shearers, station hands and shepherds. To have a mate was to survive; to betray that mate was to be a scab, less than a man; such was the hard calculus of colonial life, and its traces are very much alive in Australia today. </p> <p>A less admirable trait is the Australian fetish of anti-elitism. If you want to nuke an enemy, call them an elitist, especially if they are an intellectual. The word is empty, since no society has ever been able to function without elites of skill, intelligence and ordinary competence. Yet Australians can rarely bring themselves to say they value human superiority. It sounds undemocratic. </p> <p>The one field of exception to this unseemly prejudice is sport, the real religion of down under. The idea of non-elitist sport is, of course, an absurdity. No Australian would waste their time watching a football match in which nobody was better than anyone else, or a horse race in which every nag plunked along at exactly the same speed. And, of course, Australians find no contradiction in that. Ours is the meritocracy that dare not speak its name. </p> <p>Some Australians will tell you they have a classless society. This is the merest fantasy. We began with the most ironbound of all class distinctions, between prisoners and the free. The freeborn (the \"sterling\") were bitterly opposed to giving up their social placement above the ex-convicts and their children (the \"currency\"). But the \"lower orders\" fiercely resented the pretensions of the nobs and were well aware that in a pioneer environment lady luck was a more powerful queen than Victoria Regina. Today's Australians may be more sophisticated than the 19th-century digger with his pockets full of gold dust, but at root the dot.com millionaires of the late 90s are not so different from their mining ancestors. The metaphor of all wealth production is gambling, and Australians are among the most shamefully obsessed gamblers in the world. We have 20 times as many \"pokies\" - poker machines - per person as the Americans. Our styles of wealth production enforce the belief that superiority is luck and only luck: no moral lessons apply. </p> <p>We are poor at symbolising ourselves. Many of us would like to snip the union jack off our flag, but no one can agree on a new design. Our official Olympic mascots and emblems are kitsch, climaxing last month in the Great Medal Screwup. It turned out that all the Olympic medals had been designed to feature not the Parthenon in Athens, not even the Temple of Zeus at Olympia, but the Colosseum in Rome, less noted for Olympic-style friendship than for gladiatorial butchery. What the hell, the officials of the Sydney organising committee of the Olympic Games apparently reasoned; it's still the ancient world, right? Then it befell some luckless Socog flunky to claim it wasn't meant to be the Colosseum, just a colosseum. Nice try, kid. It was too late to make new medals. </p> <p>Apart from the kangaroo, the koala and other enchanting marsupials, Australia seems short of identity icons. There is, of course, Ayers Rock, the most sublime stone on earth. There is also the incomparable Great Barrier Reef, a single coral organism some 1,250 miles long. We have two famous structures, both in Sydney: the harbour bridge and the opera house, the latter a masterpiece by the Danish architect Jorn Utzon. Perched on one of the world's most beautiful sites, a headland in Sydney Harbour, and surrounded on three sides by sapphire water, this great building was never seen in completion by its architect. He resigned under stress and never came back to Sydney, so that the promise of those lovely tiled arcs and shells is not fulfilled by the interior, awkwardly finished by a local designer. </p> <p>Where it counts - which is more in production than interpretation - Australia has a vigorous cultural life. The list of first-rank Australian novelists, headed up by Murray Bail, Peter Carey and David Malouf - writers of exceptional power and social insight - is a considerable one. It has also produced a brilliant biographer and diagnostician of past culture in Peter Conrad, an erudite and dark-minded expatriate from Tasmania. Books, of course, circulate everywhere, whereas paintings and buildings do not. Consequently major architects such as Glenn Murcutt and Philip Cox are little known outside Australia. This is a pity, and even worse is the general ignorance of Australian contemporary painting. It is bizarre that artists as excellent as John Olsen, Colin Lanceley, Tim Storrier and Mike Parr aren't the world figures they deserve to be. The only Australian art that attracts much overseas attention is contemporary aboriginal art, which varies enormously in quality. </p> <p>The clarity of Australian cultural achievement is often muddied by our most irksome cultural shortcoming: a peevishly insecure hatred of \"tall poppies\", people distinguished by their achievements in any area. Australia has never honoured its artists, intellectuals, writers and musicians as fully as its sports figures; there is always an undertow of resentment, of the lowbrows' residual suspicion that the highbrow is conning them. Everyone bitches about this; nobody does anything about it. It is hardwired into us, a proof of \"toughness\". </p> <p>Under valued culturally, Australia is also politically obscure. Why? Because we're so well behaved. We are not the mouse that roared. Historically, we have rarely even contemplated roaring. As the former prime minister Paul Keating has pointed out, Australia has always been short of the defining value systems that are gained through conflict. We have never had a civil war or a revolution. We have never been invaded - though we nearly were during the second world war, by the Japanese. Nobody has ever called us a Great Satan or even a little one. We tend to like Americans more than most nations do, although we do not have the least desire to be like them. </p> <p>Historically, Australia felt little resentment about its colonial control by Britain and its sovereign. Its population was heavy with Irishmen and Irishwomen, but the resentments their ancestors had brought with them soon mellowed into ineffectuality in the antipodean sun. As a colony we were content to fulfil our destiny, which was to supply Britain with cheap wheat, wool and (when required) cannon fodder for wars against the Boers or the Huns. </p> <p>In these, we had little or no stake of our own. Britain, with grim enthusiasm, condemned us to assist in the creation of dead colonial heroes. In the first world war, Australia lost 59,258 young men out of a total of 330,000 sent abroad. Both as a proportion of troops killed or missing and as a proportion of the national population, this was the highest figure for any allied state. </p> <p>It left us in the 20s as a psychologically devastated nation of widows, spinsters and orphans. This enormous death toll was rationalised as a cleansing, an erasure of the inherited stain of the convict era. Winston Churchill, who sent our grandfathers to die on the implacable slopes of Gallipoli, was by no means the only Englishman to think they came from \"tainted\" stock. </p> <p>Australia still had a largely colonial mentality when I was born, in 1938. Only vestiges of it survive today. The most important of these relics is, of course, its monarchy. It is a bizarre fact that no Australian can be the country's head of state. That role is reserved for the king or queen of England, by definition a foreigner, and not even an elected one: the office of the Australian head of state remains purely hereditary, open only to a small clan of Anglo-German squillionaires known as the Windsors. This narrows the field of talent. </p> <p>According to the Australian constitution - a document written for us by the British at the turn of the century - it is ultimately the British monarch who rules Australia through an unelected viceroy, the governor-general. This official may be Australian or may not. They may, on behalf of the King or Queen, cancel any law enacted by the Australian government or even throw out the government and call for new elections. Or they may not. In practice they almost never do. The last and only time they did was in 1975, when the governor-general, Sir John Kerr, fired the Labor government led by Gough Whitlam. </p> <p>This caused shock and resentment. Millions of Australians felt that Whitlam, their hero, the great reformer of government policy in the domains of race, immigration, foreign policy and the arts, had been stolen from them. There are still plenty of people around who regard this as not far from a coup d'\u00e9tat. </p> <p>The firing of Whitlam made many Australians sit up with a jerk. It had never occurred to them before that the Queen had the raw constitutional power to do such a thing. It cranked up the long-dormant impulse toward republicanism. Until the 70s this had been an issue only for intellectuals and a few leftwing workers whose vehemence earned them an undeserved reputation as ratbags (obsessed eccentrics). The problem was democratising the republican issue while detaching it from the ownership of the Australian left. And it did slowly broaden, though its main political instrument, the Australian Republican Movement (ARM), didn't come into existence until the 80s. </p> <p>The growth of republican feeling in Australia coincided with, and was strongly encouraged by, the prime ministership (1991-96) of Keating, a brilliant and abrasive Laborite much feared for his insults (\"pansies\" and \"unrepresentative swill\" were among the milder epithets he launched at his foes in parliamentary debate) and greatly misunderstood for his tastes: given his passions for antique French clocks and Georgian furniture, Keating was the most cultivated Australian ever to serve as prime minister. The ARM's chief unelected backer was a formidable young merchant banker named Malcolm Turnbull. (Full disclosure obliges me to say that Turnbull is married to my niece Lucy, herself the deputy lord mayor of Sydney.) Despite Keating's defeat in the 1996 elections, Turnbull and his fellow republicans were able to bring the republic issue to a nationwide vote last year. </p> <p> The result was a triumph of electoral timidity, worsened by fake populism. By a queer flip-flop of logic, a majority of Australian voters (55% to 45%) decided that to have an Australian president appointed by a democratically-elected government was elitist and unsafe, whereas to have an immensely rich hereditary monarch as their head of state was somehow democratic. </p> <p>The monarchists won the referendum, not because Australians were devoted to the Queen and her successors but because feuding republicans couldn't agree on which model of republic to uphold. Should the new-style head of state, an Australian president, be appointed by parliament? Or should they be elected in a national campaign, in the American manner? The ARM wanted the former, but Australians hated the idea of an American-style republic - or American-style anything - in their public life. This split the republican vote, to the boundless relief of the monarchists, who could never have carried the issue on their own. </p> <p>Soon after the referendum, the Queen and her cold fish of a consort, Prince Philip, toured Australia. The crowds were small and more curious than enthusiastic; the media polite but indifferent. The romantic, near-mystical queen worship that had surrounded her tour in 1954 was gone forever. Being smarter than the monarchists, the Queen could easily read the signs. She openly acknowledged the possibility of a stable republic in Australia. </p> <p>The current prime minister, John Howard, is an obdurate monarchist. But the next in line as head of his conservative Liberal party, Peter Costello, is a republican. The Australian Labor party is republican through and through. It is only a matter of time before the less reactionary and nostalgic Liberal politicians come out of the closet, and then the monarchy in Australia will be finished. </p> <p>It is hard to say why, apart from habit, there should be any nostalgia for royal forms among Australians, especially when we are so fond of our national anti-elitism. But people, including Australians, want figures to admire. \"If we don't have the Queen, whom can we look up to?\" was one of the frequent complaints at referendum time. The thought that in a democracy you don't look up to your superiors, but sideways at your fellow citizens, wasn't much aired in monarchist circles. And Australia has always been short not only of convincing shared ceremonies of national identity but also of shared folk heroes. You can count them on the fingers of two hands. Two are alive - the great cricketer Sir Donald Bradman, now 91, and the swimming champion Dawn Fraser. The veterans of Gallipoli, a few of whom still live, are invested with a collective heroism. The other heroes are dead. They include a racehorse, Phar Lap; and a criminal, the bushranger, Irish nationalist and proto-republican Ned Kelly, hanged for theft and murder in Melbourne in 1880. </p> <p>Another reason why some Australians want to keep the monarchy is unease about mixture. The Queen evokes the loyalty and gratitude of the \"pure\" Anglo-Australian because she personifies \"pure\" Britain. This worked fine half a century ago, when more than 90% of Australians were still of British descent and could feel themselves to be, as the then prime minister Robert Menzies would later put it, \"British to the boot heels\". But today the picture of exclusionary Australia, the continent-size British island just below Asia, has almost faded away. The white Australia policy, that disgraceful provision whereby no one of Asian or black descent could settle in Australia, was abandoned in the 60s, never to be revived. Whole suburbs, such as Cabramatta in western Sydney, have become south-east Asian enclaves. Though Australia admits only some 85,000 legal immigrants a year, the Asian component is very visible and it excites xenophobia. The role of the Queen as head of state has a calming effect, suggesting that the \"old\" Anglo-Australia is still notionally within reach. </p> <p>Compared with their older selves, Australians - especially the younger ones - are a tolerant people. We are one of the world's most successful multicultural democracies, and this is a triumph of no small consequence. Australians on the whole realise that multiculturalism, that forbiddingly bureaucratic polysyllable responsible for so much hot air, really means learning to read other people's image banks, not a forced renunciation of one's own. They realise, quite naturally, that the desire to \"give people a fair go\", which is one of the traditional moral imperatives of Australian life, also applies to immigrants. </p> <p> This does not, however, mean that Australia's road to multi-culturalism has been stoneless. Translated into government policy, multi-culturalism in the 80s became, its critics say, not just a neutral recognition of diversity but a pork barrel for buying the temporary loyalties of ethnic groups. </p> <p>Maybe, but it doesn't ultimately matter. Immigration has done its work. It has changed Australia irrevocably. Nobody old enough to remember the dullness of its old monocultural cuisine can regret that. The British empire has gone. The Commonwealth is no longer, to put it mildly, a decisive linkage between nations. The Australia Act of 1986 formally defined Britain as a foreign country. Australia's economic links to Britain, though not insignificant, are small and dwindling in comparison with its trading ties to the near north, once known as the far east. </p> <p>Britain is in the EU and will act in accordance with its interests there, giving no priority to Australia. Australians who feel they are British because they speak English are fooling themselves but no one else. You can no longer \"be\" Australian and, without conflict, \"feel\" British. The two nations are too far apart. </p> <p>\u0095 A longer version of this article appears in this week's Time magazine.

  "Two charities claiming to promote international Catholicism have close links with a neo-Nazi political group and an Italian fascist, according to a report published by the charity commission today. <p>The damning report found that the sister charities, the St George Educational Trust (SGET), and the Trust of St Michael the Archangel (TSMA), have got a \"close association\" with International Third Position (ITP), a far-right group that opposes third-world immigration to Europe, Zionism, and homosexuality.</p> <p>Both charities have had their assets frozen pending the conclusion of the investigation.</p> <p>In breach of the Charities Act, neither charity has filed accounts for the year ending March 1999. They have been served with an order requiring them to file accounts by October 12 or face a contempt of court charge.</p> <p>Roberto Fiore, a fascist politician and businessman, is a trustee of SGET. The charity commission found that his company, Meeting Point, had received payments from TSMA. The money was for rent owed on the charity's shop on Shirland Road in Maida Vale, west London.</p> <p>In 1985, Mr Fiore was sentenced in Italy, in his absence, for being a member of the political wing of the Armed Revolutionary Nuclei, a fascist terror group. The group was implicated in the Bologna bombing of 1980, which killed 85 people.</p> <p>The commission also found that at one stage ITP and SGET operated from the same premises while TSMA was funding renovation work in Los Pedriches, an abandoned Spanish village, which ITP was occupying with the aim of creating a white nationalist community and training centre for volunteer soldiers.</p> <p>\"While in each case the trustees say that these matters are entirely coincidental, the only reasonable conclusion is that a close association exists between the charities and the ITP,\" says the report.</p> <p>The commission concluded that the charities' financial and management controls were \"weak and needed considerable improvement\", and that TSMA's involvement in Los Pedriches had given rise to legitimate public concern. The charity's trustees claim to have ended the link with the village.</p> <p>Members of ITP began moving to Los Pedriches, 60 miles from Valencia, in 1996, 15 years after the inhabitants had moved out. Seven of the village's eight houses were purchased by foreigners. According to TSMA, accounts of about \u00a37,000 for construction and renovation work came from the charity.</p> <p>Mr Fiore, who fled to the UK in the early 1980s, is national secretary of Italian fascist party Forza Nuova, whose logo appears on the ITP website. Mr Fiore denied he had links with ITP but said he sympathised with its ideas. \"I recognise that fascism is good on certain issues,\" he said. Asked whether he supported repatriation of black people, he said: \"There is a fundamental lack of natural justice if people are brought to live in different countries to where they were born. Everyone should be staying in the place where they live; it is wrong to have Islamic immigration to Italy and thank God in Italy we recognise that.\"</p> <p>Asked why he did not live in Italy, Mr Fiore said: \"You know my history. I am here on the principle of asylum.\" As an EU national he does not need asylum to remain in the UK. Attempts to extradite him in the 1980s failed.</p> <p>The charity commission began its investigation following newspaper reports establishing links between the charities and the far right. Interim findings are being published because of public concern.</p> <p>Mr Fiore was suspended as a trustee of SGET in 1997 but following an investigation by the commission was cleared last year to resume his trusteeship.</p> <p>Simon Gillespie, director of operations at the charity commission, said the links between the charities and ITP was unacceptable. \"Important issues have been raised in this case. We expect all trustees to be open and honest with us and in their dealings with the public. If our investigations show that people have tried to mislead us, we would view it very seriously.\"</p> <p>Under the Charities Act, misleading the charity commission can lead to two years' jail.</p> <p>Mr Gillespie added: \"The close links of these two charities with an organisation such as ITP is totally unacceptable and we look to both charities to distance themselves completely to avoid suspicion.\"</p> <p>\u0095 Iran Aid, a charity that once raised \u00a35m a year for the country's victims of human rights abuses, has been shut down by the charity commission after a two-year investigation. Allegedly donors' cash for Iranian refugees went to Mojaheddin el Kalq, a group reputedly linked to terrorist activities in Iran. Iran Aid, set up in Barnet, north London, had been accused of aggressive fundraising tactics, and in 1998 its accounts were frozen. About \u00a3600,000 of its money will now be transferred to Iran Aid Foundation, a new charity.</p>",
  "Polly Toynbee (OK, keep on trucking, September 14) asks why the Green party wasn't on the streets protesting against the lorry drivers seeking cheap fuel. Some of us were doing what we were elected for: pressing the European parliament to take on board climate change. <p>In the same summer that scientists found water at the North Pole where for 50m years there's been ice, I was steering a report through the European parliament arguing for the introduction of environmental charges and taxes on the aviation industry to encourage airlines to reduce the CO2 emissions. The report was agreed by the parliament by an overwhelming majority on the day the fuel protests started. Why wasn't the Guardian telling its readers about this sensible step forward? </p> <p>The Greens are pressing the government not to back down in the face of the misguided fuel protests. The royal commission on environmental pollution is proposing that the UK reduces its greenhouse gas emissions by 60%. Now is the time for the government to take the lead in showing how neither air passengers nor road hauliers and private motorists pay their way since the tax take from transport does not cover all the resulting costs of roads, accidents, damage to buildings, chronic respiratory illnesses and climate change causing flooding and changes to agriculture. <br><b>Caroline Lucas MEP</b><br> Green party </p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p>\u0095 Liberal Democrats believe that the government must be more open about the money it receives from fuel and how it is spent. Taxes on fuel should not be a back-door way of raising revenue - they should be used to reform the tax system to protect the environment. Because revenues raised have not been returned to the travelling public, we have voted against increases in fuel duty by both Labour and the last Conservative government. We also believe that oil companies should not be allowed to exploit those reliant on personal transport in rural areas. </p> <p>We call on the government to: place a cap on fuel taxes (in real terms) for five years so that the government does not profit from future increases in fuel prices; use the VAT windfall that it has received from the higher than expected fuel prices to ease the burden on the travelling public (it should not be used to boost the chancellor's pre-election war chest); ensure that oil companies recognise their social responsibilities, both in respect of pricing and security of supply (if they fail to do so, we will take measures to tax their excess profits); and support people in rural communities who rely on fuel through rate relief on rural fuel stations and increased investment in community public transport. <br><b>Matthew Taylor MP <br>Don Foster MP <br>Dr Vince Cable MP<br>Charles Kennedy MP</b></p> <p>\u0095 I agree with William Hague, that we must have fair taxation of fuel if UK road hauliers are to compete with their European counterparts. The commonsense way to do this would be through a unified taxation policy throughout the EU devised to take account of environmental issues.

  "<p>When Bernard the paedophile gets a toilet thrown through his front window in <strong> My Fragile Heart</strong> (ITV, Sunday), you know things are getting really nasty. Not that things weren't unpleasant before. Adultery on a bed of sofa cushions, burgeoning teenage sexuality in the woods and a shortage of ice in the home of Trina's alcoholic mum (she took to using frozen peas instead), these are not recognisable traits of cosy Sunday night drama. (Indeed, the closest Heartbeat got to anything as disturbing as this was when Charlotte Church pitched up at Yuletide, as welcome as the Grinch who stole Christmas). </p> <p>The adultery and frozen peas were only tangentially linked to the toilet (unplumbed) in Bernard's living room, since its presence was due to the murder of a young girl. Shannon, as typical a 12-year-old as you'd find, was found dead, and perhaps sexually assaulted, in circumstances alarmingly similar to a crime of which Bernard was found guilty some 15 years ago. Only Bernard's conviction was a miscarriage of justice and he hadn't done it at all, but such a minor detail didn't stop most people leaping to the conclusion that he had struck again. Hence the toilet, a tense chase through battalions of pristine toilets fresh off the production line in the factory where he worked and, predictably, a crowd of banner-waving protestors outside the police station where he was being held. All of which made My Fragile Heart both topical and, more importantly, excellent drama. Only Trina wasn't convinced he had murdered Shannon, and that might have had something to do with the fact that Trina was played by Sarah Lancashire. </p> <p>Leading this exemplary cast, which included Lorcan Cranitch as Bernard and a flurry of actors more famous for appearing in Brookside, Hollyoaks and Coronation Street, Lancashire was incandescent as ever. With every subtlety of Trina's emotions flickering across her wonderfully expressive face like candlelight dancing on fine china, she delivered a powerful, understated performance entirely in keeping with the pared down, grown-up nature of writer Abi Morgan's words. Morgan's grasp of the intricacies of how people, young and old, talk, and what they actually mean, her storytelling and her truthful vision of a world full of grey areas, not to mention her ability to glide effortlessly between humour and terrible tragedy, mark her out as an honest and talented writer. Her achievement is all the more impressive as she makes Stoke, surely the Aberdeen of England, seem so electric, so charged. </p> <p>If you take the tube from Walford East, you eventually end up in Holby, a city that expands with every passing series of <strong> Casualty</strong> (BBC1, Saturday). Now in its 15th series, and with Charlie recuperating from his toilet escapade (not the same as Bernard's, or indeed George Michael's), he did a tour of Holby's boatyard, read its newspaper and visited its police station. This suggested we are being prepared for three new series - Holby Harbour, Holby News and Holby Beat, perhaps. </p> <p>Charlie's travels only served one purpose however: to remind him where home was: his work. As two teenage burglars got what they deserved - steam burns and a big bit of glass stuck in the leg respectively - Chloe, who speaks as though she's got a hot chip in her mouth at the best of times, was particularly shrill after her room was robbed, and Duffy stated the obvious (\"I wasn't born yesterday!\") Down Holby, the more things change, the more they stay the same. Next week, as the accidents get more outlandish, someone will come in with injuries caused by a flying toilet. Perhaps. </p> <p>Portentously, there was a petrol shortage in <strong> Other People's Children</strong> (BBC1, Sunday). Frazzled Nadine's Lada had ground to a halt on a country road and her husband had used all of his fuel running the children back to her in Herefordshire after a disastrous Christmas day. Only Dale, zooming about in her black Rover and weeping into her mobile phone, had plenty, but no surprise there. Dale, a Bette Davis with blonde highlights, is the kind of girl who thinks she deserves better and will do anything to get it. Her heart shot through with an icicle, her newsreader-esque stepmother-to-be Elizabeth got a frosty enough reception to suggest the woman should fasten her seatbelt. A bumpier ride awaits.</p>",
  "Tens of thousands of white southerners are reported to be joining organisations that seek independence from the rest of the US, claiming that the federal government no longer represents \"southern values\". Opponents say these neo-confederate groups are allowing militant and racist whites to organise politically under the guise of a heritage movement. <p>Last week the Southern party, which advocates secession, won its first mayoral victory, in a village in Alabama. </p> <p>The party is an offshoot of a group called the League of the South, which says there has been a surge in its membership as white southerners become disillusioned with the \"multiculturalism\" of the main parties. The league is led by academics and cites as its inspiration such separatist movements as the Northern League in Italy. </p> <p>Mark Potok of the Southern Poverty Law Centre, which has just completed a report on the growth of the southern movement, said it was \"providing a veneer of moral legitimacy for people who would be embarrassed to join the [white supremacist Ku Klux] Klan\". </p> <p>\"White supremacists do not always come wearing Klan hoods, shaved heads or storm trooper outfits. Sometimes they boast business suits and PhDs,\" he said. </p> <p>The growth of the movement became apparent earlier this year when South Carolina bowed to national pressure and transferred the battle flag of the Confederacy from the dome of its statehouse to a nearby monument. Many see the flag as the symbol of a civil war fought to preserve slavery. </p> <p>\"[The new-confederates] were bitterly angry about that,\" Mr Potok said. \"That was a big loss.\" But flag issue gave them the chance to recruit whites who felt increasingly estranged from mainstream politics. </p> <p>The League of the South is led by a former history professor, Michael Hill, whose office is in Tuscoloosa, Alabama. Formed in 1994, it has about 9,000 members. </p> <p>It and other neo-confederate groups point to the break-up of the Soviet Union, the separatist Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois movement in Canada, and the Northern League in Italy as examples of what is possible. </p> <p>As the League of the South is not a political party, some of its members formed the Southern party, which now has 2,000 members. Last week Wayne Willingham, 37, became its first successful candidate in a mayoral election, in the village of West Point, Alabama, where he beat the incumbent by a single vote. Mr Willingham described himself as \"just an old country boy who's tired of things being done the way they are\". </p> <p>The other main body in the southern movement is the Council of Conservative Citizens, which has about 15,000 members. It recently deplored on its website a music festival in Charleston, South Carolina, as a \"multicultural mudbath [which] attracts mostly queers and weirdos\". </p> <p>The Southern Poverty Law Centre's report, Rebels with a Cause, lists 14 different groups which it says operate in 25 states, mainly in the south, to promote the confederate cause. They include the Heritage Preservation Association which has declared \"total war\" on those who attack southern values and culture, and the Confederate States of America, a group which would like to repeal laws that gave citizenship to blacks and votes to women. </p> <p>The main theoretical journal of the movement is called American Renaissance. It is edited by a white separatist, Jared Taylor, a board member of the Council of Conservative Citizens. The magazine promotes such notions as blacks having smaller brains and the dangers of non-white immigration. </p> <p>The Edgefield Journal, \"the only true southern nationalist newspaper\", is the other main publication; a recent piece suggested that \"many slaves were willing to be slaves\". </p> <p>The groups are represented in court by Kirk Lyons, a lawyer who shows his affection for the \"Anglo-Celtic\" roots of the movement by dressing up periodically in a top hat and kilt. He has described Hitler as \"probably the most misunderstood man in German history\" and is now the chief lawyer acting on behalf of the Southern Legal Resource Centre, which is the movement's legal arm. </p> <p>Mr Potok says he accepts that not all who have joined the heritage movement are racists. \"But a scene once dominated by civil war re-enactors and those who maintain Confederate monuments is turning increasingly ugly.\" </p> <p>Michael Hill is dismissive of Mr Potok's centre and its report, seeing the centre as a \"snooping organisation for the federal government\" out to \"feather its own nest\". </p> <p>The league was mainly interested in preserving the \"symbols, language, cuisine and music\" of the south. </p> <p>\"We are seeking to preserve a distinct regional culture,\" Mr Hill told the Guardian, \"and we believe in political independence\". While he agreed that independence might be unrealistic now, he said that \"in five, 10, 50 or 100 years\" it could happen. </p> <p>Mainstream politics did not address the League's concerns. \"The Democrats and Republicans are two sides of the same coin. There's not a dime's worth of difference between them.\" </p> <p>\"The US government ... interferes in virtually every aspect of everyday life. Rather than \"sitting around wringing our hands\", he said, they were getting organised.</p>",
  "She has greasy hair, horn-rimmed glasses and braces on her teeth, but throughout Latin America, Beatriz Pinzon is the undisputed queen of prime-time television. <p>The protagonist of the Colombian soap opera, I am Betty, The Ugly One, is an unlikely heroine in a culture obsessed with Barbie-like beauty queens. </p> <p>But the story of the dowdy secretary who outsmarts her superiors and rescues her boss from bankruptcy has become a Latin TV phenomenon. </p> <p>Every night some 28m Colombians - 70% of the population - tune in to the show, which also dominates ratings in Mexico, Chile, Peru, Ecuador, Panama, El Salvador, the Dominican Republic, El Salvador, and on Spanish-language TV in the US. </p> <p>In Colombia, each twist in the storyline makes front-page news. In Ecuador last month, Congress members suspended a late-night debate for half an hour to watch the programme. </p> <p>The show's success seems at odds with its simple premise: a comic story about an over-qualified yet unprepossessing secretary who loses in love, but makes a fortune on the stock market. </p> <p>But where most telenovelas depict aspirational fantasies about the rich and famous, I am Betty, The Ugly One reflects the reality of Latin America's growing urban middle classes. </p> <p>\"Normally, the heroine is a blonde babe. She's beautiful and rolling in money, or she's a poor orphan but she discovers that she's been left a fortune by her mother. Betty is like an ordinary person - she works in an office just like mine,\" said secretary Gitsy Martinez, a fan. </p> <p>In a society which fractures along social and ethnic lines, the story taps a nerve, said Betty's creator, Fernando Gaitan. \"The poor in Latin America have Indian features, while the rich look more like Europeans. The rich are considered beautiful but the poor are ugly and rejected.\" </p> <p>The plot centres on an ailing fashion house, which is rescued from the liquidators by the efforts of Betty. </p> <p>\"Latin American soaps are all about the class struggle. They're made for poor people in countries where it's hard to get ahead in life. Usually the characters succeed through love. In mine they get ahead through work,\" said Mr Gaitan. </p> <p>None of which quite explains why the producers chose a beautiful actress to portray Betty. Make-up artists spend at least 40 minutes each day making Ana Maria Orozco sufficiently plain for her part. </p> <p>\"We had to have a good-looking woman playing The Ugly One, because only she could show what it's like to be ugly. Somebody who's born like that would be too close to her own character. And besides, she had to be pretty, just in case Betty gets a makeover at the end of the series,\" said Mr Gaitan. </p> <p>\"All soaps are fairy tales - this one is a cross between Cinderella and the Ugly Duckling,\" said director Mario Ribero.</p>"
