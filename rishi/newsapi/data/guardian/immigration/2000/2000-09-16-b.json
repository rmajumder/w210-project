  "<p><strong> Why:</strong> Tepoztl\u00e1n is an ancient town north of Mexico City, on a plateau surrounded by mountains. It only has one main street, but it is the most magical place because it has 600-year-old pyramids dotted on the mountains - apparently, they have perfectly equal sides, down to a millimetre. In Mexico, there is a wonderful juxtaposition between ancient civilisation and modernity. You are constantly reminded of the past but also of the present and the future. So, as well as these pre-conquest pyramids and a 16th-century monastery, there is some brilliant modern architecture. In short, it is a distillation of Mexico's past, present and future with beautiful shapes and pink and orange colours. </p> <p>I went last year and stayed in a little parador. It was incredibly still and I had the most amazingly vivid dreams. The indians say that it is due to the mineral wealth of the mountains, but I think it might either be because you are high up or because of the contrast between the pollution of Mexico City, the clean air and being so stimulated by the colours. </p> <p><strong> What's the best thing?</strong> Sitting in the town, you can look up to the pyramids on the mountain and take in the old from the new. </p> <p><strong> My advice:</strong> Stay in a local parador. Walk through the streets at dusk. The shapes, the sounds and the colours are so vivid against the presence of the mountains. </p> <p><strong> How do I get there? </strong> Journey Latin America (020-8747 3108) offers return flights with American Airlines to Mexico for \u00a3309 plus taxes from October through to the end of November.</p> <p>\u0095 Colour by Judith Miller is published by Marshall at \u00a325.

  "<p>Brazil is the sleeping giant of global tourism. It is the world's fifth largest country, has the world's largest rainforest (the Amazon), the world's largest swampland (the Pantanal), thousands of miles of tropical beaches, and an enviably rich musical, culinary and architectural heritage. </p> <p>Just the sort of place, you might think, to go on holiday. </p> <p>But Brazil has never fulfilled its potential. It is a baffling statistic that tourists travel in far greater numbers to Argentina, which is several hours further away by plane and offers arguably less variety of activity. </p> <p>The last available figures show that in 1998 4.8 million visited Argentina, compared to 3.1m for Brazil. Britons, too, prefer Argentina to its larger, northern neighbour. </p> <p>Brazil's consistent state of underachievement can, in part, be explained by its poor infrastructure, itself partly the result of its own vastness. There is also the perceived threat of violence in cities such as Rio de Janeiro. And it doesn't help that in Brazil people speak Portuguese instead of the more visitor-friendly Spanish. </p> <p>However, this year the giant has begun to stir. A mixture of unconnected factors, such as the country's 500th anniversary of its sighting by Portuguese sailors and the rise of the supermodel Giselle Bundchen, have generated a new wave of international interest. </p> <p>This month sees the launch of a tourist resort near the north-eastern city of Salvador that aims to be the first major package destination for European and north American travellers. Tour operator Unijet is offering packages to Brazil for the first time next year. </p> <p>Without a doubt, the Costa do Sau\u00edpe resort is causing travel companies to look at Brazil through different eyes. Airtours will next year begin direct flights to Salvador from Gatwick in order to service the resort. At present, all scheduled flights come into the country via the business centre S\u00e3o Paulo, adding several hours to most tourists' journeys, so the Airtours flight will be opening up a part of Brazil previously only known to committed travellers. </p> <p>Salvador and the Costa do Sau\u00edpe are both in Bahia, a state the size of France that has a diversity of attractions - from colonial cities to fishing villages, from deserted beaches to spectacular canyons. It is waiting to be explored. </p> <p> An hour's drive north of Salvador's international airport, Costa do Sau\u00edpe is an ambitious attempt to build a Cancun-style resort. </p> <p>The builders claim it is the largest tourism development in South America. So far it has cost more than \u00a3120m and includes two five-star and three four-star hotels. Capacity is 4,000 rooms, although this will be expanded to 10,000. </p> <p>Costa do Sau\u00edpe is situated in a beautiful and hitherto-undeveloped stretch of coastline. The emphasis from the beginning has been on pre serving the ecosystem as much as possible. During construction, the builders relocated 32,000 plants and 586 animals, including a rare sloth. </p> <p>One part of the resort is designed in the colonial style of the old town in Salvador. Special hybrid grass was developed for a golf course that the managers hope will eventually attract a leg of the PGA tour. </p> <p>The resort offers sports such as tennis, beach activities, nightlife and shopping facilities. There will also be concerts of Bahian music and other demonstrations of Brazilian culture. </p> <p>The Costa do Sau\u00edpe information line is on 00 55 71 354 9696. English is spoken. </p> <p> Salvador was the first capital of Brazil. It was also the main arrival port for slaves being imported from the Portuguese colonies in Africa. As a result, it has the highest proportion of black people in Brazil and, not unnaturally, is the centre of Afro-Brazilian culture. </p> <p>The old town is a square mile of cobbled streets, colonial buildings and baroque churches. At night, restaurants spill out on to the pavement, bands play live music and groups of drummers march through the streets. Every night is good, although Tuesday nights and weekends are busiest. </p> <p>During one week at the end of February, Salvador is home to the most exciting carnival in Brazil. Millions of people follow floats around three circuits all through the day and night. The atmos phere is so hedonistic that it is virtually impossible not to have a passing amorous fling. </p> <p>Salvador is also the best place to sample Afro-Brazilian cuisine. The fish and seafood stews should be gulped down with a ice-cold rum-and-coconut cocktail. </p> <p>A popular and cheap hotel is the Hotel Pelourinho (00 55 71 243 2324), which is in the centre of the old town. An option near the centre but by a beach is the Marazul (00 55 71 264 8200). </p> <p>Traditional restaurants for Bahian food include Barga\u00e7o (00 55 71 231 5141) and Yemanj\u00e1 (00 55 71 231 5770) </p> <p> A 20-minute flight in a tiny plane from Salvador airport takes you over the Bay of All Saints to the island of Tinhar\u00e9. The only real settlement is Morro de S\u00e3o Paulo, a small village that is the favoured destination for Bahia's monied classes. The beaches at Morro de S\u00e3o Paulo can get quite crowded but a short boatride away you can find miles of deserted sand. </p> <p>The only means of transport on the island is by tractor, which will meet you off the plane and trundle you along the beach to your hotel. </p> <p>If you prefer to avoid the crowds altogether, half an hour away on a motorboat is Boipeba, which has a handful of places to stay and is blissfully tranquil. Like most of the other beaches in Bahia, the sea at Boipeba is particularly warm and clear. </p> <p>At Morro de S\u00e3o Paulo, the best equipped place to stay is the Villegaignon Resort (00 55 75 783 1010). On Boipeba, try the Pousada do Outeiro (00 55 74 9972 1535). </p> <p>Flights can be booked with AeroStar at Salvador airport (00 55 71 204 1335). The return fare is about \u00a360. </p> <p> Ilh\u00e9us is the town that chocolate built. The centre of Brazil's cocoa-growing region, it used to be one of the most prosperous cities in South America. Its residents built themselves a belle-\u00e9poque town hall and a neo-classical cathedral. </p> <p>It still produces cocoa but has been overtaken by Africa in terms of the level of production and the city is inhabited by poor workers rather than chocolate barons. Yet it maintains a decadent charm and is worth a visit. </p> <p>There are nice beaches in the city and nearby, but chocolate remains the reason to come here: for the Cocoa Museum or the chance to see a cocoa plantation in the surrounding countryside. </p> <p> Porto Seguro means \"safe port\", and it was here that the Portuguese dropped anchor in April 1500. As a result, it became the focus this year for Brazil's 500th birthday celebrations, together with demonstrations by indians who, for obvious reasons, claimed it was anything but a reason for rejoicing. </p> <p>The first place where the Portuguese stepped ashore was at Coroa Vermelha, around 10 miles north of Porto Seguro. The area is now owned by the Patax\u00f3 indians but can be entered without permission. A metal cross stands a few metres from the shore to mark the place where the first mass is reputed to have been held on the South American continent. </p> <p>Between Porto Seguro and Coroa Vermelha, the coast road is lined with cheap hotels. Driving south from Porto Seguro, the road turns into a dirt track and leads to Arraial d'Ajuda and Trancoso, which hip and hippyish travellers have turned into Brazil's equivalent of Thailand. </p> <p>Slightly further south, the impressive Monte Pascaol completes the sights of the heavily-marketed \"Discovery Coast\" - history records that the mountain was the first piece of land spotted by the sailors when they stum bled upon Brazil. </p> <p>There is no shortage of places to say in Trancoso and Arraial d'Ajuda, both of which are more laid-back than Porto Seguro. Try the Pousada Verde Agua (00 55 73 875 1453) on the beach at Arraial. </p> <p> Bahia, like Brazil in general, has its population and industry concentrated along a thin coastal strip. Inland, you get a completely different picture: much less developed and full of open spaces. If you only go to one place away from the coast, go to the Chapada Diamantina national park, a stunning area of canyons, caves and waterfalls. It is one of Brazil's main adventure tourism destinations and offers mountain-biking, horse-riding, caving, abseiling and trekking. </p> <p>The scenery is untouched and the small colonial towns are not as yet overrun by karabiner-wielding athletes, so one can enjoy the natural beauty and tranquility at ease. </p> <p>The Chapada has a reputation as a magical place that has enchanted many foreign visitors. Jimmy Page, the former Led Zeppelin guitarist, has a house in Len\u00e7\u00f3is and his image adds to the laid-back, tree-hugging vibe. </p> <p>Flights to Len\u00e7\u00f3is go from Salvador and cost from \u00a360 return (Nordeste 00 55 21 507 4488). A good option for a hotel is the Canto das \u00c1guas (00 55 75 334 1154). There are several agencies offering guides and equipment.</p> <p><strong>The practicals </strong></p> <p>Airtours (0870 9008639) flies direct to Salvador from Gatwick in nine hours.

  "<p> <strong> Katharine Viner</strong> </p> <p><strong> Estimated total: \u00a3600</strong></p> <p> I was in need of a quiet, beachy holiday with as little activity as possible, so went to stay with my friend Jack in his family's apartment in Gozo, a small, beautiful island off Malta. Thanks to Jack's generosity, this was not a holiday that broke the bank, but I do get a bit carried away when faced with the two words \"duty-free\". </p> <p><strong> What I spent</strong></p> <p> <strong> Flights: </strong> BA to Malta \u00a3260. </p> <p> <strong> Clothes: </strong> Three summer dresses (Selfridges, Top Shop) \u00a3150; new bikini (Selfridges, didn't wear) \u00a340.</p> <p> <strong> Books: </strong> Philip Roth, Janis Joplin biography, Anita Desai \u00a340.</p> <p> <strong> Extras: </strong> Legs and bikini wax \u00a330; suntan lotions (Nivea, Factor 15, 12, 8, plus after-sun) \u00a335; sun-protecting shampoo and conditioner (Kerastase) \u00a315; mosquito repellent and cream (Superdrug) \u00a310; breakfast at airport \u00a34. </p> <p> <strong> Duty-free on the way out: </strong> CDs (inc Craig David with free video, Bob Dylan, Beach Boys, Cardigans, UK Garage and Ibiza compilations) \u00a380; perfume (Armani) \u00a340; vodka and cointreau for holiday \u00a320. </p> <p> <strong> Transport: </strong> Cab to airport \u00a326; cab from Malta airport to ferry \u00a312; share of jeep hire, plus petrol \u00a354; cab from ferry to Malta airport \u00a312; cab home \u00a328. </p> <p> <strong> Accommodation: </strong> \u00a30. </p> <p> <strong> Basics: </strong> Kitty for the week \u00a3150; share of utilities \u00a329. </p> <p> <strong> Entertainment: </strong> Dinner for three \u00a330; entry and drinks in the Grotta nightclub \u00a315; beers out (total for week, rounds at 30p a bottle) \u00a315. </p> <p> <strong> What I bought on the way home: </strong> Presents (wine, nougat, sarong for Mum) \u00a340; British newspapers at airport \u00a35; duty-free moisturiser (Clarins) \u00a330; duty-free kalhua and rum \u00a320. </p> <p><strong> Real total: \u00a31,190 </strong><br> </p> <p> <strong> Verdict: </strong> It was more than I thought I'd spent, but worth every penny. And I still have the Craig David CD to dance to in my bikini. </p> <p> <strong> Will Woodward and Rachel Cooke</strong> </p> <p> <strong> Estimated total: \u00a32,000</strong></p> <p> It felt expensive before we left, mainly because of \u00a3680 for a week's stay in an (admittedly delightful) house overlooking Meloi beach in Patmos. But we spent money like Greek mineral water, and usually can't be bothered to check it. Was it a cheap holiday? No. Did we need it? Yes. </p> <p><strong> What we spent</strong><br> </p> <p> <strong> Flights: </strong> Heathrow-Athens-Rhodes, Olympic Airways, \u00a3646 for two. </p> <p> <strong> Clothes:</strong> Two swimsuits \u00a324, three T-shirts \u00a315, new beach towel \u00a310. </p> <p> <strong> Books:</strong> Rough Guide to Greek Islands, Carol Shields, Raymond Chandler, Adhaf Soueif, Sybil Bedford, JK Rowling, Martin Amis \u00a348.93. </p> <p> <strong> Extras: </strong> Insect repellent \u00a34; copy of the Guardian at airport \u00a30.45. </p> <p> <strong> Transport: </strong> Early-morning mini-cab Hackney-Heathrow \u00a330; Heathrow Express to Paddington x 2 \u00a324; cab Paddington-Hackney \u00a316. </p> <p> <strong> Accommodation:</strong> House in Patmos for seven days,<strong> </strong> \u00a3680. </p> <p> <strong> Paid on credit card: </strong> Meal in Rhodes \u00a348.86; unnecessary tip \u00a37.58. </p> <p> <strong> Money taken out of cash machines: </strong> Heathrow \u00a3202.61; Rhodes \u00a3187.02; Patmos \u00a3357.03. This was spent on: </p> <p> <strong> Accommodation: </strong> Four nights in hotels in Rhodes \u00a3185; three nights in hotels in Patmos \u00a3140. </p> <p> <strong> Transport: </strong> Taxis in Rhodes \u00a310; taxis in Patmos \u00a33; hydrofoil, Rhodes-Patmos, Patmos-Rhodes \u00a380. </p> <p> <strong> What we bought out there:</strong> </p> <p> Hat and swimming trunks \u00a320; after-sun cream \u00a33. </p> <p> <strong> Activities: </strong> Entrance to Patmos monasteries \u00a315; opera tickets \u00a314, sun lounger rental \u00a316; internet access \u00a32. </p> <p>The rest was pretty much food and restaurant bills - we ate out every night save for about three nights at our house in Patmos; there we had breakfast in every day and lunch in about five days. </p> <p><strong> Real total: \u00a32,301.48</strong><br> </p> <p> <strong> Verdict: </strong> Cost-wise, it was on the high side for a holiday with very little sightseeing action. But it was worth it. </p> <p> <strong> Andrew Gilchrist </strong></p> <p> <strong>Estimated cost: \u00a31,600 </strong> </p> <p> I spent two weeks in Thailand (trekking round the hills up north, scuba-diving off the southern islands, boozing in Bangkok) then a week-long bender in Hong Kong staying at a mate's. So, it was never going to be cheap. </p> <p> <strong> What I spent </strong></p> <p> <strong>Flights: </strong> London-Bangkok return \u00a3693; Bangkok- Chiang Mai rtn \u00a360; Bangkok- Ko Samui rtn \u00a3110; Bangkok-Hong Kong rtn \u00a3120. </p> <p> <strong> Books: </strong> Rough Guide to Thailand, Stalingrad \u00a326; <strong> Extras: </strong> Money belt \u00a35; shiny glasses case with snazzy pop-up lid \u00a312. </p> <p> <strong> Transport: </strong> Tube to Heathrow \u00a33.50. </p> <p> <strong> Accommodation in Chiang Mai: </strong> One night in crappy hostel with door hanging off hinges \u00a35; two nights in hotel (4-star) \u00a360. </p> <p> <strong> Transport: </strong> Tuk tuks (taxis) \u00a320. </p> <p> <strong> Activities: </strong> Three-day trek to hill tribes \u00a340. </p> <p> <strong> What I bought: </strong> Nike sandals \u00a35; fake Oakley shorts (fell apart the same day) \u00a35; mosquito sprays \u00a310; camera and films \u00a3150. </p> <p> <strong> Entertainment: </strong> Thai boxing show \u00a35. </p> <p> <strong> Food and drink: </strong> \u00a360. </p> <p> <strong> Accommodation in Ko Pha Ngan/Ko Samui: </strong> Seven nights' accommodation \u00a3120. </p> <p> <strong> Activities: </strong> Four days' diving \u00a3200. </p> <p> <strong> Food and drink: </strong> (inc Full Moon beach party all-nighter) \u00a3100. </p> <p> <strong> Transport: </strong> Boat crossings \u00a310; tuk tuks \u00a320. </p> <p> <strong> Accommodation in Bangkok: </strong> Two nights in hotel (inc mini bar) \u00a340. </p> <p> <strong> Activities: </strong> Dismal city boat trip \u00a38; massage \u00a35. </p> <p> <strong> Transport:</strong> Tuk tuks \u00a315. </p> <p> <strong> Food and drink: </strong> \u00a330. </p> <p> <strong> What I bought: </strong> Two fake Diesel T-shirts \u00a310; Thai boxing shorts \u00a35; carved teak elephant with stand, four teak bowls, two sets of teak salad server spoons, two coconut bowls for rice, giant teak plate, 11 sets of chopsticks, two pairs colourful beach trousers (not teak) \u00a350. </p> <p> <strong> Accommodation in Hong Kong: </strong> \u00a30. </p> <p> <strong> What I bought: </strong> Ralph Lauren top (not fake) \u00a340; Adidas trainers (not fake) \u00a335; Johnny Walker Red Label whisky (present) \u00a310; silk dressing gown (present) \u00a3120. </p> <p> <strong> Transport: </strong> Airport train return \u00a320; taxis \u00a340. </p> <p> <strong> Activities: </strong> Daytrip to Macau (inc dinner at world-famous Fernando's) \u00a360; daytrip to Stanley Beach (inc waterfront lunch) \u00a320; Sunny Paradise hot bath and massage \u00a330. </p> <p> <strong> Food and drink: </strong> \u00a3200 (inc vodka jelly night); plus lunch at 62nd floor revolving restaurant \u00a320; plus took pal and his girlfriend for a meal at classy restaurant (Harry Ramsden's) \u00a350. </p> <p><strong> Real total: \u00a32,647.50</strong><br> </p> <p> <strong> Verdict: </strong> I am flabbergasted. I knew I hadn't exactly been tight-fisted. But having now totted things up, I clearly went bananas, blazing round south-east Asia haemorrhaging cash. I booked my flight late, which was costly, then thought: why spend all that then skimp when I get there? So I didn't. And it was worth it - especially the Full Moon party and the Sunny Paradise massage. </p> <p><strong> Mark Porter and Lizzy Hubbard</strong></p> <p> <strong> Estimated total: \u00a32,300</strong></p> <p> The first week was spent self-catering in a traditional black house by the sea on the isle of Harris. It takes ingenuity to find ways of spending money in Harris, but we succeeded by dining lavishly twice at a nearby hotel. The second week was at a hotel in Skye, which was comfortable, but creaky. It reminded us more and more of Fawlty Towers, so we decamped for the last night to a restaurant with rooms on the other side of the island. </p> <p> <strong> What we spent </strong></p> <p> <strong>Transport: </strong> Return train fare from London (overnight sleeper to Inverness) \u00a3258; ferry tickets \u00a3145.90; cab to Euston \u00a38.50;car hire \u00a3210; petrol \u00a360.43; cab home from Euston \u00a38. </p> <p> <strong> Clothes: </strong> Shoes, T-shirts (one pair of Merrell aquamocs, three T-shirts from Joseph, two T-shirts from agn\u00e8s b) \u00a3225. </p> <p> <strong> Books:</strong> Stewart Brand's The Clock of the Long Now, Lee Seldes' The Legacy of Mark Rothko, Freeman J Dyson's The Sun, the Genome and the Internet and Hugo Vickers' biography of Cecil Beaton \u00a344.62; </p> <p> <strong> Extras: </strong> Binoculars (to spy on the Taransay castaways) \u00a329.99; maps \u00a310.50; camera films \u00a312.75; walking kit (we already had the basics, but bought socks, trousers and hat) \u00a3120.45. </p> <p> <strong> Accommodation: </strong> Hotel deposit \u00a380; house rental on Harris \u00a3345; house electricity \u00a312; Hotel in Skye (5 nights B&amp;B, pre-dinner drinks, one restaurant dinner, 4 bar meals, telephone) \u00a3678.99; drinks, dinner, B&amp;B for one night at Three Chimneys restaurant-with-rooms \u00a3260. </p> <p> <strong> What we bought when we were there:</strong> Fleece top \u00a343; enough tweed to make two skirts \u00a360. </p> <p> <strong> Food and drink: </strong> Shopping in Inverness (deli, butcher, baker, wine) \u00a3100.15; shopping in Ullapool (household supplies, groceries) \u00a345; pub lunch \u00a312.20; afternoon tea waiting for ferry \u00a34.50; Skye pub/tea shop lunches \u00a329; groceries in Harris \u00a343.20 (bag of fresh langoustines from fishermen at Leverburgh pier was free); Harris pub/tea shop lunches \u00a324; drinks &amp; dinner twice at Scarista House \u00a3203.10; supper in Inverness \u00a365; lunch in Drumnadrochit \u00a312.50. </p> <p> <strong> Extras: </strong> Left luggage at Inverness station \u00a38; film processing \u00a320. </p> <p><strong> Real total: \u00a33,179.78</strong><br> </p> <p> <strong> Verdict: </strong> A lot, considering that most days were spent walking in the hills. Expensive train fares, car hire, hotels, and restaurants mean that a holiday in Scotland costs us much more than one in Italy or Spain (and we have to go to Italy or Spain afterwards to get some decent weather). </p> <p><strong> Ben Mallalieu, Jenny Taylor and three children<br>Estimated total: \u00a33,200</strong> </p> <p> Apart from the cost of the ferry and the apartment, this ought not to be an expensive holiday. Food and drink in France is still the best in the world and far cheaper than in England. We're well stocked up with summer clothes and unread books. We even have plenty of suntan lotion left over from last year, and we won't be buying any English newspapers . . . </p> <p> <strong> What we spent </strong></p> <p> <strong>Clothes: </strong> Swimming costume for Jenny, children's shorts and T-shirts \u00a3100. </p> <p> <strong> Extras: </strong> Topping up first-aid kit \u00a320; food staples \u00a320; film \u00a320; batteries \u00a35; Green Card \u00a315; pre-trip service for the car \u00a3360; tank of diesel \u00a340. </p> <p> <strong> What we bought on the journey: </strong> One coffee (between two), one Coca-Cola (between three) at a Little Chef, at least \u00a35; drinks at ferry terminal \u00a315; plastic headlight deflectors \u00a37.50. </p> <p> <strong> Accommodation: </strong> Two weeks' self-catering at Pierre et Vacances holiday village, Port du Crouesty, Brittany, plus crossing with Brittany Ferries and insurance \u00a32,411, five-star service \u00a3180, children's clubs \u00a338. </p> <p> <strong> Eating and drinking out: </strong> Six meals \u00a3290, morning coffee and citron press\u00e9s in the harbour \u00a350; cakes from the bakery \u00a330; ice creams \u00a350; beers and soft drinks at various bars and caf\u00e9s \u00a3175. </p> <p> <strong> Eating and drinking in:</strong> Fish, groceries, wine, bread, beer and cider for eight lunches, 12 dinners and 13 breakfasts \u00a3272. </p> <p> <strong> What we bought out there: </strong> Child's swimsuit and three pairs of sailing shoes \u00a322; table-tennis bats and balls \u00a36; beach-tennis bats and ball \u00a34; two wine glasses \u00a33; three coffee mugs \u00a33; oyster knife \u00a31. </p> <p> <strong> Extras: </strong> Parking at Carnac \u00a32; museum entrance \u00a39.50; laundrette \u00a310; more children's club sessions \u00a338. </p> <p> <strong> Transport: </strong> Tank of diesel \u00a325. </p> <p> <strong> What we bought to bring home: </strong> 18 bottles of wine \u00a333; 4 litres cider \u00a33; 10 cheeses \u00a310; five jars of honey \u00a35; one bottle Christian Dior perfume \u00a329. </p> <p> <strong> On the ferry:</strong> Food and drink \u00a330; three cinema tickets for Stuart Little \u00a37.50; photograph of car going on to the ferry \u00a32.50. </p> <p> <strong> Afterwards: </strong> Film processing \u00a333. </p> <p><strong> Real total: \u00a34,380</strong><br> </p> <p> <strong> Verdict: </strong> Oh dear. It is possible to stay cheaply in France, but somehow we didn't manage it. We could have cut back on the restaurant meals and drinks in caf\u00e9s, even though we generally chose the cheapest menus. We ate much better at the apartment for far less. Most other costs were unavoidable, but we should have made some headlight deflectors out of insulating tape and, of course, never set foot in a Little Chef. But we could easily have spent a lot more.</p>",
  "<p>Anxiety that Marks &amp; Spencer's rumoured new chief executive lacked the experience needed to turn the troubled retailer around knocked its shares yesterday. </p> <p>The group, which has repeatedly denied looking for a new chief executive, is widely expected to appoint Roger Holmes, a director of Kingfisher, into the role of director of UK retailing. It would then groom him as the replacement for Peter Salsbury, the M&amp;S chief executive. </p> <p>M&amp;S refused to comment on the appointment but Kingfisher, which this week announced plans to demerge its Woolworths and Superdrug chains from its electrical retailing operation, admitted that Mr Holmes intended to \"take up a career opportunity currently outside of the group\". </p> <p>Kingfisher, which is still negotiating the departure terms for Paris-based Mr Holmes, announced his intention to leave amid a series of management changes related to its planned demerger. </p> <p>As part of the restructuring, Martin Toogood, currently chief executive of do-it-yourself group B&amp;Q, will be chief executive of the new general merchandise arm of the demerged Kingfisher, comprising Woolworths and Superdrug. M&amp;S shares fell 5.75p to 210.25p at the close last night. </p>",
  "<p>Life is not just a force for good, it is a force for its own good. Life has a way of managing things in favour of more life. And in the course of doing so, life manages a whole planet. It makes an atmosphere to breathe, and water to drink, and food to eat and then it recycles its own detritus. It hijacks sunlight and passes it around to the next user in digestible, shrink-wrapped form. Having done that, it disposes of itself, directly as nutrient for some other creature, or indirectly as a strata of phosphate or a layer of chalk or fossil limestone, or as energy to burn 1bn years later. </p> <p>Earlier this month, Austrian scientists detected bacteria, living comfortably in high clouds, reproducing themselves and - some think - serving the world by playing rainmaker, acting as \"seeds\" around which water vapour could become raindrops. </p> <p>But this heavenly host of living things surprised no one. Life has been turning up in improbable places for years. People who drilled a mile deep into the basalt of the ocean floor found tiny microbes living on a diet of warmth and rock. Submarine explorers have found huge colonies of strange creatures basking in a kind of chemical cornucopia at the bottom of the ocean's depths, far from any sunlight. Microbes have been found in acid flows, in lakes of soda, down the vents of volcanoes and on the underside of the polar ice, organising the planet for the rest of creation. </p> <p>Might things have got a little hot when carbon dioxide levels built up dangerously at the dawn of the Eocene, 55m years ago? Fear not. The rapid response team was on hand. An Anglo-American team of scientists reported on Thursday that plankton bloomed, the oceans became a garden and greedily mopped up the excess carbon, cooling the greenhouse world to acceptable levels. Not for the first time, nor the last, the biosphere had risen to the challenge, and adjusted itself. </p> <p>It is more than 30 years since James Lovelock, a freelance chemist with a background in medical research and a gift for devising sensitive detectors, worked for Nasa on the Mars exploration programme. While doing so, he began to form the idea of the biosphere as a self-regulating entity, of life and the planet as a kind of sensitive organism, not sensitive to any particular form of life, just to the principle of life. He called it the Gaia hypothesis. The novelist William Golding, a friend and neighbour, suggested the name. Gaia was the Earth goddess, the Greeks' Mother Nature. </p> <p>Touchingly, Lovelock reports in his latest book that he originally thought Golding had suggested calling it the Gyre hypothesis, after the gyres or vortexes that drive ocean and atmospheric circulation. The idea of Gaia caught the imagination of people everywhere. Gaia is a kind of metaphor for a very subtle lesson in the physiology of a planet. But Gaia became a reality, too, for the Greens, particularly those inclined to mysticism. Lovelock doesn't mind. He finds things to marvel at in Gaia, too. \"Some very distinguished scientist, I have forgotten his name, told me when I was quite young that the one thing you have got to keep right through your life or right up to your dotage is a sense of childlike wonder and once it goes, stop doing science,\" he says. </p> <p>He is fond of individual Greens, but he doesn't have much patience for some Green thinking, and in particular the Green attitude to nuclear power. Never mind the British government's little local difficulty with fuel prices, fossil fuels are literally beginning to cost the earth and meanwhile the Green campaigners are rejecting at least one easy answer to the great problem of how to power an economy without shutting down the biosphere with polluting greenhouse gases. </p> <p>This answer, Lovelock says, is ecologically clean and tidy and has a very bad press. It is nuclear power. \"I can envisage somewhere about 2050, when the greenhouse really begins to bite, when people will start looking back and saying: whose fault was all this? And they will settle on the Greens and say: 'if those damn people hadn't stopped us building nuclear power stations we wouldn't be in this mess'. And I think it is true. The real dangers to humanity and the ecosystems of the earth from nuclear power are almost negligible. You get things like Chernobyl but what happens? Thirty-odd brave firemen died who needn't have died but its general effect on the world population is almost negligible. </p> <p>\"What has it done to wild life? All around Chernobyl, where people are not allowed to go because the ground is too radioactive, well, the wildlife doesn't care about radiation. It has come flooding in. It is one of the richest ecosystems in the region. And then they say: what shall we do with nuclear waste?\" Lovelock has an answer for that, too. Stick it in some precious wilderness, he says. If you wanted to preserve the biodiversity of rainforest, drop pockets of nuclear waste into it to keep the developers out. The lifespans of the wild things might be shortened a bit, but the animals wouldn't know, or care. Natural selection would take care of the mutations. Life would go on. </p> <p>\"I have told the BNFL, or whoever it was, that I would happily take the full output of one of their big power stations. I think the high-level waste is a stainless steel cube of about a metre in size and I would be very happy to have a concrete pit that they would dig - I wouldn't dig it - that they would put it in.\" He says he would use the waste for two purposes. \"One would be home heating. You would get free home heat from it. And the other would be to sterilise the stuff from the supermarket, the chicken and whatnot, full of salmonella. Just drop it down through a hole. I'm not saying this tongue-in-cheek. I am quite serious,\" he says. \"They would be welcome to take pictures of my grandchildren sitting on top of it.\" </p> <p>Lovelock regards himself as an eccentric, and a radical, and he enjoys being a member of the awkward squad. The Gaia hypothesis was a huge delight to some, but it was a huge provocation to others. It also plunged Lovelock into a war of metaphors. Most of the battle was with the biologists, who had a different set of metaphors to defend. Some scientists, for example, call the Earth the Goldilocks planet, because Venus, hot enough to melt lead, was too warm and Mars, the frozen desert, was too cold, but Earth was just right for life. So in their view, the planet manages life, not the other way around. </p> <p>Another group thinks of the fullness and richness of biodiversity as the outcome of \"selfish genes\", hectically competing to replicate themselves. So for them, life is a battle for tenure rather than an invitation to the dance. And then along came Lovelock, a non-biologist who proposes something disconcerting: that the earth is fit for life because life made it that way. The battle was brisk, because life is the great mystery. There are three great stories that science has to tell: one of these is where the universe came from, one is where life came from and the third is where humans came from. The first and the last are being sorted out right now. Cosmologists think, for instance, that they have the story of creation figured out, except for the first 1,000th of a second. Anthropologists have settled on a consensus that modern humans emerged in Africa about 250,000 years ago, the latest and only survivors in a line of hominids. </p> <p>But the origin of life is a puzzle. Think of it as a kind of reverse murder mystery. The bringing-to-life happened in a locked room in a strange world 3.4 bn years ago. There is no surviving scene of the not-crime. There are no footprints, no strewn clues. The evidence was destroyed by the very creatures that rose from original experiments in fashioning the living chemistry from non-living chemicals. Whatever conditions made life possible were promptly erased by the action of life itself. The last surviving universal common ancestor went round eliminating all chances of new rivals emerging. </p> <p>Life came into a planet with an atmosphere of carbon dioxide, and began to alter it, producing as waste a dangerous, reactive gas called oxygen which could ultimately have brought the whole experiment to a halt. So life's - and Gaia's - next step was to favour a balancing set of creatures that consumed oxygen and breathed out carbon dioxide. But once that was done, the original atmosphere was gone, and water and nitrogen cycles were wiping away any evidence that might have been left in the rocks. </p> <p>Lovelock began thinking of such things three decades ago when he worked on Nasa's search for evidence of life on another planet. He proposed in effect that you could tell that the earth was alive from a million miles away. Its atmospheric chemistry would shout of life. He proposed that the 70s Mars probe instruments could confirm the presence of life on the red planet by detecting an atmosphere of dynamic disequilibrium. </p> <p>If there had been life on Mars, it would have been a very different planet. The atmosphere of Mars is 98% carbon dioxide and very stable. Venus is 98% carbon dioxide and a very nasty example of a runaway greenhouse effect. The earth no doubt started at 98% carbon dioxide too but today's atmosphere is a mixture of inflammable oxygen and reactive nitrogen with just a touch of carbon dioxide, and something is definitely keeping this explosive mixture primed. </p> <p>He says Nasa ignored his proposal at the time but the future search for life on planets outside the solar system will be based entirely on Lovelock principles. At some future point, fleets of spacecraft working in exquisite unison will focus on little specks of light reflected from parent stars, looking for the spectral signatures of telltale gases such as oxygen and water vapour and methane. </p> <p>You couldn't imagine oxygen and methane surviving together for very long in the same atmosphere. So if you spotted these in the gleam from a planet 30 light years away you'd start to wonder. \"If there is a lot of methane, oxygen won't rise by accident. So you have to postulate a process on the surface that is producing gigatonnes if not teratonnes of both of those gases all the time and not only that but regulating them, because if you didn't regulate them you would be in danger of making an inflammable atmosphere or something like that. So that then becomes conclusive evidence of life,\" he says. </p> <p>The American enthusiasm for possible life on Mars amuses him. \"I think it is all part of the American frontier mentality. This Mars is the ultimate place, we can go there when we have screwed up the earth. We have the technology, we can fix it. The national legend of America is very tied up with Star Trek and if you go to scientific meetings you hear Star Trek metaphors paraded around all the time and to them it no longer is a kind of story, it is reality and there is a great danger in their thinking.\" </p> <p>Lovelock is now 81. He and his wife Sandy - his first wife, Helen, the mother of his children, died after a long illness - have completed the 600-miles coastal walk from Poole, Dorset to Minehead , Somerset. He has pursued a long career as a kind of freelance scientist and he says big corporations are not for him, although he is happy to sell them his inventions. He doesn't care for science run by bureaucracies. He lives in an idyllic corner of Devon, on a 35-acre farm, on which he has planted 25,000 trees. </p> <p>He takes the long view of eco-hazards, he says. He isn't bothered by the menace of industrial chemicals like PCBs or agricultural fertilisers in the way that Greenpeace or Friends of the Earth are. A chemist from the start, he points out that according to a Royal Society of Chemistry survey, chemists live longer than most scientists. The big threat to the planet, he says, is people: there are too many, doing too well economically and burning too much oil. </p> <p>\"It's the people that count and the only message I would have to give is to stop fretting, stop looking for scapegoats, people are to blame for the condition of the earth. It is me, you, all of us that are to blame and if we are going to do anything about it we have to tackle it individually, not expect anybody to take the load off us and do it. If you are a housewife in Balham you are not, probably, doing anywhere near as much to damage the planet as suburbanites and exurbanites living around here, using their cars wholly unnecessarily in huge numbers of journeys and burning far more fuel. The more money you have, the more damage you can do.\" </p> <p>His new book is a hymn to science, and to Gaia and to the other makers of his great idea, and to the forces that made him choose to swim upstream, to stay independent, to be free to follow his nose. He grew up with Quaker principles, and became a conscientious objector in the second world war. He spent 20 years at the National Institute for Medical Research at Mill Hill, a lab with 100 scientists and six Nobel prizewinners, and then he started pleasing himself, usually by devising instruments that pleased big business, or Nasa, or the Ministry of Defence. </p> <p>He built a detector so sensitive it could trace seemingly infinitesimally small concentrations of chlorofluorocarbons in the atmosphere. Famously, he remarked that such low levels could do no harm. He should have written no toxic harm, he says. They were, of course, the chemicals that began to demolish the ozone layer. He thinks the big dangers to the planet are the greenhouse effect and the spread of humanity. Humans, just by their fecundity, and their economic demands, have begun to affect habitat and biodiversity so furiously that it might be that one day Gaia might not be able to step in and adjust the conditions to secure her own reign. The planetary regulator might not regulate so efficiently. </p> <p>In that sense, biodiversity was a kind of insurance, a spreading of bets to allow life to survive the kind of catastrophes - from outer space, or from volcanoes - that have seriously interrupted evolution at least five times in the last 600m years. Meanwhile, humans could get their comeuppance in some quite mundane but unexpected way. </p> <p>\"Every few hundred years or less, there is a natural geological disaster, like a big volcano. Tambora was the last, in 1815, and the one before that was Laki in 1783. Both of those were followed by two years without any harvest. Now in those days, people survived. There were famines, but people survived. What would happen now?\" he asks. He was speaking before the British pickets began their fuel blockade, and before panic-stricken consumers began clearing supermarket shelves. He was speaking long before word began to leak of UK government statement to be made on Monday about research into the possibility of some future collision with a large asteroid, an event which would darken the sky, shake continents, shut down agriculture and certainly clear the supermarket shelves the world over. </p> <p>He was simply taking, as he has done all his life, the long view. \"Two years without a harvest? It would probably bust civilisation. People would survive all right. It really would cut us back, and that is the sort of thing nobody really prepares for. It's not some ecological poison or GM foods or nuclear that is going to get us, it is going to be some perfectly ordinary natural event.\"</p>",
  "<p>Poor Sacha Distel. Not only did people hate him enough already for being one of the few men alive to have had full penetrative sex with the young Brigitte Bardot, but now he's in the merde with his fellow Frenchies for claiming last week that English is a far better language to sing in than French.</p> <p>Then the fantastically brilliant American-born writer Bonnie Greer revealed in last Saturday's Guardian that, when travelling back to her adopted homeland from the US, she habitually begs airlines to let her sit near the front of the plane, so that she may be all the quicker on to her beloved British soil.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the very sexy model and singer Caprice, who was born and bred in California, sighed to OK! magazine from her LA condo that she considers England to be her real home: \"Living there has made me a much better person, a lot more cultured and sophisticated... the education system is better, so you get a different kind of character.\" Gee whiz, Caprice! </p> <p>Knowing that I'm approved of by Sacha, Bonnie and the beauteous Miss Bourret makes me feel even better about the recent nasty comments from Martin Amis, Salman Rushdie and Jeanette Winterson about how they're planning to leg it to America because this country is going to the dogs - ie, not buying their rotten books in anything like the quantities they used to. Go on, be honest: which trio would you rather go down the pub with? I thought so. </p> <p>And, of course, once more it is naked self-interest attempting to cloak its dank and shameful crevices in the watered silk of artistic stimulation. As sumptuous banquets of hypocrisy go, it's the 80s Bad Boy actors thing all over again - you remember, when every week there would be an interview with Tim Roth or Gary Oldman ranting on about how they couldn't breathe any more in Thatcher's rotten, repressive, rightwing Britain. So, for the good of their health and their art, they were moving to... Cuba? Sweden? No, actually: they were moving to kind, enlightened, liberal Reagan's America!</p> <p>You couldn't help but snigger when the turkeys started trotting. Like Michael Caine before them, who made such gems as Alfie, The Ipcress File and Get Carter in boring old Britain before abandoning us for Hollywood where, apparently, the real work was - in his case Blame It On Rio, Jaws: The Revenge and The Swarm IV. </p> <p>No, when Brits move to America - be they actors, writers or stupid sportsmen-turned- movie-tough-guys with mouths like little cats' anuses who are managing to pass off silence as wisdom rather than cretinism - they move there for one of two reasons, both of which have nothing to do with art. They move there because they are rich and greedy for more, or because, unconsciously, they worship evil.</p> <p>Yes, I said evil. You need only read or own dear George Monbiot's excellent new book to understand that the US has done, is doing and will do more damage to this planet and its people than Nazi Germany and fascist Japan put together. In the face of this, the rest of the world seems somehow to have reverted to the state of impressionable native - and instead of waving shiny beads in our faces, the Americans now wave shiny Starbucks, Seinfeld and Britney Spears instead. </p> <p>And this voodoo works. All around you, you can hear people choosing to ignore the fact that America is greatly responsible for turning the earth into an open sewer - culturally, morally and physically - and harping on instead about American \"energy\" and \"can-do\". Of course, nine times out of 10, that energy is the energy of the vandal, psychotic or manic depressive, fuelling acts of barbarism and destruction from My Lai to Eminem; and it's a shame that that legendary can-do usually translates as can-do crime, can-do imperialism and can-do poisoning the seas. But Frasier's dead funny, so never mind! </p> <p>If you want to worship evil and cosy up in the belly of the beast, you're perfectly free to do so, but please don't dress it up as love of art. The fact is that Britain has always attracted sexy, brilliant Americans such as Ava Gardner, Stanley Kubrick and numerous blacks who cannot believe the lack of racial segregation that exists here.</p> <p>You could see this in the true-life scene from John Schlesinger's film, Yanks, when the English girls, horrified by the white GIs' contempt for their black colleagues, grab the black men and drag them on to the dancefloor, leaving the white Americans as wallflowers. When I was in the music business, I was always being told by black musicians how amazed they were by the sexual and social freedom extended to them here. Most touchingly, I'll never forget a black teenager from a Boston boy band whispering to me, \"You can go anywhere you like in England! Where I come from, there's always someone telling you you can't come in.\"</p> <p>And every so often, you meet black Americans called Devon - never white ones: \"It's because my grandpa was there during the war,\" an American black lady told me recently. \"The people were so nice to him, he always dreamed of going back. But it never happened. So my dad was Devon, and I'm Devon, too.\" </p> <p>Preferring Britain to the US, despite all our faults, means that you respect tolerance, kindness and a refusal to judge people merely on how far they have made it up the dung heap we call capitalism. Preferring the US to Britain, on the other hand, reveals a person to be a blind worshipper of power, money and those crazy go-to-hell golf slacks. It makes you dirty, but not in a sexy way.</p> <p>Any Briton who goes to live in America has the clammy mentality of that creepy kid in every class who, while never actually caught bullying vulnerable kids himself, is always there on lookout, always enjoying the show, yet not possessing the guts to get embroiled himself. In short, any Briton who emigrates to America is a pathetic, traitorous little sneak, a disgrace to the human race that is currently suffering under the studded cowboy boot of Uncle Sam, and as such deserves to be stripped of their British citizenship - which could then be given to some nice, appreciative refugee - and never allowed back on this sceptred isle again. </p> <p>Go on, Mart, Salman, Jeanette: enjoy all the nylons and chewing gum you can get, while there is still time. For soon there will be a mighty day of reckoning, when the free world will break loose of the American yoke, and all the Great Satan's whores and quislings will dangle from the nearest lamp-posts. On that day, don't come looking for me to bail you out - because I'll be down the pub with Caprice.</p>",
  "<p>Modesty Blaise is dead. True to form, she was fleeing gunfire in a remote South American valley when she caught the fatal bullet; moments before, she'd revealed to steadfast sidekick Willie Garvin that she had a terminal brain disease, adding prophetically: \"I'd rather go with a bang than a whimper.\" </p> <p>Modesty was granted her last wish four years ago, in a collection of short stories which her creator, Peter O'Donnell, intended as the finale to her literary existence. She is still extant, though, in the long-running newspaper strip. And she's alive and kicking (literally - as a martial arts expert) on the internet, thanks to her fans and much to O'Donnell's surprise. </p> <p>Modesty's age has always been problematical: in the last book, Cobra Trap (now reissued <a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,501183120,00.html\">Buy it at BOL</a>), someone surmises that she's 52, \"though her body would have passed for 30\". On her website, though, a meanie has calculated that with so many adventures notched up, she must be over 70. </p> <p>Chronology is not O'Donnell's strong point, but his own creative span is undisputed. He started work as a teenager in Fleet Street on \"picture stories\" - illustrated adventure serials for young readers. Modesty is a daughter of this genre. She was conceived 38 years ago and O'Donnell, now 80, is still backing her into tight corners in the daily syndicated version. Though the scams and scoundrels she's been involved with over the decades have been updated, what hasn't altered is the moral line - drawn somewhat arbitrarily, it may seem - and the way in which O'Donnell strives to keep her on the right side of it. </p> <p>The outfit she ran - the Network - can't be classified as just another criminal gang. Based in Tangier, it was tacitly approved by the authorities, which it sometimes helped. Its operatives, though they handled many a murky assignment, never tangled with the trade in drugs or sex. And even when a load of butch broads muscled in on her act - in the Bond books and movies and TV's Charlie's Angels - Modesty refused to become a female Rambo. </p> <p>O'Donnell is proud of the way she has stuck to her standards. \"She does other things besides kick people in the head,\" he says. \"She's very compassionate and vulnerable.\" In the early days, she would have a little weep on Willie's chest when they had been in a dicey situation, but soon pull herself together. </p> <p>Modesty bid farewell to the Network several books ago and, as a very rich retiree, could afford to be picky about her subsequent challenges. She in turn has seen O'Donnell right, setting him up with a handsome home in an unspoilt Brighton square. Along with the 12 Modesty books, two other authors get pride of place on his study shelves: Madeleine Brent is blazoned on a set of bright dustjackets, while Bernard O'Donnell graces the faded spines of the other set. </p> <p>Both hold the key to O'Donnell's success. Bernard was his crime reporter father, who also wrote volumes on cops and crims and gave his young son a sniff of gangland and Fleet Street. Madeleine is O'Donnell himself in drag as a romantic novelist, proving that the way to writerly wealth is to have two personae. </p> <p>As a kid, he'd find stubbly scar-faced characters at the breakfast table, invited in by his dad, who knew gangland from Bethnal Green to Brighton racecourse. He was also on nodding terms with everyone in \"The Print\". \"My old man trundled me round the newspaper offices when I was 17, giving them all first refusal of this brilliant lad,\" recalls O'Donnell, \"and they all refused!\" But Amalgamated Press took him on, writing storylines for its stable of publications for young people. </p> <p>\"It was a hard school,\" he says: writing to order, to length and to time; literate but not literary. It was hackwork at its best, and it paid off in a post-war Fleet Street avid for fiction as well as fact. \"I used to write 20,000 words a week: an adventure, a detective, a western; short stories and scripts for strips.\" He worked in a big garret above El Vino's, but there was a flipside to the conviviality of hacks. Once, stuck for an idea, a surly editor he approached for inspiration glanced up from the racing pages and scowled: \"You're a fucking author, aren't you? Well, go away and auth.\" </p> <p>He did just that, creating Modesty in 1963 as a woman who could counter the butch heroes of pulp fiction. Nothing was wasted. From a wartime posting in the Caucasus he remembered a refugee girl, all alone at 12 or 13, who was given food by his unit, smiled her thanks and went on her way. He often pondered the mystery of her rootlessness, and years later used it as the basis for the footloose independence of Ms Blaise: the original wild child. When a film was mooted in 1964, part of the deal was for a tie-in novel. No problem: the novel did better than the subsequent movie, and he continued with the hardbacks, alternating Modesty with Madeleine, for the next 20 years. </p> <p>O'Donnell's is a road to fiction and fame that no young novelist today would recognise. It had disappeared, anyway, long before Fleet Street replaced the compositor with the computer. But, hard though it was, O'Donnell makes it sound a lot more romantic than the sunbeam path of today's golden literati, with their angst and their advances. \"I write from the gut about characters I care about,\" he says, as though nothing could be simpler.</p>",
  "<p> I like manifestos, gauntlets, red rags. It is necessary to assassinate some orchards, especially when those English gardens are full of people exclaiming what a \"vintage year\" it has been for fiction. Wyndham Lewis's phrase, \"Kill John Bull with art\", has always seemed a fine slogan. But the manifesto proposed by Matt Thorne and Nicholas Blincoe in this anthology of 15 stories seems more likely to kill art with John Bull. It flourishes the possibility of a new kind of fiction, but in fact it represents a kind of hidden shame about literature, and an embarrassment that fiction is not more like film. It is really a manifesto for the New Philistinism. Fortunately, the best contributors to this book ignore the editors' rules. </p> <p>Those rules are laid out in the form of a dialogue between Blincoe and Thorne. Gathering around them a group of writers in their late 20s and early 30s, they argue that \"new, exciting voices\" in recent contemporary fiction - generally men who, in the last three years, have written punchy novels with monosyllabic titles like Coast, Go, Seaside, Tourist, Corpsing - have been \"marginalised\". Blincoe and Thorne propose that the new fiction obey the following rules: it should be simple and \"avoid all devices of voice\", such as rhetoric and authorial asides, and shun \"poetry and poetic licence in all its forms\"; it should be plotty and forward-driving, and eschew flashbacks; it should be grammatically simple, and avoid elaborate punctuation; being a \"fragment of time\", it should be set in the present day; and all references to \"products, places, artists and objects\" should be \"real\". </p> <p>The first thing to observe is that if these writers - such as Alex Garland, Bo Fowler, Thorne himself, Toby Litt - have been marginalised, then their margin is our centre, because it is difficult to move in a bookshop without falling over some dictator-sized photograph of a slightly hooliganish figure, his hair as shaved as his prose style, his mouth set in a macho moue, his fine eyes focused on some suitably menacing abstraction in the middle distance. </p> <p>Second, one can hardly help agreeing that the editors, at least, should shun poetic licence, for when they indulge in it, the results are not good. Blincoe allows himself an unfortunate metaphor when he says that \"poetry is defined by metre - ultimately by the storm of jackboots\". (Heil H\u00f6lderlin!) Thorne, mixing a metaphor, suggests that \"the building blocks of storytelling should not be focusing on the minutiae of narrative but the grand plan\". (So those building blocks won't get too distracted.) </p> <p>Third, this manifesto is largely a list of prohibitions. Yet the great revolutions in literature - the Lyrical Ballads, naturalism, modernism - were fervent with proposal, and correspondingly eager to hit their enemies with those proposals. On both counts, Blincoe and Thorne are not revolutionaries: they admit to no apparent enemies, and they want literature to do less, not more. </p> <p>This quietism seems a mystery, but the clue is film. Blincoe and Thorne seem less goaded by the failures of British fiction than piqued by the success of cinema. And correspondingly, their response is not literary but cinematic. Blincoe says that flashbacks are \"essentially undramatic\", and Thorne concurs, adding that \"if the characters are strong, we need only know what they're doing now\". So: out with memory, because memory is undramatic. The model, the idol, is the linearity of film (though not, one presumes, the unlinearity of Antonioni, Bergman, Kurosawa, Ozu). </p> <p>Thorne says stories should shun \"poetry and poetic licence in all its forms\", because poetry is not the great influence on fiction: that is \"film, technology, music or television ... Today, fiction should be focusing on visual culture, and attempting to prove itself the equal of these mediums.\" This is a revealing slip, for Thorne must mean that fiction is not, at present, the equal of these mediums. The idea that literature might be superior, or simply engaged in a different kind of activity, has seemingly not occurred to Blincoe and Thorne. </p> <p>But then what can \"equal\" mean? Since it cannot mean \"the same as\" it must mean \"equally successful\". The manifesto for the New Puritanism is really a plea for success on the scale of film - a plea for worldly success wrapped in the disguise of denial. And a deep defensiveness, amounting to an embarrassment on behalf of literature, runs throughout this introduction. For what Blincoe and Thorne propose is to strip literature of all that makes it literary, so that it can better \"compete\" with film. It is really a commercial or pragmatic argument posing as an aesthetic and puritanical argument. </p> <p> So in a strange inversion, while Dogme 95, the Danish art-film movement on which this book is loosely modelled, set itself puritanically against Hollywood film, Blincoe and Thorne really want to embrace Hollywood, despite their avowed puritanism. They are friendly to precisely those simplicities that seem deadly to the founders of Dogme 95. </p> <p>Furthermore, while the rebellion of the Danish filmmakers makes sense within a world dominated by commercial cinema, the rebellion of Blincoe and Thorne is incoherent in a literary world already strongly infected by simplicity, presentism, blankness and a love affair with the cinematic. Thorne and Blincoe surely know that the contemporary short story since Raymond Carver - and as practised most recently by, say, Junot Diaz - has been quick, short, skinned and generally New Puritanical. Certainly in America, creative writing programmes process the story that only aspires to be a quick savage swipe of the cloth across reality. Such a story - invariably a \"fragment of time\", to use Blincoe and Thorne's phrase - offers itself as a kind of victim of its own confusion. Like many in this anthology, it is always narrated by a character, since third-person narration is nowadays taken to be something sent from an official ghost, like a bill. </p> <p>The contemporary short story is invariably written in a babyish or busted English of thoughtless simplicity. In its refusal to take much note of place, history, or society, it seems - like its characters - the victim of sensory deprivation. Its characters speak to each other, if they are into conversation at all, in stringy glazed abruptnesses. Their conversation, in its complacent discontinuity, sounds as if each participant were on the phone to a third party. If they have pasts at all, they are thinly offered. Instead, they seem oddly stunned by the present, deseeded and without the pith of affect. We do not see them change much; instead, the story photographs their stasis. </p> <p>This description of the contemporary story is also a description of the general tone of many of those in this anthology; which suggests that the New Puritans' revolution will not succeed precisely because it already has done. Pleasingly, the stories in this book that follow the \"rules\" are the weakest. \"Monkey See\" by Matthew Branton, about a policeman who watches hard-core porn as part of his job but who has not had sex with his wife for four months, seems to be an attempt to eat as many brand names as it can: \"I'll pop round Londis, get some Persil ... He cooked up a Sizzle and Stir ... He spooned some Gold Blend into a jug.\" The absurdity of the rule that demands that all references to objects be \"real\" is nicely exploded by Scarlett Thomas, who in her piece misspells H\u00e4agen-Dazs ice cream, and by Thorne himself, who in his unpleasant and sexually sadistic story describes a woman in \"a blue Knicks baseball T-shirt\". The Knicks are a basketball team. </p> <p>Thorne says that \"fiction must always try to define the prominent cultural forms of its time\" (oh, like The Charterhouse of Parma, War and Peace, Middlemarch, To the Lighthouse). So what do these stories tell us about British society? That people are watching a lot of TV (ER is mentioned in two of the stories, The Bill in another) and American videos, that they are masturbating quite a bit, using or making pornography, taking drugs and listening to music. Mostly, they are doing \"simple\" things in \"simple\" prose: \"I shook my head and went into the kitchen, pouring myself a big bowl of cornflakes. I took a carton of juice from the fridge and filled a tall glass.\" Or: \"For dinner, Mark's mum has Chunky Monkey ice-cream. Me and Mark's dad have egg and chips, sitting in the lounge watching Neighbours From Hell.\" In these stories the unexamined life is decidedly worth living. </p> <p>The best stories are by Anna Davis (a lovely picture of a 15-year-old girl's frustrations: \"There's so much life here and none of it is mine\"); Geoff Dyer (a very funny and finely written piece about a Frenchwoman's bad trip); and Candida Clark (a rich, pleasingly old-fashioned bar-room anecdote, poetically rendered). These disobedient examples take plenty of poetic licence, indulge in all kinds of devices of voice, and are not especially simple in their grammar. Nicholas Blincoe and Toby Litt have written stories that are at least intriguing, and certainly plot-driven. But they both have trick endings, and their proper milieu seems to be Roald Dahl's Tales of the Unexpected. </p> <p>Of course, the short story has historically tended toward the simple. I have a favourite line from Joyce's \"A Little Cloud\": \"He watched the scene and thought of life; and (as always happened when he thought of life) he became sad.\" Many stories by Chekhov, Verga, Joyce and the incomparably simple Pirandello follow Blincoe and Thorne's rules. But this is the simplicity of those who have known richness, and who are a little weary of congestion. Blincoe and Thorne, by contrast, are too poor too young; paddling in remnants, they are incuriously abandoning something they did not possess anyway. On the evidence of this book, we need a New Abundance. </p> <p> \u0095 James Wood's The Broken Estate: Essays on Literature and Belief, is published in paperback by Pimlico.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,501017685,00.html\">Buy it at BOL</a></p>",
  "A man alleged to be the top military commander of the Basque separatist group Eta was arrested in south-west France yesterday as police struck a fresh blow against the outlawed organisation. <p>Ignacio Gracia Arregui, 45, was seized in the town of Bidart with his girlfriend and a third person in an operation carried out jointly by French and Spanish police. The couple were with their two-year-old daughter when police burst into their flat. Other arrests were expected as the crackdown on Eta members, promised by Spain's prime minister, Jose Maria Aznar, continued. Security forces would \"continue their tenacious efforts\", he said earlier this week, after 20 of the group's main strategists and fundraisers were taken into custody in Spain.</p> <p>Eta's top leaders have always preferred to base themselves in the French Basque country where, for a time, they enjoyed protection. In 1987, French authorities lifted the immunity they had given Mr Arregui as a political refugee from General Franco's dictatorship. Yesterday's arrest was described by Spain's interior minister, Jaime Mayor Oreja, as \"a model of cooperation between French and Spanish police\".</p> <p>Mr Arregui, known colloquially as \"Inaki de Renteria\", after the small Basque town where he was born, allegedly took control of Eta's commandos in 1992 when the previous leadership was rounded up. Magistrates at Spain's national court, set up to try terrorist offences, accuse him of planning an assasination attempt on King Juan Carlos in 1995, foiled by police three years later. He is thought to have joined Eta in 1975, when he was barely 20 years old, and has remained a hardline activist ever since, unlike other veterans who renounced violence when Spain became a democracy and the Basque country was granted a measure of self-government.</p> <p>Mr Arregui's arrest follows a period of intense Eta violence. Twelve people have died since the group broke a 14-month truce at the start of the year.</p>",
  "The chief spin doctor for the Tory party at the last election has conceded that William Hague is heading for defeat at the next election. <p>Charles Lewington, speaking at the height of the fuel crisis, admitted the Conservative leader's appeal was too narrow to beat Tony Blair despite Labour's recent woes. </p> <p>The candid assessment by the party's former director of communications underlined what many Tory MPs have said in private after their party failed to make a breakthrough in the polls this summer. </p> <p>Mr Hague's fate was compared by Mr Lewington to that of the US Republican presidential contender Bob Dole, who lost to Bill Clinton four years ago. </p> <p>The concentration on issues such as Europe to shore up the Tories' core vote, he said, risked leaving Mr Hague appearing an extremist, thus frightening off Middle Britain. </p> <p>\"The next UK campaign may follow Clinton's 1996 campaign with its focus on emphasising deliverables and its attempt to paint Dole as an out-of-touch rightwinger,\" said Mr Lewington. </p> <p>\"Hague is younger and has more going for him than Dole. But he is going into a campaign with a euro-focused policy direction which leaves him as vulnerable to attack as Dole was in the 1996 campaign. </p> <p>\"I don't blame the Tories for adopting a core vote strategy, but I think it will be difficult for Hague to broaden his appeal from where he is currently positioned.\" </p> <p>Mr Lewington, who now runs his own PR company, spoke at a debate in London on UK and US political campaigning organised by BKSH, the government relations division of Burson-Marsteller. </p> <p>Stuck on or just below 30% in the opinion polls, the Tories have been dubbed the flatliners. Mr Hague hoped populist stands against \"bogus\" asylum seekers and for Tony Martin, the Norfolk farmer jailed for killing an intruder, would boost his support, but they have left him looking opportunistic.</p>",
  "<p>Scientists will urge the government to set up a guard against destruction from outer space, in an official report to be published on Monday. A task force will report that collisions with \"near earth objects\" such as asteroids and comets are no longer the stuff of science fiction: they represent a real threat. A collision with one the size of a small village could wipe out a third of the human race. </p> <p>A 100-metre object crashes into the planet every 10,000 years - triggering a 100 megaton explosion in the air, larger than the largest H-bomb ever tested. A 1km object scores a direct hit on the planet every 100,000 years - with the force of 10m Hiroshimas. </p> <p>The near earth objects task force, led by Professor Harry Atkinson, a scientist who has worked both for the European space agency and Nasa, was set up in January to consider the growing evidence of danger and to take advice from astronomers. </p> <p>His report will urge the government to release \u00a320m for a new telescope in the southern hemisphere to comb the skies, and to \"buy\" time on a network of new or existing telescopes in Australia, Hawaii and the Canary islands to track the solar system's \"loose cannons\". The task force - made up of Prof Atkinson, Sir Crispin Tickell, the former British ambassador to the UN, and Professor David Williams of University College, London - will also recommend close partnerships with European and US astronomers to ensure systematic global coverage. </p> <p>The report will suggest support for space-based instruments to sweep the skies for potential cosmic traffic accidents and British involvement in European and US satellites which could rendezvous with asteroids far away and study them more closely. And it is expected to urge a kind of British \"spaceguard\" research centre, perhaps at the Armagh observatory in Northern Ireland, to keep disaster experts, astronomers, media and government in touch with each other. </p> <p>One problem is that the US - which funds a \"minor planet centre\" at Harvard - controls the detailed astronomical information from observers all over the world. The report could urge that Britain share some of the cost. \"It's an unhealthy state of affairs even if the US is an ally, when one country controls the information,\" said one researcher. </p> <p>Objects from space hit the earth all the time - at speeds of more than 10 miles a second. Most burn up harmlessly, as shooting stars. Hundreds have landed as small rocks. There is no record of any human being killed by a comet or asteroid - but a large one could destroy civilisation. The aim, the task force report will say, is to detect a potential collision years or, better still, decades in advance, giving governments of the world time to take measures. </p> <p>\"What they are talking about is setting in motion ways in which we could really deflect one of these things. That is the contentious one, because that involves nuclear weapons,\" said one astronomer last night. \"It doesn't say that, but we know it does. If you are going to deflect one, you have got to use a nuclear weapon. There is no other way to do it.\" </p> <p>This would mean launching a robot spacecraft to meet an asteroid, and then triggering a precisely calculated explosion which would knock it off course so that it would miss its date with the earth. </p> <p>Other bodies in the solar system are pock-marked by asteroid craters. The earth's asteroid scars have been removed by erosion - but there have been a number of collisions identified by planetary scientists. The most famous coincided with the death of the dinosaurs 65m years ago, but a 100-metre object exploded over Siberia in 1908 and wiped out 2,000 sq miles of forest. Two large asteroids have passed alarmingly close to earth in the last few years. US and French astronomers recently calculated that 900 asteroids, all 1km across or larger, are whizzing around the solar system on orbits that cross that of the earth. But Europeans want to start tracking smaller objects. </p> <p>\"A 200-metre object plonking into the Atlantic would effectively take out all the cities around the seaboards. Those smaller events occur rather more fre quently - they are talking about a once every several thousand years event,\" said Duncan Steel of the University of Salford, one of the leading authorities on asteroids and comets. \"The report highlights the way in which Britain can make a real contribution to the international programme - in essence to become No 2 in the world, behind the US. This would put the UK in a Europe-leading role.\" </p> <p>Jonathan Tate, a British army officer who several years ago began pressing for governments to take the threat from space seriously, is the director of SpaceGuard UK. He argued that a crash from a 1km asteroid - a one-in-100,000-years event - could kill 25-30% of the human race within a year. Assuming a UK population of 60m when it happened, that would work out at an average of 150 deaths a year over that 100,000-year period. One authority values a human life at \u00a3850,000. </p> <p>\"That actually works out at \u00a3123m a year to do nothing,\" he said. \"One of the major effects of this report will be to dispel, for once and for all, the giggle factor associated with the impact hazard. No sane person can any longer regard this as either funny or science fiction.\" </p> <p>Lembit Opik, the Liberal Democrat MP for Montgomeryshire, has been pushing the government to take the issue seriously for two years. \"If the report confirms a clear and present danger of an impact of global significance, and that we can do something about it with today's technology, I shall be happy,\" he said yesterday. </p> <p><strong>Space invaders</strong></p> <p> A <strong> comet</strong> is part of the builder's rubble left over from the making of the planets. Comets live at the far edge of the solar system and every so often are dislodged into long orbits round the <strong> sun</strong> , occasionally crashing into one of the planets in the way. </p> <p><strong> Asteroids</strong> - believed to be the fragments of a planet that never formed - live in a belt between <strong> Mars</strong> and <strong> Jupiter</strong> and every now and then one is tipped into a different flight path. </p> <p>Experts at Cornell University calculate the earth is at the centre of a network of asteroid \"superhighways\" and that a collision is inevitable at some point in the future. They know of 900 asteroids of 1km or more that could smash into the earth. But they calculate that there could be as many again yet to be detected. </p> <p>Asteroids are believed to be hard, stony, heavy objects rich in metals. There are commercial plans to \"quarry\" them in space and there are several space missions to explore asteroids and comets. </p> <p>Comets are mostly ice and dust and tend to break up under the gravitational tug of a big planet or the sun. Fascinated astronomers watched a dozen fragments of <strong> Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9</strong> crash one at a time into <strong> Jupiter</strong> in 1994. </p> <p>A large asteroid that hit the earth at 10 miles a second would turn into a fireball, sending sonic booms and shockwaves through the atmosphere. If it hit solid earth, it would form a crater 10 times its own size and the shockwave would level brick walls thousands of miles away. A big one would set the skies alight, and then shower the stratosphere with dust, blotting out the sun, shutting down all plant growth and condemning those who survived the shock and fire to death by cold and starvation.</p>",

  "We are individuals as well as social beings, and open to accusations of selfishness and hypocrisy. In principle, I am opposed to capital punishment. But then I think of the people I would like to kill, and I wonder what I would do if I were minister for executions. And I realise quite what a bad idea capital punishment is. <p>Or let us take the hot issue of transport. Clearly, we need more people to use public transport. But, if I'm selfish, I can't say I'd look forward to that, because I already use it and am frequently stuck behind people who seem to be using it for the first time. Railway ticket staff operate as a counselling service, dealing with endless inquiries from inexperienced passengers: \"So the train will just stop, and I don't have to hold my hand out or wave or anything. Right. And which platform is it?... Oh, I see, it depends where I'm going. Well where are some good places to go?\" </p> <p>Then of course, there is the whole issue of road usage. Very few people want the car banned, and none of them can drive. That's merely an observation; I'm not saying you have to be guilty of something before you say it should be illegal. That would mean that you believe in one law for yourself and another for everyone else. I don't know what's worse, denunciations of dope-smoking from people who don't happen to like it, or people who secretly smoke it? And is it hypocritical or selfless for a politician to promote heterosexual marriage when his own interests clearly lie elsewhere? </p> <p>When it comes to motoring and tax, accusations of hypocrisy fly like the pickets we used to see in the happier days when the law allowed protests by people other than the self-employed. Union leaders who denounced this week's protests were, quite unjustifiably, accused of using militant tactics themselves. In fact, they sold their members out years ago. The Liverpool dockers got no more support from the T and G than they did from the hauliers. The TUC should not be denouncing others for bringing the country to a standstill, but remembering that it can be done. </p> <p> Rightwing commentators of the \"am I the only person who is heartily sick...?\" variety rage against \"union muscle\" as though union relaxation exercises hadn't replaced it. Tabloid Falangists herald a revolt by white self-employed Britain, and churn out made-up anecdotes to prove that a \"new establishment\" of gays, asylum seekers and anti-racist environmentalists now run the world and are all hypocrites. \"A taxi driver I know was driving a well-dressed millionaire teacher to a champagne reception hosted by Archbishop Desmond Tutu. There she was, banging on about cruelty to pets and he looked around, and surprise, surprise, not only was her handbag leather, but in it were the severed heads of six kittens.\" </p> <p>The right accuse those of us who advocate higher income tax of really wanting \"higher taxes for everyone else\", which doesn't even begin to make sense. I suppose it means that, although we demand properly funded hospitals and schools and redistribution of income, we ourselves would just carry on paying the old tax rate and the government would be unable to do anything about it. </p> <p>What is true is that when people call for higher taxes, they usually mean progressive direct taxes on individuals and company profits. Indirect taxation is by its nature iniquitous, and yet the EU demands VAT be charged on bridge tolls that people shouldn't have to pay anyway. And it is all very well calling for high fuel taxes if you can easily afford them. </p> <p>Certainly, our roads are congested and our health and environment are being badly damaged. But we need clean air, not dirty air that is a nice earner for the chancellor. Where are the low fares, electric buses and green diesel? Taxes aren't forcing commercial traffic (the principle cause of the problems) off the roads, and if the revenue raised is truly being used to fix the environment, then how exactly? Is the globe being cooled in some way, perhaps by slices of cucumber being placed all over it? In fact, nothing much of anything seems to be being done with the revenue. Otherwise the government could get away with raising it from fuel. </p> <p>If people thought schools and hospitals were enjoying a golden age and genuine efforts were being made to develop clean energy, it would have been easier for ministers to turn the public against hauliers and farmers. The country isn't suddenly in love with diesel fumes and pesticides in the way it once was with Diana. Fuel prices affect everybody but they are not the only factor in people's view of the world, even if they are unfair. In fact, some of those protesting this week wouldn't have been doing so if they genuinely believed that good comes from the fuel taxes they pay. They weren't all selfish rightwing bastards. Not all taxi drivers are Tories. </p> <p><br><a href=\"mailto:comment@theguardian.com\">comment@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>John Steinbeck wrote 'big books' and 'little books'. With one exception, his little books have proved to be more popular than the grander, symbol-heavy novels that the author may have believed to be the more profound. Who would not rather relax in Cannery Row than appeal To a God Unknown? Or dawdle in Sweet Thursday rather than toil in The Winter of Our Discontent? The exception is The Grapes of Wrath (1939), a monument in American literature, a novel of political engagement which none the less avoids the abiding problems of protest fiction, speaking from inside the individual characters' heads, and fulfilling the first obligation of the novelist: to tell a good story. That story of poor white migrants is Steinbeck's finest sustained performance, for which the earlier tragedies and social comedies appear in retrospect to have been preparation.</p> <p>The opening sentences of The Grapes of Wrath are masterful in the way they evoke not just a landscape, but also the way of life of the people who have tried to coax a living from it:</p> <blockquote> 'To the red country and part of the gray country of Oklahoma, the last rains came gently, and they did not cut the scarred earth. The plows crossed and recrossed the rivulet marks. The last rains lifted the corn quickly and scattered weed colonies and grass alongside the sides of the roads so that the gray country and the dark red country began to disappear under a green cover. In the last part of May the sky grew pale... and as the sky became pale, so the earth became pale...' </blockquote> <p>There is probably no writer in English this century who has mined so much poetry out of poverty, as Steinbeck. The Joads, the 'Okie' family at the heart of The Grapes of Wrath, might as well be specks of dust in the parched land they are struggling to get away from: no one cares about them, no one wants to employ them; they have no money, no possessions - even the home they abandoned was one half of someone else'sll they have is the prospect, the mirage, of the Promised Land.</p> <p>They are 'white trash': an appalling term, which Steinbeck would surely have regarded as not just disrespectful but sacrilegious. On almost every page, he conjures a scene which confirms the Joads as flesh-and-blood creations. Sometimes all it takes is a dash of absurdity which strikes a realistic note (Steinbeck had a sharp eye for the absurd). When Grandpa Joad expires on the trail out West, the lapsed preacher Casy is called on to say a few words over the corpse. 'This here ol' man jus' lived a life and jus' died out of it,' he intones. 'I don't know whether he was good or bad, but that don't matter much. He was alive, an' that's what mattersn' now he's dead, an' that don't matter.'</p> <p>The colours on the flag Steinbeck flies are decency, humility, affection. In every case, they speak for themselves, but in many of his books Steinbeck felt it necessary to insert a little homily on the communal virtues early in the narrative. In Tortilla Flat, his story of Mexican-American peasants, or paisanos, living in Monterey, it is more explicit than in most: 'The paisanos are clean of commercialism, free of the complicated systems of American business, and, having nothing that can be stolen, exploited or mortgaged, that system has not attacked them very vigorously.' This was not considered very American, in an era during which 'commercialism' was regarded as the social dynamo; but it is very Steinbeck.</p> <p>Steinbeck has always appealed in particular to the young. He has a love of innocence, a liking for mischief, and an idealism which can be relied on to reach beyond practical considerations into a zone of pure good. He was fond of talking about his works in terms of musical form - structured like a symphony, and so on - but he is always better when he is Woody Guthrie than when trying to be Beethoven.</p> <p>Readers of Steinbeck should not expect to encounter characters who embody the moral (and racial) ambivalence of Faulkner's Joe Christmas, for example, the desperate white-skinned black man with the suggestive name from Light in August; or Hemingway's Jake Barnes, from The Sun Also Rises. Or even the enigmatic Jay Gatsby, personification of a whole range of New World pathologies.</p> <p>In the Steinbeck universe, it is always an easier matter to distinguish good from bad, than in that of Hemingway or Faulkner or Fitzgerald, which no doubt partly accounts for Steinbeck's poor showing in academic respectability in recent decades. We know exactly where we stand when Lennie falls foul of Curley in Of Mice and Men. In the work of other writers, there is often irony or ambivalence for the reader to unpick, but in Steinbeck one learns quickly to take the virtue - and the vice - at face value.</p> <p>So good a descriptive writer is he, that it is not necessary to climb out of the armchair to know what Steinbeck Country looks and feels and smells like:</p> <blockquote> 'The sun was coming over the ridge now, glaring on the whitewash of the houses and barns, making the wet grass blaze softly. Behind him, in the tall sagebrush, the birds were scampering on the ground, making a great noise among the dry leaves; the squirrels piped shrilly on the side-hills. Jody looked along at the farm buildings. He felt an uncertainty in the air.' </blockquote> <p>The uncertainty here involves the secret gift of the red pony, about to be revealed in the exquisite little book of that name. Jodey's devotion to it is almost painful to witness, the more so as he learns a hard lesson when the pony falls ill, and Billy the farmhand, Jodey's once infallible hero, promises to save its life. Steinbeck was guilty occasionally of mawkishness - particularly in the later books, when celebrity, partly unwanted, had distanced him from his subject matter - but although he looked caringly on the poor, he strove to avoid condescension. There is bitterness in Tom Joad's explanation of why his father never learned to write, but there is wit, as well: 'Ever' time Pa seen writin', somebody took somepin away from him.'</p> <p>John Steinbeck did not suffer the material deprivations of his creations. He was born in Salinas, California, in 1902, and later spent six years ducking in and out of an English degree at Stanford University. His first novel, Cup of Gold, was published in 1929. It sold in the low hundreds. The next two did scarcely any better.</p> <p>It was with Tortilla Flat, his fourth book, that Steinbeck began to find his own voice, and with it a degree of success. The Grapes of Wrath won a Pulitzer Prize in 1939, became a massive bestseller and was made into a film with Henry Fonda. Several other books were brought to the screen as well. Steinbeck is, in a sense, a cinematic writer, in that he favoured spare description, short scenes each with a central action, and vivid, characterful dialogue; but none of his novels has been superseded by its movie version. The weather of Steinbeck Country may be felt only in the language.</p> <p>The voice he found with Tortilla Flat was not his own at all - it was a Hispanic voice, and in order to make it seem authentic, Steinbeck contrived a strange device. When Danny unexpectedly inherits a house, his friend Pilon, fearing the worst, says: 'Let money come and charity flies away. So it is with thee, my once-friend. Thou art lifted above thy friends. Thou art a man of property. Thou wilt forget the friends who shared everything with thee, even thy brandy.' Before long, the reader gets used to this convention, and the deadpan wisdom wrapped up in it: 'If all the dew were diamonds, we would be very rich. We would be drunk all our lives,' Pablo says, adopting a tone of sagacity to make a basic point about his own needs. This pearl receives the reply it deserves, from Pilon: 'Everybody would then have too many diamonds. There would be no price for them, but wine always costs money.' And 'besides', as someone else says, 'the bottle is empty'.</p> <p>Tortilla Flat was converted into white Americana 10 years later in Cannery Rowlthough set in the 1930s, this short novel was written in 1945, and it came like a breath of post-war fresh air. It is based in the same part of California as Tortilla Flat. For Cannery Row, Steinbeck said, he just opened the pages 'and let the stories crawl in'.</p> <p>That's nonsense, of course: it is a carefully crafted, plotless book, which moves along with the kind of narrative ease that does not come without skill and experience. The cast consists of bums, good-time girls, the shopkeeper Lee Chong who specialises in a whisky called Old Tennis Shoes, and intellectuals such as Doc the biologist and Henri the painter, who used to work in 'glue, iron rust and chicken feathers', but changed to nutshells after an epiphany while listening to Doc's recordings of Gregorian chant. The book represents a tidepool containing the flotsam and jetsam of the local world, much like the tidepools Doc examines for his studies in biology. In one of these, halfway through the novel, Doc has a shocking vision of death - and it provides an anchor for a story which is otherwise all humour and pathos.</p> <p>Steinbeck took other chances in Cannery Row. There were few novels at the time which would risk passages such as Steinbeck's amusing and probably accurate disquisition on the 'moral, physical, and aesthetic effect' of the Model T Ford: 'Two generations of Americans know more about the Ford coil than the clitoris, about the planetary system of gears than the solar system of stars.'</p> <p>A follow-up to Cannery Row, Sweet Thursday, was published in 1954, for those who just couldn't get enough of Mack and the boys and their ingenious schemes, such as running a Model T uphill in reverse, when first gear has insufficient purchase.</p> <p>By then, Steinbeck was established as one of the leading contemporary American authors, on his way to the Nobel Prize, which he was granted in 1962 (Faulkner had won it in 1949, and Hemingway in 1954). His widespread appeal is based on his honest negotiation of an uncomplicated (though not unhazardous) moral maze, but there may be another reason, to do with his distinctive Americanness.</p> <p>Steinbeck was anything but avant garde. Inclined by nature to sing a plain man's song, he made gentle experiments with narrative rhythm - as in the novella which tells the same story three times in three different historical and social settings. But such experiments hesitate before the hard-edge modernism which might risk unpopularity, or incomprehensibility, such as Faulkner's thrilling adventures in form provoked in the 1920s and early 30s, and which makes much 20th century literature of the post-Ulysses, post-Waste Land era 'difficult'.</p> <p>Hemingway, Dos Passos and Fitzgerald also absorbed modern European influences, to an extent that Steinbeck was temperamentally inclined to refuse. There is no equivalent in his apprenticeship to the part played in Hemingway's early life by Gertrude Stein, or in Faulkner's education by Joyce. By comparison, Steinbeck seems like homegrown stuff, almost folksy. It is a risk he was happy to run, and he would not have seen the comment as a criticism.</p> <p>It is this thoroughgoing Americanness that brought Steinbeck alongside Jack Kerouac as a standard author in the hip curriculum of the 1960s. The hero of Kerouac's Californian Beat novel The Dharma Bums, Japhy Ryder, an American Zen Buddhist with solitary tendencies and a store of exotic expertise, has much in common with Doc of Cannery Row. Doc also nods occasionally in the direction of the East (rather than Europe). Indeed, viewed side by side today with Kerouac's Japhy (who was based on the poet Gary Snyder), Doc seems less stuck in his own era, more recognisably modern. Steinbeck made a 1960s gesture of his own when he took to the road, at the age of 58, 'in search of America' - much to the alarm of his wife. He was accompanied only by his dog, after whom the resulting book was named: Travels with Charley, published in 1962.</p> <p>By then, Steinbeck was regarded with suspicion by a set of guardians of a different 'America' to the one he had been charting and describing ever since he raised his first cup of gold to the country in the 1920s. Steinbeck's solidarity with strikers and migrant labourers, and his corresponding antipathy to feral capitalism, made him a target of the FBI, under J Edgar Hoover. </p> <p>Steinbeck was as American as they come, but he was 'unAmerican' in the eyes of the communist-obsessed director. 'This land, this red land, is us,' he wrote in The Grapes of Wrath, the book which first got him labelled a communist sympathiser; 'every one a drum major leading a parade of hurts, marching with our bitternessnd some day - the armies of bitterness will all be going the same way. And they'll all walk together, and there'll be a dead terror from it.'</p> <p>In his book, Dangerous Dossiers: Exposing the Secret War Against America's Greatest Authors (1988), Herbert Mitgang notes that while the FBI file on Steinbeck does not take note of the fact that he received the 'international literary honour' of the Nobel Prize, it stresses that 'because many of Steinbeck's writings portrayed an extremely sordid and poverty-stricken side of American life, they were reprinted in both German and Russian and used by the Nazis and Soviets as propaganda against America.'</p> <p>An open-and-shut case of guilt by association. In reality, Steinbeck's writings are neither pro-Soviet nor anti-American. They form a photograph album of America, and in particular of that splendid region, Steinbeck Country, from which countless literary travellers have gratefully sent a postcard home.</p>"
