  "An international diplomatic effort was under way yesterday to impose a truce on two peoples who are hunkering down for war, a day after Israel rocketed Palestinian installations, in effect destroying the peace process. <p>After sporadic clashes in the West Bank that left at least one Palestinian dead and dozens injured, Washington and the United Nations were last night engaged in hectic attempts to arrange an international summit in Egypt to prevent the outbreak of a full-scale war. </p> <p>\"I do think there could be a summit,\" Kofi Annan, the UN secretary general, said. He had hurriedly returned to Israel after Thursday's cataclysmic events, which saw combat helicopters rocket the perimeters of Yasser Arafat's Gaza headquarters following the brutal killings of two Israeli soldiers. </p> <p>In addition to Mr Arafat and Ehud Barak, the Israeli prime minister, the summit would include representatives from Egypt, Jordan, the US and the UN, Palestinian officials said. The White House last night dropped its insistence that both sides had to renounce violence before a summit could be held. \"We are not setting any conditions to a meeting,\" the White House spokesman Jake Siewert told reporters. </p> <p>However, with Mr Barak and Mr Arafat refusing to speak directly, the convening of a summit remained far from certain. Mr Arafat has demanded that Israel lift the siege on the West Bank, where soldiers now man checkpoints blocking the exit of all Palestinian cars. The Gaza Strip has also been sealed off. </p> <p>There was no end to the violent convulsions that have gripped the region for more than a fortnight after Islamist organisations declared a day of rage. In the West Bank town of Hebron one man was shot in the chest by Israeli gunfire after he ran towards the soldiers chanting slogans in support of the Islamist Hamas movement. </p> <p>In Ramallah, the scene of Thursday's brutal lynching of the Israeli soldiers, crews of three Israeli tanks trained machine-gun fire on the hilltop hideout of a Palestinian sniper. Ambulance workers said at least three people were injured in another gun battle, including one man who had his kneecap blown off. </p> <p>There were also clashes in Bethlehem, outside a heavily guarded Jewish pilgrimmage site, and a Palestinian village on the outskirts of Jerusalem, where crowds blocked local roads with rocks and metal spikes. </p> <p>By the standards of recent days, which have seen nearly 100 people killed, almost all Palestinians, yesterday's clashes were of relatively low intensity. Israel carried out an additional rocket attack in Jericho late on Thursday night, destroying a building of the Palestinian police academy, but yesterday its use of tanks and rockets was more restrained. </p> <p>But with the conflict crossing a new threshold on Thursday, with Israel's use of firepower and with the Palestinian descent into mob rule, there was little room for optimism. Israeli military officials say they expect a round of sui cide bombing attacks following Mr Arafat's release of several hundred jailed Islamist militants, including the masterminds of previous outrages. </p> <p>There is an atmosphere of mourning - and fear - following yesterday's funeral for one of the killed soldiers. Israeli newspapers reported a grisly cellphone conversation between the wife of one of the soldiers and his killers, deepening a sense of revulsion. </p> <p>Fears that the conflict in Israel would spark a wave of terrorism across the Middle East and beyond were heightened yesterday morning when a bomb was thrown over the wall of the British embassy in Yemen. Windows were smashed but no one was hurt. </p> <p>The embassy bomb came less than a day after the suicide attack on the American destroyer USS Cole moored in Aden. Seven bodies of American sailors have been recovered, while 10 are still missing presumed dead. </p> <p>Protesters in several Arab cities, as well as in Palestinian refugee camps in Lebanon and Jordan, called for a jihad (holy war) against Israel. The ruling Taliban in Afghanistan also demanded immediate retaliation.Thousands of Indonesians protested in Jakarta, and Morocco recalled its envoy from Israel in protest. </p> <p>In Cairo, Sunni Islam's top authority, the sheikh of al-Azhar mosque, Mohammed Sayyid Tantawy, urged Muslims to cut all ties with Israel. </p> <p>Arab nations moved swiftly to provide aid to the Palestinians, sending five planeloads of medical supplies to Gaza via Egypt.</p>",
  "It may be war, but Raeda Ghazaleh, unusually amongst Palestinians, is still going to work each morning. A theatre director, she has been performing a play for schoolchildren in her home town of Bethlehem. The play is The Little Match Girl; the sad and dreamy match seller imagines a world where she can go to school, eat good food, find somewhere safe to live. <p>The parallels are painfully close. The schoolchildren in Bethlehem - some of only a handful whose schools are still open - are in shock, says Ghazaleh. They know that more than 100 Palestinians, many of them children, have been killed; all they talk of is blood and shooting, they jump at loud noises. A four-year-old came to school yesterday wearing five T-shirts, one layered on top of the other, because he thought it would protect him from the bullets. </p> <p>Of course there is fear amongst Palestinians; and of course there is anger. Every reporter this week has commented on the extent of the rage of those throwing stones in Gaza and Ramallah and Galilee; but why did it take the world by surprise? Palestinians on the ground - as opposed to those involved in peace talks - have been saying for years that they are disillusioned with this peace process, and for tangible reasons of poverty and exclusion, rather than simply politics. If the world had listened to the warnings, it might have been able to tackle the causes of the uprising before it was too late. </p> <p>A report by church charity World Vision stated it baldly back in May 1999: \"an increasing sense of disillusionment with the peace process by Palestinians may well ignite future violence\". The figures are startling: Palestinian GNP has fallen by 35% since the start of the Oslo peace process in 1993; unemployment has reached record levels, up to 40% in some areas; the average income is $1,500 per head in the West Bank and Gaza, compared with $2,500 in 1987, and with $17,000 in Israel. The closure policy, whereby cities are cut off from each other, has had disastrous economic and social consequences - disrupting trade, but also feeding a mounting sense of injustice. As a tourist with a British passport you are free to travel wherever you like in the West Bank, Gaza and Israel; but a Muslim Palestinian from Ramallah may not visit Jerusalem's al-Aqsa mosque, 10 miles away; and a Christian Palestinian from Bethlehem may not visit the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, the site of Christ's crucifixion, a distance of seven miles. </p> <p>About 18 months ago, I visited the Amari refugee camp between Jerusalem and Ramallah. The makeshift homes are poor and far too small for the large families who live in them, but inside they are neat, with wall-hangings of Mecca and mosque-shaped clocks. A Palestinian woman there, while bringing me tea, apologised for the fact that her children had dirty faces and clothes; it was because the camp received water only twice a week, she said. I looked up the hill to see a gleaming settlement, Bet-El, illegally built on Palestinian land outside of Israel, the grass on its lawns green and lush, watered with sprinklers. </p> <p>No wonder there is rage. Ordinary Palestinians always felt that the peace process was weighted against them - a fact apparently reflected by an anonymous Israeli government source quoted this week in the Independent: \"The Palestinians always complain that we know the details of every proposal from the Americans before they do,\" he said. \"There's a good reason for that; we write them.\" </p> <p>The Palestinians have always known that they are the racial underclass, but the overwhelmingly unequal nature of the conflict is so often left out of the peace equation. This is not a Balkan-style confrontation of two ancient hatreds. It was European Christians, not Muslims or Arabs, who led the persecution and ghettoisation of the Jewish people for most of the past 2,000 years. This is a modern conflict over land between an occupier and a subject people, the occupation long accepted as illegal by the United Nations; between a state with all the cards (a hugely powerful army, the support of the world's only superpower, control of electricity, water, most of the land) and a population with none. It is not a war between equals, and it is overwhelmingly Palestinians who are being killed. </p> <p> An end to conflict must be the priority. But peace does not happen just because we want it to - if the Palestinian population does not believe it has received justice, it's clear that there will not be peace. Ehud Barak, the prime minister of Israel, may have gone as far as he could at Camp David, and his public may not allow him to go further in the current circumstances. But in its own interests, Israel will have to do so, sooner or later. The \"East Jerusalem\" earmarked for the Palestinians at Camp David did not include the Arab part of the Old City, the bustling Damascus Gate, the shop-lined Salah al-Din Street or the Mount of Olives - all of which are currently Arab sections of the city. The \"East Jerusalem\" on offer at Camp David in fact effectively constituted the suburb of Abu Dis and the village of Bethany - like asking for Trafalgar Square and being required to settle for Croydon. No Palestinian leader could accept it and survive. </p> <p>There is a solution, probably still some way off, although the peace process went some way towards it. Yesterday I asked a Palestinian in Ramallah how this will end. \"The only end would be the end of the occupation,\" he said, his phone conversation broken up by the sound of shooting. If Palestine becomes a state, if Israel withdraws from all of the West Bank, Gaza and East Jerusalem, if the UN provides protection for and access to the religious sites, and if the issue of the right to return for refugees is addressed, then the Palestinian community seems likely to accept the loss of pre-1967 Israel and a permanent peace has a chance. </p> <p>Next week, if the Bethlehem schools are still open, Raeda Ghazaleh's theatre company will be performing another play; about a boy's search for his grandfather, and how this helps him understand himself. Like him, we must understand the history of the Palestinian people and the reality of their conflict with Israel if we are to understand their situation now, and if we have any hope of finding a solution. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:katharine.viner@theguardian.com\">katharine.viner@theguardian.com</a></p>",

  "Last Friday, the law firm Bhatt Murphy was rung by the Mail on Sunday, who said they were writing a piece about detention of refugees and were interested in featuring one of their clients. This is like being rung by the British National party and asked to give your address so they can send you their autumn catalogue. If the Mail were ever to question the justice of jailing refugees, it would be to promote sterilisation as the alternative. <p>The reason for the sudden interest in the client, whose asylum claim was upheld by the appeals tribunal and who is therefore legally resident, was that he is suing the Home Office. He claims that the last three months of his detention were unlawful because the Home Office was in possession of all the information that led to his asylum claim being upheld. Part of his complaint is that, after complaining about conditions in the notorious Campsfield House, he was handcuffed and moved to prison. </p> <p>Bhatt Murphy asked the Mail to guarantee their client's anonymity, for his safety and that of his family still in Algeria. The Mail's position is that, given that he is bringing a civil action, his identity is public. This raises the question that if the whole world is talking about it already, why does the Mail think it's such a scoop? If the British public and the Algerian government spend their days at the Royal Courts of Justice, scouring the daily listings and sitting in on civil suits, the story is redundant. Actually, there are people who do that, but most are homeless, few look Algerian and I doubt whether any are Mail readers. Mail readers haven't sat in on trials since the death penalty was abolished. </p> <p> Nevertheless, the newspaper refused to accept that the man or his family might suffer as a result of the story. Bhatt Murphy found themselves explaining that fear of persecution is what being a refugee is all about. It's not a legal status the Home Office confers with gladness of heart. Moreover, not all regimes are above taking out their frustration with exiles on friends and family. </p> <p>To spell it out for the Mail, the solicitors referred the paper to guidelines from the United Nations high commissioner for refugees. But the paper was determined, feeling best placed to make judgments about the safety of political dissidents abroad. Perhaps the Mail should start an advice page in its international edition with hints on evading arrest and torture. But I suppose the suggestion \"Stay calm and don't move, especially here\" would become repetitive. </p> <p>On Saturday Bhatt Murphy won a court ruling against the Mail, and on Sunday the paper grumpily informed readers that it wasn't allowed to put the man's family at risk. However the paper was able to give us illuminating quotes from Ann Widdecombe and Robin Corbett, who is a Labour MP and chair of the home affairs committee. </p> <p>Widdecombe told us, \"It is perfectly proper for asylum seekers to be detained, particularly where there is good reason to fear they may disappear before their case is decided.\" Well, under her proposals, there would be no \"particularly\"; she wants to put them all in camps, which she calls \"reception centres\". I have spoken to many a receptionist; they are usually charming and none has ever held me in a headlock, smashed my belongings or said, \"Go home if you don't like it.\" </p> <p>But Labour's reign has scarcely been more humane than Widdecombe's notion of what it is to meet and greet. Despite the perpetual blather about the fear of refugees absconding, most of those in detention are awaiting decisions, cannot be deported and have no reason to go on the run. About one in seven refugees are detained the second they arrive, and one in 10 are still in jail three months later. The man in the Mail story endured 19 months of detention. The fact that he is suing over only three months of it shows considerable forbearance in my view. </p> <p>At present more than 1,000 refugees are in camps and prisons, with Jack Straw hoping to build on that success by jailing another 1,700. So it is not surprising that the loyal minion Robin Corbett gave the Mail this piece of wisdom: \"It seems a very churlish way to show gratitude to a country which has given him sanctuary.\" </p> <p>In the first place, the man is not suing the country; he is suing the Home Office. In the second place, just how long is a refugee supposed to bow and scrape? Must his children also feel grateful that the government conceded something to their father that was his by right? Can the government do what it likes to people if they weren't born here, and should they be jolly thankful if they're not tortured? </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:comment@theguardian.com\">comment@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "Television footage of Israeli attack helicopters bombing the West Bank and Gaza on Thursday prompted fierce reaction yesterday across the Muslim world, with crowds from Egypt to Afghanistan calling for a holy war to revenge their Palestinian brothers. <p>About 10,000 worshippers poured on to the streets after Friday prayers at Cairo's al-Azhar mosque demanding war with Israel and shouting: \"There is no god but God, and the Jews are the enemies of God.\" </p> <p>The worshippers had been listening to Sheikh Mohammed Sayyid Tantawy. He is reported to have urged Muslims to cut off all ties with Israel and rally to the Palestinian cause, noting that Egypt had already \"waged four wars for the sake of Palestine\". </p> <p>Chanting slogans would not be enough, he said. \"Only being firm would help\". </p> <p>In Kabul, preachers invoked a holy war at Friday prayers, while the ruling Taliban called for instant revenge. \"We strongly condemn Israel's oppressions against defenceless Palestinians and support the righteous cause of Palestine,\" a Taliban spokesman said. </p> <p>The leaders of Egypt, Jordan, Syria and Saudi Arabia are expected to meet this weekend in Riyadh to prepare for a plenary Arab summit conference, due on October 21, which will draw up a collective Arab policy on the Israeli-Palestinian crisis. </p> <p>Their task will have been rendered all the more difficult by moves by the Israeli prime minister, Ehud Barak, to form an emergency government that includes the rightwing extremist opposition leader General Ariel Sharon. </p> <p>Since General Sharon triggered the Israeli-Palestinian upheaval with his visit to the al-Aqsa compound two weeks ago, Arabs have been rallying to the Palestinian cause with a vigour not seen for years. </p> <p>A similar note of renewed anger was struck by Palestinian refugees in Lebanon and Jordan yesterday. About 7,000 marched through the largest of Lebanon's refugee camps, Ein el-Hilweh, condemning Thursday's \"massacre\" and calling on Egypt and Jordan to sever relations with the state of Israel. </p> <p>They set fire to an effigy of Mr Barak which had been daubed with the words \"specialised in murdering children\". A model of the US secretary of state, Madeleine Albright, suffered a similar fate. </p> <p>Thousands of demonstrators staged angry demonstrations in Jordan, Bahrain and Turkey. </p> <p>Sheikh Hassan Nasrallah, the secretary general of Hizbullah, appealed to Arab leaders to follow the wishes of their people. \"Those whose countries have with ties with Israel should sever them. This is the least we can expect from the Egyptian president.\" </p> <p>Oman, which, along with Qatar, is one of two Gulf countries to have engaged in diplomatic \"normalization\" with Israel, ordered the closure of its trade mission in Tel Aviv, and Israel's in Muscat, following rare pro-Palestinian demonstrations there. </p> <p>Last week Jordan announced that it was delaying the departure of its new ambassador to Tel Aviv. </p> <p>The Egyptian president, Hosni Mubarak, who has strongly criticized two other Arab leaders, Colonel Gadafy of Libya and president Ali Abdullah Salih of Yemen, for their militant rhetoric, has shown no sign of heeding calls for ties to be cut. </p> <p>The US and Britain are monitoring a tank division of Saddam Hussein's Republican Guards, which moved west from Baghdad on Thursday. Satellite pictures showed no significant movement yesterday. </p> <p>Outside the Middle East, anger exploded in Indonesia when thousands of Muslims marched to the parliament in Jakarta to protest against the Israeli forces' actions. Students also threw rocks at the US embassy and clashed with police protecting the building.</p>",
  "Goldsborough Road in the hot summer sun smelled of dust and pigeons. I don't remember it in the rain. As children, up from the country every Friday to see our grandparents, the London children scared us slightly, at home in their street where my brother and I would only ever be visitors. They let us play football and hopscotch with them, a pleasure tinged with fear of loose dogs who knew us for the strangers we were, and Johnny the man-boy, who seemed to live nowhere in particular, who dribbled and smiled and did no harm, but who embarrassed us because we couldn't understand what he said. <p>In those days, the late 60s and early 70s, the two-storey terraced street in South Lambeth, near the site of the old Covent Garden fruit and vegetable market, had hardly changed since it had been purpose-built, mostly as flats, in the 1880s. Nana and Grandad's flat at No 31 was typical: the front door opened into a narrow corridor (\"the passage\"). First door on the right was the front room, always cold and, perversely, hardly ever used, despite the fact that space was at a premium. Next on the right was the bedroom, where Grandad might be sleeping - he worked nights at a printworks. At the end of the passage was the living room, although it was called the kitchen, and a door off that at the back led to a tiny kitchen, which was called the scullery. Here, Nana cooked and everyone washed; Grandad emerging, impossibly tall in white long johns, smelling of Golden Virginia and coal-tar soap. Open the back door off the scullery, and you were outside again, in a tiny pocket of private open air, the yard.</p> <p>This was the second address our grandparents lived at in Goldsborough Road; moving around the street was something everyone seemed to do. They'd been upstairs at 31A to begin with, and raised my dad and uncle, Reg and Ted, there. The flats had a small patch of flat roof instead of a yard. According to family legend, their dog, Bob, was sunning himself on the roof one day when one of the boys called to him from the street. Bob jumped off the roof and famously fatally impaled himself on the iron railings in the street below. (The railings are long gone now, melted down for the war effort, or dumped into the Channel, depending on which story you believe; and either Ted or Reg were to blame for poor Bob's sticky end, according to who's telling the tale.) By the time my brother, myself and our cousins arrived, Nana and Grandad had moved downstairs, lost a roof and gained a yard.</p> <p>The yard was screened from the neighbours by a patchwork of fence and trellis. Leafy hints of adjacent gardens poked through, but Grandad had concreted his yard, banishing plants to pots on racks attached to the fence. Everything was painted green, and the plants were carefully labelled in stencilled white paint: COALIUS on the left, NURSTURIANTS on the right, and, defying Grandad's creative spelling, SWEET PEAS in the middle. He seems to have felt that nature was all very well, in its place - the country. His cement garden was weed-free, his plants exiled to pots where he could keep an eye on what they were up to. In Goldsborough Road, earth and dirt were considered the same thing.</p> <p>In one corner of the yard, exuding feathers and contented noises, was the pigeon coop. The pigeons later moved to the roof of a friend further up the street, and the coop became a Wendy house for our cousins and ourselves, but it still smelled of pigeons. We loved Grandad's yard. It was also the path to the lavatory. At night, as a child, slipping out to the loo under a starry sky was a small adventure. It wasn't until I was much older, and read about outside toilets and homes without bathrooms, that I realised that this was considered a less than ideal arrangement. To us, sitting in the tin bath in front of the coal fire in the \"kitchen\" was always a treat, a convivial and social event, when grown-ups looked at us and smiled at each other.</p> <p>Before the street was dominated by parked vehicles, it used easily to accommodate a sprawling game of football; only a handful of cars belonged in the street, and those that didn't belong never came down it, as it wasn't on the way to anywhere. The fact that the street was the place to play meant that no one minded - or even noticed - the postage-stamp yards. The yard was where you hung the washing. If people wanted to sit in the sun, they never sat in the yard; the men, like Grandad, placed a kitchen chair, back to front, outside the front door and sat on it facing the street, resting their arms on the chair-back, reading the paper, or having a smoke or a chat with a neighbour who was doing the same. </p> <p>Although there were no front gardens, the strip of pavement directly outside \"belonged\" to the house, and most people regularly swept their patch. No inhabitant of the street would pass another without exchanging a word; we would dangle about Grandad's chair, our prattle punctuated only by his \"Afternoon, George\", \"Alright, Charlie?\", \"Wotcher, Bill\", which was returned as naturally and inevitably as breathing. </p> <p>It's not, of course, that people have changed, but the way we live. Most of the people in that street had lived there for longer than they cared to remember. Our grandparents were typical, having moved there when they got married, each having been born in streets either side. That's why everyone knew everyone - they couldn't avoid them.</p> <p>Grandad was long dead before indoor plumbing came to Goldsborough Road; the scullery became a bathroom and the kitchen really was a kitchen. Nana - at last - used the front room, and was able in her 80s to have a bath without lugging the tin one off its nail in the coal hole and laboriously filling it up with buckets of hot water from the scullery. She lived there until she died, aged 93. When it was built, Goldsborough Road was one of many similar parallel streets, and was unexceptional. Now the world around it has been swept away; what escaped being flattened by the Luftwaffe has been decimated by developers, leaving Goldsborough Road and the few streets around it as accidental survivors of prewar London, an island of the old city. All around, new flats, new streets have sprung up. When we were kids, a lot of this was still wasteland, undeveloped since it was bombed during the war. Parts of houses stood in places, propped up until someone got around to pulling them down; here and there, the incongruous sight of a fireplace set in a square of flowered wallpaper defied floorlessness, rooflessness, hopelessness. We were not allowed to play near these teetering skeletons, where unexploded bombs might still lurk.</p> <p>As a student in London in my 20s, I often stayed with Nana, and noted things the child had missed. Visitors always remarked on how peaceful it was - the street was exceptionally quiet for the heart of London. For a residential area only minutes from the West End by car, it surprisingly escaped being either pretentious or grotty. A certain amount of yuppie gentrification had taken place, but the overall impression was of a pleasant, unambitious street that had been left to its own devices and decided not to do much at all.</p> <p>For some reason - probably cost - there is no access to the back yards from the street; when Grandad used to come home on his motor scooter, he wheeled it through the passage, which clung to its oily whiff. The Goldsborough Road of our Dad's childhood still featured horses; the milkman who lived in the street was obliged to take his horse through his house after his round, to stable it in his back yard. His anxious wife pursued him, offering up a bucket in case of a mishap on the short journey. An early memory of my Dad's is of two great shire horses panicking (for some forgotten reason) in the street and thundering over the cobbles, pulling a driverless cart behind them, imminently threatening to trample some passing unfortunate to death (were they headed straight for an unattended pram?). Grandad heroically went to the rescue, grabbing and calming the horses and saving lives right, left and centre. My father acknowledges the pernicious effects of romance on the memory: the image in his mind is of Grandad being lifted high into the air by the rearing beasts as he clung bravely to the reins, but he readily admits this was probably not the case. Perhaps there was only one horse. A small one. Nevertheless, the act seemed heroic at the time, and as the memory fades the imagination repairs it, so its essence should not be lost. So it is with Goldsborough Road. Can I really remember it? Or just the idea of it? My cousin, Martin, a photographer, wanted to go back and find out whether there was any trace of what had seemed indefinably precious about Goldsborough Road. The last time we'd been there was five years ago, for Nana's funeral. Now that we had no claim on the street, would its spell have been broken? Would it be noisier, dirtier, less friendly, more ordinary than we had fondly believed? There were more immediate anxieties, too: I was worried that no one would talk to us - why should they? Martin was concerned that his camera might put them off. So, full of misgiving, we went to South Lambeth on one of the hottest days of last summer to discover whether this London street still held the charm of the golden borough of our childhood.</p> <p>\u00a9 Sarah Burton 2000.

She is now at her third address in Goldsborough Road. 'You don't know everybody in the street like you used to, but people are fairly friendly.' She remembers Johnny, the child-like man who had so disconcerted us as kids. </p> <p>'He loved cars. He used to like to open the doors. If anyone had a go at him, the other kids used to protect him. That family moved away. I heard his mother died and he went into care. Then he died.' We asked what it was like living there during the war. 'When you think about it now, you think it was really frightening, and we were scared during the raids. But it just became part of life; you had to get on with it. We used to go under the railway arches, and there'd be hot soup and we'd entertain ourselves. We did enjoy ourselves and made the most of it.'</p> <p><b>Ola</b> Ola works for the Home Office. 'I like it here, it's safe and quiet. Once a friend had some things stolen from her car, but that was really strange. When I first came here on the bus, I thought, \"Oh my God, where have I come to?\" But as soon as I turned the corner at the top of the street, I thought, \"Yeah. This is nice.\"'</p> <p><b>Peter</b> Peter has lived with his partner, Graham, in the street for four years. 'People say hello, and do congregate over issues, but we're not in and out of each others' houses all the time. One day, we challenged someone who was dumping rubbish. Usually, you'd be on your own, but neighbours gathered round and said, \"What do you think you're doing?\"'</p> <p><b>Clare and Robin</b> Clare and Robin work in marketing and have lived in the street for four months. Says Robin: 'It's handy for work' - Robin works in the West End and Clare in the City - 'and it's so quiet. We plan to stay indefinitely.'</p> <p><b>James and Sascha</b> James and Sascha, a product manager for a paper manufacturer and a nursery school teacher, came to Goldsborough Road four years ago and have owned five properties in the street. Starting off in an upstairs flat, they have now bought and extended a house to accommodate the family they plan to have. 'It's quiet, close to the centre of town and the neighbours are so friendly. We'd only move now if we moved out of London,' says James.</p> <p><b>Jessie</b> Jessie is our second cousin, and is our only remaining connection with Goldsborough Road. She moved into her flat in 1945, and raised three sons there, two of whom were born at home. She knows most people, and waters plants and feeds cats for absent neighbours. </p> <p>We asked her whether it was true that when our dads were kids people didn't lock their doors. 'In the summer we didn't even shut them. We'd sleep with the front door and the back door open to get a breeze through the place. Everyone did. All along the street all the doors were wide open all night. It was just what you did. In the summer, after the pub on a Saturday night, we'd have a whip-round and get a crate of beer. The men would push the piano out into the street and we'd have a party. People didn't have a lot of money, but we knew how to enjoy ourselves all right.'</p> <p><b>Bertie</b> Bertie is nearly 10, and has lived on the street for more than half his life. He used to live full-time with Dominic and Jacqui, but due to their work commitments now spends more time across the street with Jessie, of whom he is fiercely protective. He is a frequent visitor to other addresses in the street. 'He loves it here and they all love him,' Jessie assures us.</p> <p><b>Bill and Mel</b> Bill and Mel are journalists. Mel bought the flat three years ago. Mel said: 'At first I thought the street looked very unlikely, but it's really nice. The first summer we were here, the family next door often played backgammon on a table on the pavement - the grandad, the kids ... The street's got a lot smarter recently. There's always someone decorating or renovating activity. We'd only move for more space.'</p> <p><b>Melek</b> Melek lives next door to her daughter, Samiye, and her family. She moved to Goldsborough Road in 1968, from Putney, and was born in Cyprus. She's not as keen on leaving as her daughter. 'My husband never wanted to move, and since he died I find it quite hard to leave the memories. Everyone is nice, not just the old people. A young man came and knocked on the door the other day and said, \"Hello, I am so-and-so, I have just moved in.\" It's nice. I went to stay with my other daughter in Sidcup. Apart from the next-door neighbour, it seemed nobody cared about anybody. I got so depressed. People are warm and polite here. I wouldn't let it go easily.'</p> <p><b>Michael, Steve and Larry</b> Michael is a chartered surveyor: 'I've lived here for eight months and I'm looking for my own flat in the street. It's friendly, there's no residents' parking, I like the ice-cream vans. In summer, the terraces hum with the buzz of people outside. It's homely.' Steve works in IT: 'I've lived here for three weeks. It's convenient and I really like the house.' Larry works in banking: 'I moved in two days ago. It's handy for Chelsea football ground and the West End. So far, so good.'</p> <p><b>Susan</b> Susan is a liaison officer at King's College Hospital and has lived in two flats in the street. She was born in Walthamstow, the eldest of six children, but the family emigrated to Australia in 1963 and she's the only one to have come back (in 1968, aged 21). 'I think it's a lovely street and such a fantastic location. People say it's quiet, but they mean traffic. I like the human noises - they're comforting sounds. One day I'll go back to Australia to be with my parents, who are getting on, but I'll stay here until then.'</p> <p><b>Dominic, Jacqui and Alex</b> Dominic and Jacqui lived in Sri Lanka and Ecuador before coming to Goldsborough Road five years ago. Says Dominic, a technology marketing manager for Motorola:'When we were looking for a property, our criteria were: it had to have a kitchen big enough to eat in and a roof terrace. Most estate agents just laughed. But here we are ... Within 24 hours of moving in, a neighbour had noticed we hadn't got any curtains and produced some.' Jacqui, an IT consultant, works from home and admits, 'I'm sure some people wouldn't like it. You're not anonymous.' With the arrival of their daughter, Alex, they needed more space than their upstairs flat afforded, but they didn't want to leave the street; it was a problem they solved quickly: 'We liked it so much we bought the downstairs.'</p> <p><b>Garri</b> Garri runs a record label. 'I've lived here for 15 years and I don't know anybody. I'm quite shy, really. When I first came, the rent was \u00a336 a week, and it's still cheap. At first it felt very dangerous - there was a kind of crimewave in the mid-80s, but I soon became attached to the area. I love walking down the streets and not hearing English. There are Ethiopians, Portuguese ... they've transformed the local shops, and it's more alive.' We asked Garri if he thought he'd ever move - he replied that he'd been at home on the day of our grandmother's funeral. 'I watched the hearse pull out of the street and thought, \"One day that could be me being carted off.\" It wasn't a bad feeling.'</p> <p><b>Marjorie and Edward</b> Marjorie and Edward moved to the street in 1946. Marjorie had come from Yorkshire. 'I thought London was the loneliest place on earth,' she says. Their flat remains largely unchanged, with its original fireplace and tongue-and-groove wood panelling in the front passage. 'There used to be a lot more children,' says Marjorie. 'They all played in the street, so you had to watch your windows! Crime wasn't a problem,' she adds. 'There was nothing to take.'</p> <p><b>Annette</b> Annette fell in love with her flat straight away, but she is not so enamoured of the street since six months ago, when youths set fire to some rubbish bins. 'It's one thing setting fire to a bin, but to push it up against the front door ... I thought I'd stay here forever, hobbling to Sainsbury's when I'm 90, but not any more. You keep yourself to yourself now, which is a shame.'</p> <p><b>Mark</b> Mark came to London from Canada in the early 60s. An ex-dancer, he is now a special needs teacher, and moved to the street in 1981. 'It's an island,' he says, taking us into his garden where, as if to prove the point, tropical plants flower. 'These are really conservatory plants, but it's so sheltered here.' He doesn't anticipate moving: 'It's cheap, safe, and so close to the centre of town. If you stand on a little box on my neighbour's roof garden, you can see the Houses of Parliament,' he says, and laughs.</p>",
  "<p>If you want to make any sort of progress in today's world, you have to know how to handle two things: a golf mallet and a fish knife. This is because the only time people talk to each other is when they're eating or playing golf. With golf, you can get away with continual swearing, but table manners are a sterner test. First, you should never start eating before anyone else, although it's worth making a quiet check on whether they actually ordered a starter. Once you get started, you will often have more cutlery in front of you than you have in your drawer at home. The polite thing to do is make sure you use every single implement on every course, even if it's soup. After you've used an implement, store it in the little jug marked with the flower. </p> <p>At some stage, the waiter may bring a bottle of wine for your approval. The correct thing to do is to check the alcohol content - if it's lower than 15%, send it straight back. Once you've checked the alcohol content, they will pour a tiny amount into your glass. This is sheer meanness on their part. You've paid for it, so insist on a full glass. You can then go ahead and taste the wine. Just remember that spitting it out is the right thing to do and the correct receptacle for this is the ice bucket by the table of the romantic couple sitting next to you. </p> <p>Napkin-folding is one of the cornerstones of western civilisation, and staff in a good restaurant should be able to transform a damask napkin into a fully functioning stegosaurus in less time than it takes you to find the right end of an asparagus spear. Waiting staff are always happy to demonstrate this skill, so wait until they've spread it across your lap and then say you preferred it in its mating-duck form. There is often some confusion between a napkin and a serviette, and getting it wrong is a clear signal that you are as common as dirt. The golden rule is that where there is an even number dining, napkins are serviettes, and vice versa. </p> <p>Certain foods have for years provided a litmus test for social skills. For example, asking for two fishfingers is tantamount to slapping your host in the face. Similarly, taking a mouthful of alphabet soup without a vowel is wretchedly common. The ultimate challenge, of course, is lobster, when you're given a bowl and a pair of nutcrackers. It takes years of practice to find the lobster's nuts and then get them into the bowl, but socially it pays huge dividends.</p>",
  "<p>First-night audiences in the West End are an entirely different breed from normal theatre-goers. These are people done up in their glad rags and with a serious job to do: to further the interests of the show by clapping and cheering loudly, however excruciating the performance. They are the 21st-century equivalent of the claque, paid not with cash but an invitation to the post-show party. The applause at the end of a West End first night usually bears no more relation to the merits of the show than the response of proud parents to the infant school nativity play. </p> <p>On Monday, however, the much-hyped opening of The Seven Year Itch gave a new twist to the phenomenon. As the show progressed, the audience took to applauding Daryl Hannah and the rest of the cast every time they left the stage. This may have been an uncharacteristic fit of honesty, reflecting their delight in seeing them go, but it sounded more like a mark of sympathy for a team engaged in a losing battle with a script whose wit had expired somewhere in the 1950s. </p> <p>Clapping actors during the performance is nothing new, however. It is common in the West End for audiences to applaud the first entrance of major stars, as if grateful that they bothered to show up at all. Elderly actors always get a particularly big hand. This has nothing to do with their acting ability and everything to do with their longevity. This applause does not mean \"You're marvellous\" but \"Isn't it amazing that you aren't gaga and in a bathchair?\" </p> <p>I recall matinee performances of As You Like It and Hamlet at Stratford in the 1980s when parts of the audience clapped soliloquies as if the actors were ice skaters who had just performed some fiendishly difficult triple axel. But sometimes it is not even the actors who get the applause. During the age of the big blockbuster musicals in the 1980s audiences frequently clapped the sets. </p> <p>What is new is audiences' increasing fondness for the standing ovation. In the past two years, theatre-goers have become more determined than ever to make their stand. Plenty of performances now end with small pockets of the audience standing to show their appreciation. </p> <p>Returning the favour, actors themselves are increasingly prone to applauding their audiences. This suggests a disturbing lack of confidence in both the play and their own abilities - as if they are astonished that we are there at all.</p>",
  "<p>This week's sharp falls in technology shares has strong echoes of the past; seven years ago the biggest investment fashion was not technology but emerging markets, but being a dedicated follower of fashion can cost your pocket dear. </p> <p>All of the major investment houses launched emerging markets funds in the early to mid-1990s, cashing in by selling to small investors the idea that the opening up of China and the globalisation of markets would bring staggering returns for those who got in on the ground floor. </p> <p>Then in 1997 a financial crisis hit Asia before sweeping across the rest of the world. During 1998 markets recovered, but in many cases it has proved short-lived; across South-east Asia stock markets have now slumped back to crisis levels. </p> <p>Since the beginning of this year Thailand's market is down 50%, Indonesia down 50.5%, Phillipines down 44.5%, Korea down 41.1% and Malaysia down 12.9%. Among all unit trusts, emerging markets funds have on average performed worse than any other type of fund over the past three years. </p> <p>So what now? Some emerging markets fund managers were this week putting a brave face on the figures, but others admit there's more pain to come. </p> <p>Korea is proving to be the big drag on funds. It makes up the biggest part of the world emerging markets index, but fund managers are unanimous that its stock market is going to stay in the doldrums for some time yet. With striking candour, Richard Firth, who runs Schroder's Seoul fund, is effectively telling investors not to buy his fund at the moment. </p> <p>\"When the country first opened up to foreign investors, people were saying 'Korea is the next Japan.' How right they were - but not in the way they intended.\" </p> <p>Mr Firth says Korea has yet to show that it is truly restructuring away from a debt-laden command economy. </p> <p>\"It was relatively simple for its military dictators to move into low level manufacturing such as steel and autos, designed to be export-led and repay foreign loans. Problems grew as the economy became more complicated and debts piled up, ultimately leading to the finan cial crisis of 1997. Today there is still too much debt, a reluctance to allow markets to work properly and a failure to recognise shareholders' needs.\" </p> <p>He points to a recent announcement from electronics giant Samsung. \"They talked about size and sales, but didn't once mention profits. This is not sustainable. The world economy is still globalising, and companies are dependent on foreign capital. If companies do not care about shareholders, then they are not going to get the capital. Basically, the stock market doesn't believe there has been fundamental change in Korea, and they don't know when it's going to happen.\" </p> <p>In Thailand and Indonesia, the structural problems are, if anything, even worse. True, economic growth has recov ered, although to levels below the boom years of the mid 1990s. But the lesson is not to be too impressed by economic growth figures; economic growth does not trans- late into stock market growth. </p> <p>At Gartmore, Philip Ehrmann, who manages \u00a3500m in emerging markets money, says: \"Thailand and Indonesia now account for under 2% of the emerging market index. We don't see evidence of structural reform or economic leadership. They may as well have a sign at Bankgok airport saying 'Don't bother to stop here'.\" </p> <p>But it's not all doom and gloom on emerging markets. Mr Ehrmann says: \"Some of the early promise is actually being delivered. It's becoming much clearer at the country level and the stock level who are the winners and who are the losers.\" </p> <p>Markets in Mexico and Brazil have recovered strongly since the 1997 crisis, and fund managers remain keen on the prospects for India and China. \"The places we find very good companies are in Hong Kong, Taiwan and India,\" says Austin Forey at Chase Fleming, one of the largest managers of emerging markets money. </p> <p>As the technology shakeout continues, investors may return to emerging markets, although interest levels are low. </p>",
  "<p>The housing market is on a knife-edge. After several months of gloom and falling prices, particularly in London, both the Halifax and Nationwide indices showed last week that prices had ticked up during the month. Nationwide even stuck its neck out with a bullish forecast of rising prices in 2001. </p> <p>Adding fuel to the argument that the market may have turned are figures this week from Bradford &amp; Bingley Estate Agents, which show that the number of buyers in the market far exceeds the number of sellers, particularly for higher-priced homes. </p> <p>Bradford &amp; Bingley says that if you have the right property which has been put on to the market at the right price, then you can still sell quickly. </p> <p>The most speedy transactions - with homes going in less than one week - have been taking place in Yarm and Stokesley in the north east and Bramhall in the West Midlands, while homes in Burgess Hill in West Sussex, Alton and Liss in Hampshire, Sidcup in Kent, Redditch in Worcestershire, Maldon in Essex and Ivybridge in Dartmoor have all sold within a fortnight. It shows that looking at the house market from a north/south perspective is becoming increasingly outdated. </p> <p>There have been large upswings in demand for houses in the north and Scotland which shows up on the Bradford &amp; Bingley survey under the \"ratio of buyers registering to properties available\". Back in January this was 4:1 in Scotland and 3:1 in the north, whereas now that has rocketed to 10:1 and 5:1 respectively. </p> <p>However, the south and south east remain the markets where properties sell most quickly - in contrast to reports that the market has slowed down. The average detached property in these areas is selling in eight weeks, with the average flat being snapped up in six weeks and bungalows taking seven to sell. This compares with a nationwide average of nine weeks. </p> <p>The average number of viewings before a sale is agreed ranges from five for a terraced property in Scotland to 16 for a detached house in the same region. </p> <p>Ian Davies, regional business director for B&amp;B estate agents in the south east, says: \"In the south if you have a property to sell in the majority of cases if you price it realistically you will find a buyer, although the market is more competitive.\" </p> <p>The percentage of the asking price eventually paid by a buyer is another good indication of market strength; any house can sell quickly if the owner is prepared to heavily mark down the price. But again the B&amp;B figures show that this is not happening. The national average for the percentage of the asking price compared to the price paid is 97%. This is slightly lower in the North (96%) and much higher in Scotland (105%), but the latter is due to differences in the system of house purchase north of the border, where it is quite usual to ask for \"offers in excess of\" a certain amount. </p> <p>So, how can buyers increase their chances of getting the property they want? Jim Jamison, chief operating officer at B&amp;B estate agents, says: \"Since our last report was issued, we have seen a growing trend towards tactical selling. </p> <p>\"When the market was at a peak earlier in the year, people were finding a property before putting their own on the market. Fortunately we are now seeing evidence of people selling their own property at the same time or even before looking to buy the home of their dreams. </p> <p>\"With good quality and realistically priced homes continuing selling quickly, our advice is to put your house on the market before you start looking to buy.\" </p> <p>Nationwide argues that buyers have time on their side - but not much. It is forecasting a relatively quiet market over the next few months and then an upward surge in prices next spring. </p> <p>\"An upward trend in house price inflation is likely to recur, although it may not be until next spring. By this time first-time buyers will be more confident that the housing market is running at a sustainable rate and this, combined with higher real take-home pay should lead to a resurgence in the market,\" says a spokesman. </p>",
  "<p>Halifax this week launched its biggest challenge yet to its high street banking rivals with the launch of a new range of aggressively priced credit cards and pledges on deposit and overdraft rates - all part of a big charm offensive to woo trade. </p> <p>On Tuesday it pledged to set a 100-strong \"crack switching team\" on the customers of Lloyds TSB, Barclays, HSBC and NatWest. Chief executive James Crosby said: \"The battle for customers starts today. The perception about inertia (among customers) is very strong. It will become a myth very quickly.\" </p> <p>To combat the switching inertia - whereby customers do not bother to move providers for a better rate because they think it will be too complex to transfer their direct debit arrangements - the bank says it will handle the direct debits itself. </p> <p>It also promised to pay 4% interest rate on deposits and charge only 10% on authorised overdrafts, beating the rest of the high street hands down - the other four all pay just 0.1% interest on deposits and both Lloyds and Barclays charge as much as 18.8% on overdrafts which have been previously agreed. </p> <p>On Wednesday came the next announcement. It unveiled a new range of credit cards with low introductory rates, particularly if you are transferring your business to Halifax from a rival. </p> <p>The Platinum card, which is aimed at customers with a household income of more than \u00a325,000 who need a credit limit in excess of \u00a33,500, has a rate of 2.9% for the first five months for balance transfers, rising to 16.9% at the end of that period. If you take out a card without transferring a balance the rate is 16.9% from day one. </p> <p>The Gold card rate is 3.9% for five months and then 16.9%, again for transferring balances. It is aimed at people whose household income is more than \u00a320,000. The credit limit on this card is \u00a33,000. </p> <p>The bank is also relaunching its Classic Visa card with an introductory rate of 3.9%, rising to 17.9%, both for transferring balances and new transactions. Halifax says the launches are part of its strategy to double its 1.5m base of credit card customers within the next three years. \"Customers taking out a Halifax Platinum card and transferring \u00a31,200 from their Barclaycard, for example, would save more than \u00a3100 in the first year,\" says James Corcoran, managing director of Halifax Card Services. </p> <p>However, although the introductory rates are rated the best on the high street, and the standard rates are among the lowest (the HSBC Gold and Platinum card are cheaper than their Halifax equivalents, for instance), there are better rates available from non-high street providers. Capital One charges 0% for six months, reverting to 12.9% and Egg charges 2.5% initially on debt transfers, which then reverts to 10.9% after six months. </p> <p>But Abbey National says that research it has conducted among 4,000 people shows that just 5% switch credit card provider in search of a better rate. It also showed that while 77% of people have considered moving to another card issuer, 42% say the process is too much hassle.</p>",
  "The South Korean president, Kim Dae-jung, won the Nobel Peace Prize today for his work towards peace and reconciliation with North Korea. <p>\"In the course of South Korea's decades of authoritarian rule, despite repeated threats on his life and long periods in exile, Kim Dae-jung gradually emerged as his country's leading spokesman for democracy,\" according to the Nobel citation.</p> <p>South and North Korea, foes on the battlefield a half-century ago, have warmed to each other more in the last few months than in more than a generation. Their armies remain locked in a standoff across a sealed border, but the mood on the peninsula is considerably lighter. </p> <p>After patiently pursuing contacts with North Korea during the first two years of his presidency, Kim held a groundbreaking summit in June with his northern counterpart, Kim Jong Il. The two countries then stopped propaganda broadcasts, held a reunion of separated families, opened border liaison offices and agreed to reconnect a cross-border railway. </p> <p>\"His visit to North Korea gave impetus to a process which has reduced tension between the two countries,\" the Norwegian Nobel Institute said. \"There may now be hope that the cold war will also come to an end in Korea.\"</p> <p>The announcement was a cliffhanger to the last minute as the speculation was more muted than usual. Last year's winner, the humanitarian group Doctors Without Borders, figured heavily in guesses ahead of the announcement. </p> <p>The five-member committee and its non-voting secretary Geir Lundestad stake their pride on keeping the secret. </p> <p>The Nobel committee never reveals the nominees, only their number, which this year was a record 150. But those making nominations for the 9m Swedish kronor prize (about \u00a3600,000) often announce them. The peace prize capped a week of Nobel announcements - the latest, the literature prize, was awarded Thursday to Chinese dissident writer Gao Xingjian, now a French citizen. </p> <p>Americans James J Heckman and Daniel L McFadden won the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics on Wednesday for developing theories on how people work and live, research that contributed greatly to employment training, public transportation, communication systems and other areas. </p> <p>The physics prize was shared by Americans Jack Kilby, who co-invented the integrated circuit at Texas Instruments in 1958, and Herbert Kroemer; and Russian Zhores Alferov. </p> <p>This year's chemistry prize went to Alan Heeger and Alan MacDiarmid of the United States and Hideki Shirakawa of Japan for their discoveries in the use of plastics to conduct electricity. </p> <p>The medicine prize recognised Swede Arvid Carlsson and US-based researchers Paul Greengard and Eric Kandel for discoveries about how messages are transmitted between brain cells, leading to treatments of Parkinson's disease and depression. </p> <p>The prizes are presented on December 10, the date the prize's founder, Swedish industrialist Alfred Nobel, died in 1896. The peace prize is the only one presented in Oslo. </p>",
  "<p>It was always a dot.com disaster waiting to happen. From the moment that online delivery service Urbanfetch unveiled international expansion plans four months ago, everyone said it wouldn't last. </p> <p>\"A great idea and a fantastic service for consumers, but it's just not going to sustain itself\" was always the general market opinion, so it came as no surprise whatsoever when Urbanfetch waved the white flag on its consumer operation last night. </p> <p>Signs posted on the company websites today declare \"It was a pleasure to serve you\" and \"It is with great regret that we will be closing our doors. We've enjoyed serving you, London.\" The firm is wrapping up by having a farewell sale and knocking off up to 50% on its products to clear its stock and close up shop in about a week's time. </p> <p>Why did Urbanfetch fail? Simple mathematics really. The company offered free delivery on all items that had practically no mark-up - the idea being to develop consumer demand, build market share and then fingers crossed, it would become a thriving operation. While the minimum order value is now said to be \u00a320, when the operation first launched in London customers found that they could order anything at any value, and it would be delivered. </p> <p>One punter recalls ordering a solitary packet of cheese crisps costing \u00a32.50 at the end of August, and others said they ordered tubs of Ben and Jerry's ice cream that came to little much more than \u00a35. Perhaps Urbanfetch's eagerness to please and bend over backwards to get customers on side was the main contributor to its downfall, particularly since the actual cost of providing a one-hour delivery service is around \u00a36 per order. </p> <p>The spotlight has now fallen on competitors in this field, namely Kozmo.com, which had been mooted as a potential merger partner for Urbanfetch until talks finally fell through earlier this week. As an example of what a loss-leader this type of service is, Kozmo.com revenues for the whole of 1999 were just $3.5m against losses of $26.4m. Having already cancelled its IPO earlier this year and laid off staff, Kozmo.com is now looking increasingly unsteady in the light of the Urbanfetch closure.</p> <p>Above, what the failure of Urbanfetch shows is that loss-leading business-to-consumer sites are not going to work. As the prolonged summer of dot.com discontent draws to a close and autumn/winter sets in, it is inevitable that more b2c businesses will fall by the wayside.</p> <p>In fact, less than a few hours after Urbanfetch announced its closure, seven-month old BagsOfTime.com, which has a similar business model, said it would stop taking orders at 5pm on Friday October 13. </p> <p> In an explanation on its website, BagsOfTime.com said it had \"failed to distinguish our same-day workplace delivery model clearly enough from others in the 'rapid delivery' market that require a significantly larger investment to concentrate on 60-minute delivery to individual consumers at home.\"</p> <p>The name Urbanfetch will remain and be morphed into Urbanfetch Express, a client-serving courier business operating solely in New York.</p>",
  "The invitation to Ariel Sharon to join a new coalition government is a reflection of grimmest reality: Israel is on the brink of war, and in wartime the country always has a government of national unity. <p>Sharon, 72, has no shortage of admirers on the Israeli right, who see him as a hero, and no shortage of detractors, who see him as a dangerous rogue. </p> <p>Palestinians generally have no such equivocation. They loathe the man. Arabs insist that it was Sharon's visit to the Haram al-Sharif mosque complex in Jerusalem on September 28 which sparked the latest bloodletting. </p> <p>But their passionate dislike of the Likud leader goes back much, much further. </p> <p>Nearly half a century ago, Sharon was winning a reputation in the Israeli army - and infamy among the Palestinians - as the young commander of Commando Unit 101, a shady outfit specialising in ruthless hit-and-run raids against suspected Palestinian guerrilla bases. </p> <p>He served at ever-higher ranks in the 1956 Sinai war against Egypt, and in the six-day war of 1967. He resigned from the army in 1972 to begin an extraordinary political career, in which he has sought advancement in parties of the right, left and centre. </p> <p>But on the main Israeli political issue, national security, Sharon has always been on the extreme right. In the late 1970s, when he at last gained ministerial office, he campaigned noisily for the occupied West Bank to be colonised by Jewish settlers, and promoted the strange concept, warmly embraced by the right that \"Jordan is Palestine\". We call it ethnic cleansing now. </p> <p>In 1981 Sharon got the job he always wanted: minister of defence. He supervised the preparations for the following year's Operation Peace for Galilee, the invasion of south Lebanon which was supposed to protect Israel's northern border. </p> <p>It was the start of a brutal little war, and an 18-year occupation. But the single act of brutality, still seared into the collective Arab memory, was the massacre of Palestinians in the Sabra and Shatilla refugee camps in Beirut, by the Christian Phalangist militia. </p> <p>The militia, seeking revenge for the assassination of their leader, president-elect Bashir Gemayel, were allowed into the camps by Israeli army units, ostensibly on the pretext that they were looking for armed guerrillas. Instead, they fired indiscriminately, killing hundreds. </p> <p>The Israeli left was outraged by the crime, which was apparently committed with their army's complicity. Sharon was only mildly criticised by the official inquiry, but was forced to resign. </p> <p>In and out of office, Sharon has built a formidable following among those Israelis who believe their country has to use all means to defend itself against the surrounding hordes. His inclusion in government might protect the prime minister, Ehud Barak, from the tide of rightist criticism which threatens to engulf him. </p> <p>But it will also bring new dangers to the crumbling peace process. Indeed, it is difficult to imagine any Arab leader who would be prepared to negotiate, let alone do a deal, with an administration including Sharon. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/israel/Story/0,2763,381501,00.html\">Timeline: how the region exploded</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/israel/graphic/0,5543,381943,00.html\">Steve Bell's view</a><br><a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/news/politics/1012goldenberg.ra\">Audio from Ramallah</a></p>",
  "In an American presidential election there is one number that matters more than any other. That number is 270, the total of electoral college votes that either Al Gore or George W Bush must amass in order to capture the White House on November 7. <p>At a time when all who are involved in this tight presidential election campaign are obsessed with national polls showing one or the other man ahead - often by tiny margins - it is worthwhile to remember that the presidency is decided not by the popular vote but by the electoral college. In theory - and even, on three past occasions, in practice - the winner in the popular vote does not necessarily become president.</p> <p>This hasn't happened for more than a century, but it is not an impossibility this November. Indeed this is precisely what the latest state-based polls are indicating. Bush may have a narrow lead in the national match-ups - this week's Pew poll put him ahead by the narrowest of margins, 45% to 44%, for example - but the accumulated picture from the states is different. Out there, it is Gore, not Bush, who is in the lead. And on election day, it's the states that each candidate wins that will determine the outcome.</p> <p>A brief reminder of how the electoral college works. Each state has votes equal to its members in the US House of Representatives and in the US Senate combined. Since a state's representation in the House is based on its population, while each state has two senators, populous California has the most electoral college votes with 54, while seven small states and the District of Columbia each have just three. There are 538 members of the electoral college, and therefore 270 electoral college votes are required to win the presidency.</p> <p>It has to be admitted that, at this stage, the composite picture from the states can only be put together by local polls taken on different dates and of differing levels of reliability. Nevertheless, the latest calculations suggest that Gore currently has 281 electoral college votes leaning his way, while Bush has only 249. One state, the normally Republican Arizona, is too close to call, but even if Arizona is added to the Bush total, it isn't enough to overtake Gore at present.</p> <p>Gore's states currently consist of California, Connecticut, Delaware, the District of Columbia, Hawaii, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Nevada, Hew Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington and Wisconsin.</p> <p>Bush's current list comprises the rest: Alabama, Alaska, Arizona (perhaps), Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Montana, Nebraska, New Mexico, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Virginia, West Virginia and Wyoming.</p> <p>The electoral map after November 7 will inevitably look different to the map as it appears today. Nevertheless, a few features stand out. Gore's strength is concentrated wholly in the four westernmost states, the mid-west and the north-east. Bush controls almost everything else to the west of the Missouri river, plus the South and a significant salient in the mid-west. Bush country covers more acres than Gore country, which is concentrated in the most densely populated states.</p> <p>If Gore wins on this basis in November, he will be the first presidential candidate not to carry his own state since George McGovern in 1972. But the similarity ends there for, whereas McGovern was obliterated, Gore would win the White House. The really striking thing about this match-up is that it would make Gore the first Democratic president in history to be elected without the support of a single Southern state.</p> <p>Talking to a Gore aide the other day, we compared notes on the battle for the individual states. His list for a narrow Gore win was rather different from the line-ups just discussed. It didn't include Oregon, Nevada, Iowa, Missouri or Maine. It did, however, include Tennessee and West Virginia. Even that list gives a pretty amazing picture of Gore's America. The only Southern state in the Democratic camp was Tennessee. It foresaw Republican victories in Missouri and Florida, two states where Gore has strong hopes of winning.</p> <p>But the most significant thing was the underlying and unspoken assumption. A Gore aide predicts his man will win by 274 to 264, losing some of the most important battleground states of the election. If that doesn't tell you that November 7 will be one of the closest elections in American history, then nothing will.</p>",
  "<p><strong> Erin Brockovich</strong><br> Rental and DVD (\u00a319.99)<br> Columbia Tristar Cert 15 <br> **** <br> </p> <p> A whole new Julia Roberts and unlike some previous whole new Julia Robertses (the dowdy maid in Mary Reilly, say), this is a makeover that works. Her version of the real-life Erin Brockovich is an angry woman on a mission - a stroppy, Wonderbraed, mini-skirted, twice-divorced mother of three. </p> <p>The hitherto omnipresent smile is entirely absent, the fluffy vulnerability gets nary a look-in. It's undeniably a star vehicle - Roberts is hardly ever offscreen - but it's one where the star is changed to fit the part, not the reverse. With careful direction from Steven Soderbergh, a good line in sassy dialogue from Susannah Grant's sparky script and enjoyable bluff support from Albert Finney, this is both a significant story and a thoroughly entertaining one to watch. </p> <p>It's a departure too for Soderbergh and for Aaron Eckhart, a loathsome misogynist in Neil LaBute's In the Company of Men, an impossibly sweet-natured biker boyfriend here. The villain is big business, this time PG&amp;E, whose shocking misbehaviour, with the dogged activities of Ms Brockovich, won a $333m award - big bucks before Anna Nicole Smith went to court. </p> <p><strong> Permanent Midnight</strong><br> Rental and DVD (\u00a319.99) <br> Columbia Tristar Cert 18 <br> *** <br> </p> <p> A trawl through the memoirs of a Hollywood junkie, told largely in flashback. It's superior straight-to-video material, enlivened by a highly believable performance by the versatile Ben Stiller. </p> <p>Anyone with even a tangential knowledge of a serious drug abuser will recognise the endless bouncing between Planet Earth and Planet Junk and the bullshit that goes with a world where the fix trumps everything else in life. Stiller's strung-out rant for a prospective TV puppet show (\"I see Mr Choppers as a modern-day Tom Joad\") is wonderfully funny and, like much else, rings true. </p> <p>Subsisting initially on a green-card marriage to Liz Hurley, Stiller's character becomes increasingly unhinged as the $5,000 a week scriptwriter with a $6,000 a week habit. In conclusion, Stiller is replaced by lookalike and real-life autobiographical writer Jerry Stahl, seen telling his story on confessional TV chat shows. Ann Widdecombe won't be renting it, but ultimately, this is a strongly anti-drug film.</p> <p><strong> In Too Deep</strong><br> rental <br> Metrodome Cert 18<br> ** <br> </p> <p> Once more unto the hood, and drugs are again at the root of a plot which sees undercover cop Omar Epps in dangerous pursuit of the local Cincinnati Mr Big known as \"God\" (LL Cool J). \"You've got to find a street character or invent one to hide behind,\" Epps is told by his police connection, Stanley Tucci. The plot is about how far you can immerse yourself in an invented personality without becoming it. It was done more inventively in Deep Cover, but it's played with conviction here.</p>",
  "Mexico is in the grip of a new chapter in the Salinas saga - a tale of power, corruption and family feuds, with characters Mexicans love to hate. <p>The latest installment began last week when the former president Carlos Salinas, visited his homeland from self-imposed exile in Dublin. He used the visit to break his silence on the outgoing president, Ernesto Zedillo, who replaced him in 1994 just weeks before the climax of an economic crisis in the country. </p> <p>Mr Salinas, a figure of hate in Mexico, is widely blamed for the crisis and the corruption in his administration - but his new memoirs claim all the fault lies with Mr Zedillo, whom he holds responsible for the recession and for guiding the Institutional Revolutionary party (the PRI) to defeat in elections in July this year after 71 years in power. </p> <p>Mr Salinas also accuses his successor of waging a vicious campaign against the Salinas family. But many believe his book is motivated by bitter ness against Mr Zedillo for the imprisonment of his brother. </p> <p>Raul Salinas is serving 27 years for murdering a leading PRI figure who had been married to a Salinas sister, Adriana. He is also under investigation on suspicion of stashing $90m (\u00a362m) abroad while his brother was in power. </p> <p>Carlos Salinas left Mexico at the weekend, but nobody believed the chapter was closed and, sure enough, the plot thickened on Tuesday when a taped argument between Raul and Adriana was broadcast on primetime news. </p> <p>The initially friendly conversation degenerated as they discussed a TV interview in which Carlos Salinas denied knowing about the $90m. </p> <p>\"It was cowardice of Carlos not to defend me,\" said the voice identified as Raul. \"It was the betrayal of a brother. I am going to tell everything ... when the moment comes.\" </p> <p>Raul has since said he has no complaints about his brother's handling of the case, but the tape is causing a furore. Mr Zedillo, the main suspect for leaking it, is saying nothing.</p>",
  "Two former leading figures in the Salvadoran military appeared in court in Florida this week accused of being responsible for the murders of three American nuns and a social worker in El Salvador 20 years ago. <p>The civil action is the latest attempt to bring to book US-based members of the Latin American military responsible for atrocities in Central and South America. </p> <p>Jose Guillermo Garcia and Carlos Eugenio Vides Casanova are accused of having ultimate responsibility for the murders of the four women in 1980. At the time, the two men held the positions of Salvadoran defence minister and director-general of the Salvadoran national guard, respectively. Both claim they did not give orders to have the women killed. </p> <p>The women were stopped at a roadblock, abducted, raped and executed; their bullet-ridden bodies were found later. </p> <p>After an international outcry, five soldiers were charged with the killings and jailed for 30 years in 1984. Some of them have since claimed they were acting under orders and that they had been told by a superior they could carry out the killings with impunity. </p> <p>The women, Sister Maura Clarke, 51, Sister Ita Ford, 40, Sister Dorothy Kazel, 42, and social worker, Jean Donovan, 32, had been helping at a refugee centre. At the time, the military regarded sections of the church with deep hostility because religious leaders drew attention to the atrocities being carried out against civilians. </p> <p>In an opening statement for the families on Wednesday, lawyer Bob Montgomery said the military had targeted the women because they were sympathetic to the peasants. </p> <p>Bill Ford, the brother of Ita Ford and a New York lawyer, said he was convinced that the soldiers did not carry out the killings on their own initiative. </p> <p>\"There were clearly higher orders,\" he said.</p>",
  "<p>Ford yesterday moved to head off a threatened strike at its main Dagenham car plant by announcing a new diesel engine facility and around 300 more jobs at the Essex factory. </p> <p>Its surprise initiative came at a meeting with union leaders who had called a series of mass meetings and a strike ballot over the US group's plans to end car production at Dagenham in early 2002. </p> <p>It led some union sources to argue that the planned mass meetings and strike ballot had been put on ice, with talks with the company due to reconvene on November 2. \"There's no way a strike can take place on the basis of this new company offer,\" they said. </p> <p>The suorces said up to 150 more staff had applied for voluntary redundancy than the 1900 initially sought by the company, which is offering a minimum severance of \u00a320,000 and up to \u00a360,000 to leave. </p> <p>But Tony Woodley, chief union negotiator, denied that the strike plans had been put on ice. \"Far from it. The only thing that will make us cancel our plans is if our members say they are happy with Ford's measures and I don't think that will happen.\" </p> <p>He added: \"Yes, there were about 120 more volunteers this year when the first 1,500 left. But the fact remains that, with the 1,300 redundancies the company is now seeking, around 3,000 will have left the site within two years.\" </p> <p>Ford's shrewd move was effectively to split workers at the engine facility from other production staff by offering them work at a brand new, hi-tech, dust-free,\"clean room\" to be built by 2002. It will build 900,000 diesel engines a year by 2004 compared with the current 650,000. </p> <p>This and a series of other measures to relocate staff, Ford said, would reduce the planned job losses from 1900 to 1300 and Dagenham would still employ more than 5,000 when the assembly-line closes.</p>",
  "Some people can identify a defining moment in their childhood - an incident that brings an idea to mind which is then indelibly fixed in the psyche. For Gelding - an adopted alias for the American internet guru to all wanna-be eunuchs - that moment came when he was 12 years old and thrown against an older boy in a packed bus. \"Do that again and I'll crush 'em,\" said the older boy, grabbing his genitals. The pain was as piercing as the pleasure. And so began a lifetime's quest to be castrated. <p>In the UK, self-motivated castration mainly exists only in the most extreme S&amp;M scene, while in America those aspiring to be castrated comprise a burgeoning and divergent tribe made up of both gay and straight men. Men who want to be castrated fit no stereotype, have no common neuroses or childhood experience. Some are androgynous types (thin and underdeveloped) who want to remain in a prepubescent, asexual phase, others are eroto-phobes who don't like to feel driven by their libidos and want to become surgically tranquillised. Some want to be feminised, a few - known as nullos or smoothies - want to become nullified by having their penis removed along with their testicles. </p> <p>In Gelding's experience a quarter of those who get castrated continue to regulate their libidos with testosterone, which allows them to have full sex. But what compulsion drives grown men to be castrated in the first place? According to Gelding, for most men the desire to be castrated stems from puberty but does not develop into a fixation for at least 10 years. </p> <p>This was certainly his experience. Now in his early 50s, he has been without his testicles for six years and is keen to point out that he has no desire to be feminised. Growing up in rural New York State, he knew he was gay from childhood, but it was only in his mid-20s, while working for the military in a top security position, that he discovered the gay S&amp;M scene and a world where castration was honoured rather than abhorred. </p> <p>One of his first boyfriends was a cutter - a man who worked in the netherworld of the gay S&amp;M scene, cutting off men's testicles, consensually and safely. By 1991 Gelding's testicles had become an unbearable affront to him. The idea of cutting aroused him sexually, but more than that, there was an aching need to be rid of something that had begun to take a stranglehold of his life. </p> <p>At first he tried to cut off the offending items himself by using rubber bands as a tourniquet and drenching his balls in ice water. But after an hour he ran out of adrenaline and went into clinical shock. In hospital a horrified A&amp;E surgeon castigated him for trying to remove healthy tissue. Three years later he went to a cutter in California and got rid of them safely and efficiently. \"I've never felt more myself, more complete or happy,\" he says, unemotionally. </p> <p>In order to receive the testosterone that he requires to keep him functioning as a man (he has occasional erectile problems but can still ejaculate) he has devised a cover story which makes him eligible for medical treatment. The story is posted up on the web and tells how he lost his balls against his will in a gay S&amp;M episode which went horribly wrong. \"My cover story also means that if someone finds out I'm castrated they view me as a victim, or a brave stalwart rather than a deviant or psychotic person,\" he explains. As well as resurrecting the libido, testosterone prevents osteoporosis and reduces the flab that castration causes to the hips and breasts. (On the down side, it also increases the risk of prostate cancer.) </p> <p>A self-confessed mother hen, Gelding has for four years been dispensing advice on his website to men who want, or think they want, to be castrated. In that time he's had 5,000 enquiries from both gay and straight men, all believing that their obsession is unique. Consultant psychiatrist Dr Russell Reid, of Hillingdon Hospital in west London, identifies castration fixation as \"highly disturbed behaviour, in mainly gay men, whose self-hatred is directed towards their genitals\". </p> <p>Gelding's response to this interpretation is equivocal. \"Yes, it's true that no normal person would do that, but then given that homosexuality has always been called a sickness, what's normal?\" Reid's experience of this tender topic is predominantly with transsexuals (some of whom even castrate themselves) as well as with men who are hypersexed. \"These men are led by their erect penises and some are driven to offend. Being castrated can be a huge release because they become pre-pubital, and sex is no longer an overwhelming preoccupation.\" </p> <p>He finds the origins of the fixation perplexing but speculates that it might be a case of the fear of castration turned on its head to become a uncontrollable craving. </p> <p>But eunuchs are nothing new. For 4,000 years they have represented some of the most marginalised and most honoured in society. In ancient India, eunuchs advised princes and guarded their harems, and the Biblical Daniel was a eunuch who rose to become prime minister of Babylon and later Persia. More recently there have been the Italian castrati of the 19th century - boys who sacrificed their manhood for the sake of singing careers in the opera houses of Europe. Today there are the cross-dressing Hijras in India and religious extremists such as members of the Russian Skoptsy sect who see the testicles as an organ of weakness. The medical profession understands this \"syndrome\" only in relation to transgender reassignment surgery or as part of body dysmorphia (a syndrome in which people become fixated with having a limb amputated). But Gelding disregards the connection with the body modification scene, believing the desire to be castrated is far more complex. </p> <p>Nor can he relate to the transgendered, \"some of whom get castrated just to get on to a gender reassignment programme\". He is also reluctant to help those whose desire to be castrated hinges on the ritual of cutting: \"Because if that's the overriding issue then most of these people are into fantasy and role play and don't have a true fixation.\" When castration is a true fixation, Gelding believes it is vital that surgeons treat the problem in a much more educated fashion. \"There isn't a doctor in the world informed in this area, because nothing will justify to a physician the removal of healthy tissue.\" </p> <p> There are several doctors in the US who will surgically remove testicles, but seldom before getting their patients to sign a consent form saying it is for gender reassignment. Dr Felix Spector, who advertises castration on his business card, has become something of a celebrity in the murky world of eunochdom, having performed his first castration in 1957. But the vast majority are amateur cutters, subject to prosecution for practising medicine without a licence, and desperately sought after on the net by men in urgent need. </p> <p>Although these cutters offer a necessary service (reducing the instance of self-castration), for the most part they too find the act of cutting erotic. Talking about doing a DIY castration, one cutter described the \"lovely crunching sound\" a Burdizzo (a castration device) makes \"like biting into fresh celery\". Burdizzos, elastators and other animal castration devices can all be purchased on the net. The internet has become a sanctuary to these would-be eunuchs. There are numerous websites providing information, and chat lines link men from all over the world who share this compulsion. </p> <p>When Gelding was delivering himself into the hands of the cutter there were no such support services and perhaps that's why it wasn't until he was in his 40s that he finally did what he had always wanted to do. Since then, he says, he has found some kind of inner peace, but at a price. He would have preferred to have been one of those who rationalised their way out of it, something he encourages all his correspondents to do. He considers those who manage it to be the lucky ones. </p> <p>The others must join him among one of the most disenfranchised of groups. Men who are ridiculed, despised and misunderstood by a society which will never be able to make any sense of why they feel incomplete with their testicles and yet complete without them. </p> <p>\u0095 Hidden Love: Modern Day Eunuchs is on Channel 4 next Tuesday at 10pm</p>",
  "It was as the artist for the Eagle comic's Adventures Of PC 49 in the 1950s that John Worsley, who has died aged 81, really reached an audience. From his first episode, published in August 1951, he drew the tales of 49 - Archibald Berkeley-Willoughby - until March 1957. Some 290 episodes, involving more than 3,000 drawings, appeared in Eagle comic alone, with further tales in the Eagle Annual and various spin-off books. Three-quarters of a million schoolboys relished every brushstroke each week. <p>Worsley also worked for the Eagle's companion paper, Girl, drawing Belle Of The Ballet, and, beyond that, turned his talent to an extraordinary range of work. </p> <p>This included Albert RN, the dummy sailor at the centre of a daring wartime escape plan from Marlag O prisoner-of-war camp, near Bremen. Worsley, himself a sailor PoW at the camp, created the life-sized figure out of wire and papier-mache, after which it was held between two soldiers during roll call, fooling the camp guards into thinking they had a full complement of prisoners while a British escaper made his getaway. </p> <p>For four days, Albert, with his ping-pong ball eyes and no hands (his sleeves were stuffed into his jacket pockets), stayed on parade; unfortunately, the escaper was recaptured on the northern coast of Germany. Two months later, Albert was finally rumbled when a second escape attempt was foiled, and the camp guards realised they had one too many prisoners. </p> <p>Back in England, Guy Morgan, a former fellow PoW, immortalised Albert RN in a play, which, in 1953, became a film starring Anthony Steel as a fictionalised version of Worsley. The artist himself recreated Albert for the movie, and the dummy is now kept at the Royal Naval Museum, Portsmouth. </p> <p>Born in Liverpool, Worsley was the son of a naval officer who settled on the family coffee farm at Kabuka, north of the Kenyan capital, Nairobi. It was here, amid spectacular scenery and at an altitude of 6000ft, that Worsley grew up, shooting and messing around in the family model-T Ford when not attending school. </p> <p>This idyllic life ended in 1928, as coffee prices collapsed. John was sent to St Winifred's boarding school, his fees subsidised by the Royal Navy Trust. He won a scholarship to Brighton College, and spent three years at Goldsmiths College school of art. In his final year, he purchased a second-hand Fiat for \u00a34, and, after leaving college, travelled the south coast, making sketches to sell to magazines. </p> <p>Worsley's naval experiences began in 1939, with a three-week crash course in seamanship. His ability to accurately report through his work helped him to become the youngest official war artist in the Mediterranean. He had already survived the sinking of HMS Laurentic, by a German U-boat in 1940, and now found himself taking part in the landings at Sicily, Reggio and Salermo. </p> <p>In 1943, he was among the rescue party sent to establish a base on Lussin Piccola, in the north Adriatic, only to find it overrun by Germans. Worsley was taken to Germany for interrogation, and spent almost two months in solitary confinement before being sent to Marlag O. It was there that he met the journalist Guy Morgan, who was about to be repatriated with serious war wounds, and who smuggled out a number of Worsley's drawings in the plaster cast on his arm. Then came the Albert RN escapade. </p> <p>As allied troops advanced in early 1945, Worsley and other PoWs were forced to march the 80 miles to L\u00fcbeck, arriving a few days before the war ended. Returning to Britain, he settled in a small studio in Barons Court, west London. He was asked by the Admiralty to paint portraits of high ranking officers, and found illustration work on the Eagle soon after its launch, painting a full-page advertising/ adventure strip for Walls ice cream, starring Tommy Walls, a lad whose heroics were always accomplished by the Lucky Walls Sign, and whose reward was, inevitably, lashings of ice cream. PC49 followed. </p> <p>In later years, Worsley produced for Esso a series of paintings showing life on oilfields in Iraq and America. He made hundreds of colour illustrations for television readings of children's stories; many of them later found their way into books. Even in his late 70s, he could still be found busy, always working on a marine painting, sculpture or glass engraving. </p> <p> H e was a gracious guest of honour at dinners organised by PC49 fans, and impressed a new generation with his collection of wartime sketches, John Worsley's War. Many of his paintings and portraits - including those of Montgomery and Admiral Sir John Cunningham - can be seen at the Imperial War Museum and the National Maritime Museum. He also worked as a police sketch artist, his facility for capturing a likeness being responsible for many arrests. </p> <p>A recent article about his work by one of his enthusiasts was entitled The Complete Artist; nobody earned that title more than John Worsley. </p> <p> John Godfrey Bernard Worsley, artist, born February 16 1919; died October 3 2000</p>",
  "A former lieutenant colonel in the Rwandan army, living in Britain as a temporary refugee, is to be extradited to face charges of genocide before the United Nations international criminal tribunal for Rwanda. <p>Tharcisse Muvunyi, held on remand in Belmarsh prison since his arrest in February, is alleged to have carried out the murders of more than 100,000 Tutsis during the 1994 massacres in Rwanda. </p> <p>In the high court yesterday his lawyers withdrew an application for habeus corpus after assurances from the home secretary, Jack Straw, and the registrar for the tribunal, which sits in Tanzania. </p> <p>They agreed that if Mr Muvunyi is acquitted or discharged he will be escorted to the airport and flown to Britain, where his refugee status will be reviewed. But Mr Straw made it clear that he reserved the right to revoke Mr Muvunyi's present status of being allowed to remain in Britain until 2002 and to retain his discretion on any new application for refugee status. </p> <p>Mr Muvunyi will fly to Tanzania in the next few days. </p> <p>Mike Fisher, his solicitor, said: \"My client is confident that he will be able to successfully defend himself against the charges. He feared that even if he was acquitted his life would be in danger.\" </p> <p>Mr Muvunyi, 46, came to Britain in 1998 with his wife and three children and settled in Lewisham, south London. But it was not until his presence was exposed in the media and an international warrant for his arrest was issued by the tribunal that he was detained. </p> <p>Mr Muvunyi was in charge of operations for the Rwandese armed forces in Butare and Gikongoro in April and May 1994 when the Hutu militias, backed by the police, started to slaughter Tutsis. </p> <p>Among the allegations against him is that he directed the murder of 65,000 people in a Runyinya commune on a single day, April 21. </p> <p>African Rights, a London-based human rights group, claims that there are more than 100 people, including soldiers and local government officials, who are ready to testify. </p> <p>A spokesman for Amnesty International said yesterday: \"The UK government should be congratulated for its cooperation with the tribunal. A speedy transfer of Mr Muvunyi offers the chance to investigate thoroughly some obscene crimes.\"</p>"
