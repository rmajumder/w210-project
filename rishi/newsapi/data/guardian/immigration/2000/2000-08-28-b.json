  "<p>Film festivals like to think of themselves as crucibles of fresh talents, and Edinburgh is no exception. Everyone is on the lookout for the undiscovered gem, the nascent genius - and so, in essence, is the Guardian New Director's Award. The award's basic purpose is to \"acknowledge new interpretation and innovation in film-making\", and the Edinburgh film festival can be a happy hunting ground for directors yet to secure a high profile. </p> <p>Last year's winner - the first - was Lynne Ramsay for Ratcatcher, which went on to receive widespread critical acclaim. This year, some 40 films at the festival were eligible - demonstrating the profusion of talent at the first-rung level of the global industry. </p> <p>There were important considerations: should the award go to an ambitious film imperfectly realised, or to a more successful effort that did not aim so high? Would it be better to give it to a film-maker who struggled to make their rough product, or to a well-funded, more polished effort? Was it our place to try to help a film into distribution, or to acknowledge someone more known who had already secured either prizes or distribution deals? </p> <p>The nine films that reached the final shortlist all posed questions on these themes. <strong>Krampack</strong>, a Spanish film about a gay teenager, was a sweet, affecting story, but hardly pushed the envelope except in its thematic content. <strong>The King Is Alive</strong>, the fifth \"Dogme\" film, looked fantastic and had a simple, effective narrative - a group of bus passengers are stranded in the African desert, and perform King Lear while they wait for rescue - but, for me, failed to explore fully the group dynamics it set up. <strong>The Low Down</strong>, a highly-rated member of the British contingent, was unusual in that it accumulated a succession of apparently inconsequential moments to tell the story of a London-Irish lad and a failed relationship; but its basic material remained uninspiring. </p> <p>These films lacked the cutting edge, the ambition of a potentially brilliant director. <strong>Chopper</strong>, an Australian film about a notorious real-life criminal, was a brilliantly brutal comedy, but also morally dubious. <strong>Human Resources</strong>, a moving French story of an ambitious son who becomes a trainee executive at a corporation where his father works on the factory floor, bespoke similarly impressive talent from director Laurent Cantet. It let itself down, however, with an improbable political conversion in the third act. </p> <p>We reached the meat of the situation with four films that were hugely impressive but impossible to compare. <strong>Crane World</strong>, an Argentinian film about a washed-up 50-year-old trying to find a job, balanced its miserable subject matter with an admirably light narrative progression. <strong>A Time for Drunken Horses</strong> won respect for its unblinking view of the snowy border country between Iran and Iraq, and the hardships of children who scratch a precarious existence there. And <strong>George Washington</strong>, a genuinely original American independent, told a story of good-hearted kids in a Southern town that mixed flashes of off-the-wall humour with stricken violence. These three films, it was felt, deserved to carry something away from Edinburgh, and so they were awarded a Special Mention each. </p> <p>All they lacked was that sense of ambition, of talent struggling to emerge from constriction, that was present in our winner. Right from the first moments of Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu's <strong>Amores Perros</strong>, as cars hurtle around the streets of Mexico City, you know you're watching someone special. Amores Perros is not perfect - it owes debts to Reservoir Dogs, and suffers from abrupt structural jumps - but its scope and excitement indicate Inarritu's promise. It is also likely to run into censorship problems in the UK because of its extended dog-fight scenes. But of all these directors, it was Inarritu's next film we most wanted to see - and that is why he is the winner.</p>",
  "Cruising past the boulevards, mansions, designer shops, fancy cars and roundabouts with landscaped geraniums, it is difficult to believe that Getxo is a heartland of ETA, Spain's supposed mirror image of the Provisional IRA. <p>Banners calling for prisoner-releases flap from railings, but the scrubbed streets, smooth lawns and double garages are things you do not see on west Belfast's Falls Road. In this south Bilbao suburb they are bountiful.</p> <p>From here a new generation of Basque separatist is emerging to wreak havoc in a renewed campaign that has killed and injured dozens in recent weeks. </p> <p>Police say the bombers and gunmen tend to be young, university educated and, above all, middle class. Today's ETA terrorist is likely to earn more than the Guardia Civil officer he tries to kill, reckoned one analyst.</p> <p>This was a shock. During two years on a Belfast newspaper, I heard virtually the opposite. Republicans spoke of ETA members as colleagues, blood brothers even. Each group emerged from communities ready to defy a state they did not recognise. </p> <p>From their first attacks in the late 1960s, each hunkered down in the 1970s for a long war of attrition. Activists compared notes on strategy, weapons procurement and propaganda. Relationships deepened and more than one republican rolled up at the Felon's bar with a Basque girlfriend on his arm.</p> <p>It seemed natural. What differences of opinion existed, such as how to combine the ballot box with the armalite, seemed less important than the similarities.</p> <p>Like the IRA, there was a strong Catholic streak running through ETA. Unemployment and poverty were rife in the ghettos of Londonderry and Belfast just as they were in the farmsteads and dormitory towns squashed against the Pyrenees.</p> <p>There is little doubt that economic deprivation spawned alienation that contributed to and sustained IRA recruitment. In certain Catholic areas unemployment was above 80% and incomes less than half the UK average. </p> <p>That the Britons were not necessarily to blame did not matter. To be young and male was to have little to lose.</p> <p>True, there was a steady trickle from Northern Ireland's burgeoning Catholic middle class; but the IRA's membership and ethos remained overwhelmingly working class.</p> <p>But at some point ETA evolved into a different creature. As the region's economy took off, the sons and daughters of farmers and factory workers were replaced by the offspring of professional classes with incomes way above the Spanish average.</p> <p>Money did not slosh through all the strongholds and pockets of poverty do remain, especially near the French border. But those behind last November's collapse of a 14-month ceasefire hail from the likes of Getxo, police believe.</p> <p>Of two former and possibly current ETA men I spoke to, one trained to be a journalist, the other worked in an architect's office. </p> <p>Whatever grievances they have against the state, deprivation is not one of them. I never met their like in west Belfast.</p> <p>Stroll down Getxo's high street and it does not take long to spot the irony. Every bank is blackened from firebombs. An especially posh clump of houses was blown up last month. Middle class and gainfully employed they may be, but Eta members do not like the symbols of capitalism.</p>"
