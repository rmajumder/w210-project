  "Israeli prime minister Ehud Barak's plans for a unity coalition faltered today, as talks with the leader of the hawkish opposition, Ariel Sharon, on the terms for joining his tottering government broke down. <p>Further talks are expected, according to an official of the opposition Likud party. </p> <p>\"The paper (Barak presented) was unacceptable, but we are going to hold another meeting in 30 hours,\" Silvan Shalom announced, as clashes continued in the crisis-riven area.</p> <p>Mr Shalom said that Likud wanted Mr Barak's agreement to give it \"real influence\" in the \"diplomatic process\" - which is understood to mean having substantial involvement in any future peace dealings with the Palestinians.</p> <p>If talks are successful and a coalition is formed, it could freeze Middle East peace negotiations for many months. </p> <p>The start of the formal coalition contacts came a day after the prime minister announced that Israel was taking \"time out\" from peace talks, to the chagrin of US President Bill Clinton and dovish members of Mr Barak's centre-left government. </p> <p>Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat riposted by saying Barak could \"go to hell\". </p> <p>In the West Bank town of Nablus, two Palestinian teenagers, aged 15 and 17, died today after being shot in the head during earlier clashes with Israeli troops. The deaths brought to 123 the number of people killed in 26 days of fighting. All but eight of those killed have been Arabs. </p> <p>Israeli troops and Palestinian militants traded gunfire in the main street of Hebron, an almost daily event. Palestinian stone throwers also clashed with Israeli soldiers at two trouble spots in the Gaza strip, with 36 Palestinians wounded overall, according to hospital doctors. </p> <p>In the West Bank town of Bethlehem, protesters spray-painted a donkey to resemble the Israeli flag, and tied up the animal in the street where rock throwers and soldiers clashed. The protesters also painted the names of Mr Barak and Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak on the donkey. </p> <p>With no letup in the confrontations, the Israelis clamped down on several Palestinian areas. </p> <p>The Israelis again closed the Palestinian airport in Gaza City, further restricting Palestinian travel. \"We consider this as another step in the hard siege on the Palestinian people,\" said Salman Abu Halib, general director of Palestinian Airlines. </p> <p>Separately, the Israeli army imposed a blockade on Beit Jalla, a Palestinian town from which Palestinian gunmen have been shooting at the Jewish district of Gilo on the southern outskirts of Jerusalem. </p> <p>Last night, Israel responded to the shooting with missiles and tank-mounted machine-gun fire. Beit Jalla and nearby Bethlehem were plunged in darkness, a Beit Jalla factory was destroyed and several homes damaged. </p> <p>One rocket hit a children's bedroom in the home of the Nazal family in Beit Jalla. Sohana Nazal said moments earlier she had moved her children, George, 3, and Ghada, 2, from the room because it faces Israeli tanks on a nearby hill. </p> <p>\"We heard a loud crash. We thought it [the rocket] had landed on the street. Only when we opened the door to their room and saw all the smoke did we realise what had happened,\" Mrs Nazal said. </p> <p>Hundreds of civilians have fled Beit Jalla and the nearby Aida refugee camp. </p> <p>The Israeli army chief of staff, Lt Gen Shaul Mofaz, said life for the residents of Beit Jalla could only return to normal if the shooting from the Palestinian side stopped. \"If they make it impossible to conduct a normal life on the Israeli side, I do not think we can tolerate such a situation,\" Mr Mofaz told Israel radio. </p> <p>Mr Barak today launched formal talks to broaden his coalition, which at present controls only 30 seats in the 120-member legislature. Parliament returns from summer recess on Sunday. If Mr Barak fails to bring opposition leader Ariel Sharon and his Likud party into the government, early elections appear inevitable. </p> <p>Mr Barak and his negotiators were to meet separately today with Mr Sharon as well as representatives from the ultra-Orthodox Shas party and the dovish Meretz factions, both former coalition members. </p> <p>Mr Sharon has said he would not join the government unless Mr Barak distanced himself from concessions he offered the Palestinians during the Middle East summit at Camp David in the US in July. </p> <p>At the time, Mr Barak was ready to give the Palestinians more than 90% of the West Bank, as well as control over parts of traditionally Arab east Jerusalem. </p> <p>Critics said Mr Sharon's presence in the government would dim hopes for peace. </p> <p>\"I think a national unity government...would make the prospect of peace more distant and undermine the belief in the world that we really do want to make peace,\" said Justice Minister Yossi Beilin of Mr Barak's One Israel alignment. </p> <p>\"If Sharon has the right to veto peace negotiations, I will not be able to sit in it [the government],\" said Mr Beilin, a key player in previous interim accords. </p>",
  "<p>In a world in which more and more cars look like they have been designed by someone taking a hairdryer to a block of soft cheese, the Beetle is a breath of fresh air. Among the bizarre mobile closets, family spaceships and executive aircraft on the road, it will invariably raise a smile of recognition. It's a smile that seems to be beamed back at you by the design, a simple collection of arcs and circles, bug eyes and a snub nose. </p> <p>No wonder Hitler called it his \"Strength-Through-Joy Car\". His dream was that every member of his \"workforce\" should have a car - a Volksauto. The idea was quietly written off as absurd when he insisted they must be sold for under 1,000 Reichmarks (\u00a385) but one engineer - a certain Dr Ferdinand Porsche - took up the challenge, partly because it coincided with his own ideas for an economy car. Workers paid for the car with a stamp system, accruing tokens that could eventually be swapped for a vehicle. </p> <p>Production was temporarily halted by the second world war but by 1955 no fewer than a million Beetles had scuttled off the assembly line. German production of the original Beetle ended in 1978, but it is still manufactured in Mexico. So when VW radically updated the design a couple of years ago, giving those charming Herbie looks a no less charming turn-of-the-millennium makeover, it was religiously referred to as the New Beetle. The new addition to the range has a 1.6 engine instead of the 2-litre GTi, and does away with the alloy wheels and the air conditioning. More importantly, it costs \u00a32,000 less. </p> <p>The New Beetle has remained faithful to the vehicle's shape. It looks a little like an Audi TT that has been driven through a hall of mirrors, giving it a more dome-like roof without sacrificing that chunky, wide stance on the road, with arches that create the effect of oversized wheels. The two arcs meet to form the back, which is elegant, simple and looks like it belongs. (Why is it that so many cars look like they've left the garage with the wrong backside?) </p> <p>But all of this is really a cosmetic memory of the original. Mechanically it is very different. The VW after-dinner joke about the woman who stops to help a fellow motorist, claiming she has a spare engine in the boot, is now gratifyingly extinct. Flip up the tailgate on the new one and you will discover that they kept everything so neat back there by assuming that you travel rather light. </p> <p>It's quite difficult to comprehend that as you go nipping along the road because the expanse between the steering wheel and the windscreen stretching out towards the horizon could quite happily accommodate a small wedding reception. It's one of the pay-offs of being design-led, like the limited back seats. But for the driver it gives a feeling of being right in the middle of an oval shell, which in turn makes the handling feel immediate. Beetling along with enough room above your head for a fairly extensive afro, you almost expect the vehicle to be ungainly around corners, and to lean forward during braking. But there is very little hangover - it handles like a buggy. And all that room between you and the engine, plus the safety-conscious heavy doors, means good soundproofing. The time lag before acceleration when you hit the floor in second or third is understandably longer with the smaller engine, but it still feels unexpectedly responsive for its unaggressive, soft shaping. </p> <p>Add the airbags, Conran-style handbrake, pretty displays, Electronic Stability Programme (which senses slipping and automatically corrects it by individually braking each wheel), sporty suspension, beverage whatnots and electrically heated this-that-and-the-other and you can see how far it has come from being a basic people's wagon. </p> <p>One other distinguishing feature of the original Beetle has also gone: the ludicrous farmyard farting that used to herald its arrival. That indestructible plodder of an engine, which didn't so much rev as snore, has been replaced by VW's hugely successful 2-litre from the Golf GTi, or, in the latest model, the new 1.6. </p> <p>And what's this? Just between the steering wheel and the dash there is a small plastic funnel. It won't hold a pen, a coffee, a map or a 20p. Maybe it's a valve to stick your lips round and blow up the airbags. The manual is having no jokes about this little homage to the car's hippy status in the Herbie films: \"No articles should be kept in the vase when the vehicle is in motion. This could be a potential danger during a sudden braking manoeuvre as the contents of the vase could fly out and distract the driver from what is happening on the road.\" Just imagine getting a face full of daffodils when you switch on the air conditioning. Tricky. </p> <p>But it's a little emblematic reminder that this is a car with character, and has managed to hang on to it while getting bang up to date. For some drivers, character is a bad word. Character equals frivolous. They want something that looks like a \"serious bit of kit\". But they can keep their motorised willies - this is much more fun. </p> <p><strong> The lowdown</strong><br> </p> <p> <strong> Volkswagen Beetle 1.6</strong> </p> <p> <strong> Price:</strong> \u00a312,995</p> <p> <strong>Acceleration:</strong> 0-62mph in 11.6 secs</p> <p> <strong>Top speed:</strong> 111mph</p> <p> <strong>Consumption:</strong> 36.7mpg (combined)</p> <p> <strong>At the wheel:</strong> Bod</p> <p> <strong>On the way to:</strong> Interflora</p> <p> <strong>On the stereo:</strong> Herbie Hancock</p>",
  "<p>Giuliano Amato's biggest mistake was to resemble a rodent. Possessing a toothy grin, protuberant ears and slender frame, he is called Topolino, Italy's version of Mickey Mouse. Rivals cannot touch him for intellectual or strategic finesse but he is soon to lose his job. A prime minister is no longer allowed to look like a mouse, no matter how mighty. </p> <p>Welcome to Italy's election campaign, where the path to power is via permanent tans, Hollywood smiles and glossy hair. Keep your eyes peeled for policies, they don't show up so brightly on television. Victory belongs to whichever side masters image, for this is a campaign fought almost exclusively through the media. Never have soundbites, photo opportunities and spin mattered so much. </p> <p>Silvio Berlusconi, the conservative opposition leader and media magnate, is firing up his newspapers and television stations for a US presidential-style campaign. Opinion polls put him on course for a spectacular come-back, seven years after he tumbled from the premiership in disgrace. </p> <p>The centre-left government, shaky after four troubled years in power, reckoned its best chance was to chew up its third leader and come up with one even silkier than Berlusconi. The signal for Amato, 61, to walk the plank. He will step down before the election, a decision he announced on a chat show, Porta a Porta. </p> <p>Enter Francesco Rutelli, 46, the mayor of Rome and arguably Italy's best-looking politician. A clean cut, relaxed style has invited comparisons to Tony Blair. Others call him Cicciobello, after a plastic doll. He is not well known and his policies, if he has any, remain a mystery. But that will change from today when he launches his campaign in Milan. Few are better at kissing babies, shaking hands or working crowds. </p> <p>The veteran commentator Indro Montanelli despaired that Italy was choosing leaders based on looks. The newspaper La Repubblica was kinder. \"Rutelli is the novelty, the generational turn, the spirit of competition, the challenge on Berlusconi's grounds of modernisation, newness and image.\" Either way, the scene is set for a campaign which is likely to turn dirty. </p> <p>Too much is at stake, and too many voters floating, to be otherwise. The election is not due until April 2001 but the battle is already turning hot. Rutelli has enlisted Stan Greenberg, the American campaign guru who advised Bill Clinton, Tony Blair and Gerhard Schr\u00f6der and was the alleged mastermind of Al Gore's uxorious kiss at the Democratic convention. \"We will have a few surprises for Mr Berlusconi,\" smiled the mayor. </p> <p>The Queen became a pawn last week. After being greeted by Rutelli in Rome it was vital to the opposition for their man to get a chance to bask in regal glory, which he did in Milan. The jostling for front row seats in St Peter's square will be intense next month when Pope John Paul II proclaims Sir Thomas More the patron saint of politicians. Recent photo opportunities have shown both candidates replicating famous Benito Mussolini images of harvesting crops and embracing children. Commentators are divided over whether the echoes were intentional. </p> <p>Berlusconi, 64, who has a tight rein on his coalition, has successfully presented the myriad corruption allegations against him as judicial witch-hunts. He launched his campaign this month with a billboard blitz which has papered Italy blue. \"More pensions for everybody,\" says the caption, beneath a tanned, beaming visage which appears to be from 15 years ago. \"More hair for everybody,\" sniggers the government. </p> <p>Estimated to be worth $13bn, the owner of AC Milan football club returned from his Bermuda holiday home with 25 \"recipes\" for a better future involving jobs, tax breaks and crackdowns on illegal immigration. Cheered on by his three TV stations and publishing empire, he has brushed aside criticisms that such power will present conflict of interest issues if he is elected. The man who brought soap operas and show girls to Italian TV always appears sunny. He stops smiling only when denouncing his opponents as \"child-eating communists\". </p> <p> Family and yacht complete the image. His 34-year-old daughter Marina, vice-president of his holding company Fininvest, posed in a black bikini for the lifestyle magazine Oggi while the accompanying text praised her physique and brains. Kristen Pazik, the girlfriend of Berlusconi's son Pier Silvio, 31, posed nude for an eight-page spread in Italy's GQ magazine. Her potential father-in-law was the most fascinating man in the world, she revealed. Flaunting wealth is a calculated gamble to appeal to Italian aspirations. </p> <p>The man the media call the Cavalier intends to replicate the tactics which won him last April's regional election. A 37,000-tonne cruiser ship, renamed the Ship of Freedom, was backed up with a fleet of planes and vehicles. Berlusconi instructed canvassers to carry sweets to ward off bad breath, a handkerchief to dry their hands and to always clean public lavatories after use in case voters thought they had dirtied them. \"Make sincere compliments to people. Tell the ladies, 'what a lovely smile, what elegance'.\" </p> <p>He is competing with Rutelli for floating centrist Catholics. \"Anti-communism is a moral duty,\" he has repeatedly said. \"We have two candidates fighting a presidential-style campaign, just like Blair and Hague, but without a cohesive two-party system behind them. They do not have fully developed manifestos on which people can judge them, so image becomes more important,\" says James Walston, of the American University of Rome. </p> <p>Flashes of dirty tricks are a taste of what is likely to come, says Prof Walston. Branded an abortionist and derided by Berlusconi allies for adopting an Ecuadorean child, Rutelli has reminded voters that the Cavalier has been married twice. Oblique references to sexuality have been made. </p> <p>Today's press conference in Milan, his opponent's heartland, is a typically bold move but Rutelli has a mountain to climb. Fractious and unwieldy, the ruling coalition surprised itself by managing to agree on a new name: \"The Olive Tree Together for Italy\". Not quite as snazzy as Berlusconi's House of Liberty. But it's Rutelli's job to make up for that. He will spend the next few months traversing Italy in a bus trying to build momentum. Sitting in his office in Rome, he looks sad for a moment. \"We don't have a boat.\"</p>",
  "<p>\u0095 Early advertising for Kevin Costner's Cuban missile crisis film <a href=\" http://guardian.imdb.com/Title?0146309\">Thirteen Days</a> has been abandoned; it was decided that the campaign - which shows missiles raining down on America accompanied by the line \"You'll never know how close we came\" would be in poor taste, following last week's explosion which killed 17 on the navy destroyer USS Cole. New Line spokesman Joe Nimziki said, \"The ads were not exploitative or violent, but even the sight of a missile coming down on an American city wouldn't be right.\"</p> <p>\u0095 American ice-cream manufacturers Ben &amp; Jerry's are reported to have been angered about a new British film which shows their product being used as a sex aid. Chunky Monkey, named after the B&amp;J ice-cream flavour, calls itself a dark comedy, and focuses on a serial killer's attempts to get ready for a big date. The offending scene sees the frozen desert feature prominently during a sex act between the main characters. Whereas big-name ice-cream rival Haagen Dazs's famously sexy advertising campaigns might lead some to believe this is precisely the purpose for which their product is intended, Ben &amp; Jerry's products have made no attempt to associate themselves with the steamier side of life. Unilever, which bought Ben &amp; Jerry's earlier this year, has threatened the film-makers with legal action and is seeking an injunction to prevent the film from being shown unless all references to their product are removed. Producer Phil Hunt is opposing the move however, insisting that deletions would remove \"an integral part\" of the film.</p> <p>\u0095 The British Video Association and British Association of Record Dealers have announced new awards honouring the nation's favourite videos. <a href=\"http://www.ananova.com/entertainment/\">Ananova</a> reports that the video industry hopes the awards will become an annual event, with hundreds of thousands of viewers picking their favourites in categories such as best film, comedy or kid's movie. Voting forms are available at record and video shops and superstores, and a shortlist will be drawn up next month, with winners announced in January. There'll be no official ceremony, but organisers are hoping to establish one for the competition's second year.</p> <p>\u0095 Silence of the Lambs director <a href=\" http://guardian.imdb.com/Name?Demme,+Jonathan\">Jonathan Demme</a> is in negotiations to direct Intolerable Cruelty, and is apparently courting Hugh Grant, T\u00e9a Leoni and Geoffrey Wright to star. The film concerns a revenge-seeking gold-digger, who marries a womanising Beverly Hills lawyer with the intention of making a killing in a divorce. The script has been rewritten by Joel and Ethan Coen.</p>",
  "<p>\"Here's a tenner for your expenses and a ticket to Belfast,\" growled Eddie the news editor. The year was 1970. I was a trainee reporter on the Cambridge Evening News and about to set off on my first \"foreign\". </p> <p>\"Any advice, boss?\" I asked. </p> <p>\"Yes. Sharpen your pencil, take an extra notebook and make sure you've got some change for the 'phone. Now get out of here before I change my mind!\" It was sophisticated stuff in those days. </p> <p>Ten years on I was a television correspondent with BBC TV News, heading for South and Central America with Foreign Secretary Lord Carrington. Among my travelling companions was ITN correspondent Trevor Macdonald. </p> <p>In those days Trevor and I shot our rival reports on film and recorded voice tracks on tape. The film cans were bundled into a well marked 'onion bag' and dispatched on the next flight to London: there was a fair chance they would arrive in time to appear on the following evening's news. Exhausted correspondents and camera crews then retired to a nearby beach or bar to consider the next story. </p> <p>My crew and I were diverted to the Texas coast to cover Hurricane Allen. But before we could broadcast the amazing footage, we had to fly the length of the US to the BBC New York Bureau, the nearest place we could process and edit the film. </p> <p>By 1990 I was with ITN reporting on the Gulf War. Mobile satellite dishes were now starting to transform the world of the television journalist. \"Fly-away\" dishes weren't quite the fairy-winged technological marvels they sounded, as many a TV engineer with back problems will testify, but at least they were portable (just). With up-links in Baghdad and the Saudi Arabian city of Dhahran, we found ourselves \"going live\" more than ever before. News picture-gathering was also more immediate with the advent of video cameras. Now tapes could be edited without delay - or put straight to air. The television correspondent was under increasing pressure to go live at a moment's notice. </p> <p>As we moved over the border into Kuwait with the liberation forces, we had a sight of things to come. The first and only satellite link out of Kuwait City in those early hours was a cunning contrivance devised by a CBS camera crew. They had strapped and roped a dish on to an old flatbed truck and driven it across the desert from Saudi. Peter Sharp and I gratefully used it to broadcast the first live picture reports on ITN. What viewers didn't see was the CBS rag-and-bone-man's jalopy that was to fire the imagination of television engineers. </p> <p>Nearly a decade later I was to see the benefits first-hand. Now a Sky News correspondent, I was waiting on the Macedonian border as the first Nato troops rolled into Kosovo - a province cut off from the world's view for many months. Within 15 minutes I was broadcasting live from inside Kosovo. The Yugoslav forces had left only moments before; KLA soldiers emerged from the hills to claim the villages; Gurkha infantrymen patrolled the streets searching out booby-traps; and British tanks trundled noisily by. I found bloodstains barely dry, hastily discarded family photographs, the wreckage of homes and lives - all live. By now we were armed with custom-made satellite trucks. Sky News boss Nick Pollard, had sent out four. So, I and my fellow correspondents - Keith Graves, David Chater and Andrew Wilson - were able to report the progress of the Nato peace-keeping force live all the way to Pristina while, from another satellite dish in the Kosovan capital, Tim Marshall charted the Yugoslav retreat as we headed towards him. </p> <p>The speed, the flexibility and the immediacy of the coverage were at a level we had not been technically capable of producing before. </p> <p>If you're wondering what's next, I'm worryingly reminded of a spoof I taped a few years back to mark Pollard's departure as executive editor of News at Ten. I was wandering round South Africa looking like a techno one-man-band with a digicam on one shoulder, a microphone strapped to my chest, an edit pack in hand and a dustbin lid - loosely representing a mini-dish - taped to my back. \"The TV Correspondent of the Future\" was the title. It's frighteningly close to coming true. </p> <p>As the digital technology improves, so too does the TV news broadcaster's mobility and ability to reach the stories once deemed off the beaten track. On 24-hour rolling news channels live, breaking stories are the priority. Get there first, tell the story live, stay with the drama. </p> <p>Mobile satellite trucks have enabled us to do that in Britain. But as the technology brings compression and condensing, it may soon be possible, thanks to mini satellite dishes, minicams and mini-edit packs, for a two-person team - a correspondent and camera operator/editor/engineer - to operate from the remotest corners of the globe. </p> <p>The pros and cons of the broadcast news revolution? On the whole I think they are mainly pluses. On rolling news channels, a TV correspondent can tell his or her story as never before. The equipment allows them to go live from almost anywhere. They can move as and when the focus of the story shifts, updating it whenever there's something to add and turning round video pictures without delay. </p> <p>But the immediacy also puts today's correspondent under a range of new pressures. There's precious little time to stop, think and prepare. At last week's Hatfield rail crash, some of my colleagues admitted they were often wired up at a live position doing two-way reports with the studio hour after hour. This left them little time to go news and picture gathering. </p> <p>It's a familiar story across the industry. Field producers with each mobile team now play an important role as fact finders for on-air correspondents. Without good back-up there's always the danger of speaking out of necessity rather than from authority. </p> <p>What this means is that there's a greater premium than ever on good journalism - the simple, basic tools of the trade. The TV news craftsmen and women who shine today are those who can not only deliver crisp and lucid live reports, but also put breaking stories into context, painting in the background. The TV hack who gives it to you fast and fair will never go out of fashion. </p> <p>\u0095 Emmy Award winner Jeremy Thompson has been BBC television's North of England Correspondent; ITN's Chief Sports Correspondent, Asia Correspondent; Africa Correspondent and Sky's senior US Correspondent. He is now presenter of Sky's Live at Five and Sky's 9 O'clock News</p>",
  "<p>A lost screenplay by the late <a href=\"http://guardian.imdb.com/Name?Huston,+John\">John Huston</a> has been unearthed by the director's son, and is set finally to make it onto the big screen. </p> <p>Amparo, about a burned-out screenwriter, will be directed by the legendary film-maker's son, <a href=\"http://guardian.imdb.com/Name?Huston,+Danny\">Danny Huston</a>, who also has \"polished up\" the script. The project is about a screenwriter with writer's block, who heads for Mexico to get his creative juices flowing again. While there, he falls in love with a latina prostitute - Amparo. </p> <p>\"It was literally a discovery I made in one of his trunks,\" Huston told The Hollywood Reporter. \"I'm terribly excited to make it. It's got a lot of potential. If there was ever a man who could weave a good yarn, it was my father.\"</p> <p>One of the 20th century's greatest directors, John Huston's best known films include The Treasure of Sierra Madre (for which he received Best Director and Best Screenplay Oscars), The Asphalt Jungle, The African Queen and Prizzi's Honour.</p> <p>Huston said he is looking to cast an unknown actress in the title role, while seeking a more established star for the role of the writer. </p> <p>Amparo will be filmed in Manzanillo, a small town in central Mexico near the Pacific coast location of Puerto Vallarta, where John Huston had a home and filmed 1964's The Night of the Iguana.</p> <p>Huston, whose directing experience comes primarily from TV movies, admitted that his father's unfinished screenplay project will bring with it difficulties, but hopes that the old man will be there with him, somehow. </p> <p>\"There are some scenes he has written that will be very difficult to achieve, but hopefully I can look up to the stars and have [my father] give me an occasional helping hand,\" he said.</p>",
  "Last year Ted Owen put out a call through Stoke-on-Trent's local paper, the Sentinel, for people to come forward and stand for the council. At a social event attended by Martin Bell, the independent MP for Tatton, several interested hopefuls gathered from which nine candidates emerged. In May, when 20 of the council's 60 seats were up for grabs, they all stood and all won, taking eight seats from Labour and one from the Conservatives. The independents number 15, the second largest group in the council, with as many seats as the Tories and Liberal Democrats put together. <p>\"It was a kick against the system,\" says Owen, the leader of the independent group. Owen is a former Labour councillor who was deselected because \"he wouldn't toe the line\" and has stood and won as an independent ever since. He puts the victories down partly to a local revolt against the history of one-party rule in a city where Labour once held all the seats. \"It was a reaction against the old-boy network and everything that was going on behind closed doors. Not enough people knew what was going on. They wanted things opened up,\" he says. And he puts the victories down partly to a general disaffection with Labour. \"They were angry about the pensions in particular but also the general arrogance of them in parliament. Most, but by no means all, of our support comes from former Labour voters.\" </p> <p>But if the people of Stoke were kicking against the system, they were swimming with the tide. Their decision to turn their backs on the established parties en masse illustrates a growing divergence between the political class and the prevailing political culture which it is supposed to reflect. It is a dissonance characterised not so much by a clash between left and right - although it is informed by it - but between the margins and the mainstream, which finds its expression in various forms. In Birmingham, where the Justice For Kashmir party has five council seats, it is essentially ethnic. In Preston, where three independent councillors have joined the hard-left Socialist Alliance, it is ideological. If the rural areas continue to bust while the rest of the country booms, it could soon be geographic - a rural party standing against the perception of metropolitan domination of politics. </p> <p>It is not a trend confined to Britain. In Denmark, all the mainstream parties, unions and business representatives pushed for a Yes vote in the euro referendum. The people voted No. Nor is its progress uniform. In Switzerland, a recent referendum over whether to limit immigration united the political and economic establishment against the proposal. The people backed them. </p> <p>But it is gathering pace. In America more than a third of the electorate was too busy or uninterested to vote in 1996 - more than double the figure in 1980. It is little wonder when membership of the political class there is beginning to look hereditary. The Republican presidential candidate, George Bush, is running for the job his dad used to have while his Democrat counterpart, Al Gore, has already filled his father's shoes as a Tennessee senator. They are drawing from a gene puddle of leadership talent confined not to national politics but extending to civil rights, trade unions and municipal government. Martin Luther King III (the head of the Southern Christian leadership conference), James Hoffa (the head of the Teamster union), and Richard Daley (the mayor of Chicago) occupy the same positions as their fathers a generation ago. If the low viewing figures for the presidential debates are anything to go by, the turnout for this year's election could be even lower. </p> <p>But this marginalisation does not stop at electoral politics. The uprisings in Seattle, Prague and Washington, the fuel protests and attacks on \"paedophiles\" in Portsmouth are all, in their own very different ways, examples of what happens when people are either unwilling or unable to access the levers of power to effect change that is both democratic and meaningful. </p> <p>This is not the product of some vast conspiracy but a confluence of factors which have over the past few decades gradually rendered mainstream politics irrelevant to many and remote to most. As larger parties have dumped their ideological baggage and started travelling light, there is often little apart from their rhetoric to distinguish them. </p> <p>Globalisation has further eroded distinctions by giving the invisible hand of the market - in the guise of the World Bank, IMF, multinational corporations and supranational bodies - carte blanche to pick up any democratically elected government by the scruff of the neck and slap it around if it attempts to put the needs of its electorate above the interests of international capital. With traditional electoral bases dwindling - women in call centres where men used to be in mines, rural communities full of commuting townies - the centre-left and right flounder for messages that reach beyond the shrinking faithful to the amorphous centre beyond. </p> <p>Into the vacuum has stepped a mixture of charismatic individuals, extremist organisations and unpredictable politics. In Stoke, the independent councillors selected themselves, with no ideological unity apart from the fact that they did not represent political parties. For all Owen knew, they could have been fascists or members of religious cults. He took them on a hunch. \"You take on board what you see,\" he says. \"But I admit that what you see is not always what you get.\" </p> <p>The trouble with this is that it could go anywhere. The main beneficiaries thus far have been the far-right. J\u00f6rg Haider's support in Austria is thanks in no small part to the cosy, corrupt collusion between the two principal mainstream parties that persisted mostly uninterrupted for almost half a century. Similarly, in Denmark it has been the far-right Danish People's party, which has gained most from the No vote. But the left has made notable inroads too. In London it was Ken Livingstone who took the capital with neither party machine nor personal wealth, but record, personality and profile. </p> <p>The reaction of the mainstream has so far been organisational rather than political. Rather than address the issues of internal democracy, political alienation or economic exclusion that have created the conditions for marginalisation they have simply closed ranks. It is an attitude best illustrated by the reaction of the Belgian premier, Guy Verhofstadt, to the strong showing of the far-right Vlaams Blok, which won a third of the votes in Antwerp city elections earlier this month. \"All the democratic parties have pledged not to form alliances with the Vlaams Blok. Due to the attitude of other parties it is doomed to disappear in the long run.\" </p> <p>Nothing could be further from the truth. It is because of their attitudes that the Vlaams Blok is flourishing. It is the politically complacent and ideologically vacuous mainstream that is creating the politically aggressive and ideologically chaotic margins that veer between the reactionary and the radical - at times striving to preserve the democracy that is left, at others committed to erasing it.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:gary.younge@theguardian.com\">gary.younge@theguardian.com</a></p> <p>Useful links: <br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/austria\">Special report: the Austrian far right in power</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/US_election_race/\">Special report: the US elections</a></p>",
  "More than 150 years after California was lost by Mexico to the United States, the state is to become a battleground again. But this time the bombardment will be conducted over the television airwaves as George W Bush digs into his war chest and claims that the greatest prize in the presidential race is within his grasp. <p>The Golden State is indeed the richest trophy in the battle for the White House. It brings the victor 54 electoral college votes out of the total of the 270 needed - as many as the three key states of Florida, Michigan and Wisconsin put together. </p> <p>At the last election, Bill Clinton carried California comfortably with 51% of the vote to Bob Dole's 38%, Ross Perot's 7% and Ralph Nader's 2%. </p> <p>Local polls have shown Mr Gore comfortably ahead but now the Bush team has announced that its private polls show the gap to be as small as 6% and they are to spend $1.5m (\u00a31m) a week on commercials in the final stretch of the campaign. The Texas governor will also be hitting the state to try to motivate the undecided. </p> <p>In addition, a national Bush campaign in Spanish will be seen as directed very much at California where 25% of the population of 31m is now Latino, traditionally regarded as Democratic supporters. </p> <p>\"The polls definitely reflect a shift from Gore and his lead is now only in single digits,\" said Lindsey Kozberg of the California Bush/Cheney 2000 campaign. \"We are finding that California voters are very much attracted to Governor Bush's educational programme and also to his reform of social security and Medicare and his policy on the defence industry.\" </p> <p>She said that the polls over the last week indicated a definite swing to Bush which now meant that a state that had been virtually written off as Democrat two months ago was now seen as worth courting, particularly as it last went Republican in 1988 for George Bush Sr. </p> <p>At the Democrats' California campaign offices, the mood is sanguine. \"We welcome their decision to waste money here in California,\" said spokesman Peter Ragone. </p> <p>\"The reason he will not win in California is that he is in the hip-holster of the National Rifle Association,\" he said. \"Our message to Bush is 'keep the mess in Texas not in California'.\" He added that Al Gore's record on the environment was one key factor in ensuring that the state would remain with the Democrats. </p> <p>Commentators doubt whether Mr Bush has a serious chance and see the push as strategic, aimed at keeping up the percentage of the Republican vote, aiding Republicans running for office in the Senate and Congress and having a psychological impact on the Gore campaign in that it creates an impression nationally that, if California is vulnerable, then Gore must be in real trouble. </p> <p>California is also one of the states where Mr Nader, the Green party candidate, would hope to do well but he is still hovering at around 5% in the polls as more and more left-leaning organisations and publications urge a Gore vote for fear of a Bush victory. </p> <p>Californians have good reasons for going to the polls that involve neither Mr Bush nor Mr Gore. Two propositions concerning drugs and schools have activated many voters and the spin-off may be a higher turnout than usual that may have national repercussions. </p> <p>Proposition 36 is a radical move that would mean that non-violent drug offenders who were neither selling nor manufacturing drugs would be given treatment and probation instead of prison. This is opposed by the prison guards' union who have found an unlikely ally in the normally liberal actor Martin Sheen, currently enjoying great success as the fictional president in the television series West Wing. </p> <p>Sheen, whose son had drug problems, argues that only the threat of prison works and has been appearing on commercials to call for a No vote. The other contentious proposition, 38, would introduce a school voucher system that would allow parents to take $4,000 (\u00a32,750) worth of vouchers to the private school of their choice, thus removing their child from the state system. </p> <p>What worries some candidates is the sheer number of votes people are asked to cast with 32 different choices for a voter to make in Los Angeles alone. An indication of the constituencies to which candidates must appeal is reflected in the number of languages printed on the ballot: Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Tagalog, Vietnamese and Spanish. </p> <p>Spice has been added to the presidential race by the opening last week of the film The Contender, starring Joan Allen and Gary Oldman. Allen plays a strong and honourable Democratic vice-presidential candidate and Oldman an unattractive and creepy Republican at odds with each other over allegations of sexual high jinks. </p> <p>The film, which was re-edited by DreamWorks, whose founders are all big Democra tic party supporters, has been accused of being a political commercial for the Democrats timed to hit the voters subliminally just as they make up their minds about voting.</p>",
  "Italy's anti-racism campaigners have been left reeling by a teacher who faked an assault by neo-Nazis. <p>Luis Marsiglia, a Jewish convert to Catholicism, fled to South America yesterday after admitting he fabricated an attack which shocked the country and fuelled fears of swelling anti-semitism. </p> <p>The centre-right opposition demanded an apology from those who accused it of fostering racism with xenophobic rhetoric. </p> <p>Mr Marsiglia, who taught theology at Verona's elite Maffei secondary school, dominated the headlines last month after reporting that he had been ambushed by three youths wielding iron bars. </p> <p>Cut and bruised, the Uruguay-born teacher had suggested that his assailants were pupils unleashed by colleagues. </p> <p>He said: \"The gang were shouting things in support of J\u00f6rg Haider. They screamed: 'You're a dirty Jew, get out of Verona'.\" </p> <p>He added that a swastika had been painted on his door and showed investigators anti-semitic icons allegedly sent to him as part of a hate campaign. </p> <p>The ruling centre-left coalition blamed the opposition leader Silvio Berlusconi for rising racism by making an issue of race and immigration. </p> <p>\"The centre right should examine its conscience,\" said Pierluigi Castagnetti, leader of the Italian Popular party. </p> <p>Investigators exposed the deception at the weekend. Mr Marsiglia, 43, admitted beating his legs with a piece of wood and scratching his arms with an iron bar. </p> <p>His lawyer, Guariente Guarienti, said the teacher was distraught at the prospect of losing his job after failing to provide evidence of his qualifications.</p>"
