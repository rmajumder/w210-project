  "Glasgow, 3.30pm on Thursday. Preceded by a gentle, recorded harp strum, the cheerful conductor welcomed passengers aboard Virgin Train's 15.38 Glasgow Central to London Euston service with good news. Against all the odds, the train was prepared and would depart from Platform 1 on time. <p>We passengers, who had arrived braced for unhappy tidings, settled back in our seats, picked up our newspapers and smugly congratulated ourselves on our uncanny ability to sidestep the near-paralysis to which Britain's crumbling rail network had been reduced last week. </p> <p>At 3.39pm, another tinny harp strum. This time, the conductor said, there had been a slight hiccough: there was no driver. Through every carriage swept the resigned groan of travellers. 'We'll be on our way as soon as we find him,' the Tannoy voice added half-heartedly. </p> <p>It was 40 minutes before the driver appeared for duty. Before it had left the platform in Glasgow, the service was almost an hour behind the timetable. This was an inauspicious start. There was worse to come. </p> <p>This weekend the rail network is undergoing its biggest repair programme for more than a century. More than 20,000 Railtrack staff are working to repair 41,000 metres of rail identified as unsafe in the wake of the Hatfield derailment 12 days ago. Across the country, engineers have identified 1,850 rails with hairline cracks similar to those responsible for the latest tragedy. </p> <p>But with 20mph speed restrictions in operation on more than 160 stretches of line and little agreement on how quickly the operation can be completed, it is the hundreds of thousands of passengers, hit by widespread cancellations and severe delays, who are being forced to suffer. </p> <p>Like us unfortunate souls on the 15.38 last Thursday. For a mid-afternoon service, the train was busy; all the seats filled with business people, Scots heading to London for a long weekend, English families returning south at the end of the half-term break and tourists whose quick jaunt north had turned into an ordeal by rail. In the spaces between carriages, those unlucky enough to have been too late to get a seat made themselves as comfortable as they could as we finally pulled out of Glasgow. </p> <p>We at least had the small consolation that the train was moving at all. It was one of the first cross-border services to leave Glasgow after Railtrack's sudden decision to close the busy West Coast Main Line between the city and Gretna on Wednesday and equally sudden decision to reopen it on Thursday. Until the 15.38, passengers had been ferried on buses to Carlisle to pick up trains to take them further south. </p> <p>The West Coast Line is among the worst hit by years of disrepair. It is barely 100 miles from Glasgow to Carlisle, but on that stretch of track last week Railtrack engineers identified 179 hairline cracks. At least 32 of those sites require immediate repair or remedial work. Even taking all this into account, however, we remained warily confident that we would get to our destinations in a reasonable time. I had been assured by the man at the ticket window that 40 minutes late would be about as bad as it got. On top of the 40 minutes we had already waited for the driver, that would mean getting into Euston by 10.30pm, as against the scheduled time of 9.09pm. A respectable result given the poor start, especially as it meant being in London in time for last orders. </p> <p>For the first hour out of Glasgow, things seemed fine. Admittedly, the train may not have been going flat out, but it was still moving at a steady clip. Twice it had slowed right down, but both occasions had been mercifully brief. Then, at 5.34pm, we stopped. On the steep hillside to the right, a few sheep wandered down for a closer look before continuing their grazing. Through the trees down to the left, traffic flashed south on the M74. </p> <p>After a few minutes, just as the motorway buses began to take on a Space Age air of sleek efficiency, the train lurched forward into motion. Just. We set off so slowly that the sheep were still able to overtake us in search of fresh grass. As the sky blackened, the passengers on Coach C looked at each other in the grim realisation that the real trouble was just about to start. </p> <p>'I can't believe this is happening again,' said Lauren Nicholls, a 20-year-old student from Vancouver. 'I travelled up to Scotland from London on Tuesday and it took me 10 hours. I've been up here for two days and I've spent most of that on these trains. This whole trip has been a disaster.' </p> <p>We trundled on. By 6pm, we should have been long past Carlisle. As the lights of a town finally started to appear, some passengers gathered their belongings and made their way towards the doors. The train rolled along a platform and seemed to be about to stop. Then a sign passed the window: Lockerbie. Nearly two and a half hours after our scheduled departure, we had yet to reach the border. </p> <p>At 6.39pm, the train finally pulled into Carlisle. According to the conductor, we were now running 107 minutes late. On Coach C, the response was muted. A sort of Dunkirk spirit had kicked in as a group of passengers swapped stories of previous losing battles with the West Coast Line. </p> <p>David Gordon, from Motherwell, recounted the time he, his wife and two children had been on a train north when it had broken down at Oxenholme station in the Lake District and they had had to wait for two hours on a bus. </p> <p>Niall Thomas was not to be outdone. The IT consultant from Glasgow had been on his way to a stag night in Newcastle recently when, after many hours of delay and still far short of their destination, it was announced that the train was terminating where it stood. 'The guy came on and said that anybody travelling to Newcastle should try again the next day,' said Thomas. 'The worst thing was, the groom-to-be was with me, so he missed his own stag do.' </p> <p>'It is a fantastic way to travel when everything goes well,' sympathised Gordon. 'But when it goes wrong, it seems to go horribly wrong.' Prophetic words indeed. </p> <p>The train continued through the North-West at funeral pace. At times, the only way to be sure we were still moving was by watching the dark outlines of the trees that passed the windows in painful slow motion. By 7.35pm we reached Oxenholme, the third of 13 stops. Preston came into sight 40 minutes later, but with each mile that barely passed beneath our wheels London seemed further away. Gradually, the curiously British thrill at a shared ordeal was replaced by boredom, then frustration and finally anger. </p> <p>In the buffet car, Paul Donald and Tony O'Keefe had had enough. Their journey had began at 6.15 that morning, 217 miles north of Aberdeen on an oil rig in the Norwegian sector of the North Sea. They should have been in the pub with their mates in Liverpool at the start of two weeks' leave. Instead they were still stuck on a train somewhere to the north. 'This is driving me fucking insane,' Donald growled. 'This lot are taking the piss. If they want to shut down the railway, they should do that, but if they are going to take \u00a375 off me for a ticket they should at least try and get me there. They're too greedy to say no to the money. That's their problem.' </p> <p>'It's those notice boards they put up in the stations with the efficiency figures,' said O'Keefe. 'It's always 98.8 something. Where the fuck do they get that garbage from?' The feeling of tempers rapidly fraying filled the air. Mine included. In the seat behind me, a small boy decided the best fun he could have was to lift up the tray table attached to the back of my seat and slam it down as hard as his little arms could. For a full half-hour he continued with his game, while his parents looked on, clearly relieved that it wasn't them he was bothering. I could take no more. 'Is there any chance you could get him to stop?' I asked his mother politely. 'He's only three, you know,' she snapped in reply and turned back to her magazine. </p> <p>Perhaps wisely, the train staff, other than the buffet manager, had been conspicuous by their absence. Apart from one early foray to check tickets, the conductor limited his presence to doleful Tannoy announcements at each station of the number of minutes we were now behind schedule. He was replaced at Crewe by a new man who walked down the train with the latest estimated times of arrival. </p> <p>At 9.09pm, the scheduled time for reaching Euston, we were still somewhere in the Midlands, north of Stafford. But the new conductor had some news: even at this pathetic rate, we would be in London between 11.25pm and 11.40pm. So when the buffet man announced at 10.30pm that he was closing for the night, we took that as a good sign. Wrong. At 11pm, the conductor came on the Tannoy to tell us that we would now reach Milton Keynes by 11.25pm, and London half an hour later. By a quarter to midnight, with Milton Keynes still to materialise, the conductor gave up making any predictions. </p> <p>Most of us had given up hope of ever reaching anywhere. As we lumbered through the darkness, it felt as if we had been abandoned to our fate as the rest of Britain tucked up for the night. Occasionally, we would slow down even more. But finally we reached Milton Keynes, then Watford. London could not be far off. Once again we had underestimated the seriousness of our predicament and it was not until 12.59am - nearly three hours 50 minutes late - that we pulled into Euston. Passengers piled out to be greeted by loved ones with the enthusiasm of those who had started to lose all hope. </p> <p>From Glasgow to London, a distance of 400 miles, had taken more than nine hours, almost the same amount of time as it takes to fly from London to South Africa, across some 53 countries and the length of the African continent. After all this, we deserved some good news and it finally came at Euston. There was another train at least an hour behind us. We were not the most unfortunate souls in Britain after all. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:stuart.millar@observer.co.uk\">stuart.millar@observer.co.uk</a></p>",
  "It began as just another row about funding for the arts, but accusations of anti-Semitism and character assassination have turned the drama over Berlin's opera houses into a bitter battle of political ideologies, cultural visions and musical egos. <p>The outcome will determine the future of opera in the German capital and, according to some critics, shape the cultural climate in the city for a generation. </p> <p>At the centre of the row is Daniel Barenboim, the Israeli pianist and conductor who has been musical director of the Deutsche Staatsoper on Berlin's Unter den Linden since 1992. Barenboim last week accepted an apology from Klaus Landowsky, the leader of Berlin's Christian Democrats, who had referred to him as 'the Jew' Barenboim. </p> <p>Landowsky insisted he meant to compliment Barenboim when he compared him with Christian Thielemann, the 41-year-old musical wunderkind he described as 'the young Karajan'. </p> <p>'I have been working in Germany for many years with great joy and have been a resident of Berlin for almost a decade. I am very surprised to learn now, for the first time, that attention should be called to my Judaism in relation to my music-making or to my duties at the Staatsoper. I find this offensive and disturbing, be it mentioned in a positive or a negative context,' Barenboim said. </p> <p>Thielemann, who is musical director of the Deutsche Oper in the West of the city, has denied saying that, if Barenboim left Berlin, it would be 'the end of the Jewish mess' in the capital. A shooting star who made an acclaimed debut at Bayreuth this year with Die Meistersinger, Thielemann makes no secret of his delight in being compared with Herbert von Karajan, who joined the Nazi party in 1933. </p> <p>The young conductor insists his preference for German composers does not mean he is a nationalist. But left-wingers have long regarded him as suspect, and Barenboim revealed last week that Thielemann approached him three years ago to deny rumours he had made anti-Semitic remarks. </p> <p>'I accepted that and said to him: Christian, if it's not true, you don't have to defend yourself. If it is true, you have no business here.' </p> <p>Thielemann has suggested the latest rumours have been timed to prevent him from assuming a key position in a reform of Berlin's three opera houses. The Staatsoper and the Deutsche Oper would be merged with the loss of 353 jobs - including those of 77 musicians. </p> <p>Barenboim has described the proposal as 'cultural vandalism' which would destroy the identity of both orchestras and both opera houses. </p> <p>'It is a cynical proposal that may have been born out of despair. But it won't work, financially or culturally, to say nothing of the human dimension.' The Staatsoper orchestra, known as the Staatskapelle, is the second oldest in the world, with a history stretching back to the sixteenth century. </p> <p>While Barenboim has been fighting to retain the separate identity of the opera houses, Thielemann has hinted he would happily take charge of the merged opera. Thielemann is due to leave the Deutsche Oper next year when the composer Udo Zimmermann, with whom the young conductor says he cannot work, takes over as artistic director. </p> <p>Under the merger plan there is no role for Zimmermann, and Berlin's Culture Minister has indicated he would like Thielemann to play a leading role in the new structure. </p> <p>The opera house battle is taking place amid a heated debate over a call by the Christian Democrats' parliamentary leader, Friedrich Merz, for the country's Leitkultur, or 'defining culture', to be protected from the influence of immigration. Some critics regard the attention drawn to Barenboim's Jewish origin as part of a trend towards cultural nationalism that borders on racism. </p> <p>Barenboim wants the federal government to take responsibility for the Staatsoper. The government says this is out of the question. Thielemann has been playing down the rumours of anti-Semitism and insisted last week that Berlin remained a model of tolerance. 'In our orchestra we have 16 different nationalities. I work with singers, most of whom don't come from Germany, and with orchestras in Europe, the US and Israel. Berlin is the most liberal city of all,' he said. </p> <p>\u0095 Denis Staunton writes for the 'Irish Times'.</p>",
  "The hills that surround Bogot\u00e1 were wrapped with long, low strands of cloud. The sky was a flat, greasy grey. Beyond the huge municipal dump, the sprawling city ended abruptly. After the maze of corrugated-iron roofs, wires and TV aerials of the squatter camps, the hillsides were an abrupt green. <p>Oscar Ruiz and his wife, Martha, and their four children can just see the hills if they walk to the highest point of their barrio (slum neighbourhood). But they haven't been out of Bogot\u00e1 since they arrived. </p> <p>Fifteen months ago, the family were forced to flee the farm in the jungles of the far south of Colombia that had been their home for 15 years. Oscar says that to walk among hills above his slum neighbourhood would make him homesick. Anyway, he adds, wounds he received from right-wing paramilitaries who evicted him make exercise difficult. </p> <p>Oscar is a desplacado - one of 35,000 'displaced' by the filthy, decade-long war that blights Colombia, once one of Latin America's richest states. </p> <p>Many flee rural areas for the relative safety of the cities, particularly Bogot\u00e1. Oscar's home is close to Bol\u00edvar, the biggest of the squatter camps that ring the city like a skin disease. Jes\u00fas, my taxi driver, said it would be too dangerous to take a gringo into its winding, rubbish-strewn lanes. </p> <p>In the dusk, Bol\u00edvar, named after the liberator who freed much of the region from Spanish colonial rule, looked strangely beautiful. Tens of thousands of softly lit shack windows stretched all the way up to the ridge and the mild evening sky. </p> <p>As we drove through the barrio's outer streets, my taxi driver Jes\u00fas, who himself lives on squatted land, spoke of gang fights, drugs wars and 10-year-olds addicted to glue. Few can afford cocaine, even at $10 a gram. </p> <p>Crime in Bol\u00edvar is so bad that shopkeepers and residents have whip-rounds to hire assassins to kill suspected wrongdoers. </p> <p>Many of the inhabitants of Bol\u00edvar and other barrios are desplacados who, like Oscar, have fled from one battlefield only to end up trapped in another. There are bitter turf wars between right-wing paramilitary groups and the left-wing Farc (Armed Revolutionary Front of Colombia) over homes. Currently, in Bol\u00edvar at least, the Farc is, Jes\u00fas said, the de facto local authority. </p> <p>A battle between the Farc and the right-wing paramilitaries (who share responsibility for the massacres, gang-rapes, kidnappings and disappearances that scar Colombia's recent history) forced Oscar off his coffee, banana and dairy farm in the southern Putumayo district last year. </p> <p>Putumayo is the hottest combat zone in the country, close to some of the biggest coca-growing areas. In many ways, the battle there is over cocaine. Both the guerrillas and the paramilitaries, who are funded by landowners and have strong links to the Colombian military, try to control the population through intimidation. </p> <p>In the last year, to pre-empt Plan Colombia - the massive American military aid package designed to win the war against the guerrillas for the government - the guerrillas launched new offensives. And the paramilitaries responded. </p> <p>In September last year, 40 heavily armed paramilitaries walked onto Oscar's farm. 'You have been collaborating with the guerrillas,' they told him. 'You must leave your land.' </p> <p>There was little that the slight, softly spoken Oscar could say in defence. When, on several occasions, the Farc arrived at the farm wanting breakfast, he had fed them. 'What else was I to do?' he asked me. </p> <p>The paras gave him a week to leave. He refused to go. After eight days, they smashed his door, took his eldest son hostage and then shot Oscar when he tried to stop them. Two bullets hit his arm, two his belly and one his shin. </p> <p>He managed to run away and hurl himself into the river nearby, which marks the border with Ecuador. Fished out by an Indian in a canoe, he spent the next six months convalescing across the border before returning to find his family in Bogot\u00e1. </p> <p>Or some of his family. His eldest son had remained a prisoner of the paramilitaries. After eight months in captivity, he had escaped and, amazingly, found his family in Bogot\u00e1. But he had changed. The paras made him kill a man, and he had been splattered with his victim's blood and brains. They injected him with drugs. He had been driven insane. He died in Oscar's arms in a Bogot\u00e1 hospital, only 11 years old. 'My last memory of him,' says Oscar, 'is of his eyes staring out of his skull. He had seen things no one should see.' </p> <p>Now life is a struggle for food and warmth. The six of them live in a small room. Oscar, who is 34, occasionally gets some work as a labourer. Otherwise they live on handouts. The government has aid programmes for the desplacados, but corruption and inefficiency means most is siphoned off into the rich elite's offshore bank accounts. </p> <p>Oscar has been arrested for protesting over this 'robbery' of the aid his family needs. </p> <p>He is not afraid to be named, though he does not want to be photographed. He plans to organise more demonstrations. 'Tell the world about these bastards who are taking the bread from our mouths,' he tells me. </p> <p>Jes\u00fas shakes his head as he turns the taxi back towards the centre of town, the good hotels and expensive restaurants and the shopping malls where you can buy \u00a3100 handbags. 'Someone will kill him soon,' he says sadly. 'He is making too much noise.'</p>",
  "'What's in that big box, Mum?' <p>'It's a Land Rover, Maud.' </p> <p>Quizzical look from Maud, three-and-a-half years old. 'What, like Johnny the Builder's Land Rover, Mummy?' </p> <p>Not exactly. Johnny the Builder is one of a not-so-rare breed: Land Rover Man. There are two variants of this breed, and Johnny the Builder is the more likeable, romantic type; he is Old Land Rover Man. He has two Land Rovers, both built in the 80s. In May, he spent a weekend putting the gearbox of one into the other, because summer was coming and he would be using the non-paint-covered, roofless version more than the heater-equipped fully enclosed one. Both gearboxes were knackered, but this one was less so. </p> <p>Men who own old Land Rovers do that sort of thing. They're rugged, you see. The men, that is. The vehicles are less so. People believe Land Rovers can cross deserts, uninhabited landscapes and ice floes with ease. They're British, tough and uncomplaining, with battle scars and hidden depths. The spine-wrecking seats, non-existent shock absorbers and patchy green and brown paint only increase their value as a motorised, romantic folly. Not that Johnny and his kind can see that: they're blinded by love. </p> <p>New Land Rover Men, on the other hand, love their vehicles because they are a sensible style statement. New Land Rover Man used to belong to the 'County Set' - they once owned land which they'd farm. But today they only drive to the country (where the trickiest terrain they encounter are the puddles on the newly widened A666) from their work in the City, and their homes in London's deep Ws, SWs and far Es. These men relish their Englishness and wear tweed woven in Taiwan. And have plenty of children. 'The more the merrier, because the world's too full of them and not enough of us, what!' </p> <p>Which is where pushchairs come in. Pegasus Pushchairs has built an all-terrain buggy with all the appeal and sensible structure of a Land Rover. It even comes in Land Rover 'livery', which is actually a piece of green canvas done up to look like tarpaulin, and is stamped with the Land Rover marque. This is resolutely not a trendy, three-wheeled baby-jogger. Oh no. This is a tough, no-nonsense, inflatable-tyred style statement. It says so in the press release. It's a 'tough, go-anywhere product to match an adventurous lifestyle.' </p> <p>Right, we told Maud, we're going to go anywhere in our Land Rover, what do you think, Maud? Oh, she's gone off to read Hansel &amp; Gretel to Barbie. Edie (18 months) is interested, though. She's climbed in already. She never does that with the other pushchair. Mind you, the other pushchair is not taking up a third of the enormous kitchen extension so recently built by Johnny the Builder. Off we go. </p> <p>Camden High Street might not be the Highlands, but it's pocked and slippery and filled with wildlife. The buggy glides though the messy mass of goofy Goths and Japanese tourists without turning a head. So we head for Primrose Hill and the more appreciative flocks of wannabe Jude'n'Sadies, yoga-barefoots and older parents who are seriously into Style Statements. </p> <p>When we push Edie in her MacLaren buggy with Maud on the buggyboard through Primrose Hill, people look at us a little askew, as if to ask, why have you strapped your poor daughter to the back of that whitetrash contraption? Now, with Maud being forced to walk as the buggyboard won't fit the enormous wheel base of the Land Rover, Edie is carried along like a mini Cleopatra and the perfectly flossed in the Regent's Park Road caf\u00e9s smile at her as if to say 'We accept you, one of us.' It's hell. </p> <p>Running across the grass on the hill, the buggy travels lightly and fairly smoothly, although an attempt to swerve right too quickly almost threw the thing over. And parking it on the incline needed a hefty swipe at the brakes to get it to stay in place. Edie, though, is in bouncy-castle heaven, gurgling happily at every aerobicised bump. There's actually very little support for her head or back in this thing (but then Land Rovers don't have headrests and only put seatbelts in because it's the law), and there's no reclining element to the seat. It's just a bit of sack slung over two poles. </p> <p>In the playground, it attracted the attention of an older father (in tweed) who's very impressed by the Land Rover badge. He's definitely a New Land Rover Man. 'What's this, eh?' He asks - all glad-fellow-well-met - while casting an anxious glance at Maud's dad's number-two crop. 'Gad, wouldn't mind one of these. Any good?' Well, that depends. Do you have more than one child? 'Ah yes, got three.' Well, it's difficult with this model, but there's a double seater. It's difficult to steer with one hand, you see, because you have to push the handle down to raise the front wheels in order to turn or get up the pavement, and it's quite wide and the brakes don't work brilliantly... 'Just like the motor, eh? Haw, haw.' </p> <p>Back at home, getting it over our high doorstep, the chassis is scraped. The yellow paint comes off. Edie laughs. And carries on laughing as we try to get the thing down. Leaning frontways over the handle to reach the levers you end up huffing and puffing like a hunted fox. </p> <p>Yes, this is certainly a Land Rover. When down it doesn't fasten together, lies only flat-ish, and any attempt to move the folded vehicle results in flapping arms, bruised knees and giggling children. Presumably, one is supposed to leave the thing in the boot of the 4x4 covered in mud and then throw it ostentatiously out on to the Kensington/Putney/Bow/ pavement, letting it snap into place as it lands. </p> <p>Johnny, when or if he has kids, would probably like a second-hand one of these. He'd probably customise it with an old leather armchair, or something. Edie likes it, too. But then, whenever Johnny comes into our house she points at him, smiles and says, 'Dadda.'</p> <p><b> Land Rover's pushchair</b></p> <p> <b> Price </b> \u00a3385 <br> <b>Weight </b> 14lb (5.9kg) <br> <b>Height </b> 38in (94cm) <br> <b>Wheels </b> 4x12in <br> <b> 0-60ft </b> 12 seconds (if child strapped in tightly)</p>",
  "Albert Louden is one of Britain's best-known and most successful Outsider artists. His paintings are sold at auction at Sotheby's and Christie's. A neat, shy man in black trousers and brown Chelsea boots, he sits in his living room in Leyton, east London, and talks about art and life. On the carpet next to him are copies of the new Blake biography and Isaiah Berlin's The Hedgehog and the Fox. <p>The room's dull colours form a good neutral background for several small, luminous paintings which shine on the walls. The work is instantly recognisable as Louden's. There are strange cartoon-like figures, androgynes sprouting tiny humanoids along the curves of their lips and arms; bulbous men with dome-heads painted in blocks of bright pink, red and yellow; skinny domineering women; backdrops of child-like tower blocks with tiny windows and claustrophobic rooms.</p> <p>The colours have the impact of a Matisse; the strange characters betray the sneaky oddness of a surrealist's mind. Louden calls them his 'internal landscapes' and says he has no idea where they come from or what they mean. 'I think they're odd,' he says, 'but not depressing. I've destroyed sackfuls of them in the past because they came out vicious or nasty.' </p> <p>Louden is unhappy about the label 'Outsider' which originally launched him on the art scene. Thirty years after his work was first exhibited, he feels the term ghettoises him. The Outsider Art concept can be traced back to the 1930s and the paintings done by patients in a number of Swiss mental asylums. The French painter Jean Dubuffet called the work Art Brut (Raw Art). In turn, art historian Roger Cardinal coined the term 'Outsider Art'. Picasso and Klee were amongst the early artists drawn to the genre, inspired by their shared fascination with psychoanalysis. </p> <p>Because most Outsider artists steer clear of the art world and of each other's work, and have no theoretical basis or analysis for it, there is little chance of a 'movement'. They tend to work like techno producers and computer nerds, tucked away in a timeless vacuum at home; sometimes only discovered after they die. They just get on with it and are often amused and surprised that anyone will sell or buy their outpourings. Today's artists have little in common with 1930s mental asylum patients, but they do share a lack of art training and no motivation to paint-to-sell. Without exception, they have to paint or draw. </p> <p>Louden works for seven hours most days when he is not globe-trotting with his paintings. Articulate and self-educated, he was a Marxist activist in east London's labour disputes of the 60s and 70s. He used to store his huge canvases in his garden shed, but they rotted and he had to throw them out. These days, he sells paintings in New York and was recently invited to show in Quito, Peru, at the Mexican Cultural Centre. 'I sold some paintings, too! ' he laughs shyly, hand over mouth. 'The German ambassador bought one.' Louden's work appears in London galleries beyond the tiny Outsider circuit; he plans a 2001 exhibition in Mayfair. </p> <p>Louden paints in the front bedroom where weights and a fitness machine share space with yet more paintings. This is where his latest work can be found. Even though the curtains are drawn, the colour on four huge canvases pours like sunlight through cathedral windows. Clotted oils shift from one rich colour to another. But where are his Louden people? 'I've been experimenting,' he smiles. 'I always experimented, even at the beginning, abstracts as well as figures.' He reveals a mildewed scrapbook containing blurry, 20-year-old prints. Some look like Turner landscapes. 'I'd been arguing for a long time with my work, in isolation, but never came to terms with it,' he says. </p> <p>The British market for Outsider Art was first championed by the late Victor Musgrave, a leading light on the 60s art scene. He promoted the work of Britain's best known Outsider artist Scottie Wilson. Wilson, who died in 1972, was a self-taught, working-class man who specialised in intricate ink-coloured drawings of strange flippered creatures and trees filled with mythic creatures. It wasn't long before other collectors became interested. Henry Boxer started collecting visionary and mystical works in the 60s: 'These outsiders and psychotics appealed to me because they were doing things without any drugs at the time when we were using LSD and mescaline to get to the same place,' he recalls. </p> <p>George Melly has been a collector of Outsider Art for more than 30 years. For him, it fulfils a lot of what surrealism achieved. 'You lower a bucket into the mind, pull it up and examine it,' he states with relish. 'It's the lack of consciousness and self-consciousness that I like. Artists today are so self-conscious, they consider the market first, whereas for Outsiders, the thing exists of itself and they do it because they have to - whether it will sell or not. Art should be magical, and these are magical, compulsive things.' </p> <p>These days, the London art map is being re-written by a handful of maverick dealers who are specialising in this awkward genre of Outsider Art. They are viewed by the majority of dealers with almost as much suspicion as the artists they represent. The problem is that they promote work which lacks the very commodity which keeps the Hoxton-Saatchi scene alive: a concept. Instead, Outsider Art combines a contemporary edginess with irrepressible exuberance and frequently reveals a sophisticated design sense reminiscent of the tribal artists working in Africa and Australia.</p> <p>A new landmark in Outsider and Marginal art is the England &amp; Co Gallery, located in the golden retail mile of Westbourne Grove, between Agn\u00e8s b clothes and Tom Conran foodstuffs. Jane England is attracting buyers who include 'art' on their shopping lists. England is fiercely protective of the artists she exhibits, and yet she also wants to bring them to a wider audience: 'They shouldn't be treated like mushrooms and kept under a stone,' she says sternly. 'They're not freaks!' </p> <p>England's current exhibition is a collection of strange, perverse pencil drawings by a Kent geography graduate called Chris Hipkiss. Stand close enough to them and visitors disappear into intricate, alien landscapes, fields and city streets. Intriguing from a distance, close to they divulge some startling secrets: rows of women hanging upside down compose a hedge, strapping dominatrixes driving bobsleighs made from mutant trees, fields of corn cobs numbered like soldiers in a drill parade or mutated into missiles. </p> <p>Hipkiss also dislikes the tag of Outsider artist. He insists he's just 'an ordinary guy. I wear jeans and T-shirts. I've got a degree in geography. I draw. That's what I do.' He draws obsessively for hours on end at the table in the living room of his small rough-and-ready cottage in Kent, with the cats cavorting around him, and the television on in the background. As a child, he made models, encouraged by his father who runs the family joinery business where Hipkiss used to work. He sees no difference between what they each do for a living. He has strong views about 'outsiderness' and thinks there are few real outsiders at work today. 'People making environments, using shells and stuff, or living in institutions where they don't know about the world, come closest to real outsiders. They'll be discovered when they die. I'm definitely not an outsider, I'm in the world,' he says. </p> <p>John Maizels, editor of the glossy magazine Raw Vision, and author of the lavishly illustrated book, Raw Creation has a unique international overview of Outsider Art. The magazines reports on all kinds of beautiful and terrifying sculptures, doodles created on scraps of old cornflakes packets, recycled canvases built from bits of timber, stone, shells, and junk - work from countries as diverse as Croatia, Italy, Slovakia, Moscow, Japan, the United States, and Britain. Raw Vision is based in Maizels's incongruously quaint Hertfordshire cottage, which doubles as a gallery. The deceptively quiet former art teacher has a punkish delight in the art which now rules his life. For him, Outsider artists are 'people who are completely out of it, automatic. They never make changes or mistakes, don't take the pencil off the paper until it's finished. It just flows from the subconscious.' His house is filled with the stuff. </p> <p>Albert Louden and Chris Hipkiss feature in Maizels's collection. As does the work of Damian and Delaine LeBas. Some artists, like Hipkiss, resent the label Outsider, but Damian LeBas, who comes from a line of tinker families based around Sheffield, has always felt like an outsider. The fact that both he and his wife went to art school - they studied fashion and textiles - would appear to disqualify them from the Outsider clan, but their art was never consistent with college rules. Today, Damian and Delaine who comes from a large south-coast Roma-gypsy family are the glamorous couple on the Outsider network, but their everyday life brings them abuse and insults for the way they look and live. Their home in Worthing is filled with gnomes and Elvis memorabilia, Damian's obsessive football collections and crazy paintings and Delaine's gypsy art and fabric collection.</p> <p>Damian LeBas made waves during his time at the Royal College of Art, where he would draw the tattoos on builders' arms rather than classic designs on Greek ceramics during museum outings, and embroider denim jackets with sequinned abstract designs while other students created curtain fabrics. Drawing was an early escape route from a disturbed childhood, 'I started drawing football crowds when I was six,' he remembers. 'I was fascinated by the patterns and colours,' he says. Cats are a lifelong obsession. Some years ago, he produced dozens of cat paintings with acid-hell Catherine-wheel eyes, drawn with clashing bright pencils and oil pastels. 'I did about 10 a day,' he recalls, 'so many, I thought I was turning into a cat, because I'm so hairy. I got very paranoid.' </p> <p>Delaine LeBas could have been many things in life - fashion model, designer, artist. Her startling beauty and highly personal dress style has some of the kitsch beauty of the fairground. An early work called Me and my husband shows Delaine in a yellow, rose-covered jacket and flouncing tiered skirt, and Damian in soul boy's baggies and braces. They are standing in front of a caravan window and framed by floral designs which look like embroidery. Her gypsy background informs everything she does. 'My mum and dad always dressed me in strange, bizarre things - two-tone shoes, coats covered in tapestry, fancy things. But I'm glad for it. I'm an eternal child. I never make plans or drawings, it is all spontaneous.' </p> <p>Being an Outsider is not something Delaine considers relevant in her work. 'The art world is incredibly conservative. It's difficult for me to work in it because of what I am and where I come from, what I look like. I thought it was supposed to be about interesting people, fantastic things, but they ignore people like me.' For Delaine LeBas, the Outsider world is like family, just a collection of eccentric people ploughing their own route through life, and having fun on the way. </p> <p>Alex 'Perifimou' Georgiou also lives in Worthing and is a great friend of Damian and Delain LeBas. The 84-year-old Greek-Cypriot plays bingo once a week with his neighbours, drinks freshly made Greek coffee and is always on the lookout for a new lady friend. His flat is comfortable and homely, and filled with souvenirs from Cyprus. But there are also some small, brilliantly coloured paintings of cartwheeling animals and odd human figures - all painted at the dining table in this same room. </p> <p>Perifimou's early years, in a poor village just outside the Cyprus capital of Nikosia, were wretched, and he moved to London in 1935. He shifted between various jobs and then landed at the Royal Academy as a warder and later moved to the Tate Gallery. He sat among all the great paintings of the Western world, but only those of William Blake stirred him. He started drawing at the age of 59, discreetly making visual notes on small pieces of paper as he sat in his warden's chair, transforming them into small paintings later. </p> <p>Perifimou's forte is colour. He uses bright primaries blocked out into solid shapes and broken into scaly or feathery detail. Mythical, uncreated animals and acrobatic humans are his typical characters, the men with grinning expressions and whorled eyeballs. His neighbour, Damian LeBas explains Perifimou's art in terms of his Greek background: 'He was brought up thinking Ulysses was real. He says the stories are Greek dreams and all his own paintings are about Greek mythology.' Perifimou is far less analytical and simply shrugs with the now familiar response, that he loves to draw. </p> <p>There are some critics who believe that it's almost impossible to find genuine Outsider artists in Britain today. Either they have been trained in some way like Damian and Delaine LeBas, or they become successful and automatically gain entrance into the mainstream art world. </p> <p>An instinct for selling his work, for instance, has meant that Albert Louden has been 'excommunicated' from the Outsider clan. 'I had to hand my badge back,' he jokes. Prices for his work top \u00a35,000 in this country, higher in the US. Next year, an exhibition of his work is planned in Mayfair. </p> <p>Pearl Alcock, however, might be considered closer to the original definition of the word Outsider. She came to painting through necessity. When her local dress shop in Brixton, south London, failed and she was on the dole, she couldn't afford a birthday card for a friend so she painted one instead. That was back in 1985. An elderly Jamaican woman with an outgoing personality but poor health, she rarely leaves her first-floor flat. Instead, she sits in a special rocking chair and waits for the world, and what she calls her 'visions', to come to her. She sleeps a lot and has perfect recall of a rich dream world which is as real to her as waking time. </p> <p>Her sitting room is hardly a typical artist's atelier; the paints, brushes, sketch pads and paper are tidied away in the sideboard. And most surprisingly, the walls are bare. 'Everything I do has to come from my head,' Alcock explains, 'and that's why there's no pictures. I don't want them to disturb me.' I ask if a particularly vibrant landscape with heavenly-blue sky and hibiscus-red flowers were a Jamaican memory. 'I don't know,' she laughs. 'These things just come to me.' </p> <p>Pearl's paintings fit into three categories: narrative portraits, mostly without titles, although she conjures some up on the spot - 'The Africans', 'Woman and T'ief', 'Mermaid' and 'Merman'; flowers and abstracts, which create repeated patterns and reveal a tremendous intuitive sense of design. These are easily her most 'sophisticated' works in conventional terms. Birds regularly visit her visions, yellow canaries with puffed-up breasts based, elongated blue birds.</p> <p>She discusses all her works, as if seeing them for the first time. 'This bird is as big as the two boys,' she giggles at its ridiculous proportions, but adds that she really likes it. She is particularly fond of a beautiful portrait of a women with tearful eyes, painted in Tretchnikoff greens and blues. 'This woman died and when she woke up she was very sad because it's not like she thought.' But even Pearl has her collectors. George Melly lists her as a favourite artist and owns several of what she calls her 'dreams' and 'mood paintings'. Monika Kinley, one of the country's leading advocates of Outsider Art, calls her 'a visual poet'. In 2001, Pearl's work will be exhibited at the October Gallery in London. </p> <p>Will the Outsiders ever come in from the commercial cold? Jane England thinks Outsider Art should merge with the rest of the art world. 'I want to see an Outsider Room at the Tate Modern,' she says. West End dealer James Colman, who includes Scottie Wilson's works in an otherwise conventional modernist mix, thinks dealers should support young Outsider artists. 'It's bloomed in the US and the rest of Europe,' he says, 'but here it's still a gamble. It's up to us.' Perhaps the final word should go to Albert Louden, the ex-Marxist. 'It's all about market forces,' he says. 'I sometimes wonder if it's got anything to do with content. The young artists and the galleries are all a social network. Outsiders will never be in on that.'</p> <p>\u0095 Chris Hipkiss - Visionary Drawings is at England &amp; Co, 216 Westbourne Grove, London W11 (020 7221 0417) until 4 November</p> <p> Outsider websites: <a href=\"http://www.rawvision.com\" target=\"_NEW\">www.rawvision.com</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.outsiderart.co.uk\" target=\"_NEW\">www.outsiderart.co.uk</a> <br> <a href=\"http://www.abam.org\" target=\"_NEW\">www.abam.org</a></p>",
  "A ghost goes into a bar and orders a vodka and tonic. 'Sorry, sir,' says the barman. 'We don't serve spirits.' A well-aged joke perhaps but, as with spirits, the old ones are the best. We have that assurance from supernatural storyteller Edgar Allan Poe, the man to read on Halloween. <p>Why do we use the same word for a distilled drink and a ghost? It emerges from the Latin word to breathe, according to the Concise Oxford . More to do with impish spirits in bottles, according to the aptly titled Brewer's Dictionary of Phrase and Fable . </p> <p> Geist , in German, also manifests the two meanings (think fruit brandies such as Himbeergeist). Gist, in Dutch, means yeast, the organism essential to the creation of alcoholic drinks. The Dutch and Flemings swallow the 'g' in Gist, making it sound like 'yeast'. For a Flemish frightener on Tuesday, drink the strong ale called Duvel ('Devil'). </p> <p>Gist is etymologically linked to 'gas', as in the carbon dioxide that causes bubbles to rise in fermented drinks such as beers and sparkling wines. How about a Tuesday tipple of Veuve Cliquot champagne, known as 'The Widow' after the Grande Dame who piloted the company to its effervescent heights. </p> <p>When the existence of gases was first perceived, did they seem wraith-like? All words for yeast concern something rising, or levitating. Yeast in French is levure . Perhaps the same ghostly quality was perceived in the steam rising from the still when ardent spirits were first produced. The steam is recaptured and rematerialises with a new potency as 'the water of life', the meaning of so many spirits' names: aquavit, eau-de-vie, vodka (the ironic Slavs' 'little water'), the Gaelic usquebaugh (anglicised to 'whisky'). </p> <p>Tuesday night is the festival of the dead. Having risen from the grave, a vampire might fancy Bull's Blood. Or a Bloody Mary, ideally with Transylvanian vodka. The Dracula story inspired Nosferatu , a classic German expressionist movie, which has found an echo in the Judderman of the current Metz television commercials. Metz is allegedly a schnapps with a hint of citrus. A new black version, seemingly intended to be especially frightening, reminded me of sarsaparilla, or perhaps sherbet sucked through a liquorice tube. </p> <p>Gin allegedly ruins mothers, but it has always seemed to me a ghostly spirit. Perhaps I am remembering Hogarth's emaciated images. 'Gin, the vampyre of the nation,' says an 18th-century account. 'Ghoul and vampire, demon and din. The dram of Satan! The liquor of sin!' pronounces an 1843 temperance poem. Or does the classically oily, almost iridescent and rarely glimpsed Lamplighter gin evoke London fogs and Jack the Ripper? I last saw it in a pub called Sherlock's, in Minneapolis. </p> <p>In Greenwich, there is more to Cutty Sark than tea. The clipper was named after the chemise worn by a witch in Burns's poem Tam O'Shanter . (Burns also wrote a poem called Halloween , and the festival was once considered a purely Scottish affair.) Cutty Sark Scotch, with its faintly salty, nutty, coconut-like flavours, somehow suggests a disreputable bar in the tropics. </p> <p>In Brazil, the rum-like cacha\u00e7a is used to make a fruit punch for spooky saints' days. In Mexico, I once ate goat beneath a triptych depicting the angel of death. The meal was preceded by a selection of tequilas, including one called Las Animas ('The Souls') and another labelled Chamuco ('Devil'). </p> <p>In Haitian voodoo ceremonies, rum is poured on the ground for the consumption of the gods. I would not waste any liquor to appease the deities, certainly not the elegant, spicy Rhum Barbancourt, the only Haitian example I have found in Britain. </p> <p>The bat that appears with Bacardi rum turns out to be a good luck symbol from Cuba. Perhaps it's time to join Ernest Hemingway: at this time of year, his choice would surely have been a shot or two of absinthe, blended with champagne. He called it Death in the Afternoon . </p> <p> <b> Cocktails from the crypt </b> </p> <p> <b> Corpse reviver</b> </p> <p>1oz Cognac <br> 1oz Fernet Branca (bitter Italian liqueur) <br> 1oz peppermint cordial or white cr\u00e8me de menthe </p> <p>Shake with ice.

  "<p>Each night in Monte Carlo, it is said, a recording of predatory birds is transmitted through hidden loudspeakers in the main square to prevent sparrows from soiling the famous casino's pristine lawn. And each morning a platoon of gardeners removes dying petals from the immaculate flowerbeds. Amid such stainless perfection, a prison could look embarrassingly conspicuous. The authorities in the world's wealthiest state have dealt with the problem by locating the local jail on the very extremity of its tiny landmass. Of the thousands of tour- ists who file past the old fort on the rocky promontory of Monaco Ville, between the Oceanographic Museum and a cheesy celebration of the Grimaldi family called the Monte Carlo Story, very few realise that incarcerated within its walls are the principality's 20 or so prisoners. There are no signboards nor, indeed, any apparent entrance. The only clues to its true purpose are the bars on the windows and the battery of security cameras on the roof - hardly an atypical sight in Monaco. </p> <p>Among the inmates, most of whom are imprisoned for fraud or other white-collar crime, is Ted Maher, a 42-year-old former Green Beret in the US Army. Last December, Maher was arrested following the deaths of billionaire banker Edmond Safra and his nurse in circumstances that remain oblique and subject to a multitude of speculative theories. Initially, Maher was not a suspect. Those who were, suggested one newspaper, 'range from the Russian mafia to Japanese investors, through drug cartels and Middle Eastern trading companies'. It seemed that Safra, 67, who was renowned for his protective shield of Israeli bodyguards, was a man with no shortage of enemies. And, equally, Maher, a smalltown American who never travelled beyond US borders in his three years in the army, appeared to be someone who was a total stranger to both drug cartels and the Moscow mafia. </p> <p>How he came to be in Monaco was a result of unforeseeable happenstance. Working at the Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center in New York, where he had qualified as a licensed nurse, Maher found an expensive camera which he promptly returned to its owner. The photographer mentioned the story to an associate, Safra, who was sufficiently impressed to offer Maher a position as part of his 12-strong medical team - the banker suffered from Parkinson's Disease. </p> <p>The unworldly Maher spoke not a word of French. Safra, a Lebanese Jew with Brazilian nationality who lived mostly in the south of France, was fluent in French, English, Italian, Portuguese, Arabic and Hebrew. Maher was a tall, slender man with an open manner. Safra was short and bald and enigmatic. Maher had an ongoing property dispute with his next-door neighbour in upper New York State. Safra owned a vast penthouse in Monaco and La Leopolda, the magnificent villa in Villefranche built on the estate that once belonged to Belgium's genocidal King Leopold II. He also possessed homes in Paris, Geneva, London, New York and Brazil. </p> <p>In any other circumstances, the closest Maher might have come to Safra would have been to cash a cheque in one of his banks. But, as it was, Maher left his wife and three children in Stormville, New York, and his secure post at Columbia-Presbyterian, and flew to the French Riviera and a $600-a-day ringside view of the life of one of the world's richest and most mysterious men. </p> <p> As far back as 1957, Edmond Safra was named as a drug trafficker in a US Bureau of Narcotics report. The accusation was later withdrawn, but until his death Safra was the inspiration for countless unsubstantiated rumours that linked him to drug, gold and currency trafficking, money laundering and organised crime. </p> <p>The Safra family came from the Halabi merchants of northern Lebanon, a close-knit clan of Sephardic Jewish traders who historically made their money from financing the camel caravans of the Middle East. Edmond's father Jacob opened the family bank in 1920, building on the Safras' long experience in gold and currency exchange. Sephardic tradition maintained that the family business should be passed on to the oldest son. But such was his precocious interest in banking that the young Edmond leapfrogged his elder brother, Elie, to be selected by his father as the prime heir. At just 16, Edmond went to Milan to learn the banking business and then on to Brazil, where he set up his first bank at the age of 21. </p> <p>In contrast to most banks, Safra's was built on deposits rather than loans. It may be this strategy that originally led some observers to view Safra's banks as attractive propositions for money launderers. Five years ago, New York magazine ran an investigation into Safra's Republic National Bank in which it claimed that the bank 'quickly became known on the street as a bank that would send an armoured car to pick up large sums from its more secretive customers'. </p> <p>In the 80s, Safra and Republic were the targets of a global whispering campaign. Among the allegations that surfaced in a variety of mostly obscure publications was the suggestion that he was involved in the Iran-Contra affair; that he arranged the murder of a security specialist who had supposedly discovered a link between him and the arms-for-hostages scandal; that he had double-crossed the Medellin cocaine cartel; that he was a confr\u00e8re of mafia legend Mayer Lansky; and that Republic had laundered the drug-trafficking profits of Panama's General Noriega. </p> <p>Only the last claim had any basis in established fact, and Republic was only one of a number of banks that held Noriega's funds. Eventually, Safra proved in court that the rumours emanated from his corporate rivals, American Express, which had bought Republic's Swiss parent company, TDB, in an acrimonious deal in 1983 (Safra regained control in 1988). American Express was forced to apologise and donate $8m to a number of charities, including the Anti-Defamation League. For many people in and around the world of banking, however, Safra's legal victory served only to increase their suspicions of the secretive Lebanese businessman. In New York and London it was customary to grin in a knowing fashion whenever Safra's name was mentioned. Now the grins were that much wider. </p> <p>Bryan Burrough ascribed the slurs aimed at Safra to anti-Semitism in his book Vendetta: American Express and the Smearing of Edmond Safra . But if anti-Semitism alone was the reason for the stories, then why was Safra singled out and not the innumerable other Jewish bankers operating in high finance? It would be rather as if Michael Jordan had been selected for racist abuse on account of being a black player in basketball. Whatever the true explanation for the attacks, Safra was acutely sensitive to their effect on his good name. He was determined to sue any publication, however small, that repeated the libels. </p> <p>While American Express was waging its smear campaign, American customs officers were investigating Safra's banks for laundering Colombian drug funds. No charges were brought. Yet when the news emerged that Safra was dead, the prime suspects were not embittered former American Express executives or Colombian drug lords, but the Russian mafia, or mafiya . </p> <p>Three factors pointed in its direction. First, Republic's dealings with Russia were well documented. Under licence from the US government, Republic shipped around $10bn of US currency a year to Russian banks. Although perfectly legal, the shipments caused no little consternation among some state agencies. The problem was that many banks in Russia, and up to 50 that Republic was trading currency with, were suspected of being at the very least unreliable and quite possibly fronts for the mafiya. Referring to this apparent criminalisation of cash, a source from the Criminal Investi gation Bureau of New York State Banking Department told New York magazine: 'To us it was like a sore on Cindy Crawford's face.' </p> <p>Second, at the time of his death, Safra was engaged in the protracted and problematic sale of Republic to HSBC. There were various hold-ups, but one of them was said to be the Russian accounts that were frozen as a result of Federal investigation into money laundering, which Republic itself prompted by alerting the authorities to its concerns. Observers speedily concluded that a short-changed mafiya chief had sought revenge. Some 90 or so bankers have been killed in Russia since the collapse of the Soviet Union. 'What you have to understand,' Stephen Handelman, an expert on the mafiya and author of Comrade Criminal , told me, 'is that bankers are different in Russia. Over 2,000 banks were set up after 1989, most of which have since collapsed, and many of the people behind them had emerged from the black market and criminal backgrounds. So often when a banker is killed he may himself be involved in the mafiya.' </p> <p>And third, the French Riviera, which enjoys a rich history of Russian influence dating back to 19th-century aristocrats, had seen a sudden and ostentatious influx of newly wealthy Russians. Tales of Moscow businessmen buying yachts and property for cash formed the gossip of sales people from Cannes up to Menton, who, while often offended, seldom refused the money. In Nice, the mafiya was said to have bought into the exclusive Marina Baie des Anges, where the head of one Russian crime gang was arrested with false papers and fled to Monaco. In the past three years, Monaco has itself expelled 15 Russians suspected of illegal business practices, including a former KGB colonel. And some lawyers say that Monaco has now adopted an unofficial policy of refusing entry to all Russians. </p> <p>Arnaud Montauibourg, a French MP who led a parliamentary investigation into the mafiya, thinks the mafiya has already 'penetrated Monaco', laundering money 'through real estate, the casino and through trusts'. Sitting outside the Caf\u00e9 de Paris in Monte Carlo on a soft autumn evening earlier this month, watching the hopefuls making their way to the casino, it was not hard to spot the Russian businessmen. They have little apparent fear of cultural stereotyping. Thus two men with gold bracelets and neck chains sat drinking vodka and smoking weighty cigars, largely ignoring their two women companions whose compliant demeanour, polite laughter and visible stocking garters made it plain that they were part of the night's entertainment bill. </p> <p>It's this kind of egregious behaviour that has placed the Russians, whether legitimate business people or not, at the centre of a near moral panic hereabouts. The Russians are coming, is the anxious chorus on the Cte d'Azur, and everyone assumed they had come for Safra. </p> <p> At 5am on the morning of 3 December last </p> <p> year, Ted Maher awoke his boss with news that two masked men had broken into the belle \u00e9poque building at 17 Avenue D'Ostende in Monaco. Maher was bleeding from three stab wounds. Although a former Green Beret, Maher had served as a medical auxiliary. He had no more experience of combat than he did of high-style living. He was there to tend his employer, not protect him. For that, Safra had his Israeli army bodyguards. But not in Monaco. So safe did he feel in his penthouse next to the renowned Hotel Hermitage, that he maintained the security team at La Leopolda, 10 miles away. </p> <p>It was there during the 80s that Safra, under the guidance of his Brazilian socialite wife, held celebrity-enriched parties of daunting splendour. Lily, whom Safra married in 1976, had three children from a previous marriage and was independently a very rich woman. Nevertheless, the prenuptial agreement she signed was said to have run to 600 pages. It was she who ensured that names such as Aristotle Onassis and Frank Sinatra were included on the Safras' guest list. John Fairchild, the arbiter of American high-society standing, was moved to speak of the couple's 'meteoric rise to social power'. </p> <p>But social acceptance had not lessened Safra's near-phobic paranoia. He always carried blue gemstones to ward off the evil eye, and retained an abiding fear of curses. He was deeply superstitious about the number five and was terrified of being kidnapped. So he must have been deeply scared early that morning when he learned from Maher that the state-of-the-art security system in the building, which also housed three banks, had been breached. Immediately, Safra retreated with another of his nurses, 52-year-old Viviane Torrente, to his steel-reinforced bathroom. </p> <p>Within minutes a fire broke out. This is how Monaco's assistant prosecutor Catherine Le Lay described the scene: 'The apartment is immense, and within it there are two separate wings, one for Mr Safra and one for his wife. Mr Safra was in his wing, which consisted of three rooms - his bedroom, a nursing laboratory and a bathroom. With him were two nurses. The police received a call from the receptionist of the building. She had been alerted by the male nurse, who had staggered from the apartment which occupies the fifth and sixth floors, down to the ground floor. He had been injured with a knife with a six-inch blade. </p> <p>'The police arrived at the scene extremely quickly and when they arrived they were un able immediately to access the apartment, which is protected by steel-reinforced doors. When they did gain entry with the firemen, the fire had already taken hold in the flat, which was extremely difficult to bring under control. When the police were finally able to penetrate the flat, they found Mr Safra dead where he had taken refuge in the bathroom with his nurse, Viviane Torrente, who also died. </p> <p>'His wife was not even roused by the drama. It is difficult to convey just how big this flat is, but I have never seen anything like it. She was separated by a good distance from her husband and each door was reinforced. By the time the firemen had mastered the fire, smoke was only beginning to affect her wing of the flat, which would have rendered her more deeply unconscious. We still don't know how the attackers got into the flat, or how they escaped.' </p> <p>Safra and Torrente died from smoke inhalation. The fumes reached them through the fire-detection system. With its 500 officers, Monaco is probably the most intensively policed square mile anywhere on the planet - the local constabulary likes to boast that it can close down all exit routes from the principality in minutes. Its border with France is only notional, but the police always man it. Its streets and buildings are also the world's most intensively filmed. </p> <p>Very few square feet remain unrecorded by the ubiquitous security cameras. But there was no sign of the intruders. The idea that two men could break into the heavily secured home of one of the world's wealthiest men, cause his death and leave without trace did not sit well with Monaco's reputation as a crime-free zone for the super-rich. </p> <p>The police became convinced that it was an inside job. Within two days of Safra's death, Maher was arrested. And, shortly afterwards, he told police that he had stabbed himself and started a fire and that there were no intruders, masked or otherwise. His actions, he said, were an attempt to gain his boss's respect. He spoke of not getting along with the head nurse, a woman named Sonia, and how he wished to circumvent her power by demonstrating his loyalty to Safra. At a news conference, chief prosecutor Daniel Serdet quoted from Maher's police statement: 'It was my own dark ideas which led me to do this.' </p> <p>This was an extraordinary turnaround. From a story of high-financial corruption and international gangsterism, it became one of a misguided approach to job promotion. Police announced Maher's confession on 6 December, the same day that Safra was buried in Geneva. Around 1,000 mourners attended the ceremony at the Hekhal Haness synagogue, including the Nobel Peace laureate Eli Wiesel, Israel's foreign minister David Levy, Prince Sadruddin Aga Khan and former United Nations secretary general, Javier P\u00e9rez de Cu\u00e9llar. Also, on the same day, the US Federal Reserve approved the sale of Republic to HSBC Holdings, and four weeks to the day after Safra's death the $9.85bn deal was completed, netting Safra's heirs some $2.8bn. Could it really be that strange and that straightforward? </p> <p> In America, the conspiracy theorists' medium, the internet, has been hot with indignation. There is much talk of Maher's 'imprisonment as a scapegoat for Russian money- launderers' and he is referred to as 'prisoner of war'. 'Please help him,' runs one appeal, 'before he is killed by the Monaco government or the responsible parties that did commit this crime and used Ted as a scapegoat.' Much of the stuff is hysterically xenophobic, virulently right-wing and clearly the work of delusional minds. Of course, that doesn't mean that Maher isn't a fall guy. However, his defence team certainly do not see Maher as the victim of a fiendish plot. </p> <p>Georges Blot, Maher's Monegasque lawyer, has gone on record as saying that his client started the fire and stabbed himself. 'The first words Ted said to me when I met him were: \"This is horrible. I loved him. I admired him. I respected him. I don't understand why I did it.\"' </p> <p>Maher's family in the US are unimpressed. They say that the internal security videotapes, which they believe would prove Maher's innocence, have gone missing (Monaco police say the video system was not working). And Maher's wife Heidi, argues that her husband's legal defence is compromised because it is state-appointed. 'The Monaco government is paying Ted's lawyer, Mr Blot, which is clearly a conflict of interest,' she has said. In fact, that is common legal practice, and indeed a human right, in most countries on occasions when the accused cannot afford a lawyer. Yet while Monaco is not implicated in a cover-up, there is a sense that it is actively presenting an untroubled face to the world. </p> <p>This is not the first time that a banker's death has caused a scandal in the region. Back in 1990, Jean Ferry, an official of the Industrial Bank of Monaco (BIM), was found dead from a bullet wound in the head. The police decided it was suicide, but a subsequent investigation found that a client of Ferry had constructed a large-scale fraud involving BIM. It also discovered that lax practices encouraging foreign tax evasion were endemic within the Monaco banking system. The most common method exploited a law which enabled foreign investors to create 'shell' companies in the names of Monegasque citizens (for a small payment). It has often been alleged that the system is abused by organised crime. </p> <p>Roger Bianchini, a journalist with Nice-Matin , told an author of a book on the Grimaldis: 'The whole system is well known to the initiated. But when underground deals begin to surface and scandal breaks through, Prince Rainier becomes concerned that the image of the principality could be tarnished.' </p> <p>As with other wealthy climes, such as Beverly Hills, the very sheen of Monaco's surface leads the visitor to suspect some form of moral corruption lurking underneath. The old wedding-cake architecture that survives is placed in the shade by the huge apartment-block developments that Rainier green-lighted in the 60s, creating an odd combination of sickly innocence and brash confidence. Although there is a refreshing sea breeze and the streets are neurotically clean, the faintest smell of pollution hangs in the air alongside the sweet fragrance of jasmine. And there is a disturbing sense that no amount of money will wash it away. </p> <p>For all its publicity-seeking glamour, Monaco thrives on secrecy. The government and its institutions, such as the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des Bains de Mer, which runs the casino and hotels and much else, and which are all essentially arms of the Grimaldi empire ruled by Prince Rainier, are unapologetically opaque. Bankers may be attracted to secrecy, but so are storytellers. One of the more fanciful ideas doing the rounds has it that the Grimaldi grip on Monaco includes extensive telephone tapping based on a word-trigger system. 'If you said something derogatory about a Grimaldi it would undoubtedly hit the trigger,' suggests one observer. </p> <p>Against this backdrop of fantasy, any explanation of events provided by Monaco, the so-called Disneyland Dictatorship, would never be seen as the whole story. And indeed there are inconsistencies. Even Safra's widow's lawyer, Marc Bonnant, was concerned to ask that all the evidence be made available. </p> <p>'We would like to have all the details of the nurse's confession. Was it credible and complete, what exactly pushed him to do what he did, how many fires did he set, are there any inconsistencies in his confession? A thousand questions come to mind which need answers to make any sense out of this tragic and absurd death.' </p> <p>Among those questions, perhaps, are why did Safra remain in the bathroom even after the police arrived and why did it take two long hours for the fire brigade to get inside the bathroom? And why is it that Maher is said to have started only one fire and yet investigators located two separate origins? </p> <p>In early official reports it was stated - unambiguously by assistant prosecutor Le Lay - that Lily Safra did not speak to her husband during his confinement in the bathroom, that she was asleep. Elsewhere there were reports that she had spoken to him on a mobile phone. Bonnant told me, 'Edward Safra spoke twice to his wife, to his bodyguard and to the police.' Then why did he not emerge from the bathroom? Bonnant says that everyone was still under the impression that two armed intruders were in the building, which is also why the fire brigade made slow progress. </p> <p>But given the police presence and his own security guard, Safra must have been paralysed with fear not to feel confident enough to come out. Who did he think was after him? Bonnant is quick to scotch any talk of assassins. 'Look, if you want to kill a man, you pay $20,000 and you get the job done the right way by a professional. The right way is not to hire a nurse to start a small fire and hope that the police take two hours to get to him.' An insider on Maher's defence team echoes this point. 'People have told me they know for sure that Safra was shot with two bullets. Now the defence is going to see the inside of the building and we've asked for further fire reports and to look at video film outside the home. It might be that we'll see two guys in balaclavas on top of the roof, but I don't think so. And you have to ask, why were there no holes in Ted's clothes where his wounds were? Did the intruders thoughtfully lift up his shirt before stabbing him?' </p> <p>Handelman also dismissed the idea that Russians were behind Safra's death. 'It just wasn't their MO. Not outside Russia. Most people thought Safra was holding IOUs or money for the mafiya, but they wouldn't have killed him for that.' But he added: 'You can always be surprised.' </p> <p> After Maher's confession was made public, people began to ask how Safra had ever come to employ a man with such evident psychological problems. Suddenly it was common knowledge that Maher had a prescription-drug problem - according to Serdet - a history of violence and unstable personality traits. His colleagues at Columbia-Presbyterian countered these stories and provided an image of a reliable and motivated worker. 'He was really on top of things,' said one paediatrician. 'In fact, he was one of the better nurses I've seen.' </p> <p>Bonnant has said that Maher was properly vetted through 'in-depth background checks', as well as being interviewed by Safra himself. 'The fact that Maher is unstable became apparent to us only after the accident. Nothing in Maher's files showed the slightest trace of mental instability.' Perhaps because it wasn't there. </p> <p>Some newspaper articles quoted a former neighbour who quarrelled with Maher. 'He was a miserable bastard,' said 70-year- old Leonard Levelle, who accused Maher of physical assault. According to Maher's defence, Levelle himself was cautioned a number of times by the police. Much was also made of Mayer's leaving the Las Vegas police force after only three months. His defence say he quit because he contracted spinal meningitis. </p> <p>So was it a bizarre aberration? 'The reality of the situation is not something Ted can articulate,' say his defence. But the same source believed Maher was under pressure because his wife wanted him to return home and he wanted to stay in Monaco. </p> <p>What even his detractors agree on is that Maher never intended to kill Safra. 'If he wanted to,' said Serdet, 'he would have had 10,000 chances a day.' The fire simply got out of hand because he started it in an acrylic wastepaper basket. However, Maher is currently charged on a count of arson leading to death, a crime which carries a maximum life sentence. </p> <p>In his Monte Carlo office, high above the Boulevard des Moulins, Donald Manasse, an American-Frenchman who is assisting Georges Blot, told me, 'Ted is not guilty of the crimes as charged and we are seeking a requalification of the charges.' </p> <p>Optimistically, he might be looking at four to six years. But that's still a very severe sentence for what basically amounts to an accident. Bonnant demonstrated the Safra family's determination to gain what they see as justice. He told me: 'We want to ensure that the one who caused this will be properly punished.' </p> <p>The trial is unlikely to come to court until early next year. The investigating judge, Patricia Richett is still conducting her inquiry. Given the profile and importance of Safra, and the sensitivity of the Monaco authorities, fears have been expressed by those close to Maher that the investigation might be partial. Manasse was certain that Richett would not succumb to external pressure from any direction. 'Anyone who would say she could be influenced by third parties,' he told me, 'has no idea who she is.' </p> <p>Maher, it seems, does have one influential supporter himself. Dominic Dunne, the celebrated Vanity Fair writer and crusader against criminal injustice, is known to be sympathetic towards his plight. And the Monegasques have taken due notice. 'When Serdet heard that Dunne was arriving in Monaco,' a legal source said, 'he was practically saying, \"We've got to get this right, Dominic Dunne is coming to town.\"' </p> <p>In the meantime, Maher, the man who wanted to gain attention, is locked up in a prison that dare not speak its name, removed from his Mediterranean idyll, but tantalisingly trapped a few feet from the sea. He has no visitors, save his lawyers and the American consulate representative, and of course the tourists passing unknowingly by on their way to see a different Monte Carlo story. </p> <p>Life in Monaco continues as ever in its own secretive way. On a brilliant morning with seagulls circling overhead and the roar of the Monaco Kart Cup ripping around the bay, I stopped outside 17 Avenue D'Ostende. The fire damage is now mostly repaired, and just to be certain, I asked a policeman where Monsieur Safra had lived. He looked at me with a thin smile and said, ' Je ne sais pas.' Then he walked away. </p> <p>After Safra's burial, Eli Wiesel said of the close friend he often called his brother: 'After all, what remains of a man after his death? It is his name, his reputation, his honour.' And, a less circumspect man might have added, his money. Already there is talk of family disputes about where it will go. And there will continue to be talk about the banker from Beirut. For if Ted Maher started the fire, there was always smoke around Edmond Safra.</p>",
  "I am fast approaching my 34th birthday, and because I know that we start to develop wrinkles and sagging skin during our thirties, a skin-salvaging regime is high on my list of priorities. Luckily, the women in my family tend to retain a youthful complexion well into their sixties, so the genes seem to be on my side, while smoking - the most skin-damaging of activities, because nicotine adversely affects the delivery of oxygen to the skin cells - has never featured greatly in my life. <p>The skin is widely regarded as a chart of the ageing process, and we spend billions on face creams and supplements that claim to contain the elixir of youthfulness. Yet if we paid more attention to the foods we eat, we could save ourselves a fortune. Physiologically, the skin consists of millions of cells that rely on a regular supply of oxygen and nutrients for their survival, so adverse changes in your general health or the balance of nutrients you quickly start to show in your skin. </p> <p>The skin consists of three layers. The deepest is the subcutaneous layer, which contains the main blood vessels, fat and two types of protein: collagen, which provides the skin with a smooth, firm texture, and elastin, which makes it resilient. The middle layer, the dermis, which contains more blood vessels, hair follicles and sweat glands, protects the subcutaneous layer and supplies the epidermis - the upper layer - with new skin cells. The epidermis is covered in dead skin cells, which are shed and replaced daily. When it comes to anti-ageing strategies, two of the skin's main components to nourish and preserve are collagen and elastin, because wrinkles develop when these protein fibres deteriorate, a process greatly accelerated by exposure to sunlight. </p> <p>The skin's arch enemies are free radicals, unstable molecules that occur naturally in our bodies and are also produced by sunlight, smoke, air pollution and certain foods. Free radicals damage cells and can cause them to behave abnormally, in extreme cases triggering cancerous and other disease-related responses. It is possible to reduce the damage caused by making sure your diet is rich in the foods that limit the effect and by avoiding activities and foods that encourage their production. Among the latter are hydrogenated vegetable oils, found in margarines and ready-made products such as cakes and biscuits. </p> <p>The antioxidant vitamins C and E, selenium, betacarotene and bioflavonoids can protect your skin against free-radical damage by soaking up the rogue molecules. All fruits and vegetables are rich in antioxidants. Although bioflavonoids are particularly concentrated in the peel, skin or outer layers of citrus fruits, I recommend that you wash them before eating them, in order to rid them of waxes and residues. In fact, remember to wash all fresh food before you eat it, as certain waxes and pesticides may increase the body's production of free radicals. </p> <p>Antioxidants are at their highest concentration in produce that has been freshly picked and cooked for only a short time. However, shopping for the freshest produce can be hard: we don't know how much time has elapsed since the food was actually picked, and some foods can spend months in cold storage. So try to buy fruit and vegetables that are in season. </p> <p>The freezing process makes time stand still, so enlist the help of your freezer. You could either freeze fresh produce yourself - for instance, bags of green beans or spinach that you've blanched first, or pop some berries in the ice compartment as soon as you've bought them - or buy ready-frozen fruit and vegetables. After they've been defrosted, the concentration of nutrients they contain will be virtually the same as when they were frozen, while ready-frozen produce can contain higher levels of skin-nurturing, antioxidant vitamins than their fresh counterparts. Aim to eat five portions of fresh fruit or vegetables every day, and remember that juices offer a delicious way of downing three or more portions in one go. </p> <p>Keeping fit helps to supply the skin with blood, providing it with both oxygen and nutrients and also clearing it of waste products, which can turn the complexion grey. Cardiovascular exercise generally keeps you looking younger, as do facial exercises that preserve good muscular structure. Yo-yo dieting is the worst thing that you can do, as repeated bouts of weight loss and gain can result in sagging, stretchmarks and wrinkling. Creams can't protect you from stretchmarks, but losing weight gradually - say, a kilogram a week - allows the skin to shrink and stretch gently. </p> <p>Finally, because lack of water is one of the most common causes of unhealthy-looking skin, aim to drink 2.5l of water a day and keep alcohol and caffeine intake down. Keeping a glass of water by the radiator when the central heating is blasting out dehydrating heat will moisten the air, and thus also your skin, as will using moisturising lotions. Water not only keeps the skin hydrated, but enables the body to glean all of food's skin-preserving, free-radical-fighting, antioxidant nutrients.</p> <p>\u0095 Jane Clarke is a state-registered dietician and author of the Bodyfoods series of books.</p>",
  "<p>When I was in my early teens, I used to tape the Top 40, every week, every record, from 40 up to Number One. No editing required: ELO, Bucks Fizz, The Kids From Fame sat alongside The Jam, The Clash, John Lennon, and I thought of them all the same. They were just music, the soundtrack to the hopes and obsessions and unspecific hatred of teenage life. When I got a babysitting job and started buying records, I progressed into making compilation tapes: these too, were a mishmash of quality and dross. My brother and I didn't have enough records of our own to fill a 90-minute tape, so my parents' collection - Frank Sinatra, Petula Clark, Burt Bacharach, Bobbie Gentry - was raided to make up numbers. (Taping was a tricky business in the DIY days of the 80s. We had one of those flat-box tape recorders whose microphone registered - fuzzily - every noise within a 4ft radius. You positioned it as close to the record player as you could, put the needle on the 45, pressed down Play and Record and hoped that your mum wouldn't start hoovering in the next three-and-a-half minutes.) </p> <p>It wasn't until a bit later that I realised that What Music Do You Like was a loaded question: that it meant What Kind Of Person Are You, Really, Inside, and that there were right and wrong answers. Right: New Order, Aretha Franklin, The Fall, Sam Cooke. Wrong: Howard Jones. So I began editing my still-meagre record collection, taping from friends', listening to John Peel, going to clubs, acquiring knowledge and taste and a personal soundtrack that hinted at an intriguing, seductive inner life. 'Ooh, you like Prefab Sprout and Public Enemy! Sensitive yet punchy! A bedwetter with an attitude problem! Care for a shag?' </p> <p>Such musical - and therefore personal - revision isn't uncommon. There are those who love to recall their Quadrophenia Road to Damascus but not the years they spent listening to mullet-headed cock rock. And you'll never get a 'serious' musician admitting that the first record he ever bought was Bat Out of Hell. We all want to think that we're smart, and have always been so. We strive to learn discernment, to acquire good taste. Yet bad taste will always haunt you. You wake up humming Sonique, you find your foot tapping to Johnny Hates Jazz. Failing memory may mean that you can't recall the name of the shadow trade and industry secretary, nor, indeed, your beloved's birthday. But you will forever know all the words to 'The Pi\u00f1a Colada Song'. And you never even bought the record. </p> <p>It's music's dreadful ability to dole out Tiger balm for the soul and candyfloss for the mind that has made all those 70s, 80s and 90s Saturday-night telly Top 10s so popular. Essentially, such programmes are just compilation tapes without the aren't-I-clever reworking of hindsight. So you have to sit through Sheena Easton to get to David Bowie, Vanilla Ice to get to Happy Mondays. And you are appalled, and then inspired, because now you can see how great 'Ashes to Ashes' was and you actually understand the words to 'Too Much, Too Young' and you wiggle on the sofa in wonder at 'Kinky Afro' and you finally realise that 'Dance Yourself Dizzy' was utter cack. Yet you can't help singing along. Why is that? </p> <p>Music is a soul shorthand in a way that books and films and art can never be. It comes closest to expressing our inarticulate yearnings; it provides us with fallible, reachable heroes; it's utterly accessible, a globe-trotting artform that floods our lives simply when we switch on a radio or walk into a bar. You don't have to pay a gallery entrance fee or lock yourself away to read in order to change your world with music. You can be moved to tears whilst doing the washing up. Music is one of the true joys of existence. And maybe bad music is part of that joy. Trite lyrics and predictable tunes provide us with easy comfort, a hug in times of uncertainty, a sugar-rush when it seems too much effort to get out of bed. Descending basslines seem to know where they're going, as Stephen Duffy once said. </p> <p>But still, bad music, as well as sticking in your mind, doesn't half stick in your craw. The other day I was at a so-cool-my-trousers-hurt London warehouse party: it was great, except for the music. The DJ had a severe attack of the ironies. He played Van Halen's 'Jump', and that was as good as it got. The day after, I went to Nottingham, and visited a straightforward good-time night club. A pack of loafer-shod lads sang along to Britney Spears and S Club 7. They knew all the words to 'Reaching for the Stars' and sang them with their arms draped around each other. And part of me thought it was horrible and part of me thought it was sweet. At least they were expressing their love for one another. But I'd have preferred it if they'd done it to Randy Newman. Or Craig David, at least. </p> <p>Mind you, the day after that, I met a man who said: 'I don't really like music.' Now that's enough to make you run screaming for comfort to the Let Loose Appreciation Society.</p> <p>\u0095 Barbara Ellen returns in two weeks</p>",
  "<p>Dr Linda Patterson has a dozen or so champagne bottles in her kitchen waiting to be drunk, a souvenir of a summer holiday spent this year travelling through the Champagne region of eastern France. Far from representing an opportunity for celebration, however, the bottles are simply the cause of a credit card headache. </p> <p>Having taken the guided tour around Mo\u00ebt and Chandon's famous champagne cellars, Linda Patterson, an NHS consultant, decided also to drop in for a degustation at one of the many small family-run champagne establishments near Epernay. </p> <p>She and her partner got a warm welcome from the husband and wife who greeted them. 'We went into a little courtyard with a table, and were brought glasses from a number of different bottles to try. I decided to buy six full bottles and six half bottles,' she says. </p> <p>As well as providing a very pleasant memento of the holiday, buying direct seemed to make good financial sense: the full bottles cost 74 francs (or about \u00a37.40) and the half-bottles 40 francs. 'We were quite pleased. It was a lot less expensive than the prices being charged at Mo\u00ebt,' Patterson says. </p> <p>However, when the credit card statement arrived after the holiday they got a shock. The total came not to about \u00a365 but \u00a3417.24. The bottles in her kitchen had effectively cost her about \u00a345 each. </p> <p>Dr Patterson had been the victim of a problem that affected other English holidaymakers in France this summer. Instead of the transaction being processed in francs, it had been put through as a payment made in euros. With the euro currently worth about 70p, this meant that the total was seven times greater than it should have been. </p> <p>French bills and receipts are now usually denominated in both currencies, and Visa says that a number of cases have come to light where credit card payments have come through in the wrong currency. According to a Visa spokeswoman, the problem seems to be retailer confusion rather than fraud. 'We have an obvious concern about this issue, and we're trying to find out if there are retailers who are trying it on. But there's no record of this sort of thing going on regularly,' she said. </p> <p>Dr Patterson hopes that her experience was simply the result of an error. 'I want to think that the couple who sold us the champagne made an honest mistake. They seemed very nice, and waved us off with a friendly \"Bon voyage\". But, obviously, it could be a pretty good wheeze,' she says. Her own credit card company, the Co- operative Bank, is formally investigating the transaction through Visa's disputed payments mechanism, following the payment chain, through Visa International and the French merchant processor to the champagne sellers. The Co-op says this process can take 60 days or longer. </p> <p>Although disputed payments should not incur penalties, Dr Patterson's most recent Visa statement does show interest added for late payment. This adds to the overall feeling of pressure, she says. </p> <p>She is fortunate in that she still has an original price list showing the prices for the champagne she bought clearly denominated in francs. But her experience should remind other visitors to France (and to the other 10 countries that have adopted the euro) of the importance of checking the currency in which credit card bills are written and of keeping receipts. </p> <p>Worryingly, Barclaycard, Britain's largest credit card issuer, warns that the onus is on customers to ensure they do not find themselves paying more than they should.</p>",
  "<p><strong> Book of Shadows: Blair Witch 2</strong> (90mins, 18) Directed by Joe Berlinger; starring Kim Director, Jeffrey Donovan <br><strong> It Was an Accident </strong> (100mins, 18) Directed by Metin H\u00fcseyin; starring Max Beesley, Thandie Newton <br><strong> I Could Read the Sky</strong> (86 mins, 15) Directed by Nichola Bruce; starring Dermot Healy </p> <p> Sometimes, one and one don't make two. <strong> Book of Shadows: Blair Witch 2</strong>, has next to nothing of the Project that set cash registers ringing. Not the same cast, the same director, the same style or any continuation - if that were possible - of the same story. This is tosh of an altogether lower order. There isn't even, since you ask, a book of shadows. </p> <p>Forget the artful triumph of what we must now call Blair Witch 1, the hand-held cameras which followed three students into the woods of Black Hills, Maryland, and, half-way between documentary and drama, appeared to chronicle their vanishing, victims of a phantom we never saw. If that was docuhorror, this is schlocku-horror. </p> <p>It doesn't start like that. Joe Berlinger, who specialises in filming real murder mysteries, has had the bright notion of taking the actual fame that the Project brought to the village of Burkittsville and sending five more potential victims into the woods on a kind of idiotic guided tour. Cue in two minutes or so of genuinely funny cod interviews with local residents. Hope rises.There weren't many jokes in BW1. Hope falls. The quintet are standard freaks for the teenage market. They reach the house at the heart of darkness, they come out intact: but then, in the old warehouse which Jeffrey Donovan, their loopy tour guide uses as his Blair Witch mail shop, the curse of the Black Hills catches up with them. Standard freaks, standard mayhem. </p> <p>Where the chill of the original came from not knowing, not seeing, Berlinger jolts the screen with blood and guts. Where the sparse, $30,000 production values of BW1 were integral to its queasy credibility, here cash and computer effects rule this dotty roost. </p> <p>Our unfortunate five give us nothing to identify with. Donovan's Jeff is fresh out of an asylum, but nothing's ultimately made of his supreme flakiness. Kim Director wears white pancake make-up straight out of The Munsters and has the occasional gift of prophesy, except where her own fate's concerned; Erica Leerhsen is a student witch much given to hopping round in the nude; Tristan Skyler and Stephen Barker are dopey young lovers. None of them is going to win an Oscar. When Donovan protests out loud that 'I don't understand this' the audience gurgles with instant derision. </p> <p>Still, it will doubtless make a few million - and deserve to, not entirely for its effrontery. Berlinger knows how to keep the action zipping along. Arch references to movies past and present are scattered liberally. If BW1 hadn't existed, BW2 might have passed muster in the Saturday night stalls. Go expecting to be kept awake, but not to be amazed or chilled. </p> <p>So to two films from closer to home, both derived from successful novels, both blessed with an Arts Council grant. Why are the financial arbiters of culture favouring <strong> It Was an Accident</strong>? Does somebody up there in Great Peter Street think that British film is perishing for lack of London gangster movies? They might as well erect a statue of Ray Winstone in Trafalgar Square. </p> <p>To be fair, this Accident, contrived by Ol Parker from Jeremy Cameron's book, has some promising things going for it. Belly laughs for a start; a Runyonesque version of Walthamstow street life for another. Nicky Burkett, played by Chjwetel Ejiofor, is back on those streets after four years in the slammer. </p> <p>He wants to go straight and shack up with a policeman's daughter (Thandie Newton), but villains keep getting in his way. There's Mickey Cousins (Max Beesley), your original blond idiot; there's Rameez (Sidh Solanki), your Asian Mr Big; there's Fitch (James Bolam), who 'used to drive for the Krays'. </p> <p>The first half bowls along nicely, full of neat touches. The cops, save for Newton's thoughtful black dad (Hugh Quarshie), are Keystone galumphers. Ejiofor, of course, has a wonderfully lippy kid by a discarded partner. The dodgy flats, motors and market tradesmen combine to make this Walthamstow a fun place to be. Metin H\u00fcseyin (from Common as Muck ) knows how to stage comic setpieces. Where does it all go wrong? Pacing, tone, language. </p> <p>You can't keep going as fast as this without a break. What works for a TV sitcom doesn't work for a film three times as long. The haste becomes frenetic, and thus disjunct. And this is a Brit gangster effort (without Sadie Frost for once) so, naturally, it can't be all laughs, can it? You have to have a bit of - you know - thumping and shooting and smashing. Bring on the gratuitous violence. Exit the light touch. </p> <p>Language? I should effing say so, every effing 15 seconds. It ain't a matter of prudery, mate, it just gets effing boring in the effing end. </p> <p>The great unresolved question is how Thandie Newton, luminously svelte in Mission Impossible 2 , here turns up as Ehofor's relatively chaste bit of fluff in an anorak, but her very presence makes the wider point. Newton is a considerable actress who can play a human being (among many other things). Ol Parker's script gives here little to do but frown and look disapproving. That's not an accident - it's an effing waste of effing talent. </p> <p>Those who like their art with a capital C, as in Council, will find <strong> I Could Read the Sky </strong> more their evocative fix. It's an adaptation, by Nichola Bruce, of the 'photo-novel' by Timothy O'Grady and Steve Pyke which was Gerry Adams's best book of 1997. Dermot Healy, the distinguished Irish novelist, has the central acting role. He is old, creaky Irish labourer, and he lives in a London garret, shuffling the bare boards, remembering. </p> <p>He remembers the white-washed cottage in the green fields of home. He remembers his mum and dad and the poverty that forced him to come, with thousands of others, to the building sites of England. He remembers the wife who died and the mate who died sleeping in a giant sewage pipe and his mother who died, black with cancer when they did the post-mortem, and the father whose grave he was left to disinter in the mud and rain. All this with the photos of the book opened out into landscapes and small scenes from the past, performed by Ireland's finest, like Stephen Rea. </p> <p>It is a tour de force from Healy, a ginger, shambling wreck who speaks the almost-poetry with arresting precision. Beautiful words; beautiful music, from Iarla O'Lionaird; beautiful moving pictures from Nichola Bruce. Too beautiful, too relentlessly melancholic? That's the trouble. </p> <p>The photo-novel works so brilliantly because you can linger over O'Grady's prose and set it against Pyke's photographs, choosing your own pace and time, letting the images grows. Contract that into 86 minutes of movie narrative, though, and the obligatory returns to Healy's garret become a bit of chore, without light and shade. You either want to know more or less - and the death of his inevitably beautiful wife (Maria Doyle Kennedy) feels merely gratuitous, one more awful thing piled on top. </p> <p>For all the novelty of its form, we've been here before amid the Irish mists of exile. Somehow, I wanted to be told something new.</p>",
  "<p>Paul Merton loves the way people come up to him and say, 'You look different - oh you've had your hair cut!' as if having his hair cut could explain his great weight loss. As you can see on the new series of Have I Got News For You, he really does look different, no longer puffy and dishevelled but positively svelte, a shimmering vision of elegance almost like - well, not quite like - Angus Deayton. Two years ago he ballooned to a terrifying 17 stone and was frightened by his own passport photograph. So since then he's been eating sensibly and laying off the beer. In the past few months, he's also stopped eating wheat or anything containing gluten because he found it made him lethargic, and the result is that he has lost three stone. </p> <p>Anyway, he looks good - but disconcertingly different to the Paul Merton one knows and loves from television. I was quite worried about meeting him because I always got the impression from Have I Got News (not so much from Room 101) that he could be a bit chippy, sullen, taciturn - I feared it might be a case of me asking ever longer, daffier questions and him giving ever shorter, surlier replies. Whereas in fact he was almost puppyishly friendly, sunny, hello birds, hello trees, and eager to share his enthusiasms, especially his enthusiasm for comedy.</p> <p>He once said, 'I could have been the world's biggest comedy anorak, the most boring man imaginable' and although I wouldn't say boring, there are certain questions such as 'Why do you admire Buster Keaton?' which bring out the inner trainspotter to an alarming degree. As a boy, he used to watch silent comedies on his own projector and analyse every scene, but he's still doing it now - he told me that recently he's bought all the films of Charlie Chaplin on DVD and has been watching them in sequence from the first in 1915 to the last in 1967, tracing the development of his technique.</p> <p>The essential, all-encompassing difference between Paul Merton on telly and Paul Merton in real life is that the real-life version is obviously a happy man. After a rocky couple of years when his marriage to Caroline Quentin broke up, he is now happily settled with his new partner, Sarah Parkinson, and declares: 'We are together for the rest of our lives.' And anyway he is happy because, 'Look, I'm sitting here having lunch in a nice restaurant [the Caprice] on a Monday when I could have been in the civil service office in Tooting - I mean, life is good. And on a day like today when I can see people getting on the tube and I can see their drawn faces and I think, They're going to get into their offices - \"Morning, Lorraine\", \"Morning, Mr Hennessy\" - and that's what they're doing till Friday, I think: Well, just by not having to do that, I'm already ahead of the game.' </p> <p>Last month he and Sarah went on holiday to the Maldives and 'We went to this desert island - they take you there in a boat, and give you a picnic basket and a walkie-talkie - and had a little ceremony between the two of us, with nobody else there. So it was very romantic and we did it at midday on October fifth, so that's 5/10/2000 to make it memorable.' But why not marry properly? 'Oh because Sarah's not keen on the whole church/state thing, and I'm kind of like-minded, really. Why not just two people on a desert island? We got married in nature rather than in church.' </p> <p>Sarah is 38 and the daughter of an actor called Robin Parkinson. She used to be an actress but told Paul particularly to tell me that she no longer wishes to be described as that - she is now a writer-producer. She co-wrote and associate-produced his new film The Suicidal Dog (of which more later), and is also producing a radio series called Catholics in Comedy in which Paul will interview other comedians who were raised as Catholics. (There are surprisingly many of them - Kathy Burke, Julian Clary, Lily Savage, Steve Coogan, Caroline Aherne - quite apart from what he calls 'the Irish contingent'.) Obviously they plan to work together as much as possible. </p> <p>They met in 1995 when Paul Merton and Caroline Quentin were doing a three-month run of The Live Bed Show in London, and Sarah was Caroline's understudy. (She never got to play the role because Caroline was never ill.) At that stage, he says, they were 'just talking'. But then in 1997 his marriage to Quentin broke up. Quentin told me that she was completely shocked and mystified at the time - 'I didn't know my marriage was going wrong till it ended, really.' They had been married seven years since Paul proposed on bended knee by the statue of Eros in Piccadilly Circus and they seemed in many ways a perfect couple. But after Quentin's career took off with Men Behaving Badly, their various work commitments meant they were often apart. When they announced their separation in April 1997, they were hounded by the tabloids for several weeks and The Mirror even sent a pseudo-buyer to their house to photograph their bedroom. Merton is still pretty bitter about all that. He and Quentin have always been careful not to say anything hurtful about each other in interviews, and they are friendly on the rare occasions when they meet. Last year she had a baby by Sam Farmer, a television researcher. </p> <p>Do Paul and Sarah hope to have children? 'Yes, well, we could, we will. We'll have to wait and see really. But I mean - we're doing what we should be doing on a very regular basis, so it's in the lap of the gods! And yes, I could have a child now, because I'm financially secure for the foreseeable future and I don't have expensive tastes anyway. If it had happened when I was 23, 24 it would have been a disaster because I'd have had to give up doing comedy, or attempting to do comedy. But now - yes, maybe.' And Sarah would like children, too? 'Yes - I thought she should get involved at some stage, and the planning stage seemed a good stage to begin!' </p> <p> Paul and Sarah live in considerable style in a listed Georgian house in Parson's Green, Fulham, where he says nobody recognises him 'because they're all too posh to watch television - the only people who recognise me are van drivers passing through'. It is actually less than a mile from where he was born 43 years ago, but Fulham has come up in the world, as has he. His father was a tube train driver, his mother a nurse, and they lived in a council flat. He was very shy as a boy but hooked on comedy from an early age. He thinks the two are connected - he says most comedians are shy. 'I was never one to go up to someone as a five- or six-year-old and say, \"Hello, my name's Paul, will you be my friend?\" But I found if I did an impression of the PE teacher or whatever and people laughed, then they did like me, and so then they started talking to me, rather than me making the initial overture and then maybe being rebuffed. They come to you already happy, you know?' </p> <p>Even as a small child, he really studied comedy. He would watch Sunday at the London Palladium and ignore the singers and dancers but 'If a comic came on - it didn't matter how appalling he was - I would watch, fascinated by the whole process. I got into Laurel and Hardy very early on, Charlie Chaplin, Marx Brothers, the Goons on the radio. Monty Python started when I was about 12, Tony Hancock I loved, and I read PG Wodehouse - I loved comedy in all its forms. I was an avid consumer of comedy. I think there was something in my head whereby I was trying to learn as much as I could about it without actually doing it. I read every book about Buster Keaton and Chaplin to see how they worked - it's all about dedication, tunnel vision, pursuit of perfection, getting the gag right.' </p> <p>But he planned his career slowly, carefully, deliberately, because he didn't want to be famous for five minutes, he wanted to last . His dream is to be like Bob Monkhouse, still working in his seventies. So after school (two A levels), he went to work for the civil service in the Tooting employment office, and wrote scripts in his spare time and sent them off to the BBC. But he eventually realised that they would not buy scripts from unknowns - he had to make his name first as a performer, which meant doing stand up. And he knew he wouldn't have the energy, or perhaps the will, to do that while doing a nine-to-five job. So he left the civil service on 29 February 1980 - he chose the date deliberately so he would remember it - and signed on.</p> <p>'It was a bizarre existence I led in my early twenties - that clich\u00e9 of the comedian who goes out and entertains a roomful of people and then goes home to a lonely bedsit was unbelievably poignant for me because that was exactly what I was doing. I had periods of real loneliness. But it was something I'd chosen to do, it hadn't been imposed on me, so I could never complain. And I didn't have any dependents or anything to worry about other than just living on the dole and doing good gigs, but then coming back and still being on my own.' Did he have girlfriends? 'A couple here and there, but not really. I was never one to do the chasing - I was always very shy - and even if some girl had come up and said hello, I couldn't have said, \"Come back to the bedsit\" - she would have seen it and said goodbye.' </p> <p>He was often depressed - he remembers spending whole days in bed because he couldn't face getting up. 'I always had to battle that thing with confidence - and it took me two years after I left the civil service to get on stage at the Comedy Store. But again, that was partly because I wanted it so much, because to have a great ambition and then find out you're no good at it is potentially quite soul-destroying. So I was postponing or delaying the moment of truth.' But in April 1982 he did his act at the Comedy Store and got a standing ovation and walked all the way home to Streatham in a daze of happiness.</p> <p>Gradually, he built up his bookings and his fees and by 1987 had saved enough to hire a hall and put on his own show at the Edinburgh Festival. It got terrific reviews - but the day after the first night he broke his leg playing football, went to hospital, developed a pulmonary embolism (which almost killed him) and caught hepatitis A, so he was out of work for months. This led to another of his big decisions - he felt he had served his apprenticeship on the comedy circuit, it was time to make the leap into television. He wrote scripts for Julian Clary, appeared on Whose Line Is It Anyway? and in 1989 was commissioned to write his own Paul Merton show for Channel 4.</p> <p>But now again, as when he broke his leg, he wobbled on the brink of success - only this was much more than a wobble. It was a mental illness that put him in the Maudsley psychiatric hospital for six weeks, though even now he yelps when I refer to it as a nervous breakdown and says it was not a nervous breakdown - it was a 'manic episode' caused by a combination of overwork and anti-malaria pills. 'I just think it was a sort of manic excitement, really, because everything was happening and it was going really well. I felt that it was a good thing. Because, apart from just before I went into the Maudsley, I felt good, I felt alive, I felt alert, I was full of energy. It was the people around me who were getting worried - I wasn't too bothered. I thought: I'm achieving everything.'</p> <p>But his friends were worried because he was talking non-stop, almost gibbering, and working 24 hours a day. He suffered what he thought was a heart attack during a run-through of Whose Line Is It Anyway? and they called a doctor, who told him he was hyperventilating and must take some rest. But of course he couldn't rest because he was far too busy. He developed paranoia, thinking that people were talking about him behind his back and that he was being followed everywhere by Freemasons. One day he went to the corner shop and thought everyone was looking at him oddly, and the shopkeeper was reading things about him off his credit card. 'I remember coming out of the shop and running down the side road back to the flat and I had a filmic image of all the curtains twitching.' </p> <p>His girlfriend persuaded him to go to the Maudsley but he discharged himself after a few days because he was desperate to finish writing his Channel 4 series. But then he broke down again and was admitted for six weeks and put on Largactyl. He recalls the embarrassment of going to group therapy sessions with serious schizophrenics and people who had attacked strangers with knives when his only problem, he thought, was that his Channel 4 series had been postponed. He also remembers when one of the fellow patients committed suicide and he volunteered to speak at his funeral but someone shouted something. 'And suddenly I was in stand-up mode. I had to fight the urge to use a putdown, to say, \"Oh I remember when I had my first pint of lager...\" It was a very black comic moment.' </p> <p> But he also remembers the precise moment when he started to get better. It was a Saturday evening, a friend came to visit him and 'What I wanted was for somebody to hug me. But he, being a typical middle-class male, was keeping his distance. And his emotional detachment made me feel even more alone. When he went away, I felt so lonely, I howled, like animals cry.' But that howl of pain was a sort of catharsis, and after that he recovered quickly. Even so, he was reluctant for many years to talk about his stay in the Maudsley. It was only last year, on The South Bank Show, that he fully came clean, and also returned to the Maudsley for the first time, to open a new garden for the patients. He has had no manic episodes since, but has been careful to pace himself and not take on more work than he could handle. </p> <p>Ironically, the Channel 4 series he had literally driven himself mad to write was not a great success. But it hardly mattered because by then Have I Got News For You had started, and made him a star. It is now in its 10th year, and has just shifted to BBC1. One year Merton dropped out and the producers tried various substitutes, whose failure Merton watched with undisguised glee. I said I thought Eddie Izzard was good but Merton corrected me - 'Not bad. His first one was good, second not bad - third one was awful. I'm not being unfair to him, but he was doing the same gags in the third week that he'd done in the second week. But I knew that nobody coming in could immediately pick up and do what I was doing, so I wasn't worried. And I thought me not doing a series would be a good shot in the arm - and it was. I think they missed me a lot, and since then I think we're in the best form we've ever been.' </p> <p>But why is he often so rude to his guests - why does he ignore them so cruelly? He says first, they're not his guests, he has no say in choosing them, he's not even allowed to go into the Have I Got News production office because they say he might see the questions. He only once managed to get his choice of guest on the programme - Spike Milligan - but other times when he's suggested someone he's been overruled. Nor does he have any power of veto - 'I mean, I've sat next to the Hamiltons and I'm no big fan of theirs.' But anyway he says he's not deliberately rude to the guests, or only once, to Teddy Taylor. But he concedes that he might sometimes appear rude. He recently played an old video of Peter Cook on the show and was shocked to see that he never spoke to Cook - 'It looks like I'm being spectacularly rude to him but it's just that, you know, I wanted to kiss him!' </p> <p>He could make a perfectly good living from doing programmes like Have I Got News and Room 101 and Just a Minute (on Radio 4), where he just has to turn up and be funny. Turning up and being funny is no problem for him - he has been doing it since school, he still does it every Sunday at the Comedy Store, where he and Josie Lawrence and friends do a regular improv night, which he says is 'like flying - like jazz, almost'. He is amazed when people say that his Have I Got News jokes must be scripted - 'Nobody's ever given me a joke, I don't need it' - the only preparation he and Hislop get is that they see the headlines and pictures at the run-through half an hour beforehand. </p> <p>But he gets a bit twitchy when people say he is so great on Have I Got News because 'It's just me being a panellist, and I don't think I'm really working at the top of my powers - I just sit there and say something rude about Michael Heseltine and everybody's pleased! It's not quite enough, really. I mean, it's wonderful to be doing a show that's so well paid, and all I have to do is turn up on the Thursday at half five and by 9 o'clock I'm done. And 16 weeks of the year that's all I do and for someone who worked in the civil service, who used to dread going into work on a Monday... So I enjoy Have I Got News and I'm glad people like it, but it's not all I want to do. It's not like making a great film or creating something that has longevity. And that's how I judge comedy, really - will it be funny in 40 years' time?' </p> <p>So now he has made his pitch for longevity - written and directed a short film called The Suicidal Dog which is going out on arthouse release with Chuck and Buck over the next few weeks, and then being shown on BBC2 some time next year. I went to its premiere at the Raindance Festival the other week and it was well received, with plenty of laughs and big applause at the end. The big excitement for film buffs - and for Paul Merton - is that the director of photography is 86-year-old Jack Cardiff, who worked with Powell and Pressburger, with Hitchcock, with Houston (on The African Queen) and photographed Marilyn Monroe in The Prince and the Showgirl.</p> <p>Merton only got him by accident because when Hat Trick, the producers, asked who he wanted as director of photography, he couldn't think of any names apart from Jack Cardiff, whose autobiography he'd read. Luckily Cardiff was a fan of Have I Got News and agreed to do it. But Merton was nervous the first day shooting because 'The crew all knew Jack or knew his reputation and were very very pleased to be working with him, whereas I'm just the bloke off the telly. So for the first few hours they were a bit unsure. And then I contradicted one of Jack's suggestions and there was a sort of hushed moment, everyone waiting to see what would happen, but then he said, \"Yes, that's better, we'll do that.\" He could pull all kinds of rank on you, but he doesn't - he's a great man to work with and I was very lucky to get him.' </p> <p>Also, Merton thinks, he's made a bit of film history, or at least film trivia. Jack Cardiff was a child actor before he was a cameraman and first appeared in a film aged four. He also appears (just the back of his head, on a train) in Merton's film - 'So that's 82 years between first and last film appearances - who else has had that much longevity? Not Lillian Gish, I don't think. Or Bette Davis. I'd have to look it up, but I think he's got to have some sort of record there.' This is exactly the sort of useless information Merton loves - for someone who only got grade five CSE in maths, he is weirdly hooked on numbers and statistics. </p> <p>His big ambition now is to make more films - hopefully a full-length feature eventually. 'It's like a bug that bites you and gets in your bloodstream. There's something magical about film, it's the ultimate for me, because it's kind of permanent - inasmuch as anything is. When I went to see Buster Keaton when I was about 14 and I came out of the cinema having really laughed at this film which had been made 50 years before, I thought: That's immortality. It's fantastic. And if my film is shown after I'm gone and it gets laughs - it doesn't get any better than that, I don't think. Though obviously I'd prefer to live forever!'</p> <p>\u0095 The Suicidal Dog is released on 10 November</p>",

  "<b>Via Dolorosa </b> is a monologue, ideally to be performed by its author. As the audience arrive, the author is at the side of the stage. When they are all in he begins to speak. <br> People always say that in the west we lead shallow lives. Our lives must be shallow because we live in countries where nobody believes in anything any more. All my life, I've been told \"Western civilisation? An old bitch gone in the teeth.\" And so people say, go to Israel. Because in Israel at least people are fighting. <p>In Israel, they're fighting for something they believe in. Israel is, first and foremost, a cause, the cause being a patch of land, north to south on the eastern shore of the Mediterranean, lying like a small brown anchovy set down on a school atlas, to which the most persecuted people of modern times - perhaps the most persecuted people of all times - after the matchless catastrophe of the Holocaust rushed in the perfectly reasonable belief that they would never be safe until they had a country of their own. \"We appealed to the conscience of the world. The world has no conscience. We have no one but ourselves.\" The fight. The struggle. The historic destiny. The return of the people. The cause: life therefore having a meaning and shape that eludes the rest of us in the endless wash of \"What the hell are we doing here?\" In a single day, says an Israeli friend, he experiences events and emotions that would keep a Swede going for a year. </p> <p> Zionism being a movement with only a short history, and distinguished from other political movements of our time by the fact that it was invented by a playwright. Yes, Theodor Herzl, in 1894 takes a mere three weeks to write his play Das Neue Ghetto, in which the Jewish hero, struck down by his enemy, dies at curtain-fall, his last words ringing out through the darkened theatre: \"I want to get out! Out of the ghetto!\" Nine years later it is the same Herzl who is chairman of the World Zionist Congress when Lord Lansdowne, on behalf of the magnanimous British Empire, is generous enough to offer a small chunk of Uganda as a suitable place for the Jews to \"live and observe their national customs\". Incredibly, a fair number of delegates are hotly in favour - a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush, and Africa, after all, is better than nothing - but the option is finally rejected on the grounds that Uganda does not have the spiritual quality the Jews require. From this moment on, the central argument is foreshadowed. Is this a Biblical mission? Or is Israel to be a secular state? Throughout the 80s, organizations like the Friends of Israel offer to pay for writers to visit their country. Later, my friend Philip Roth goes off his own bat and returns home inspired by his meeting with the settlers, those religious Jews who have turned their whole lives into an act of political defiance by establishing Jewish townships on hitherto Arab land. \"You've got to go, David. You've got to go and see it for yourself. These people are absolute lunatics. They're the maddest people I've ever met in my life. For any writer of fiction, they're the most wonderful material.\" \"But surely,\" I say to Philip, one of America's most gifted comic novelists, \"they're your material, not mine.\" \"Oh no,\" says Philip, \"You have no idea. These people are so crazy there's room enough for all of us.\" </p> <p> On all occasions I refuse. It is only now, it is only 10 years later that I realise, almost without noticing, that for some time my subject as a playwright has been faith. My subject is belief. And so it comes to seem appropriate - no, more than that, it comes to seem urgent - that the 50-year-old British playwright should finally visit the 50-year-old state. The week before, the Israeli novelist, David Grossman, comes to my house in Hampstead. He says that whenever he comes to London, he makes sure to walk on Hampstead Heath. \"I have some sort of mineral reaction to the place I don't get anywhere else in the world. Just to breathe the air makes me feel happy.\" Obscurely, I feel proud when he says this, as if somehow Grossman's happiness in Hampstead reflected credit on me, as if it were part of the glory of happening to be British to be able, rather casually, to offer foreigners the wonderfulness of Hampstead Heath. But \"mineral reaction\"? Grossman has thought so deeply about the problems of Israel and has lived so long with questions from people like me that he can't help wincing at my clumsiness. \"What you call the major problems of Israel can one day be solved. There will be a Palestinian state. When I said this 10 years ago, everyone told me I was crazy. But now in their hearts people know it will happen. There are huge issues. But they are essentially soluble. What is less soluble is the underlying moral question: how does a majority which itself has been historically unloved now deal fairly with an unloved Palestinian minority in their own midst? Are we mature enough, are we courageous enough to internalise the idea of equality?\" I say, surely this has always been the problem at the heart of Zionism. Israel is effectively a religious state. It now admits immigrants of only one faith. Won't it one day have to become a modern country, multi-cultural, like any other? </p> <p> Grossman smiles. \"Yes, but for us that's very difficult. I don't see it the way you do. I don't think you have to be religious to be a Jew. There is no God in my life, and I'm as Jewish as it's possible to be. If you want to understand Israel, look to the six day war. That war changed everything. Myself, I feel we were much more Jewish before 1967. That war destroyed our essential Jewishness, because up till then places and buildings and stones didn't mean anything to us. They weren't important. What mattered to us were ideas. </p> <p> \"Something very profound happened to Israel during the six day war. For the first time we seized land, we took land by conquest, and suddenly the religious Jew saw the Bible not as a historical story, but as a contemporary operations manual. Yes, I want Israelis to have access to the Wailing Wall, but I don't need to own it. Nor do I need to own any of these holy places. It's new this idea. That you have to own things. It's new and it's profoundly un-Jewish.\" On arrival in Tel-Aviv I am rushed down Californian highways in the company of Sigal Cohen, the young and humorous translator who will accompany me wherever I go. I had expected massive security precautions and I boast of the ease with which I have sailed through immigration. \"Yes,\" she says, \"Israel is a very easy country to get into but it's an impossible country to get out of.\" At my nasty western-style downtown hotel, my chief British Council host Keith Lawrence is waiting. He is very thin, like a teddy-boy with tapered trousers and a collarless jacket. Give him a tall, skinny latte and this could be Soho. He is the man who is bringing plays like Shopping and Fucking to Tel-Aviv. He keeps saying Tel-Aviv is sexy and a happening kind of place, especially for a beach bunny, and sometimes he refers, rather unexpectedly, to the 'buzz'. When I try to find out exactly what the buzz consists of, everyone tells me that it has mostly to do with sitting in cafes and fucking. Later somebody tells me that Tel-Aviv is the fucking capital of the world. </p> <p> No chance to observe, because I am off to eat baked sea-bream, in a stunning waterside restaurant in the nearby port of Jaffa, at the invitation of the Israeli theatre director Eran Baniel. Eran is a fine-looking man in his early 50s, bearded, articulate, in a black corduroy suit. Now we drink Rothschild's Red Merlot and discuss the profound divisions which have emerged between the secular and religious ways of life. At the foundation of the state, the religious orthodox were guaranteed a special status. Anyone who entered a yeshiva to study the Talmud was exempted from the army, and given a public salary. At the time, there were just 500 students, but by the early 1990s there were over 100,000, says Eran \"effectively living off the state for life\".</p> <p> \"For years,\" says Eran, \"the Jew believed that when the goy persecuted you, it gave you the right to shortchange him. Hence the racial stereotype of the Jew who smiles while he swindles you. Well now we are the goy. Israel is the goy. And the religious orthodox have become the thieving Jew. They go to whoever wants to be prime minister and say, yes, you can have our votes but only if you promise to give us our money. They don't serve in the army. They smile and smile, and rob the country blind.\" </p> <p>Eran, it is clear, is a secular Jew. His life was changed by his famous co-production of Romeo and Juliet. This was presented in the middle of Jerusalem. The Palestinians played the Capulets and the Jews played the Montagues. There were five months of rehearsal, with the Palestinian producer George Ibrahim in charge of the Capulets and with Eran directing the Montagues. The project took eight years to achieve. In this production the Capulets really hated the Montagues. This was not a production about love, but about hate. Neither side needed the rhetoric at the beginning. \"You know that bit,\" says Eran, \"where the two sides line up and sort of say \"Fuck you, Montague\" and \"Fuck you, Capulet\". Well, we cut all that. Because Israelis and Palestinians go straight to the emotion: you pick up a stone and throw it straight away.\" </p> <p> Eran says he never really understood the occupation until he did this job. \"Most Israelis,\" says Eran, \"don't even notice the Palestinians. They don't see them. Have you seen how Israelis drive? They don't drive. They own the road.\" His voice is rising now. \"Have you been to the Palestinian territories? Look how the water is allocated. In the settlements, you have the obscene spectacle of Israelis sitting by their swimming pools while Palestinians carry their drinking water round in jerry cans.\" He uses a phrase I have heard before. \"It's un-Jewish, it's un-Jewish behaviour.\" By chance, a play of mine, Amy's View, is currently rehearsing at the Cameri, one of Israel's foremost theatres. Next morning I kick my way through the litter-strewn streets to meet the cast, who have two hours of questions. At one point I say the play is about how we no longer expect society to validate our beliefs. Our only values are private values. The last line of the play is: \"So. We're alone.\" Israel, I say, may be the worst place in the world to perform the play since here people are still arguing passionately about where their country is heading. Whereas in England Tony Blair represents all things to all men. What does he believe? Nobody knows. What will he do? Whatever is popular. Where is he heading? He never tells us. At once, an Israeli actor interrupts: \"Oh please, please, send us your Tony Blair.\" </p> <p> In fact, theatre is making me impatient because I am longing to get going and spend Sabbath in the Jewish settlement of Sheri Tikva which lies some miles inside the borders of the Palestinian territory. It takes us hours to push our way out of town on a Friday afternoon, in the pre-Sabbath rush, but finally Tel-Aviv falls away, and the road opens out. I think of my Sunday school, Sunday afternoons in a stuffy wooden hall in Bexhill-on-Sea. I look from the window of the car and the pale, stony landscape of dusty hills and olive-groves feels familiar, like a drawing from memory. </p> <p>I have now to be careful, because 10 minutes later a feeling arrives, unbidden. My mind is slipping, I am dreaming, perhaps of Israeli wine and fresh fish, when suddenly, in open country at last, it occurs to me, as I look out the window, that the Jews do not belong here. This thought is so unexpected and of course implicitly so inflammatory that I turn guiltily, blushing, to see whether anyone in the back of the car can tell what I'm thinking. Up till now I have spent time in Tel-Aviv, a town which, on its surface at least, is sophisticated and western, but now I am speeding through a huge land mass - I feel the topography, I feel the land, a great hot continent stretching away to my right, Arab country after Arab country - and for the first time I understand how odd, how egregious Israel must look to the Arab eye. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/extracts/story/0,6761,390205,00.html\">Extract two</a></p>",
  "<p>The notice by the museum entrance said: \"Iranians 500 tumans, Foreigners 5,000.\" Ali, my guide, interpreter and general fixer was asking the unshaven attendant in the kiosk for tickets. </p> <p>\"One Iranian and one foreigner.\" </p> <p>The official looked puzzled. \"Where's the foreigner?\" </p> <p>Ali pointed to me. </p> <p>\"Oh, I thought that was your Iranian grandfather.\" </p> <p>I was wondering whether to be offended by the insult - surely I don't look ancient and decrepit enough to be the grandfather of an overweight 26-year-old - when the ticket-seller addressed me in such fast colloquial Persian that, though my command of the language is better than it has any right to be after 30 years of disuse, I couldn't quite catch his drift. Before I could stop myself, I had cupped my hand to my ear and, in the quavering, piping voice of an old, deaf and stupid grandfather, was asking: \"What? What?\" </p> <p>\"You ... are ... welcome ... Sir,\" the man said very slowly, loudly and patronisingly. \"May ... you ... never ... be ... weary!\" It's a common enough Persian greeting, but he seemed to me to say it more pointedly than necessary. I consoled myself with the thought that I had saved myself 4,500 tumans (about $25) . Over the next 10 days, as we toured the country in Ali's clapped-out Fiat, playing the Iranian grandfather was to save me a lot more money, as well as getting me into the kind of cheap lodging-house that wasn't willing to take foreigners. This was lucky, since I was visiting the country at a time of year when most decent hotels are full. </p> <p>Having come to Iran to look at pre-Islamic sites for a book about the ancient Persian prophet Zoroaster, I particularly wanted to witness the Persian New Year celebrations, still strongly Zoroastrian in tone in spite of nearly 1,300 years of Islam. This is the most popular holiday of the Iranian year and the Lonely Planet Guide suggested that it was not the best time for a visit: \"You should seriously consider avoiding Iran altogether for about 10 days before and after Noruz, the chaotic Iranian New Year, which starts on or about 21st March.\" </p> <p>Ignoring this advice, my plan was to spend 10 days driving in a great circle around the country. Iran is a difficult country to travel in. Neither trains nor planes seem to serve the most sought-after destinations, and I had no idea of the condition of the roads. It was going to be touch and go whether I would make it back to Tehran in time for my return flight and my daughter's birthday back home. </p> <p>The start was inauspicious. Daylight-saving time began the day I arrived, and I dutifully set my watch forward. The next morning we were to set off at six, but Ali was more than an hour late. He laughed when I pointed to the clock on the hotel lobby wall. \"We don't work for the government,\" he protested. \"And the Mullahs don't control the sun.\" </p> <p>Nor, it seems, the roads. After two hours' playing dodgem through Tehran's insane morning traffic I was genuinely relieved to find myself still alive. No self-respecting Iranian driver will forego overtaking just because another vehicle is coming the other way. Two lanes are expected to accommodate three cars, or even trucks, abreast, even if it means scraping through, hooting like mad, with only inches to spare on either side. </p> <p>Starting out, you can't help holding your breath and gripping the seat, white knuckled, at the hairiest moments. But there is a limit to the number of times you can brace yourself for certain death. In the end you learn to say, with the Iranians, Masha'allah: whatever God wills. </p> <p>Our first, 500-mile drive south through the rolling desert took us to the oasis city of Yazd, with its unique skyline of tall wind towers, designed to catch any faint breaths of breeze and funnel them down into secret retreats at the heart of the huddle of mud-brick houses. We spent the next day visiting Yazd's spectacular mosques, its prison attributed to Alexander the Great and its Zoroastrian fire-temple, packed during Noruz with Iranian tourists craning to catch a sight, through the protective glass, of the sacred fire which has been burning continuously since AD 470, though not in this same place. </p> <p>A few years ago after a great windstorm, Yazdis were amazed to see the top of a dome peek out of the sand just outside town. Much digging exposed an entire buried village, perfectly preserved, complete with a fire-temple of its own. During our visit, a local family party arrived. The father, who seemed to have insider knowledge, was lecturing his wife and daughter about Zoroastrian beliefs in the wildly theatrical style Iranians use when reciting verse - drawling out the long vowels as if eating them, peppering each sentence with sudden loud phrases or unexpectedly ... slowing ... right ... down. I whispered to Ali that this must surely be a schoolteacher by trade. The man heard me and turned on us. </p> <p>\"Were you speaking English?\" </p> <p>Ali confessed. The man pointed at me. </p> <p>\"Is he British? Because there are some things that should not be spoken in front of some people.\" </p> <p>\"Well,\" Ali told him, \"he carries a British passport, but his family came from Czechoslovakia and he himself was born in Vienna.\" </p> <p>The schoolteacher looked at me a little more benignly. \"Then his sins are diminished.\" </p> <p>Afterwards I said to Ali \"I thought it was the Americans who were the Great Satan.\" </p> <p>\"Oh no,\" he explained, \"Iranians believe that the Americans are good people at heart but innocent and na\u00efve. It is always the British who command them to do bad things.\" </p> <p>The first threat to our tight schedule came on my third Iranian night. All hotels in Yazd being full, we were sleeping on the living room floor of a local man's basement flat. Generously hospitable like all Iranians, he brought out a hookah and a brace of bottles of wine for his guests. </p> <p>\"Alcohol? Isn't that against the law?\" </p> <p>\"I don't drink it for enjoyment, only for health,\" he emphasised, as if that made all the difference. \"Anyway, it's not made from grapes, but from pomegranates and honey.\" The first taste confirmed that nobody could drink it for enjoyment. </p> <p>The resulting hangovers delayed our next day's departure south over the mountains until noon, so that it was too dark to see anything by the time we reached Cyrus the Great's tomb at Pasagard and the spectacular remains of Persepolis, the summer capital founded by Darius and burned by Alexander. My executive decision was to press on to Shiraz and return again very early the next morning. </p> <p>Even at 10 o'clock, Shiraz, elegant city of palaces, poets and perfumed gardens, was like a madhouse. All of Iran seemed to have congregated there for Noruz. Festive crowds pressed along the decorated streets, while gaily-dressed wedding parties, the women's black chadors barely concealing their finery, crammed on to the backs of lorries and paraded through the city centre, shouting and hooting and blaring raucous wind instruments. </p> <p>After two hours of fruitless driving around to find a vacant hotel room, Ali regretfully conceded that we would have to make do with a common lodging house. He found the Heavenly Guesthouse near the central glittering Sayyed Mir Ahmad shrine but came out looking gloomy. </p> <p>\"You won't like it,\" he said. </p> <p>I didn't. The tiny room, with space only for a double bed and a washbasin, was so filthy that Ali suggested we avoid undressing. The smell of urine forced us to leave the window open, and rowdy wedding parades outside kept us awake till three. It was no hardship to be up again and ready to leave town at five. </p> <p>Lost time was impossible to make up, however. Though we were back shortly after seven at Cyrus's movingly simple and dignified tomb, the entrance gates to the site were locked and, in spite of my offer of money and Ali's improbable claims of high political influence, a dishevelled and bad-tempered official refused us admission for nearly two hours. </p> <p>Late that night, we were 200 miles behind schedule when exhaustion forced us to stop in a small town on the road, at a guest house which proved to be, if anything, even more awful than the one in Shiraz. </p> <p>In the morning I asked Ali the name of the place. \"I want to be sure never to come here again.\" </p> <p>\"Beh-behan,\" he said. \"Literally, it means 'Used-to-be-better'.\" </p> <p>Driving on that night into the hours of darkness turned our careering descent to the oilfields of Mesopotamia into an awesome light show. Gigantic gas flares sprang from the ground on all sides, painting the entire sky a flickering rose red, as if we were entering the gates of Hell. It was almost a surprise to arrive unscathed in the cool modern urbanity of the great oil town of Ahwaz. </p> <p>Next day, it was an even greater surprise to be thoroughly frisked on leaving the slick shopping mall by the banks of the Karun river, though Ali took the indignity for granted. \"Otherwise people would steal things,\" he said. </p> <p>But even Ali was taken aback when the best hotel in town refused to change my dollars at a respectable rate, on the grounds that some of them were more than a year old. The cashier claimed to be worried. \"Perhaps they are not valid any more.\" </p> <p>I suggested that the day that two-year-old dollar bills went out of date, the world economy might as well close down. \"Why?\" he asked. \"Here we change our money all the time.\" </p> <p>By the time we had reached the nine o'clock position in our 360 degree circumnavigation of the country, we were falling ever more behind schedule. We had to press on far into the night to reach Shush, the site of Susa, one of oldest and longest-lasting of ancient Iran's cities - and one that took the brunt of the enemy onslaught during the Iran-Iraq war. The dusty hill of ruins which was once the biblical Shushan stands opposite the supposed tomb of the Prophet Daniel, the forecourt of which - for the benefit, I suppose, of Jewish pilgrims - is daubed with a huge savage mural, in uncannily Belfast-like style, showing heroic Muslims capturing Jerusalem. Close by is a gruesome blood-and-guts exhibition memorialising the martyrs to Saddam Hussein. </p> <p>Leaving the ancient mound, I was so affected by this combination of ruthlessness and horror that I quite forgot my Iranian grandfather role - until three angry men came running up to stop us in the street. Too late, I realised that I had been speaking English. </p> <p>\"You didn't say you were with a foreigner when you bought tickets,\" their spokesman accused Ali aggressively. </p> <p>\"You didn't ask.\" </p> <p>\"Foreigners must pay 10,000 tumans.\" </p> <p>Ali was squaring up for an argument. \"There is no sign that says so.\" </p> <p>The two others were beginning to look belligerent. I feared they might call the police and that I would never get back to Tehran in time to catch my plane. </p> <p>\"Pay them the money and let's go,\" I said. </p> <p>Ali did, but with ill grace. \"It's $57. You know the money will go straight into their pockets.\" </p> <p>\"But I don't want to miss my daughter's birthday.\" </p> <p>By driving through the night, we somehow managed to visit the carved cliffsides near Kermanshah and the ancient city of Hamadan as planned, and still arrive back in Tehran on the right day. With huge relief I checked in at Mehrabad airport well on time. </p> <p>The check-in clerk looked sombre. \"I am sorry,\" he said. \"Your flight is being diverted via Baku. You are going to miss your connection to London. The airline will pay for your overnight hotel in Dubai.\" </p> <p>I protested, of course. But this time there was absolutely nothing I could do. </p> <p>\u0095 In Search of Zarathustra, Paul Kriwaczek's look at the influence of the ancient Persian prophet on world religions, will be published by Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson in 2001.</p> <p><strong> Visa</strong><br> </p> <p> You can apply for a tourist visa at the Iranian consulate in London (Kensington Court, London W8, tel: 020-7937 5225), for a non-returnable fee of \u00a340.

For a reasonable fee, they will provide all necessary jabs as well as give you a computer printout detailing the latest health news and Foreign Office travel advice. </p> <p><strong> Money</strong><br> </p> <p> Surprisingly, the foreign currency most generally accepted is the US dollar. Mastercard is the preferred plastic. There is a difference between the official exchange rate and that on the street, but changing money unofficially is illegal, risky and not recommended. Banks will do the exchange, but hotels usually give a quicker, easier far less bureaucratic service. The current rate is around 1750 Iranian rials to the dollar, though Iranians themselves calculate in tumans (10 rials). </p> <p><strong> Accommodation</strong><br> </p> <p> Cost varies wildly between about $120 a night at the top end of the scale down to $25 near the bottom. You wouldn't want to stay in a cheaper place. </p> <p><strong> Food</strong><br> </p> <p> Earlier this year, the former Intercontinental Hotel in Tehran, now called the Laleh, was charging $30 for breakfast. On the other hand, you can get a filling meal in a roadside kebab house for under $5. No wine or beer, of course - except for a really horrid local non-alcoholic brew. Non-Muslim foreigners may be allowed to bring a small amount of alcohol into the country for their own use, but the hassle isn't worth it. Tea is the preferred drink in Iran and very good. </p> <p><strong> Travel</strong><br> </p> <p> Buses are extremely cheap. The journey from Tehran in the north to Shiraz in the south, about 550 miles, costs around $2. A car with a driver will cost anything from $25 to $100 a day. But away from his home, you will have to pay for the driver's food and accommodation. </p> <p><strong> Overall cost</strong><br> </p> <p> My 10 days in Iran cost $1,500 overall plus the air fare. It was definitely worth it. </p> <p><strong> Feasibility</strong><br> </p> <p> Forget the TV images of chanting fanatics - that's merely political window-dressing. Iranians are friendly and welcoming, a highly civilised and cultured people with a longer and more distinguished history than almost any other nation - 2,500 years of it. The country is a treasure chest of magnificent architecture and fabulous antiquities. In spite of what one might expect from a theocracy, Iranian Islam is mostly tolerant and Iranian democracy has free and fair elections, though from a limited list. Under normal circumstances, a tourist visit is entirely feasible, even for a woman on her own.</p>",
  "<p>It's 6.45am, and there's a gentle tapping on the door. You might be on holiday, but on Denis Island in the Seychelles it's time to get up and go fishing. </p> <p>On the beach, a dozen yards from the veranda, is Mayjoe, impatient in his Aston Villa shorts. He and the skipper, Etienne, have a lot of fish to catch and they want to get going before the pearly morning light is consumed by the heat of the tropical sun. </p> <p>Three miles from shore, Etienne cuts the engine and Mayjoe helps set up the lines. A weight and five baited hooks are attached to a fine nylon rope. It's tossed overboard, unravelling to a depth of 50m, and secured in your hand. You sit back and wait for a tug on your forefinger. This comes soon and it comes often: fishing in the Indian ocean does not require a huge amount of skill. Bonito, red snapper, parrot fish, capitaine blanc, job fish, groupier, the occasional baby shark - they're all delicious and waiting to be caught. At the end of the day, there is an absurd sense of pride in seeing your fish served for dinner. </p> <p>Denis Island relies on the well-stocked sea surrounding its 2 sq kms to feed its guests. Privately owned, there is nothing on the island apart from the lodge and a farm which supplies it with pork, chickens, eggs, vegetables and fruit. Everything else comes from the sea or is flown in on the 20-seater plane which lands on the 900m grass airstrip four times a week. </p> <p>It is precisely this remoteness that makes Denis so special. Three degrees south of the equator and 95km from Mahe, the main island of the Seychelles, the coral atoll is the kind of place you dream of on a dreary October afternoon stuck at your desk. As the plane approaches, you can see from your window a crescent of lush green, bordered by blindingly white sand, ringed by turquoise water skimming over coral, set in the deep blue ocean. The island is rich in vegetation and, like all the Seychelles, a haven for birds. </p> <p>Touchdown on the grass airstrip - used most of the time for either grazing cattle or practising golf shots - is not for the fainthearted, but once on the ground you are reassured by the friendly greeting of Denis's staff and the offer of cold towels and fresh fruit juice. </p> <p>The lodge - 10 minutes walk from the airstrip - prides itself on informality, urging its guests to make themselves at home. Several things mark it out from a conventional hotel: principally the feeling that the whole island is yours for the duration of your stay. There are no locks on the doors of the 25 \"cottages\" scattered among the trees along the beaches - there is no need, according to the lodge, as the island's resident population of about 40 all work either at the hotel or the farm. There are no televisions, radios or phones in the rooms, and the island is just out of range for the use of mobiles. Messages from the outside world can get through, but most people don't want to be disturbed. </p> <p>Richard, the Welsh barman at the lodge, had been on Denis for four weeks, having escaped from a pub in Aldershot by tracking down and securing his desert island dream on the internet. \"The world could be ablaze and I'd know nothing about it,\" he said. He spends his freetime swimming and snorkelling. </p> <p>The lodge operates only on a full-board basis - there is nowhere else to eat on the island. Breakfast and lunch are both buffets, with guests often eating barefoot. Dinner is less casual, although unlike many exclusive hotels there is no obligation to dress up. There is always a choice of three main courses including a meat option, and the food is fabulous: vodka-cured tuna; fish baked in spicy creole sauce; octopus and coconut curry, exotic fruits and home-baked bread. </p> <p>Drinks are added to your bill, and you could end up with a reasonably hefty charge at the end of your stay depending on your taste: beers are cheap, cocktails expensive. But, apart from drinks, scuba-diving and deep-sea fishing, there is literally nothing on the island to spend money on. The lodge has a tiny shop, selling trin kets and a few essentials; there are shelves of books in the bar for guests to borrow; billiards, table-tennis, backgammon and chess-sets are available for those who have not quite reached the empty-minded, staring-out-to-sea, completely-chilled condition that is what Denis is really all about. </p> <p>Once you have reached that state, the best place to be is on the beach. If the stretch of brilliant sand in front of your cottage is not deserted enough, you can easily find a real Robinson Crusoe experience elsewhere on the island. It takes about two hours to walk round Denis, and for most of that time you will be entirely alone among the crabs and driftwood. Take some flippers and a snorkel, and you can spend hours floating face down in the warm sea gazing at fluorescent fish darting in and out of the coral. </p> <p>The cottages are generously spaced and roomy. Each has a large veranda facing the sea, a sitting area and a big bathroom with disturbing floor-to-ceiling windows and glass door leading to a tiny walled courtyard with an outdoor shower to rinse off the sand. </p> <p>The average stay on Denis is nine nights, although one emotional entry in the visitors' book recorded a four-month stay. Right up until the last possible minute, you can bury your toes in the warm sand on the beach or sip an ice-cold beer at the bar. When you hear the plane's engines overhead, it's time to walk down to the airstrip to say your reluctant goodbyes. </p> <p>Luxury is readily available in the Seychelles, but comes in different forms. Denis is understated and casual; the five-star Lemuria Resort on another island, Praslin, which opened earlier this year, is sophisticated and elegant. Once behind its tall gates, you need never leave. Built into granite boulders, the hotel centres round a spectacular three-level pool, and houses a golf course, spa and treatment centre, tennis courts and children's centre. </p> <p>One of the loveliest beaches in the Seychelles, Anse Georgette, can be reached only by boat or through the hotel grounds. Georgette and a neighbouring beach, Anse Lazio, voted by German tourists as the most beautiful in the world, are exactly like your favourite fantasy: coconut palms bending low over pristine sands, warm crystal water, a few footprints to show you are not entirely alone. </p> <p> P raslin is the second largest of the Seychelles islands with about 6,000 inhabitants. Beaches and watersports aside, there is little to do or see. </p> <p>At the heart of the island is the Vall\u00e9e de Mai, a living remnant of prehistoric forest, now a World Heritage Site and protected by the Seychelles Islands Foundation. It is the home of the Coco de Mer, a palm which for many years was thought to grow under the sea until it was discovered here. The trees reach 30m, and produce the largest seed in the world, weighing up to 20kg. </p> <p>The valley is also the home to the black parrot, only found on Praslin. Entrance to the site is about \u00a35.50, and for the same price you can hire a private guide to point out and explain the extraordinary palms, plants, birds, lizards and spiders. </p> <p>Back at the hotel, there are endless permutations of eating and drinking. Three excellent restaurants, including one situated on the beach; extensive room service; sandwiches and drinks can be brought to you by the pool. Apart from breakfast,everything - including drinking water, which is only available from the mini-bar in the room - is added to your final bill. </p> <p>The service is discreet and efficient. At about 6.30pm, just as darkness is about to drop like a heavy curtain, a man glides into your elegantly-decorated and enormous room, bearing a flute of champagne and a single canap\u00e9 on a porcelain plate. You take it out onto your terrace or balcony, feeling the weight of the velvety tropical night in sharp contrast to the air-conditioned luxury of your room. </p> <p>Maybe the meek will inherit the earth, but in the meantime paradise is yours if you can afford it. </p> <p><strong> The practicals</strong><br> </p> <p> Harriet Sherwood travelled with Abercrombie &amp; Kent/Air Seychelles.

  "<p><strong> The Bad Sister</strong><br> Emma Tennant <br> (Canongate, \u00a37.99)<br><a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,502449675,00.html\">Buy it at BOL</a><br> </p> <p> This omnibus first offers a double portion of Tennant's 19th-century psychological tales - The Bad Sister, an unsettling reworking of Confessions of a Justified Sinner, and Two Women of London, which relocates Jekyll and Hyde to Notting Hill and adds a feminist twist. Both play on the theme of doubles and madness. To this febrile pair Canongate adds Wild Nights, a family chronicle inspired by Tennant's own background, and a deft introduction from Candia McWilliam. Being Scottish may help, as McWilliam says, to understand Tennant's exploration of a divided self, but non-Scots can still relish the shifting perspectives that give her writing its peculiarity. </p> <p> <strong> Lee Trebilcock in the 20th Century</strong><br> Hannah Crow <br> (Anchor, \u00a36.99)<br><a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,1001002000304124,00.html\">Buy it at BOL</a><br> </p> <p> Set in a seaside town in the south-west of England and with an improbably named hero, Crow's debut is an impressive novel of white, working-class male anger. Lee works at Do It Easy and hopes, as any 19-year-old would, that divorc\u00e9e Lorraine from fitted kitchens will \"do it easy\" with him in the lunch break. He goes home to a council estate and a mother suffering with Alzheimers and goes around with mascara'd Hawley until Uncle Septor and his camera club decide to rid the estate of \"perverts\". Crow's portrait of adolescence is wonderfully tart, with Lee a bleakly nihilistic yet engagingly outrageous character. </p> <p> <strong> Border State</strong><br> Tonu Onnepalu <br> (Northwestern University Press, \u00a39.99)<br><a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,1001002000324575,00.html\">Buy it at BOL</a><br> </p> <p> There are 20-odd books in NUP's series of \"Writings From an Unbound Europe\" - Czech, Serbian, Hungarian and Polish writers who would otherwise rarely be read elsewhere. This small novel by the Estonian Onnepalu is written as a series of letters from an eastern European, meandering through Euro-land in the company of a lover whom he eventually murders. Elliptical and overly poetic in places, Border State nonetheless rings with fury and bewilderment at the prostitution of one half of Europe to the empty freedoms offered by the other. The metaphor is blunt, but the sentiment compelling. </p> <p> <strong> The Fish Can Sing</strong><br> Halldor Laxness<br> (Harvill, \u00a310.99)<br> <a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,502144921,00.html\">Buy it at BOL</a><br> </p> <p> This story of an orphaned boy growing up in Reykjavik at a time when fishermen grazed horses around its outskirts describes an utterly foreign world. The Fish Can Sing meanders beautifully, catching at inconsequential anecdotes, descriptions of the narrator Alfgrim's life and the stories of his grandparents and the visitors who stay in their loft at the turn of the century. This might seem to colour the narrative with folksy nostalgia, but Laxness's view of a child's bounded universe has humour and a light touch. As an antidote to psychological \"Danish novels\", he creates an engrossing alternative way of telling stories. </p>",
  "<p>Russell Banks's characters tend to be called \"trailer trash\", but it's a phrase you'll despise after reading his fiction. His new short-story retrospective, The Angel on the Roof, sinks especially deep into the ice-bound aloneness of small towns and trailer parks in upstate New Hampshire and New York, the American North Country he's staked as his own. We see the inhabitants of one lakeside terminus from a dozen angles, each enriching the pride, idiocy, selfishness, sympathy, nobility and wreckage-clinging survived despair to be found in such lost corners. </p> <p>In the novel Continental Drift (1985), the careening effort by Bob Dubois to escape his caged small-town prospects tears him away from himself and his family, and leads to devastating loss. In Rule of the Bone (1995), a teenage boy's need to out-race alienation and parental abuse spins him off America's edge. The busload of drowned, frozen schoolchildren in The Sweet Hereafter (1997) and the middle-aged man doomed by his drunk, violent father's example in Affliction (1989) - both recently adapted as Oscar-winning films - show abandonment from other angles, a genetic flaw in America's heart. Banks knows this whole story. Born in New Hampshire, he's fought off his own violent father's example, freed himself from a fated life with fiction. He knows his subjects aren't a Jerry Springer freak show. They're humanity. </p> <p>\"There's an important tradition in American writing,\" the 60-year-old says, in the upstate New York small town where he now lives, when not teaching at Princeton, \"going back to Mark Twain and forward to Raymond Carver and Grace Paley, whose work is generated by love of people who are scorned and derided. The people I'm writing about are the ones you normally don't feel affection for when you see them in the street or the shopping mall. I have an almost simple-minded affection for them. My readers are not the same as my characters, as I'm very aware. So I'm glad when they feel that affection too.\" </p> <p>Vann, in the story \"Plains of Abraham\", stands for almost all Banks's male characters: \"a complex, layered mind with only a few compartments connected\". Alienated from his culture and class, unable to understand his own nature, he has no way out. \"I think that's particularly true of men,\" Banks says. \"They feel their lives are being mysteriously controlled by forces they can't even name. As a defence they compartmentalise their experience into little boxes that don't communicate, because the truth is too painful. At some point, they hear rapping through the walls of those boxes, and they start to realise something's deeply wrong. Most of my male characters then struggle back to some place in their past, to find when the light at tunnel's end dimmed.\" </p> <p>Banks's life was like that of his own future characters until his mid-twenties, fitted to the shape set for him: wife at 18 (first of four), baby at 19, divorced at 20, a small-town New Hampshire pipe-fitter in a pick-up truck. It was writing's discipline - Jack Kerouac's harsh background and the paternal friendship of Nelson Algren were among his inspirations - that plucked him to a different life. But this uprooting left guilty scars on work that was at first constrained, in denial. \"I felt I'd betrayed my past and the people who made it up. My writing was in a netherland: fearful of my own sources, of myself, till my mid-thirties, when I accepted them.\" </p> <p>The source that was most difficult to admit was his father, a violent drunk who abandoned the family when Banks was 12, and around whom he was physically anxious even in the man's old age. \"He remains the centre of my imaginative life. He wasn't just a violent, alcoholic brute, no one is. He died in 1979, and yet he appears in my dreams two or three times a week, as he was in his mid-forties, when he was at his most powerful. He left a residue of violence my neurons are still patterned around. It's trauma that rewires them, usually. Goodness never provides a trauma. Violence does. Abandonment does. Betrayal does. My adult life has been lucky, people have been faithful and loving. So my wiring's the same.\" </p> <p>\"The Visit\", in which a successful middle-aged man revisits a childhood home electrified with shadowy, threatening memories, is also Banks's attempt to invoke what he calls the \"heat and light\" of violence, \"its erotic charge, its intensity of attention\", for both victim and victimiser - a seduction that he later sought out in senseless bar-room fights which would have left him dead if writing hadn't stepped in. Affliction's paternal tragedy was his fictional goodbye to all that. \"I was glad I wrote that story. It meant I wouldn't have to again.\" </p> <p> The Sweet Hereafter and Rule of the Bone instead focused on 1990s children: Nicole in one, Bone in the other, both sexually abused. The former's schoolbus, in which a town's children sink inexorably away from their parents through cracked ice, is later a refuge from parents for Bone, abandonment unbroken. Recently, Cloudsplitter (1999), about violent Abolitionist John Brown, investigated racism's stain. </p> <p>Banks, meanwhile, is back where he started, in a working-class small town. \"I had to will myself back. But these people are my birthright. Writing saved me by letting me leave once. But I can never go too far. All the truth I know is here.\" </p> <p> <a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206, 501024370,00.html\">Buy The Angel on the Roof at BOL</a><br></p>",
  "<p>\"When you see the Nobel Peace Prize pinned on the chest of a man whose maps still do not depict the state of Israel, then you know there is nothing you can do. The hyena never changes his spots.\" I say, this is crazy. Where is the hope? Where is the way forward? \"The only hope now,\" - he sips his coffee - \"is the passage of time. Arafat can never be the solution, because he will always be the problem. For as long as my Arab neighbours go on choosing him, there is no hope whatsoever.</p> <p>\"People know this. They know it but they don't want to face it. They go round saying \"Oh wouldn't it be nice if it all worked out somehow? They know the facts but they refuse to draw the conclusion. It won't work out.\"</p> <p>We are all taken aback by Begin, his intellectual command, his profound and daunting pessimism, and Sigal has gone into one of her silent moods, as if the effort of listening without interrupting has terminally lowered her spirits. I scarcely have time to worry about this. For today I have decided to walk through the mirror into Israel's twin, its underside.</p> <p> Nothing prepares you for the physical shock of the passage into Gaza. One writer has said that driving from Israel into the Gaza Strip is like driving from California into Bangladesh. You become so used to the broad highways, the easy sensuality of Israel that it is the sight of dust, sudden dust, an unholy big brown storm of pure dirt, which alerts you to the fact that you are about to enter a society where people earn precisely 8% of what their opposite numbers earn in Israel.</p> <p>Keith Lawrence and I set off on foot across the concrete strip which divides the two countries. For a moment, it is like a John Le Carre movie, as we carry our bags past gun towers down the wide empty road. And at the exact half-way point, just as in the movies, I am seized, bundled into a waiting car and driven quickly away, admittedly by two friendly young Englishwomen. The reason for this haste, it turns out, is that Susannah and Pauline, my new British Council handlers, have just told me that in 20 minutes I will be meeting with Haider Abdel Shafi. Shafi is the most popular politician in Gaza and it is something of a mystery why he has agreed to see me, since he sees no one. </p> <p>As we travel along a potholed track - you couldn't call it a road - towards the city of Gaza, I am taken aback by what I am seeing. Gaza is an area 45 kilometres by eight. Even now, one-third of it is held by the Israelis, on behalf of just 6,000 religious settlers. Around them are crammed 750,000 Palestinians, half of whom live in the refugee camps, which were temporarily established in 1948.</p> <p>Dusk comes down and we have stepped back 60 years. As we push past the donkeys Pauline says: \"It's a good day today because it's not been raining. When it rains, there's no drainage and the main street can be under three feet of water. Turds float past the car window,\" she says. There are rudiments of civilisation - yellow dustbins, donated by the European Union ; donkeys queue at the 18 sets of traffic lights, donated by the French; and in a bizarre job creation scheme there are innumerable young boys dressed as policemen, and universally ignored. </p> <p>As soon as we are ushered into Haider Abdel Shafi's elegant living room, it becomes clear why he has agreed to meet me. He believes that I am the Guardian journalist, David Hirst, and, as such, the author of a recent two-page expose straplined \"Shameless in Gaza\". Since the 70-year-old Shafi has lately resigned from the legislative body in protest at the notorious corruption of Arafat's regime, he is keen to congratulate me on my work. It seems somehow appropriate to this peculiar, hushed city that a man who knows nothing is now about to interview a man who thinks he is someone else.</p> <p>\"If I want to find excuses for Arafat, then I suppose I can say he has spent his whole life in a liberation movement, and he is unused to not getting his way. Hundreds of millions of dollars have simply disappeared. Arafat is a man who buys peoples' allegiance. But in a society where law is neglected and never enforced, nothing can ever be right.\"</p> <p>I ask what effect the lawlessness is having on the peace process. Shafi smiles. \"There is no peace process. Even by pretending that there is such a thing, we play into Israeli hands. I was in Washington for 20 months negotiating, so I know how Israelis think. Their position has never changed. All they are doing is using settlements to establish their presence in the land, and then to treat it as a fait accompli. It's a strategy, nothing more.\" </p> <p>Shafi gets up to offer us Turkish coffee and chocolates from a big tin of Milk Tray. He twinkles at the ladies, who glow back from the sofa. \"President Clinton has no interest in the indigenous people of Palestine, who were here long before the Israelis arrived. He wants settlement-building to stop. But for him it's not a matter of principle. It's a tactic in his peace process. It's a pause he wants, not a stop.\" How does Arafat feel? \"I have no idea. He refuses to reveal his thinking. Friends say he is depressed. I cannot wonder he is depressed.</p> <p>\"Our most urgent task is to reform ourselves. It's far more important than negotiation with Israel. You can't get anywhere if you live in a society without principles. When Mohammed came back from battle, he said: \"Raja na min al jihadil-asgar ila l-jihadi l-akbar. We come back from the little strife and we return to the bigger strife. The strife of the soul.' But of course nowadays, nobody thinks about these things.\"</p> <p>It is Shafi's achievement to create a calm in us all, and the calm lasts as we step out onto the empty street. I ask: \"Where does Arafat live?\" It's dark and not a soul moves. We drive towards the sea. We turn. A quiet avenue of villas. At the end of this road of seaside vernacular, two enormous tanks. Behind them, Arafat's house, looking like any other.</p> <p>We get out. Silence. Only the roar of the surf, the Mediterranean. \"There'll be a civil war,\" says Pauline. \"It's inevitable. The society is simply not functioning.\"</p> <p>Later, it is Pauline who finally sets me straight. She is here to help the Palestinians set up a civil service. \"What you're seeing, I'm afraid, is the result of the intifada. You have to understand that was a real revolution, and it came up from below, not from the leadership. But now . . . well it's like that film with Meryl Streep. What's it called?\" \"You mean the one where she's meant to be Danish?\" \"No, not that one. The one set during the war.\" \"Oh, Plenty,\" I say, \"I wrote it.\" She looks at me suspiciously. \"Well anyway, the figure of the woman - what's she called?\" \"Susan Traherne.\" \"Yes, the woman who goes to war at 20 and for whom the peace is this terrible disappointment. It's the same here. It's like Plenty. These kids were 13 or 14, some of them even seven or eight, and they found they could create their own structures. They could have a direct and devastating effect on daily life in Israel. By their actions they truly achieved something. But now the energy is gone. The men from Tunis came and stole it. Those same kids have grown up and are sitting around in cafes. They have no jobs, they have no life, they're totally disillusioned. </p> <p>\"There was a point once, there was a reason. You were fighting for a Palestinian state, and you were willing to die. What on earth would you die for now? If you struggled now, you would be arrested, and tortured and put to death, all so that Arafat can go on being corrupt. There are more people in prison today under Arafat than there were under the Israelis! What's the point of dying for a society without rules? If the Israelis were really clever, they would give the Palestinians every inch of land they want, and then stand by and watch them fuck it up.\" This is a terrible analysis, but it's confirmed when I next travel, this time to the Arab city of Ramallah. My official companion is Muna Khlefi, a sparkling, clever Palestinian who thinks I am incredibly lucky to have met Haider Abdel Shafi and who wants to hear every word. \"He is a great man. He is the guts, he is the soul of the country. The new leadership just want to do business. They did business in Lebanon, they did it in Tunis. They say: just make money, then later we'll decide what kind of society we want. But Shafi says you cannot delay this question.\" Muna wants me to meet Albert Aghazerin, the great Palestinian historian, to talk about the problem of Jerusalem. He is late, so I sit in his outer office at Birzeit University, looking out onto the hillside campus. I pick up the Amnesty International report on Palestine. \"Subjects have been electrocuted, hanged upside down. Scalding plastic has been melted over their bodies... \"</p> <p>After an hour, Aghazerin arrives, a frightening figure with a big pipe and a superb sculpted face, rather like the actor Anthony Quinn. He thrusts an article at me, ordering me to read it. When I dare to ask a question, he sighs and says: \"Where do you start? For me you can only answer this by considering the Egyptian conquest of 1831,\" and at once he sets off on a canter through 19th-century statistics which I can't grasp, partly because he scares me so much, and partly because his mind is leaping about like an angry gazelle. </p> <p>However, when I ask him what he thinks the religious Jew truly believes, he starts to cheer up, pleased that we turn out to share a common interest. \"All this apocalyptic stuff only starts after 1967. You do get a whiff of it before but it's only after the six day war that the Jews come up with this new interpretation of the Bible. The building of the Third Temple! The end of the world! Please! It's pure opportunism. Religious revelation which just happens to be the most perfect political connivance.</p> <p>\"There are women in Jerusalem who've actually started sewing the garments for the priests of the Third Temple and they're preparing the unblemished... ANIMAL. You know, what is it? That... what is it? Animal, begins with h? H!\", he shouts. \"Heifer?\" \"That's right! HEIFER! They are preparing the unblemished HEIFER to purge the temple. And of course it all suits Israel fine. But groups like this always bring violence and bloodshed. Rabin's assassination did not come out of nothing.\"</p> <p>I ask him if he thinks Israel divided. \"Deeply, deeply divided. There are three Israels now. The hedonistic Israel of Tel-Aviv. The austere Israel of Jerusalem. And the mad Israel of Hebron which wants only vengeance and blood.</p> <p>\"Look I do not discount what the Jews suffered. Nobody can. I know what they suffered in Europe. But to me it is as if they jumped from a burning building and happened to land and break the neck of a man who was passing. And when the man says 'Hey, you've broken my neck', they say 'Sorry, it's because of the fire'. And when the man says \"yes, but my neck's broken', they just break his arm to try and shut him up. And when he doesn't shut up, they break his other arm. Then his leg. Then his other leg. All in the hope that one day he'll shut up. But, you see, I don't think he will.</p> <p>\"I like these parables. I will give you another. Israel has its hands round our throat. He can't throttle us, but nor can he let us go. He's unhappy because he wants to go for a beer, and we're unhappy because we're being strangled, but in some terrible way we are bound up in each other's unhappiness. We cannot be separated.\"</p> <p>I ask him if it will change. \"It will stink before it changes. You have to ask yourself about the so-called peace process: is its purpose the exchange of land, or is it the subjugation of the Palestinian people? Because, on the ground, there's no question all the evidence points to the second. What is the reason for all these stupid checkpoints, and the impossibility of Arabs getting a visa to visit Jerusalem? Arabs can't visit Jerusalem!\" </p> <p>On the road home to Jerusalem the other night he was stopped, as he always is, at the checkpoint. The army girl who was no older than his own daughter started to go through all his luggage. When she put his things back he said: \"Do you like what you do? I have a daughter, and I will give her the right to do many things, but not this, because this is dehumanising. Do you know what she replied? 'I'm doing a job. I don't think about it. Now goodbye.' </p> <p>\"Shall I sum it up for you? They always ask two questions. Did you pack the bag yourself? And did anyone give you anything to carry? The other day I answered the first question, then I added, 'And no-one gave me anything to carry.' The Israeli guard looked at me furious: 'How dare you? Don't you know : you are not allowed to answer the second question until I ask it?' \"David, that says it all.\"</p> <p>Albert and I part firm friends. And my own spirits are reflected in the cheerful air of Ramallah, the largest Arab city in the West Bank, where women wear dresses and where alcohol is served in the restaurants.</p> <p>On the way to the Presto cafe, where I am to meet the producer of Romeo and Juliet, Muna explains that George Ibrahim is one of the few people in Palestine allowed to make theatre. On arrival, George turns out to be bear-like and convivial, punching my arm whenever he makes a good point.</p> <p>George attacks the portrayal of Arabs in western films. \"We are always just puppets. You play with us according to your imagination, so we are monkeys smoking pipes, or more usually, criminals. I hate Hamas myself, so I know that extremists are criminals. But I also know why. I know why they commit crimes. Think! Just think! Think what depths of despair it will take to make you walk into a market with lumps of dynamite tied round your chest. But no American film-maker has ever tried to think. All Arabs get lumped together.\"</p> <p>His friend, the poet of the intifada, Hussein Barghouti joins in. \"Did you see... did you see The English Patient? Foreground action: white people, noble, fine feelings, strong, full of laughter, walking in gardens, taking showers, oh standing up! Background action: Arabs, shifty, mysterious, dirty, untrustworthy, oh sitting down! Or Air Force One! This picture explains to us what Arabs want. What do they want? To capture the American president! Why? Why would anyone want the American president? Why would they do that? No, really? The reason? Because the world needs an enemy. When the Soviet Union was around, there it was, ready-made. Now it's to be us. It suits the Americans to say, 'Who are the Arabs? The Arabs are the people who will start the third world war.'</p> <p>\"You know, I have been reading Mishima and he is very moving on this subject. The destruction of Japanese culture by the west. The west injecting violence into a culture. All the conflicts in this area are imported. They are not organic. The west came here to find its religion. Yet how did you bring it back to us? In the form of the Crusades! You collect your religion from this part of the world, then you bring it back to us as violence.\"</p> <p>I'm happy in Ramallah, it's less desperate, less disturbing than Gaza, but every night I travel back to Jerusalem, where not only half the world's religions originated but also - hardly by coincidence - where the world first started collecting crime statistics. Yes, Crime Number One. It happened in Jerusalem. Cain killed Abel. </p> <p>At Oslo, the question of how Jerusalem should be administered was put to one side as being simply too difficult even to approach. For this Jerusalem is the world capital of claim and counter-claim, the acknowledged metropolis of dispute. Here, contention, abrasion and mistrust are scored deep into the subtly pink rock. </p> <p>\"The angry face of Yahweh,\" says Arthur Koestler, \"broods over hot rocks which have seen more holy murder, rape and plunder than any other place on earth.\" \"The air over Jerusalem,\" says Herman Melville, \"is saturated with prayers and dreams... it's hard to breathe.\" For me, there's no question: I have to walk the Via Dolorosa, to follow the Stations of the Cross, which represent the steps on Christ's journey to his death. \"All these stones, all this sadness, all this light.\" It's the religion of my homeland, even if homeland's not a word I've ever used. But the shock is to realise just how little impact Christianity has made. It's amusing to see bus-loads of American evangelicals, dressed in shell suits and baseball caps, searching vainly in an old Arab city for any remaining evidence of Our Lord. \"There ought to be more. What's happened? Why is there not more?\"</p> <p>To be honest, I share their bewilderment. After all, Christianity's a well-known religion and I'd say influential in its day. You'd think it was still worth a pilgrimage, but in this town, we come a sporting third. We're the sideshow. The Via Dolorosa is a pavement which winds unimpressively past postcard shops and up narrow alleys, filling me with a sense of loss, with a tangible sense of something lost - until it reaches the Church of the Holy Sepulchre which - wouldn't you know, wouldn't you just guess it? - is also disputed. Yes, even the church which contains the stone where our Lord was crucified is shared unhappily: 70% to the Greeks and the rest doled out higgeldy-piggeldy between the Armenian Christians, the Coptic Christians, the Latins, the Syrians and the Ethiopians. A people divided by a common religion. Sects and the single church.</p> <p>And what's more - hold on, here we go - is the stone on the right spot? Nobody knows. Archaeologists also dispute. Nobody can know because nobody knows where the city walls were. Nobody agrees. Where was Calvary indeed? So for now - look, is anything certain? - let's just do as the family next to me and drop alarmingly to our knees, on the working assumption - let's just assume - X marks the spot, and kiss the stone. After all does the literal truth of it matter? Does the literal truth matter? Aren't we kissing an idea? Stones or ideas? Stones or ideas?</p> <p>And it's a relief, I'd say a relief, to come out of the dark and stroll down to the big open plaza where you find the Wailing Wall, strangely impressive, tall, uncrowded, the bit where the Jews are allowed. For towering above them at the very top of the arrangement, is the most coveted spot in the universe of faith, what the Jews call Temple Mount, but what to the Arabs who occupy it is known as the Haram al-Sharif. And at its centre, the saffron-yellow golden Dome of the Rock.</p> <p>I have felt since I arrived that Jerusalem doesn't need my admiration. Enough people are obsessed with it already. The truth is, I look at it and think how beautiful it must have been when it was a small town. Myself, I would like Jerusalem more if it were less important. But even I, inside the Arab sanctuary, taking in the cleanest, most oxygenated sun-dazzled air you ever breathed, looking across to the Mount of Olives, yield to the splendour of the place and realise: oh I see, how provoking it is to own beauty, to own the most breathtaking space of them all.</p> <p>Coming down, Sigal is waiting. I haven't seen the delightful Sigal for some time, because I have been, as it were, with the other lot, and so she is spilling over with gossip: Netanyahu's government is falling, or is about to fall, or may not fall, because of some scandal about money and loans. I get into the car. The driver doesn't know the city, so we circle for some time. It's interesting. When we stop people in the street to ask them the way to Yad Vashem, the world-famous museum of the Holocaust, some of them don't seem to know.</p> <p>The museum's power is in its very simplicity, a bleak photographic record ending not, as westerners expect, in 1945, but in 1948 at the foundation of the state. At the centre of the display, I stop at the text of Himmler's speech, the most astonishing document of the war, in which he congratulates his men on the discipline they have shown in exerting what he calls their \"moral right\" to exterminate the Jews.</p> <p>It is, Himmler says, \"natural tact\" which prevents any German from speaking of what they are doing. Himmler knows it is hard work, digging pits and throwing bodies into them. But what he is proudest of is that in doing this work his men have - the phrase resonates down the century - his men have \"stayed decent\", and it is staying decent \"that has made us hard\".</p> <p>The only false notes in the museum are hit by works of art. Sculpture and painting. They seem superfluous. In every case the gesture seems inadequate. What is a painting, a painting of a starving man? What is a painting of a corpse? It's the facts we want. Give us the facts. We go into the dark, into the Hall of Names. Here, every Jew who is known to have died between 1939 and 1945 is given a simple file. Finally, after so many years, numbers are given the dignity of becoming human beings. In this sombre room of open shelves, the scale of the Nazi offence, its deliberateness is revealed. The unbroken rank of documentation hits you more shockingly, more woundingly, than any other image. </p> <p>We walk in the Garden of Remembrance. We begin to feel the sun. Voltaire said you must choose between countries where you sweat and countries where you think. The confusing thing about Israel is that it's one where you do both. And my mind is racing now. We're all blind. We all see only what we want to. Don't we blank out the rest?</p> <p>And me more than anyone. At times I'm the worst of the lot. I've seen a good many politicians while I'm here but at the end I'm due to meet one who's lost all hope of office. I'm used to hours getting past the security arrangements for the minister of something or other, but my last visit is to a tiny, unsecured basement in Tel-Aviv. I have already noticed that just the name of Shulamit Aloni is enough to attract violent hostility from some who knew her as the flaming red firebrand of the Rabin government.</p> <p>And as she comes already talking into the room she is like a manic depressive Melina Mercouri with thick glasses and no time to wait for the questions.</p> <p>\"What you want to know?\" she asks, throwing herself down into the biggest armchair. \"Why do you say it's difficult to understand what's happening? It couldn't be simpler. We're going backwards. What's so difficult to understand? Jews were once victims, so we are brainwashed to believe we will always be victims and victims can do no wrong. Suddenly we've become strong and greedy and pretend we can justify everything. We're told all the time the Palestinians want to throw us into the sea. We have six million people and the strongest army in the region. And yet we speak of them as if they were two equal powers. It's just manipulating peoples' fears.\"</p> <p>She raps out an order in Hebrew for Sigal to go and get some coffee. Sigal gets up, furious, while Shulamit carries on, blaming the reversal entirely on Netanyahu. I am enjoying Shulamit - she is absolutely, as they say, my cup of tea - but even I am a little surprised by her blaming Netanyahu for everything. Are things ever really down to one man? \"You are English and I assume you went to high school\" she says, rather nastily, \"so you will have heard of the philosopher Hobbes. Hobbes says a whole society can be destroyed by a single individual who decides to come along and burn down the forest. Netanyahu, aided by the greedy fascists, the army, the security service, is such a man.\"</p> <p>I ask what she can do meanwhile. Does she just wait? \"To wait means to die. I have no optimistic things to tell you. Why come to me? What are you doing here? Go to the younger people and ask them what they think.\" She is staring at me, as if it's the first time she's noticed me at all. \"Why you write down my blah-blah?\"</p> <p>I say that I normally start an interview by explaining what I am doing here, but somehow we had skipped that stage. \"It's a bad time. What can I say?\" \"It's what you feel.\" \"No, it's not what I feel. It's what I know. If it were only what I feel I'd go and have a brandy and I'd feel better. I'm not telling you my mood, though my mood is bad. I'm telling you the facts. I am gloomy. But what do I matter?\"</p> <p>She looks me in the eye, challenging me to defy her. This talented lawyer, who has done as much as anyone to offer practical support to the victims of discrimination and segregation, is lost, in pain, painfully lost and spoiling for a fight. \"What do you see happening next?\" \"Demonstrations, bloodshed, bitterness. It's not yet a civil war, but it's a form of civil war. It's a Kulturkampf. Do you know what that is?\" I nod. \"We are in the middle of one. The great mistake was to give power to the clergy in the first place. And immigrants came from eastern Europe and the Mediterranean, they were backward, they knew nothing about democracy. They think democracy is the rule by the majority. What's worst, we have no written constitution...\" I have not opened my mouth and already she is shouting at me. \"Don't tell me you don't have one in England! I know that! I know that! But you have the Magna Carta and Oliver Cromwell and a tradition, and until recently you had the idea that certain things are not done.\"</p> <p>She gets up. It ends as abruptly as it begins. \"Anything else? I have to run.\" I am aware this woman's world was destroyed by Rabin's death. She shakes my hand. \"The British caused a lot of problems here.\" \"I know that\". \"Do you know what I say to the British? Since you left, we love you very much. And I mean it. We do.\"</p> <p>We walk back to the British Council, Sigal fuming at the way Shulamit insulted her. I start collating my notes in the office. A British Council worker comes in, called George. He is a Christian Arab. \"He is my enemy,\" says Sigal and they both roar with laughter contentedly. Shulamit Aloni rings to ask us both to pardon her for being what she calls \"impatient and obnoxious\". She is worn down, she says, by the weight of her case-work.</p> <p>We set off for the airport. On the way in, I have been advised not to let them stamp my passport so that I can visit Arab countries. But, on the way out, before I can say a word, WHAM, not a second to speak, and the word ISRAEL is on my passport for ever.</p> <p>(At this point the lights shift, and the feel of the stage is changed for the epilogue) Gatwick. My plane is late. I return in the middle of the night. I get on the slow train to Victoria. </p> <p>Darkness. </p> <p>The Israeli military commander, unnamed at his own request, who sits across a desk smiling, telling me that only 20,000 Jews have been killed in the cause of setting up the state. \"Not that every death isn't a tragedy, please don't misunderstand me, and of course I'm not talking about the Jewish experience in Europe. But the Jewish experience in this part of the world? 20,000 to set up a whole country: that's not so bad, you know. Not bad. Not for a whole state.\" Victoria station deserted. Into a friendly black cab. Up past Buckingham Palace, Park Lane, and north towards the suburbs, up the Finchley Road. Leafy street after leafy street of sleeping houses, sleeping bodies, sleeping hearts. Passion receding up the broad tree-lined avenues. Haider Abdel Shafi quoting Mohammed on his return from battle. \"I come back from the little strife and I return to the greater. The strife of the soul.\"</p> <p>Sitting in the harbour with Eran Baniel, eating fish. \"Fuck the land! Fuck it! What does the land matter? The highest value to a Jew is human life. The idea that stones now matter more than lives is a complete deformation of the Jewish religion. A deformation!\"</p> <p>Left on Chapel Street. Tall terraces of impeccable Georgian houses on either side. I think of David Grossman walking on the Heath. \"I have some sort of mineral reaction,\" he said. Pauline, in the boarding house in Gaza: \"There was a point once, there was a reason. You were fighting for a Palestinian state, and you were willing to die. What on earth would you die for now?\"</p> <p>The taxi turns right and right again. Are we where we live, or are we what we think? What matters? Stones or ideas? Stones or ideas?</p> <p>My dog Blanche waking in the night to greet me, the heavy white door of my home closing behind me.</p> <p>Via Dolorosa.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p> <p>On a Saturday in late September earlier this year, I stood once more on the Mount of Olives, looking across to the divided city of Jerusalem. It was the first time I'd been back since I'd made a series of visits to write Via Dolorosa three years previously. This time, the occasion was particularly happy. A friend was getting married, and by some special good fortune, the ceremony was allowed to take place in the open air, in an amphitheatre at the Hebrew University, on the very spot where the state of Israel was declared in 1948. Afterwards 350 guests piled into buses and were driven out into the desert. There followed an evening of Gatsby-like munificence - belly-dancers, camels and carpets on the sand. The speeches stressed the importance of family, roots, belonging. Already, it seems an extraordinarily long time ago. I can't pretend that at the wedding I had any inkling of the imminence of the convulsions which have since shaken the area, and which seem to have begun noticeably to shift the attitudes of foreigners to the rights and wrongs of the struggle between Israelis and Palestinians. The television pictures of heavily armed Israeli soldiers firing, as it seems, indiscriminately at young Palestinians who carry only rocks and bottles have ignited the emotions of a far wider public than anyone would hitherto have imagined. </p> <p> Curiously, I had begun writing my play in 1997, with the strong conviction that it was unhealthy that such a violent dispute should attract the passionate interest only of its own participants. At the time the west was shrugging off the subject of Arab and Jew as if it were over-familiar and boring. I could never have foreseen how, three years later, I would hear people who had previously been non-partisan arguing with such a deep sense of moral disgust and revulsion against the imbalance of forces at play in the territory. The arithmetic tells its own story: at least 130 people dead as I write this, all but eight of them Arab. When Elyse Dodgson, the head of the Royal Court's international department which had originally sent me to the Middle East, rang a friend in Ramallah to ask her what people were now feeling, the friend replied: \"We're not feeling anything. We're just burying the dead.\" </p> <p>It had seemed important when writing the play not to waste time offering opinions, since here was a controversy already overloaded with opinion. It was far more valuable to attempt enlightenment. I wanted, above all, to explain the roots of some of the powerful feelings which informed the attitudes of those most concerned. But by chance, four weeks ago in Jerusalem, I did make a point of returning to Yad Vashem, the Museum of the Holocaust, precisely because I wanted to remind myself out of what terrible suffering the current dilemmas of the area had come. I had always found the museum deeply moving and affecting. This time, as we walked in, we were faced with a few hundred Israeli conscripts who had plainly been made to visit the museum as part of their national service. Against black-and-white photographs of men, women and children dying in concentration camps, the young soldiers stood in uniform, boots and dark glasses, chewing gum, making obscene jokes and chatting loudly on mobile phones. Around their necks were still slung their sleek, black sub-machine guns, which they had not considered to remove before entering the museum. It was an image of stunning arrogance and disrespect. Even to someone who had gone out of his way not to rush to easy judgment, it marked confirmation of what the play had intimated - that sometimes the divisions inside the two communities have been just as important as the divisions between them. </p> <p> Watching the events of the last few weeks, I have become convinced that one statistic from Via Dolorosa stands out above all others. Arabs who live and work in the Palestinian territory earn well under one-tenth of what their opposite numbers earn in Israel. Wherever the blame lies for this dismal state of affairs - and both sides, remember, have failed the ordinary Palestinian whether by occupation or corruption - it must nevertheless be apparent to all parties that there is no chance of addressing profound problems of geography and religion if you do not also help correct this grotesque inequality. Crazy kids pick up stones not only because they believe their land has been stolen, but also because they feel that, in the current dispensation, there is no prospect of a livelihood. In looking for causes of the recent violence, it suits everybody to disregard the economic. But people with nothing to lose lose nothing by fighting. During the year I performed the play both here and in New York, I was asked over and over why I was so involved in a region in which the death rate, after all, was nowhere near as frighteningly high as it was in Rwanda. History, I believe, is answering that question, and not in ways which are offering much comfort.</p> <p><strong>Via Dolorosa revisited</strong> </p> <p>Via Dolorosa is a monologue, ideally to be performed by its author. As the audience arrive, the author is at the side of the stage. When they are all in he begins to speak. <br> People always say that in the west we lead shallow lives. Our lives must be shallow because we live in countries where nobody believes in anything any more. All my life, I've been told \"Western civilisation? An old bitch gone in the teeth.\" And so people say, go to Israel. Because in Israel at least people are fighting. </p> <p>In Israel, they're fighting for something they believe in. Israel is, first and foremost, a cause, the cause being a patch of land, north to south on the eastern shore of the Mediterranean, lying like a small brown anchovy set down on a school atlas, to which the most persecuted people of modern times - perhaps the most persecuted people of all times - after the matchless catastrophe of the Holocaust rushed in the perfectly reasonable belief that they would never be safe until they had a country of their own. \"We appealed to the conscience of the world. The world has no conscience. We have no one but ourselves.\" The fight. The struggle. The historic destiny. The return of the people. The cause: life therefore having a meaning and shape that eludes the rest of us in the endless wash of \"What the hell are we doing here?\" In a single day, says an Israeli friend, he experiences events and emotions that would keep a Swede going for a year. </p> <p> Zionism being a movement with only a short history, and distinguished from other political movements of our time by the fact that it was invented by a playwright. Yes, Theodor Herzl, in 1894 takes a mere three weeks to write his play Das Neue Ghetto, in which the Jewish hero, struck down by his enemy, dies at curtain-fall, his last words ringing out through the darkened theatre: \"I want to get out! Out of the ghetto!\" Nine years later it is the same Herzl who is chairman of the World Zionist Congress when Lord Lansdowne, on behalf of the magnanimous British Empire, is generous enough to offer a small chunk of Uganda as a suitable place for the Jews to \"live and observe their national customs\". Incredibly, a fair number of delegates are hotly in favour - a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush, and Africa, after all, is better than nothing - but the option is finally rejected on the grounds that Uganda does not have the spiritual quality the Jews require. From this moment on, the central argument is foreshadowed. Is this a Biblical mission? Or is Israel to be a secular state? Throughout the 80s, organizations like the Friends of Israel offer to pay for writers to visit their country. Later, my friend Philip Roth goes off his own bat and returns home inspired by his meeting with the settlers, those religious Jews who have turned their whole lives into an act of political defiance by establishing Jewish townships on hitherto Arab land. \"You've got to go, David. You've got to go and see it for yourself. These people are absolute lunatics. They're the maddest people I've ever met in my life. For any writer of fiction, they're the most wonderful material.\" \"But surely,\" I say to Philip, one of America's most gifted comic novelists, \"they're your material, not mine.\" \"Oh no,\" says Philip, \"You have no idea. These people are so crazy there's room enough for all of us.\" </p> <p> On all occasions I refuse. It is only now, it is only 10 years later that I realise, almost without noticing, that for some time my subject as a playwright has been faith. My subject is belief. And so it comes to seem appropriate - no, more than that, it comes to seem urgent - that the 50-year-old British playwright should finally visit the 50-year-old state. The week before, the Israeli novelist, David Grossman, comes to my house in Hampstead. He says that whenever he comes to London, he makes sure to walk on Hampstead Heath. \"I have some sort of mineral reaction to the place I don't get anywhere else in the world. Just to breathe the air makes me feel happy.\" Obscurely, I feel proud when he says this, as if somehow Grossman's happiness in Hampstead reflected credit on me, as if it were part of the glory of happening to be British to be able, rather casually, to offer foreigners the wonderfulness of Hampstead Heath. But \"mineral reaction\"? Grossman has thought so deeply about the problems of Israel and has lived so long with questions from people like me that he can't help wincing at my clumsiness. \"What you call the major problems of Israel can one day be solved. There will be a Palestinian state. When I said this 10 years ago, everyone told me I was crazy. But now in their hearts people know it will happen. There are huge issues. But they are essentially soluble. What is less soluble is the underlying moral question: how does a majority which itself has been historically unloved now deal fairly with an unloved Palestinian minority in their own midst? Are we mature enough, are we courageous enough to internalise the idea of equality?\" I say, surely this has always been the problem at the heart of Zionism. Israel is effectively a religious state. It now admits immigrants of only one faith. Won't it one day have to become a modern country, multi-cultural, like any other? </p> <p> Grossman smiles. \"Yes, but for us that's very difficult. I don't see it the way you do. I don't think you have to be religious to be a Jew. There is no God in my life, and I'm as Jewish as it's possible to be. If you want to understand Israel, look to the six day war. That war changed everything. Myself, I feel we were much more Jewish before 1967. That war destroyed our essential Jewishness, because up till then places and buildings and stones didn't mean anything to us. They weren't important. What mattered to us were ideas. </p> <p> \"Something very profound happened to Israel during the six day war. For the first time we seized land, we took land by conquest, and suddenly the religious Jew saw the Bible not as a historical story, but as a contemporary operations manual. Yes, I want Israelis to have access to the Wailing Wall, but I don't need to own it. Nor do I need to own any of these holy places. It's new this idea. That you have to own things. It's new and it's profoundly un-Jewish.\" On arrival in Tel-Aviv I am rushed down Californian highways in the company of Sigal Cohen, the young and humorous translator who will accompany me wherever I go. I had expected massive security precautions and I boast of the ease with which I have sailed through immigration. \"Yes,\" she says, \"Israel is a very easy country to get into but it's an impossible country to get out of.\" At my nasty western-style downtown hotel, my chief British Council host Keith Lawrence is waiting. He is very thin, like a teddy-boy with tapered trousers and a collarless jacket. Give him a tall, skinny latte and this could be Soho. He is the man who is bringing plays like Shopping and Fucking to Tel-Aviv. He keeps saying Tel-Aviv is sexy and a happening kind of place, especially for a beach bunny, and sometimes he refers, rather unexpectedly, to the 'buzz'. When I try to find out exactly what the buzz consists of, everyone tells me that it has mostly to do with sitting in cafes and fucking. Later somebody tells me that Tel-Aviv is the fucking capital of the world. </p> <p> No chance to observe, because I am off to eat baked sea-bream, in a stunning waterside restaurant in the nearby port of Jaffa, at the invitation of the Israeli theatre director Eran Baniel. Eran is a fine-looking man in his early 50s, bearded, articulate, in a black corduroy suit. Now we drink Rothschild's Red Merlot and discuss the profound divisions which have emerged between the secular and religious ways of life. At the foundation of the state, the religious orthodox were guaranteed a special status. Anyone who entered a yeshiva to study the Talmud was exempted from the army, and given a public salary. At the time, there were just 500 students, but by the early 1990s there were over 100,000, says Eran \"effectively living off the state for life\".</p> <p> \"For years,\" says Eran, \"the Jew believed that when the goy persecuted you, it gave you the right to shortchange him. Hence the racial stereotype of the Jew who smiles while he swindles you. Well now we are the goy. Israel is the goy. And the religious orthodox have become the thieving Jew. They go to whoever wants to be prime minister and say, yes, you can have our votes but only if you promise to give us our money. They don't serve in the army. They smile and smile, and rob the country blind.\" </p> <p>Eran, it is clear, is a secular Jew. His life was changed by his famous co-production of Romeo and Juliet. This was presented in the middle of Jerusalem. The Palestinians played the Capulets and the Jews played the Montagues. There were five months of rehearsal, with the Palestinian producer George Ibrahim in charge of the Capulets and with Eran directing the Montagues. The project took eight years to achieve. In this production the Capulets really hated the Montagues. This was not a production about love, but about hate. Neither side needed the rhetoric at the beginning. \"You know that bit,\" says Eran, \"where the two sides line up and sort of say \"Fuck you, Montague\" and \"Fuck you, Capulet\". Well, we cut all that. Because Israelis and Palestinians go straight to the emotion: you pick up a stone and throw it straight away.\" </p> <p> Eran says he never really understood the occupation until he did this job. \"Most Israelis,\" says Eran, \"don't even notice the Palestinians. They don't see them. Have you seen how Israelis drive? They don't drive. They own the road.\" His voice is rising now. \"Have you been to the Palestinian territories? Look how the water is allocated. In the settlements, you have the obscene spectacle of Israelis sitting by their swimming pools while Palestinians carry their drinking water round in jerry cans.\" He uses a phrase I have heard before. \"It's un-Jewish, it's un-Jewish behaviour.\" By chance, a play of mine, Amy's View, is currently rehearsing at the Cameri, one of Israel's foremost theatres. Next morning I kick my way through the litter-strewn streets to meet the cast, who have two hours of questions. At one point I say the play is about how we no longer expect society to validate our beliefs. Our only values are private values. The last line of the play is: \"So. We're alone.\" Israel, I say, may be the worst place in the world to perform the play since here people are still arguing passionately about where their country is heading. Whereas in England Tony Blair represents all things to all men. What does he believe? Nobody knows. What will he do? Whatever is popular. Where is he heading? He never tells us. At once, an Israeli actor interrupts: \"Oh please, please, send us your Tony Blair.\" </p> <p> In fact, theatre is making me impatient because I am longing to get going and spend Sabbath in the Jewish settlement of Sheri Tikva which lies some miles inside the borders of the Palestinian territory. It takes us hours to push our way out of town on a Friday afternoon, in the pre-Sabbath rush, but finally Tel-Aviv falls away, and the road opens out. I think of my Sunday school, Sunday afternoons in a stuffy wooden hall in Bexhill-on-Sea. I look from the window of the car and the pale, stony landscape of dusty hills and olive-groves feels familiar, like a drawing from memory. </p> <p>I have now to be careful, because 10 minutes later a feeling arrives, unbidden. My mind is slipping, I am dreaming, perhaps of Israeli wine and fresh fish, when suddenly, in open country at last, it occurs to me, as I look out the window, that the Jews do not belong here. This thought is so unexpected and of course implicitly so inflammatory that I turn guiltily, blushing, to see whether anyone in the back of the car can tell what I'm thinking. Up till now I have spent time in Tel-Aviv, a town which, on its surface at least, is sophisticated and western, but now I am speeding through a huge land mass - I feel the topography, I feel the land, a great hot continent stretching away to my right, Arab country after Arab country - and for the first time I understand how odd, how egregious Israel must look to the Arab eye. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/extracts/story/0,6761,390205,00.html\">Extract two</a></p>",
  "<p>Terry Matthews is Wales' first and only billionaire, and rated one of the five richest people in Britain. But at first sight the goatee-bearded man in the unprepossessing suit, shirt and shoes in the lobby of the Celtic Manor Resort, Newport, Gwent, barely looks the part: more like a Valleys politician or small-scale entrepreneur. Until he speaks. Out comes a torrent of words, anecdotes, stories, accompanied by a whirlwind of gesticulations. </p> <p>He is an inveterate story-teller, a chronicler of south Wales' industrial history. A group of Vancouver tourists gawp in bafflement and awe as he recites the tale of the Powell family, founders of the Powell Duffryn engineering group, including the fate of a scion eaten alive in what is now Ethiopia, and then moves on to Swansea's role as the hub of the global non-ferrous metals industry for two centuries. \"I like history, industrial history,\" he tells them, pointing to a brass railing in the lobby. \"You know where brass comes from originally. Swansea. That's where.\" Then he is gone, out on to a nearby green of one of the three championship golf courses surrounding the \u00a3120m resort and off into local Roman history. \"See over there, just beyond the clubhouse, there's the remains of a Roman training camp we found, and [a sudden switch of gear] over here we're building corporate golf suites.\" </p> <p>But this global player has his eyes fixed firmly on the present and future. His roots may be in south-east Wales, in the Gwent valleys but home is Ottawa and north London - and the revolutionary world of broadband telecoms technology and the high-risk, high-stakes domain of venture capital. \"The ability to communicate in broadband is a dramatic instigator of change in everything we do in life and I'm not going to miss out on it,\" he says by way of dispelling any suggestion, his billions made, he is ready to retire at the age of 57. </p> <p>Matthews is good at two things: networking and networking. He devises solutions and applications for telecoms networks. Brash, pugnacious, ruthless, demanding he may be - \"I take concrete with my cereal\" - but he gets on with people. Celtic Manor, which he founded two years ago on the site of the boarded-up nursing home where he was born, is, with its 400 rooms, 32 suites, convention centre and golf courses, a magnet for \"the most senior people\" in the global telecoms industry. \"For some reason they all love golf and I can use the hotel as a base to conduct business - and, no, I don't have time to play.\" </p> <p>He has made his money in two ways. First, by building up his own businesses and selling them on, and by providing the seed-corn for spin-offs and start-ups. An obsessive fixer of things - clocks, bikes, cars - in his native Newbridge, he started work at 16 in BT's research labs in Dollis Hill, north London, and turned holidays in Ottawa at the age of 26 into a permanent stay. He set up Mitel in 1972, making integrated circuits and inventing private switchboards (PBX). \"We set it up with $4,000 of borrowed money and now it's making $1.5bn revenues.It doubled its revenues every year for the first 11 years and generally in electronics a successful company can do that and remain stable. Anything above that can be unstable.\"</p> <p>The company ran into problems with the break-up of AT&amp;T in 1982 and he sold a 51% controlling stake three years later to BT. By then a multi-millionaire, he founded Newbridge Networks a year later and earlier this year, 15 years on, sold it to Alcatel for \u00a34.4bn, taking a 3% stake in the French group to become its biggest individual stockholder. \"Alcatel's shares have just about doubled since the acquisition which is good for them and their shareholders, and employees of Newbridge.\" </p> <p>He talks excitedly about the spin-offs or affiliates he has helped nurture. \"In my career I have started up around 40 companies and I have lost only two, when the normal success rate is one in 10, and some of them have had an absolutely staggering success.\" He reels off a string of businesses: Vancouver-based Abatis, set up with $5m and sold four years later to Redback of California for $1.2bn; Bookham; Encipher; Orchestry. </p> <p>Matthews uses as his funding vehicle Celtic House Investments, set up in 1994 and run by an old school friend, Roger Maggs. He says he has invested $100m in the past five years and the companies he so far has not floated are alone worth well over $1bn. \"This coming year we will put in $250m. Investment capital has dramatically escalated in the last 12 months, just for Celtic House alone. There's more venture capital available than over the past five years, more than any time be fore.\" The main reason he cites is the potential unleashed by broadband networking, seeing an exponential, explosive growth in digital subscriber lines, digital cable modems, local multi-point distribution services and the like. </p> <p>\"Demand grossly outstrips the ability to supply and the point is that these networks are always available, always on, rather than having to be accessed by dialling via a modem,\" he says, a host of statistics about the potential growth pouring forth. \"Anything you've seen in the last 10 years in networking technology is just the tip of the iceberg. This is one of the most exciting developments ever in human endeavour because networking is fundamental to every aspect of life.\" </p> <p>Matthews has, therefore, no time for the doom-laden forecasts that the \"inflated bubble\" cocooning the Ciscos, Lucents, Nortels of this new world, even BT, is about to burst. \"Absolutely not, there may be a few problems now with the share prices but this is such a titchy bit of the iceberg and the value of the overhaul of the network - imagine, 1bn lines to be upgraded - is so staggeringly high that the entire sector will continue to do well. And the applications are even bigger once the basic highway has been laid. \"Until you put the roads in, the cars, buses and garages can't happen. This is dramatic and it's now. You've got to take advantage of the infrastructure and the applications, as in one or two years all the roads will be in place.\" For all his self-confidence he sees his own role in this process in a strangely coy manner. \"Timing in life is everything. If I had done this five years ago, surprise, surprise, there were no roads to run the cars on and now there are. All it takes is just awareness of what's going on to be innovative and inventive,\" he says, a trifle disarmingly. \"There will be losers as they will not be able to accommodate this dramatic change but opportunities are opening up like never before and you don't have to be a builder of the big switchers and optical networking to do well.\" </p> <p>The first application of broader bandwidth he sees is in fast-responding internet services - a graveyard for profit expectations until now. But his own sights are set on what he calls videocentric applications: using broadband networks in areas ranging from security and surveillance to health care, where he promises a budgetary revolution. </p> <p>Matthews is now chief executive of March Networks, an Ottawa-based offshoot of Newbridge that used to be called Telexis which itself specialised in digital video recording products for security and operations management. Earlier this month, March took over Elcombe, which provides technological solutions for the health-care market, for $15m equity and a share swap. The expanded company, he says, has secured $35m in equity funding. </p> <p>\"I can now do things for senior citizens in terms of health care which will help deal with a chronic shortage of nurses, for instance,\" he says. The new digital video applications can enable a nurse to treat or care for 15 patients online each day, compared to the perhaps five he or she might visit or see in a hospital or clinic. He is thinking ahead, according to his own motto: \"Don't be boring, do something\" or \"make a mark, don't be part of the living dead\". Amid this restless activity he still had time that day to take part in an \"innovation summit\" at his Celtic Manor resort and put the finishing details to his bid to stage the 2009 Ryder Cup, due to be submitted on Tuesday. It seems like a heroic one-man endeavour to put Wales on the map. </p> <p>The summit, attended by Rhodri Morgan, first secretary of the national assembly for Wales, came less than 24 hours after Panasonic became the latest Far East electronics group to scale down its Welsh operations, with the loss of 1,300 jobs. Matthews brushes aside this bad news in favour of the opportunities opening up for artists and content providers in Wales. \"We've got to create this entrepreneurialism and this is what they should focus on and they are. It's the first time in Wales I have ever heard anyone as prominent as Rhodri focus on such things. It's like a breath of fresh air.\" </p> <p>Terry Matthews, rich dynamic man of the world with a penchant for being a bon viveur, says he is trying to bring a taste of that world to his native country through his hotel complex above the M4. Even his new company, March, like Newbridge before, retains its Welsh origins - the name a play on pre-Tudor times when the region was known as Wales and the Marches, an ill-defined territory with no fixed border. \"Henry VII was born in Monmouth and was the Welsh person who became king of England, and his son, Henry VIII, nailed down the border. And broadband is disputed territory.\" It is a rich region where he would like to be king - and, like his Tudor predecessor, seems ready to chop off a few heads to do so. </p> <p><strong>The CV </strong></p> <p><strong>Born:</strong> Newport, Gwent, June 6, 1943 </p> <p><strong>Education:</strong> Schools in Newbridge, Gwent.

  "<p>Internet start-ups are seen as synonymous with youth, with men and women fresh out of business school - or even school - using the web to bypass the traditional hierarchy of the office and become instant senior managers. </p> <p>But a report issued by the Industrial Society this month says that dot.coms are realising that they need older, more experienced workers once they have launched to take the business from infancy into maturity. </p> <p>The report, Experience Necessary - the Business Case for Wisdom, has dubbed the type of older business people most in demand as \"warhorses\"; seasoned campaigners with experience of previous economic cycles who are not scared by downturns. Older people also bring the weight of experi ence, which leads to increased customer confidence, and well-honed networking skills. </p> <p>The report points in particular to the Asian market, where \"veneration and respect for age are important, and counterparts find it more comfortable to build relationships with older business people rather than with young dot.com entrepreneurs\". </p> <p>The view that having a few wrinkles are important in business was supported last week by the British Venture Capitalists Association, whose members underwrite scores of dot.com start-ups with hard cash. The association's chairman, David Thorp, decried the lack of wise heads watching the finances. </p> <p>\"The reason why the early dot.coms seemed to succeed was because they had no bag gage. Everyone was looking with fresh eyes and they went for it; the internet meant that barriers to entry were low and they had speed and verve. But what they did not have was business knowledge, and what we are now seeing is some of the more trusted business skills being integrated into new internet solutions.\" He adds that most venture capitalists avoided early dot.coms precisely because of their lack of business experience. </p> <p>This month saw the first high-profile signing of an older business star by his younger peers. Allan Leighton, 47, former chief executive officer of Wal-Mart Europe and Asda before that, is joining the board of lastminute.com. He will not be paid, but is receiving 1m share options for his role as non-executive chairman. </p> <p>Martha Lane Fox, the 27- year-old chief operating officer of lastminute says: \"We are thrilled that someone with Allan's track record of leadership in customer-focused businesses is joining us. Allan is someone we have respected for some time. As we talked to him about our vision it soon became clear that he would be extremely valuable in helping us to provide an even better service for our customers.\" </p> <p>Ronald Cohen, of venture capitalists Apax Partners, agrees that dot.coms are waking up to the value of experience. \"Young entrepreneurs are coming in and asking for experienced people; increasingly they are realising that they need this to get the business to the stock markets.\" </p> <p>And Charlotte Thorne, author of the Industrial Society report, says: \"The current requirement is for knowledge. Businesses need people who can employ their experience and understanding, their networks and their strategic vision to add value to organisations.\" She makes the point that businesses set up by entrepreneurs in their early 50s are twice as likely to survive as those started by people aged 20-25 and that by 2020 one in four of the workforce will be aged 50 or above. </p> <p>But are those who are bricks and mortar worldly wise readily able to transfer their skills to the virtual realm? </p> <p>Graham Woolley, aged 54, had spent most of his working life as a management consultant until he went into semi-retirement last year. His CV boasts that he has been director of business solutions at CGNU Insurance, and has also been principal of PricewaterhouseCoopers' management consultancy di vision - and that his skills and experience include analysing problems and issues, creating and implementing original solutions and organising third-party suppliers. </p> <p>He is now acting as a consultant to FashionNightmare.com, a website which aims to stimulate, educate, entertain and empower female teenagers, launched later this month. </p> <p>\"I was running a project employing Kath's (Kathleen Nickels, founder of FashionNightmare) husband. He said that he thought I was just the kind of person who could help the company get off the ground and I was interested in getting involved in a project. To date I have mainly been involved in forward planning and making sure that services are delivered. </p> <p>\"It's a kind of 'sorting out any messes' role - before me, Kath went to family and friends to try to get issues sorted out, but it is what I have spent most of my career doing. The biggest issue so far for FashionNightmare has been that it has not had enough money.\" </p> <p>He is not being paid for his input, but has taken an equity share in the company instead: \"I have a much more personal stake than I would have if it was just a matter of investment,\" he says. </p> <p>The decision-making process is essentially the same as with a traditional style company, so his experience is directly relevant, and his years in the business world mean that he can play a smoothing role. </p> <p>Ms Nickels has found that the process of raising money, finding the right team, managing third-party suppliers and actually launching a website has been more torturous than she had expected, even with her strong business background. She says that taking on Mr Woolley was one of the best long-term moves she has made so far in her bid to launch the site. </p> <p>Although she has been a management consultant - with US group Marakon, working both in the States and the UK, and writing the business model should not have been a problem, she found herself proposing ideas which, as a consultant, she would have pooh-poohed. </p> <p>\"It's amazing, now that I'm on my own, how much self-doubt creeps in and how excited I am when someone thinks what I'm doing is a good idea. Also, I did not go to business school, which is where I think the majority of strong networks are built. </p> <p>\"When you start out there are plenty of cynics, the kind of people who have just got their MBA and need to prove that they know more about the internet than you. They just want to rain on your parade and you need to be able to spot that. </p> <p>\"But what you really need is people who know a lot and will be able to criticise, but their criticism will be constructive.\" </p> <p>She adds that Mr Woolley's involvement also encouraged backers. \"I had to tell my cousin, who had been helping me out, that her CV was not going to get us funding. It's definitely true that backers will go for an A team with a B idea but never a B team with an A idea. </p> <p>\"But it is a catch 22 situation - you can't get people without funding, but you can't get funding without the people there in the first place.\" </p> <p>But most important is the guiding hand of someone used to toughing out hard times in business: \"It has been a constantly changing dynamic, like a box of puzzle pieces which keep changing size. It is exhilarating when people promise money or support, but when that then fails to materialise quickly, or at all, the lows are really low. Having Graham around has helped me put it all into perspective.\" </p> <p>She would now offer two main pieces of advice to an internet startee: ensure that one of the first members of staff taken on is a technology expert: \"I tried to launch without this and failed. I now have a person who has 20 years' experience,\" she adds. </p> <p>Secondly, find a mentor and get them on board as a non-executive director. \"It helps to have contacts, but it is far more helpful to have advice and cheerleaders.\"</p> <p><strong>Windows of opportunity: why even Bill Gates may face an age-old problem in his 30s</strong> </p> <p>Ageism is rife in the IT sector despite huge skills shortages, says a new survey by the Employers' Forum on Age, writes Liz Stuart . Although 65% of the 1,400 IT professionals questioned said their company finds it difficult to recruit staff, more companies are refusing to take on older people, many of whom have the necessary skills. More than four in five thought the government should do more to stop ageism in the workplace. </p> <p>Sam Mercer, campaign director of the EFA, says the research also shows that 88% of people said mixed-aged teams work better than teams comprised solely of younger workers. \"The IT industry is particularly guilty of ageism. An article in a computer trade magazine said all employees over 50 should be sacked because they do not have the right skills, but our survey refutes that.</p> <p>\"The government's immigration initiative could help to close this skills gap but it's not enough on its own. If the government and IT industry are serious about addressing skills shortages they should work towards changing a culture undervaluing the contribution of employees as young as 35.\"</p> <p>The research also showed an alarming definition of the term \"older\": 21% thought an employee is an older worker by the age of 35, which would put Bill Gates in this category.</p>",
  "<b>The facts </b> <p> Mark Burman is a 29-year-old senior scientific researcher living in London, in a quandary about what to do with investments and endowments. </p> <p>He has been working full time since he graduated in 1991 and now earns around \u00a329,000. His major outgoings are his social life, holidays and his car. \"I basically want to have enough money to allow me to do what I want to do.\" </p> <p>He rents, but still pays into two endowment policies (around \u00a3100 a month in total) with a current value of \u00a38,000, hangovers from two previous flats he owned in Leeds. He has a company pension with his present job and transferred a sum from his previous employer's scheme, giving him around four years of contributions. </p> <p> Savings total \u00a36,000 plus \"a few\" shares from this and his previous employment packages. He does not currently hold any Isas, Peps or Tessas. </p> <p>His sole debt is a car loan taken out 18 months ago, on which he pays 9% a month, or \u00a3120, although he never pays off his credit card in full, a NatWest combined Visa and Mastercard, with a rate of 19.4%. He currently owes \u00a3600 on this. </p> <p>He has three current accounts, one of which he opened recently to operate as a share buying fund. \"I would put a percentage of money at risk, but I can't afford to lose much,\" he says, adding that he would like investments to be in fairly liquid form and would expect to tie up money for around five years. </p> <p>He would like to get rid of the endowment policies and put the money into an Isa instead: \"I think I would get a better return.\" He would also like to find a financial adviser to manage a small share portfolio. </p> <p><b>The solution</b></p> <p>Many people think that the tax breaks on an Isa are better than an endowment, but the tax credits on an Isa are equal to only about 0.25% for a basic rate payer, which may mean he is better off keeping the endowment. </p> <p>By trading it in, he could indeed invest the proceeds into an Isa, but that would mean him using up his Isa allowance. Keeping the endowment he would not only be keeping an investment free of capital gains and income tax, but also keep the life cover element of his policy, which could be useful if he decides to buy another property.</p> <p>He has some shares from his previous and current employers which could potentaily be wrapped in an Isa. He also has \u00a36,000 in cash savings, \u00a33,000 of which could be put into a cash Isa, where they would earn a better rate. The remainder of the money could be used to pay off his credit card, leaving \u00a32,400 for \"rainy day\" cash.</p> <p>He says he wants to invest small sums of money in the stock market and is looking for a broker to do this for him, but given the small amounts involved it is very unlikely he would find anyone to manage his portfolio. The best idea would be to look at a share dealing service on the internet.</p> <p>There are other considerations, too. He has a very expensive credit card and he may be better considering one of the cheaper cards, such as Egg, RBS Advanta and Cahoot.</p> <p>And his pension could be looked at.

  "<p> It hardly comes as news this week that many jockeys suffer from eating disorders. As Richard Dunwoody's autobiography reveals, the pressure to maintain weight at consistently low levels can result, as it did in his case, in anorexia, and it seems to be common for jockeys to struggle before races to shed pounds by taking diuretics and laxatives, and by sweating in saunas. </p> <p>On the same theme at the other end of the bathroom scales, newspapers across the Atlantic this week reported new efforts by medical researchers to discover ways of controlling America's national plague of obesity. It seems that telling people to eat less and exercise more - the obvious remedy - is ineffective; in a culture of self-gratification, unused to personal restraint and surrounded by mountains of fat and sugar in the form of cheap ready-to-eat foods, people want to eat and be slim: they want to follow their hamburgers and ice-creams with a pill which blocks absorption of the resulting intestinal chyme. </p> <p>Some theories identify the link between love, comfort and food in early life as the source of eating problems, because the ready availability of food is a standing inducement to self-administered doses of reassurance and affirmation. We also have evolutionary instincts telling us to gorge in times of plenty in case times of dearth follow, which in the rich west they now rarely do. </p> <p>The combination of instinct with psychological residues of childhood pleasure makes it surprising that obesity is not more common. It is nevertheless a chief symptom of \"affluenza\", the disease of wealth, as shown by the saying, \"The poor man must walk to get meat for his stomach, but the rich man must walk to get stomach for his meat.\" </p> <p>Before modern, technologised medicine, a doctor's best prescription was moderation of regimen. To eat frugally and drink wisely, to exercise and to ensure enough refreshing sleep, was the height of wisdom - and remains so to this day. Hippocrates, first doyen of physicians, enjoined just such moderation more than two millennia ago, pointing out that not only is it the best guarantee of good health, but therefore of all that attends it: a clear mind, an equable temper, and a relish for life. Modern medical science has caught up with him in noting that some laboratory creatures - mice and fruit flies, principally - live much longer lives if given reduced-calorie diets, making them the experimental analogues of the philosophers of antiquity. </p> <p>None of this reduces the truth that eating is a great and important pleasure, especially when done well, and among friends. It converts pessimists into optimists, reconciles enemies, advances business, educates the aesthetic sensibilities of mankind, and promotes the welfare of society - for, as the Burmese proverb has it, \"A full belly supports moral precepts.\" One Jacobean theologian agreed: dining well is a way of getting to heaven, he said: he that dines well sleeps well, and he that sleeps well does not sin. </p> <p>Dining in good company is the best kind of eating. Hosts have to prepare by cooking dishes, chilling wine, setting cutlery, thinking how to seat guests for amity and conversation. </p> <p>But what about guests? In his Dinner of the Seven Wise Men, Plutarch remarks that a guest must also prepare; not for the Sybarites' reason - they needed their invitations a year in advance to plan what to wear - but so that one can ready the mind and character. \"Unpalatable food and wine can be declined,\" says Plutarch, \"but a boorish guest at dinner ruins wine and meat for all.\" </p> <p>This constitutes an entirely different eating problem, but one as important to overcome; for as Plutarch adds, \"The man of sense who dines out does not go merely to fill himself like a pot, but to take his part well in listening, speaking, and exchanging ideas.\" This remark indicates what we must be to be good guests at the banquet of life: no less than thoughtful, open-minded, and informed. </p>",
  "Australians do give a XXXX for good beer, after all. Cooper's Sparkling Ale, with roots in the early days of the country, has survived the icy flood of Castlemaine, Foster's and other sweetish, unmemorable lagers to become a cult drink. Naturally conditioned in bottle and keg, it tends to be cloudy, due to its yeast sediment, and has burst out of its Adelaide heartland to become a national brand. <p>Thomas Cooper emigrated to Australia from Yorkshire in 1852. His wife, the daughter of an innkeeper, brewed at home while Thomas worked as a cobbler and later as a dairyman. When she fell ill, Thomas tried his hand at brewing, and his homebrew so impressed friends that he set up as a commercial brewer. </p> <p>The brewery is still run by members of the family. Sparkling Ale (5.8%) is brewed from pale and crystal malts, cane sugar and Pride Of Ringwood hops from Tasmania. After primary fermentation, it is given a dose of wort, to encourage a strong second fermentation. The mature beer is intensely fruity, with apple and banana dominating, a peppery hop aroma, citric fruit in the mouth, and a long, quenching finish. </p> <p>Cooper's portfolio has since broadened to include lagers, and pale and dark ales. Its other classic is a 6.8% bottle-conditioned stout, which features roast malt alongside pale and crystal, with a big aroma and a flavour dominated by coffee, roasted grain and liquorice. </p> <p>Japan, on the other hand, didn't even begin brewing beer until the mid-19th century, and has come a long way in a short time: there are now dark and pale lagers, stouts and black beers, as well as a growing number of micro-breweries and brew pubs to challenge the local big four, Asahi, Kirin, Sapporo and Suntory. The Japanese giants are best known in Britain for their pale lagers (Kirin, for example, is brewed under licence by Charles Wells of Bedford). Sapporo (5%) is the most characterful, with a rich, rounded juicy maltiness balanced by aromatic hops. </p> <p>Tiger Beer from Singapore, meanwhile, will bring a tear to the eye of any old colonialists still around. It refreshed the British in the 30s and second world war, and was made famous by Anthony Burgess in his novel, Time For A Tiger, a slogan that was later adopted by the brewery. The clean, quenching 5.1% beer has some good hop notes. </p> <p>Indonesia's main beer, Bintang, has a similar colonial resonance, not least for the powerful Dutch influence, right down to the familiar Dutch-style stubby bottle. The 5% beer has a pronounced perfumy aroma and palate, and is decidedly malty with only a light hint of hops. </p> <p>The US, more than anywhere else, has undergone a beer revolution in recent years. It now boasts some 1,300 breweries - more even than Germany - producing a vast range of brews that at last brings choice to a country that was too long dominated by the bland offerings of Budweiser, Coors and Miller. The West Coast, in particular, stands out, with splendid beers now available from San Francisco to Seattle, notably Pike Place's Pale Ale, Pyramid's Espresso Stout and Wheaten Ale. Portland, Oregon, alone has 20 breweries, and can lay claim to being brewing capital of the world. Look out for Portland Brewing's MacTarnahan's Gold Medal and BridgePort's India Pale Ale and Old Knucklehead Barley Wine. </p> <p>But this new wave of US craft brewers is so busy meeting the clamour at home that few of their beers cross the Atlantic. Fortunately, the man credited with launching the revival, Fritz Maytag of the Anchor Brewery, San Francisco, does export to Britain. He used his share of the family washing machine fortune to rescue an ailing brewery that made a local speciality, Steam Beer, which first saw the light of day in the California gold rush of the 1890s, when prospectors from the East Coast brought with them a taste for the new-style lager beer. San Francisco lacked the technology and the ice to make beer by cold fermentation, so a hybrid was produced: a beer made at an ale temperature but using a lager yeast. Anchor Steam is 5% alcohol, bronze in colour and made from pale and crystal malts with Northern Brewer hops. It has a complex malty-nutty aroma, with more malt and light citrus fruit in the mouth, and a lingering, hop-dominated finish. </p> <p>Two other Anchor beers, made as conventional ales, are the glorious Liberty Ale (6.1%) - which uses big, bold American Cascade hops that add a citrus note and which was produced to commemorate Paul Revere's ride of 1775 - and Anchor Porter (5%), which conversely owes a lot to the British, being influenced by the 18th-century English style. </p> <p>\u0095 Beers listed as available in the UK are on sale at the Beer Shop, 14 Pitfield Street, London N1 (020-7739 3701). Other specialists: Small Beer, Grimsby (01472 699234) and Lincoln (01522 528628); Beer Ritz, Knaresborough (01423 862850); and branches of Oddbins.</p>",
  "Despite having a name that inspires visions of some glamorous 40s movie star, Traci des Jardins is, in fact, one of San Francisco's hottest chefs. Her restaurant, Jardini\u00e8re, a short walk from San Francisco's City Hall, is a marked success in a city that, though it loves to eat, more often than not chews up and spits out even the most experienced of restaurateurs. <p>The style and decor is laid-back California meets London's East End with a detour through New York's Tribeca, and the food wins praise all around. Being a female chef, and working on the US West Coast, one might imagine her serving what they call \"girl food\", all fussy and light, or \"California cuisine\", with fusion vinaigrettes, roasted veggie pastas and endless goat's cheese salads. But that would be wrong. With her pulled-back blonde hair, quiet voice, and serious demeanour, des Jardins heads her large team with strict but kindly professionalism. </p> <p>Named 1995 Rising Star Chef of the Year by the prestigious James Beard Foundation, the diminutive des Jardins previously ran Rubicon, a swank San Francisco restaurant owned by Francis Ford Coppola, Robert De Niro and Robin Williams. Even so, she shuns all of that fickle \"flavour of the month\" label common to so many top-class restaurants. It's an attitude that reflects a classic French training - des Jardins took the route of traditional apprenticeship, along the way working for such legendary establishments in France as Fr\u00e8res Troisgros and L'Arpege. </p> <p>Her menu, then, is built on solid foundations of classic French techniques - hearty food with a sensual nature; rather aptly, given her name, it also revolves around the freshest vegetables the local area has to offer. Risotto comes rich with sweetcorn and chanterelles, or resplendent with root vegetables; fish rests on a bed of leek pur\u00e9e and oil-crushed potatoes, and is sauced with curry-scented pumpkin; shortribs, a succulent and rich cut of beef, rests on a bed of celeriac pur\u00e9e with a salad of chanterelles and chestnuts. </p> <p>Indeed, des Jardins gathers flavours for her customers with an earnestness that is as endearing as it is demanding. She also credits them with knowing what's what. \"The more educated the palate,\" she says, \"the more willing customers are to eat, and appreciate, different and unusual offerings.\" Sure, you'll find the odd fusion vinaigrette (such as Thai vinaigrette splashed on to lobster and melon salad with fennel and tomato), but you'll also find pork chops with black-eyed peas, lamb loin with fennel-tomato confit and rosemary jus, wild salmon with fresh cranberry beans and herb pur\u00e9e - it's all classic French, yet, in the style of modern Californian cuisine, there is also a twist of flavour, a splash of surprise, a shock of something delicious and unexpected. </p> <p>But you won't find strange combinations tossed together just because they look good in menu-speak. Des Jardins is quite emphatic about this: \"Food has to have a reference, often historical, for ingredients to work together: Vietnamese and French, for instance. You need to keep traditional sensibilities. Some people are able to understand different cuisines in depth, and so combine them with grace, but too many cooks just toss things together because they sound good - let's face it,\" she adds, \"some things just shouldn't go together.\" </p> <p>At Jardini\u00e8re, des Jardins does something very brave: she offers a cheeseboard. To understand just how courageous this is, remember that, in California, cholesterol is a dirty word - so much so that, each time I go there, I half-expect cheese to have been outlawed. Not only does she offer a cheeseboard, she even has her own affinage room, where between 30-50 ripening cheeses loll about at just the right temperature for just the right length of time to achieve their own distinctive charm. </p> <p>\"The American palate is becoming more refined,\" explains des Jardins. \"Twenty years ago, wonderfully-roasted coffee beans, excellent bread and well-grown vegetables were a rarity; today, they are expected. The same holds true with cheese.\" And if the daring cheeseboard doesn't grab you, there is always a choice of glorious puddings: caramelised bananas atop banana ice cream and chocolate hazelnut tart; fig-pecan crumble with port ice cream; cr\u00e8me brl\u00e9e topped with blackberries ... </p> <p>Des Jardins grew up in a tiny Central Valley town, and the home table was both Spanish- and French-influenced by virtue of a Mexican mother and Louisianan father. The experience had a profound effect: \"I came to cheffing fuelled by a passion for food, simple as that,\" she says. \"I never wanted to do anything else.\" </p> <p> All recipes serve eight. </p> <p><b> AHI TUNA TARTARE NICOISE WITH POTATO AND OVEN-DRIED TOMATOES</b></p> <p> For the oven-dried tomatoes:</p> <p> 450g plum tomatoes, blanched, cored, peeled, deseeded and quartered <br> 60ml extra-virgin olive oil <br> 2 sprigs fresh thyme, leaves only <br> Salt and pepper </p> <p>Pre-heat the oven to 160C/325F/ gas mark 3. Lightly oil a flat baking tray and sprinkle with thyme, salt and pepper. Place the tomato quarters on the tray and cook for two to three hours, until lightly 'dried'. </p> <p> 900g sashimi-quality Ahi tuna <br> 1 bulb fennel, finely diced <br> 4 spring onions, thinly sliced <br> 30g black olives, pitted and roughly chopped <br> 55g oven-dried tomatoes, chopped (see recipe above) <br> 1 small handful basil leaves, finely chopped <br> 225g new potatoes, boiled, peeled and finely diced <br> 125ml extra-virgin olive oil <br> 3 tbsp balsamic vinegar <br> Salt and pepper</p> <p>Remove all the sinew from the tuna, dice the flesh into 1cm cubes and place in a stainless-steel bowl. Add the fennel, spring onions, olives, oven-dried tomatoes and basil. Mix, and season generously. </p> <p>Make a vinaigrette by whisking the olive oil slowly into the vinegar, then season. Season the potato with salt, pepper and a little extra-virgin olive oil, then place in a ring mold or on a platter. Add the vinaigrette to the tuna mixture, mix and adjust the seasoning as necessary. Place the tuna on top of the potatoes and garnish with more basil leaves. </p> <p> <b> ROCK SHRIMP GAZPACHO SALAD </b></p> <p>900g rock shrimp (other shrimp may be substituted) <br> 1 red bell pepper, seeds removed <br> 1 yellow bell pepper, seeds removed <br> 1 sweet onion, peeled <br> 4 sticks celery, de-stringed <br> 1 cucumber <br> 1 bulb fennel <br> 450g tomatoes <br> bunch flat-leaf parsley, washed, picked and cut into a chiffonade <br> bunch fresh coriander, washed, picked and cut into a chiffonade <br> Cayenne pepper <br> Salt and black pepper <br> 2 lemons, juiced <br> 125ml extra-virgin olive oil <br> 1 small loaf French bread</p> <p>Pre-heat the oven to 200C/400F/ gas mark 6. In a large saut\u00e9 pan, heat a little olive oil over medium-high heat. Add the shrimp and saut\u00e9 until just cooked through: this should take about three or four minutes. Season to taste. Transfer to a bowl, cover and refrigerate. </p> <p>Cut the peppers, onion, celery, cucumber and fennel into fine julienne strips. Place the vegetables in a bowl and chill. Cut the outer tomato flesh into a julienne. Remove the seeds, and pur\u00e9e the rest of the tomato in a blender or food processor. Pour into cheesecloth hanging above a small bowl for about an hour. Squeeze the remaining pur\u00e9e from the cheesecloth and add three tablespoons of olive oil, a tablespoon lemon juice, and salt, pepper and cayenne to taste. Chill. </p> <p>Make a lemon vinaigrette by whisking together the lemon juice and remaining olive oil. Season to taste. </p> <p>Cut the bread into very tiny croutons. Place on a baking sheet and cook in the hot oven until lightly toasted. Toss with a little olive oil, salt and pepper. </p> <p>To compose the dish, toss all the vegetables with the shrimp. Dress with the vinaigrette, salt and pepper, and stir in half of the fresh herbs. Place the tomato 'sauce' on a plate, spoon the shrimp mixture on top, then garnish with croutons and the rest of the herbs. </p> <p><b> RISOTTO WITH WINTER VEGETABLES AND SAUTEED MUSHROOMS </b></p> <p> 1 small winter squash <br> 12 tbsp butter, divided <br> 1 small white onion, diced <br> 800g Arborio rice <br> 250ml white wine <br> 2 litres salted chicken stock, boiling (set aside 60ml) <br> 1 parsnip, peeled and diced <br> 1 bulb celery root, peeled and diced <br> 30g Parmesan, grated <br> 450g assorted mushrooms, cleaned and sliced <br> bunch flat-leaf parsley, washed, picked and chopped</p> <p>Preheat the oven to 190C/375F/gas mark 5. Cut the squash in half and remove any seeds. Peel and dice one half only. Put a tablespoon of butter in the other half, season, then place, cut-side down, on a baking tray and cook for 30-45 minutes until soft and tender. Spoon the cooked pulp into a blender and pur\u00e9e. Set aside. </p> <p>Now you can start making the risotto. In a large, heavy-based saucepan, melt four tablespoons of the butter. Add the onion and sweat over medium heat until translucent and tender. Add the rice and sweat gently. Add the wine and reduce completely, stirring constantly. Start adding the stock, a ladle at a time, stirring all the time. </p> <p>While watching over the risotto, sweat the parsnip in a tablespoon of butter. In a separate pan, sweat the celery root in another tablespoon of butter. In a third pan, sweat the diced squash in another tablespoon of butter until soft. In a small frying pan, saut\u00e9 the mushrooms in two tablespoons of the butter. Season each with salt and pepper. When the rice is almost cooked, after about 13 minutes, stir in the parsnip, celery root, squash and squash pur\u00e9e. Add the Parmesan, and season. </p> <p>Add the remaining chicken stock to the mushroom pan, reduce a little, then stir in the remaining butter and the parsley. Spoon the risotto into large bowls, and top with mushrooms. </p> <p><b> GOAT'S CHEESE AND HONEY FILO TART WITH SAUTEED SEASONAL FRUIT </b></p> <p> For the goat's cheese filling: </p> <p>450g mild goat's cheese <br> 1 egg <br> 8 tbsp honey <br> 2 tbsp all-purpose flour <br> 1 tbsp Grand Marnier <br> 1 pinch nutmeg </p> <p>Combine all the ingredients except the flour in a bowl, and mix with a wooden spoon. (Do not try to do this in a food processor as it will liquefy.) Gradually sift in the flour and mix thoroughly. Refrigerate until ready to use. </p> <p>For the filo dough: </p> <p>225g butter, clarified <br> 1 box shop-bought filo pastry <br> Sugar</p> <p>Clarified butter is very easy to make, and is by far the best thing to use here as it creates a crispier filo. Simply melt the butter, then set it in a warm place to settle for about 15-20 minutes. Once it has fully settled, it will look like oil with a film floating on top. Skim off this film, and spoon the clear butter below into a clean, dry container. Stop when you get to the watery substance, which should be discarded. </p> <p>To make the tart base, place a sheet of filo pastry on a board, brush with clarified butter, then sprinkle with a little sugar. Lay another sheet of filo on top, and repeat the process. Top this with a third sheet of filo brushed with butter. Make a second three-tier layer of filo the same way for the tart top. </p> <p>To assemble the tarts: </p> <p>Preheat the oven to 225C/425F/gas mark 7. Place the layered filo on a clean and dry surface. Depending on the diameter of your pastry, you should be able to make four to six tarts per filo square. Cut the filo into 13cm circles. Place two tablespoons of the cheese mixture in the middle of each round, and top with another pastry circle. Using a paring knife, seal the edges by folding them over each other. Repeat for each tart. Bake for seven to 10 minutes, until golden brown. </p> <p>For the fruit garnish: </p> <p><b> Use your imagination and nature's seasons to give you the inspiration for this garnish. You'll need the following: </b></p> <p> 225-250g fresh fruit, peeled, seeded and cut into attractive shapes <br> Dried fruit (optional) Nuts (optional) <br> 60g butter <br> 5 tbsp sugar <br> 125ml white wine <br> 1 vanilla pod, split</p> <p>Combine the sugar, wine and vanilla in a saucepan, bring to the boil, lower the heat and reduce by two-thirds. Strain through a coarse strainer. Melt the butter in a saut\u00e9 pan over medium heat. Add the fruit (any hard fruit, such as pears or apples, should be added first, and cooked until just soft; softer fruit should go in last, so it does not turn mushy). Place some fruit and a little of the cooking syrup on a plate, then top with a warm tart.</p> <p>\u0095 Traci des Jardins is chef at Jardini\u00e8re, 300 Grove Street, San Francisco, tel 001 415 861 5555.</p>",
  "<p>The tok-tok-tok of a stick banging against a hollowed-out wooden block outside my house was clashing with the more sonorous timbre of a small gong being struck repeatedly. Further down the street, a high-pitched whine was competing with the blander sounds of a man banging a spoon against a plate, another banging a spoon against a glass, a third banging an indiscernible object against some wood and a fourth who seemed to be shouting, \"Me! Me! Me!\" </p> <p>This grating cacophony, which varies slightly every day, depending on who is around, means only one thing - lunch, quite literally, is on its way down the road. Each sound is the signature tune of one of the dozens of food vendors trundling his (they are almost never her) wares around the streets. That tok-tok-tok means that the meatballs, usually with noodles, are approaching. The gong signifies ice cream. The whine comes from a copper steamer used to cook rice flour and coconut cakes. The spoon rapped on a plate means either a mixture of congealed sticky rice, tofu and other delights, or chicken soup and rice. The spoon against glass means desserts, particularly fruit jelly drinks, while the banging on wood is usually fried rice. Me! Me! Me! indicates not an annoyingly self-centred exhibitionist but a fried noodle seller (\"mie\" means noodles). </p> <p>These ubiquitous kitchens are little more than a two-wheeled trolley, known as a kaki lima (five legs). The legs in question are the trolley's two wheels, the wooden stand that supports it at one end when stationary and the chef's own two feet. Despite being the slowest thing on the road, they seem to have carte blanche to go where they like, when they like - it's not uncommon to come across an unlit kaki lima going the wrong way down the fast lane of a triple-lane thoroughfare at night. Any collision would be blamed on the car driver. </p> <p>Kaki limas, their sounds and drivers' habits are but one facet of a street food culture that is, unsurprisingly, as varied as the country's 13,600 islands. In Minahasa, say, a region of northern Sulawesi, the wags say that the only things with legs that are not eaten on the street are the chairs and tables. In West Sumatra, the home of Padang cuisine, the food comes in two main varieties: very spicy and mouth-burning hot. And across the heartland of Java, most stalls cater to the popular refrain, \"Belum makan nasi, belum makan\" - \"If I haven't eaten rice, I haven't eaten\". </p> <p>Despite such regional variations, common themes run throughout the country. The first is that street food is a feast for all the senses, not just the tastebuds. As the kaki limas highlight, sound is as important as anything else in differentiating the choices on offer. Visual elegance, too (both of the food on the plate and the stall), is crucial to success, although it tends to go by the wayside once a stall is established. The heady aroma of freshly cooked food is a common feature at any bus station or market, and does wonders to dull the stench of reeking drains, smoke-belching buses and sweaty people. Cutlery is an undesired luxury - the preferred means of eating is using the right hand (the left is reserved for other tasks, toilet paper being scarce in rural Indonesia) to compress food into a ball and pop it into the mouth. </p> <p>Food from most provinces can be found all over the country. Padang food is one example, as are the Warung Tegal stalls, named after the central Java town where they originated, that serve basic rice and noodle dishes. As a result, any Indonesian who is far from home can usually find something they recognise and are comfortable eating. This hints at another strong feature of Indonesian street food: it has changed little over the years, because Indonesians tend to be conservative eaters. Most actually hate cooking, but they do know what they like and are not inclined to experiment. </p> <p>Mr Sastro typifies this attitude. He opened his warung in Jakarta in 1958, and has not altered the recipes (chicken fried rice and two types of fried noodles) since: \"I've never even thought about changing things. People like what I cook and I don't want to risk losing them.\" </p> <p>Like is a major understatement. People come from miles around to eat his rice and noodles or to grab a takeaway portion wrapped in a banana leaf. \"I don't mind waiting half an hour for my food,\" says Eduard Harlen, who had come six miles on the back of a motorbike taxi to get his supper. \"He gives generous helpings that are delicious.\" Word of Mr Sastro's offerings reached society's upper echelons decades ago, and it is not uncommon to see ministers' cars parked outside. \"Usually, they only send their drivers, but sometimes the bigwigs come themselves,\" says Mr Sastro. </p> <p>Price is another reason for the lack of innovation. With more than 50 million Indonesians earning less than \u00a31.50 a week, much of the population cannot afford anything but the basics. It is uncanny how this lowest-common-denominator factor has prevailed, and it certainly shows no sign of being superseded by any nouvelle trends. </p> <p>The most amazing aspect of Indonesian street food, however, is what it does not include: namely, the spices (nutmeg, cinnamon and cloves) that first put the archipelago on the global map some 600 years ago and that prompted Christopher Columbus to sail across the Atlantic in search of the eastern Indonesian Banda islands. Few can explain why they are not used, except, perhaps, that they do not go particularly well with either rice or noodles. </p> <p>Fear of catching some dread lurgy is what prompts most foreigners to avoid warungs and kaki limas like the plague, and head instead to the smarter hotels and restaurants. But, more often than not, the latter, if anything, pose a greater threat to your health, because the food is prepared hours in advance and just left out, whereas on the street the food is cooked in front of you. </p> <p>So, if it's a genuine taste of Indonesian cuisine you're after, don't head for a hotel. Just walk down the street and take your pick from the dozens of meals on offer. Or, if you're feeling lazy, just wait for the trolley orchestra to come your way.</p> <p><strong> Tips</strong></p> <p> It is practically impossible to create truly authentic Indonesian street food in any indoor kitchen because there is no artificial replacement for the magic je ne sais quoi that is picked up in the pan over years of outdoor use on a grubby kerosene stove and never properly washed off. </p> <p>Indonesians love spicy food, and usually add chilli sauce to everything. This can kill the flavour, so it might be advisable to go easy on the chillies, especially the spicier green ones. </p> <p>Indonesian meat is often very tough. To make it tender, people boil it for an hour or so before frying or grilling. </p> <p>Another common ingredient is MSG - when following recipes that include MSG in Indonesian cookbooks, it might be better to omit it. </p> <p>In recipes that stipulate goat, lamb is a perfectly acceptable alternative. </p> <p><strong> Mr Sastro's fried rice or noodles </strong></p> <p> Per portion. Melt some margarine in a wok. Add chopped garlic and red onion, and any herbs and spices you like (Mr Sastro uses a little bit of cardamom, coriander and lemongrass), then cook until the aroma starts to tickle your nostrils. Throw in as much cooked rice (or noodles) as you want, some boiled chicken cut into pieces, finely chopped white cabbage, a tablespoon or two of chicken stock, some beaten egg and a teaspoon or two of crushed fresh chilli. Season with a little vinegar, sweet soy sauce and salt and pepper. Mr Sastro boils the chicken gizzards, chops them into slices and mixes a few into each portion. Serve with lettuce leaves and sliced tomato and cucumber. To make it a special, add a turned-over fried egg. Most younger chefs use vegetable oil instead of margarine. </p> <p><strong> Satay </strong></p> <p> Use any meat, or prawns. The meat should be cut into bite-sized portions and marinaded for at least three hours. Some street chefs use more than two dozen ingredients in their marinades. The basics are two tablespoons of chilli oil, two tablespoons of sweet soy sauce, half a teaspoon of lemon juice, one crushed clove of garlic and a teaspoon of salt. Then add whatever takes your fancy, such as ginger, grated candlenuts, tamarind juice, coriander, shrimp paste softened in warm water, chopped chilli, red onions, pepper, a bayleaf. It's best to cook the meat over charcoal, but you can cheat and use a gas cooker. </p> <p>Satay is usually served with two sauces: a soy sauce mixed with chopped chillies, red onions and a dash of lemon juice; and a peanut sauce. There is a wide variety of peanut sauce recipes, but an easy way out is to use the same one as used for gado-gado (below), only without the coconut milk. </p> <p><strong> Gado-Gado</strong></p> <p> An Indonesian salad that is a meal in itself. Tofu, cabbage, beansprouts, egg, spinach, green beans, watercress, cucumber, carrots. Some Indonesians like to cook their gado-gado, others like it part-cooked, and others still prefer it raw, apart from the tofu, which should be fried in oil until brown, and the egg, which should be hardboiled. There is no correct answer. Once the salad is assembled, pour over the peanut sauce. </p> <p><strong> Peanut sauce </strong></p> <p> Ingredients: 1 tbsp vegetable oil, 1 clove crushed garlic, green chilli (amount depends on your tastebuds), 1 tsp brown sugar, 1 tbsp tamarind juice, tsp salt, 1 chopped onion, 4 tbsp chunky peanut butter, 1 small piece lemongrass, 1 dab shrimp paste, 1 tsp sweet soy sauce, 3 tbsp coconut milk. Fry the onion and garlic in oil. Mix the peanut butter with 150ml water and bring to the boil. Remove from the heat, add the chilli, lemongrass, brown sugar, shrimp paste, tamarind juice, soy sauce and salt. Add the onion and garlic. Stir in the coconut milk. Simmer over low heat. If it is not smooth enough, liquidise it, but the chunks add a little extra something. </p> <p><strong> Beef rendang </strong></p> <p> A Padang dish. Ingredients: 1 tbsp vegetable oil, 1 tsp turmeric, 1 stick lemongrass, outer leaves discarded, bruised and chopped, 3 lime leaves, 2 red chillies, crushed, 425ml coconut milk, 3 cloves garlic crushed, tsp ginger, 450g beef loin, thinly sliced, 1 tsp salt, 1 bayleaf. Saut\u00e9 the garlic, turmeric, ginger and lemongrass in oil. Add meat, chilli and salt. Add the coconut milk and bayleaf, cover and simmer until the sauce is thick. Best served hot, but is also eaten cold</p>",
  "<p>Countries with a Pacific coastline produce some of the most provocative wines in the world. Even Thailand knocks out a couple of reasonable tipples: <strong> Chatemp Blanc 2541 Summer Harvest</strong> and <strong> Chatemp Rouge 2541 Summer Harvest</strong>. They are made by a Frenchman, Laurent Metge-Toppin, from vineyards so fecund that they produce two crops a year. They rate 13 points out of 20, and you can find them in Thai restaurants and some London stockists - namely, Gerry's in Old Compton Street, W1, Queen's Club Wines in W14, and Whistlestop Food &amp; Wine at various large railway termini - for between \u00a36.99 and \u00a39.95. </p> <p>Mexico doesn't sound up to much at first, either, but LA Cetto in Baja California, has consistently produced blisteringly fruity reds and the current one in form is the <strong> 1997 Petite Sirah </strong> (17 points, \u00a34.99): it has hugely individual fruit, is slightly spicy and richly succulent, and has fantastically alert tannins. This exceptional wine is available at Somerfield and Waitrose. </p> <p>Don't scoff: remember, Australia was once as little regarded as Mexico, yet we now have an abundance of its wines to dazzle our palates. <strong> Wynns Coonawarra Shiraz 1997</strong> (16.5 points, Budgens, \u00a36.99) is an invigorating mouthful of high-class fruit. The mineral tanginess is delicious, but what impresses most is the way the fruit spreads itself over the tongue, revealing dry, rich nuances from superb tannins. <strong> Peter Lehmann The Barossa Shiraz 1998</strong> (17 points, Oddbins, Safeway, Waitrose, \u00a36.99) is possibly the most vibrant Shiraz for the money on the market: dry, elegant, deep, beautifully textured. <strong> Woolshed Cabernet/Shiraz/Merlot Coonawarra 1998</strong> (17 points, Safeway, \u00a35.99) has stunning richness and textured fruit of huge depth and charm - a magnificently mouth-watering wine. <strong> Rosemount 'Hill Of Gold' Shiraz Mudgee 1998</strong> (17.5 points, Safeway, Waitrose, \u00a39.99) is a rarity: a Rosemount red with world-class tannins. It has beautifully well-knit fruit, offering a gripping experience. <strong> Voyager Estate Chardonnay 1997</strong> (17.5 points, Waitrose, \u00a310.99) is remarkably chewy, ripe, creamy and subtly vegetal. (Check the vintage, as the 1998 will be phased in soon and the rating applies to the 1997.) Even dear old Spar has a terrific Aussie white: the own-label <strong> Australian Semillon Chardonnay 1999</strong> (16 points, \u00a34.49), which has lovely, oily fruit: bold, thick, rich and purposeful. </p> <p>Two beautifully mature Aussie whites at Wine Rack and Bottoms Up are <strong> Michelton Viognier Rousanne 1997</strong> (17 points, \u00a312.99), which flaunts lovely oily fruit, and <strong> The Willows Vineyard Semillon 1996</strong> (17.5 points, \u00a38.49), which has a captivating, mellow, smoky richness and fine texture. </p> <p>Chile is now also a force on the UK market. <strong> Cono Sur Merlot 1999</strong> (16 points, Asda, Wine Cellar, \u00a34.49-\u00a34.99) has pliant, berried fruit with the texture of velvet. <strong> Santa Rita Triple C 1997</strong> (17 points, Majestic, \u00a310.99) is full of densely-packed, gently savoury plums, pears and apricots, plus leathery tannins.It performs like a crazed claret. </p> <p> <strong> Casa Lapostolle Cuv\u00e9e Alexandre Merlot 1998</strong> (17.5 points, Oddbins, \u00a313.99) is an immense construct, which, as the thoughtful taster gargles it around the molars, seems like some game sauce of quite unusual complexity: savoury, ripe, sweet, then dry to finish. <strong> Valdivieso Single Vineyard Merlot Reserve 1998</strong> (16.5 points, Safeway, \u00a38.99) inspired the tasting note, \"Heaven has arrived!\" and from such metaphysical nonsense you may deduce my overwhelming approval. <strong> Valdivieso Cabernet Sauvignon Reserve 1998</strong> (17 points, Tesco, \u00a36.99) offers coffee, cocoa, herbs, roast meat and lush tannins. It's a generous assembly of great richness. <strong> Caliterra Reserve Syrah 1999</strong> (16.5 points, Tesco, \u00a38.99) has gorgeous spice to its hedgerow fruits (plus plums), combined with savoury tannins to give it serious backbone. This is a wine of consummately well-textured class. <strong> Errazuriz Don Maximiano 1998</strong> (16 points, Tesco, \u00a317.99) requires deep digging in the pocket, but offers deep digging for the tastebuds, too, for it has cassis-edged fruit with superb tannins that give the wine power, concentration and a characterful yet polished personality. </p> <p>And last, from the Chilean neck of the woods, one great white wine: <strong> Casa Lapostolle Chardonnay 1998</strong> (17 points, Oddbins, Unwins, \u00a36.99). It is breathtakingly elegant, subtle, complex and immensely quaffable. It has undertones of ambrosia, and fills the ears with choirs of angels. </p> <p>New Zealand is most blessed by the maritime climate bequeathed by the Pacific, and this shows particularly clearly in the whites (bitingly fresh acids, limpid fruit). <strong> Villa Maria Reserve Clifford Bay Sauvignon Blanc 1999</strong> (16.5 points, Oddbins, \u00a39.99) has the typical grassy aroma leading to ripeness and concentration. <strong> Grove Mill Sauvignon Blanc 1999 </strong> (16.5 points, Safeway, Sainsbury, \u00a37.49) offers superbly clean fruit of compressed gooseberries and minerals. <strong> Villa Maria Private Bin Riesling 1999</strong> (16 points, Thresher, Victoria Wine, \u00a35.99) is young as yet, but deliciously drinkable - not like riesling as we know it from Europe, it has an ineffably exotic and subtle edge to its smooth acids, which will develop more excitingly if cellared for the next eight years (it is also available at Waitrose, but is selling out fast). <strong> Villa Maria Lightly Oaked Chardonnay 1999</strong> (16 points, Thresher, Victoria Wine, \u00a36.99) is plump but not fat, lithe yet not thin, fruity yet not full - it has, then, the classic virtues of the old world along with the purity of expression of the new. And <strong> Villa Maria Private Bin Sauvignon Blanc 1999</strong> (16 points, Thresher, Victoria Wine, \u00a36.99) has great texture and warmth of welcome with a delicious, lively finish. </p> <p>On the Kiwi's red team, there is <strong> Te Mata Estate Cabernet Merlot 1998 </strong> (16.5 points, Wine Rack, Bottoms Up, \u00a38.49), which performs like a great novel, offering plot, character, wit and a great climax. </p> <p>California tells a different but no less involving story. <strong> Kautz-Ironstone Shiraz 1997</strong> (16 points, Majestic, \u00a35.99) is a very vibrant personality of meaty depth and resounding richness: not typically Californian or even Shiraz, but that's its charm. <strong> Fetzer Vineyards Select Zinfandel 1997 </strong> (16.5 points, Oddbins, \u00a37.99) is jammy, spicy, very ripe and awesomely delicious. <strong> Fetzer Sundial Chardonnay 1997</strong> (16 points, Unwins, \u00a35.49) is soft and slightly under-ripe, but gracious as it finishes. <strong> Stonybrook Chardonnay 1998 </strong> (16 points, Booths, \u00a34.99) has lovely plump, ripe fruit - a \"gorgeously demure melonosity\", my tasting notes proclaim. <strong> Bonterra Vineyards Merlot 1997</strong> (16.5 points, Waitrose, \u00a39.99) shows great organic class and polish, with outstanding tannins and acids to balance brilliantly dryly the lashings of sweet fruit. </p> <p>Indeed, if there is a theme to the fine wines from littorally Pacific lands, then this is it: balance. You can taste the cool oceanic nights in the wines from the best vintages. Such nights induce the grapes to produce acids to counter the daylight sugars, which the abundant sunshine guarantees</p>",
  "It's 3.30 on a Thursday afternoon, and I'm sitting in the dimly lit basement of Yo! Below in Soho. I'm here working my way through a line-up of flavoured sakes, which is not as cushy a number as you might think, not least because I'm trying to do so to the deafening background noise of Kim and Vee, the bartenders, practising their karaoke act. What's more, even the surprisingly proficient quality of Vee's singing doesn't quite compensate for the really weird flavours on offer - there's a rather cough-mixturish raspberry sake, a hazelnut one that tastes like pulverised Cadbury's Whole Nut and a gloopy, yeasty \"Pearl\" sake, which looks, er, like spunk, if truth be told. Vee tells me, when she finally pauses for breath, that she prefers the hot-house sake - \"It's good for my voice.\" Well, I wouldn't mind being able to sing as well as her, so that's a pretty strong recommendation. <p>At the moment, flavoured sakes are mainly restricted to Japanese-inspired bars such as Yo! Below, Itsu and Nobu, but wait a few months and you'll see them everywhere - if you don't believe me, remember what happened to flavoured vodkas a few years back. Of course, the Japanese wouldn't touch them with a bargepole, but that doesn't really matter as much as you might think, because they're unlikely to be offered any in a neighbourhood Tokyo bar - these sakes are made in Oregon, where fusion flavours reign supreme. </p> <p>Curiously, it's actually cheaper for a sake producer to set up shop in the US, because the cost of rice there is about a quarter of that in Japan. Unsurprisingly, then, seven of the top Japanese brewers now have production facilities in the country - there is even a sake garden in the Napa Valley. Sake's principle appeal for the health-obsessed American public is that it is low in sulphur and doesn't give you a hangover. So great is its potential, in fact, that Griffith Frost of Sak\u00e9One in Oregon predicts that before long one in five glasses of wine consumed in the US will be a sake - roughly the same figure it currently accounts for globally. </p> <p>Given sake's rather unappealing flavour - at least, to western palates - that might seem a rather implausible, not to say over-optimistic claim, but Ian Haffety of Sheffield-based Distinctive Drinks Company, which distributes the Momokawa range, similarly reckons that the public will rapidly come round to Japan's national tipple. \"People might think that sake is disgusting,\" he admits, \"but then, how many of them would drink vodka or tequila straight? Very few. In cocktails, however, they're the biggest-selling drinks on the market. </p> <p>\"Most people have come across sake only in Japanese restaurants, where it's often very poor quality and served hot,\" continues Haffety. \"But there are lots and lots of different sakes - sweet, dry, unfiltered, flavoured - and you can be as creative with sake as you can with other spirits.\" </p> <p>Cocktails currently being intrepidly promoted by Haffety's company include the vivid blue Tounami (silver sake, blue Cura\u00e7ao, Bombay Sapphire gin, orgeat syrup and milk), Japanese Bulldog (pearl sake, Kahlua, cream and Coca-Cola) and Black Sea (silver sake, Bombay Sapphire, lemon juice, gomme syrup and - God help us - squid ink). </p> <p>Sake is far from the only drink to have undergone a fusion makeover. The rather austere taste of green tea, for example, is being combined with other ingredients such as ginger and honey to make it more palatable to western consumers eager to take advantage of its much publicised health benefits (it's a powerful antioxidant). Tea drinks are particularly popular in south-east Asia. Kombucha, a recently launched fermented tea drink infused with yeast cultures and lactobacilli, apparently dates back to 221BC, when it was first brewed up for the Japanese emperor. \"Its overall effect - an extended feeling of health - cannot be fully explained,\" intones the label mysteriously. </p> <p>Health is also the core appeal of isotonic drinks such as Lipovitan and the bizarrely named Pochari Sweat, which apparently sells a billion cans a year in Japan. Available from many Japanese stores such as the Japan Centre in Piccadilly, it has rather an odd taste - a bit like a dose of liver salts. More palatable is Calpico, an odd, chalky-looking lactic acid drink, which tastes like a watery, lemon-flavoured yoghurt. </p> <p>However unfamiliar we may find these flavours (though remember just how quickly we've taken to sushi), the reality is that an oriental name is just about enough to sell anything these days, particularly in the countries of the Pacific Rim. Midori, for example, an ultra-sweet melon liqueur that was originally Japanese but that is now produced in Mexico, is apparently the fourth biggest-selling liqueur in Australia, while Illusion (Midori, Triple Sec, vodka, pineapple and lemon juice) is the top-selling cocktail. </p> <p>Bearing that in mind, the next bartender's must-have could well be Jinro Soju, a sort of Korean vodka, which is apparently one of the top five spirits brands in the world. </p> <p>The irony is, of course, that while the west pursues its love affair with the east, the east regards the west as the ultimate arbiter of taste. For the wealthy Japanese, it's all about malt whisky, Cognac and bottles of Petrus. And bugger the lactobacilli </p> <p><b> SIX SLICK PACIFIC DRINKS</b></p> <p><b>Hakutsuru Japanese Excellent Sake (\u00a38.39, Oddbins)</b><br> Just what it says - a pukka Japanese sake that tastes like a low-alcohol cross between a fino sherry, a grappa and an unoaked malt whisky. Perfect for sushi. Drink chilled (as you should any decent sake).</p> <p><b> Momokawa Ruby Sake (\u00a35.99 Waitrose)</b><br> This modern Oregon-brewed sake, rated Best US Sake in 1999, has a flavour halfway between dank and delicate, according to the rather bizarre graph on the back label. Nice, though, and I love the blue bottle.</p> <p><b> Ume Shu Japanese Plum Sake (\u00a315.90, Arigato, Brewer Street, London W1; The Japan Centre, Piccadilly, London W1; and other specialist oriental grocers) </b><br>Popular with mixologists, this genuinely plum-flavoured sake is actually very good on its own. It would also make a fantastic dessert wine.</p> <p> <b>Kombucha (\u00a31.55 for 250ml, Selfridges) </b><br>This plum-flavoured fermented tea drink is said to be a favourite of Barbra Streisand's, but don't let that put you off. </p> <p> <b>Arizona Asia Plum Green Tea with Ginseng (\u00a31.59, Waitrose) </b><br>Yet more plum, I'm afraid, but it's comparably the best fusion flavour, at least for drinks. A green tea drink in a stunning bottle that would be great to puton the table for teetotlers at a Chinese or Japanese meal.</p>",
  "According to Cassandra Latham, the rules of spell-casting are: don't dabble but do persist; do not start anything that you can't finish; be aware that anything you wish for in another person may come back to you; and be precise. 'Don't just ask for money, because your nearest and dearest might drop down dead, leaving you an inheritance.' <p><b> Candle magic</b></p> <p> 'A good general-purpose spell that anyone who believes in it can do,' says Latham. Pick a candle of an appropriate colour for the job (green or pink for love, yellow for wealth, red for strength, blue for good fortune, mauve for wisdom, brown for stability). If you wish to draw something towards yourself, write its name from the top of the candle to the bottom. If it's something you want to dispel, write it from the bottom to the top. Candle magic, like most magic, is best done after dark. To draw something to you, begin the spell on a new moon; to dispel it, begin on a waning moon. Light the candle and strongly visualise what you want to achieve for as long as you can maintain concentration. Blow out the candle. Repeat the procedure the next night, and again each night until the moon has completed its waxing or waning. Bury or burn the candle debris. Don't throw it away. Don't talk about the spell; and, once it's done, forget about it. </p> <p><b> Witches' ladder</b></p> <p> Dedicate a piece of rope to magic. Following the same lunar pattern as for candle magic, each night tie one knot in the rope while strongly visualising what you wish to achieve. Tie the knots towards you to draw your object inward and away from you to dispel it. Witches' ladders have a long tradition in Cornwall, where they were commonly sold to fishermen before a trip out to sea. Untying the first knot would unleash a light breeze, the second a stronger wind and so on. A witches' ladder also refers to a string of 40 beads used like a rosary as an aid to concentrated repetition. </p> <p><b> Witches' poppets</b> </p> <p>Poppets are wax, clay or even Plasticene figures resembling the person on whom the magic is to be focused. In a coven, the poppet may be consecrated on a witches' altar, attached by cord to both a woman and a man (according to the Wiccan belief, that male and female energy combined create the most effective magic), and given the appropriate symbolic treatment. The poppet's leg might be bandaged as part of a healing ritual, or its mouth might be sewn up to prevent the living person it represents from spreading gossip. Once the spell has worked, the poppet will be burned or buried, thereby releasing the spell. </p> <p> When I was a little girl, I thought I was a witch. Borrowing my mum's old milkpan, I would pass balmy summer evenings stirring livid stews of wild berries and gladioli over a bonfire at the back of our garden, then pour the resulting brew into jam jars and label them \"potion\". I communicated with other (invisible) witches in witch language scrawled over my cupboard door. I made up witch songs and caterwauled them out of the window at night. I began demanding to be persecuted. My particular hankering was to be tossed into a chasm, though these are not at all common around Basildon. To my mother and father's credit, they resisted what must by then have been the almost irresistible, and I lived on. Not content with my good luck, I acquired a black cat. Finally, and to my eternal regret, I fed my hamster to a toad. </p> <p>Some time soon after, I discovered Fuzzy Felt, or perhaps it was Pippa dolls, and forgot all about witchcraft. Until a couple of years ago, that is, when The Old Religion, as witches often call it, suddenly emerged from the broom closet and into the light. The Craft and The Blair Witch Project appeared on film, The Witches Of Eastwick went into production as a musical. The first of the Harry Potter books was published and sold in its millions. Sabrina The Teenage Witch and Buffy The Vampire Slayer began airing on British TV. All over Britain (and America and beyond), Hecate was getting hip. Something curious was happening. </p> <p>It got curiouser and curiouser. During my research for this article, I found a tarantula on my doorstep. Sometime later, a live crow in a knotted dustbin bag appeared (and flew to its freedom the moment I opened the bag). Now, crows and tarantulas don't wash up on my doorstep every day, but life is plump with coincidence, weirdness happens, and though intrigued and slightly ruffled I carried on all the same. </p> <p>According to the Pagan Federation, there are currently 10,000 initiated witches in this country and more than 100,000 pagans. Compare this with 6,000 practising British Druids and 4,000 Buddhists, and you'll get the point. What was once taboo is now almost de rigueur. The witch religion, Wicca (wicce is the Anglo-Saxon word for witch), though only founded within the past 50 years, is growing fast. And we're exporting it. In the past couple of years, Wicca has really taken off on the continent and in the English-speaking world, most particularly in the US and Australia. No one knows how many Wiccans or witches there are worldwide, but a million would probably cover it. And it all began here in Britain. </p> <p>Some definitions are called for. Wicca is a subset of paganism, as well as being the witch religion, and while all Wiccans are witches (even the men), not all witches are Wiccans. Some witches are agnostics, or Christians, or Hindus, or just plain old witches. The latter are often known as hedge witches. They tend to work alone and often describe themselves as being in The Craft. Most Wiccans, by contrast, work in covens. It goes without saying that not all pagans are witches, nor, necessarily, are all witches pagans. Wizards and warlocks, by the way, are neither witches nor Wiccans, but people (usually men) who practise high magic (more of which later) with no overtly religious context. So far as we know, there aren't many of them. </p> <p>To make it all crystal clear, let's just say that The Witches Of Eastwick are Wiccans, Sabrina is a hedge witch and, if Harry Potter is anything, then he is probably a wizard. Paganism and witchcraft have been a thriving part of British culture for as long as there are records. In the 11th century, King Canute was sufficiently threatened by them to issue anti-pagan and anti-witchcraft laws, and witchcraft was still illegal in this country until 1951. But The Craft was relatively tolerated in England. Elizabeth I had her own court witch in the form of John Dee, the royal alchemist, and even during the great witch-hunts of the 16th and 17th centuries, witches were rarely burned alive in England, as they were in continental Europe and Scotland. They were hanged or strangled, then burned. </p> <p>Having lain low for a century or so after those particular horrors, British witches began to re-emerge in the 18th century, in the guise of cunning men and wise women, local oddballs who lived on the outskirts of villages and ministered to broken hearts and neighbourhood grievances. </p> <p>Cassandra Latham still does. Britain's only professional witch (her tax return states her occupation as \"village witch\"), Latham whips up charms and spells for the locals of St Buryan, near Land's End, and, via her website, for anyone else prepared to stump up a modest fee or offer a skill to trade. Latham even looks the part - a tiny, impish thing with sky-blue eyes and witchy, black hair, chopped, rather charmingly, mullet-style. A qualified nurse and counsellor, Latham turned to witching 16 years ago, after a back injury put paid to her nursing career, but she always knew she was different: \"I didn't have a wonderful childhood and I retreated into otherworldliness. Part of the work I do now involves walking between this world and the spirit world, and I did that, too, when I was a child. It used to be an escape route, now it's a choice.\" </p> <p>Glaswegian pensioner Mary Rands inherited her interest in witchcraft from her grandmother, who was considered \"fey\". Rands' sister is also a witch. \"I chose witchcraft, but witchcraft also chose me,\" she says. Most witches have no family connections to The Craft, but feel drawn nonetheless. Maureen Brown is a qualified Jungian psychotherapist, who has been a member of a coven in Croydon for the past 26 years. \"As a child, I was considered strange because I saw things with lights around them, which I now know to be auras. I was always different. I was always a seeker.\" In her early 20s, Brown was introduced to two witches at a party and never looked back. \"By that time, I had experimented with many of the major religions, but I just knew that witchcraft was for me.\" </p> <p>Caroline Robertson, proprietor of Westbury Music, the UK's leading independent dance-music label, was initiated into Wicca four years ago, but her interest in witchcraft began in childhood. \"I was always a daydreamer. I believed in the force and power of nature and in the mystery of life.\" She bought her first pack of tarot cards at university. \"It was 1970, Lennon and McCartney were doing their thing and everyone was getting a bit mystical.\" According to Robertson, you don't have to be born a witch, but it takes a certain kind of person to become one. \"A businessman's mind would be wasted in a coven. Witchcraft is about threshold worlds and shifting realities. It appeals to odd people, loners, folk who don't follow the normal rules.\" </p> <p>Cassandra Latham doesn't follow \"the normal rules\", but her clients - she sees about 200 a year - tend to be regular Joes and Joannas with all the usual problems. \"The reasons people used to go to cunning folk in the past are the same as the reasons people come to me now. Relationships, jobs, money, health. People often ask me to cleanse their homes of psychic debris. One of the most common things I get asked to do is to remove curses, but no one ever asks me for anything ridiculous. It's pastoral work, just like the vicar, really.\" </p> <p>Well, not quite like the vicar (though Latham says she gets on well with him). \"What makes me different from a psychotherapist or any other counsellor is that I use magic. I believe that old habit patterns lie in the unconscious. If you want to change them, you need to communicate to the unconscious in a way it'll respond to - with symbols and archetypes and ritual. If you perform a spell with particular motifs, it will clear the unconscious ground. I find it very effective and very quick. You could spend years in psychotherapy getting to that point, whereas magic will take the shortest route, and in it goes.\" </p> <p>Ah yes, magic. It's nonsense, obviously. Well, perhaps not complete nonsense. But definitely something for the funny folk. Except, except ... we all do it. Every time we step over cracks in the pavement, don our lucky ties for the job interview, spit on the dice before we throw, we have fallen under magic's spell. Vivianne Crowley, senior lecturer in the psychology of religion at London University, puts it like this: \"Magical thinking gives us a sense of control in a world of random events. It gives you a sense that the universe is listening to you and speaking to you. Psychologically, that can be a very useful strategy.\" Children employ magical thinking every day and the world religions all have some magical element. What else are biblical miracles or the mysticism of the Jewish cabbala? However much we may pooh-pooh magic, we seem to be saturated in it all the same. \"Magic connects with people on some ancient level,\" says Latham. \"It's like a race memory almost. It hits the primitive part of our minds.\" </p> <p>Crowley agrees: \"Most witches believe that magic is innate in the human psyche. It's something lots of people can develop.\" She's not talking about sawing ladies in half or card tricks. She's talking about actual, transformative magic. </p> <p>But what is magic? Well, no one really knows, but received wisdom defines it as the use of the will to effect change, and recognises two types: natural and high, or ritualistic. In natural magic, witches emphasise folk wisdom. They may cast spells and use candles, herbs, wax images, crystals and scrying or divination objects such as crystal balls and dowsing rods, as well as more familiar psychological techniques such as meditation, visualisation and repetition to focus their minds on the effects they want to manifest. Natural magic is craftwork, and its practitioners regard themselves as craftsmen and women. They are in The Craft. </p> <p>High or ritualistic magic tends to focus more on ceremony, ritual and invocation. Alchemists were generally high magicians, but high magic's most famous son is probably the turn-of-the-century mystic and occultist Aleister Crowley. Most ritualistic magic is conducted in groups or covens. Witchcraft's own religion, Wicca, makes much use of it. \"The difference,\" says Latham, \"is that high magic is formal and theatrical.\" </p> <p>Does magic work? Graham King thinks so. Four years ago, King sold his successful business making specialist cameras for archive libraries, got rid of the Jag and the country cottage, burned his collection of silk ties and bought the Museum Of Witchcraft, Boscastle, on the north coast of Cornwall, which he now runs as a going concern. Fifty thousand visitors come to the museum every year to peer at the cases of charms, amulets, poppets (wax dolls), wands, athames (ceremonial knives), scourges (ceremonial whips) and talismans. Having spent 20years as a scientist, technician and businessman, King now devotes his life to witchery. \"I'm a scientist, but I believe in magic because I've seen it work,\" he says. \"I don't know why it works, but I accept it does. Look, I have been employed in the electronics industry, and I don't know how electricity really works, either, but it does, right?\" He has a point. Hands up who really understands how the telly makes pictures, or the microwave makes dinners. As for the VCR . . . </p> <p>Debate as to whether magic is a psychological or supernatural power, or a bit of both, boils like a brothy cauldron in the witching community. Vivianne Crowley (no relation to Aleister, incidentally) is in no doubt. \"The power of magic is 90% psychological and 10% anomalous events not beyond scientific understanding but beyond current scientific understanding. Even the British Psychological Society has become interested in the ability of spiritual practices to manifest healing powers, and in clairvoyance, psychometry [the ability to divine by touching something] and telepathy, those techniques psychologists call parapsychology.\" She points out that there is now a chair of parapsychology at Edinburgh University, it's that respectable. </p> <p>According to Crowley, Wiccans simply harness and develop these parapsychological techniques. Which is both disappointing (no fabulous supernatural phenomena) and intriguing (anyone can do it). \"Could I turn a lightbulb into a frog?\" asks Maureen Brown. \"Yes, but it would take a very long time, and all my energy, and it's easier to work for the money and then go and buy a frog.\" Caroline Robertson agrees: \"I could probably change plastic to gold, but it would take years.\" Crowley is sceptical. When I told her that some witches claimed to be able to turn lightbulbs into frogs, she just laughed and said, \"Rubbish!\" </p> <p>The obvious question remains. If magic is as powerful as some witches claim it to be, why can't witches put a stop to famine/war/ disease? And why isn't every witch a millionaire? Or immortal? Ah, well. For one thing, witches are human, as fallible as doctors or politicians (and we all know how fallible they are). Most witches just aren't all that competent, and the ones who are tend not to mouth off about it. Not so long ago, a very public attempt by the self-proclaimed king of the witches, Kevin Carlyon, to prevent the building of the Channel Tunnel by burning an effigy of a train raised a good few nudge-nudge, wink-winks in the pubs around Lewes, East Sussex, Carlyon's home town, and knocked something of a dent in the reputation of The Craft. These days, most witches have learned to be more modest about their powers. \"I'm not Superwitch. I would say that I have a 70% success rate,\" says Latham, \"but I can't think of any business which is 100% all the time.\" </p> <p>Then there's the responsibility. \"If people think I'm going to wave a magic wand and whisk their problems away, they have to think again,\" says Latham. \"I can help you to help yourself is all. If I waved a wand, I'd just be disempowering you.\" If that sounds a bit like self-help waffle, witches insist they get results. King recently cast spells for a couple who were finding it hard to conceive, and \"baby Sean arrived nine months later\". On the other hand, \"I only get involved with things where there's real need. Someone who just wants a new boyfriend can sort themselves out.\" </p> <p>What about black magic? Officially, Wicca operates a no-harm principle, the so-called Wiccan Rede, but King claims that \"the principle is recent and not many witches stick to it\". King himself admits to having cast spells with \"broken mirrors and effigies and coffins to warn people to behave well. The circumstances haven't yet arisen where I might actually curse someone, but that's not to say there are no such circumstances.\" </p> <p>Rands isn't so circumspect. In the 30-odd years she's been a witch (and a civil servant, qualified nurse, nanny), she's found herself in the hexing business twice. \"Oh, I've stamped my foot and pointed my finger all right. I'm old-fashioned in that way. An eye for an eye. I cursed one man who was forcing his sexual attentions on women and he's now got a very nasty incurable skin disease. That might not have been my doing, of course, it might have happened anyway. But...\" </p> <p>That said, most witches hesitate to use black magic because they believe in the threefold boomerang - that their actions will return to them three times over. Since sending her victim a skin disease, Rands' own health has taken a downturn. \"If that's because I've ill-wished someone, then I have to take responsibility.\" Then she chuckles. \"But it was worth it.\" </p> <p>Cursing and hexing are partly what gives witchcraft a bad name, of course. But even if black magic were effective, in the context of the damage done in the name of the world religions, a little skin disease among rou\u00e9s doesn't seem so bad. All the same, there's a reluctance among many witches to talk freely. You can hardly blame them for having a persecution complex. Somewhere in the region of 40,000, mostly women, were murdered in Britain during the great witch-hunts, for an assortment of evils ranging from spinsterhood and warts to ergot poisoning. (Ergot is a fungus that infects rye, causing convulsions and hallucinations in anyone who eats it. There is now plenty of evidence to suggest that the symptoms of the \"possessions\" at Salem and elsewhere - in the UK in East Anglia especially - during the witch-hunt period were the result of ergot poisoning.) </p> <p>Even now, in our secular age, we can't quite make up our minds about The Craft. Though the Witchcraft Act was repealed in 1951, we're still edgy about witching. Lest we forget, it was only 15 years ago that we had our own Salem, with the tabloids screaming blue murder over supposed acts of satanic abuse by witches and Devil worshippers. Even though a 1994 government enquiry into the whole affair found that ritual abuse \"has never been substantiated by empirical evidence\", the public remains willing to lump witchcraft in with Satanism, as though the two were some devilish double act. (For the record, witches do not believe in the existence of Satan, so it would be a little eccentric of them to worship him/her/it.) </p> <p>Earlier this year, evidence of ritual activity was discovered on the hills overlooking the Meon Valley, near Southampton. Wax had been dripped on to the ground from candles and, buried in a circle, investigators uncovered 12 dead rats. Meon Valley police immediately contacted Graham King at the Museum Of Witchcraft for advice. Inspector Shaun Moore of Meon Valley police says: \"We are concerned it might lead to something.\" The headline in the Southern Daily Echo (and it was a big one) read, \"Occult Probe\". Shock and horror! Wax drips and dead rats. </p> <p>Unfortunately, discrimination against Wiccans and pagans is alive and well, tinged with ignorance and paranoia. Drama teacher Ralph Morse was recently suspended from his job at Shenfield high school in Essex after admitting to being youth officer for the Pagan Federation and a practising witch (he was later reinstated). The school's headteacher, John Fairhurst, issued a statement saying, \"We completely and unequivocally reject their world of witchcraft and magic.\" Rands was asked to leave her post as a nanny after her journalist employer accused her of using witchcraft to \"steal the children\". </p> <p>In the US, things are even worse. Despite a constitutional guarantee of freedom of speech and religion, Harry Potter (our own dear HP!) is banned in schools in Kansas and Colorado for promoting witchcraft. (The rows of chain stores and discount outlets piled high with pointy Hallowe'en hats and broomsticks are okay, though. That's just business.) </p> <p>Thankfully, witches appear not to have returned the religious bigotry. Having made the journey from Catholic to witch, Rands insists, \"there's not much distance between them. They share the same sense of ritual.\" Graham King goes further: \"I would have no trouble invoking Christ. I would visualise him and ask for his assistance. I don't think he's the son of God, but he's a pretty good witch.\" </p> <p> The next decade could see Wicca completely throw off its associations with the occult (\"occult\" means hidden) and go mainstream. Which would no doubt please its founder, Gerald Gardner (1883-1964). Claiming to have been initiated in the \"Old Ways\" by a crone named Dorothy Clutterbuck in the New Forest in 1939, Gardner published Witchcraft Today soon after the repeal of the Witchcraft Act in 1951 and effectively founded what has become Wicca, the witches' religion. In Witchcraft Today, Gardner laid out the eight sabbats, or Wiccan festivals, an amalgam of the old pagan solstices and equinoxes and the Celtic nature festivals of Imbolc (Candlemas), Beltane (May Day), Lammas (beginning of August) and Samhain (All Hallow's Eve). </p> <p>A mildly eccentric ex-colonial civil servant whose influences ranged from Hinduism to folk magic to freemasonry, Gardner conceived of a celebratory religion whose focus was on the power of the natural world. Wiccan rituals generally begin with the drawing of a magic circle, offerings to the elements and the four directions, and continue with a series of rituals, incantations and chants whose power rests in the symbolic marriage of male and female. But does that amount to a religion? Vivianne Crowley says it does: \"A religion is a set of ritual acts and practices invoking or calling up the divine. By that definition, Wicca is undoubtedly a religion.\" </p> <p>One problem with Gardner's work, however, was that, in order to give Wicca the authority he felt it deserved, he couched its rituals and incantations in purple prose, stuffing in grandiose archaisms wherever he could fit them, so that, to the unconvinced, Wicca can seem rather absurd, all thees and thous and thereforeuntos. Even the Wiccan salutation - Blessed Be - is tinged with hey-nonny-no. </p> <p>Another problem is that Gardner appears to have been a bit of a perv. It was he who introduced into Wiccan ritual scourging, the practice of using flails or whips lightly to scourge the skin as an aid to concentration. This idea was not new - some Hindu and Christian sects still practise it - but there was no evidence that it had ever been part of witchcraft traditions. And his ideas about working \"skyclad\" or naked also raised some eyebrows. \"Yes, Gardner probably was a dirty old man and virtually illiterate and, no, there is no evidence for scourges elsewhere in any witchcraft literature,\" admits Graham King. </p> <p>Neither of these things appears to have put Wiccans off. \"Wicca is a surprisingly modern religion that draws on some ancient ideas,\" insists Crowley. \"Wicca venerates nature, and is associated with vegetarianism and animal rights. Its feminism and emphasis on individual responsibility matches people's perception of the world.\" </p> <p>But, I say, nudity, magic, the mysteries of nature, it's all a bit un-British, isn't it? On the contrary, says Ronald Hutton, professor of history at Bristol University. \"Wicca is very British - English, actually. We are the first nation to have industrialised and to have been acutely cut off from the natural world. Wicca is a response to that, a countercultural religion allowing people to link back with the land.\" </p> <p>A product of our history it may be, but does Wicca have a future? Since its inception 50 years ago, it has branched off and taken on local flavours. There are now radical feminist, gay and all-male Wiccan groups. \"Wicca is going through radical changes at the moment because of its growth,\" says Crowley. \"There's a much wider range of people now, and a lot of those getting involved are not seeking the occult but a modern spiritual practice. They're attracted to participatory ritual, and there's a hunger for a spiritual system that enhances lives by bringing about an inner change. And Wicca is celebratory.\" </p> <p>Wiccans themselves are optimistic. As Crowley says, \"Wicca has no paid leadership, no buildings, no capital: it's like a huge voluntary group, but it's survived 50 years.\" Professor Hutton, himself a druid, agrees: \"The fact that Wicca is a mystery religion and includes nudity and initiation rites means it will always shock the mainstream, but I think it will persist. Wicca is having a strong influence on rave and rock culture, eco-pagans and road protesters. The correspondence between magic and virtual reality means it also appeals to infotech workers. It's a religion for self-employed and self-reliant people, artisans and individualists, and it is currently finding its role as the clergy or inner ring to these groups. The 90s saw a remarkable pulling together of all the pagan strands.\" </p> <p>No one I spoke to had any ideas about the tarantula and the crow, by the way. The woman in my local pet shop wasn't missing a tarantula, though she pointed out that they are great escape artists. So I've decided the tarantula was a runaway pet. But as for the crow, well, I really don't know what to think about the crow</p>",
  "<p>Craig Masson and Andrew McMinn recently threw a \"very tropical and exotic party, to celebrate 10 years of married bliss\". The invitations, which flew out of canary-yellow envelopes, were a zazz of hearts, flowers and glittery palm trees. There was a strict dress code (Carmen Miranda, Hula Boy, Showgirl, Tarzan, Knickerbocker Glory, etc), and though I didn't make it myself, the \"boyz and girlz\" who did spilled out of the Miami kitchen and the rococo-colonial lounge into the garden, where they mingled with pink plastic flamingos and drank oceans of fizz under strings of dangly party lights shaped like pineapples, bananas and slices of watermelon. </p> <p>Masson and McMinn, who drop words such as \"poptastic\" into normal conversation and wear Hawaiian shirts as part of their day-wear, were dressed as the Beatles in Sgt Pepper mode. They had given the hall floor a coat of lurid green paint for the occasion. Even the garden statuary was wearing orange taffeta. That's the kind of fun guys they are - but you don't have to go to one of their parties to enjoy a little of the light they shed on life. </p> <p>The couple are the founders of Kitschen Sync, the two-store London retailer that trades in \"a glorious kitsch-a-rama of flashy, trashy trinkets\". Their shops (one in Clapham, another in Covent Garden) offer a world of gnomes, snowstorms and Sputnik lights, cocktail swizzle sticks, lips, lanterns and glitter mirrorballs - all presented in the display cabinet equivalent of retro 50s kitchen units. Their mail-order catalogue is 18 colour pages of jokey product placement: \"Having a party in a dinghy? Don't forget the inflatable ice bucket!\" (Yours for \u00a32.50.) </p> <p>In essence, they specialise in cheap crap (rubber goldfish, glow-in-the-dark goddesses, fuzzy dice, funky phones and all manner of frivolous fakery from fruit and foliage to fur), but Kitschen Sync's founders don't believe in palming off any old cheap crap - their business was born out of a genuine affection for the gaudy colour and good humour of classic bad taste. Not only have they travelled the world - China, Mexico, India, Thailand, Holland and, um, Enfield - to find the stuff, but there's barely anything in their shops that they wouldn't have in their own home. </p> <p>\"Our kitchen is very Kitschen Sync,\" agrees Craig, when I join them for breakfast in Victorian- terraced Balham, where we sit around a retro table in chrome and lemon-yellow laminate (\u00a3275) on matching vinyl chairs (\u00a3120 each), surrounded by Formica (bespoke units by their Covent Garden shopfitter; colour scheme by Marge and Homer Simpson). The table is set with leopard-print mats and co-ordinating paper napkins. \"More tea, vicar?\" asks Andrew before refilling my jolly mug (a discontinued line) from an even jollier teapot decorated with poodles and Lassie lookalikes (a gift from a friend). </p> <p>Kitschen Sync, they tell me between mouthfuls of sticky chocolate croissant, was originally inspired by a shop in Amsterdam that they came across during a weekend break in 1997. \"Most of the stuff was from Mexico,\" says Craig. \"There was lots of colourful plastic, all very fun and quirky. We didn't think it was as cheap as it should have been, but we were sure there was a place for a similar shop in London.\" At the time, neither of them was looking for a business opportunity - Craig was a freelance display designer, Andrew a lingerie merchandiser for House of Fraser - but the idea took root and grew. </p> <p>The concept and, indeed, the name, Kitschen Sync, was dreamed up on the Eurostar on the way home from Amsterdam. Within a few months, they had found a maker to produce their own-designed leopard-print candles; Craig had set up a market stall to fund the time spent on drawing up a business plan; and every spare moment was spent sourcing suitable material. \"We look for quirky design and fantastic colour,\" says Andrew. \"But we also cater for nostalgia - things that people remember as kids, like plastic polka-dot beakers or Duralex glasses from Woollies.\" </p> <p>There is also an element of imported souvenirs. One of their bestsellers (and one of their personal favourites) is an \"exuberant, flamboyant\" Mexican Corona beer tray, featuring a sunny senorita in a scarlet sombrero. \"When you think about the icons of kitsch, it's often the stuff that people bring back from holiday,\" says Andrew. \"People are seduced by these things - the donkeys, the flamenco dolls, the windmills from Amsterdam - but when they get them home they look alien, they stand out. And I suppose that's what we sell ... things that stand out.\" </p> <p>At Masson and McMinn's effervescent home, almost everything stands out in one way or another. The only kind of magnolia they would tolerate is in fake flower form. They don't go in for \"white goods\", either (the fridge is yellow). Their fearless use of colour has no inhibitions - those Miami-style units in the kitchen, for example, mix lemon with mint and rose pink with sky blue; the floor is a harlequin of blue and green tiles; the walls are turquoise and yellow; and the paintwork is a hot, hot pink. </p> <p>The living room, according to Craig, \"is kitschy colonial ... a bit rococo-y, a bit Pierre and Gilles\". To get the look (Andrew calls it \"tongue in chic\"), line all walls with animal-print wallpaper. Cover one in a collection of gilded sunburst clocks and mirrors, dating from the 30s to the 50s. Add two large \"lovely jubbly\" sofas in tiger-print, place a tall \"kitschy religious\" Virgin Mary in one corner and drape garlands of fake flowers, \u00e0 la South Pacific, down the windows. They have also raided their storeroom for multi-coloured chandeliers (a Kitschen Sync speciality, \"fashioned from real plastic\", from \u00a319 each) and flocked plastic deer heads (\"that grand hall look without the taxidermy\", \u00a312.50). Most people couldn't live with one of the latter; Masson and McMinn have an entire herd of them mounted on a bright red wall. </p> <p>But the living room is a model of sobriety compared with the \"70s disco\" bathroom. Here, a fuchsia-painted roll-top tub sits on a raised platform surrounded by wall-to-floor mosaics in psychedelic colours - yellow, blue, turquoise, more hot pink, a bit of scorching pink, a touch of green. The ceiling is all mirrored mosaics. The wall above the tub is lined with original 70s vinyl wallpaper in more shades of puce and pink. And the bathroom is not even finished yet. \"What's missing is some Top Of The Pops album covers for the walls and a big swivelling bucket chair - all plastic and shiny,\" says Craig. \"And we'd like one of those 70s display cupboards, y'know with flaps, and doors, mirrors and lights.\" Mmmm, lovely. </p> <p>Few people have the courage or the inclination to go to these extremes, but Masson and McMinn believe that Kitschen Sync has successfully filled a niche in modern retro interiors. \"We are not trying to sell a whole package or a whole concept,\" says Andrew. \"What we offer is accents of colour and touches of humour. Even people with lovely, tasteful kitchens will throw in a shocking pink kettle for fun, or something wacky in the bathroom like a fluffy pedestal mat.\" </p> <p>Kitschen Sync, they say, is a \"fashion shop\", responding to whimsical trends (snakeskin is the new leopard print, apparently), but it caters for all tastes. Oh, really? \"Yeah, I think there's something here for everyone,\" says Craig. </p> <p>When I test out the theory with a visit to their Clapham shop, I go into kitsch-a-rama overdrive and am seduced into buying a Barrier Reef shower curtain (\"a taste of warm tropical waters without the risk of becoming a shark's hors d'oeuvre,\" \u00a319), one of those Corona beer trays (\u00a310), two strings of fruity party lights (\u00a315 each), a squeezy tomato ketchup bottle (\u00a33) and a square foot of realistic fake grass sprigged with spring flowers (I haven't got a clue what I'm going to do with it but, at \u00a33.75, who cares?). </p> <p>According to Andrew and Craig, I am a fairly typical customer, combining gift-buying and impulse purchases with a little light home accessorising. But there are all sorts of Kitschen Sync shoppers. Some wouldn't dream of crossing the threshold, but others are addicts. \"You'd be surprised by the number of customers who tell us they've got everything we sell,\" says Craig. \"And we are still catering for those who actually have, well, dubious taste,\" says Andrew. \"There is an element of people who don't see the irony. There's no tongue in their cheeks. They buy stuff because they genuinely think it's nice.\" </p> <p>\u0095 Kitschen Sync, 9 The Pavement, Clapham, London SW4, and 7 Earlham Street, Covent Garden, London WC2.
