  "<p>It was not without good reason that Arsenal arrived in the mining region of south-east Ukraine yesterday with more baggage than even Terry Venables is said to carry around with him. </p> <p>Arsenal have hauled not just extra clothing to this freezing town near the Russian border but food, water, bed linen, towels and toilet paper. Bed bugs are said to be rife. </p> <p>It is safe to assume Ars\u00e8ne Wenger's players will be denied such Ukrainian delicacies as oseledsi (pickled fish) and holubtsi (cabbage rolls). Donetsk, once named Stalino and twinned with Sheffield, is clearly not on Wenger's list of holiday destinations. </p> <p>\"It is part of Ukraine, which is not yet equipped to host people who are used to western commodities,\" he said. \"From what we have seen the hotels are not what we are used to.\" </p> <p>Little wonder that Arsenal's players were not keen on the 3,500-mile round trip for tonight's match with Shakhtar when they were already certain group winners. \"They do it because it is their job,\" said Wenger. \"It's not that they don't want to play. If we played the same game at Luton everyone would want to play.\" </p> <p>No one suddenly claimed to share Dennis Bergkamp's fear of flying but Wenger said seven first-team regulars had been left behind with the Dutchman because of injury or suspension, among them Tony Adams and Patrick Vieira. </p> <p>Even so the team will be stronger than many expected, which must delight the 50 or so Arsenal fans who have independently bought \u00a35 tickets for the game. The familiar faces will be joined by the 19-year-old goalkeeper Stuart Taylor, making his second start, and Matthew Upson, on his way back from knee trouble. </p> <p>\"I felt we didn't play much better [at Middlesbrough] after I rested players [in the Worthington Cup],\" said Wenger, who confirmed he would not discuss a new contract until the transfer regulations were settled. \"Players like Wiltord, Kanu and Vivas need matches and I also feel a responsibility to Donetsk and Sparta Prague [who are fighting for third spot and a Uefa Cup place].\" Sylvain Wiltord and Arsenal last night played down a French report that the \u00a313m signing is unhappy because he has started only five games since arriving in early season. </p> <p>The travelling players were certainly not gambling thousands. After the revelations that big-money betting was damagingly rife in Kevin Keegan's England squad, Wenger made his position clear. </p> <p>\"When cards is played for nearly nothing it is great,\" he said, though he stressed he felt he could not join in. \"But when the purpose is big money you have to forbid it because it spoils your mind.\" </p> <p>But he added: \"People say the English problem is that the players gamble too much, but I'm really suspicious of that. The basic thing is technique.\" </p> <p> <strong> Arsenal</strong> (probable; 4-3-1-2): Taylor; Dixon, Keown, Upson, Cole; Vivas, Parlour, Lauren; Kanu; Wiltord, Henry. </p> <p>\u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.

  "Today America will begin to say farewell. It will be a long goodbye, one that fits the outsized character of the man. For the United States has three months to let go of a leader who has, by turns, enthralled, appalled and seduced them for eight compelling years. Bill Clinton won't officially become the ex-president till a minute past noon on January 20 2001, but by late tonight he will be yesterday's man. He will lose his throne, either to his appointed heir or to the son of the king he slayed to get there. One of them will be the president-elect and, in a heartbeat, Clinton will slip from emblem of America's present to holdover from America's past. <p>His fellow Americans will miss him - more, perhaps, than they realise. They'll miss the two terms of peace and record prosperity, of course, but they might even miss the psychodrama: an eight-year rollercoaster ride so turbulent that those who followed it become queasy at the recollection. They'll miss the daily triumphs and disasters of a character of Shakespearean complexity, a president who stirred in the American people passions of love and hatred unseen since the days of John F Kennedy and Richard Nixon - and almost never aroused by a single man. Above all, they will miss his signature feature, one which may well have redefined the presidency itself: an almost eerie gift for empathy. </p> <p>I will miss him, too. For the years of Clinton's American journey matched my own. I first came to live and work in the country in 1992, just as he exploded on to the national scene. I watched him run for president, and stayed to see him do the job. From then on, and for several years, I either watched, read or wrote about Clinton nearly every day. Just as future TV documentary makers keen to evoke the 1990s will flash up an image of the president, I suspect that, when I look back on my late 20s or early 30s, I will do the same. And tonight that era will come to a close. </p> <p>The memories come so fast that it's not easy to separate them. That 1992 election alone was so chock-full of scandal and turnarounds, such a vintage campaign, that it's hard to forget any of it - whether it was Gennifer with a G, the Vietnam draft-dodging letter, written by Clinton while a student at Oxford, or Hillary on 60 Minutes insisting she had been no Tammy Wynette standing by her man, and that if you didn't like her husband, then, \"Heck, don't vote for him.\" </p> <p>It was a crazy year, but it was that Clinton gift for empathy which saw him through. I had heard about it before - Republicans had already ridiculed the Arkansas governor's tendency to begin sentences with \"I feel\" rather than \"I think\", a habit that reached its apotheosis in the legendary \"I feel your pain.\" But there was no substitute for seeing it in action. </p> <p>Of course there were the moments widely witnessed, such as those few seconds during one of the televised debates, when the candidates were asked how the recession had affected them personally. Clinton turned the query around, asking the questioner how she had suffered. Meanwhile, his opponent, George Bush Snr, was caught on camera checking his watch. </p> <p>But there were also the tiny episodes, too small to be reported in their own right, which offered a glimpse of Clinton's sheer talent for people. It's perhaps hard, after this year's lacklustre contest, to imagine the excitement Clinton generated that autumn. \"The failed governor of a small southern state,\" the Republicans had called him. But the voters didn't see it that way. I remember two moments from a Clinton-Gore bus tour through the American heartland. It was a swing through southern Georgia and the buzz was palpable. People didn't just attend rallies, they lined the highways in crowds to catch a glimpse of the man who would be president. Some held banners urging the young governor with the gargantuan appetite (he can eat a whole apple in a single bite) to stop awhile and sample the local peaches or peanuts - and he always did. </p> <p>His aides would get enraged, every stop delaying the tour by a few more crucial minutes. By the end of a campaign day, Clinton would be running four or five hours late, but it didn't matter. In the town square at Valdosta a crowd that had gathered for a 9pm rally waited till 2am. Under floodlights on that September night, they cheered themselves hoarse. </p> <p>Earlier that day, we'd been in a small town called Tifton. Clinton had delivered the usual stump speech, his throat sore, when it began to pour with rain. The reporters ran for cover, inside a makeshift press room where there was the usual supply of chicken drumsticks and Diet Coke. Eventually an Israeli journalist tapped me on the shoulder. \"Come outside,\" he said. \"Look at this.\" </p> <p>The candidate was still out there, shaking the hands of fewer than a dozen elderly voters who had stayed out in the rain. He was talking to each one - not just a \"Hi, how are you,\" but a proper conversation - as the rain streamed down his face and theirs. His aides were urging him to hurry out, desperate to whisk him on to the bus and into a new shirt. This was not a pose to show how much he cared about ordinary people: there was not a single camera to record it. Besides me and the Israeli, no one saw it. But Clinton did it all the same. </p> <p>Who knows why? Maybe the legend was right: maybe Clinton believed that so long as he met every single voter in America, they would all vote for him. Maybe his childhood (widowed mother, alcoholic stepfather) had left him with a near-addictive need for human contact, affection and adulation. Maybe he just cared. </p> <p>Either way, it worked and worked. The crowds got bigger, his voice got hoarser and the empathy gift won that election. I returned to London determined to get work in America that would let me see the next chapter of the story: how Clinton the candidate would become Clinton the president. </p> <p>The transition was not easy. A dozen books have recounted the political errors of those first months. Day one saw a promise to let gays into the military, a move which only confirmed the brass's worst suspicions about the new, draft-dodging commander-in-chief. Later Hillary Clinton took control of healthcare reform - a move that would bring the administration's greatest defeat. The first lady presented Congress with an almost comically complicated blueprint for a new system: expressed as a diagram, it looked like a circuit-board for the space shuttle. The fact that the plan had been hatched by a taskforce of wonks meeting with Hillary in secret added to its Soviet-era aura. By 1994 the plan was dead, and the Clinton administration badly wounded. </p> <p> Things were no easier for the president himself. The Washington establishment was not sure what to make of this brash southern newcomer. They were both excited by and disdainful of him. They sniffed at the Arkansans who piled into town, supporting their beloved Razorbacks football team with the uncouth chant \"Oooo pig soo-eeee!\" For the Washington elite, Clinton and his friends were hicks, plain and simple. </p> <p>The greybeards also disdained his way of doing business. They heard that the president would have long \"bull sessions\" more akin to the college seminar room than the Oval Office. They saw the pizza delivery bikes skidding up to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, as the young, novice staff worked through the night. While Bush had been a grown-up, Clinton's White House seemed to lack adult supervision. </p> <p>The word of the hour back then was \"unpresidential\". The Washington snobs disliked Clinton's habit of answering reporters' questions while still out of breath, pale thighs wobbling. They winced when he answered an MTV inquiry about his taste in underwear: \"Boxers or briefs?\" </p> <p>What the scolds did not realise was that all this \"unpresidential\" behaviour was connected to the president's greatest strength: his common touch. He was comfortable with people. So when a little girl, invited to the Oval Office to take part in a candle-lighting ceremony to mark the Jewish festival of Chanukah, yelped as her hair caught fire, guess who put out the flames and calmed her nerves? Not an aide, but the prez himself. </p> <p>Clinton was like that Star Trek character, the empath, who can psychically read the emotions of those before him; he had a mind-reader's ability to see into the hearts of any individual or group he faced. </p> <p>I saw the trick at work in Baltimore, when the president was out selling his healthcare package. He was addressing an outdoor crowd of thousands of hospital staff. I was standing among a group of nurses, who began chatting and whispering. Their minds were wandering. Somehow, from faraway, Clinton sensed it. He suddenly declared that his plan really mattered, that it would affect all of them, nurses especially - and that they all had to listen up. The women around me hushed. </p> <p>The gift did not save him from the failure of the healthcare programme, a defeat that was endorsed by 1994's mid-term elections, which the Republicans won by a landslide. Overnight Newt Gingrich became the hottest politician in America, cheerily explaining that he would be prime minister to Clinton's now largely ceremonial president. Soon Clinton was forced to tell a press conference why he and his office were still \"relevant\". </p> <p>But the mood changed. On April 19 1995 a right-wing extremist detonated a bomb at a government building in Oklahoma City, leaving 168 dead. Suddenly the anti-government bile of Gingrich's revolutionaries left a much harsher taste in the mouth: America had seen where such talk could lead. </p> <p>Clinton stepped forward as the calmer voice, leading the Oklahoma families in mourning. Perhaps for the first time, he looked presidential - a father of the nation at a moment of crisis. Just then, America needed a leader who would feel their pain. </p> <p>In fact, though no official would ever say it out loud, mourning worked well for Clinton: he gave good funeral. He knew how to touch just the right nerve. I remember a ceremony at Arlington National Cemetery, dedicating a memorial to those who had died in the Lockerbie bombing. He spoke well, as always, but it was afterwards that he came into his own. A huddle of relatives gathered around him. He spoke to each of them, but then he extended his big hands to reach the ones who had not pressed forward, the ones too shy to approach the president themselves. He encouraged them and beckoned them closer, his eyes finding the hesitant widow or retiring father who was holding back. Again, I looked around: no cameras. The TV crews had already got their pictures; Clinton was not doing it for appearances' sake. He stayed there a full hour over schedule, maddening his handlers and listening to the stories of bereaved loved ones - and not a word was ever written about it. </p> <p>This talent or knack or psychosis - whatever it was, it secured Clinton's position as president. Groups who had once been suspicious began to like and eventually adore him. </p> <p>Take black Americans. In 1992 they had big doubts about Clinton. He was a white politician from the deep south, a Democrat who had signalled his \"centrist\" credentials by attacking black rapper Sister Souljah and by breaking off from the campaign to return to his home state - to order the execution of a retarded black man convicted of murder. </p> <p> Yet within a few years Clinton would be hailed by Toni Morrison, the African-American Nobel laureate, as \"our first black president\" and by the rapper Ice-T as \"a brother\". What had changed? Clinton had saved affirmative action from the Republican axe, but he'd also signed a welfare reform bill which hit black families hard. No, it wasn't policy which sealed the bond between Clinton and black America. It was a more subtle connection. The president displayed a comfort with black audiences that was unheard of among white politicians. He could deliver an impromptu speech-cum-sermon from the pulpit of a black church that had civil rights activists admitting they had heard nothing so inspiring since the days of Martin Luther King. The result is a white president who enjoys 95% approval ratings among African-Americans to this very day. </p> <p>Jewish voters tell a similar story. They were wary of a southern baptist Democrat in 1992: they feared he might be another Jimmy Carter, too sympathetic to the Palestinians. But Clinton reassured them, using his secret weapon: emotional intelligence. It was his instinct and body language that led to that 1993 handshake on the White House lawn between the PLO's Yasser Arafat and Israel's Yitzhak Rabin. And when Rabin was assassinated two years later, it was Clinton who knew how to massage Israel's wounded spirit. He spoke to them, via TV, in their own language, addressing the dead Rabin with the words \"Shalom chaver\" - goodbye friend. The phrase had not existed in Hebrew before then; now it's common Israeli parlance. And so, in 1996, Jewish Americans turned out - alongside blacks and women and Hispanics and trade unions and every other group who felt understood by Clinton - to give him four more years. </p> <p>I took that as my cue to head back to Britain. I reckoned we'd seen the best of Clinton. The second term would be more of the same, only less so. And for the first year, 1997, I seemed to be vindicated: the economy prospered on auto-pilot and Clinton barely had to break a sweat. But in the first weeks of 1998 the sky fell in. The allegations of a dress-staining affair with a White House intern, Monica Lewinsky, the finger-wagging denial, the talk of perjury and impeachment - it all came so fast. The Washington punditocracy predicted that the Arkansas hick would be sent back to Little Rock by the end of the week. But they forgot who they were dealing with. Clinton was not just the Comeback Kid, the Houdini who had survived a thousand scrapes. He was also the empath-in-chief, and now he got the return on his investment: the American people empathised back. </p> <p>They had already forgiven or ignored the waves of scandal that had broken with every season of the first term: Whitewater, Travelgate, Filegate and all the other gates never really swung. The American people apparently felt the same way about the president as a former Arkansas state senator I once interviewed. He had worked with the then governor throughout the 1980s and had little sympathy for him politically. But he was adamant: \"Bill Clinton doesn't give duck crap about money.\" Americans could see that for themselves: they had a president who had never owned his own house (he had lived in the Arkansas governor's mansion since he was 32, moving from there directly to the White House). He may have been a shameless hustler after votes, but few voters believed Clinton was ever in the business of lining his own pockets. That's why all the stuff about Whitewater never stuck. </p> <p>Zippergate was different: Clinton may not have lusted after cash, but Americans knew he lusted after flesh. They knew, too, that he had an indisciplined, selfish, self-indulgent streak. They knew he could be reckless and self-destructive, taking a risk he must have known could have ended his presidency. </p> <p>But here's where empathy became a two-way street. Despite a year-long hammering from the Republicans, and a press united in its disgust for the president's actions, the public stood by him. Americans told pollsters they hated what Clinton had done but, from the first revelations in January 1998 to the senate trial a year later, they remained consistent, approving his performance as president and insisting that he should not be removed from office. </p> <p>They understood him, just as he had understood them. He had always seemed to cut them a little slack, and now they returned the compliment. In the autumn of 1998 they watched the tapes of a beleaguered president assaulted by excruciatingly personal questions from Kenneth Starr's prosecutors - grainy footage with the visual grammar of a hostage video - and they sided with him. Just like Hillary, they stood by their man. </p> <p>Once, when speaking about his faith, Clinton described the God he believed in as \"the God of second chances\" - and he let out a little smile. That was the Clinton of early 1999: a lucky man, blessed with forgiveness. </p> <p>In the end, he was less Houdini than Rasputin. The Republicans tried and tried to kill him, but they failed, destroying themselves in the attempt. Where are his enemies now? Gingrich was forced out of the Speaker's chair after the impeachment debacle, so was his successor. The rest of the president's persecutors in the House are in tight congressional races today, desperate just to hold on to their seats. </p> <p>And as for Clinton, this is his last day in total command. I can look back now on the last eight years and admit that we, those of us who covered him, were spoiled. We saw a president with towering political skills and a serious intellect - a man who could rattle off the fine-print detail of any policy programme anywhere in America and discuss the domestic politics of most countries in the world, a leader who would think nothing of calling up the great academics and writers of the day, often in the small hours, for a late-night, unarranged t\u00e9-te-\u00e0-t\u00e9te. </p> <p>And there was that gift for people. I admit it, it spoiled me - it even skewed my judgment. I came back from America to cover Britain's 1997 election, and was soon whispering to friends my anxiety that Tony Blair's success was far from assured: he got such little enthusiasm from the crowds. I'd got used to winning candidates getting a Clinton-sized response. Now I can see that I had witnessed a once-in-a-lifetime phenomenon. Like someone who heard Sinatra sing in the 1950s or watched John McEnroe play tennis in the 1980s, I had seen a maestro at the height of his powers. Clinton was the Pele of politics, and we might wait half a century to see his like again. </p> <p>Today America is choosing between two half-Clintons. They can have a version of his smarts, in Al Gore, or a version of his warmth, in George W Bush. Clinton wants the voters to choose Gore, of course, to protect his legacy. But if America picks Bush, that will be a kind of compliment, too. For it will prove that an ability to connect, which Bush has and Gore does not, is now an indispensable part of the job - thanks to Clinton, the king of empathy. </p> <p>Smarts or warmth, one or the other is on offer today. Voters who want both will just have to wait. Or they can take one last look at the man from Hope - and remember.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Q:</strong> You appear to leap from genre to genre, do you programme those leaps into the development stage?</p> <p><strong>JS:</strong> Looking for some juicy new genre to attack? It hasn't necessarily been problematic, but I think there's two things that have happened as the years go by. One related to the nerd side of me, which is an engagement with the film's historical record and the traditions, and many of them are Hollywood traditions that Hollywood itself has just forgotten as the fads pile up. I think the engagement with that, those tasks, is very enriching for me personally. For Ang it's a different tack, but it's also quite similar, to rub up against those traditions, to continually test your craft, to treat yourself as a craftsperson as well as an artist. There's a certain luxury associated with that exercise. So I think that the generic imperative is going to continue, we don't necessarily have one that we're dying to do next. Although musicals have been bandied around a bit. . .</p> <p>[Laughter]</p> <p>But we haven't really decided yet.</p> <p><strong>AL:</strong> That's the beauty of working with James, I think, a film professor. You know, whenever I am tired of doing this one, abundant sources come my way. Swoosh! So writing the script is the least interesting thing to us. It's what film we're going to create, what fun we're going to have, what kind of angle are we going to put on it, what juice are we going to put in. That was the real fun, not genre or script writing - you know, craft, what fun we're going to have. </p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon seems to be a big leap of faith. What was the danger? The financial risk?</p> <p><strong>AL:</strong> Of course it was a big risk. A lot of stress. It was something I've wanted to do for a long time, but didn't really have the skill until I'd made six films. Then I was ready to take the challenge. I think the biggest challenge I had was doing a genre film that takes a lot of money to make, and on top of that I want to make A-grade drama, and see if I can keep a balance and have both of them benefit each other. On top of that, I want to do a big landscape in China. So all of that is very challenging. To me it is important after three English-language films that I go back to my cultural roots, to fulfill my boyhood dreams. But it also a new adventure, because that kind of film-making is low budget in America but is titanic in China. There are no rules. We get to make the rules. There's no producer to look over my shoulder. There is no set standard. Of course, I keep testing the limit. </p> <p>James will tell you the story of how much each area would give for an Ang Lee film with Chow Yun-Fat and Michelle Yeoh. Then they would give us a number and we would come up with that budget. James can fill you in. It's a very interesting process, the financial process, and what's at stake. Once the money's raised, we're OK, we're making the movie. But for the investors, the movie has to make $60m to break even. No Chinese film has ever come close to that. It's a kind of mission impossible. But it's what we want to do. [<a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/film/LeeSchamus/4.ra\">Listen to the soundclip</a>] (1 min 45)</p> <p><strong>JS:</strong> Well, these were interesting circumstances to go asking for money in Hollywood for Ang for a Chinese-language film. Namely because after the 'blockbuster' success of The Ice Storm and the 'firestorm of praise and heaps of money' that showered upon us after Ride with the Devil. . . Basically, if this film didn't work, Ang would be directing segments for Fox TV's Scariest Animal Moments. . . so there was a little bit of iffyness involved. And the Taiwanese billionaire who pledged to put up all the money, I don't know, maybe it was a bad mahjong day or something. . .</p> <p><strong>AL:</strong> It was the Asian economic storm. . .</p> <p><strong>JS:</strong> The virus. Anyhow. So we had to pull numbers out of Europe, and particularly a lot of long-standing friends and the distribution community here, who still had faith in Ang, and prove with those numbers that this film could support a budget of X dollars. At that point we brought in Sony Pictures Classics in the States, another Sony - the Columbia Pictures, Asia and then the Sony entity of Columbia Pictures International in order to pick up the other territories, including the Asian territories and Latin America. There was this corporate family who came in to put the pieces together and help us make the film. But at that point it was also a corporate family whose cookie jar was empty. So we had to bank all these contracts, we had to find a bank that was crazy enough to do that, and that was in France. Then we had to get a bond company to insure the movie, because the bank wouldn't give us any money until we had an insurance policy that said we would deliver this wacky movie that was being shot all over China. So they were in Los Angeles. And then we had the Taiwanese production end. But in order to close the deals, for tax reasons (it's a complicated story), they had to set up a subsidiary in the British Virgin Islands. Our limited liability corporation, that we set up in the United States, had the sub-licence to English-language rights. So we ended up with literally thousands of pages of legal documentation, all of which had to be signed in a circular way - one of those things where the guy in Italy isn't going to sign until the guy in France has signed. Meanwhile they were in Beijing already, pre-producing the movie and more or less mortgaging Ang's house. So it was a little iffy.</p> <p><strong>NN:</strong> All of which could have been put at risk by one or two tiny accidents, like Michelle Yeoh messing up her knee quite early on in the shoot?</p> <p><strong>AL:</strong> Yes, second week of shooting, unfortunately. Doing a spinning flying-kick, something she did thousands of times. But she didn't pay attention and it was at the end of a night's shooting, and 'crack', she snapped her knee ligament and has to be sent away for surgery. For about 2 1/2 months we have to reschedule everything. It was a nightmare. The movie started out shooting in the Gobi desert - it was just a logistical nightmare - sandstorms, lost in the desertand flood. In the desert. Two weeks of rain!</p> <p>[Laughter]</p> <p><strong>JS:</strong> The locals went up to our producer, Bill Kong, who had been burning incense each day for good luck and getting none of it. They said, 'Thank you so much for burning that incense, because that's what we do when we want rain!'</p> <p><strong>AL:</strong> So the whole production was like that. Nothing worked. Every little detail I had to, like, kill myself, kill everybody, just to make it work. The whole production was like that. I thought I was dying sometimes. I don't know how I lived through that. When people ask me about a sequel. . .</p> <p>[Laughter]</p> <p>It's just insane. <br><a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/film/LeeSchamus/5.ra\">Listen to the soundclip</a> (1 min 37)</p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> Is the novel of Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon available here?</p> <p><strong>JS:</strong> We're trying to arrange it. . . well, there was an abridged version of the novel published in Taiwan and they're trying to arrange a translation of that abridged version. Of course, that abridged version was copyright piracy. . . Oh yeah. .. So who knows if they'll cut through that.</p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> Are you both fans of the martial arts genre, and if so, which are your favourite directors in the genre?</p> <p><strong>AL:</strong> I grew up with it. I'm a big fan. When I was younger it's the storytelling that really grabbed me, the fantasy storytelling, about power, about personal transcendence, about romance. Morality tales. A secret joy we had when growing up. As I grew a little older, the Hong Kong choreographers took over the genre and made fantastic fight sequences. Of course, they don't really care what's in between the fights. So that film language really fascinated me as a young film student. So it really fascinated me in both ways. I really wanted to hit the high notes of the Hong Kong action standards, while I have the fantastic movie and the applause and everything else. So that's something I've always wanted to do. </p> <p>Among those directors, King Hu is more of a director to look up to, and Chang Che is one of them. The recent ones, they don't really influence me except some of the really classic fighting sequences - the stories I didn't care for much.</p> <p><strong>JS:</strong> I saw a fair amount when we were researching the film. My current favourite is Chang Che, who was working in the 60s and 70s, and if you ever get the chance to score a tape of One-armed Swordsman. . . These are incredibly brutal, queer, kind of sadomasochistic fight movies, with all these greased-up guys chopping each other to bits. They're pretty fun!</p> <p>[Laughter]</p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> I heard you were planning a prequel next year and also is it true that Chow Yun-Fat has declared that he is taking a break from film for the next year and a half?</p> <p><strong>JS:</strong> If I were Chow and had made this movie with this guy - I wouldn't work again.</p> <p><strong>AL:</strong> Not next year. I couldn't take it anymore. I'm so exhausted. I probably need to make one or two English-language films to recover from it. Physically I can't take it anymore.</p> <p><strong>JS:</strong> But don't worry, they'll be 20 other Chinese movies with the title Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon - the Prequel, coming out next year. . .</p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> You portray very interesting female characters in your movies. You don't see that very often in films, so where do you get your ideas from?</p> <p><strong>AL:</strong> From my wife, I suppose. Seriously. And my ex-girlfriend. Actually I was brought up in a very chauvinist, traditional Chinese male way, but at heart I guess I'm just not a macho guy. I'm not going to be John Woo. Strong women attract me in real life, and in dramatic context. A strong woman, when her heart is broken, it breaks my heart. It's something that speaks for me very well. When there are such characters in the text, I just tend to grab them. I don't know why. It's just chemistry find that I do a much better job with strong female characters than anything else. </p> <p>Somehow in Asia, I notice, women make up 80 per cent of my audience. So you see women with crouching men sitting next to them [pulls the face of a very quiet, small man]maybe at The Wedding Banquet you'll see a couple of guys. </p> <p>I think it is also a refreshing angle to check into repressed male-dominated society. Particularly for this one, which is a very macho genre, it just gives a different angle. There is a deeper emotional depth because we are taking an emotional tour with the heroines. I just like that. It's the best thing I can offer, I suppose. [<a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/film/LeeSchamus/6.ra\">Listen to the soundclip</a> (2 mins 25) </p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> Could you speak about the fight sequence in the forest at the end of the movie - how long did it take?</p> <p><strong>AL:</strong> It took two weeks to shoot that scene. Most of it is on the editing floor. . . it was just a crazy idea that I had and everyone refused to do it for months. There is no shortage of swordfighting in bamboo forests, because bamboo provides a very romantic environment. In China, bamboo symbolises righteousness - it shoots straight up, it's elastic, like the swordsmanship. Also it provides a very interesting foreground. But normally no-one ever gets up there because it's undo-able. That's why I wanted to do it.</p> <p>The colour of green is really the Hidden Dragon for me in the movie, against the colour of red in the desert flashback. The crouching one, the forbidden one to me is really green. The Green Destiny, Jade-eyed Fox. Anything green, with a little bit of white, is very sexy and taboo-ish for me. So I thought the bamboo choreographed sequence really, in an abstract way, is mesmerising. It's not really a fight. I thought it was a good place to do it. You know, we live in a place with gravity. I sort of underestimate that. </p> <p>It's very painful for the actors and I worry about their safety. They were down in the bamboo forest in the southern part of China, in the valleys. It's hard to get a big construction crane in there. We managed to get four or five in there and hang the actors up. There's the valley and the creek, so they're really high up there, and we had to build platforms for the tighter shots. Once you cut the bamboo, the leaves dwindle. Only on drizzling days can you shoot for half an hour, then you have to change the bamboo again. It's really painful But it's a crazy idea.</p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> I wasn't really sure about the flashback scenes. Why did you spend so long in the desert when it didn't seem to be crucial to the film? And also, how does scriptwriting work in terms of there having to be a constant translation between English and Chinese?</p> <p><strong>JS:</strong> I can answer the first question about the flashback: It's a big mistake, we're sorry.</p> <p>[Laughter]</p> <p>It was a very big topic for us. In general, every time I see the movie, which is less and less (but he [Ang Lee] sits through it all the time!) I think, 'I can't believe we got away with this!' All of a sudden, for 20 minutes, they go back there. . . and it's completely unapologetic, it's like cut/back, cut/back. We're ready to take it on the chin a bit, hence my feistiness. But there are a lot of reasons why we love the flashback. </p> <p>But I'll tell you a little about the scriptwriting process. It was extremely educational for me, and extremely painful for Ang. We started with a Chinese-language draft, and then Ang made a precis of the parts of the fourth volume that were most important to him. Then I wrote this completely entertaining swash-buckling romantic adventurous epic movie, that was a joke to the Chinese who reading it. I use the analogy that if a Chinese person wrote a John Wayne western, and he rides into town, gets off his horse, walks over to the sheriff, says 'Howdy' and then, like, kow-tows nine times. . .</p> <p>[Laughter]</p> <p>But the structure was there. I think if I was Chinese it would be a nightmare parody of my entire culture. But structurally, I think, it still ended up working. Then Ang and Hui-Ling Huang really took it over and from inside-out really transformed the film, and really got into a lot of the cultural references, indices - the soul, which I had misread. Even though I'd read a lot of Chinese stuff in English translation and seen a lot of movies, I misread almost every cue. So it was great that the process became six months of mutual torture through bad translation . . .can you imagine trying to write your script and have somebody who had been fired from the UN doing bad translation? . . . I always thought we were going to make a movie that was understandable to westerners, but still very Chinese, and I still think essentially it's a Chinese film. But in a way I also recognise that why the film has been so massively successful in Asia is not because it retained its Asian identity, but because of all these wonderful new things that came about in discourse with the west. Especially in regards to the female characters and the romance, which are very foreign to the genre. I think that one of the things I find people responding to here in the west is precisely the fact that you get to see a two-hour Taoist action movie. The Chinese-ness of it, even if it's not always entirely comprehensible because of the subtitles, I think that's what's so profoundly new about it. So in a way we ended up making an eastern movie for western audiences and in some ways a more western movie for eastern audiences. [<a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/film/LeeSchamus/7.ra\">Listen to the soundclip</a>] (2 mins 27)</p> <p> <strong>AL:</strong> To me, James is the best writer I personally know of. Take this film, it has to hit Asia like a summer blockbuster, but at the same time it has to be in the art-house cinemas and the New York Film Festival. So from the New York Film Festival to Asian blockbuster is a big range to cover. James doesn't know Chinese, but the structure and the film logic and the sellability, marketability and the pure grade of how good the script is. I do need his help, that's just the bottom line. It's painful for me to say so, but Goddamn it, it's so true.</p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> I just have a comment, not a question. I found Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon exhilarating and profoundly moving.

  "<p><strong>NN:</strong> Let's start with Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. This is based on the fourth of a five-part novel sequence, a sort of Chinese Pulp Fiction. At what stage did you see the possibility of a film within this?</p> <p> <strong>AL:</strong> I read the book through a friend of mine who knew I was a fan of this particular writer in 1994. The fourth volume, which is the story of a young girl, Jen, struck me that there was a movie there. When there is a strong woman character in a story - that always grabs me. Especially in this very macho genre, which since boyhood I've wanted to do. It felt as if it took six movies for me to even begin to earn the right to make this kind of movie. Of course, I'm growing up, I'm an established film-maker, known for making family dramas about personal relationships, I cannot go all the way and make a purely genre film, I've got to throw everything I know into the movie - like a combination platter. The key is to keep the balance. </p> <p>I think the book struck me in a few ways that I thought very interesting to pick it as my first martial arts film. It has a very strong female character and it was very abundant in classic Chinese textures. Usually these pulp fiction books are set aside from the lawful society - they create a world called Giang Hu, which is an entanglement, a relationship with the underworld, with swordsmanship - almost like a fairytale. But this one is not quite that way, it is very abundant in what I care about - and also to do with the process of Chinese history, which has been lost, classic Chinese textures, which I know from history, my parents, from movies. It gives the impression of China which is kind of like the hidden dragon in me, in some ways, and I feel I want to pursue it. </p> <p>At the same time I was offered Sense and Sensibility - I couldn't refuse that job, it was just too good a job - so I made that. Meanwhile, the Ice Storm was still in development, And that was something I really wanted to do, and frankly I don't think I was ready to do a big production like this. Then I did another movie, Ride with the Devil, and then I thought I was ready. Going back after three major league productions, English-language films, including one somewhat action film, Ride with the Devil, I thought I was ready. I was, you know, tougher. And then James can tell you about the scripting process. There's the script and financing. Meanwhile, I went to Beijing and started to do location scouting. It's a process of two years. Five, six months of pre-production, then five months of shooting and five months of post-production and then seven or eight months in promotions.</p> <p><strong>NN:</strong> The remarkable thing about this being a Chinese production is that there are resonant myths with the west. For example, the Green Destiny sword can be compared to Excalibur in Arthurian legend. And there seem to be bits of Hamlet dotted all over the film. Was this embedded in the text itself, or was it something you drew out in order to make it more universal?</p> <p><strong>AL:</strong> I think people are universal. I took the name Green Destiny from - well there is such a sword called Green Destiny. It is green because you keep twisting it, it's an ancient skill, you keep twisting it and knocking it and twisting it until it is very elastic and light. Swoosh! It swings like that, you know? </p> <p>Green Destiny is a name which is derived from the book, and I took the name and I go further with the Taoist philosophy. The jade fox - the old green, the murky green that's what the green really means. It is the ultimate yin-ness. Yin and yan where everything exists in and derives from. . . this is hard to explain. The most mysterious feminine factor, the existence that we men, we don't know. It's woman. It's feminine. That's what the sword is about. That's the symbolic meaning of the sword. Even in Chinese you probably don't get that. . . I don't know. But that's for me. Anything green is hidden dragon, desires and repression. . . something weird when you dig into the depth. I think there is something like that in Excalibur, for example. . .</p> <p>We didn't exactly have that in mind for a western audience. For a western audience, I think between James and me, the bouncing passing forth between Chinese and English, I think it is a good exercise to make it reasonable for a worldwide audience - not just a western audience - a worldwide audience and to some degree a modern Chinese audience as well. Things and logic that we used to take for granted in the Orient might not be that logical today. It's a good exam - how to tell a story with a global sense. That means more layout of the texture of society, more explanation of rules of the games. For example, the first fight does not ensue until 15 minutes into the movie. To a Chinese audience it must feel like 30 minutes - 'Are we gonna see a fight or what?' Usually with this genre the first thing that happens is a good fight sequence to show that you're in good hands. So we broke that rule. I think a lot of that comes from the western audience. </p> <p>I also I didn't want to make just a martial arts film, you know, there's drama in it. I think there is somewhat of a western three-act structure that lays things out. Starting with a crisis or an action, things like that, or verbalising a relationship. </p> <p><strong>NN:</strong> James, I know you've worked on all of Ang's scripts, aside from Sense and Sensibility, but you've worked on all of Ang's films. But never anything like this. What sort of a challenge was it for you to tackle the stunt aspect of the script?</p> <p><strong>JS:</strong> It was an amazing challenge, because in fact I didn't do it. </p> <p>[Laughter]</p> <p>On the first draft of the script I had a little preamble. As you go through the scenes and get to the fight scene, I remember exactly the language I used - 'They fight'. The preamble said, 'While I fail to explain the fight scenes, I can assure you that they will be the greatest fight scenes ever written in cinema history. Period.' And that was our pitch to the distributors we were selling the film to at that time. I knew two things. One was that Ang was going to insist on crafting fight sequences that were not simply the kind of western fight sequences where there's a bad guy who wants to kill the good guy, while the good guy doesn't really want to kill the bad guy - but in the fight the bad guy gets the upper hand, and it looks like the good guy's going to die, but at the last minute the good guy kills the bad guy. Only he doesn't kill the bad guy he just disables him, then the bad guy finally gets out of the tub with the knife and the good guy has to kill him. </p> <p>[Laughter]</p> <p>So I knew that they were going to be expressions of relationships and meaningful. Because in most of the fights in this movie, one person really doesn't want to fight. So it's a really interesting situation, having to make dramatic fight scenes when they are more or less than that. So I knew that Ang, and in particular our martial arts choreographer, Yuen Woo-Ping, would work all this stuff out on set in pre-production. It's one of those great ironies that when we mention Yuen Woo-Ping over here in the west it's always suffixed by 'of The Matrix fame'. Because he did do the choreography for The Matrix, which we loved, but of course we know him as the guy who created Jackie Chan's career and Jet Li's career. And it's amazing to see 30 years later, full circle, the cultures revolving, and so Yuen Woo-Ping returns to us as the guy who did The Matrix.</p> <p><strong>NN:</strong> As the film was being put together there were reports about the different castings. I gather that Jet Li was in fact considered for the main role and I understand that you were planning two language versions - one in English and one in Mandarin. Is that true?</p> <p><strong>AL:</strong> That was just a thought. Is it do-able? I don't know. Has anyone done it before? I don't know. It seemed to be a waste of time to shoot two versions. Am I going to direct them with equal intensity? All of the actors had better Chinese than English. Are they going to struggle with their English? Production-wise it doesn't make sense. Unless there were, like, 50 lines in the movie, then maybe I could manage to do that. But there are too many lines in the movie. So I decided not to do that and stick with Mandarin.</p> <p>Yeah, Jet Li, the first thing you think about when doing a martial arts film is him. But at that time it was a much smaller project, I really intended to make the movie as Sense and Sensibility with martial arts [laughs]. . . a two woman story. . . So the men are just generally supporting roles, just a touch, just a vehicle for their romance and conflict. So Jet Li was invited . . . but it didn't work out. . . </p> <p>Anyway, Chow Yun-Fat was the next big movie star. I don't see that as a Jackie Chan part.</p> <p>[Laughter]</p> <p>Chow Yun-Fat said he will never play a period piece. Will never shave his head and have a ponytail. He's never held a sword before. But I know he's a good actor, and drop-dead gorgeous and everything, so I show him the script and, at that stage, he is willing to take the job. So I was very moved. So he is not going to do tumbling and all kinds of fantastic Jet Li-styles of fighting, so the fighting gets reduced and his part gets really beefed-up. His relation with Michelle Yeoh really gets beefed up, and the part really becomes a romantic lead. I think, thinking back, we were lucky to have him. The movie is more a romantic drama. </p> <p><strong>NN:</strong> So the fact that you cast him changed the emotional weight of the movie?</p> <p><strong>AL:</strong> Yes. I always do that. Sometimes it happens in the writing, sometimes in the directing. Like Zhang Zi-Yi, the young girl, she didn't turn out to be the way I see the part, so I have to veer the movie towards her and make it work. I think I am the actors' tailor. As far as casting is concerned, until the last moment of the music is composed, the job is not done. The whole process is casting. You have to make them look like they're perfectly cast. </p> <p><strong>NN:</strong> Your last four films have been based on novels. Rick Moody's The Ice Storm, Austen's Sense and Sensibility and Daniel Woodrell's book Woe to Live On and now this. When you have a source material to work from, do you think in a different way when you approach the script? James?</p> <p><strong>JS:</strong> Oh, me?</p> <p><strong>NN:</strong> Well, both of you. . . </p> <p>[Laughter]</p> <p><strong>AL:</strong> It's running out of things to write about. That's why I adapt. . . </p> <p><strong>JS:</strong> Well essentially it means I can get away with a first draft just by ripping off somebody else. . . </p> <p>[Laughter]</p> <p>Which is a great comfort. Because that first stage is just going through and underlining all the juicy bits and then trying to run them in some kind of order that makes sense cinematically. Then the hard part actually does take over, and you realise that novels don't simply translate into movies. Assuming that the world the novel created for you is the basis for the enjoyment of the script and the film is a deadly error. Because that world doesn't exist once you're dealing in cinematic terms - you have to create it every step of the way. It's like film production itself. </p> <p>My partner Ted Hope, at Good Machine, who started as an assistant director, the guy who ran the set, used to say it's like a Phillip K Dick novel, if you don't think about the floor, it's not there and you fall through it. And to a certain extent it's the same adapting novels, you suddenly realise you've forgotten what you need to do to make it into a movie. So it's an interesting process, it's a good process for lazy people, because the first stage is so easy, and it's a good process for procrastinators, because you already have a draft before you even start thinking about making a movie.</p> <p><strong>NN:</strong> Does this mean that we're not going to have any more original Ang Lee scripts?</p> <p><strong>AL:</strong> There could be an original James Schamus script. . . I don't care about writing really. When I started out, nobody gave me scripts, so I had to write. . . That's why I wrote family drama - I'm a domestic person, it's all I know! Now I'm kind of established as a director, I much prefer directing to writing. Writing's lonely. Directing, I get all kinds of inspiration. It's working with people. It's a lot more fun. When I have a full schedule like that, I don't see myself sitting there for a couple of months, doing the research, going through a painful process, it's just not my thing anymore. I grab the life I have to direct as many movies as I can. [<a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/film/LeeSchamus/1.ra\">Listen to the soundclip</a>] (58 seconds)</p> <p> <strong>NN:</strong> Let's look at that early stage, about 1985. You were at NYU film school, you had a couple of scripts, you were not being able to get films made. So you sent two scripts into a competition run by the Taiwanese government. These scripts were Pushing Hands, which won the first prize, and The Wedding Banquet, which won second prize. Not a bad way to start! That gave you the impetus to get a film made. Enter Good Machine, James's company. How did that meeting of minds come about?</p> <p><strong>AL:</strong> When I sent those scripts, that was the lowest point of my life. We'd just had our second son, and when I went to collect them from hospital, I went to the bank to try and get some money to buy some diapers, the screen showed I've got $26 left. Terrible. Anyway, my first Chinese script was The Wedding Banquet, it was written six years before it was made into a film. At that time making a Chinese-language film in America was inconceivable, no-one would give me money, no matter how small it was. And it was gay-related subject matter, so I couldn't raise the money in Taiwan either, so it just sat there. </p> <p>Then at the end of 1989 a friend of mine saw an advert that that year they were expanding the script competition to off-sea Chinese. The top award was equivalent to $16,000 - good money. I had this idea of Pushing Hands and the old Tai-Chi master for a long time but I never wanted to write it. I felt like in that six years I was sitting there like an old Tai-Chi master at home, going nowhere.</p> <p>[Laughter]</p> <p>I never meant to make that movie, but I know that if I write that movie I can win the top prize from the Taiwanese government. So I wrote it for the sake of the competition. So I won it, and they sent me a ticket to receive the prize in Taiwan. So when I arrive they say, the studio, that they want to make three movies. It's related to the government, called Central Motion Pictures, and it had just changed management. They say they want to make three movies, one is going to be done by a new director, we know we're going to lose money so just do what you want.</p> <p>[Laughter]</p> <p>'The American wife in that part? Just don't choose anyone too ugly.'</p> <p>[Laughter]</p> <p>A third of the budget was funded by the government, a third is a video package deal they had, so there's only equivalent to $100,000 investment, so they said go ahead and do it. The story was set in New York, and I took the money, but I said, 'Give me a couple of days, I dunno if I want to do it.' I'd been waiting 10 years. . . I didn't want to make a flop. Anyway, I took the money and I was looking for a line producer, and through a friend of mine I knew Ted. And then there was Ted and James at the new-found Good Machine. They shared two tables with another company, I think. So I did my pitch. And they did their pitch. They told me that they were the kings of no-budget film-making in New York.</p> <p>[Laughter]</p> <p>James looked like a used-car salesman and a professor. . . And they said, 'Pay attention. We said 'no-budget' not 'low-budget'. Your money, about $400,000. . . </p> <p><strong>JS:</strong> 350</p> <p><strong>AL:</strong> '$350,000 is luxury for us.' They offered something very tempting to me. They said they were director-centered producers. They wanted to teach the directors how to make the movies that they can afford instead of spending time in development hell - and I'd just spent six years in there. . . so I know how that tastes. And over the years I'm just glad that these two guys, I'm just glad they're not crooks!</p> <p>[Laughter]</p> <p>And they did keep their promise. They did grow together with me and they still teach me how to make the movie I can afford. All the movies you see - small ones, bigger ones. . . they fumble along the way like I do. They're learning how to deal with bigger people and different situations, international money-raising and sales. The first movie, Pushing Hands, didn't make any money except in Taiwan, so James said, 'Let me help you with the script for the second one.' And that hit. The Wedding Banquet was international, and we were capable of doing one after another, Chinese, English. . . It is a very fruitful and nurturing relationship that we get to grow together. I now want them to teach me how to make Terminator 3. . . </p> <p> <strong>Sound clips</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/film/LeeSchamus/1.ra\">'I don't care about writing really.

  "<p><strong>NN:</strong> James, are you still a professor at Columbia?</p> <p><strong>JS:</strong> Yeah, I'm keeping the day job. . . I hooked up with Ted Hope - he dropped out of film school, or was kicked out, there's conflicting stories! . . But he worked his way up on set. I came out of the graduate programme in English Literature, I was a Miltonist, and then shifted into film theory at Berkeley and had no practical experience whatever. I realised that, when I came to New York, to be a producer you had to know how to use a phone and beg. That was a central ingredient to the package. And Ted brought the knowledge of how to make money once the begging had paid off. . . make the film I mean. So we had the wacky idea to get together, and in America, you know, more or less if you have a high-school equivalency diploma you can go and get a packet of business cards, and if you're Jo Schmo you're Jo Schmo Productions Inc. And that was us. </p> <p>Ted made a list of directors who had all made great short films but were yet to make features. He said we should really go after these folks, it was a really interesting list, and on it was Ang's name. Ang had made, six years prior, this wonderful short film called Fineline. I watched the film on tape and fell in love immediately. It was also Chazz Palminteri's first film. Just a fantastic movie. So, we called Ang's then agents and said, 'Hi, we're Ted and James of Good Machine, and we're interested in finding out what's up with Ang Lee. It seems to be a long time since he dropped off the face of the Earth.'</p> <p>[Laughter]</p> <p>And they said, 'Oh, you no-budget guys.' (They'd read some article I'd written about no-budget-blah-blah-blah-bullshit.) And they said, \"You can't touch Ang. he's got development deals at this studio and all that, go away.' And it was only by coincidence through a mutual friend of Ted's that Ang showed up at our office two weeks later. He said, 'You probably don't know who I am. I'm Ang Lee.' Needless to say, he doesn't have those agents anymore.</p> <p>He gave his pitch. Of course, as you know, in Hollywood the pitch is a very rarified art form that usually takes between two and five minutes, usually involves the screenwriter getting up from his chair and doing some kind of interpretive dance and then the door opening at the right moment with the telegram from the stripper who says 'Ta-da!' You know, this kind of thing, and they have it all worked out. Ang's pitch lasted almost an hour.</p> <p>[Laughter]</p> <p>You can imagine it. And I was listening to this guy thinking, 'This guy will never, never get a job. It's not gonna happen.'</p> <p>[Laughter]</p> <p>But when he left, I turned to Ted and said, 'The weird thing about that pitch - aside from how boring it was - was the fact. . . </p> <p>[Laughter]</p> <p>'. . . was the fact that he didn't actually PITCH the movie. He DESCRIBED the movie.' He had already made the movie, and he was actually talking about a film. And we sat down together for about five minutes after Ang left, and we talked through how he actually talked about it, or at least that portion that we actually heard, and it was amazing that he was actually describing a film. This guy was actually a film-maker. It was one of these exciting moments, like in a bad 60s sitcom, where Ted goes and I go [does a double-thumbs-up with a broad grin]. And then we did the movie. [<a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/film/LeeSchamus/2.ra\">Listen to the soundclip</a>] (2 mins 28)</p> <p><strong>NN:</strong> There is a sense, Ang, that there is a sort of emotional arc to you movies. You start off light, with three comedies, and then move into something darker with Ice Storm. . . </p> <p><strong>JS:</strong> Just for the record, I wrote that as a comedy. . . </p> <p><strong>NN:</strong> But they were more ambiguous - Ride with the Devil and now this. I know that for you film-making is a major emotional investment. How does this reflect on the films you have made?</p> <p><strong>AL:</strong> I think partly because I have grown older, and part of it is because I just got saturated - I just couldn't take those movies anymore. I think being successful for four movies was something out of my nature, and not much skill was involved. After The Wedding Banquet I was thinking of a change. You can see that in Eat Drink Man Woman, it's not darker, but it's more melancholy than the first two. The ending's more ambiguous. But what I really wanted to do at the time was The Ice Storm. Something less linear. Something more patchy, more like cubism. Something just 'kerck' [twists the air with his hands]. . . you know, give it a kick [pretends to stamp on something].</p> <p>[Laughter]</p> <p>But then I got offered Sense and Sensibility. I read it and wondered why they had sent the script to me. It's all about British introductions, somebody is introduced to somebody else and then. . . eight pages later so-and-so bows. . . so what did that have to do with me? But I was the guy that did social satire and family drama - that was how they saw Jane Austen should be interpreted and I was offered the job. I felt as if I know the world. . . really at heart, I know the material, except I have to do it in English with an English touch. So the cultural barrier and the major-league production was really the challenge, and I was ready to take the challenge. Of course, working with Emma Thompson was irresistible, and the film was to be made in England, not Hollywood, so I figured that was good natured. I still didn't know if we should do a $15m movie - probably we should do The Ice Storm first, somewhere around $4-8m. But then that week we saw some Hollywood movie and we thought, 'If a schmuck like that can make a movie, what are we afraid of?' So I took the job. After the success of Sense and Sensibility I just couldn't take it anymore, you know, the same tone anymore. Get so saturated by it. I don't know why I'm embarrassed about success. I just want to do a movie that could be a flop, maybe. . . </p> <p>I was very happy that I did that movie. In fact, I was very happy that I did all the movies I did. I was a very fortunate man. They are the movies. . . as long as I'm growing and working with these guys - they have a hard time, but I have a good time making those movies. And over the years they managed to pre-sell the film, so it reduces half the risk of the film. So I get to make those movies I want to make, with European territories as my backbones, and I can stretch the budget, and I could stretch the production value and the creative freedom and the kind of mass I can create. I enjoy it. </p> <p>Maybe the next thing, I'll try to get out of this tragic movie. But I'm very glad that I did this movie, that I have a better way of doing the tragic. I have to be conceptive, have to conceal in something I deliver so I don't give these guys such a hard time selling the movie [laughs]. I don't know. I just couldn't do Sense and Sensibility again. At least not for a while. There will be a time when I will be less cynical and I come back to have some pure fun.</p> <p><strong>NN:</strong> The broader significance of Crouching Tiger is that it could be one of the first foreign language films to break through the box-office in the west. We've had Il Postino or Life is Beautiful, maybe, but at the moment there is a definite sense that the really exciting work is all coming from the east. There are Asian film-makers leading the way. You think of the first wave, John Woo and Jackie Chan, and then another wave which is Ang, and Wong Kar-Wai, and Chen Kaige. They are starting to form a bridgehead in the west. Do either of you have any ideas as to why this situation should be at this particular time?</p> <p>[Ang and James look at each other, shrug and shake their heads]</p> <p><strong>AL:</strong> Maybe it's about time this happens. I'm just glad I'm part of the wave. I was born in a certain year. I waited six years, and it just happened. It also happened that our film industry took a dive. There was a time at the end of the 70s when no-one knew what to do anymore, so people got to make art films, which have to be personal to work in the first place, they have to be because they have no movie star, no big production value. Hong Kong is going through that change. . . Eventually it catches the eye of the art-house audience and, of course, the film festivals, and it becomes something filled with enthusiasm, the creative forces. . . we have a lot to say. It's not jaded yet. I think that's very. . . the reason you go to a movie is that you want to see something fresh. I think that's very exciting, creatively. These days you watch most mainstream American films and you see a beginning, a middle and an end. Some Chinese films, you still don't know what's going on at the end. . . </p> <p>[Laughter]</p> <p>It's very exciting. I think this year, film-makers have become more mature individually, and that's a good sign, it's not a trend that will come and go. I think it could be the beginning of a good development. In terms of subtitled movies, I'm just glad. . . I hope that this movie will break art-house ghettos, not that it doesn't have artistic values, but I hope that we break that barrier. I grew up with subtitles. To us, reading subtitles is the mainstream. I just hope that the cultural exchange can be more bilateral, more even. There's a big world out there. People, you know, they have a lot of stories to tell. Just read the Goddamn subtitles! Enjoy movies! Join the world!

  "Britain rejected calls yesterday from the president of the European commission, Romano Prodi, to abandon its veto on key areas of tax and immigration policy in the interests of streamlining decision-making to cope with the planned enlargement of the EU. <p>Mr Prodi, in his first speech in Britain as head of the commission, said in Birmingham that the system would be unable to cope if the number of EU members expanded from 15 to as many as 28 in the next decade or so. </p> <p>Mr Prodi said that an extension of qualified majority voting - used only for non-contentious issues at present - would allow the government to push its own initiatives through the EU more easily. Britain had the choice, he said: play a leading part in Europe or be left lagging. </p> <p>But his suggestion that the veto should be abandoned for taxation matters relating to the single market, fraud, immigration and e-commerce, met with a frosty response. Keith Vaz, the minister for Europe, who welcomed most of Mr Prodi's conciliatory speech, said the government rejected scrapping of the veto in any tax matters and any interference with immigration policy. </p> <p>\"We have made it clear that on tax, social security, border controls and immigration we will not consider qualified majority voting or the removal of the veto.\" Many other countries, he said, also had areas where they considered scrapping the veto to be off-limits. </p> <p>With the Conservatives keen to make Europe a pivotal issue at the next election, ministers are taking a tough line on the veto in advance of December's EU summit in Nice, where the agenda will be headed by the issue of reforming the system through which power is exercised and decisions reached. </p> <p>Mr Vaz said Britain was prepared to talk about majority voting in certain limited fields, such as the rules governing the European court of justice. </p> <p>Mr Prodi said that enlargement could not be achieved without deep-seated reform of the commission and of the structures of the union itself. </p> <p>\"I hope that decision-taking will be made more efficient, by moving to majority voting in key areas - not in all areas; but in those which are essential to an enlarged union. </p> <p>\"I feel strongly that we must make it easier to modernise and simplify EU laws. I know that in Britain many believe majority voting will reduce Britain's ability to say 'no' to the things it doesn't want. But I have to remind you: it is majority voting that eases the path of initiatives that Britain does want. In an enlarged EU of 28 or more countries, it is simply not possible to continue operating under a system which was conceived for the founding six.\" </p> <p>Mr Vaz welcomed Mr Prodi's repetition of Tony Blair's observation in Warsaw in September that Europe should be a superpower but not a superstate. \"I am Italian. I was proud to be prime minister of my country. I will not give up my national identity. And no one is threatening that I should,\" Mr Prodi said. \"So let me say this loud and clear: this commission is not calling for a European superstate. Let's forget that fallacy once and for all. </p> <p>\"We have become, and we will remain, interdependent. Europe wants the UK to play its rightful role in the union: a leading role. But the choice is yours ... a leading role, or a country left lagging behind.\" </p> <p>With Europe's single currency flagging, Mr Prodi studiously avoided mentioning possible British entry into the monetary system, though in this area, too, he argued at a later press conference that as a more active member of the club Britain would count more.</p>",
  "<p>When JK Rowling generously bowed Harry Potter out of contention for this year's Nestles Smarties Book Prize which he had won for three year's running, she left the field wide open. This year's shortlist, drawn up by a panel of adults from which children will choose the gold medal winners, represents the breadth and quality of current children's books. The judges said: \"A first class field of contenders that bodes well for the future of children's books. The final shortlist is varied and offers something for every child to read.\" The shortlist is as follows: </p> <p><strong> 5 Years and under:</strong> </p> <p>A brief collection of simple, if gawky lullabies, <strong> Husherbye </strong> (Cape, \u00a39.99) shows John Burningham's exceptional ability to blur reality and fantasy. It is both reassuring and teasingly provocative, encouraging even very young children to question the world around them. </p> <p>Super-heroes Mum and Dad, fly effortlessly across the big pages in Bob Graham's<strong> Max</strong> (Walker, \u00a39.99), while their son remains firmly grounded. Bold illustrations capture the agonies of a child failing to live up to parental expectations, and the bliss when he is finally airborne. </p> <p>Satoshi Kitamura's delight in the wilder flights of imagination is much in evidence in <strong> Me and My Cat? </strong> (Andersen, \u00a39.99). After a midnight visit from an old lady in pointed hat, it's hard to tell which is Nicholas and which is his cat. Excellent visual jokes juxtapose well with a straightforward text. </p> <p><strong> 6-8 Years:</strong> </p> <p>Award-winning Lauren Child skates effortlessly across visual and textual boundaries to create dazzlingly original <strong> Beware of the Storybook Wolves</strong> (Hodder Children's Books, \u00a39.99). When Herb accidentally lets the wolves out of his story book, he has to work like crazy to keep them happy. Forget safe bedtime stories; books can be dangerous! </p> <p>Tony Mitton's accessible poems tell three separate stories in <strong> The Red and White Spotted Handkerchief</strong> (Scholastic, \u00a39.99). Having nothing to lose Jack, in the title story, sets off with all his belongs tied up in a handkerchief. Kept going by his wits and his kindness, his magical adventures are neatly encapsulated. </p> <p>Lizzie's stubbornness with a new step-family is perfectly captured by Jacqueline Wilson in <strong> Lizzie Zipmouth</strong> (Corgi, \u00a33.99). Lizzie refuses to speak until she finds something that is so important she must break her vow of silence. </p> <p><strong> 9-11 Years:</strong> </p> <p>Snapshots of life in the Middle Ages are made earthily realistic in Kevin Crossley-Holland's <strong> Arthur: The Seeing Stone</strong> (Orion, \u00a310.99). Woven in to the picture is a contemporary Arthur who dreams of Arthurian myths and his possible role in them. </p> <p>Two shots fired from a car change life forever for Sade and Femi in Beverley Naidoo's <strong> The Other Side of Truth</strong> (Puffin, \u00a34.99). For their safety they must flee Nigeria for Britain. This child view of refugees and asylum seekers is a valuable antidote to scaremongering. </p> <p>William Nicholson wittily parodies current preoccupation with testing in <strong> The Wind Singer Mammoth</strong>, (\u00a312.99). Kestrel Hath's quest to discover the evil power controlling the walled city of Aramanth, where exams are everything, is high quality adventure. </p> <p>The prizewinners will be announced on November 29, 2000. </p>",
  "It was confirmed last night that Al Gore could be elected president of the United States in today's election, even though more Americans will vote for George W Bush. <p>Such a result, unprecedented in the universal suffrage era, has only been the stuff of fiction and constitutional nerds until now. But yesterday's Harris Interactive Election 2000 poll shows that it could now become fact, not fiction. </p> <p>According to the poll, Mr Bush leads Mr Gore in the national popular vote by 47% to 46%, with Green candidate Ralph Nader on 4% and the Reform party's Pat Buchanan 1%. </p> <p>But Mr Gore leads Mr Bush in the electoral college, the same poll suggests, with a winning total of 286 votes to 241. Washington state's 11 votes are not allocated because the two candidates are dead level there. </p> <p>Such an outcome would make Mr Gore the next president of the United States, in succession to Bill Clinton. Mr Gore would be the first president since Benjamin Harrison in 1888 to be elected president in spite of receiving fewer votes than his opponent.</p> <p>Such a result has never occurred since women and black Americans got the vote and would be certain to trigger talk of a court challenge by dismayed Republicans if it occurs. </p> <p>Other polls have put the two candidates neck and neck in the popular vote. And other surveys have suggested that Mr Gore could take the presidency in the electoral college even though Mr Bush beats him in the popular vote. </p> <p>But what is special about the Harris Interactive survey is that it combines the two findings in a single huge state-by-state survey of American opinion, with a sufficiently large sample to take the possibility out of the realm of fantasy and place it in the realm of reality. </p> <p>Harris's survey contacted an unprecedentedly large sample of 134,000 likely voters online in 50 states between October 30 and November 4 before weighting their replies by age, sex, education, race, urban or rural home and propensity to be online. </p> <p>Most of the state samples are sufficiently large for their results to be much more statistically reliable than most other polls. The sample in the largest state, California, was 14,632 while that from Alaska was 591. </p> <p>The new poll shows Mr Gore winning in the following closely contested states: California, Florida, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, Hew Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. </p> <p>It puts Mr Bush ahead in Arizona, Georgia, Indiana, Kentucky, Missouri, Ohio, Tennessee and West Virginia. In addition, Washington is tied at 46%-46%.</p> <p>The results are within the margin of error in several cases, but the overall picture is of Mr Gore winning in most of fiercely fought states where the candidates have concentrated their campaign appearances in the final days of the campaign. </p> <p>Mr Nader is clearly cutting into Mr Gore's vote in several states, such as Wisconsin, Oregon, New Mexico, Ohio, West Virginia and California. The survey finds that the Nader effect could tip the balance against Mr Gore in Ohio, West Virginia and Washington. </p> <p>The survey also looks in detail at several of the statewide US senate races. It suggests that two tight races - in Florida and Michigan - are tipping to the Democrats by narrow margins, and two more - Virginia and Washington - to the Republicans. </p> <p>The Missouri race between John Ashcroft (Republican) and the late Mel Carnahan (Democrat) is a tie at present. </p> <p>In other important races, Democrats Jon Corzine and Hillary Clinton lead easily in New Jersey and New York respectively, while Democrat Mark Dayton is on course to oust Republican Rod Grams in Minnesota. However, John Ensign leads comfortably for the Republicans in Nevada.</p> <p><b>Audio</b> <br><a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/news/politics/1102kettle.ra\">Martin Kettle: 'Lots of American flags being flown'</a></p> <p><b>Related stories</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/US_election_race/Story/0,2763,393867,00.html\">7 November 2000: Gore closes the gap</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/US_election_race/Story/0,2763,393869,00.html\">7 November 2000: The fight for the ear of the voter</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/US_election_race/Story/0,2763,393856,00.html\">7 November 2000: Jonathan Freedland says goodbye to Bill Clinton</a></p> <p><b>Useful links</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.harrisinteractive.com/\" target=\"_new\">Harris Interactive</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.AlGore2000.com/\" target=\"_new\">Al Gore's website</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.georgewbush.com/\" target=\"_new\">George W Bush's website</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.votenader.com/\" target=\"_new\">Ralph Nader's website</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.buchananreform.com/\" target=\"_new\">Pat Buchanan's website</a></p>",
  "Israel launched a diplomatic offensive yesterday to squash a Palestinian plea for a United Nations protection force in the West Bank and Gaza. <p>The UN security council is to consider the demand in a closed session tomorrow, a day before the Palestinian leader, Yasser Arafat, meets President Clinton in Washington. The Israeli prime minister, Ehud Barak, will travel to the US on Sunday. </p> <p>Meanwhile the UN said that Israeli helicopters had flown into south Lebanon, a sign of deepening tensions in the region six months after Israeli troops were withdrawn. </p> <p>The Lebanese president, Emile Lahoud, said in a statement that two helicopters had landed near a village. He regarded it as \"an act of war\". </p> <p>President Clinton is hoping to use his separate meetings with Mr Barak and Mr Arafat to stabilise the fragile ceasefire achieved last week in an extraordinary return to the frontline of Israeli diplomacy by the elder statesman Shimon Peres. </p> <p>However, the Palestinians are resisting Mr Clinton's efforts to corral Mr Arafat in the negotiating framework whose collapse has led to 180 deaths and thousands hurt during more than five weeks of violence. </p> <p>Yesterday a Palestinian teenager was shot dead by Israeli soldiers in the West Bank city of Tulkarm. Another man died under Israeli gunfire at a flashpoint in Gaza, where a teenager was blinded in both eyes after being shot in the head, doctors in Gaza City said. </p> <p>With Palestinian casualties continuing to rise, Mr Arafat is renewing his demand for a 2,000-strong observer force in the West Bank and Gaza, which would be the first step in breaking Washington's monopoly on Middle East peacemaking. </p> <p>There has been a small unarmed force of 120 international observers in the West Bank city of Hebron for six years, since the 1994 massacre of more than two dozen Palestinians by a Jewish settler. </p> <p>\"I am asking for quick international forces to protect us, to stop this war, the massacres against our people,\" Mr Arafat told CBS television on Sunday night. </p> <p>\"I am asking the American people, I am asking the whole international community to save the peace process.\" </p> <p>That demand was amplified yesterday by Mr Arafat's aides, who said he would discuss an international force in his talks with President Clinton. </p> <p>\"We are in need of more than guarantees. We need to have an international force to replace Israeli occupation troops,\" one of Mr Arafat's spokesmen, Nabil Abu Rudeinah, said. </p> <p>The push for an international observer force is part of a greater Palestinian effort to secure UN and European involvement in the peace process. </p> <p>\"The rules of management for all previous negotiations are no longer valid,\" the speaker of the Palesinian parliament, Ahmed Qureia, said. </p> <p>\"There should be a new way for negotiations. There should be other international powers besides the US. I think the European Union, Russia, China and the United Nations should be involved to help the partners reach an agreement.\" </p> <p>Palestinian analysts argue that the seeds of the present crisis were sown at the Camp David summit in July, and during seven years of negotiations in which Israel failed to honour commitments to withdraw from territory in the West Bank and release Palestinian prisoners. </p> <p>The visit of the hawkish Likud party leader Ariel Sharon to Jerusalem's holiest Muslim site on September 28 merely served to ignite long-smouldering frustrations. </p> <p>\"I think the intifada started at Camp David in a way, because the intifada is a specific expression of the basic crisis and confrontation in the peace process,\" said Ghassan Khatib, a Palestinian political analyst. </p> <p>But the very prospect of international involvement in its conflict with the Palestinians - let alone a 2,000-strong observer force - is anathema to Israel. </p> <p>\"Any international presence will become a reward for Palestinian violence,\" Mr Barak said yesterday. </p> <p>US diplomats said the Israeli opposition to the idea articulated by Mr Barak, Shimon Peres, and the foreign minister, Shlomo Ben-Ami made it a non-starter for Washington. </p> <p>\"I think it is important to stop this, because if there is more than one mediator we will discover that we are mediating each other rather than mediating the conflict,\" Mr Peres told the Guardian. </p> <p>Mr Peres was in France to seek its intervention in securing the release of three Israeli soldiers and a businessman held by Hizbullah guerrillas in Lebanon. But he was also engaged in damping down French and other European support for an observer force. Last week the Russian foreign minister, Igor Ivanov backed the idea. </p> <p>Israel is adamant that the only means of ending the violence is a return to US-led diplomacy. </p> <p>\"I would give this week's meetings a fair chance,\" Mr Peres said. \"I do not think it is a lost cause. Otherwise, we will have to pass through a corridor of many difficulties and dangers.\" </p> <p>Tension was rising on Israel's northern border after the UN confirmed that Israeli helicopters had flown several forays over a swath of south Lebanon controlled by Hizbullah guerrillas overnight. The spokesman for UN forces in Lebanon, Timur Goksel, could not verify Lebanese government accusations that two Israeli helicopter gunships landed at dawn at Qantara village, near the Litani river. </p> <p>\"There were a lot of overflights in the area last night. Landing I can not verify,\" he said. \"The helicopter activity was out of pattern. There have been occasional stray overs, but this time it was a deep infiltration, 15 or 20km. It was not just a straying over the border.\" </p> <p>In the past month Israeli jets have regularly entered Lebanese airspace, especially since the recent Hizbullah kidnapping of three of its soldiers. Yesterday's incident was the most serious violation so far. </p> <p> <b>Useful links</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.secretary.state.gov/index.html\" target=\"_new\">Madeleine Albright's office</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.p-p-o.com\" target=\"_new\">Yasser Arafat's office</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.pmo.gov.il/english\">Ehud Barak's office</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.index.gov.il/eng\" target=\"_new\">Israeli government</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.moledet.org.il/moleng.htm\" target=\"_new\">Moledet - Land of Israel Loyalty Party (Torah-based religious party) <br></a><a href=\"http://www.iris.org.il/\" target=\"_new\">Iris - Information Regarding Israel's Security (promoting Israeli security)</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.geocities.com/CapitolHill/3188/\" target=\"_new\">Zo Artzeinu (Israeli settlers' group)</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.virtual.co.il/orgs/orgs/ichud/irindex.htm\" target=\"_new\">Organisation of Rabbis for the People of Israel</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.pna.org\" target=\"_new\">Palestinian National Authority</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.presidency.gov.eg\" target=\"_new\">Egyptian presidency</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.palestine-info.net/hamas/index.htm\" target=\"_new\">Hamas</a></p>",
  "<p>A few years ago, I was working with Paula Yates on the publicity for her novel, and had booked her on a chat show in Dublin. Afterwards, we went clubbing with the other guests, Lennox Lewis and fashion designer John Rocha. While Lewis's entourage cruised the club in search of women, he and Paula sat on a sofa having a natter. After an hour, she headed back to the hotel to be with her kids. \"Lennox is very sweet but I think he's a bit inexperienced with women,\" she told me the next day. That really summed Paula up. She wanted to be fantastically glamorous, but what she really loved was an intimate chat before heading to bed with a cup of cocoa. </p> <p>When Princess Diana met Paula before Michael Hutchence died, she thanked the presenter for sharing the duty of keeping the tabloids sated. For the most photographed woman in the world, who could spark a debate on cellulite from a car-seat imprint on her thigh, the presence of another blonde who gave good headline was a welcome respite. And, of course, Paula's public response to any tabloid abuse was newsworthy in itself: she would strut through Heathrow wearing a skimpy \"Little Miss Naughty\" T-shirt. </p> <p>The Diana anecdote, told by Michael Hutchence's brother Rhett, appears in The Real Paula Yates, tonight's Channel 4 documentary, which has been hastily - but tastefully - put together in the wake of her death. Channel 4 was, in many ways, Paula's natural home, from her Pretty in Punk days at The Tube to her bedroom antics on The Big Breakfast. Clips of her interviewing Hutchence on both shows, several years apart, sizzle with sexual tension. </p> <p>The programme covers a lot of familiar ground: her isolated childhood; the jelly and ice-cream party she wanted her own family life to be; the career that paved the way for female presenters; and her comet-blaze of passion for Hutchence, the Heathcliffe to her Cathy. It has an impressive roster of contributors who genuinely knew her sharing their insights and memories, including her friend Brenda Brewin's summation that Paula \"wanted to be somewhere between Marilyn Monroe and Mary Poppins\". </p> <p>Among the TV clips is the first edition of The Tube, when Paula, sprightly in a fairy ball-gown of candy-pink tulle, cheerfully confesses that her stomach will be growing week by week. The Tube's producers had wanted a wild child presenter for their anarchic new show; instead they got one with child. And this was a decade and a half before the Pregnant Spices and Zo\u00eb Ball could Carry On Up The Duff without raising the collective public's eyebrow. </p> <p>I was glad to find something to smile about in many of the clips and anecdotes, because the Paula Yates I worked with was fun. She would dash out of her stint at The Big Breakfast looking like a Barbie punk princess in a lacy designer dress with balcony-cleavage that needed more flesh-coloured undergarments than a village hall production of Hair. There is nothing quite like a publicity book tour to bring a celebrity down to earth, but Paula kept her sense of humour throughout, even when her interview on BBC Radio 4's Woman's Hour was preceded by an item on constipation that was as painfully long as the affliction itself. </p> <p>\"Flirting is the very essence of my being\", was Paula's tongue-in-cheek answer for one magazine questionnaire. \"She was great at flirting and keeping it at that,\" Simon Le Bon explains in the documentary. But she also loved a girly giggle with other women. She called me \"the lissom Michelle\" and pinched my bum when I wasn't looking. We discussed make-up, underwear, families, life in general and - once - drugs. She told me she had heard that Hutchence took drugs and didn't I think drug users were unsavoury, all that lying in the gutter and dribbling at the mouth? Then she gave that lupine grin. </p> <p>The literary dinners she attended were the first time she spent nights away from her girls, and she would dive into toyshops to stock up on fairy outfits to take back for them. It was only after she started seeing Hutchence that the drug rumours began. It was a far cry from the home-loving, clean-living Paula of old. </p> <p>The documentary contains some poignant images of Tiger Lily, a \"bonsai Michael\" as Paula described her, clinging to her mother's torso at her father's funeral like a wide-eyed koala cub. I was reminded of Frances Bean after Kurt Cobain's death three years earlier, same eyes, same grip. The all-too-frequent cry nowadays of \"What about the children?\" - the innocent casualties of celebrity crash and burn - is put into context by Chris Hill from Ensign Records. \"If she'd stayed clean when Michael had gone... she would have got on with her life, because the kids meant that much to her... [the drink and the drugs] made the kids secondary.\" It's no excuse, as they say, but it's a reason. </p> <p>Nonetheless, Brenda Brewin gives evidence that Paula was starting to pull herself out of the domino effect of the tragedies that had blighted the final three years of her life. Her last summer was spent in Hastings where she was planning to move into a house by the sea. Paula once told me how much she envied people who had the courage to give everything up for a more peaceful way of life. Perhaps she is walking along that beach now, barefoot, her sparkling evening gown skimming the sands. </p> <p>\u0095 The Real Paula Yates, tonight, 9.30pm, C4</p>",
  "As the European Union prepares to issue a report tomorrow telling Ankara what it must do to pursue its ambition of membership, the Turkish army is setting out its stall for peace after years of brutal suppression of the Kurdish rebellion in the south-east. <p>With an eye on EU membership, it is claiming victory in its war on the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), and pursuing new challenges. </p> <p>In the remote highlands of Tunceli, a former PKK stronghold, the situation appears to have changed dramatically. Only a few dozen rebels remain in the mountains - most PKK members have withdrawn hundreds of miles across the border into northern Iraq. </p> <p>\"This region needs social and economic help,\" General Tuncer Kilinc, commander of the 3rd Army, said. </p> <p>\"The people are fed up with terrorism and now we are all fighting together.\" </p> <p>Severe restrictions on travel in Tunceli and an embargo on the movement of food supplies have been lifted. A state of emergency remains in place, and there is still a huge military presence, but local people hope the violence has come to a permanent end. </p> <p>\"We used to live in the midst of the bullets,\" a village official said. \"But the soldiers have really changed. </p> <p>\"They used to beat us and curse us, but they don't do it any more. It's been banned.\" </p> <p>Instead, the army is making an effort to win hearts and minds by building roads, improving schools and touring villages with mobile health clinics. </p> <p>But the task ahead is huge: unemployment is sky-high and many villages have been forcibly evacuated by the state. </p> <p>The EU has already welcomed the new focus on economic development rather than military might - it has been urging Ankara to take steps in this direction since well before the capture and trial of the PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan last year. </p> <p>But there are some subjects that the army is still unwilling to discuss, including identity, ethnicity, and Kurdishness. These are issues on which the EU is expecting Ankara to make greater progress. </p> <p>\"Ordinary people want peace,\" said Professor Dogu Ergil, an expert on the southeast, \"but they want peace with dignity. That means being acknowledged as Kurds, and respected as Kurds.\" </p> <p>And that simply has not yet happened. To many Turkish soldiers, and indeed many politicians, concessions to those who want Kurdish cultural rights smack of concessions to the PKK. </p> <p>After 15 years of bitter conflict and an estimated 300,00 deaths, senior generals have issued blunt warnings that they will not allow the PKK to gain in the political arena what it failed to win on the battlefield. </p> <p>The army has been busy erecting dozens of statues of modern Turkey's founding father, Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, in Tunceli. The message is not lost on local people. </p> <p>\"We'll have to see how things go,\" a man said as he watched the opening ceremony of a new children's playground built by the military. </p> <p>\"We need jobs, but we need a little bit more as well. Let's see what they have in mind\". </p> <p>There are still reminders of the bad old days in the southeast. In a province adjoining the Iraqi border, 12 PKK fighters were killed in a clash with the army a few days ago. </p> <p>Elsewhere, three civilians returning to their village for the first time in years were shot dead. Officially the PKK was blamed, but it has denied being involved, and many local politicians are convinced that state forces were responsible. There are growing calls for a full inquiry. </p> <p>Even if the war is officially over, the potential for violence has not gone away. </p> <p>The military high command says it is determined to hunt down every PKK member until the rebels turn in their weapons and permanently surrender to the state. </p> <p>Few civilians in the south-east have any intention of taking on the army, but many have yet to be won over by the charm offensive. The army' may have a job on if its goal is to turn out standardised Turks in every town and village.</p>",
  "Hundreds of armed German police tightened border controls and combed forests yesterday in pursuit of a fugitive rapist and suspected murderer on a crime spree since his escape from jail last month. <p>More than 500 police officers, many wearing bullet-proof vests and carrying automatic rifles, searched through fields and forests with bloodhounds near the eastern town of Gross Dubrau. </p> <p>Controls on the nearby border with Poland were also tightened. </p> <p>Frank Schmoekel, who is serving a 14-year term for rape, escaped for the sixth time on October 25 while on leave to visit his mother in the eastern state of Brandenburg. </p> <p>On Friday the police said that he had admitted in a phone call to his psychiatrist that he had killed a 61-year-old man on Thursday and stolen his car. </p> <p>The authorities warned motorists in south-eastern Germany not to stop for hitchhikers. </p> <p>They said that Schmoekel, 38, might use violence to obtain another vehicle. </p> <p>They said he was extremely dangerous and warned parents not to allow their children to travel unaccompanied to school.</p>",
  "<p>Robert Lochrie bristles slightly at the suggestion that the organisation he heads up is a dinosaur. But isn't it a pardonable image? How does the ideal of introducing the workers to the beauties of art, music and literature - all still among its most popular programmes - and teaching them for their own sake, square with whatever is meant by lifelong learning? </p> <p>And what of the nobility of the task of opening the minds of manual labourers to the glories of philosophy and the metaphysical rewards for their teachers of this cross-class intercourse? One of the WEA's earliest and most distinguished tutors, the historian R H Tawney, said that: \"The friendly smiting of weavers, potters, miners and engineers have taught me much about the problems of political and economic science which cannot be learned from books.\" </p> <p>Two out of the three words in the title are mildewed, to say the least. Workers is hardly New Labour, and we've all got to learn to call education \"learning and skills\". But the WEA's general secretary is not having the Jurassic tag: \"It would be a funny old dinosaur that is not only growing each year, but consistently over-achieves the targets given to it by the Further Education Funding Council and is more successful than ever in attracting funds from the National Lotteries Board, the European Union and the Department for International Development.\" </p> <p>Haunted by its illustrious past, however, the WEA, a voluntary movement and charitable organisation, continues to wrestle with the question of precisely what role it should play in today's lifelong learning society. In this age of quantification and targets, can its courses simply be regarded as intrinsically valuable or should they have measurable outcomes? </p> <p>Founded by Albert Mansbridge in 1903, the Association was created as an alliance between labour (working men) and learning (the universities). Its ideological roots are shared with a clutch of 19th-century initiatives, such as the mechanics institutes, the co-operative movement and popular public lectures on science, designed to slake the working classes' thirst for knowledge from which they felt excluded by the class system. </p> <p>The Association to Promote the Higher Education of Working Men, as it was first called, was formed at a conference of representatives of the trade unions, the cooperative movement and the University Extension authorities. Mary Stocks, a historian of the WEA, calculated that in 1945 fourteen members of the government were tutors, former tutors or members of the WEA executive and 56 MPs were active in the WEA either as tutors or students. At that time there were more than 800 local WEA branches. Richard Crossman was a vice-president for three years, Rab Butler for 12 and Hugh Gaitskell for 10. </p> <p>Today the WEA is divided into four organisations - two associations in Wales, one in Northern Ireland and one covering both England and Scotland. Mr Lochrie, general secretary of the English and Scottish WEA which has some 600 local branches, says there is still a very real job to be done. </p> <p>\"A very, very significant proportion of the population does not engage in lifelong learning in a structured way,\" he said. \"Our very particular job is to bring those people in, in partnership with the unions.\" He adds that the association has moved some way from providing learning for its own sake towards evaluating the benefits of its courses. A learning outcomes strategy now helps to measure the extent to which educational goals are being met. </p> <p>The WEA's work consists of three main strands. A general education programme is delivered through local branches and tutors. This involves a wide variety of provision ranging from classes in dowsing in Cornwall and west Devon, Egyptology in Blackburn, creative writing in Bury, philosophy in Cheshire to ICT courses in the east Midlands. </p> <p>The second major area of work is community learning aimed at specific groups of people with particular needs. This can involve working with the blind and others with special needs, helping to deliver return-to-learning programmes, basic skills programmes and English courses for speakers of other languages. </p> <p>In the London district a community-based creative writing project is targeted at the homeless, refugees and asylum seekers. In Yorkshire the WEA is helping economically beleaguered hill farmers find more efficient ways of running their businesses, often using computers. </p> <p>The WEA's final strand of work is its workplace learning programme where students are recruited in the workplace, via the trade unions. Such programmes are flourishing especially in Cheshire, Merseyside, west Lancashire and Scotland. The WEA works alongside unions such as Unison, the General, Municipal, and Boilermakers and others to provide programmes in communication skills, IT and literacy and numeracy initiatives. </p> <p>As a proportion of its total work the WEA's liberal education programme is falling, while work-based and community-based provision is growing. In 1998/9 it ran more than 9,000 courses. These are typically part-time and comprise 10 or 12 weekly classes, lasting two or three hours. The largest programme areas are in art, crafts, music, history, archaeology, philosophy, religion, personal development, literature, languages and communications. There are 5,000 part-time tutors in England and Scotland. </p> <p>Funded by the Further Education Funding Council as if it were a further education college, the WEA receives \u00a312m a year for its vocational and non-vocational work. All its students are part-time and 89% are aged 25 or over. The WEA is supported by hundreds of voluntary members at branch, district and national level. A Further Education Funding Council inspection report, based on an inspection conducted in March last year, praised most of its teaching for being of good quality and some of it for being outstanding. </p> <p>However, it added that provision for students with learning difficulties and/or disabilities was poor. There were also criticisms of the WEA's arrangements for assessing students' learning and of its financial planning and management. Mr Lochrie said: \"What we now do is target individuals and groups in a much more systematic way than ever before. </p> <p>\"Our student numbers are growing, but not within the traditional structures of the association, ie the local branches, or in general liberal education. Most of the work that is bringing in new students is outside the traditional programme - in the workplace and in communities.\" The WEA, he added, takes a very broad view of what lifelong learning is and of the many pathways that people can travel to get back into education and work. </p> <p>\"We ought to be bringing into lifelong learning those people who have not participated, who are educationally disadvantaged and who left school at the earliest possible age,\" he said. </p> <p>The report says that the WEA's knowledgeable and committed voluntary members are one of its major strengths. It also praises the WEA's \"clear mission, values and strategic objectives\" leading to \"successful widening of participation and significant contributions to lifelong learning.\" Ah, perhaps not quite such a dinosaur after all.</p>"
