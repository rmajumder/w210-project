  "<p>Mark Viduka's talent for attracting controversy, so finely honed during his tempestuous stay at Celtic, has resurfaced within two months of moving south of the border after Leeds United admitted their \u00a36m summer signing had temporarily gone AWOL. </p> <p>David O'Leary, the club's manager, disclosed last night that he had no idea either of Viduka's whereabouts or when the Australian forward would be reporting back from international duty at the Olympics. </p> <p>Australia played their final game against Honduras on Tuesday and O'Leary expected Viduka to be back at Elland Road with plenty of time to prepare for today's game against Derby County. Instead, Viduka will be conspicuous only by his absence at Pride Park, having seemingly been unable to get a flight between Tuesday and Thursday. </p> <p>\"It's up to the Australian authorities to say when a player is coming back, but the player has a say in things as well,\" O'Leary said yesterday. \"I will leave it up to you to say whether or not I'm disappointed.\" </p> <p>Leeds will wait for Viduka's explanation before deciding whether disciplinary action is necessary and he is certain to face a stern inquisition from his new employers. </p> <p>O'Leary was put out, to say the very least, that Viduka had chosen to play for country rather than club so soon after arriving at Elland Road in the first place. Australia were eliminated from the Olympics last weekend, having lost against Italy and Nigeria, and O'Leary had hoped Viduka would report back in time to bolster his injury-hit squad for their Champions League game with Milan on Tuesday. </p> <p>Instead, the Australian authorities refused to release the player, stating that they wanted to field a full-strength team for an ultimately meaningless final match against Honduras. </p> <p>While that did not go down well with O'Leary, he accepted it was not Viduka's doing. But the Irishman will want to know why his player did not make more strenuous efforts to return before now. </p> <p>The Socceroos have told Leeds they could not get an early flight and, while that might seem slightly implausible, O'Leary has privately indicated he will not fine Viduka if his story tallies. </p> <p>Ars\u00e8ne Wenger has promised to open talks with Dennis Bergkamp about a new contract after Arsenal's Premiership collision with Manchester United a week on Sunday. But he has made it clear that Highbury's Dutch idol cannot expect any preferential treatment among his quartet of world-class strikers. </p> <p>The Frenchman, who also has Sylvain Wiltord, Thierry Henry and the Nigerian Nwankwo Kanu in his front line, said Bergkamp must earn his place in the side on merit. </p> <p>He insisted: \"If I played him just to keep him happy I might as well be working in a circus. He is one of four great strikers we need to be successful and they all want to play.\" </p> <p>Newcastle have completed the signing of Lomana Lua Lua from Colchester on a five-year contract for \u00a32.25m and Bobby Robson insists that he will have no qualms about throwing the Zaire-born striker in at the deep end if the need arises. </p> <p>\"I won't be afraid to stick him in, there's no problem about that,\" he said. \"We've bought him as a first-team player; because he's only 19, we know it's long-term. I hope he's going to be here for 15 years.\"</p>",
  "<p>As EastEnders fans have discovered, funerals are not cheap. When Ian Beale was handed the bill for Ethel's cremation he complained that he had no idea that the service would be so expensive. </p> <p>His reaction reflects that of most people when it comes to the practicalities of death; there are 650,000 funerals a year in the UK, but, according to NOP research, just one in five people knew the correct cost, and a third underestimate by a quarter the amount needed to cover a funeral director's fees, flowers, hiring a hearse, a coffin or casket and burial or cremation fees. </p> <p>The price has risen dramatically over the past two years, by 25% according to the Homeowners Friendly Society, which markets a plan to help with funeral costs. Much of this is because local authorities have had to overhaul cremation facilities as environmental regulation becomes tighter. </p> <p>The average amount spent is just over \u00a32,000 for a burial and around \u00a31,200 for a cremation, according to Gilmour Research, but with so many variables, this depends on how grand the ceremony is. More than seven in 10 people choose cremation, but you can choose more than just the method of your disposal; cars, flowers and gardens of rememberance may all be bought. A spokesman from the Co-operative Funeral Service, which has more than 500 outlets nationwide, says: \"Funerals can be as simple or elaborate as people want them to be. We would always encourage people to think about their own funeral arrangements in advance as this lifts a significant emotional burden from their families.\" </p> <p>There is a huge range of costs depending on where death occurs. The average burial in London costs \u00a32,646, against \u00a31,741 in the north, or \u00a31,221 in Bristol, and while the average cost of a cremation in the capital is \u00a31,215, that goes down to \u00a3692 in Cardiff. The only areas which have seen a reduction in costs are the north-west and Yorkshire, where cremations are 8% cheaper than two years ago. </p> <p>The Manchester Unity Friendly Society, which publishes an independent survey on the cost of funerals, makes the point that many directors do not respond accurately to telephone enquiries. \"Only one funeral director gave the full price at the beginning when asked the cost of a basic funeral. Most directors did not mention that the \u00a3200-plus crematorium fee was not included in their quote: over the past 10 years we have found that people tend to hide the true costs.\" </p> <p>Its mystery shopping survey revealed that, for instance, for someone who has died in London, the average quote for a burial was \u00a31,131, whereas the actual cost was \u00a31,515, a difference of 34%. But the CFS spokesman says that his organisation always gives the true cost up front and any changes must be agreed upon in writing. It also provides its services free for funerals of children up to age 16, although associated costs will have to be paid. </p> <p>The invoice usually arrives two to three weeks after the ceremony and a \u00a340 discount is generally offered for settlement within 30 days. Most directors will be happy to wait until probate or insurance money comes through provided they are kept fully informed of progress. </p> <p><strong> Low-cost funeral</strong> The most basic funeral in Woolwich, south London, costs \u00a3950 from CFS. The same service costs \u00a3790 in Tredegar, Wales and \u00a3795 in Glasgow. This covers the cost of a wood veneer coffin but does not include what are called \"disbursements\": cremation or burial fees, doctors' fees and obituary notices, which typically add \u00a3400 to the above amount. </p> <p>The cheapest flowers available from the Funeral Shop website are pink and white sprays for \u00a340 or a black and white wreath for \u00a350, including VAT, postage and packing. Some will be eligible for money from the Department of Social Security. The maximum is \u00a3600 plus basic disbursements, and the claimant must be receiving social security payments, not have savings of more than \u00a3500 (or \u00a31,000 if they are over 60), and cannot claim if they have a brother or sister who has sufficient funds. </p> <p><strong> Expensive funeral</strong> The most pricey at the CFS's Woolwich branch costs \u00a32,195. For this the level of service is the same as for the basic funeral, but the coffin is more elaborate and will be made of solid oak or ash. However, the ceremony can be as expensive as you wish. The CFS will occasionally im port the Promethean coffin from the States, which is made of solid brass with gold trimmings and costs \u00a314,000. A horse-drawn hearse will add an additional \u00a3500 to the bill and a six-foot spray is \u00a3200, depending on the area. The most expensive coffin on the Funeral Shop website is the \u00a32,500 Last Supper Casket and a top-of-the-range wreath of red carnations is \u00a3115. Gardens of remembrance can be constructed featuring a bench (\u00a3100), a wooden armchair (\u00a375), a laurel sundial (\u00a360) or a patio set (\u00a3450). </p> <p><strong> Green funeral </strong> You may wish to opt for a more environmentally sound funeral. The Natural Death Centre in London gives advice on woodland burials, where the body is generally placed in a cardboard coffin and a tree is planted rather than a headstone. A burial of this type in Greenhaven, near Rugby, will cost \u00a3570 for the grave, the tree, a biodegradable coffin and collection of the body. The same service at Hinton Park, on the Hampshire-Dorset border, costs \u00a31,075. All of these sites allow you to organise the funeral independently, without the use of a director. This may be done by storing the body at home (the heating will have to be turned off, or dry ice may be used, costing \u00a327.48 from the British Oxygen Company on 020-8985-5544) and a nurse will lay out the body. Rent a transit van or estate car to transport the body and register the death yourself with the registrar of births, deaths and marriages. Doctors' certificates cost around \u00a382 and you can ask a priest or minister to preside over the service, or use of a humanist officiant, who will charge around \u00a385. Coffins start at \u00a345 for a chipboard model including delivery. You may opt to bury the body on your own land, although there are strict regulations governing this. </p> <p><strong> Buying a funeral</strong> Like-for-like funerals can vary by hundreds of pounds, so although it's not the best of times to do so, a ring-round is a good idea. Yellow Pages should list all the local directors. You should try to ensure they are members of the Funeral Ombudsman scheme. </p> <p> Make a list of items you want to be included before contacting a firm. This may include for a cremation: hearse, coffin, director's fees, removal, chapel of rest, family car, cremation fee, minister, casket and a doctor's certificate, and for a burial you would need to add the cost of a grave-digger, headstone and plot, and obviously replace the cremation fee with a burial fee. </p> <p>Make sure that you get an accurate quote. Some funeral directors may imply that doing so shows disrespect for the dead; do not let this put you off. </p> <p>The Office of Fair Trading has a helpful website at <a href=\"http://www.oft.gov.uk/html/funerals\">www.oft.gov.uk/html/funerals</a>; Funeral Shop is at <a href=\"http://www.funeralshop.co.uk\">www.funeralshop.co.uk</a>; for information on do-it-yourself burials log on to the Natural Death site at <a href=\"http://www.naturaldeath.org.uk\">www.naturaldeath.org.uk</a> or contact the charity on 020-8208 2853; the Co-op funeral information is at <a href=\"http://www.coop.co.uk\">www.coop.co.uk</a>; for Muslim and other alternative funerals see <a href=\"http://www.globalideasbank.org\">www.globalideasbank.org</a>.</p> <p><strong>The plans available</strong></p> <p> There are financial plans tailored to saving for a funeral. They are big business in the US, where more than 60% of funerals are funded this way, but in Britain fewer than 2% are paid for in advance. </p> <p>Golden Charter has a variety of plans. These cost from \u00a31,125 for the Standard Way, funded on a monthly basis covering the services of a funeral director, a basic coffin and hearse, to the most expensive Golden Approach, which costs \u00a32,235 and includes a wooden casket, two limousines and a hearse, a chapel of rest and floral tributes. </p> <p>Chosen Heritage offers a basic plan for \u00a31,057 and if the person dies abroad or the funeral is not needed for some reason, relatives will be refunded. More than 120 local funeral directors offer prepayment plans, backed by the Funeral Planning Trust, and the Cooperative Funeral Service offers its own plan. </p> <p>Alternatively, you can take out an insurance-based plan.

  "<p>Picture a 1940s Los Angeles detective checking out why those cars have been parked on Paseo Miramar outside the German guy's villa for so long. You probably think noir. You probably think Philip Marlowe. You probably don't think RB Hood. </p> <p>Yet when it came to working the beat in the city that knows how to keep its secrets, Hood was the man. As the special agent in charge of the FBI division in LA throughout much of the 40s and 50s, he had the job of coordinating everything that could be found out about some of the most celebrated foreign exiles ever to make their way to the United States. </p> <p>In the 40s, his job was to spy on Bertolt Brecht, Erich Maria Remarque, Thomas Mann, his brother Heinrich, and dozens of other celebrated refugees from Hitler's Germany, many of whom had come to Hollywood in search of work. Everything that Hood and his fellow G-men found out about them would eventually find its way to FBI chief J Edgar Hoover in Washington. And now their reports have found their way into Alexander Stephan's extraordinary new book documenting the secret surveillance years. </p> <p>During the 30s, dozens of German artists, writers and musicians - many, but not all Jewish - fled the Third Reich and eventually found their way to the US. Though they were exiles from fascism, they remained objects of official suspicion, especially if they had leftwing politics or associations. When the second world war ended and the cold war began, the official suspicions grew stronger not weaker. The FBI called these exiles \"Communazis\" because they believed that though they were refugees from one form of tyranny, they might also be in league with a second form. </p> <p>The fact that the US government kept files on writers as famous as Brecht and Mann is not a new discovery. But Stephan has used American freedom of information law to unearth more than 10,000 pages of new material which vastly extend what is known about the surveillance operations. Everything from the way the writers lived, their conversations, their friends, their private lives and loves - and even the details of the books they were writing - formed part of the steady stream of information sent back to Hoover. </p> <p>Hood and his team of agents were interested in everything that the German writers were up to. They tapped their phones. They opened their mail. They kept watch on them. And they interviewed the writers themselves, their circles and their casual acquaintances - mostly without the Germans having the faintest idea of how closely they were being monitored. </p> <p>When one of the writers met a Russian, or someone who might have contacts with the Russians, Hood kept a note of it. It was Hood who checked the cars outside Lion Feuchtwanger's villa by the ocean. It was Hood who got to know when Heinrich Mann's wife Nelly was stopped for drunken driving in Beverly Hills. It was Hood's men who broke in to Leonhard Frank's house on a fishing expedition for evidence of communist sympathies. And it was Hood's men who searched the luggage of Brecht's mistress, Ruth Berlau. </p> <p>Why the FBI kept track of the German exiles is easy to explain. \"The communist movement\", raged Hoover, \"stands for the destruction of our American form of government\". More surprising was the thoroughness of the surveillance - a thoroughness which in other circumstances might be described as Germanic. </p> <p>Relatively uncontroversial exiles such as Franz Werfel, the Austrian Jewish playwright who married Gustav Mahler's widow Alma, got the same treatment as overtly political writers such as Brecht, who was identified in FBI files as \"a propagandist of communism and sovietism\". </p> <p>Parking your car in the street near the Communist party offices in Los Angeles would merit an entry in Hood's files, as Johanna Kortner, wife of the exiled actor Fritz Kortner, never discovered when she did it inadvertently one day. Writers such as Heinrich Mann, who wrote almost nothing in his late years in the US, would be assiduously documented with the same thoroughness as Feuchtwanger, who continued to write and publish his novels from California, and whose bids for American citizenship Hoover blocked with repeated and ill-concealed glee. </p> <p>By far the biggest fish in Hood's net, however, was Thomas Mann. The author of Buddenbrooks, Death in Venice and The Magic Mountain was, by a considerable distance, the most famous and eminent German writer of his era, as well as the most celebrated of all the exiles who set tled in the US. As the winner of the Nobel prize for literature and a major public figure, Mann was a hugely influential voice. Any attempts by him to become involved in organisations of which Hoover was suspicious - or attempts by such groups to recruit him - were carefully tracked and recorded by the FBI, as well as by other American security organisations and by the state department. </p> <p>The portion of Mann's career in the US which most alarmed the watchers was an attempt to form a German exile organisation in America, with Mann as its leader and figurehead. In 1943, the office of strategic services (the forerunner of the CIA) tried to frustrate such a move. \"Thomas Mann is extremely important and useful for any group which might be needed later,\" the OSS recorded, and managed to convey their views to the novelist, who duly backed away from the plan. Mann was in a category of his own. He seems to have been too major a figure to be placed under routine surveillance of the kind to which both his brother Heinrich and his son Klaus - as well as Feuchtwanger and Brecht - were subjected. </p> <p>Klaus Mann, the author of Mephisto, was a particularly frequent FBI target. Even his postman was recruited as an informant. Klaus attracted attention partly because of his leftwing politics, but also because of his homosexuality. The files unearthed by Stephan refer to Mann as \"a well-known sexual pervert\" with \"communistic sympathies\". </p> <p>The bureau's files contain some very detailed surveillance. When Klaus Mann stayed in the Bedford Hotel in New York, an informant identified only as \"T3\" reported that a soldier \"with fair complexion and dirty blond hair\" stayed overnight with him regularly. \"Informant advised that the only suitable sleeping place in Mann's room is a single bed\", the files report. \"Informant further advised that quite a number of 'longhairs' go in and out to see Mann.\" </p> <p>The FBI snoopers speculated that Mann may have had a sexual relationship with his sister Erika, one- time wife of WH Auden. \"Confidential informants\" told agents that the two were having an affair, one file reports. Erika Mann was described in the files as having her hair cut \"in a short mannish bob with a part on the right side\" and to be close to a group of political actors who were \"members of the Hebrew race\". </p> <p>In the end, though, Erika Mann turned the tables on her watchers. She became an informant as early as 1940, and for much of the next 15 years cooperated willingly with dozens of inquiries about members of the German exile community, some of whom she too suspected of pro-Nazi connections. </p> <p>It was an approach which landed her in increasing difficulties as the cold war developed. When the two Soviet spies Guy Burgess and Donald MacLean defected to Russia in May 1951, Mann was hauled in by the FBI, who suspected that, with her connections, she might have useful information about Burgess in particular. But she had not even heard of the defections until the FBI agents told her about them. </p> <p>\"Erika Mann seems to have talked with US agencies like the FBI more openly and for a longer period than any other exiled writer,\" Stephan concludes. No such thing can be said of Bertolt Brecht's case, on which Stephan has unearthed more than 400 pages of new documents. \"He is of sufficient importance to international communism that the Bureau should be aware of all his activities and contacts,\" says one document. In another, dated April 1943, special agent Hood sent a memo to Hoover to start internment proceedings against the poet and playwright. In a third, offering a curious tribute, the OSS classifies Brecht as \"a gifted dramatist\" and a \"poet of expressionistic vigour\". \"Subject is a writer of communist and revolutionary poetry and drama,\" Hood reported to Washington. \"Is looked upon by German communists as their poet laureate.\" </p> <p>Hood was as assiduous as ever, sending Hoover English versions, translated by FBI linguists, of one of Brecht's longhand poems. \"The poem specifically refers to a United States steamer which was destroyed by its crew since they were paid too small wages,\" Hood informed Hoover. Brecht's play, Die Massnahme, was also translated inside the bureau for Hood to send to Hoover. \"A self-styled 'educational play' which advocates communist world revolution by violent means,\" Hood reported. </p> <p>Many of the new documents on Brecht show how seriously the FBI took the links between the poet and the so-called Free German exiles in Mexico, many of whom were unable to get into the US, and Moscow. \"It is recommended that the following subjects be placed in the National Censorship Watch List for 90 days,\" petitioned Hood: \"1. [name blacked out], 2. Bertolt Brecht, 1063 26th Street, Santa Monica, California, 3. [name blacked out].\" </p> <p> In 1945, the FBI began tapping Brecht's phone calls and mail. The records show contacts with Hollywood greats such as Charles Laughton, Charlie Chaplin and Billy Wilder - as well as conversations about a friend's plan to store some furniture in Brecht's garage. The contents are often banal, and even merely take the form of a list. \"A letter postmarked February 7 was received by Brecht fromWH Auden, 16 Oberlin Avenue, Swarthmore, Pennsylvania\" is all that one entry tantalisingly contains. Others are poignant. \"Love, I am so glad that you are fighting so courageously,\" Brecht is reported to have written to his lover Ruth Berlau after she had given birth to their child (who soon died). \"Don't think that I do not want to see you when you are ill. You are very beautiful then too.\" </p> <p>Stephan takes a lenient view of the story which he has unearthed. Not one of the exiles \"was murdered, tortured, deported back to Europe and turned over to the Gestapo\", he writes. \"Nor do the files indicate that agency interrogations had a direct negative influence on a writer's career\". The catalogue of sins committed by the FBI and the other agencies was modest, he judges. </p> <p>Nonetheless, Stephan believes the last word should lie with the great American jurist Justice Louis Brandeis, who wrote in 1928: \"The greatest dangers to liberty lurk in insidious encroachment by men of zeal, well meaning but without understanding.\" </p> <p>\u0095 Communazis: FBI Surveillance of German Emigr\u00e9 Writers, is published by Yale University Press in October</p>",
  "The car is king in Los Angeles and public transport in the city is almost an oxymoron. But, this week, a full-scale bus and rail strike in LA has reminded the air-conditioned car-driver that, amazingly enough, some people have to get their way across the city using vehicles called \"buses\" and \"trains\", and have to sit next to strangers. <p>The city enters day seven today of a strike by 4,400 drivers, members of the United Transportation Union. The picket lines are out, sympathetic motorists toot their horns as they drive past strikers and the Los Angeles Times assigned no fewer than 20 reporters to cover its effects. </p> <p>The strike was prompted by the decision of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) to introduce a new system of working which would cut overtime costs.</p> <p>The drivers, who earn between $10 (\u00a37) and $20 an hour depending on how much overtime they do, say that ending the current system would cause them serious financial damage. Talks broke down last Friday, and by Saturday the stoppage had started.</p> <p>In most other cities in the world, a transport strike of this magnitude would cause chaos on the roads as commuters take to their cars.</p> <p>But in LA, most of the commuters took to their cars about 40 years ago so the volume of traffic, according to the Highway patrol, was up a mere 5%.</p> <p>The roots of the problem go back some 50 years, when an unholy alliance of the oil, tyre and automobile industries conspired to buy up land that could have been used for the expansion of a proper public transport system.</p> <p>Although the miscreants were slapped on the wrist with a fine under anti-trust laws, the damage was done and Los Angeles became a city where the definition of a loser was someone without a car. The people most dependant on public transport are the poorest members of the community, the cleaners and gardeners, the waiters and nannies, mainly Latino or black.</p> <p>What is significant is that the most active group representing the interests of these passengers, the Bus Riders' Union, is fully in sympathy with the drivers. They argue that, if the 450,000 stranded passengers were from the white middle class, the MTA would been desperate to settle the dispute and find other ways of funding public transport.</p> <p>So yesterday, parts of LA were reminiscent of crowded cities in central America, where vans cruise the roads with their drivers shouting out their destinations in Spanish and picking up passengers as they go. </p> <p>The big difference, of course, is that here these \"collectivos\" are charging $3 or $4 rather than the few cents they would be asking for in Mexico City.</p> <p>Talks were due to resume in Pasadena. Provided all the negotiators are able to get there.</p>",
  "<p> I went to a film last week. I almost said I went to a movie, but it wasn't a movie. Movies are from Hollywood, they have pretty girls and handsome men, special effects and capitalistic morals. This - Beau Travail, Claire Denis's blood-melting tale of the Foreign Legion in Djibouti - was a film. </p> <p>Of course, it was more interesting, more intelligent, stranger and longer-lasting in the mind (in short, better) than 99% of Hollywood movies. That goes without saying. But what haunts me about it is nothing auteurish or filmic: it is the handsome men. The male faces. In fact, one face. One really ugly face. </p> <p>You know this face, if you've been to the cinema in the past couple of years. It is the bloke in the beer ad: his father is dying, he brings him a flagon of this very expensive beer on the back of a wagon, drinks it and blames the priest. His name is Denis Lavant. In the ad he is an effective clown, with a monkey mug. In Beau Travail, he is the image of humanity. His face is the story. He is fabulous. And he is so ugly. </p> <p>The other legionnaires are, without exception, beautiful, and their beauty is lingered on, against bleak deserts and burning skies, and very nice that is, too. But his is the face that came back with me. I dreamed about him. If I were 15 I'd put a picture of him on my bedroom wall. I might anyway. </p> <p>Casting an eye over the Hollywood boys of the day - Matt Damon, Ben Affleck, Antonio Banderas - I can't actually remember what they look like. Except that they all look like they're wearing foundation and false teeth. Which they probably are. And then Lavant springs to mind, or Daniel Auteuil as the utterly phallic knife-thrower in La Fille sur le Pont, or the mad, dying king in La Reine Margot, all pock-marked, with hollow cheeks and snaggle teeth. And I think: now we're talking. Why? </p> <p>When I was a girl we had a concept we called sexy acne: ex-acne, combined with a certain strength of character. I suspect now that this was sexy because it suggested that its owner had a knowledge of suffering, and would therefore be wise. Clear skin suggests a worry-free existence and long nights of uninterrupted sleep. Nice now, but not interesting when you're young. An ugly man carries suffering and experience in his face; a pretty man knows only admiration. The nearest a girl can get to being ugly meanwhile is being incredibly beautiful but tastefully ravaged, like Marianne Faithfull, or all bone structure, like Barbra Streisand. Even so, Starville can only handle one at a time of them, and you don't ever get lady stars with no cheekbones at all and bad skin. </p> <p>Now, in Hollywood, it seems to me the men are being prettified to the same degree that women have been. Even Richard E Grant has started to look like an airbrushed sitcom person not, as he rightfully should, the devil incarnate. Russell Crowe is as far as ugliness for men goes over there, and Crowe counting as ugly just proves that, according to Hollywood, we should all have major plastic surgery. In fact, we might as well just have our throats cut. </p> <p> So in the US, Lyle Lovett - truly the most attractive Texan ever, and yes he does look like a parsnip - is mocked and tormented for marrying beautiful Julia Roberts. George Clooney - who is clearly moisturised to within an inch of his life - counts as butch. G\u00e9rard Depardieu in his Hollywood films looks as if he has been castrated. Across the real world men are spending more and more on products with which to feminise themselves, and in bars across the land you find bland boy-band lookalikes from 16 to 60. Everybody, actors included, wants to be Friends. No wonder film director Roman Polanski is having to have open auditions to find a man who looks like a vulnerable, damaged refugee. </p> <p>Meanwhile, Lavant, Auteuil and Lovett show us faces which remind us that beauty is wild, strange, weird, interesting and sometimes very ugly. </p> <p>Faces that just look like human beings. Like themselves. Like men. Like people you want to watch, want to talk to. Their ugliness evokes both reality and imagination: two things so lacking in US culture. </p> <p>Oh, and the other really good thing about ugly men is they don't look prettier than you when you go out together.</p> <p>\u0095 Shane Watson is away.</p>",
  "Louis Hagen, who has died aged 84, was a teenage German Jewish refugee, a British army glider pilot at Arnhem, a journalist, writer and children's film producer. He had a spectacular life. <p>Born in Potsdam, near Berlin, he and his four siblings grew up in a Bauhaus-style villa built by their father, a banker with bohemian leanings. Louis was always known as \"B\u00fcdi\", a diminutive of br\u00fcderlein , or little brother. His blissful childhood was shattered in 1934 when, aged 15, he was thrown into Schloss Lichtenburg concentration camp. A housemaid had denounced him to her Nazi boyfriend after finding a postcard he had sent his sister with an anti-Nazi joke on it. </p> <p>In the camp, B\u00fcdi was beaten, starved and forced into hard labour. The guards would strip him naked and force him to crawl, saying, \"Cry for your Jewish mamma.\" He witnessed the murder of fellow prisoners. But the father of one of B\u00fcdi's school-friends, a high-ranking Nazi judge, rescued him after four months. He left immediately for England, joining his youngest sister. The other three siblings went to the United States. Their parents escaped in 1941, via the trans-Siberian railway to Japan and thence to America. </p> <p>In prewar England, B\u00fcdi got a job at a steelworks near Oxford. Always humanitarian and left-liberal in his views, his friends included Aneurin Bevan and Jennie Lee, and the future Nobel laureate, biologist Peter Medawar, and his wife Jean, who helped him to learn English. </p> <p>When war broke out, B\u00fcdi joined the Pioneer Regiment, and, renamed \"Lewis Haig\", became a glider pilot. In September 1944, as part of the doomed allied operation to leapfrog the German frontline, his regiment landed its gliders at Arnhem, in Holland. He got back to Britain and was awarded the military medal by George VI. B\u00fcdi was mesmerised by the king's stammer, and remembered the then Queen Elizabeth staring at him, amazed, he felt, to discover a German in her palace. </p> <p>Brave and diligent, B\u00fcdi was also a great hedonist, and found that the temptations of love conflicted with the urge to write. But with the help of his friend, Dido Milroy, he wrote Arnhem Lift (1945), which became a bestseller and was translated into nine languages - though not before his army superiors, he recalled in his unpublished autobiography, outraged by its honesty, banned publication. </p> <p>Undaunted, Milroy sent the book to a friend, a War Office censor, who allowed it to be published anonymously. Arnhem Lift formed the basis for Brian Desmond Hurst's film Theirs Is The Glory (1946), which re-enacted the battle with some of the participants. </p> <p>In early 1945 the army transferred B\u00fcdi to a glider squadron in India. He was devastated; he wanted to be in Europe for the Nazi defeat. But B\u00fcdi lived a charmed life, with a limitless capacity to make the best of everything and enchant people wherever he went. He chanced upon a job as a journalist for the Allied South-East Asia Command's newspaper. Armed with a camera he had no idea how to use, he followed his curiosity, filing reports ranging from the life and times of a Calcutta brothel to colonial racism. His book Indian Route March (1946), followed. He reported from Burma, and had adventures in Bangkok. In Vietnam, he was apparently the first western journalist to interview its communist leader Ho Chi Minh. </p> <p>Back in Europe after the war, B\u00fcdi returned to a Berlin in rubble, its citizens scrabbling amidst the ruins. He wrote Follow My Leader, which comprised intriguing biographies of nine Germans, most of whom collaborated with the Nazi regime. This was followed by The Secret War For Europe (1969), an account of Germany's role in international espionage. </p> <p>In 1950, he settled in north London with his Norwegian wife Anne Mie, a painter. He set up a film company, Primrose Film Productions, and produced 25 children's films with Lotte Reiniger, his childhood art teacher and doyenne of animated film. Thanks to B\u00fcdi, her films, which date back to the 1920s, are still internationally shown. </p> <p>Despite torture, exile and loss, B\u00fcdi was without bitterness. His lust for life was undimmed to the last. Two days before he died, he faxed his doctor requesting her to renew his Viagra prescription. The following night, at a birthday party for his daughter, he said he had had a marvellous life. Death, he added, held no fear for him. </p> <p>He leaves his wife Anne Mie, daughters Siri and Caroline, and two grandchildren, Lara and Louis. </p> <p>\u0095 Louis 'B\u00fcdi' Hagen, writer and producer, born May 30 1916; died August 17 2000</p>",
  "Dissident Irish republicans were yesterday being blamed for a rocket launcher attack on the London headquarters of the foreign intelligence service, MI6. <p>Police are hunting for an active service unit of the Real IRA, who are opposed to the Northern Ireland peace process and were responsible for the August 1998 bomb in Omagh that killed 29 people. </p> <p>The group is believed to have been behind this summer's bomb on Hammersmith Bridge and a device that failed to explode near a railway line in Ealing, west London. But the latest attack on one of the country's most secure buildings represents an escalation in the campaign and has led to security being stepped up for next week's Labour party conference in Brighton. </p> <p>The missile was fired - without any warning - at 9.45pm on Wednesday, slightly damaging a window and two glass screens on the eighth floor of the distinctive cream and green security service building at Vauxhall Cross, south London. </p> <p>Metropolitan police Deputy Assistant Commissioner Alan Fry described the explosion as \"an audacious attack in one of the busiest parts of London\". </p> <p>Last night Scotland Yard said part of a rocket propelled grenade launcher was found near the MI6 building in Spring Gardens following a painstaking search of the area by police and forensic experts. A police spokeswoman said it was not known if the launcher had been fired from the spot where it was found. \"The launcher is now being examined by experts. This will enable us to determine precisely what type of launcher it is.\" </p> <p>She added that the Met officers would continue to carry out \"extensive searches\" in the area and forensic work would continue. </p> <p>Streets within a 500 metre radius of MI6 headquarters were cordoned off and the train lines closed, bringing chaos to rush hour traffic and commuters yesterday morning. Police only began removing the cordon around the MI6 building at 5pm last night. </p> <p>Mr Fry, the head of Scotland Yard's anti-terrorist squad, said the device was believed to have been fired at the building from a range of between 200 to 500 metres. \"The sort of weapon that we believe to have been used in this attack is known to be in the hands of certain groups. Clearly they will be uppermost in our minds,\" he said. </p> <p>\"Certainly there have been finds both in the south and north of Ireland and similar devices may have been used here. But clearly these devices are readily available in Yugoslavia, Russia and other previous Eastern bloc countries.\" </p> <p>But he stressed he was keeping an open mind about who was behind the attack. \"Clearly we have to keep in mind the capabilities of dissident Irish groups, but at this stage we will not be ruling out any group who might see the secret intelligence service as a target.\" </p> <p>However, the Real IRA are known to have acquired Soviet designed rocket launchers from the former Yugoslavia. Last year Scotland Yard sources said the rebel republican terrorists were establishing new arms supply routes through the Balkans in preparation for a renewed campaign in Britain and Ireland. </p> <p>Yesterday the foreign secretary, Robin Cook, who has responsibility for MI6, said: \"I have spoken to the chief of SIS, Richard Dearlove. He has confirmed there was no damage inside the Vauxhall Cross building. </p> <p>\"I asked him to commend SIS staff for maintaining business as usual. If the intention of the attackers was to disrupt SIS's operations, they have failed in their objective.\" </p> <p>The prospect of an active terrorist group at large on the mainland, apparently equipped with at least one rocket launcher, prompted an upgrading of security at other security-sensitive buildings. \"London will be policed according to the current threat,\" a spokeswoman said. \"This will include high-visibility policing and appropriate security measures. We would ask the public to remain vigilant and contact police if they notice anything suspicious.\" </p> <p>Although the Real IRA called a ceasefire in the aftermath of the Omagh tragedy, it is now known to be active again and security services in Northern Ireland are on full alert against further attacks. </p> <p>Earlier this month the group was suspected of a mortar attack on the Royal Ulster Constabulary station at Armagh, and also fell under suspicion the previous day when two 80lb bombs were found at a military training camp at Magilligan, County Londonderry. </p> <p>The Real IRA is the largest in a coalition of dissidents, which, security sources estimate, numbers 120 people. But it is unclear how many are either active or potential terrorists. </p> <p>Security sources on both sides of the Irish border spend little time drawing distinctions between the Real IRA, now three years old, Continuity IRA, dating from the Sinn Fein split of 1986, and dissident elements in the Irish National Liberation Army. They believe they switch flags of convenience as it suits. </p> <p>The security forces are also in no doubt that numbers of dissident republicans are growing and their confidence is increasing as well. </p> <p>Attacks such as the one on the MI6 building, although insignificant in the damage it caused, are crucial to the renegade groups as they send a powerful message to terrorists wavering between the political route to a united Ireland or a return to violence that there is an alternative to the Good Friday agreement and that they have the ability to keep the war going. </p> <p>The impetus to dissident republicanism came when the IRA's quartermaster quit the IRA with his partner and a dozen others in the autumn of 1997. </p> <p>They were opposed to Sinn Fein's entry to the talks, and rejected the Good Friday agreement which followed in April 1998. </p> <p>Earlier this week, it was reported that the former IRA leader had disappeared from his normal haunts in the Republic, and may have moved to the British mainland to direct operations. <br><br><b>Quickfire weapon anybody can use</b><br><br> When the gardai raided a wine cellar in a derelict country house 25 miles north of Dublin last October, they realised that the Real IRA had acquired some serious weaponry. </p> <p>The underground bunker was a military training camp and after arresting 10 men, including a 14-year-old, follow-up searches led them to a hay barn. </p> <p>Hidden in pipes beneath the bales was a Russian anti-tank weapon capable of piercing up to 375mm of armour. </p> <p>Though the Provisionals were known to have acquired a number of similar rocket grenade launchers, known as the RPG7, from Libya in the 1980s, this find was different. It was an updated version, the RPG18, manufactured in 1990 and the first weapon of its kind found in the Irish republic. </p> <p>Irish and British intelligence agencies, including MI6, which had been monitoring the travels of two Real IRA members, including its alleged leader, Michael McKevitt from Dundalk, believed they knew where it came from. The new source of weapons was Croatia in the former Yugoslavia, although some reports have suggested that they originated in the first instance in either Serbia or the Kosovo Liberation Army. </p> <p>Further confirmation came in March when a similar weapon, ready for use, was found abandoned near the Killymeal barracks at Dungannon in Co Tyrone, the base of the 3rd battalion the Parachute Regiment. </p> <p>Then, in July, Croatian police raided a number of houses and warehouses in the town of Dobranje near the border with Bosnia and seized an arsenal which they believed were destined for Ireland. </p> <p>The haul included 10 RPG18s. </p> <p>Favoured by terrorists, rebels and irregular forces around the world, the RPGs are relatively cheap and easy to aquire and operate. The RPG18, called the Mukha in Russian, was introduced in the 1970s as a disposable, single-shot anti-tank weapon. It comprises a glass fibre tube with a 64mm rocket and a range of 200m. </p> <p>The high velocity rocket can be launched in seconds. After extending the collapsed tube, the operator places it on his shoulder, lines up the target through a pop-up sight, engages the firing mechanism and pulls the trigger. </p> <p>Writing in a Russian army magazine about \"the fly that flies through armour\" a weapons expert said: \"It could be used by any soldier, even a cook or clerk.\"</p>",
  "Edited extracts from Charles Kennedy's speech in Bournemouth yesterday: <p>Potentially, politics is at a crossroads. We saw that last week. The opinion polls have recorded that this week. That's been the backdrop for this, I think, one of our most successful conferences ever. Politics is about leading. But politics is also about listening. The events of the past 10 days, have demonstrated, graphically, that the current government, neither leads nor listens enough. </p> <p>People want a better level of political dialogue. Just look at the crime debate. Ann Widdecombe and Jack Straw. They're competing in a dismal Dutch auction. Going for lowest common denominator politics. Over-claim. Over-blame. Over-reach. Undermine the entire point of the political process along the way. </p> <p>Let me be quite clear. I'm not one of those who believe that all Britain's problems began on the first of May 1997. But Labour's poverty of ambition is quite remarkable. With a parliamentary majority - of 179, they behave like John Major did - with a majority of three. </p> <p><b> Ethical</b><br> </p> <p> It's all about what will play well in the opinion polls. Britain was promised an ethical foreign policy. Britain demands legislation on the arms trade. But instead we get arms sales to Indonesia. </p> <p>And all too often, they seem scared of their own shadows. Remember that leaked prime ministerial memo? What was it he said? \"A sense that the government ... are somehow out of touch with gut British instincts\". </p> <p>So I ask you, Labour voter last time, maybe for the first time was it? Did you believe, that things could only get better? And have they? Millions of people believed it. Millions of people are disappointed. </p> <p>The Conservatives won't improve these things for you. But the Liberal Democrats can. We can improve a lot on Labour. They are continually terrified to be called the party of boom and bust. That old Labour habit of splashing out in their first years in power, and then having to cut back at the end. Gordon Brown certainly hasn't done that. He's cut back and now he's splashing out. Bust followed by pre-election boom. We said that wasn't good enough. I'd like to think he saw the light. But the truth is, he felt the heat. </p> <p>Now what of the Conservative party? Today, I want to address the millions of previous Conservative voters, who feel that William Hague's party offers them - nothing. I share many of the values, the beliefs, the concerns, of the people who used to be called One Nation Conservatives. Tolerance, decency, fair play. </p> <p>If you believe in those things, and you look at your party. And it's not got room any more, at the top table, for the likes of Ken Clarke, Michael Heseltine, Chris Patten. Then your party's got no room for you. </p> <p>To you, I say this. You have friends in the Liberal Democrats. Come and talk to us. You will be very, very welcome. What's gone wrong with the Conservative party - oh, so wrong - is not even so much the individuals, it's the issues and the instincts which today guide William Hague's Conservative party. </p> <p>William jumps in with both feet, in the wrong place, at the wrong time, and for the wrong reasons. Desperate for a headline, desperate for a quote. Desperate to get attention. He's the world's first unpopular populist. </p> <p>So how come the Tories have come up in the polls? I know the answer. It's not William's popularity. It's the people round about him that the country's warming to. It must be John Redwood, Michael Portillo and Ann Widdecombe the country loves. </p> <p>Just look at what William's been up to this year. January -patient's guarantee. Ditched. February - tax guarantee. Ditched. March - the moral case for low taxation. Ditched with the tax guarantee. April - bogus asylum seekers. May - Romsey. June. He was quiet in June. Perhaps he had a 14-pint hangover. Or perhaps it was that Romsey hangover. </p> <p><b> Record</b><br> </p> <p> Remember their record? Recessions. Crime doubled. Larger class sizes. Fewer nurses. Pensions slashed. Interest rates - through the roof. Arms to Iraq. BSE. Cash for questions. Sleaze. It must never, ever, be allowed to happen again. </p> <p>William Hague is not the serious leader of a serious political party. That's the serious point. We are serious. Our pur pose is here in this document. It's the F word. Freedom. That's why we're in politics. We want politicians to promote freedom for all. So people can make the most of their lives. I am determined we will get our message across. </p> <p>But as part of that, it is vital, absolutely vital, that we persuade people, that for every area where government can do more, there's an area where government should be doing less, or doing different. </p> <p>We would scrap a range of regulations, that burden small businesses. We will cut bureaucracy in schools. </p> <p>Tax and spend? Every party taxes and spends. But our priorities, are the people's priorities. That's what freedom means. It's not left of Labour. It's not right of Labour. It's ahead of Labour. </p> <p>It's also honest. Where there is a cost, we say how we will pay for it. Saying that if necessary, we will pay for better schools, by asking everybody to pay just 1p more on the basic rate of income tax. And to fund decent pensions, we will ask those fortunate enough to earn over \u00a3100,000 per year, to pay a little more. </p> <p>On health: Nurses and doctors - more of them. Prescription charges - abolish them. Eye and dental check-ups - free once again. Schools and colleges, cut class sizes for all 5 to 11 year olds. Abolish tuition fees for higher education. </p> <p>And what about the pensioners? Forgotten and insulted by Gordon Brown. So we will give pensioners more, above inflation. \u00a35 extra every week for every pensioner, If you're over 75, it's going to be \u00a310 extra. If you're over 80, it's going to be \u00a315 extra. Now that will make a real difference. </p> <p>We say that a clean environ ment relates to health. To poverty. To transport. To education. To civil liberties. We understand that, instinctively so. And again, we're honest. We're clear, fuel taxes should be used, to improve the environment. In the months and years to come, we have got to get that message across. Positive gain, not pain. </p> <p><b> Single currency</b><br> </p> <p> And let me say something about the single currency. As pro-Europeans we are not in favour, of rushing into the euro head first. </p> <p>We don't believe Europe is perfect. And we will work to see that reform takes place. But we do believe that Britain can and must lead in Europe. Lead reform in Europe. </p> <p>That's why, earlier this year, I asked a panel of experts, to report on what the government should be doing. And if the government chooses to ignore the experts, British businesses will lose, British workers will lose, British consumers will lose. So those of us in favour of the euro, must go out there and argue the case. We cannot sit on our hands. </p> <p>This has been an outstanding year for the Liberal Democrats. The local elections - our biggest ever share of the national vote. Sandra's triumph in Romsey. At the next election, I believe we will win more votes, and more seats. 1997 was a staging post. It wasn't a high water mark. </p> <p>So we must go into the next election, and tell people about our message of freedom. The difference between the Liberal Democrats and the disaster of William Hague's Party. The difference between the Liberal Democrats and the disappointment that Labour has become. Go out there and tell it to people as it is. What you see is what you get. This is what we will deliver. A truly modern, truly free, 21st century Britain. A Liberal Democrat Britain.</p>",
  "<p>It is known, in market circles, as the \"slow punch\" - that is, a sharp fall in prices which happens over a number of days or even weeks rather than on one headline generating day. Market participants tend to find themselves taken unawares, suddenly panicking when they realise that what they are watching amounts to a wholesale re-rating of the economic outlook. </p> <p>Yesterday's 80-point fall on the FTSE 100 to 6,199.2 took the cumulative loss to almost 600 points since September 4. Reasons to be bearish are stacking up: the long-running saga of the weak euro, the oil price and a host of other nagging reminders that new technology in the new economy has not abolished that old economy thing known as the business cycle. Yes, corporate earnings are still highly vulnerable to the price of basic commodities. </p> <p>On the oil front, the word from Washington yesterday was that Bill Clinton may ride to the rescue by tapping emergency reserves stored in salt caverns along the Gulf of Mexico. </p> <p>In a market fretting about surges of demand during the winter, this helped stabilise the price somewhat yesterday. After hitting a 10-year high of nearly $38 a barrel on Wednesday, oil was nearly a dollar cheaper in early afternoon trading. </p> <p>Calming the wider jitters about economic growth in the west will not happen quickly. </p> <p>Much will depend on the details of President Clinton's plan - specifically, how much extra oil and when? </p> <p>Opec promised 11 days ago to boost production by 800,000 barrels a day - a move that is in theory expected to help lower the price of crude to around $25 a barrel. </p> <p>But the American move might backfire by souring relations with Opec, whose members are due to meet in Caracus next week. </p> <p>Before then, France has called for a special meeting between the oil producers, the European Union and the US to thrash out an agreement to end the crisis before the winter sets in. </p> <p>Yet all the talking might be in vain. The United Nations compensation commission is due to rule on the long-standing claim for $16bn in war reparations from Iraq next week. </p> <p>There is a view that if Saddam is asked to pay too much he will retaliate by turning off his crude tap - which at present is spewing 2.5m barrel per day on to the world oil market. No wonder financial market nerves are a-jangle </p> <p><strong> BoS crescendo </strong><br> </p> <p> A bid for Bank of Scotland has been the talk of Edinburgh's Georgian squares ever since its audacious and hostile but ultimately ill-fated bid for NatWest, almost a year ago. </p> <p>Yesterday, the chatter reached deafening crescendo, with one line of speculation suggesting BoS might even try to mark the anniversary of the start of its last hostile bid with a pre-emptive punt at a rival. Activity on the stock market was especially intense during the last half-hour of business, although there was no firm indication that we might expect an announcement to hit the screens first thing this morning. </p> <p>That aside, both possibilities - hostile action by BoS, or against it - carry some credence. Even though the hostile bid for NatWest failed, it is generally agreed that the management of BoS is as good as it gets in traditional high street banking and, as a result, the institution carries the genuine confidence of its big institutional shareholders. </p> <p>In large part this can be put down to the fact that Peter Burt, its chief executive, has always strived to keep his whole approach to banking resolutely free of charisma and marketing sex appeal. This is the man who talked about \"banking in a box\", and who yesterday appeared to set off all the speculation about corporate action by admitting in one interview that he was on the lookout for acquisitions. </p> <p>Yet he is also a chief executive who has had to come to terms with life in Edinburgh, post-NatWest, where his perennial rivals at Royal Bank of Scotland are now sitting at the helm of one of the country's largest financial institutions. Pride, we can assume, is something of a motivator in all this. </p> <p>But there are also suggestions that Mr Burt and his colleagues have, over recent days, been trying to massage down the City's expectations on the bank's interim figures, due next week. </p> <p>The last set of results, in the immediate aftermath of the NatWest tussle, were certainly lacklustre. </p> <p>The City forgave the management that time, since its focus had been elsewhere. But there will be a natural desire for some hard some evidence next week that the bank has regained some of its previous impetus. </p> <p>All the while, partners for the BoS, either friendly or otherwise, are not difficult to list: Lloyds TSB and HSBC should be right at the top of any speculator's list. </p> <p>Consolidation in this particular sector is by no means over.</p>",
  "Indonesian police have arrested some soldiers in connection with the murders of three workers for the UN refugee agency in West Timor earlier this month, and the preceding killing of a militia leader that sparked the attack on the UN staff. <p>The move suggests Jakarta is at last responding to threats of international isolation if it fails to rein in the militias holding sway in West Timor. </p> <p>Their incursions disrupt and terrorise newly independent East Timor and keep more than 120,000 East Timorese in squalid refugee camps along the border between the two parts of Timor. Some aid agencies also say food for the refugees is running low, though the government denies this. </p> <p>Western diplomats believe that the arrests - announced yesterday by Indonesia's attorney general, Marzuki Darusman - bear out their repeated assertion that not only are elements of the military helping the militias but that the armed forces are fractured, with some key generals not obeying President Abdurrahman Wahid. </p> <p>The three workers for the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) were killed on September 6 in the border town of Atambua, where hundreds of militiamen attacked their office. They were hacked to death and their bodies set on fire. With the security authorities standing by, the mob then ran amok in the town. </p> <p>Yesterday Mr Darusman said six people were being picked up. \"The identification of the suspects has been made and they are in the process of being summoned and interrogated,\" he said. \"They include elements of the military.\" </p> <p>Seven others have been arrested in connection with the death on September 5 of a militia leader, Olivio Maruk. These also include members of the armed forces. </p> <p>Mr Darusman said he did not know how many of the suspects were soldiers or what their ranks were. He said they were rogue elements and that the military as an institution was not party to the murders. </p> <p>The chief military spokesman, Rear Air Marshal Graito Usodo, said people should not jump to conclusions about the arrests of soldiers. </p> <p>Militia leaders said the rampage and the killing of the UN workers was sparked by the murder and castration the previous day of Mr Maruk. </p> <p>Analysts believe he may have been killed because he had been named as a suspect in the investigation into the destruction wreaked in East Timor last year when the territory voted for independence, and might have implicated senior soldiers when questioned. </p> <p>The UN has said it will not send staff back to West Timor to help the refugees until the militias have been disarmed and disbanded. Indonesia's senior security minister, Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, promised the UN security council at the weekend that the militias would be given until Monday to hand in their weapons; then the military would seize them. </p> <p>Marshal Usodo said yesterday that negotiations had begun with gang leaders to hand over weapons but said the process would not be easy as the militias were insisting on compensation for their guns, most of which they obtained from the Indonesian army. </p> <p>The US and the World Bank have both said in the last week that if the militias are not disarmed and disbanded rapidly then Jakarta could find itself isolated and its aid cut off. </p> <p>Conditions for the refugees are deteriorating. Red Cross officials in West Timor said food supplies were critically low. Indonesia's vice-president, Megawati Sukarnoputri, is to visit the refugees this weekend with 100 tonnes of rice. </p> <p>\u0095 Around 1,500 aid workers marched in Geneva on Thursday to demand better protection in dangerous parts of the world. \"We are aid workers, not martyrs,\" Naveed Hussain, head of the staff council at the UNHCR told the rally. </p> <p>The agency said its staff would protest in at least 28 cities after the murder of the three in West Timor and the murder of one and abuction of another in Guinea in less than two weeks.</p>",
  "An advert was run recently in the print Guardian for Solar Century, the UK solar power company devised and presided over by former Greenpeace representative and Oxford fellow Jeremy Leggett. The advert incites us to consider what may happen when supplies of carbon fuel begin to run out, what sort of blockades and panics we will suffer, what sort of squabbles at the pump. Now, the advert suggests, before it is too late, for oil supplies, and for the future of the planet, we should turn to solar alternatives. <p>Solar Century is an unabashedly commercial enterprise. Its website offers a range of solar products, from roof installations of various sizes to portable powermats. The aim of the company is to hurry the conversion to solar power in Britain, for fiscal profit. However, Solar Century also runs a charitable trust, aiming to extend solar power to those less likely to be able to afford the conversion rates, the Solar Century Global Community Trust. </p> <p>What companies such as Solar Century are aiming to demonstrate is the economic viability of solar photovoltaic (PV) power. As usual, Britain is lagging behind countries such as Japan and Germany, where government schemes have propelled rates of conversion. We remain at the level of unconverted barbarism: the Solar Century site aims to correct a few of our more primitive preconceptions. Will it work in the dark? Will it work in the clouds? The answer to both questions is, of course, yes. </p> <p>At the present time, most solar roofs are connected to the national grid. So, in the day when a surplus of electricity is generated, the excess is effectively sold to the local electricity company. At night, the local electricity network supplies the power back. Clouds interfere only slightly with the workings of solar panels. Electricity is created by daylight - cloud cover may diminish the output, but there will still be power. </p> <p>Solar Century orchestrate discussions with the local electricity companies, who are compelled by law to let customers install solar power anyway and to buy surplus electricity created by the panels. Planning permission is rarely required, unless the solar roof has been designed to project wildly beyond the frame of the house. </p> <p>Faced with these sorts of enterprises, it seems absurd that we do not, as a nation, convert instantly. Global warming, caused by carbon emissions throughout the world, but particularly in developed, industrialized countries, is no longer even a debatable probability. Its effects have already been witnessed - freak weather conditions, floods in China, El Nino storms buffeting the Atlantic coast. </p> <p>This summer the northern polar ice cap melted. Scientists respected for their rigour and precision are predicting monstrous, apocalyptic future effects, including a sea level rise of one metre, which will destroy the homes and livelihoods of, for example, 30m people living in Bangladesh, Egypt and Vietnam. </p> <p>The first recommendations from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in 1990 were for a 60% reduction in carbon dioxide emissions, as the basic level required to return the planet's climate to a healthy level. Governments globally have failed to commit to anything even approaching this. </p> <p>Various dubious enterprises have been created to allow further evasion of carbon cuts for richer countries, including the carbon credits scheme, which creates a trade in carbon emission entitlements - a company which emits below its allowed level will be able to sell its surplus allowance to another. </p> <p>This once more means that money will save individuals, companies and nations from significantly altering their lifestyles. It was George Bush senior, as US president in the early days of international climate panels and conferences in the 1980s, who suavely assured the world that the American lifestyle was not negotiable. </p> <p>Now America has seen some of the worst, most destructive storms in its history: Florida devastated, Texas drought-riddled, heatwaves sweeping the midwest and the south, killing the young and the elderly. And now this year and last, an encephalitis epidemic in New York City. </p> <p>In the UK, we are more fortunate. So far, we have evaded some of the more sinister and appalling demonstrations of climate change. But we are inactive, clinging to our petrol and our cars, clinging to the core comforts of life, \"core comforts\" we have known for less than a century. There is one area in which we might act. We might, given that it is so extraordinarily easy, convert our homes to solar power. </p> <p>The use of renewable energies no longer requires individuals to adopt eccentric living patterns, to retire to the Lake District and hammer up a windmill on the top of the fell. Solar power is there for the installing, by competent, mainstream, commercially minded Oxford fellows and their team (which includes figures no less mainstream and commercial than former employees of BP). </p> <p>We scarcely have to do anything. We are not required to leave our homes, we are not required to picket or protest, to storm and rave. We are merely required to adjust our thinking slightly. To adapt.</p> <p><b>Useful links</b><br><a href=\"http://www.solarcentury.com\" target=\"_new\">Solar Century</a></p>",
  "The first petrol-buying panic was bad enough. The second one on Tuesday, this time sparked by rumours of blockades rather than blockades themselves, was lunacy taken to extreme. <p>Along with all the other rips in the fabric of our custom and practice that the fuel crisis produced, Britain's image is in shreds. A culture that prides itself on common sense, moderation and the ability to keep cool in a crisis finds itself racing to the pumps like Gadarene swine at the slightest hint of trouble. People who normally run on half-tanks join the hoarders and fill their cars to the brim. </p> <p>Faced with similar crises the French and Germans proved to be more reasonable than cool Britannia. When refinery blockades hit southern France and parts of the north-east two weeks ago, local petrol stations ran out but those in Paris operated as normal and there was no panic buying. Yet, by any measure other than its effect on releasing a mass psychosis, the French protests were worse than Britain's. </p> <p>The hauliers mounted real blockades, with lorries drawn up across the entrances of refineries and fuel depots, making it physically impossible for tankers to move. Contrast this with Britain's deckchair-men sitting politely on the verges. While the British government declared a phoney \"red alert\" in the national health service to try to turn the public against the protesters, the crisis in France's health system was genuinely grave. Ambulance-drivers had joined the barricades. </p> <p>One reason for France's ability to maintain its sang-froid may be that the authorities are better armed. Acting on advice from central government, the prefect of every d\u00e9partement can requisition petrol stations and order them to serve only public services such as hospitals, school buses, the police and fire brigade. The prefect can also instruct petrol stations to impose rations on private buyers. In Britain, where restraint has to be self-imposed, only a few garage managers had the common sense to do this. Most succumbed to the general selfishness and happily sold to the first comers rather than accepting the extra time and effort involved in rationing. </p> <p>In Germany the picture has also not been flattering for the British. There the fuel-tax protests targeted some refineries but mainly chose to cause chaos in town centres with crawling convoys of lorries and taxis making access impossible. As in France, the effect was localised. While Bremen, Hamburg and Magdeburg came to a standstill, other cities, including Berlin, kept calm. People did not react by panic buying. </p> <p>Beside the new phenomenon of the easily excitable British, the fuel crisis turned other things on their head. Rightwing horror of direct action evaporated while centre-left sneering about Mondeo man was shown up as crude elitism. Old industrial paradigms became hollow, and the voices at the Trades Union Congress that called the crisis a \"bosses' blockade\" sounded absurd. Many protesters were owner-drivers who only possess one lorry. Some are union members. People who denounced the hauliers as rightwing thugs of the kind who smashed through picket lines during the miners' strike should realise that some of today's lorry drivers are ex-miners. </p> <p> British hauliers are luckier than their continental counterparts. They are protected, at least to some extent, by geography. In France and Germany the fuel tax protests are only partly directed against the government. Owner-drivers and small firms are equally angry with the big haulage companies, some of which own up to 4,000 lorries and use underpaid Bulgarian and Polish drivers to trundle up and down the autobahns. In response to this unfair competition, the owner-drivers are forced to cut corners on maintenance or abandon their spare tires so as to carry more freight. No wonder that even the French Communist party, not normally known for flexibility, does not buy the line about a \"bosses' blockade\". It is demanding more concessions on fuel tax than its socialist partners in the French government have yet given. </p> <p>In part this is political opportunism, though it does show awareness that the old categories no longer fit. Opposition parties across Europe are seizing on the tax revolt to revive their fortunes. Germany's Christian Democrats, still struggling to escape from the Helmut Kohl funding scandal, are hoping to emulate William Hague by hammering the government on the tax issue. </p> <p>Tony Blair governs in an easier parliamentary climate than either Gerhard Schr\u00f6der or Lionel Jospin. They both have Green party ministers in their coalitions who insist that any relief on fuel tax does not go against environmental principles. Dominique Voynet, the French environment minister, almost resigned when the government made its first concessions. Germany's Greens are demanding that tax concessions on fuel are compensated by better conservation measures. Car commuters in Germany have long benefited from special tax relief. The Greens want the same relief for those who go to work by train, bus or bicycle. </p> <p>It was the neo-liberalism of Reagan and Thatcher that first made political hay out of the fact that producers are also consumers. Promoting deregulation in order to get government out of owning or controlling public utilities, they seduced voters by offering the untrammelled competition that results in price wars and cheaper goods and services. In an apparent paradox, by favouring sales taxes over income tax they also switched the fiscal burden on to people as consumers rather than producers. We call this conjuring trick the stealth tax, though its political purpose was clear enough. It distributed the tax burden more equally between middle- and upper-income voters and the usually non-voting poor. </p> <p>Thanks to the fuel crisis, the worm has turned. People have become aware of just how high consumption taxes are. Direct action was more successful than any debates at Westminister in getting this point across. The new multiculturalism, caused by third world immigration and unprecedented social and geographical mobility, have made people in European societies see their identities as multilayered. People are no longer just one thing or another. The old English effort to \"place\" someone by knowing what school they went to no longer works. </p> <p>Equally, politicians need to see that people's interests are more multifaceted than ever before. Their wishes are a contradictory mixture of trade-offs between changing goals as producers, consumers, tax-payers and benefit-receivers. That is why millions suffered from the fuel protests but still supported them. It was a rare moment when people's multiple and divergent interests coalesced around a single issue and gave protest a critical mass. The government will have to recognise the justice of their cause. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:jonathan.steele@theguardian.com\">jonathan.steele@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "When Fidel Castro attended the United Nations millennium conference at the beginning of the month one of the New York tabloids displayed a front page shot of the Cuban leader and Bill Clinton supposedly shaking hands. <p>The newspaper stuck by the authenticity of its picture, although there remained a general disbelief that the handshake actually took place. The dark distrust between the two countries is gradually softening, although in a sporting context the Olympic boxing tournament, which the US and Cuba are set to dominate, might be seen as the last remnant of the old Cold War battle of wills. </p> <p>And the bout everyone is waiting to see is at heavyweight between Cuba's Felix Savon, five times the world champion and twice Olympic gold medal winner, and Michael Bennett, the reigning world champion. </p> <p>Bennett is the first and only US amateur heavyweight to arrive at the the Olympics as the reigning world champion, a title he took in the most bizarre of circumstances. </p> <p>During the world championships in Houston last year, the Cubans claimed they were victims of a whole string of dubious decisions, and when the four times world champion Juan Hernandez lost his welterweight final, they staged a walk out, claiming corruption in high places. </p> <p>The Amateur International Boxing Association over-turned that result, but there was no turning back for the Cubans with Savon forfeiting the final against Bennett. Hence the frisson surrounding next week's quarter-final between the two men, although the obvious disappointiment is that it cannot be the final. One of the two boxers will not even get a medal. </p> <p>The Olympic boxing, together with the judo, weightlifting, and fencing, is taking place in the Sydney Conference Centre here at Darling Harbour. It is the most prosaic of the Olympic sites, albeit in the most beautiful of surroundings. The conference centre consists of a number of huge sheds, the type that adorn countless industrial \"parks\" on the outskirts of British towns. </p> <p>Some effort had been made to bring a semblance of intimacy to the atmosphere of the boxing arena, although Australia's no smoking laws, as stringent as any in the world, prevent the sort of ambiance usually associated with boxing. Both Bennett and Savon fought yesterday, Bennett an easy points winner over Poland's Wojciech Bartnik, and Savon, now aged 33, stopping Nigeria's Rasmus Ojemaye in the second round. </p> <p>There has been one major change since the Atlanta Olympics, with four two-minute rounds replacing the old three three-minute rounds. Unchanged is the computerised scoring system whereby each judge has two buttons, red and blue, with which they record direct hits. </p> <p>In order to prevent any jiggery-pokery, three of the five judges must press a button within a second of each other for the boxer to get a point. Some of the judges look as if they would have trouble finding a light switch, never mind distinguishing red from blue. </p> <p>Generally a cluster of punches matters more than a haymaker, unless the latter delivers a knock down, while a solid jab may be more effective than a sneaky left hook to the body that the judges might not see. The computer's decision is final, subjectively speaking, that is. </p> <p>Only three boxers, the Hungary's Laszlo Papp, and the Jamaican-born Teofilo Stevenson of Cuba, have ever won three Olympic gold medals, Stevenson in the same division, super-heavyweight (over 91kg) and Papp, twice at light-middleweight (71kg) and once at middleweight (75kg). </p> <p>Savon won his heavyweight (91kg) golds in Barcelona and Atlanta, having dominated the amateur division since 1986. In the Atlanta final Canada's David Defiagbon spent the entire fight protecting his head and trying to stay on his feet, Savon winning 20-2 on points. </p> <p>Bennett will not be so obliging. The 29-year-old American only began boxing two years ago having taken up the sport during a seven-year jail stretch for the armed robbery of a toy store (\"Teddy bear for your daughter, sir?\"). He was released in 1998, and became world champion, albeit by default, the next year, although his most protracted fight was with the Australian immigration authorities who were not keen to let him into the country, these days having no truck with ex-cons. They finally relented this May. </p> <p>Since 1972 the Cubans have won 23 Olympic titles and 41 medals, and prior to Sydney their coach, Alcides Sagarra, claimed they would win 12 titles here. Bennett, displaying a grace not always associated with Chicago fighters, said of Savon: \"He is a boxing legend, and it will be nice to face him in battle because he is a great warrior.\" </p> <p>Come next Tuesday, Bennett may be altogether less refined. It promises to be the fight of the Sydney Olympics.</p>"
