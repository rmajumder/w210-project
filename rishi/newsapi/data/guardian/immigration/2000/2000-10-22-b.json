  "<p><strong> Civilisations </strong><br>Felipe Fernandez-Armesto<br>Macmillan \u00a325, pp636</p> <p>Once, 'civilisation' was an easy word. It was about how you held your tea-cup, treated your captive, scanned your Alexandrine or flushed away your excrement. Now the term has fallen apart, its fragments stained with subjectivism. As Felipe Fernandez-Armesto says: 'All definitions seem vitiated... I am civilised, you belong to a culture, he is a barbarian.' </p> <p>He is the most urbane of historians. This is one of those fashionable encyclopaedia-scale tomes (and he has written a few before), but whenever the going gets tough the author jumps forward to charm his reader: witty, sometimes sharply original, often in a gust of rage. Felipe has no patience with prayerful stuff about Western Christian civilisation. 'We Western Europeans are the dregs of Eurasian history and our lands are the sump into which that history has drained.' So is the civilisation word worth keeping at all? And if it is, how should we use it? </p> <p>Felipe (for short, but not for lack of respect) admits that it is a 'Western' word. The imperial connotations - 'I am civilised, they are barbarians' - simply cannot be rinsed out of it. So why use it when, as he says himself, 'a society' or 'a culture' would do the job better? He derides so-called 'polythetic' definitions of civilisation which set up a checklist of attributes such as cities, writing, metallurgy, division of labour and so on. But then, arbitrarily enough, he selects his own definition. Civilisation is what can happen when humans significantly change their environment: 'a relationship between one species and the rest of nature'. </p> <p>So the book is divided up into environments (the wastelands of 'desert, tundra, ice', the grasslands, the rain-forests, the mountain plateaux and valleys, the alluvial river-lands and so forth), and into accounts of how human beings managed or failed to transform their landscapes and seascapes. This is why the book does not run chronologically, until the final eruption of European culture and settlement across the globe forces an inevitable climax. </p> <p>The borderline for Felipe runs between societies which adapt themselves to their surroundings and those which adapt their surroundings. For instance, the medieval Scandinavian settlers who arrived in Greenland established farms on the wintry barrens and built churches of local stone, but the Thule people who entered the region at around the same time came with light umiak boats and hunted over the ice with dog-teams. Ancestors of the Inuit, they survived climatic changes in this extreme environment, while the ambitious and landscape-refashioning European colony did not. </p> <p>Simply to adapt and stay alive in tundra, swamp or desert may be a much more remarkable achievement than building a city among temperate woodlands. Felipe cites the horrible environment of Frederik Hendrik Island, off New Guinea, a sludge of mud and mosquitoes in which humans improbably invented a sustainable way of living on artificial mounds elaborately layered and manured for a variety of crops. And yet swamps no less repellent generated some of the first urban cultures in Central America. </p> <p>Civilisations is anything but a hymn to progress. Felipe insists that there is nothing necessarily virtuous or inevitable about changes in material culture. 'If the environment works for you, why fix it?' He quotes the agronomist Jack Harlan, who pointed out the apparent senselessness of moving from a hunter-gatherer economy to settled agriculture. Hunter-gatherers were healthier, less vulnerable to the weather and worked much less hard. In the same way, the Industrial Revolution saw millions of people exchange a bad rural life for a far worse life in the new cities. It doesn't help to use the word 'advance' to describe these changes, as if the shift to greater complexity were planned. </p> <p>Maybe intensive agriculture did not begin as an innovation for feeding more people, but started as a religious rite to do with death and the earth. Maybe the people who landed up in alluvial flood-plains arrived as unwilling refugees from lost hunting-grounds; they may have built drainage channels and dams simply to protect themselves, and only later discovered that these could be used to irrigate huge and regular crops. </p> <p>Felipe never allows himself to grow bored with his material. None the less, a historian so lively is bound to find some tracts of world history less exciting than others. His sections on the classical world miss some targets. Surely it would have suited his 'relationship with nature' thesis to discuss how Black Sea dried fish made the Graeco-Roman empires possible. And what about the theory that those empires only happened because the early city-states exploited the fragile Mediterranean soils to death and were forced to expand into Gaul, North Africa or the Levant?</p> <p>The author's archaeology can be a bit dated too. Diffusionism (the idea that all cultural developments radiated from a single centre by migration or conquest) has not been 'orthodoxy' for a long time. And why does he use the archaic Wade-Giles spelling for Chinese names? </p> <p>He is at his best in three places: the medieval African states of the Sahel, the opening-up of the Atlantic and the history of the Indian Ocean. 'The precocity of the Indian Ocean as a zone of long-range navigation and cultural exchange is one of the glaring facts of history', made possible by the 'reversible escalator' of the monsoons. Roman, Chinese and Arab trading fleets cruised between the opulent coastal cities of the region, which remained a 'civilised' zone until Vasco da Gama smashed his way into it in 1498. (I cannot understand why Felipe is so charitable to this brutish terrorist.) Soon the coastal states of Europe learnt to 'crack the code' of the Atlantic winds, and a new 'Western' culture arose on both sides of the ocean. </p> <p>But in the twentieth century that 'Atlantic civilisation' discharged an avalanche of cruelty and destruction. Asking himself 'why progress failed', Felipe suggests that the failure is almost as much an illusion as progress itself. The truth was that human beneficence had been badly over-estimated. And at the end of this long display of learning and passionate intelligence, he sums up: 'If you misrepresent civilisation as progressive, you are bound to disappoint people... scratch it and savagery bleeds out.'</p>",
  "As I scrambled through the mud towards the refugee camp, the sounds and scents overwhelmed me. I could hear logs being chopped, children playing, pigs squealing, cockerels squawking, and could smell the woodsmoke and the wet jungle. Memories came flooding back and I found myself terribly anxious. <p>Would people remember me? Would they be happy to see me? But my welcome at the camp in Thailand, near the Burmese border, could not have been warmer. Many of the students I had taught English now had children. One was named after me, born while I was in jail. 'Gold Rachel' was delightful and, unlike most Karenni babies, didn't scream at the sight of a white face. </p> <p>And then there were the new arrivals, with terrible tales of persecution and suffering. They had been living in the jungle for several years, having fled the relocation decreed in the Nineties by Burma's military dictatorship, one called 'Slorc' and now known as the State Peace and Development Council (SPDC). </p> <p>Their individual stories formed a picture of genocide. In the jungle they had to move five or six times a year, and slept without a roof over them. Their hiding place was discovered when their fifth child had just been born. Samuel is a skinny, unusually tall Karenni. 'The placenta hadn't even come out yet. I was terribly worried about my wife, I carried her through the streams as I was afraid about her walking through the cold water. But when we got to the border I couldn't carry her as we had to walk in the stream a long way. Now she gets migraines all the time.' The family walked for three weeks. They had to evade not just troops but mines and had to rely for guidance either on hired guides or resistance army soldiers. </p> <p>The Karenni are among the many persecuted ethnic minorities in Burma. Those that have no ceasefire agreement with the dictatorship have had their areas declared free-fire zones. Human rights abuses are rampant and hundreds of villagers victimised in an attempt to turn them against the resistance. The so-called 'Four Cuts' campaign tries to stop food, recruits, information and money reaching the resistance armies. </p> <p>Forced relocation began in 1974 in Karen and Chin State. In 1996 the scale of relocations increased dramatically, with 25,000 people forced into 'relocation centres' within Karenni State: roughly one eighth of the Karenni people torn from their ancestral lands in 12 months. </p> <p>Many areas of Karenni State, as well as other parts of Burma, have been cleared: 30,000 people used to live in an area approximately 100 miles by 30 miles in eastern Karenni, now it is completely depopulated. Escapees described to me the appalling conditions in relocation sites. There was no access to clean water, no land to cultivate, no materials for housing. Troops were everywhere. </p> <p>The old villages were burnt down and the remains mined to stop people returning, animals were slaughtered, and those determined to stay in their homes were burnt alive. Torture, beating and arbitrary execution accompany the SPDC soldiers wherever they go. </p> <p>When Paw Moo, now in her thirties, decided to go to a relocation camp, they had five days to vacate their own village four kilometres away. They had to do forced labour at the military base. </p> <p>She said: 'About six months ago the soldiers called all the villagers together, and arrested all the men. They took some as forced porters and others to Loikaw - the capital of Karenni State. Some managed to escape, others were put in jail, about 20 men disappeared. My husband hid in the jungle, many men did. After they arrested the men, they called the women together and said \"if we hear gun shots or that rebel groups are in the area, then we will kill you\".' When she and her family made the treacherous journey to Thailand, many of the men were still in jail. </p> <p>Sonny, from the same village as Paw Moo, confirms her story. 'The SPDC arrested 32 men and one woman because of fighting near the border. The resistance troops came near to our village, but they didn't come in or get food.' </p> <p>As we sat in the early-morning mist, Mee Reh told me his painful story. He was a subsistence farmer relocated from a village called Wha Lo. 'In 1995 the SPDC burnt down our village. Some people were killed, we ran away.' The years of sleepless nights and desperate poverty were written on his face. His youngest child, now two but the still the size of a six-month-old baby, will never fully develop, physically or mentally. </p> <p>They dodged troops, hiding in the jungle or in a cave. Often the sound of shooting kept them awake all night. They drank rice water and ate bamboo shoots. Because of malnutrition a child died. 'I became very depressed.' </p> <p>Mee Reh's wife breastfeeds her underdeveloped child. His infant features sit uncomfortably on his baby-sized face. She describes the story of her cousin's family, also in hiding, camped on the riverbank. They were hit by a flash flood. </p> <p>'All the children and Htoo La Paw were washed away, but two children were thrown to safety on the land. Htoo La Paw was badly injured. Later they found the elder girl under a log, her feet were sticking out from the freshly deposited sand and mud. They dug out her body, her head was crushed. The youngest daughter they found hanging in the bushes, dead, after the flood receded. They have been internally displaced people for five years, and want to come here. Everything they had was washed away, so they have no money to pay for a guide, or to be able to buy food on the way.' </p> <p>Mee Reh's wife reflects on how lucky they are that her eldest child is attending school. The village school in Wha Lo was closed by the SPDC before the village was burnt down, and there are no schools in the jungle for those in hiding. </p> <p>Villagers are forced to work without payment on government 'development projects' like building roads and barracks, farm clearance and cultivation. </p> <p>Mary was only 19 years old. She had been forced to work for the soldiers 20 days per month, mainly in digging and building projects. She was terrified, particularly after two women in her village were raped by soldiers. They asked her father, an old man, to fetch bamboo and beat him with their gun butts. They had to leave him behind because he was too old and frail to walk. Mary was clearly depressed by her feelings of helplessness. 'I'm not happy here, but I feel better than in my village. Our life is just waiting and eating donated rice.' </p> <p>For villagers asked to carry arms and supplies, it was a terrifying prospect. Tired porters are beaten or killed. Many of them never return. One escaped porter showed me the scars on his shoulders from the tremendous weight he was forced to carry. Porters are often marched in front of advancing battalions as human minesweepers. Gang rape of women porters is common. </p> <p>Bor Reh was forced to be the village headman, as he was the only person who could speak Burmese, and so translate the labour demands of the SPDC to the locals. The village head was once a pres tigious post to hold, now it is a responsibility better avoided. </p> <p>The SPDC's General Aung Gyi, head of Light Infantry Battalion Number 54 operating in this area, is infamous for his cruelty in punishing villagers, and for administering the punishments personally. Brutality against ethnic minorities is commonplace. Regular taxes, in the form of money and rice, are collected by SPDC troops, who also demand free food and alcohol when passing through the village. Curfews are often imposed. </p> <p>Deforestation, initially from low-impact logging by the Karenni but now widescale by the SPDC, has led to decreasing rainfall, which also has had impacts on rice yields. All these compound major food shortages for even those who still have land. </p> <p>Kyaw Te's trembling hands spoke of his life of fear in hiding. 'When we stayed there we were afraid all the time. The Burmese government, they want to destroy our people, to kill us all off.' </p> <p>The refugee camp is an increasingly insecure haven. Thailand's attitude to the ethnic minorities is changeable. Previously considered as a necessary buffer zone between Thailand and its aggressive neighbour, Burma, the resistance forces and the asylum-seekers are now deemed a nuisance in the growing closeness between the two nations. </p> <p>Hundreds of asylum-seekers have been forcibly repatriated, and new arrivals find it increasingly difficult to enter. Thailand and Burma have brokered a number of huge cross-border projects, fostering closer relations through economic ties. Two major gas pipeline projects, Yadana and Yetagun, including Total (France) and Premier Oil (Britain), are already complete and functional in an area south of Karenni State. </p> <p>Their impact on the local area has been devastating. There are plans afoot to dam and divert the Salween river that flows through Karenni State, feeding it into Thai waterways and starving three million people in downstream Burma of water. Among them are the Karenni. </p> <p>Last year I went to Burma to make a solidarity action for the many peoples of Burma. It was a simple act of defiance: to sing songs about democracy and freedom. The military response was rapid. I was arrested within 13 minutes. </p> <p><b>Useful links</b></p> <p><a href=\"http://www3.itu.int/MISSIONS/Myanmar/\" target=\"_NEW\"> Official statements from Myanmar regime</a><br> <a href=\"http://&lt;A HREF=\" http: www.freeburma.org \" target=\"_NEW\">Independent information and news</a> <br> <a href=\"http://www.amnesty.org\" target=\"_NEW\"> Amnesty International human rights charity</a></p>",
  "<p> It's four o'clock in Reykjavik's main shopping street, and the road is choked with a slow procession of cars, checking out the action on the crowded pavements. Iceland's young are out in force, parading up and down, colonising street corners in small groups, laughing, joking and admiring each others' new clothes. It's the same weekend scene you'll see on any main street in Europe's capital cities - except here, the shops have been closed for hours. It's four o'clock in the morning. And no one looks like they're ready to go home. </p> <p>At first glance, Iceland is an unlikely destination for ravers. A country with a population of only 280,000 and a language that has barely changed since the sagas were written down in the thirteenth century, until recently its main attraction for tourists was its awesome landscape. When I first visited in 1990, beer had been legal for less than a year, all-night clubs were unheard of, and our party of 40 or so regulars from a Soho club called The Brain, there to enjoy a weekend's dancing in Reykjavik's now-defunct Moon Club, were considered a great novelty. </p> <p>Those of us who'd come expecting an isolated, unsophisticated backwater were in for a surprise: the clubbers we met were mostly well-travelled, cool and cosmopolitan. But the real eye-opener was the crowd circulating in the streets outside on a Friday and Saturday night. A rowdy but good-looking mass drunkenly staggering round the city centre in search of fun, their energy, friendliness and lack of inhibition made for a memorable weekend. Except in the short summer months, Icelanders don't have a great deal of daylight, and so they make the most of every second of it. Their attitude to youth seems much the same: it doesn't last, so you should enjoy it to the full. </p> <p> It's little wonder that revellers from other parts of Europe came to join in. In fact, Iceland has a long history of partying hard. Reykjavik's oldest surviving building at 10 Aoalstraeti was once occupied by Bishop Geir V\u00eddal\u00edn (1761-1823), so famous for his hospitality that he once boasted: 'There are two places where the fires never die down - Hell and my house.' </p> <p>Sadly, the cleric's life had other parallels with modern Iceland, where many live beyond their means and the biggest shopping day of the month is the day after the credit card bills are issued. The bishop's love of the good life led him to be declared bankrupt. (The house is now a restaurant although the stories surrounding it are more interesting than the building itself.) </p> <p>There are a few rules to a night out in Reykjavik. First, dress up. This is a fashion-conscious city, and you're not going to get into many places unless you've made an effort - anoraks, cords and comfy jumpers just won't cut it. Second, take your credit cards or some serious cash: drinks are expensive. Mainly though, get used to being pushed around. If jostling were an Olympic sport, young Icelanders would come home bearing gold every time. They will lurch into you drunkenly, push past you to the bar or wherever else they want to go, dance on your table or on your feet without noticing. </p> <p>Patiently waiting to get into Kaffibarinn, the funky, fashionable and over-crowded bar part-owned by Blur's Damon Albarn, we protested to the doorman about queue-jumping. 'Here, it is the survival of the fittest,' he shrugged, and didn't object when one of our party subsequently shouldered past him. All of this can be uncomfortable at first, but relax, learn to dodge and you'll see that the activity is usually boisterous rather than aggressive. </p> <p>Our night started high up at Perlan (The Pearl), a spectacular glass dome built on top of a circle of shiny metal canisters storing some of the hot spring water that heats the city's homes and its seven outdoor swimming pools, leaving the airclear and unpolluted. Inside there's an artificial geyser that shoots up five storeys, a swish cocktail bar on the top floor, a revolving restaurant below it, and a caf\u00e9 with an outdoor balcony below that. There's no better place to watch the sun set into the sea, after which lights come on all over the dome, and you're sitting under your own artificial stars. </p> <p>There's no point in anything except a long, leisurely dinner afterwards. Alco hol is still prohibitively expensive, so most revellers enjoy a few drinks at home before going out, and the bars are dead until midnight. Indeed, with night action mainly limited to Friday and Saturday nights, most of them lead double lives: they are coffee houses and restaurants in the day, and on week nights the few that are open at all are often taken over for school dances. </p> <p>After midnight, it's really a matter of personal choice: the bars are nearly all on or just off Austurstraeti and Laugavegur, and it's normal to move to several in the course of a night: just follow the crowds, look through windows or listen to the music coming out of the open doors until you find something you like. We passed establishments playing funk, hip hop, salsa, jazz, techno and reggae, places that looked small and cosy, an Irish bar, an English pub, designer hang-outs and others that were satisfyingly seedy. </p> <p>We stopped several people in the street to ask for advice and directions, and though a few turned out to be too drunk to direct themselves, let alone a stranger, all were chatty, happy to help - and nearly all spoke excellent English. </p> <p>After an expensive but memorable seafood dinner at the upmarket and ultracool Ap\u00f3tek (Austurstraeti 16), we continued our bar crawl at Skuggabarinn (Shadow Bar) in Hotel Borg in P\u00f3sth\u00fasstraeti (the best hotel to stay in if you're planning a night out since it's right in the middle of the action, but the worst venue you could choose at weekends if you were thinking of sleeping). Catering to a mainly older, but very chic crowd, it's a big, comfortable old place full of oil paintings, velvet drapes and gilt mirrors with MTV flickering in one bar, a small dancefloor where they are playing up-to-the-minute American R&amp;B hits in another, and lots of cosy side rooms and alcoves with sofas and tables. Nearby Rex (9 Austurstraeti) is a modern bar/restaurant designed by Terence Conran catering to a similarly sophisticated crowd, most of them sitting at tables with an ice bucket of wine or champagne. </p> <p> Ten minutes walk away, some drunken students at the small, crowded two-tier Vegam\u00f3t (4 Vegam\u00f3tastig) shouted into my ear over the vintage funk and soul soundtrack with their own bizarre theory about the older crowd at these two establishments. Everyone there must be gay, insisted my new friend. Why would any women over the age of 25 or men over 30 want to go out, unless they were unable to marry and settle down? One of them also claimed to feature in Dancer In The Dark , the film starring Bj\u00f6rk which was advertised on posters all over town. He changed his story, however, on hearing I'd seen it, and loudly insisted instead that Bj\u00f6rk was, in any case, overrated. Many of the crowd seemed to spend as much time hunched over their mobiles as they did drinking, frantically text-messaging friends in other bars or those outside on the street, unable to find a fake ID to say they were 20 and old enough to buy drinks. </p> <p>After that, the night blurs. Kaffibarinn (1 Bergstadastraeti) was crowded but very cool, a two-storey house decorated with a huge London Tube symbol. Further back down the hill, Kaffi Thomsen (17 Hafnarstraeti) doesn't really warm up until 3am, when its cover charge goes up from 500 kr\u00f3na (\u00a34) to 1,000 and the banging techno and house mix starts to fill up the rough wooden dancefloor. When I asked when it closed, replies were vague. 'Whenever,' said one. 'Or maybe never.' </p> <p>By 4.30am, I'd had enough. Leaving most of our party waving their hands in the air like they just didn't care, two of us left for a delicious hotdog from the stalls near the shed-like Parliament Building, then took a slow walk back to our hotel. The air was crisp, clear and still, the night silent except for the hooting of swans on the lake by the ultra-modern City Hall. There are taxis everywhere, but few cities feel as safe to walk in at this time of night. Or as beautiful. </p> <p>\u0095 Sheryl Garratt travelled as a guest of Icelandair (020 7874 1000) which has 12 flights a week from Heathrow and daily flights from Glasgow to Reykjavik.

  "<p> Lincoln's Christmas Market has grown from humble beginnings 19 years ago to become an event that attracts more than a quarter of a million visitors. The city's cobbled square plays host to more than 200 stalls selling almost every conceivable Christmas gift, with traders in Victorian costume and choirs performing carols, overlooked by the floodlit cathedral. The market opens on the evening of 7 December and runs daily until 10 December. Accommodation in the city itself can be tricky to find, although the Tourist Information Centre (01522 873213) has details of availability for miles around. </p> <p> Germany takes its Christmas markets seriously, with variations on the theme in most towns and cities. German Travel Centre (020 8429 2900) offers short-break packages to the big events including Cologne. The price of \u00a3137 per person includes one night in a standard-class hotel and return flights from Stansted; a first-class hotel would cost \u00a3147 pp, and flights are available from other airports. </p> <p>Centred around an ice rink in the medieval market square, the Christmas market in Bruges runs from 1 December to 2 January. Chalet-style stalls offer a good selection of gifts, ranging from sheepskin and woollens to jewellery, while the surrounding shops sell lace and chocolate. A three-night break, including one free night, with Eurotunnel Motoring Holidays (0870 3332001) costs \u00a3119 per person, based on two sharing, inclusive of return Eurotunnel crossing for car and passengers and bed and breakfast accommodation at the three-star Novotel Centrum Hotel. </p> <p>The Austrian city of Vienna boasts six Christmas markets, the highlight being the Christkindlsmarkt in front of City Hall. This traditional market has been going for 700 years and, as well as the usual shopping opportunities, provides pony rides, a merry-go-round and fairytale readings. At weekends choirs from across the world perform Christmas songs in the city's Festival Halls. The market runs from 18 November to 24 December, from 9am to 9pm daily. Leisure Direction (020 8324 3030) is offering discounts of \u00a370 per person on two-night breaks booked before 31 October. The price of \u00a3184 per person includes four-star accommodation with breakfast and return flights from Stansted. </p> <p> Copenhagen's festivities centre on the Tivoli Gardens from 17 November to 23 December. The gardens are decorated with thousands of lights and miles of garlands, the lake is transformed into an ice rink, miniature goats roam Alpeland and Father Christmas's cave is just next door to the Cake Houses. I'm sure it will all make perfect sense once you're there. Sovereign Cities and Short Breaks (08705 768373) has availability at the three-star Hotel Alexandra, with prices starting at \u00a3306 per person for two nights' bed and breakfast and return flights from Stansted. To make the most of the madness, time your visit to coincide with the Great Christmas Parade on 25 November.</p>",
  "<p> The Beatle industry rocks on, hitting two anniversaries this autumn. John Lennon would have been 60 on 9 October, and on 8 December it will be 20 years since he was murdered. For reasons that lie somewhere beyond good taste, Yoko Ono has included the glasses he was wearing when he died and the Roosevelt Hospital bag containing his death clothes among the hundreds of items in an exhibition devoted to Lennon that opened last week at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum, in Cleveland, Ohio. Meanwhile, a permanent Lennon museum has just opened its doors in Tokyo, suggesting that the diehard fan's credit card will be painfully squeezed in the coming months. </p> <p>The Ohio exhibition runs until next September. Here is the moody leather jacket from the red-light Hamburg days, and the naff collarless number that the fastidious Brian Epstein forced a reluctant Lennon to wear. There's the 'All You Need Is Love' frock coat, a Magical Mystery Tour costume, and the embarrassing 'Starting Over' kimono. There are dozens of scruffy, scribbled lyrics that changed people's lives. The shop-load of guitars include the 12-string Rickenbacker of the Beatle days, and the Telecaster he used in his last concert. His bed and his piano, artworks and ephemera, in addition to films, videos, lectures and events, make up a massive tribute. </p> <p>Rock Hall, as it is less cumbersomely known to Cleveland cabbies, is expert at such exercises. A Jimi Hendrix exhibit was up and running before Lennon opened, and I was recently invited over to help celebrate Muddy Waters in a week of loud music, films, lectures and ageing blues writers nattering their way from bar to bar. Waters followed Woody Guthrie, Jimmie Rodgers, Robert Johnson and Louis Jordan in Rock Hall's annual American Music Masters series. The reason for my involvement, as the token white Englishman at the event, was the publication in 1998 of my book The Story of Chess Records , a long fan letter to Muddy's record label. </p> <p>Although Cleveland by and large ignores the fact that it sits beside nearly 10,000 square miles of Lake Erie, the Hall of Fame is one building that does make the most of its waterfront setting. Walk gently downhill through the downtown area - and this is a city where a wandering Brit is not seen as a dangerous madman - and it is waiting in front of the sparkling lake. </p> <p>At its core is a tower, 162ft high, but it is the glass that takes the breath away - a vast tented pyramid, standing in a sculpted plaza. If a similar structure in the Louvre courtyard comes to mind, well spotted - Chinese architect I.M. Pei designed them both. From the air, my guide Santina Protopapa tells me, the plan of the building represents an old-fashioned record player. We both have to take Mr Pei's word for it. </p> <p>Rock Hall is educational and archival, but above all entertaining. In 1983 various music-business worthies created the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Foundation, an idea without bricks and mortar, to honour their heroes. Starting with Chuck Berry, they have been adding names ever since. </p> <p> The search for a permanent site began in 1986 and numerous cities put in bids, Cleveland won and opened for business in 1995. The huge basement museum, a roller-coaster ride through the history of rock, is an object lesson in how to nail rock'n'roll to a wall but still let it wriggle. Britney Spears isn't here, of course, but her fans can feel what made Elvis so dangerous, Howlin' Wolf so inspiring, Hendrix so revolutionary. </p> <p>Any museum that even remembers politico-rocker Phil Ochs, let alone has obtained the gold lam\u00e9 suit that he wore to tease his purist folk fans, has a lot going for it In the punk exhibit, a long way from home, I am con fronted with a death threat - an issue of Sniffin' Glue fanzine dedicated 'to John Collis - RIP'. It was prompted by something I once wrote about the musical intricacy of punk rock, no doubt. Upstairs, the Sun Studio equipment on which Elvis, Jerry Lee Lewis, Carl Perkins, Johnny Cash and Roy Orbison created their uncanny noise is on display, together with constantly looped movies and rock videos ('Advisory: contains adult themes'). Higher still is an interactive juke-box stocked with 25,000 tracks, and a film show on rock history - this time the themes are 'mature'. At Rock Hall's summit, the significance of hip hop as today's blues is given due prominence. </p> <p>Until Rock Hall opened, Cleveland had an international reputation for two other cultural institutions. The Cleveland Orchestra plays at the baroque Severance Hall, at the east end of town across from the university. Behind the Hall, in elegant parkland, is the Cleveland Museum of Art, an architectural clash between 1916 neo-classicism and vast modern marble slabs. From ancient Greece to the US avant-garde, the artistic collisions inside are just as striking. </p> <p>Cleveland itself is caught halfway between its industrial past and its future as a cultural and educational centre. The relics of industry, on the west side, are so dominating that they have now achieved their own rusty grandeur. Traffic is fed in and out on a series of Brobdingnagian viaducts, spanning the twists of the Cuyahoga River. Beneath one of these, monumental in blue metal, huddles The Flats, centred on a street of bars and restaurants that pretend 1967 never ended. Each is decorated with hippy splashes of colour, announcing Crabs and Liquor and Fine Dining. </p> <p>In the Warehouse District, gaunt and windswept but showing signs that the loft-and-bistro generation is moving in, I found a rarity - a shop. Cleveland, by and large, prefers malls to shops, but this one advertised 'Newspapers and Magazines'. I entered in innocence, buying a copy of the world's dullest daily, the Cleveland Plain Dealer . I immediately realised that the newspaper business was a trivial sideline. This was a temple to gaudy videos of a specialist nature. At nine in the morning, some of the images make the eyes water. 'Have a nice day,' said the cheerful shopkeeper. 'Er, yes. Just browsing.' </p> <p>The two most imposing skyscrapers in the adjacent district, Tower City, have the dignity and detailing of a past age, more Empire State than Canary Wharf. Beneath the tallest is one of those 1930s granite civic halls that America excels at, each like a tiny Grand Central Station. Ten years ago it was extended backwards in the same architectural style, with waterfalls, elegant staircases and shops. </p> <p>Nearby is the gigantic revolving guitar of the Hard Rock Caf\u00e9, and the baseball stadium where the Cleveland Indians play. Around here, pub rock lives. The former Band drummer Levon Helm, cheerful though gaunt in cancer remission, was at Fat Fish Blue while I was there, and the city's own Mississippi bluesman Robert Jr Lockwood, now in his mid-eighties, is a regular. A block east on Prospect Avenue SE, Baron's is one of half-a-dozen Cleveland bars giving the lie to the belief that Americans drink only Homer Simpson's Duff Beer. Baron's is a brew-pub, offering a wide choice from an authentic pilsner to a sweet, dark-brown ale. </p> <p>Bars like Baron's, with bluesmen on the balcony and beer bubbling in the basement, along with Rock Hall and the stunning Museum of Art, point a way forward for Cleveland now that its industrial base is shrinking. It must be admitted that the city is not a picturesque paradise, but as a stopover on a musical pilgrimage, moving on to the blues clubs of Chicago and maybe to Rock Hall's rival attraction, The Experience in Seattle, it is a rewarding and exciting town. </p> <p><strong>That's where the music takes me</strong></p> <p> <strong>The Motown Museum, Detroit </strong><br> Housed in the small, clapboard house which was a recording studio for the Tamla Motown artists in the 1960s, this museum pays homage to Motown's golden era.

  "<p><strong>This Is Spinal Tap</strong> (1983) (15, MGM, VHS/DVD, Retail)<br>Rob Reiner's deadly accurate parody of a rockumentary charts the disastrous progress of a disintegrating British rock group (the American actors' accents are impeccable) on their last US tour. Not only has the movie worn well, it has created its own legend, which is dealt with in the additional features of the Special Edition DVD and the book This is Spinal Tap - The Official Companion (Bloomsbury) which has the complete script and lyrics, as well as a wide-ranging A-Z guide by Karl French.</p> <p><strong>Ride With the Devil</strong> (1999) (15, Entertainment, VHS/DVD/Retail)<br>The Taiwanese director Ang Lee followed up Sense and Sensibility and The Ice Storm with this magnificent western set west of the Mississippi, where the American Civil War was conducted between irregular forces. Most of the action is seen through the eyes of a German immigrant's 17-year-old son (Toby McGuire) who joins a Southern guerrilla band, and the picture traces his experience of this insane, brutal conflict and his subsequent healing. The action sequences (especially the pivotal raid on Lawrence, Kansas, by the charismatic madman Charles Quantrill) are superbly staged, but the movie is notable for its contemplative scenes and its attention to period language. Along the way Lee is also commenting on the savage civil wars of our own day. The DVD contains a 'making of' documentary.</p> <p><strong>Scream 3</strong> (1999) (18, Buena Vista, VHS/Rental, DVD/Retail)<br>Wes Craven completes his trilogy of post-modern, self-referential horror flicks with a flourish, moving on from the high school and college campus settings of the first two to a Hollywood studio headed by Roger Corman where 'Stab 3' is being made. People are being killed in the order of the script, but the script is constantly being re-written and the characters realise that in the last part of trilogies (eg Godfather III) the rules change. It's funny, clever, very frightening and not recommended for solo viewing.</p> <p><strong>Young and Innocent</strong> (1937) (U, Hollywood Screen Classics, VHS/Retail)<br>Lightweight and immensely enjoyable Hitchcock thriller about an innocent fugitive (Derrick de Marney), accused of murdering a movie star on a Home Counties beach, who enlists the reluctant assistance of the chief constable's daughter (Nova Pilbeam) to clear his name. It features two of the Master's great set-pieces - the children's birthday party and the discovery of the twitching killer at the th\u00e9 dansant. It's released along with Rich and Strange (1932, U), one of Hitch's rare non-thrillers from the sound era, a fascinating (but unpopular) drama about a middle-class couple embarking on a cruise to the Orient to restore their stale marriage and undergoing bizarre adventures.</p>",
  "<p>Europe's biggest glacier is about to disintegrate. The mighty Breidamerkurj\u00f6kull in southern Iceland is breaking apart and will slide into the north Atlantic in the next few years.</p> <p>Researchers' discovery of the imminent destruction of this gigantic river of ice demonstrates starkly that global warming is now making a serious impact on the northern hemisphere, threatening to melt ice caps and raise sea levels round the world.</p> <p>The grim revelation will be seized upon by green activists who believe that industrial gas emissions are responsible for heating the planet's atmosphere. If the continent's biggest glacier is falling apart, they ask, what further catastrophes await us?</p> <p>The break-up of Breidamerkurj\u00f6kull also threatens to destroy a key Icelandic beauty spot. Each year hordes of visitors take boat trips around the dozens of icebergs that regularly 'calve' from the glacier and festoon the lake at its base. Moviemakers have used the breathtaking location for a host of films, including the James Bond adventure A View to a Kill, and the forthcoming Tomb Raider, starring Angelina Jolie.</p> <p>But now silt and sediment - which have already started to pour from the melting glacier - are likely to fill up the lake, destroying this remarkable beauty spot.</p> <p>'The glacier has been shrinking for most of the twentieth century,' said Dr David Evans, of Glasgow University. 'However it is clear it is now approaching the point where a great mass of it will break up, and pour down to the sea. When it does, J\u00f6kulsarlon will probably fill up with sediment.'</p> <p>Breidamerkurj\u00f6kull is the main glacier emanating from the massive Vatnaj\u00f6kull ice sheet that covers much of southern Iceland, and has been studied intensively for the past century, beginning in 1903 when map makers recorded that its icy snout rested only a few hundred yards from the sea.</p> <p>By 1945 United States military cartographers had found it had receded a further few hundred yards from the coast.</p> <p>Then, in 1965, Glasgow University surveyors arrived to make new maps of Breidamerkurj\u00f6kull and found the glacier had slipped back from the sea by a couple of miles.</p> <p>This survey was followed up in 1998 when another team from Glasgow began a new survey using global positioning satellite equipment and other high-precision devices.</p> <p>For the past two years researchers Yvonne Finlayson and Mike Shand, from the university's geography department, have been collating this data. They have completed a detailed topographic map of the region.</p> <p>The results are startling. They show the great river of ice has dwindled dramatically over the past 30 years. This recession has revealed a giant portion of the huge fjord - once covered completely by the glacier - has now been exposed as Breidamerkurj\u00f6kull's snout has retreated more than five miles from the sea.</p> <p>But detailed analysis of the glacier has revealed an even more disturbing picture. The Glasgow team - working with Loughborough University researchers led by David Twigg - says a huge depression has formed over the glacier's frozen heart. This hole rests over the portion of the inland fjord still covered by ice. </p> <p>'Effectively, the glacier is breaking up around that hole and is slipping into the fjord,' said Evans. 'It is beginning to disintegrate and in the next few years will collapse into the water.'</p> <p>The disappearance of a massive ice floe that once coated a large area of the Icelandic coast is a stark demonstration of the increasing impact global warming is having on the planet. The question is: to what extent is humanity responsible for this heating, and what further impact will it have on Earth?</p> <p>Many environmentalists point out that industrial emissions have allowed carbon dioxide to build up in the atmosphere to dangerous levels. Sunlight is being trapped by this carbon dioxide and causing the planet to warm. One estimate suggests the Arctic has warmed by 6\u00b0C in the past 30 years, while its ice covering has dropped from 10ft to 6ft.</p> <p>Atmospheric levels of carbon dioxide have doubled in the past century, just as global temperatures have risen. The effects can be seen everywhere, green activists say, including Breidamerkurj\u00f6kull.</p> <p>But such alarmist visions have to be tempered with knowledge about the past behaviour of Iceland's glaciers. In the seventeenth century the coastal land around Breidamerkurj\u00f6kull was ice-free and farmed quite intensively by local people. Cattle and sheep grazed, and barley and wheat were grown.</p> <p>Then, in the early decades of the eighteenth century, the climate grew colder and giant tongues of ice emerged from the Vatnaj\u00f6kull sheet, including the Breidamerkurj\u00f6kull glacier. These moved inexorably down to the coast, covering pastures and crushing farmhouses that lay in their path.</p> <p>'This period is known as the Little Ice Age and it lasted almost 200 years, reaching its peak, in Iceland, in 1890, when Breidamerkurj\u00f6kull got closest to the sea,' said Evans.</p> <p>'That mini-ice age is over now, and the climate has been getting warmer for the past 100 years. Hence the shrinking and disintegration of the glacier.'</p> <p>In the past 30 years, old farmlands have reappeared around Breidamerkurj\u00f6kull - most of it pockmarked with holes gouged by receding glaciers. </p> <p>Local people have already moved on to this land and begun cropping grass and grazing sheep. 'The land is simply being returned to its old use,' said Evans.</p> <p>Whether this restoration of agricultural land and the loss of the glacier is being triggered solely by natural climatic variation, or is being speeded up by the effects of man pumping industrial gases into the atmosphere, has yet to be determined. </p> <p>Either way, the fate of Breidamerkurj\u00f6kull is our starkest warning that global warming now has a direct impact on our continent. The heat is on, whether we like it or not.</p> <p> <strong>Tell-tale signs</strong></p> <p>Other indicators of global warming are: </p> <p> <strong> \u0095 Winter </strong> is in retreat. Europe's growing season is 11 days longer than it was 35 years ago. </p> <p> <strong> \u0095 </strong> <strong> Sea levels</strong> have crept higher throughout the last century at the rate of a millimetre a year. </p> <p> <strong> \u0095 Hot summers</strong>. Six of the 10 warmest years ever recorded occurred in the 1990s; the other four all happened in the late 1980s. </p> <p> <strong> \u0095 </strong> <strong> Declining ice sheet</strong>. The Arctic ice cover is shrinking by an area the size of the Netherlands every year.</p>",
  "Refugees will get help to find jobs and integrate into communities in a government drive that will be seen as an admission that much of its rhetoric on asylum-seekers has been too harsh. <p>Immigration Minister Barbara Roche will urge the nation to celebrate the contribution refugees can make, while a national support network will smooth their passage into the community once their applications for asylum have been accepted. </p> <p>In a separate move, new guidelines will instruct police officers to challenge racist claims that are made about asylum-seekers. </p> <p>Roche wants to attack the idea that those fleeing persecution are 'welfare scroungers'. The measures, to be announced early next month, will be seen as a significant softening of government rhetoric. One senior source said: 'We have to completely confine asylum to whether somebody has a well-founded fear of persecution. </p> <p>'But once we see they do, and give them leave to remain, then we must make sure we are using people as best we can. The message is very strongly that we are a nation of immigrants, that we are all the better for it, and that we need to make the best use of everyone's talents.' </p> <p>A recent Home Office study found that more than a third of 263 refugees questioned had a degree or professional qualification. Yet over half of those with UK-recognised qualifications were out of work. The scheme will try to place refugees in work or on courses to turn their qualifications into UK-recognised equivalents. It will also attempt to forge good relations between refugees and police. </p> <p>A spokeswoman for the Refugee Council, which will help set it up, said asylum must remain a humanitarian rather than economic issue, but added: 'Once they are here, we want everybody to be able to contribute. If we are desperately looking for nurses and teachers we shouldn't be wasting the resources many of these people have.' </p> <p>The advice to police on challenging racist claims comes from the Association of Chief Police Officers and follows public disturbances over the arrival of asylum-seekers in the Channel ports. </p> <p>Refugee organisations have repeatedly complained that inflammatory talk about immigrant crime or 'floods' of bogus claimants encourages racist violence. </p> <p>The association will issue its new guidelines, drawn up by Kent Police, in January. The strategy in Dover and Folkestone earlier this year was to challenge 'wild claims' about refugees with facts. Police also reminded local newspapers - one of which described asylum-seekers as 'human refuse' - of their obligations under race relations law. A Kent Police spokesman said: 'You have to counter hysteria with facts. When anyone claimed that asylum-seekers were responsible for a disproportionate amount of crime, we said it was not true. Police visited local newspaper offices and discussed with editors the law as it related to inciting racial hatred.' </p> <p>The guidelines will not be compulsory. But Gurbux Singh, chairman of the Commission for Racial Equality, welcomed the move. 'If people in positions of authority send out a message that it is OK to discriminate against others, that gives a green light to some of the worst elements in our society.'</p>",
  "<p>I am convinced that a recipe should not be a set of rules to be followed to the letter for a mind-numbingly uniform result, but when I hear someone praising a recipe because it always works, my heart sinks a little. I believe a recipe should be treated as a living thing, something allowed to breathe, to change its nature to suit our ingredients, our mood and our desires. </p> <p>Have new cooks really come to rely on a set of regimented, foolproof orders that forbid them to use their own gut instincts? To me, there are few greater pleasures than cooking without being glued to a recipe, following our own instincts and common sense. Do not ignore those thousands of recipes published every year - there is much fun to be had with them - but I want to suggest, actually to beg, that sometimes we should use them lightly, instead following our own hunches. </p> <p>I want to encourage you to take in the spirit of the recipes that follow, but then to deviate according to your ingredients and your feelings, to understand that our ingredients and our hunger are variables that should not, cannot, be subjected to a set of formulas laid down in stone. I want to get you to break the rules. I want you to follow your appetite. </p> <p> You know what you like and what you don't. When shopping, you don't even bother to try some things on. Other things you dither over and reject. Other times you know, positively, instantly, instinctively, that something is right. Well, cooking can be just like that. </p> <p>A recipe is only telling you about someone else's taste. The writer is not allowing for your own. This is why I get exasperated with the more pedantic branch of the cookery-writing world that insists, 'This is the ultimate recipe, and this is how it must be done, otherwise it is just not right.' What they mean is that they have done this recipe over and over again and they think it is delicious and want you to try it, too. Fair enough. But to assume that their word is law is ridiculous - not to say downright arrogant. Don't be bullied by recipe writers. Listen to what they have to say - they know the pitfalls and also the fun to be had cooking - but trust your own taste, too. If you like the taste of a recipe as it is and the next line says, 'Add 300ml more cream', don't be bullied into adding the extra cream. Taste continually as you cook, and trust that taste. The crux of the matter is that it may be their recipe, but it is your supper. </p> <p> I have never believed in the foolproof recipe. It simply doesn't exist. No recipe can take into account what I call 'the variables'. How can any recipe tell you to cook a piece of fish for four minutes, then turn it over and cook the other side for two minutes longer? How does the recipe writer know how thick your pan is, the pressure of your gas, your version of moderate or high or simmer or stir? How do they know the accuracy of every oven, the thickness of your every cake tin, the nuances of every pot, pan and cooker? More importantly, how can that recipe assume to know the exact nature of your piece of fish? Telepathy? </p> <p>The fact is that food varies, and that is what makes it so interesting. Today's piece of cod may be slightly thicker than yesterday's. One brand of butter may differ from another. Olive oil changes with every bottle; that is part of its joy. So how can anyone be so pedantic as to give exact timings? Each egg, each steak, each potato is different and will behave in a different way in the pan. That is what cooking is about, and that is why it is essential to understand what you are doing rather than just mindlessly following a recipe. </p> <p> While some people like the 'certainty' that comes from following an exact recipe, others rarely bother with them. How many times do you hear someone say, 'I just throw it all together and it always seems to work out fine'? This does not always mean that they are experienced cooks - it may be more that they have an instinct for what might go with what. They may also have read or heard that x is good with y, or vaguely recall something they once ate. Whatever sort of cook you are there is nothing quite so rewarding as following your instincts and finding they pay off. </p> <p> There is a branch of cookery I called Cluttered Cooking. By this I mean recipes that are so choc-a-bloc full of ingredients and seasoning that the main ingredient itself has been lost. I find a lot of so-called fusion food suffers from this, as does some classical French cookery. I prefer the marriage of a few, intelligently chosen ingredients rather than a mishmash of everything in the cupboard. </p> <p>All the recipes in this book are a result of the pared-down approach. When people say they must follow a recipe, I often wonder if it is because they have not grasped the idea of less is more - the approach where just one or two ingredients are added to fish or meat or a vegetable to which they are perfectly suited. </p> <p>Whereas I would never wish to undermine the harmonious mixture of spices that work to flavour a curry sauce, say, I think we need to ask why we are adding something. What will it add and, frankly, what is its point? Anybody who doubts me need only roast a dish of slightly tart, green-speckled tomatoes with a drizzle of olive oil, some salt, whole garlic and black pepper, then compare it with one to which they have added aubergines, peppers, onions, courgettes, tomato sauce and oregano. One taste of the pared-down, uncluttered flavour of a roast tomato, its sweet-sharp, thin juices clean and unadulterated, and you will wonder why anyone would ever even consider making ratatouille.</p> <p><strong> A fishcake to console</strong> </p> <p> There is something peaceful and faintly reassuring about a fishcake. Old-fashioned food that reminds us of less frantic times. It is not for the sake of convenience that fishcakes are made with equal amounts of potato to fish. It is simply that the ratio seems right: not enough potato and the cakes lack substance, too much and they lack flavour. As alway s, it is up to us to nudge the two to make the recipe our own. Enough for 4-6. </p> <p><strong> 500g potatoes</strong> <br> <strong>500g salmon, haddock, cod, hake or any large-flaked white fish </strong> <br> <strong>milk for baking the fish in </strong> <br> <strong>a little flour for coating </strong> <br> <strong>butter and oil for frying </strong> <br> <strong>a large glass of white wine, not too dry</strong> <br> <strong>a small bunch of tarragon </strong> <br> <strong>1 medium carton (about 300ml) cream</strong> </p> <p> Set the oven at 200 C/gas mark 6. Peel the potatoes and cut them into large chunks, then boil them to tenderness in salted water. Meanwhile, put the fish into a baking dish, almost cover with milk - you can add a bay leaf or two if you like - then bake until the fish is opaque and will come easily from the bone or skin when you pull it. You can expect this to take about 10 to 15 minutes, bearing in mind that different types of fish take slightly different times to cook. </p> <p>Drain the potatoes, putting them back into the empty pan over a moderate heat for a few minutes if they seem wet, then mash them with a potato masher. Lift the fish from its milk, reserving the liquid, then pull the flakes away from the bones and skin. Tip the fish into the mashed potato, add salt and grind over some black pepper - if you wish to add any of the additional seasonings below, do so now - and mix briefly and gently, so as not to crush the flakes of fish too much. </p> <p>Shape the mixture into patties, as large or small as you like (I favour ones the size of a digestive biscuit and the thickness of an English muffin), coating each one lightly in flour as you go. I think you should avoid the temptation to err towards perfection. Wobbly cooking has a certain charm about it. </p> <p>Melt a little butter and oil in a frying pan (you need enough to coat the bottom of the pan) and fry your cakes till they are softly golden. This should take no more than a couple of minutes on each side. Keep them hot in a low oven. </p> <p>Wipe the pan out with kitchen paper, add the glass of wine and let it bubble down over a high heat until there are just a few tablespoons left; strip the tarragon leaves from their stems and drop them into the wine as it bubbles. Pour in the cream and a wine glassful of the fish milk and bring to the boil, turning it down to a fierce simmer so it thickens somewhat. Season with salt and pepper, then pour it over the fishcakes. </p> <p> <strong> And more...</strong></p> <p><strong> Some good things to add to your fishcakes</strong> <br> Chopped, vivid-green parsley leaves; 5 or 6 mashed anchovies; a few shakes of anchovy sauce; chopped tarragon leaves; chopped dill; chopped leeks cooked in butter till soft. </p> <p> <strong> A chilli-hot, citrus-scented fishcake </strong><br> Forget the potatoes. Skin the fish (500g will be enough for 4 people). Blitz 2 spring onions, 2 cloves of garlic, a couple of small, seeded red chillies and 6 lime leaves together with a handful of coriander leaves in a food processor to make a thick sludge. Mix in 1 tbsp of nam pla (Thai fish sauce) and tip it into a bowl. Whiz the fish to a coarse paste, then mix it with the seasonings and shape into small cakes. Some flour on your hands will be useful here. Fry till golden brown. </p> <p> <strong> A smoked fishcake </strong><br> The smoky flavour of cured haddock, Arbroath smokies or even smoked salmon makes a beautiful, rather homely tasting fishcake, reminiscent of Victorian high tea. It is flattered enormously by a cream and parsley sauce (simply substitute parsley for the tarragon above, then whiz the sauce in a blender). Cured haddock and smokies will need cooking in milk, as above. Smoked trout or salmon can be added directly to the potato. </p> <p> <strong> Tinned-fish fishcakes </strong><br> Lovely. Canned salmon and sardines make deeply flavoured fishcakes. You will need the same quantity as fresh fish, and you will have to drain them of their oil or water. Squeeze wedges of lemon over. </p> <p> <strong> Little prawn cakes </strong><br> Make these in the same way as the chilli-hot cakes above but using defrosted cooked prawns. I sometimes add a dollop of mayonnaise and a little flour - the mayonnaise adding lusciousness, the flour holding the fragile little cakes in one piece. </p> <p> <strong> Chicken, garlic, herbs - a simple supper</strong> </p> <p> If we are to eat well, we need to know how to exploit every bit of flavour in our food. The idea that follows does exactly that. Meat is cooked slowly on the bone over a low to moderate heat so that, as it tenderises, it leaves a thin film of goo - the caramelised meat juices - with which we can make a sauce (when I say sauce, I mean something quite thin and meagre in quantity, but intensely flavoured rather than a copious creamy blanket). </p> <p>There is something neat about this recipe, and I am not talking about its frugal use of kitchen equipment, though that is another point in its favour. The shopping list, as always, is short. The method is straightforward, undemanding. Spinach or courgettes, briefly boiled and tossed with butter and lemon juice, and some French bread for mopping your plate might be good here. Enough for 4. </p> <p><strong> free-range chicken - either a small bird, jointed by the butcher, or 2 chicken pieces per person, skin and bones to remain in place</strong> <br> <strong>olive oil </strong> <br> <strong>a thick slice of butter </strong> <br> <strong>6 large, sweet cloves of garlic </strong> <br> <strong>a small bunch of parsley, plus tarragon, thyme or chervil </strong> <br> <strong>a large wine glass of white wine or dry vermouth </strong> </p> <p>Rub the chicken all over with a little oil and some black pepper. In a large pan - it can be high-sided or shallow but it must have a lid - warm enough olive oil to give a small puddle in the bottom, then add the butter. Once the butter starts to froth, put in the chicken pieces and keep the heat moderately high while they colour. A pale and relatively even gold is what you are after. </p> <p>Meanwhile, put the whole unpeeled garlic cloves on a board and, with the flat blade of a knife, squash them so they flatten but remain fairly intact. Throw them in with the chicken. Turn down the heat so the fat under the chicken is gently fizzing, then add a little sea salt, cover the pan with a lid and leave to cook over a low to moderate heat. The time it takes to cook will depend on the thickness of your chicken joints, but expect them to need about 40 minutes. You will have to turn them during cooking so they colour on all sides. </p> <p>Meanwhile, pluck the leaves from the herbs and chop them roughly. Transfer the chicken to a serving dish or warm plates, then fish out the garlic (although the garlic has done its work, it may be tender and sweet and is worth adding to the plate, though the skin should be discarded at some point). Tip off most of the fat from the pan - what you are after is the golden, caramelised juice stuck to the bottom - then turn up the heat, pour in the wine and add the herbs and let it bubble. Scrape away at any stuck bits in the pan, encouraging them to dissolve into the wine with a wooden spoon. Let this all bubble away for a minute or two until you have a thin liquor. It should be pale and interesting. Now taste the juice for seasoning - it may need salt, pepper or a squeeze of lemon juice - and spoon it over the chicken. </p> <p> <strong> And more...</strong></p> <p><strong> A buttery finish </strong><br> Once the wine has bubbled down, whisk in a thick slice of butter (about 50g), cut into tiny cubes. Taste and spoon over the chicken. </p> <p> <strong> Or a creamy one </strong><br> Once you have removed the chicken from the pan and poured in your wine or vermouth, let it bubble away until you have only half of it left, then add about half as much cream. As it continues to bubble, stir in chopped parsley and slightly less chopped tarragon. Finish with salt, black pepper and a squeeze of lemon juice. </p> <p> <strong> Lamb with garlic and lemon </strong> <br>What works for a chicken thigh will also work for a lamb chop. Try the original idea but with chump chops and adding parsley and mint. Finish with the squeeze of a lemon. </p> <p> <strong> Pork chops with apple and cream </strong><br> Rib chops, with their generous marbling of integral fat (rather than a loin chop with its great wodge of fat running alongside the lean meat), are delectable cooked this way. You should let them colour well before turning down the heat, adding an apple or two, peeled and cut into small cubes, and letting it colour with the pork. When it is time to take out the meat, leave the apple be, then add the wine and let it simmer down a bit before pouring in a small pot of double cream. Stir, taking the sediment from the pan with you and dissolving it into the cream with your wooden spoon. Herbs are not really needed here, though the garlic is. I once crushed a few juniper berries, adding them after the meat and fruit had browned, to great effect. </p> <p> <strong> A no-fuss puff-pastry vegetable pie</strong> </p> <p> I have never understood why some people come over all sniffy about ready-made puff pastry. It is a perfectly good commercial product - light, crisp and a joy for people like me who imagine they have better things to do than make their own. (Shortcrust is different altogether because they never put enough butter in the commercial stuff and anyway, it's as easy as toast to make.) You can buy prepared puff pastry chilled or frozen and now made with butter instead of vegetable fat. But the best invention must be puff pastry that is ready rolled and cut to size. The sort that comes in a long, thin rectangle is the most useful of all - it can become a pie or a millefeuille in the time it takes you to find the rolling pin, though you might like to roll it just a tiny bit thinner, so it becomes even lighter and crisper. Enough for 4. </p> <p> <strong>5 medium-sized onions </strong><br> <strong>enough butter or oil to cover the bottom of a medium-sized shallow pan</strong> <br> <strong>350g of any firm variety of mushrooms, or a mixture </strong><br> <strong>chopped thyme, lemon thyme or oregano (just enough to sit in the palm of your hand)</strong><br> <strong>about 200g cr\u00e8me frache </strong> <br> <strong>425g puff pastry</strong> <br> <strong>a little beaten egg or milk to glaze the pastry </strong> </p> <p> Peel and roughly chop the onions and let them cook slowly with the butter or oil over a low heat for 20 minutes or so, until they are golden, soft and almost transparent. Tear or slice the mushrooms into large, bite-sized pieces and add them to the onions, adding a little more butter or oil if they soak it all up. Leave them to turn golden and tender but stir them from time to time so they do not stick and burn. Season them with the chopped herbs and stir in the cr\u00e8me frache, grinding in a little salt and pepper as you go. You want a mixture that is creamy rather than runny, so let it bubble for a minute or two to thicken. </p> <p>Heat the oven to 200 C/gas mark 6. The pastry needs to be rolled into two rectangles about 35cm by 20cm (conveniently the same measurements as the ready-rolled frozen stuff). Lay one piece on a lightly floured baking sheet and spread the mushrooms and onions over, leaving a good finger-thickness of bare rim around the edge. Brush a little beaten egg, milk or even water around the rim, lay the second rectangle of pastry over the top and squeeze the rims together to seal. It is worth being zealous about pinching the pastry - there shouldn't be any possibility of the filling escaping. Brush with more of the beaten egg or milk so the pastry will take on a rich golden shine in the oven, then cut a few little holes in the top to let out the steam. </p> <p>Bake the pie until it has puffed up like a cushion and is the colour of honey. This should take about 25 minutes. It is worth sneaking a look at the bottom to check if the pastry is crisp underneath (it should be fine, because this is not an especially wet filling). </p> <p> <strong> And more...</strong></p> <p> <strong>Some other good things </strong><br> There is magic, at least there is for me, in the bringing together of mushrooms, cream and puff pastry, but there are other fillings you can try here, too. </p> <p> <strong> A Gorgonzola and broccoli pie </strong><br> If broccoli ever seems just that bit too 'good for you', you can always take the smugness off its face by mixing it with cream and cheese. It works well in a pie like this in place of mushrooms. Cook the florets briefly, drain them, then fold them in with the onions and cr\u00e8me frache above. As we're lacking the savoury note of the mushrooms, I suggest some cheese - a blue, perhaps, such as a creamy Gorgonzola, a little Roquefort or Cashel Blue from Ireland. </p> <p> <strong> Garlic, cream and potato pie </strong><br> If you have any leftover pommes dauphinoise, I suggest you add a few softened onions and stuff it all between two sheets of pastry as in the pie above. I know potatoes in pastry sounds like a carbohydrate overdose but the effect is softened by the garlic-scented cream and buttery onions. Pushing your fork through golden, flaking pastry and slices of melting, cream-sodden potato is utter bliss. </p> <p> <strong> Pumpkin pie (but not that pumpkin pie) </strong><br> When I say pumpkin pie, I mean a savoury one with onions and cream, not the bland, over-rated tart that I have never managed to get the hots for. Peel a small pumpkin, cut it into chunks and roast with a generous amount of butter. When the golden flesh is soft and sweetly caramelised, add it to the softened onions above with the cr\u00e8me frache and a very little ground cinnamon. Pile it on to the pastry and top as usual. Great as a side dish for sausages. </p> <p> <strong> A thin, crisp fruit tart</strong> </p> <p> There are, I would venture, few more tempting sights than a baking tray of crisp, flaky fruit tarts fresh out of the oven. If you make your own pastry (and why not, if you have the time and the patience?), they will be sublime, but even with shop-bought puff pastry they are pretty fine. The trick is to roll the pastry as thin as you dare and bake them in a very hot oven. To get them at their most pleasurable, eat them warm, with cream or vanilla ice cream, so you get a mouthful of crisp, hot pastry, luscious fruit and cold ice cream all at once. Enough for 6. </p> <p><strong> 340g pack of defrosted puff pastry or a 425g pack of ready rolled </strong> <br> <strong>4 fairly tart dessert apples</strong> <br> <strong>a thick slice of butter, melted </strong> <br> <strong>a little caster sugar</strong> </p> <p> Get the oven really hot. I set mine at 230 C/ gas mark 8. Roll the pastry out as thin as you can without actually being able to see through it. If the tarts are to be crisp and flaky, the pastry should be no thicker than a pound coin. If you have bought ready-rolled puff pastry, then roll it out just a little more. </p> <p>Using a large saucer or small side plate as a template, cut out six discs of pastry. Using something smaller (a cup, say), score a slightly smaller circle within each one so you have a small rim. This will rise and hold in the apples. Slide the pieces of pastry on to a baking sheet, then prick the centre circles of pastry all over with a fork, which will stop them puffing up too much in the oven and throwing the apples off. </p> <p>Peel the apples, cut them into quarters and carve out their cores, then slice them thinly. Arrange the slices on the pastry discs (I like to do this in rather formal, overlapping circles). Brush the apples and pastry with melted butter, then dust them with a fine layer of sugar - anything more generous would make the tarts too sweet. Bake them until the pastry is golden and is fully crisp underneath, about 10 to 15 minutes. Cool slightly before eating. </p> <p> <strong> And more...</strong></p> <p><strong> Leftover pastry </strong><br> Parsimonious cooks will no doubt want to use the scraps of leftover pastry. My suggestion is to brush them with melted butter and dust them with grated Parmesan, then bake as above and eat while still hot and crisp. Frankly, I don't bother. We are only talking about a few scraps of pastry. </p> <p> <strong> A large apple tart </strong><br> There is something rather territorial about having your own fruit tart. If you prefer one large one to put on the table and cut up between your friends, then use one sheet of ready-rolled puff pastry, score a thin border around the edge, prick the centre and lay overlapping slices of apple, as thin as you can cut them, all over. Brush with melted butter, sprinkle with sugar and bake as above. </p> <p> <strong> A cheese and apple tart </strong><br> When you have brushed the tarts above with the butter, scatter a fine layer of finely grated Parmesan over them and bake as above. Neither a starter nor a pudding, this. More of a snack, really. </p> <p> <strong> Pear tarts </strong><br> Pears can produce the finest tarts of all, possessing a lusciousness that apples lack. The trick is to cook the fruit slightly beforehand so its flesh is soft and juicy. This is easy. Make up enough sugar syrup to cover the peeled, halved and cored pears (just put the pears in a pan, cover them with water and tip in a cupful of sugar), then simmer till they are tender to the point of a knife. Lift them out, drain them briefly, then slice thinly and overlap the slices on the pastry. Brush them with some of the sugar syrup, then bake as above. </p> <p> <strong> A banana tart </strong><br> Cut out and prick the tarts as above. Cut six bananas into slices as thick as pound coins, then divide them between the pastries. Brush them, and the pastry edges, with melted butter and sprinkle with sugar. After 10 minutes or so in the oven, brush the tarts with melted apricot jam, then return them to the oven for a few minutes more. Eat hot, offering everyone the cream jug or a ball of vanilla ice. </p> <p> <strong> Apricot tarts</strong><br> Crisp pastry and juicy fruit. Use tinned apricots, or halve, stone and poach some fresh ones in a little sugar and water. Drain them well, then lay them on the pastry, cut side up, and bake till the edges are just caught and the pastry crisp. Since they are so heavy with juice, you may find you need neither ice cream nor cream. They are rich enough as it is.</p> <p> Visit <a href=\"http://www.nigelslater.co.uk\">www.nigelslater.co.uk</a> - recipes are updated daily.</p>",
  "A few months ago I was on a news chat show with a reactionary pundit - Peter Hitchens, perhaps, or maybe Melanie Phillips, they all blur into one as I get older - and he or she was struck by the contrast between the decent British and the turbulent continentals. 'We remove our governments in free elections,' came the patriotic bellow. 'French presidents are brought down by mobs in the street.' <p>The line has since become a favourite charge against the European Union in our patriotic, foreign-owned press. It is probably useless to point out that no recent French government has been overthrown by revolutionary crowds. (Even General de Gaulle survived the student uprising of 1968. He resigned a year later after a bathetic defeat in a referendum on constitutional reform.) The supposedly docile British are far more incendiary. Striking miners lost Edward Heath the 1974 election as surely as the Winter of Discontent destroyed Jim Callaghan's chances in 1979. Poll-tax rioters and the refusal of millions to pay the hated charge persuaded the Tory Party to dump Margaret Thatcher. If you believe that Northern Ireland is part of the United Kingdom, and those on the Right who praise our passivity are quite adamant on this point, then you must admit that Britain has hosted a war which has taken 3,000 lives in the last 30 years and may not be over yet. No other Western European country has as many casualties of political violence. </p> <p>It is therefore conceivable that the fuel protesters will rip the guts out of the Government when their deadline runs out on 13 November. New Labour will have made concessions by then. But will a few pence off petrol tax or a cut in vehicle excise duty satisfy men drunk on the praise of William Hague and the Daily Mail ? Will they empty the roads again? Will a second blockade destroy Blair's reputation for competence? Will the gold Gordon Brown planned to stuff in the mouths of the electorate be wasted on deep cuts in fuel duty which will buy few votes if the oil cartel uses them as cover and raises its prices and profits? A wounded New Labour could stumble on like John Major's administration after the ERM disaster. Its nemesis would come on the day after the election when the voters awake to find William Hague in Downing Street, desperately hoping everyone has forgotten his promises to cut taxes and raise spending simultaneously. </p> <p>It could happen, but I suspect not. One of the pleasures of watching a culture which spends the national wealth of a medium-sized African country on probing public opinion is the joy of gloating at the failure of market researchers to second guess emotional surges. When Diana Spencer's car crashed, few predicted that millions would make fools of themselves by wailing for an aristocrat they had never met. The grieving process was embarrassingly brief. Moist newspaper supplements and TV specials were released to mark the first anniversary of the death 'that changed Britain for ever'. The readership and viewing figures were abysmal. Diana's mourners had dwindled into a small and rather sad cult. </p> <p>There are straws in the wind which suggest that the giddy roll from mass sympathy to indifference may hit the refinery protesters. Radio 5 Live is far better than any opinion poll at revealing the wisdom or alarming madness of your fellow citizens. During the blockade a large majority of callers were right behind direct action. The Fi Glover Show returned to the subject at the beginning of the month. David Handley, leader of Farmers for Action, the most militant group in the cheap-petrol lobby, was in the studio. He and everyone else was stunned by the near-unanimous abuse. 'You don't represent me.' 'You pocket my taxes.' 'I want to get to work/hospital/the children's day centre.' 'Who do you think you are?' 'Don't you dare do it again.' And the killer question: 'Why aren't you looking after your sheep?' </p> <p>The paradox of pro-car demonstrators stopping the motorists they claim to represent from using their cars cannot be hidden indefinitely. Last week the Government began its fightback and released hair-raising tales of intimidation of tanker drivers. More telling than the propaganda was a short statement from Chris Fox of the Association of Chief Police Officers. The indulgence officers granted hauliers and farmers, which amazed everyone who remembered the miners' strike, would be replaced by 'vigorous' policing, he said. This is a serious threat. As Lord Falconer and other New Labour lawyers have been whispering, Michael Howard and Jack Straw have ensured that the punishments for protest are now very vigorous indeed. </p> <p>It is not technically illegal to demonstrate in Britain. But if the police are out to get you, it can feel that way. Go on to oil refinery land and you can be arrested for aggravated trespass. Stand on the road outside, and charges for obstructing the highway can follow. Retire to the verge and prosecutors can use laws designed to stop misfits hounding celebs and arrest you for stalking. If you join a march of more than 20 people, you are legally obliged to do what the police tell you or face the consequences. If the oil companies get an injunction against you for restraining their trade, officers will act as their agents. The desire to turn protesters into criminals saturates the Home Office's Prevention of Terrorism Bill. Whitehall is modestly proposing that anyone who damages property, or merely discusses a plan to damage property, should be treated as a terrorist on a par with the Omagh bombers. </p> <p>These are the formal laws against robust dissent. An imaginative constabulary can deploy many others. Two weeks ago a man demonstrating against the digging of a quarry near the Neolithic Nine Ladies stone circle in Derbyshire sat on a dry-stone wall. It collapsed. Helpful officers ran over to check he was all right and then arrested him for criminal damage. </p> <p>The most powerful doctrine of our time is that nation states are powerless in the global market place. It ignores the efforts of one powerful nation state - America - to override all resistance to free trade and deregulated markets and misses the dependence of corporations on compliant politicians. National leaders can still make life uncomfortable for executives in their borders. The rumour going around Whitehall is that Blair has warned the oil companies that he will hit them with a long and burdensome inquiry into their anti-competitive practices if they don't try a little harder to get the petrol tankers moving next time. </p> <p>I can't see the future and don't know if the bickering petrol protesters will give us a next time. If they do, they may learn what trade unionists and greens have known for years. The ancient rights of the British to protest are as much a part of a flattering national myth as the notion that mobs only bring down Ministries in a sinister place called Abroad. </p> <p>Like the Child Support Agency before it, the National Criminal Records Agency is plodding towards its opening ceremony without anyone but a few nervous civil servants being troubled by visions of a bureaucratic hell. </p> <p>Its founding idea appeared as sensible as requiring feckless fathers to pay for the upkeep of their children. The Government would allow the police to disclose the criminal records of job applicants looking to work with children to employers. Paedophiles would be uncovered and everyone else would feel a great deal safer. </p> <p>Repressiveness has its own momentum, however. A justifiable invasion of privacy for the few looks like becoming a trap for the many. Ministers liked the idea of prying so much they decided everyone's criminal records should be opened. All applicants will have to reveal if their pasts were shady or pure. The new criminal records agency will be vetting 10 million people a year - say highest estimates - when it begins work in the summer. </p> <p>Snooping will deter the hiring of ex-offenders and leave them with no option but to return to their thieving ways - hardly an intelligent crime-fighting strategy - even if the agency manages to release accurate records efficiently. </p> <p>There are good grounds for wondering if it will manage that basic task. Earlier this year I wrote about a Metropolitan Police report on the reliability of criminal records, which Scotland Yard was anxious suppress. Officers examined a random selection, it said, and found an 'overall error rate of 86 per cent'. Eighty-five per cent of the these were 'major errors, i.e. those that could potentially lead to... the possibility of financial compensation awards to those affected'. </p> <p>Even if the figures are a freak and other police forces record keeping is far better than the Met's, hundreds of thousands of people will be denied work because of fictitious crimes on their files. They would then have every reason to sue the Home Office. As would employers if they were not warned about the previous of convicted frauds before entrusting them with money. </p> <p>Because this is New Labour, only a private company is deemed fit to run the agency. The winner of the contract was Capita plc. What is worrying the Home Office civil servants who watched private contractors freeze the computers of the Passport Office and asylum department is that Capita's own record is worthy of examination. The complaints about Capita's delays in processing housing benefit claims in South London, upheld by the Local Government Ombudsman, stand out starkly. </p> <p>I'm sorry to crystal-ball gaze again, but it is at least possible that employers won't be getting criminal records by return of post. Applicants may well be left in limbo and on the dole waiting for a file that may be libellously inaccurate.</p>",
  "As a late sun stroked the last of this year's cotton, like billows of man-made clouds, old Ruby Walker sat on her porch with most of her 22 cats frolicking around her. The next few days will be particularly hard for the Walker family, since they were to have marked the nineteenth birthday of Ruby's granddaughter, Sandra Handy. However, there will be a different anniversary: 'She was just crossing the railroad line on her way home this time last year, when the shooting started and a bullet hit her right in the head.' There is a macabre intimacy to the murder. Ruby gestures towards the house behind her: 'It was their boy done the shooting. He only got 10 years and it's hard to look at them every day. He was, she adds, 'one of the gangbangers - fighting for territory'. <p>This is not the Bronx or Southside Chicago - this is a rural hamlet called Coahoma on the Mississippi reaches, in the heart of the Delta, an area which a nearby Pastor, Benny Brown, calls 'not a \"rural area\" but more of a reservation. A black poverty reservation.' </p> <p>'Reservation' is an apposite description of the poverty hidden from view, hidden from politicians, from those surfing the economic boom and hidden from America's presence in the world. </p> <p>They are deep wells of apparently irredeemable poverty, a dark side of the America which preens itself in front of the mirror with each jump of the Nasdaq and every State of the Union speech and offers itself to the planet in chat shows, mini series, and tales of dotcom billionaires in business magazines. This is an America which will never make even a cameo appearance on Friends or a footnote in Forbes or Business Week . </p> <p>While there is appalling poverty among white people in some places, these reservations are for the most part territory into which whites dare not venture and would not think to venture. In Coahoma, a little girl approaches my photographer: 'Sir, are you a white man?' </p> <p>'Do I look white?' he replies. </p> <p>'I guess,' she says. 'Is your friend a white man too?' </p> <p>This year's cotton is almost in, packed into great bales of white that dot the vast flatscape of the Delta, rising from the rich earth of 'Cotton Kingdom'. There are still a few fields left and loose cotton still blows across the earth and roads like a light, fluffy blizzard. </p> <p>But what the hell. The end of the accursedly dry Southern summer, and of the cotton harvest, is no time for celebration in these communities around the town of Clarksdale. Forty per cent of people here survive below the poverty line, which is set at $16,000 for a family of four. With the summer work now gone, the onset of Fall only serves to remind those who watch the seasons come and go from their porches and roadside perches that whatever the rhetoric from those now campaigning to become the next President of the United States, the reality will almost certainly pass them by: that theirs is the land that politics forgot; that as the sound and fury of the election increases, with only a fortnight to go, their 'reservation' is the price paid for the economic boom on which the election rides. </p> <p>The boom economy is the toast of a contemporary America, awash with money that has enriched not only the wealthy and superwealthy but a burgeoning middle class. The toast, too, of America's presidential election with both candidates debating how to spend the most lavish budget surplus in the country's history. </p> <p>George Bush's appeal is a brazen one: a windfall for those he sees as having generated the wealth - the rich and super-rich, with gestures of reward to the middle strata. Al Gore tried to make his central pledge to 'working families' but has been obliged to let the term slip from his lexicon of late, in favour of 'the middle class'. </p> <p>The fact is that there is little or no political capital to be gained by fighting for the votes of the poor in America, since - for the most part - the poor do not vote. But they exist: the underbelly is always there, either prop ping up the system or consuming its welfare dollars, whichever way you look at it; an underbelly that swells along with the wastelands where it lives, trapped in its own economic hex, out of sight and largely out of mind. </p> <p>In Mississippi, at the last Presidential election, only 33 per cent voted; in Coahoma County, even fewer. Around Clarksdale, people pay Washington as little mind as Washington pays to Clarksdale. </p> <p>When President Clinton came to office there was a grandiose plan to reform healthcare - which fell by the wayside. There was an 'initiative on race' entrusted to a special panel kept on such a tight rein that its members could not say what they wanted to say. Finally came the 'welfare reform' of 1996 which removed tens of thousands from the benefits rolls and sent them into jobs they often lost within weeks either through ineptitude or inability to live the working life. </p> <p>Clarkesdale is the epicentre of that which in eighteenth-century England was called the 'Blue Devils', adapted by plantation-speak during the 1890s to 'the Blues'. It is the town in which the famous 'Crossroads' is located at which the master of all bluesmen, Robert Johnson, is said to have sold his soul to the Devil in exchange for his wizardry on the guitar. The old Negro lore has it that the musician must 'take a black cat bone and a guitar and go to a lonely fork in the road at midnight'. The guitarist will soon be joined by an 'unseen musician' who will 'play in perfect unison' before taking his instrument away from him - although the sound will continue until our guitarist's fingertips bleed. 'The music,' runs the legend, 'will eventually subside, and when all is quiet, you may go home. You will be able to play any piece you desire on the guitar, but you will have sold your eternal soul and are his in the world to come.' The crossroads is that between Highway 61, which splices America in two, north-south, and Highway 49 - now marked by a bricked-up, former laundromat. </p> <p>It was on a farm called Hopson, now site of an annual blues festival, that another Devil claimed many souls in Clarksdale: the first mechanical cotton-picking machine, which led to the mechanisation of the plantations, and began the great migrations north that in turn created the ghettoes of Chicago, Detroit, Washington, New York and Boston. </p> <p>And Clarksdale is also the Delta town through which Bill Clinton blew like a hurricane during his 'Poverty Tour' of July last year, in the footsteps of a similar journey made by Bobby Kennedy in 1967. There was a meeting with the locals in a flower store called 'Ooh So Pretty Flowers' managed by Shirley Fair, who has a collection of thick photo albums and likes the President because he 'cares about poor folks'. But, she says: 'Nothing has gotten any better. There's nothing here to grasp on to. The railroad is closed, the factories have gone. The good folks move on and the gangbangers take over the streets and that makes it harder for businesses to survive. The President wrote me a letter saying I could apply for a grant and employ 10 people. But there were so many rules and regulations I couldn't understand nothing. Always something to slow you and stop you. So I did.' </p> <p>The President had actually wanted to visit another place just north of Clarksdale, a much smaller rural community called Jonestown, but his spin doctors advised him against it - for reasons that become immediately apparent when one pulls into Main Street, whose sign lies on a scrap of grass next to an empty beer bottle. </p> <p>The approach to us here is a little different from that in Coahoma. In response to the first whites within living memory to buy beer and pecan nuts at the Deer Park grocery, a man with a hood over his head forms a pretend gun barrel with his index and middle fingers, flicks off the (thumb) safety catch and opens fire, with recoil. For the most part, however, a smile and some heartfelt respect meets nothing but hospitality and a return grin in places to which those above the poverty line never go. </p> <p>There is portrait of John F. Kennedy painted on one of the boarded-up store fronts - the paint is faded, the glass is smashed. The few businesses left open hide behind grills. </p> <p>Jonestown's mayor is also the town's Pentecostal Pastor, a pensive man and disarmingly honest about his isolation from power politics and the magnitude of his task, to the edge of hopelessness - but not over it. 'This was,' says Mayor Joe Phillips, 'a thriving rural community 20 years ago - the employment was farm labour - then came mechanisation, and people moved away. Then the whites left, and took the businesses with them. The buildings became dilapidated and fell in'. </p> <p>To try to stave off this decay, 'money is occasionally promised to the community,' says Phillips, from both federal and state funds. 'But when it is promised, it gets expended elsewhere. It always seems to disappears some place else, it doesn't get filtered down. They'll say that \"administration costs\" count for 30 per cent.' Why? 'Politics,' he replies simply. 'That's the bottom line. You can't just wait for things to happen. We are saying that to do anything, we have go to do it with private funding and we have got to do it ourselves'. </p> <p>Phillips's calling is, he says, to 'instill in people's minds that they can become self-sufficient, and dignified. Otherwise they are going to end up breaking up, tearing up. But I guess,' he adds, as though uttering some personal confession, 'that it's very solitary work. Very isolated. People stay away from you so that when you get hit, they won't feel the results. But I've always believed in the impossible; Jesus said: \"bring the blind man unto me, that he may see\".' </p> <p>The forecourt of the Deer Park Grocery is a gathering place for those wrenched from the land by the new demands of the 'Cotton Kingdom': a ragbag of gang fighters and those 'breaking up, tearing up', and their daytime lady friends, under the watchful eye of the sheriff's deputy. Or just people who may be heading that way, like Albert Mitchell. 'I always worked the farm,' says Albert, 'but now all the work is seasonal. The harvest is in, and you get cut. When I'm working, I don't drink. But when I'm not working you get jack shit to live on; I do a bit of plumbing and I drink. So now my wife is throwing me out, with the kids and all that.' </p> <p>Also among the company is Juliet Shaw, holding her baby - one of two, though she is only 18. She lives on the welfare payments for which young women like her are infamous and an easy target for political polemic, like most of the mothers at a Montessori school run by a Roman Catholic mission in the town centre. The nuns arrived in the building, a crack den, on 6 January 1993, and by 11 January the children had begun to arrive. 'Some of them,' says Sister Theresa Shields, watching basketball practice, 'go back to wonderful homes - others to appalling, abusive ones.' As she speaks, a car pulls out, blaring loud rap music: 'See You In Hell, Motherfucker!'. </p> <p>Not everyone in Jonestown is either locked in struggle or downcast by melancholia. Indeed, as he hobbles with his stick down a lazy, sunny street, it seems that nothing under the Delta sky could wipe the smile off Willie Gilbert's face. Willie was a truck driver earning reasonable money until a wheel crashed down on his ankle during a tyre change eight years ago. He doesn't find it easy to get by on his $500-a-month disability pension, but has adopted his own approach: 'eat slow'. And while eating slow,he looks back on his life: 'Now how many children I got? Got a whole bunch of 'em. Woulda had 29 if they'd all lived. Got 11 by one woman. Got two in California, boys. Got one in Washington DC. Don't know how many grandchildren...' But for one of his neighbours, memories of sweet times only make the present bitter. As Walhida sits on her porch, flies feast on the infected, weeping sore above her right eye. </p> <p>As ever in the Mississippi Delta, the greater the tribulations of this world, the more people cling to the promise of the next. Benny Brown peeps out from behind the hatch of the little kiosk caf\u00e9 he keeps on Main Street, selling 'Hog's Maws' and 'Chicken Gizzards'. Benny talks through his spectacles and between orders about 'poverty pockets' and 'reservations, weighing up the 'pre-King' and 'post-King' epochs on the Delta plains, and of the trade-off between the winning of civil rights and the loss of any kind of opportunity in the comfortless rural ghettoes that followed in their wake, embittering - and mocking - the sweetness of victory. On those 'reservations', Benny sees a 'vicious cycle' of 'poverty which creates problems that only deepen the problems further' - 'an influx of drugs, alcohol and crime'. Benny has his own view on how the cycle has to be broken and accordingly invites us to a Bible study class. </p> <p>A misty dusk - illuminated by a fat, low golden moon - settles on the ploughed plantation fields, as Benny hoists a man called Rickie out of his car, onto a wheelchair and up the ramp of the little white slatwood church that stands alone. 'Wherever there are churches,' says Benny, 'there were communities. Now they have gone'. The preacher is Brother Stevens, who looks a blend of Richie Havens and Rasputin, and the scripture for study tonight - after a prayer of invocation sung with passion and volume and interrupted with cries of 'Halleluiah! and 'Oh Yes!' - is the seventh chapter in the Book of Ecclesiastes. 'The heart of fools is in the house of pleasure... If you the poor are oppressed in a district / And justice and rights are denied / Do not be surprised by such things / For one official is eyed by a higher one / And over them both are others higher still'. </p> <p>Benny invites the meeting to recall Clinton's visit, and how 'many of us saw the motorcade go by - but is it any better now?' No, the company agrees. 'We can expect nobody to help us from outside,' says Benny, 'Look for change from within. From within yourself, and from within your community.' </p> <p>Not all of Benny Brown's reservations are black, of course. Many are Hispanic, along the border towns of Texas, Arizona and California, where squads of white vigilantes now take the law and their semi-automatic guns into their own hands. The native, first Americans occupy the dustiest and most comfortless acres of land to which they were dispatched a century and a half ago. And there are, in their way, white reservations too - in Appalachia and across the vast prairies and plains, but it is in the South and in particular the black South with its legacy of slavery and segregation (the Confederate flag is still proudly stitched into that of the state of Mississippi) that 'poverty pockets' are at their worst. There is a 'New South' to be sure: with its dynamic capital of Atlanta and a formidable Attorney General in Mississippi, Mike Moore, who is prising open the sealed secrets of crimes by the Ku Klux Klan, lynchings and church burning in the 1960s, to win a string of convictions. </p> <p>But the depth of poverty in black Mississippi remains, frankly, shocking. The Centres for Disease Control in Atlanta has reported, in the past few months, serious clusters of diabetes, hepatitis and Aids around poor communities, where some 40 per cent of the population lives below the poverty line. </p> <p>Back in Jonestown, the night is young, and as it falls one realises that Benny and his fellow-churchgoers are engaged in a state of what is, for them, apocalyptic war. Down at the Club Sugar - a ramshackle brick cabin beside the railroad track - those parking cars are invited by the girls if they want to 'have a little fun tonight'. Lads like 'Q', with his blue bandanna, are arriving to drown their sorrows and thoughts in the barrage of rap music while his friend 'Icy Man', although in the middle of a conversation, pulls hard on a tube of 'rocks', his eyes glazing over, his face frozen in oblivion. Mayor Phillips had warned how 'the drug pushers have been pushed out of the bigger towns and are now targeting the little ones. And the more they come, the more we get break-ins, prostitution.' </p> <p>It's like finding the old Seventies Bronx in the middle of a twenty-first century cotton plantation and the crowd soon moves to a joint nearer the village centre, Hot Spot. We ask if we can take pictures of the heaving and dancing, to be told politely that this would be a 'bad idea because a lot of the guys here are wanted'. The guys accordingly hit the floor as the girls shake their stuff - only for the festivities to be abruptly brought to a close by the sudden and robust entry of a posse of (very white) police officers. 'They're serious,' says our host, Clee - who dislikes rap and who dreams mainly of setting up a blues band in town - 'they're not local, they're County'. </p> <p>On a street that runs adjacent to the Sunflower River through Clarksdale, there's a ramshackle but precious hotel with a history to tell that encapsulates all the pain and emotion of Benny Brown's 'poverty pocket'. The Riverside Hotel dates from the days when blacks were not allowed to stay in 'white' hotels; it is where singer Bessie Smith was taken to die; it's where the blues masters stayed and now where the labourers - the 'weeklies' - live, and where the blues pilgrims, mostly from overseas, come to visit. </p> <p>The joint is run by 'Rat' Cliffe, son of the lady who opened it and the wisest guy in town, now in his seventies. 'It's something like folks want to stay poor around here,' says Rat impatiently, working his spindly fingers around his cigarette end. 'Up there in Tunica they build casinos. But they wouldn't have 'em here - politics and the churches. In other places you got people wanting to work for themselves, like in Chicago, do something, get a sense of pride. But here, you know what has killed this place?' And here is a surprise from a man at the heart of the black community. 'Welfare. It stops people working. Why should a man go all the way to Tunica to work 40 hours a week and 10 hours travelling for $600 a month if he can get that from the welfare? Why go to work as a young woman when you can get paid just for having babies?' </p> <p>The sun is now low in the evening sky over the cotton fields outside Ruby Walker's home; the cats savouring the last of the heat. Ruby's grandparents were slaves working these cotton fields; 'And so was I, after a fashion,' she reflects. 'We worked from sun up to sundown, and the money was cheap.' Her daughter Mary became the fifth cotton-picking generation until she found work in a local school. But, adds Ruby, the furrows deepening across her brow: 'I sometimes wonder if they ever really did do away with slavery. I don't know what's happening round here no more. All I know is it was better in the Forties than it is now'.</p>",
  "Place Vend\u00f4me in the centre of Paris is a vile and soulless octagon, where the French fetish for symmetry and the banal expression of hard wealth come together in an unholy alliance. <p>There's no place here for softening trees or anything that might grow disorderly. The fa\u00e7ade of the Ministry of Justice at number 13 includes a marble metre, installed there in 1795 so the French people could get used to that surpassingly rational unit of measurement. </p> <p>Jewellers and bankers the likes of which you and I will never patronise thrive here, as does the Ritz Hotel. It's from there Di and Dodi set off on their fatal drive three years ago. </p> <p>Most nights, though, a very different social group can be found in this exclusive quarter. Homeless men curl up on the grate of a huge air vent - the down and nearly out surviving on the free hot air of the super rich. There'll be a lot more of them gathering there in the months to come, as the temperatures fall and the homelessness agencies in Paris become overrun. </p> <p>Last week Le Monde reported an alarming rise in the number of homeless people in central Paris. At the start of this month, according to government figures, 3,800 people took advantage of emergency beds - 1,500 more than at this time last year. </p> <p>Much of the rise is due to asylum seekers who are overwhelming the agencies entrusted with finding them accommodation. Between January and the end of September, 29,000 refugees asked for help with accommodation, compared with 31,000 during the whole of 1999. As a result, the Centre for the Welcome of Asylum Seekers has turned to agencies supplying emergency beds to homeless people in Paris for support. But these groups themselves are struggling to keep up. </p> <p>'We've never faced a situation as bad as this,' said Alain Raillard, secretary general of the Emmana's agency, one of six groups that tries to help people sleeping rough in Paris. 'If the winter is hard, we will not be able to respond to homeless people's needs,' said Patrick Herv\u00e9, director general of another organisation, La Mie de Pain. </p> <p>From 1 December, only 300 more emergency beds will be available compared with last year. If the weather gets really cold, there are plans to make hospital beds available to people sleeping rough. </p> <p>What's most striking for me, just arrived from London, is the juxtaposition of monumental Parisian elegance and order alongside this human misery. Paris is a city where the grass is manicured and the pavements hosed down almost lovingly. It's a city that works, and so the fact that it can't cope with its homelessness problem seems more shocking. </p> <p>In London, I'd become desensitised to the clamour of street people. In Paris, for the moment, it's harder to do that. </p> <p>The abject monologues of beggars in M\u00e9tro carriages still make me shudder - these people have to narrate their miseries to win their daily bread? And my romantic illusions of an evening stroll along the Seine have been shattered by finding a makeshift shelter under the Passerelle des Arts bridge. </p> <p>What's also surprising is that so many different nationalities are sleeping rough here. In London you don't see many black people underneath the arches, still less whole families. But here refugees from francophone Africa, Czechs, Poles, Afghans and peoples from the various nations that made up the former Yugoslavia, form little communities around their fires long after the bateaux-mouches have turned off their floating searchlights for the evening. </p> <p>Meanwhile, among the most privileged Parisians there's a new trend - fur is fashionable again. Last week, the French Communist Party headquarters played host to a party for Italian clothes designers Prada, a soir\u00e9e at which fur coats outnumbered historical materialists by at least two to one. </p> <p>Just off Place Vend\u00f4me, Brentana the furrier is doing a brisk trade. There's a particularly fetching chinchilla coat in the window for only \u00a35,800. Perhaps if the heating vents don't prove warming enough this winter, some of the people sleeping rough in the Place Vend\u00f4me might ask if they could borrow it for the night.</p>",
  "It is one of the most surreal yet symbolic scenes of the post-war Balkans. Every night a faint glow can be seen through the windows of the great, unfinished Serbian Orthodox Cathedral in the centre of Pristina, the capital of Kosovo. <p>But the gentle light comes not from candles, ghosts or angels. Inside the church is a large tent. And inside the tent are three Royal Marines commandos. If you come at the right time, they will all be sitting on their sofa clutching mugs of tea and watching EastEnders. A fourth will be outside keeping guard, making sure the church is not razed by Kosovo's Albanians who see it as a symbol of a past and a people they hate. </p> <p>Three weeks after Slobodan Milosevic fell from power, and a week before Kosovo's Albanians cast their votes in their first internationally supervised free election, everything and nothing has changed here. While there is little doubt British troops will be watching EastEnders and protecting Kosovo's Serbian churches and churchgoers for years to come, it is also clear the events in Belgrade have altered the political landscape. </p> <p>Sixteen months ago, at the end of the Kosovo war, as 850,000 Kosovo Albanian refugees streamed home in the wake of Nato's victory, Kosovo's independence seemed imminent. But, now, with the rehabilitation of Serbia's image at the fall of Milosevic, the international community's sympathy for Kosovo's Albanians is over. </p> <p>Their leaders were dismayed at Milosevic's fall. Hashim Thaci, ex-leader of the guerrilla Kosovo Liberation Army, says: 'I fought for democracy in Kosovo - not for democracy in Serbia!' </p> <p>Across the street from the Serbian Orthodox Cathedral is the office of Pleurat Sejdiu. During the dark days of Serbian repression he sought asylum in Britain where he drove a minicab. When the war began in 1998, he emerged as the KLA's spokesman in London. Now he shares the job of Kosovo's Minister of Health in the United Nation's administration. 'What happened in Belgrade is good for Serbs but neither good nor bad for others,' he says. </p> <p>Others say Vojislav Kostunica, Yugoslavia's new President, is a Serbian nationalist just like Milosevic. A picture of him holding a Kalashnikov in Kosovo is proof, say Albanian newspapers, that he was a paramilitary leader. There is no evidence of this and Kostunica says the gun was thrust into his hands during a visit. </p> <p>But there is little doubt that when Kostunica has consolidated his power, probably after Serbia's elections on 23 December, he will turn his attention to Kosovo. </p> <p>UN Security Council Resolution 1244 may have sealed Serbia's defeat, but it did specify that, pending a resolution of its final status, Kosovo remained part of Yugoslavia. It also said that at a certain, unspecified time 'hundreds' of Yugoslav and Serbian 'personnel' would be allowed to return to Kosovo. </p> <p>So, Kosovo's leaders have been looking on with increasing horror as they see Kostunica courted by Western leaders as diplomats dust down old plans for a federation or confederation of Serbia, Montenegro and Kosovo. 'There will be no links with Serbia in any confederation,' says Sejdiu, 'end of story.' </p> <p>But it will not be the end. Bernard Kouchner, the Frenchman who runs the UN's Kosovo administration, is clearly not relishing the day when Kostunica wants to visit again. 'OK, welcome!' he says. 'But, we would have to organise that in terms of security, so it is a bit premature. But the idea is not stupid. It is really a question of time.' </p> <p>As the Kosovo Albanians go to the polls, this is not what they want to hear. But their leaders have no policies, except independence, about which they all agree. While Serbia's politicians look to the future, Kosovo's poll is about who did what during the war and the last 10 years. </p> <p>Kosovo's Albanian leadership will have to think of a more sophisticated strategy to deal with Serbia than it has had until now. </p> <p> Tim Judah is the author of 'Kosovo: War and Revenge' published by Yale University Press</p>",
  "<p>Trailers for blockbusters inevitably feature only the highlights: the dramatic moments, the belly laughs, the climaxes, the stars shown to best effect. So perhaps it is appropriate that the strike by actors in the United States running since May Day should have impinged on public consciousness mainly as a series of highlights and big names. </p> <p>There have been the scenes with the world's best golfer and best basketball player. There has been the bare-breasted woman and the Devil. </p> <p>A dispute over pay for actors doing commercials has cost them collectively an estimated $1 million a day, driven advertisers to film in Canada, South Africa, Mexico and Australia, and caused great bitterness between the symbiotic worlds of corporate America and the entertainment industry. But this strike, however lengthy and acrimonious, is only a trailer because the main feature, opening next summer, will not be about the subsidiary matter of commercials but threatens to shut down the entire film and television industry for months. </p> <p>But first strikes first. The Screen Actors' Guild and the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists called the current strike nearly six months ago to stop advertisers from altering their pay structure, by which they receive both a fee and 'residuals', payments made whenever a commercial in which the actor appears is reshown. </p> <p>The unions argue that with only 1.4 per cent of the $400 billion spent annually on advertising going to the actors, the employers can well afford to retain the existing method of payment. The advertisers claim that with the growth of cable television and the internet the system of residuals is unworkable. They want a simple one-fee system that they claim would leave the actors better off. </p> <p>The actors had hoped the strike would be short and sweet. In fact, it has been long and bitter. Part of the bitterness has been over the lack of coverage the dispute has received, only attracting national attention when someone famous is involved in it. </p> <p>Last week it was Liz Hurley. In July, she had made a commercial for Est\u00e9e Lauder in breach of the strike. She has issued profuse and sincere apologies - 'more mea culpas than a penitent at Lourdes', as Variety put it - explaining that she was unaware that she was strike-breaking. She has just made a $25,000 donation to the strikers and sent a formal letter of apology, but she is still to be summoned to explain herself. </p> <p>There is no reason to doubt her word that it was an honest error, but this did not stop supporters of the strike from picketing the premiere of her new film Bedazzled in Los Angeles last Tuesday with signs reading 'Elizabeth Scably, U Make Me Hurl' and 'Beauty Fades, Honor Doesn't' and scrawling 'scab' over publicity posters. (The film is a remake of the 1967 Stanley Donen film Bedazzled, which starred Peter Cook as the Devil.) </p> <p>The row over Est\u00e9e Lauder gave the strike the prominence for a day or two that it has been able to achieve only fleetingly in similar incidents. When the commercials arm of RSA USA, British directors Ridley and Tony Scott's film company, ran a tasteless ad of an elderly, bare-breasted South African woman proclaiming that 'this is what SAG means in South Africa', and encouraging advertisers to shift film production to that country, all hell broke loose. The unions and many others were outraged. Neither Scott had known anything of the ad and were just as furious; the people responsible have since taken the long walk. When Tiger Woods made a car commercial and basketball star Shaquille O'Neal made a Disneyland ad, they were asked to explain themselves. Woods was unaware that by filming in Canada he was strike-breaking; O'Neal gave his fee to charity. </p> <p>Equally, when stars have made appearances at rallies or donations to the strike there has been a flurry of coverage. Paul Newman, Richard Dreyfuss, Julia Roberts, Susan Sarandon, Tim Robbins, Jason Robards, Tom Hanks and the cast of Frasier have all featured prominently in support of the strike. Last week it was John Travolta and Kelly Preston putting $25,000 in the kitty, and previous donors like Nicolas Cage ($200,000), Kevin Spacey, Helen Hunt and Harrison Ford (all $100,000) have all helped to keep the hardship fund going. But then this is an odd strike in that many of those at the low-paid end of the acting trade already survive by serving at tables, driving cabs and making jewellery. </p> <p>Advertisers have been holding out, using non-union actors, crossing the border to film, resorting to old ads. The balance of power is not the same as for a normal strike - the advertisers are not losing money, as a car manufacturer or bus company would be; the only hardship is that their executives do not get to have their photos taken with famous actors who do ads for them.Talks have now resumed in New York and there are hopeful signs emerging. But next year's strike is the blockbuster. It will involve both actors and writers. This dispute is also over contracts signed by the actors' and writers' unions which are up for renewal next year - for the Writers' Guild of America on 1 May, for SAG on 1 July - and it is also over how people are reimbursed for work on cable and internet. </p> <p> <strong> WHAT IS PUZZLING</strong> to many outside the industry is that the dispute is now regarded as inevitable and studios are frantically squirrelling away productions. People are accepting less than perfect terms for less than perfect scripts because they know that bad times are just around the corner. </p> <p>The writers are also being told to prepare for a big stoppage. A newsletter to members warns: 'Now is not the time to be buying the biggest house or the nicest car you can afford. If you have a TV staff writing job, begin putting money away now. If you make a feature deal, bank every penny you can.' </p> <p>This may seem like an American problem, but the American entertainment industry is now the world's entertainment industry. Of the top grossing films in Japan last week, nine were American, as was the case in Mexico and Spain. An all-out strike will make ripples all over the world. </p> <p>At the party after the opening of Bedazzled in Los Angeles last week, part of the entertainment was a woman dwarf flagellating a man on a rack. So far, the actors and writers have not yet applied the screws, but someone is going to be on the rack by next summer. </p> <p> <strong>And what they said about Liz's new film...</strong></p> <p> VARIETY: 'A wickedly witty performance... a lip-smacking, feline caricature of Joan Collins. Hurley takes an almost unholy delight in her own naughtiness, and her saving grace is her generosity: she permits the audience to have even more fun than she does.'</p> <p>NEW YORK TIMES: 'Ms Hurley struts through her role with insouciant glee; her performance is a sneaky tribute to Mr [Peter] Cook's arch-English naughtiness, even as her get-up recalls Raquel Welch's cameo in the original film as the incarnation of lust.' </p> <p>SALON: 'It might not measure up to the 1967 original, but now Satan's got sooty pussycat eyes and a kitten-cruel smile... You couldn't come up with a more perfect Luciferess than Elizabeth Hurley... a gleam in her eye that signals she's up for any kind of mischievous high jinks... It doesn't hurt that Hurley is pure pleasure to look at, pulling off one scrumptious visual joke after another.'</p>",

  "As far as the world was concerned, Beck Weathers was dead, another fatality in the worst climbing tragedy on Everest. <p>Vicious winds and bone-numbing cold had closed around the mountain while Weathers and his companions struggled down from the summit. Lost and exhausted, he apparently succumbed to hypothermia, his body lying exposed on the South Col at more than 26,000ft. </p> <p>Over the next 24 hours, a mountain guide and then a doctor checked on his condition. Both pronounced Weathers, a Texan pathologist, beyond salvation. Nobody had ever woken from a hypothermic coma before, especially at high altitude. His wife was told; the mourning began. Then something amazing happened. Weathers woke up. </p> <p>Four years on, at his Dallas home, he shifts his weight in his armchair with what remains of his arms and smiles slowly. 'I've been a story-teller all my life,' he says, 'it's just I never had a story before. Now I've got a dandy.' </p> <p>But despite his terrible injuries that saw him lose parts of his arms, face and foot, Weathers is happier than ever. 'For the first time in my life I have peace,' he says. 'I no longer seek to define myself externally, through goals and achievements and material possessions. For the first time I'm comfortable in my own skin.' </p> <p>Because while what he suffered on Everest has ended his climbing career, it has helped him overcome the suicidal depression that dogged him for much of his adult life. His terrifying ordeal began on 10 May 1996. As part of New Zealand mountain guide Rob Hall's expedition, Weathers had sunk around $65,000 into climbing Everest, the biggest and hardest challenge in his ambition of reaching the top of the highest peak on each of the seven continents. </p> <p>At 49, he was one of the older climbers that season. He had staked a great deal on getting to the top - his 20-year marriage to Peach, the affection of his children, even his life - but he seems hardly to have been conscious of that. A genial, wise-cracking front masked deep insecurity; he did not just want to climb Everest, he needed to. </p> <p>Looking down at the suburbs of Dallas from the air, you get a sense of where his mental illness and the obsession it spawned originated. As in the opening scene of American Beauty, each leafy street seems the same as the last, secure, insulated, ordinary. Weathers enjoyed the material comforts his successful career afforded him, loved his family, but for long periods felt utterly bereft. </p> <p>'Depression was a controlling aspect of my life,' he says. 'I got pretty suicidal for a while, to the extent that it was scaring the hell out of me.' He sought escape in a string of obsessions, everything from CB radio to sailing. 'The one thing that did help was driving my body to extremes. If you're working yourself hard physically, it gives you this wonderful sense of drawing into yourself and all the problems of your existence disappear. Climbing became a very logical extension of that.' </p> <p>Before the storm, setting off from their high camp on the South Col, Weathers was close to fulfilling his ultimate obsession. The weather was clear, he and his team-mates were hopeful. As they shuffled off into the night, crampons squeaking on the snow and ice, they faced a 12- or 14-hour climb to the summit. But Weathers was destined not to make it there. </p> <p>Before leaving for Nepal, he had undergone a radial keratotomy, effectively tiny incisions in his corneas, to correct his short-sightedness. At altitude, however, his adapted corneas changed shape, leaving him half-blind in the darkness. He was forced to move off the trail and watch as his companions traipsed past toward the summit. He was not beaten. Weathers figured that with bright sunlight his iris would close to protect his retina and give him an immense depth-of-field, bypassing the cornea problem. So it proved, but in wiping his fuzzy eyes, he had scratched an ice crystal across his right cornea, leaving it blurred. Although his left eye worked fine, he had no depth perception, a real handicap on such dangerous terrain. </p> <p>Hall forbade him from going higher, and instructed him to stay put until he returned. 'Cross my heart, hope to die,' he promised Hall. But Hall did not return, instead becoming marooned close to the summit with Doug Hansen, a Seattle postal worker who was too weak to make it down. Despite being encouraged to abandon Hansen, Hall stayed put, dying the following evening. </p> <p>When Hall had left him, at a little after 7.30am, Weathers waited patiently throughout the day for his return, refusing offers from climbers going down the mountain to join them. But by 5pm he knew something was wrong. Jon Krakauer, who later wrote Into Thin Air, the best-selling account of that season on Everest, reached Weathers on his way down from the summit. He told Weathers that Hall was stuck on the summit ridge. Weathers knew now that he should go down, but refused Krakauer's offer of help. He elected instead to wait for another guide from his team, Mike Groom, who helped Weathers scramble down to the South Col as part of a group of weary stragglers destined to endure an appalling night in the open. </p> <p>Close to their tents and safety, the afternoon storm now swelled, clouds boiled over the South Col and the wind thundered. One climber described it as like being lost in a bottle of milk. Disoriented, confused and desperate, the small huddle of climbers almost walked off the edge of the mountain looking for the camp. In the process, Weathers lost his right glove, his hand freezing instantly. Exhausted, and with a huge drop ahead of them, the climbers hunkered down, waiting for a break in the clouds and the chance of rescue. </p> <p>By the time it came, Weathers was beyond salvation. As his companions watched in horror, he stood up against the raging wind, his arms outstretched, his naked right hand frozen solid, like a joint of meat. Standing on the South Col in the middle of the night, deranged with hypothermia and hypoxia (oxygen deficiency in body tissues), he was dying. </p> <p>'I've got this all figured out,' he shouted, before the wind toppled him from his feet and he disappeared into the maelstrom, apparently for ever. His friends were rescued by Anatoli Boukreev, but the Russian guide judged Weathers already dead. Next morning, Canadian doctor Stuart Hutchinson and three Sherpas went out searching for Weathers and a Japanese woman, Yasuko Namba, who had also been left behind the night before. </p> <p>Namba was barely alive and Hutchinson had to peel a carapace of ice from her face to examine her. There was, he judged, nothing to be done; Namba's skin was porcelain white, her eyes dilated. Moving on to Weathers, now partially buried in snow, Hutchinson saw the stiff right arm frozen above his head, the jacket opened to the waist, the ice-encrusted face and judged the man in front of him as 'being as close to death and still breathing' as any patient he had seen. </p> <p>The news was released that Weathers was gone. Then, at around 4pm, the miracle occurred. 'I was so far gone in terms of not being connected to where I was,' he says. 'There was a nice, warm, comfortable sense of being in my bed. It was really not unpleasant.' </p> <p>Disorientated by the white clouds and snow, his ungainly arm gave him something to focus on. He banged it against the ground. It sounded like wood. With adrenaline seeping through his system, he began to grasp his predicament. 'This was not bed. This was not a dream,' he says. 'This was real and I'm starting to think: I'm on the mountain but I don't have a clue where. If I don't get up, if I don't stand, if I don't start thinking about where I am and how to get out of there, then this is going to be over very quickly.' </p> <p>As a pathologist, used to watching how the body's cells function through a microscope, does he speculate on what saved him? </p> <p>'As far as I know I'm the only person to have come out of a hypothermic coma in that setting. That awakening is something I don't understand. I've looked at it from the most spiritual and most physical angles. There are things that changed physically during that day which may have been sufficient. And the core of your body can withstand drops in its temperature far beyond what I would have believed.' </p> <p>He cites the example of a man immersed in the North Sea who suffered a core temperature of 82F - 16F below normal body temperature - and could still talk rationally. But it still seems like a marvel to Weathers. </p> <p>This was not a brush with death: as Weathers might say, it was the full spring clean. When he walked into camp, none of the climbers still there could believe the apparition in front of them was the dead Beck Weathers. </p> <p>'This man had no face,' one recalled later. 'It was completely black, solid black, like he had a crust over him.' </p> <p>Everyone there who was still thinking clearly also assumed he would be dead by morning. He was put in a tent on his own, and left alone. His wife was later outraged that her husband should be abandoned to die with no one to comfort him. </p> <p>Weathers is more forgiving. 'Everyone was exhausted. Everyone who was rational was frightened. And I think in terms of the hard choices of what could be done for me - well, they'd done it all. Nobody had any expectation that I would live through the night. But it never occurred to me at that point that I would not live through it.' </p> <p>The events of that day and night on Everest have been mired in controversy, partly because of the media interest that live internet coverage generated. In total, eight climbers died on the mountain. By the time Weathers was on his way to base camp, journalists were arriving in Kathmandu to interview him. </p> <p>'They told me this trip was going to cost me an arm and a leg,' he joked to his rescuers as they helped him down. 'So far, I've gotten a little better deal.' </p> <p>Within hours he was on his way to Kathmandu in a helicopter, the highest rescue ever completed. Weathers was on the cover of Newsweek and made every TV news bulletin, but any thought of cashing in quickly on his experiences was forgotten. He may have joked with his rescuers, but now he feared the return of his depression, terrified that now it would overwhelm him. And leaving aside his physical injuries, his marriage was all but destroyed by the obsession that had left him physically ruined. </p> <p>'That would have been vastly more difficult to deal with,' he says of Peach's doubts about staying. 'I simply don't know, because I didn't have to face it, whether I could have coped.' </p> <p>Instead, she agreed to stay for a year while he adjusted to his injuries. His right arm had thawed and withered. 'It looked,' says Weathers, 'like it had been incinerated.' He had frostbite in his left hand also, in his left foot and all over his face. Nothing could be done for his nose. The frostbite had extended through the soft tissue, his skin and cartilage, right into the bone. Before it was cut away, plastic surgeon Greg Anigian took an impression in tin foil of the original. Weathers was forced to spray the now-exposed nasal passages to keep them moist while surgeons then grew a new nose - upside down - on his forehead, taking cartilage from his ears and skin from his neck, before relocating it where his original had been amputated. He had to be careful, he quips, not to let the kids take a picture for National Enquirer. </p> <p>His right arm was amputated just below the elbow; the left side is better, with what is effectively a fleshy mitt and a crude thumb. He lived through a year of pain as the severed nerves in his arms settled down, like 'constantly being hit on the funny bone', he says. 'It may not look all that fancy, but the reconstruction on the left side is very hi-tech. They did a helluva job. To have any movement and to be able to pick up something.' </p> <p>He shakes his head. 'It's amazing how functional you can be. Four months after they cut my hands off, I went back to work.' </p> <p>When he finally came to write his story, simply telling the world about how he survived was not enough. He and Peach decided to write about how they put their life back together, something climbing had almost destroyed. 'For us, the rationale to do this was not to cover the mountain story but the drives which put you there, the price you pay in terms of relationships. Having had the experience of dying once - it's fine, it's doable. But you don't pay the big price. Knowing that stripped me of a lot of my rationalisations and denial.' </p> <p>He also says he is no longer plagued by depression and although he misses climbing he feels liberated. 'That sense of having to prove myself externally has simply gone. I don't think about things in that way anymore and it has been a huge relief. I think that happens to most people, it just often happens a lot later. </p> <p>'It seems trite to say that I live each day as if it's my last, that the colours are brighter, the sense of the wind in your face is more intense. But it's true, at least for a good part of every day, and that's an exquisite pleasure.' </p> <p>\u0095 'Left For Dead' by Beck Weathers, with Stephen G.

  "<p><strong> Spectacular Bodies</strong> </p> <p>Hayward Gallery, London SE1 until 14 January 2001 </p> <p>Living mostly in my head, I prefer not to know about the extraneous parts of me suspended below the neck. Except when it's hungry or randy or sick, my body happily leaves me alone, and lets me get on with my work. </p> <p>It's comfortable and convenient to be inside one of these soft machines looking out: you can remain invisible if you avoid mirrors. To be on the outside looking in is a different prospect. What you see, through the aperture of a wound or a surgical incision, is dismaying, even nauseating - the squashy palpating organs, the tangled wires, the coiled, clogged drainage pipes, the brittle scaffolding which holds it all upright. Not to mention the oozing, ubiquitous blood. </p> <p><strong> Spectacular Bodies</strong>, a survey of anatomical art since the Renaissance, forces you to acknowledge your innards in all their mucky squalor and mad intricacy. The show's stern motto is 'Know thyself'. That was the command of the Delphic oracle, reaffirmed by the Renaissance humanists when they began to inspect the interior of God's creature. Gabriel Harvey laid bare the refined filaments of our circulatory system, and Leonardo's cross-sectioned wombs exposed the mystery of germination. Spectacular Bodies acclaims the human organism as 'an astounding feat of engineering', just as Hamlet rhapsodised 'What a piece of work is man'. But both anthems contain their own disillusioned undoing. If man is a piece of work or an engine, he can be disassembled. At the Hayward you'll find a papier-mch\u00e9 torso with removable parts, constructed in 1830 by Auzoux. You can remove the staring, bloodshot eyes, weigh the dangling testicles, pry loose the tubular gut and prod the filmy lungs. After such knowledge, what forgiveness? </p> <p>Hamlet's humanism was promptly corrected by his conversation with the grave-diggers and his scrutiny of an eyeless, musty, mouldering skull. If man is, as one section of Spectacular Bodies proposes, a 'divine machine', you have to wonder why the divinity constructed a machine which is destined, like all other household gadgets, to break down. Leonardo's Vitruvian man, as ideal and eugenic as a model in an underwear advertisement, may have been the prototype, but the norm is outnumbered by warped abnormalities: Hogarth's leering monsters, the men in Daumier's caricatures who mutate back into monkeys, or the studies of demoniac derangement by Jean-Martin Charcot. </p> <p>As you enter, Spectacular Bodies confronts you with the instruments you'll need if you want to know yourself. The first exhibit is a case of surgical tools: hacksaws, carving knives, sharp-toothed pincers and brutish clamps. Self-knowledge, we are warned, means self-vivisection. The seventeenth-century Dutch surgeons in Aert Pieteresz's Anatomy Lesson possess the necessary anaesthetised detachment. Twenty-nine coldly lucid, bodiless brains, whose starched collars sever their heads from their funereal, blackly uniform bodies, pause over a headless corpse which they are eviscerating. Elsewhere, this scientific neutrality becomes a credential of sanctity. St Bartholemew, painted by Bronzino, experimentally flays himself, unpeeling his skin as if he were a satsuma so he can study his divine network of nerves and sinews. The blade he has used is bloodless, and unnecessary: the body of a good man is transparent. But Bronzino's panel tells another story about corporeality. The wood is blotched and gnawed, the varnish has eczema. The saint may be immortal, the painting is not. </p> <p>Other \u00e9corch\u00e9 statues, stripped of their skin for examination, are less serenely disembodied than Bartholemew. A terracotta woman by Manfredini, from the 1770s, has opened a window in her abdomen. Flaying for her is a striptease; she internalises Salome's seven veils, and shows us what lies beneath her nudity. A bronze by Jean-Antoine Houdon is stringy, wasted, with fragile knobbly bones, belying the contemplative calm of neoclassicism. Stone or metal are at least impervious, immune to pain; at the Hayward, the hardest works to stomach are those in wax, because the medium is so queasily palpable, as squashy and humid as flesh, releasing a sickly fragrance when it is melted and moulded into shape. The medical waxworks of Joseph Towne have a horrific verisimilitude. One cadaver by Towne has stumps for teeth and a five o'clock shadow; his skin is slick, as if with a cold sweat. No wonder his mouth gapes in a silent scream, since he has been neatly sectioned at the thorax. </p> <p>The obstetric specimens on display are hard to look at, even harder to think about. A drawing of a gravid uterus by Jan van Rymsdyck turns the child into a jellyfish. A wax foetus by Petrus Koning resembles a wizened old man. Another blanched, bottled foetus - the real thing from the eighteenth century, not a replica - has beads around its wrists and ankles: did this lunar being wear them inside some extra-terrestrial womb? Our earliest rite of passage, that traumatic trip from inside to outside, is depicted in a gruesome wax tableau. Hands which are bandaged stumps poke inside a dilated, mustachioed vagina; the baby, diving upside down in quest of an exit, buries its head in the amniotic lake and winks at us with its nether eye. Familiar works, in this morbid context, look unnervingly new. Degas's bronze dancer in her muslin tu-tu is here, but not as a wispy impressionistic wraith: her 'prognathous tendencies' and 'the ignoble cast of her head' mark her as a genetic throwback. </p> <p>And towards the end of the show, we come upon Frith's Railway Station , a bustling panorama of Paddington in 1862. Except that, after all those skulls and death masks and body parts in brine, you notice that the painting doesn't bustle. The life in it is forcibly stilled, paralysed; those porters, cabbies, policemen and bemused passengers are post-mortem versions of themselves, as if propped up at Madame Tussaud's. </p> <p>The exhibition overlooks modernism, which is a shame. After all, the expressionist Otto Dix painted himself as a sex-killer, rampantly butchering bodies, and T.S. Eliot in 'Prufrock' likened twilight to the prostration of 'a patient etherised upon a table'. But the curators have commissioned work from a series of 'postmodern presences', whose contributions are startlingly displayed in gaps between the stages of the historical survey. </p> <p>A sloping ramp is used to project Christine Borland's video of a patient with muscular dystrophy struggling to stand upright; the incline, as a consequence, becomes a small parable of hard-earned evolutionary ascent. Around a corner, a dark room contains Bill Viola's film of open-heart surgery. Katharine Dowson's glass vertebrae, Pia Mater, glow in a shadowy stairwell. And the exhibition concludes, if you open a secretive padded door, in a private asylum designed by Beth B, whose patients are hysterical women creatures governed, according to medical misogyny, by their frenzied wombs. </p> <p>Brilliant as it is, I'm not sure the show helped me to know myself. Rather it made me grateful for my ignorance. I won't stop washing, or looking after the importunate bits of me that jut out. As for the rest, it had better stick to its own realm of red, jungly, throbbing darkness. Thank God for skin, which - as bland and faceless as a business suit - saves us from having to see beneath the surface. </p> <p>\u0095 Laura Cumming is away</p>",
  "<p>'Rinse it ouy for us, mate!' The bag being handed over in the foyer of this small but bustling recording studio is not full of dirty laundry, but white labels - exclusive first pressings of new records and remixes. The DJ collecting them looks like he'll be more than happy to give them the heavy play requested. On the UK garage scene right now, few artists are generating as much excitement as Wookie, and a new track from the writer/producer is a valuable commodity. Meanwhile Wookie's recent chart hit 'Battle' is coming loud and clear through the studio speakers, as phones ring, and the door buzzes with a constant stream of visitors. </p> <p>It's 10 years since Soul II Soul - a collective built around Jazzie B and his north London sound system - burst into the charts, first with 'Keep on Movin' and then the No 1 'Back To Life'. Fusing the traditions of Jamaican reggae sound systems, the melodies of American R&amp;B and the attitude of the London club underground, Jazzy and his crew created a sound that was proudly black, but also unmistakably British. A decade on, it's easy to forget their impact. When Soul II Soul toured the US, many interviewers confessed they hadn't known there was a black community in Britain. The music was also one of the first outward signs of a growing confidence in UK club culture. No longer content to produce pale imitations of US sounds, the British dance scene would soon lead the world, inventing whole genres of music: hardcore, jungle, drum'n'bass, UK garage. </p> <p>As a band, Soul II Soul got left behind in the rush, releasing five albums before fading away into oblivion. But their record label has continued to function from its Camden HQ. And now, improbably, it finds itself back on the cutting edge. Away from all the bustle in the tiny backroom that has served as his studio for six years, Jason Chue - aka Wookie - looks happy, but bemused. 'It's all happened so fast,' he admits. </p> <p>He put his first record out at the start of 1999, a bootleg track built around an a cappella version of Whitney Houston's 'It's Not Right But It's OK'. The tune was played by some of the booming UK garage scene's biggest DJs, and more bootlegs followed: 'I won't say how many, because I know it's illegal.' By November Chue had a double platinum record to his credit, a (legal) remix of Gabrielle's 'Sunshine'. He also had a new name: Wookie, playing on his family name Chue. (Chewy, or Chewbacca, was Harrison Ford's hirsute alien partner in the Star Wars movies - a wookie by species.) </p> <p>But Chue was cautious. He'd already been burnt by the music industry, when he worked with famous-for-five-minutes UK R&amp;B artist Wayne Marshall in 1994 - the two fell out over publishing rights to Marshall's hit single 'G Spot'. Shortly afterwards, Chue began working for Soul II Soul, playing on their final album and then working on R&amp;B and hip-hop tracks in their Camden studio. As the demand for his remixes grew he went to Jazzie B for advice, and was told to get back in the studio to make some music of his own. 'I wanted to do remixes - I wanted the money. Then I saw what happened to people around me. They all did these remixes, rinsed out their own sound, but it was all short-term. They didn't start producing, getting songwriting credits. If it wasn't for Jazzie, I'd probably be mixing everything under the sun now, and you wouldn't hear of me in a year's time.' </p> <p>The remixes he has done have been carefully chosen: American artists like Angie Stone to help break his sound across the Atlantic, pop acts such as Texas to widen his audience at home. 'I've turned a lot down. If I'm going to give some of my sound, it's got to be worthwhile,' he says. </p> <p>Meanwhile, he began working on new tracks with singer Lain Grey, and soon the major labels wanted to sign him. Despite the big money on offer, Chue chose to stay with Soul II Soul Recordings. 'I've learned a lot about the business from Jazzie,' he explained. 'He always called me his prot\u00e9g\u00e9, from day one. He showed me where all the potholes are in the road. He never tells me what to do, he always presents me with the options, and I think I took the right one.' </p> <p>Chue describes himself as 'a late starter' when it comes to music. 'Because I never had music lessons, I don't know the rules. So I break them all the time. It's quite innocent, the way I approach it.' His dad ran a reggae sound system, but his mother was strict, and young Jason never went out clubbing. He didn't buy records, and only really started playing the cheap keyboard he'd bought after he'd been made redundant from his job at an architectural practice. Meanwhile he started going to drum'n'bass clubs, and was excited by what he heard. 'It was so innovative. I used to call them technicians, not musicians, because it wasn't exactly music they were playing - just this creation.' </p> <p>Noting that many didn't like the music because of its breakneck tempo and lack of melody, he took the inventive drum programming and slowed it down. 'I wanted to create songs, not just a beat going round and round.' </p> <p>Carried by Lain Grey's powerful voice, it's the songs which make Wookie's eponymous debut album so exciting. Only one track isn't original. 'What's Going On' is a juddering, Latin-tinged dance number with vocals that are oddly familiar. It's Soul II Soul's Caron Wheeler, singing what you gradually realise is a radically reworked 'Back To Life'. 'I wanted to do a track where you knew the vocals, but not the style of music,' says Chue. 'Like a teaser advert. It's my homage to Soul II Soul.' </p> <p>Chue is already moving on. He's doing remixes under the name Exe Men, releasing underground tunes on his own label, preparing to produce new talent through his set-up with Soul II Soul. But for now, there's Wookie , a record that shows just how far we've come in 10 years. In it you'll hear the frenetic breakbeats of drum'n'bass, the distorted basslines of acid house, a sense of rhythm and space straight from reggae, and some great tunes. New soul, UK garage, or just the latest dancefloor grooves - whatever you want to call it, it's a sound that could only have been made right now in Britain.

  "<p>A couple of years ago, Joaquin Phoenix was starring in Return To Paradise, a film about a trio of American tourists who get caught with a brick of hash in Malaysia. So Phoenix turned up on set looking every bit as skinny as a guy who has spent too long in an unhealthy prison would do. Impressed, and feeling he could do with being a little less porky himself, director Joseph Ruben asked how he could replicate the feat. 'Just stop eating,' Phoenix suggested. </p> <p>While it can't be easy being the brother of a dead icon, Joaquin Phoenix is establishing himself as a substantial figure in his own right. Earlier this year, his creepy turn as Commodus in Gladiator gave him a taste of the Hollywood big time. </p> <p>And he is in two very different films showing at the London Film Festival: playing a smooth criminal in the moody New York drama The Yards, and a priest in Quills, one of the two Marquis De Sade films doing the rounds. In all these parts, he brings a brooding quality that Yards director James Gray suggests is evidence of an 'inner Beelzebub'. </p> <p>Phoenix himself has a brighter take on it. 'It's always fun to do really intense characters like that. I love creating them, coming up with the hairstyle, the TNT...' </p> <p>It's not hard to see where he could draw the dark emotions from. </p> <p>Joaquin was at the Viper Room on the night his elder brother River took a fatal drug cocktail, and was the one who called the ambulance. Understandably, he doesn't like to talk about it. 'I've come nearer acceptance - I wouldn't say understanding, because it's something I'll never understand - but just an acceptance of River's death.' </p> <p>Joaquin Phoenix was born in Puerto Rico in 1974. At the time, his parents were missionaries for the Children Of God cult. Wanting to be more like his siblings (his sisters are called Rain, Liberty and Summer) the young boy changed his name to Leaf. </p> <p>After leaving the cult while living in Venezuela, the family stowed away on a container ship full of toys. Back in the US, the siblings started busking, and the family moved to California so they could break into the entertainment industry. Leaf made his TV debut age eight. In 1989, when he had a part in the film Parenthood, he seemed to catching up with his brother's success, but then he vanished to Mexico to be with his father, and returned calling himself Joaquin again. He relaunched his career in a spectacular fashion by playing the dim teenager Nicole Kidman seduces into murdering her husband in To Die For (1995). </p> <p>If his roles since then (in underperforming films like Inventing The Abbotts and U Turn) haven't quite matched up to his potential, then he hasn't embarrassed himself either. A relationship with Liv Tyler kept him in the public eye, but this year it is the work that is keeping his name up there. Not that fame really fits: he remains permanently scruffy, even in the most expensive clothes. 'On aeroplanes they never think I belong in first class. They always ask me to see my boarding pass.'</p> <p><strong>Five things you should know about Joaquin Phoenix </strong></p> <p>1 He claims most people who 'recognise' him are mistaking him for iconoclastic actor/director Vincent Gallo.</p> <p>2 Joaquin is a Spanish name that is (roughly) pronounced 'Wah-keen' (and certainly never 'Jo-a-kin').</p> <p>3 His vegan beliefs mean he can never wear leather costumes: this has caused problems.</p> <p>4 He came up with the name Leaf while helping his father rake leaves.</p> <p>5 He was the person who called the emergency services the night his brother River collapsed.</p>",
  "<p><strong> I rest not from my great task! </strong></p> <p><strong>To open the Eternal Worlds, to open the immortal Eyes </strong></p> <p><strong>Of Man inwards into the Worlds of Thought; into Eternity</strong> </p> <p>Why is Blake back? You might think that as one of England's finest and most-quoted poets Blake has never been away, but it isn't so. He was roundly ignored in his lifetime. Wordsworth thought him mad, a judgment that remained common even among such enthusiasts as Swinburne and GK Chesterton. The swell of popular interest in his work in the 60s faded with the decade, perhaps because his aphorism about opening 'the doors of perception' had been over-quoted by acid-gobblers like Jim Morrison. The cult of Blake subsided, though his name was periodically evoked by pop artists such as Van Morrison and Paul Weller. </p> <p>Yet here is the Tate exhibition, following on the heels of Peter Ackroyd's magnificent biography. And here is 'Jerusalem', Blake's visionary anthem to his homeland, blaring from our screens every time the England football team take to the turf. 'And did those feet in ancient times', it seems, was actually a far-sighted reference to England's 1966 win. </p> <p>By happy synchronicity, 'Jerusalem' is in vogue as the debate about national identity grows more heated by the month. With the UK's Celtic regions spinning off into semi-autonomy, and our royalty discredited, 'Jerusalem' has become prime contender for the English national anthem. </p> <p>The prospect doesn't delight everyone. For many, Blake's lines are a piece of push-button patriotism, forever tainted by association with the Tory Party, Chariots of Fire, and Elgar's 'Land of Hope and Glory' (it was Elgar who orchestrated Hubert Parry's music into the terrace chorus we know). The Left, while keen on dispensing with 'dark satanic mills', remains suspicious of any 'countenance divine', and the Labour Party's long-standing intention to build 'the New Jerusalem' is rarely glimpsed on the Blairite agenda. </p> <p>Yet as Iain Sinclair remarks below, there are many Blakes on offer. It's a mark of Blake's genius, his universality, that he unites such diverse enthusiasts. Science writers such as Bronowski and Dawkins, Marxists such as EP Thompson, Jungians such as Kathleen Raine, poets such as WB Yeats and Allen Ginsberg (who as a young man heard Blake sing to him), Avalonians such as John Michell, jazzers such as Mike Westbrook and filmmakers such as Jim Jarmusch have all summoned Blake's utopian spirit to their causes. </p> <p>Why is Blake back? Because we sense in his texts and paintings, poems and prophecies, in his arduous but committed life, a glimpse of the fully human, of the transcendent entwined with earthly realities. 'Innocence' or 'Experience', 'England' or 'Albion' - sing whichever of his songs touches your heart.</p> <p><strong>Iain Sinclair, novelist</strong></p> <p>William Blake of Soho. Child Blake seeing angels in a tree on Peckham Rye. Naked Blake reciting Paradise Lost in a leafy Lambeth bower. Blake the engraver, in old age, walking to Hampstead. Blake singing on his deathbed in Fountain's Court. Blake, lying with his wife Catherine, in Bunhill Fields. Blake the prophet. Blake the psychogeographer. Blake the red-cap revolutionary, watching Newgate burn. Blake the happy-clappy revivalist of Glad Day, banging a tambourine with Michael Horowitz. Blake, at the last night of the proms, burning in the mad eyes of sentimental imperialists. </p> <p>We force the poet on to a Procrustean bed, squeezing and shaping him to fit our fantasies. We insist on seeing him as a London figure, coeval with Sherlock Holmes, Jack the Ripper, Henry VIII. Blake declines into a heritage token, an emblem to be bolted on to the bonnet of any old banger.</p> <p>What we should go back to, and what can serve us still, is the work; the great, complex freewheeling derangements of the prophetic books, the savage wisdom of the parables, the unnerving directness of the lyrics.</p> <p>There is no reason on earth why Blake, his poetry or his art, should be of any use. It was never his business to be useful. Shovels are useful. Paper clips are useful. Blake astounds, terrifies, delights. He gives us a richer sense of ourselves and of our city. His presence animates certain dusty corners. The incantatory rhythms of his poems drum in our heads and fire our blood. He doesn't grant entrance to a lost garden of time. He challenges us to risk everything, the kind of possession he himself underwent when he rewrote Milton, became Milton, revised his errors. Blake is there and the rest is up to us. </p> <p><strong>Andrew Motion, Poet Laureate</strong></p> <p>Blake is no less a writer than our other 'national poets', but in certain respects a more difficult one - if we look at poems other than the Songs of Innocence and Experience, that is. Living at a sharp angle to life, he often told the truth by telling it slant. This is what makes his work so admirable in all respects: he is always his own man, yet always concerned with the common experience. His greatness is incontestable - at once highly original, and utterly humane.</p> <p><strong>Tom Paulin, poet and critic</strong></p> <p>Blake was important to me when I was growing up in Belfast in the 1960s, as he was to Van Morrison, another Blakean. He subsequently went rather out of fashion, perhaps because there was a lot of literary criticism by people like Northrop Frye which was full of Jungian archetypes, and Jung was a Nazi sympathiser. There was also the lack of a historical version of Blake; David Erdman's book, Prophet Against Empire, showed that Tyger is about the French and American revolutions. At the time that Enoch Powell made his 'Rivers of Blood' speech in 1968, the Bishop of Woolwich, John Robinson, said that if Christ had come back, as Blake mentions in Jerusalem, he would have been turned back by the immigration officers. Powell replied that the poem was blasphemous. Jerusalem is an affirmation of English or British freedom. It's done in a way that is not ethically exclusive - and you think of Blake's sympathy with black slaves. Blake is a great, radical, dissenting, one-nation English poet. </p> <p><strong>Billy Bragg, singer </strong><br>People often see belligerence and justification for militarism in Jerusalem's line, 'nor shall my sword sleep in my hand' - partly because Hubert Parry wrote the music for Jerusalem during the First World War, and gave it a rousing atmosphere - but Blake is talking of a 'mental fight', about the force of conscience. He's arming himself with his spiritual beliefs against the industrial revolution, when people who were living at the pace of nature were being forced to live at the pace of capital. For me, the song is asking what would Jesus Christ have said if he had returned then, how could Christian values exist in industrialism? </p> <p>My song 'Upfield' was inspired partly by Blake; I borrowed events from his life for the song's narrator, such as putting him on Primrose Hill seeing angels. It's about moving from an ideological argument for a better society to a more humanitarian vision; a socialism of the heart, the kind of compassion I find in Blake.</p> <p><strong>Sir John Tavener, composer</strong></p> <p>Blake's use of tradition, his 'liquid' poetic theology, and the fact that he believed that all traditions and 'sacred codes' have placed man under a divine order - this is what has most deeply inspired me about Blake. For instance, in The Lamb, he describes the eternal world of Light and in The Tyger, he is concerned with 'Hell, or energy', and 'the terrors of the Abyss'. But above all, in all his work, he refers to Jesus as the 'Imagination'. The western world understands nothing of this.</p> <p>He is relevant, precisely because the world today knows nothing of these things. Our world is a smouldering junkyard which believes that innovation and 'mental things are alone real'. This is its tragedy and its abyss. 'Let him who appears wise in this world become a fool, that he may become wise.' This is what Blake did, and all of us should follow him.</p> <p>Today, we live in a culture in ruins. We, with our pathetic ego-centred imaginations can conceive of neither source nor symbol. 'For everything that lives is holy,' wrote Blake; but we continue to commit mass genocide and to systematically destroy 'everything that is holy'. 'Awake! Awake O sleeper of the land of shadows. Wake! Expand!'</p> <p>We would indeed be poverty-stricken without Blake. After all, he lived in a secular and flippant humanistic age, and he alone in that age understood that 'the artist is an inhabitant of that happy country' - in other words, the artist of paradise.</p> <p><strong>Alan Moore, graphic novelist</strong></p> <p>I read Blake at O level, but studied him seriously when I was researching From Hell, my book about Jack the Ripper, which has lots of references to Blake; him seeing a spectre at his house in Hercules Road, for example. Blake represents the visionary heroism of the imagination. He was living in a London which was not much more than a squalid horse toilet, on which he superimposed a magnificent four-fold city and populated it with angels, and philosophers of the past. Art at its best has the power to insist on a different reality.</p> <p>\u0095 Tom Paulin's lecture on Blake is at Tate Britain on 22 November at 6.30pm.
