  "<p>A government initiative to smooth the path for thousands of medically qualified refugees to fill jobs in the NHS was announced yesterday. </p> <p>The plan includes drawing up a database of refugees qualified as healthcare professionals and want to retrain to work in the health service. </p> <p>The health minister, John Denham, said an estimated 2,000 qualified doctors were registered as refugees in Britain. Helping them to retrain could help solve NHS staffing problems, he said. The initiative - started with a \u00a3500,000 grant - will be extended shortly. </p> <p>The database will concentrate on qualified doctors and dentists but will eventually encompass other healthcare professions like radiography and occupational therapy. </p> <p>Mr Denham said: \"It makes fundamental sense for us to enable refugees with medical skills to work in the NHS. </p> <p>\"We are of course training thousands more doctors, nurses and other healthcare professionals but it takes at least six years to train a doctor. </p> <p>\"During that time there may be as many as 2,000 refugees in this country who have already qualified as doctors abroad. </p> <p>The initiative was unveiled alongside a Home Office strategy to help refugees rebuild their lives in Britain.</p>",

  "<p><strong>'CARDS ON THE TABLE' TIME</strong></p> <p>You can say what you like about Kelvin Koogan's Camp England - and God knows the Fiver certainly has - but at least the squad was always mightily entertained. If they became bored of watching Manchester United players not speak to Liverpool players (and vice versa), they could enjoy live satellite racing - which Koog had specially installed in the team's hotel during Euro 2000 - instead. And when that became a mite tedious, they could blow \u00a310,000 in one sitting at the card schools which Koog encouraged as \"a form of relaxation\". So it wasn't the greatest surprise in the world when the FA's Adam Del Boy Crozier today admitted that things had to change under Svennis the Menace. \"I have heard from people within the camp, including the players, that they are not close,\" he admitted. \"Fundamentally, we need a change in the whole set-up.\" But no sooner had we heard from Crozier, we bumped - quite literally - into gambling legend Mickey Quinn, who told us there was nothing wrong with a bit of a flutter.</p> <p>\"There were card schools at every club I was involved with,\" he surprisingly revealed. \"You have to find a way of relieving the boredom of a four-hour coach journey. I have never known it to have a detrimental effect on team spirit.\" Really? \"Well, I guess if you were losing vast sums of money, that might be a bit divisive. But I have never seen anyone lose more than \u00a3700,\" he continued with a smile.</p> <p>Mickey wasn't the only one taking issue with Del Boy, either. \"It's unbelievable,\" said Phil Neville, scything Crozier down with a completely unnecessary tackle. \"I read one story this morning saying that the Liverpool lads don't talk to the United lads. But that's the biggest load of rubbish I've ever heard because I know we've got a good relationship,\" he added as he carefully stuck a Panini sticker of Michael Owen onto the front of a nearby urinal.</p> <p><strong>FIGO FIVER</strong></p> <p>You only have to look to the past for proof of the Premiership's pulling power. Some of the biggest talents in the game have plied their trade on these shores - who could forget the joyous sight of Ilie Dumitrescu flying down the wing, or of Tomas Brolin flying down to the club canteen? And further proof of the exalted status of our shiny profit-making league came along today when world-record signing Luis Figo spoke of his desire to play in England.</p> <p>\"I will play in England,\" Figo announced today. \"The atmosphere makes me want to go to England, because of the way that they live for the game.\" But although this is the sort of 'come-and-get-me' announcement which normally has Premiership chairmen falling over each other to get a signature, it is in fact unlikely that Figo will be arriving here too soon. Mainly because there's a \u00a3100m buy-out clause in his Real Madrid contract.</p> <p>Anyway, even if Manchester United, Arsenal or Bradford were prepared to spunk that sort of wad on one player, the Portuguese winger's arrival would still not be guaranteed. \"I started playing very young,\" explained a doe-eyed Figo, tuning up a violin. \"Depending on how things are, I don't know whether I'll have the strength or motivation to be doing this for many more years. I'm on the last lap.\"</p> <p>But there may still be a way. Luckily, poor Luis has put his thinking cap on, and has come up with a clever plan so he can hobble on long enough to realise his dream. \"If I only played 20 or 30 games a season I could reach 36,\" he mused. A great idea, Luis, and good luck! The Fiver - along, no doubt, with people who have to do 40 hours of manual labour every week - wishes you all the best!</p> <p><strong>QUOTE OF THE DAY</strong></p> <p>\"Bryan Robson has taken [Middlesbrough] to three cup finals and two promotions.

Wherever could he be? \"I am in Greater Orlando, Florida!\" So you are. Well, having completely spoilt our game, perhaps you'd be good enough to give us your thoughts on testing positive for cocaine. \"No comment!\" Oh come on. \"I will make a statement through my lawyers later over all the accusations and the incorrect hair test.\"</p> <p>Well, that's something, we suppose. So how are you? \"I'm all right.\" Good, good. And you're looking after yourself, we trust? \"I go swimming and jogging.\" That's super!

  "The latest snarling row between the Sinn Fein and the Ulster unionists is, on the face of it, more absurd than ominous. <p>David Trimble, unionist leader and first minister of the power-sharing devolved executive, has barred his two Sinn Fein ministers from attending the cross-border council which links the governments in Dublin and Belfast.</p> <p>But one of those ministers, Bairbre de Brun, is going ahead anyway with a meeting with her counterpart from the Irish Republic. She says that Trimble's move is all to do with keeping the peace within his own party, which is deeply divided over the peace process.</p> <p>To some extent, that is true. Less than a week ago, Trimble had to fight off yet another vigorous attempt by dissidents to haul the party out of the devolved government.</p> <p>His bar on Sinn Fein is at least partly intended to show the dissidents that he can act tough.</p> <p>But that is only part of the story. Trimble is genuinely exasperated by the failure of the IRA, as he sees it, to honour is commitment to disarm as part of the peace process.</p> <p>His block on Sinn Fein involvement with the north-south council - the part of the peace accord which republicans like best - is more than a yellow-card gesture.</p> <p>It is a very real warning that, unless the arms decommissioning starts soon, the whole process could unravel.</p> <p>Some might say that is happening already. Ian Paisley and his Democratic Unionists are bellowing with rage about power sharing and the imminent reform of the Royal Ulster Constabulary, and are siphoning away support from Trimble's party at an alarming rate.</p> <p>The unionist community in general is gripped by fear of renewed violence, not least between the loyalist paramilitary groups, the Ulster Freedom Fighters and the Ulster Volunteer Force.</p> <p>Dissident republican factions like the Real IRA and the Continuity IRA also remain active.</p> <p>In the face of such dangers, nobody would expect the Provisional IRA to surrender its arsenal of weapons. In any case, whatever the unionists say, that was never the idea.</p> <p>But the group's sullen, sulky refusal to comply with the spirit of the Good Friday deal is both irresponsible and deeply worrying.</p> <p>It has said that it will allow two independent inspectors to re-visit arms dumps they first saw in the summer. It will also consider contacting John de Chastelain, the Canadian general who is supposed to be overseeing the decommissioning of all paramilitary arms.</p> <p>It doesn't take a mighty intellect to understand that that is simply not good enough.</p> <p>The republicans cannot take the bits of the agreement they like, such as the all-Ireland council, and reject the bits they don't.</p> <p>In exactly the same way, the unionists cannot reject those parts of the process they find offensive, like power-sharing and police reform. </p> <p>What is surprising about the latest spat is that the two sovereign governments, which are, after all, the senior partners in the peace process, have done and said so little to defuse it.</p> <p>It is odd, to say the least, that the Dublin government has agreed to send a minister to Enniskillen in the north for today's controversial meeting.</p> <p>And it is odder still that Peter Mandelson, the Northern Ireland Secretary, now seems to be Ulster's invisible man.</p> <p><b>Useful links:</b> <br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/Northern_Ireland\">Special report: Northern Ireland</a> <br> <a href=\"http://www.nio.gov.uk\" target=\"_new\">Northern Ireland Office</a> <br> <a href=\"http://www.uup.org\" target=\"_new\">Ulster Unionists</a> <br> <a href=\"http://www.dup.org.uk\" target=\"_new\">Democratic Unionist Party</a> <br> <a href=\"http://sinnfein.ie\" target=\"_new\">Sinn Fein</a> <br> <a href=\"http://www.indigo.ie/sdlp\" target=\"_new\">Social Democratic and Labour Party</a> <a href=\"http://www.belfasttelegraph.com/cgi-bin/todaysnews\" target=\"_new\">Belfast Telegraph</a> <br> <a href=\"http://scripts.ireland.com/tardis.plx?main=newspaper/front\" target=\"_new\">Irish Times</a> <br> <a href=\"http://www.irishnews.com\" target=\"_new\">Irish News</a> <br> <a href=\"http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/index.html\" target=\"_new\">Cain (Conflict Archive on the Internet)</a></p>",
  "<p>It has been a long time coming, but Chinese cinema looks as though it has finally taken over the world. From Hong Kong, John Woo has conquered Hollywood with Face/Off and Mission: Impossible 2. The art-film cognoscenti have long been enamoured of the precision craftsmanship of mainland China's Zhang Yimou and Chen Kaige. And, after years of trying, Jackie Chan has cracked the multiplexes (and wallets) of the west wide open. </p> <p>But it is a softly spoken 46-year-old who is arguably the most remarkable figure of this dazzling generation. Ang Lee, Taiwan-born but a long-time resident of the US, has in less than a decade forged a body of work that has put him at the forefront of the world's independent film-makers. The Wedding Banquet remains one of the most profitable low-budget films of the 90s. Sense and Sensibility received seven Oscar nominations (one actual statuette materialised, for Emma Thompson's screenplay). The Ice Storm is generally acknowledged as the finest treatment yet of the emotional emptiness of the 70s \"me\" decade. And it is conventional Hollywood wisdom that Lee will be the first Chinese film-maker to win the best director Oscar - though whether it will be for his new film, Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, is anyone's guess. </p> <p>In the flesh, Lee cuts an unassuming figure, a far cry from the stroppy weirdness of most American directors of his ilk, or the expensive suavity of other Chinese film-makers feted in the west. No Wong Kar-wai sunglasses for Ang Lee - he's neatly dressed but hardly cuts a dash in his suburban-store threads, and he never raises his voice above a gentle mutter. </p> <p>On the other hand, he doesn't seem as bemused by Hollywood success as John Woo, whose discomfort in the face of the west's fan worship is palpable whenever he has to appear in public. \"I feel very sorry for John Woo,\" says Lee, with real feeling. \"I was glad that he did Face/Off, but I feel he is unhappy making this movie Mission: Impossible 2. I'm glad it made so much money, though.\" </p> <p>Woo's blood-and-fire Hong Kong thrillers were achieved through the freedom granted by the armies of willing helpers typical of Hong Kong's film-making community; now, Woo has jumped straight into the upper echelons of studio Hollywood, where every line of dialogue and every foot of film is subject to executive interference and control. Lee, on the other hand, has trodden a much more measured path, negotiating his way through the more liberal environs of New York's independent film circuit. But even Lee has no firm answer to the question of how, exactly, the Chinese have managed it. </p> <p>\"It's kind of a chi [energy] thing,\" says Lee, deadpan. \"Everything is rotating. I think this generation, wherever we come from, shares a similar cultural background. We're brought up with Chinese melodrama but through education or whatever, we turn to other things. Now, in the climate of a declining film industry, no one knows what to do. Then boom-boom-boom, one or two films catch attention at film festivals and a world audience and we just keep making movies.\" </p> <p>Sitting alongside Lee is James Schamus, the academic-cum-producer who has worked on all of Lee's feature films. Schamus, currently associate professor of film theory at Columbia University, was there at the start of Lee's film-making career, when after six years of trying, Lee finally made his debut, Pushing Hands, in 1992. Schamus, a short, bespectacled New Yorker, talks lucidly about Chinese film-making's tradition of \"cross-national transactions\", and Asian cinema's propensity for \"co-financing interface structures\". Schamus gets excited about the reaction he sees \"against an uninformed but well-meaning critical community, which has often tended to pigeonhole Chinese directors into a specifically art-house idiolect. So that if you're from Taiwan, you're going to be an Edward Yang or a Hou Hsiao Hsien.\" </p> <p>At this point Lee interjects wearily: \"Long takes...\" </p> <p>Lee and Schamus together are conducting a war on several fronts. Firstly, as they are both acutely aware, Far East film-makers are generally the preserve of the international festival circuit, and their highly crafted films win plaudits but do little box-office. On the other hand, it is a challenge to turn a relatively sophisticated Chinese movie into a significant international hit. \"I have two sons in America,\" says Lee, \"and all they care about in Chinese culture is Jackie Chan and Jet Li. Those movies present probably the worst, most raucous part of Chinese culture. I want to straighten that out. So my parental affection comes into the project.\" </p> <p>Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is based on the fourth \"episode\" of a five-strong series of novels by Du Lu Wang, and is quite obviously Lee's attempt to integrate Asian and American cinema. Filmed with all the aesthetic grace you would expect of one of China's auteur directors, it also contains the kind of spectacular, gravity-defying martial-arts action that Hong Kong's commercial cinema specialises in and is wrapped up with the sweetener of two of the region's most internationally bankable stars, Michelle Yeoh and Chow Yun-fat. </p> <p>\"Because anticipation is high,\" Lee explains, \"I try to scoop up all the audience without disgracing myself. In Asia I have to deliver the film like a summer blockbuster, like a Jackie Chan movie; but afterwards I have to bring the movie to the west and release it like an art-house film, because of subtitles. I try to please everyone.\" He giggles. \"I look at American movies, the big muscles, and try to apply that to Chinese film-making.\" </p> <p>Lee's student years, in which he bounced from Taiwan to the United States, offer the perfect primer for his cross-cultural agility. Born and raised in Taiwan, the son of a schoolteacher, Lee spent two years at the country's academy of art, doing plenty of acting in the film and theatre department. He transferred to a drama college in Illinois in 1978, when he was 23; two years later he won a place at New York's crucible of talent, the NYU's film-making course. Though Lee excelled at NYU, it wasn't the springboard for him that it became for contemporaries like Spike Lee and Jim Jarmusch. He spent almost two years making his \"thesis\" film, a Chinatown-meets-Little Italy love story called Fine Line. But by 1986, Lee was so dispirited with America's lack of interest in Chinese-inflected movies that he was on the verge of moving back to Taiwan with his wife and son. </p> <p>Winning an award at a film festival stopped him. In Lee's words, he'd become a \"hot student\". Six years of frustration followed, when one project after another bit the dust. Broke and desperate, Lee eventually heard about a script competition set up by the Taiwanese government and knocked together a screenplay called Pushing Hands, about an elderly tai-chi master living with his son's family in the New York suburbs. He also sent in, as an afterthought, a little number called The Wedding Banquet, which had been lying in his bottom drawer for a while. Pushing Hands took the top prize, The Wedding Banquet the second. Though Lee vastly preferred Banquet, the offer by Taiwan's Central Motion Pictures office to fund the prize-winner (to the tune of $400,000) was too good to turn down. In 1992, Lee finally became a film director. </p> <p>This is where Schamus, and his company Good Machine, came into the picture, producing Lee's New York-based movie. Good Machine also came on board Lee's second film, The Wedding Banquet, which unexpectedly hit a chord with its unfussy, intelligent appreciation of immigrant pressures. Released in the summer of 1993, The Wedding Banquet became one of the year's most profitable movies. Lee then headed back to Taiwan to make the cooking-equals-love movie Eat Drink Man Woman, his first attempt at continent-hopping film-making. (Says Schamus: \"Chinese films have a different way of working with crew and actors. The position of director is pretty much revered. It was a shock when we went on set in Taiwan, and it was all 'Mr Director this, Mr Director that.' \") </p> <p> Lee's transfer to the big league came from the most unlikely of sources - an offer to direct Emma Thompson's adaptation of Sense and Sensibility, at the height of the mid-90s Jane Austen revival. \"How can you resist working with Emma Thompson?\" asks Lee. \"In that film I didn't think I did anything new for myself as a film-maker, but I was bringing myself up to a new level. For an eastern director, it was the first significant western movie. Sense and Sensibility scared me because I had to prove I can endure a studio production, I can direct English language, I can work with a movie star, and so on.\" </p> <p>With that success, Lee and Schamus next embarked on The Ice Storm, the adaptation of Rick Moody's 70s-set novel, which again hit a chord with audiences, this time wallowing in 70s nostalgia. \"To me The Ice Storm was the newest period piece, a costume drama so to speak,\" says Lee. \"It was very scary, too, because it was so fresh in people's memories.\" </p> <p>Schamus concurs: \"People working on the movie were so into it. A lot of the unity of the movie's design came about because of Ang's ability to organise all the departments together in pre-production in a way that got everybody behind the vision of the film very early on. It was quite specific - he would do thematic charts, every scene, every image, and we'd sit through these endless pre-production meetings going through every scene.\" </p> <p>It's through comments like these that you can sense the ferocious single-mindedness that must lie behind Lee's easy-going facade. But in company with Schamus, he has clearly found a relationship that serves his talents perfectly. \"I'm not a business guy, I'm a director,\" he explains, \"but I don't like to work for hire. I don't like to deal with studios. I don't like to have conversations with executives. I pitch to the studio, then never talk to them until the test screening.\" </p> <p>If, as everyone expects, Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon takes off like the thoroughbred it is, Lee will have cemented his place as a cross-cultural colossus, bridging styles, genres and languages in a way no film-maker has managed before. </p> <p>And what of the future? \"I don't know,\" he mutters in a quiet voice. \"I can make movies for ever.\"</p> <p> \u0095 The Guardian Interview with Ang Lee will take place on Tuesday at London's National Film Theatre. Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon screens in the Regus London Film Festival on November 6 and 7 (020-7928 3232) and will go on general release in January 2001.</p>",
  "Indian ocean islanders banished from their \"paradise\" home today won an historic high court battle with the British government. <p>A representative islander, Louis Bancoult, claimed he and hundreds of others were unlawfully sent into poverty-stricken exile from the Chagos Islands some 30 years ago to clear the way for construction of the US military base on Diego Garcia. </p> <p>Today Lord Justice Laws, sitting with Mr Justice Gibbs, ruled there had been \"an abject legal failure\" and overturned a 1971 Immigration Ordinance which bans the islanders - the Ilois - from returning to their islands. </p> <p>Richard Gifford, solicitor for the islanders, said: \"The government will now have to come up with a lawful policy in the light of the judges' findings.\" </p> <p>After the judges handed down their ruling, the court began to discuss how the judgment should be implemented, and what formal orders should be made. If, and when, the islanders get back to all, or any part, of the Chagos Islands is now the crucial question. </p> <p>The Foreign and Commonwealth Office was later granted permission to appeal. The court granted a seven-day \"stay\" on the effect of the order to quash pending appeal moves.</p> <p>It was a stunning victory for Mr Bancoult, 37, chairman of the Chagos refugee group in Mauritius. After the ruling he said: \"I am very proud. This is a historic day for the people.\" </p> <p>Mr Bancoult has long fought for the right to return to where his people had lived for up to five generations before Britain entered into an agreement in the 60s allowing the Americans to build the major strategic air and naval base, used in the bombing of Iraq.</p> <p><b>Related reports</b> <br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/Archive/Article/0,4273,4057649,00.html\">1 September: US blocks islanders' return</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/Archive/Article/0,4273,4037416,00.html\">6 July: Deserted islanders</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/netnotes/article/0,6729,344310,00.html\">NetNotes: the story in links</a></p> <p><b>Useful links</b> <br><a href=\"http://www.chagos.org/\" target=\"_new\">Chagos islanders' official site</a><br><a href=\"http://www.fco.gov.uk/\" target=\"_new\">Foreign and Commonwealth Office</a><br><a href=\"http://www.dg.navy.mil/islehist.htm\" target=\"_new\">US navy on Diego Garcia</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.time.com/time/daily/0,2960,10482,00.html\" target=\"_new\">What is Diego Garcia? - Time 20.2.98</a></p> <p></p>",

The Ulster Unionists, who want to block Sinn Fein from attending cross border meetings in punishment for the IRA's \"failure\" to disarm, have dismissed today's meeting as \"pantomime politics\". </p> <p>The talks will not have the status of a formal north south ministerial council because Mr Trimble, along with Mr Mallon, has the power to block ministers from appearing. However, the informal bilateral meeting will have symbolic significance. The sight of an Irish government minister sitting down with Sinn Fein and SDLP ministers - less than a week after Mr Trimble's veto threat - will demonstrate the resolve of nationalist Ireland. The talks will provide graphic proof of the gulf separating republicans and unionists, which bodes ill for efforts to save the peace process. </p> <p><b> Sinn Fein</b><br> </p> <p> Sinn Fein is adamant that today's meeting had to go ahead to make clear that republicans do not sit in government courtesy of unionist \"patronage\". The presence of Ms de Brun also shows that Sinn Fein remains deeply committed to making the Good Friday agreement work although the party has deep reservations about the state of the peace process, principally over the Ulster Unionists' commitment to the agreement. </p> <p>Martin McGuinness, Sinn Fein's education minister, accepts that Mr Trimble has faced down hardliners - at least until last Saturday. But he believes Mr Trimble's failure to promote the benefits of the agreement highlights lingering unionist doubts about the entire process. </p> <p>Sinn Fein's unease is compounded by its frosty relations with the government, mainly caused by the future of policing. Republicans believe that Peter Mandelson has watered down key elements of the Patten report to appease unionists. Sinn Fein says it cannot compromise any more. Sinn Fein's mistrust of unionists is undermining the faith of republicans in the peace process which can only strengthen the hands of hardliners. </p> <p><b> Provisional IRA</b><br> </p> <p> The IRA is deeply frustrated with unionists for placing such emphasis on decommissioning and with the British government for its alleged unwillingness to \"demilitarise\". Mr Trimble's provocative move will therefore have guaranteed that progress on disarmament has at best been set back, if not killed off altogether. In its recent statements the IRA has offered its usual support to Sinn Fein. However, security sources have suggested that there is unease among many IRA members at the sight of two Sinn Fein \"ministers of the crown\". The Real IRA appears to be growing in strength. Until now, it has not attracted a well-spread base of disaffected provisionals. The slow pace of the peace process could change that. The IRA leadership is particularly frustrated because it believes that it is living up to its commitment on disarmament. </p> <p><b> SDLP</b><br> </p> <p> John Hume's Social Democratic and Labour party shares many of the frustrations of the republican movement, but the party believes that the IRA should make further gestures on disarmament. Mr Mallon is taking a tough stance on police reforms because he believes that the Good Friday agreement must be implemented in full. </p> <p>He has accused the government of \"chicanery\" over the implementation of the Patten report. Some unionists have suggested that Mr Mallon has been boxed into a corner by Sinn Fein because he is terrified that republicans will overtake the SDLP as the main nationalist party at the general election. </p> <p><b> Irish government</b><br> </p> <p> Dublin has resorted to its traditional role as the protector of northern nationalists amid the uncertainty of the peace process. The prime minister, Bertie Ahern, believes that Mr Trimble's ban on Sinn Fein has seriously destabilised the peace process because it undermines the one area of the agreement which was tailor-made for nationalists. </p> <p> The north south ministerial council has huge significance in the Irish republic. Many members of Mr Ahern's Fianna Fail party were sceptical about renouncing Dublin's territorial claim to the north, a key element of the agreement. They set aside their reservations on the basis of the north south body. Dublin is also frustrated with the British government over the Patten reforms and for what it sees as slow progress on scaling down security measures. Republicans have not been let off the hook by Dublin which wants to see progress on the arms issue. </p> <p><b> British government</b><br> </p> <p> Peter Mandelson has been working frantically all week to navigate a middle way through the present crisis which allows all sides to save face. The Northern Ireland secretary bluntly told Mr Trimble that he must lift his ban on Sinn Fein ministers attending meetings of the cross border body. At the same time, however, the IRA should re-establish contact with the disarmament body to reassure unionists. </p> <p>\"It is not a matter of one or the other,\" Mr Mandelson said yesterday. \"It is both.\" His plans received a boost yesterday when the international arms inspectors said that the IRA was committed to the peace process. </p> <p>Mr Mandelson knows, however, that he has his work cut out because Dublin, republicans and unionists are deeply angered by the police bill. He rejects republican claims that he has watered down the Patten report, insisting that he has kept to its core principles. For unionists, however, the report is all too much. </p> <p><b> Ulster Unionists</b><br> </p> <p> David Trimble has been described as the Houdini of British and Irish politics after he faced down his hardline colleague, Jeffrey Donaldson. But his victory came at a high price which may eventually be seen as the death knell of the peace process. The Ulster Unionist leader is deeply committed to the Good Friday agreement and relishes his role as first minister. </p> <p>Mr Trimble has no qualms about the core elements of the deal - power sharing with nationalists and co-operating with the Irish republic. However, he has barely any room for manoeuvre, thanks to Mr Donaldson who is stalking his every move. </p> <p>The optimists say that the Donaldson faction is slowing buying into the process which it initially rejected. Mr Donaldson is now an enthusiastic supporter of the assembly and its committee system, something he initially opposed. </p> <p>However, Mr Donaldson has drawn a line in the sand which Mr Trimble is unlikely ever to cross: without real disarmament Sinn Fein should not be in government. </p> <p>The hardliners will have another chance to challenge Mr Trimble in January. If there has been no movement on arms and the police bill has received royal assent, the future of the peace process will look distinctly uncertain.</p> <p><b>Reforming the RUC: Patten's blueprint, and the reality</b><br></p> <p>The future of policing has become one of the most contentious issues in the peace process since the publication of Chris Patten's report. Nationalists claim that the police bill, implementing the Patten reforms, has been diluted to appease unionists. Unionists claim that the bill dismantles the RUC. </p> <p><b>The main differences between the bill and the Patten proposals are:</b><br></p> <p>Force's name</p> <p><b> Patten said:</b> The Royal Ulster Constabulary should remain but change its name to Northern Ireland Police service. </p> <p><b> Bill says:</b> The RUC will remain but be called Police Service of Northern Ireland (incorporating the RUC). </p> <p>Badge</p> <p><b> Patten said:</b> The new police service should adopt a new badge and symbols free from any association with either the British or Irish states.</p> <p><b> Bill says:</b> The secretary of state may make regulations prescribing the design of an emblem for the police and regulating the use of that or any other emblem.</p> <p>Flag</p> <p><b>Patten said:</b> The union flag should no longer be flown from police buildings. </p> <p><b>Bill says:</b> Secretary of state will make decision in consultation with police board. </p> <p>Oath</p> <p><b>Patten said:</b> New oath, which does not mention crown, should be sworn by all members of police force, including existing RUC officers. </p> <p><b>Bill says:</b> Only new recruits will swear oath. But existing officers will be bound by new code of ethics which incorporates commitment in oath to uphold human rights. </p> <p>Police board</p> <p><b> Patten said:</b> Policing board should have the power to follow up any report from the chief constable by initiating an inquiry into any aspect of the police service or police conduct. Limitations on matters of \"national security, sensitive personnel matters and cases before the courts\". </p> <p><b> Bill says:</b> Secretary of state can block an inquiry if it would \"prejudice the prevention or detection of crime or the apprehension or prosecution of offenders\". </p> <p><b> Other contentious issues include:</b><br></p> <p>District police partnerships</p> <p><b>Patten said:</b> DPPs should be able to contribute up to 3p in the pound to local policing costs. </p> <p><b> Bill says:</b> No mention of this in the bill. Government says the issue will be reviewed.</p> <p>Oversight commissioner Thomas Constantine, former head of US drug enforcement agency</p> <p><b>Patten said:</b> \"An eminent person, from a country other than the UK or Ireland, should be appointed... with responsibility for supervising the implementation of our recommendations.\" Nationalists are angry because the commissioner will oversee government's recommendations, rather than Patten's. </p> <p>Linking of anti-terrorist special branch with CID</p> <p><b>Patten said:</b> \"We recommend that, as a first step, special branch and crime branch be brought together under the command of a single assistant chief constable.\" </p> <p><b> Bill says:</b> Recommendation not in police bill because it is not a matter for legislation. Nationalists angry because government says it is commmitted to proposal only when security allows.</p>",
  "<p>James Dyson, maverick inventor, yesterday launched a new device for washing clothes cleaner and allegedly quicker.</p> <p>Seven years after he sprang the bagless, dual cyclone vacuum cleaner on the market, Mr Dyson unveiled the world's first two-drummed washing machine, the contrarotator. </p> <p>Rebuffed by other manufacturers, the entrepreneur's vacuum cleaner is now produced at a rate of 8,000 a day and has won more than half the British market by value against fierce competition from its rivals. </p> <p>The futuristic washing machine comes, like Dyson's cleaners, in purple, blue-yellow and silver. </p> <p>But it will cost two or three times more, retailing at between \u00a3999 and \u00a31,199 when it goes into selected shops from the end of this month. </p> <p>Mr Dyson, a multimillionaire devoted to resurrecting Britain's manufacturing base from his plant in Malmesbury, Wiltshire, claimed his new machine can clean clothes better at any temperature than any of its rivals. </p> <p>He said the twin drums, which rotate in opposite directions at the same time, cleaned clothes in half the time of rival machines - two hours 18 minutes compared with five hours 54 minutes for an average weekly load. </p> <p>The machine, launched to the blare of catwalk music and swathed in dry ice, works on the same basic principle as handwashing, according to its inventor. </p> <p>The twin drums mirror the action of two hands which, Mr Dyson said, can get clothes cleaner in 15 minutes than a normal machine can achieve in 67 minutes. Instead of \"dropping and flopping\" in one drum, they are \"much more active\" in the contrarotator. </p> <p>\"It's shocking that your hands can wash cleaner than your machine. Hands knead the fabric properly to release the dirt. With a second drum going in the other direction we can even improve on hand washing,\" Mr Dyson said. </p> <p>It took four years, a million man hours and \u00a325m to develop the machine which comes with a built-in jack and trolley and a coin trap to capture stray pennies and buttons. </p> <p>Mr Dyson, who employs 350 engineers and designers among the 1600-strong workforce at Malmesbury, last month won two notable high court victories against Hoover. </p> <p>A judge ruled that Hoover's triple vortex cleaner infringed Dyson's copyright and, 10 days later, banned the Italian-owned group from making or selling it.</p>",
  "Sue Ryder, Baroness Ryder of Warsaw, who has died aged 77, was a great crusader for humanity long before her second marriage, to Leonard Cheshire, became a parallel enterprise. She started with her intensely personal care for the sick, disabled, or otherwise suffering survivors of Nazi concentration camps and their children. <p>She was born into a happy Yorkshire family and planned to farm and breed prize cattle. But \"she always wanted to help people\", according to the mother, from whom she derived so much. Educated at Benenden school, in 1939 she gave a false age to join the First Aid Nursing Yeomanry, then went to work for the Special Operations Executive, that strange secret world into which members half-disappeared from their own families. At 18, she was married for a few weeks to a young naval officer, soon killed. </p> <p>In SOE, she lived and worked with men and women of different nations, who were smuggling themselves into occupied Europe as allied agents to probable capture, torture and death. She knew their greatest fears - whether they would be able to endure Nazi torture in interrogation; she knew the heroism of the resistance, in Poland and elsewhere, of ordinary people volunteering to help agents and allied prisoners-of-war, completely aware of what they faced. </p> <p>Thus she acquired a vast new family, and her life's course was set. She crossed into Europe in 1944 and, in 1945, saw - in the newly- liberated concentration camps - the living, dead and dying, the price that she had already known from afar, and the children they left. </p> <p>She joined relief organisations, and worked in the displaced persons camps, where, amid the ruins of Germany, people waited for permits to go to a new country. The young and strong could go, but the old, sick and disabled were regarded as wreckage. The relief organisations withdrew in 1952. Ryder stayed on, working alone. </p> <p>That year, she took some for a holiday to Norway and Denmark, with the help of former Norwegian and Danish resistance friends. Soon after, she obtained permission to bring camp survivors and former re sistance fighters to England for short holidays and treatment. She went on to establish homes for sick and disabled survivors in the European countries where hospitals had been destroyed, and holiday homes in England for people who had not known a holiday since before the war. For all this, she trusted in God and human love for funds and voluntary workers. Both came. </p> <p>In 1956, she founded the Sue Ryder Forgotten Allies Trust. Always, she felt fiercely about that forgetting, making her own work a living memorial to the millions of dead from the camps. The West German government initially refused compensation to national persecutees, resistance members, and those in the eastern European countries with which it had no diplo matic relations. In 1956, too, she made over her own home to become the centre of the work: the Old Rectory at Cavendish, Suffolk, a 16th-century house set in gardens. </p> <p>In 1959, World Refugee Year, Ryder won British government permission to bring 30 disabled survivors as permanent residents to Cavendish, on condition that she guaranteed their complete support for life. By 1965, she had established 30 homes in England, Poland, Yugoslavia, Greece and Germany, and had plans for one in Israel. Each was truly a home - some with family bungalows or flats, and no regulations. </p> <p>Ryder's firm rule for her \"bods\", her affectionate term for her life guests or workers, was designed to reverse all camp regulations. There was chintz and flowers everywhere, privacy respected, and occupation for those able to undertake work. These were all attempts to restore personality and dignity to people bearing, with other wounds, their camp tattoo numbers. Through her, \"I learned to trust people again,\" was a constant refrain. </p> <p>Ryder travelled 50,000 miles a year, often driving herself in a van, carrying medical and other supplies over Europe, directing the erection of new homes, visiting each and everyone in them, sending Christmas presents and cards, each inscribed in the recipient's own language. </p> <p>She alone remembered the \"jail birds\" - boys, Russian or Polish especially, released from the camps in 1945, their families dead, homes destroyed, flung into grim postwar Germany to live on their wits. Some stole, others took vengeance, when chance came, on SS men. Many were executed by British and American courts; others were given life sentences in German prisons. </p> <p>For lesser criminals, no provision was made for education, rehabilitation, help to employment on release, or even citizenship. Like so many, they landed on Ryder's lap. In 1955, she had founded the St Christopher Kreis to aid them, and the St Christopher Settlement in Hanover, where they could be received and helped on release. </p> <p>She got a little help from a very few Germans - notably in Hesse - and from the German Red Cross, but, generally, met obstruction from authority. She drove regularly to visit, in different prisons, men, now grown up, who had not seen a woman for years until she came and fought for them, appeared in court for them, and sought amnesties or jobs overseas. </p> <p> I n 1959, she married Group Captain (later Lord) Leonard Cheshire, VC, a meeting and marriage of common dedication to suffering humanity. Besides his work in founding the Cheshire Homes for the chronic sick, and hers for Nazi victims, together they founded the Mission for the Relief of Suffering and the Ryder-Cheshire International Centre, called Raphael, at Dehra Dun in India, for children and adults, lepers, mentally sick, orphans and others in need. Working with them was Mother Teresa. </p> <p>The two Cheshire children, Jeremy and Elizabeth, completed the happy family atmosphere at Cavendish. There was amazing normality and laughter there, although men and women lived (and died) there suffering from unique physical and nervous damage. </p> <p>In her adolescence, Ryder was a typically fair English girl, with wavy hair and a small slender figure. Her frequent light smile was indescribable, flashing against grim backgrounds, illuminating her face, shadowed, when still, with her experience. When appealing for her survivors, she could look like the woman carrying the world's sorrows. Her brilliant blue, hooded eyes blazed from under striking eyebrows. By contrast, when she turned suddenly and lifted her daughter in her arms, her smile showed the natural joy that might have been hers completely, in a different world. </p> <p>She was without fear, moral or physical, ate little, slept little, was completely indifferent to her own comfort and often looked exhausted, yet she seemed, borne on by some inner fire of strength. She dictated and signed innumerable letters, spoke at countless meetings, putting her \"chains\" on listeners to help her lastingly, appeared on radio and television, interviewed the press and always continued her personal role of \"mamusia\" - \"mother\" as the Poles called her - for each of her charges. </p> <p>She was sometimes compared with Florence Nightingale. But from the Crimea onwards, Nightingale worked with government support. Ryder's people were her own - stateless, voteless, disabled, apparently useless. She knew better. In 1965, the Polish government awarded her the Officer's Cross of the Order of Polonia Restituta, one of their highest honours. Her own country took its time to create her a baroness; it came only in 1979. </p> <p>Ryder had been ill since last year, and her last months were accompanied by disagreements over the policies of the Sue Ryder Fooundation. Last month, she set up a new charity, the Bouverie Foundation. </p> <p>Her two autobiographical books were And The Morrow Is Theirs (1975) and Child Of My Love (1986, revised 1998). Her husband died in 1992, she is survived by her son and daughter. </p> <p>\u0095 Sue Ryder, Baroness Ryder of Warsaw, campaigner and social worker, born July 3 1923; died November 2 2000</p>",
  "Sometime soon, Chris Woodhead will pack his ropes, his boots and his ice axe and head for the place he loves best, the mountains. <p>In the clear air of Snowdonia, or perhaps the Lake District, this keen climber will reflect on a career with more than its fair share of peaks, scrambles and plunges. </p> <p>There will be few rank and file teachers who will be sad to see him spend more time in the hills but his strident views on old-fashioned educational standards will, no doubt, be missed by some parents and not a few politicians. </p> <p>From day one, Mr Woodhead made it clear that he would be no friend of teachers. Indeed, even before taking up his new post he gave an interview to the Daily Mail spelling out his distaste for poor teachers. The headline read: Sack The Useless Teachers. </p> <p>Since then, he has waged war not only on teachers who are not up to the job but also on those who espouse the liberal views which he despises. </p> <p>Yet those outside the profession will probably remember Mr Woodhead not for his views but for his alleged affair with a sixth-former while teaching at the Gordano school in Portishead, near Bristol. </p> <p>The scandal broke in February last year when he was asked about student-teacher relationships. His answer was curiously equivocal: \"I don't think necessarily that a teacher should be automatically drummed out of the profession.\" </p> <p>It was the sort of answer bound to intrigue. Five years earlier, the News of the World had carried a story alleging he had a sexual relationship with pupil Amanda Johnston. His solicitors had put out a statement claiming he did not have a \"sexual relationship or any improper relationship\" with her when he was a teacher and she a pupil, though they had a relationship \"a long time afterwards\" when separated from his wife, Cathy. </p> <p>Mr Woodhead's ambiguous reply last year triggered further examination of the relationship. Amanda Johnston backed the chief inspector's version. But former colleagues emerged to cast doubt on his story. </p> <p>His ex-wife Cathy claimed that her husband did have an affair with Amanda Johnston when she was a pupil and he a teacher. Mrs Woodhead claimed that he had told her about the affair in April 1976 when their daughter was 11 months old. </p> <p>His first job was as an English teacher at Priory school, Shrewsbury. He taught in Gloucester and then became head of English at Gordano school. </p> <p>But he was not content to stay in the classroom. He became a teacher trainer at Oxford, moved into officialdom and quickly moved through the ranks. </p> <p>He has never been afraid of criticism, once saying: \"You can no more do this job and be popular than you can climb a vertical cliff and relax and feel that everything is totally safe.\"</p> <p><b>The big rows</b><br>Rebecca Smithers</p> <p><b> Incompetent teachers</b> </p> <p>In 1994 Woodhead said there were 13,000 incompetent teachers. He readily backed the naming and shaming of underperforming schools and an increasing scrutiny of pupils' examination scores. In 1998 he infuriated teachers' leaders when he said that 15,000 members of the teaching profession were \"incompetent\" and directly responsible for undermining the \"considerable improvement\" in raising standards </p> <p><b> Sex with pupils</b> </p> <p>In the spring of last year he announced that relationships between sixth-formers and teachers could be \"experiential and educative\" - at a time when the government was planning legislation to make such relationships illegal. His ex-wife subsequently claimed that his relationship with Amanda Johnston, a former pupil of his, had begun while she was still at school </p> <p> </p> <p><b> Teachers' excuses</b> </p> <p>Last November he told MPs on the education select committee that teachers were prepared to blame anybody but themselves for pupils' poor performance. Teachers in a minority of schools had low expectations of their pupils and blamed everyone else for their lack of progress. \"They blame the government for a lack of resources, they blame parents for not producing intelligent enough pupils, and they blame the collapse of western civilisation as we know it\" </p> <p> </p> <p><b> Vocational degrees</b> </p> <p>Last August he accused universities of offering \"vacuous\" courses, though he had no responsibility for higher education. He claimed universities were devaluing higher education by offering a \"plethora of quasi-academic courses\", citing examples such as media studies and beauty therapy </p> <p><b> A-levels</b> </p> <p>In September, in an interview with the Guardian, he said A-levels did not challenge the brightest pupils, and should be made more difficult. While being questioned by MPs on the education select committee on Wednesday, he admitted there was no evidence to back up his claim</p>",
  "MI5 and MI6 are planning to introduce psychological testing to identify \"adverse character traits\" among their staff, it was revealed yesterday. The move was disclosed by parliament's intelligence and security committee in its latest annual report, which is so littered with deleting asterisks as to make much of it unintelligible. <p>Its report does not mention David Shayler and Richard Tomlinson, the renegade former MI5 and MI6 officers who have tried, but failed, to address the committee about their concerns. \"The committee doesn't deal with people but with issues,\" Tom King, the former Conservative cabinet minister and chairman of the committee, said. </p> <p>However, the committee makes it clear it remains unhappy with the security and intelligence agencies' personnel policies and internal security. </p> <p>The members of the cross-party committee, all appointed by the prime minister, say MI5 and MI6 should adopt even stricter vetting procedures than those they are already planning. </p> <p>There should be more interviews of serving officers in their own homes, as part of the positive vetting process, to detect \"lifestyle mismatches and the possession of unexplained wealth\", says the committee. </p> <p>It also makes clear that MI5, MI6 and GCHQ, as well as the Defence Intelligence Staff, are not doing enough to fight organised crime, including drug traffickers and illegal immigration rings. </p> <p>\"The briefest study of Dover and Heathrow reveals immediately how fragile our present defences are, and without intelligence they would be virtually non-existent,\" Mr King tells Tony Blair in his introduction to the report. </p> <p>The report says the combined budget of MI5, MI6 and GCHQ will increase from \u00a3800m to \u00a3940m over the next three years, a rise of more than 17%. The government still refuses to allow the committee to reveal how much the individual agencies spend and how they spend it. </p> <p>However, the committee does express its concern about plans to build a new headquarters for GCHQ, the government's electronic intelligence-gathering centre in Cheltenham. The building is the biggest single item ever spent by Britain's security and intelligence agencies. It is now estimated to cost \u00a3540m, well above the original estimate of about \u00a3300m. </p> <p>This does not include what GCHQ calls transitional costs, which will amount to at least \u00a3240m, over four times the original estimate. </p> <p>The committee's report is studded with asterisks covering information suppressed by ministers and the intelligence agencies. </p> <p>It refers to a visit to the US National Reconnaissance Agency, noting: \"We believe that the UK needs to be *** to ensure the UK remains ***.\" </p> <p>The committee concludes: \"We believe that the UK cannot afford not to be involved in this work\" a reference to spy satellites. </p> <p>The report chides Mr Blair for never having called a meeting of the cabinet's committee on the intelligence services. </p> <p>\u0095A former Russian security service member seeking political asylum in Britain was being questioned yesterday by special branch officers after saying he feared for his life in Moscow. </p> <p>Alexander Litvinenko flew to Britain with his wife and child on Wednesday, the day the Russian authorities announced they wanted to arrest his patron, the Russian media and oil tycoon Boris Berezovsky.</p>",
  "<p><strong> The ad:</strong> <br>A young mother is sitting in a restaurant with her son, speaking to camera about how much better off she is on the government's new Working Families Tax Credit. A passing waiter overhears her, then grinds to a halt and beams, happy at the thought of extracting a better tip. Another mum is standing by an ice cream van talking about her extra cash. The van suddenly starts blaring loud music, trying to grab her attention. We then cut to a family in a used car dealership, where an opportunistic salesman sneakily puts the price of a car up.

  "George W Bush has the wind in his sails, and seen close to he looks as if he knows it. Striding across the midwest battleground in the past two days, he has had a spring in his step, a serenity in his manner and a confidence in his voice that all say the same thing: he is aware that he stands on history's threshold. He thinks he has got it. <p>Mr Bush's lead in the national polls is narrow but persistent. Al Gore's campaign team can produce a detailed and almost plausible explanation of why their man will still pull it off on Tuesday by winning in the key states, but their theories are all crippled by the same devastating objection: Mr Bush is in the lead and he is not doing anything at all to throw it away. </p> <p>Even the weather gods seem to be on his side as his campaign plane, Responsibility One, pulls up on the tarmac at Minneapolis after a gruelling flight from Seattle. </p> <p>It has been raining all morning and the clouds are low, but now the sun breaks through, with perfect timing, to produce a mini-masterpiece of political theatre. </p> <p>A college band strikes up a swaggering rendition of the theme from Mission: Impossible and the crowd who have been waiting here for nearly two hours catch the feel of the moment and shout themselves hoarse. </p> <p>Chris Kavkashian says he is surprised at himself for coming out to see the Bush bandwagon roll through the \"airport event\" which typifies the frenzied final days of presidential campaigning. </p> <p>\"I'll tell you why I'm here in one word,\" he says. \"Integrity. That man has it. Gore hasn't. He and Clinton, they just do things any way they want to.\" </p> <p>Words like integrity, responsibility and character have been scattered across the speeches of Republican politicians throughout this presidential campaign. They are the euphemisms the party has settled on to raise the Clinton question without seeming negative, and without reminding middle-of-the-road voters about the Republican fanatics whose sole public project for the past eight years has been to drive the Democratic president from office. </p> <p>The issue is always somewhere in the speeches, though it is never allowed to dominate or get out of control. Yet Mr Kavkashian's focus seems typical of the crowd waiting for Mr Bush. Only one in about a dozen people interviewed at random chooses taxes as the most important reason for supporting Bush in the election. The rest, in one way or another, all choose character. </p> <p>\"All the shenanigans of the the last eight years embarrassed me personally as an American,\" says Barbara Martin. </p> <p>\"I think Bush would put integrity back in the White House.\" </p> <p>\"He's a bit of personality. He's the kind of guy you'd like to hang out with,\" says Chuck McShane. \"I'd have preferred John McCain. If McCain had run, this election wouldn't have been close, even in Minnesota. But half a loaf is better than no bread.\" </p> <p>When he reaches the stage, Mr Bush does not say much about character. He doesn't need to. It would make him look too mean. His message, emblazoned in huge yellow letters on a blue banner behind him, is \"Bringing America Together\". </p> <p>He concentrates on his tax cut plans, and he spends much of his time attacking Mr Gore as a big spender. </p> <p>\"You are looking at 285 federal programmes that my opponent promises to create or expand,\" he says as aides pull aside a curtain to reveal a huge list headed \"Gore Proposes More Big Government\". </p> <p>Gore's promises add up to \"the largest expansion of government in 35 years\", he says. He would go on a \"$2 trillion spending spree\". </p> <p>By this stage in the campaign the messages have been reduced to the barest of essentials. \"He trusts government. I trust you,\" Mr Bush repeats, echoing Ronald Reagan 20 years ago. But where Reagan regularly trashed the whole idea of government, Mr Bush is more careful. \"We believe in government that knows its limits, but shows its heart.\" </p> <p>But where Mr Bush fears to tread, others rush in. Long before he arrives, and before most of the media check in to hear what he says, the Republican candidate for one of Minnesota's congressional seats shows fewer scruples. </p> <p>Mark Kennedy tells the crowd a story. Bill Clinton is desperate to secure his presidential legacy, he says. He can't sleep. As Clinton writhes, George Washington appears to him in a dream. What should I do to secure my legacy, Clinton asks. \"Always tell the truth. Never tell a lie,\" Washington tells him. The crowd roars. </p> <p>The next night Clinton dreams again. This time Thomas Jefferson appears to him. Clinton asks about his legacy. Jefferson answers quickly: \"Cut taxes and give government back to the people.\" They roar again. </p> <p>Now Clinton has a third dream. This time it is Abraham Lincoln's turn to be asked the question. What should Clinton do to assure his legacy? Lincoln thinks for a long time, and then speaks. \"Go to the theatre,\" he says. </p> <p>A crowd who would undoubtedly say without a moment's hesitation that they represent mainstream American values cheer with delight at the thought that Bill Clinton might be shot dead. </p> <p>It is a mark of Mr Bush's confidence that in the campaign's final days he should be in Minnesota, an idiosyncratic but generally Democratic state which has not voted for a Republican presidential candidate since 1972. </p> <p>But this is the state that elected the wrestler Jesse Ventura, an independent, as governor two years ago, and these are counter-intuitive times in American politics. A poll this week showed Mr Gore still ahead in Minnesota, but only by 44% to 41%. </p> <p>The Green candidate, Ralph Nader, whose running mate Winona LaDuke lives in Minnesota, is strengthening his challenge and has risen in the polls to 8%. Mr Nader could hand Minnesota to Mr Bush.</p> <p><b>On the stump yesterday</b></p> <p><b>George W Bush</b> </p> <p>Four midwest battleground states in a single day, starting in <b>Des Moines, Iowa</b>.

  "Honda is now the latest in a long line of Japanese manufacturers to say that Britain being out of the euro is having an impact on their profitability (Honda blames weak euro for putting super-mini on ice, November 1). <p>Nissan, Panasonic, Hitachi, Oki, and Sony are all facing serious difficulties because the UK is outside the euro, with some of the companies having announced job losses. </p> <p>Honda's decision to scrap plans to produce the \"super-mini\" car here is a clear indication that whether or not the UK is in the euro, there is no cost-free option in government dithering on the issue. </p> <p>All of this shows that there is clear evidence now that the anti-Europeans are wrong when they say that inward investment is safe if Britain rules out euro membership. </p> <p>Already France's share of inward investent has risen 11% whilst Britian's has fallen 14%. We are losing out by staying out of the euro; the government must do more to get us in. <br><b> Robert Coppinger</b><br> St Neots, Cambs </p> <p>There is a striking contrast between the blanket coverage of US elections, in which we have no vote, and the article about global minority rule (Debate, October 30). Britain is one of the unelected rulers, so our government does have a say in how international institutions are run. </p> <p>The Guardian could do much more to expose the undemocratic, exclusive and unjust international system in which we all collude. But then, we all benefit from the cheap clothes and commodities which minority rule provides. The pitiful low wages, long hours and lack of public services for those who produce them is not our problem, is it? </p> <p>Let's have a serious, in-depth debate about global democracy, because the future of the planet depends on it. Excluding the majority of the world's people from real decision-making in world affairs is not a long-term option. <br><b> Titus Alexander</b><br> London <a href=\"mailto:info@charter99.org\">info@charter99.org</a> </p> <p>How excellent that the UK is taking action to support UN peacekeeping operations (Marines head for Sierra Leone, October 31).

  "<p>The Marquis de Sade seems to be in mode this season, what with the recent re-release of Pasolini's Salo, and now two festival screenings of films about French literature's leading reprobate. Benoit Jacquot's Sade has Daniel Auteuil as a Byronic and rather benign philosopher, casting a chilly eye on the excesses of the revolutionary terror going on around him. Where Jacquot's sober study primarily addresses history and ideas, Philip Kaufman's very different Quills is a flamboyant pantomime farce that portrays Sade as both pornographer and political dissident, and writer above all. </p> <p>Where Jacquot's film has the Marquis as the inmate of an aristocratic clinic - a pampered refuge for protected nobs - Quills, adapted by Doug Wright from his own play, is set in Charenton asylum. Sade (Geoffrey Rush) busily pumps out scandalous texts from his cell, smuggled out by laundress Madeleine (Kate Winslet). His activity is tolerated by the hospital's idealistic young director, the Abb\u00e9 Coulmier (Joaquin Phoenix), but a corrupt new enforcer (Michael Caine) is soon brought in to shut off his flow of lascivious outpourings. </p> <p>The film's robust, sometimes near-hysterical gusto places it somewhere between Fellini, Hogarth and a Carry On film. In fact, you can just imagine Jim Dale as the blushing Coulmier, and Geoffrey Rush looks gnarled enough to be mistaken for Sid James. But the boisterous, salty larking - at its height when Sade writes a scabrous stage satire - has a serious point. This is very much a debate on censorship, presenting Sade as a sexual and ideological refusenik deprived of his right to expression. But neither he nor his work is idealised, and the grand guignol climax awkwardly poses the question of the author's responsibility for his writing's effect. </p> <p>The least you can say about Quills is that it tackles contentious material with which Hollywood wouldn't dirty its hands. Its tendency to sensationalise, sometimes in full Hammer-horror style, is at least in keeping with that audacity. Flamboyant performances from a deluxe cast - also including a barely recognisable Billie Whitelaw - mix dignity and full-blooded excess, stopping the film from spelling things out too schematically. Salo may still be the most challenging screen treatment of the Marquis' writing, but Quills is a bold attempt at a dark, provocative and hardly sedate Sade. </p> <p>\u00c7 Quills, tonight at the Odeon West End; Sade, tomorrow at the Odeon West End and Monday at the Cin\u00e9 Lumi\u00e8re.
