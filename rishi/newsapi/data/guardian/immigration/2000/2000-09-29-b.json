  "<p>The Glaswegian cab driver is in full flow, stretching his vowels to show his contempt. \"Celtic fan myself; can't stand anyone who played for Rangers,\" he says, and then pauses. \"Except for that Jonatan Johansson; he was pure class. Would have liked to see him play for us.\" </p> <p>\"Celtic fan compliments ex-Rangers player\" is up there with \"Chelsea sign English striker\" in the rarity stakes, but then Charlton's new Finnish striker, who is expected to start against England in the World Cup qualifier on Wednesday week, is garnering praise from any number of unlikely sources. </p> <p>Since arriving at the Valley in the summer in a \u00a33.25m deal, Johansson has scored six times in seven games. His pace and intelligence have given an extra dimension to a Charlton team who previously relied on the more modest charms of Andy Hunt, and who currently stand fifth in the Premiership. Hardly the whipping boys identified by so many pre-season pundits. </p> <p>Finland, too, have been dismissed as rank outsiders, but Johansson believes his side may pull off a shock next week in Helsinki. \"Naturally England should win. They have a more professional set-up while we have hardly any league structure in Finland. England have some outstanding players, but still they might find it difficult to play us at home. </p> <p>\"I don't want to be critical of any of their players but I think maybe they are little slow at the back. Their defenders are good but they're getting old and perhaps we might be able to use that.\" </p> <p>Johansson believes Kevin Keegan's side may also be surprised by the fervent atmosphere. Football is not the main sport in Finland, where ice hockey is revered, but Finns grow up watching English football on television and often support a Premiership side. </p> <p>\"We're all very excited about playing England,\" he says, \"but we do not intend just to turn up, lose and go home again. The stadium is very small and it will be packed. It's very inspiring to hear all those fans chanting for you, so yes, you never know, maybe we will pull off an upset.\" </p> <p>Johansson's decision to quit the high life at Rangers for south London raised a few eyebrows over the summer, yet the Charlton manager Alan Curbishley calls his transfer \"the easiest signing I have ever made. He knew all about the club, really wanted to play for us. I've never seen a player so eager to sign.\" </p> <p>For his part, Johansson believes he \"had done everything I could with Rangers. When Walter Smith brought me to Scotland it was great, but I had won the Scottish League and the Scottish Cup and it was time to move on. </p> <p>\"Also, after my injury [he broke his ankle after the end of his second season at Ibrox] I missed a lot of games and it was more difficult to break back into the side. Then I looked at the strikers there and thought I would never start in the first team. So it seemed the right time to go.\" </p> <p>Even so, Curbishley's unfancied club were not the only ones sniffing around the talented 25-year-old. For a player whose career path had been a straightforward upward trajectory - from the Finnish side TPS Turku to Estonia's Flora Tallinn to Rangers - the choice seemed unusual. Johansson smiles, as though aware his next sentence might generate mild sniggers among more cynical readers. </p> <p>\"There was never really any choice,\" he says. \"From the minute I met the chairman and the manager of Charlton I knew it was the club I wanted to play for. I believed in their plans for the club and want to be part of those plans.\" </p> <p>So Charlton won't be going straight back down then? Johansson looks horrified at the thought. \"We have a lot of good players here,\" he says. \"Mark Kinsella is very good. Claus Jensen. Dean Kiely in goal. The set-up is very exciting and I really believe we will become a very successful club. </p> <p>\"It's all to do with the attitude here. It's so much nicer playing for a smaller club. Rangers were successful but it was, perhaps, a little less friendly. People would talk to you, but until I met my girlfriend, Jean, it wasn't as easy to settle. Since I arrived here, however, everyone has been wonderful. They've all been friendly and it's so much more relaxed.\" </p> <p>As an example of how this atmosphere is working wonders on the pitch too, Johansson recalls Charlton's recent 1-0 victory over Spurs. \"We went a goal up and I thought the manager would tell us to close the game down in the second half. That is what would have happened in Scotland. </p> <p>\"Instead he told us to go out and continue enjoying ourselves and not to change our play. To me that summed up being here; we are playing attractive football, enjoying ourselves and succeeding.\"</p>",
  "<p>One of the numbers in Andrew Lloyd Webber and Ben Elton's new musical, sung when its heroes have just won a cup final with their amateur football team, includes the following celebratory lyrics: </p> <p>Let's get fall-on-the-floor drunk </p> <p>Stomach-pumping drunk </p> <p>Pickling-your-brain drunk. </p> <p>At last, then, an evening at the theatre to which Paul Gascoigne can relate. That song, incidentally, is entirely representative of the piece. Short of quoting Gazza's message to Norway, Ben Elton's tale about football across the sectarian divide contains perhaps the most robust set of lyrics ever to be found in a musical. </p> <p>Certainly the collaboration with his new partner has left Lord Lloyd Webber with significantly more vernacular than he was used to setting to music when he was working with that nice cricket fan Tim Rice. \"I wonder if there is any chance you might be my bird / If you want me to bugger off just say the word,\" runs one couplet. And that's in a love song. </p> <p>Lloyd Webber should be thrilled. His turgid, sentimental and derivative tunes (odd how they all have such familiarity the first time you hear them) have at last been hitched to a worthwhile plot and set of lyrics. Moreover, thanks to Elton, his Lordship has achieved the most unlikely of triumphs: this is a production that makes football work on stage. And that is thanks not only to the earthy lyrics and the excellent choreography mixing football moves with ballet (sadly, there is no mention of Dennis Wise as a consultant). It is down to the fact that Elton has resisted all temptation to make triumph in sport result in success in life. </p> <p>The problems of trying to capture the drama of sport in an imaginative context are generally summed up by the phrase Escape to Victory. Usually, as in all those straight-to-video movies about high school baseball teams and second-rate ice hockey clubs, the plot entirely hinges upon the achievement of improbable success, the moment of success bringing with it redemption, self-knowledge and the righting of all sorts of injustice. </p> <p>The recent British film There's Only One Jimmy Grimble (which lasted about as long at the box office as Chelsea did in Europe) paraded all the problems: from the moment it began, the audience just knew that the plot would conclude with Jimmy's team not only winning against the odds, but that in doing so everything would be resolved in the hero's life. And indeed, even as Jim found the net, his mother found true love, his coach found new purpose and his school found lottery funding for a new sports hall. Though to be fair, the final frame was of Jimmy landing a contract with Manchester City, so not everything in the garden was rosy. </p> <p>Ben Elton, though, is too wise a bird to fall for this. Instead of trying to replicate the drama of sport in his plot with last-gasp winners and penalties scored by unlikely heroes, the football is almost incidental to his tale. In the Beautiful Game, the football is not a metaphor for life, just a part of it. In Elton's story, set in Northern Ireland at the start of the Troubles, his team do indeed win the cup, but it happens early in the first half of the show. It is a success - carefree and innocent - which casts a poignant pall over the rest of the plot, as the team members embroil themselves in sectarianism. The message is: if only life could be as simple as football. </p> <p>It is a pity Elton's insight is not more widely shared. Particularly down under. The way Cathy Freeman's victory in the 400m was received in Australia suggested that far too many observers were confused into thinking they were watching a film. Her victory, apparently, will right a million wrongs, resolve a century of injustice, permanently unite a nation. That kind of easy resolution happens only at the conclusion of bad sports films. </p> <p>As it happens, runners don't do much more than win races. The casual linguistic racism that pockmarks the conversation of far too much of Australian society (from long jumpers to leading politicians) will not disappear simply because an Aborigine landed a gold medal. Just as, sadly, victory for a multi-racial French football team on home soil in the 1998 World Cup has not reduced the National Front to a withered, embarrassed husk. </p> <p>As Ben Elton so accurately points out in that most unlikely setting of a piece of musical theatre, sport is an escape from reality. That is why these games have been such fun to watch. In our modern lives of fudge and compromise, there is nothing to beat plunging into a world in which grey areas do not exist, a place where everything is reduced to one simple opposition: victory or defeat.</p>",
  "Who said union interference in Labour conferences was wrong? Yesterday, under pressure from the Transport and General Workers' Union, the government agreed to an immediate review of one of its most egregious programmes: the voucher scheme under which asylum seekers are no longer provided with social security benefits, but given vouchers for food and essentials instead. <p>What the House of Lords, Lib Dem opposition and the refugee lobby groups were unable to achieve, the brute strength of the TGWU's card vote forced ministers to concede. They have agreed to the review and to change the demeaning rule that denied refugees from receiving change when their purchases fall short of the value of the voucher - a rule which embarrassed supermarkets, opening them to accusations of \"profiteering\". </p> <p>Ministers have defended the scheme on the grounds that it would deter economic migrants from coming to Britain. This was always absurd. People in far away Iran or Iraq do not select Britain for asylum because of its social security system. Several continental countries are far more generous to asylum seekers than the UK. The latest statistics show it was absurd. There has been no drop-off in applicants since the scheme was introduced. </p> <p>The main reason for opposing the scheme is its inhumanity. Bill Morris, the TGWU leader, spoke movingly yesterday of a shopping trip he had made with a 30-year-old GP from Iran seeking asylum and the shame that vouchers generated. </p> <p>But there are practical reasons too. By withdrawing benefits from asylum seekers, ministers not only had to create a new currency (the voucher), but a new social security distribution system too. The waste, duplication, and cumbersome bureaucracy created to deliver this unnecessary service, is an indictment of the entire ministerial team. The TGWU made only one mistake: they should have insisted on an immediate end to the scheme.</p>",
  "Refugees' rights campaigners yesterday hailed government concessions on its asylum seekers' voucher scheme as a breakthrough, after union leader Bill Morris agreed to spare ministers a second conference defeat. <p>The TGWU general secretary backed a united Labour party national executive statement after the Home Office minister, Barbara Roche, confirmed the government would immediately review the scheme and would scrap the \"no change\" rule that denies asylum seekers cash back on unspent voucher value. </p> <p>Mr Morris told delegates that the vouchers were \"fuel for the ugly face of racism and discrimination\" and said that the no change rule was creating a \"grotesque black market\" under which asylum seekers subsidised supermarkets. </p> <p>Ms Roche was conciliatory, insisting that refugees should be given every support in the country \"they now call home\" with better access to health and education, and Mr Morris agreed to remit his union's motion opposing the vouchers. </p> <p>At present, asylum seekers get vouchers worth 70% of income support to buy essentials from selected shops, but are not allowed any change if the goods cost less than the value of a voucher. Critics argue that vouchers stigmatise asylum seekers, and make them visible targets for harassment. </p> <p>Both union leaders and refugee organisations said after yesterday's debate that they believed the review would lead to an end of the system, but tranport union sources said pressure would be required to keep the government to its promise of an immediate and comprehensive review. </p> <p>Tony Blair is said to be concerned at the impact of vouchers on asylum seekers and their relations with communities, but Home Office ministers had resisted any retreat, arguing that it was a \"young policy\" that needed time before being assessed. Downing Street officials have been in negotiations this week with the TGWU and Home Office.</p>",
  "<b> Good week </b> <p> <b> Labour</b> in general. The party went into conference eight points behind but, after a Times poll yesterday, came out two points ahead. </p> <p><b> Barbara Castle</b> - described by social security minister Jeff Rooker as \"this goddess of our movement\" - who successfully rallied the conference to defeat the government over its pensions policy. </p> <p><b> The unions</b>, for proving their muscle as they brought about a conference defeat over pensions, although the government still refused to bow to their pressure. </p> <p> More specifically, <b> Bill Morris</b>, the TGWU leader, who won his personal crusade to ensure asylum seekers can receive change from their vouchers. </p> <p><b> Antiperspirant makers</b>: Sure sent 100 cans to Tony Blair after the strain of giving his speech - seen by many as the most crucial so far of his premiership - revealed all too clearly the necessity of spraying liberally. </p> <p><b> Bad week </b></p> <p><b>Mo Mowlam</b>, attending her final party conference as an MP. Not only did she have to endure a mawkish video tribute to \"Our Mo\", she lost her glasses and was forced to borrow ones so strong they made her feel woozy. </p> <p><b> Lady Jay</b>, the minister for women, whose reputation for haughtiness was not enhanced when she told delegates she understood rural issues because she had a \"little cottage in the country.\" </p> <p><b> Lord Falconer</b>, the dome minister, who was forced to make his greatest admission of regret yet over the beleaguered structure at the Guardian debate on Monday-- though he still refused to apologise for it. </p> <p><b> Pro-hunt protesters,</b> whose daily protests outside the conference centre won their cause no favours. \"Every time I see the Countryside Alliance's contorted faces, I redouble my determination to abolish fox hunting,\" deputy prime minister John Prescott said to loud cheers. </p> <p><b> John Prescott</b> He may have roused the party faithful with a barn storming speech yesterday but he also showed his lack of street cred. Thanking the singer Gabrielle for her rendition of Dreams, he went one worse than junior cabinet office minister Ian McCartney who failed to clap in time, and mispronounced her name. </p> <p><b> Jokes of the week</b></p> <p><b>Nelson Mandela</b> in self-deprecatory mode: \"Tony, you know that the only reason people are here is curiosity. They want to see what a pensioner from the colonies looks like.\" </p> <p><b> John Prescott</b> telling delegates the fight for the next election would take: \"Blood and tears - we won't mention sweat. You should worry,\" he added, to laughter. \"He put his arm around me!\" </p> <p><b> Delegate of the week</b></p> <p>Alison Fairgrieve, 63, retired teacher, from West Suffolk. \"This is my first conference, and I only joined the party three years ago.I started off the week feeling a little cynical, a little jaundiced, and a little manipulated. But after this week I perceive nothing but sincerity from these politicians - and nobody could fail to be impressed by Tony Blair's speech. It was worth standing for that performance. I did come here feeling very angry about the price of fuel - but my mind has changed to some extent. But as someone who can't live on my pension, I was disappointed by the failure to restore the link. I have to say I voted for it. So I guess that makes me an old lefty.\" </p> <p><b> Key moments</b></p> <p> <b> Monday</b> Gordon Brown's speech won a rousing four and a half minute ovation as he pledged to raise the basic minimum state pension, even though he refused to restore the earnings link. The applause increased when his new bride Sarah Brown, resplendent in red, joined him on the platform - though the kiss was more of a peck than a Gore-style clinch. </p> <p><b> Tuesday</b> Tony Blair effectively launched Labour's general election campaign - and wooed back many of the disaffected - with an impassioned, and sweaty, performance, in which he repeatedly stressed: \"We are listening.\" </p> <p><b> Wednesday</b> Despite the support for the chancellor on Monday, the government was defeated on pensions after a day of high tension and wheeler dealing. </p> <p><b> Thursday</b> Nelson Mandela - the hero of the conference - brought the week to an emotional close as he spoke of members of the Labour party being remembered for eternity. Before he even opened his mouth, he received a seven-minute standing ovation.</p>",
  "<p>When it comes to literary cuisine I've always been a believer in what Italians call 'il slow-food'. So how did I get into this position? It began, appropriately enough, in Greece. In 1991 the Greek government invited me there to help celebrate 2,500 years of Hellenic Democracy (with a few gaps). Owing to the importance of poetry in Greek, the centrepiece of the celebrations was a sumptuously hosted World Conference of Poets.</p> <p>Of this conference I chiefly remember a glorious feast of multilingual conversations. At one table on the first night a would-be Byronic poet from Scandinavia was dropping lines like \"For me the beauty of the world is concentrated in all women.\" I caught a wink from a tall Greek who seemed to be in the entourage of the Minister for Culture. \"Are you a poet too?\", I asked him. \"No, I labour in the Minister.\" \"Oh, you work in the Ministry for Culture?\" \"As I said. I labour in the Minister. I am his surgeon.\"</p> <p>In the course of the conference I made several Greek friends, and I learned from them that they were hoping to see the office of Olympic poet revived when Greece next got the Olympic Games. In fact this will not happen until 2004, as Sydney got them first.</p> <p>It then occurred to me that there was no need to wait till 2004. I had just written a book of verse on the Snowy Mountains region of Australia, more or less on commission from National Parks. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office had recently imported me to Britain to open its Breath of Fresh Air environmental conference on Britain's (still surprisingly numerous) overseas territories. That too had involved having the right poems to hand on the right themes. </p> <p>So, having proved that, on a sufficiently interesting topic, I could write more or less to order, I felt bold enough to put forward my name. I talked to my friend Les Murray, another obvious candidate, who encouraged me to proceed. He remarked that he was disqualifying himself on a technicality: \"I can't stand sport.\"</p> <p>What I still needed to find was a conspicuously literate politician to take up the idea. The obvious candidate was the Premier of New South Wales, Bob Carr. He heads the State government responsible for staging the Olympics, and is also one of the most well-read politicians in the English-speaking world. Then, like a sign from the gods that this project was meant to be, I opened the Sydney Morning Herald one morning to find an article by Bob Carr titled \"My best books of the year\" - in which he praised one of my own books to the skies. </p> <p>I phoned up his minders and asked to speak to the Premier. \"Not possible,\" they said bluntly. \"Well, can I speak to Bob Carr the literary critic?\" They relented so far as to take my number. \"But don't expect anything.\" Ten minutes later the Premier phoned me back. He listened to the idea and encouraged me to proceed. </p> <p>Eventually, with his blessing the Australia Council gave me their largest fellowship - $40,000 to spend a year writing a book of verse on all aspects of the Sydney 2000 Games. The Australian media were immediately fascinated. Somehow the idea of an Olympic poet or of a poet laureate (another idea which is now being mooted for Australia) turns literature into news.</p> <p>But this brought dangers. The next day I was under the shower when the phone rang. It was the Australian Broadcasting Commission's main radio program on politics. Could I give them a poem about the topical issue of people being mailed Olympic tickets for the wrong events? And could they record it in 15 minutes? I said I'd think about it while finishing the shower...</p> <p> 'Hush! Can you hear? <br> - All over the suburbs, the roar<br> of envelopes tearing? And Yes!, at Number 10<br> It's Gold! Gold! Gold! for the Protheros! <br> They've lit a fire. They're dancing on the lawn. <br> - Not so good at Number 15. <br> The Grampolis are bit bronzed off. <br> They thrill to the shrill of the soccer ref's whistle. <br> Hard luck! It's the Lady's Nude Luge for them!<br> </p> <p>Still, writing poems under that sort of pressure was a recipe for mediocrity, and I let it be known that there would be no more \"instant\" poems.</p> <p>How do you do a year's writing on an event that is over in less than a month? One answer is to start early. The Sydney Games were preceded by the world's longest torch relay. Since these were billed as the Green Games, it made sense to follow the Olympic flame on its 100-day route round the continent. That way I could write about all the environments, human and non-human, the flame went through.</p> <p>I envisaged a leisurely experience of Australia following flame-bearing joggers who moved at 8kms an hour. The reality was different. For one thing, the flame was run only about 50 kms a day (100 runners, doing a half kilometre each). That was what the media showed. What you didn't see was the Olympic flame sitting in first-class with a gas mantle on its head and flying like the clappers. </p> <p>I had to drive 5,000 kilometres for my first two sightings of the flame, one in central Australia at Uluru (Ayers Rock) near Alice Springs, and the next on the Queensland coast near Brisbane. In Uluru I wrote a comic symbolic poem about the Olympic caravan meeting the timeless Dreamtime world:</p> <p> <strong>Zeus 2000 meets the Elder</strong> (for Connie) </p> <p> Magically, languidly, taxiing South from Olympus, <br> descending at last by local willy-willy<br> the big blond fellow was down with a cat-like bound, <br> strode through the campfires, and stuck out his hand: <br> 'You're the Uluru elders? I'm Zeus; <br> God of Gods, CEO of Skyfather Estates, <br> and Patron of three sacred games<br> through my subsidiary Hera-Juno. <br> Hello? You're a silent lot. <br> Not seen a god without pants before? Well, look away. <br> Mind you, it feels cool. Got your seasons scrambled? <br> Makes a god feel shrunk - not that nymphs complain! <br> Say, you do great burnt offerings here! Smells yummy, <br> like you burn the whole country, herds and all. <br> Suits me. I'm a steak-loving god. 'Well, no beating about the burning bush - I deal<br> in godships. Local deities are history. <br> The word now is amalgamate. Like my card says: <br> Second only to Brahma, but we try harder. <br> So - you got any locals might like to roll under my wing? <br> Thousands have. And it works. Even I, back yonks, <br> was just a local ford demon... </p> <p>Sport, of course, is an issue on which Australians are deeply divided. Australia has more than its share of sports fanatics, yet more people left Sydney for the Olympic period than arrived. Perhaps not all would have endorsed Barry Humphries' definition of sport as \"a loathsome and dangerous occupation\"; yet my observation is that a good 30% of Australians want nothing to do with the Olympic Games. Indeed even Premier Bob Carr, the man ultimately in charge of the Games, has made no attempt to pretend that he is a sports fan. As the Classical Companion sourly remarks, it is something of a mystery how Pindar managed to make great poetry \"from the monotonous and unpromising material of athletic victories\".</p> <p>Most sports are zero-sum games: what the winners gain is stripped from the losers, so that the results for which they strive spread exaltation and depression equally among the fans, with no overall gain. Sport, like poetry, makes nothing happen - even if it turns over enough money to make executives wish to tamper. Yet the very fact that we are not quite serious about sport gives a poet one important freedom: to experiment with a range of verse forms.</p> <p>Since the late 19th century, when Whitman and Hardy noticed (on opposite sides of the Atlantic) that English was no longer an iambic language, it has been difficult to write in regular rhythm; and therefore it has also been difficult to write in rhyme. </p> <p>This of course applies only to serious topics. For comedy one can still poodle-clip the language back into the old metres (the most extreme form being the limerick). Much of the public has never forgiven poets for abandoning rhyme and rhythm; and poets who do want to use rhyme often choose therefore to write, even on serious topics, in a semi-comic mode. Sport, because we know it is really only play, lends itself to such treatment.</p> <p>By contrast, the victory of the Aboriginal runner Cathy Freeman in the 400 metres was serious national business, and demanded free verse. Her chief rival Marie-Jos&amp;#eacute Perec of France had cracked under the pressures of expectation. She fled the Olympic Games after suffering what seemed like a breakdown. For Freeman, who carried the hopes of Aboriginal Australia, the pressures were even more intense. </p> <p>Half an hour after her victory, which came late in the evening, I phoned the Australian Broadcasting Commission to say I thought I had an 'Ode to Cathy Freeman' coming on. With some trepidation, I was booked to read it on national radio just after the 8am news next morning. After all, I told myself, skilled journalists are expected to produce their finest at an hour or two's notice, so why should a poet need the Horatian nine years to get a poem right?</p> <p>Back home I repented of that rashness. There were two or three different poems fighting their way through my head, and it was not till 2am that I had something to read next morning. It began:</p> <p>'Running into that ocean roar of welcome<br> with the face of a hurt child striving,</p> <p>among tense rival queens<br> whose castles are built of milliseconds, <br> you came from behind.</p> <p>Go Phantom! <br> Our own corroboree-striped Phantom, <br> ghost who runs in pain<br> - to a lap of honor with a double flag. <br> Then the pain of great tears about to start . . .'</p> <p>I had chanced on the same approach as Pindar. Unlike the sports commentators, who tell you the mechanics of how an athlete wins, I had concentrated on what winning and losing mean.</p> <p>The Olympics has been a rushed and sleepless time for me. I have had more media attention in a fortnight than a poet would normally expect in a lifetime - and there were times when I felt I was under more pressure than Perec or Freeman. It has been hard to finish poems under such media scrutiny, and while retaining a properly professional relationship to the various Olympic bodies - neither antagonised nor duchessed by them. Yet I believe I have drafted enough good ideas to keep me busy for six months revising them, and to make in the end a small book of worthwhile poems. By then the Olympics will no longer be topical, and the poems must stand on their merits.</p> <p>I hope that in 2004 the Greeks will appoint an Olympic poet of their own, and that future host countries will follow suit. It will at worst produce mere occasional verse - and the odd bard who cracks under the media pressure. At best, the still small voice of the individual poet may counter the bland triumphalism of the Olympic media - and may find a human meaning in this most bizarre of human activities: the solemn playing of pointless yet (for some of us) deeply satisfying games.</p>",
  "Speculation is mounting that a front-bench Conservative MP is about to be outed. The rumours follow a report in the gay press that a group of \"progressive Conservatives\" - if that is not a contradiction in terms - plan to out several Tory MPs over the next few weeks. Outing is a difficult one. I tend to think one's private life is nobody else's business. But if you are pretending to be something you are not while standing for public office or if you support anti-gay laws while actually being a closet gay yourself, it's a bit easier to defend. Not according to the BBC who have banned all mention of the rumoured outing on its news broadcasts. <p>Hardly a dry eye in the house for Nelson Mandela. Even hardened hacks were seen with moistening eyes as the grand old man of the South African liberation struggle walked arm-in-arm with Tony Blair on to the stage. The anti-apartheid struggle was for many of us an important part of our political education. It was an uplifting end to an up-and-down week.</p> <p>Brighton has a number of advantages over Blackpool, one of which is the weather. Not so this week as storm after storm lashed the south coast. The roof of one hotel housing a number of BBC folk couldn't cope. I hear World At One presenter, Nick Clarke, had to move rooms in the early hours of yesterday because water was pouring through the ceiling on to his bed.</p> <p>In the aftermath of Wednesday's defeat on pensions, there was much anger directed towards the union baron John Edmonds from ordinary delegates in the hall. Two-thirds of constituency delegates supported the Government's position, but the unions won because of the block vote. This makes it even less likely that the Government will give Edmonds what he wants. Contrast that to the sensible way Bill Morris of the T and G handled the vouchers for asylum seekers issue. His grace and tact are far more likely to extract concessions from ministers.</p>",
  "Denmark last night said a resounding No to the euro after a cliffhanging referendum whose result will narrow Tony Blair's choices over the single currency and encourage the development of a \"two-speed\" Europe, leaving Britain in the slow lane. <p>With 99% of votes counted, TV projections showed 53% against and 47% for, promising a comfortable final majority for jubilant nej-sayers.</p> <p>The result immediately echoed across the EU and beyond, with the euro starting to drop in late trading in New York.</p> <p>Romano Prodi, the president of the European Commission, did his best to put a brave face on the outcome but had to admit that he was disappointed.</p> <p>\"The EU is obviously not happy about this result but it will continue on its path which has produced exceptional results,\" he said last night. \"I don't think the Danish economy will in future benefit from this decision.\"</p> <p>In an aside which is certain to anger Tony Blair, Mr Prodi seemed to signal that the Danish vote may now open the way to something which Britain vehemently opposes - a two-speed Europe in which a small core of so-called pioneer countries race ahead of the laggards who cannot make up their minds. </p> <p>Reinforced cooperation as it is called is now very much on the cards, he suggested, but he was at pains to stress that this was not an exclusive club and that membership was open to all.</p> <p>Mr Blair insisted that the knife-edge decision of the 4m deeply divided Danish voters would not affect his long-standing policy on the euro. \"Denmark has got its own decision and we have got our own decision,\" he said.</p> <p>But the Conservative leader, William Hague,said: \"This vote blows out of the water Labour's scare tactics on the euro.</p> <p>\"They claimed that Britain would be isolated if we keep the pound. We are not. They claimed euro membership was inevitable. It is not. They claimed Europe must be one size fits all. It must not.\"</p> <p>Other EU leaders put a brave face on the news, claiming it would not have a significant effect. \"I hope that ... people around Europe will perceive this as a purely Danish decision,\" said Sweden's prime minister, Goran Persson, who like Mr Blair has to decide whether to call a referendum.</p> <p>Lionel Jospin, the French prime minister, said: \"The Danes are making their choice as a sovereign people. I have a lot of respect for this country, but its size for the European economy is not major.\"</p> <p>As champagne corks popped in the folketing, Pia Kjaersgaard, the head of the far-right, anti-immigration Danish People's party, struck a note of undisguised triumph. \"The rest of Europe should look at Denmark and see what we feel,\" she said. \"We should not move ahead so quickly.\"</p> <p>Glum Yes campaigners predicted that it would be years before another referendum.</p> <p>Denmark's big day followed a six-month campaign that saw little argument about the economic merits of joining the euro but much discussion of deep-seated anxieties about the erosion of national identity and independence.</p> <p>By lunchtime, crowds were streaming past Copenhagen's famous Tivoli gardens and into the capital's town hall to vote.</p> <p>Emerging from a polling booth, economist and Yes voter Soren Voetmann said: \"I have tried to use common sense and not my emotions. There has been too much emotion.\"</p> <p>But Christen Thrane, 23, a young mother, was against. \"It's too fast and I am not sure what we are getting into,\" she said. \"It's important that we keep our Danish money and I fear adopting the euro will damage our social welfare system.\"</p> <p>Danes were voting whether to keep their opt-out from the 1993 Maastricht treaty, negotiated after a referendum in 1992 rejected the entire single currency project.</p> <p>Yesterday's referendum was Denmark's sixth since deciding to join the EEC in 1972. But it was the first time any of the EU's 15 members had voted directly on whether to adopt the single currency.</p> <p>Last night's result will top the agenda when EU finance ministers meet in Brussels today.</p>",
  "With barely-concealed glee that the high price of oil has restored the power of the Opec cartel, Venezuela's charismatic president, Hugo Chavez, has used the group's first summit in 25 years to stake his claim as the self-appointed leader of the developing world. <p>\"He is definitely living his days of glory. He sees himself as a world leader and Opec has given him the springboard. I don't think he could be happier,\" said Roberto Bottome, president of the consultancy firm Veneconomy. </p> <p>In a key speech combining revolutionary rhetoric with folksy references to Gabriel Garcia Marquez and the Hindu philosopher Krishna Murta, Mr Chavez rallied leaders of the other 10 Opec countries - including the presidents of Nigeria, Indonesia, Algeria and Iran - to demand justice from industrialised countries. </p> <p>\"We cannot allow that once again we be indicted as guilty for the imbalance of the world,\" he said in defence of high oil prices. \"We are victims of the imbalances of the world economy. We are not at fault.\" </p> <p>Mr Chavez compared the price of oil to the price of barrels of Coca-Cola, ice cream, shampoo and Tabasco. \"A barrel of good wine is worth, you know how much? $1,370 - 450% [more than oil]. This is almost laughable, but let's tell the truth to the whole world.\" </p> <p>The Opec meeting, which ended in the Venezuelan capital Caracas last night, was Mr Chavez's party. He has been the cartel's loudest voice since he took office in February last year, when oil was $13 a barrel and Opec was mired in bickering over quotas. </p> <p>Mr Chavez received an unexpected cash windfall when the cost of a barrel more than tripled after reaching a low of $8. It has sparked a recovery in the Venezuelan economy and has enabled the former coup leader to project himself as a combative new voice on the international stage. </p> <p>Janet Kelly, professor of public policy at the Institute for Higher Administrative Studies in Caracas, said: \"[Chavez] came to office during the worst circumstances you could imagine. That the oil situation turned around last year has been manna from heaven. It has helped him in every way imaginable.\" </p> <p>In the same way as the forceful Mr Chavez has taken control of Venezuelan institutions, so industry analysts credit him with bringing discipline to the traditionally fractious cartel. </p> <p>This year he toured all Opec countries to invite them to the summit. He took delight in irritating the west by being the first head of state to visit Saddam Hussein in Baghdad since the Gulf war. </p> <p>The timing of the summit has coincided with protests in Europe about pump prices, adding to Opec's reinvigorated sense of importance. \"The eyes of the world are upon us,\" Mr Chavez said. \"Everyone is attentive to what we do, what we discuss, what we decide.\" </p> <p>He argues that high taxes and market speculation, not supply, are the reasons for prices rises. In his view, Opec should serve as a bulwark against the economic imperialism he sees as damaging to developing countries. He also wants Opec to tackle foreign debts, terms of trade and other issues for poor countries. </p> <p>The purpose of this week's summit was less about addressing the west's fears about high prices than strengthening ties within Opec. </p> <p>The summit is only the second in Opec's 40-year history because the organisation has been complicated by wars between members - Iran and Iraq in the 1980s and Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in 1990. </p> <p>The only visible crack in the united front in Caracas was when the seating plan was hastily changed to move Saudi Arabia's crown prince from next to Iraq's vice-president. </p> <p>According to oil experts, the Opec countries were revelling in their moment of importance because a future drop in the oil price was inevitable. \"Market reality will reassert itself,\" one said. \"Then I don't know what will happen but it will be pretty messy. Chavez will get egg on his face.\" </p> <p>Whereas Saudi Arabia, the most influential and least hawkish Opec country, was preaching moderation, other countries were rallying to Mr Chavez's anti-imperialist cry. </p> <p>\"In many countries the tax on oil has become an important means for financing their various projects instead of looking for other sources of income,\" said Qatar's foreign minister, Sheikh Hamad Bin Jassem Bin Jabor al-Thani. </p> <p>Iran's president, Mohammad Khatami, denounced what he called the new \"world attitude\", adding that Opec countries were \"waiting for international financial institutions to give all countries an equal opportunity\".</p>",
  "<p><strong>Big Brother special ingredients Part I</strong> <br> Monkey noted at Victoria Real's post-Big Brother party that when it comes to debauchery, digital types are outdoing their meeja counterparts. The dancefloor antics of Brighton's answer to Bez, Jason George, were exceeded only by the increasingly numerous and enthusiastic trips to the luxury mobile toilets by court jester in residence Paul Munford.   <strong>Big Brother special ingredients Part II</strong> <br> Now that everyone is attempting closure on Big Brother, it's time to set the record straight. One rumour that was confirmed by web stalwarts at the Big Brother house party on Thursday was the one doing the rounds at the start of the show's run about Randy Andy's secret rising ingredient for bread. Seems Andy's little trip to the lavvie during a bread kneading session resulted in more than just yeast been added to the dough. The impudent Jack the lad didn't even bother to wash his hands and innocently sat back, relishing in watching his housemates devour the fruits of his monkey spanking. This innocent Monkey is, quite rightly, speechless.  <strong>Not quite all over for Wembley commentator</strong> <br> The man who coined the immortal phrase \"They think it\u00b9s all over...\" really did think Wembley was going to be all over without him. Kenneth Wolstenholme, commentator at the historic 1966 England World Cup victory at Wembley over Germany, hadn't been invited to the England-Germany match next Saturday, the final game before the stadium is demolished. Now Sport First has hired the game's most memorable voice to write about the last match. What a joy, says Kenneth. Well, it is now!   <strong>What's in a suffix?</strong><br> Associated New Media finally came clean with its plans and new name for lead balloon CharlotteStreet.com this week, scotching rumours that it was going to launch you.co.uk. Instead we're to get femail.co.uk and rumour has it this new strategy of using the mail suffix will be applied to a number of Associated New Media websites. Staunch Royalist The Mail is said to be keen to develop a site devoted to that bastion of British culture, the Royal family (no, not the TV programme) but unfortunately for The Mail, a certain carrier of letters has already had the foresight to register royalmail.co.uk. Keen checkers of domain name registrations however, will be aware that Associated has already registered travelmail.co.uk, shopmail.co.uk, moneymail.co.uk and financialmail.co.uk. In fact the only one that is still available is showbizmail.co.uk - better snap it up quick. BR&gt;  <strong>Yawning risers</strong><br> As the battle of the breakfast bulletins shapes up, it's nice to know GMTV isn't straying too far from its roots. Monkey understands that a well-known ballerina, whose agents approached the network offering an exclusive interview, was turned down on the grounds that \"ballet dancers are too upmarket for us. They turn off our viewers\".  <strong>It came from the stalker</strong><br> Sophie Raworth, the pretty half of the BBC's new breakfast team, has caused quite a stir among blue-chip types. Eyebrows were raised at BBC news after she was found to have a website set up by a celebrity stalker. And it gets worse. Sophie's name mysteriously yields a link to a US adult site called Celeb Secrets: \"the web storehouse for nude celebrities\".   <strong>Hats off to Shatfield</strong><br> Anyone remember Stefano Hatfield, the former editor-in-chief of Campaign who defected to the monthly US trade mag Ad Age International? Tall bloke, lots of hair? Well he's been working his little Gucci socks off over in New York to relaunch and rebrand the title as Ad Age Global - and what an enormous difference it has made. Recent exclusives include \"Procter &amp; Gamble to launch electric mop across Europe.\" Several rivals are already rumoured to be giving up the ghost in the face of such stiff competition. Introducing the new-look magazine, Hatfield asks readers to \"let us know what you think\" about the revamp by e-mail. His e-mail address is rather less glamorous than his new title, or the magazine. Unfortunately it's shatfield@crain.com. Apparently the magisterial Shatfield has issued edicts to his minions that he \"doesn't want any jokes\". So no comments about the shat hitting the fan or no shatting on your own doorstep.</p> <p> <strong>Media medals</strong> <br> And they're off... Media Monkey has been inspired by plucky Team GB's growing Lottery money-fuelled medal haul Down Under to launch its own Olympic medal table, based on which UK media outfit has the most executives in Sydney on sports-related jollies. The inaugural table has United News &amp; Media placed third (Malcolm Wall - a marginal decision though, as by next week he'll be a Granada employee), with the BBC (Greg Dyke and Peter Salmon) and Channel 5 (Dawn Airey and David Elstein) level-pegging in second place, with two medals each. But storming ahead in first place is... Granada Media, with three medals (Charles Allen, Steve Morrison and Jules Burns). So Granada's purchase of that stake in Channel 7 (the Australian Olympic broadcaster) has paid off after all. If you know any more, let us know and we'll update the medal table accordingly.  <strong>If you're not on the list...</strong> <br> Mystery surrounds the pulling of BBC1's Nicholas Lyndhurst drama Thin Ice, which was plugged as one of the highlights of channel's autumn line-up and was due to go out next Saturday night, out of the schedule at short notice. Surely the Beeb's scheduling gurus could not have been quaking in their boots at the thought of the boy Lyndhurst going up against ropey old ITV blooper-fest It Shouldn't Happen to a Quiz Show Host, could it? Whatever the reason for the programming volte face, it is likely to provoke much gnashing of teeth in TV listings and weekend supplement offices across medialand that have lined up Lyndhurst features that are now too late to change.  <strong>Late show</strong> <br> Panorama gets the stories first, part 63. Mariella Frostrup's big investigation into Big Brother and reality TV shows is going out in November, six weeks after the Channel 4 series finished. Still, it'll be good for those who have spent the summer and autumn out of the country.   <strong>A new spin on the fuel crisis</strong> <br> Noel Edmonds's Video Meeting Company needs a trip to the classroom, if its latest press release is anything to go by. An announcement on the petrol crisis started with a sentence that was clearly written by a hyperactive three year-old with a bag of fridge magnets. \"As British business battles to devise ways and means of avoiding disaster next time there is a threat the petrol pumps will run dry, players in the video communications industry have never had it so good.\" Monkey is sure there's good news trapped in that sentence somewhere, but we work it out cannot.  <strong>The Sada truth</strong> <br> Sada, aka the hippy chick from Big Brother who now drives around in a spanking new ferrari, was spotted ducking into Freud Communications on Tuesday. It seems she's doing yet another promotion and hasn't even started the PR for her imminent book. Surely this is not the same tofu-loving, joga-obsessed trustafarian we met 12 weeks ago? The words \"sell\" and \"out\" keep springing to mind.   <strong>Shock as hairy man fronts BBC's Breakfast show</strong> <br> Observers of the BBC's growing obsession with image may remember there were fisticuffs when the last champion of the hirsute, Michael Burke, tried to grow a beard. With a hairy man at the corporation's helm, you would think the BBC's policy of banning facial hair for news presenters may have eased up. Not so. The stakes have been upped, however, by the arrival of Jeremy \"Rambo\" Bowen, fresh from the frontline with a moustache. Sources at BBC News confirm that Bowen, who has been brought in to apply the Johnny n'Denise factor to the BBC's new morning programme Breakfast, has been exempted from this policy. Burke is not amused.   <strong>Family means family</strong><br> The spin-savvy world we live in means corporate PRs have to go to extraordinary lengths to get past the ho-hum cynicism of journalists. When Dow Jones, publisher of the Wall Street Journal, last week announced that chief financial officer Jerry Bailey was stepping down to spend more time with his family, an internal memo e-mailed to staff from chairman and chief executive Peter Kann read: \"As most of you know, I started my career as a business reporter, and I reported my share of press releases that announce a resignation based on 'personal family reasons'. Some of them, I found, were a bit euphemistic. This one is not.\" You live by the sword...</p> <p> <strong>Sounds sick</strong><br> True story or sick, sick, sick urban myth? According to a top BBC source, Radio 2 has suffered a complaint after, incredibly, following a news item about the conjoined twins with a record... Stuck on You. Monkey is disgusted.</p> <p> <strong>Petrol story crisis</strong><br> Monkey prints verbatim, and without further comment, an email sent at 11am this morning from Tonight with Trevor McDonald editor Jeff Anderson to his production team: \"Did any of you watch Panorama last night? Apparently there was a fuel crisis a couple of weeks ago with garages running dry, food shortages in the shops and hospital operations being cancelled. It all started with a few farmers blocking the Stanlow refinery in Ellesmere Port because they were upset about high taxes on petrol and diesel. Why didn't any of you tell me about this at the time? Can none of you spot a story? Thank God there's at least one programme out there doing proper current affairs.

  "<p>Prague is over; the IMF/World Bank meeting has shut down early, thanks to pressure from activists who travelled from all over the world to protest against the bank's policies in developing countries. To most people it looked like yet another set-piece confrontation between a ragtag bunch of scruffy protesters and hard-headed cops in riot gear; after Seattle and Washington came S26, the Battle of Prague. </p> <p>Yes, there was violence. \"Black block\" anarchists threw rocks and Molotov cocktails at the police; police charged and beat protesters, fired teargas and water cannon. But even the wildest of commentators estimate the number of violent activists as 1-2% of the 15,000 protesters. Almost all of the many hundreds of NGOs, trade unions and affinity groups attending were peaceful. Yesterday reports were coming out of Prague about police brutality and human-rights abuses against arrested protesters. Members of Ya Basta, a popular group of Italian activists who were extraordinarily well-disciplined and restrained in their direct action, have been labelled \"terrorists\" by the Czech authorities. </p> <p>But much of the protest was a positive affair: there was a samba band, a pink cardboard tank, upbeat trade unionists from Mexico to Manchester; there were well-attended counter-summits, with intellectuals and philosophers theorising on the nuts and bolts of the movement. Many of the demonstrators could give, on demand, a sophisticated critique of the global economy. </p> <p>Focusing on the violence makes it easy to demonise the demonstrators as something dangerous and \"other\". They are dismissed in a variety of contradictory ways: they're rioters, they're rich middle-class kids with nothing better to do, they're crusty undesirables, they're disorganised, they lack vision, they're Luddites. But by condemning them in such crude terms, we condemn ourselves to misunderstand the most significant political movement to emerge in a generation. </p> <p> The Telegraph casts the activists as \"highly educated, bourgeois offspring rejecting the ways and wealth of their parents' generation\". Well, you do have to have the fare to get there. But when it comes to anti-globalisation, the developing world has led the way. The west is playing catch-up. Anti-IMF/World Bank protests have been held all over the global south for more than a decade, from Indonesia to Brazil, from the Philippines to Bolivia. </p> <p>Critics of the movement can't bear the anarchy of it; they see its disparateness as cluelessness rather than a deliberate attempt to overcome traditional hierarchies. But if a movement can force such powerful institutions as the IMF and World Bank to come to a halt early, and if protesters can get inside the conference centre in spite of 11,000 riot police, 5,000 army back-up and a few tanks, their organising skills might be considered rather impressive. </p> <p>In the run-up to Tuesday's demonstration I attended the convergence centre, where \"spokes council\" meetings took place, and found the sense of community and organisation there astonishing and moving. Every \"affinity group\" - NGO or group of friends - sent a spokesperson to meetings to make decisions and work out strategy. It sounds impossible to contain, and it was laborious, but it worked and consensus was found. It felt like proper democracy in a way that the ballot box does not. </p> <p>I was aware, too, of something different about the experience of S26, but it wasn't until the journey home that I realised what it was. No one had tried to sell me anything. The night-time parties weren't sponsored by a beer company. Nothing was branded. </p> <p>The movement's umbrella is a huge one, which can accommodate a vast array of opinions. Is that so terrible a thing? The Zapatistas - heroes to many protesters - say that anti-globalisation demonstrators are made up of \"one no, many yeses\". The no is to rampant capitalism, the yes is to different kinds of societies. It's web-like, it looks like the internet, and it couldn't exist without it. </p> <p>The movement needs to ask itself where it goes from here. It must find a role that is not only, as Naomi Klein, chronicler of anti-corporatism, puts it, turning up at international meetings like Deadheads following the Grateful Dead. But this is a new movement, and it's in no hurry. Whether it burns out or turns into the next big thing will take time to see. </p> <p>Clare Short says that the protesters are \"today's Luddites ... their call to halt historical change and tear down our international institutions offers no solution\" - as if neoliberal globalisation were an inevitability. It isn't. It's a particular form of economics, of human behaviour and development - as Nelson Mandela pointedly told Labour's conference in Brighton yesterday - and resisting it might just be more modern and radical than critics of the anti-globalisation movement dare to think. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:katharine.viner@theguardian.com\">katharine.viner@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "Oxford University Press has produced a dictionary of quotations which departs from traditional collation by author and era, instead grouping entries around subjects. <p>The Oxford Dictionary of Thematic Quotations offers more than 600 easy-to-browse contemporary themes, ranging from acting to weather. </p> <p>\"This is a book to which people will turn in order to listen to contemporary discussion on a wide range of topics,\" said Elizabeth Knowles, managing editor of OUP's quotations dictionaries. </p> <p>\"The thematic divisions focus on issues of today. We have still included remarks from some classic authors, but the topics chosen are those that reflect modern concerns.\" </p> <p>She said contrasting comments under each heading would provide readers with food for thought. </p> <p>The entry for politics, for example, gives Harold Wilson's words on the 1964 sterling crisis: \"A week is a long time in politics.\" But the then backbencher Ken Livingstone said in 1997: \"Politics is a marathon, not a sprint.\" Both observations, it seems, have weathered well. </p> <p>Under the heading quotations, a remark from Winston Churchill reads: \"It is a good thing for an uneducated man to read books of quotations.\" Yet on the same page the American essayist Ralph Emerson suggests that parroting other people's words limits true thought: \"I hate quotation. Tell me what you know.\" </p> <p>Ms Knowles said the dictionary incorporated comments from more than 1,000 wits, including contemporary figures such as Joan Collins, Jeremy Paxman and the rap artist Ice Cube. </p> <p>Noel Gallagher's profane boast as to the crowd pulling power of his band, Oasis - \"has God played Knebworth?\" - makes it into the dictionary, though it may not prove as resonant as Friedrich Nietzsche's 1882 assault on the almighty: \"God is dead: but ... there will perhaps be caves, for ages yet, in which his shadow will be shown.\" </p> <p>Ms Knowles identified a recent drift towards the shorter, sometimes more glib soundbite, but cautioned against accusing modern commentators of failing to match up. </p> <p>\"I don't believe the standard has fallen,\" she said. \"What gets overlooked is that the past is represented by the few quotations that have lasted and the many remarks we remember from the last couple of years will not all stand the test of time.\" </p> <p>The dictionary includes entries from the few politicians fighting the trend towards verbless soundbites. </p> <p>Modern topics under discussion include personal computers, which, according to Timothy Leary in 1996, were \"the LSD of the 90s\", heralding an era in which the US historian Francis Fukuyama last year claimed: \"Silicon Valley is the Florence of the late 20th century.\" </p> <p>Other contemporary commentators are recorded battling over the role of science in society. </p> <p>\"We ought not to permit a cottage industry in the God business,\" the US Republican John Marchi said three years ago on hearing that British scientists had cloned a sheep. </p> <p>But, argues Stephen Jay Gould, science is \"an integral part of culture. It's not this for eign thing, done by an arcane priesthood. It is one of the glories of human intellectual tradition.\" </p> <p>A number of injudicious remarks are also dredged up. The weather forecaster Michael Fish is quoted on the eve of the October 1987 hurricane as telling his viewers: \"A woman rang to say she heard there was a hurricane on the way. Well, don't worry, there isn't.\" </p> <p>Jonathan Aitken's comments on \"the cancer of bent and twisted journalism\" in 1995 are also uncharitably revisited. </p> <p> \u0095 The Oxford Dictionary of Thematic Quotations, edited by Susan Ratcliffe; \u00a314.99.</p>",
  "Dozens of people were injured in rioting on the West Bank and in Jerusalem yesterday as the hawkish Likud party leader, Ariel Sharon, staged a provocative visit to a Muslim shrine at the heart of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. <p>Surrounded by hundreds of Israeli riot police, Mr Sharon and a handful of Likud politicians marched up to the Haram al-Sharif, the site of the gold Dome of the Rock that is the third holiest shrine in Islam. </p> <p>He came down 45 minutes later, leaving a trail of fury. Young Palestinians heaved chairs, stones, rubbish bins, and whatever missiles came to hand at the Israeli forces. Riot police retaliated with tear gas and rubber bullets, shooting one protester in the face. </p> <p>The symbolism of the visit to the Haram by Mr Sharon - reviled for his role in the 1982 massacre of Palestinians in a refugee camp in Lebanon - and its timing was unmistakable. \"This is a dangerous process conducted by Sharon against Islamic sacred places,\" Yasser Arafat told Palestinian television. </p> <p>Mr Sharon's second motive was less obvious: to steal the limelight from the former prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, who returned from the US yesterday and could become a challenger for the Likud party leadership after Israel's attorney general decided not to prosecute him for corruption. </p> <p>But that ambition was overshadowed by the potential for serious violence at Haram al-Sharif, the point where history, religion and national aspiration converge. </p> <p>Palestinian protesters followed Mr Sharon down the mountain, chanting \"murderer\" and \"we will redeem the Haram with blood and fire\". They narrowly escaped clashing with Orthodox Jews who shouted \"go back to Mecca\". </p> <p>Although the Haram is part of Arab East Jerusalem, occupied illegally by Israel since 1967, Jews revere the esplanade, which they call the Temple Mount, as the site of a temple destroyed in AD70. </p> <p>The 35-acre site is the single biggest obstacle to peace and, as Mr Sharon asserted yesterday, an inalienable part of the Jewish state. </p> <p>\"The Temple Mount is in our hands and will remain in our hands. It is the holiest site in Judaism and it is the right of every Jew to visit the Temple Mount,\" he said after his descent. </p> <p>Palestinians and Israeli liberals denounced the visit as a dangerous provocation. \"The timing and the decision to visit the Haram was taken to flare up the area and to burn up the place,\" said a blood-splattered Ahmed Tibi, an Israeli Arabmember of the knesset, who suffered a broken wrist in the scuffles at the shrine. \"He wants to see more blood and more killing. He wants to kill the peace.\" </p> <p>The protests inside the Haram were extinguished, but not before two screaming riot policemen were rushed down the mountain on stretchers, and at least five Palestinians were injured. </p> <p>Later in the day, clashes broke out on the main commercial street in Arab East Jerusalem, and outside the West Bank town of Ramallah. </p> <p>Mr Sharon was unrepentant, claiming he had been on a mission of reconciliation. \"What provocation is there when Jews come to visit the place with a message of peace? I am sorry about the injured, but it is the right of Jews in Israel to visit the Temple Mount.\"</p>",
  "<p>This week's <strong> Taggart</strong> (ITV) was shot at Partick Thistle. Partick Thistle FC, as Billy Connolly used to say with some emphasis, the national consensus being that it was called Partick Thistle Nil. </p> <p>Strathclyde FC, the team in Football Crazy, is also incapable of putting a round ball in a square goal. Backstage, happily, there is more going on. A director is doing abortions for the players' girlfriends. The manager is sleeping with the players' wives. The goalkeeper is crooked. The groundsman is disgruntled and, as Wodehouse mentioned, it is never difficult to distinguish between a Scotsman with a grievance and a ray of sunshine. </p> <p>And you can't move for dead bodies. That's more like it. You cannot beat an abundance of bodies. For one thing, it certainly narrows down the suspects. By the end it was either the cleaner or the chairman. </p> <p>This was the 50th Taggart, its golden anniversary, and much wittier and more vividly directed than several I have seen recently. Glenn Chandler, who created Taggart, gave it a quite distinctive stamp, ghoulish humour. And a nation which invented haggis and bagpipes has no peer in this department. The forensic surgeon in Taggart is fond of a good chuckle. He reminds me of Conan Doyle's partner, who used to tell patients, \"Take your medicine and, if that does no good, swallow the cork. There's nothing better when you are sinking.\" The sort of doctor who is at his best with corpses. </p> <p>The first to go is the referee, apparently from a heart attack (\"No obvious sign of foul play.\") Then the abortionist is ground to powder under his own car (\"A pretty grim way to go. Tib and fib were uniformly crushed. Very nasty.\") But, as he was an orthopaedic surgeon, appropriate. The randy manager is poisoned with inferior champagne (\"What did it? The champagne I daresay.\") And the financial director has his head pushed so far through a plate glass window he seems to be sniffing the window box outside (\"The cause of death is quite simple. His carotid artery was severed. What's tricky is how his head came to be there in the first place. Still that's your job, isn't it? Ha! ha! ha!\") </p> <p>After Jardine has arrested the chairman, it comes to Jackie in a flash, entirely unsupported by evidence as far as I could see, that it was the cleaner. This energetic woman had also, in my view, bumped off the referee by feeding him a strawberry cream tart before the match. </p> <p>I was very taken with one episode in <strong> The Children Who Cheated The Nazis</strong> (Channel 4) and doubt if I can improve on the woman's own words. A trainload of Jewish refugee children, bound for Britain, were leaving Germany and parents they would never see again. Emmy's father kissed her, blessed her and told her to be a good girl. Slowly the train pulled out. \"Suddenly the door was pulled open and a wicker basket was pushed in. The door closed and the train began to gather speed. I realised that all the children were looking at me because I was the oldest one. They expected me to open the basket and see what was in it. And when I opened it, I found two sleeping infants.\" </p> <p>Does this remind you of anything? The daughter of the Pharaoh said, \"This must be one of the Hebrews' children.\" The traumatised children were galvanised into action. They fed the babies with the bottles they found in the basket and made nappies from their own handkerchiefs. </p> <p>You can only wonder wildly what it must have been like to find yourself, as some refugees did, the temporary sisters of Richard and David Attenborough or, more disconcertingly, of Warren Mitchell. </p> <p>Dominic Allen, a man who can look all at sea in the desert, is investigating Haitian voodoo in <strong> Last Of The Medicine Men</strong> (BBC2), somewhat hampered by the national tendency to go into a trance and attack the camera. As he said helplessly at one point, \"Rather a lot of people are being possessed at the moment.\" A possessed priestess entwined herself alluringly around the lanky Allen and swung her screaming child around by the leg. The spirit spoke: \"Here is money! Here is money!\" And it wasn't wrong. Allen wondered if she would help him to find a really evil witch doctor. Look, if this is anything to do with headless chickens, I'm off. </p> <p>The credits implausibly gave thanks to someone called Normal.</p>",
  "There is an ambiguity at the heart of the government's attitude towards the Human Rights Act that has undermined preparation for its coming into force on Monday. Is it legal tidying up guaranteeing rights with which the population of the UK already broadly enjoy? Or does it herald profound change for public authorities: change that could land them in court if they fail to adapt? <p>Initially the government was complacent, thinking that the act would require little practical change. This attitude was responsible for the government's decision not to establish an independent, statutory human rights commission along with the act. Unless that decision is reversed, the act's benefits may not be realised and the costs could be great. </p> <p>If all the act did was bring Strasbourg rights into domestic law, it hardly needs a separate body to ensure its success. The existing equalities commissions - listed in the chart - were deemed necessary to promote and enforce legislation on race, gender and disability; the government was not convinced that was needed for human rights. </p> <p>Instead a task force was set up to advise on implementation. There was also a promise, that has not been kept, of a parliamentary committee to monitor the act. In the absence of an independent commission to provide guidance to the thousands of public, private and voluntary bodies required to comply with the act, Whitehall departments were instructed to send out any explanatory material deemed necessary. </p> <p>Meanwhile, the full implications of the act were becoming clearer as lawyers identified possible breaches of the European Convention of Human Rights in every area of public service, from education and health to planning and residential care. The Scottish executive found itself repeatedly challenged under Scotland's comparable, if more limited, human rights legislation, enacted as part of the devolution settlement. </p> <p>The Human Rights Act began to look less like a tidying up exercise than a revolution. The fact that only 3% of Scottish challenges succeeded was overlooked. Speculation in the press that the act would overturn life as we knew it drowned out the positive message that the home secretary was trying to get across. </p> <p>The rights protected by the act, Jack Straw points out, are rarely absolute; they can be limited to protect the rights of others. The central idea in the act is balance, not assertion. Moreover, the courts are there only as a backstop. Public bodies should prevent infringements by reviewing legislation, policy and practice to ensure they comply. </p> <p>But that means decisionmakers and those dealing with the public on a daily basis need to understand what the act requires: what infringement of privacy will be considered \"necessary and proportional\", how \"degrading\" treatment has to be before it is unlawful and what counts as a fair hearing. They need to know the implications of their responsibility to respect the rights to family life, freedom of religion and education. When exercising their discretion, everyone from the prime minister to care assistants will have to ask whether their own actions might infringe a basic right. </p> <p>That change, Mr Straw rightly says, will create a cultural shift in the delivery of public services, a new ethic and a \"fairness guarantee\". If it happens, the impact, particularly on vulnerable people, could be profound. Yet most ministers seem scarcely aware of the potential benefits to the public service for which they are responsible, nor of the potential costs of litigation if the service fails to adapt. </p> <p>As a result, the priority given to preparing for the act has been patchy and inadequate. The Department of Health's circular on it was not issued until July 20, leaving organisations only 10 weeks to prepare. In August, the immigration service was still trying to find an external agency to provide training for its 800 staff. Small voluntary organisations, such as Justice, which have stepped into the breach to provide training for public bodies on a daily basis, report having to turn down as many requests as they accept. The excellent, but small human rights unit in the Home Office could not hope to provide guidance on the scale that is needed. </p> <p>As the cases begin to roll, the need for a statutory body to bridge the gap will become pressing. This is already so in Scotland. With all-party support, the Edinburgh executive is now consulting on setting up a Scottish human rights commission. It could be like the existing Northern Ireland human rights commission established last year. Only in England and Wales, it seems, are there no plans to provide a similar service. The government task force said a commission would be needed if the act is to be implemented effectively. The commission for racial equality and the equal opportunities commission have given their \"wholehearted support\". </p> <p>A commission is needed, first and foremost, to advise, guide and cajole public bodies to adapt and comply. As a central and pro-active source of advice on cases and good practice it would drive the cultural change the Home Office wants to see. It could cut the number of complaints and, by encouraging mediation, the number of cases that reach court. It would monitor the impact of the act, advise the public and conduct inquiries where there is evidence of systemic abuse. A human rights commission would, in the words of the Lord Chief Justice, Lord Woolf, \"assist in creating a culture in which human rights are routinely observed without the need for continuous intervention by the courts\". </p> <p>The real challenge of the act is to bring human rights into the everyday language of public service, to foster a culture in which the public - pensioners and children, parents and offenders, patients and asylum seekers - are treated with fairness, dignity and respect. In the absence of a statutory body acting as an engine for change, it is unlikely to happen. </p> <p><b> Commissions of rights</b> </p> <p><b> Equal opportunities</b><br> Created 1976 to promote equal opportunites for men and women, end sex discrimination </p> <p><b> Racial equality</b><br> Created 1976 to tackle racial discrimination, promote racial equality </p> <p><b> Northern Ireland human rights </b><br> Created 1999 to ensure the human rights of everyone in Northern Ireland are \"fully and firmly protected in law, policy and practice\" </p> <p><b> Disability rights</b><br> Created 2000 to secure civil rights for all disabled people </p> <p> \u0095 Sarah Spencer is at the Institute for Public Policy Research </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:Sasippr@aol.com\">Sasippr@aol.com</a></p>",
  "<p>A distressing picture of human activities pushing an ever increasing number of mammals, birds, trees and plants to the brink of extinction is published today in the internationally recognised \"red list\" of endangered species. </p> <p>Gorillas, the Iberian lynx, some species of dolphins, eagles, eight types of freshwater turtles and 16 types of albatross are all disappearing. </p> <p>The 2000 list, the most comprehensive look at the chances of survival of everything from the great whales to humble mosses, concludes that mankind is causing extinctions at 50 times the natural rate. </p> <p>The four-yearly report shows that 11 mammals have slipped into the critically endangered category since 1996, and one monkey, Miss Waldron's red colobus, has not been seen despite extensive searches in the Ivory Coast and Ghana. </p> <p>The report says: \"The global extinction crisis is as bad as or worse than believed, with dramatic declines of many species, including reptiles and primates.\" </p> <p>Around a quarter of all reptiles, one in five amphibians and one in three freshwater fish are described as threatened. But the report says that many plants and animals are probably becoming extinct before they have time to be discovered and properly described. </p> <p>Species in danger are placed in categories. Most enter the red list by being classed as threatened, which means they face a high risk of extinction in the near future. There are 11,046 plants and animals in this category. One in four mam mal species and one in eight of all birds is now red listed. </p> <p>Critically endangered means extinction is close. Falling into this category is the Cross River gorilla. There are only 150 to 200 left in dense forest on the Nigerian/Cameroon border. </p> <p>Another is the Philippine eagle, down from an original population of 6,000 to between 350 and 600. The old growth forest on which it depends for survival is being cut down. The World Conservation Union, which compiles the list, believes that if the eagle can be saved so too can 27 other species of bird in the same forest also heading for extinction. </p> <p>Indonesia, India, Brazil and China are among the countries with the most threatened mammals and birds, while plant species are declining fastest in central and west Africa and south-east Asia. </p> <p>But Europe is not immune. The Iberian lynx is down to 600 survivors, mainly in Spain, because of loss of habitat. </p> <p>In the UK, the red squirrel has suffered a crash in population, and the small eyed ray has been killed in large numbers by trawl nets. The common sturgeon, which if caught round British coasts is supposed to be delivered to the Queen, is so critically endangered from overfishing for its caviar in the Baltic that she will be lucky to see one again. </p> <p>Also threatened in the UK are 11 varieties of Sorbus, a small tree with red berries, because their habitat has been destroyed by limestone quarrying. One, Sorbus bristoliensis, lives only in the Avon Gorge in Somerset and there are only about 100 plants in all. </p> <p>Craig Hilton-Taylor, the Cambridge based scientist who compiled the list, described his job as the most depressing in the world. </p> <p> He said: \"It is depressing at times. Sometimes there does seem to be no hope, but unless we find out what is happening it is difficult to know what to do about it and what our priorities should be.\" </p> <p>But there are glimmers of hope. The otter, threatened worldwide, is recovering in Britain. The white rhino, down to 200 animals and confined to South Africa in the late 1970s, is up to 11,000 and its range has increased to several countries. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.iucn.org\">IUCN, the World Conservation Union</a> </p> <p> <a href=\"http://www.redlist.org\">The IUCN red list of endangered species 2000</a></p>",
  "I am sure Faisal Bodi enjoyed the flourish of his comments on me and others (Don't label me, please, September 28) when he wrote that we claimed, without justification, to represent \"black\" people and that we wanted to melt society down in cooking pots. But let me just remind him of a few basic and very easily checked facts. <p>First, I do not represent anyone. I am a journalist and writer. I talk to people and have ideas of my own. Second, in all my writing, including in my columns this month, I have consistently argued against simplistic assumptions about politics and \"black\" representation, although I feel strongly that all our institutions remain too white. Finally, the only thing that unites Darcus Howe, Lee Jasper and myself is that we refuse to be confined to pre-destined identities (unlike Bodi who sees himself entirely in terms of an idealised Muslim identity), and that we have taken our ideas out of the ghetto and into the wider arena of national life. Perhaps this is why we are taken seriously by so many Britons.<br> <b>Yasmin Alibhai-Brown</b><br> London </p> <p>\u0095 About once a year we are forced to deal with the lame duck argument that the UK's African, Asian and Caribbean communities have politically nothing in common. And every year we give the same answer. We recognise our immense differences, in fact for the most part we celebrate them. </p> <p>However, we come together politically on a number of key issues: a fair and just immigration and asylum policy; a democracy that reflects the nation's diversity; a society that offers our communities equality of opportunity; and an environment that ensures our loved ones such as Stephen Lawrence, Ali Ibrahim, Shiji Lapite, Quddas Ali and Muktar Ahmed are not stabbed, shot or beaten senseless not because they were Caribbean, African or Asian but because they were black. </p> <p>As for Operation Black Vote's success, one need look no further than the mayoral elections. Every candidate courted the black vote as never before. Why? Because victory depended on it.<br> <b>Lee Jasper <br>Simon Woolley</b><br> Operation Black Vote</p>"
