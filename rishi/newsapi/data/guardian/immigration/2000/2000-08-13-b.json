  "<p>Radio 5 Live's phone-in was humming with dudgeon on Friday morning. 'What the hell's wrong with the English? Why are the Celts so bloody touchy?' said Kim in Devon, sounding a little, shall we say, touchy. </p> <p>What was wrong - generally, as opposed to 'with the English' - was the notion that the bloody touchy Celts wanted to be alone, especially in sport. They no longer wanted to compete as Great Britain at the Olympics, for a start. They wanted to express themselves. What a nerve. What a fuss. </p> <p>Peter in Norwich, who considered himself British more than English, chipped in with: 'I've got a Scots mother, English father and I get terribly depressed when these arguments start. Alan Wells was cheered as British winning at the Olympics. I bet the Scots, though, cheered Coe and Ovett at the same Olympics as British.' </p> <p>Probably not Pete. </p> <p>This seems to be a fundamental misunderstanding in England. When the English, who have had centuries of practice in patronising lesser nations, tell you they cheer for Scotland, say, against other foreigners, they imagine the gesture is reciprocated north of the border. But Scots, generally, do not feel minded to return the favour, if that is what it is. </p> <p>Maybe it's part of the English character: misunderstanding the rest of the world. It's like those surveys they regularly do about England's historical relationship with France. The French invariably say they like the English, but the English overwhelmingly think that the French don't like them. Scotland, on the other hand, has long felt a bond with France, as has Ireland. Both turned to the French in conflicts with the English at various stages. </p> <p>Another caller made a good point. 'I was born here 37 years ago and I consider myself a Black Briton but not English. It seems you have to be white to be English. But you hear Asians in Scotland, for instance, proud to be both Asian and Scottish, rather than Asian and British.' </p> <p>Larry In Ilford, offered this: 'It's nonsense. There is no Great Britain anymore. The reason Neil Kinnock lost the General Election was because he is Welsh. We're all different.' </p> <p>Fine, Larry. Except Neil's dad was born in Scotland. It's a minefield. But enough history. </p> <p>The issue exercising the nation's housebound on Friday morning was one that has been bubbling under for a long time. The anomaly of Britain competing as an entity in some competitions, such as the Olympics, but not in others, such as the football World Cup and the Commonwealth Games - and don't even start with the British Lions, who include players from the Irish Republic - would seem to be unique. </p> <p>Even as parts of the world devolve, especially in Europe, no national entity springs to mind that can so readily split itself like a living cell then come back together again. The only situation that might be comparable exists in Spain, where there have been calls by the Catalans to compete as a separate nation, withdrawing their footballers from the Spanish national team. But would the Basques follow suit? And, anyway, that is more an issue of secession. </p> <p>So, who's right? </p> <p>One easy and obvious answer is that we should leave things as they are. It would seem to provide the best of both worlds, after all. If we were to unite the football teams for the World Cup, for instance, who among the Home Nations would want to cut their chances of qualifying by four? </p> <p>Also, there is such a history between England and Scotland on the football field it is inconceivable to have such a mixture competing as one homogeneous unit. </p> <p>Just as the puzzle was starting to build up to migraine proportions, a phone call from an old associate called Al Hamilton put an entirely different complexion on things. </p> <p>Al, who was born in Jamaica, hosts a unique gathering of sports people every year that reaches out rather than looking inwards, and those concerned about their national identity on Radio 5 Live last Friday might learn something from it, 'it' being the Commonwealth Sports Awards. </p> <p>They started in humble surroundings, Islington Town Hall 20 years ago, and have since been moved to grand hotels in London, to Jamaica and Africa. On 24 October, they're coming home, to Charlton Football Club, where John Barnes will be the special guest. </p> <p>'The aim is to honour sporting achievements and to encourage youth,' Hamilton says. Award winners have included Heather Hunt, Maurice Hope, Roland Butcher, Viv Anderson, Richard Hadlee, Viv Richards, Jahangir Khan, Sally Gunnell, Pat Cash, Lennox Lewis and the South African rugby team. </p> <p>South Africa was a touchy one and Hamilton recalls a curious meeting he and Garth Crooks had several years ago, when apartheid was still in place, with Steve Tshwete, who would go on to become sports minister. </p> <p>Tshwete, who shared imprisonment on Robben Island with Nelson Mandela, put to Crooks and Hamilton a proposal to take black footballers in England to the town ships. 'We looked at each other,' Hamilton recalls, 'not quite believing what we were hearing. He wanted to take Brian Stein, who was from South Africa, Ricky Hill, Cyrille Regis and Luther Blissett to South Africa to give black footballers some hope for the future. But it wasn't that simple. Garth and I told him such a move would have contravened the Gleneagles Agreement as it stood then and if we were to co-operate it could only be if we got the word from the Big Man himself.' </p> <p>Mandela was still in prison, so the plan, which would have created a major ruckus, was shelved. No such problems now however, and a significant awards ceremony continues to forge links across the world through sport. By looking out, not in.</p>",
  "Not before time, the Government tackles the prime destroyer of peace in the community. The chainsaws are out for leylandii hedging. No issue more preoccupies his correspondents, says Michael Meacher, whose Ministerial postbag is fat with letters recording 'thousands of ruined lives, legal battles and violence'. One presumes that few of these are post-marked Portsmouth, where the bricks, petrol bombs and screams of loathing unleashed by neighbours take precedence over horticultural hell. <p>And what is the Government going to do about that as the Paulsgrove estate subsides into uneasy truce? Mums set aside the disco Lycra essential for telegenic promotion of hanging and castration. Children abandon the 'Kill The Paedophile' placards adorned with smiley faces. So far, the countrywide scoreline in the game of hunt the pervert is two suicides, one injured policeman, various burned and smashed homes and an own goal by the judge who gave a suspended sentence to a sex offender on the grounds that he had suffered enough after being named by the News of the World . Then there is the collateral damage - the innocents hounded from their homes, the paedophiles driven underground, the children initiated into a creed of hatred. </p> <p>As marches were suspended, the move began, in bien pensant circles, to explain away the Paulsgrove mob as a shell-suited, tattooed, hamburger-munching sorority whose neighbour-bashing is rooted in a low-life culture barely explicable to genteel folk who restrict their raw emotions to squeaks of leylandii rage. That comfortingly snobbish explanation will not quite do. Nor is there much use in trawling the history of lynch mobs from the Kishinev pogrom to the Ku Klux Klan for further guidance. While Portsmouth 2000 eerily evokes Salem, Massachusetts, in 1692, recent precedents are more relevant. </p> <p>The dress rehearsal for last week's events was staged in April 1998, when the child killer, Sydney Cooke, was released from prison. Petrol bombs were hurled at the police station where he was believed to be sheltering. Dozens of officers were injured and probation officers warned that paedophiles would be driven underground as vigilantes clamoured for the sex offenders register, then newly introduced, to be made public. </p> <p>If the Home Office heeded this preview, they gave little indication. On the day that the News of the World launched its perilous 'name and shame' campaign, Paul Boateng expressed the sort of mild thumbs-down more appropriate to a member of a sampling panel assessing rival brands of teabag. His belated announcement, after the newspaper backed off , that there would be no open register only inflamed the hysteria that child-abuse scares inevitably foster. </p> <p>Track back to the late Eighties and early Nineties. In Middlesbrough, social services seized 121 children after Dr Marietta Higgs and her colleague, Dr Geoffrey Wyatt, mistakenly claimed to have uncovered an epidemic of sexual abuse. In Rochdale and Orkney, families were broken up by social workers gripped by the voguish (and wholly misplaced) terror of satanic abuse. The upshot, beyond the millions expended on public inquiries, was unquantifiable damage to children and all-round vilification of the vigilantes - interfering and authoritarian zealots in white coats and cable-knit cardigans. So much for the current theory that child-abuse cultism is the sole province of the oikish lower classes. </p> <p>But why the new witchhunt? The direct catalysts, of course, were the murder of Sarah Payne, whose parents plead now for an end to violence, and the News of the World . Behind that lies a political climate overtly or subvertly conducive to DIY justice. William Hague is explicit in his desire to lock up all asylum-seekers and to champion those who shoot fleeing teenage burglars. The Jack Straw mood music has naturally been more mellifluous. He wishes, as he repeated last week, for 'victims to feel that they are at the heart of the criminal justice system'. In recent months, Straw's initiatives have been sugared to appeal to those on the receiving end of crime. Curbing trial by jury will, to take one example, offer quicker justice and thus be a boon to victims. But skewing an impartial system away from defendants' rights is perilous. However subtle Straw's signals, they risk playing to a public appetite for victim-driven law, dictated by the grief of the bereaved. Any foot-dragging, and the clamour kicks in. </p> <p>If Home Office Ministers had been wiser, they would have pre-empted the incorrect notion that Britain is a perverts' playground. There may be an argument for tougher sentencing. There is certainly a need for more information on how paedophiles are treated and supervised. There is a case for splitting the sex offenders register so that child rapists are not listed alongside teenage boys who have had consensual sex with 15-year-old girlfriends. Even so, the register works better than in many countries. Most child abuse takes place at home, even, possibly, in the moral temples of the Paulsgrove estate. Risk, though it may be better managed, cannot be abolished. But that is not what the Home Office dares say, nor what the public wants to hear. </p> <p>The mood is for justice or for vengeance. We shall see shortly how the two conflate. Today, in some unnamed secure unit, Jon Venables, the older of the two Bulger killers, reaches his eighteenth birthday. Lord Woolf, the Lord Chief Justice, had hoped by now to have set a final tariff for Venables and Robert Thompson, who will be 18 in ten days' time. Woolf, who also favours victims' involvement - not, he says, as auxiliary prosecutors but in order to build public confidence in the criminal justice system - has now been held up twice because James Bulger's parents have not yet filed their submissions. It was reported last week that he would reach his decision by the end of August. In fact, it is unlikely to be delivered before Octo ber. The rival positions, however, seem clear. Denise Fergus, James's mother, believes, understandably, that 'the boys are evil and deserve to spend time in a proper jail'. Woolf, conversely, is thought to favour a 10-year term, expiring in 2003 and no move to an adult prison. The public verdict is not yet readable, but the history of the Bulger killers has no track record of inspiring clemency. </p> <p>Last October, Sir David Ramsbotham, the chief inspector of prisons, told me that he believed Thompson and Venables should be freed as soon as possible after their eighteenth birthdays 'in order to give them some chance of making a life'. In so exceeding his remit on a matter he deemed a 'question for society', Ramsbotham no doubt expected a rap over the knuckles and perhaps even the public apology he was required to make. Instead, he faced not only removal but the abolition of his job. Last week, official plans were published to merge the probation and the prisons watchdogs, thus absolving Jack Straw of further embarrassment from any stroppy chief inspector complaining of vile and inhumane conditions in British prisons. </p> <p>Ramsbotham's point, on the Bulger killers, was that it would be folly to place two boys - apparently rehabilitated and well-educated - back into such a system. 'I would not wish them to go to some of the places I have seen,' he said. We shall find out shortly whether the public is so merciful. We shall see also whether the spectre of Paulsgrove - the bloodlust, the hatred, the horrible scenes of toddlers with coffin-shaped posters inscribed 'Get In or Get Out' - has changed anything in the national psyche. </p> <p>If there is widespread acceptance of Lord Woolf's expected verdict, then perhaps some corner has been turned. The revulsion at the spectacle of rioters baying for punishment and revenge offers hope that may be so. Still, it would be over-optimistic to assume that the 'deep and darkling forces' that brought Salem to Portsmouth were merely a rogue expression of social discontent. </p> <p>Behind the leylandii hedges of Middle England, many deplore the Paulsgrove padeophile-bashers while tapping into their professed anxieties. If the Government cannot now calm reasonable fears, then it will face the upsurge of the brutish and the irrational.</p>",
  "They make good pictures. Flames, smoke and drama raging uncontrolled across the western states of America; women and children, the helpless victims of torrential floods, made homeless in India; Masai warriors taking their cattle across Kenya's Uhuru highway to find water in Nairobi. <p>It is not just that our lust for dramatic pictures (and their availability) has made us more aware of natural disasters - their incidence is genuinely increasing. Five of the hottest years of the last millennium took place in the 1990s. The twentieth-century's 10 warmest years all occurred in its last 15 years. Snow cover in the Northern Hemisphere and ice floes in the Arctic Ocean have decreased. Globally, the sea level rose between four and 10 inches over the past century. Worldwide, precipitation over land has increased by about 1 per cent. </p> <p>Certainly, humans have devised many more ways of destroying nature's delicate checks and balances, for example by ill-considered economic development along river banks which causes deforestation, soil erosion and, ultimately, uncontrollable flooding. None the less, no one, not even the United States government, any longer doubts that carbon emissions in industrialised countries have led to the much-predicted greenhouse effect and consequent global warming. In January, the United States National Academy of Sciences panel found that surface air temperatures had increased by 0.7 to 1.4 degrees Fahrenheit over the past 100 years. </p> <p>The case for lowering carbon-dioxide emissions is now overwhelming. Since the adoption of the Kyoto protocol in 1997, when major countries agreed to work toward reducing CO &lt;-&gt;2 <!----> emissions, US policy has been held hostage by special interests, particularly those in the oil industry. Now, all major presidential runners have made the giant step of accepting the truth of global warming. This provides an opportunity. </p> <p>The next global-warming conference will be held in the Hague in November. The US is set to propose that the Kyoto targets should be amended to include the notion of 'carbon sinks'. Countries which demonstrate improved crop land and forest management (which can absorb carbon dioxide) would be given carbon credits to trade against their emissions. In other words, the pressure would be off industry to reduce CO &lt;-&gt;2 <!----> emissions. </p> <p>It is an ingenious idea but deeply flawed, self-evidently so now that so much of US forest land is burning. The weather events in this infant millennium alone are sufficient to declare a global emergency. The US should treat it as such and take unequivocal action in the Hague to adopt the Kyoto targets.</p>",
  "The dirt road that runs along the top of Rabbit Creek in the Payette National Forest, Idaho, is mired in smoke and licked by flames when Michael Dier steps out from the trees. <p>An imposing 6ft 4in, Dier is breathless, his overgrown beard singed and mottled with soot, the tattoo on his forearm almost hidden by grime. 'This stuff moves fast, man,' he gasps, exasperated at how quickly the flames can consume the forest. 'It gets spooky down there. Some of the flames are 30ft taller than the trees. In this kind of forest, you just can't see them coming.' </p> <p>Dier, 41, is a strike team leader - a scout for the teams of firefighters who launch the first attacks against fires at their point of origin. He is one of 20,000 civilians fighting what experts agree are the worst forest fires in the US for the past 10 years, if not since 1949. Nearly a million acres are ablaze in Arizona, California, Colorado, Idaho, Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon, Utah, Texas, Washington and Wyoming. So far more than 63,000 fires have burnt 4.3 million acres. </p> <p>The US Forest Service has exhausted its resources and called in more than 1,500 military personnel to supplement their efforts. </p> <p>Dier is a hotshot - one of many daredevil firefighters who tackle blazes from the ground, often only as a part-time job. Below him, in Rabbit Creek, the two teams of Alaskan hotshots he works with have just pulled out of a fire that the winds had whipped down the valley. Dier is roaming the area, looking for information about the fire that might help his crews. Hotshots try to contain fires by chainsawing down unburnt trees and digging ditches across their path. Their shifts can last up to 30 hours. The work is perilous: a change in the wind direction can leave a team stranded, with only the thin, flame- retardant canopies they carry with them for protection. </p> <p>But these are ordinary men, many with ordinary jobs to go back to. Fourteen years ago, Dier spent his days fixing Harley-Davidsons. Then he became a hotshot and found full-time work in the US Forestry Service in San Bernardino, California. </p> <p>'I've been on my toes here' he says. 'It's slow going. In the desert terrain of San Bernardino you can see above the brush, but not here. With the cloud cover and smoke, our satellite positioning equipment is no use, as we can't get a signal. Also, the smoke is sinking, so it's unhealthy to stay around there. We may never get a handle on this one. For now we have to keep it away from people's homes'. </p> <p>Rabbit Creek is one of a host of problematic areas around Burgdorf Junction, north of the small lake town of McCall. On 14 July lightning struck and so far, across Idaho, 15 fires have set 408,000 acres ablaze. Burgdorf's 25,000-acre fire is small compared with the nation's largest blaze of 192,450 acres in nearby Clear Creek, or the Sula and Valley Complex fires in neighbouring Montana. But it has required the largest number of personnel to tackle it, even attracting the attention of President Clinton who diverted his helicopter last week to visit the teams and pledge an extra $150 million of federal money to aid the fight. </p> <p>Burgdorf's fires refuse to stay extinguished: the heat the conifers generate as they burn remains in the ground and ashes for days and can easily reignite. At present, the ignition rate is 90 per cent - for every hundred sparks that fly, 90 will start another fire. </p> <p>The counter-measures are slow. Blackhawk helicopters drop 3,000-gallon water bombs on the blaze, which erupt in angry clouds of steam. A few miles west, in Schissler Creek, a team from C Company, from the US Army's 3rd Battalion, are 'mopping up'. Following a dangerous 1,300ft steep descent from the road to the ravine below, the infantry slowly move across the valley, dousing embers with water piped from the rivers, felling hazardous trees and extinguishing ashes. While the hotshots meet the blaze head on, the military tidy up the remains to stop them reigniting. </p> <p>There are, however, less mundane ways of tackling the fires. Mike Tupper is a smoke jumper. Based 150 miles away in Bosie, his team have been tackling blazes all over the country but cannot find the resources to help in Idaho. Jumpers parachute into the source of a blaze and then do the job of hotshots. </p> <p>Tupper spent a year as a real estate agent, before enlisting. 'Ninety-eight per cent of fires we jump, we catch within 24 hours,' he declares. 'We're valued for the speed and range of the aircraft that take us to a fire, and the payload we can deliver of eight jumpers per plane.' </p> <p>Tupper says he has never felt in danger. 'What I fear most is driving to work on my bike,' he grins, before enthusing about a jump he did in Alaska. His team were cut off in a valley by a wall of flame and had to beat a hole through it to escape. </p> <p>The Idaho fires are already too well established for the preventative measures of jumpers. Rex Crabtree, a US Forestry official from California with 26 years' experience, commands a team of firefighters in one valley here and refers to these burnt areas as having been 'nuked'. </p> <p>But he says that fire is a natural part of the forest eco-system. 'Hundreds of years ago, the Pioneers used to talk about the air here being foggy,' he says, referring to when fires were not contained by controlled burns, but allowed to follow their natural course and smoulder at a low intensity for much of the year. 'But today some areas have not seen fire for years, so dead and alive foliage builds up'. When the flames hit these areas, they burn intensely, causing the huge fires that blight the area today. </p> <p>Across the nation, the problem grows. Fourteen hundred people have been asked to leave their homes. Highways across the country have been shut and six million acres of Montana woodland have been closed to the public. Power lines running from Montana to the Pacific West have been cut. </p> <p>In previous years, the fires have died down in some areas before they ignited in others, easing the strain on man power. This year, the National Interagency Fire Centre says, the fires are happening everywhere simultaneously. </p> <p>At the end of a fierce day, Crabtree stands above Schissler Creek and surveys the endless plumes of smoke below. Over the rise, an area of flames is expanding quickly. Behind him on an adjacent hill, a fire has broken out in an area of wild forest. Within 15 minutes a vast cloud of smoke has filled the sky over the hill. As Crabtree turns around and heads back to the trucks, the grey lining on the horizon makes it clear why many experts think the fires will only stop with the arrival of the winter snow. </p>",
  "Next weekend one thousand refugees, asylum-seekers, members of ethnic minority groups and the traveller community will converge at the Point Depot in Dublin to share in a celebration of one of Ireland's most successful exports - Riverdance. <p>The spectacular tapping, stamping, swirling show is at the end of a highly successful 'Homecoming' run. The company's grand finale, before it sets off on another international tour of Europe and the Far East, is to contribute its collective talents to the launch of a campaign against racism and prejudice in Ireland. </p> <p>There will be two performances next weekend. At the first, on Saturday, half the audience will be made up of members of minority groups. The second, on Sunday evening, will be a charity performance with the title Riverdance - Le Cheile (Together). It will launch Artists against Racism in Ireland, and all proceeds will go to a year-long education programme in community groups and schools across the country. </p> <p>The idea came from artist Robert Ballagh, who has designed all the productions of Riverdance, and Moya Doherty, the show's producer. Like many others, they have been shocked by increasing racist attacks and hostility to refugees and asylum-seekers. </p> <p>The production of Riverdance , now playing to packed houses at The Point, emphasises the experience of Irish emigrants seeking a better life, and the intermingling of cultures in the New World. There are Afro-American, Russian and Spanish dancers adding an international flavour to the fast, frenetic pace of the Irish performers. </p> <p>Ballagh and Doherty approached Comhlamh, an organisation of returned aid workers from developing countries. They hope to set up a campaign harnessing the talents of Irish artists to combat racism. On Sunday night there will be messages of support from Kofi Annan, the UN Secretary-General, and Mary Robinson, the former President of Ireland, who is now UN Commissioner of Human Rights. </p> <p>There are three different productions of Riverdance across the world. The show, which started as a filler between votes at the Eurovision Song Contest, has brought audiences in Japan, Australia and North America to their feet. </p> <p>Last month Niall Andrews, a Fianna Fail member of the European Parliament, asked Bertie Ahern to introduce an anti-racism pledge for all the party's candidates in the next general election. </p> <p>Amnesty International has noted with concern the growing number of racially motivated attacks. The African Refugee Council claimed more than a third of the people it questioned for a survey reported experiences of racial abuse and harassment. </p> <p>The problem is not confined to asylum-seekers. There is a growing number of foreigners, black and white, who have come to work in Ireland as a result of the country's economic success. One of the cases highlighted in the advertisements for next Sunday's Riverdance benefit concerns a 29-year-old man who is working in Ireland and who was attacked by youths at a Dublin bus stop after he told them he was German. </p> <p>Ireland is becoming an increasingly multiracial, multicultural society. The growth of the Celtic tiger economy will need more foreign workers to sustain it. </p> <p>To paraphrase Gerry Adams in another context, they are not going to go away, you know. The challenge to the Irish, particularily relevant because of our own historical experience as emigrants, is whether we see this diversity as an opportunity to enrich our society or a threat to traditional values. </p> <p>While many reports have focused on hostile protests against refugees, there have also been efforts by local community groups to make newcomers feel welcome. </p> <p>But there has been a lack of political leadership to campaign against racism. Perhaps the first fast and perfectly syncopated steps towards that goal will be taken next weekend as Riverdance taps out its multicultural message of inclusion. </p> <p>\u0095 Tickets for Sunday's performance, price \u00a330, are available from the Point Depot Box Office: 01-8363633.</p>",
  "The murder of the British backpacker Kirsty Jones took a sinister new twist last night when it emerged that her killer cowered silently in her room for several minutes after he had raped and strangled her. Only then did he slip away unnoticed. <p>Surin Channet, owner of the Aree guesthouse in Chiang Mai, northern Thailand, where Kirsty was staying, yesterday said he was alerted to her cries by other residents. He found Jones's two neighbours in the corridor. 'They said: \"We heard somebody shouting\",' he told The Observer . </p> <p>'There was no padlock on her room. Her killer must have still been inside. It was totally silent. I asked everyone to go back to sleep. I got ready to go out. When I passed the room 10 minutes later it had been padlocked on the outside.' </p> <p>Kirsty, 23, who had been travelling in Thailand for three months, spent the hour before her murder early last Thursday looking for Christmas presents for her mother, it emerged yesterday. She and another British backpacker, Sarah Wiggett, bought two tops for her parents in Chiang Mai's night bazaar, which sells ethnic clothes. </p> <p>Detectives taking part in the shambolic investigation - described as 'very casual' by one foreigner yesterday - hope DNA tests taken from 'three or four foreign' backpackers staying at the guest house will lead them to the killer. The results are not expected until Wednesday. </p> <p>One officer said: 'We think Kirsty must have known her killer.' </p> <p>But if none of the DNA tests match forensic samples recovered from the body Thai detectives will have to start working on another, more shadowy scenario: that instead of being murdered by a fellow backpacker, as they suspect, Kirsty was killed at random by someone who slipped in - and out- of the compound of her guesthouse unnoticed. </p> <p>Fresh details of the murder which emerged yesterday served only to make the case more baffling. Wiggett, who met Kirsty last week while they both went on a three-day trekking expedition, yesterday recounted how she had dinner with her on the night of her death. They were joined by Nathan Foley, 27, a traveller with Australian and British nationality. </p> <p>Foley, too, was staying at the guesthouse, in a room just down the corridor from Kirsty's. After dinner he left to phone his girlfriend, while Kirsty and Sarah went shopping in the night bazaar. </p> <p>Wiggett said: 'I bought a bag. Kirsty bought two tops as Christmas presents for her parents. She wanted to get a present for her mum. </p> <p>'I left at 11.30pm. I was knackered and went back. Kirsty just wanted to walk up a bit [further] and look for presents.' </p> <p>No one is sure whether Kirsty returned alone, or was followed. At 1am almost everyone at the guesthouse was woken up by screaming coming from her room. </p> <p>Stephen Trigg, a British backpacker, who had been sleeping upstairs, said: 'I heard, \"Get out, get out, get out, leave me alone, leave me alone!\"' </p> <p>Channet, who was in the shower, was alerted by his girlfriend and went downstairs. He concluded - wrongly - that Kirsty had been involved in a lovers' tiff. </p> <p>The partly-clothed body lay undiscovered for 14 hours. Soon after it was found, Thai journalists descended on the murder scene. Instead of sealing off the room, the police allowed them in to photograph Kirsty who was lying face down on the bed, her stomach propped on a pillow. The lurid pictures were published the following day. </p> <p>Last night many of her personal effects were still lying scattered in her room unclaimed: underwear, an alarm clock, a green raincoat, a razor, shampoo, chewing gum and a card from a local art gallery. The police removed her purple rucksack and the dark blue sarong with which she was strangled. But they made little effort to tidy up, prompting accusations of incompetence. </p> <p>'They have been very casual,' Wiggett said. 'Certainly a murder investigation in Britain would have been handled differently.' </p> <p>At 3.30am on Friday Foley arrived back at the guesthouse, where he was greeted by plainclothes police officers. The electrician was one of the few people who claimed to have slept through the previous night after taking, he said, two pills for an upset stomach. </p> <p>On Thursday morning he went to a lesson on his Thai massage course as usual. Later, however, he had a 'gut feeling' that something was wrong, he said. </p> <p>Foley was interviewed by the police for 13 hours. He denied having anything to do with the murder. 'I didn't do it. I spent a lot of time with Kirsty, that was all,' he said. 'I'm just shattered that something like this could happen.' </p> <p>Kirsty's fate has frightened Chiang Mai's backpackers. 'It's going to lose them tourism if they don't catch her killer,' Wiggett said. 'The atmosphere has changed in the last few days. People don't feel comfortable any more.' </p> <p>'Her murder just doesn't add up.' </p> <p>In the murdered woman's home town of Brecon, in South Wales, her parents, Sue and Glyn Jones, spoke of her love of travel. 'She had a great sense of adventure. </p> <p>'We had told her of our worries about her backpacking alone and were concerned about her. But she loved seeing the world and mixing with different sorts of people. </p> <p>'We got a promise from her this would be her last trip. She was determined to go back this one last time. But it cost her her life.'</p>",
  "<p>A major survey by hospital consultants has revealed that ageism is rife in the National Health Service. Younger patients are up to twice as likely as older ones to be given the best available treatment, their report reveals. </p> <p>The consultants conclude that many older patients are dying unnecessarily. Charities for the elderly have been so alarmed by the findings they have demanded an urgent government inquiry. </p> <p>The study, based on the records of 12,000 patients in 20 hospitals, will be published in September's edition of the journal Injury. It reveals that when older people go to accident and emergency wards they are less likely to get most types of care than younger people. </p> <p>The report shows that a 70-year-old with the same injury as a 30-year-old is 26 per cent less likely to be admitted to intensive care, and 35 per cent less likely to be sent to the resuscitation room. A 70-year-old patient with a severe head injury is only half as likely to be sent to a specialist neurosurgery ward as a 30-year-old. On average, the chance of getting many treatments decreases by 1 per cent for each year of life. </p> <p>Alice Hunt, of Age Concern, said: 'It is disgusting. This research shows that age discrimination cannot be dismissed as mere isolated incidents, and that it appears to be a common practice to pass over older patients for treatments and referrals.' </p> <p>The report looked only at hospitals in Scotland, but the authors insist the situation is almost certainly the same - if not worse - south of the border. </p> <p>The main author, Dr Patrick Grant, an A&amp;E consultant at the Western Infirmary in Glasgow, admitted: 'It is difficult to argue against this. Society as a whole may have some subconsciously ageist philosophy.' </p> <p>Even adjusting for the fact that the old are more likely to be weak and have other medical conditions, the authors found that far more died than expected. </p> <p>'We consider the outcomes for the injured elderly could be improved by a more dynamic approach to their management,' the report concludes. </p> <p>Grant suggested that the ageism was systematic in the way A&amp;E departments operate, but insisted it was not due to ageist attitudes from staff. </p> <p>'It's probably implicit rationing. When resources are really stretched, perhaps older people lose out. If you have one neuro surgery bed, and three patients, you say that maybe the 80-year-old won't do as well,' he said. </p> <p>However, doctors also often deny treatment to elderly patients because they are pessimistic about the chances of them responding. 'This can become a self-fulfilling prophecy,' said Grant. </p> <p>Medical staff also take too little account of how apparently small injuries can be life-threatening to older people. Ambulance staff and doctors are more likely to put people in the intensive 'resuscitation room' if the patient has really dramatic injuries - which are more common with the young. However, the lives of the elderly can be just as threatened by small injuries - such as from a fall - which are far less dramatic and easier to overlook. In the United States, elderly patients with moderate injuries must be treated as seriously as younger patients with major injuries - but there are no such official recommendations in the UK. </p> <p>Jonathan Ellis, the 'Dignity on the Ward' campaigner for Help the Aged, also blamed the training of doctors: 'Two-thirds of patients are over 65, but the amount of training medical staff have with the elderly is very limited. Often staff don't know how to meet the needs of these patients.' </p> <p>Charities welcomed the study because it made it more difficult for the Government to dismiss allegations of ageism in the NHS as anecdotal. Ellis said: 'Ageism in the NHS needs to be tackled urgently, but the Department of Health just comes up with bland statements. The Government is naive suggesting that things are ticking along nicely.' </p> <p>A Department of Health spokesperson said: 'Discrimination of any kind - whether it is on the basis of age, race or gender - is completely unacceptable in the NHS. </p> <p>'We are developing a blueprint for services for older people which will set national standards of care. This will address issues of concern to older people, including access to services on the basis of clinical need.' </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:anthony.browne@observer.co.uk\">anthony.browne@observer.co.uk</a></p> <p><strong>'My mother was left to die because she was old'</strong></p> <p>Robert Smith became convinced that many medical staff were ageist when his mother died last year. Mary Smith, 74, had started coughing up blood. At 2am she was driven to the local hospital, where she had worked as a nurse for 28 years. </p> <p>Mrs Smith waited in pain in casualty for more than two hours. 'It was a very quiet night; they had extra staff on, but no one came near her. They were too busy laughing and joking with each other,' said her son. When she was finally examined, she couldn't remember what medication she was on. 'The doctor became very rude and even told her to shut up and stop babbling on,' Mr Smith said. </p> <p>Mrs Smith was only given a pain-killing injection. She died five hours later. 'The fact she wasn't treated and the attitude of the staff definitely contributed to her death. If she'd been even 10 years younger, I'm certain she would have got better treatment,' he said. </p> <p>'Old people are seen as a drain on NHS resources. But these are the people who paid their contributions all their life. What did they pay for?'</p>",
  "<p>Safe and affordable space travel, self-assembling consumer goods, no pollution, food for all and an end to illness, ageing and even death. Sounds like science fiction, or a politician's wish list? Yet these things will all happen within most of our lifetimes, if the scientists who are racing to deliver this brave new world are to be believed. </p> <p>Whatever is driving the technological gold rush to the patent office, one thing is clear: scientific progress is exponential and will alter all our lives as the new millennium gets under way. Below is just a hint of the shape of things to come. </p> <p>\u0095 Some scientists think they are on the road to turning fiction into reality thanks to advances in nanotechnology, the science of construction on scales of a billionth of a metre. Within a few years, IBM researchers and others believe they will succeed in creating the first robot capable of self-replicating. Last week scientists on both sides of the Atlantic successfully built a submicroscopic machine using DNA. This could enable the development of incredibly powerful and cheap electronic devices. </p> <p>A nanotech future may be 40 years away and rely on a steady stream of funding, but this marriage of engineering and chemistry could have the most profound effect on humanity, with micro-mach-ines wandering around our bodies fixing damage, extending our lives and, possibly, keeping us young. </p> <p>\u0095 Homes in the future will not be accessed by keys. Instead, you will unlock doors by pressing your finger prints on a special pad. Your eyes will enable you to access money or cross borders into foreign countries. Welcome to the world of biometrics. Biometric technology is easy to use and is becoming more affordable. Senior executives at Japanese giant Sony last May said biometrics would solve internet security fears. Other firms getting in on the act include Unisys and UK company TSSI. Today Lotus uses a handscanning device to allow its employees to remove their children from its work cr\u00e8che. At Coca Cola, workers enter offices and literally punch the clock using their hands. At Vancouver airport, frequent flyers can use a handscanning device to get through customs quickly. </p> <p>\u0095 At last an economic use for recycled glass. Quoted UK construction materials company RMC Group is turning recycled glass into tarmac for roads. RMC collects glass from local authorities, crushes it to the size of a stone and replaces 30 per cent of its normal aggregate material - limestone, granite or quarried stone - with glass. RMC just won a contract to use the technology in Warwickshire. The company believes 'glasphalt' will lift off after 2002 when an aggregate tax is introduced - recycled glass will be exempt. So recent press stories saying there is no point in recycling glass should be put back in the bottle. </p> <p>\u0095 After 23 years flying billions of miles, the Voyager space mission is only now starting to leave the outer reaches of our universe. But scientists are close to making long-distance space travel a 'speedy' reality. Using solar sails it will soon be possible for rockets to fly at speeds of 50 miles per second. Solar sails harness photons from the Sun and use them to push a spacecraft along. Their drawback lies in the sheer size of sail required to trap enough photons to produce effective thrust. However, inflatable booms supporting vast, ultra-thin reflectors could soon provide the answer to maintaining the sail's shape and result in practicable, free propulsion for space probes. In time, some scientists say, this technology could be applied to boats and planes on Earth. </p> <p>\u0095 Anyone who thinks that the mutual society is dead had better think again. Buying groups will help drive the economy of the future. They work by businesses clubbing together to bulk-order anything from stationery to insurance. It's possible to get 25 per cent discounts buying this way - vast cost savings previously enjoyed only by multinationals. Consultancy firm London Economics estimates small businesses could save \u00a324 billion, or 3 per cent of UK GDP, through forming buying groups. Already there are a number of 'intelligent intermediaries' which are encouraging small businesses to form collectives. Companies such as GroupTrade will grow rich by rounding up small businesses like sheep and organising their orders. </p> <p>\u0095 In five years, the current software industry will be dead,' says Nick Harper, technical architect of Webgenerics - a leading e-business solution provider. 'Why buy a CD for \u00a3200 when you can pay 25p for an application over the web?' Harper is talking about Application Service Provider, possibly the biggest innovation in information technology. We will access all our software via the web instead of by a CD, which is out of date by the time you install it. The result will be increased efficiency for businesses, which won't have to pay for as many technical back-up staff or for software upgrades. The dream of teleworking will become a workable reality thanks to ASP. For Microsoft, it will mean a seismic shift and the mass closure of its CD pressing plants. </p> <p>\u0095 Vaccine specialist Cantab Pharmaceuticals is testing a vaccine that blocks the addictive effects of cocaine on humans. It reports that so far there have not been any adverse reactions. It is also in the first pre-clinical stages of formulating a drug to prevent nicotine addiction. At least five other companies are in the advanced stages of animal testing for antibody therapies against two of the most dangerous drugs around: angel dust (phencyclidine) and ice (methamphetamine). Addiction-cure drugs are here and will raise a host of ethical issues. They are being developed for addicts and are not considered to be a preventative measure - for now. </p> <p>\u0095 It's enough to make a humourless Vulcan come out in a wry smile: the science fiction of 'beaming' objects from place to place is now a reality - at least for particles of light. In 1993, a team of North American scientists backed by IBM discovered a way to use quantum mechanics for teleportation. Two years ago scientists succeeded in 'entangling' a photon - a quantum of electromagnetic radiation - one metre across a lab bench. The California Institute of Telechnology and the University of Wales in Bangor are leaders in this research, which could eventually usher in a new kind of hyper-intelligent internet using quantum theory to 'teleport' information around the globe. </p> <p>Beaming yourself out of a traffic jam straight to the beach is still a pipe-dream, however. </p> <p>\u0095 The internal combustion engine will soon be history - oil reserves will not sustain its voracious appetite. The race is on to get the hydrogen-powered fuel cell car on sale. Fuel cell cars emit only water from their exhausts. Vauxhall claims its Zafira model has a top speed of 87 mph and says its 209lb stainless steel tank holds 11lb of hydrogen,which allows you to drive 250 miles before a refill. Honda, DaimlerChrysler and Ford all have equivalent products. At present, mass-producing a fuel cell engine would cost \u00a320,000, compared with \u00a32,000 for a diesel one. Still a way to go, but cars run on fuel cells will be with us by 2004. </p> <p>\u0095 Stem cells have been described as life's magic cauldron. A human starts as one cell - a fertilised egg - and divides to several trillion. Some of these cells are stem cells, which go to form anything a human body might need. Two years ago scientists discovered how to make new stem cells. Neuro stem cell therapy is possibly where the most exciting possibilities lie. </p> <p>A dozen biotech companies are working in this field: one is ReNeuron, which says that in the next 10 years the therapy could reverse the effects of strokes, brain damage through road accidents, epilepsy and dementia. ReNeuron is set to enter clinical trials within two years. </p> <p>The biggest problem is that ethical concerns have forced politicians in the US to withdraw public money from these projects. In Britain, red tape blocks neuro stem cell therapy's path. </p> <p>\u0095 Additional research by Ruth Hallam</p>",
  "My footballing career peaked with an appearance on the subs bench for Hudson Primary School under-11s in 1971, and my musical skills have never progressed beyond doing the dance to 'Tiger Feet' by Mud while strumming a tennis racquet in front of the mirror. So there is only one route left in this celebrity-crazed world if I am to become rich, famous and adored by thousands of women. I have to become a chef. <p>Therefore, for the past nine weeks I've been chopping, slicing, peeling, whisking, boning and beating. I've sieved soups and made mayonnaise. I've stuffed most varieties of farmyard animal and even a couple of ocean-dwelling fish. I've wrestled with bread dough and been tender with pasta. My hands always smell of garlic and my fingers bear the cuts and coloured plasters of many misjudged slices. I dream of owning a restaurant, and have nightmares about lumpy b\u00e9chamel sauce. And now here I am in the late-night glow of an Anglepoise lamp swotting up on how to fillet a trout and make flaky pastry on the eve of a three-hour practical exam that will determine whether I can add the words 'Cordon Bleu-qualified' to my dinner-party repartee. </p> <p> <b> Week 1 </b></p> <p> If cheffing really is the new rock'n'roll, with Jamie Oliver as Oasis to Ainsley Harriot's Kajagoogoo, then I'm the busker you try to avoid outside your local shopping centre. This is brought home to me within hours of arriving at the Victorian country pile just outside Woking that is the Tante Marie School of Cookery. My fellow students all have more cooking experience than me. One of them has even made a souffl\u00e9. The second thing that hits me is that I really am back at school, with loads of rules to be obeyed. For the \u00a33,000 I'm paying for my Cordon Bleu Certificate course, I am not allowed to use the front door or main staircase (tradesman's entrance and narrow back stairs only), I have to address all my teachers formally by their titles and surnames, and I have to wash up my own pots and pans. School dinners, however, won't be quite as I remember them. From now on, I will be cooking and eating the sort of lunch that merits cigars, brandies and afternoon naps all round. Lesson one: if each dish doesn't contain enough butter or cream to clog up several arteries, it ain't Cordon Bleu. </p> <p>My new classmates are a fairly accurate cross-section of the kind of people who enrol at Tante Marie. There's the 18-year-old Sloanie whose parents have not only stumped up for the course, but bought her a new sports car and house as an incentive to pass. There's the Lotus-driving, burnt-out City head-hunter who's just bought a hotel. There's the competitive housewife from Surrey with too much time and money on her hands. There's the relentlessly polite Japanese student who's flown in from Tokyo with the latest cookery books and hardly a word of English. There's the shy teenager from Thailand, reputedly the son of one of Bangkok's richest families. And then there's me, the docker's son from Liverpool, blowing the last of my savings on dreams of Michelin stars and serving seared scallops and pancetta on a bed of baby spinach to Liz Hurley. </p> <p>The first stage towards fulfilling this fantasy is considerably less glamorous: I have to change into my chef's whites and apron in a pokey locker room amid a heaving, sweaty mass of spotty English youths and big, bearded Texans (the female section is much more spacious, complete with window, mirrors and a sofa). Then I find I'm on floor-sweeping duties and that my cooking partner for the first week will be Mariko from Tokyo, who smiles and says 'thank you' to everything I ask her, including 'Have you weighed out the flour yet?' </p> <p>The first recipes we tackle are designed to introduce us to the basic skills of chopping up veg and sauce-making. The Cordon Bleu-approved way of dicing an onion - involving a series of precise horizontal incisions - is more geometry than gourmet. And the way we are shown how to crush a garlic clove bears no resemblance to the way Jamie Oliver splats his with the palm of his hand in that Sainsbury's ad. </p> <p>By the end of the first week, I have made chilli con carne, tagliatelle al forno and a batch of scones. And I have been told off twice for licking my spoon. </p> <p> <b> Week 2 </b> </p> <p>Spent the weekend back home in Manchester impressing my girlfriend with my new onion-chopping tech nique. Arrived back at school to find my partner this week is Ollie the head-hunter turned hotelier. When I ask what kind of business plan he has to put together to get a bank loan for his hotel, he looks a bit sheepish. Turns out he didn't need a loan. Ollie is 27. </p> <p>Most afternoons involve having the following day's recipes demonstrated to us. The school's star demonstrator is Miss Bond, who casually whips up a three- or four-course meal in the time it takes me to read the instructions on the side of a microwave meal-for-one. We get stiff necks from trying to keep up with her every move in the overhead mirror. 'Am I going too fast?' she asks, blushing innocently. </p> <p>We bake our first loaves of bread. To me, this feels as portentous as a rite of passage. I get the same buzz from turning out my plump brown loaf as I did the first time I changed a wheel on my car. </p> <p>The Tante Marie two-volume cookbook contains nearly 2,000 recipes, lovingly compiled by head teacher Mrs Alexander and a former colleague. There are 14 pages of potato recipes alone, ranging from pommes de terre Mont d'Or (a fancy mash piled into a pyramid shape) to pommes de terre Pont-Neuf (chips the size of bridge girders). The potato dish we are cooking this week seems to sum up everything we need to know about Cordon Bleu: why do things simply and call it a baked potato, when you can add some cheese, double cream, egg, herbs and breadcrumbs and call it pommes de terre farcies \u00e0 la viennoise? </p> <p>Contrary to a rumour probably started by Rory the gay Texan in Group Six, Arancia Caramella isn't the name of the school principal's evil stepmother. It's oranges in syrup on page 327. </p> <p> <b> Week 3 </b></p> <p> There are five kitchens at the school, all named after regions of France, and we all dread being timetabled in Alsace. This is at the top of the building and involves lugging buckets of ingredients up and down three flights of stairs. Dozens of aproned students racing up and down to meet lunchtime service deadlines gives the school a convincing working-restaurant feel. There's even a scary Gordon Ramsay-type figure in the shape of the brisk and efficient Miss Hatcher, whose stern glare has been known to make souffl\u00e9s droop. </p> <p>Having last week made shortcrust pastry, we are now going to attempt pastry making the traditional French way, without the safety cushion of a mixing bowl. We are going to make a slab of pat\u00e9 bris\u00e9e by mixing together the flour, butter and egg on a board, one-handed ! Heroically, I manage to keep most of the ingredients within a five-metre radius of my work surface, and sure enough a solid form begins to take shape in my hands out of the gooey, powdery mess. OK, it's only the pastry base for a quiche Alsacienne, but to me it's something beautiful and delicate hewn from the coarsest of raw elements. </p> <p>This is the week we are also introduced to the delights of filleting and skinning fish. We are warned that filets de plie m\u00e9nag\u00e8re - baked fillets of plaice in a mushroom and cheese sauce - is a likely exam dish. This is disheartening news: the amount of flesh I've managed to extract from my fish would be barely enough to feed a skinny cat, never mind a party of four. At the weekend, I buy a bulk order of plaice from my local fishmonger. Late on Saturday night, I finally satisfy myself that I have got the technique right, and am spared plaice on toast for Sunday breakfast. </p> <p> <b> Week 4 </b></p> <p> More pastry, this time flaky. I'm really getting into kneading, rolling and folding, and am entertaining images of becoming a pastry chef, all smooth dough and bulging biceps, when there is a distinct squelching from under my rolling pin. My butter and lard is starting to melt in the heat from the ovens which have been on most of the day. Time for one more fold and turn before slamming it into the fridge. We'll be sticking it on top of a chicken-and-mushroom pie tomorrow. </p> <p>We make ice cream. Now I'm sorry, but I didn't think vanilla ice cream was made , I thought it was excavated from a secret cave somewhere in the Caspian Mountains and transported by Cossacks to my local Tesco. And now here I am - with four eggs, a jug of milk and cream, a cup of sugar and a vanilla pod - about to make my own. The only dampner on my excitement is that my partner for this is Competitive Housewife, who has failed to grasp the concept of 'working together'. </p> <p>Our weekly theory class involves joints of meat and ways of cooking them: chump chops or scrag end of lamb anyone? This is only marginally less dull than last week's class on the pros and cons of microwave ovens, but not as interesting as next week when we will learn how to correct curdled mayonnaise and lumpy b\u00e9chamel sauce. The teachers try their best, but they're just not as inspiring with a marker pen and flip chart as they are with a fruit knife or spatula. </p> <p> <b> Week 5 </b></p> <p> Two days off for half-term. Spend most of it cooking for my girlfriend. Shame she's a vegetarian - I feel like an artist denied his full palette of colours. Also have to swot up for our culinary-terms test. The difference between 'd\u00e9glacer' and 'd\u00e9graisser' could mean delight or disgrace in the end of term results. </p> <p>Back at school we have a pasta class. Using a pastry board and one hand, we mix together flour, eggs, salt and oil. After letting it relax in the fridge for 30 minutes, we roll the dough to unimagined extremities of thinness. Mrs Alexander's daughter won't let us stop until the pasta is practically transparent. We'll have the option of a pasta machine next time, but for now she wants us to sweat blood, tears and garlic. </p> <p>We also have a crash course in wine appreciation. We whizz through the vineyards of Bordeaux, Burgundy, Australia and New Zealand. This will lead to a heated argument in my local Oddbins on the way home. </p> <p> <b> Week 6 </b></p> <p> We've been cooking offal all morning, so today's the perfect day to escape school lunch for the simple pleasures of a tuna salad sandwich from M&amp;S. </p> <p>In the afternoon we are each given an envelope containing \u00a35. This is the funding for our budget lunch, our first practical exam in two weeks' time, when we'll be expected to provide a three-course meal for four people. Before then, we have to prepare details of what we propose to cook, a costings breakdown and timeplan. I raid the school library looking for ideas. By the weekend I have decided on carrot and coriander roulade as a starter, followed by herbed mushroom ravioli in a tomato sauce, accompanied by broccoli in lemon butter, finished off with chocolate and orange mousse. On Saturday I undertake my first rehearsal. I complete it on time, it tastes OK, but my girlfriend's kitchen is left resembling the aftermath of a Sierra Leone Freedom Fighters' convention. </p> <p> <b> Week 7 </b></p> <p> As Miss Bond demonstrates the subtle art of 'tunnel-boning' a shoulder of lamb, she reveals she is actually a vegetarian. The previous day, she'd had to ask for a volunteer from the Diploma class to kill a lobster: 'I was shaking. Its eyes were looking at me. I thought, \"I can't kill you.\" I got Chris to do it. He just lowered it into the pan and put the lid on. We had to keep a tight hold of the lid. It weighed a pound, so we gave it 10 minutes, plus an extra 10.' </p> <p>This week we make the thinnest pastry yet, for apple strudel. You have to tickle and stretch it gently, until it's as wispy as muslin. Do the final pricings for my budget lunch. I've found a fino sherry in Safeways that works out at 9p for the tablespoon I need, and eggs work out at 6p each in Tesco, though I'll have to pretend the herbs are from my dad's allotment to keep my total to \u00a34.99. </p> <p> <b> Week 8 </b> </p> <p>The day of the budget-lunch exam is here. I never imagined I would feel this nervous. About halfway through, I suddenly lose the ability to grate a carrot. With Mrs Wooton keeping an eagle eye on our every move from the corner, it's an intimate torture, like taking your driving test. Did I chop that onion speedily enough? Is my section as clean as it should be? Is this sheet of pasta thin enough? Did she notice that drop of sweat that just landed on it? </p> <p>As I serve up, I notice one of my ravioli squares has split. I bury it at the bottom of the dish beneath the tomato sauce. We are shooed out of the kitchen while Mrs Wooton, Mrs Alexander and the principal Mrs O'Donovan judge our offerings. It's only then, as we listen for sounds of laughter or retching, that I realise the right side of my body has tensed up so much, I've lost all feeling in it. </p> <p> <b> Week 9 </b> </p> <p>Ollie gets top marks with 69.5 per cent. I get 67, which I don't think is anywhere near worthy of the richness of my roulade or quality of my pasta. I suppose the broccoli and mousse could have been better, though. Now it's on to our final theory exam. Two hours of questions such as: Name the raising agents for choux pastry and croissants? (Steam and yeast); What is 'scallop' in French? (La coquille St Jacques); Name four foods which are a good source of Vitamin A? (Haven't a clue). </p> <p> <b> Final week - after the exam </b></p> <p> OK, so perhaps last night I spent too much time looking at pictures of fish being filleted. The dish we were given - which we had no prior warning of until we arrived in the kitchen this morning - was actually poulet saut\u00e9 \u00e0 la proven\u00e7al, followed by tarte aux abricots. Chicken, yes, apricots, certainly, but definitely no fish. Instead, we had to joint the chicken. Previously in class, we had been given one chicken to joint between each pair. So before today, I had jointed half a chicken. Once. The exam felt a bit like taking a driving test when you've previously had only one go at reversing around a corner. As I struggled to rip the wings, thighs and breast from the carcass of the tiny fowl, I cursed Tante Marie: you'd have thought for 3,000 quid, they could have at least found us a chicken each to practice on. </p> <p>A properly jointed chicken will yield eight pieces. I ended up with five. My exam result is pending. By the time this is published, I'll know my fate: whether I can start applying for cook's jobs, or have to get back to practising my dance steps in front of the bedroom mirror. </p> <p> <b> Postscript</b></p> <p> I managed to scrape through the final practical with 54 per cent. I'm convinced it would have been higher if the chickens-to-students ratio had been more generous. However, I gained an overall pass in the practical, and a pass with credit in the theory, and have spent the past couple of weeks registering with various catering agencies. Admittedly, my CV is a little on the short side at the moment, and the only definite job I've been offered is demonstrating a particular brand of non-stick frying pan in Kendal's kitchenware department in Deansgate, but hey, even Jamie Oliver had to start somewhere. Didn't he?</p> <p>\u0095 Tante Marie School of Cookery offers a range of Cordon Bleu cookery courses, costing from \u00a33,000 for the one-term Certificate, to \u00a310,000 for the year-long Diploma.

  "<p>'Everyone loves you and everything's free/We're always the face everyone wants to see/Life goes by in a velvet rope blur/In through the back by the fire escape stairs/Everyone loves us and everything's free/Always in the place everyone wants to be' <br><strong>from Peakin' by Bleachin' </strong></p> <p> Jeremy Healy is a DJ. Ranked by fame, fortune or ability to attract paying customers through the door of a club, he's probably in the top 10 worldwide. He's a star, whose earnings for a good weekend run well into five figures. Under the name Bleachin', he has just released an album with his friend Amos Pizzey - one of those people everyone in London knows, even if few of them could say exactly what it is that Pizzey does. Bleachin' is an Afro-Caribbean term for serious partying, for going without sleep so long that your face turns white. It's also the name of the album's first track, the story of a nonstop three-night bender in Paris and London which the duo enjoyed two years ago. The first few copies of the album, Everyone Loves You, Everything's Free , come in a limited- edition, mirrored CD case complete with rolled-up note. As you may have guessed, it's about a certain lifestyle: about celebrity parties, guest lists and free champagne, about bright cocaine nights and the dark, empty comedowns that inevitably follow. For Pizzey especially, it's an intensely personal record. You could say he'd been researching it most of his life. </p> <p> Tuesday, 8.30am, Eurostar terminal at Waterloo. Pizzey is in his element. He has friends to entertain, strangers to charm, a party to organise. He's telling stories and jokes, cheerfully moving passengers around our first-class carriage so that we can all sit together, trying to persuade everyone to stay the night in Paris and go out. Meanwhile, he's on the mobile with his record label, trying to persuade them to hold the launch party for his album on a yacht in Ibiza. </p> <p>Annie Leibovitz is undertaking a marathon shoot for the September issue of US Vogue: 12 fashion designers with the friends who inspire them, shot in several countries over a period of 16 days. Pizzey, Trish Simenon and Annabelle Neilson are going to Paris to be photographed with John Galliano; Pizzey's girlfriend, the radio and TV presenter Lisa I'Anson, has come along to shop; I'm just there for the ride. </p> <p>From the Gare du Nord, a limo whisks us to the opulent restaurant where the shoot is to take place. An army of Vogue stylists and a rack of gorgeous Dior dresses is waiting. Galliano himself arrives straight from the airport at 5pm; Healy, who has provided the soundtrack to every catwalk show the designer has produced since his graduation, has flown in sleepless from Mallorca, where he has been playing all night at the vast BCM club; celebrity party organiser Fran Cutler and her sister Charlotte have come in from Ibiza, where they've been visiting Fran's business partner, Meg Mathews, at her home on the island. </p> <p>As they finally settle down for the shoot, they are asked to act like there's a party going on. It's no great stretch. Most of this group have known each other for years, and were there for Galliano when times were tough and his talent wasn't so richly rewarded. There's a lot of banter, a lot of loud laughter. Leibovitz takes just 30 minutes to capture an illusion of late-night glamour, and then the real night begins. Taxis arrive to transport everyone to rooms at the swish Hotel Costes, then there's an hour by the pool and dinner at a hip new Moroccan restaurant. Late that night, I get a taxi home. Reaching for the fare, I realise it's the first time I've paid for anything all day. </p> <p> Jeremy Healy was born in Peckham, south-east London 'a restless spirit, full of vague, unspoken ambitions'. On the bus to school, he'd met George O'Dowd, from the nearby suburb of Eltham. They began going out together, dressing up, becoming faces in the emerging club scene, living in squats and getting their photos in the new style magazines. Inevitably, they both joined bands. Healy's band, Haysi Fantayzee, got a record deal by making a cheap video and sending out a sheaf of promotional photographs, making them one of the first acts to realise the power that image was to play in the MTV decade. They hit the charts in July 1982 with the gloriously titled 'John Wayne Is Big Leggy'. O'Dowd's band, Culture Club, got its first hit single two months later, but proved to have rather more longevity. Healy, meanwhile, moved from making records to playing them, becoming a star DJ in the small, enclosed world that was 80s clubland. The elite got into clubs for free, drank cocktails in VIP rooms, enjoyed trips to New York, Japan, Ibiza. At the time, this seemed the height of sophistication but, like so much about the 80s, it proved to be just an over-dressed rehearsal for the decade to come. When the acid-house boom took club culture mainstream, going out dancing became something all kids did, not just the strangely dressed ones. Suddenly there were cool dance clubs in every town and city in Britain, and then across the globe. </p> <p>When the scene exploded, Healy employed his friend Fran Cutler, to organise his bookings for him. She went on to start one of the first DJ agencies and is one of the people credited by disgruntled promoters for raising DJ fees up into the stratosphere. Some time around 1993, Healy challenged Cutler to book him somewhere absurd, somewhere new, and she sent him to a club in Norway just by the Arctic Circle. It was then, he said, that he began to understand that he could take his records and get paid to go anywhere in the world. </p> <p> Friday, 9pm, Seven - the restaurant above Home nightclub in Leicester Square. Pizzey is holding court, as he does every Friday, before hosting the night at Home's members' bar on the floor above. He is entertaining the close friends on his table with the story of his doomed attempt to enjoy a quiet New Year's break in Thailand with I'Anson. (It involves various celebrities, plus a man with a gun, a helicopter, and things the libel laws wouldn't allow me to even hint at here.) The club pays Pizzey to host the night, to invite his friends along, have a few drinks and a few laughs. He's too diplomatic to mention it, but before he got involved, the place was dead. To kick it off, Pizzey set up a few parties for famous friends, peaking with an event for John Galliano that saw 1,400 people pass through the bar - including the reigning queen of the London party A-list, Madonna. 'After that,' he says casually, 'it was pretty much up and running.' </p> <p> Amos Pizzey was born in west London. His father, an ex-naval officer, worked in television. His mother, Erin, a diplomat's daughter, founded the first refuge for battered women in Chiswick, bringing the issue of domestic violence out into the open. After they divorced, his dad lived in a flat in the basement of their home with various girlfriends, while Erin unofficially fostered a group of young men Pizzey grew up regarding as his half-brothers. All of them were black, all older than him: 'They were my role models, which is where my cultural confusion stemmed from. I didn't know it, but I had real problems being white at that time.' </p> <p>His liberal parents told him he didn't have to go to school if he didn't want to. So he took his education instead in illegal shebeens, following reggae sound systems. By the time he was 13, he was performing himself, a white boy improvising on the mic in fluent patois. 'I was pretty wild,' he recalls. 'I couldn't write, but I couldn't half rock the mic!' </p> <p>His sister's boyfriend, Mickey Craig, had also moved into their household, and invited Pizzey to join his group, Culture Club. Pizzey worked with them under the alias Captain Crucial. He was 14 and the band was just on the verge of pop success when his mother dropped her bombshell: they were moving to New Mexico. 'The next thing I knew, I was in the desert in Santa Fe. A white kid with dreadlocks, surrounded by cowboys. Not a good move.' For years, Erin Pizzey's life had been a battle. Against the local authority about overcrowding at the refuge. Against feminists, who first celebrated her, then objected to her analysis of the causes of domestic violence. And finally against the legal system, when she refused to reveal the whereabouts of a woman and child she'd smuggled to safety in France. </p> <p>Pizzey remembers being in court with people like Spike Milligan who had taken up his mother's cause, watching her get sent to prison. She was eventually released, but decided to leave Britain. 'It was a bad period,' says Pizzey. 'I'm very proud of my mother. But it wasn't great, a lot of it. She was under a lot of pressure.' </p> <p>In the next few years, they moved across New Mexico, to the Caribbean and then to Italy. By the time he was 16 he was back in London alone, with a fierce self-belief that he says was his mother's gift to him. With his half-brother Cass (now in Skunk Anansie), he formed an abysmal band called Dark Star. They recorded one demo, a calypso version of 'My Girl', and signed a massive record deal. 'I loved the 80s,' laughs Pizzey. 'They gave us a quarter of a million quid. I was 17, Richard Branson took me out to lunch and said, \"You're it, you're going to be the thing.\"' </p> <p>Pizzey didn't have a driving licence, but he had a Jag. And suits with shoulder pads so wide he had to go through doors sideways. They spent two years in the studio, but the resulting album was predictably dire, and the group was dropped. 'If we'd been successful, I would have been such a wanker,' says Pizzey philosophically. 'I mean, I'm a wanker now, but I've got a sense of humour. Taking yourself seriously and being a wanker is a different thing: that's Mick Hucknall.' </p> <p>Undeterred, he formed a rock band with Ringo Starr's son Zak Starkey, and they were big in Japan for a while. By the time he returned to London, Ecstasy and house music had arrived, and Pizzey enthusiastically embraced the new scene. He'd known of Healy for years - Boy George had engineered a stand-off between the two over who had the most authentic dreadlocks - but finally they became friends, recording for O'Dowd's dance label More Protein. </p> <p>When Healy played in clubs, Pizzey would often come along to improvise on the mic over the records. It was on a club trip to Singapore and Bali with Healy at the start of the 90s that Pizzey met Melissa Ong, the woman he was to spend the next seven years of his life with. He took her to his swish hotel in Singapore to impress her; she laughed and told him that her father owned it. In fact, her family owns quite a few hotels, across the world. Along with a substantial oil business and a retail empire built around designer fashion. </p> <p>Although the 80s are often seen as the designer decade, the obsession with labels only became big business in the 90s, when entrepreneurs like the Ongs took an interest. At its peak, the company run by Melissa's mother Christina had the franchises to some 60 designer names including Armani, Prada, Donna Karan and Calvin Klein. She opened flagship stores for these labels across Asia, Australia - and, of course, in London, where she also opened the Metropolitan on Park Lane in 1997. A designer hotel very much in the mould set by Ian Schrager in New York, it had a small bar that the Ongs hoped would draw in hip Londoners as well as hotel guests. Since they wanted the bar to be exclusive, Pizzey advised them not to sell memberships. Instead, they gave them away. A thousand cards went out to carefully selected people, and the deluge began. </p> <p>'People are always going to fight if they can't get into something,' he shrugs. 'That's so London. It's just a small, red room, but the scenes that went on in there during the peak two years were just ridiculous.' </p> <p>For a while, it seemed that everyone who was anyone passed through the Met Bar. Fran Cutler and Meg Mathews hosted a night there. Models, actors, pop stars and their entourages partied there. 'It wasn't the celebrities, it was the people around them who started to fascinate me,' says Pizzey, explaining his inspiration for the Bleachin' album. 'They were all supposedly producers, directors, models, actors, but all they really did was bugle [cocaine] in the bar. But then you started to notice fall-out. Certain people would get rougher and rougher, their designer facade would slip and they'd end up hassling you for drugs. I found the whole period fascinating. It was the end of the century, there was an element of fiddling while Rome burns.' </p> <p> Monday, 7pm, yet another new cocktail bar, Zeta's, not far from the Met Bar. Pizzey is here with I'Anson, Healy with his Brazilian girlfriend Luciana Silva. We're meeting before the London Club and Bar Awards at the Hilton - a lavish, self-congratulatory affair that offers yet another illustration of how fast this industry has grown. It's being televised, so there's a short film clip before each award. Pizzey guides us on a tour of some of London's new bars before I'Anson comes on stage to present the Best Bar award to Piccadilly's 10 Rooms. Former EastEnders actor Sid Owen presents the Best Club award, reading out the list of nominees and announcing, 'I've been mashed in all of these places.' It goes to Fabric, and the lady who runs their VIP toilets steps up to collect it, joking that she's seen many of the audience lingering in her cubicles. </p> <p>Meanwhile, from the numbers shuttling to the toilets in groups, the hotel's staff could be forgiven for believing they were at a support night for the chronically weak- bladdered. </p> <p> There's another story to the Bleachin' album, one that is told in the final four tracks, where the titles are less celebratory: 'Comedown', 'Fragile', 'Ambulance' and 'Learn to Cry'. It's the story of the lows that always accompany chemical highs, of the many who lost their souls for a line of white powder. But more specifically, it's the story of Pizzey's nephew Keita. Pizzey's sister Cleo was 15 when Keita was born; the father, Mickey Craig, was two years older. Pizzey talks about Keita as a brother, or a son. 'We slept in the same bed because he got scared at night. I changed his nappies, and he always looked up to me 'way too much, I can see now.' </p> <p>Keita came to clubs when Pizzey performed, and had some talent as a rapper himself 'at one point, there was talk of him signing to Boy George's label. Like many clubbers, he got into Ecstasy. Unlike most, he started hearing voices. Gradually, the Pizzeys began to realise he was seriously ill, and discovered that paranoid schizophrenia ran in his father's side of the family. Pizzey spent a lot of time just talking to him, 'really out-there conversations when he'd hear voices talking to him in records and say me and him were here to fight aliens'. Pizzey got him into The Priory for a while, and Keita went through various NHS schemes without ever getting consistent help. Mostly the family was left trying to deal with his illness alone, his mother and grandmother taking turns to care for him. </p> <p>When he asked for money, Pizzey said he'd buy him food, clothes, anything he needed, but he wouldn't give him cash to buy drugs. One day Keita mugged an old lady. When he was chased, he ran to his own home and sat inside the front door, crying, until the police came. At the station, Keita said he was a danger to himself. The police followed procedure, putting him in a shared cell, checking on him every 15 minutes. But then he was transferred to Wandsworth Prison for the night and, by morning, he was dead - hanged in his cell with his laces. </p> <p>Pizzey blames himself for Keita's death. He didn't take drugs with his nephew, but he has never hidden the fact that he does take them. He thinks he's got away with a lot in his life, by being physically fit, by having good friends, by having places he could go to escape and clean out if it all got too much. He wonders if everyone will be as lucky. 'I think the drugs fallout will be massive over the next few generations, because we're doing shit that we've got no idea about.' </p> <p> Saturday, noon, The Dior couture show at L'\u00c9cole Nationale Sup\u00e9rieure des Beaux-Arts, Paris. On a balcony high in the roof, Healy is pacing about nervously. His music is playing: a simple four-note sequence repeated again and again, punctuated by the crack of a whip and a woman moaning in sexual ecstasy. Below, Steven Spielberg is sitting with his wife Kate Capshaw on one side, Elle Macpherson on the other, brilliantly managing to affect natural-looking conversations with both despite the photographers who surround them in an arc, flashbulbs popping. There's a hush as the show starts with a man in an ornate, feminine bishop's costume, followed by characters from a lavish, yet slightly sinister wedding. As each model moves along the catwalk, the music changes to match the mood. Healy has spent four days in Paris talking through the ideas with Galliano, making the music fit his themes of dysfunctional families and sexual transgression. The final mix includes dance beats, film soundtracks, a stream of obscenities by American performance artist Karen Finlay, and Beethoven's ninth symphony. As always, it's the most exciting music Healy makes. </p> <p>There was a point when he became a symbol of DJ excess. A couple of years ago, he began to slow down. He'd been depressed, he realised, and needed to start enjoying music again, enjoying his life. 'Money isn't everything. Unconsciously, I'd focused so much on my career - and I never thought I would even utter that word - that I was travelling all the time. If you're not around when people phone, after six months no one's going to call you. Success made me quite a lonely person.' Healy's daughter, Marley, was born in 1991. It wasn't something he'd planned, and it didn't make much difference to his life at first: 'I was never with the mother, never said I would be.' But then Marley's mum died. Suddenly, unexpectedly. (In the context of this feature, it seems relevant to say there were no drugs involved.) So Marley came to live with Healy for two days a week, and in their first year together, he finally became a father. 'To see the wonder in her eyes when I show her things is brilliant. It's lovely.' </p> <p>He recently moved into a new apartment in central London after spending months having it fitted to his specifications, yet he talks wistfully of a house he'd seen out in the suburbs, a big house with room for a swimming pool that he says would be lonely without a family to fill it. For now, though, Marley lives in Ibiza with her mother's best friend, who is bringing her up with her own children. Healy doesn't see her as much as he'd like, and he still seems surprised at how painful that is. 'I hope to take on more, to get closer and closer to her. It's difficult, because apart from the summer, I can go two or three months without seeing her, and that tends to hurt. You have to get to know them again, and it takes time to get to that place with them again. That idea of a family may be corny, but to not have that is a lot harder to deal with than to have it. And not to have your daughter with you when you want her to be_ That's one thing I haven't got, and it's about the only thing in my life that could have been worked better.' He pauses then laughs, almost embarrassed. 'But everything else has worked out quite good.' </p> <p> Saturday, 8pm. There's a car waiting at Waterloo. I drive with Healy to his new home. In two hours, he'll leave again to play at a club in Watford. Then it's back to London, where he'll DJ at another club until 5.30am. The next day, he'll fly to Mallorca for another all-nighter, followed by his weekly residency in Ibiza. There are far worse ways to make a living, of course, and Healy certainly isn't complaining. Nonetheless, it's a relentless schedule. Everybody loves you, nothing comes free.</p>",
  "The United Nations is set to launch an attack on the Government's record on race relations, after condemnation from more than 30 British human rights and ethnic minority groups. <p>The criticism is contained in a report submitted by the groups to the UN committee responsible for monitoring racism. It contains claims that the Government's policy on asylum-seekers 'gives comfort to racists' and has led to increased racial tension. </p> <p>It also criticises Ministers for failing to grapple with police hostility to the findings of the Macpherson inquiry into the murder of black teenager Stephen Lawrence. </p> <p>The UN Committee on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination meets every three years and last reported on Britain as Labour came to power. Campaigners believe its findings will, therefore, provide a clear picture of race relations in Tony Blair's Britain. </p> <p>Officials from the Home Office and the Foreign Office will fly tomorrow to Geneva in an attempt to head off the criticism. They will claim that they have met most of the committee's recommendations from 1997. The civil rights and anti-racist groups will make presentations on asylum-seekers, deaths in custody and education. </p> <p>The report has been compiled by the civil rights group Liberty and the anti-racist 1990 Trust from submissions by groups that include the Refugee Council. </p> <p>Maxie Hayles, of the Birmingham Racial Attacks Monitoring Unit, said he had failed to notice any significant change in police attitudes since the Macpherson report was published in February 1999. 'Although there have been some improvements in police policy, this is not getting down to the bully boys on the ground.' he said. </p> <p>The report contains a list of six major areas of concern: </p> <p> \u0095 The number of racist attacks have increased. </p> <p> \u0095 People from ethnic minorities are more likely to be stopped and searched. </p> <p> \u0095 Immigration and asylum policy has become a threat to good race relations. </p> <p> \u0095 New race relation legislation includes exemptions for immigration policy. </p> <p> \u0095 Certain ethnic minorities are more likely to be unemployed. </p> <p> \u0095 Little improvement in the representation of ethnic minorities in public life. </p> <p>It is hoped that the committee will demand public inquiries into the deaths in custody of Alton Manning and Roger Sylvester and the killing of Zahid Mubarak while he was at Feltham young offenders' institution. </p> <p>However, Brenda Weinberg, chair of the United Families and Friends Campaign, which works for the relatives of people who have died in custody, said she was sceptical that anything would come of government plans to set up a fully independent police complaints procedure. </p> <p>The Home Office told The Observer that it had presented its own submission to the discrimination committee (CERD) last May, but said officials would be providing the UN with an update when they arrive tomorrow. 'We are are confident we have fulfilled our reporting obligations to the UN,' a spokesman said. </p> <p>However, the organisations involved said that they had been given less than a week to respond to the Government's submission to CERD. Those which failed to do so were told that it would be assumed they were not interested.</p>",
  "<p><strong> Decky Does a Bronco </strong> Scotland Yard Playground </p> <p><strong> Medea </strong> Assembly Rooms </p> <p><strong> The Bogus Woman </strong> Traverse </p> <p><strong> Abandonment </strong> Traverse </p> <p><strong> Further than the Furthest Thing </strong> Traverse </p> <p><strong> The Donkey Show </strong> Club Pleasance@Potterow </p> <p>Three shows soar above the rest in the first week of the Fringe. They're so diverse that it's as if someone had set out to demonstrate the variety of contemporary theatre. One of them corrals the city itself into its tale of childish bullying and child abuse. The second re-imagines a Classical tragedy. The third is a ferocious piece of political pleading. </p> <p>Decky Does a Bronco is staged - like so much stirring theatre - outside a theatre building. In the aptly named Scotland Yard Playground, Grid Iron Theatre Company have arranged a circle of child-size stools for their audience. Outside loom the grey Edinburgh turrets; in the centre are some children's swings. Swaying idly, these look sweet at the beginning of the evening, and sinister by the end. </p> <p>Douglas Maxwell's play, dynamically directed by Ben Harrison, makes everyday things seem weird. Its gang of boys is played by adults: the spilling-over energy, total crossness and awkward affection of nine-year-olds become disturbing when written large on grown-up faces. </p> <p>As do its obsessions. The 'Bronco' of the title is a swing thing - a trick which involves levering yourself up level with the bar and jumping off: 'What started up as vandalism ended up as a sport.' It's a sport displayed with acrobatic zeal, and discussed with a severity which takes you into the heart of childhood. Observing the exacting rules is as unnerving as taking the entrance exam for the Civil Service; falling short - as does the wee, bullied Decky - means exclusion. </p> <p>The plot of Decky ends grimly. But since the event is open to the outside world, it will always have a slightly different conclusion. </p> <p>Last week, as the hero reflected on the persistence of things after childhood tragedy, a real - proper-size - child burst out of the bushes surrounding the stage and gambolled towards it, carefree and callous - as if to prove his point. After the Festival, the show goes on tour through Scotland. </p> <p>Theatre Babel's superb production of Medea takes as its text Liz Lochheed's Scots version of Euripides . Salty and sardonic, it casts the woman who was once considered a witch as the archetype of the wronged woman. The chorus, in dove-grey, with knotted hair, is a politicised crew of widows, mistresses, wives - all recently- turned worms. Jason is a male-chauvinist pig; Kreon an old-style master, buttoned-up like a church elder or an advocate. </p> <p>There's nothing even-handed about this: it pushes an argument about the unfair lot dealt to women. Nor does it in the end give a really convincing reason - what could it be? - for Medea's murder of her children. But you can quarrel with nothing else in an absorbing, galvanic evening. </p> <p>Maureen Beattie - alone in red, and isolated in her speech, as the incomer in a Scots-speaking Establishment - is magnificent. Her anger is the more effective for containing displays of deflationary humour with which she cajoles the audience before her blackest deeds; she purrs without cease. A national tour follows. </p> <p>You don't often hear people crying in the theatre. But you do during The Bogus Woman. Kay Adshead's play, presented by The Red Room and Mamo Quillo, is a body-blow. </p> <p>Delivered with top-velocity grace by Noma Dumezweni on a brutally bare stage - there's a slop bucket and some gnawed blocks of wood - the play tells the story of an African journalist whose father, husband and baby daughter have been butchered, who has been raped by soldiers, fled her country and who wants to stay in England. 'Why', inquires one of the sweetly sceptical admission officers of the asylum-seeker, 'did they rape you and not kill you?' </p> <p>It's a fictional account in as much as it is the story of no particular woman's life; it's a documentary account in that it draws on the facts of many lives - part of Adshead's research involved talking to a refugee charged with causing riot and affray at the Campsfield Detention Centre in 1997. The result is, she has said, a history 'more shocking than some and less shocking than others'. </p> <p>Its effect is increased by an almost Grecian restraint. The violence has already taken place; what the audience observe is a series of dogged humiliations: casual racial insults from the officers in the camp; the institutionalised contempt which delivers weeny food vouchers and insecure lodgings. Dumezweni makes you feel you are inhabiting a world behind the headlines. </p> <p>Other Traverse shows seem wan in comparison: while nearly every play has something to recommend it, few come across as urgent. Kate Atkinson's likable Abandonment is a case in point. It's in many respects a good advertisement for her novels: full of good sentences and funny, with themes woven together as intricately as a bird's nest. </p> <p>The device of parallel lives seems particularly congenial for examining the stories of women's lives. Atkinson's heroine is a twentieth-century historian, left by her mother as an infant, dumped by her lover, who finds a way of building a family of her own - and whose life is shadowed by that of a nineteenth-century governess. </p> <p>The cast double up across the two time zones: at one point, the faithless lover cradles both Victorian and modern woman. </p> <p>There are no loose ends here: the structure is the story; and it's a story warmly realised in design and warmth of acting. But despite its intimate touches, you are left admiring an apparatus rather than feeling compelled by the heroine. A bit more abandon would have come in handy. </p> <p>Zinnie Harris's Further than the Furthest Thing, a joint production between the Tron and the National, is also freighted with good ideas, not carried lightly. Inspired by the experience of the inhabitants of Tristan da Cunha, evacuated to England in the Sixties when a volcano erupted, it evokes a displanted island culture, whose survival is threatened by realpolitik and metropolitan commercialism. </p> <p>Niki Turner's design is striking: a paralysed wasteland in which stony slopes are supervised by a frozen gush of water. There's a beautifully judged performance by Paola Dionisotti - precise, proudly spoken, emotionally disarrayed. But its boldest stroke - the creation of an island patois - confines its characters to quaintness. </p> <p>Meanwhile, The Donkey Show is playing to packed houses with its clubbing adaptation of A Midsummer Night's Dream . There's no dialogue, but a carnival of undulating, roller-skating, tattooed bodies. Titania, in thigh-high shiny boots and a ruff of peacock feathers, gives new resonance to her name, with butterflies perched on her nipples. As the lovers lose each other in a forest of people, Helena sings 'Don't leave me this way'. The magic potion is a bag of cocaine. It's very New York - and very Edinburgh.</p>"
