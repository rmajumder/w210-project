  "<p>Adding \"co.uk\" on to \"estateagent\", \"homepages\" \"rightmove\", \"propertyproperty\" \"08004homes\" gives access to large numbers of properties across the country. </p> <p>For people who know exactly where they want to live the sites are of limited use. Even the most comprehensive will not be able to compete with a local newspaper. </p> <p>But where they really come into their own is when someone wants to find out about house prices in a certain area whether with a view to choosing somewhere to live or buying a property to let. Those who are simply curious about property prices will also enjoy using these sites. </p> <p>By far the best-designed site for researching prices is home.co.uk. It has nearly 200,000 property particulars, the majority being with estate agents, although private sellers can advertise their homes free. </p> <p>While the information one can glean from this site will not be as accurate as the major house price indexes prepared by the Nationwide and Halifax, these only divide the country up into regions such as East Anglia and the south-west. </p> <p>Prospective buyers can specify a type and size of property, an area of up to 80 miles across and a specific price range. Asking it to find a home for less than \u00a350,000 within a 15-mile radius of London EC1 is an easy way to find out where the cheapest homes are in the capital. This somewhat scotches the popular wisdom that an income of \u00a330,000 is necessary to get a foot on London's property ladder. </p> <p>There are 21 homes avail able for under \u00a346,000, which should be within the range of anyone earning \u00a315,000 and having a small amount of savings. The cheapest are one-bedroom flats in Dagenham and Shooters Hill for \u00a339,995. </p> <p>At the other end of the scale one can find the most expensive properties by seeking those over \u00a35m. Top is a 12-bedroom mansion with an acre of grounds near Holland Park at \u00a315m. Prices fall to \u00a321,400 in Basildon, followed by only slightly more expensive places in Maidstone, Sheerness and Rochester. </p> <p>Birmingham is not always cheaper than the home counties, with prices starting at \u00a322,500 for a one-bedroom flat in the Quinton area. The most expensive house within 20 miles of that city's centre is \u00a3900,000 for a six-bedroom house in Edgbaston. </p> <p>Those desperate for a cheap property will find several in Sheffield, Newcastle and Liverpool for under \u00a310,000. </p> <p>Someone with a very specific area in mind can glean a good deal of information from the site that would have taken ages to obtain by identifying and ringing local agents. For instance, within ten miles of the Scottish border town of Newton St Boswells, there are 21 properties available from a \u00a336,500 two-bedroom apartment to a detached country house for \u00a3285,000. </p> <p>Some areas are not so well catered for though. Within the same distance of Haverfordwest in Pembrokeshire there were only four properties. That though is the exception and for the vast majority of the country home.co.uk has the potential to be used for relatively serious research. </p> <p>\u0095 Richard Colbey is a barrister.</p>",
  "<p>Leading climate scientists now agree that human pollution, mainly from fossil fuels, has added substantially to global warming in the past 50 years and that the Earth is likely to get far hotter than previously predicted, with immense consequences for people and wildlife. </p> <p>A summary of the 1,000-page final draft of new research by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change - a UN-sponsored group made up of the world's leading atmosphere scientists - has been sent to governments this week. It is expected to add urgency to talks on global climate change in the Hague next month, at which Britain intends to take a lead in urging states to set targets and timetables to cut emissions. </p> <p>The report suggests that the upper range of warming over the next 100 years could be far higher than estimated in 1995. Its worst-case scenario raises the average global temperature by 6C (11F) above the 1990 level. Average temperatures today are 5C (9F) higher than they were at the end of the last ice age. Five years ago the panel predicted that average temperatures would, at worst, rise by 3C (6.3F) </p> <p>The leaked document is the first major update of climate prediction since 1995, when the panel concluded that there was \"a discernible human influence\" on the Earth's climate because of the greenhouse effect - which is caused by the buildup of heat-trapping chemicals in the atmosphere. </p> <p>The panel has now concluded that the burning of fossil fuels and emission of man-made chemicals has \"contributed substantially to the observed warming over the last 50 years\". The scientists believe, too, that temperatures could rise far higher and faster than previously predicted if emissions are not curtailed. </p> <p>The human influence on the Earth's climate has long been debated, but this is the first time such an authoritative group has gone so far. </p> <p>While there are still uncertainties, scientists say there is an \"increasing body of observations that provide a collective picture of a warming world that cannot be solely explained by natural forces. Emissions of greenhouse gases and aerosols due to human activities continue to alter the atmosphere in ways that affect the climate system,\" the report says. </p> <p>Many panel members in the US say that the summary represents the closest thing to a consensus possible in science. </p> <p>They point to the additional data gathered in the past three years, which shows that the world is much warmer than any similar string of years in many centuries; improvements in computer models designed to project future trends; and better understanding of the influence of other emissions, such as particles of sulphates which can cool the Earth by reflecting sunlight back into space. </p> <p>Speaking in a personal capacity yesterday, one of the British authors of the report, Mike Hume of the University of East Anglia, described the research as \"incremental back-up\" to what had been suspected for years. </p> <p>\"Our current best insights lead us to see a continuation of global warming and an acceleration of it,\" he said. </p> <p>Evidence of increased warming has been found in retreating glaciers, thinning polar sea ice, retreating snow packs, increased precipitation, and the big rise in weather-related natural disasters . </p> <p>Global warming will deeply affect poor countries, leading to huge numbers of refugees, crop failures, and extreme weather. Most emissions of carbon, the main greenhouse-warming gas, are from rich countries. The US is responsible for 23% of carbon emissions; Britain's 3% is the same as that of Africa. </p> <p>Kevin Trenberth, head of climate analysis at the US National Centre for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) in Boulder, Colorado, said the report showed that global warming was a real problem. </p> <p>\"More and more people working in atmospheric science or on climate or ecology have had to come to grips with the fact that climate change is affecting what they're looking at,\" he said. </p> <p>\"It reinforces what we were able to say in 1995,\" said Tom Wigley, another NCAR climatologist. \"It shows the previous projections in 1990 and 1995 were conservative.\" </p> <p>Some governments may insist on changing the text before it is published in May.</p>",
  "Once again, Northern Ireland first minister David Trimble is struggling to hold his Ulster Unionist party together. <p>The party's ruling council meets tomorrow to vote on a proposal that it withdraw from the power sharing executive - a move that would inevitably shatter the Good Friday peace accord. </p> <p>The council's 860 members are being frantically canvassed by both sides in what has become a bitter struggle for power in the higher levels of the embattled party. </p> <p>One of the ironies of the situation is that the party's grass roots are apparently solidly behind their leader. A poll of Unionist members today produced encouraging results for Trimble: 68% want him to stay as first minister, and nearly 60% say he is the best man to lead the party. </p> <p>That's more than twice as many as those that support his main tormentor, Jeffrey Donaldson. Donaldson, who will be proposing the withdrawal motion at the crucial weekend meeting, is undismayed by Trimble's exasperated charge that he is undermining the party as well as the peace process. He argues that it is the peace process itself which is destroying Unionism. </p> <p>Last month, the party was stunned by its loss of the South Antrim parliamentary byelection to Ian Paisley's stridently anti-Good Friday Democratic Unionist Party. The Donaldson faction believes that if the Unionists stay in the power-sharing executive, their remaining support will simply drain away. </p> <p>Trimble's case is that the party needs to be in power - or at least have a share of it - to influence the course of the broader agreement, which includes the establishment of all-Ireland institutions. </p> <p>Peter Mandelson, the Northern Ireland Secretary, infuriated many loyalists when he suggested that those cross-border institutions could be strengthened, if devolved government proves unworkable. His notion of Anglo-Irish \"joint authority\" in Ulster was intended to jolt the Unionists back into line on power sharing. </p> <p>Instead, it may have strengthened the hand of the hardliners, who want to distance themselves from the peace process by imposing impossibly tough conditions and deadlines. </p> <p>Top of their wish-list is IRA disarmament, and the scrapping of plans to reform the Royal Ulster Constabulary. Neither of those things is going to happen. If that is the road the Ulster Unionists choose to travel this weekend, they are going to be heading nowhere. But if they leave, they will tear a hideously large gap in the delicate fabric of the peace process. </p> <p><b>Useful links:</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/Northern_Ireland\">Special report: Northern Ireland</a> <a href=\"http://www.nio.gov.uk\" target=\"_new\">Northern Ireland Office</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.uup.org\" target=\"_new\">Ulster Unionists</a><br> <a href=\"http://sinnfein.ie\" target=\"_new\">Sinn Fein</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.indigo.ie/sdlp\" target=\"_new\">Social Democratic and Labour Party</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.belfasttelegraph.com/cgi-bin/todaysnews\" target=\"_new\"> Belfast Telegraph</a><br> <a href=\"http://scripts.ireland.com/tardis.plx?main=newspaper/front\" target=\"_new\">Irish Times</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.irishnews.com\" target=\"_new\">Irish News</a> <a href=\"http://www.dup.org.uk\" target=\"_new\">Democratic Unionist Party</a><br> <a href=\"http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/index.html\" target=\"_new\">Cain (Conflict Archive on the Internet)</a></p>",
  "<p>All anyone ever needs to know about what record shops refer to as \"single artist compilations\" is contained in the title. Anything that includes the phrase \"greatest hits\" should mean the 17-20 best-selling singles bar none, not even that embarrassing collaboration with Keith Allen. \"Best of\" is code: it can mean some singles being contractually unavailable, or the exclusion of that Keith Allen collaboration, or that there are not enough proper hits to fill a CD single, let alone 75 minutes. In each case, randomly selected album tracks are used as padding. Anything including \"collector's\" means it is pitched at the bovine sector of an artist's fanbase, with an inevitable coda that while the said artist has been compiled too recently for commercial comfort, something has to be shoved out before the sales curve dips. \"Collector's\", however, should never be confused with \"collection\", which is typically a more comprehensive business. \"Anthology\", the close cousin of \"collection\", usually features a smattering of unlistenable demos and will sprawl its way through several decades. </p> <p>Sadly, record companies do not always tell the whole truth, and this is particularly the case in the seasonal rush to flood the market with single-artist compilations that HMV and Virgin might as well rack up as \"Christmas Presents\". <br> <strong> The Pretenders' Greatest Hits </strong>(Warner Esp, ****) is straightforward enough, with 20 tracks, all the top-40 hits and Chrissie Hynde's extra-curricular adventures with UB40 and Moodswings for ballast. The will-this-do? sleevenotes from Julie Burchill (\"The Pretenders could be clunky, po-faced, pious and some times embarrassing\") at least means Hynde need fear no reviews. </p> <p>Pointedly, <strong>Lenny Kravitz's</strong> 15-track, outrageously titled <strong>Greatest Hits </strong> (Virgin America, **) fails to trouble itself with sleevenotes at all. That he has only had two proper hits is neither here nor there, but the riff to Are You Gonna Go My Way is a great rock moment. A grim future, but hopefully a less silly haircut, beckon. </p> <p><strong>Shirley's Bassey's This Is My Life - The Greatest Hits </strong>(Liberty/EMI, **) cannily places the Propellerheads-helmed History Repeating second in the running order, in an attempt to Tom Jonesify her career; omitting her work with Yello and Chris Rea, however, is missing open goals. Big Spender and Goldfinger just about compensate for Climb Every Mountain, although these 22 tracks are the equivalent of being shouted at for 68 minutes. </p> <p><strong>Cliff Richard's The Whole Story - His Greatest Hits</strong> (EMI, **) spans 1958-99 over 46 tracks. It is the sort of \"whole\" story that includes Mistletoe &amp; Wine but omits Congratulations, although to compile his top-10 hits would take many more than two CDs. No sleevenotes: draw your own conclusions. My, he's looking old these days. </p> <p>Long dropped by Warner Bros,<strong> Ice-T </strong>avoids any potential sleevenote embarrassment by writing the extensive ones to the 17-track <strong>Greatest Hits: The Evidence </strong>(Warner Bros, ****) himself. For reasons that will forever remain unclear, he reviews all his albums. \"No one wants a good white kid understanding and identifying with the rage from the streets,\" he thunders, before including some of his good-white-kid-friendly thrash hobby band, Body Count. His voice, warm yet knowing even when swearing, is a thing of often unheralded beauty. </p> <p><strong>Spandau Ballet's Gold: The Best Of </strong> (EMI, ***) might as well be subtitled We Had an Award-Winning EastEnders Actor on Bass. Despite the already released The Singles Collection and The Best Of, it is a genuine greatest hits: 17 Gary Kemp-penned tracks including all their 10 top-10 entries. The sleevenotes - \"after them the night would never look or sound or be the same again\" - are understandably anonymous. </p> <p><strong>Harpers Bizarre </strong>meant nothing in Britain (merely two sort-of hits, reaching 34 and 33) and little more at home in the US. But they used a succession of fine songwriters (Harry Nilsson, Randy Newman, Van Dyke Parks) and have acquired a certain cachet since they disintegrated in 1970.<strong> Feelin' Groovy: The Best Of </strong> (Warner Archive, ****), accompanied by a defiantly sensible essay, is all you'll ever need. </p> <p><strong>UB40's</strong> splendid <strong>The Very Best Of 1980-2000 </strong>(Virgin, ****) is their fourth compilation but the first to cover their entire oeuvre. Twenty chart entries over one CD rather skimps it for a bizarrely maligned group who have had more than twice that, but it does include this Christmas's second chance to secure one of their two hits with Chrissie Hynde and an opportunity to re-evaluate the fabulous Bring Me Your Cup. </p> <p>Uncomfortably bestriding the worlds of greatest hits and best of are the mixed bags. The fifth best-selling female act ever, <strong>Reba McEntire </strong>sings like an angel. I'll Be (MCA Nashville, **) is a collection of \"great songs by great writers\", notwithstanding the fact that she has barely written a word or note in her life. It comprises nine tracks from her least country album, 1995's Starting Over, three new songs and a few oddities. Very strange. Stick to Greatest Hits Volumes I and II. </p> <p>Alas <strong>Celine Dion </strong>, pregnant at last, has her eye off the ball. Hence <strong>The Collector's Series Vol 1 </strong>(Epic, *). It is packed with out-takes and Spanish versions, but, for shame, has none of her work with Jim Steinman. This is as poor as her often misguided detractors will have you believe. </p> <p><strong>The Mighty Wah!'s</strong> self-destructively titled <strong>The Handy Wah! Whole: Songs From The Repertwah!: The Maverick Years 2000 </strong>(Essential, *****) is the wonderful result of Pete Wylie owning his music at last and highlights his solo and Wah! incarnations over two CDs. Passionate, funny and bold as brass. </p> <p>The Handy Wah! Whole is effectively an anthology. Laurie Anderson's Talk Normal: The Anthology (Warner Archives, ****) clearly is. It stands tall as an example of how helpful compilations can be. Lovingly and intelligently packaged, and as comprehensive as anyone could wish outside her immediate family, its 35 tracks dismantle an unfocused career, separate wheat from chaff and rebuild her as a coherent, endlessly fascinating artist. </p> <p><strong>Van Der Graaf Generator's The Box </strong>(Virgin, ***) has just 34 tracks over four CDs, but 10 of them wheeze on for over 10 minutes. Deep-voiced, heartfelt, intellectual and gloomy, they avoided the mainstream from their formation in 1968 to their demise in 1978, and nothing will change now. No matter; those who know will rejoice in several newly available live and BBC session tracks. A labour of love for all compilers and purchasers. </p> <p>Finally,<strong> Freddie Mercury's</strong> doorstep-sized <strong>The SOLO Collection </strong>(Parlophone, **) takes an artist who produced two solo albums and one with diva Montserrat Caballe and manages to unleash a 10-CD box, plus two DVDs and a book, all for around \u00a3135. Some tracks among the three \"rarities\" CDs \"contain a certain amount of headphones leakage\", which means they sound as if recorded in a sewer; the \"instrumentals\" disc, meanwhile, is unlistenable. The interview disc is a brief hoot, the book does not take a critical approach and the whole lavish package is as excessive and preposterous as the man himself. </p> <p>There will be literally dozens more single artist compilations released in time for Christmas. Just why do the record companies cannibalise their artists so? \"We're not doing any,\" admitted one major label executive, \"because we've been genuinely successful this year. If it goes pear-shaped in 2001, we'll release six to 10, or as many as it takes, to convince the shareholders and the American head office that we've done well again.\" </p> <p>And you thought it was just about the music.</p>",
  "The set decorator Emile Kuri, who has died aged 93, nominally won two Oscars - for his splendid work on The Heiress (1949) and 20,000 Leagues Under The Sea (1954) - and, in all, his name was put up for eight. But he never actually received the famous gold statuette, because, prior to 1955, set decorators were only given plaques. <p>Unlike the production designer or art director, who is in charge of a film's overall design, the set decorator is responsible, according to the Complete Film Dictionary, \"for the furnishings, ornamentations and artwork, from the smallest to the largest items that make the setting real and immediate. He or she must have a knowledge of the technical aspects of film-making, especially how a set and its properties will photograph. The set director works with both stunt and special-effects personnel to create for them furnishings and properties that will satisfy their needs.\" </p> <p>This exactly describes Kuri's work in general, and on 20,000 Leagues Under The Sea in particular. With Peter Ellenshaw, the British-born exponent of the matte (a mask used to blank out part of an image in order to superimpose another), he created the Nautilus, Captain Nemo's magnificent futuristic submarine, equipping the claustrophobic interior with sumptuous furnishings in red velvet and gleaming brass rococo decorations, and a magnificent pipe organ. </p> <p>As most of the action of William Wyler's The Heiress takes place in a suffocating Washington Square mansion, Kuri's set decoration assumed primary importance. \"I believe that the emotions and conflicts between two people in a drawing-room can be as exciting as a battle,\" Wyler claimed - and, in this instance, Kuri provided him with the perfect background for the drama between his stars, Olivia de Havilland and Montgomery Clift. </p> <p>Kuri was born to Lebanese parents in Cuernavaca, Mexico. He left school at the age of 12 when his family moved to Los Angeles. A few years later, while working in a Hollywood furniture store, he met the wife of producer Hal Roach, who was so impressed by his advice and taste that she asked him to furnish the Roach mansion. </p> <p>One of Kuri's first film jobs was as assistant decorator on Roach's production of the ghost comedy, Topper (1937). In the same year, he became principal set decorator on the Hopalong Cassidy western series. His big break came with Alfred Hitchcock on Spellbound (1945) and Rope (1948). The action of the latter is confined to the apartment of two young murderers, who serve dinner on a large chest - chosen by Kuri - in which their victim is concealed. \"The most difficult thing,\" Kuri said, \"is to make a set not look like a set, but like a home, as if the people just walked in.\" </p> <p>For George Stevens's A Place In The Sun (1951), Kuri created the contrasting environments in which factory worker Shelley Winters and society girl Elizabeth Taylor live. In fact, he was so effective in conveying character through the sets - for instance, by giving a tawdry look to Winters' bedroom - that she complained that it made her character look like a tramp, and wanted something better. Also for Stevens, Kuri helped to create the atmosphere of the small homestead in Shane (1953) for gunslinger Alan Ladd. </p> <p>In 1954, Kuri joined the Walt Disney Studios, where he remained for the rest of his career. Here, he decorated the sets of 20,000 Leagues Under The Sea, The Absent-Minded Professor (1960), The Parent Trap (1961) and Mary Poppins (1964). He was also among the leading \"imagineers\" of Disneyland, super- vising the decor on such attractions as the sailing ship, Columbia, and the New Orleans Plaza Inn. </p> <p>Kuri shared Walt Disney's devotion to detail, and considered Disneyland his most challenging project because, unlike a movie set, the exhibits were to be permanent. Thousands of visitors to Disneyland and Walt Disney World in Florida, for which he was consultant, are daily exposed to Kuri's work. </p> <p>He is survived by two sons and a daughter. </p> <p><b>Emile Kuri, set decorator, born 1907; died October 10 2000 </b></p>",
  "<p>StepStone.com, the online recruitment firm, yesterday admitted it had lost 43.2m euros (\u00a330m) in three months but insisted the foundations were in place to make a profit by 2002. </p> <p>Giles Clarke, chief executive of the Norwegian company, blamed the losses on the costs of a rapid expansion that has seen the site introduced to Austria, Finland, the Netherlands, Portugal and Spain. </p> <p>But he said the company's strong cash position,159m euros at the end of September, and profits generated from the new European operations would help pull it out of the red. </p> <p>\"We made it very clear that this would be the quarter where investment would peak,\" Mr Clarke said. \"As the markets grow in all the countries we see tremendous opportunity for us and are full of optimism about the future.\" </p> <p>Mr Clarke said there were no plans to expand into more countries \"in the near future\". </p> <p>StepStone, which believes people are now more willing to travel for new jobs, said Germany ranked as its second biggest market, behind Britain. </p> <p>Last month it announced the purchase of 75% of Job-Today, one of Germany's leading online recruitment companies, and intends to acquire the balance over the coming months. </p> <p>\"It's becoming more and more an international business and people are doing deals across a number of countries,\" Mr Clarke said. \"There's a great mobility across the EU and people are more linguistically gifted than they used to be.

  "<b> Stuart Shields writes:</b> During the Prague Spring of 1968, Eduard Goldst\u00fccker (Obituary, October 25) became an MP in the Czech parliament. After the Russians moved in, he took part in a special congress of the Communist party, held secretly in a factory under the noses of the invaders. He was elected to the central committee of what was, in effect, an undercover party. <p>In later years, he took a somewhat vain pleasure in showing his friends the verbatim transcript of a demand made by the Soviet politburo to Alexander Dubcek and his fellow ministers, who had been taken to Moscow under duress, that he should be removed from any position he held. </p> <p>After Goldst\u00fccker came to England in 1968 - as a refugee for the second time in his life - he would bravely return to Prague for sessions of the parliament, at least until the risk of arrest became too great. </p> <p>In his last years, he conducted a campaign to get the Prague city authorities to rename the site of Kafka's place of birth in memory of the writer. Last June, he succeeded; Kafka Square is a memento to his persistence. </p> <p>A final touch. When, during the war, Eduard and his wife, Marta, moved from Oxford, and Eduard became a civil servant in the Beres government in exile, they shared a house in Walton-on-Thames with another Czech family, whose little girl was called Madeleine - now the US secretary of state, Madeleine Albright.</p>",
  "Wet leaves were blamed for a train derailment yesterday which provoked further fears about the safety of the rail network. <p>Four carriages carrying 150 to 200 passengers on the 8.21am South West trains service from Weybridge in Surrey to Staines went through a red light and left the track 100 yards from Virginia Water station, narrowly missing a commuter train travelling to Waterloo from Reading. </p> <p>The incident occurred on the same stretch of track where a train travelling at 60mph collided last week with a bus stranded on a level crossing at Pooley Green near Egham, Surrey. </p> <p>The train, which was travelling at 40mph, should have stopped at a red light outside Virginia Water station but overshot to a set of points at a junction which had been set for the train bound for Waterloo. </p> <p>As the train swerved out of control, signals were changed from green to red to prevent other trains crossing its path. </p> <p>No one was seriously injured but two passengers were treated for shock in hospital. </p> <p>Railtrack said last night that early investigations suggest the incident was caused by leaves on the line. </p> <p>Michael Holden, Railtrack's southern zone director, said that leaves on the track were the equivalent of black ice on the roads. </p> <p>\"The prompt action of the driver and the signalman ensured there was no danger to other trains or passengers,\" he said. </p> <p>Passenger Michael Groves, 41, from Weybridge, Surrey, vowed never to use the railways again. \"One moment it was like any other morning, the next there was terror. The train buckled and the carriage started to tilt over. People were screaming. </p> <p>\"Some people started to get off but I urged them not to. They could have electrocuted themselves on the rails. Instead we waited for the fire brigade who were very quick and helped us off. </p> <p>\"Everyone was in shock. This was the most terrifying experience of my life.

  "A British theatre company teaching children from warring ethnic groups in Indonesia how to build friendships through drama cancelled its programme yesterday after at least three people were killed in rioting in West Kalimantan. <p>The David Glass Ensemble, from London, had been working with 43 children from the indigenous Malay and Dayak groups and migrant Madurese on a British Council project in Pontianak in West Kalimantan, the Indonesian half of Borneo. </p> <p>Last night its five members and their two British Council coordinators were preparing to leave the strife-torn city for the capital, Jakarta, as buildings continued to blaze near their hotel and gangs rampaged on the streets. </p> <p>\"There is no way we can continue working here,\" Jim Hollington of the British Council said. \"Not only is the safety and security of the team at risk, but the project is no longer viable, because the children's parents will not let them take part in the workshops and performances.\" </p> <p>Jane Arnfield, the company's project leader, said the violence had taken them all by surprise. \"We have been here since last week and no one had any inkling that something like this might happen.\" </p> <p>Most of the children they were teaching were victims of violence between the Madurese and local tribes, particularly the Malays and Dayaks. </p> <p>Hundreds died in a major outbreak in the province last year, and 4,000 Madurese refugees from the unrest are still living in squalid camps in Pontianak, which lies on the equator, 470 miles north-east of Jakarta. </p> <p>The latest trouble began with a minor traffic accident on Wednesday morning. Violence quickly flared after a Madurese bus driver hit a Malay motorcyclist, even though no one was seriously injured. </p> <p>Police officers, said by witnesses to be extremely trigger happy, were unable to stop gangs of Malay youths rampaging through the city. </p> <p>A Madurese man was hacked to death after a mob grabbed him from the officers who had arrested him.</p>",
  "A pack of swans flew overhead as I walked on Longhorsley moor last week. I knew they were whooper swans by the chanting - a soft, melancholy, bugling note, who-who-who, from which their name is derived. Mute swans are largely silent apart from an occasional hiss - the whooper really \"whoops\". The whooper carries his head upright and has a bright yellow beak with a black tip to it, the mute's neck carriage is more curvaceous and the beak is orange, backed by a dark nasal knob. Mutes are largely residential in habit whilst whooper swans are migrants, nesting in Iceland and the Arctic Circle. <p>Many whoopers now come to our northern counties in the autumn before moving further south, others stay all winter, and these appear to be on the increase on suitable lakes, pitfalls and around Lindisfarne, our Holy Island. Perhaps this is due to recent mild winters. A third swan to visit our shores is the Bewick. The neck carriage and colour of the beak are similar to the whooper but the bird is half the size. Swans were once highly regarded as table birds, especially at Christmas. </p> <p>Swans are popular birds with other surface-feeding ducks, because in midwinter they are efficient ice-breakers. Due to their bulk and weight they can often prevent the water freezing, thus cutting off the food supply. </p> <p>During one fierce winter freeze-up, a pair of whoopers stayed on a local lake all winter and it was fascinating to watch them. Ice encroached from all sides to leave a little pool of open water which became crowded with aquatic birds, and by sheer persistence the pair of whoopers kept the water from icing over completely. </p>",
  "<p>There's little more irritating for the hardened TV viewer than a time differential - or temporal distortion as they might say in Star Trek - between the real world of one's living room and the telly world. It's a sad reminder that most of what transpires on TV is made up, and that, no, you couldn't visit The Bayside Diner in Summer Bay if you went to Australia - because it isn't real. It's irksome enough that it's Christmas in ER when it's August here, but at least it always looks Christmassy in Chicago. That it's Christmas here and nearly Easter in Neighbours and Christmas in Neighbours when it's June here - and Christmas at a different time altogether in Home and Away - is really frustrating. In the future, when technological advances in TV mean you can watch anything that's ever been on at any time, it will be possible to watch Christmas special after Christmas special whenever you fancy. Not only will this advance the postmodernist theory about the end of history, it will cheer Wizzard, who wished it could be Christmas every day. </p> <p>They don't have Christmas in space, at least not on Star Trek: Voyager. There, they have Prixin instead, which sounds rude but isn't. </p> <p>All of which leads, like roads to Rome, to <strong> Buffy The Vampire Slayer</strong> (BBC2). Through no sound judgement on the part of BBC schedulers who have punted Buffy around like a beachball, it reached a Halloween episode just as the real world reaches Halloween. Spooky, but in a good way. Not one of the series' best episodes, its message was too obvious - the only thing to fear is fear itself (that, and Peter Stringfellow) - and its climax a bit of an anti-climax (again, like Peter Stringfellow). There were nice moments, however, especially a forlorn Buffy musing on the life of a pumpkin. \"You grow up in the sun, entwined with others but then someone comes along, cuts you open and scoops out your guts.\" Bless. </p> <p>And bless Kay Mellor too for <strong> Fat Friends</strong> (ITV) and its wonderful James Bond titles pastiche with cakes instead of guns. In the world of Julia Fleshman's slimmers, guts and growing up in the sun were also to the fore with Poor Lauren (Jewish Judy Mallett) having an epiphany (and it wasn't even January 6) about her unhappy life since she started dieting, Kelly failing to lose weight with only four weeks to go before her wedding, and Julia's hair looking more like a sedated guinea pig with each passing week. Its overstated moral notwithstanding (\"I blame the magazines\"), it's witty, moving and sparkly, much like Lauren in her tooth-fairy costume. </p> <p> <strong> Horizon: The Lost World </strong> (BBC2) started melodramatically. \"Earth has one secret left,\" it proclaimed. Really? Just one? Not a couple? Not 'What's in the middle of the Amazon?', 'What's at the very bottom of the ocean?' and 'Where do broken hearts go?' And then the one Horizon picked to examine? Talk about building your part up. </p> <p>Anyway, this small over-egging aside, the secret Horizon had picked was a good 'un - Lake Vostok buried under four kilometres of ice in the middle of Antarctica. It could be 30 million years old and hold the secrets of the origin of life on earth. Whoooo. The best kind of science'n' nature documentary, Horizon charted the existence of Vostok in men and women's minds from the depths of the Cold War when the Russians were boring holes in the ice above it, eating pounds of butter to keep warm (more effective than vodka, apparently) and weren't even convinced it existed, through to the British airborne radar team who confirmed its existence in the 1970s (\"It's half the size of Wales!\") to the present day and Nasa's involvement in the project. </p> <p>While the story of the lake is in itself a gripping yarn, the scientists involved in the programme seemed a bit thick. Speculating about the fate of the life with which Vostok once teemed, they took an awful long time to get to the idea that, in the dark and under the enormous pressure, all the plants and animals died, leaving only teeny tiny microbes. And wondering what see-through insects in a Romanian cave fed off, no one suggested unwitting scientists. </p> <p>But the most icky bit of Horizon was learning that microbes were the magicians of survival. Imagine a whole lake swarming with miniature Paul Daniels (well, more miniature than usual). Maybe we should leave Vostok well alone.</p>",
  "\u0095 <b>In last week's New Statesman,</b> immigration minister Barbara Roche had another crack at explaining why she is the refugees best friend. Bless her, she will therefore be particularly keen to help Mrs H, a refugee known to the Leytonstone Citizens Advice Bureau who lives on income support. <p>When her mother died here recently, she applied to the DSS for a funeral payment, but was refused under the \"immediate family member test\" banning payments to anyone with a close family member not on benefit. The intention is to get salaried people to pay, but Mrs H's two sisters, both unemployed asylum seekers, are not on benefits only because they receive degrading local authority vouchers instead of cash. Mrs H had to borrow money and is now in debt. Caring Barbara will want to re-imburse her and to correct this cretinous anomaly at once, and we look forward to having good news early next week. </p> <p>\u0095 <b>Meanwhile, good to see Barbara's colleague Alan Milburn,</b> the health secretary, coping so smoothly with the BSE report press conference. What a busy week it's been, what with the spotlight on domestic violence, at least as arduous a problem for the health service as for the police and social services. </p> <p>\u0095 <b>News in the Sun</b> that the Queen owns and adores a Bigmouth Billy Bass obliges us to boast of being the first to identify the constitutional importance of the crooning rubber fish: a report into Mr Tony's mirthful fascination appeared on July 26. Billy, it seems, is the new \"You Don't Have to Be Mad to Work Here ...\" sticker - a ready-made sense of humour for people with none of their own. Doubts have been raised about whether it was in fact the Queen, using a pseudonym, who won her Billy Bass in the Diary's Gerald Kaufman competition. If so, Her Majesty ought to be aware that particular gift was a freebie from Harrods. </p> <p>\u0095 <b>After another triumphant day for our fact checkers,</b> two things need clearing up. The genius who gifted the mayoral nomination to Frank Dobson by arranging for the South London Co-op not to ballot members, and is now standing for deputy leader of the London Labour party, is Kathryn Smith, not Catherine Smith. Apologies to the real Catherine for that sloppiness. And Gareth Roberts was the first of many to tell us that Professor Stanley Unwin certainly did appear in a Carry On, as a property developer in Carry On Regardless. </p> <p>\u0095 <b>Speaking of which,</b> 73 emails, letters and faxes with casting suggestions have now arrived - a miraculous reaction for a column very few read, and of which fewer take a blind bit of notice. My favourite so far is Charles Hawtrey for Cherie. As for the person who nominated Desert Orchid for a certain woman minister, this is the Guardian and we don't tolerate gratuitous equism. </p> <p>\u0095 <b>Thanks to Alastair Campbell's crusade </b>against the press's obsession with trivia, a sea-change has taken place in political journalism. Under the entry for February 19 1992 in his new memoirs, Paddy Ashdown writes of a day just long enough after his affair had broken for interest to have dimmed. \"Only one question on the Tricia Howard affair,\" recalls Old Pants of a press conference, \"from Alastair Campbell of the Daily Mirror. He asked me a rather rude question (I can't remember what), to which I answered 'No' and moved on.\" </p> <p>\u0095 An intriguing sign has been spotted on the reverse of \"Do not disturb\" in Liverpool's Moat House hotel. \"Please display outside your room,\" it counsels, \"if you require assistance in the unlikely event of a fire.\" And quite right. If you can't be bothered to put out the sign, the moment you smell smoke you deserve to fry. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:diary@theguardian.com\">diary@theguardian.com</a> </p>"
