  "<p> Stuttgart State Opera's modern staging of Handel's Alcina is visually striking, vocally outstanding and dramatically intoxicating. The sorceress Alcina's realm is a voluptuously ornate but dilapidated salon, in whose centre is an enormous gilded frame that acts as both mirror and magic portal. </p> <p>Right from Alcina's entrance, sex is in the air. Catherine Naglestad sings her first aria in the arms of her beloved, Alice Coote's Ruggiero, in a scene of feverish, highly charged eroticism. The other characters can only watch, half bewitched, half shocked by Alcina's brazen sensuality. The relationship between her and Ruggiero is critical to the opera's drama, and in Naglestad and Coote this production has a magnificently matched pairing. Alcina is slowly reduced to the status of a mere mortal by her love for Ruggiero, as he rejects her in favour of Bradamante, his wife-to-be in the outside world. </p> <p>Naglestad gives a vivid portrayal of Alcina's gradual emotional collapse in her string of violently contrasting arias in the second part. She lurches with raw terror from sorrowful defeat - in an ice-cold monody, supported by a solo violin - to impassioned revenge, as she comes to know the torments of human love. Coote's singing of Ruggiero's dissolution as the first part progresses is no less psychologically penetrating. Caught between duty and passion, Ruggiero loses confidence in all his feelings. Everywhere seems to be deception and duplicity. </p> <p>The other characters also spend the opera trying to escape from the power of their passions in Alcina's realm. Rolf Romei's Oronte becomes a cross-dressing temptress in his first-act aria; Catriona Smith's Morgana finds herself in love with the disguised Bradamante. But to regain their liberty and humanity, the other characters degenerate into precisely the bestiality of which they accuse Alcina, and murder her. The final chorus in this production reverses the emotional polarities of the whole opera: singing about their new-won freedom, the humans fight, flirt and fornicate. It is only Alcina who finds her humanity and escapes from illusion to truth. </p> <p>Jossi Wieler and Sergio Morabito's direction is unflinching in its exploration of the complex core of Handel's drama. Only Alan Hacker's conducting and the energetic but unforgiving playing of the Stuttgart State Orchestra are at odds with the incisiveness of the rest of the production. </p> <p>\u0095 Till tomorrow.

  "<p> A city under siege, caught up in civil war isn't the most promising context for a surreal treat, but in the smart hands of the Rejects Revenge Theatre Company this scenario becomes a richly comic, darkly bizarre prospect. Maniacally told, with more than a nod to postmodern playfulness, this is like Calvino on speed; Umberto Eco meets Fawlty Towers after one too many ice lollies. </p> <p>The story - an attempt at liberation across a bridge by bicycle - is told in flashback, with plenty of reminders that we are being told a tale: \"I'm not here of course\", \"they were getting ahead of themselves\". Add in funny faces, silly songs, an accordion, a touch of classy farce (a man sent to slaughter an elephant to feed hungry citizens can't do it and comes back with two flamingo legs instead), a love story and some big themes connected to the cruelty of war, and you get something almost very marvellous. </p> <p>Almost, because despite the crazy joy of the show and the three performances, it's all a little too self-referential. We might find the productions's fizzing energy intoxicating, but the smartness gets in the way of anything more than a rather detached, cold-hearted pleasure. </p> <p> Till August 28.

  "<p>Ipswich Town and Wimbledon were embroiled in a row over the future of Hermann Hreidarsson last night, with Ipswich claiming to have bought the defender for a club-record \u00a34m and Wimbledon insisting they had not even agreed a fee for the sale. The south London club, meanwhile, are lining up Everton's Richard Dunne as a possible replacement. </p> <p>Ipswich announced yesterday that the 26-year-old Iceland centre-half would join at the end of the week subject to a medical. </p> <p>The Premiership club said their chairman David Sheepshanks and Wimbledon's chief executive David Barnard had agreed a fee on Saturday by telephone and that personal terms had been settled with the player on Sunday before he flew to Iceland for tomorrow's friendly against Sweden. </p> <p>\"We are delighted that we have got a proven international player to boost our defence,\" said Sheepshanks, who negotiated Hreidarsson's contract along with the Ipswich manager George Burley. </p> <p>Within hours, though, Barnard accused Ipswich of jumping the gun. \"We have not yet accepted the offer they have made,\" he insisted. \"They made an original bid which we rejected as unsatisfactory. They have since made a second offer, which we are now considering. </p> <p>\"Nothing can be done until Hermann returns [on Thursday] and I can tell you from experience that a week in football is a very long time indeed; anything can happen.\" </p> <p>Despite Barnard's retort, Ipswich said they expected Hreidarsson to sign before their opening game at Tottenham on Saturday. </p> <p>Meanwhile, the Everton manager Walter Smith yesterday told Wimbledon that \u00a32.5m would secure Dunne's services. The centre-back is expected to travel to London today to discuss personal terms. </p> <p>Smith will use his windfall to fund his bid for the Newcastle United striker Duncan Ferguson, who is poised to return to Everton less than two years after departing for Tyneside in an \u00a38m deal. The former Scotland international is arguing with Newcastle over loyalty bonuses but is expected to undergo a medical today. </p> <p>Everton have agreed an initial \u00a33.75m fee plus an additional \u00a31m when - or if - he features in 60 senior games. </p> <p>Charlton have snapped up the Iran international Karim Bagheri from the Iranian club Piroozi for \u00a3400,000, potentially rising to \u00a31.1m. As an attacking midfielder the 26-year-old scored 20 goals in qualifying for France 98, but can also operate as a sweeper. </p> <p>Bradford City hope to complete the \u00a31.5m signing of the Blackburn striker Ashley Ward in time for their opener at Liverpool on Saturday. </p> <p>The Cardiff City striker Dai Thomas has been fined the maximum two weeks' wages for his part in the Euro 2000 riots. The 24-year-old was caught on camera as hundreds of supporters ran riot in Brussels before an England game. </p> <p>\"This is as near as we have come to letting a player go for non-playing matters,\" said Cardiff's chairman Steve Borley. \"Clearly, his full apology went a long way towards our decisions.\" </p> <p>Barcelona will take their summer spending to \u00a348.5m today when the Spain striker Alfonso completes an \u00a38m move from Real Betis.</p>",
  "<p>Alan Curry of the British Council makes his welcoming speech in Spanish, its flow slightly disrupted by a name that seems as unlikely in this context as a miner's helmet under a sombrero. Heaven knows what the great and the good of Mexico City make of the intrusion of \"Barnsley\" into their native tongue, and its coupling with another, slightly more familiar intruder, \"BBC Radio 4\". </p> <p>Those of us visiting from the UK know that the link is forged by the deep, flat-vowelled voice waiting its turn to address the Mexicans in its own native tongue: northern English. The poet Ian McMillan is in town. This is his second visit to Mexico in three years. There is more to McMillan, 44, than his capacity to churn out instant rhymes as the bard of Barnsley FC and Northern Spirit Railways. Radio 4 recognised this some years ago. The British Council has recognised it, too. </p> <p>\"We could bring out endless Turner exhibitions and string quartets to promote British culture,\" Curry tells me. \"But we like to balance that with a contemporary view of Britain.\" This is a view of Britain as a collection of regions with different accents and customs; Britain as a multicultural country with writers and artists who have roots in other parts of the globe. </p> <p>What's happening in Mexico City tonight is happening in other ways in other capitals around the world as the British Council continues its struggle to change outdated perceptions of Britain's arts scene. It is a struggle that the government evidently feels to be worthwhile, judging by the chancellor's recent gift of a 9.1% increase in budget over the next three years - the biggest rise in a decade. </p> <p>\"We work on two levels,\" says Baroness Helena Kennedy QC, who became chair of the council two years ago. \"Yes, we still send out the RSC and the National and various top orchestras. But it's important that that's not all. We have to present more cutting-edge work to give a flavour of the zeitgeist in our country now. This is a process that began a long time before I came here.\" And it will have to go on a lot longer if it is to make any telling progress. The UK may have 16% of what is called \"the world market in creative industry products\", but when the council recently commissioned Mori to carry out a worldwide survey on its behalf, our claim to be a centre of artistic creativity and design excellence took rather a knock. Even among apparently informed young people, the best known British artist abroad is Sir Elton John. </p> <p>When I remind Kennedy about the survey she says: \"Perception is always slightly behind reality. If you asked me about contemporary German writing, I'd probably home in on G\u00fcnter Grass. The fact is that British arts and creativity are a strength. It's one of the areas where we have a great story to tell.\" </p> <p>Among those telling it are writers such as Caryl Phillips and the poet Benjamin Zephaniah, with their roots in the Caribbean. \"In certain parts of the world, they've only just realised that there are black British writers and artists,\" says Peter Elborn, the acting director of arts, who is conscious that changing perceptions can be a delicate process. \"You have to respond to what makes sense in a particular country - push back the boundaries a bit, but not enough to provoke a backlash. When I was working in Pakistan, we brought in Nahid Siddiqui's contemporary dance group from Birmingham and it was the first time in more than 20 years that a group of visiting women dancers had performed on stage. The district police commissioner in Rawlpindi tried to get me to cancel it in case there was a riot. It was a risk I was prepared to take and it all passed off peacefully.\" </p> <p>McMillan reading his work in Mexico City represents a different kind of risk. \"When I was here three years ago, it was the only time I ever got nervous before a gig,\" he says. \"I knew I was going to have to read my poems to a Mexican university audience and I suddenly thought: 'None of this is any good. It's too English, too Yorkshire.' Yet I got a standing ovation.\" </p> <p>There won't be a standing ovation tonight, because it's not that kind of gig. Instead of being on stage in front of a seated audience, McMillan is leading them along what he calls \"the corridor of art\". Pictures line the walls. They are drenched in colour, sometimes tempered by dark and brooding backgrounds. Flowers of shocking pink seem poised to burst out of the canvas. Bright blood trickles down the human face of a bull with startling blue eyes. Skulls and masks, so much a part of Mexican culture, stare from the canvas with haunting expressions. </p> <p>They are the work not of a Mexican, but of another son of Barnsley. David Beresford, 56, is a graduate of the Royal College of Art. In 1997, he made a documentary, Ian McMillan in Mexico, and now he has been commissioned by Yorkshire Television to produce a follow-up series. The experience three years ago had a profound effect on both men. McMillan's already fevered imagination was fired even further, while Mexico gave Beresford the inspiration to take up serious painting again. </p> <p>Towards the end of their trip, McMillan and Beresford set each other three Mexican subjects to interpret in their own way. These six ideas form the basis of tonight's gig-cum-exhibition. And McMillan is our guide, moving from painting to painting with his jaunty stage walk, like a prop forward barging his way to the rugby-club bar. </p> <p>On he goes, pausing to read his poems by pictures of the screaming faces of The Skinned Man, flayed alive as a sacrifice by Aztec priests, and a skull from The Day of the Dead. McMillan's final poem is called Descending into Chihuahua, Descending into Barnsley. The Chihuahua part of this equation, he tells us, catches the moment when he finally lost his fear of flying and learned to enjoy airplanes. This is all the more remarkable since one of Beresford's paintings on the same subject shows the runway apparently bursting into flames. </p> <p>Once again I find myself pondering how a Mexican audience is grappling with the notion of Barnsley bus station and Gala bingo. But I needn't have worried. The day after his return from Mexcico City, this cultural envoy will travel into alien territory, a place where the British Council has no office: McMillan is crossing the Pennines for a gig in Wigan.</p>",
  "<p><strong> Sunday, January 21 1999</strong> </p> <p> Two one-night stands later - I swear they weren't intentionally one-night stands so far as I was concerned - I was USED!! Anyway, while I'm feeling bitter, here's a list of the things Georgia has so far copied from me!! CREAM rotary phone, PANASONIC walkman, her new love of candles, religious imagery, ROBOCOP (!!) Rocky Horror, Elvis and his tacky ways. Priscilla, CULTURE CLUB!! (I got a photo, signed to no-one, sent to me recently), colours, my favourites green, orange and blue, cosmetics, Cosmetics To Go, silver jewellery. She even wanted some bike boots (I successfully got some in Camden). NO SHAME. That's all I can remember for now. I will eventually write about London and explain the Savoy/Fortnum receipts opposite. So much has happened and psychotherapy is a total mind FUCK!! I'm psychotic!! (and suicidal). </p> <p> This entry was the last ever in Simon Hervey's diary. He died, sitting up in bed in his small flat in Newcastle, on March 8 last year. He had a book on his lap, and a crisp packet by his side; there were still crisps in his mouth. At the inquest six months later, the coroner recorded an open verdict. \"Open in the sense that one simply does not know what happened,\" he said. </p> <p>Simon was just 28. For 14 of those 28 years, he was prescribed a cocktail of drugs by a variety of doctors. The first prescription for Valium was because he was unhappy about being bullied at school and because he was concerned about his acne. Between then and his death he was put on uppers, downers, more benzodiazepines (the drug group to which Valium belongs), Prozac, Heminevrin, normally given under hospital conditions to alcoholics, and finally Epilim, an anti-epileptic. </p> <p> <strong> The year summed up: 1992.</strong> </p> <p> \"In 1991, September 18, my Grandma C died and I found out by accident on Jan 10, '92 from a phone call to Grandad. Thanks Mum, I never knew her, thanks to you... I've now been sick with depression for four years and it's going to come to a head. Valium is not enough, nor is librium. I've had every antidepressant going and none of them work.\" </p> <p> Simon died alone. The evening before, he had rung his father Adrian Hervey, 58, who works at an all-night garage, and asked him to drop by with some chocolate on his way home. Adrian recalls seeing Simon with the book and crisp packet. \"I chatted to him for a while and then realised something had happened. I called an ambulance but I knew he was dead,\" he says. </p> <p>Simon was flamboyantly gay; he was clever and artistic. In his Newcastle flat, he dreamed of fame and fortune. In his diary, he has left a record of those dreams and of his descent into depression, and into drug-induced confusion; his battle with alcohol and his longing to leave the city. The diaries, from 1990 until that final entry nine years later, are brutal, yet often written with warmth, wit and lucidity. And on virtually every page is a cry for help. I never knew him but I feel that I did; for anyone who has read his diaries, there is an enormous sense of loss. </p> <p>Adrian Hervey's wife left when Simon was eight, leaving Adrian to bring up his son. Now he is alone - bewildered, grieving and proud. Pictures of Simon cover the walls in his high-rise flat in the centre of Newcastle: Simon as Boy George, made-up eyes and high cheekbones; Simon outside the Pompidou Centre in Paris, looking gleefully wicked in one picture and as innocent as a choir boy in another. Simon was a chameleon and he was deeply, deeply unhappy. </p> <p>I met Adrian Hervey six months after Simon died, while reporting on the NHS complaints system for Channel 4 News. I was looking at what kind of redress people have when something has gone wrong. In Hervey's case he wanted to know why Simon had been prescribed this cocktail of drugs for so long. And why he had been given repeat prescriptions of drugs such as Valium which is supposed to be prescribed only in the short term, with the patient seen regularly by the doctor. </p> <p>Adrian was beginning to contemplate the complaints process. Should he demand to see Simon's notes from the hospital and the GP? Should he sue? Like all parents whose children die before they do, he needed some answers because he felt the system had failed his son. </p> <p>\"My son died unnecessarily,\" Adrian says. \"There was a crass lack of care. In any other country in the world he would have been put in hospital and got off those drugs.\" According to Adrian, Simon had begun to fall over, crash into furniture and black out shortly before he died. The coroner noted the bruising on his body and acknowledged Adrian's evidence that his son had begun to lose his coordination. </p> <p>Peter Cooper, the pathologist who gave evidence at the inquest, said that there were benzodiazepines, Heminevrin and co-proxomol in his blood as well as of Epilim, all at a therapeutic dosage level. There were no empty pill bottles or packets in his flat to indicate this might have been suicide. </p> <p>\"He was looking for help all the time, desperately,\" says Adrian. \"The effect of the benzodiazepine is to make the person dependent. He screamed to be off them. He tried to get help from doctors but, every time, he would come back with another drug. He lost his self-esteem, his self- confidence.\" </p> <p>Simon tried to kill himself three or four times during the 14 years that he was ill. Adrian believes that each incident was a cry for help. \"He knew that if he got to hospital he would get hands-on care,\" he says. </p> <p> <strong> November 2 1993</strong> </p> <p> \"I can't think of any more reasons to live, I disgust myself. I mistrust others and make life difficult for my father... I will never have what I want - I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT I WANT. I'm thick, my grammar is awful and I'm just plain tired of being ashamed of myself. I'm fat, ugly, spotty and obnoxious. My father can't even think of a decent reply when I tell him I'm dying!!\" </p> <p> <strong> November 5 1993</strong> </p> <p> \"I know a lot of dead people, and one of them is me. \" </p> <p> <strong> November 6 1993</strong> </p> <p> Well, one bottle of Smirnoff and a squillion diazepam later and I'm still here - unfortunately.\" </p> <p> <strong> November 14 1993</strong> </p> <p> \"This week I took all the anti-depressants I had - and lived!! Took my reserve of Valium - and ditto! I don't think alcohol and drugs can kill me. Dad called the doctor. I feel like shit.\" </p> <p> <strong> March 8 1994</strong> </p> <p> \"Invest my sexual energy. IN WHOM? That's what I want to know!! ... My shrink told me this bizarre piece of nonsense this afternoon... I think my craziness is beyond help and that I will inevitably end my own life.\" </p> <p> <strong> November 19 1995</strong> </p> <p> \"I'm so frightened of living, I hide in bed all day... And yet I'm so preoccupied with the thought that it may improve of its own accord, of course, that I haven't the guts to end the farce... My head aches. I feel 100 years old, I'm only twenty frigging five.\" </p> <p> There is no diary for 1998. It is as if life had become so unbearable he could not longer stand to record it. But in 1999 he appeared to rally. On the front page of his diary he has stuck a card, saying: \"New Year Same Shit.\" But on the next page is a map of the London Underground, in preparation for a visit to the capital, and pictures of orchids. He made that trip, between January 29 and February 1. There is a picture of the hotel he stayed in and, finally, on the last entry but one, a receipt from the American Bar at the Savoy Hotel, for a packet of Malboro Light cigarettes and, from Fortnum and Mason, for one Welsh rarebit and a glass of Guinness. We do not know how the visit went, despite his promise to write about it. </p> <p>They played Boy George's Church of the Poison Mind at Simon's funeral. He had made a tape in case one of his suicide attempts worked. Is that what finally happened? </p> <p>Adrian is still trying to find out whether the drugs his son was prescribed could, in combination, have killed him. He has sent part of his research to his local MP, Jim Cousins, and the health secretary, Alan Milburn. A copy has gone to North Tyneside health authority, which has said it will investigate. </p> <p>\u0095 Victoria Macdonald is social affairs correspondent for Channel 4 News.</p>",
  "The body of British backpacker Kirsty Jones was on the way back to Britain today, as Thai police announced they were confident of identifying her killer. <p>The painted wooden coffin containing the 23-year-old's body was collected by a British embassy official from the northern Thai hill resort of Chiang Mai this morning. It will be driven to Bangkok and put on a flight to the UK tomorrow. </p> <p>As the investigation into her death continues, Thai police have said they know who her killer is and are waiting for DNA testing to confirm their suspicions. </p> <p>The body of Miss Jones, from Tredomen in south Wales, was found in her hostel room at the Aree guest house last Thursday. She was lying half-naked and face down on her bed with her sarong wrapped around her neck. </p> <p>An autopsy showed her neck was bruised where it had been squeezed with a piece of cloth until she could not breathe. </p> <p>Police have taken samples and blood from eight suspects - six tourists and two locals - but the results of blood-group testing failed to narrow down the list of suspects. However police were certain DNA tests would identify the killer. </p> <p>Police have also revealed that her body was discovered five hours earlier than previously thought. A maid who said she had found Kirsty's body at 4pm on Thursday has now admitted she was \"leaned upon\" by guest house manager Surin Channet to give a false statement.</p> <p>In her fresh witness statement, the maid told police that Mr Channet stumbled across the body shortly after 2pm. Mr Channet yesterday admitted having \"sat upon the problem,\" although he denies having discovered the body on his own.</p> <p>The discovery that several residents secretly knew of the murder hours before police were alerted comes as police announced they were sure Kirsty's killer was staying at the guest house. </p> <p>Senior officers believe the killer was known to the Liverpool University graduate. </p> <p>Among those being questioned is Andrew Gill, 32, from Northern Ireland, the owner of the Aree hostel. He was arrested on Saturday and questioned about Kirsty's death and is now being held over alleged visa offences. </p> <p>An Australian guest at the hostel, Stuart Crichton, 28, is also being questioned over the death. All eight suspects have denied murder and none has asked for a lawyer. Thai police said a \"firm arrest\" would be made within 10 days. </p>",
  "The message is definitive: it covers a wall. \"Goodbye Mr President. Farewell to the Commander-in-Chief\". But a Proustian ambivalence haunts the marbled corridors of the mausoleum. We've come not to salute William Jefferson Clinton as his moment dies - but, in search of times past and future, to visit Richard Milhous Nixon at his final resting place amid the palm trees of suburban Los Angeles. <p>Wallowing in LA money, soft and hard, these past few days, President Bill has raised $40m for would-be President Al - but also $10m or so towards the Clinton memorial library. Presidencies, as they pass, are entombed like pharaohs in the burial chambers of artefacts, papers and slavish tribute. When power ends, so the Little Rock temple of pyramid selling - all $120m of it - must rise. What will it be like, this Clinton edifice? Consider the Nixon reality of Yorba Linda: a stretch of colonnades and vibrant flowers, a hushed entrance hall, servile flunkeys - and the first exhibition hall. \"Two American icons - the First Lady and Barbie together\". Yes, here are all the Presidents' wives of history wearing their inauguration dresses as Barbie dolls. Do you like Barbie Bush in pearls and blue velvet? Or Barbie Hillary in turquoise, blonde hair piled like an ice cream cone? I cherish Barbie Mamie Eisenhower in truly shocking pink. How did you enjoy the show, Mrs Lincoln? </p> <p>So to the memorabilia. Some is standard. The poster that reads \"Ike and Dick, Sure to Click\". The sanitised story of Alger Hiss. A TV rerun of the Kennedy debates which somehow doesn't let JFK get a word in. Bulbous yellow campaign Chevrolets and tank-like presidential Cadillacs. Yet we're only warming up. In a vaulted room, life-size statues of history's greats consort. Mao, de Gaulle, Kruschev, Churchill - and Dicky. (Whatever happened to Mrs T? Or, indeed, Spiro Agnew?) \"Please\", it says round the corner, \"Do Not Touch the Berlin Wall\". And there's an eight-foot lump of concrete covered in joyful graffiti as though our hero - out of time - had borne it back from the east in person. Next door the \"gifts of the people\" sit in sombre cabinets. A wooden clockwork elephant - \"donor anonymous\". Hand-knitted portraits of Nixon's dogs. A Colt 45 semi-automatic presented by a Mr Elvis Presley of Memphis, Tennessee. </p> <p>Beyond, a long, dark tunnel tells the \"story\" of Watergate, mostly concentrating on those who spoke out for truth and justice. \"I'll be damned if we're going to let this ugliness obscure the positive record of the President\" (George Bush, 1973). Then, suddenly, the great dissembler lives. \"Ask President Nixon a question\" by pressing computer screens and a video in a little chapel of resurrection brings you his answer. \"Did you ever feel unfairly treated by the press?\" \"Is it true that you only ate Milky Way for breakfast?\" \"What was your greatest poker hand?\" And the oracle of Yorba Linda responds at length. \"There will be a 17-minute time delay on your question\" the computer reports. Bizarre!</p> <p> Outside, on a lushly watered, grassy plot, Richard and Patricia Nixon lie side by side. Inside the justifications never end. Far outside, the Republican party - pledging to restore \"dignity and honour\" to the Oval Office - continues on its pious way. Do you feel under-appreciated Mr President? Answer in 36 minutes. Will it be like this, too, in Little Rock? The Paula Jones room with muzak from Gennifer Flowers, the Monica salon where the oracle Bill repeats that he never had sex with that woman, not ever, and broods through eternity on the meaning of \"is\"? Will his party, too, turn its back in forgetfulness once the final orations, the testaments to prosperity and 22m new jobs, have faded? Probably. </p> <p>History is a half-eaten hamburger at Camp David. Kitsch comes naturally in the valley of the pharaohs. But, for the moment, watching him joshing, grinning, raising the spirits and the boodle, it's hard to believe. After 1960, Richard Nixon wrote: \"The campaign had an intensity of spirit at once exhausting and uplifting.\" Campaigns are Clinton's adrenalin, his life. And now, in life, there is death. </p>",
  "<p>Prawns from the north Atlantic and the farmed mangrove ponds of Madagascar. Mussels and ribaldo from New Zealand waters. Antarctic ice fish, properly known as the Patagonian toothfish, from south of the Falklands. Halibut steaks from the Canadian Pacific coast. Bream and sea bass from Greece. Cod and herring from the old \"cod war\" battlefields off Iceland. </p> <p>A trawl through the supermarket fish counter reveals quite how diverse are the seas that supply the British consumer's changing tastes. These foreign visitors all compete for space with clams from Dorset, crabs from Norfolk, kippers from Northumberland, salmon from the Orkneys, trout from Wiltshire, and brill and dover sole from the south coast. </p> <p>This is Waitrose in Putney, south-west London, and fish sales are booming. Gourmet makeovers for fish conducted by trendy restaurants, \"healthy eating\" lifestyles and sophisticated new tastes gained on holidays abroad means that business at the chain's fish counters, which sell more than 50 varieties, is up a sixth on last year when high prices and shortages depressed sales throughout the UK. Nationally fresh fish sales are up 3.5% in volume this year and 6.5% in value. </p> <p>Fifty years ago, Britons ate nearly 30% more fish - we now eat less than 150g a week compared with nearly 190g in the 1950s. But although stocks around Britain have dwindled, fishing boat technology, the speed of air freight and the ingenuity of retailers offering ever new ranges of dishes appear to have sparked a partial revival. </p> <p>The market has changed notably even in the last six years, when farmed fish began to replace wild fish catches. Overall, household purchases of all fish except canned - a substantial market for tuna and salmon - continue to fall, although certain varieties show marked growth. Salmon consumption, for instance, has doubled and sales of prawns rose by 28% last year. Fish sales in this country are still worth over \u00a31bn each year. </p> <p>Fish remains, however, more expensive than meat, especially poultry, and meat consumption is still five times that of fish. Waitrose fish buyer Jeremy Ryland-Langley says: \"People have less time to prepare fish. Some filleting is difficult and we are seeing trends towards skinless and/or boneless products.\" </p> <p>Cod is still popular, even though some prices have risen faster than inflation in recent years. \"There are shortages in the North sea, and Canadian supplies are in decline,\" says Mr Ryland-Langley. \"[Iceland] is probably the healthiest cod fishery in the northern hemisphere.\" </p> <p>Fillets from Iceland cost nearly \u00a39 a kilo, \u00a34 more than ribaldo, a frozen alternative known here as New Zealand deep sea cod. Alaskan pollack, a fish close to cod, and Pacific cod will also become more widespread, to ensure supplies and keep cod prices down. </p> <p>Waitrose's salmon, the store's most popular fish, comes from a farmed sea loch in the Orkneys. A whole fish costs just over \u00a36.50 a kilo, more than 10% less than it did in 1992, and prices of fillets are unchanged since 1991, at just under \u00a311. In real terms, those prices represent huge cuts. </p> <p>During a morning spent at the fish counter, only one customer queried the fishing methods for a product - whether the brill was farmed. It is, in fact, freshly caught off the south coast, and the most expensive on the slab at nearly \u00a323.50 a kilo for fillets. Most suppliers now use ethical methods, according to Mr Ryland-Langley. Tuna and other game such as swordfish and marlin are all caught on lines rather than by \"wall of death\" nets that capture dolphins as well. </p> <p>The catering market is also changing. Salmon consumption has doubled in restaurants and some fish and chip shops are even trying salmon in the friers. Many southern businesses are following the northern and Scottish tradition of using haddock, also shrinking in supplies, instead of cod. </p> <p>It is market forces which some conservationists believe will tip the balance towards responsible fishing. The Marine Stewardship Council, an international organisation backed by companies such as Unilever and Youngs-Bluecrest, and the campaign group WWF (formerly the World Wide Fund for Nature), is convinced ethical labelling is the answer. </p> <p>At present only Thames Herring and the Australian rock lobster meet MSC requirements for sustainable supplies. But the troubled Alaskan salmon fishery is, among others, seeking the council's help. </p> <p>According to John Gummer, the former British fisheries minister and now the organisation's chairman, governments alone cannot solve the crisis because they will defend the interests of their own fishermen. \"We never really came to terms with the fact that whether we like it or not, fish is an international resource. Fish around these islands have to be shared and they don't come with flags on their fins.\"</p>",
  "North Korea has ridiculed US plans for a missile defence system by saying that Pyongyang would never be foolish enough to launch a \"rogue\" nuclear attack. <p>Pyongyang also said it would welcome diplomatic ties with Washington if the US stopped labelling it as a \"terrorist nation\". </p> <p>\"It is absurd to think we could win a war with the US if we attacked with just two or three intercontinental ballistic missiles,\" the North's leader Kim Jong-il said at the weekend. \"And yet, the US makes an issue of this.\" </p> <p>The statement strengthened optimism in South Korea, on the eve of today's meetings of long-divided families from both sides, that the new mood of realism displayed by North Korea at the Pyongyang summit in June is being sustained. </p> <p>Work will begin next month on rejoining the main north-south railway cut off by the Korean war 50 years ago, the South's president, Kim Dae-jung, said yesterday. </p> <p>The North has promised to withdraw 35,000 soldiers from the demilitarised zone to rebuild the severed track. The South is pressing for a meeting of defence ministers. </p> <p>Kim Jong-il confirmed that Pyongyang would consider scrapping its missile programme if the US agreed to launch two or three satellites annually on Pyongyang's behalf. He said the missiles were being developed as a matter of national pride, but at a high economic cost. </p> <p>The US national missile defence project has often been justified by referring to a hypothetical missile threat from an \"irrational\" North Korea. That scenario may be harder to sustain now that Pyongyang shows itself well aware of the suicidal costs of such an attack. </p> <p>Today's meetings of divided families involve only 100 people from each side, but they are regarded as symbolic of a more substantial process of national reunion. A permanent meeting point for families may be established at the border village of Panmunjom. </p> <p>In another sign of normalisation, North and South Korea reactivated their liaison offices at Panmunjom yesterday. </p> <p> <b>Useful links</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.kimsoft.com/korea.htm\" target=\"_new\">Korea Web Weekly</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.kimsoft.com/dprk.htm\" target=\"_new\">Democratic People's Republic of Korea</a></p>",
  "The body of the backpacker Kirsty Jones was found at least two hours earlier than previously thought, the Guardian can reveal, by residents at the guesthouse where she was staying. <p>The Thai maid who originally claimed she found Kirsty's body yesterday admitted to police that the body had been discovered by someone else. Nung Ni, who said she made the discovery at 4.30pm last Thursday when she went to \"clean Kirsty's room\", told detectives that the guesthouse manager Surin Channet had stumbled across Kirsty shortly after 2pm. She had been \"leant upon\" to give a false statement, she added. </p> <p>Shortly afterwards, urgent efforts were made to contact Andy Gill, the guesthouse's British owner, who had gone out at lunchtime. He was telephoned by a Dutch friend who told him: \"Something big has happened ... Get back now.\" </p> <p>Mr Channet yesterday admitted having \"sat upon the problem\". But he denied discovering Kirsty's body on his own. He claimed he had found her jointly with Ms Ni. </p> <p>Ms Ni gave a fresh witness statement for several hours to police yesterday after being persuaded by Mr Gill's estranged Thai girlfriend, Mem, that her evidence could help to exonerate him. They have a two-year-old son. Police questioned Mr Gill on Saturday in connection with Kirsty's murder. He was arrested at the same time for alleged visa offences and is now in prison. </p> <p>\"Ni realised the gravity of the situation and came to understand she had to tell the truth,\" one source said. It is not clear whether Kirsty's room was tampered with before police arrived. </p> <p>The revelation that several residents secretly knew of Kirsty's death hours before police were informed comes as the detective leading the murder investigation yesterday said he was sure the man who killed Kirsty was staying at the guesthouse. </p> <p>Police colonel Prasit Thamdi said an autopsy report showed that Kirsty had initially consented to sex, but was then raped and strangled. She was killed with a dark blue sarong she had been wearing as a skirt. \"She knew her killer,\" he said. Her death might have been accidental,\" he added. </p> <p>Detectives are today expected to eliminate some of the eight suspects who have been detained over Kirsty's murder when forensic tests reveal the killer's blood group. </p> <p>Several dark hairs from the killer were recovered from the scene and have been sent away for analysis. They could belong to either a foreigner or a Thai national, police say. \"The investigation has come a long way but it could be seven to 10 days before we make an arrest,\" Mr Thamdi added. \"I am certain one of these eight was her killer.\" </p> <p>All eight suspects have given blood samples. Mr Gill, a long-term resident in Thailand, has been tested along with five other foreign backpackers who were staying at the guesthouse on the night of Kirsty's murder. </p> <p>They include Nathan Foley, 27, who holds dual Australian and British nationality, and who had a meal with Kirsty hours before her death, and Australian Stuart Crichton, 28. He is in the same cell as Mr Gill in Chiang Mai police station after heroin and cannabis were allegedly found in his room. Two Thais have also been tested: Mr Channet, and a tour guide Abraham Narong, who took Kirsty trekking. </p> <p>Ms Jones, 23, had been travelling on her own in Thailand for three months and was staying in one of the guesthouse's downstairs bedrooms when she was murdered. </p> <p>Other residents were woken by her screams of \"Get off, get off, leave me alone, leave me alone\" but did not open her door after the screams stopped. Her killer padlocked her door from the outside and fled. </p> <p>Kirsty's body is expected to be released by Thai police later today and flown back to her home in Brecon, Wales, for the funeral.</p>",
  "For a brief moment things looked hopeful in the unhappy valley of Kashmir. But after a weekend of attacks on Indian security forces, the recent ceasefire by Hizbul Mojahedin is taking on the musty smell of ancient history. On July 24 Hizbul Mojahedin declared a ceasefire. The group is one of the oldest and most powerful of those fighting the Indian army. Expectations for a new beginning ran high, and seemed to be justified as India first suspended its offensive against Hizbul and then officially met its representatives. <p>However, the talks soon broke off. India refused to accept the involvement of Pakistan. Hope lingered until Thursday. But Hizbul's attacks have put paid to any negotiations in the near future. None the less, the whole episode gives an insight into the movement of the greatest fault line in south Asian politics. </p> <p>Kashmir has been the flashpoint for two wars since 1947. Pakistan's claim to the territory rests on its Muslim population and its border with Muslim Pakistan. India's claim rests on the decision of Hari Singh, the last maharajah of Kashmir, to join the Indian Union in 1947, and on the fact that his kingdom, which became the Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir, was home to many Hindus and some Buddhists, as well as Muslims. </p> <p>It was not until 1989 that guerrilla movements sprang up among the easygoing Kashmiris. The Afghans' success against the Soviet army inspired similar tactics. And some of the western weapons and money that were flowing through Pakistan were easily diverted towards Kashmir. Soon, foreigners (Pakistanis, Afghans and even Arabs) became involved. </p> <p>The insurgency developed a season. Fighters cross the mountains dividing the Indian and Pakistani parts of Kashmir as they become passable in late spring. The insurgents operate through the summer against the 125,000 Indian soldiers stationed in the valley. They are supplied with food, shelter, weapons and medicine via Pakistan. As the autumn snows fall in the mountains the guerrillas retreat across the porous \"line of control\" separating the combatants. </p> <p>Last year witnessed a twist to this pattern. By early spring, fighters had already crossed the mountains and seized the region of Kargil. Battle was joined with India shelling the insurgents' salient and the United States pressing Pakistan to have its clients withdraw. The insurgents' eventual retreat was seen as a defeat for Pakistan. It led swiftly to the overthrow of the civilian government of Nawaz Sharif and the resumption of military rule. </p> <p> Pakistan's fingerprints are all over the recent ceasefire. Officially, the government was neutral. Pakistan only gives what it describes curiously as political, diplomatic and moral support to the insurgent groups. General Musharraf, who seized power in the coup, refused either to praise or criticise the ceasefire. However, it is no coincidence that the ceasefire was offered by one of the few groups of Kashmiris who support union with Pakistan. Musharraf himself called the ceasefire \"an opportunity for dialogue with India\". That it broke down over the issue of just such a dialogue confirms Pakistan's involvement. </p> <p>In the eyes of the world the ceasefire has left Pakistan looking relatively moderate over Kashmir. India, on the other hand, triumphant last summer, now appears unwilling to go the extra mile. General Musharraf's peaceful noises will have pleased the Americans, which is vital if he is to drag his country out of its economic and political morass. Meanwhile he has lost nothing. No one in his army can say he took the pressure off India. The insurgency went on throughout Hizbul's ceasefire with, for example, the murder of 90 Hindu pilgrims. </p> <p>Yet Pakistan's position remains weak. The insurgents are a doubtful weapon. They pin down Indian troops and goad them into acts of oppression, no doubt. But meanwhile the fighters encourage the spread of Islamism in the Pakistani army. They also let the Taliban blackmail Pakistan over the presence of its paramilitary camps in Afghanistan. </p> <p>The support of foreign states also has its pitfalls. CIA revelations that China helped Pakistan develop ballistic missile technology will serve only to frighten the west. China already occupies part of northern Kashmir. It would be happy for the Tibetan people of Ladakh to fall under its control. It is willing to help Pakistan compete in an expensive and time-consuming large arms race. But China will be less keen to sell small arms that could find their way to its own Muslim insurgents in Xinjiang. </p> <p>With the prospect of mutually assured destruction hanging above south Asia, peace in Kashmir is not a luxury but a necessity. The west must invest in economic and political stability in Pakistan. Then all the peoples of Kashmir should be asked what future they want: status quo, union with Pakistan or independence. This question, however, cannot be posed until fair elections are possible. The fighting must stop and paramilitary weapons must be silenced. Hizbul Mojahedin's short ceasefire has at least set a precedent for that silence. </p> <p> <a href=\"mailto:comment@theguardian.com\"> comment@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "A couple who have been on the run for seven years after defying the forced marriage system are to use the Human Rights Act to try to win greater protection from vindictive relatives. <p>Jack and Zena Briggs have been forced to move home 27 times since their secret wedding in 1994, because of fears that their false identity package is too thin to deceive Zena's family, who had previously planned her marriage to a cousin in Pakistan.</p> <p>The pair, who courted in Bradford after meeting in one of the city's parks, say that they are suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder and cannot get jobs, because the protection package includes no employment history or references and the Home Office has refused to issue birth and marriage certificates to go with their new names and passports.</p> <p>\"The police, local authorities and even senior government ministers have chosen to ignore our problems. Now we want justice. We want them to admit they got it wrong,\" said Jack, 39.</p> <p>\"We were hunted like animals, and when we turned to the authorities for help we were treated like animals. They have lied to us, passed us over, betrayed us and abandoned us.</p> <p>\"We set out so full of hope of starting a new life together, but those hopes have come to nothing. We are worse off than when we started out.\"</p> <p>Zena Briggs, 28, who came from a prosperous Muslim background in contrast to her husband's lack of qualifications and succession of manual jobs, said that she had thought about suicide because of the \"dreary and friendless\" regime of being holed up for 23 hours a day.</p> <p>She said: \"All we did was get married and we have been punished for it, not only by my family, but by a system that has chosen to ignore us.\"</p> <p>The couple plan to bring a case when the Human Rights Act becomes law in October, suing for the complete new identities offered to police \"supergrasses\" and former terrorists. They say that the case has implications for other victims of attempts at forced marriages - an illegal perversion of the arranged marriage system used by some Asian-origin families with prospective partners' consent.</p> <p>The Briggses have highlighted the issue in a book published three years ago, and they lobbied the junior Home Office minister, Mike O'Brien, last year, with Ann Cryer, the Labour MP for Keighley, who has been prominent in attacking forced marriages.</p> <p>But Mr Briggs said that they now felt they had been \"used\" in order to spotlight the issue, but had subsequently been left to founder.</p> <p>The Home Office said that the issue could be tested when the Human Rights Act became law, but denied that the couple had been short-changed on protection.</p> <p>A spokesman said: \"At Mr O'Brien's meeting with Jack and Zena Briggs, he made it clear that the handling of the case was an operational matter for police and that ministers had no authority to intervene.</p> <p>\"The police acted properly and the couple are now adjudged not to be at risk,\" the spokesman said.</p> <p>The Home Office added that police had offered the couple suitable safe accommodation at one stage, but this had been rejected.</p> <p>However, Mr Briggs said that the offer had been too risky, because it was in a town with a large number of asylum seekers and a recent history of racist attacks.</p> <p>The couple say that they do not feel out of danger, because one of Zena's relatives had told her that the family would bide its time.</p> <p>Mr Briggs added: \"If we had been given the full new identity package, we could have started a new life. We believe that our civil and human rights have been breached.\"</p>",
  "Children under the age of 14 are working on the ranch of the Mexican president-elect, Vicente Fox, sowing onions and potatoes in contravention of laws banning child labour, a newspaper reported at the weekend. <p>The Mexico City daily Reforma said on Saturday that it had found at least 30 minors and teenagers being taken by truck into the Fox family ranch, San Cristobal, in the central state of Guanajuato, to work in the fields for about 65 pesos (about \u00a34) a day. </p> <p>The Mexican constitution bans children younger than 14 from working. Children between 14 and 16 are only allowed to work six hours a day, and the country recently ratified an International Labour Organisation convention against some of the worst forms of abuse of children as workers. </p> <p>Nevertheless, child labour, especially in the impoverished countryside, is common. </p> <p>Mr Fox, who recently returned from a tour of South America in his first foreign trip before taking office on December 1, spent the weekend at the ranch. His aides could not be reached for comment. </p> <p>Reforma said that among the more than 30 youngsters picked up at 5.30am on Saturday were 12-year-old Jose, 13-year-old Juan and 11-year-old Sanjuana. </p> <p>It said the children showed its reporter their 390-peso (\u00a328) weekly paycheck. Reforma said that since the children were hired as seasonal workers, they received no other benefits. </p> <p>Many of the children had left school to help earn money for their families. They worked from 7am to around 4pm, taking an hour lunch break. </p> <p>A young man who appeared to be taking care of them, Mario, aged 20, complained about the hard work and low pay. \"It barely pays for food and they don't pay you for every day you work,\" Mario said. </p> <p>On July 2 Mr Fox broke the Institutional Revolutional party's 71-year grip on the presidency. Running for the conservative National Action party, he promised to battle against corruption and a widespread disregard for the law.</p>",
  "<p>The Edinburgh festival fringe is probably the only place in the world where you can become a legend in three weeks. Nowhere else are theatrical myths forged so quickly: Tom Stoppard was discovered through Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, Manfred Karge's Conquest of the South Pole appeared during Jenny Killick's golden age of the Traverse in the mid-80s, and Theatre de Complicite won - of all things - the Perrier award in 1985. </p> <p>Last year it was the turn of Do/Fabrik, a Russian-German company whose physical theatre piece Hopeless Games stole into Edinburgh and played a handful of performances. Most of those were half-empty. By the time word got round that Hopeless Games was the real McCoy, the company had melted into the night. </p> <p>The good news is that the show is back for an extended run this year and more than lives up to its own legend. It is an extraordinary hour of distinctly European theatre that integrates live action with video and an eerie soundscape to take the audience on a playful journey into the heart of darkness. </p> <p>Perhaps the reason its potent images speak so eloquently is that they were created out of a failure of words. When Potsdam's Fabrik Theatre decided to join forces with St Petersburg's Do Theatre, a company known in the late 80s and early 90s for its extremist body theatre, the two companies had no common language. The difficulties of communicating with each other made for a tense and often frustrating rehearsal period, but led to an impressive level of cooperation on stage. Those who dream of creating British ensembles should see Hopeless Games and weep. </p> <p>It could be about the Holocaust and it could be about Kosovo. It could be about the desperate asylum seekers who die in the attempt to reach these shores. It could just be about the world's losers, the failed would-be suicides and all our broken hearts. The beauty of Hopeless Games is that it is sufficiently open-ended that audiences can interpret it as they like. But it is not in any way imprecise. The company is well aware that there is a thin line between ambiguity and bullshit in this kind of dance theatre. </p> <p>In fact, it was the idea of fallen angels, a frequent image in Russian literature and art, that provided the inspiration for the show. It's set on an apparently deserted railway station. Out of the darkness appear headless clown-like figures who waddle about like tiny solemn children, balloons rising above their heads while a haunting soundtrack wafts across the auditorium like a memory of voices and music you once heard but had long forgotten. </p> <p>Gradually it becomes apparent that these ghostly figures, with their battered suitcases and endlessly tramping feet, are a queue of refugees stretching back through history, always on the march, looking for a place to rest. In the railway tracks of Europe, they find a route to a destination that is too terrible to contemplate. In one of the most devastating passages lacing live action and video I've ever seen, a train roars out of the video screen on the back wall and appears to thunder over the stage and into the audience. You duck, and when you look again the carriages rumble over the actors' prone bodies, the light wrapping their limbs in the embrace of death. </p> <p>Yet they refuse to lie down to die. Even when they dice with death, they do it with laughter, playing Russian roulette, giggling at the prospect of oblivion. They dance and stamp their feet in defiance at what history has in store for them, their witty, whirling feet full of a kind of desperate joy. </p> <p>For all its echoes of the catastrophes of history and its portrayal of the fact that nothing ever really changes, Hopeless Games is ultimately optimistic, raising the ghosts of the faceless millions who have trudged into oblivion down the centuries. At the end the stage is suddenly ablaze with fireworks. The tiny, lonesome figures walk jauntily towards the fire, forever smiling, their clothes apparently ablaze. Out of the darkness and into the light. What are they walking towards? Heaven or hell? Who knows? Long after the show has ended, its sizzling white energy still sears the retina. Such purity is hard to find and even harder to forget. </p> <p>Hopeless Games is at Komedia @ Southside till Thursday, then on August 21, 23-27. Box office: 0131-667 2212.</p>",
  "<p>It seems that young people have never had it so good. According to the Y2K Wall's survey, the average weekly pocket money has leapt a \"staggering\" 29% since last year, to \u00a33.10.</p> <p>Particularly flush are 15- and 16-year-olds, who have \u00a35.66 a week to lavish on their lifestyles. And - surprise, surprise - top of their shopping lists and soaking up 57p in the pound are ice cream, crisps and chocolate. </p> <p>But there are other teenagers in the UK with deeper pockets and wider horizons. Across the country, sets of young people have spent the past 18 months becoming philanthropists. Entrusted with five-figure bugets, and in one case a six-figure one, their remit has been to find and fund projects likely to benefit their age group in areas of profound social need. </p> <p>The scheme is called Youthbank - Cash For Action and following the success of seven pilot programmes, it is due to go national in the next year.</p> <p>\"Youthbank encourages young people between the ages of 15 and 25 to become active citizens,\" says its creator, Michael Norton - the founder and first director of the Directory of Social Change. \"It gives them the opportunity to put money where they believe it will make a difference and be responsible for the decisions they make.\"</p> <p>At present, Youthbank is run as a partnership by a number of organisations with a strong commitment to young people's community involvement. These include the National Youth Agency, the Community Foundation Network, the British Youth Council and the charity Changemakers. In addition to distributing an initial \u00a3185,000 in trust-fund grants to set up the seven pilot schemes, they have also played an active role in supporting them locally.</p> <p>According to Michael Norton, while certain principles are key to every youthbank, there is plenty of scope for groups to mould the scheme to suit local needs. \"This is not a rigid franchise like McDonalds,\" he explains. So while the Bristol Youthbank invited applications from across the city, the Shadwell committee in east London chose to focus on their immediate community, and accepted bids from groups sometimes comprising only two people.</p> <p>\"The most important thing,\" says Lucky Begum of the Shadwell Youthbank, \"is that every idea is aimed at benefiting other local young people.\" </p> <p>In Northern Ireland the group has spread its net across the entire six counties while moving its monthly meetings from area to area so as to safeguard it from accusations of sectarian partiality.</p> <p>\"This means all involved have to make a considerable commitment,\" says Vernon Ringland of the Northern Ireland Voluntary Trust, who provides adult support for the group. \"It can take two hours travelling either side of the gatherings, and even cutting their assessments to 20 minutes per funding application means they are at it for five hours sometimes.\"</p> <p>The Troubles have also meant that Northern Ireland Youthbank members have faced some very challenging situations. \"When we go out to assess a scheme, we divide into pairs - Protestant and Catholic together,\" explains Tricia McNally. \"It can be scary as a Catholic going into a Protestant area - you have to take care not to use the slang that can give you away. Even a simple question here such as 'Where are you from?' has to be handled carefully. Although we are never in any danger, people can be aggressive.\"</p> <p>Tricia is full of praise for the training the Youthbank team received as part of its induction before the business of grant-making began. \"For me the equal opportunities work we did was very valuable. The facilitator did everything he could to challenge our prejudices.\" </p> <p>Education is at the centre of all the Youthbank pilots. Each group receives a whole raft of specialist advice, ranging from budget management and accounting, assessing applications, communications and marketing. </p> <p>Ashan Ali is a member of the Bradford group, which has already distributed \u00a3120,000 to more than 3,000 local youth schemes - its coffers swelled by European Social Fund money and other local grants. \"I knew nothing about funding at the start,\" he says. \"All the training has helped me, and now I act as a mentor to others.\" </p> <p>His view is shared by 15-year-old Gina Mitchell in Bristol: \"I have learnt how to look at an application and spot whether or not it really has been filled in by a young person - that is one of our rules.\"</p> <p>John Cabbot, at the end of his year 10 GCSE studies, is full of praise for the Bristol scheme: \"It is excellent to be involved in real decision making - giving out money to others is one of the greatest things in the world, but it is also very hard to say no.\" </p> <p>The Bristol Youthbank was highly critical of the kind of application forms most youth groups have to tackle if applying for money. They spotted that demanding lots of bank details was just intimidating and also irrelevant.</p> <p>\"They would only need that kind of stuff if they were successful,\" says John Cabbot. His group has distributed \u00a312,000, whittling down 43 applications to just 17 for a payout. \"But just because a group has been unsuccessful does not mean they cannot try for funds again,\" says Cabbot. \"We will contact groups that missed out and explain how they can improve their application next time - we are due to start another funding cycle soon.\"</p> <p>It is the long-term benefits of Youthbank that prove its greatest attraction to members of the consortium running it. \"Not only is the scheme possibly creating the trustees of the future, but it is channelling resources to just the kinds of disaffected young people that adult funding agencies and governments find so hard to reach,\" says Community Foundation Network director Gaynor Humphreys.</p> <p>Her view is borne out by the experience of the Shadwell group, who helped two boys buy sound equipment to help train other aspiring musicians in the area and are now seeking more training themselves as their local youth work expands. Elsewhere, Youthbank money has provided for outdoor adventure activities for homeless teenagers in Bradford, cookers for youth centres in Bristol and non-sectarian murals in Newry, Northern Ireland. </p> <p>One criticism all Youthbanks are sensitive to is the degree that those they fund remain accountable. In Bristol the group is about to embark on a summer-long series of visits to its successful applicants. </p> <p>In Bradford it is Ashan Ali's experience that people are eager to come in to show off the receipts: \"They are pleased they have been trusted,\" he explains. In Shadwell the proper use of funds is guaranteed by a simple message on the application form: \"Don't forget, we live in the area - we know where you are!\"</p> <p>\u0095 The next stage of Youthbank will involve developing the scheme as part of the citizenship programme in schools.
