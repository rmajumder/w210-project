  "This has been the best, the most upbeat and the most successful Conservative Conference in years. <p> This week the people of Britain look to us to see if we are ready to be a Government. </p> <p> And with the policies we have presented and the purpose we have demonstrated, we have shown beyond doubt that we are ready for Government. </p> <p> This week the people of Britain look to us to see if we have the right team to run the country. </p> <p> And with brilliant platform speeches we have shown beyond doubt that this Shadow Cabinet, with its breadth of vision and its depth of talent, is the best team for Britain. </p> <p> The breadth of vision to help hard working families; and depth of talent too. Didn't Michael Portillo make a fantastic speech and show what a brilliant Chancellor of the Exchequer he'll be?</p> <p> The breadth of vision to preserve our independence in a flexible Europe; and the depth of talent. After years of Robin Cook wouldn't it be great to have a real Foreign Secretary like Francis Maude?</p> <p> The breadth of vision to rejuvenate our inner cities, set our schools free, help our pensioners and improve the NHS; and the depth of talent with people like Michael Ancram, Archie Norman, Theresa May, David Willetts and Dr Liam Fox ready to take up the challenge of government.</p> <p> The breadth of vision to win the war against crime; and the depth of talent that would give us a great crime-fighting Home Secretary in Ann Widdecombe. </p> <p> Our Conference has looked like a Conference for the future. Labour's looked like a Conference from the past. </p> <p> After all the years of trying to control the trade unions, it was back to beer and sandwiches in Brighton last week. Tony Blair likes beer and sandwiches without the beer. I like it without the sandwiches. Come to think of it, I like it without the unions.</p> <p> And throughout this week, we have shown the British people beyond doubt that we can win the next general election.</p> <p> Thanks to the Deputy Prime Minister we now know when that election is planned to be. Last week that political titan was asked a trick question: has Labour's disastrous performance changed your plans for an election in six month's time? John Prescott innocently replied: 'no it hasn't'.</p> <p> But even without John Prescott helping us out, we're ready for that election whenever Tony Blair now dares to call it. We're ready for it next autumn, we're ready for it next May, we're ready for it now. Go on Tony, call it now.</p> <p> We all remember the armchair critics who told us after the last election that we could not recover. Don't even bother they said, for we have entered a new world in which Tony Blair can do no wrong and New Labour will rule forever.</p> <p> But New Labour was not a philosophy, it was a fashion. And nothing is more unfashionable than a fashion that's out of fashion.</p> <p> We saw them last week, divided, arrogant and out of touch. What a bunch they are - this soap opera of a government.</p> <p> In last week's episode of the Neighbours from Hell: Robin has fallen out with Peter. Peter won't talk to Geoffrey any more. Geoffrey won't lend his holiday home to Tony. Mo has been sent to Coventry. Clare doesn't like the tent run by Tony's crony. Tony's crony blames Chris and Peter. Tony rows with Gordon. Peter won't speak to Gordon. And Gordon won't speak to anyone at all.</p> <p> Last week in Brighton the security was so tight it was Wednesday before they stabbed each other in the back.</p> <p> No Ministers in recent times have lost touch so rapidly with the people who elected them.</p> <p> When an angry pensioner sent a cheque for 75p to Gordon Brown, he cashed it.</p> <p> When Baroness Jay was asked if she understood the desperate crisis in farming, she said she knew all about it because she \"had a little cottage in the country\".</p> <p> Cocooned in Whitehall they have retreated into a world where they never have to make do with a failing school, or witness a crime, or pay for a tank of petrol.</p> <p> It is fundamental to their decline that they have betrayed and forgotten the real people of this country. And it is fundamental to our recovery that we have become the champions of the common sense instincts of the people of our country.</p> <p> And it is you, the people of this country, who do wait for hospital treatment, and do see crime on your street, and do pay for your tank of petrol, that I have in my mind as we fight the next election - It's you that I'm in it for.</p> <p> For all the people who can't afford to pay more in tax to a Government that squanders their money - I'm in it for you.</p> <p> For all the people who want classrooms where teachers can apply reasonable discipline to children without fear of ending up in court - I'm in it for you.</p> <p> For all the people who despair at the neglect and poverty and waste of human talent in our inner cities and want to do something about it - I'm in it for you.</p> <p> For all the people who think it's a scandal when a patient's throat cancer operation is cancelled four times because of political targets - I'm in it for you.</p> <p> For all the people who think that the law should be on the side of the house-owner and not the house-breaker - I'm in it for you.</p> <p> For all the people who can see that our asylum system is in chaos and want political leaders with the courage to get up and say so - I'm in it for you.</p> <p> For all the people who believe that we shouldn't be handing over more of the rights and powers of this country - I'm in it for you.</p> <p> For all the people who want to keep the Pound - I'm in it for you.</p> <p> For all the people who are sick of the spin and the waste and the lies and the cronies and the sycophants, sick of the arrogance and the high-handedness, sick of the contempt for our traditions and for our Parliament, sick of a Chancellor too out of touch to listen and of a Prime Minister too arrogant to apologise, for all those people - we are all in it for you.</p> <p> For all the people who really hoped that they had elected a Government that would deliver on its promises and have been so bitterly disappointed - we are in it for you.</p> <p> These are people who look to us to give them back their country. And we will not let them down.</p> <p> When Tony Blair declared war on the forces of Conservatism, he declared war on all these people.</p> <p> Last year, in his Conference speech, he said defeating the forces of Conservatism was his great mission for the twenty first century. Last week, nine months into the twenty first century, he didn't mention the forces of Conservatism at all.</p> <p> We really do have a Prime Minister who is prepared to say whatever will please his audience without the slightest consistent thought or principle entering his head.</p> <p> But just because he's stopped talking about the forces of Conservatism, it hasn't made us go away. Just because he's paranoid about the forces of Conservatism doesn't mean we're not out to get him.</p> <p> Because what will bring this Government down is its arrogant contempt for the views of real people.</p> <p> You know the precise moment when everyone started to see through New Labour? Midnight. December 31st last year. You probably all had a good time on New Year's Eve. Ffion and I, we went to the Dome.</p> <p> What did Tony Blair tell us about the Dome? 'I'm absolutely sure that this is going to be a startling and exhilarating success \u0085 it will be the most famous new building in the world in the year 2000'. Well he wasn't wrong about that. </p> <p> And then there was John Prescott: 'if we can't make the Dome work, we're not much of a Government'. Whatever would we do without him?</p> <p> Tony Blair told us that the Dome would be 'the first paragraph of Labour's next Election Manifesto'. What a good idea. </p> <p> In fact such a good idea that I thought I'd help him out by drafting it for him: 'Our New Labour Government, by wasting vast sums of money on something shiny and glitzy on the outside, empty and meaningless on the inside, with no understanding of our history, no vision of our future, and with so much hype followed by complete and utter failure, have successfully built the perfect monument to the way we have governed Britain for the last four years'.</p> <p> There it is, the Dome: the first paragraph of their Manifesto and the last word about their Government.</p> <p> For the real lesson is even more serious than the failure of the Dome. It is that the Prime Minister who now admits that Governments can't run visitor attractions still thinks that Governments know best how to interfere in every classroom, manage every hospital ward, regulate every business and spend everyone's money. </p> <p> You've seen how New Labour said the Dome was going to be a success, and poured your money into it, put their cronies in charge, denied there was a problem, and how at the end it was the people of this country who had to pick up the bill. </p> <p> That is New Labour. That's what they're doing to our schools. That's what they're doing to our hospitals. That's what they're doing to our police force. </p> <p> With the Dome it's taken nine months to see that these interfering busy bodies didn't know what they were doing. Don't give them five more years to prove that they don't know what they're doing with our schools and our hospitals and our police.</p> <p> Peter Mandelson said recently: something's gone seriously wrong with this Labour Government, but what is it? </p> <p> Shall we tell him?</p> <p> Tax is rising faster than anywhere in the developed world. Hospital waiting lists are up 87,000. Secondary school class sizes are bigger. Welfare bills are soaring. Crime is rising after years of falling. The transport system is at a standstill. Petrol taxes are the highest in Europe. Red tape is prolific. Waste is endemic. The bureaucracy is bloated. Political correctness is rampant. The countryside is in crisis. The cities are neglected. Our independence as a nation is being given away and the Prime Minister is spending millions of pounds trying to con us all into abolishing the Pound when we all want to keep it. </p> <p> That's what's wrong with this Government.</p> <p> Three years ago at this Conference I made a prediction. I said: 'New Labour have certainly changed politics for the time being. Their politics without conscience brought fascination to begin with. Then admiration. But next it will bring disillusion. Finally it will bring contempt'. </p> <p> We remember the fascination. We endured the admiration. We have seen the disillusion and now, like millions of our fellow citizens, we feel the contempt. </p> <p> In his speech last week, Tony Blair announced again: 'I will act'. Well, of course he will. It's all been an act. It's only ever been an act. He's the biggest actor in town.</p> <p> But no amount of acting can save him from the truth spelt out in one of those famous Downing Street memos: 'TB' - a clever disguise - 'is not believed to be real. He lacks conviction, he is all spin and presentation, he just says things to please people, not because he believes them.'</p> <p> TB spent thousands of pounds getting that advice. WH could have told him it for nothing.</p> <p> The only person in the country still stuck in the fascination stage with New Labour is the Leader of the Liberals. But of course we've witnessed the four stages of the Liberal Party too. Irrelevance, irrelevance, irrelevance, and irrelevance.</p> <p> So people now look to us. They've seen through the Labour Party and its Leader. Millions are coming to know that not only has Labour failed to deliver, but that they are never going to deliver.</p> <p> This week, and in the coming weeks, people want to know what the alternative will be. They look to us. They want to know if we're ready. They want to know what drives us, what motivates us, what we would be like in office. They want to know where we come from and where we're going to.</p> <p> And they want to know what motivates me.</p> <p> Come with me to the Rother Valley, to the heart of South Yorkshire. See Rotherham, the industrial town I was born in. Visit Wath Comprehensive, the school that gave me a chance in life. </p> <p> Come and meet the people I grew up with. Children of proud mothers who struggled with small budgets, who relied on the local health service, and who hoped for a better life for their sons and their daughters. Children of fathers who worked hard in mines and on farms and in steel works, who never knew the security of owning a home or saving for a pension, who had no choice but to live from one week's pay packet to the next. </p> <p> Those children I grew up with have families of their own now. Many are better off than their parents. They own their own home and they're saving for a pension. Their jobs are in supermarkets, in high street banks, in telephone call centres; they're nurses and teachers and self-employed builders. And the girls in my class are now juggling with all the competing pressures of being good mothers and holding down a good job.</p> <p> But these people, the children I grew up with in South Yorkshire, want the same things as their parents did. They want security and stability for themselves and their families. They want a better life for their own children. </p> <p> Don't think that because they holiday in Tenerife and not Tuscany that they don't have aspirations for a better life.</p> <p> Don't think that because they've moved to Ilkley and not Islington that their voice can be ignored.</p> <p> The people I grew up with, and millions like them, are the mainstream of our country. They are the people who motivate me. </p> <p> And I know that they have almost given up on any politician from any political party standing up for them. </p> <p> For they see their modest incomes eaten away by more taxes every time they fill up their car or tear open their pay slip, and they wonder if any politician knows what its like to raise three children on a family budget that just won't stretch any further. </p> <p> They see young thugs walking free from our courts, and they wonder if any politician knows what it's like to live on a council estate where the criminals take control after dark. </p> <p> They see the independence of the country they love cast aside, and they wonder if any politician shares their patriotism and their pride in being British.</p> <p> These people, the people I grew up with, the mainstream people of this country, are the people who motivate me. </p> <p> And these are the people we will govern for. We will govern for hard working families. We will govern for people of every community and background. We will govern for the mainstream that New Labour has ignored. We will govern for all the people. </p> <p> For when New Labour say to us that we're only appealing to core Conservative voters when we talk about crime and asylum and tax and Europe, I say to them that they have completely lost touch with the hard working families of this country.</p> <p> I say to hard-working families everywhere: I know that you are looking at our Party and judging whether we are ready for government.</p> <p> You know that we are tough on crime, and I tell you this: no government in recent times has been as tough on criminals as we will be.</p> <p> You know that we want to reduce taxes, and no government in recent times has been as committed to cutting taxes as we will be.</p> <p> You know that we believe in Britain, and no party will stand up for the rights and independence of our country with as much resolve and fortitude as we will.</p> <p> You know all this, but I want you to hear something else you may not know.</p> <p> The Conservative Party in Government will direct its energies to improving the schools that are the most hopeless, to bringing life to inner city areas that are the most bleak, to helping pensioners that are the least well off, to tackling drug problems that scar the least fortunate, to addressing family break down in the most dislocated communities, and to improving the health care for those most dependent on the NHS.</p> <p> And it is because we are ready to do all these things that the message coming loud and clear from this Conference is that we are ready for government.</p> <p> There are some who say there is a contradiction between traditional Conservative issues and winning new Tory audiences; between tolerance and mutual respect for all people, and championing the mainstream values of the country.</p> <p> There is no contradiction. I say being tough on crime, believing in lower taxes and the robust defence of our nation's independence are not in contradiction with wanting better schools and hospitals and thriving inner cities; they are an essential part of achieving all those things. I say defeating political correctness and refusing simply to accept every demand from every pressure group is not in contradiction with respecting the differences between individuals; on the contrary, the championing of mainstream values is the championing of tolerance, mutual respect and the rich diversity of our country. </p> <p> Only by trusting the instincts and the individuals and the institutions and the independence of the people of this country can we hope to seize the opportunity that this Government is so tragically squandering.</p> <p> That's why we're going to lead a Common Sense Revolution.</p> <p> That's why we're going to govern for the hard working, hard pressed, decent law abiding people of this country and bring an end to the rule of the small out-of-touch New Labour clique that thinks it is so much better than the rest of us.</p> <p> We're going to govern for the families who've earned every penny they've got and need every penny they earn and want a Government that will cut taxes.</p> <p> Three weeks ago we experienced something in this country we hadn't seen for more than 20 years. The pumps ran out of petrol, the shops ran out of bread, and the country came to a standstill. Labour governments, don't you just love 'em?</p> <p> Tony Blair and his Government say we mustn't give in to pickets. </p> <p> What a nice little lecture from the same Labour politicians who led the seamans' strike and encouraged the miner's strike and supported the secondary pickets.</p> <p> If he'd really been listening, he'd never have introduced his stealth taxes and he'd never have had blockades and he'd never have had the vast majority of the people of this country join in a taxpayers' revolt. </p> <p> Well if they don't understand the taxpayers revolt, we do. If he's not in sympathy with it, we are. And if he won't cut taxes, we will. </p> <p> This Government has contempt for those who want low taxes. They think that wanting lower taxes is selfish and greedy.</p> <p> Wanting to pay less tax isn't greedy. The truck driver who told me how he had to work day and night and sleep in his cab just to feed a family he scarcely got to see wasn't being greedy.</p> <p> He was just desperate and angry to see that hard earned money he'd scraped together disappear in stealth taxes. </p> <p> And I tell him now that the Conservative Party understands the life he's living and we see his desperation and we share his anger and we will govern for him.</p> <p> Wanting to pay less tax isn't greedy. The young software consultant that I met who shook his head as he talked of his plans to move abroad because of the stealth taxes he now faces wasn't being greedy.</p> <p> He just can't understand how this country can ever succeed if he's being taxed out of work in an era when business can go anywhere in the world and we need innovators so badly.</p> <p> And I tell him now that the Conservative Party can see the damage being done to the economic future of our country and we see our talent going abroad and we share his belief that our country cannot afford it and we will govern for him.</p> <p> Wanting to pay less tax isn't greedy. The countless hard working families whom I meet everywhere I go who talk of how difficult they find it to save money and keep their families together and live on just one income while bringing up children aren't being greedy. </p> <p> They just feel betrayed by a Government that promised no tax increases at all.</p> <p> And I tell them now that the Conservative Party understands their sense of betrayal and we know how difficult high taxes have made their lives and we are on their side - and we will govern for them. </p> <p> All these people are looking to the Conservatives now and they want to know what we're going to do for them.</p> <p> We know what we're going to do for them.</p> <p> We're going to cut fuel tax. Three pence off a litre of petrol. Three pence off a litre of diesel.</p> <p> We're going to restore a married couples allowance - because I believe marriage is the bedrock of a secure and stable society.</p> <p> We're going to bring an end to the era of stealth taxes and start cutting the taxes paid by hard pressed families.</p> <p> And we know how we're going to pay for it too.</p> <p> We're going to make sure billions of pounds in surplus taxes raised by Gordon Brown goes back to taxpayers who earned it.</p> <p> We're going to reform the welfare system so that we stop losing billions of pounds in fraud and so that those who can work must work.</p> <p> We're going to stop wasting money on worthless Government schemes that are only designed to win headlines for Tony Blair.</p> <p> We're going to reduce the number of Ministers, cut the size of the House of Commons, halve the number of political advisers and cut the whole size of Whitehall so that there aren't so many politicians going around dreaming up expensive meddling schemes to interfere in everybody else's lives.</p> <p> Tony Blair may think his made-up numbers about Tory cuts will win him back a few votes. He couldn't be more wrong. People don't believe the phoney statistics and falsehoods he tells about his own policies and so they certainly won't believe the phoney statistics and falsehoods he tells about ours.</p> <p> The British people know we can have lower taxes and better public services if we spend wisely. They know it can be done.</p> <p> And we're going to do it.</p> <p> For we're ready to govern for all the people. </p> <p> We're going to govern for the parents who want their children to get the best chance in life, who want a Government that will deliver on education.</p> <p> Last week I visited the largest comprehensive school in Birmingham. And the reporters said to me - \"There's a grammar school nearby, why didn't you visit that?\"</p> <p> And I said \"I've visited grammar schools and they do a superb job. But our task now is to raise standards for that vast majority of parents and pupils who haven't got a grammar school to choose from.\"</p> <p> So I've been going to the inner city schools and talking to the pupils and the parents and the teachers.</p> <p> I've been hearing the pupils talk about their hopes and their dreams and how determined they are to better themselves:</p> <p> parents talk of how they want the right to choose the best schools for their children but feel that choice is denied to them;</p> <p> teachers talk of how frustrated they are to spend so much time filling in forms and how difficult they find it keeping discipline when the Government tries to stop them excluding troublemakers;</p> <p> head-teachers talk of the money that gets wasted on bureaucracy when it could be spent improving our schools.</p> <p> It's time someone listened to these people. The Conservative Party is listening to these people and I am determined that we will govern for them.</p> <p> All these people are looking to the Conservatives now and they want to know what we're going to do for them.</p> <p> We know what we're going to do for them.</p> <p> We're going to take the money that's spent by politicians and bureaucrats and let the schools spend it instead. \u00a3540 for every pupil.</p> <p> We're going to endow our universities and set them free to be the best in the world.</p> <p> We're going to create Free Schools that can determine their own ethos and decide their own admissions policy and set their own pay policy. </p> <p> We're going to have tougher discipline in our schools because we're going to end the ridiculous situation where schools are penalised by the Government when they exclude pupils and are forced by politicians to take back those who disrupt classrooms. This is a policy that undermines discipline and makes teachers lives impossible and it's going to stop.</p> <p> The British people know these things can be done.</p> <p> And we're going to do them.</p> <p> For we're ready to govern for all the people.</p> <p> We're going to govern for the people who rely on the state pension and the National Health Service and think everyone should share in the growing prosperity of our country.</p> <p> The Government seems confused at why pensioners are angry. But the reason is simple.</p> <p> Pensioners don't like being treated with contempt by people like the Chairman of the Parliamentary Labour Party who said they were all \"racists\".</p> <p> They don't like being talked down to by people like Peter Mandelson who said that they're not worth bothering with because they're not 'aspirational'. </p> <p> I reject this language. Our pensioners should be treated with dignity and respect.</p> <p> And they don't like being treated as charity cases by a Chancellor of the Exchequer who prefers to go on handing out means tested benefits and one off gimmicks because he thinks he knows best.</p> <p> Labour has not governed for them. We will govern for them.</p> <p> All these people are looking to the Conservatives now and they want to know what we're going to do for them.</p> <p> We know what we're going to do for them.</p> <p> We're going to take Gordon Brown's gimmicks and the administrative costs wasted on them and put that money back into the basic state pension. \u00a35.50 more a week for every pensioner; \u00a310 for an older pensioner couple.</p> <p> We're going to match Labour penny for penny on the NHS and sweep away Labour's dogmatic opposition to private provision.</p> <p> We're going to make sure every penny is spent on clinical priorities rather than the political priorities of Labour politicians.</p> <p> We're going to give every young person in the country the chance to have a pension of their own far greater than the current state pension.</p> <p> The British people know these things can be done.</p> <p> And we're going to do them.</p> <p> For we're ready to govern for all the people.</p> <p> We're going to govern for the law abiding people of this country who have sometimes felt there wasn't a politician left prepared to champion their common sense values and instincts.</p> <p> It's time we halted the march of political correctness. </p> <p> Can you believe that Birmingham's Labour Council decided to rename Christmas 'the Winterval'?</p> <p> Can you believe that Education Ministers supported a ban on musical chairs because they think the game encourages aggression?</p> <p> Can you believe that they used Number 10 Downing Street to hold a summit on how many thin and fat people should appear on television?</p> <p> I want all these people who despair of this politically correct idiocy to know that we're going to govern for them.</p> <p> I want all the parents who think schools should respect their values and don't want Section 28 abolished to know that we're going to govern for them.</p> <p> I want all the people who are angry at the way our asylum system is in chaos and just want enforcement of the rules - I want them to know that we're going to govern for them. </p> <p> But nothing angers or frustrates the law abiding people of this country more than the failure of this Government to get a grip on rising crime.</p> <p> Like the group of black teenagers I met in a Lambeth comprehensive four months ago. We got around a table in their classroom, and do you know what they said to me? 'The police have got their hands tied and they've lost it. Crime is rising and we're most likely to be the victims'.</p> <p> These people are looking to the Conservatives now and they want to know what we're going to do for them.</p> <p> We know what we're going to do for them.</p> <p> We're going to restore Labour's cuts in our police force. </p> <p> And we're going to stop tying their hands with red tape and politically correct nonsense. We're going to have less PC and more PCs.</p> <p> We're going to have no more of Labour's early release schemes for rapists and burglars and muggers.</p> <p> We're going to overhaul the law to make sure that it is on the side of the people defending their homes instead of the criminals breaking into those homes. </p> <p> We're going to step up the war against drugs, not surrender to the drug dealers. </p> <p> We're going to make sure that prisoners don't idle around in their cells but do a full working day.</p> <p> We are going to give full force to the common sense instincts of the British people and we're going to win the war against crime. </p> <p> The British people know these things can be done.</p> <p> And we're going to do it.</p> <p> For we're ready to govern for all the people.</p> <p> And we're ready to govern for all parts of the country.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/tories2000/story/0,7369,377944,00.html\">Click here to read remainder of speech</a></p>",
  "<p><strong>Please you tell me more about the fourth Test between West Indies and India at Kingston in April 1976? It looks like a bloodbath! Five Indian batsmen were absent hurt in the second innings. What happened?</strong> asks Dean Ilott from Mexico City</p> <p>The match was played on a recently relaid pitch, which offered unpredictable bounce to the West Indian fast bowlers. Michael Holding and Wayne Daniel were in the super-fast category, while Bernard Julien and Van Holder weren't far behind. India went into the match in good form - they had made 406 runs (for only four wickets) in the final innings to win the previous Test, at Port-of-Spain - still an all-time Test record. But at Kingston two people retired hurt in their first innings of 306. Aunshuman Gaekwad was hit on the left ear and spent two nights in hospital, while Brijesh Patel had to have stitches after being hit in the mouth (remember that these were pre-helmet days). Neither of them played any further part in the match - and neither did Gundappa Viswanath, who was caught off a ball which broke a finger of his right hand. Bishan Bedi, India's captain, declared before he and Bhagwat Chandrasekhar - two of Test cricket's worst batsmen - had to face the music. India's gentle pace attack couldn't take advantage of the pitch, and West Indies made 391. Then India went in again, without the three injured batsmen. They reached 97 for 5 - 12 ahead - but that was it. Bedi said both he and Chandrasekhar had suffered hand injuries while fielding, and were also unable to bat. All 17 members of India's touring party fielded at some stage during the match - and one of the substitutes, Surinder Amarnath, was carted off to hospital during the game for an appendix operation. West Indies won the match by ten wickets, and won the series 2-1. It was the start of their surge to the top of world cricket. Their previous series had ended in a 5-1 humiliation in Australia, but after this West Indies ruled the roost until the end of the 1980s.</p> <p><strong>What are the ten ways you can be out in cricket?</strong> asks Tim Varley</p> <p>Six of them happen regularly (far too regularly if you're me) bowled, caught, hit wicket, leg before wicket (lbw), run out and stumped. Three more are rare enough to get a little section all of their own in the Wisden Almanack - handled the ball, hit the ball twice and obstructing the field. And the tenth method hardly ever happens - Timed Out. That's when the incoming batsman wilfully takes more than two minutes to come to the crease. The only man to have been given out this way in first-class cricket Is Hemulal Yadav of Tripura, during a Ranji Trophy match against Orissa at Cuttack in India in 1997-98. Wisden 1999 says: \"A drinks interval had been called at the fall of Tripura's ninth wicket, during which Yadav sat near the boundary, but the umpires said he made no attempt to come to the crease after the break, and upheld Orissa's appeal.\"</p> <p><strong>Who was the first Pakistan batsman to reach 5000 runs in Test cricket?</strong> asks Paul Bennett</p> <p>It was Zaheer Abbas, the stylish right-hander with the extravagant backlift. He passed 5000 during the first Test against New Zealand at Lahore in November 1984, and finished his Test career shortly afterwards with 5062 runs. Two others have passed 5000 since: Javed Miandad (8832 runs) and Salim Malik (5768). The next one to get there will probably be Inzamam-ul-Haq, who currently has 4504 runs in Tests.</p> <p><strong>I was surprised to discover, from the Australian Wisden, that the highest Test batting average for an Australian is not held by Don Bradman but one AE Trott, who played three Tests in the 1890s and had a batting average of 102. He is also listed as having the best bowling debut, with 8 for 43 against England. He later played for England, and died young in 1914. Can you tell me more about him?</strong> asks Matthew Brown</p> <p>Albert Trott, an attacking right-hand batsman and a medium-pace bowler, did indeed have a remarkable career. Born in Melbourne in 1873, he was called up for the third Test against England at Adelaide in 1894-95, and took 8 for 43, which remains the best bowling analysis on debut by any Test player. His scores of 38*, 72*, 85*, 10 and 0 gave him an average of 102.50. For reasons which remain unclear he was left out of the Australian team which toured England in 1896. It may have been that the captain didn't want to be accused of favouritism - it was Trott's older brother Harry. Albert Trott came to England anyway, and started playing for Middlesex in 1898. He played two Tests for England in South Africa in 1898-99, without much success, but played on at county level until 1910. In 1899, while playing for MCC against the Australians, he became the first - and still the only - batsman to hit a six over the pavilion at Lord's. After his career finished he suffered health problems, and in 1914, still only 41, he shot himself dead.</p> <p><strong>Please could you tell me the result of the last first-class match in Sheffield, which I think was in 1973?</strong> asks Peter Kerry</p> <p>I think you mean the last match at the Bramall Lane ground in Sheffield (Yorkshire played matches at Abbeydale Park, Sheffield, for a few years after 1973). The last match at Bramall Lane, before it was given over entirely to Sheffield United and football, was in August 1973. Appropriately, it was the Roses match, but inappropriately the match was ruined by rain and left drawn. Yorkshire were bowled out for 99 (seamer Peter Lee 6 for 43), Lancashire made 111 (John Sullivan 48*), then Yorkshire reached 114 for 2 (Phil Sharpe 62*). Geoff Boycott made only 9 and 6.</p> <p><strong>I'm an Englishman exiled in New York, and I work with a couple of Aussies.

  "Imperial nationalism is bad because it is imperial, not because it is nationalist. It is worth recalling that most empires have been constructed on behalf of dynasties, religions, or secular ideologies such as Marxism-Leninism. Cultural nationalism, as a rule, is too inward-looking to serve as the basis of an imperial ideology. Nazi Germany is often held up as an example of the evils of nationalism, but Hitler's ideology was a kind of racist transnationalism, which held that all true \"Aryans\" were kin, whether they shared a common language and culture or not. Anyway, imperial nationalisms are greatly outnumbered by anti-imperial nationalisms, for the simple reason that small ethnic nations have enough trouble holding their own without trying to conquer their regions, much less the world. The purpose of most nationalists is nothing more sinister than trying to preserve the identity of a relatively small ethnic and linguistic community by achieving and maintaining independence as a sovereign political community. <p>This is why it is so absurd to blame the world wars of the 20th century on the nationalist movements in the Balkans. Nationalism in the decaying Habsburg empire was the trigger of the first world war, not the cause. The cause of the first world war was Germany's ambition to become the dominant world power by becoming the dominant European power - an ambition which threatened the interests of Russia, France, Britain, and the US - empires all.</p> <p>Instead of blaming nationalism for 20th-century wars which were really caused by imperial rivalries, we should give some credit to the stubborn and defiant particularism of anti-fascist and anti-communist nationalists in Europe and Asia for defeating the transnational tyrannies of National Socialism and communism. Nationalists from France to Poland to Greece battled heroically to stop their countries from being melted down into Hitler's New Order; and nationalists from central Asia to the Baltic republics brought down the Soviet empire when the Soviet elite no longer had the nerve to hold it together by terror. Some of those anti-Nazi and anti-Soviet nationalists were democrats; some were not. But even the partisans and the dissidents who did have democratic values did not want democracy in the abstract. They wanted democracy for their people - the Danes, the Ukrainians, the Lithuanians, the Poles. Thanks in part to their battles for \"narrow\" and \"ethnocentric\" national self-determination, the world was saved from domination by supra-national totalitarianism. Johann Gottfried von Herder wrote in 1791: \"How wonderfully has Nature separated nations, not only by woods and mountains, seas and deserts, rivers and climates, but most particularly by languages, inclinations and characters, [so] that the work of subjugating despotism might be rendered more difficult...\" </p> <p>Critics of nationalism often assume that national sentiment is somehow incompatible with democracy. In fact, the relationship tends to be the other way around. Almost all stable democracies are nation-states, while multinational states tend to be dictatorships. The reason is simple. In a mono-ethnic society, ethnic power is not an issue; whichever party wins in Sweden will be made up of Swedes. That means that there can be political coalitions based on various other aspects of identity - class, or religion, or political ideology. But in a multi-ethnic society, political parties usually coalesce around the main ethnic groups. Each ethnic group is afraid that the others will seize control of the machinery of government. In Belgium, the Flemings worry that the Walloons will be too powerful; in Canada, the Anglo-Canadians and Quebecois eye one another with distrust. At worst, as in Yugoslavia and Lebanon, the competition between ethnic parties escalates into war. </p> <p>Only Tito's dictatorship held the Yugoslav federation together. The Soviet Union broke up along national lines the moment that a degree of democracy was permitted. There are very few stable multi-ethnic democracies. The ones that do exist - such as Switzerland - tend to be based on intricate constitutional arrangements such as elaborate systems of federalism and equally elaborate systems of power-sharing. Political philosophers and Op-Ed columnists can have fun devising intricate power-sharing schemes for a multi-ethnic Bosnia or a multi-ethnic Kosovo. But realistic policymakers have to face the fact that power-sharing systems seldom work. </p> <p>Where a state like Yugoslavia has crumbled because its constituent ethnic nations do not want to live together, it is folly for outsiders to try to force them together in a shotgun marriage - or rather a shotgun remarriage. In such circumstances, it is in the interest of all concerned that the outside powers act as divorce counsellors, seeing to it that the divorce takes place with as little bloodshed as possible. The wisest course may be to turn temporary division into permanent partition, and to recognise formally the existence of new nation-states. The results will not always be fair: some individuals will not be able to return to their homes; some groups will find themselves minorities trapped behind new borders. But in diplomacy as in the rest of life, the perfect is the enemy of the good. The rough justice of partition may be acceptable if it prevents endless warfare or endless peacekeeping. </p> <p>The Balkans is not the only place where there may never be lasting peace or prosperity until borders are redrawn, at least roughly, along national lines. In sub-Saharan Africa, most of the states are artificial creations of British and French colonial administrators. The map of African governments cuts across the map of African ethnic nations. There is no Nigerian or South African nation, any more than there was a Yugoslav or Soviet nation. One reason why so many African states are dictatorships is that force is required to prevent these artificial contraptions from breaking down in civil war among the rival ethnic nations, like the Hutu and Tutsi in Rwanda and Burundi. (Incidentally, one of the unfortunate residues of western racism and imperialism is the tendency to describe the nations of western Europe as nations, the nations of eastern Europe as ethnic groups, and the nations of Africa as tribes.) Any attempt to make political borders correspond with ethnic nations in Africa, as in the Balkans, would be messy and imperfect. But the alternative - preserving the political relics of European colonialism forever at the cost of endless authoritarianism and internecine conflict and the poverty which comes in their wake - is much worse than redrawing a border here and a border there.</p> <p>Needless to say, most of the several thousand ethnic groups in the world are too small to have states of their own - although the example of the Slovenes proves that statehood is possible for very tiny nations. The Sorbs and Wends of Germany will never have their own nation-states, any more than the German-speaking Amish in the US will have theirs. But the fact that every tiny ethnic group does not qualify for statehood does not discredit the desire for independence of substantial ethnic nations like the Kurds.</p> <p>At what point would there be too many countries? Between 1945 and today, the number of UN member states increased from 51 to 188. The addition of a dozen or two dozen more nation-states would not create chaos. At any given time, there are only a few great military and economic powers, and it is on their relations among themselves, not the number of small states, that international order depends.</p> <p>Most nation-states are relatively small, but this need not be a handicap. A small nation-state can take advantage of commercial economies of scale by joining the global market or a trading bloc like the EU or Asean; and it can take advantage of military economies of scale by joining a military alliance like Nato. Because of its political sovereignty, a nation-state, even a small, weak, nation-state, can negotiate the nature of its relations with its trading partners and its military allies. This is something no ethnic minority in a multinational state can ever do.</p> <p>In this connection, it is useful to distinguish internationalism from transnationalism. Internationalism presupposes the existence of distinct nations which interact with one another on a voluntary basis. Transnationalism posits the disappearance of nation-states and their replacement by something else - sub-national tribes, supra-national blocs.</p> <p>While the supposed trend toward transnationalism is a mirage, the growth of internationalism is real. It is more a consequence of the end of the cold war and the division of the countries of the world into rival camps than of the internet or trade treaties. There is no contradiction between the multiplication of nation-states and increasing international integration. Slovenia escaped from its involuntary membership in Yugoslavia, and immediately applied for admission to Nato and the EU. It is an abuse of language to say that when a country joins a military alliance or a trading bloc it is \"surrendering its sovereignty.\" On the contrary, it is exercising its sovereignty, so long as it retains the option to quit the alliance or trading bloc if it so chooses.</p> <p>The globalisation of commerce is an example of internationalism, not transnationalism. A Norwegian may order a product from Thailand over the internet. But he is still a Norwegian; the Norwegian government can tax and conscript him, the Thai government cannot; and it is the Norwegian government, not the Thai government, which provides for his health care and his state pension out of taxes levied on his fellow Norwegians. Globalisation is reshaping nations - but it is not replacing them.</p> <p>All of this raises an interesting question. If the nation-state is alive and well, and if nationalism is by no means the evil that it is made out to be, then why is there so much loathing of nationalism and propaganda in favour of various kinds of supra-national systems of world order? One reason is obvious: most of the states in Africa, and the middle east, and much of Asia, are non-national entities whose borders are threatened by nationalist movements. The UN should really be called the United Regimes, inasmuch as many of the members of the general assembly are multinational states held together by repression. For obvious reasons, many of these governments would prefer that self-determination be sacrificed to the sanctity of inherited borders, no matter how absurd and anachronistic the borders are. But this doesn't explain the intense hostility to nationalism in the western media, and all of the addled talk about the nation-state withering away. </p> <p>Every segment of the political spectrum in the west - left, centre and right - has its own fantasy version of cosmopolis. The socialist left, for almost two centuries, has hoped, in the face of all evidence, that international class loyalties will eventually prevail over inter-class national loyalties. Libertarians hope to reduce countries to nothing more than postcodes in the free global market. The influence of Protestant millenarianism and evangelism can be seen on British liberal internationalism and American Wilsonian liberalism. There is even a kind of conservative internationalism - although it is that of reactionary traditionalists such as John Lukacs, nostalgic for a pre-national, aristocratic European Christendom, rather than of the populists and nationalists who dominate the right in most western countries. (Given that most of literate, civilised humanity lived for most of history under non-national empires - some, like China and Rome, of long duration and lasting cultural importance - it is surprising that there is not more of this kind of conservative nostalgia for imperial civilisations.)</p> <p>Whether the chattering classes like it or not, a century from now there will be more nation-states in the world, and fewer multinational states. Nation-states like Japan and Russia and China and the US and Germany and India and Brazil, in some form, will still be here. But many if not most of today's multinational states will have vanished from the map. The UK may give way to a federation of the nation-states of England, Scotland, Ireland and Wales. Australia and New Zealand will be sovereign republics. Canada is unlikely to survive the 21st century; the only question is whether the English-speaking provinces join the US or stragggle along on their own, when the federation dissolves. Indonesia and Malaysia may be replaced on the map by a number of new, smaller countries. Not all of the nationalism of the century ahead will be disintegrative. A Greater Albania and a Kurdistan might be cobbled together. The inevitable overthrow of the remaining monarchies in the middle east may produce the amalgamation of portions of the Arab world, a region where the present borders were drawn up generations ago by the colonial bureaucrats of Britain and France. Not every nation will obtain its state: China is unlikely to free Tibet; and India is unlikely to consent to a Sikh nation-state. Whether Africa progresses or continues to decay depends in large part on whether the international community permits genuine nation-states to be formed from the wreckage of the post-colonial regimes. In some cases, such as the break-up of the UK, these changes might occur without bloodshed; in other cases they may be accompanied by immense suffering, and may even trigger conflicts among rival great powers. </p> <p>A case can be made that, on the whole, the good which has come with replacing multinational dynastic empires and dictatorships with nation-states which at least have a chance to become stable liberal democracies, has outweighed the bad which often accompanies the break-up of non-national states. In any event, the future seems clear. The 19th century was a century of nationalism. The 20th century was also a century of nationalism. In all likelihood, the 21st century will be a century of nationalism as well. </p> <p>Michael Lind is senior fellow at the New America Foundation in Washington DC and writes fiction, non-fiction and poetry. </p> <p>\u00a9 Prospect 2000</p>",
  "William Hague was last night left struggling to get his party conference back on his \"ready for government\" message after Ann Widdecombe's latest hardline initiatives against minor drug offences met widespread criticism - even from the police. <p>With the Police Superintendents' Association calling the plans impractical and unenforceable, the Conservative leader was forced to stop polishing his keynote speech, to be delivered in Bournemouth today, in order to defend the shadow home secretary's pro posal for \u00a3100 \"fixed penalty\" fines for possession of cannabis. </p> <p>Although Mr Hague was given advance warning of Miss Widdecombe's plan to tackle the issue of drugs, his aides were furious to learn of the details only in the early editions of yesterday's newspapers. The Tory leader was left with no option but to publicly back her. </p> <p>Last night he found himself on TV being asked whether - in addition to his 14 pints in a day as a teenager - he had ever smoked marijuana, like up to 42% of young people between 16 and 29. \"No, I did not,\" he said. </p> <p>Insisting that US experience has shown what can be achieved, Mr Hague told Channel 4 News: \"We have to take the fight against drugs further down the [supply] chain...we want to talk to the police about how to do it. The police have to fight harder against drugs, not surrender.\" </p> <p>Miss Widdecombe defended her proposals, which would also mean longer sentences for dealers. But she conceded that her policy would need 2,500 extra police and a similar number of extra prison places. </p> <p>Not only did the Widdecombe package come as a surprise to senior colleagues, including the shadow chancel lor, Michael Portillo - whose approval would be needed for the cost of extra police and prisons required - but its tone was at odds with the socially tolerant and inclusive \"one nation\" tone which Hague allies have been striking all week. </p> <p>Buoyed by rising opinion polls and Labour's problems, the Tories have been enjoying what Mr Hague will today call their \"biggest, most upbeat and successful conference for years\" watched by voters who, the Tory leader believes, think he is fit to be prime minister. </p> <p>He plans to open up a \"second front\" - promising that a Hague government would direct much of its energy to im proving the lives of the \"least fortunate\" people on bleak estates in inner cities, the old, poor and those scarred by drugs. </p> <p>He will re-emphasise the inclusive nature of his campaign strategy by seeking to reach beyond the core Conservative vote - those people enthused by his message on tax, crime, asylum and Europe - to \"govern for all hard-working families...for people of every community and background.\" </p> <p>Mr Hague will deride New Labour - \"never a philosophy, it was a fashion, and nothing is more unfashionable than fashion which is out of fashion. We saw them last week, divided, arrogant and out of touch. What a bunch they are, this soap opera of a government.\" </p> <p>He will say voters \"know that not only has Labour failed to deliver, but it's never going to deliver. They want to know what the alternative will be. They look at us, they want to know if we are ready, they want to know if they can trust us.\"</p>",
  "The police last night took the shine off from Ann Widdecombe's conference triumph by making quite clear they could not support her plan for automatic \u00a3100 for anyone possessing even the smallest amount of cannabis. <p>Her promise that a future Conservative government would introduce a zero tolerance for possession of drugs wowed the Tory party's law and order activists who cheered and sang 'Happy Birthday' as William Hague toasted her 53rd birthday with champagne. </p> <p>Miss Widdecombe's plans to give the police the power to order a bloodtest from anybody they suspect has been using drugs has broken a seven year bipartisan approach which targeted police efforts on the most dangerous drugs. </p> <p>The Police Superintendents' Association were the most openly critical: \"We would not support this proposal,\" said their spokesman, Peter Williams. \"The policy is not to punish people for possession of drugs but to try to divert them from drugs.\" The other police organisations representing chief constables and rank and file police officers made clear they had not been consulted before the Conservative plan was finalised. </p> <p>Miss Widdecombe was also implicitly criticised from within her own party. The former Tory leader of the Lords, Lord Cranborne, called for cannabis to be legalised and told the BBC: \"You play into the hands of criminals if you make the law into an ass when nobody wants to obey the law and, indeed, regards breaking the law as a bit of a challenge.\" </p> <p>But such reservations did not trouble the party faithful who rewarded Miss Widdecombe's proposed drugs clampdown and pledges to detain all asylum seekers and make prisoners work a full day with the kind of reception that they use to reserve for \"hanging and flogging\" home secretaries. </p> <p>She made clear her new drugs policy came straight from the policy book of the New York Republican, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani: \"Although we can't replicate exactly what I saw in New York, we can learn the lessons of tackling crime head on and not conceding a centimetre to the criminals. So today, I can announce a new policy. A policy that means no quarter for those who trade is dealing in human misery, despair and even death.\" </p> <p>She made clear that a first time offender - schoolchildren included - would face a minimum fixed penalty - not an on-the-spot fine - of at least \u00a3100. Second time offenders would be taken straight to court for heavier punishment. </p> <p>Miss Widdecombe also confirmed Tory plans to put all new asylum seekers into detention camps and promised \"we will automatically house all new applicants in secure reception centres.\" </p> <p>She added: \"It's extraordinary, but Labour call that racist. Yet the biggest loser in the system is the genuine refugee who comes to this country with not only a legal but a moral case for a safe haven, and finds himself clogged up in a queue which has hit more than 100,000 cases - double what Labour inherited.\" </p> <p>Real refugees, under her plan, would be given access to education for their children, and language and social services support.</p>",
  "In a smoky first-floor room of the Hotel Astoria in Budapest, journalists strained to hear the words of Dragoljub Stosic crackling out of loudspeakers. <p>\"We can speak of an amazing avalanche of protests,\" said Mr Stosic, president of the United Free Trade Unions of Yugoslavia. \"It cannot be stopped now.\" </p> <p>That was Monday evening. At dawn on Tuesday Mr Stosic was arrested in Belgrade as he tried to organise a strike by bus drivers. </p> <p>The international press centre for the Yugoslav elections, which has been operating in the Astoria since September 20, is packed with journalists unable to get a visa to enter Yugoslavia, or just interested in the drama unfolding three hours' drive away </p> <p>The centre, which was set up by the Hungarian International Press Association and the independent B2-92 radio station in Belgrade, is partly funded by the Open Society Institute in New York, and run by the Hungarian-born financier George Soros. </p> <p>The hotel has a chequered history. Just across from the Jewish ghetto, in 1944 it served as Gestapo headquarters. During the 1956 revolution, Oxford undergraduates staying at the Astoria laid the hotel's best dinner plates across the junction outside, and covered them with soil to look like landmines - allegedly delaying the Soviet advance by several hours. </p> <p>An occasional visitor to the press centre is Alexander Tijanic, a former Serbian information minister. He left Serbia soon after his friend Slavko Curuvija, editor of the daily Dnevni Telegraf, was murdered in Belgrade in April last year. Since then he has lived in Bosnia and Italy. </p> <p>\"Milosevic is a dinosaur, and [Russian president Vladimir] Putin is too clever to back a dinosaur,\" Mr Tijanic told a discussion at the centre this week. \"If there is blood on the streets of Serbia thanks to Russian support for Milosevic, it will be the end of the long friendship between Serbs and Russians.\" </p> <p>Elsewhere in Budapest, local people notice more Serbo-Croat being spoken than at any time since the Nato bombing of Yugoslavia last year. </p> <p>The city is playing host to tourists and businessmen - some close to President Milosevic, some against him. Many have bank accounts here. Some send their children to the American school, some to the Serbian. </p> <p>Poorest of all are the draft dodgers and deserters from the Yugoslav army, about 1,000 in all, stranded between the west and the Balkans. Most say they will never go home, no matter what the outcome of the present struggle. </p> <p>\"In my community my friends and I will always be traitors,\" said Vladimir Pavlovic, from Lazarevac in central Serbia, who follows events in Yugoslavia from an internet cafe. \"I suffered too much in that country.\"</p>",
  "Rosie Douglas, who has died aged 58, became prime minister of the eastern Caribbean island of Dominica only eight months ago, having spent much of his political life travelling the world in support of liberation struggles, the black diaspora and African unity. And it was that international dimension which defined him, a perspective forged during his student days in Canada, where he was jailed following the smashing of a university computer during \"black power\" protests. <p>In a sense, Douglas came to power a generation too late, for he represented the now lost spirit of 1970s Caribbean radical movements. Yet Dominicans who celebrated Douglas's electoral win last January felt that he could somehow re-invent that legacy. They also hoped - as did Douglas himself - that his international connections would bring benefits to his banana-dependent island. </p> <p>His background was not typical of Caribbean leaders of his generation. He was neither from the light-skinned elite nor the landless poor. His father had been a rich landowner, albeit from humble beginnings, who had made his money in Curacao'soil fields. The Douglas coconut estate was large and bountiful, in the north of the island, close to the second town, Portsmouth. </p> <p>The second eldest of 16 children, Rosie was christened Roosevelt (there were other brothers named Eisenhower and Adenauer). He went to school in the capital, Roseau, before applying to study at university in Canada. Impatient of the long wait to receive a visa, he rang up the office of the Canadian prime minister, John Diefenbaker. The story goes that Diefenbaker was so impressed that he invited Douglas to meet him. So it was that Douglas's first political act in the dominion was to join the Canadian Young Conservatives. </p> <p>But then everything changed. Douglas experienced racism. His education in Roseau had been colonial; he had been privileged. In Canada, he heard Martin Luther King speak and met black power leaders such as Stokeley Carmichael - who campaigned for Douglas in the 1990 Dominica election. Meanwhile Douglas studied agriculture at Ontario Agricultural College, and political science and economy at Sir George Williams University, Montreal. </p> <p>Then, in 1969, by then a McGill University post-graduate, he led an anti-racism sit-in at Sir George Williams which led to the occupation of the computer centre and its destruction when police broke up the protest. Charged with arson, Douglas served 18 months in prison. When he was released, to be deported, as he would tell, in handcuffs and leg-irons, he said he would only return as \"prime minister of my own country\". </p> <p>Back in Dominica, he began to develop that balancing act of participation both in domestic politics and on the wider, grander stage that characterised the rest of his life. He formed the short-lived Political Independence Committee, before becoming a senator during a turbulent period after independence in 1978. But he was sacked for inviting Cuban troops to Dominica after the devastations of Hurricane David in 1979; the United States had demanded the action in return for relief aid. </p> <p>Douglas had begun to build on his old student contacts. He secured scholarships for Dominicans to Cuba and the Soviet Union. He made links with Colonel Gaddafi, and the Libyan leader's Little Green Book began to appear in Dominica, much to the alarm of rightwingers. Douglas saw Gaddafi as being able to offer financial support to liberation movements and became a key figure in the somewhat ill-defined Mataba, a Tripoli-based organisation, which offered aid, training and education to Africans. </p> <p>Restless in his small island, Douglas went trouble-shooting in the interests of the Caribbean and the black diaspora. Active in the Socialist International, he also attended Sinn Fein's annual conference for many years. Despite his Libyan connections, he was close to the British Labour party - he was at its annual conference last week and the late Bernie Grant, the Labour MP, was a close friend. </p> <p>Douglas became an MP in 1985, but he only became leader of the Dominica Labour party in 1992, after the death of his brother, Michael. His party lost the 1995 election and there was the feeling that his absences - his critics said he was always \"up in the air\" - diverted his energies. Nevertheless, this year, in January's election, he became prime minister in a coalition administration. At the opening of the new parliament, the guest list included Martin Luther King III. It was a glittering reflection of Douglas's long years in the service of black solidarity. Dominica had never seen anything like it. </p> <p>Desperate to attract investors, he encouraged an enterprise culture and was keen to develop closer relations with the neighbouring French islands of Martinique and Guadeloupe, and thus with Europe. His oratory was inspiring, yet some felt disheartened by his inability to plan and pay attention to domestic details. Others were also disappointed at his pro-Japan line on whaling. </p> <p>He remained close to the people. Unstuffy, speaking in Creole, patient and big-hearted, he would hear their troubles at any time at his two-storey red and white painted house in the middle of Portsmouth. He was proud, he said, to live \"in the ghetto\". And in the mornings, he jogged with the town youth or played basketball, while the official car sent to take him to his office had to wait. Yet to stay at home was not his way; only by globe-trotting, he said, would business come to Dominica. </p> <p>He is survived by his mother Bernadette, three sons, Tiyani, Cabral and Kim, and one daughter, Deborah. </p> <p>\u0095 Roosevelt (Rosie) Bertrand Douglas, politician, born October 15 1941; died October 1 2000</p>",
  "<p>Why do I picture Tostig as being sandy, small and rather short-changed in the neck department? </p> <p>The Norman Conquest turns out to be all Tostig's fault. Simon Schama's exhilarating <strong> A History Of Britain </strong> (BBC 2) has now reached 1066 and all that when \"History comes at you with a rush, a truckload of trouble.\" Ganging up with the Viking Harald Hardrada, who sounds like rocks on a corrugated iron roof and looked like a large lump of Norway that had come adrift, Tostig invaded the north, forcing his brother, King Harold, to take his eye off William, who was pawing the ground in the south. </p> <p>Harold virtually ran up the length of England and met the invaders at Stamford Bridge, where he reduced Tostig's already short stature by a head. Here's a taste of Schama in action: \"What they saw on the banks of the river Derwent was not a forlorn group of hostages but a massive army, their weapons glittering like sheets of ice, as the Viking bard put it.

If a legend has poetic truth, in it goes, like the grieving image of Edith Swan-neck, Harold's lover, walking through heaps of corpses to identify the dead king by marks on his body known only to her.

God, that had to hurt!\" If there is any truth in Dear's theory, then OJ is halfway to a hero. </p> <p>Just when you are thinking \"OK, it's Jason. Can I go now?\" it veered off on quite another tack, the miasmic underworld of cocaine and contract killing. A drug dealer now doing 20 years (\"with the bad and the baddest\") for armed robbery claimed to have been offered $50,000 by a shadowy \"friend of OJ\" to kill Nicole - and refused. </p> <p>The badly bitten LAPD shies away from the whole mess but, until it is cleared up, it will attract flies. </p> <p> <strong> The Dream Academy </strong> (BBC 1) followed four students of the Italia Conti theatre school (\"Very, very gently this afternoon we start humming.\") Ben has a fine voice and can command a loyal coachload of Sunderland supporters when he appears in the West End.

Blokes come up and ask you how to fit loft insulation.\") She was, much to her surprise, chosen to give a belting rendition of \"Oom pah pah\" from Oliver - in St Paul's of all places. \"Thank God it's over,\" groaned Georgia, as heartfelt a prayer as ever Paul's heard.</p>",
  "It is not simple for us, nor is it simple for the Palestinians, to live one next to the other, and at times, one within the other. The land at our disposal is very small, distinguished more by borders than space. <p>Our religion too is different. Despite our all being the sons of Abraham there is a big difference between the pronunciations of Moses and those of Mohammed. Our histories are also distinctly unlike. Independence did not figure in Palestinian history until the Oslo accords. And the refugee tragedy became part of it as a result of the war. Jewish history, severed from its land for 2,000 years, recorded the Holocaust, a tragedy the magnitude of which has never been witnessed. </p> <p>This great divide cannot be bridged by turning the clock back. Going backwards is a Sisyphean endeavour. The past cannot be mended, nor is it possible to agree on when the past actually starts: 50 years ago, 100 years ago, 1,400 years ago or maybe even 4,000 years ago. We shall never succeed in reaching an agreement on how far back we must go. </p> <p>Five times Israel had to face outside attacks. The wars did not solve anything - neither for those that triumphed nor for those that were defeated. Both sides paid a high price in human life, loss of time and wasted opportunity. I believe that today all concerned are aware that the price of a sixth war will be even higher, and will prove to be an even greater exercise in futility. </p> <p>What has not been achieved in battle has been accomplished around the negotiating table. Egypt has regained all its land, including the oil fields along the Suez canal and, in exchange, Israel secured formal peace. Jordan, too,' regained all its land and its water, and peace was again procured. Israel withdrew from Lebanon according to the UN resolution, and with no political intervention in Lebanon's affairs. </p> <p>Terror did not bear fruit. In one of my conversations with Yasser Arafat, he said: \"Look at what you did to me. I was one of the most popular figures amidst my people, and its youth. Today, the young tear my picture to shreds, and all on account of the Oslo accords.\" </p> <p>I replied: \"You stood at the head of the Palestinian people for over 30 years. Prior to that, the mufti of Jerusalem led the Palestinian people, also for 30 years. Both of you turned your backs on Israel. You refused to engage in a dialogue with it. You exercised terror. You dispersed threats. It can't be denied that you were both very popular. But you brought catastrophe on your people. Refugee camps came into being, people were uprooted, the economy lagged behind and you created fathomless sadness. Your popularity might be tarnished, but now you have conferred on your people the gift of a nation in the making. Assuming responsibility for the territories in which they live has led to a well-defined political framework, economic development and a fair dialogue. Those that rip your picture today will be grateful for your undertaking tomorrow.\" </p> <p>Not only is it pointless to return to the days of wars and terror, it is unfeasible. Since the end of the cold war there has been no one to fund conflicts in the Middle East.Russia is no longer prepared to provide arms and costly support. Without backing, it is hard to mobilise the required arms and money for war. Nor is it possible to return to the situation in which terror prevailed. To engage in terror a few speeches are needed to fan the flames, and a small number of terrorists to kill innocent citizens, to make headlines. </p> <p>Nowadays, the PLO leader, and the PLO itself, assume a completely different kind of responsibility. The Palestinian Authority comprises an organisation that counts 120,000 employees (including policemen and teachers) and their salaries must be ensured. Economic development is dependent on relations with Europe, the US and Israel. If terror does resume, it will undermine Palestinian interests. </p> <p>For its part, Israel has no wish to return to Gaza or Nablus or Jericho. Its sons will never again serve as a target for stone-throwers and bullets, a focal point for hate or an obstacle to economic development. We withdrew from all these places for moral motives. We did not shed slavery in Egypt to create a masters' domain in our country. We shall not revert to ruling the Palestinian people. There is no other option, even in the wake of the bullets and the burning accusations voiced on both sides, than for these parties to return to the negotiating table. </p> <p>Today the mission seems impossible. But the situation in Europe in 1944 also seemed impossible. In the space of the short period between 1914 and 1945 Europe suffered two bloody wars. Over 50m people lost their lives and many others lost eyes, hands, legs, their future and their families. The tide of hate rose, and the bloodshed of Europe's history seemed to bode ill for any change. But out of the ashes of war arose the EU, overcoming all the hurdles of the past, free of war for over 50 years and now enjoying tremendous economic prosperity. </p> <p> Europe moved from its agrarian and industrial past into an era of science and technology, in which borders suddenly lost their relevance, hate took on the appearance of excess baggage and cooperation became as important as air. This has to happen in the Middle East as well. Diplomatic peace alone cannot contain the arsenal of hate and recriminations of the past. Only economic peace will expose all peoples to the potential of the future. </p> <p>What we are witnessing in the Middle East is not only a religious confrontation. Or a historical contest. Or a fight for territories. It is a clash between two different ages in history: the agrarian era that gives land priority, and the scientific era that provides all peoples with the opportunity to gain information (an opportunity that stems from the force of knowledge rather than the force of arms). This information must be acquired, not conquered. </p> <p>Europe went through a period of mod ernisation. The Middle East must go through a similar period. Despite differences in our religions, and the intense controversy over the control of holy sites, territorial compromises need to be made even in the absence of religious concessions. Time must be allowed to take its course. We must put into effect all that has been agreed upon and reach an accord on everything that can be conceded. (We have already reached many important agreements - in Camp David territorial partition, marking of borders, the future of the settlements, defence arrangements and even an independent Palestinian state). Moreover, negotiations must continue on points still being debated (including the Temple Mount). After all, no side can impose a solution unacceptable to the other. And if no mutual agreement is found today, we must wait whatever time it takes to reach one. </p> <p>I know that negotiations do not only constitute a bargaining process, but also serve as fertile ground for creativity. And what seems to be unattainable today may be resolved tomorrow by means of a new notion, creative thinking. We have already made many comprises. We should refrain from placing at our political focal point only those subjects for which a solution has not been found. We might well hit on constructive ideas, no less than on destructive strategies. I heard a trainer say to the youngsters who took part in the cross-Kinneret (Sea of Galilee) competition: \"If you reach the half-way point across the Kinneret, and feel tired, do not turn back. With the same energy you will make it to the finishing line on the opposite shore.\" </p> <p>\u0095 Shimon Peres is a former prime minister of Israel and currently minister for regional cooperation </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:comment@theguardian.com\">comment@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "The most notorious of East Timor's militia leaders was arrested yesterday on suspicion of being involved in the sacking of a UN refugee agency office in West Timor last month during which three members of staff were hacked to death. <p>The national police chief, General Suroyo Bimantoro, accused Eurico Guterres of refusing to hand over weapons and instructing hundreds of his men to take back guns they had surrendered to the police in the town of Atambua, near the border with East Timor. </p> <p>The move coincides with UN reports that the militias' grip on the approximately 130,000 East Timorese refugees in West Timor is starting to weaken in some camps and that hundreds of refugees have returned to their homeland in the last couple of weeks. </p> <p>Mr Guterres was picked up at a Jakarta hotel and questioned for more than seven hours at the police headquarters. His lawyer, Suhardi Sumomulyono, said the arrest was not legal because the officers had no warrant and the charges were extremely unclear. If convicted, his client faces six years imprisonment. </p> <p>A police senior superintendent, Saleh Saaf, said: \"Eurico Guterres was arrested after there was enough evidence for him to become a suspect in the destruction and burning of the UNHCR office in Atambua.\" </p> <p>He did not say if Mr Guterres was also suspected of the murder of the three employees of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees. </p> <p>Gen Bimantoro said Mr Guterres's detention was not linked to his being named earlier this week as a suspect for atrocities committed in East Timor last year. \"The East Timor investigation is still on-going,\" he said. </p> <p>Since the UNHCR murders Indonesia has come under increasing international pressure to deal with the militias. All the international aid agencies have withdrawn from West Timor and are refusing to return until those responsible for the aid workers' deaths have been detained, the militias disarmed and disbanded and law and order restored, a spokesman for the UNHCR, Peter Kessler, said. </p> <p>He said Mr Guterres's arrest was \"a step forward\", but added: \"Right now we're only seeing baby steps [from the Indonesian authorities]. We have a long way to go before the refugees can be considered free and in a position to make up their own minds whether to return to East Timor.\" </p> <p>The United States, Britain and the World Bank have threatened to suspend aid to Jakarta if the problems in West Timor are not resolved in the next few months. </p> <p>Jakarta's attempts to disarm the militias, which want East Timor returned to Indonesian rule, have so far proved a relative failure. Only a few dozen rifles and several hundred homemade firearms have been recovered. </p> <p>Most of their weapons were given to them by the Indonesian military last year when they were trying to destabilise East Timor in the run-up to the self-determination referendum, which was won overwhelmingly by the independence side. It was after this vote that the militias rampaged through East Timor and drove more than 270,000 people into West Timor. </p> <p>Mr Kessler said that the increasing number returning in the past few weeks showed that the militias' grip was slackening in some areas. </p> <p>\"In some areas the militias have withdrawn and the refugees are starting to pack up,\" he said. \"In other areas they [the militias] are still taking roll calls every week and in some camps every day. They are forbidding movement, even to go shopping for food.\"</p>",
  "Party conferences have become the politician's haven of last resort. They're the only place a modern leader can be assured that most of his audience believe what he is saying. Inside the halls at Bournemouth and Brighton, there's been a lot of passion. The glow of mutual pleasure at advancing a common project has, despite argumentative reality intruding on Labour's affairs, scarcely ever cooled. Talking to each other, leader and party share a presumption of belief. There is very little doubt or cynicism. The audience actually wants to believe what it is told. <p>Outside, the experience of leaders is completely different, and seems to get more so with every passing year. Outside, almost nobody is listening, hearing or believing. Both anecdote and opinion polls tell politicians that they've never been less trusted. They struggle to get through. The latest signals from the BBC only confirm their plight. The context they must live with is one where both main television channels now plan to slot their main news bulletins at the identical near-bedtime hour, and Panorama, the BBC's prime contribution to public affairs journalism, is sunk into the graveyard. </p> <p>This deepening scorn for politicians and their work coincides with other developments - which may be no accident. The audience in the conference hall is supposed to be less important than the other one. It has, after all, fewer votes. The parties' efforts to reach it, soothe it and satisfy it get ever more sophisticated. They spend vast resources on advice about how to reach out. Every backdrop, every lighting colour-change, every floor-speaker is choreographed in the hope of maximising the nationwide audience. But this audience, if it's there at all, registers indifference or rejection. </p> <p>In much the same spirit are most convictions muted. That's what the Tories were instructed to do this year: minimise their extremism, soften their image. Yet still the deficit, between the conference and the country, continues, because the politicians don't know how to handle the real problem. The real problem is not disagreement so much as general disbelief. </p> <p>The Tories did quite well at softening themselves. They showed how easily words could do the trick. Pledge yourself to a long-dead label and lo!, you set the terms of the reporting and the images the headlines produce. One Nation is a phrase that did once mean something. Fifty years ago, when the Disraelian formula was reclaimed by progressive MPs trying to make their way in a class-bound Tory party, it denoted a challenge to the fustian reactionaries then in charge. Now its meaning has become degraded. Everyone is as much for One Nation as they are for motherhood. Purloined by the right, to proclaim the party's togetherness, the imagery of this soft idea was projected this week with considerable discipline. </p> <p>There were a few hardline gestures. Ann Widdecombe gave conference a lot of pleasure on druggies and asylum seekers. Grammar schools and assisted places are pledged to come back. No-one spoke of Europe with other than contemptuous aggression. But if One Nation means emphasising the collective good, we heard plenty of it. There's suddenly an inner-city policy that is the purest milk of Heseltine; an education policy where the leader pledges his preference for state schooling; a health policy with the NHS avowedly at the heart of it; and even a Widdecombe utterance urging that prison be regarded as a place of reform not merely punishment. Wheel on John Major to give his imprimatur to the new inclusiveness, and the re-branding of this party, as being in touch with the same world Tony Blair appeals to, seems to be well advanced. </p> <p>But who will believe it? Who believes anything they hear, these days? Consider the credibility of Michael Portillo, the acme of re-branding. Here's the man in charge of the policy where there really is an irreducible difference with the other side, and he's not prepared to come up front with it. Instead he gives us the performance of the perfect postmodern Conservative, a journey round his semi-repentant psyche, rather than an honest tour of the programmes he would cut in order to accommodate the taxes he wants to get rid of. Empathy not candour is the watchword. These people, now that they think they have an outside chance of winning the election, are as disingenuous as the Blairism they have spent so much of the week biliously condemning. </p> <p>They are, in other words, trapped in the system of disbelief. They are part of it. All oppositions need an audience that believes they can change the world, but the Tories have yet to find it: not so much because most people disagree with them as because the party has caught the modern disease - being more interested in branding than in substance. The electorate's cynicism gets more armour-plated every year, and stitched-together One Nationism will not penetrate it. </p> <p>This is partly a Tory failure. The nation of cynics is observant. It sees a party that has few policies worked out in coherent detail. Mr Hague's overnight promise to better anything Labour does for pensioners was a naked piece of opportunism. Pensioners have every reason to be wary. Likewise, the whole electorate can only regard the inner-city lunge in the same spirit as Hague's impetuous commitments to accelerate health spending and reduce fuel taxes. They look like pledges for the moment, proving that politicians can do anything with figures. The soft-soaping self-presentation at the conference only makes people wonder why they are being got at. </p> <p>For behind the Tory failure is this deeper crisis of democratic politics: the fact that, outside the political world, most people neither like nor trust nor even take much interest in what politicians do. Francis Maude, in a speech to the Bow Group, expressed a timely anxiety about it. The eruption of the fuel protesters last month was, he thought, the latest symptom \"prompted by a sense that the politicians had in some really profound way broken the covenant of trust with the people\". Reaching for some kind of answer and a clean-sheet break with the past, Mr Maude suggested that \"relentless honesty\" would be made the first hallmark of a new Conservative government. </p> <p>I don't think Tony Blair, at his own party conference, did much to cure the disease of disbelief. He rallied the party, but in the country his poll ratings continue to lurch. Trust has departed his scene. So it will be, at a lower level, with the party that now pledges to be, above all, honest. \"Give me honesty, but not just yet\", it prefers to say, as it prevaricates about spending cuts and blatantly dissembles on how far it intends to disengage from the European Union. It successfully put on a new display this week, instructing the party faithful to moderate their instincts. This was supposed to broaden its base. What it probably did instead was reduce still further people's belief that they know what any politician really means. </p> <p> <a href=\"mailto:hugoyoung@compuserve.com\">hugoyoung@compuserve.com</a></p>",

  "Mr Fox, whose two-day visit to Britain includes talks - mainly on trade - with Tony Blair this afternoon, has already taken his message to the United States, Canada, several countries in South and central America and, earlier this week, to Paris, Madrid, Berlin and Brussels. <p>He has embraced the role of modern Mexico's first president-elect from an opposition party - the conservative National Action party - with the energy and rock solid self-belief that kept him going through years of campaigning before his July election victory. </p> <p>\"You can already feel the transformation, there is a huge amount of positive energy, and the desire to get down to work and build a great nation,\" he said before he left Mexico. </p> <p> \"We want the Europeans to know that Mexico is now a true democracy, that the corruption and the insecurity is over, and that there is a government that is positive about investment.\" </p> <p>A Jesuit-educated former Coca-Cola executive and former rancher, Mr Fox defeated the Institutional Revolutionary party (PRI) after three years of sustained campaigning, chipping away at the widely held assumption that, however unpopular the 71-year regime might be, it could never lose the presidency. </p> <p>Now he is under pressure to shatter another two deeply held Mexican beliefs: that politicians never keep their promises and that power corrupts. </p> <p>\"I feel the enormous weight of peoples' expectations on my shoulders, but I am not going to run away, it doesn't frighten me,\" he said at his Mexico City headquarters, as if reciting a daily mantra. </p> <p>But governing successfully without a legislative majority, and attempting to transform a country of 100m people riddled with corruption, eaten away by poverty, and harbouring a myriad simmering conflicts will require more than determination. </p> <p>It will require all the political capital Mr Fox can muster, which is why his frenetic activity in the five months between being elected and taking office on December 1 owes as much to his need to keep the electoral feelgood factor going as it does to the nuts and bolts issues of the transition. </p> <p>Mr Fox's immediate focus is on eliminating high-level corruption and reducing violent crime. </p> <p>He admitted that reducing poverty would take longer, but insisted that peace in the troubled southern state of Chiapas could come as soon as the Zapatista rebel leader, Subcomandante Marcos, wakes up to the fact that a genuinely democratic government is now in power. </p> <p>Such upbeat talk of a post-PRI Mexican miracle has been aided by the outgoing president Ernesto Zedillo's determination to leave office gracefully.This has won him both praise as a statesman and howls of \"traitor\" from members of his party as it divides itself in a tug-of-war for its declining power base. </p> <p>\"The PRI leaves behind corruption, violence, poverty, backwardness, but on the other hand the economy is doing well and we have economic and political stability,\" Mr Fox said. </p> <p>He admitted that there would be resistance to the political clean-up and progressive modernisation he had promised, mainly from organised crime, the drug cartels and the most corrupt elements in the PRI, who see their interests affected, but he insisted that he would \"do battle\" against them. </p> <p>There are creeping signs that the honeymoon is already losing its shine. </p> <p>The revelation that senior advisers are already being paid salaries equivalent to government ministers lies uneasily with Mr Fox's promises of an upright political morality. </p> <p>There are also rumours that the transition team is riddled with backbiting and that there is a delicate relationship between the press and Mr Fox's spokeswoman, Martha Sahagun, in part sparked by speculation that they are about to get married. </p> <p>\"Now he is beginning to have to face the real Mexico, and the real Mexico is full of contradictions, even within his own supporters,\" the political analyst Alfonso Zarate said.</p>",
  "The United Nations is being heavily criticised for picking a new occupant for one of its most important international posts in secret. <p>The post of UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), the head of an agency which works with 22m refugees throughout the world, is due to be filled by the end of the month. </p> <p>The UN secretary general, Kofi Annan, was in Geneva this week for discussions with the UNHCR executive about the position. </p> <p>But the International Council of Voluntary Organisations (ICVO), which represents most of the non-governmental aid organisations, is critical of the secrecy. </p> <p>Frances Stevenson, head of programmes for M\u00e9decins sans Fronti\u00e8res, a member of the ICVO, said yesterday: \"There is no transparency at all. It is not clear who is being considered. </p> <p>She said: \"Like any democracy, we should know who the candidates are and there should be a public arena to allow debate rather than have it done behind closed doors.\" </p> <p>The ICVO, in an attempt to open up the process, wrote to various people mentioned as candidates, asking them to provide \"manifestos\". </p> <p>The results, published in the latest issue of its magazine Talk Back, are mixed. </p> <p>Some candidates refused to answer and others gave only sketchy details. </p> <p>Mr Annan declined at a press conference on Monday to name the candidates he was considering. </p> <p>\"This is not a public election. We have organised a long search. In fact, some of the candidates were not even candidates - they had to be approached. </p> <p>\"I don't think it would be appropriate for me to embarrass people who were not even themselves candidates by throwing their name around if they do not happen to be selected,\" he said. </p> <p>The confirmed candidates, either self-declared or mentioned by their governments, include: Bernard Kouchner, head of the UN administration in Kosovo, a former French health minister, and former head of M\u00e9decins sans Fronti\u00e8res; Emma Bonino, former EU commissioner for humanitarian affairs; Giuseppe Migone, head of the Italian senate's foreign-affairs commission; and Knut Vollebaek, a former Norwegian foreign minister. </p> <p>African countries have put forward Maxime-Leopold Zollner de Medeiros of Benin, a former UNHCR official. </p> <p>Other candidates include Sergio Vieira de Mello, the UN's representative in East Timor and highly regarded as a former assistant high commissioner; the current assistant high commissioner Soren Jessen-Petersen; and Jan Pronk, a Dutch minister. </p> <p>The incumbent, Sadako Ogata, of Japan, is retiring. </p> <p>Mr Annan will make the appointment, which then has to be approved by the UN. This is normally a formality. </p> <p>The UNHCR, which has a budget of $1.2bn (\u00a3818m), has been criticised for its management style and for apparently moving away from its original remit of protecting refugees to seeking their reintegration. </p> <p>UN officials say that, apart from leadership and management qualities, the clear preference is for someone with a humanitarian background and experience with asylum issues, fundraising and advocacy. Mr Annan said he wanted \"somebody who will have the confidence of the donor countries and the NGO community\". </p> <p>The two names most frequently mentions by diplomats are Mr Kouchner and Mr Vieira de Mello. </p> <p>Mr Kouchner's reputation for being outspoken counts marginally against him.</p>",
