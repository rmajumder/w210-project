  "<p>Numerous shops, restaurants and other businesses in Dublin are advertising in their windows for staff. To fill jobs at high technology companies, Irish recruitment agencies are having to scour the world. </p> <p>The Irish Republic, where emigration was the norm for generations, is now experiencing a severe labour shortage. </p> <p>The Dublin government reckons the country will need to recruit 200,000 skilled workers from overseas in the next seven years. The number of vacant semi-skilled or unskilled jobs is probably even greater. </p> <p>The booming Irish economy, the Celtic Tiger, has already attracted tens of thousands of emigrants to return home. </p> <p>In the year to April 1999, 48,000 people - many of them returnees - entered the country to live, and only 29,000 left. Net immigration since 1995 has totalled 64,000. </p> <p>Many people with no particular family connection to Ireland are also choosing it as their home. A few of the more famous examples are Marianne Faithfull, Rolling Stones singer Ronnie Wood and the BBC's John Simpson. </p> <p>So should you think about joining them? Aside from whether it could enhance your career, do the green hills, golf courses and excellent schools attract you? If they do, it is time to look at the financial prospects. </p> <p>To the casual British visitor, Ireland seems very cheap because the value of the Irish pound, which is part of the euro, has slid to the point where it costs IR\u00a31.22 to buy \u00a31 sterling. Ireland's low corporate taxes have attracted the European bases of some of the largest US companies, particularly in hi-tech industries. </p> <p>If, like Faithfull or Wood you make a living as an artist, a move is worth considering. Artists get generous tax breaks, allowing them to pay no tax at all on most of the income received from their works. </p> <p>But for normal working people, it is wise to look closely at the tax situation, as it is pretty confusing. The top rate of income tax is 44 per cent this year - down 2 per cent on last year. </p> <p>A single person goes on to the top rate after earning only IR\u00a317,000. A married couple with two incomes hits the same rate at double this (they are taxed jointly), but a couple with one income reach this level after IR\u00a328,000. </p> <p>Figures from the Dutch investment bank ABN-Amro confirm that the tax burden on single people is much higher than the UK, except for the low paid. A single person earning \u00a310,000 in the UK pays 16.6 per cent of their pay in tax and National Insurance. </p> <p>The total deductions in the Republic on IR\u00a310,000 would be only 11.6 per cent. So if you want to fill one of the many hotel, restaurant or shop jobs going begging, you could be better off. </p> <p>For skilled workers, how ever, the situation reverses. On IR\u00a325,000, the average pay in the Irish public sector, a single person pays 29.6 per cent in tax and National Insurance against 25.8 per cent in the UK. Moreover, the total deducted from those on \u00a340,000 a year in the UK is 28.3 per cent, compared with 36.1 per cent in Ireland. </p> <p>ABN-Amro concludes that Irish taxes are too high for skilled single people. </p> <p>However, if you are married, and only one of you works, you will probably be better off there due to the generous married couple's allowance. </p> <p>The other crucial thing to bear in mind is that the cost of renting or buying a home in Ireland has sky-rocketed in recent years, so even if your net earnings look good, they could all be dedicated to keeping a roof over your head. </p> <p>However, John Bradley, director of personal financial services at KPMG in Dublin, says: 'We deal with a lot of expats and the reaction I get from UK people is that a lot of them like the lifestyle. It's more laid-back, there's good golf and recreational facilities, and they like the quality of the education'. </p> <p>Whether this is enough to make you overlook paying 44 per cent tax on most of your income is a personal decision. </p> <p>So, these are the factors you should consider before crossing the Irish Sea to live: </p> <p><strong> Tax</strong></p> <p> If you move to Ireland, you will have to pay Irish taxes whether you are paid in the UK or the Republic. But if your income is from other countries, you will pay Irish taxes only on the sums that you actually bring into Ireland. This also means that non-Irish people living there can hold their savings offshore of the UK and Ireland, and not pay Irish tax on them. </p> <p>For those who do have to pay, tax is much higher now in Ireland than in the UK. The good news is that by 2002, when the next Irish general election is due, the standard rate should have reduced by 4 per cent to 20 per cent and the top rate cut by a similar percentage to 40 per cent. </p> <p>The Dublin government, aware that it needs to get more of its people doing paid work, is also moving away from giving a married couple, where only one partner works, an effective \u00a311,000 in extra tax allowances. Single person's allowances are expected to rise. </p> <p>Bear in mind that many indirect Irish taxes are higher. VAT is 21 per cent, compared to the UK's 17.5 per cent. Taxes on buying property, as you will see below, are eye-poppingly high. </p> <p><strong> Property</strong></p> <p> Irish house prices have shot up to the point where houses and flats are all but unaffordable to people on average pay. </p> <p>A three-bedroom house in a pleasant part of Dublin will probably cost in excess of IR\u00a3350,000. Rents too have soared. A two-bedroom Dublin flat can easily cost IR\u00a31,000 a month. </p> <p>The good news is that you do not pay rates or community charges in Ireland, although some councils do make smallish charges for refuse collection and the like. </p> <p>The other good news is that mortgage rates are lower than in the UK. The standard rate is between 4.8 and 4.9 per cent, although the Bank of Scotland is offering 4.19 per cent. </p> <p>You will be severely stung by stamp duties, however. The Irish government charges a whopping 5 per cent on houses worth up to IR\u00a3250,000, 7 per cent on property up to \u00a3500,000 and 9 per cent above that. </p> <p>The property boom has proved to be a good earner for the government. Its other charges include stamp duty on your mortgage, and land registration tax. </p> <p>Lawyers also get in on the act. Dublin solicitors routinely charge 1 per cent of the cost of the property for conveyancing. All in all, it is much more expensive than buying property in the UK. </p> <p>The government is giving tax breaks to encourage landowners to build new homes for sale but, because Ireland is in the euro, it is unable to raise interest rates to cap demand. </p> <p>And - despite the high prices - demand for property has not yet been choked off. </p> <p><strong> Cars</strong></p> <p> Cars are generally more expensive in Ireland than in the UK because of higher taxes, although the manufacturers themselves actually charge less. </p> <p>If you do decide to move, the best option is to take your British-registered car with you, provided you have owned it for at least six months. You will pay no extra taxes on it as long as you do not sell it for at least 12 months after your arrival. </p> <p>You will find that petrol is cheaper than in the UK, which is why there are few petrol stations just north of the Irish border. </p> <p><strong> Health and schools</strong></p> <p> You may curse the failings of the National Health Service until you have to manage without it. Unless you are claiming social security or are a pensioner, you have to pay for each visit to the doctor in Ireland - usually IR\u00a325 per consultation - for dental treatment and for all your medicines, some of which are very expensive. </p> <p>Many employers offer partial, or in some cases total, insurance cover. Childcare in Dublin is cheaper than in London. The charges are more in line with those in the North of England. </p> <p>There is a shortage of nannies and of nursery places, again due to the national shortage of labour. </p> <p>Irish schools, on the whole, are very good, although some parents prefer private education, which has not suffered the same fee inflation as in the UK (see case study). </p> <p>Many state schools are run by the Catholic church.</p> <p><strong> Case study: 'We can't afford a house'</strong></p> <p>Michael O'Loughlin, a screenwriter and novelist, left Ireland in the Eighties and returned two years ago to take advantage of the tax-free earnings for artists. </p> <p>His return was 'not in any way sentimental', he says. 'It was financially pragmatic and to see if Ireland was how I remembered - a laid-back sort of place.' He and his Dutch wife have been shocked, however, by high house prices in Dublin, and disappointed by what they see as the rampant materialism of the newly rich country.</p> <p>'We came back thinking we'd rent for a while and then buy a nice house.' But they cannot afford to buy, and are fed up with the lack of regulation of the rental market, which means landlords can charge what they like, O'Loughlin says. Their 11-year-old daughter is at a private school. The fees are lower than in the UK, but he has found 'it nearly impossible to find a free school that is any good'.</p> <p>Despite the tax break, exile beckons again: 'The advantages of tax exemption are nearly cancelled out by the high cost of property, to the extent that we are thinking of leaving.'</p>",
  "<p><br><strong>Address: </strong>Venue, Cambridge</p> <p>I am rather sensitive about the whereabouts of chefs after the Admiralty debacle (when Eric Guilbert, the chef whose skills I had lauded, jumped ship a week or so after my review, to the chagrin of those who booked a table on my say-so). So, imagine how I felt in Cambridge last week when I learned that the nameless chef, whose lunchtime cooking I had just enjoyed, was emigrating to Spain in three days. I was so cross that I kicked a lamp-post until my toe hurt. </p> <p>In which case, why should I bother to carry on with this review, you may well ask. Well, after a long conversation with the management, I was convinced that, while the chef may change, the style of the place and its food will remain much the same, which is individual to say the least. Beyond that, in a city of a thousand Cafe Flos, Garfunkels, All Bar Ones, Cafe Rouges, etc etc etc, Venue strikes a cheerfully individual note. In that, it is not quite alone - Restaurant Twenty-Two and Midsummer House keep the independents' flag flying in Cambridge - but those two are justly celebrated in guides. Venue is not yet and, in answer to a purposeful recommendation from a reader, it was to Venue that I went. </p> <p>If I had not bothered, the charming young woman who looked after me and the manager could have packed up for the day and gone sun-bathing. I shared the 50s-kitsch dining room with one other lunchtimer. All too soon, he had munched and gone, leaving me to the Arne Jacobsen chairs, the cream walls broken here and there by flat planes of candy-floss pink, ice-lolly orange and odd, larger-than-life-sized, Heath-esque cut-out cartoon figures; and the charming rope of white lightbulbs hung like a string of giant pearls over metal balustrading at the far end of the room. A piano and microphone made up the slightly surreal arrangements for the room. There was no canned music, just the ghost of jazz evenings past. </p> <p>This may all sound awful to you, but it isn't. It has a gawky charm and distinct personality, qualities that we don't find as frequently as we should these days, when everything is calibrated by corporate design strategy or cloned from one or two originals. Added to which, you can have two courses of big-tasting, individually prepared, properly cooked food for \u00a39.50 - no more than you would end up paying for conveyor-belt dishes of dubious parentage at any number of ersatz Continental-style chains. </p> <p>I did not choose from the lunchtime set menu, tempted though I was by smoked salmon soup and grilled chicken fillet with lemon, rosemary, salad and potatoes. I decided that a terrine of spiced sardines and thyme with saffron, tomato and lemon dressing followed by roasted chump of English lamb with carrot-and-sultana chutney and tzatziki suited my mood better.</p> <p>Mixing and matching of ingredients and cooking styles seems to hold universal sway these days, but whoever has the final say over the Venue menu has a pretty unusual touch. There were some really seriously considered vegetarian dishes for a start - chickpea mousseline frite with parsley-mint tabbouleh and creamed a\u00efoli, for example. And then there are the herbs and spices - thyme with the sardines; cinnamon, ginger and turmeric oil; minted hollandaise sauce; carrots in ginger oil; grated potato and horseradish to go alongside a smoked salmon and samphire salad - which add a distinctly idiosyncratic, not to say quirky, cast to the food. </p> <p>The terrine turned out to be a generous block of layers of mildly mashed sardines and slices of suitably waxy potatoes. It was expertly assembled and genuinely spiced. It would have benefited from having been out of the fridge for longer, as the chill killed off the thyme and damped down the other flavours, but this was an unusual and effective dish, all the more so because the dressing was first rate. </p> <p>At first glance, the main course may seem even more bizarre, but if you remember that Indians temper the heat of curries with yoghurt and that Armenians like to splash the stuff into their stews, the combination of English roasted lamb, Indian chutney and Greek salad is not so odd as it may first appear. It is also really rather good. The cause of the dish was helped by exceptionally fine lamb, generously flavoured, thickly sliced, nicely pink and properly seasoned.</p> <p> The \"chutney\" was more like shredded carrot with sultanas, gingered up with masala, but the spicy sweetness went cheerfully along with the meat, while the tzatziki added a cooling crunch. To these were added a bowl of spectacularly good slices of crisply saut\u00e9ed potatoes draped in a gently garlicky sauce. Killer stuff. </p> <p>A plum-and-almond tart brought things to a substantial conclusion, and a bill for \u00a343.20 - \u00a329.25 of which went on the food, and the rest on two glasses of wine, water and coffee. For serious headbangers, the William Hagues and Euan Blairs of this world, there's a bar upstairs, which has a generous sprinkling of cocktails around the \u00a33.50 mark. </p> <p>So that's Venue as it is now, and as it will remain - at least, until the new chef, whoever he or she may be, takes things into their own hands and starts making those changes that all chefs must make sooner or later, or else go mad.</p>",
  "<p>It's a touchy time for new British cinema, with the Film Council kicking in and making its intentions known in no uncertain terms. As its head John Woodward put it in an interview with the French trade magazine Le Film Fran\u00e7ais, published yesterday in the Guardian, the Film Council is not interested in making low-budget \"social realist art films\", whatever they are. </p> <p>All the more embarrassing, then, that in this year's new British cinema at Edinburgh, it is the \"social realist art films\" - some of them made on staggeringly low budgets - that stand out as the most exciting material on offer. </p> <p>One of them is a digital production shot in Glasgow on a micro-budget (in the \"low five-figures\", according to the director). One Life Stand is the feature debut by May Miles Thomas, who not only wrote and directed, but also shot the film and edited it herself at home on her PC. It's an object lesson in telling a story cheaply and turning the visual rough edges to your advantage - but all that would just be production anecdote if not for the fact that this is a very fine film indeed. </p> <p>Social realist art cinema? Yes, in the sense that it addresses everyday British life in all its banality and desperation, and that it has an artistic edge in Thomas's stark, melancholy compositions. </p> <p>The tightly-scripted story is in a well-established kitchen-sink lineage - the Play For Today tradition that television no longer sees fit to bother with. Trise (Maureen Carr), a strapped-for-cash single mother, works on a dial-a-tarot phone line and finds herself uneasily lending a sympathetic ear to the desperate callers. Meanwhile, her narcissistic teenage son (John Kielty) fancies himself as a male model but finds himself only making headway as a rent boy. This tough, harrowing but often uncomfortably funny drama gives the slice-of-life genre a new surge of energy. The sense of enclosure, as the digital black-and-white photography explores cramped apartments, bedrooms and offices, creates an uneasy intimacy that brings the characters vibrantly alive: by the end of it we know every crease on Trise's brow. </p> <p>The acting is uniformly superb, and while the film is socially engaged, it doesn't take the Ken Loach route of spelling things out for us. It's a moot point whether our film and TV industry currently has room for a hard-boiled case like Thomas - but it should. </p> <p>Another realist, already established, is Paul Pawlikowski, who made the BBC docudrama Twockers. But with Last Resort, written by Rowan Joffe, he has really arrived. </p> <p>Tanya (Dina Korzun), a young Russian mother, arrives in Britain with her young son and ends up consigned to a holding centre for asylum seekers - a desolate seaside resort that's like Butlins doubling as Kafka's Penal Colony, all hollowly ringing amusement arcades and fried fish that's pure batter. </p> <p>The film works brilliantly on several levels - as an intimately observed character piece, as a quasi-documentary expos\u00e9 on the conditions of life for asylum seekers and as an impressionistic depiction of our wretched cultural landscape, shot with an eye for poetic drabness by Ryszard Lenczewski. </p> <p>Korzun is a tender, affecting presence, but the scene-stealer - playing the seedy bingo caller who befriends Tanya - is Paddy Considine, who made his mark as the shell-suited maniac in Shane Meadows's A Room For Romeo Brass, and is shaping up to be a compulsive and natural player. </p> <p>A different kind of realism - funkier and lighter but still tough - comes in The Low Down. Superficially resembling the This Life school of drama, it has a gang of moderately groovy young urbanites experiencing love and other catastrophes in Hackney. </p> <p>But Jamie Thraves's film, shot and edited with a jumpy exuberance that owes a lot to Jean-Luc Godard's Breathless, is something else - an ensemble portrait that brings its characters alive without the script having to join the dots for us. Heading an impressive and mainly unknown cast is Aiden Gillen, from Queer As Fuck and Mojo, who continues to be one of the most compelling new faces on the British screen - whether brooding, smirking or silently brazening out the threats of a pub drunk. </p> <p>Lucia Zucchetti's editing is acutely tuned to those split seconds when characters reveal themselves through a tic or a faux pas. The Low Down is fresh and funny, and even a cute celeb cameo from TV jokers Adam and Joe fits in perfectly. </p> <p>It's not just realism that's on offer from the new contenders. Let's hope the new regime has room for eccentrics like Ben Hopkins, whose second feature, The Nine Lives of Tomas Katz, is a strange, misshapen, sometimes inspired oddity. Hopkins, who made the venturesome anomaly Simon Magus, indulges himself something rotten in a sparky micro-budget apocalyptic fantasy that suggests a hellish collision between Michael Moorcock, NF Simpson and the Jon Pertwee-era Dr Who. </p> <p>It is wayward and uneven, and I can't honestly say I liked it, yet there are occasional flashes of brilliance - such as the image of two security men watching thousands of video screens. At any rate, it's something of a miracle that an outsider like Hopkins is getting his visions on screen, and he is worth encouraging. If the right producer nudges him in the right direction, Hopkins's third, fourth or fifth film could well be extraordinary. </p> <p>\u0095 Last Resort plays tonight at Filmhouse 1.

  "William Hague came under fire yesterday from a senior Tory backbencher for failing to develop principled policies and for a lacklustre performance over the summer that has played into the hands of the government. <p>In a sign of the growing unease among Tory MPs over the party's poor showing in opinion polls, David Davis, the chairman of the Commons public accounts committee, said that Mr Hague had lost the impetus that he had built up in the spring. </p> <p>\"There is plenty to attack [the government on] but they are getting away with it because there has been no attack,\" Mr Davis, a former minister, said. \"It is a matter of energy level and drive as much as anything else.\" </p> <p>The criticism of Mr Hague from a respected Tory backbencher will anger the party leadership, which is growing increasingly alarmed by the fall in its support in recent polls. The latest Mori poll, in the Times on Thursday, showed that Tory support had slumped to 29%, with Labour soaring ahead to 51%. Other polls also confirm that Labour has seen off the brief challenge from the Tories in the spring and early summer when government support dipped. </p> <p>Mr Davis said the Tories had thrown away the campaigning opportunities in possibly the last summer before the general election, and contrasted it to Labour's summer offensive in 1996. Asked on the BBC's The World at One what had gone wrong, Mr Davis said: \"I do not honestly know the answer to that. What I hope is that they are going to come back all guns blazing in September and start to create problems for the government.\" </p> <p>His remarks show how Mr Hague's fortunes have plummeted since the spring when he unsettled the government by seizing on populist issues such as the jailed Norfolk farmer Tony Martin and asylum seekers. </p> <p>However, the Tories started to falter in July when Mr Hague abandoned flagship policies, such as his \"tax guarantee\", and the government regained the initiative with Gordon Brown's spending review. </p> <p>Mr Davis, MP for Haltemprice and Howden, said that Mr Hague's initial enthusiasm for high-profile guarantees, and his failure to replace his discarded pledges with coherent policies, were a mistake. He said the party would only win round voters with \"credible and principled\" policies. </p> <p>\"If we up the energy level, go on the attack more and make sure that what we go for is credible and principled and consistent, then we have a chance to put this awful government out of place,\" he said. </p> <p>Mr Davis's remarks were dismissed by John Redwood, the Tories' \"spin buster\". \"I don't think it's a fair criticism of William Hague,\" he said. \"The mood for the Conservatives is a lot better now than it was in 1996-97 and the mood against this government is very strong.\" </p> <p>Mr Redwood said he did not believe the polls because the Tories had performed well in this year's local elections and last year's European elections. \"We have got a few polls which I think are completely meaningless,\" he said. </p> <p>Mr Davis's criticism of the Tory leadership delighted Labour, whose spinners recalled their success during the last summer before the 1997 election when they forced John Major's government onto the defensive. </p> <p>This summer the Tories have struggled to set the agenda and have been mainly reactive, often to little effect. This week the Tories criticised the government over the lottery when the ruling on Camelot was made by an independent statutory body.</p>",
  "I would like to clarify the impression that may have been given by the headline of my article (Straw's race policies are racist, August 25). <p>I do not believe, and did not say, that the home secretary's race policies are racist - they aim for many of the right targets and are much more positive than previous governments' policies. But they would benefit from more dialogue with ethnic minority communities and international bodies. </p> <p>On asylum, however, the government has failed to combat racist rhetoric effectively and some of its policies will lead to the social exclusion of minority groups. Unless these two policy areas are joined up, this risks undermining positive moves on race. <br><b>Anne Owers</b><br>Director, Justice</p>",
  "Kicking your heels in an immigration holding-pen can powerfully focus the mind. A few weeks back I flew into Detroit to work with a giant, would-be global car company. <p>As my turn came to speak to the grim-looking immigration officer, he grilled me on who I was working for, how much I was being paid - and whether there weren't American experts who could do the job? </p> <p>I answered the first, told him the second was none of his business and, on the third point, noted that Europe now has something of a competitive advantage in stakeholder engagement processes. </p> <p>He decided I needed a lesson in local power politics. Happily, my luck held: once in the pen, a charming official sped me through the process and wished me God-speed. But the process turned up the amps on a thought-process that had been buzzing around my brain as we crossed the Atlantic. </p> <p>Ahead of the next day's stakeholder process, which I was co-facilitating, I had been reading two recent books on globalisation: Thomas Friedman's The Lexus and the Olive Tree (HarperCollins, \u00a38.99) and A Future Perfect by John Micklethwait and Adrian Wooldridge (Heinemann, \u00a320.00). The combination was mind-altering - and should be required reading in anyone's immigration service. </p> <p>One message I had already absorbed from Friedman was that the inevitable backlash to globalisation won't come just from the downtrodden. \"Like all revolutions,\" he says, \"Globalisation involves a shift in power from one group to another. In most countries it involves a power shift from the state and its bureaucrats to the private sector and entrepreneurs. </p> <p>\"As this happens, all those who derived their status from positions in the bureaucracy, or from their ties to it, or from their position in a highly regulated and protected economic system, can become losers - if they can't make the transition to the Fast World.\" </p> <p>It's hard to imagine even the surliest immigration officers being out of work any time soon, particularly in the US, where the country's southern boundaries are under growing pressure from would-be immigrants. But my small contretemps in Detroit further sensitised me to a key theme of the Micklethwait and Wooldridge book: the importance of borders. </p> <p>These, they say, \"are arbitrary abstractions, economic impediments, and surprisingly ineradicable\". It's a paradox that globalisation will force us to think about our borders - economic, social and environmental - as never before. </p> <p>But what most worries these two is the risk that the whole process may still fall flat on its face. They suspect that \"globalisation's psychic energy - the uncertainty that it creates which forces companies, governments, and people to perform better - may have a natural stall point, a moment when people can take no more\". </p> <p>Last year's \"Battle of Seattle\", which shook the World Trade Organization to its roots, was an early warning that the Fast World may be dangerously near some sort of stall point. </p> <p>Whatever immigration officers may believe, countries championing globalisation must lean over backwards to open up their own markets. </p> <p>As Friedman concludes: \"For globalisation to be sustainable America must be at its best - today, tomorrow, all the time.\" </p> <p>Do Americans, do we, realise just how big a challenge this is going to be? </p> <p>\u0095 John Elkington is chairman of strategy consultants SustainAbility (web-site: <a href=\"http://www.sustainability.co.uk\" target=\"_NEW\">www.sustainability.co.uk</a>) and author of Cannibals With Forks: The Triple Bottom Line of 21st Century Business (Capstone, \u00a312.99).</p>",
  "Hyderabad had no answer when the savage monsoon rained down. A family of 30 climbed to a rooftop and prayed for hours for rescue. Air force helicopters tried to drop food parcels but they missed their targets and the aid was washed away. <p>The Musi river, which divides the old town from the new, flooded its banks and ran like an open sewer through the city's narrow streets. </p> <p>In the past four days more than 125 people have died in Hyderabad and across the rest of Andhra Pradesh state; 100,000 are now homeless. </p> <p>\"Children were crying for food. It shows how frightening the situation is,\" the state's chief minister, Chandrababu Naidu, said. </p> <p>\"The depression formed very suddenly and we were not warned about the amount of rainfall it was going to bring. Even if we had got the correct information, it would not be possible for anybody to face this sort of a situation on a notice of a few hours.\" </p> <p>Six people were killed in the city when a building collapsed, another girl died when she was struck by lightning. </p> <p>Many more are missing in the worst floods for 40 years, and more rain is forecast for the next few days. </p> <p>Some were luckier: three Indian Air Force helicopters managed to rescue 150 people stranded on rooftops. </p> <p>\"Several people have no access to safe drinking water. The danger of diseases spreading will increase as we begin the difficult job of clearing livestock carcasses and debris,\" Mr Naidu said. </p> <p>Elsewhere in Andhra Pradesh heavy rain brought down electricity and telephone lines and blocked the main road from Madras to Calcutta. </p> <p>In the town of Nandyal, about 120 miles south of Hyderabad, one of the worst hit areas, helicopters rescued 53 people from the roof of a bus which had been swept into a river, and one plucked 15 others from a tree. </p> <p>Less than three months ago millions of Indians were suffering from one of the worst droughts in the country's history: fields turned to dust, wells ran dry and villagers prayed for rain. </p> <p>Now the rains have come and brought more suffering. Half a year's average rainfall poured down on Hyderabad in one day this week. </p> <p>Since the monsoon began in June, sweeping south from Assam in the north-east, more than 400 have died and 5m have been affected in India. More have suffered in Bangladesh, Bhutan and Nepal. </p> <p>With the rain has come disease. In Assam, which ranks as one of the world's wettest regions, at least 38 people, many sheltering in refugee camps, have died in the past fortnight from gastroenteritis. Stagnant pools of flood water are quickly breeding mosquitoes, which carry malaria. </p> <p>Farmers had just planted their rice seedlings, but now more than 200,000 hectares (495,000 acres) of crops have been damaged. Many people have complained of the slow pace of medical aid and are struggling to find clean drinking water. </p> <p>The price of firewood, needed to boil water clean, has soared in local shops. Some are using improvised filters of sand and rocks. </p> <p>\"For the past three weeks no government doctors have visited us and we are left to survive on our own. Many people in my village are suffering from high fever and dysentery,\" said Binoy Chandra Rabha, a villager in Chayyagaon, close to Guwahati, 70 miles south of the border with Bhutan. </p> <p>The International Federation of the Red Cross has appealed for $3.5m (\u00a32.4m) to help India's flood victims. \"There are certain things that can be done,\" its local spokesman, Patrick Fuller, said. </p> <p>\"But it is very hard to hold back the elements.\"</p>",
  "Four Channel 4 journalists charged with espionage in Liberia were released from prison yesterday after a week of international protests and a personal apology from the men and the chairman of the television company to Liberian president Charles Taylor. <p>The four men, who were making a three-part documentary, were detained last Friday and charged on Monday with helping British and US intelligence to support allegations that Liberia was assisting rebels in neighbouring Sierra Leone by diamond smuggling and gun running. </p> <p>Interviewed on CNN, Mr Taylor said their release was the result of \"plea bargaining\" between government lawyers and defence counsel. </p> <p>\"We are not expelling the journalists but they are free to leave whenever they want,\" he said. </p> <p>The journalists - British director David Barrie, Zimbabwe-born cameraman Tim Lambon, who has dual South African and British nationality, Sorious Samura from Sierra Leone, and South African soundman Gugulakhe Radebe - were expected to fly out of the capital Monrovia to Abidjan on the Ivory Coast. Under the Liberian penal code they could have faced 10 years in prison or, according to the indictment, the death penalty. </p> <p>Their release was welcomed by the foreign secretary Robin Cook as \"an enormous relief for the men's families\". </p> <p>Mr Cook said that he would be thanking President Ob-asanjo of Nigeria; Nelson Mandela; Jesse Jackson, President Clinton's envoy to Africa; and the Sierra Leone ambassador to Liberia for their efforts. </p> <p>The Liberian authorities released the men's statement which read: \"We, the four journalists currently held in Monrovia central prison, wish to express our unreserved apology to both his excellency the president of Liberia and the people of Liberia for any offence which our actions or statements have caused.\" </p> <p>The letter to Mr Taylor from Channel 4 chairman Vanni Treves, which is not being released, reinforced that message. </p> <p>Mr Taylor told CNN that the charges against the men stemmed from a script seized from them at the time of their arrest at their Monrovia hotel. He said the journalists appeared to have decided on their story before arriving in Liberia and to have come to the country to \"fill in the blanks\". </p> <p>\"This was not a check to the free press. We were dealing with a case of conspiracy with a clear case of libel here, which would have damaged this country. </p> <p>\"I am very thankful to Almighty God that they have realised that an error has been made and that Channel 4 in Britain have issued a statement of remorse, because they did something terrible here.\" </p> <p>Mr Taylor, a former warlord in the Liberian civil war, has repeatedly denied allegations that he was colluding with his allies across the border, the rebel Revolutionary United Front which controls Sierra Leone's diamond areas. He again demanded proof yesterday, even though the evidence is far from circumstantial. </p> <p>British and American officials have claimed to have information from photographs and satellite surveillance of arms being trucked across the border to the rebels as well as intelligence of meetings between rebel leaders and Mr Taylor. </p> <p>It is estimated that last year Liberia, with an annual diamond production worth about $10m (\u00a36.8m), exported stones to the value of $300m. A senior Swiss customs official confirmed two weeks ago that Liberian imports had surged from nothing in 1997 to $29.7m in the first half of this year. Last month a senior director of De Beers, the main diamond buyer, told a conference in London that 600 Liberian soldiers were guarding a rebel diamond mine. </p> <p>In July, the UN security council imposed a ban on the purchase of Sierra Leone diamonds that do not have a government certificate in an effort to prevent the RUF from financing its long-running civil war, in which tens of thousands have been killed and maimed.</p>",

  "Silhouetted against the sky, the propeller blade jutted out of the glacier like a tombstone marking the grave of the four RAF men. <p>Awestruck by the sight of a thousand pieces of aircraft wreckage strewn over the frozen wasteland, Horour Geirsson asked his team to stop. The Icelandic historian was momentarily lost for words, then managed to utter the Lord's Prayer for the crew whose death came violently and swiftly. Until now, their bodies had been entombed in ice for 60 years. </p> <p>For Mr Geirsson, this week marked the end of a 20-year mission to locate the Fairey Battle bomber which crashed in dense fog in 1941, 3,000ft up a remote mountain in northern Iceland. </p> <p>The warmest Icelandic summer for 30 years had melted several metres of ice to reveal the burial spot. Mr Geirsson, together with a six-strong RAF team aided by two local guides, used a Sea King helicopter to reach the crash site where the wartime flyers were left in makeshift graves after the crash. </p> <p>During the three-day operation, the team, led by Squadron Leader Nick Barr, of RAF Kinloss in Morayshire, braved temperatures of -10C to recover the bodies. On arrival, they found the scene remarkably well-preserved with personal belongings of the air crew still littering the crash site. </p> <p>Poignant reminders of the men who perished included tins of corned beef, an airman's perfectly preserved uniform jacket and a watch belonging to the pilot, Flying Officer Arthur Round, 26. A simple inscription on the back of the watch read: \"14.2.34. To Arthur Round from Dad\". </p> <p>Other personal effects included a charred leather belt, toothbrushes, razors and a wallet containing Icelandic coins bent from the force of the aircraft smashing into the mountain at 250 knots. </p> <p>The aircraft was one of 18 that arrived from France after the Dunkirk evacuation in August 1940. In May 1941, it was flown by Mr Round, from Wellington in New Zealand. </p> <p>He was accompanied by Flight Sergeant Reginald Hopkins, 21. They had just collected Pilot Officer Henry Talbot, 24, and Flight Sergeant Keith Garret, 22, from a hospital ship, HS Leinster, moored at Akureyri in north Iceland. The two men had been recovering from injuries received in a road accident. </p> <p><b> Dense fog</b><br> </p> <p>But shortly after takeoff from Reykjavik, the plane hit dense fog during its return journey to the base at Kaldadarnes airfield. It struck a glacier in the remote mountain region near Akureyri after the pilot apparently became disorientated. </p> <p>A week later in 1941, British servicemen accompanied by an Anglican and Catholic priest, climbed to the crash site and found the bodies and the wreckage. A short service was held and a wooden cross erected before the group was forced to turn back because of deteriorating weather. </p> <p>Mr Geirsson, who works at Akureyri museum, and is a member of the Iceland Historical Aviation Society, became fascinated after hearing rumours in 1980. </p> <p>He made more than a dozen visits to the glacier searching for the plane and without realising it walked over the wreckage on several occasions. </p> <p>Finally, a friend researching at the Public Record Office in London came across a report by the original search party complete with map grid references. </p> <p>Describing the moment when he found the plane last August, Mr Geirsson said: \"We were literally heading for a cross on a map. When we got to the site we were shocked to find wreckage of the plane, small and large human remains and personal possessions all perfectly preserved.\" Last night Mr Barr described how his team used helicopters loaned by the Icelandic coastguard and the American air force. They landed as close as they dared to the site and hiked for 25 minutes up the mountain. </p> <p>\"The glacier was more than 3,000ft up and incredibly vast. It had large crevasses and was extremely desolate. </p> <p>\"The aircraft wreckage was spread out over a 50-metre radius. When I first saw it I was amazed at the devastation the crash had created. There was also evidence of a pretty savage fire. The wreckage included blackened flight instruments down to the smallest washers.\" </p> <p>\"I think everybody was overcome with a feeling of helplessness that four men had died there. While we contemplated the scene, the only sound you could hear was the running meltwater from the thawing glacier.\" </p> <p>Mr Barr said the team started to dig out sections of the plane with ice axes and painstakingly sifted the debris for signs of human remains. Efforts to dig deeper were hampered by rock-hard ice which formed an impenetrable layer a foot below the surface. </p> <p>He added: \"It was very hard to distinguish between what had been parts of the aircraft and what might have been human remains. It was a combination of rotted damp clothing and possibly some flesh and bones mixed in. We collected it all and put it carefully into bags.\" </p> <p>The team spent three days digging. They were forced to abandon their mission after two explosions rocked the glacier as they tried to remove a Browning submachinegun, with 200 rounds of ammunition, and the aircraft's propeller. Corporal Dave Hughes said: \"I started to run towards the rocks thinking it was a UXB that had gone off. I expected to see the smouldering boots of my colleagues. We later found out it was cracks opening up in the glacier and that was the sound of the ice moving beneath our feet. We decided to leave the propeller and get off the mountain for our own safety.\" </p> <p>Relatives of the dead airmen will attend a special ceremony in Reykjavik where the remains will be buried in a special memorial service and flypast tomorrow. </p> <p><br><b>Still missing, mystery crashes:</b></p> <p>\u0095<b> 1944</b> Band leader Glen Miller took off from England for France but never arrived.

The new forensic examination indicated the bones were of a woman, 5ft 7in tall, of northern European descent. </p> <p>Research by Alastair Williamson</p>",
  "Seven years after the Russian army pulled out of its base in Klomino, in north-western Poland, the surrounding woods are still sprinkled with landmines and the groundwater is polluted by a 2cm-thick layer of fuel. <p>The derelict village, which lies close to the coast and the German border, is one of hundreds of former military installations in Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Hungary which have not yet been put to a new use. </p> <p>The Polish state, which now owns the bases, is hoping for foreign investment and eventual European Union funds, but in the meantime Poles are taking the job of transforming them into their own hands. </p> <p>Margareta Substych, a 23-year-old grocer's assistant, began squatting with her family in a former officer's three-roomed flat in Klomino immediately after the Russians pulled out in 1993. </p> <p>Until recently they had no running water, electricity, or neighbours. But an oil-fired boiler and sewage treatment plant have now been installed to lure investors, along with water-purification and waste-disposal systems. And some months ago another family moved into the estate, which has 700 flats, and together they tend a vegetable garden and feed off an apple orchard. </p> <p>There are other signs of growth. A local law firm has hired a bodyguard to protect two buildings it has just bought, and the Roman Catholic church plans to consecrate the base cinema, which it reportedly acquired for a dollar. </p> <p>Just a few miles north-east, in Borne Sulinowo, is an example of what Klomino aspires to. </p> <p>A few years ago the town existed only on Russian military maps. When the Russians left in a negotiated withdrawal four years after the collapse of communism, their troops took every light-bulb, window-pane, tap, drain-hole cover and sewage pump. Some rooms were even stripped of their wallpaper. </p> <p>Yet today the town demonstrates the hidden potential of the old bases. </p> <p>\"It was such a shock to see it,\" said Maria Czerwiska, head of the local government commission. \"There was no water purification and electricity cables ran willy-nilly underground unprotected by plastic tubing.\" </p> <p>When some of the cables exploded, it was discovered that the withdrawing army had taken the transmission plans with them. </p> <p>But Ms Czerwiska insisted that the Russians left behind a rare opportunity and a chance for the Poles to put their innovative skills to the test. </p> <p>The scale of the challenge is huge. Poland has around 70 former bases and has so far been able to pump in just 164m zloty (\u00a325m). Most of the sprawling derelict sites contain huge blocks of flats, hospitals, aircraft hangars and weed-infested runways. </p> <p>On some of them the huge buildings have been turned into old people's homes and refugee centres. </p> <p>In Kluzewo, Dutch farmers grow potatoes along the abandoned runway and store the crop in bunkers that once housed Soviet fighters. There are plans to turn Bagicz on the Baltic coast into a tourist resort. The singer Michael Jackson has even expressed interest in building a \u00a3330m theme park on an abandoned airfield near Warsaw. </p> <p>Back in Borne Sulinowo, the mayor, Jacek Chrzanowski, is optimistic about the town's future now that the landmines and fuel spills have been cleared. </p> <p>\"We started off with no inhabitants. Now we have 3,600 and the population is growing at around 500 per year,\" he said. Sixty per cent are under 35, and 50% have a secondary or higher education, 10 times the average figure for rural areas. </p> <p>What's more, Borne Sulinowo's land and young population is just 166 miles from Berlin and not far from a planned motorway between Scandinavia and central Europe. </p> <p>A priest was the first to arrive, setting up St Albert's church in the base's former cinema. From the mid-90s a gradual stream of adventurous types started to come from all over Poland as news spread of cheap flats in the former barracks in beautiful countryside. </p> <p>\"There s now a complete social mix from all over the country, a phenomena which has never occurred in Poland before,\" Mr Chrzanowski said, proud of the region's pine forests, and its rich fishing and hunting opportunities. </p> <p>The community now includes artists from Warsaw, doctors from the south, redundant miners and former prisoners. Three-hundred businesses have taken advantage of a three-year tax-break, cheap property, and low-cost labour. They include a German paint factory and a 400-employee Polish wood-processing business which exports 98% of its garden furniture products. </p> <p>Plans are afoot to relocate 80 laid-off miners and their families from the industrial heartland of Silesia. Here their thin pensions will go much further and the microclimate will help those with breathing difficulties. Doctors boast that the air has something special to it, since the town's birthrate is roughly six times the Polish average. </p> <p>\"I know two 'infertile' families from Silesia who came here and got pregnant almost immediately,\" said Dariusz Tedenko a community policeman and historian. </p> <p>But despite strenuous local efforts it will probably take until Poland s accession to the European Union - which it aspires to join within the next three years - for it to acquire the amount of development capital needed to realise the bases' potential.</p>",
  "Mexico's president-elect, Vicente Fox, stunned the US this week by using a visit to Washington to press his call for an open US-Mexico border and a North American economic union similar to the EU. <p>President Bill Clinton and the men who want to succeed him have pleaded with Mr Fox to cool his demands. </p> <p>The US may be the world's main advocate of lowered barriers, but Mr Fox's proposal on August 17 for a North American common market in capital, goods and labour has set political alarm bells ringing in the runup to the presidential election. </p> <p>US and Canadian leaders have told Mr Fox during his visit to the two countries this week that the idea of an open border with a country synonymous for many Americans with drug smuggling and cheap labour is too radical for domestic political consumption. </p> <p>Yesterday Mr Fox travelled to Dallas to meet George W Bush, the Republican presidential candidate, who is also the governor of Texas, the US state with the longest border with Mexico. </p> <p>Mr Bush was expected to make it clear that he would not be interested in Mr Fox's open-border plan. </p> <p>\"I don't think he's fully explained open borders,\" Mr Bush said before the meeting. \"I believe we ought to enforce our borders.\" </p> <p>The US should have a \"special relationship with Mexico as clear and strong as we have had with Canada and Great Britain\", he said yesterday. </p> <p>On Thursday the Democratic presidential candidate, Al Gore, had a similar message for Mr Fox. </p> <p>\"Gore said some elements of Fox's proposal were problematic for the US,\" his national security adviser, Leon Fuerth, said after the men met in Washington. </p> <p>\"But he was interested to note that Fox wanted to paint this as a very long-term vision,\" he added </p> <p>Mr Clinton was less dismissive. \"Obviously we have borders and we have laws that apply to them, and we have to apply them, and so do the Mexicans,\" he said after meeting Mr Fox, who is due to be sworn in on December 1. </p> <p>\"But I think that over the long run our countries will become more interdependent.\" </p> <p>The US and Canada welcomed the former Coca-Cola executive's election in July as a potential breakthrough in relations with Mexico. </p> <p>But Mr Fox caused alarm when he said that he hoped this month's visit would lay the foundations for an opening of borders between the three countries, which are signatories to the 1994 North American free trade agreement (Nafta). </p> <p>In an interview with American journalists, Mr Fox cited the EU as a model of states in a region building a working common market with a free movement of capital and labour. </p> <p>\"It doesn't necessarily have to be the same as the European Union,\" he said. \"But they can serve as an inspiration for us.\" </p> <p>Mr Fox said that the three Nafta countries should set common economic goals for the next 10 years for inflation, interest rates and budget deficits. He said the border could be opened gradually, beginning with free transit in a limited zone, or with more temporary visas for Mexican workers, who currently remit about $6bn (\u00a34bn) a year to relatives. </p> <p>In Ottawa on Wednesday the Canadian prime minister, Jean Chr\u00e9tien, poured cold water on Mr Fox's ideas, setting a tone which was maintained in the US. </p> <p>\"I don't think we can adopt the European model in the years to come,\" he said. </p> <p>\"Nafta is working very well for now.\" </p> <p>The chief fear is that Mr Fox's plans would bring a huge increase in Mexican migration to the US, helping to drive down US wages and the price of American exports. </p> <p>Mr Fox says that his aim is to create economic conditions which will help to stem the flow of legal and illegal migration across the border. </p> <p>\"The best thing that could happen to the United States is to have a successful Mexico, a Mexico without poverty, a Mexico without violence, a Mexico without drug smuggling, a Mexico with employment opportunities for all, where people don't have to migrate to the United States,\" he said on August 17. </p> <p>\u0095In a speech yesterday on relations with Latin America, Mr Bush said that, if elected, he would seek authority to negotiate free trade agreements with all the countries of the region. </p> <p><b> Going north </b> Immigrants in the US <br> </p> <p> \u0095About 7m Mexicans live in the US, equivalent to 8% of the Mexican population. Roughly a third are illegal immigrants </p> <p>\u0095Mexicans easily top the lists for both legal and illegal immigration into the United States. In 1998, 131,575 Mexicans legally migrated to the US: 20% of the total admitted </p> <p>\u00952.7m Mexican illegal immigrants, more than half the illegal immigrant total, are estimated to be living in the US. The number is believed to be growing by about 150,000 a year, according to the US immigration and naturalisation service </p> <p>\u0095Two out of five illegal immigrants in the US live in California. Texas, New York and Florida are the other states with high numbers </p> <p>\u0095More than 1.53m migrants, overwhelmingly Mexican, were detained by US border control officers last year on the US-Mexico border. The vast majority, 1.49m, were returned across the border </p> <p>\u0095Last year 359 people died attempting to cross the border from Mexico into the US.

  "<p>One of the strangest sights in London can be found in Somerset House. In a room attached to the Gilbert collection is a reproduction of Sir Arthur Gilbert's study in Beverly Hills, with a life-size waxwork of Gilbert, wearing tennis clothes and holding a large white telephone. I don't know if in real life the great collector has his own hair, but in this corner of his lovely home, he appears to be wearing a toupee: the effect is ghoulish. On a wall facing the dynamic but inanimate tycoon are two portraits of Sir Arthur and Lady Gilbert. These appear to have been painted by the people who produce pictures of ancestors for low-budget TV films. They may be two of the worst portraits I have ever seen. I found myself staring at this room with more attention than I devoted to the bejewelled snuffboxes and ornate silver that Gilbert collected. </p> <p>I tried to imagine the circumstances in which a very rich, elderly, man would have demanded his own mini Madame Tussaud's as a condition of making over some of his treasures to Somerset House. I tried to imagine that most suave of men, Lord Rothschild, announcing to his fellow trustees that the idea was to have a waxwork of Sir Arthur Gilbert in tennis clothes, holding a phone, as part of the display. Perhaps he suggested it might be a kind of Jeff Koons work of art in itself - a little light relief from the unrelenting opulence of the collection. Malcolm Muggeridge described failure in politics as casting a retrospective gloom - like adultery, I think he added - and I found myself feeling retrospectively gloomy about the Gilbert collection. </p> <p>Could it be that the whole collection was in some way a demonstration of the magpie tendency - glitter as a top priority? And then I fell to wondering about the motives of many of the great collectors, and my conclusions were sombre. In one gallery is a display of a new artform (new to me) called \"micromosaics\" by Gilbert. These are reproductions of paintings and in some cases original works, done in tiny glass mosaics. From a distance they look more or less as though they have been painted. Close to, you see that they are in fact a fantastically pointless exercise in painting by numbers, done with tiny pieces of mosaic, as many as 1,400 pieces of coloured glass per square inch. They look like deranged souvenirs. But I did decide that if I ever acquired another elephant, I would save up for a silver howdah. Gilbert has two, flogged off by impoverished maharajahs. </p> <p> \u0095 A new book, A Mouthful of Glass, by a Dutch writer, explores the life of Demetrios Tsafendas, the man who in 1966 murdered the architect of apartheid, Hendrik Verwoerd. Demetrios was a temporary messenger in the parliament. He stabbed Verwoerd in the neck. </p> <p>I spoke to the author, Henk van Woerden, whose parents emigrated to South Africa. He told me he had long been fascinated by the story, not least because Verwoerd was also the son of Dutch immigrants. Tsafendas died last year in the asylum where he was forgotten for many years. Van Woerden met him and said he had considerable charm. </p> <p>As a boy, I used to go to the Rand Easter Show in Johannesburg, mainly to meet horsey girls. There, not 20 yards from where I was sitting in 1960, a farmer called David Pratt shot Verwoerd twice in the head with a .22 pistol from very close range. Verwoerd lived, although I remember his bodyguard being carried out on a stretcher, after fainting. Pratt, too, was declared insane, but committed suicide. I rushed from the showgrounds and told the first group of Africans I came across what I had seen. </p> <p>They were ecstatically happy, particularly as I reported that Verwoerd was certainly dead. The fact that Verwoerd was attempting to create a sort of science out of apartheid was understood to be more dangerous than mere prejudice. Verwoerd's grandson is now a member of the African National Congress, having had a Damascene conversion when he travelled to Britain and Holland on a scholarship in the early 80s. His father has disowned him. </p> <p>The extraordinary aspect of this story is that in so few years, so much can change. George Bernard Shaw once said that almost within his lifetime a witch had been burned in Dublin. In my lifetime a Verwoerd has joined the ANC. To me this is more remarkable than the end of witch-burning. </p> <p>#149; Islington has become a by-word for pretentiousness, presumption, upward mobility, trendiness, and - worst of all - for a cabal involving journalists, lawyers, politicians and Cambridge-educated comedians, all of whom meet socially to plan the destruction of Britain as we know it. I have lived here for many years. The reason is very simple: it was the only place in central London I could afford. People who lived in Chelsea and Notting Hill Gate and Hampstead sympathised. Of course they did not know that it was to become the Athens of North One. Nor did I. For years it was described as \"up-and-coming\" Islington, but that was mainly in the fevered imagination of estate agents. We incomers kept our heads down and cultivated the locals nervously, not wanting to suggest that we had arrived to gentrify or disturb a working-class neighbourhood. </p> <p>For years no Range Rover or green wellie was ever seen in Islington. During the 80s, the working class voted with their feet. They couldn't believe their luck - people wanted to buy the run-down houses their nans had lumbered them with. They set off for Chingford and all places east. And suddenly commentators began to spot Islington Man and Islington Woman. No longer were they earnest muesli-makers, but they were active in politics, the law and journalism. They had graduated from impoverished trainee solicitors to partners in City law firms; they acquired a few titles; they took their holidays in Chiantishire; they meddled in politics. Tony Blair was their finest product. In this way the myth was born. </p> <p>The truth is that Islington is one of the most mixed boroughs in London with a huge proportion of council property; the schools are in a constant state of urban flux; the streets are often filthy; the parks are full of school kids drinking vodka and lighting up; the council is deeply in debt and the restaurants, with rare exceptions, are deplorable. At night, Upper Street, where the avocado pear was once just a rumour, is now six-deep in the hedonistic in search of guacamole. I have lived here so long I remember when you could park wherever you liked, and witches were burned on Islington Green. Or recycled, as we used to call it back then. </p> <p>\u0095 Simon Hoggart is away</p>",
  "<p>Hearing that Craig David song the other day, it was brought home to me by the silky voiced one how staid my bedtime habits have become. Call it the strains of busy modern life, the pressures of work, the long-standing relationship or just old fashioned laziness, but for too long now the Wilson household has been stuck in a bedtime radio rut. A lovely rut, but a rut all the same. Late Junction plus Radio 4 at the weekends, occasionally dipping into World Service fare. Sigh. </p> <p>David, on the other hand, meets a \"beautiful honey\" who asks him the time (that old one) on a Monday afternoon, treating her to Mo\u00ebt (that old one) on Tuesday, makin' lurve for the rest of the week and chillin' on Sunday. </p> <p>With this in mind, and translated into my wireless world, I began a giddy week of flirtation, eyeing up, rampant promiscuity with the knobs on my trannie. It has three. </p> <p>My first lovely honey came in the form of Edwina Currie on Late Night Currie (Radio 5 Live) on Sunday. This is such a perky little number, it makes Late Junction's penchant for Mongolian nose flute symphonies from the 12th century look positively pedestrian. This is mainly due to Currie's dominatrix approach to presenting. Tony Bullimore was on to talk about sailing round the world with Lenny Henry, as you do. </p> <p>Maybe it's since his mid-Atlantic near-death experience, but boy can he ramble on. He also has one of those talking tics that, once you notice it, drowns out everything else he says. My mum has a friend who does this, starting every sentence with \"I/She/He/They turned around and said_\". You can't listen without visualising every member of her personal cast as perpetual spinning tops. Bullimore's is \"you know\", said like a muted Frankie Howerd, linking together some of the longest stories known to man. La Currie was going crackers, snipping, snapping, finishing his sentences and verbally bundling him out of the studio. </p> <p>She interviewed a woman who has spent 40 years with chimps too. This was just as much fun, with the woman telling us about Froddo, \"The biggest, strongest chimp we've even known\". He knocks you over, drags you a bit and sometimes stamps on you. So that is where Edwina learned her interview technique. I had the most lurid dreams after this frothy mix, I can tell you. </p> <p>Monday, wimped out back to Late Junction in shock. Emboldened by some frog music (yes, really) I spent Tuesday bedtime in the company of shock jock James Whale on Talk Sport. It all made perfect sense in the world that is Talk. Whale was calling for camps in which to deposit scumbags (asylum seekers) and grotbags (beggars) and was encouraging us to \"smile\" about the fate of the Kursk, as it's sinking meant one sub and lots of Russian sailors less to worry about as enemies. The Cold War hasn't defrosted on Talk. </p> <p>\"Russia's more dangerous now than ever,\" he told one caller, a woman who like me had just found Whale by accident. Her husband was away, she said, as if that's the only reason she could go wild and touch that dial. I counted my blessings and dreamed of a camp for all the Talk Sport presenters and callers. One caller stopped what he was saying to inform the nation that a topless lady was peering out of a window in Kensington. Another had written to Teletext about the Kursk. Teletext. </p> <p>Wednesday brought the bizarre feast that is the Janice Long show (Radio 2). The mix is some music (Los Lobos, Sheryl Crow, kd lang), some competitions, and some gentle polemic from our Janice. Nasty Nick fever is out of control she said. \"There are people in this country who have committed far worse crimes, I'm sure,\" she said, all sage-like. </p> <p>A man called Thomas called in with the wrong answer for a quiz. Why do that? Why put him on just to humiliate him? Especially when he was clearly an ex-colleague of David Shayler's. \"I can't say where I am,\" said Tommy, calling from his workplace. Asked if he wanted to say hello to anyone, he almost whispered: \"That might reveal where I am.\" </p> <p>Where I am now, is back in my late-night listening rut. It's staid, I know, and Craig David will never pen a song about me, but I'm sleeping much better, thanks all the same.</p>",
  "<p>It is May 9, Europe Day. Ragged, marching lines of schoolchildren enter the Klagenfurt town square waving the blue-and-gold flags of the European Union under a cloudless sky. Lining the square, Europe has set out its stalls: Euro pens; Euro hats; Euro stickers; and Roland Prinz, an executive of the Hypo Bank, in a tie decorated with samples of the new euro currency, is glowing with Euro-pride as he thrusts into people's hands postcards which, like his tie, depict the banknotes that in two years' time will replace the Austrian schilling. More and more children arrive, and the square is now filled with Euro people, who five years ago, before entry into the EU, were just Austrians living in the region of Carinthia, on the border of Italy and Slovenia.</p> <p>One school has marked the event by giving each child a placard listing one of the rights enshrined in the European charter: freedom to work; freedom of religion; equality before the law, no censorship. Another has handed every pupil a home-made sign with the flag of a different country bearing the word peace in its language. Paix! Shalom! It's the opposite of a Nuremberg rally - informal, undisciplined, all the racist poison sucked out of it. Except that, according to the programme, the keynote speaker is to be J\u00f6rg Haider, governor of Carinthia and, until his resignation earlier that year, leader of the far-right Freedom Party, a man now tagged as Europe's most dangerous racist and xenophobe. (Haider, however, denies that his anti-immigration policies are xenophobic or racist.) Someone says he has decided not to turn up, after all. Where is he? In Vienna. Yet rumours persist that he might yet show, for he is, it's said, a law unto himself, who travels by helicopter and, like God, can be anywhere at short notice. And so we look up at the sky, hoping to hear a heavy drone. </p> <p>Because of Haider, Austria is under EU sanctions, Israel has cut off diplomatic relations, tourism to the country has plummeted, and Austrians themselves, travelling abroad, are being greeted with a cold shoulder. Last year, on October 3, the Freedom Party (FPO) came second in the elections, throwing the country into political paralysis and sparking the largest protest demonstrations Austria has ever known. After months of agonising, in February the FPO was invited by the conservative People's Party, under the chancellorship of Wolfgang Schussel, to join a coalition, partly in fear that, if no government could be formed and fresh elections were held, the FPO would win outright with its appeal to nationalism and calls for measures to restrict the numbers of foreign workers allowed into the country. </p> <p>A couple of months before the end of Europe's most catastrophically violent century, people were talking once more of a new menace coming out of Austria. Was Haider the new f\u00fchrer, an Austrian dictator who would provoke a world war? The comparison between Haider and Hitler is probably hysterical. Periods of history are not templates that can be imposed on each other. Austria has a population of eight million, and it took one of its foreign workers, an Israeli who runs a fast-food stand near a U-Bahn station in Vienna, to put things into perspective: \"Germany in the 30s was a strong country; it had an army, an air force, a navy - things Hitler could use to get what he wanted,\" he said. \"This place? What's Austria got? Nothing. It's a country of no consequence. It's got no military. No industry. Ski slopes - that's all.\" </p> <p>We would be fools to believe that nazism is resurgent in Europe. Seventy years ago, totalitarianism was not imposed on the people; it was a political movement with mass and intellectual support. In his book, Dark Continent: Europe's Twentieth Century, the historian Mark Mazower describes the hostility to democracy among the thinkers and politicians of the right in the 20s who dismissed parliamentarianism as \"sluggish, materialistic, unexciting and incapable of arousing the sympathy of the masses\". The experiment in excitement was, of course, a disaster. Despite the endurance of a few skinheads, vandalism in Jewish cemeteries and an admiration for the racist and anti-Semite (formerly known as a historian) David Irving, there is no real taste for fascism in Europe these days. If there is anything to fear, we will find it rooted in democratically elected parties that want all the economic benefits of EU membership without the political consequences. </p> <p>A new vision of a Europe is emerging. Borderless inside, it would form a largely white fortress to stand against the alien hordes of Muslims and former communists that menace it from the east, a place that pays lip-service to a tolerance of Jews while focusing on the main agenda, which is to keep immigrants out. In an opinion poll carried out by the French National Human Rights Commission earlier this year, 68% of respondents agreed with the statement: \"The presence in France of people from non-European countries is disturbing.\" </p> <p>In Denmark, Pia Kjaersgaard, leader of the ultra nationalist Danish People's Party with 18% support in opinion polls, regards Muslims as \"as good a people as you or me, but it's a problem in a Christian country to have too many Muslims\". According to the Organi-sation for Economic Co-Operation and Development, Denmark is one of the world's richest countries, with the least success in incorporating foreigners into the workforce. Souhail Ibrahim, a Palestinian who left the Social Democrats in January to form an immigrants' party, told a newspaper, \"I don't think Austria will do half of what they're doing to foreigners in Denmark.\" In Belgium, the Flemish Vlaams Blok, based in its Antwerp stronghold where it attracts 15% of the vote in regional elections, calls for an immediate halt to immigration and the expulsion of unemployed immigrants who are there already. In Norway, the Progress Party, on 15%, wants to divert money spent on immigrants to pensions and health care for Norwegians. And in Britain, with no far right worth speaking of, Labour and Conservatives vie with each other to criminalise refugees and asylum seekers, driving them into detention camps. </p> <p>Who will be at the helm of this new Europe? Across the other side of Klagenfurt town square, Roland Prinz formally introduces me to a smiling, courteous man with a neatly trimmed beard. He gives me his card, which is decorated with the flag of the European Union and the coat of arms of Carinthia, and identifies the bearer as Dr Johannes Maier, Landesmanndirektion, EU-Koordinationstelle: he is the civil servant who advises Haider on European affairs. Maier was delighted to speak to the Guardian, \"a great newspaper\" he said, in contrast to the response to previous efforts to get an interview with Haider himself.</p> <p>We stood and shielded our eyes from the strong sunlight as the children paraded with their European flags. \"Mr Haider is not understood in Europe,\" he told me. \"Yes, he made mistakes in former times, but now he is trying to make policies like any other regional governor in Europe. Please remember, we are not against Europe, we are one of the weaker regions south of the Alpine line, one of the economically weakest regions of Austria and we profit from Europe - one billion schillings [\u00a345 million] a year. But if we look at Europe as a whole, we see that we have no great politician any more, like Mitterand and Kohl, someone who sees Europe as more important than the interests of his country.\" </p> <p>And is Haider that great man? \"Mr Haider is a very intelligent politician,\" Maier replied. \"He can speak very well and pronounce the problems of the people. He is one of the most important politicians now living.\" </p> <p>In Haider's 1995 treatise, a book called The Freedom I Mean, he sets out his vision not just for Austria but for Europe, and so for us, too: \"The concept of a 'multicultural society' has become an ideology,\" he writes. \"Any policy of immigration must insist on assimilation and adaptation to the culture and norms of the indigenous population... Especially in education we have to defend Christian values. As more immigrants bring their children into western Europe, the indigenous population is slowly being substituted by aliens. It's hard to understand why Catholic bishops and clerics march in the streets defending a multi-cultural utopia when the threat to Christianity is so obvious... </p> <p>From 1989-1992, 10,400 new jobs were created in eastern Austria and all of them were filled by cheap foreign labour. At the same time employment of Austrians declined by 1,300... For [our ruling politicians] it's more important to experiment with our youth as guinea pigs in abstract, multicultural programmes.\"</p> <p>And finally, in a grand sign-off: \"Our movement seeks to rally the friends of freedom to regenerate the old democracies and inspire the new. Our enemies are legion both in eastern Europe and the west, where the threats are more subtle and insidious. The road will not be easy, but the rewards will be worth the struggle. That is the challenge for Austria. That is the vision for Europe. That is the freedom I mean.\" </p> <p>Does this sound familiar - particularly the invocation of some hazily defined \"enemies\" on to whom the reader can pin any label he chooses? </p> <p>What is the Freedom Party? It can protest as much as it likes, but the records show that it is directly descended from Austrian National Socialism. In 1945, there were 500,000 registered Nazis in the country. Deprived of the vote until the 1949 election, they formed such a formidable force that neither Conservatives nor Social Democrats dared ignore them, and considerable numbers were absorbed into these two main parties.</p> <p>Immediately after the election, Austria's Nazis organised their own party, the Association of Independents, which split in 1955 but re-formed itself one year later as the Freedom Party. Haider's father, Robert, had joined the Hitler Youth in 1929 and later became a member of the Austrian National Socialists, joining the FPO on its formation. His son became party secretary in Carinthia in 1976 and, supported by the party's most right wing elements, overthrew its liberal wing to become leader in 1986. The last of the liberals left the FPO in 1993. In 1994, according to the Documentation Centre for Austrian Resistance, the FPO campaigned against Austria joining the EU \"using theories of worldwide conspiracies connected with barely concealed anti-semitic arguments\". </p> <p>The FPO's success in recent years is not necessarily because Austria's voters are covert Nazis but because of the corruption of the two main parties, the Conservatives and the Social Democrats, who have shared power continuously since the end of the war.</p> <p>What alternative do Haider and the FPO offer? A few days before I arrived in Carinthia, I sat in the office of the Documentation Centre's director, Wolfgang Neugebauer, the son of a former lieutenant in the SS, who has spent much of his life documenting Austria's Nazi past. He is a spare, blond man who at school, in the 50s, had come under the influence of socialists and somehow wrenched himself away from his father's fascism.</p> <p>\"Haider is a right wing extremist,\" he said. \"He is a racist and xenophobe. Not everyone in the party has the same opinions [as he does], but this is a f\u00fchrer party, a leader party, and he dominates it. After his retirement at the party congress, he still remains the most important politician in the party, and I'm sure that in the next elections he will be a candidate for the Federal Chancellorship. I am not afraid of some small Nazi groups in Austria. The greater danger is the coalition between a party like the FPO, with strong anti-immigrant and xenophobic policies, and a conservative party, and such developments can take place in other countries, too. Such a coalition can realise policy where small groups of extremists can't.\"</p> <p>Would Haider's election as Chancellor be comparable to the election of Hitler in 1933? \"No, I don't think so,\" he replied. \"This is not possible in Europe in this time, but I think he will try to realise his propaganda in the field of foreign labourers and immigrants. There will be a stop to further immigration and, perhaps, the expulsion of refugees. And there will be some reduction in freedom of opinion by cutting the subsidies for newspapers.\" </p> <p>In Vienna, I bought a copy of the Economist, because its cover story was about Europe's need for more immigrants. Because of the ageing of the baby boom generation, it stated, \"Europe's working population is falling, while Europeans' aspirations to do only clean, sedentary, well-paid jobs are constantly on the rise.\" It described a new sort of migrant, a \"labour tourist\", who shuttles \"resourcefully back and forth across an EU border, usually from eastern Europe into Germany and Austria, and often earns a living in the Union to support a family outside it.\" </p> <p>Economically, foreign workers are exactly what Europe needs but, to the Economist writer, this is being hampered by Europe's failure to adjust to being a continent of immigration, such as America or Australia, instead of a continent of nation states. Europe is currently desperate for workers trained in hi-tech skills, which India is now producing in huge numbers, but would-be emigrants are reluctant to go to Germany, where they are only offered short-term contracts with no right to bring their families. America pays more, and offers them and their families citizenship. </p> <p>The two men I bought the magazine from were victims of this myopia. They were immigrants from India. They had come 10 years ago on student visas to gain degrees in business studies, leaving their wives at home, and, like many non-white entrants to the country, had never been able to turn that initial entry into a work permit. One of them explained how the system operated: \"You apply for a job, and the boss of the company will give you a paper for the government labour office and they should give you permission to work, but a lot of people have been living here for up to eight years and every time they go to the government office, they say no, and this is much more common for Indians and Africans than for Yugoslavs.\" One of the anomalies of the new borderless Europe is that its non-citizens do not share the right to work in other EU countries. The two newspaper sellers were effectively resident in Austria, but not the EU. </p> <p>The only way they had found to earn a living was to work for a firm, which required them to take 100 copies a day of a newspaper called Kronen Zeitung, the country's most popular paper, similar in its appeal to our own Daily Mail. They were expected to sell 80 of these; if there was a shortfall, they had to pay for the unsold copies themselves. Being forced to sell Kronen Zeitung was a humiliation: \"The paper is always against foreigners. Every day there's more propaganda, and nobody talks about it, not the Social Democrats, not the Greens. They are always writing about Africans, saying they are drug dealers.\" Abuse and racist attacks from neo-Nazis wasn't the main problem. One of the men showed me the apartment rental ads in Kronen Zeitung and pointed out the line in almost every one that said, \"Austrians only\". They saw racism as sewn into the very fabric of the country. </p> <p>While we were talking, a man who was looking at Rolling Stone could no longer contain himself. \"In my opinion, Kronen Zeitung is a newspaper which manipulates everything, including photos,\" he said. He explained that recently the paper had run a picture of an anti-Freedom Party demonstrator hitting a policeman. A week or so later, it was exposed as the juxtaposition of two separate photographs. \"If you manipulate photographs and no one complains, what kind of a country is this?\" he asked.</p> <p>His name was Edward Boehler, he was 36, a veteran of the anti-Haider demonstrations, and he worked for an advertising agency. I asked him why people his age voted for the FPO. \"These are the new yuppies who are interested in their careers and not in immigrants,\" he said. \"They see themselves as the cool, clever people of the new century. They're not really interested in the roots of the Freedom Party. For them, it's the party that takes us very fast into the chic future. For myself, I would be very glad if in 10 or 20 years' time, Austria didn't exist any more. It's just a region. But I don't think many Austrians think this.\" </p> <p>In Britain, we are used to thinking of the right and the far right in a particular way: little Englanders, nostalgic for Britain's long-lost greatness, insular, conservative. In Austria, the reverse is true. Boehler's description of the FPO supporters' amputation of history helped me understand a puzzling conversation I'd had the night before over a drink in the area of Vienna known as the Bermuda Triangle, a maze of streets heaving with bars and restaurants, and full of the hip young people of Vienna, indistinguishable from their counterparts in London's Camden Town or New York's East Village.</p> <p>Here, I thought, I would hear the voice of young Austria, the anti-Haider forces who have led the demonstrations. So, sitting at a table outside the Casablanca bar, I asked the people at the next table, six old schoolfriends, all in their mid-20s, about Europe. They were all for it. They understood implicitly the advantage of being able to work and travel in other countries. Yet they confirmed that, politically, they were on the right and one of them, the most articulate, was an economics student who was sympathetic to the FPO. </p> <p>\"Haider says we must be newer,\" said Markus. \"The FPO is not racist. If they were, do you think I would have voted for them? It's a democratic party, and here in Austria we are a democracy. I know people who went to the demonstrations and it's their democratic right - in Austria, everyone has the right to say what they want.\" The other five nodded in agreement. The only girl with them said, \"If the FPO makes mistakes, they will not be in parliament.\" Once again, I understood how it was possible to build a party of the far right among people who consider themselves to be the same as their peers in other European countries, not special, or different, or secretly plotting a campaign for world domination. </p> <p>But what about the FPO's Nazi past? Had they studied the legacy of fascism in school? They all insisted that they had. As for the FPO, Markus pointed out, \"Most of the higher national socialists after the war went into the socialist and conservative parties. All the old Nazis were integrated without questions. It's strange, of course, but it's like in Russia with the communist party [some of whose members are now in government], and it was the same with us in 1945.\" When they themselves raised the question of immigrants, it was the refugees from the former Yugoslavia that concerned them.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/weekend/story/0,3605,359076,00.html\">Read part two of 'Whose Europe is it anyway?' here</a></p>",
  "<p>Towards the end of last year there was a flurry of lists published identifying the most significant figures of the past century and millennium. Apart from genius, the other factor that united the distinguished roll calls; Shakespeare and Mozart, Darwin and Galileo, Marx and Newton, was that most of the listees were dead. A rare exception was Professor Carl Djerassi, whose name earned an impressively high share of mentions. </p> <p>Djerassi, a 77-year-old organic chemist, has indeed had a distinguished career. As a young man his name was on the patent for the first antihistamines, he subsequently undertook pioneering work in the area of pest control and the 1,200 papers he has published in academic and scientific journals detailing his ongoing work bear witness to an astonishing productivity. But his place among the pantheon of influence was based on a single piece of research conducted nearly 50 years ago in a laboratory in Mexico City. It was there, on October 15 1951, that Djerassi succeeded in creating a man-made version of nature's contraceptive hormone, progesterone, that could be taken orally. This was the birth of the pill and Djerassi would ever after be known as its father. </p> <p>\"Yes I am proud to be called the father of the pill,\" he now says in his soothing mittel-European drawl apparently unaltered by the 60 years he has lived in America since leaving Nazi occupied Austria. \"But identifying scientists is really only a surrogate for identifying the inventions or discoveries. Maybe it is true that Shakespeare's plays would never been written if it wasn't for Shakespeare. But I'm certain that if we didn't do our work then someone else would have come along shortly afterwards and done it.\" </p> <p>This month has seen the 40th anniversary of the commercial availability of the pill. The long-standing debate as to its social, sexual, cultural and economic impact has been re-energised and broadened to take in the ethical issues arising from medical advances in fertility. </p> <p>While it comes as no surprise that Djerassi, despite his apparent modesty, should energetically join in the debate on questions such as the male pill, abortion and the improved techniques for artificial insemination, the medium in which he chooses to do it is unusual. Although he does appear on the international lecture circuit and takes an innovative postgraduate class on ethics at Stanford University in California, for the past decade or so his primary activity has been as a novelist, memoirist and playwright. It is through fiction that he has chosen to take on the thorny moral and practical issues thrown up by his research half a century ago. </p> <p>Djerassi has never been a typical scientist. He made his reputation as a chemist, but he has also been an astute businessman. He is a serious collector of art and owns one of the most significant private collections of Paul Klee's works in the world. As an admirer of the writings of Aldous Huxley, in the mid 1950s he personally tested out Huxley's claim that mescaline should be the opium of the intellegentsia when he and two students undertook a mescaline trip during a picnic at his house. He funded a spectacularly failed feature film in the mid-60s and has, for the past 20 years, been a benefactor to more than 1,000 writers, painters, choreographers and sculptors at an extremely successful artist's colony he founded on his California ranch. </p> <p>\"He's a scientist, artist, philosopher and mensch all in one,\" says Stephen Jay Gould who claims that Djerassi's book, The Pill, Pygmy Chimps, and Degas' Horse, \"is the very best of scientific autobiography\". Iris Murdoch said his 1989 debut novel, Cantor's Dilemma, was \"a brilliant tale of the morals and politics of contemporary science. Exciting, moving and brilliantly written\". David Lodge praises not only the content of his fictional output, but also his achievement in writing it all. \"It is amazing that a man of his age who has had such a distinguished scientific career has turned to literature and is so determined to succeed.\" </p> <p>Djerassi's chosen genre is \"science-in-fiction\", which is very different from science fiction because of its scrupulous scientific accuracy. In Cantor's Dilemma, which has sold more than 100,000 copies in the decade since publication, he explores the complex layers of trust between scientific colleagues. His next novel, The Bourbaki Gambit, takes on the cult of youth and the craving for name recognition in science when four distinguished old professors shake things up by pooling their work and publishing under a false name. His 1998 book, NO, illuminated the workings of the commercial bio-tech industry in relation to a pre-Viagra impotence cure. \"In the novel I use the example of Muse, which was a real invention before Viagra,\" he explains. \"But I changed the name to Musa, which is the botanical name for the banana. I still think that would have been a better trade name,\" he laughs. </p> <p>While undoubtedly revelling in this \"intellectual polygamy\", Djerassi also claims it is just a practical response to the challenges he has set himself. \"The more different ways we have of teaching certain difficult things the better off we are. I think that we as scientists should educate the public about the scientific and technological advances so that society can decide how best to use them. This is my missionary obsession.\" </p> <p>He says that the idea that scientists should make moral or ethical decisions about these issues is fundamentally wrong. \"Just because you have won a Nobel Prize doesn't mean you're qualified to make these important judgments. Ethics is a social construct and is something that society should establish. But in order to make educated decisions about this you must be aware of it.\" </p> <p>Djerassi has said that the most fundamental affect the development of the pill had on him was to gradually shift his interest from the \"hard\" science undertaken in the lab to the \"soft\" science of thinking about the social conse quences arising from scientific and technological developments. </p> <p>\"It is already possible to choose the sex of unborn children,\" he explains. \"The sperm of recently deceased men can be used to fertilise an egg. A woman could preserve millions of eggs when she is in her early 20s for use when she is post-menopausal in her late 40s. There is so much going on and the most important three-letter word in this century will not be \"sex\" but \"but\". For all of the wonderful opportunities these advances will throw up there will always be a but. These are things that interest me and this is what I want to start a debate about. But they are all grey questions and I don't say things are right or wrong.\" </p> <p>David Lodge agrees that Djerassi's fiction doesn't have a specific didactic aim. \"But he does have an informational or a pedagogic aim,\" says Lodge. \"He sees fiction as a means of communicating information about science and its moral and ethical implications. There is an explicit programme to bridge the two cultures.\" </p> <p>Lodge says that this tradition in literature can be traced back to Plato's dialogues, in which the interaction of characters is used to explore philosophical or political problems. \"There is a long and honourable tradition of using fiction to explore ideas but I think that Carl would hope that his novels were rather more mainstream than that. He does aim to interest you in the plight of his characters; their weaknesses and desires and ambitions.\" </p> <p>Djerassi himself acknowledges that such concern with literary history and technique is an unlikely turn of events. If there was a plan for his life it was that he should become a Viennese doctor like his parents. He says now that without Hitler's intervention that was what he would have become, living a bourgeois life and probably even voting for Kurt Waldheim as president. </p> <p>He was born in Vienna in 1923. His mother was an Ashkenazi Jew and his father Sephardic, but he says that their home life was virtually non-religious and medicine was everything. His mother was a physician who became a dentist and his father, a Bulgarian, was a doctor who specialised in treating venereal disease in the days before penicillin. Djerassi's Barmitzvah had to be postponed when a new, and lucrative, syphilis patient presented himself at his father's clinic. </p> <p>Although he remembers his early years as prosperous and enjoyable - he attended the same school as Sigmund Freud - in fact, things weren't quite as they seemed. Djerassi's parents had actually divorced when Carl was six but he didn't know this had happened until his early teens. </p> <p>The first few years of his life were spent in Bulgaria so when he returned to Vienna to go to school he didn't really think it odd that he only saw his father when he came to Vienna or when the young Carl visited him during the summer. \"I suppose I was simply too young and generally too happy to wonder that my parents didn't live together\". The truth eventually emerged when his father was forced to introduce a girlfriend to his son. </p> <p>In a strange echo of this a quarter of a century later, Djerassi himself was evasive to his children about his own first marriage, to a woman whom he had divorced before he married their mother. He had left details blank in a Who's Who entry and been vague about dates but when he eventually told his teenage daughter the truth he was relieved that she was more fascinated than traumatised by the revelation. </p> <p>When the anschluss took place in April 1938 it was his father's Bulgarian nationality that saved Djerassi's life. His father returned to Vienna from Bulgaria, re-married his mother and, by July, had taken her and the 14-year-old Carl out of the country. As soon as they were safe the marriage was again annulled. Djerassi's mother went to England to arrange passage to America, while the young Carl stayed in Bulgaria where he learned English. </p> <p>He didn't return to Austria until the late 1980s. \"I have felt very ambivalently towards Austria for many years,\" he says. \"They seemed to refuse to come to terms with their past in the way that Germany did.\" </p> <p>Although he had received many awards and honorary degrees from around the world, it wasn't until a few years ago that he received a call from the Austrian consulate enquiring whether he would accept an award for culture and science. He says he gave it a lot of thought before agreeing. \"When I finally did return I took the opportunity to walk around the city alone and I realised how beautiful it was, and still is, and what an extraordinary cultural mixture it represented. But it was a very bitter-sweet experience.\" </p> <p>The journey from Vienna he began in 1938 ended in New York a year later. While his father stayed in Bulgaria, Carl and his mother arrived in America virtually penniless. \"But despite everything I knew that getting an education was vital. I knew that would be my union card.\" He therefore took the remarkable step of writing to first lady, Eleanor Roosevelt, to explain his situation. His letter was passed on to the Institute of International Education and after a short spell in a high school in Newark he was offered a scholarship to a Presbyterian college in Missouri. By 1941, when he was only 17 and due to, \"some administrative subterfuge\" because he hadn't officially graduated from high school, he completed his chemistry degree in a single year at Kenyon College in Ohio before going on to do Post-graduate work at the University of Wisconsin. </p> <p>Gilbert Stork, a fellow organic chemist, was a contemporary at Wisconsin and recalls Djerassi's extraordinary determination. \"He had and still has the incredible ability to keep his eye on the goal,\" says Stork. \"I remember him having this skiing accident. He had to make the very difficult decision whether to have an operation to remove his knee. This was at a time when replacement parts were not very good but he didn't hesitate for a moment. And not only does he still walk faster than most people, he even got a ski instructor to give him a technique for what amounted to skiing on one leg. He was determined that he wasn't going to be stopped skiing by the minor matter of losing a knee.\" </p> <p>Djerassi has given considerable thought to the roots of his overwhelming determination. He describes himself a workaholic but adds that, \"I'm not proud of that. I have always had the feeling that there is not enough time to get everything done\". </p> <p>He says that up until 1985, when he was 62, death was very much a theoretical concept. \"I really considered myself immortal in the same way that most young people consider themselves immortal.\" He was then diagnosed with cancer of the colon. In fact, Djerassi's health has been reasonably good since then but the episode marked a sea-change in the way he lived his life. </p> <p>\"I took a long time to value human interaction and spontaneity. If a student said they wanted to speak to me I wouldn't say 'sit down'. I would say 'how long do you want to talk for?' and arrange a meeting in a few days. That is insulting. It took me 50 years to realise I wouldn't like to be on the receiving end of this treatment and now if I do it at least I apologise for doing it.\" </p> <p>He says that if there is a hormone that characterises the scientific life it is testosterone. He talks about the machismo of working long hours and craving recognition from your peers. In fact he was rare among his scientific colleagues in that he had some interests outside the lab and did do things such as go to the theatre occasionally. \"But the idea that scientists undertake science purely for science's sake is not quite right,\" he says. \"We are curious but it is not just curiosity. There is also the desire for rewards. It was the same for me as well. I have lots of degrees and awards but the fact that I did not have an award from Austria for science is something that, if I didn't exactly mope around thinking about it all the time, it was something I was aware of.\" </p> <p>This remarkable sense of drive propelled Djerassi through the early years of his career. After four years as a research chemist he joined the Swiss pharmaceutical company, CIBA, which was based in New Jersey. It was one of the original powerhouses in steroids chemistry and medicine. In 1949 he was made an associate director at Syntex in Mexico City. He says it was a bold move to go south of the Rio Grande but he felt it was right as both he and Syntex had the same goal - to establish a scientific reputation. This was initially achieved in the highly competitive field of cortisone research, which had significant impact on the treatment of arthritis. The original research into what became the pill was not initially concerned with contraception but with certain types of menstrual disorders and cancer. Other people had thought of the idea of using progesterone as a contraceptive but it would have required daily injections. </p> <p>Djerassi's triumph was to develop a synthetic contraceptive that could be taken by mouth. While still working at Syntex as president of research, in 1968 he founded his own firm, Zoecon. It developed novel approaches to insect control, the gist of which is summed up in a chapter in his autobiography called How Do You Get a Cockroach to Take the Pill. </p> <p>As the 60s ended so Djerassi became an increasingly public figure. He was open in his opposition to the government policy in Vietnam and made it onto the White House enemies list - as disclosed during Watergate - because of his involvement in Senator George McGovern's 1972 presidential campaign, which included serving as a delegate at Democratic convention in Miami. It was therefore an uneasy occasion for both sides when, in 1973, Djerassi was presented with the National Medal of Science by a somewhat distracted President Nixon, on the very day that Spiro Agnew, the vice president, resigned. </p> <p>Gilbert Stork says that Djerassi was ready and waiting for fame when it arrived. \"To a considerable extent he expected to be famous. If anything, I suspect he thought it was slower in coming than he could have reasonably expected.\" </p> <p>Along with the fame he also acquired a considerable fortune: not from his right to the patent for the pill, for which he was given only $1 by Syntex - \"that was the usual deal and I was and am entirely happy with it\" - but from his ownership of stock in Syntex, which became a huge Wall Street success story, and then Zoecon. An original Syntex share cost $2. By 1993 they were valued at $8,000. He bought a large ranch near San Francisco which was called Smip - Syntex Made It Possible - and his collection of art swelled with works by the likes of Giacometti, Picasso, Henry Moore and Degas. \"I liked to collect painters who were also sculptors. I was always interested in people who don't just work in one area.\" </p> <p>But while he was increasingly professionally successful, his domestic life, already troubled, was about to be shattered. He had met his first wife when they were both at college at Kenyon and married her when he was a 19-year-old virgin. The marriage had ended after six years in 1949 when Djerassi moved to Mexico and asked for a divorce to marry Norma Lundholm, who was pregnant with Pamela, his first child. Ironically for the father of the pill, the pregnancy resulted from a broken condom.</p> <p> After his son, Dale, was born in 1953 he had a vasectomy. His mother's extreme possessiveness and repeated threats of suicide had been a contributory factor in the failure of his first marriage. When her behaviour threatened his new relationship he broke off contact with her, although he continued to support her financially. She returned to New York and resumed medical practice in a hospital. He didn't see her again until many years later, when she was suffering from advanced Alzheimer's disease and did not recognise him. His relationship with his father, who came to live in America in 1949, was much better. From then until his death aged 96, they occupied neighbouring seats at the San Francisco opera. </p> <p>Carl Djerassi's marriage to Norma ended in 1976 and he is now married to the Stanford literature professor and biographer, Diane Middlebrook. Dale Djerassi is a film-maker who produced the film '68 with his then wife Isabel Maxwell, daughter of Robert. Pamela Djerassi was an artist who lived on the Californian ranch with her husband. She committed suicide in 1978, when she was 28. </p> <p>\"It was obviously the greatest tragedy of my life,\" Djerassi says. \"I wanted to mark her life by producing something living out of her death. Not a building or a statue.\" His response was to turn Smip - now named Sic Manebimus in Pace (\"Thus We'll Remain in Peace\") - into an artists colony. </p> <p>The area was very important to Pamela and, when hiking at the ranch with her, they used to stop at a beautiful small waterfall. He told his daughter this is where he would want his ashes scattered, never dreaming that this is where he would scatter hers. </p> <p>\"When I go to the ranch now I do think that this wouldn't have happened if Pamela hadn't died. Of course, that doesn't make it a good thing that she died, but at least something positive came out of it.\" </p> <p>The writer Vikram Seth and the composer John Adams, among many others, have passed through the colony. Alan Hollinghurst, the novelist, stayed there for a month while starting to write his novel The Folding Star. \"It's an extraordinary place. You travel down this terrifying route called Bear Gulch Road and you do feel you've gone into another world... Djerassi has a benign, but slightly remote presence at the ranch.\" </p> <p>The other thing Djerassi did after his daughter's death was to sell off the bulk of his art collection. \"It was very traumatic but I am now glad that I did it. I know now that physical possessions are far from being the only thing that matters. I realised I could do nothing for dead artists. But with an artist's colony I could support living artists.\" </p> <p>He has become a significant patron to many artists and a generous benefactor of art. The large Bill Woodrow sculpture in the lobby of the new British Library, of a massive book that is also a bench, was donated by Djerassi, who has a flat in Maida Vale in London and spends every summer here. </p> <p>He continues to collect work by Paul Klee, whose art was being vilified by the Nazis at about the same time as Djerassi was being forced to leave Austria. Most of the collection is now housed in a special gallery at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art and the museum will inherit the entire collection when Djerassi dies. Heather Whitmore Jain, the curatorial associate at SFMoma, looks after the collection. \"What is very interesting are the similarities between Djerassi and Klee. They are both renaissance men. Klee was obviously a very creative artist, but his art is so varied and he had this scientific and methodical side to him. For instance he systematically numbered all his work and Djerassi seems to share that combination of creativity and methodicalness.\" </p> <p>Throughout the time Djerassi was working in the commercial sector he also maintained an academic career. He was a professor at Wayne State University in Michigan and, in 1959, took up his current position as professor of chemistry at Stanford. He says he intends to be the first working professor aged 100. \"I've got a chance. My father didn't die until he was 96 and that was in an accident.\" He had a fall after an exercise session. </p> <p>His intellectual exploration of the social ramifications of his work has influenced his teaching, both in terms of subject matter and approach. He encouraged his ethics students at Stanford to write short stories. He even persuaded the prestigious Nature magazine to publish a piece of fiction for the first time in its history when the students illustrated an ethical dilemma in a renga - linked paragraphs written by different people - story. Djerassi pulled off a similar coup when the equally prestigious Science magazine included dialogue from his play about artificial insemination, An Immaculate Misconception. Orla Smith was the editor at Science who commissioned the piece. \"What attracted me about the play was that it is scientifically accurate. He was discussing real scientific issues in a very interesting way.\" </p> <p>Djerassi says that the key issue in the 21st century will be sex in an age of mechanical reproduction. \"It will change the relationship between men and women in a very fundamental way. Sex and reproduction can be separated. One will be for recreation while the other will be done under a microscope.\" </p> <p>An Immaculate Misconception was directed on BBC World Service radio by Andy Jordan, who will direct Djerassi's second play, Oxygen, co-written with the Nobel Prize-winning chemist, Roald Hoffmann, for the radio station this year. Oxygen, which looks at the culture and behavioural characteristics of chemists through the eyes of the Nobel Prize committee, will be the first play to be staged at the prize-giving conference in Sweden next year. </p> <p>For someone who has operated for so long in such contentious areas Djerassi has sustained comparatively few personal or professional attacks. He says the only trouble he gets usually comes from fundamentalists of all persuasions who attend lectures billed as being by the \"father of the pill\". </p> <p>\"They expect me to be either a male chauvinist pig or a pill pusher - or both. But that is not me. I believe in a contraceptive supermarket where all sorts of contraception is available that fits with people's own personal and cultural and religious and whatever other requirements. What I don't like is other people telling them what they can and cannot use. </p> <p>\"I do have an opinion about abortion. I believe in a woman's right to choose. I dislike the way the debate has been characterised as pro-life and pro-abortion. The pro-life people tend to be obsessed with life before birth but pay very little attention to it afterwards. Quite often the same people who are against abortion are also against gun control and for the death penalty. I think it is impossible to make abortion illegal, so we should all work together to make it unnecessary,\" he says. </p> <p>\"But rather than say my opinion I prefer to present the arguments to people and let them debate it. That's where my genre of 'science in fiction' or 'science in theatre' has an advantage. I can enlighten people and leave a few questions in their mind. I have a motive in telling a story.
