  "The Liberal Democrat conference agenda announced \"Speech by the Rt Hon Alan Beith MP\". Normally this would not provoke great excitment - a demonstration of quick drying paint might cause more adrenalin to spurt - and indeed the hall was less than full. <p>Mr Beith is a amiable and quietly spoken man, who happens to be deputy leader of the party. Now and again he stands for leader, but no-one takes this very seriously. He has a slightly puzzled air, like an accountant who has been mooned by a busload of schoolgirls. Geese occasionally say \"boo\" to him. </p> <p>Before Peter Sutcliffe's arrest, Clement Freud, then a Liberal MP, used to insist that Mr Beith was the Yorkshire Ripper, a drollery which worked only because it would be hard to imagine anyone who looked or behaved less like a homicidal maniac. </p> <p>I myself had a fantasy that mild mannered Alan Beith would sometimes disappear into a phone booth and emerge as Super Pad, able to throttle his opponents with piano wire, but I have seen him in the same room as Sir Paddy too many times for that to be possible. </p> <p>In a sometimes waspish profile in the Directory of Liberal Biography, Michael Meadowcroft hints at a more Machiavellian cast of mind than most of us have been able to perceive. In the past couple of years he has suffered two personal tragedies. Old political reference books show that, apart from wearing different spectacles, his appearance has scarcely changed in the 27 years he has been an MP. </p> <p>As a speaker, Mr Beith might best be described as a rabble soother. So it was a pleasant surprise when he produced a rattling speech, full of pungent points, some genuine passion, and some good jokes. (\"Did you come to the conference by train? I did - and I was three and a half hours late. They say Richard Branson isn't experienced at running a lottery; he already runs one, and it's called Virgin Trains.\") </p> <p>He said how outrageous it was that parliament was not even sitting during the fuel crisis. \" Not even sitting because of our archaic parliamentary calendar which closes the place down for three months of the year. </p> <p>\"Westminster could do nothing, and the public saw parliament as powerless and irrelevant.\" Sincerity is a hard thing to fake, even in a political speech, and Mr Beith was clearly and genuinely outraged. </p> <p>He said that he found his constituents universally disillusioned with the government. \"They would like to stick the whole cabinet in the Big Brother house, so they could vote out one every week... though they might draw the line at seeing John Prescott in the shower.\" </p> <p>But he was just as angry with the fuel protesters and \"the anarchy in which a picket decides whether you get the fuel to take your wife to hospital, or for a nurse to visit your grandmother\". </p> <p>As for the Tories, he reserved a special and venemous contempt for them. Many people had felt excluded by 18 years of Tory rule. \"William Hague's rhetoric suggests an even worse kind of exclusiveness. Now it's asylum seekers and Asian doctors singled out for opprobrium.\" </p> <p>With a fierce warning that politics was in danger of becoming irrelevant to people's lives, he sat down. </p> <p>The audience looked faintly numb. They had just been stirred by a Beith speech. They were as startled as they might have done if he had performed a striptease on the bar with Jackie Ballard. But after a few moments they realised their duty and, yes, a little late in the day, Alan Beith, of all people, won a standing ovation from the conference.</p>",
  "<p>Nine months on, most of us have started to lose our enthusiasm for all things millennial. While spending large sums of money on weighty silver ornaments seemed appropriate at the dawn of 2000, just a few months later such souvenirs seem, well, so last century. </p> <p>But one would hope this is not the case for those who buy their silver knick-knacks from Scottish jeweller and luxury goods store, Hamilton and Inches.

  "No more asylum seekers will be accepted by Liverpool city council because it says the Home Office owes it \u00a3174,000. <p>Councillors allege they have been left with a debt of \u00a396,000 for housing the asylum seekers between December 1999 and March this year, before official dispersal arrangements came into effect. </p> <p>The Liberal Democrat-controlled council has incurred a further \u00a378,000 loss because it set aside accommodation, but did not receive the number of asylum seekers it had been told by the government to expect. </p> <p>Richard Kemp, a member of the city council, said it was a farcical situation. \"To make matters worse, they have ignored our repeated requests to place asylum seekers through the council. Instead they have put 1,000 directly into private hands and unsatisfactory conditions and we have been left to pick up the pieces.\" </p> <p>He said the council was the first northern authority to come to the rescue of the Home Office and overloaded councils in the south, to offer to house asylum seekers. </p> <p>\"Official arrangements had not been agreed at that stage, but everything we did was on the firm understanding that our costs would be covered,\" he said. </p> <p>The people of Liverpool had proved their willingness to accept asylum seekers, often when no one else would. Mr Kemp said they could not afford to bear the brunt of unfulfilled obligations from the Home Office. </p> <p>\"Clearly, the government and Liverpool city council have a different definition about what satisfactory accommodation means,\" he added. </p> <p>But the leader of the Labour group on the city council said he was deeply concerned by the refusal to accept any more asylum seekers. Gideon Ben -Tovim dissociated himself from Mr Kemp's comments. </p> <p>He said the council had a moral, humanitarian obligation to give shelter to refugees and asylum seekers. </p> <p>Fazil Kawani, communications director of the Refugee Council, said his body had always maintained that asylum seekers should be accommodated through local authorities, as they were best placed to house them in suitable locations and to help them gain access to local services. </p> <p>He said local authorities were also in a good position to raise public awareness of the reasons why refugees flee persecution and require protection in Britain, and to help to develop good community relations between the host population and refugees. </p> <p>The Refugee Council is urging the government to create conditions in which local authorities can take part in the new support arrangements and to ensure that their costs are fully met. </p> <p>However, a Home Office spokesman said Liverpool city council had exceeded the amount it could claim back for asylum seekers. </p> <p>The limit had been set at \u00a3140 a week for single people and \u00a3240 a week for families. But between December 6 last year and March 31 this year, Liverpool had exceeded this limit by \u00a3200,000, by claiming \u00a3225 a week for single asylum seekers and \u00a3309 for families. </p> <p>\"The Home Office has asked the audit commission to investigate why there is a range of costs to support asylum seekers,\" he said. </p> <p>\"We always made clear that councils would not be reimbursed if they exceeded those limits, and the majority lived within the set costs.\"</p>",
  "<p><strong>Has anyone made more runs in Tests without scoring a century than Zimbabwe's Alistair Campbell?</strong> asks Dean Ilott from Mexico City </p> <p>Going into the current (second) Test against New Zealand Campbell had made 1938 runs in 44 matches, with a highest score of 99. Only two men have made more without ever reaching a hundred: Chetan Chauhan of India has the most, with 2084 in 40 Tests (highest score 97), and Deryck Murray of West Indies made 1993 in 62 Tests (HS 91). So Campbell needs another 147 runs to take the record - but I'm sure he'd rather make a century. The highest aggregates for the other Test countries are: England - John Emburey, 1713 runs; Australia - Shane Warne, 1613; South Africa - Shaun Pollock, 1531; New Zealand - Dipak Patel, 1200 (he was once run out for 99); Pakistan - Wasim Bari, 1366; Sri Lanka - Chandika Hathurusinghe, 1274.</p> <p> <strong> If a bowler makes a caught-and-bowled is it counted as a normal catch or is it tallied separately?</strong> asks Umaar Adeeb </p> <p>Yes, return catches are included in the overall tallies for fielders. The player with the most caught-and-bowleds in Tests is Derek Underwood, the England slow left-arm bowler of the 1960s and 70s, who managed 20 - I suppose this shows he was a faster-than-usual spinner who could vary his pace well and persuade the batsman to play too soon. Anil Kumble, the Indian wristspinner, currently has 18.</p> <p> <strong> Where can I obtain a copy of the autobiography of BS Chandrasekhar?</strong> asks Ziobho from India </p> <p>The only book I know of about \"Chandra\", India's high-stepping legspinner of the 1960s and '70s, was a slim paperback called \"The Winning Hand\", written by Rajan Bala and published in 1993. You can buy it online for \u00a33.95 (plus postage) from Sportspages, the UK bookshop:<a href=\"http://www.sportspages.co.uk/\"> click here</a> to go to their website.</p> <p> <strong> Which England and Surrey cricketer was nicknamed \"The Colonel\"?</strong> asks Tony Platt </p> <p>This was Ken Barrington, the popular and prolific Surrey and England batsman of the 1960s. He earned his name from his jaunty, almost military, bearing. Barrington was usually a dour batsman - he was once dropped by England for scoring too slowly - but he had a mischievous sense of humour and managed to reach no fewer than four of his 20 Test centuries with a six. Barrington, whose final batting average (from 82 Tests) was a tremendous 58.67, was forced to retire in 1968 after he had a heart attack. He later became England's assistant manager/coach, and was working in that capacity when he suffered another, fatal, heart attack during England's Test series in the West Indies early in 1981.</p> <p> <strong> Is it true that three pairs of brothers once played in the same Test team?</strong> asks Mike Dixon </p> <p>Yes, this happened at Harare in 1997-98, when Andy and Grant Flower, Gavin and John Rennie, and Bryan and Paul Strang all played for Zimbabwe against New Zealand. Zimbabwe's side also included Guy Whittall, whose cousin Andy was the 12th man. The match was drawn.</p> <p> <strong> Will a new Australian edition of \"Wisden Cricketers' Almanack\" be published later this year?</strong> asks Michael Neill </p> <p>The third edition of the Australian Wisden - similar to the original but green has just gone to the printers. It will be published in Australia at the end of October, and should be available in England around the end of November. You should be able to order it through wisden.com: keep an eye on our homepage for details.</p> <p> <strong> Which was the last football ground to stage a Test in England?</strong> asks Neil Walters </p> <p>Unless you count The Oval (which hosted the FA Cup final in the 19th century), the only English football ground which has staged a cricket Test is Sheffield United's Bramall Lane, where the third Test of the 1902 Ashes series was played (Australia won by 143 runs). Yorkshire played one or two matches each season there until 1973, when an extra stand was built and the ground was given over entirely to football, but no more Tests were held there.</p> <p> He might be Sir Garfield now, but I thought that throughout his illustrious playing career GS Sobers was known as \"Gary\". But these days everybody seems to spell his name with a double R. Is this right? asks David Sugarman from France </p> <p>We got the answer from the horse's mouth: David Frith, the founding editor of \"Wisden Cricket Monthly\", once asked Sobers how he spelt his first name, and was told it had two Rs. So from then on WCM has always printed his name as Garry.</p> <p> <strong> Can you tell me the date of next year's Test in Barbados?</strong> asks Jason Fage </p> <p> Next year's Bridgetown Test is due to start on March 29. It will be the third game of what should be a fascinating five-match series between West Indies and South Africa. They have played only one previous Test in the Caribbean (in Bridgetown in 1991-92, when West Indies came from behind to win), although they have played a full series in South Africa - in 1998-99, when West Indies won 5-0. </p> <p><em>Steven Lynch is managing editor of Wisden Cricket Monthly.

  "<p>Juan Tom\u00e1s de Salas, who has died aged 62, was the driving force behind modern journalism in Spain. He founded a score of publications, ranging from weekly and daily newspapers to a women's and a motoring magazine, all of which introduced a refreshingly novel way of presenting serious information. More significantly, his newspapers strongly contributed to the spread of democratic values, even during the last years of the Franco regime. It was an achievement certainly not without risk. </p> <p>Born into a middle-class family in the central Spanish city of Valladolid, he studied at the Complutense University of Madrid and began his remarkable career by running an underground newsagency in opposition to Franco. The young law student also tried to oppose the repression of the time through the tiny Frente de Liberaci\u00f3n Popular. He was nearly arrested in 1962 but escaped to the Columbian embassy in Madrid, where he was granted asylum. Eight months later he went into exile in Columbia. </p> <p>In Bogota, De Salas became a columnist for the daily newspaper El Tiempo. Mexican author Carlos Fuentes wrote in the Spanish daily El Pais that De Salas was a pioneer, who spread his warmth and concern and his talent for modern journalism in Latin America. But above all, De Salas wanted to return to Spain. </p> <p>He moved to Paris, the centre of opposition to the Franco dictatorship abroad and as close to Spain as he could be. There he continued his journalistic and political activities and translated Hugh Thomas's book on the Spanish civil war. Then, seven years after his escape, De Salas returned to Spain. He founded a publishing company, Inpulsa, determined to prepare public opinion in Spain for the return of democracy. When, two years later, the regime allowed him to publish his weekly Cambio 16, it was an immediate success, becoming a symbol of the opposition, and a banner of liberal, democratic values. From time to time, Cambio 16 (cambio means change in Spanish and 16 referred to the number of shareholders) was censored - there were heavy fines or the confiscation of entire editions - but this only added to the interest of its growing readership. </p> <p>De Salas wanted his paper to be both \"popular\" and \"serious\". And he achieved it. His monthly, Historia 16, launched six months after Franco died, maintained the same standard, with expert contributions on historic events written for the general public. </p> <p>De Salas' dream, the publication of a daily newspaper, had to wait a little longer. But within a year of Franco's death, Diario 16 conquered the streets with a specially composed song which became a hit. The lyrics expressed a desire for national reconciliation and a liberal and civilised new society. </p> <p>For 17 years he directed Cambio 16, which developed into a keen and lively newspaper. Unfortunately its commercial success did not last. The economic crisis and its consequences, together with internal strife, led to its dissolution. De Salas was forced to resign - debts had risen to \u00a330m - and Diario 16 was put up for sale in 1993. </p> <p>A tall, heavily-built man, de Salas radiated a youthful enthusiasm and natural gusto for the good things of life. He is survived by his Canadian wife, Barbara. </p> <p>Juan Tomas de Salas, journalist, born April 30 1938; died August 22 2000</p>",
  "<p>Anti-globalisation activists and international bankers are bracing themselves for a week of street action and possible confrontation planned to coincide with the annual meeting of the World Bank and International Monetary Fund in Prague. </p> <p>Hundreds of protesters have already gathered in the Czech capital and tens of thousands are expected to arrive within the next few days in the run up to the opening day of the summit on Tuesday. </p> <p>Yesterday they outlined their protest schedule, which peaks with plans to blockade the meeting place of the world bankers and financiers, in an effort to persuade leaders to \"dismantle\" the two institutions. </p> <p>\"We will surround the conference centre until we've made our point clear, and until they decide for themselves on abolishing both institutions,\" said Alice Dvorska of Inpeg, the Initiative against economic globalisation, an umbrella group uniting most of the protesters. </p> <p>The summit is the first of its kind to be held in a former Soviet bloc country. A counter summit, S26, on Tuesday will be accompanied by protest action in more than 40 other countries. Organisers stressed that S26 would be non-violent and would start in the morning with a \"rally for global justice\", with thousands of protesters expected to gather in Prague's Namesti Miru (Peace Square). They would then begin a \"unity march\" towards the conference centre in the south of the city, despite being refused a legal permit by city hall officials who cited \"traffic complications\". </p> <p>Police spokeswoman Iva Knolova said: \"Thanks to the security measures we have taken, the opponents will not manage to carry out the planned blockade, and we will increase even further the number of guards around the congress centre and monitor the situation closely.\" </p> <p>Authorities expressed fears that Prague would become a stage for violence, announcing a ban on demonstrations in some city districts, and in many cases refusing to grant legal permits for specific rallies and marches. </p> <p><strong> Festive mood</strong><br> </p> <p> But Ms Dvorska said: \"We hope to create an atmosphere that is festive and celebratory, but that also demonstrates our outrage at the unjust, misguided policies that the IMF and World Bank force upon the world.\" </p> <p>In the north-east of Prague finishing touches were being put to a huge tent-city at the giant Strahov stadium. It will open today and has room to house 15,000 protesters at a cost of \u00a326 per person for the duration of the conference. </p> <p>Protesters said they had sent an open letter to the Czech President, Vaclav Havel, asking the former dissident to defend their right to protest. \"In November 1989 we won some fundamental democratic rights, including the right to free assembly and free expression of political opinions,\" the letter read. \"We demand that our fundamental civil rights and freedoms are respected.\" </p> <p>Visitors arriving in the Czech Republic yesterday were reporting long delays at the borders amid stringent police checks. </p> <p>Police said they had turned back 600 people on the border with Germany. \"Half of them weren't allowed in because their cars were deemed to be in too bad a condition, and most of the others were carrying dangerous objects or didn't have valid documents,\" said west Bohemia police spokeswoman Milada Sucha. </p> <p>Chelsea Mozen of Inpeg said they were lobbying for three Dutch cooks who had been turned back: \"We find it hard to believe how organic vegetarian cooks could be a threat to national security.\"</p>",

  "As Charles Kennedy put the finishing touches to today's party conference speech in Bournemouth a trusted ally was asked if the genial Liberal Democrat leader is really hungry enough to be a successful modern politician. <p>\"Of course, Charles is hungry, he's very ambitious. He wants to be prime minister,\" his colleague replied. The answer will surprise critics in the Lib Dem ranks who feel that Kennedy has not hit the ground running as fast as they would wish in the year since he succeeded the energetic Paddy Ashdown. </p> <p>After Action Man, Inaction Man. \"Where's the bloody strategy, Paddy had a strategy for everything, even lunch,\" the critics murmur. Today's speech must address that concern, MPs agree. There will be affection, but it will be tempered with expectation: solid policy thoughts, some inspiration and strategic direction. </p> <p>Mr Kennedy refuses to be panicked. \"I'm not going to do a William Hague. I'd rather people accuse me of having a low profile while my popularity goes up than have a high profile making a fool of myself while my popularity goes down,\" he tells his staff. </p> <p>Mr Hague, at 39, a year his junior, has been an important factor in Mr Kennedy's first year. He privately admits it would have been harder finding political space for the Lib Dems with John Major or Kenneth Clarke as Tory leader. Mr Hague's populist lurch to the right - on crime, asylum, tax-and-spend - has genuinely angered Mr Kennedy. </p> <p>It did not stop him inviting William and Ffion to dine at his Westminster flat with girlfriend Sarah Gurling to establish better personal rapport. Fortunately they turned him down. That was before the sensational byelection capture of Romsey by Sandra Gidley which cheered the activists. </p> <p>This week's conference has (as so often) been overshadowed by dramas in the world beyond Bournemouth. But even here Mr Kennedy has been lucky. Furious with Tony Blair, voters have not all swung to the Tories. Half Labour's defectors have parked their votes with the Lib Dems, giving them poll ratings of 21% (NOP) and 22% (Guardian/ICM). </p> <p>Lib Dem strategists believe it is a blip which will subside, but it is a handy blip, one which will still send them into the coming campaign with a higher base line and give some credibility to what will be the key theme of Mr Kennedy's speech at lunchtime. </p> <p>It will be aimed at \"One Nation\" moderate Tories in the south where 50 potential Romseys lurk, provided they are not frightened off by tax-and-spend. </p> <p>Even allowing for luck and bullish polls, what is surprising in Bournemouth this week is how little backbiting there has been among activists who like nothing better than to dwell on the shortcomings of whoever happens to be their leader. When one such sceptic, Lord Russell, dined the other night with MP Robert Maclennan, they agreed - to their surprise - that \"Charles hasn't put a foot wrong\". </p> <p>\"I haven't felt happier in the party for years,\" confided Mr Maclennan, Mr Kennedy's Highland neighbour. The historian in Lord Russell, often a thorn in Paddy Ashdown's flesh, believes that \"Charles has a Gladstonian instinct for good timing and for the centre of gravity in his party. Any decision he takes will be in the interests of the party\". </p> <p>That last phrase is a dig at Mr Ashdown's obsession with Lib-Labbery and the joint consultative committee (JCC) he formed with Tony Blair - albeit without getting either of the promised referendums, on the euro or electoral reform for Westminster. One of Mr Kennedy's tasks this past year has been what aides call \"a gentle distancing\" from the JCC, ready to fight Labour hard in the election, but done without a fuss. </p> <p>A few delegates complain that Mr Kennedy privately promised to get more out of Mr Blair. They also say that he may be good at doing media, but lacks drive or organisational skills. </p> <p>Policy needed a shake-up when he inherited the leadership. They had even slipped on the environment where Lib Dems were once ahead of the game. Europe, another key policy area, was frustrating for different reasons, Labour's caution on the euro. </p> <p>Those fields, plus a strong commitment to good public services and a Highlander's gut instinct for social justice are what will distinguish the Lib Dem manifesto. </p> <p>But Mr Kennedy's hold on his party also rests on the tours he has made of the grassroots and the \"more open and collegiate, less military\" style he has adopted among Commons colleagues. </p> <p>His most nervous moment in the past year was his appearance at the Cenotaph on Remembrance Sunday. Mr Kennedy is old enough to remember the fury over Michael Foot's duffle coat appearance in 1981. Notoriously parsimonious about clothes (\"I've been trying to get him out of \u00a399 suits,\" says one aide) he went out and bought a \u00a3500 overcoat. </p> <p>Optimistic talk of winning an extra 50 seats is just that. Mr Kennedy (always a byelection pessimist) believes he can do better than the current 47 seats, but his chief interest is in positioning Lib Dem candidates in second place, not third place, with an eye to the general election of 2005.</p>",
  "A bitter row has broken out among senior German politicians over two victims of neo-Nazi violence who were ordered out of the country after their ordeals. <p>One has already left. The other is awaiting deportation. In both cases, the results of the attacks are said to have been used by regional officials in eastern Germany as grounds for getting rid of them.</p> <p>Their cases have been taken up by the speaker of the federal parliament, Wolfgang Thierse, who has claimed they demonstrate covert official backing for the far right.</p> <p>One of the foreigners, an Egyptian, Salah el-Nemr, owned a pizzeria in the town of Elsterwerda, 100 miles south-east of Berlin. After it was burned down by skinheads in October 1998, he was told he had lost his right to stay in Germany because his resident's permit was dependent on his having a viable business.</p> <p>Mr el-Nemr, who lived in Germany for 10 years, left the country voluntarily to avoid getting a deportation stamp in his passport that would have prevented him from returning as a visitor. He told a correspondent for the newspaper Berliner Zeitung in Cairo that he hoped to be allowed back in to marry his German fiancee.</p> <p>An Algerian asylum seeker, who has so far been identified only as Khaleb B, lost his right to stay on the grounds that he was no longer mentally fit to manage his life by himself.</p> <p>However, he and his lawyer maintain that this is because of the trauma he underwent in February 1999 when he watched as a friend was lynched in the streets of Guben near the Polish border.</p> <p>He is currently awaiting deportation. The trial of his friend's alleged killers began last week.</p> <p>The political row has erupted against a background of mounting alarm in the federal government over the prevalence of far right and xenophobic sentiment in the formerly communist east. The Brandenburg region around Berlin where both men lived has become notorious for race hate attacks.</p> <p>On July 28, Mr Thierse wrote to the interior minister in the Brandenburg regional government, describing the treatment of the two men as \"devastating\".</p> <p>The speaker, a member of the governing Social Democratic party (SDP), said that decisions taken by the regional administration's aliens department \"give the impression that German government agencies not only accept the consequences of rightwing and racist activity, but even use them as an official pretext\".</p> <p>His accusation brought a heated reaction from the authorities in Brandenburg. Earlier this month, the regional interior minister, J\u00f6rg Sch\u00f6nbohm, a Christian Democrat, replied to Mr Thierse demanding an apology. The head of the Christian Democrat group in the Brandenburg regional assembly accused the speaker of \"abusing his position\".</p> <p>Mr Thierse has taken a keen interest in the issue of neo-Nazi violence and its social underpinnings. He is a frequent visitor to schools in the east.</p> <p>The Brandenburg authorities have claimed that Mr el-Nemr's engagement is a ploy aimed at securing his return. However, when Berliner Zeitung's correspondent traced him in Cairo, he produced an intimate love letter from his fiancee. He was also carrying photographs of the dog and flat he left behind and of his fiancee before and after their separation.</p> <p>One of his friends was quoted as saying: \"Salah changed in Germany. He is serious about his work and always punctual. But what use are these German values if these people are capable of destroying the life of a peaceable, hard-working man from one moment to the next?\"1818 </p>",
  "\u0095It is noteworthy that since the Elian Gonzalez affair, migration tragedies in the Florida Straits have become worthy of front page news (Hijacked Cuban plane crashes off Florida, September 20). But it is a pity that the Elian case has not resulted in a more informed approach to the issue of Cuba-US migration. <p>Your report persists in repeating the lie that Cubans who migrate to the US are seeking \"asylum\" there. This is demonstrably false. In Florida, polls of migrants show that the vast majority regard themselves as economic rather than political refugees. </p> <p>The notion that Cubans are escaping political repression is hugely exaggerated. Only two weeks ago, a Cuban who stowed away in the cargo hold of an Air France jet was deported back to Cuba after the French authorites found no evidence that he was fleeing political persecution at home. </p> <p>It is also important to take into account the American Cuban Adjustment Act of 1966 which encourages Cubans to migrate by providing them with the right to residency, a work permit and the possibility of applying for US citizenship one year after arrival. No other foreign nationals enjoy such privileges. </p> <p><b>Dr Stephen Wilkinson</b><br>Hampton<br> Wick</p>",
  "<p>On 21 March 1770 Yorkshireman James Cook, instructed to find if newly-found Australia was inhabited, recorded in his diary seeing \"smook [sic] of fire\". Today's Olympic flame burns over a land where aboriginal claims are still hotly disputed. </p> <p>Archaeologists are engaged in a less public row about the Australian from Lake Mungo. If scientists are right, he died 20,000 years before modern humans reached Europe. Could it be that his relatives discovered Yorkshire? </p> <p>The Mungo controversy (some archaeologists prefer the original date of a mere 30,000 to the new one of 62,000 years ago) is just one of many to hit the normally placid world of Homo sapiens fossils. From South Africa to Patagonia, our story has become hot news. </p> <p>No longer thought to have originated in Europe, Homo sapiens and modern human behaviour are now both seen as children of Africa. </p> <p>The most dramatic evidence is emerging in South Africa, where the apartheid regime denied African origins for even our remotest ancestors. Excavations at the coastal Blombos Cave by Chris Henshilwood of the State University of New York are uncovering a vivid picture of people there 100,000 years ago. </p> <p>The fossils are Homo sapiens, but it is artefacts that are exciting academics: finely made stone spear points, bone tools that Henshilwood sees as awls for making clothes, red ochre (probably used for body decoration), including a piece with small scratched lines that, accepting the excavator's reading, is among the oldest examples of art in the world. Of tools made from silcrete only found 20 miles from the cave, Henshilwood ventures: \"This is advanced thought.\" </p> <p>Planning and co-operation, further human characteristics, are seen in seafood remains at Blombos. The inhabitants appear to have collected shellfish as bait for two particular species of near-shore fish. </p> <p>Such early use of marine foods has impressed Marta Lahr of Cambridge University. Here, she says, is a mechanism for the speed at which Homo sapiens left Africa. The rich, resources on the coast were more dependable than game animals. The human population grew, shellfish fields were eaten out, so people had to move up the coast to find more. </p> <p>Support comes from Eritrea. Robert Walter and colleagues who are with Mexico's Centro de Investigacion Cientifica y Educacion Superior de Ensenada. They recently announced the discovery of 125,000 year old stone tools, thought to have been used for harvesting oysters and crabs. At that time the southern end of the Red Sea was dry, and people could have moved along the shore uninterrupted from South Africa all the way to Java, Indonesia. From there it was only a small sea journey to reach the larger continent of Greater Australia. By then, says Lahr, familiarity with the sea would have given these early humans the skills to make that crossing. One of their descendants would be the man from Lake Mungo, buried in a coat of red ochre. </p> <p>That early people exploited plants, small mammals and fish is the key to new thinking in the Americas. Distinctive stone spear tips known as Clovis Points, common in north America, are sometimes found with bones of mammoth and bison. Nothing dated from before 13,000 years ago. </p> <p>Then Tom Dillehay of Kentucky University claimed evidence for people in Chile 14,700 years ago - implying the first northern arrivals from Asia some centuries before. As at Blombos, the Monte Verde finds are spectacular: finely made spear points, animal hides, rope, even a human footprint. The people ate mastodons, but they also, says Dillehay, dug roots, harvested seaweed (he found chewed lumps) and ate a variety of other foods. </p> <p>Now suggestions for the arrival of people range from 15,000 to 50,000 years ago, canoes are proposed as a mode of travel and some even consider Spain a possible place of origin for the first Americans. </p> <p>Part of the problem is that east Asia, a key area for early human dispersal, has yet to provide a Monte Verde or Blombos. Graeme Barker of Leicester University is directing a project at Niah, Borneo, where a supposed 40,000 year old sapiens skull was found in 1958. First results are discouraging. Paul Pettit of the Oxford University radiocarbon unit is not convinced the skull is as old as once thought. He also looked at the copious evidence from Europe, where he found nothing older than 31,000 years ago - half the age of humans in Australia. Why so late? Australia, 62,000 years ago, really was the terra nullius Europeans wanted in the 19th century: there had never been hominids there before. In Europe there were neanderthals. Archaeology shows they had many characteristics of modern humans. They made sophisticated tools, buried their dead and dallied with primitive art. Did they outsmart the first humans? </p> <p>John Stuart, palaeontologist in a Cambridge-based international mapping project, has a controversial answer to why neanderthals died out. At a Lisbon conference last week, he reminded delegates how numbers of large mammals disappeared in the ice age. Neanderthals, he said, were just another large mammal pushed to extinction by climate. As Europe warmed, the way was opened for us. </p> <p>Running, swimming and rowing: they are how we got where we are. But Sydney delegates should not forget the beach barbie. It was the mainstay of Australia's first inhabitants.</p>",
  "<p>Winter in the Antarctic , the coldest and windiest place on earth. Millions of kilometres of sea remain frozen all year, but as temperatures plummet, up to 20 million square kilometres of ocean - an area twice the size of the USA - are covered with a white layer of ice. </p> <p>The ice may appear barren, but a closer look reveals a multitude of microbial life. Small as they are, these microbes exert an influence over the whole Southern Ocean, and may control the destiny of penguins and seals thousands of miles away. The loss of their habitat, the ice, through global warming, could have devastating consequences. </p> <p>To understand this story, stop looking at things from a warm-blooded human perspective - we wouldn't last long in that cold - and think small. For the microbes that get trapped in the ice, it's not a bad place to be. </p> <p>Temperatures on the ice surface can reach -30C, but on the underside it is a relatively hospitable -1.8C, free from wind and currents. The microbes of this region can function well at freezing temperatures, often as actively as organisms in far warmer waters. </p> <p>\"Ice algae\" were formally described more than 150 years ago. Any passenger on an ice- breaking ship would notice the brown and green layers on the underside of ice that had broken up.But these organisms were not thought to be an important part of the ecology of Polar seas, and attention focused on the algal blooms in the open ocean. </p> <p>As the sea begins to freeze, algae become attached to the growing ice crystals and get concentrated as the ice forms. The majority of the algae live in channels of brine formed when salt gets squeezed out as the water freezes, giving rise to salt concentrations five times higher than seawater. </p> <p>Only a tiny fraction of the light hitting the surface of the ice reaches the bottom, where the majority of the algae live, so the organisms must be well adapted to high salt concentrations and low light. </p> <p>The ice is home to a diverse and complex ecosystem, composed of more than 200 species of algae, as well as a massive diversity of bacteria, viruses, protozoa and higher organisms such as amphipods and even flatworms. It is a mini-ecosystem in a frozen sponge. </p> <p>Algae are microscopic plants that use the sun's light to harvest carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. When spring approaches, the algal population explodes on a diet of sunlight and minerals from the sea. British Antarctic Survey biologist Simon Brockington says: \"Diving in the middle of winter, the new ice is pristine white. Later in the year it can be like looking up at a field of grass.\" </p> <p>The area of the southern sea-ice far exceeds that of the Antarctic continent, covering an area up to two and a half times the size of Australia. That's a very large meadow. </p> <p>As the algae bloom, they suck in millions of tonnes of carbon dioxide which they convert into carbon. This is an important process in the global carbon cycle, and scientists estimate that the ice algae account for 5% of the total amount of carbon trapped through photosynthesis in this region. </p> <p>Algae are the fuel for the entire southern ocean ecosystem because, like grass, they are grazed by bigger creatures. They sustain the most important Antarctic marine food resource, the small shrimplike krill. Krill can graze the underside of the ice at an amazing rate, clearing a 20cm square in five minutes, says Peter Marshall at the Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar Marine Research. Krill are the main meal for many predators such as penguins, seals and whales. </p> <p>Twenty years ago, prior to comprehensive research into the sea-ice, it was assumed that krill were fed by the summer algal bloom in the open water, then hibernated on the sea floor in winter. However, scuba divers under the winter sea-ice off the Antarctic Peninsula saw krill nibbling the ice-algae which were still present in the ice. </p> <p>Two thousands of miles north east of the Antarctic Peninsula, on the island of South Georgia, British Antarctic Survey scientists were studying creatures at the opposite end of the food chain, penguins and fur seals. Three or four times a decade they observed terrible years for breeding, with few pups or chicks surviving. Feeding studies showed that the lean years for these creatures were also lean years for the krill, with no juvenile krill in the water. Krill are not only important for wildlife, but for commercial fisheries too. So it was vital to find out what was causing these slumps. </p> <p>For answers, scientists looked to the Antarctic Peninsula, a major breeding ground for krill and the possible source of the South Georgia krill. A strong relationship was observed between the extent of sea-ice and the krill numbers. In years when the climate reduced the ice cover near the Antarctic Peninsula, krill production slumped. So the icy pastures of the ice-algae may be having a huge impact on the ecology of the whole Southern Ocean. </p> <p>Biologist Robin Ross of the Marine Science Institute, University of California, thinks that without the winter pasture krill \"wouldn't be able to live through winter\". </p> <p>If normal climatic conditions were having such a profound impact on Southern Ocean ecology through sea-ice formation, what havoc could global warming cause? </p> <p>Warmer temperatures can mean thinner sea-ice, which, says biologist William Ambrose of Bates College USA, \"is likely to promote lux uriant growth of algae\", based on observations from thin sea-ice years in the Arctic. </p> <p>Ironically more algae mean less ice. Being dark, ice-algae absorb heat from the sun more than the ice that surrounds them, speeding up melting and pitting the ice with a honeycomb of large pores. But if atmospheric warming reduces the area of sea-ice, the future could be bleak for penguins, seals and the fishing industry. \"If global warming caused low ice extent for three out of four years\" says Ross, \"there could be a serious problem for krill survival.\" </p> <p>\u0095 Dr Alison George is a microbiologist with the British Antarctic Survey in Cambridge .</p>",
  "What will happen to nine Cubans whose plane crashed into the gulf of Mexico looked likely to emerge as a fresh source of controversy in US-Cuban relations as investigations continued yesterday into what appeared to be an ill-fated bid to fly to Florida. <p>Reports from Cuba suggested that the plane, a small state-owned crop-duster, had been stolen by its pilot, Lenin Iglesias, who picked up nine friends and relatives at an airstrip on the western tip of the island before taking off and heading out over the Florida strait on Tuesday morning.</p> <p>Mr Iglesias told Cuban air-traffic control that the plane had been hijacked \"with children aboard\" - an apparent precaution to avoid being shot down by the Cuban air force. The plane then appears to have veered off course, run out of fuel, and ditched in the sea, 60 miles west of the Cuban coast. An unidentified male passenger died in the crash.</p> <p>One of the survivors, Rodolfo Fuentes, was reported by doctors to be recovering well in a Key West hospital. The other survivors were due to be transferred last night to a US coast guard cutter where they were to be interviewed by FBI and immigration officials.</p> <p>According to a 1996 law, would-be Cuban emigrants who succeed in setting foot on dry land in the US are allowed to stay.</p>"
